The Preface


Reader.


A
Bout 
18
 Moneths agoe I did write and publish. The Fa∣mous History of 
Don Belli∣anis
 of 
Greece,
 or The Ho∣nour of Chivalry in three Parts; In my Preface to the Reader I gaue an ac∣count of most of the Histo∣ries that are Printed and published in our 
English
 Tongue, I did recommend them in general to thy reading, but 
I
 was more par∣ticular in my recommendations of one entitled, The Seven Wise Masters, for 
I
 placed it in the Front na∣ming it the first of all others. It being of so great e∣steem in 
Ireland,
 that next to the Horn-book and knowledge of Letters, Children are in general put to read in it, and I know that only by that Book severall have Learned to read well, so great is the pleasure that young and old take in reading thereof.


Since my writting that Book, I chanced to meet with an old Book entitled, The History of Prince 
E∣rastus
 in 
French,
 and upon reading some part of it, 
I
 found it to be not only The History of 
Erastus,
 but also of The Seven Wise Masters of 
Rome;
 and to con∣teine all those Stories that are in the former Book of

 the seven Wise Masters; I compared them one with an other and saw that though the several Stories were a∣like, yet my 
French
 book was much the better, being larger and conteining more variety of Stories then the 
English
 one which was not only very short in the Sub∣stance but also so old in the language that it was hardly good sence: 
I
 therefore thought it might be worth my while to Translate and print this 
French
 book; where∣fore 
I
 fell to work and have now perfected it to my great cost and trouble, my cost hath been extraordinary in the Pictures, for I have bestowed more on this book then are in any book of this bigness in 
English;
 so that the Rea∣der may read every particular of all the Histories in Picture; and indeed Picture is not only convenient, but necessary in all Histories of this nature there is so great affinity between them, that Picture is said to be Dumb or silent History & History to be speaking Picture there being a Poetical Art 
o be used in both, 
Pictoribus at∣que Poetis.
 This book being thus chargable to me, 
I
 hope the Reader will consider me in the price, if the former were so well accepted, 
I
 doubt not but this will be as well received 
 as it exceed, that in price so 
I
 do assure thee it exceeds that in w
 
 hast now all that was ever written on this subject in any language what∣soever for 
I
 have 
 Translated the 
French
 book, but also compared it with the Originall in 
Italian,
 and added to that all that hath been written in 
English.


We have several books of this nature in 
English,
 viz 
Novels,
 but they are all trans
, and though more neat and modeish, yet come far short in worth and sub∣stance to this; none is in any respect so like this as one of my own composition, it is called 
The Unlucky Citi∣zen;
 and in every respect much like this, for in this

 of 
Erastustis
 an 
Unlucky
 or 
Unfortunate
 Prince, (I may well Term him so, that for several days together expected when he should be led to the Gallows and executed for a fact which he was Innocent of;) so in that is an 
Unlucky
 or 
Unfortunate
 man, as you may at large read in that Story and both this book and that are Stored with variety of Examples and Histories, and both alike adorned with Picture. In the conclusion of this book the Maligne influences of the Stars being past, our 
Unlucky
 or 
Unfortunate
 Prince, is cleered from the Crime for which he was accused, and is Justified to all the world; being thereby in a very good and happy con∣dition: and our 
Unlucky
 or 
Unfortunate
 Citizen hath good hopes that the Maligne influence of his Stars are over, and that his condition will be for the future pros∣perous and succesful, or at the least more screen then for∣merly, however 
Fiat Dei Voluntas.
 Although this book of Prince 
Erastus
 is as compleatly finished as you can ex∣pect is; yet that of the 
Unlucky Citizen
 is not, for I intend suddenly to prosecute the Story not only of my many misfortunes, but to furnish it with more variety of 
Novels
 or 
Examples;
 neither shall it be wanting of 
Precepts
 as well as 
Presidents,
 and such as shall be Profitable, and of good and generall use for Readers of any quality; so that I question not, but it will be worthy thy Perusall


Although this present History of 
Erastus
 is Stored with variety of 
Novels,
 yet t
y are most to one pur∣pose, to demonstrate 
 the Wit, Cunning, and wickedness of 
Las
 
 you have many exa
ples to prove 
 
nd 
 I may g
e you a re∣lishing tast of what is in the Book, give 
 s
 to re∣late

 one in the Preface.


An old rich Gentleman being married to a young want
n L
dy, her husband being somewhat wanting in his Nocturnall duty, she placed that affection due to him on a Soldier; and although she was careful to conceal her Liscentious passion, yet the Old man being jealous soon perceived it, but to be more certain of what he doubted he pretends a journey for some days, and taking money away he goes.


This Lady had acquainted an old 
Matrona
 with her Amours who had informed the Soldier that it was his god fortune to be loved by such a Lady; he being a true S
n of 
, was 
ry well pleased with this hopeful 
 of so 
 
V
us:
 and nothing was want∣
 
 to 
 Conjuncti
 but an opportunity, which was now come by 
he absence of the Old man, of which the Soldier having noti
e he according to orders walked be∣fore the Gate of the house that Evening, expecting ad∣mittance.


The hu band having st
i
d thereabouts all day, at night returned h me, and found the Soldier attending which caused him to suspect the occasion, and his sus∣pition was confirmed when he came 
 the house and sound a banquet prepared, and his wife ready to re∣
ive her Champion She was so surprized at her h
band app
arance, that she could not make him any reasonable answ r to the many questions he propounded wher
fore his passion being raised against her he resol∣
d to b
 revenged on her, which he thus effects; he strip'd her naked and so 
d her to a Pond in the middle wh
re 
f he ty'd her fast to a Post, thinking by that 
 
hat heat that had occasioned her malady and h
 
si
.




The Soldier having worn out his patience with atten¦dance, went to the old womans who had been his broak∣er in this intended Merchandize; and tells her of his fruitless attendance she wonders at it and presently goes back with him to the house, where having a Key she en∣ters the Gate, and leaving the Soldier in an outer Court went towards the house where she saw the young Lady in the Pond in the manner her husband had left her. After some small Dialogue, whereby they both under∣stood how the State of their affairs stood; the young La∣dy having still a mind to enjoy her Gallant, it was a∣greed that the old one should unstrip and stand in her stead, whilest she went to her Lover. The young woman being dressed in the Old womans cloathes went to the Soldier, who at first took her to be the 
Matron,
 but by her speech finding it to be otherwise, he soon enjoyed those pleasures they had so long desired.


The old Gentleman who was gone to bed could not sleep for thinking of that nights adventure, and believing that he was not sufficiently revenged on his wife he resolves on a further, and leaving his bed goes down to the place where he left his wife, and utters outragious speeches against her, which the old woman who was there, thought was best not to answer but to remain si∣lent; at which he was so, enraged that having a Knife in one hand he took her by the nose and cut it off, throw∣ing it at her face, and wishing her to present it to her Lover, he returns to bed. Soon after the Lady having taken leave of her young man, returnes to the old wo∣man; who although almost dead with her wound gives her an account of her misfortune she hears this Story with admiration, esteeming her self doubly happy in ha∣ving enjoyed her friends love, and escaped her hus∣bnads fury: and now she comforts the old woman by

 promiscing her a great reward. This pacified her, and the young woman believing that the worst was past & that better was to come, unty'd the old one, and again took her place in the water, where having contriv'd how to mannage her matter so as to come off with honour; she thus plaid her trick. Believing that her husband was within hearing as indeed he was, She with a Low voice makes a heavy complaint against him that had so w
ongd his innocent and chast wife, and then she Im∣plores the Assistance of 
Diana
 and all the other Goddess∣es of Chastity and Marriage to vindicate her and that they would shew some example on her, to demonstrate her Chastity; and if they pleased to be so gracious to her to restore that former Beauty which her husband had deprived her of, by rash & unhumane cutting off her nose. This was the sum of her complaint & prayer, & then continuing for some time silent she at length brake forth into lowd exclaimations of joy & thanksgiving to the heavenly powers for her restoration, calling to her husband to come and see the token of her innocence: 
He
 being amazed at this discourse was resolved to try the truth, & riseing out of his bed lighted a candle, went down and comes to his wife, and beholding her face finds it whole and sound: whereat standing amazed he began to detest his rashness and fear heavens vengeance and deprecating the wickedness of his impious fury; he loos∣eth his most chast wife and brings her again to her bed, she by this means recovering both her nose & the affection of her husband. And now Reader let this Story suf∣fice as the first Dish of meat you are to have at this ban∣quet, which 
I
 hope will please your pallet; wherefore I pray fall too and much good may it do you


Yours, 
Fra. Kirkman.

THE HISTORY OF PRINCE ERASTUS Son to the EMPEROUR DIOCLESIAN And those famous PHILOSOPHERS CALLED THE Seven Wise Masters OF ROME.




CHAP. I.
 The Emperor 
Dioclesian
 delivers his Son 
Erastus,
 to seven Philosophers to be instructed in all the Arts, and Sciences. The Empress the Mother of 
Erastus
 dyes.


ONE Thousand and forty years after the foun∣dation of the Citty of 
Rome,
 the Emperour 
Dioclesian,
 a wise and powerful Prince, reigned in

 that Superb and Tryumphant City, he being mar∣ried to a very fair and virtuous Princess: had by her a Son who was so well proportioned, and of so exquisite beauty, that every one concluded him to be more Divine than Humain; in such manner that the affection which all the world had for the singu∣larities and graces of this young Prince, caused that the name of 
Erastus
 was given to him, which is as much as to say amiable, and although he was but yet in his very infancy, yet in that tender age, every one concluded that in time this young Prince would arrive to very great perfection, and would not be in any thing inferiour to the other Emperours his Predecessors; and moreover there was not any Mathematician, Astrologer, Diviner, Physiognomist nor Chyromancer, who did not e∣very one respectively finde by his Art, that accord∣ing to the influences of the Caelestial Planets, this Child should be of an admirable Spirit; very sin∣gular in all Sciences, and accomplished in all man∣ner of virtue, wherein the Emperor took so great content as the Majesty of his degree, and the gran∣deur of such a Father did require; purposing on his part not to frustrate so good a Nature, but to use his endeavour to render his Son, such as the opinion of the world had conceived of him. And for asmuch as nei∣ther Illustrious blood, good Constellations, nor large Estates, are not of themselves sufficient to render a man great, if Nature be not helped and assisted by Sciences and Vertues; therefore so soon as this In∣fant 
Erastus
 was of an Age fit for to learn, the Em∣perour provided himself of the most knowing men that he could find, whereby he might be in∣structed,

 under whose tuition he so well profited, that at the age of ten years he began to have a taste of the secrets of Phylosophy; and the good Em∣perour very well knowing that the Wisdome and Prudence of the Son, does ordinarily redound to the glory of the Father, and therefore resolving to render his Son perfect in Phylosophy, he (from amongst all the Wise Men of his Empire) made choice of seven Phylosophers, of whose skill and knowledge he had sufficient experience, that he might confidently commit the charge of such a Per∣son, who in time might succeed to the Government of the great Roman Empire The Emperour having thus delivered his Son to their charge, commanded them to instruct him with the greatest dexterity, as well in Vertue and good Manners, as in Letters, and all sorts of Sciences, that all the world might know of what a Father this young Prince was Son: and by what admirable Masters he had been in∣structed, promising to these Phylosophers very great recompences, besides the Honour they would acquire of all the World, by the good doctrine wherein they would instruct the Prince,


These Philosophers having with merry hearts taken this charge, by reason of the Divine Spirit which they knew to be in the young 
Erastus,
 which gave them hopes that they should attain to great honour in the execution thereof; and that they might the better execute it, they made choice of a place without the City of 
Rome,
 which was very well sc
tuated, and enriched with all things necessa∣ry for the entertainment of man; for in the first place, the Air was there very temperate, there was

 very pleasant walks, enriched with fair Fountains, the playn was very considerable, for the great num∣ber of Springs and Rivers, which running through it, at last met in a little lake, which was furnished withall sorts of fishes: there might you see all sorts of trees, as well Fruit-trees as others, and all the Fields enameled with Flowers according to the sea∣son; all accompanied with a World of Birds, who by their various Notes, rendred a continual Harmo∣ny both night and day. In this pleasant place was a Pallace built for the Prince 
Erastus,
 that he might be at some distance from the noise of the City of 
Rome:
 where he so plyed his study, that you could hardly distinguish whose affection was greatest, 
ither his in Learning, or his Masters in instructing him: and although he very well knew the greatness of his quality, yet however he esteemed of no other greatness, but that which vertue should instruct him in; in such manner, that he not only surpassed the hope which had been conceived of him: but he also astonished his Masters, because they could not reach him any thing but what he soon learne with advantage. He was excellent in all the seven liberal Arts: for, first he was a good Grammarian, by that means learning to speak properly and correct∣edly. By Logick he found out reasons to discern a false proposition from a 
ne one, he also profited so well in Rhetorick and Oratory, that by his well speaking, he perswaded what he pleased, & diswaded what he had a mind should appear ill: he was also a good Arithmetician, & ready to cast up any account: by Geometry, he not only understood the dimensi∣ons of the Earth, but also many other pleasant pro∣positions:

 as for Musick he could by his voice, make an entire and perfect Harmony; In fine he learned by Astrology, not only the course of the Stars, but also their influences, which foretel things to come: furthermore he had the knowledg of all things requisite to the perfection of man, in such manner that in ten years wherein he was under the tuition of the seven Phylosophers, he was not only a good Schollar, but surpassed in knowledg those Masters that had instructed him. Finally there did shine in him all the good graces as well of Body, as of mind, for he abhorred all Vices, and on the contrary, exercised all sorts of Vertue, passing his time in Disputations with his Masters: in which he took very much delight. About this time it was that the Empress his Mo∣the departed this life; and 
Erastus
 being adver∣tised of it, although he had as tender a love for her, as any Child could have for a Mother; yet nevertheless knowing that Death is a Natu∣ral thing, and common to all; and that all the Lamentations in the World will not restore life to those that are Dead, he spent but few sighs and tears upon her, but concluded with the Poet in this manner,




The glories of our blood and state,


Are shaddows not substantial things,


There is no Armour against fate,


Death layes his Icy hands on Kings,


Septer and Crown


Must tumble down,


And in the dust be equal made


With the poor crooked Scyth and Spade.


All heads must come


To the cold 
ombe.


Only the actions of the just,


Smell sweet and blossome in the dust.






CHAP. II.
 The Emperour 
Dioclesian
 being enduced by the 
Ro∣man Senate,
 took to Wife the Princess 
Aphrodi∣si
,
 who having heard speak of 
Erastus
 became en∣amoured of him, and acquainted him with her affection.


THE death of the Empress was almost insuppor∣table not only to the Emperour, but also to the People of 
Rome:
 by reason of the sweetness and good nature werewith the Princess was endowed; which caused her to be beloved of all, her funeral rite, being finished, and the grief of her death being considered not only at 
Rome,
 but in a manner throughout all the World. The Principal Senators

 and Councellors of the Empire considering the great loss the Empire should sustain if the Prince 
Erastus
 should dye before the Emperour his Father' and thereby leave the Empire without any lawful successour, and that it was necessary to perswade the Emperour to a second marriage, they therefore humbly represented the case unto him, and although he at first wholly refused their proposition: yet in the end: they so prevailed upon him, as to consent thereto; provided they could find him such a Prin∣cess as should equal his lately deceased Empress; the task was very difficult to be performed, so great were the beauties and virtues of the disceased, so that it was long first ere they could in all the world hear of any that was in every thing suitable to the Emperous desire, but at length they found a Princess who by common report was a most excellent Crea∣ture, and richly endowed, not only with the beauty of body, but also accomplished in all manner of Vertues, the f
me of her good qualities was so large, that the Emperour was enduced to be mar∣ried to her: and she being named 
Aphrodicia,
 arriving at 
Rome
 and the Emperour by her outward shew and appearance, believing she was a most ac∣complished Crerature, caused the solemnities of marriage to be performed, and they were celebra∣ted in such solemn and splended manner at the qual∣lity of the Emperour required; and although peo∣ple from all Parts resorted to 
Rome,
 to be specta∣tors of this pompious ceremony: yet the young 
Erastus
 made not one of the number, being of this Opinion, that let the pomp be never so great, yet it deserved not the loss of one hour from hi


 studdy, in which he had so well profited, that the renown thereof flew through the Universe, and he was not only renowned for these his virtuous ac∣complishments, but also for his outward Beauties and Courtesies, in which he surpassed all the young Princes of his time; this report arieving at the ears of 
Aphrodicia,
 (who was more fair then wise) she began too loosen the reynes to her desires, and so to possess her self with the love of the young Prince 
Erastus
 (whom she had never seen) that she believed it impossible to live long without giving some case to her disordinate appetite: whereupon considering with her self of the easiest way to ac∣complish her desires, and after several proposals to her self, finding that she could not attain her ends, without the help of some third Person, who con∣sidering the importance of the affair, should be both secret and faithful; she in conclusion resolved to serve her self with a certain slave whom she very much loved, and who was used to serve her in many private affairs: knowing him fit for her purpose, having caused him to come into her private apart∣ment, after many sighs and tears, she discovered her whole heart to him, expresly charging him as he tendred his life, to make no words of it to any per∣son, but to her beloved 
Erastus;
 telling him that she now required his assistance and not advice. The Slave having heard her discourse, although he was naturally more prone to ill then good, however con∣sidering the danger he should run into, he therefore 
t first endeavoured to divert the Empress, and diswade her from the, unlawful love which she had for her Son in law. But in the end seeing the obstinate pur∣pose

 of his Mistress, and again considering the large promises which she made him, he disposed himself, (let what would happen) entirely to satisfie the wicked desires of the Empress, who resolving to put her purpose into practice, began to prepare a Pre∣sent of ten shirts, very fair ones, as well in respect of the fineness of the cloath, as the richness of the embroidery; she also provided several other sorts of Linnen, wrought very curiously with flames of Gold and Silver, wrought so to the life that it seem∣ed to be true fire, intermixed with certain Letters which said, 
thus do I burn, for you and mourn.


She also provided a looking-glass made of a pre∣tious stone, which represented all things as lively as any other looking-glass of Christal or Steel; and was enchased with fine Gold, so cunningly wrought, and so artificially, that it every where represented love stories: these rich things being collected, she likewise provided perfumes and essences that should, be as agreeable to the scent, as the others were to the sight, and having locked them all up in a silver Cabinet, so richly wrought, that the workmanship was of more value, then the materials, she delivered all to her trusty Slave, charging him to carry this pre∣sent to 
Erastus,
 as sent from the Emperour and her∣self, and to recommend them both to him, expresly commanding him to acquint him that she herself had wrought most of these works, and above all to shew them to him one after another, presenting her most affectionat commendation, without forg
tting to de∣clare to him the grievous pain she endur'd for his love praying him to have compassion on her, and to find the means to come to 
Rome
 that she might enjoy the the fruit of her so much desired love.




The Slave being dispatched with his rich presents went directly to the Castle where Prince 
Erastus
 with his Masters resided; by fortune he found him alone in the Garden, contemplating on the secrets of Phylosophy: he rejoyced at his good luck, being of opinion that fortune had favoured him very much, in regard he found the Prince so convenient∣ly without Company, whereby he might have the conveniency to let him see peice by peice, the beauty and richness of his present, and to have leisure to discharge himself of his whole message; and al∣though the sage discipline of the Prince, and the great continence wherewith he was reported to be endowed, might cause him to desist from prosecuting his design; yet the gayety which he then saw him in, and his Age being so propper for love affairs, put him in hopes that he should perfect the desires of the Empress his Mistress; however being cuning and crafty, he purposed to manage the affair of her affections, as he should find the young Prince af∣fected to the beauty of the present which he brought him; being thus determined, having made his reve∣rence, he presented recommendations from the Em∣perour and Empress, telling him he was expresly sent to him, to visit him, and to bring him certain pre∣sents as a remembrance, which were for the most part wrought by the Empresses own hands; who did bear as much affection to him as the Emperour himself, and although by reason of her youthfulness she was not deserving of the name of Mother: yet nevertheless she did assure him, that she had as great an affection for him, or more then if she had bore him of her body; as in time she would make ap∣pear

 to him: and having opened the Cabinet, he took out the rich presents which the Empress 
Aphro∣disia
 had sent him: endeavouring to cause him to view them severally, but the young Prince not ha∣ving the patience to hear the Slave, & less to look on the presents, with an angry Countenance thus spake to him, if these presents come from the Emperour my Father, (which 
I
 cannot believe) I am constrain∣ed to say, that he is not of such Prudence and Ver∣tue as he hath been esteemed for: for does he not well know, that these Curiosities and Delica
es are direct contrary to the study wherein he hath em∣ployed me, and which I shall not forsake these Bawbles belong to Women and not to Men of his degree and quality. I hope his new wise h
 n
 altered the temper he was of; as I read of so
 Women, who have over-ruled wise and vali
 
: as for my part 
I
 shall not receive these presen
 by no means, therefore carry them back, and say to the Emperour my Father, that he must 
end me o∣ther presents, if he would have me accept of them; and say as much to the Empress, whom on my be∣half, you may thank for the good will which she bears to me; and that I may not be ungrateful to her, that I can do no less, but freely tell her, that it would more redound to her profit and honour, to govern her 
ouse well, then to loose so much preci∣ous time in these vain idle works, from whence she can reap no honour, but blame. The Slave being ravished with the great continence of Prince 
Erastus,
 and much more with his wise discourse, knew not what to say, and less what to do, for to carry back the presents he durst not, fearing he should highly

 offend the Empress his Mistress, and how to cause the Prince 
Erastus
 to accept of them, he knew not, but on the contrary he found he had no opportunity to discover the principal point for which he was sent: so that not being able to speak one word, he re∣mained as in a maze. But the seven Phylosophers came to him in good time, who having understood as well of the Prince 
Erastus,
 as of the Slave, all that had passed between them, having first commended the Constancy and Magnaminity of their Schollar, for refusing things so delectable to the eye, as being repugnant to their Phylosophical severity, yet never∣theless perswaded him to accept the presents which the slave said were sent as well from the Emperour as the Empress, that he might not anger or displease either, and this he at last though unwillngly assent∣ed to. The Slave being thus dispatched, entered into new considerations what he should do with the Empress, for to let her know the business in the ve∣ry manner as it had passed, he feared would put her out of her wits, and that he should be accounted an ignorant fellow, and knew not how to perform the charge that had been given him, and of which at the beginning he had given so good hopes: and ne∣ver the less seeing himself frustrate of all means to accomplish his desires, he foresaw that instead of great rewards which he hoped for (if the matters should take effect) there was danger that the Em∣press might doe him some mischeif, and having a great while considered what he had best to do, he in the end resolved to keep his Mistress in good hopes to get what he could from her, and keep him∣self in her favour. And now being come to

 her presence, he with a smileing countenance made his obeysance, and told her quite contra∣ry to what had passed between him and the Prince 
Erastus,
 assuring her that the Prince had received her present with very great affection, and and for a greater expression of love, had very amorously kissed every particular peice that had been present∣ed, & had expresly charged him to give the Empress a thousand thanks, and on his behalf to entreat her not to displace him from her heart until his return to 
Rome,
 which he would hasten as much as possible, and by all means to accomplish. The poor Princess giving credit to the Slave, and believing the loue of 
Erastus
 to be greater towards her, than the Slave had reported, having a good opinion of her beauty, did so enflame the fire which was al∣ready Kindled in her heart, that out of the abun∣dance of love, without regarding her degree and qua∣lity, she gave great presents to the Slave, to let him know how great an esteem she had for him, in regard of the pains he had taken in his late nego∣tiation, making him great and magnificent promises, if he should manage her affairs so as she might at∣tain to her desired wishes: and although the Slave had lost all hopes of performing any, thing by reason of the great continance which he saw in the Prince 
Erastus;
 yet nevertheless that he might gain some∣what on the Empress, he nourished h
r hopes with a certain issue of her design: in such a mnnner that this poor and too credulous Princess, seeing the sweetness of her desires too long d
l
yed, retired into her Cabinet, not permitting any body to accompany her;

 w
e
 casting her self upon her Bed, with scald∣ding sight c
lling on her beloved 
Erastus,
 and be∣
 overcome with these thoughts she fell into a 
 sleep; wherein she believed that her beloved 
Er
stus
 was come purposely to find her, whereupon 
h
 fi
e
ly cryed out, 
A
 my Life you are very well∣come wherein all my love, and all my good de∣pe
ds.
 A
 which cry all her Ladies and Dam∣sels came running, asking of the Empress what w
s the matter, who being awakened, and know∣ing what had hapned, answered, that having laid her self on the Bed to sleep a little, she had seen in a Vision; a furious Serpent, who leapt upon her to devour her, and she not having any way to defend her self had cryed out: the Ladies and Damsels, and other her Attendants replyed, that no gr
at heed was to be given to Dreams; and and to remove this Fancy from her, they began to sing and play on instruments, in which ex∣ercise they employed themselves till it was time to go to Supper.

CHAP. III.
 The Empress 
Aphrodisia
 writ a Love Letter to Prince 
Erastus,
 which he having read, tore in peices with anger, threatning the Slave to chastise him, if ever he again attempted to appear before him about any such affair. The Slave keeps the Em∣press in hopes, telling her the contrary to what had passed.


SUpper time being come, and the Empress being seated at the Table with the Emperour, she was more melancholly then ordinary, and took no plea∣sure in the pastime that was presented to her: but sighed so vehemently, that the Emperour took notice of it, and being troubled, asked her the cause of her sighing, to which she answered; that the remem∣brance of a horrible dream which had hapned about break of day, was the cause of her present sadness: and indeed she said true, for it was 
Erastus
 whom she had seen in this Vision, although she had told it to be a horrible Serpent; the Emperour then being willing to put this Fancy out of her mind, told her that she must give no credit to Dreams, being things without substance, that vanish away, whereupon she put on a mercy countenance, and entertained the Em∣perour as she was wont, until it was bed time, which occasioned more pain to this poor Princess, the Em∣perour for his part went to sleep, but the Empress

 could not close her eyes for thinking of her affecti∣on to 
Erastus
 being of opinion that her affairs ha∣ving had so prosperous a beginning, she should lose noe time or occasion to bring it to that end so much desired by her: and ruminating all the night on what means she should use to perfect her desires: sometimes she doubted that the Slave was insuffici∣ent, for an enterprise of so high a consequence; o∣therwise, she could not find any way possible to speak with 
Erastus,
 because he was at 
Rome,
 and al∣wayes accompanied with grave Phylosophers; whose doctrine she very well knew was contrary to her ap∣petite. In conclusion she resolved to speak to him by Letters and Presents, and so soon as the day be∣gan to appear, that night in the opinion of the Em∣press being longer than usual, she arose, and being retired alone into her Cabinet, she writ this Letter which followeth.


THE Empress 
Aphrodicia
 to her Friend 
Erastas
 health, I doubt not but these presents will astonish you, that 
I
 without respecting your grandeur, have bin so bold to write to you, without considering that 
I
 pre∣sent to your fair eyes a thing so ill dictated as these pre∣sents: and to cause your mouth so accustomed to all good learning, to read this Letter destitute of all eloquence: however, 
I
 have not forborn putting Pen to paper, be∣ing assured that your sublime spirit will measure my writeing according to the affection from whence it pro∣ceedeth, and that you will have a greater esteem for it, than if all the Oratory had been employed to assist me with Eloquence upon this occasion: for according to the Poet, 
Love hides many faults,
 and to tell you

 truly how it is: this God hath so fettered me that to obey him, I have been forced thus to write to you, praying you to receive and entertain it with a plea∣sant countenance, believing that it is not simply paper, but my self: who with all my affection am transform∣ed into it, and 
I
 wish I were personally present with you, assuring my self th
t I should enjoy the fruit of my de∣sires: which 
I
 hope are long by word of mouth to dis∣cover to you; for it is impossible that your knowing spirit should not be acquainted with the secrets of my heart, which is more yours then my own, for you are Lord of it, so as you will please to love that which with all her heart loves you. However if your temper cor∣responds to your name (for 
Erastus
 signifies amiable) 
I
 hold my self assured, that my recommendation shall be received, which nevertheless 
I
 present to you with all possible affection; and because 
I
 wondred at your ab∣sence at my Wedding with the Emperour. I therefore pray you to take occasion to come and see me, that you may let the World know that you are not dissatisfied with my alliance: in doing whereof which 
I
 entreat of you you shall hear openly by word of mouth the rest of my secret which only tends to your profit, honour, and greatness In the mean time to testify the perfect love which 
I
 bear to you: I send to you the most preti∣ous things which 
I
 have, being certain jewels which you shall find to be singular, not only for their beauty, and richness, but also in regard they are peices of antiquity, which my late Father gave particularly to me, being the preciest things he was Master of: and therefore 
I
 send them to you, as better deserving to en∣joy things so rare, desiring you to accept of them with

 my heart, And as you have the report to surpass i
 every thing all other men, that you not only permi
 your self to be overcome by the force of a simple woman but let her know that your love is more ardent then hers if it were possible. 
I
 wish you good health.


This Letter being written and sealed, the Em∣press wrapped it up in fine cloath of Gold, with many Jewels, Pearls, Diamonds, Safers and many other pretious stones of inestimable value, and en∣closed all in a Cabinet of fine G
ld, which she deli∣vered to her faithful slave: charging him to carry it to 
Erastus,
 advising him to find him alone, and ac∣company the present with speeches, proper to the intent of his message; and the slave might perform this voyage with the more bravery, she presented him with a horse, and a good some of money.


The Slave thus dispatched, in short time arrived at the Pallace where Prince 
Erastus
 studyed: where by good Fortune he found him alone in his studdy, and as to the matter of the present delivered his mesage as the Empress had commanded him, without pro∣ceeding further, but only to bar
 r
commendations from his Mistress, forbearing to deliver the rest of the message, until he should understand how the Prince would accept of the p
e
ent, being of the opinion that it would be imp
ss
ble for a Prince of his age to sl ght such pretious Jewels as he had brought; but 
Erastus
 having considered the rich∣ness of the present, began to consider what might be the cause of the great liberallity of the Empress, in regard that all women are naturally covetous. But having found the Letter and read the contents

 of it, he presently had some suspition: although he could not absolutely believe love to be the cause: but however in great anger he tore the Letter into prices, and sound
y rat
ed the slave, forbidding h
m upon his life never to come into his presence, and that he should carry back the Jewels to his Mistress, and use his endeavour to diswade her from her dis∣ordinate humours. The slave being much troubled returned back to 
Rome,
 and in his way thither, he considered that if he should acquaint his Mistress of the truth of this affair, his profit would be at an end, and therefore being come into the presence of the Empress he spake thus, Madam, I do assure you that I have full and according to your intention, ex∣ecuted the charge which you were pleased to give me: and that the Prince 
Erastus
 is wholly at your dispose. True it is, that not thinking himself wor∣thy of the great present which you sent him, told me that your love was sufficient, without depriving you of so great rarieties & therefore he hath return∣ed them, only keeping the Letter, which he read over and kissed more than a thousand times in my pre∣sence; and he would willingly have returned an an∣swer; but that he doubted his Masters would return presently and surpr
ze him, wherefore he in short told m
 that he would suddenly come to 
Rome,
 where by word of mouth he would give you full sa∣tisf
ction: beseeching you in the mean time to con∣tinue your good opinion of him. The Empress was highly contented with the slaves discourse, how∣ever she was somewhat dissatisfied, for that her pre∣sents had been return
d without any litteral answer, but being blinded by her passion, she absolutely

 beleived the slave, and therefore rested content∣ed her self, and highly contented him, by great riches, which she gave him earnestly, expecting the arrival of 
Erastus,
 but thinking his stay to be very long and passionately desiring his company, she devised to hasten him by the Emperours com∣mand, and therefore she sollicited him to condis∣cend that 
Erastus
 might come to 
Rome.






CHAP. IV.
 The Empress 
Aphrodici
 perswades the Emperour, to cause 
Erastus
 to come to 
Rome,
 where by his command great preparation was made for his entertainment.


SOON after this the Emperour and Emperess being in 
ed together, she began to speak of the Prince 
Erastus,
 highly commending the means which the Emperour had used, to provide Masters for him, that were so excellent as the seven Phyloso∣phers: to render him perfect in all things, and wor∣thy of the the g
eat Roman Empire, which Nature had provided for him; being as she said very joyful of the grea
 g
d and profit which the Prince had attained by his study, and of the advantage which all the World would receive by mean
 of his per∣fections, but that she had been somewhat troubled why the Prince was not present at the solemnity of her nuptials. Whereunto the Emperour replyed, that the youthfulness of the Prince, was the cause lest in an age which was inclined to pleasure, the

 pomp and delicacies which he might see at the so∣lemnitly more than at another time, might distract, divert him from the study of Philosophy, in which he not being sufficiently grounded, all the pleasures which he might take, should turn more to his disad∣vantage than true content, if he should place his af∣fection on the pleasures that would be presented to him at 
Rome:
 and it was to be feared, that instead of the go
d affection he had to his study, he should be debauched, as it would be difficult to reduce him to that agen, wherein he well profited, that there was great hopes he would in time, be so great a pro∣ficient in all vertues, as to arrive at the highest per∣fection. All this discourse of the Emperour only served as fire and flame to consume the poor Em∣press, who already sufficiently enflamed with the love of the Prince 
Erastus.
 Whereupon taking the opportunity of this discourse of the Emperours to obtain her desires, she thus replyed to him: where∣fore 
ir, do you permit these great vertues to be hid∣den? and to what end is it, that your Son (for I love him as well as you) hath so well profited to r
¦main alwayes in an obscure place where his vertue is unknown; wherefore do you not cause him to come to 
Rome,
 where there is so many wayes to employ his perfections, for in the f
st place he will see how affairs are mananaged, he will make himself known as the Senate and People, and by that means will encrease the esteem that every one h
th for you, not only for the good usage which they have under your government but also for the great foresight w
h they shall see in you, for having provid
d for them a Prince well instructed to keep them in peace after your dis∣cease.

 The good Emperour hearing his Son thus commen∣ded, and being in a manner ravished with joy of a fatherly love, thus answered the Empress. 
I
 assure you Madam, 
I
 have often had it in my thoughts to do what you advise me to, and do now purpose very suddenly to cause my Son 
Erastus
 to come to 
Rome.
 The Empress hearing this and seeing her affairs in so good order, ceased not till she had brought them to perfection: so that the Emperour promised the next day to send to the Phylosophers, to know if Prince 
Erastus
 might come to him without prejudice to his Studdy; letti
g them know that if what was reported of the Prince were true, he might come without any danger. The n
xt day then for th s pur∣pose he dispatched a Gentle-man, one of the most considerable persons of his Court who being ar∣rived at the Palace of Prince 
Erastus,
 delivered to the Phylosophers what he had in charge from the Emperour: enjoyning them to accompany the Prince 
Erastus
 to 
Rome,
 so as they were assured he was Master of those perfections as was so much de∣sired and reported of him. The Phylosophers un∣derstanding this, they conducted the Embassadours, (who was a wise Gentleman) to the P
ince 
E∣rastus,
 and having in his presence examined him upon several points of Phylosophy, to whom the Prince made very pertinent answers, and moreover disputing with him the most subtilty that they could in all manner of Science; the Phylosophers there∣upon said to the Gentleman whom the Emperour had sen
, that he might boldly assure his M
jesty, that Prince 
Erastus
 h
s S
n, was one of the wisest you
g men that could be found in all the World;

 and that they purposed in order to his Fathers com∣mands to wait on him the next day. The Gentle∣man being very joyful of this news, and of what he had seen, being arrived at the Court, gave the Em∣perour an account of his Embassie, who could not contain himself for great joy to hear that the Vertue of his Son was no less than report had given out: but above all the Empress 
Aphrodicia
 understanding that the comming of her dearly beloved 
Erastus
 was so nere, she knew not how to moderate her present joy. Upon this account, the Emperour caused the Senate and all the M gistrates and Officers of 
Rome
 to assemble commanding them to be ready the next day to meet his son 
Erastus.
 This being n
ised a∣mongst the people every one began to make prepa∣rations, and to provide for the greatest feast that had for a long 
 b
n in 
Rome,
 the horsemen were ready to accompany the triumphant Chariots which went to meet the Prince with all sorts of instru∣ments for such a n entertainment; so that there was no corner of all 
Rome
 but what was filled with joy, this young Prince being desired of every one, but more especialy of the Lad
es, & above all by the Em∣press, to whom the night seemed to last a thousand years by reason of the great desire she had to have a sight of him, of whom she was so much enamoured withal, having never seen him.








CHAP. V. Erastus
 foresaw by the course of the Stars, that in his voyage to 
Rome,
 he should dye a shamful death, having no other remedy but to remain seven dayes without speaking. The Philosophers his Masters obliged themselves respectively one by one, to pre∣serve him from all harm, during those seven dayes.


THAT very evening whereon these preparations were made at 
Rome,
 for the entertainment of Prince 
Erastus,
 he being walking in a Garden, had a mind to see the cause and influence of the Stars; the good or ill fortune that should happen to him in his Voyage to 
Rome,
 and beholding the Heav
ns, and 
he Aspects of the Planets, he was perfect in the Sci∣ence of Astrology, and who p
rfectly know the course of the Stars, and the significations o
 the Aspects of the Planets, knew by one Star his going to 
Rome
 would in few day
s be the cause of 
 and ignominious death; whereupon not out of the consideration of death to which he knew all men were subject, but for the shame which he should suf∣fer, he began to complain and lament so highly that all the Philosophers (being amazed at it, as at a thing which they had never seen in him) ran to see what was the mater with this young Prince, to whom





top: representation of a eight male figures, seven wearing hats, looking up at the stars; bottom: representation of two armies on horseback facing each other






he sighingly thus said, do you not see the dispositi∣on of the Stars, and with what they threaten me, as for death I value it not, although 
I
 am in the prime flower of my age, being assured th
t in few years, 
I
 must leave this world according to the course of Nature: but I am troubled at the shameful man
r of my death, that I am to suffer, and of the inf
my and ignominy that I must endure, which i
, th
 which troubles me more then ordinary, I pray c
n∣sider this malign Star a little, and with w
 
se∣rable end it threatens me, in this my v
y
g
 to 
Rome.
 The Philosophers being tro
bled a
 w
a
 their young Master had told them, began to consider the order of the Stars as they were at that instan
 and to judge according to their aspects, and confu
∣ed about the malevolent Star which their wise Master had shewed to them, and having e
ect
d 
 Scheme, and calculated the revolutions of the H
¦vens, they found that what their Schollar had 
 was certainly true, and the effects of an eccl
 which had lately hapned, did demonstrate then by the concurrence of certain malignant Plan
t
 which appeared to the present sight, that Prince 
Erastus
 went to expose himself to a death, the most ignomi∣nious that could be imagined; whereupon looking upon one another as lost and undone men, not ha∣ving the power to open their mouthes and speak one word, they were so fully possessed with grief, be∣cause there was no way to
rd the voyage of the
 young Master, by reason things were so far gone that the next day he was to make his entry int
 
Rome
 & that in pursuance of this voyage, they fore-saw an infamous death not only to their schollar, but also to themselves,

 being thus at a loss, and not knowing what to say, and less what to do; the wise 
Erastus
 having well examined the revolutions of the Heavens, and the Aspects of the Stars, thus began to say to them, what do you think my Masters, there is but one only re∣medy in this, which depends upon the influence of this Star, which you see is in opposition to that which threatne
h me, by which I comprehend that if I can remain these seven next ensuing dayes with∣out speaking to any person whatsoever, the malig∣nity of this influence will pass over, and I may a∣void the infamy wherewith I am threatned by these S
ars: as for my remaining without speaking, I shall take eare in it, but all the difficulty remaines to find the means to resist during these seven dayes to the violence that shall be used against me, and the cruel threatnings that a Person of very great power during these seven dayes, shall practice against me: the Phylosopher having heard this, and truly know∣ing that their young Master had understood the truth thereof better than they: they told him that if he had the heart, and resolved to keep silent for seven dayes, (which they thought impossible in regard of the great violencies and ignominious usage, that he must suffer, wherein it was impossible for any man to pass by in silence) that they would undertake to preserve him from death for those seven dayes, for there was none of them, who by a divine excellence wherewith they were respectively endowed, that could not superceed not on
y for one day, but for a longer time the execution of the most criminal and wicked man in the wo
ld, and therefore they un∣dertook to defend with much ease the innocency of

 their Master: so that each of them took the charge to preserve him from death, and defend him by turns each of them one day in such manner, that the plea∣dings of those seven should not be finished, u
til the malignity of the influence of the stars should he passed over: and there upon they all promised a
d swore to the Prince 
Erastus,
 who thus reply
d 
f you think to perform what you have pro
sed, let us boldly goe to 
Rome,
 for the maligne infl
nc
 
 the Stars will have their effects as well in any 
h
r place as at 
Rome:
 where upon they all promi
 
 defend him respectively every one his day 
 the other side, the young Prince 
Erastus
 hav
 
 off all fear, promised to keep silence f
r th
se 
 dayes; the day being then come, they b
gan their journey towards 
Rome,
 with a firm resolution to vanquish the malignity and conjuration of the Hea∣vens by the means aforesaid.








CHAP. VI. Erastur
 being arrived at 
Rome,
 put the Emperour his Father, and all the People of 
Rome
 in great trouble by reason of his silence. The Empress 
Aphrodi∣cia
 caused him to go into her Chamber, underta∣king to cause him to speak.


THE Emperour having given good order to all things requisite for the entry of his Son, accom∣panied with many Princes, and Barons, that went to meet him: to set down here the great Nobility that were assembled at this entry, the rich Habits which were worn on this occasion, and the Arches, and triumphant Chariots, it would be superfluous; for you may be assured that all was done that a Roman Emperour could do; to honour the entry of a per∣son so worthy of respect, as his only Son, and that nothing was wanting on the other side, in the ap∣pearance of the people, who was as well pleased as the Emperour, every one to his power endeavour∣ing to doe honour to him, who was to be their Prince after the death of the Emperour; and there∣fore you might see people from all parts in their richest and best equipage, who all accompanied the Emperour, to receive the Prince 
Erastus:
 the Em∣press for her part earnestly expected him, who re∣mained in the Pallace, accompanyed with a great number of Princesses, Ladies, and Damsels and you may be sure that she omitted nothing that might en∣rich her natural beauty, that she might have the stronger hold on the heart of 
Erastus,
 who then beg∣an

 to enter the City of 
Rome,
 whither he being come, he was met at the Gate by the Emperour, who kindly embraced his Son, asked with a pleasant countenance of his good health, and what he thought of the Senate; the Nobility who were come to meet him: The good old man hoping that his Son would make a pertinent answer according to the great wisdom that was reported of him; but 
Erastus
 remembring what the Heavens threatned him, and of the silence he was to keep, to avoid the malignity of the caelestial influence
, an
wered not one word, which occasioned great trouble, not only to the Em∣perour, but also to the Senate, and the whole Nobi∣lity; for they had all great fancy to hear him speak, expecting what he should say, would be so much to the purpose, that every word would be a sentence; the Emperour then being moved with anger and in∣credible sorrow, with a troubled and angry counte∣tenance, demanded of the seven wise Philosophers, if this was the wisdom and great perfection which they had caused him to believe his Son was endow∣ed with; saying that he was compleat in all things, and what doctrine they had taught him not to an∣swer his Father being an Emperour, what Philoso∣phy is this quoth the good Emperour? in what 
A∣ristotle
 or 
Plato
 have you found the doctrine? for in∣stead of being wise, and well instructed as you in∣formed me, every one sees that he is ignorant, a Sot, and without understanding; but I assure you by the words of a Prince that ye shall be punished accord∣ing to your deserts. The Philosophers seeming to be as much surpriz'd, as the rest to see 
Erastus
 thus mute said to the Emperour, know Sir that we have not

 informed you Majesty any thing touching your Son, that is not true, so that here is not any Phi∣losopher modern nor antient to whom he may not be compared: Being as well or better taught than any man whatsoever of this age; to tell you where∣fore he is at this present mute we know not, but we can well assure your Majestie that it is not done without great cause, which nevertheless is unknown to us, for being Master of so much knowledge he well enough knows when he ought to speake, and wh
n 
o h
ld his peace. But let the Philosophers s
y w
 
h
y would the Emperour could not be appe
s
 but being transp
r
ed with anger, h
 re∣p
, 
 
Erastus
 c
uld have no reason to be 
 in his p
ete
ce: And thus being both angry 
 S
n in this condition he left him 
 
ed wi
h the Nobility that accompanied 
 Th
 E
 ss hearing the noise of horses went 
 meet the Emperour, being attended by all her 
ye
 
nd the 
Roman
 Princesses, and having under∣
o
 from him the small satisfaction he had took in seeing his Son and she beholding Prince 
Erastus:
 To whom she was e
slaved, without having seen him & considering with her eyes that his beauty was beyond compare greater 
hen report had given of him, she became wholy en
moured of him & there∣fore with a merry cheerfull countenance she went to him, and having very amorously embraced him, she began to reason with him of many matters, but the young Prince made her no answer, whereupon the Empress was astonished, yet however the fire that consumed her did not at all diminish, but on the the contrary encreased, in such manner that not be∣ing

 able to resist the violence of love which co
∣strained her, she tooke occasion upon the Princis silence to encrease the flame of her disord
nate ap∣petite; and thereupon went towards the Emperour to whom she declared, that every one very well knew that the silence of his Son, was not because he was naturally mute as might app
are by what the Gentleman related, who came fr
m 
Eras
us
 
u
 the day before: who affirmed that he had heard him dispute so ingeniously with his Masters, t
at he rather judged him to be Master than the Scholler; and therefore, they might conclude that this silence was caused by some accident, which she would un∣dertake to discover and remedy, having the young 
Erastus
 in her power, in a place where they might be alone. The Emperour believing what the Em∣press said, was out of a good will to his Son, (not in the least suspecting her loyalty) and being very desirous to discover the cause of his Sons silence and to give a remedy thereto: He presently c
ma
ded that Prince 
Erastus
 should be led to the Chamber of the Empress, and that they should be left alone, the Empress seeing all th
ngs to fall out according to her expectations was very joyfull: And promi∣sed the Emperour that she would use such meanes that his Son should speake, 
n the other side, the young Prince foreseeing the great attempts that should be made upon him, was fearfull left he should be enforced to breake his resolution: Neverthe∣less being resolved to vanquish the malignity of the stars by a strong and firm constancy, he went cheer∣fully to the Empresses Chamber, where in short time we may see by experience that hatred prevails more than love in the hearts of Ladyes.








CHAP. VII.
 The Empress 
Aphrodicia
 being shut up alone with Prince 
Erastus,
 endeavoured all she could to in∣duce him to her appetite, but seeing her self refused and disdained she made an outcry that he would h
ve fo
ced her, by which meanes the Prince was m
de Prisoner and condemned to Death.


THis cruell Tygress seeing her prey taken in the toyl
 
 thou
 losi
g one moment of time, 
 to her Chamber, where being come she look∣
d her self 
 and having taken the young Prince by the hand she caused him to sit down by her and c
lli
g her arme about his neck she embraced and k
ss
d him in a different fashion then what a mother u
es to her Son, in fine, after many kisses and em∣braces, she asked the cause of his silence, which held the Emperour and all the 
Roman
 people in so great trouble; who in honour of him had caused his entry to be so magnificent. She told him that every body had cause to thinke it strange, that having lived a long time without seeing the Countrey, his Father, nor friends, being came thither he did so apparently sl
gh
 them, being a thing unhandsome in any person of understanding and much more in him, who had bin accounted so discreet. In this time the young

 Prince fixed his eyes on the ground, without one word of answer, knowing that to be his critical minute of holding his peace. Whereupon the Empress being a∣stonished; she agen threw her self about his neck, giving him an infin te of kisses; but the more amorous∣ly she behaved her self, the less regard he took of her: The Empress seeing this, spake to him in these terms. What disdain is this, or what other accident can have happened to you, to cause you to be mute; why do you not speak to me, what do you fear, remove all fear, and tell me the cause of this silence, and let me alone, for I will carry it so, both to the Emperour; and all the world, that every one shall be satisfied, without imputing anything to you; and if you have resolved to be silent to all others, wherefore do you deny to speak to me, to me who am so ravished with your love, that I can enjoy no rest but when I think on you and now I see you, and have meanes to speak to you, I should be to happy, if this unlucky silence did not at this time hinder me: If you are beautyfull be not therefore cruell; and if you are wise as report g
ves out of you, wherefore do you grieve your fa∣ther, & all the world; if you have any discretion, know who loves you; if you are young, I for my part am in the fl
wer of my age; if you are fair, I do not believe that th
re is any woman in 
Rome,
 that can equall me for beauty? What should hinder then from reaping the fruit which is prepared for you; is that according to what you sent word by my slave, is this the effects which I hoped from you, where are now the great promises which you made me. Oh! how much better had it bin for me to have believed my self loved by you, when you were absent, then to see my self slight∣ed now you are present & that you may know all, it is I

 only that have occasioned your voyage to 
Rome,
 to have the opportunity to see you and discourse with you, and now I finde that you despise me, wherefore do you not speak to me, and why do y
u not remove your eyes from the ground to look on me: Be assured that I will kill my self, for I dye if you do not help me, alas my dear it is easie for y
u to help me, 
I
 beseech you then do not deny me, and I assure you by the word of a Princess, that none shall ever know of it: Wherefore are you so cruell towards her, who loves you dearer than her own life; and if my kisses and embraces, and my ardent prayers will not move you, at the lest behold my two eyes, which now serve me only as two fountains, and let my poor heart move you, which for your sake burne
 in a continuall flame: Is there any rock or marble that will not hearken to me? Or any steel that would not be softened with my speeches? I thought I might have molified the most savage and the most cruell beasts in the converse; in fine, I thought I might have overcome all the world, and you alone make no reckoning of me: Remove, re∣move this Ice which thus freezeth your heart, 
I
 beg of you not thus to despise me, me who dye for you; I lose my speech, alas my heart failes me, behold me at your feet beging of you to relieve me, at least with one word, be it what it will, and that if 
I
 can receive no other; shall very much content me. These were the words of the Empress, but let her discourse be what it would, Prince 
Erastus
 took no notice of it, whereupon she being desperate, began to sigh and Curse her fortune, which had forced her to love one who would not regard her: and nevertheless resolv∣ing,

 let what would happen, to have her will with this young Prince; seeing perswasions would do no good, she thought to use force, but he knew well enough how to defend himself from that; for although speech wa
 prohibited him, yet he might guard himself from violence, whereupon the Empress began to be so outragious, seeing her self so refused, 
hat changing the unbridled love which she bore to Prince 
Erastus,
 into a mortall hatred, she thus spake to him. 
I
 am resolved that you shall per∣forme my pleasure in despight of you, or I will 
ea
 my Clothes, and do violence to my self, and with loud Clamours I will accuse you to the Emperour, that you would force me, and then the small esteem that you have for me shall bring you to an Ignomi∣
ious death! Therefore choose one or the other, for 
I
 am resolved no longer to be thus abused by you. The young Prince hearing the speech of the Empress, and not knowing what course to take went to the Chamber door, and began to flye, but the Empress tearing her Clothes and pulling off all her head attire, striking her head and breasts, with her fists, and running after young Prince 
Erastus,
 cryed out aloud Help, help, seize on him, seize on him, let not the Traytor escape you. Oh me wretched woman! Oh how is my life accused! Come quick∣ly, my Lord and Husband, come quickly I beseech you and stay not; behold the wickedness and Trea∣son of your Son, who would have forced me, behold how the wretch flies because he could not have his will on me; See, see, the good doctrine which the Traytors hath learned, not to vouchsafe to speak honestly to you, and without shame to aske that of

 me, which is not Lawfull for to speak or think of, and indeed he would have forced me; come then and revenge me, and your self also, of the great out∣rage which this wicked one (who never was your Son) would have done to me: For if he had ever in the least belonged to you, he had never had the heart to think, much less to do an action so wicked. The Emperour who had run with the greatest part of his Princes and Barrons at the cry of his wicked wife; having hard what she said, and seeing his Son 
Era∣stus
 making hast all pale and trembling, being moved with great anger, comanded him to be seiz∣ed on, and put in a dungeon; absolutly believing the case to be such, as his disloyal wife had represented it: The poor young Prince, was suddenly taken bound and manacled, very strictly without speaking one word for defence, or excuse, but was in a manner confounded, as it happens to those who are surprized in a wicked action, which being seen of every one, all the world was of oppinion that he was guilty, of what the Empress had accused him; and therefore there was none so bold as to open their mouths for poor 
Erastus;
 but they had all great compassion for his fact, for he was secured in the strongest and obscure Prison in all the Castle. The Empress on her part required speedy justice a∣gainst him: In persuance whereof the Emperour re∣solving to be revenged, not only for the outrage done to his wife, but also to himself; and that he might let the people know that he had a heart e∣quall, to the Emperours his predecessours; not to spare his own blood, in the execution of justice,: he therefore caused the Counsell presently to assemble,

 where taking his place, he passed sentence of death against his Son; comanding that within three hours he should be executed, with the most cruell and most Ignominous death, that could be imagined, the which sentence was pronounced, and intimated to young Prince 
Erastus:
 Yet nevertheless, although he plainly saw the injustice done him, and that it would not be very difficult to have sentence reward∣ed, and to Justifie himself, by relating all that had passed: Yet however being very well informed of the threatnings which the Star
 had given him, if for the space of seven dayes, he should speak one word; he chose rather to hold his peace, than to defend himself, depending upon the promise which his seven Masters had made him; whose knowledge and prudence was so well known and experienced, that although he saw himself in eminent danger of death: Yet nevertheless he had this hope, that they would easily stop the execution of this cruell sen∣tence, untill the malignity of the influence of the Stars should be passed over, which time being come he might freely speak, and defend himself against the guilt, and Ignominy; whereof he was accused. The sentence of 
Erastus
 was no sooner published in 
Rome,
 but in a moment, there was seen a very great alteration: For instead of their preperations of joy, for the entry of their young Prince; every one now hang down their heads, so that there was nothing but sadness, and melancholly throught all 
Rome;
 In the first place the poor Emperour, cryed and sighed; and with him all the Lords and Ladies, at the misfortune of Prince 
Erastus:
 In testimony whereof, all persons as well men as women, threw

 off their rich habits, which they had put on to honor the entry of their Prince; and instead of that, every one put on mourning aparrell; in the mean time the Officers of justice, began to provide in execute the sentence of 
Erastus,
 so that every where, all went with crye
 and 
eare, to see this cruell specta∣cle: But the seven Philosophers, who were met together in counsell, to advise about 
Erastus,
 con∣cluded that 
Euprosigorius
 should first begin, and or∣der the matter so with the Emperour, that executi∣on of the sentence should be stoped for that day, and that one day after another, every one should do the like, so that each of them, causing the execution, to be delayed for one day; the fatall dayes of 
Erastus,
 would in that time be passed over, and thereupon the good Philosopher disposed him∣self to go finde the Emperour.

CHAP. VIII. Euprosigorus
 the Philosopher, puts a stop to the exe∣cution of the sentence of 
Erastus
 for one day, by the example of a 
Roman
 Gentleman; who had kil∣led his beloved Dog, who had rescued his only Son from a Serpent that would have devoured him; giving too much creditto the speeches of his wife, who had told him that his son was dead.


THe Philosopher 
Euprosigorus
 being arived at the Pallace, saw that the Emperour was walking a∣lone in the hall; no person darcing to speak one word to him, yet nevertheless he entred with much free∣dom, and great confidence; But he was no sooner in the presence, when many flocked together after him, to know if he came upon the account of 
Erast∣us,
 and what would be the issue of it; before the Philosopher had the conveniency of making his reverence to the Emperour, he looked on him, with an angry and troubled countenance, and with a high tone demanded of him from whence proceeded that rashness and presumption, to dare to appeare before him, and more especially at a time so improper, and if that were the doctrine and instruction, which he and his Companions had taught his Son, to scorne to speak, nor answer to his father, and to solicite his Mother-in-Law to so dishonest an account,

 Nay; and to attempt to force her. But continu∣ed he, I promise you by the word of a Prince, that 
I
 will provide so sharp, and so examplary a Chastise∣ment; as well for you as for that Rascall my Son, that shall leave a perpetual memory, and shall serve as an example to posterity to cause them to take heed of Committing such felonies, toward their Lords or Princes: The Emperour having ended, the good Philosopher with a cheerfull countenance, and without the least appearance of trouble, thus answered; know Sir, that it is very ill done of any person, to Act any thing contrary to right justice, and more especially for those who are in publique imployments, and although your Majesty being endowed with great wisdom, may think that you have not erred, in your sentence against Prince 
E∣rastus;
 yet nevertheless 
I
 can boldly say, that it is impossible but there should be a fault, in giving so sudden a sentence; for every wise man ought dilli∣gently and deliberately to weight the cause, and to understand the fact very well before he proceeds to Judgment: And those persons who are fit to be Judges, ought principally to avoyd three things; that is malice, disdaine, and anger, as for the two first I shall say nothing at present, being assured that neither malice, nor disdain, did not induce you to denounce this rash sentence; but I may speak of anger, for it was that which caused you to pro∣nounce so severe a sentence; and certainly the Poet said truly




Anger by some termed Ire,


Springeth from the heart and fire;


Which, if quenched not in Season,


By the water of sound reason,


Right nor wrong, nor time nor place,


Can prevent its furious race.


All these disorders Sir, have possession of your Spirit, and have moved you to a certain impetious anger, in this so important a cause, and that meerly through the speech of a simple woman; although your Majesty is not ignorant of the little reason which an angry woman is Mistress of; who for the most part suffer themselves, to be transported by their passion without inclining to any reason; so that I am assured that no good can come of it, and if you do not change your mind, I doubt it will happen to you, as it did to a 
Roman
 Gentleman, who giving to much credit to his wives perswasions killed his only Dog which he had loved above all things; of which action at last, he too late, very much repented. What was this Gentleman said the Emperour, and how was the matter: I shall tell you Sir, said the Philosopher provided that in the mean time your Majesty will be pleased to stay the execution of Prince 
E
astus,
 so that ha∣ving heard me, if your mind shall alter, (as 
I
 hope it will) and the sentence not being executed, you may be at liberty to pronounce one more favour∣able, otherwise my desires will be in vain: There∣fore Sir if you please to stay the execution untill I have finished my discourse, and then you may do even what you please, not only with Prince 
Erastus,
 but also with me and my Companions. To this the

 Emperour agre
d although he did certainly, believe that nothing that he could 
ay should cause him to change his Opinion; yet in regard he had oftentimes took grea
 pleasure in his learned discourse, he was content to hear him; an
 commanded the execution of his Son to be d
l
yed for the present: The Phi∣losopher therefore taking up the discourse, thus began.


Some time since, there lived a Gentleman in 
Rome
 having but one Son, who bring desirous to have him well bred up as his only dear Child, caused him to be nursed in the house, and laid in his Chamber; the some Gentleman had a Dog which he had a very great esteem for, as well for his handsomeness as good properties, and he took much pleasure in him, as it was possible for any Gentleman to take in such a creature. It happened that there was a Tourna∣ment or running at Tilt, held in the publique Place in 
Rome;
 to which the Gentleman amongst others of his quality resorted: And no sooner was he gone but his wife also being as unadvised as many other woman, had a mind to go see the pleasures of this Tournement, and thereupon she went with all her Chamber-maids and damsells; and to their great misfortune the Nurse went to the Top of the house, from whence although she could not see, yet she might hear what was done at the Tilting, having only shut the Dog into the Chamber, where her Masters Son lay: This Gentlemans house being old and out of repair, there were many breeches in it even in the very room, where the Child and Dog were and that one of these holes, there at this time entered a great and horrible Serpent, which the dog

 seeing, and that he made towards the Cradle, for the natural love which these Creatures bear to their Masters, even to hazard their lives in their defence; he slew upon the Serpent, to keep him from hurting the Child: But the one was not more furious in assaulting, then the other was in defending, and the Dog and Serpent strugling together nere the Cradle where the Child lay they over turned it; so that the Child fell to the ground, but without any harm, for the clothes that were upon were by the tumbling now underneath, and the Cradle standing on the four pomells, the Child lay as safe and as well as it had done before it was overturned: the Dog being enraged as well at the wounds he had received of the Serpent, as at the wrong which he saw was done to his young Master, threw himself with great fury upon the Serpent, who knew well enough how to defend himself; however in the end, the dog re∣mained victorious and tore the Serpent in the cruel∣est manner he could imagin, so that he was all smeer∣ed with his blood.


Hereupon the Nurse coming into the Chamber to see how the Child did, she had no sooner put her foot within the door, but seeing the Cra∣dle topsie turvy, and the Dog all bloody, with out looking any further, and being very cer∣taine that he who had saved the Childs life, had killed him; she began to tear her Cloa∣thes, and with outragious cryes went to entry this sad news to the Childs Mother; who un∣derstanding of the death of her Child, fell into such a passion as any one would for do the loss of such a Child, and if the Nurse expressed her

 sorrow in tearing her cloaths, it is to be supposed that the poor Mother did not forbear doing the same to her flesh; not only she her self, but all the women of the house who had accompanyed their Mistress, encreased the lamentation, and made an in∣credible noyse with their great cryes and lamentati∣ons, not any of them having the wit to go into the Chamber, and see how it had hapned: but there they continued their out-cryes until the Gentle-man returned from the Tourney, to whom they all with tears related, not that which they had seen, but that which they had imagined by the Nurses discourse.


The poor Father hearing these sad tidings, more full of rage than tears, (for anger and sadness which are great passions had stopped his tears) went di∣rectly into the Chamber, where meeting the Dog and seeing him all bloody, gave absolute credit to what the woman had told him: and having his sword drawn in his hand, 
e smote the Dog with such fury, that off went his head, and after he had spurned him with anger: he began to curse his fortune, and lament his Son, using great threatnings towards his Wife and the other women of his house, for the little care they had taken of his Child; and being in despair, he went towards the Cradle, which he took up to see if there were yet any parts of his Child whole, but he found him well, and without any hurt, whereupon all the Family were highly contented, as you may judge: and yet they were all astonished in that they had seen the Dog so bloody, but as they sought about the Chamber, they saw the great Ser∣pent which the Dog had tore to peices, whereupon they conjectured that the blood that was about the

 Dog, came by reason of the combate which he had with the Serpent, in defence of the Child; which the Gentleman seeing, and being enraged that he had in anger kill'd his good Dog, he would have slain his Wife, and all the other Women of the house, who had been the cause of the Dogs death. Ah poor Dog said he, that thy friend-ship and loyalty have been so unfortunate to thee, to cause thy death instead of a recompence which thou didst deserve for so well defending my little Child. In fine, this poor Gentle∣man could not be appeased for the loss which he had caused of so faithful an annimal as his Dog was, so that every one that hard it, had pitty and grief for the Childs loss, was now converted into grief for the loss of the Dog; all which sorrow hap∣ned to this Gentle-man, for having given too much credit to his Wife, for if he had been wise, he would first have examined the matter, and accordingly have judged it, without entring into such fury, as to act a thing which caused perpetual sorrow to him with∣out any remedy. I shall conclude that this will be your case, if you give credit to the words of a sim∣ple woman, to put your Son to a Shameful death, whose cause being heard deserves rather praise than punishment and perpetual infamy; and therefore as your Majesties most humble servant, I advise you that laying aside all anger before you proceed further, you cause this action of your son to be consulted on, by wise & experienc'd men, such as wil be faithful to you, & that you will revoke this sentence, which your an∣ger hath caused you to pronounce. The Emperour took such notice of the Philosophers saying, that he commanded stay of the execution of the sentence,

 until he should take further order therein; and thus was Prince 
Erastus
 defended the first day.






CHAP. IX.
 The Emperor 
Dioclesian,
 by an example being induced which the Empress 
Aphrodicia
 related of a fair Pine-tree, which being old, is lopped, and then cut down to nourish a young one, which was ugly and crooked; commanded that Prince 
Erastus
 should be executed.


THE Emperour retireing when it was late, ac∣cording to custom found the Empress alone in her Chamber very disconsolate; which much troub∣led him, for he dearly loved her, and endeavour
d by all means to comfort her; but the more he essay∣ed, to please her, so much the more she sobed, so that the Emperour prayed her to be of good cheer, and that she should be satisfied: to which she reply∣ed, truly I have little cause to be contented, for the shall care you take to revenge so great an outrage, which hath not been committed against me only, but against your self; for upon this account you are as much injured as I am. It is true, I resent it more than you laying our honour more to heart than

 you, who however ought to shew it more exempla∣rily: as yesterday you made me believe you did, but I know not who hath so suddenly caused you to revoke your sentence, and I doubt to my great trouble, if you do not take more heed to your affairs, that it will happen to you, as it did to a very fair Pine-tree, which instead of being renew∣ed, was cut up and destroyed. What Pine was this said the Emperour, and what happned about it, to which the Empress answered. A while agoe there was a Gentleman of 
Italy,
 who had a very fair Garden, wherein he took so much pleasure, that he therein planted all sorts of Herbs, and Trees, and among others he had a very fair Pine, so fair and so strait as any could be in the World, so that this Gentle-man esteemed this Pine more than all the Trees in the Garden, and thereupon he there made an arbour, taking great pleasure to remain 
nder the shaddow of it for the most part of the day, whe∣ther he had a mind to read, or otherwise to pass the time. It hapned as one often sees among other Trees, that from the root of this Pine, sprung a sucker, which the Gentle-man seeing, being very much pleased at it, he commanded his Gardner to look carefully after it, hoping by this means to get an other Pine as fair as the former, and this young sucker finding the fresh Earth that was put about it, grew very well at the beginning, but being grown up so high that the branches of the first Pine kept the Sun from it: it did not grow so well as at the first, but became bent and crooked. The Gentle-man being troubled at it, asked the Gardner the cause, who answered, that the bowes of the great one,

 gave so great a shaddow, that the young one not having the Sun and air to make it grow strait up ac∣cording to its Nature, it therefore was crooked and did not thrive, whereupon the Gentle-man com∣manded to lop the old one, and take away the branches which hindered the Sun from the young one, so the old one was lop'd all away on one side. It hapned that this Gentle-man had a voyage to make for some moneths; but before he went, he re∣commended his young Pine to the Gardner above all things, in this the Gardner did not fail, so that the Sun coming to the young one, it grew again as it had formerly done, but however it still continued crooked; on the contrary, the great one began to wither on the side it had been lopped. The Gentle∣man at his return, seeing the great Pine half dead, and knowing that these two Pines hindred one ano∣ther, and that there was little hopes of the great Pine, in regard it was so decayed, caused it to be cut up, and thus was this Tree (that had formerly been so well beloved) destroyed for the young Pines sake; which although it grew to be a great one, yet it still kept it
 ill and crooked shape, which it had from the beginning: and thus will it happen to you, for having placed your Son, (if he may be called yours which 
I
 cannot believe) to the government of these seven Philosophers, you see in what case he is, they have already lopt you on one side, by the shame which they have caused you, and which is worst, being resolved to maintain and justifie it; you will in short time see a rebellion in 
Rome,
 and if you should pardon him for this out-rage in hope
 of his amendment, assure your self that ere long he

 will a 
empt against your life, as he hath already done against your honour, to arrive to the Go∣vernm
nt so soon as he can: and be assured that these Philosophers will put their helpin
 hand to it, in hopes that they shall have the management of the affair
 of the Empire, and so for want of fore∣cast, you will see your self ruined by your young sucker; 
I
 shall prevent it replyed the Emperour, for I promise you that justice shall take place, and at once to revenge your honour and my own; and there∣upon he commanded that without delay the sen∣t
nce of 
Erastus,
 should be executed on his Person.






CHAP. X.
 The Philos
pher 
Dimurgus
 caused execution to be stayed for an another day, by a discourse which he made to the Emperour of the great 
Hipocrates:
 who out of anger did stay without cause a Nephew of his that was an execellent Physitian.


DAY, brake was hardly come, when those to whom the execution of Prince 
Erastus
 was committed, d
d provide for all things necessary thereunto, without loss of further time, according to the precise command of the Emperour; in the mean time the Philosopher 
Dimurgus,
 who had un∣dertook to defend the Prince for the second day,

 lest he should be surprized, had bethought himself of all that he had to say to the Emperour, and so being ready, in the morning he came to the Cham∣ber, where by Fortune he found him coming out sooner, than ordinary, by reason of the great trouble he was in, both in body and mind, for the causes aforescited: and although the Emperour appeared to be angry, yet he being satisfied in the innocence of Prince 
Erastus,
 after he had made his usual reve∣rence, he took the boldness to say, Sir, having re∣ce
ved this favour of your Majesty, to be long since admitted into the service of your house: I ever knew you both of a rare spirit, and very well advised; whereby you have alwayes prudently governed the affairs of your Empire, so that I have alwayes ad∣mired the great vertues which did respectively shine in you; and a particular zeal which you alwayes had to do justice, so that I never knew you guilty of one unjust action. But considering you, by I know not what extraordinary disaster, to be about to ex∣ceed the bounds of reason, and to be diverted from your good and antient custom; I therefore made bold (not out of hopes of reward or praise) to come before you, not to counsel you, but to advertise your Majesty of a certain error, into which (as a man, and not as so great an Emperour as you have alwayes been) are now fallen; you know Sir, what you have purposed to do with my Lord the Prince your Son, by reason of a wicked perswati∣tion, which has been imprinted in your mind. But I humbly pray you, and that for the reputation of your honour, to suspend a while this your purpose, and to take my counsel, which being good (as in

 truth you will know it) you will prefer it before all that hath been said to the contrary; and be not angry Sir at my advice, for as the Proverb sayes, and you very well know it: 
He does deserve to be ruined that will not take advice.
 The Emperour having heard this preamble, and considered of what had been spoken by the Philosopher, was contented to stay the execution of his Son; however, intimateing to him, that if by good reason, he did not make ap∣pear that he was in an error, and that his defence of the Prince 
Erastus
 was just, that both the Advocate and Criminal should be hang'd one after another, to which the Philosopher consenting: he began to say,


Hipocrates
 the Prince of Physitians, had a Ne∣phew, with whom he took so great pains to instruct him in the Art of Physick, that in fine, this Nephew was in his Skil, Experience and Practice equal to his Uncle; it hapned that the Son of the King of 
Hun∣gary
 fell sick, and his destemper encreasing more and more upon him: all the Physitians of that King∣dom gave him over for dead; the King being troubled to lose his Son, was advertised that if his Son might escape by Physick, 
Hipocrates
 only could cure him, for this skilful Physitian was renowned through all the World; by means of his great knowledg, and having conferred with the Queen a∣bout the matter, who was also very sad for the sickness of the Prince her Son, and very desirous of his recovery, advised with all diligence to send Am∣bassadours to 
Hipocrates
 with great presents to in∣d
re him: besides far greater promises, which the said Ambassadours were charged to make him to

 come and cure the young Prince of 
Hungary,
 who without his help would unavoidably perish. The Ambassadors being come to 
Hipocrates,
 and having declared their charge and delivered their presents which the K
 g had sent which he kindly received, he thus answered, that he was as much troub∣led as the King their Master; for the desire he had to do him humble service, in regard that he could not go and therefore he entreated that his Majes y would excuse him, by reason of his inability in re∣spect of his great age, he being now decriped and diseased in his body, but however he would fully satisfie the desire of their Master, by an only Ne∣phew which he would send, who being very 
k
l
ul, being alwayes br
d up with him, and pr
ctised under him, in such manner that he knew him 
ffi
i
nt for this cure: and that there
ore that the K
g should not diseste
m him for hi
 youthfulness, for he should find him very able in hi
 u
d
taking. The Ambassa∣dor seeing 
Hipocrates
 not to be in a cond tion to tra∣vell and having a very good opinion of his Nephew took him w
th them and p
 ceeded so on the r jour∣ney, that they arived at the 
rt, where th
y were well received o
 the King and Queen, and that they might not loose time, the K 
g cond
cted the Physi∣tion to his S
n; But wh
n he had seen him and heard him spe
k knew by his 
 s g
ony and other signs that he was not the K
g
 S
n; and therefore be∣fore he would do any th
ng in 
rder to the cure, be∣ing desir
 u
 to be resolved of the doubt he had con∣ceived, he desired to speak with the Queen alone, whereupon being privately with her in her Chamber, he thus began; Madam if you please to tell me the

 truth of what 
I
 shall ask you, I will in short time restore your Son to his former h
alth, otherwise I can give you no ass
rance of it. The Que
n promised him with an Oath (so desirous s
e was to see he
 Son well) not to conce
l any t
ing th
t he should d sire of her.


Then the Physitian said, I d
sire only to know if the Father of the sick Child be here: to this the Queen 
nswered, do you think that any but the King is his Father; to this the Physitian replyed, since you are not pleased to tell me the tru
h, I
 will be gon and your Son will dye.


The Queen hearing this resolved (so as she might save her Sons life) to tell t
e Physiti
n that which she could not up
n any account l
t any Person in the world know, and having taken on Oath of the Physitian to be secret in what she should tell h
m, she blushing for shame thus began.


I
 would excuse my self but you are not ignorant of the sad condition that married Women are in who are Childless: for in truth that is their only riches and content: for the Husbands who can h
ve no Children of their Wives do hate them a
 
 it were her fault, and for this cause the poor Women are disdained, slighted, and ill used, and their Hus∣bands seek out other Women that they may have a Bastard to succeed them after their death.


This being my case having lived long with the King without any Child, and being therefore ac∣counted barren, and slighted by every one, I pur∣posed to know whether the defect was in me or my Husband; whereupon I having 
e
n the Miller come into the Cou
t to bring in C
rn to the Gra∣nery, and believing that to be a good oppertunity

 to execute my design, because the King was gone a hunting, and all my Women dispersed, some in one place, and some in an other. I caussed him to enter into my Cabinet, pretending to speak with him a∣lone, where he had to do with me, and that several times after, so that I perceived my self to be with Child, and that I might the better wier the matter, 
I
 caused the King to lye frequently with me, so that at the time o
 my Child-birth it was supposed to be the Kings Child, and so it is still, and after this I was better resp
cted of the King, and honoured by all: wherefore I pray you to save him which I got by such art to my great peril. The Physitian smile∣ing to himself answered, Madam, take no further care, 
I
 will restore your Son safe and sound: and thereupon after many remedies which he gave to the sick person, causing him to be nourished with gross meats, according to his natural constitution he be∣came well. The Physitian then seeing his Patient in good case, and out of danger, and that it was time to return, he took leave of the King and Queen who presented him with Gold and Silver, and gave him good and honourable Company to attend him to his Uncle; to whom he rel
ted every part
cular that had hapned, by which relation 
Hipocrates
 knew the great profit which his Nephew had made in so little time, for which cause, instead of takeing plea∣sure in regard he had so taught him, he conceived a mortal hatred against him, and doubting that the skil of his Nephew would deminish his renown, in regard he was to succeed him, and to possess a great many books, which 
Hipocrates
 had composed according to the great experience of his time which would en∣crease

 the fame of his Nephew, and diminish his own if his receits should come into his possession: he there∣fore purposed privately to kill him, and thereupon having caused him to come into his garden where he had all sorts of herbs, he demanded if he knew their several vertues, to which his Nephew answered, yes, he desired him to pluck up one of them which he named, and as the young man stooped to the ground not doubting any thing, the envious old man struck him between the head and shoulders with a hatchet, which he had hidden under his gown, and slew him at the first blow, and to conceale his cruelty, he buried him in the same place; where he had killed him. It hapned (as God is just and leaves nothing unpunish∣ed) that soon after 
Hipocrates
 fell sick of the bloody flux, so violent that no medicine could stop it. But 
Hipocrates
 to make tryal of his skil, caused a great, Vessel to be filled with water, whereinto he having cast a certain powder, he drew out several faucets wherewith the vessel was stoped in several places, to see if the water would come out, but the vertue of the powder had so restrained the fludity of the water, that it continued in the vessel, without one drop com∣ing out, as if it had been frozen, at which all the company were astonished, yet nevertheless 
Hipocra∣tes
 found no good in the flux of his belly, very well knowing that to stop it at once on a suddain, he should put his life in great danger, and therefore let∣ing it take its course, he hoped that nature would be assisting, yet he had great sorrow for the loss of his Nephew, very well knowing that if he had been with him he needed not fear any thing and then he repent∣ed of hi fault (but to late) he sighed and groaned

 alwayes calling out upon his Nephew, but seeing that all was in vain, he took it so to heart, that he ended his miserable life.


By this Sir you may judge of the rest of my dis∣course, which is this, that none o
ght hastily to doe any thing in anger, of which they should afterwards make it irrepai
able, with vain repentance, you have purposed to put the Prince your Son to death, not for any crime that he hath committed: (of which you can be ass
red) but at the report of another, but I say once agen to you: that you ought to think once and twice what you do, and against whom; be∣ing 
ss
red that if you do not suffer your self to be transported with anger; y u will in conclusi
n find your Son the Prince in
ocent of the fact, for which he hath been accused, and of which you at present think him culpable. The Emperour taking good notice of what the Philosopher had said, as well by reason of his speeches, as for the natural l
ve which he bore to his Son, ordered for that day a stay of the execution of the sentence of 
Erastus.

CHAP. XI.
 The Empress 
Aphrodicia,
 induceth the Emperour to the final execution of Prince 
Erastus,
 by a discou
se which she made of a Wild Boar, which was 
 by a Herds man, who pretended to flatter him.


THE Empress 
Aphrodicia
 certainly believing 
 the next morning her Son in law would 
 executed according to the Emperours command; and supposing that this loss would be some trouble to her husband, wherefore to take away the displea∣sure he should receive by the death of his Son, if n t wholly, yet in some Part she provided a magnif∣cent Feast to entertain the Emperour, and to po
s away his melancholly: for it was usual for the Em∣perour and Empress to feast one another, when they had a mind to pass the time away; so that sometimes the Emperour would feast the Ladies, the Empress at an other time treating the Emperour when she had a mind to pass over s me mel
nch
lly; dinner time being c me, the Emperour went into the Q
eens hall, where the table was covered, a
d being sate down, and the Empress by him, en
ring into discourse with her, he told her that f
r the good cause he had been advised to slay the exe
tion of 
Erastus
 for that day, which the Empress

 understanding all the good cheer was altered, and with her usuall disdain, and angry countenance, she said to the Emperour; I see Sir, you well shew the little esteem which you have for your honour, and if the faith you have promised me, and alwayes broken. But I hope that Judgment, and justice will shew you the great fault you want against them both; and I doubt it will happen to you as it did to a wild Boar, who was destroyed by flattery, which is a very good example and which I would relate to you, if I did not think it loss of time, whereupon the Emperour said; my dear, I have directly promised, and sworn to stop for this day, the execution of 
Erastus,
 and I may not in point of honour break my word and Oath: But I assure you that if some more important cause do not happen, I shall to morrow morning let you know that revenge which 
I
 know to be reasonable, is as pleasing to me as to your self; and therefore I desire you to let me know the story of the wild boar whereof you have spoken; for on one side, you will much please me, and on the other side, you will it may be make me more resolved then I was. Then the Empress began her discourse said.


There was some time since in a great and spacious forrest a large Wild boar who had no other feeding then the wild fruits which grew naturally without the help of mans art and yet however were very good, as well by reason of the fertility of the ground, as for the good temperature of the Climate, where they grew, among other trees there was a great wild pear-tree, whose fruit did very much please this wild boar; and therefore he came ordinarily thither, and shaking the tree with his shoulders, to make the

 fruit fall; having filled his belly, he would be gone to his Den. It happened that a Herds-man, that kept a herd of cattle at the entrance of the forrest, lost one of the best of them and believing that it was strayed into the forrest, as indeed it was, considering the diffi∣culty in finding it, be was troubled, but hoped to light upon it, he went to search in the forrest, but it was lost labour, & having spent some dayes in the forrest, & seeing that it was to no purpose; he intended to re∣turn, but in his way he came to this great pear-tree which I have spoken of; and seeing very fair peares, and being somewhat an hungry, he began to beat them down with his staff; he had no sooner tasted of them, but finding them better than he expected, he th
ught it would not be a miss, to carry some to his Master; that he might somewhat appease the anger, which he had against him, for the loss of the Bullock, that he might carry them without damage, he thought it best to gather them with his hand, and thereupon he climbed up the pear-tree, but he was no sooner got up; when the great Boar, which I speak of, came to the foot of the pear-tree, and began to shake it as he was used: The poor Herds-man seeing this furious Animall was afraid, and that he might be rid of him, he threw many pears to him; hoping that when his belly was full, he would be gone again as he was used to do, but it fell out otherwise, for the wild-boar seeing more victuals, than he was used to have; and that with less paines, he eat so many pears that he was ready to burst, and not being able to go back, he lay down under the tree: The poor Herds-man seeing this, was more fearful then before, for on one side, he was in great fear of the wild-boar, and

 on the other side, he fore-saw the danger, he should be in, of other wild beasts if he should stay all night in the forrest being thus reduced between these two in evitable extremities, he thought it was best to ch
ose the least; whereupon thinking of the nature of Swine, he began to come down from the tree, as softly as he could, and being so neer the wild Boar that he cou
d touch him with his fo
t, he clawed his back with the nailes of his foot, the wild Boar being p
eased with it, turned his belly upwards; and the Herds-man continuing to claw and scratch him, he fell aslee
: The Herds-man perceiving that, came down to the ground, and seeing this great Animal was safe, he resolved to make him more s
cure, and th
reup
n drawing out his knife, stuck it into his heart, thus killing h
m as he slept, by this means freeing him
lf from the fear of the wild Boar, and the other wild beasts.


The same m
y come to you: Sir, this lending your eares to these Philosophers, who being as fearful as this Herds-man they 
p
e and essay all meanes to de∣stroy you; the Herds-man had lost a Bullock, but these h
ve had thei
 h
n
ur; the Herds-man purpos∣ed to a
p
ase his Master with these wild pears, and these h
pe to escape the danger they are in, by fables and co
t
rfeit speeches; the He
ds-man killed the wild B a
, under pre
e
ce, of clawing & flattering him, the Phil
s
phers h
pe to do as much with you, having by 
h
 sl
t
ries laid snares for your life, hindering 
ou from d ing justice, and therefore Sir, look well to you b
si
e
s, for it is not the part of a wi
e man, to say 
f
e w
rds 
I
 did not think it.

 thus replyed: My love let me desire you to be merry, for to morrow morning, you shall be re∣venged and my self also of the outrages that have bin done to us, whereupon the Empress was merry, and contented.






CHAP. XII. Thernus,
 the Philosopher put a stop to the execution of the sentence of Prince 
E astu
 for the third day, by a discourse which he made to the Emperour, of an old Knight, who knowing that his wife had wild blood; and therefore could not contain her self within the bounds of reason, but she very often did him some mischief; he to tame her caused her to be let blood till she fainted: He perswades the Emperour to take the same course.


THe Philosophers being advert
zed of the promise, which the Emperour had made to the Empress, that the sentence against 
Erastus,
 should the next morning be put in execution; they advised among themselves to provide for the young Prince an advo∣cate for the next day, and therefore they empoured & gave the c
 
e thereof to the Philosopher 
Thernus,
 a man wi
; ready, & very advised in all his affaires, so that his name was proper, and correspondant to his actions; by break of day this Philosopher, went to the Pallace, waiting for the time to speak to the Em∣perour, and so soon as he heard he was risen, he

 went to make him his reverence, and although the Emperour beheld him with troubled countenance, and was very angry with him in his discourse, yet nevertheless he did not forget himself, but with much freedom, spake thus, Sir, you know me, and withal it is not unknown to you that my profession hath always bin to speak freely my Opinion, in those af∣fairs which I know to be of any importance, whither it be to my friends or strangers, for in all matters of consequence, where things ought not to be acted, being not rightly understood, or for any other reason I should not do well, if I should be silent. And there∣fore using this custome to others, I should be guilty of a very great crime; and should be worthy of as great punishment, if 
I
 should not use the same right, to him who is my Soveraign Lord, and who hath rais∣ed me to what 
I
 am: That I may not have this remor
e upon my conscience, to permit by my silence so dangerous an evil, as that which I see prepared, both against you and the Empire; I have not there∣fore been afraid to present my self before your Majesty; not regarding the threatenings, of those who being minded to direct me, told me that if I did on this act appear, before you, that you would cruel∣ly put me to death: But 
I
 knowing you to be a Prince; who will not slightly destroy any one, with∣out, first having heard what he can say; and 
I
 being very well satisfied in your goodness: And although it should happen otherwise, and that upon this oc∣casion I should lose my life, I shall not value it, for I know it is the Duty of a Philosopher, not to be a∣fraid to die for the truth, but rather therewith to be very well contented. Sir, 
I
 hope you will please to

 remember the great desires which you had for a long time, to have issue whereby to perpetrate the excel∣lency of your blood: Whereupon Nature was so favourable to you, that in short time you were provided of a Son, the most accomplished that ever lived he hath bin instructed in all things that are con∣venient for an Emperour; wherein he hath so well profited, that you may truly esteem your self to be the happiest father, that hath for along time lived; which felicity will turn to your prejudice, and per∣petual regret; if you suffer your self, in an affair of so high importance, to be over ruled by the Counsell of one simple woman; for although women have the use of reason, as well as we; yet nevertheless by reason of their imbecility, they suffer themselves to be so transported, by their affections; that very often they lay a side their reason, and are given over to their passions; this was not unknown to a certain Old Knight, who like you, had took a young wife, and if you had followed his example; your affairs had not been in so bad condition, as now they are. And what was it this Knight did said the Emperour? I will tell you Sir, answered the Philosopher; but I would not that during my discourse the Execution of 
Erastus
 should proceed, least if you should be sat
∣fied with what I shall say; it would then be two late, and therefore if you please, to put a stop to the exe∣cution of your sentence untill I have finished my na∣rative, you may afterwards, proceed as you shall think fit: The Emperour hearing this, although he was unwilling to deferre that which he had promised and assured to the Empress; yet however knowing that the delay would not be long, he agreed to the

 Philosophers request, but withall intimated to him, that if his discourse did not give him the satisfaction he expected; that he as well as the Prince, should suffer a shamefull death; I shall not value that, said the Philosopher; but with a pleasant countenance he thus began.


N t long since there lived in 
Tuskany,
 a very worthy Knight, who being rich and puiss
n
, and much a Gentleman; took no other care but to live merrily, k
p g
 
 c
mpany, and to treat his friends; some∣ti
 
ding his time in mannaging of armes, ri∣d
 
 
reat horse hunting; and sometimes at his 
. He kept an open house f
r his friends, and was m
ch plea
ed in feasting them, at his Countrey-h
use; which was as well bu
lt, and as commodious∣ly Sc
tu
ted, as any in all 
Tuskany,
 where he usually soj u ned: This Gentlem n having lived long, and m
 
ily without regarding to have any Children, he was 
ll 
r ken in years before he thought of marri∣age. I
 so 
ll out one day, that having good merry Company in his house after the table was uncover∣ed; from one discourse to another (as it is usual for Gentlemen to talk after dinner) they happened to fall upon this proposition, of the natural affection that men have, to have Children wher
by man 
e∣new
 his blood; and in a manner lives, after his dea
h in his po
terity, upon this discourse, some of this Gentlemans friends, p
rswaded him to marry, wh
r
by he might have Children, to inherit so many fair Ca
le
, and other riches, which he was possessed of. This Gentleman did not much regard it, but see∣ing himself importuned, sometimes by one, and then again by others; after he had sustained many assaults

 of his friends; he in conclusion resolved to please them as he had always done: His friends knowing his mind, took much pains to find him out a wife, fit for his quality, and by whom he might have Chil∣dren; and they used such dilligence, that in short time they betroathed him to a very fair young Damsell; who was daughter to one of the greatest Lords, of all 
Tuskany.


The wedding was solemnized, as you may sup∣pose, suitable to the quality of their estates, and al hough there was great difference in the ages, of this Knight, and his young Bride; yet however he was so Gallant, that his gallantry was enough to content, a Damsell, better than one that was younger; so that for a while, he and his wife, lived very contentedly: But after some time, this Damsell having understood, from other good wives, how their husbands treated them in the night, she began to wish for a young hus∣band, without regarding the gallantry of her own; rather wishing for a good strong back, than a gallan∣t
y accompanied with a feeble breath, and seeing that she could not have her desires, and that notwithstand∣ing all her endeavours, her husband as he grew more in 
e
rs; so he was less able to please her: After she had fasted one year, and knew that there was nothing in the house to satisfie her appetite; she resolved to purchase her victuals in an other place, but under∣standing that she was to make use of a third hand, and that in an affair of so great importance; there might be danger to discover it to a third person, she propsed to make use of her own mother, whom she thought had most reason to love her best, therfore

 she went to her, where being arrived, after many o∣ther discourses; she fell to the matter in hand, that which most a
gred her; letting her know, as well as she could; the necessity wherein she was, and the pur∣pose she had taken to provide otherwise for her self, that she might not dye, in that necessity, praying and conjuring her, for the natural love, which she had al∣ways born to her; that having pitty, and compassion on her, she would make provision against that evil, which would be her death if she had no remedy, and also to her honour; governing her self, after such manner in this aff
ir that she might find her self re-restored, and so as no person should know any thing. The Poor mother thinking of what her daughter had said to her, for a long time was amazed, not bring able to beli
ve her own ears; much less, to believe what she had heard; but in conclusion seeing by her daughters obstinacy, how the matter was; and that what she had said was true; she first of all tried, to direct her, from her wicked purpose, shewing her what offence she would commit puting her honor be∣fore her eyes; alledging to her, many other examples to this purpose, but all was to no purpose; for as to the offence, the young woman answered that the Law could not give her a greater punishment then death, and that continuing in the condition she was then in; she knew her death was sudden: As for the shame and infamy of the world said she, I come to take your advice in that particular; that my honour being sa∣ved, you may provide me with what you know may be necessary, upon this account, and for examples she had enough that served for her purpose, so that all that her mother cou
 say, to change her mind

 from this wicked purpose, was but to beat the aire; whereupon the mother was so troubled, that she thought she should be distracted. The young woman seeing this, began to colt's and flatter her, saying, Dear Mother, have compassion of my youth: You have been young, and therefore know well enough what are the desires of the flesh, which as I have al∣ways heard say, and now I know by experience, are greater, and more vehement in women, than in men; and although the fire is not so great in men, as in women; yet however, as often as they have a mind, and they know where; they give themselves the sa∣tisfaction they desire: But if we miserable women are sruprized but once, besides the shame we indure, they make no matter of killing us: So that for this cause, we other women, ought to put the change up∣on them, to revenge our selves of the shame, that men upon this account do to us. To this the Mother made several replyes, but all was in vain; for so much the more that the Mother endeavoured to turn her from her purpose; so much the more ardent, and passionate she appeared to be: Let what would happen to ex∣tingu
sh the fire which consumed her; she did cleer∣ly con
s
 that it would be more for her honour, to contain, than to abandon her self, but she could not imagin how she could live long so, and that therefore the fault should not be imputed to her, but 
o nature who did so constrain her; further entreating her Mo∣ther to consider of some way to give her content, and to save her honour, protesting unto her, that if she did refuse to assist her; she would hazard her life and honour, praying her once for all, to put all other oppinions out of 
 mind. The poor Mother

 seeing her daughters obstinacy, knew not what to say further; seeing on the one side, her daughter blinded with love, and so resolved in her purpose that it was not p
ssible to alter her mind, and on the other side, she well knew the great wrong, she should doe to her honour, in satisfying the appetite of her daughter: And although she well knew 
hat she lost time; however she thus made further trial of her daughter, saying, Ah! how stronge a thing is it that 
I
 see you purpose to violate the bounds of marriage; and count so great ill to your husband, who as you know, loves you as well: or better then any man can love a woman; and therefore I would not have you give such way to your appetite which I confess is great, but not so, but that you may over∣come it if you will, I have been young and as fair as you: and have experienced love affairs, and his fires; but however, I have resisted all with a constan∣cy, and firm res
ution to love like a woman of honour, so that I never wronged your father; and n
ver had tho
ghts 
or any other besides him, much less abandoned my le
f to any other; wherefore then do n
t you do the s
me And Mother reply∣ed the d
ughter, your consequence is nothing to the purpose, for when my father married you, he was a young gentleman, and as handsome as you, so that he m
ght well enough furnish you, with that which women desire above all things; and that you had no occasion to look further, and you had not done well, if you had done him that wrong. But my case is different, for the husband you have given me, may better serve for my father, then my husband; that he loves me 
I
 cannot deny but

 what does his love availe me, when he cannot furnish me with that 
I
 have most occasion for; I have endu∣red so long, that 
I
 cannot longer endure; and yet I have not discovered my self to any body but you, hoping as you are my Mother, you will have com∣passion on me, which I pray and conjure you to, assuring you, that if you do not help me, I will yet help where I can find it; let what will happen, for I had rather dye contented, than to languish in a life worse than death. The poor Mother seeing the ob∣stinatness of her daughter, for some time was silent, and then she said; Seeing you in this wicked purpose to abandon your honour to satisfie a base and dis∣ordinate appetite, rather then to see you fall into in∣famy which may happen; matters being not wisely ordered I am content to assist you, in what I may: Yet however, you ought well to consider one point, for although men keep but little loyalty for their wives, as you have said already; yet however they will not suffer them to take the same liberty; but the most part of men, doubting that they wear the hornes, they cut them off; sometimes by poison, sometimes with a Dagger, and sometimes with a sword: True it is that there are agen, some good men, who have a good stomoch to digest all; and all goes down as sweet as milk to them, though they find their wives in the very fact; Now 
I
 cannot Judge of what Complexion your hus∣band will be upon this occasion; therefore I think it absolutly conversant, to try his patience before y
u proceed further doing him some displeasure of little importance, which will be a tryal of him 


 it he takes it patiently; come and tell me, and I will take such order about you that, you shall be content∣ed, so as you keep your self to one man, for if yo
 should abandon your self to many; in the end it would be known, and bad would come of it to you, and to me also, though your husband were never so patient, so that we should both endanger our lives; fear not that said the young woman, for if I have had the heart to contain my self, a year with my hus∣band who is so old as you know without, looking out any further, although he was not able to content me; I shall be well enough pleased, when I may en∣joy him that 
I
 have thought of; who will give me full satisfaction to what I desire, and will be very se∣cret, being as much concerned as my self, to keep his honour; and maintain himself in the reputation, which every one hath for him. And who is this, said the Mother: It is our Curate, answered the daughter, who as you know is a young man, and accounted by every one, for a holy person, so that he may come often to our Castle, and none will have any bad op∣pinion of him; but on the contrary, all will have the more esteem for me, and so will my hu
band; who I have often heard discourse, of the good conversation of the Curate, with whom he will be well pleased, to see me converse; to keep me from other Company, which it may be, do not please him so well: And by what I have several times observed, it will not b
 very difficult, for me to work my ends, upon thi
 Curate; so as you being a third pe
son, will assi
t me, and I will have no assist
nce but yours▪ And therefore if you desire my life, and my ho∣nour, I pray take such order, as to bring us together;

 if not, I assure you that in short time, you will see me 
ore your eyes dead, or dishonoured. Be of good 
art daughter, said the Mother, and make trial of that 
I
 have told you; for if your husband does not resent the displeasure you shall do him, provided it be such as as he ought to be angry at, assure your self that I will render you content: Upon this the young woman being very glad, took leave of her Mother; longing to be at home, to make trial of her husbands patience, upon some considerable matter: She being come home, understood that her husband was gone on hunting, with other Gentlemen, as he was ac∣customed to do, wherefore she thought it a conveni∣ent time, to perform that which she had in her fancy by the way. This Gentleman, had in his Garden a Lawrell, which he himself had planted & cultivated, and it was become a great tree, it had a very pleasant shadow under which, the gentleman did often refresh himself with his friends, & pass the time away in dis∣course in the hotest time of the day. The young wo∣man very well knowing, what esteem her husband had for this lawrel; & having a mind by this, to try her husbands patience, as her mother had comanded, and therefore taking one of her husbands servants with a hatchet; she went with him into the ga
den, & being come to the lawrel tree, she commanded him to cut it up by the roots. The poor country-man, well enough knowing the pleasure, which his Master took in this tree; would not strick a stroak at it, whereupon his Mistress being angry, gave him many hard speeches threatning him with severe chastisment; for the little respect, & obedience he gave to her comands: And taking the hatchet out of his hand, she her self fell to

 cutting the fair Lawrel, to which she gave so many stroaks on every side, that she put the poor Lawrel cut of possibility of growing, and although it were then let alone, the servant then seeing that, took his hatchet and finished what she had begun: whose branches by his Mistresses command, being made in∣to faggots, and the body cleft in peices, he put it in∣to a Cart, and carried them to his Masters house, the Cart was hardly unloaden when the Gentle-man re∣turned from hunting; who went presently into his Chamber to refresh and shift himself, when his wife counterfeiting the good huswife, was not long ere she came with a faggot of the fair Lawrel under her arm, which she put upon the fire, aireing her Hus∣bands linnen at it, that she might the better play her project. The Gentleman being astonished to see a fire made of Lawrel, did suspect that some mischeif had bin done to his beloved tree, but he could not imagine that it was cut down, and theref
re so soon as he had shifted and refreshed himself, he went into the Garden direct y, to the place where his Lawrel had grown, where he saw that he wch had no mind to see; whereupon he began to cry out & curse, swear∣ing by all his Gods, that he would so sharply chastise those who had cut down his Lawrel, that they sh
uld never forget it: his wife hearing these threatnings, ran into the Garden, and with a smileing c
unte∣nance said to her Husband; that if you will be revenged for that fact, that your vengeance must fall on me, for none but I have cut up your Tree, wherefore did you do it said the Gentle-man, I w
ll tell you said she, bring returned from my Mother, where 
I
 had stayed almost all day,

 knowing that you were hunting and considering that in regard of your age, and the coldness of the present season, it was impossible but you would have a great need of a fire at your return, and not finding any dry wood to make a present fire, I came into this Garden, and very well knowing that the branches of a Lawrel-tree will make a good fire although they be green; 
I
 caused them to be made into little fag∣gots, whereof I made your fire as you have seen, and this is the very truth of the whole matter, which was done for your service, and therefore you ought to take it in good part, and now Sir if your anger will not be appeased, and that you resolve up∣on revenge, you may do what you please with me; for 
I
 shall suffer all with patience, since what I did was intended to serve you; You have done very ill said the Gentleman, and have a care therefore, that for the future you do not act any thing that shall so displease me, for I promise you by the word of a Gentle-man, that 
I
 shall take satisfaction for both. If you had not been furnished with dry wood in the house, was there not other trees besides my Lawrel, and assure your self, that if you had cut down all the Trees in the Garden I should not have been so troubled as for this one Lawrel: but since it is done, and cannot be helped, we will say no more of it, but for the future you take more care not to displease me.


Thus was the Gentlemans anger pa
ysi
d, and he passed away his t me with the Compa∣ny that expected him; the Gentle woman hearing her husbands 
s
r, and 
 w
∣ly she had appeased him, was very joyful


 see things succeed according to the intention of her Mother, so that she hoped in short time, to enj
y that thing which she most desired in the World: and long
d for the good hour, when she should return to her M
ther, and she what course she would take in her affair, considering the good experience she had made of her Husbands patience. The next day when the Gentleman was gone, as he was wont to pass away the time, the good Wife made haste to her Mo
her, where with ten thousand laughters, she re∣lated to her how all had passed, praying her there∣f
re without any delay to perform her promise with her; since her Husband had shewed himself so good a man, to throw of his anger so easily, notwith∣standing the great ill turn she had done him; it is ve∣ry well said the Mother, yet however although the proof is very good, yet it being made upon an in∣sensible thing, and which men are not so much troub∣led at, as at an other. 
I
 would therefore have you try your Husbands patience in a thing more certain, as in some beast which he loves as the Bitch, for which he hath so great an esteem, that he can hardly live without her; kill this B
tch therefore before his eyes, and if he lets that pass without punishment, or great anger: then I may fully conclude that I may do what you desire, but have 
 care that he does not use more than words upon this account, for I never knew any man love any beast better than he does this Bitch; let me alone for that said the Daughter, for in a very little time you shall hear that I will ac∣quit my self as d
x
rio
sly, and well in this second charge, as 
I
 did in the first: and thus being fully re∣solved with her self of what she took in hand, she

 only waited for an opportunity to execute her de∣sign.


It wa not long after this, but this Gentleman walking abroad with several of his loving friends, he took his bitch along with him, his wife dressd up her C
amber, and the better to adorn it, she put a very fair and rich covering upon the bed; and dress∣ing her self in her best apparrel, she took a book in her hand and began to read in it: being sate down to the fire, and expecting her husbands return, who at his usual time came accompanyed with divers o∣ther Gentle-men, he sate down to the fire being very cold, and the wayes being very dirty, the little bitch being in that dirty pickle, leap'd upon the Bed, and bemired all the fair covering that was on it. The good wife took no notice of it, when soon after the bitch leaped on the ground, and having fawned on her Master, ran directly and lay down on her Mis∣tresses garment. which she all bemired, as she had done the bed covering; the young woman seeming to be very angry, snatched up a knife which she found there, and having took up her husbands little bitch, she presently killed him, in the sight of all the Gen∣tlemen that were present, and it was done on such a suddain, that none had so much time as to rescue the poor creature out of her hands: the Gentleman was so very angry at this outrage, that he would have proceeded further than words, had not the Compa∣ny hindred him, for all this the young woman con∣tinued crying, look you said she: how this mischei∣viou
 bea
t hath spoiled my cloathes, which are of more value then all the bitches in the World; and which is worst, behold what a pickle she hath made

 the bed in: and to say the truth, we could keep no∣thing clean in the house for her; yet, however I could wish she were alive agen, and 
I
 am very an∣gry with my self, by reason of my Husbands trouble, and wish I had not done it; had not my passion been so violent. But since it is done, he ought to appease his anger, the Gentleman seeing that all the sorrow in the world would not restore his bitch a∣gen, was somewhat pecifyed, only saying to his Wife, that she had done very ill in that manner to kill his bitch for so small a fault; this being over the Gentle-man and his Friends, spent their time in their ordinary divertisements, and the young Wo∣man was pleased at her heart, finding that she had so bravely come off from her undertaking, without any difficulty: and therefore the next morning early she went in all haste to her mother, to let her know of this last passage, pressing her to put in ex∣ecution that which she had promised, seeing she had such certain proof of her Husbands patience: the Mother understanding how matters went, made as if she were very glad, and told her Daughter that truly she had reason to keep her word with her, but that she might have greater assurance, and some cle∣rer proof of his heart, she desired one tryal more of his patience, promising and swearing to her daughter, that if her Husband then continued in that temper, she would immediately, and without any delay, give her the content she desired. And what o∣ther proof would you have said the Daughter, I think what we have already is very sufficient: but for ought I see, all your discourses tend only to pro∣long the content, which you have promised to give

 me; why did you not at first tell me that you would not meddle in it? and then 
I
 had took an other course. Daughter said the Mother, do not take it ill, for what I do is not to deny you my assistance, but to accommadate your honour, and my own also; the first tryal that you made was upon a Plant, and therefore you proceeded to a second, upon a beast: now I would have you make a third proof upon men, what is it you mean said the Daughter, that I should kill some body, it is somewhat difficult for a woman to do, but if there be no other way to attain my desires, I shall not question but to perform it; God forbid answered the Mother, for I do not intend any such matter, but this is my meaning, that as you have already offended your Husband, so now in the last tryal; the displeasure you shall do him, shall not only extend to him, but also to the Company; and this must be done in somewhat of as great import∣ance as was that of the Lawrel, or Bitch which you killed; and 
I
 have thought how, and what it shall be. You know your Husbands birth day is very near, and that he usually makes a great feast on that day for his Friends; 
I
 would have you then when the Table is covered, and the victuals upon it, and every one is seated, that you arise pretending to look for somewhat, and that by some means or other, you throw down the Table, and all that is upon it: and if your Husband lets this pass without being reveng∣ed on you, I promise you, and swear to you, that the very day you shall do this, 
I
 will content you in that thing, which above all things in the world you most desire; the young woman thought the time long, al∣though it was but three dayes, but she resolved to

 wait in the mean time, considering with her self the manner of what she was to do, hoping to have a bet∣ter issue for this third enterprise, than she had for the other tw
; the desired day being come, the Gentle∣man caused great preparations to be made, to enter∣tain those guests he had invited: so that there was very good company, and of the greatest Lords of all the Country, the Tables being spread and cover∣ed in such manner as is usual for Persons of his quality, and the hour being come to sit dow
 (which was the desi
ed time for this young woman, not for the hunger which she had, but for the great desire which she had to satisfie her self, of somewhat else besides v
ctuals:) every one took their places ac∣cording to their degrees, and among others the young woman was seated at the upper end of the Table, as it is usual for Ladies, and as the victuals was a ser∣ving, she fastned her keys to the table-cloath, and having thus done, pretending to be in haste to go look for something, she arose and in her riseing she pull'd down the Table and all that was upon it, whereupon the Gentleman being angry, asked wherefore she had thus thrown down the Table; I did perceive said she, that some body had put a strange knife at your trencher, and I very well know∣ing that you could not endure to use any knife but your own, I therefore arose up to look it, and I know not how the Table caught hold of me so that it was thrown down; all the company endeavoured to laugh away the mischance, and pass it for a jest, and withall every one very much commended the great care the young woman had of her Husband. The Gentleman being very discreet, took no no∣tice

 of it at present, that he might not disturb the Company, but caused the Table to be taken up, and other service brought, for there was plentiful pro∣vision of all sorts of victuals, and thus was the day passed away without thinking of any thing but pass∣time, wherefore the young woman had a world of joy in her heart, beleiving now that there was no obstacle that could hinder her content, so that she only waited the good hour when every one would be gone, that she might go to her Mother, and give her order for that which she so ardently desired; but the Guests kept company together all the day with the Gentleman, that she being forced to continue with them, by necessity deferr'd going to her Mo∣ther till the next morning, not questioning but then all things would fall out to her expectation. But she sound it otherwise, for although the Gentleman had passed away all his birth day, that he might not trouble his guests, without takeing notice of the shame which his wife had caused him: yet however he had not forgotten it, nor the other two outrages which she had done formerly; and therefore being a wise man, he purposed to chastise his wife, without making any noise, and therefore the next morning finding her awake, and that she went to dress her self, to go to her Mother, he commanded that she should not rise, whereupon the good wife being asto∣nished, replyed, that she had a minde to rise, having slept enough already; but the Gentleman answered her, that the reason why he would have her lye in bed, was for her good, and that it was convenient for her to do so: that she might take a medicine that he would give her, for what cause said she, for I

 need no medicines, for God be thanked I am well and lusty, you are to
 lusty said he, and the cause of it is a certain superfluous blood that boyles in your body, which at every turn causes you to play the fool, which is to my displeasure, and a shame to you: do you remember the fair Lawrel which you did cut up the other day, which I loved above all the trees of my Garden: a little while after you killed my B
tch, which was the pleasantest beast I ever had in my house: yesterday you threw down the Table, where there was so good company without consider∣ing the trouble you put them all too, to my great shame on my birth day. Now if I should let all this pass, I know the fourth offence would exceed all the rest, but I have a purpose to cure you, and thereupon causing a good fire to be made in the Chamber, he sent for a Barber, who he had provi∣d
d ready for the purpose: He being entred the Chamber, he caused his wife to rise, and come to the 
ire, and giving him her right arme he caused him to rub it and chafe it, to fill the veins the better, and then commanded he B
ber to perform his Office; he did as he was commanded, and opened one of the young womans veins, who could not guess what would be the end of this adventure. But see∣ing her blood she began to be afraid, but she could not help her self, for the Gentleman caused her to be held so fast that she could not stir: and he let her continue bleeding thus, till such time as she could bleed no more, without endangering her life, and then he caused the vein of her right arme to be clo∣sed and bound up, but he did the same to her left arme, in such manner that the poor young woman

 was half dead, and having left all sense was car∣ryed to her bed, where having been some time, as in a sound, and being somewhat come to her self, she sent one of her servants to her Mo∣ther, earnestly praying her to come to her present∣ly, the servant having delivered the message, the Mother made all possible haste to come to her; but she understood of the Messenger by the way how all things had passed, how her Daugher had thrown down the Table, and all the victuals that was upon it; but she who very well knew all the Mistery presently guessed how every thing had hapned, and for what cause: being arrived at her Son in laws Castle, she went directly to her Daughters Chamber, saying to her with a plea∣sant and merry countenance, look you Daughter I am ready to accomplish all that I have promi∣sed you, would you have me bring your Friend hither to day; to this the Daughter replyed with a feeble voice, and so low, that she could hard∣ly be heard: Ah Mother I am dead, all my fire is extinguished, it is no time now to speak of love, but only to think of giving me some Cordial re∣storative.


From this Sir you may comprehend what 
I
 will in∣ferre, and conclude by this example, you are now old and full of years, and yet have taken a young wife and alth
ugh she wants for nothing, but in that point that young Ladies most desire, wherein I sup∣pose you can do but little to her satisfaction and con∣tent, and for the cause it is that the Empress your wife is troubled with conceits & fancyes in her head, so that whether it be for revenge, or any other end she

 endeavours to torment and displease you, so long as this mischeif extended but towards a Plant, or up∣on a Dog, it might be endured, as the good Knight did, of whom I have spoken, but the cruelty is 
oo great: to deprive you of on only Son which you have, who is one of the most accomplish
d young men, that is this day in all the world; wherefore 
I
 am verily perswaded that he is falsly accused, so that your Majesty will consider of this affair as you ought, without using precipitation to draw out the truth of the fact, you will find your Son innocent, and those who endeavour to ruine him, a
d take a way his life, culpable of the out-rage of which they have falsly accused him. The Emperour continued some time in silent meditation, hearing the discourse of the Philosopher 
Thernus,
 bu
 he resolved that the execution of the sentence of 
Erastus
 should be stop∣ed for that day, and withal 
xp
sly declared that he would gravely and deliberately examine the fact of his Son.

CHAP. XIII.
 The Empress 
Aphrodicia
 perswades the Emperour to cause Prince 
Erastus
 to be executed by a discourse which she made to him, of a King of 
England;
 who having by the Councel of 
Merlin,
 caused seven of his principal Counsellors heads to be cut off, who under the name and titles of Sages or Doctors, tyrannized over 
England,
 and by that means the King recovered his sight.


THE Empress had so great an affection to hear the news of the death of her Son in Law, ac∣cording to the promise which the Emperour had made her, that every hour seemed to be a hun∣dred ye
r; but she understood the contrary to her expectations, for a Gentleman of her Chamber ac∣quainted her how that the Emperour being induced by the discourse of the Philosopher 
Thernus,
 had commanded stay of the execution for that day, whereupon she was so enrag
d, that she thought she should loose her senses; and retireing into her Chamber, and sighing and crying, she would not see any person all that day, in the evening the Emperour having understood that the Empress was gone to bed, & that she was very ill, he went to see her, endeavour∣ing to comfort her the best he could, knowing that all

 her ilness 
roceeded from melancholly, particular∣ly praying her to be of good chear, alledging se∣veral reasons to her, why she should not take it ill, that he had stayed the execution of his Son 
Erastus,
 and that he did not intend to stop the course of justice, but to let all the world know that he had proceeded judiciously in that affair. To this the Empress going to anser, fetched a deep sigh, saying, it is not possible Sir, but these delayes must be to my great prejudice; since my honour is so inter∣ressed, and the little regard you have for it, although you your self are principally concern'd: however God be my witness that the greatest sorrow that I have is for your sake, who now seem to me to be re∣duced to the some condition as a certain King of 
England
 was, who by the just judgement of God became blind; but I wish that like him you will give ear to the Counsel of the Sage 
Merlin,
 by which means he n
t only recovered his corporal sight, but also had the eyes of his understanding cleered, what and wh
 was this King said the Emperour, and how was this matter, I pray be not angry but tell me, f
r it may be, I shall thereupon take such advice, th
t y
u will be as glad that you have told it me, as I shall be joy
ul that I have heard it, God grant it replyed the Empress, so that by this means the eyes of your understanding may be opened, and al
hough I expect no more from this discourse than from your former promises; yet however that nothing may be wanting on my part, I shall not forbear to endeavour to let you understand your duty, and thereupon she thus began her discourse. Sometime since there was

 a King of 
England
 who desireing that the affairs of his Kingdom should be well managed, and being unwilling to take pains himself, that he might en∣joy the more pleasure, he therefore committed the management thereof to seven great Personages, who belonged to his Court, and who having the repute of the Sages, pretended to have knowledg in all things; whereupon in short time it was brought to this pass, that the King only minding his pleasure, left all dispatches and affairs to these seven Sages who acted all things as they were minded, and gave the King what account they best thought for their purpose, but above all thing; they took care not to displease him, so that in time they were in such high esteem, and they were taken rather to be Lords of all 
England
 then Counsel∣lours; true it is, that in the beginning they took so good order in the execution of justice, that all things were done in good order: but afterwards when they had tasted of the great gifts and presents that was usually made them; they then were so de∣sirous to heap up riches, that they minded nothing else, without respecting their honour, or the zeal they should have to justice; and among other in∣ventions to raise mony, they found out one than would raise them a world of riches, at that time it was a custome in 
England,
 for the Natives to give such credit to dreames, that the believed the greatest part of their affairs and chiefly those of importance were divinely re∣vealed to them in visions and dreams which they little or much understood according to

 to the goodness and sanctity of the persons, who thus should dream, so that when any one had dreamed of any thing that she could not understand, they had re∣course to the Sages (whereof in 
England
 there was great plenty) and for their advise carried great pre∣sents, as if Gold and Silver would cause the true in∣terpretation of dreams; these seven Deputies or Governours of the Kingdome, understanding of this that they might shew themselves the more knowing, and more excellent in all things than any body else; and more particularly in the interpretations of dre
ms, under pre
ence of takei
g away the abuse which was done upon that account, and that the people might not be dec
ived in the interpretation of dre
ms, t
ey published an E
ict, by which it was prohibited; all persons to go to any to have inter∣pretation of dreams, but to them 
lves. In persu∣ance of which E
ct, a world of people came to them every d
y, with great presents: so that in short time these Lords were 
iche
 in mony then the King himself, who minding nothing but to take his plea¦sure, fell into a v
y strange accident: for having hi
 N
ts to be pi
ched in a very pleasant For∣rest to please the 
dies with a co
 at hunt∣ing; he was no sooner gone out of the ga
es of 
London,
 to g
 to this hunting, but that his eye-sight was so troubl
d that he could not see, wherefore taking adv
ce of his Physicians; who looking on the K
gs eyes, found they were fair and without blemish; and under∣standing that he had no pain in his head that he was not wounded, that might occasion this blindness,

 they knew not what to think of it, but only advised the King to return to his Pallace, and go rest himself, and that in the mean time they would consult among themselves of this accident to remedy it as well as possibly they could; according to this advise the King turned his bridle to return back, but he was no sooner entered the City-gate, but he recovered his sign without using any remedy; whereupon being not only joyful, but wondring with a merry heart, he turned his bridle to go follow the company; but he was no sooner out of the City, but he was agen taken with his former blindness, so that he was forced to turn back towards the Court and yet so soon as he was entred within the City-gates, he recovered his for∣mer sight, yet in regard the time was somewhat spent, he put off the hunting untill a
 other time▪


The next day going to pass away some time at a garden, that was without the City, he was no sooner passed 
London
 Gates, but he became blind as he had done the day before, and no soon∣er was he returned in the City, but he saw as cleerly as he had formerly done; upon this account the Physitians were amazed, they had many consultations but without any effect: for in ge∣neral it was thus, the Kings sight was good so long as he was within the Cit
, but so soon as he was out of it he became blind, and al
hough he went out at several Gates, and had tryed them all yet he still continued blind so long as he was out of the Ci∣ty, and when he returned he could see well enough. In this condition this poor Prince remained for sometime, and c
d not finde any remed


 which was a great 
ffliction to him, to see himself confin'd to the City of 
London,
 whereupon one day he called the seven Counsellors, to whom he had committed the Government of the Kingdome, remembring that they had given out that they could give a reason for all things, and therefore he ex∣presly enjoyned them that they should make known to him the cause of his blindness; that he might finde a remedy without being thus confined within the walls of the City of 
London:
 but these great Sages who knew as little of the causes as the King, were so amazed that they could not speak, answer a word to purpose, yet however dissembling their ig∣norance, they told the King that the case required to take some time of advice to consult well on the matter, and to studdy on it, that they might give him such an answer as might be to his content; to this the King replyed, I give you all this day to advise upon it, and charge you that tomorrow morning you give me an answer; but the Sages finding this time to be too precise and too short, told him, that the case was of th
t importance, that it required a moneth of delay: how a moneth said the King, is this the great readiness which you boast to have by your 
kil, presently to resolve all doubts and question
 
g
 and consult together, and in fif
een dayes resolve me of what I desire, and finde a remedy, or I promise you, I will make an example of you to all such as for the fu∣ture shall he so bold as to abuse their Princes. These poor unadvised Sages hearing this were much troub∣led, yet since they had a terme of fifteen dayes, they pluckt up their spirits, hoping in that time to supply their ignorance by the knowledg of some o∣ther,

 so that they assured the King that within the time prefixed they would give him the satisfaction he desired, and having took leave of the King, they each of them sever
ly sent away messengers in Post to all parts, to finde out some knowing person, to whom they might apply themselves in this affair, and their Messengers had good success, they hea
d of the vertue and miraculous spirit of the child 
Mer∣lin,
 and of the sayings he used, which surpassed all humain understanding. This child was but young, and was born miraculously, so that it was believed that his Mother had conceived being a Virgin, being with child by a Spirit; or a Magician: who it was reported had given her a great belly without touch∣ing her: by means of a familiar Spirit, but let it be so or not, the child was no sooner born, but he be∣gan to let the world know that he had more than hu∣main knowledg, so that in his very Cradle he speak the most admirable things in the world; whether it was in resolving questions, or foretelling thing
 to come, or describeing things past, as authentically as if he had seen them, and he 
pake nothing, but he gave a good reason for it: that it was not p ssible to imagine that any thing could be contradictory to his reasons, these Sages then purposed to go finde the young 
Merlin,
 to take his advice how they clear themselves from the Labrin
h wherein they were involved, and they travell
d so long that at last they c
me to the place where he re∣sided, who before had fore-told their com∣ing to his Mother, and several others advising

 his Mother to be ready, for the arrival of the seven who were called S
ges, should occasion him to go to Court, where he should continue a long time to his M
thers great advantage: and to the g
eat di
advan
age of those that came for him. Th
se Phil
sophers then were no sooner arrived at 
Merlins
 lodging, but they had great experience of h
s divine kn
wledg, which put them in good hopes, nay, gave t
em s
me assu
ance that they migh

 you have already from me, y
u may under
nd the 
ruth withou
 pa
ing 
rom you
g 
d for 
I
 will have nothing from you, but I will instr ct

 you in the way to be rich; In the first place, 
I
 would not have you tell me you dream, for I know it better then your self it is true that this last night, two hou∣ers before the sun rising, being l
id in your bed, you supposed that being si
ting in y
ur Cellar, you be∣come so very dry, so that all the drink 
n your house could not quench your thirst, whereupon a fountain did arise in the Middle of your Cell
r; having the fairest water; and the cleerest that ever eye beheld, to which you suddenly ran and having tasted of the water, you found it to be the b
st wat
r in the world, so that your thirst was q
enched, and you caused all your family to drink who like you received the greatest content they ever had: Now to know the meaning of this dream, you are going to find the Kings Sages, without acquainting any body with this adventure, 
Galgo
 hearing particular recitall, of that which he had seen in his dream; and knowing that he had no
 spoken a word thereof, to any person; he was surprized, that he believed this to be a dream as well, as that which he had dreamed of the fountain, and although he was thus ast
n
shed yet he affirmed that every thing had 
ssed p
rticular∣ly in such manner, as the infant 
Merlin
 had rec
ed, and that for no other cause he was taking a j
urn
y to 
London.
 Now you sh
ll understand the 
st, 
a
d 
Merlin,
 for this is the principall 
f y ur cause. The alteration which you saw, and which in truth pr
ss
s you, is the great desire you have to g
t w
a 
h that you be rid of your poverty & m
tain yo
 fami
y, better for the future; the f
ntain which 
st s
ve you to quench this thirst, is in your h
us
, as your dream hath demonstrated, and therefore 
t
n wi h

 all dilligence, and dig where you thought the foun∣taine was; for I assure you, there you shall find so great a quantity of Silver, that you shall have suffici∣ent for your self and family, but have a care that you be not robbed hereafter. The Philosophers hearing what 
Merlin
 had said, knew not what to think; and doubted of the truth, of what he had spoken, or whether this was not a design, or plot laid to cause the world to believe, that 
Merlin
 was a di∣viner; but he also understanding their thoughts, thus spake; I would not have you give credit to my speeches further then your own eyes shall be witness; and therefore go along with this good man, and see him find this treasure, and then return to me, that I may go with you to the King, whose grief is not unknown to me, without your relation of it; for 
I
 know from whence it proceeds, and what remedy is convenient for his Cure; and I assure you that we shall come to 
London
 the fourteenth day, which is the last but one, of the fifteenth; which is limited to you, to answer the King, so that you shall be at 
London
 time enough; the Philosophers wondred greatly, to see that 
Merlin
 knew already, for what cause they were come, and the term the King had ap∣pointed and would willingly, have discoursed of their business; but 
Merlin
 would not hear them, but de∣sired them to go see the good mans treasure, and that they sh 
ld have a care that they did not touch a pe∣ny of it, & that afterwards they should come to him, who would then be ready, to go with them, to the King. The Philosophers hearing this without alight∣ing from their horses, they followed the good man 
Galgo,
 whose house was but a few miles from that

 place so that they came thither the next morning Alighting from their horses, they went into the house with him; when he presently began to dig in the middle of the Cellar, where he had in his dream seen the fountain to rise: But he had not digged very deep but he met with a great quantity, of Meddals of Silver; after that he found several vessels of Silver, the fairest in all the world, under which he yet found so great a quantity of Ingo
s of Silver, that you could hardly meet with so much treasure, in one place together: And now the Philosophers believed this to be no counterfeit matter; for the King him∣self, could not have stored so much Silver together, without great thrift, and along time, and being thus astonished, they returned to 
Merlins
 quarters, to whom they related, all that they had seen; con∣fessing that by experience, they knew more to be in hime then they thought any man could be endowed withal praying him according to his promis
, to go to the Court with them, before the time should be elapsed: Question not that said he, for I shall be there to soon for your benefit, they understood not what he meant by this answer, but he who un∣derstood how all things would happen; gave them this slight knowledge of it: And now 
Merlin,
 and his Mother began their Journey, in Company of these seven Philosophers; and by the way dis∣coursing with them of many things, he gave them such reasons for every thing he said, that they were ravished with his discourse, and so long they travell∣ed that in the evening of the fourteenth day, they arived at 
London
 according to what 
Merlin
 had fore∣told. The next morning these Philosophers went to

 make their r
verence to the King; telling him that they were c
me within the perfixed time, to make 
l
er to 
; not only that which he ha
 asked of them, 
m all other ma
ters, as well past, present, & to com
: What said the Ki
g have you tasted some divinity, since I saw you, that you can fore
ell things to c
me, it will be enough for you to resolve the 
 I have demanded; without bragging of so much for I purpose, not to endure you; abuses no longer. Sir, it is no abuse, said the Ph losophers, for we shall tell you nothing but the truth, as by experi∣ence you shall find but to acquain
 you with the truth of the matter; this is not done by 
ur own know∣ledge, 
 by a divine and miracl
ous Child, of whom we having 
ord we sought him out for your service; and we h
v
 alreadly found such proof of his divine spirits; 
a i
 
od 
o
 been possible for any man to have p
r
v
d us to it, if we had not seen it, with our eyes: And thereupon they related to the King how all had happened about 
Galgo
 and the promise he had made them, to acqua
 the King, with the cause of his blindness, and the means for his recovery; whereupon the King was so well pleased, (as you may ve
y well imagin) that it seemed imp
ssible, to express the j
y, which he had in his heart; and therefo
e he presently commanded, that the Child 
Merlin
 should be brought into his presence: But when he saw that he was so young, he suspected that these Philosophers did only put an abuse upon him; which 
Merlin
 very well knowing, said to the King; Sir, before I shall tell you the cause of your blindness when you are out of the City of 
London;
 and the meanes to deliver you, I will shew you to your own

 sight, what hath been the cause o
 
t, a
d what ke
p
 you in this C
ndition; so that you seeing by experi∣ence, that I know the cause of your evil which hath been hid and unknown to your self, and all others, of your Kingdom, you will be the more rea
y to give credit to what I shall further say 
 you: Hereupon having caused the bed whereon the King usually slept to be removed; he said thus Sir, cause sombody to dig under it, for there you shall find a great Caul∣dron, that without fire, burnes continually and which is maintained, by seven great balls of fire; whereof there is one in the Middle, which is larger than the others, who are all of an equal bigness, and ere all placed about this great 
 Now Sir, you may please to understand, that so long as the fire of these balls shall endure; you shall always find your self blind, when you are out of the City of 
London
 and yet it is imp
ssible, to extinguish it by nature, nor by any other liquor whatsoever, for the more water shall be cast upon this fire, to much the more violent∣ly will it burn; and further great care must be taken, not to remove this burn
ng C
ldron from the place where it is, for i
 will not only burn those that shall attempt to remove it, but you will also suffer more mischief, if it should be removed; for you would be∣come absolutly blinde, without armedy as wel with∣in the City as without, up n these words of 
Merlin,
 the King commanded to dig in the place where his bed was, but they had not digged very deep, but they who first began, were forced to leave off, by reason of the great smoak that issued out: It is enough said 
Merlin,
 for the force of the fire, will discover the rest; and so it came to pass, for it was not long before

 the earth flew up like sparks of fire, and then first was seen the great ball of fire, which was it the middle; and soon after, the rest discovered themselves, one after an other, so that in less then an hours time there was plainly seen the b
ring Cauldron; and the seven fire balls, which did cast up their fire a great height: At this sight the King was amazed, and so were all the Princes of the Court, who were very desirous to understand the mistery of this miraclous fire; and more especially the King, who earnestly asked of 
Merlin;
 from whence this fire could proceed Sir, answered he, this is a great secret of God, who will not have i
 revealed but t
 those whom i
 Concerns; and therefore if you would know the truth, let every one depart; for to your self only, will I declare this mistery. Hereupon every one, by the Kings Com∣mand left the room, and none remained there, but the King and 
Merlin,
 who thus began his dis∣course; Sir, your Majesty ought out to think that she things 
f this world happen by chance, as some Ignorant persons have said; but you are certainly to believe that nothing happens but by the provi∣dence of God who having distributed his charges, to every one, according to his good will and pleasure he willeth, and expecteth, that man should perform his endeavour; in the vocation, to which he hath called him; and therefore having committed to you, the administration and government of this Kingdom, his pleasure was that taking care of the affairs thereof, and performing the duty of a good Prince; you should procure the good, and repose of the affaires of your people; as for some time you did. But after that you did so much

 give your self to pleasures, that leaving the charge to others, of those affairs; which according to Gods will, should pass through your hands; you were kept from the true knowledg thereof, so that the good justice that had been in this Kingdom, hath been al∣tered, and your good subjects are opressed; and on the con
r ty, they who should be examplarily punished; not only escape, by means of their money, but also are proved with estates, and offices; justice is to those that will give most, and finally, all things go con∣trary to what they ought: All this evil proceeds from no other ca
e, but that you being unwilling to be troubled with state affairs, have left the man∣nagment of all, to these seven; who under pretence of the name of Sages, committ the greatest extor
ions and unjustices in the world; thinking of nothing; but how to Tyranize 
v r the poor people, and heap to themselves great treasure, by the de∣struction of your Subj cts; wh
se complaint, and cry, having reached up unto heaven, God by his just Ju
gment, hath sent you this blindness, which you have, when you are out of the City of 
London;
 that as you have voluntarily deprived your self of the eyes of your understanding, so that you will not see, nor take notice of any thing, but your particular pleasure, instead of having your eyes employed, for the good and quiet of your people; you should be also deprived of your Corporal sight, so that you may not see any thing out of your City of 
London.
 Thus have I told you the Cause of your evil, so that now without saying any more

 it is easie for you to remedy it, but that you may be without any excuse, 
I
 will prescribe to you the course you are to take; know then that God would have you Chastise your self, for your fore-passed negligence, and by the same meanes, that those who have exercised so much Tyrany over your people, be punished, for their crimes are beyond all comparison greater then yours: True it is, that you have very much failed, but it was through Ignorance; having put into the hands of others, the adminstration and charge which God had comitted to your self; indeed you might think them to be wise men, and fit for such a government, but they have maliciously 
ff
nded; for they very well knew, that their actions wherein they Tyraniz
d over this Kingdom; were contrary to God, and nevertheless their insatiablness and avar∣ice have continued; & therefore you ought to amend your self, and that they suffer death; and 
I
 assure you if you act this justice upon them, your evil will leave you, and if you will not, I advertise you that the Judgments of God will increase upon you; so as to darken your heart, and 
I
 
ell you there is no w
y to extinguish these seven fire balls, but by the heads of these seven, and that you may ha
 a proof of what I say, make a tryal of the greatest, for a
 you have seen, the more you endeavour to extinguish it with water, or other liquor; so much the more violently 
 burn∣eth (as you have already made tryal) ca
se the head of the principal, that is the oldest, and most in∣veterate of these S
g
s to be cut off; and you will presently see that this great fire ball will be extingu∣ished. The King having very attentivly heard, the dis∣course of 
Merlin;
 some times blushed, and then agen

 became pale, and 
e found himself touched to the life, and yet however acknowledged his fault, for having continued so long without taking care of the affair
 of his Kingdom he began to sigh and groan, entreat∣ing the good 
Merlin,
 that he would pray to God for him that his Majesty would forgive him his faults, you need not doubt of that answered 
Mer∣lin,
 for in performing what I have told you, your offences shall be pardoned, without the intercession of any, and on the contr
ry if you do not perform it, a greater vengeance of God is prepared for you, since now you c
nnot pretend the cause of Ignorance: The King did think it very strange to put those to death, whom he had raised to such greatness, and of whom he had severall times, had experience on many occasions to be very wise; but considering, and view∣ing with his eyes, the matter of the Cauldron, and ha∣ving a remorse of conscience, for the great fault which he had commited, which put him in fear, of a more sharp v
ngance according to the threatenings of 
Mer∣lin,
 he therefore resolved to make a trial of the princi∣pall of the seven Philosophers; and thereupon cau∣sing him to be called, pretending to conferr with him about what 
Merlin
 had told him; he ordered his head to be presently, and privatly cut off, which being done, the great fire ball in the middle that did cast out more fire than the rest, was of it self extinguished: This being seen by the King, without any more de∣lay, he did the same by the rest, causing them to come one by one, and as one head was cut 
ff, so one fire ball went out; so that the last was no sooner be∣headed, but all the fire was extinguished, & there was no appearance; neither of balls nor Cauldron,

 which was not mater
call as 
Merlin
 said, but it was of fire, although it seemed to be of mettle, as other Cauldrons are, and the earth where it had been be∣fore, was as cool and fresh as in other places. This being done, 
Merlin
 ordered the Kings Chamber to be put to rights, and caused the bed to be placed, where it had formerly been; and because it was then late, he told the King that he should rest contented, and take his ease, for that night; and that the next day they would go out of the City of 
London,
 where he should perceive his deliverance and healing, which should be then seen, and known of all the world: The next morning the King arose early as joyfull as might be, and sent to all the Pr
nces and Barrons, and Gentlemen of his Court; that they should be ready, to accompany him; for he would that morning go pass the time, out of the City of 
London?
 Every one mer
a
led at 
he news, because the K
ng had so long continued without going out of 
he City, for the trouble to find himself blind, being out of the City, for the matter of the Ca
ldron, was not yet di∣vulged or known; and although it had been, it would have been acco
nted as a fable, and especially by tho
e who believe no more than what they see. The King then being mo need on the fairest horse 
n hi
 stable, did set r
wards having 
Mer∣lin
 by his side, wh
 was in homely hab
, for notwithstanding all his knowledge; he would have no other Clothes, but went in poor 
ay∣ment, according to the Condition of his birth; not regarding Clothes nor riches: The King did all the way discourse with 
Merlin,
 which his Princes wondered at; to see him thus taken

 up with a poor lad, without speaking one word to all the Nobility that foll
wed him; and being come to the City Gate, 
M
rlin
 going before, said to the King Sir, as I have served you as a Phisitian, so I will shew you che way to rejoyce; and the great occasion you have for it, in having rec
vered your sight to the great content of your people. And yet if you will speak the truth, although you had some hopes of your cure, yet you were not so cer∣tain as now at this time you make experience of it: And going forwards out of the G
te, he tu
ned a∣bout to the King who was also issued 
; and looked about towards all parts, believing himself entred into a new life, to see himself restored to that which he had so long lost, witho
t knowing how and which he had so often endeavoured to rec
ver; but in vain. Whereupon 
Merlin
 said to him Sir, do you see the truth of what I told you, and how the providence of God is great, give him thanks there∣fore, and for the future, so order you actions that the fury, and vengence of God may not fall upon you. The King being transported with joy, ran to embrace 
Merlin
 heartily; thanking him for his good aide and assistance, with a promise never to act contrary to his directions. The Princes Barrons and Gentlemen; who followed the King, seeing this were surprized with mervaile and joy, to see their King with his accustomed sight; and every one shewed some signe of re∣joycing; which was redoubled in the hearts of all, when they understood the meanes the King had ta∣ken for his Cure, which was a true and absolute a-franchising of the realm of 
England,
 from the tyran


 of these 
even Philosophers; who had for so long time oppressed the poor people: This news being spread a broad. Bonfires were made not only in 
London,
 but throughout all 
England;
 and as for 
Mer∣lin,
 he continued with the King, untill Justice was reformed; and having given him many good docu∣ments, as well for his particular person, as for the government of his people; he then went to instruct other Princes and Nations, according to the Charge which God had given him.


Now to apply this discourse to your occasion, I say Sir, that you stand in want of a 
Merlin,
 to shew you, the abuse of your seven Philosophers, who studdy nothing more, but how to take away your sight that you may not be able to Judge, not only of things passed, but also of those that are in being; and which you your self have seen with both your eyes: And in order th
reunto, they do so disturb your brai
 with their fabulous tales; that by degrees they will perswade you that the vilanous action which the Traytour 
Erastus
 hath done, contrary to all right, divine and humane; and to your per∣petuall shame ought not only, not to be punished according to the 
entence, which you have given but that he des
rv
s a reward; to which bl
ndness if yo
 suffer you self to be sotishly wrought unto; I can think no othe
wise, but that they will in time, take away y
ur life, as they have already deprived you of your eve
; of your understanding, (which I hope God will not permit,) by which meanes wi
 this wicked 
Erastus;
 they may exer
ise 
heir Tyrany on the poor 
Roman
 Empire. 
I
 shall prevent that, said the Emperour, for to mor∣row

 morning without fail, Justice shall take its course; in the first place, upon that Wretch who hath so highly offended, against your ho∣nour and mine; and secondly, against these Rascals; who in stead of learning him vertue, have shewed him how to commit, such vilanous actions: And of this, assure your self my dear, for it shall be delayed no longer. The Empress then seemed to be of good cheer; expecting the day, with an Ardent desire which possessed her, to hear the News, which might extinguish the Cruelty and Rage, which consumed her.








CHAP. XIIII.
 The Philosopher, 
Enoscopus
 slayed execution of the sentence against 
Erastus
 for the fourth day; by a discourse which he made to the Emperour of a Gentleman of 
P
dua,
 named 
Cleander;
 who for the words of his Chamber-maid, killed his Wife and Servant believing that he had found them in the act of dishonesty together; and yet afterwards knowing the Contrary, he tore out his Chamber maids heart; and being in dispair hanged him self.


THE Emperour having s
laced himself that night with the E
pe
s, at b
eak of day he c
ll'd one of the G
n
lemen of his Bed-chamber to him, (who was one of his principall favorites) com∣manding him with out further delay, to put in real execution: the sentence which he had pronounced against 
Erastus;
 and that he should wholy in∣cline himself to that end, least the Philoso∣pher should come in the interim, and hinder him of his intention: further comman
ing him, that as soon as 
Erastus
 was executed; he should secretly surprise the Philosophers and secure them in

 a strong Prison, each a part, to deter them from consulting each other, about h
 means of their de∣liverance It is true, the Empres
 was very desir
e and therefore much prest the Emperour that with∣out delay that one time and place should p
r a pe∣riod to their and 
Erastus
 his life; but the Empe∣rour would not be induced to a consent, saying, that to please the Senate (among whom these P
l
so∣phers were in great esteem) he would further en∣quire into their lew'd lives and conversations, and other misdemeanours, which they had perp
ed in the behal of 
Erastus:
 and if at length they would not confess, he would compel them to do it, and in the conclusion inflict such punishments as their villanies have deserved. The Empress being here∣with pacified, her sole expectation waited for the welcome news of the death of her Son-in-law; but on the contrary that good Philosopher who res
l∣ved to stand the fourth day in the defence of 
Era∣stus,
 was much troubled for his young Master. Now this man (besides his profound knowledg in other Arts and Sciences) was very skilful in div na∣tion, by the flight and chirping of Birds, for which he was calle
 by the name of 
Enoscopus,
 and in short, having known by 
h
 slight of certa
n B
rds 
ot evening preceeding that threatning 
al m
rn, that 
Erastus
 should be in danger of his l
fe, he went to the Castle before it was day; with an intent to find him ere the hour that seem'd with danger should approach; and finding the gates shut, he w 
 afraid to knock fearing that the Emperou
 und
r∣standing his errand was to speak with him, would cause him to be thrust out of the Castle, for he was

 well inform'd before of the resolution of the Em∣perour and Empress the night foregoing; and there∣fore res
lv'd to wait a
 the gate till some one came with whom he might enter, and so speak with the Emperour; and so it fell out as he had determined, for the Empresses Physitians having understood that she was indisposed the foregoing night, came very early that morning to the Castle, to enquire into her health and welfare, and to consult the most proper medicines for her recovery; by which means the Philosopher 
Enoscopus
 had a fair opportunity to have entrance into the Castle with them, he attended in the hall all they were return'd from the Chamber of the Empress to go to the Emperour, to informe his Majesty of the present condition of their Mi∣stres. The Physitians finding the Empress well, and that she stood not in need of their assistance, took their le
ves, and from thence went to the Chamber of the Emperour, their to pay their reverence and devoir, and with them went the good Philosopher 
Enoscopus,
 who was no sooner discovered by the Emperour, but he instantly dar
ed at him a furious deadly look, and upbraided him with many mis∣carriages, and was ab
ut to have had him cudgel'd soundly out of the Pallace; but fearing he might thereby procure the disreputation of a passionate man, and one that is transported with choller (ha∣ving alwayes been a moderate P
ince and well go∣verned) he bridled his passion; which the Philoso∣pher perceiving he made this as an argument to his ensuing purpose, and began to applaud the great moderation of the Emperour, of which he had made large demonstrations, even till that time in all

 his actions; making it apparent what great profit and reputation he had gain'd by that means through the whole Universe, remonstra
ing with all in
o what inconveniences they precipitat
 them 
l
s in∣to, who being led captive by choller, or other ssi∣ons, neglecting the true government of 
hem 
 have done those thing, which are irremid
ess, 
 seeing repentance we unavoidable, t
ey 
ave b
n reduced to despair, especially their 
 
ng irrepairable. But the more demonstra
 
 P
∣losopher made hereof, the more enrag
 w
 
he Emperour, so that he did not h
ar him, but wi h great perplexity; so that turning his back upon the Philosopher, he was just about to leave the room, but the presence of the Physitians and many other persons of quality, which were then in the Castle restricted his departure, fearing he might give them occasion to blame him for not giving them audience. The Philosopher now became earnest, and pressing in such manner that he demanded of the Emperour by way of admonition, where w
 his prudence & accus∣tomed patience & what was become of that love he ever had to justice, & those other excellent faculties which were wont so to shine in him, that they served for a less ornament to themselves, then wonder to others. I see sayes the Emperour what you aime at, and that you came hither to break the neck of my intention concerning 
Erastus;
 but it is in vain, for I have determined what shall be done in such sort that without demurring or delay, justice shall take place; whom to satisfie, 
I
 had rather see the death of my Son, and be destitute of a lawful success
ur to the Empire, than to pardon him in a case so horrible

 villanous & detestable, leaving him his life, by a father∣ly indulgence, to leave after me to the Empire a man so v
ld and wicked, to be its Prince and Governour, moreover do not think this b
siness shall be conclu∣ded in his single death: for justice shall no sooner have had her course on him, but that her rigour shall turn it self up
n you, and your Bretheren, for that evil doctrine and instruction to which may be attri∣buted this miscarriage and disorder which hath sur∣roun
ed the blooming years of young 
Erastus:
 not∣withstanding he shall not escape punishment, the which shall as in justice be redoubled on you not long after, seeing that an old man and making pro∣fession ought to be punished with greater severity, than a young man who hath yet arrived to no grea∣ter height than the name of a Disciple. Sir, said the Philosopher I am not aff aid of death, nor will it; threats terrifie my companions; who have lea
n'd in the study of Philosphy, that death is no pain to the vertuous, but end of their pains and travaile, serving to them instead of a gate or entrance into e∣verlasting happiness; and by this means by how much the more you cause our advancement, by so much the more are our obligations to you for it, but as to you it is imp ssible! would it not anger any one to see you instead of reputation and a good name which you may acquire by the love you bear to just ce, you fall into disreputation and infamy perpe∣tual, for being a Prince that is cruel, inhumain, preci∣pi
ate, inconsiderate, credulous and easie, to be de∣d
ceiv d, havi
g your ears p
ssest by one who coun∣terfeits a love, but hates you mortally and seeks

 by all means to make an end of such, who to speak truly have no other end but the advancement of your grandeur, and the utility of the Comm 
-wealth. 
I
 cannot be blaimed said the Emperou
 for opp
sing a fatherly affection to obey justice; since I proceed not by the instigations of any, or their false perswa∣sions, nor from my self, through fault of having al∣wayes my ears patiently imployed; for this fact was not related to me, but I saw it with both my eyes: yet notwithstanding I refus'd not to give au∣dience to you and your Companions, who by your tittle tittle, and tedious discourse, have so enraged me, that nothing could put me into a greater passi
n: for from them I could never gather any thing on which 
I
 might resolve, but only insisted on sensuali∣ty and natural aff
ction which in this respect agrees in the conquest of what will be found reasonable, and certainly the malice of your Companions hath demonstrated it self greatly in this affair, not only contenting your selves, to have shown so bad an ex∣ample and giving such bad advice to 
Erastus,
 but that you peremptorily uphold him in his crime pre∣suming on your pain
d expressions, (adulterating colour d) and subtle inventions, to make me fall in∣to this reproach, and so work upon my noddle, that 
I
 may take that for a fable or dream, which I saw with both mine eyes: but the matter is otherwise, than you suppose it, for know I will secure you from evermore abusing any person, and take this for certain that this is the last discourse you shall e∣ver make in this world, to which the Philo∣sopher replyed with out the least astonishment, I know not what you may have seen

 but 
I
 know full well that the judgement of the sight, notwithstanding it is judged more infallible than hearing yet it hath often prov'd deceitful, esp
cially when the spirit is busied, and transported with some passion; for whether good or b
d, it alwayes multi∣plyes what their eye would sufficiently and faithful∣ly remark; so that frequently a thing seems greater in appearance, than it is in effect, and by this means, that which you think you have seen in 
Erastus
 may be fal
e, you cannot have a better instance against him, than what a Gentleman of 
Padua
 had against his own faithful servant, thinking he had discovered him vitiating his wife, (who notwithstanding was one of the chasest Gentlewomen in all 
Pandua
) and thereupon without enquiring into the cause of his servants going into his Ladyes chamb
r, and putting too m
ch confidence in his own eyes, slew them both: but having 
terwards understand the the truth of the ma
er, (for God will not suffer long the inno∣cent to be 
ppr
ss
d with calumny; but by the same 
 they were wrongfully villifyed and dispar
g
d, by the same shall their innocency shine as b
ight as the morning S
) I 
ay this poor Gen∣tleman 
ll into such despair, that hating both fel
 and life, and fi
ding nothing no other way to office the fault by him committed, then to execute j
stice on himself for the injustice and injury which he had offorded his wife, and faithful servant, de∣prived himself of life b
 
is own wretchedness, and certainly if God (who hath alwayes his eye sixt for the c
versation of the Roman Empire, preserve you not in 
hi
 great exigency into which 
I
 see you falling, I fear in a very little time, a mischeif will

 befall you, for precipitating and hastening the death of your Son, for his innocency shineing out in process of time (but to late for him) you will be constrain'd in all right and reason to revoke that sen∣tence you pronounced too rashly, and with g eater precipitation then the evil matter of fact required a thing discordant to Emperial dignity, in which you are now establisht, in which tr
e nothing ought to be done, but with maturity and deliberation: It is impossible for me to dissemble the loved hear f r Prince 
Erastus
 your Son, as well for being my Dis∣ciple: as for those vertues which posse
s his Royal breast, and furthermore as he is the off-sp
ing of your Emperial blood, but these move me not so much as truth it self, and in its vindication am ready to sacrifice a life; and to the intent 
I
 may not sur∣vive my Disciple, I am expresly come before your Majesty, (having understood the command you have issued out for the execution) humbly bese
ching this favour not to permit to live after his death: and now Sir seeing that we are freed from the fear of death, be pleased to lend an ear to the discourse of the Gentleman of 
Padua,
 of whom somewhat I speak before; to this there wants nothing more but the discharge of my Conscience in all things; I know may any wayes concern your grandeur and service, this done do as you shall think most fit and expedient with 
Erastus,
 my self and companions. It so hapned that there were many Senature in the Chamber where the Emperour was, to confer with him about matters of State, who hearing the speach of 
Enoscopus
 the Philosopher were much mov'd and troubled, nay and the Emperour himself; although

 as at other times, he made no great appearance thereof, hereupon the standers by supplycated the Emperour for the prolongation of the life of 
E∣rastus,
 till the Philosopher had finisht his discourse, that he might not seem to have denyed audience in a matter of such great importance as the life of a man: to which the Emperour consented though much ag
i
st his minde, and thereupon sent away in∣stantly to defer the execution till further order: for the innocen
 
Erastus
 was already on the Scaff
ld, and his eye
 covered, yet lifting up his head to hea∣ven, he shewed by signs his innocence, and to avoid the malignity of 
aelestial influences, he was com∣pell'd to be silent. The execution then being de∣ferred for an hour without more ad
e observing the command of the Emperour, the Philosopher began his Narrative in this manner following.


In the 
oble City of 
Padua,
 a place highly re∣nowned, as well for its grandeur, as famous Uni∣versity, and illustrious Personages, its Inhabitants, among whom a young Gentleman called 
Cleander,
 who was reputed among the cheif of that City, as well for his great wealth, as antient and noble Fami
y. This Gentleman from his infancy having been well educated in learning, and brought up in all vertues, and commendable exercises, suitable to his degree, he became so great a proficient therein, that there was u
 other talk in 
Padua,
 but of the excel∣len
 education and good nourtriture of the young Gentleman; by which means his father was partaker of no small honour, besides the inward satisfaction which p
ssest his heart, it come to pass this young Gentle
ens Father dyed, and having paid the debt

 which was due to Nature, he became by this means sole Heir being his Fathers only Son, and thereupon took upon him the care of all the affairs of the house which was very great.


Notwithstanding, without secluding himself from those honest exercises in which he was brought up, he managed so dexterously his affaire, that one might say he was born to rule an govern an Em∣pire: and this rendred him more admirable to e∣very one.


The Relations and Friends of this young Gen∣tleman, seeing how orderly he governed his house, and being the sole male of that family which was left, perswaded him to marry, that so good and antient family might not be lost by his faul∣ty neglect of procreation. To which the Gen∣tleman would not condescend at first, but opposed it with much ob
tinacy. However understanding what his friends said, proceeded from a sincere affecti
n, he promised to put in practice what they had counselled him, with this 
proviso,
 that the Gentlewoman they should provide for him, should be of quality, and not inferiour to his for∣tunes; moreover well educated and of an age a∣greeable to his own: which being understood by his friends they undetook the pains to find out such a one as he demanded: it was not long er
 they had procured such a Gentlewoman, fa
, young, and bred like a Gentlewoman of 
Padua,
 whose name was 
Beatrice.


Their marriage done and solemnized he took home with him his new Spouse, whom he found in all things

 what he desired, it so fell out that she was very importunate with her Husband (as other women are) to have the management of the houshold affairs which she so notably handled that in a few moneths the Gentleman surrendred the whole charge thereof to her guidance, wherein she be∣haved her self wonderfully well, discreetly and mo∣destly, seldom acting any thing without the advice of her Husband, discoursing him alwayes so much to the purpose, with a deportment so sweet and amiable that her Husband thought himself in her the happi∣est man in the world: this amity and concord lasted a long time, for that these two were held the fairest and happiest couple in all 
Padua:
 but fortune (an Enemy to the repose and tranquility of the vertu∣ous) was not long ere she laid a plot to ranverse their happiness, and to turn their joyes topsi 
urvy; making an exchange of the felicity man can imagine, into the greatest misery that can befall man∣kind.


Now this Gentlewoman had a Chamber-maid a∣mong other servants who was an excellent Govern∣ness of a house, to whom her Mistress gave a great deal more l
berty than to others, for that love and fidelity she experimentally had found in her, not-with-standing this great govern∣ness, doing as many had done before, who finding themselves pamper'd by good dyet and enter∣tainment, never think of their honour, began to cast a lustful eye upon one of the servants of the house, and being over confident of the good opinion her

 Mistris and others had for her, consulted with her self, how she should enjoy her sensuality, and quench the flame of her carnal appetites.


Without any consideration had to her repu∣tation, and upon these thoughts she ordered the matter, so that she got this servant within her amorous net, or toyl, however the fear and danger counterpoised the pleasure: there two A∣morists had not been long in the Chamber, ere their Mistriss (which was continually busied e∣very where in the affairs of the house,) surpri∣zed them as they lay on the bed in the very act; at which being much enraged, seeing the hainous∣ness of the fact which they committed, was a∣bout to have delivered them both into the hands of her Husband, for him to inflict a punishment agreable as the crime required.


But then thinking with her self (being pru∣dent and discreet) that should she advertise her Hus∣band hereof, there might be great danger, that the zeal which he had for the honour of his house, might so transport him, that he might kill them both, and so justice be offended with him; where∣fore she was resolved not to speak a word, and on∣ly with the severity of rebuke turned the man ser∣vant out of doors, and taking her Chamber-maid by the arm, lead her into an obscure place, where any noise could not be heard, and there did beat her beyond sufferance; thus bruised and beaten she was forced to keep her bed, under the pretence of being very sick and thus

 was this fault hush't up; and although this wise Gentle-woman had great occasion to abhorre this wicked wretch for the faul
s which she had com∣mitted: yet was her countenance as friendly to her as formerly: but this ingreateful wench, ought to have highly prized the goodness and bounty of her Mistris
 in passing by a fault, so enormous, and so mildly corrected, entertaining her still, lovingly in her service, notwithstand∣ing she had forfeited all favour and respect, yet notwithstanding this contemned what ere her Mi∣st
es
 had done; or then did for her, and being as it were mad, not only to have lost her stoln pleasures, but to be baisted to boot, consulted with her self, how she might execute her re∣venge, in such sort that she thought of nothing night n
r day, but of the means to be reveng∣ed of her Mistri
.


Having discourst her self throughly on this point, and concluded how she should work he
 design, she immagined it would never come to perfection, as long as her Mistress should be so watchful over her, and therefore seeming to take all in g
d pa
t which her Mistress had done to her, became very plyable and pleasant, although within she carried nothing but poy∣son.


She now behaved her self humbly to he
 Mi∣stress, in such manner that having acquitted her her 
d, (which she had kept some dayes, by reason of her Mistress severe correction, she betook her self to her former employ of looking after the house

 behaving her self more diligent and affectionate towards her Mistress than formerly, seeming to he very well pleased with her chastisement, since 
e had deserved it, by which means her Mrs. could not perceive the least spark of that malice which she concealed in her bosome; and continued these subtle practises, till by abusing her with such dissimulations, whom she held as her mortal E∣nemy, she had got the good opinion of her Mi∣stress, and was again returned into favour.


In the mean time it was her common study to make her diligence in houshould affairs, to ap∣pear so visibly to the eye of her Master, that that she might gain the opinion of being a good huswife.


Seeing she was arrived to what she desired, she only waited an opportunity to execute the villany her wicked heart had con
ived against her Mistress, who one day being g
ne for po
s time with some young Ladies and R
l
tions of her own, to a Garden which she had w
hout this City, this She-Divel the Chamber-m
d (wh
 
ho
ght on nothing but her reven
,) 
 alone in his Close
, besi
e 
 in 
self there was no body in the 
e, t
gh 
is hour the most proper for her 
 a∣greeable to the plot the had formed to eff
ct her revenge.


In short, not to loose any m re time, sh
 went directly to her M
ter giving 
m to 
, that she had ma
er 
 communicate unto h
m. A
d w
 
 matter of imputrate
 


 all amazed and startled at these novels, it is such said the Chamber-maid, that cannot be greater, for you, now Sir, if you are willing to under∣stand it, you must doe too things.


In the first place, you must promise to keep counsel, and that you will not be angry with me for what 
I
 shall relate; for the reward will be very heard, if in li
n of being recompenced for that zeal add fidelity, which forceth me to this proffer, I suffer death for the same, which un∣doubt
dly will come to pass if this thing shall be known to have been divulged by means.


The other thing that I desire is not to be trans∣ported with chollar and fury, but resolve to hear patiently the truth of what I shall declare unto you. Speak boldly what thou wilt answered 
Cle∣ander,
 for 
I
 will never utter a word thereof with∣out your approbation; and do not think me guilty of such levity, that for thy words, or the words of any woman whatsoever, I shall inconsiderately believe any thing, much less do any thing that may injure my reputation. Wh
reupon the Cham∣ber-maid having made a long Apol
gie express∣ing her grie
 f
r b
inging him such newes which must needs turn to his great sorrow, spake thus. Sir, you have well known in the time that I have lived in your service, with that love and fidelity I have acted therein, not imploying my thoughts upon any thing, but the finding out such means according to my slender ability, as were most conducible to the guidance of your Domesti∣cal affaires, and bring the greatest contentment

 to your self and Madam your Consort; as much esteeming the good and welfare of my Mistriss, as my own life, observing the great love you have for her; which sole consideration (besides the obligation incumbent to render you recipro∣cal duty as a wife) is sufficient to make her love you, and to be very careful of yours: but es∣pecially her own honour, the which she ought to preserve above all things, and verily I always thought her till now very lately chaste and loy∣al.


But you and I Sir, are both egregiously deceived, for I am very well assured that throwing the fear of the law behind her, and the preservation of her own honour, she hath prostituted her self to one of your servants for her lustful satis∣faction. This I speak unwillingly, and being un∣able to bear with an act that brings with it so much misery; I have oftentimes reproved her, being both alone, to withdraw her from the baseness thereof, remonstrating to her the evil she acted therein, and the great danger she was like to involve herself; there by beseeching her to banish all such thoughts, and reconcile her heart to you, and to be as just and true as you have been to her; but the Harvest of 
 good coun∣sel 
I
 reapt in blowes even to D
; the which troubled me not, and did bear it patiently, nay was content to be beaten again and again, so that 
I
 might see that amendment I desired; but 
I
 see that things go worse and worse, and therefore am forced to give you notice hereof, to the end you yet

 may take such a course, as your prudence 
 
∣rection 
n the mean time let me pray y
, not to stick at my words, but satisfy yourself 
ther which you may easily do, for every thing, as often as you please shall be evidently 
de 
p∣pear to your occuler observation.


But herein have a special care of yo
r 
, for if you forbear to speak, and dissemble the know∣ledge of your knowing any thing you will easily find out which of your servants is m
 acc
p
le, to your disloyal wife; for fire will not suffer a long conce
lment, but make a discovery of it self by its own lustre. The Gentleman hearing his Chamber maid talk after thi
 manner, was am
z∣ed, to hear such tidings of his wife, whom he al∣ways thought chast and modest, a
 in truth so it was; now finding the meanes facile for the know∣ledge of the truth, he resolved to wait till he might fi
d out the true 
ea
oing 
ereof, and having forbidden the Chamber maid, to speak to any person hereof op
n pa
n of death, bid her go a∣bout her accustomed busin
s; and being al
ne began to ruminate with himself, often refl
cting on the f
ct of his wife, and p
rdering with him∣self who of his servants should be the man, that did him this injury.


Now among others, this Gentleman had a young servant, whom from his infancy he brought 
 in his own family; who was handsome, bold and of a gracefull d
portment; also his Mist
ess l v
d him well, not for lust, but for the goodness she saw him and his readiness to serve his,

 now this Gentleman thought within himself, that if any servant belonging to him, had done him this wrong it must be him, but the great loyalty and fidelity which he had always known in his wife, and this servant made; the case seem very strange and intricate, how ever he resolved to be very vigilent to see whither by himself or other means, he could come to understand the truth, and in short looking narrowly into the deportment of this his ser∣vant, he Judged him the likliest of all his ser∣vants.


He saw otherwise his servant had no other propensity, then to serve his Master; waiting at table, and consequently on his Mistress, in such manner that upon the least signall gi∣ven he flew to execute what was commanded him: Also he began to suspect seeing his wife was more desirous to be serv'd by him, then the rest and fancied (as commonly it happens to such as are tainted with jealousie) that all that his wife did she was accustomed to do, and that the forward, and ready service of 
Henry
 (for so this servant was called) at was an unde∣niable argument, proving what the Chamber-ma d had related; and as his jealousie began to en∣crease, he frequently resolved to kill, both w
fe and servant, and thought he had proof sufficient to confirm him in the fact, but remembring that the Chamber-maid had told him, that at any time and as often as he would
; she would lead, him by the hand where he might satisfie himself; he altered his purpose, concluding to see if it

 were possible, if he could surprize them in the very fact, to show that with good and just reason, he had done that which he had before determined; for which purpose, having secretly got the Chamber∣maid to come to him in his closet, he asked her whe∣ther she was willing to shew him that which she had told him concerning his wife; to which this wicked Chamber-maid answered; is there any thing more easy then this? Do only this which 
I
 shall tell you, and you shall see with both your eyes, that which shall make you mad to see. This very day if you please; seem to go out of Town for some few days, and a little while after return that night, and I gi∣ving you the signe, to which come without knocking at the door, and I will let you in; and then you may go briskly into the Chamber of your wife, for there you shall find the Cuckow brooding in a Nest that's none of his own.


This over credulous Gentleman finding the coun∣sell good of this wicked Chamber-maid, presently called for his Boots, and having his horse got ready said to his wise, I must go out of Town for some days, I recommend to you the care and mannagment of all; and taking his leave of her, as it was usual for him to do when he had travailed abroad, but he rode no further than the extream parts of the Suburbs; where in a secret place he lay occult, till about mid∣night and then perceiving the hour proper, for what he had resolv'd upon; he took a poysoned Dagger which he stuck by his side, and in this equipage he directed himself toward his Pallace; where arriving, he made the signall, which he had told the Chamber-maid, who being very watchfull as she was, ran

 instantly like a fury, to 
Henry's
 Chamber door at which she knockt very loudly crying out to him, 
Henry
 d'ye hear make hast, run quickly to your Mistresses Chamber, who is taken sud∣denly ill, and commands you in all hast to come and speak with her; that she may send you to a Physitian. Honest 
Henry,
 who was a good servant, and allways ready at command, 
w∣ing his Cloak upon his shoulders, went to the Mistresses Chamber, and at that very instant; the Chamber-maid opened the Gate to her Master, saying go up the stairs, and you will now find the steel and stone striking fire into the Tinder-box; wherefore hasten and go up softly, that you may not be discovered and that the whoring Varlet may not hide himself. 
Henry
 being come to his Mistresses Chamber, asked her; Madam what is your pleasure with me, for the Chamber-maid caused me to come in great hast unto you, to which his mistress reply∣ed, go and sleep for 
I
 need not your assistance, sure she is drunk as she use to be; poor 
Henry
 going out of the Chamber, encountred his Master upon the stairs, wh
 in rage without speaking a word, stab'd him with his Dagger to the heart, and there left him dead; thinking he had then come from defiling his marriage bed: and to prosecute his fury, ran to his wife, whom he found awake; and did beat and abuse her, worse than any common Strumpet; on the con∣trary the poor Gentlewoman all astonisht at the vil∣lanous misusage of her husband whom she expected not, demanded of him half drowned in teares; what was his reason for so doing, endeavouring also to vindicate her Innocency; but her husband still

 persisting in heating and battering her about the mouth with the Silt of his D
gger, whereby she had not the least permission to utter one sillable, and being more then half dead, he railed at her in the most reproachfull manner imaginable, and being un∣willing to stain his hands with the blood of her he loved once so dearly; he wisht she would dye of her own accord Having now pour
d out the poi∣son into a glass, which he had brought with him, he took it in one hand and his Dagger in the other, saying, choose which of these two thou wilt have, either this poison which will suddenly dispatch thee or shall I penetrate thy heart, with this Dagger; in recompence of those villanies, thou hast perpetrated, and acted ag
inst me: D
spatch in the choice, of one or the other, o
 I will dispatch thee instantly. The poor Gentlewoman, seeing her Husband firmly bene upon her destruction, without doing him any wrong; took the Glass of poyson, and lifting her eyes to heaven, said, I call heaven and earth, and all the creatures therein contain'd to testify my inno∣cency; and if there be a Providence above, who ever casts a watchfull eye on things below; I humbly supplicate that after my death, my honour may not remain cont
mi
a
d or spotted, either in respect to heaven o
 
h; and that one time or other, my in∣nocencie may be so p
picu
us that the death which I am now a
 to r
ce 
e form my own hand, may 
 us pl
sing to h
aven
 it is

de g

k (as G
 
nd be my witness) but all my trouble is for th
 
 y
u have c
st upon me, but I hope in God who is a j
st j
dge, that my inocencie will thine

 out the dishonour & confusion of th
se are the cause of this my present woe; I speak not this to you, knowing that you are troubled in my behalf, for I know 'tis your mis-prision, hath 
rove you to thi
 sad enterprize, the which when once clearly known, I doubt not will make you willing to re∣pair your present fault, with the hazzard of your life, to extenuate, which I had rather dye by my own hand, drinking this poyson, than to charge you with this infamy, of having shed the innocent blood of her, who so ardently lov'd and loyally serv'd you; having alwayes kept the tye of wedlock inviolable. Thus saying, and without fear she took the poyson and putting it to her mouth, she withdrew not the glass till she 
ed swallowed all, 
aving so done, she addrest her self to her Hu
band, saying, since by my death app
oaches, which I feel stealing on my eyes, your wrath and fury ought to be appeased, seeing you have taken as large a revenge as the greatest fault in the world may require, although I am innocent, I beseech you do me this last favour, as to tell me the occasion which put you into this passion, to the ruine of her, whom in times past you lov'd as your life, to wch. her husband thus replyed; how is it posible thou thou canst be so impudent as to make me believe that I am deceived in a thing 
I
 saw with both mine eyes: and toucht with both both these hands, which cau∣sed this revenge? but since before you dye, you de∣sire to see what thus inraged me here to see, 
I
 am content to do you that kindness, and so pulling her out of bed, drag'd her to the place where lay the bo∣dy of poor 
Henry
 the innocent, & throwing her down upon it, saying, solace thy self now in thy disloyalty

 with this Traytor, and as you club'd together to the ruin of your honour, and my reputation, so now agree, to dye miserably together in one place as a due punishment for your evill deeds, and to serve as an Example to others who dare commit the like. The poor Gentlewomen who had yet some little strength remaining (for the poison had not yet seiz∣ed her heart) raising her self as well as she could, cry out saying. Oh God! the sin of my husband is greater and more enormous than I thought it was; for I thought he aimed at my life alone, but I see we are both Murtherers; and have slain wrongfully the Innocent, I pray thee O God be pleased to enlghten him, and let him know our fidelity; to the end our honour may endure unwrong'd blamless and immaculate, turning thy eyes with justice, on that wicked Chamber-maid, making appear the trea∣chery she hath here committed; and hereupon she fell dead; being unable to pronounce her last words: for had she had more strength she had dis∣covered all, remembring her self what 
Henry
 said at the Chamber door, whom the Chamber-maid had sent thither, under the pretence of her Mistress calling for him, and now she seeing them dead; con∣cluded th
 the danger of the treachery, was blown over but death stopt her in her full career. The Gen∣tleman seeing the great resolution, and constancy in which his wife departed this life, was in a miserable taking; although he had too confidently believed his eyes, by whom he thought to have found his wife faulty; yet notwithstanding by the last words pro∣ceeding from his wifes mouth, falling dead, he began to suspect some treachery in this act on the Chamber-maids

 side, and resolv'd to know whether it was so or no, although too late. Having then call'd the Cham∣ber-maid, who mistrusting some danger for the evil she had done, came trembling; but he began to ask her with a smileing countenance (but within most desp∣erately heavy) by what means and in what manner she to finde out the loves of 
Henry
 and his wife, came or whether it was long since that she discovered this amorous intreague; and where was it that she first surpriz'd them in the fact, asking many such like questions: to which the Chamber-maid answered in tearms so intricate and contrary, speaking some∣times things the Gentleman knew were impossible that he concluded to take this following course with her looking very pleasantly on the Chamber-maid, he said to her: thou now hast of thy Mistris that which thou desired'st for she evil treated thee, but she will now be never more offensive to thy eyes, for which cause 
I
 am now obliged to thee that thou hast given me the means to be rid of that offensive thing which enraged me so often under pretence of zeal to my honour, for which I will assure thee, 
I
 shall not dye in thy debt: but since you have done me one kindness, pray do me another, and that is to tell me freely the truth of this business, and how it stands in every particular, for I know very well it is otherwise than I was made to beleive, to have the colour and occasion to do what I have already done. The Chamber-maid assuming courage from the words of her Master, verily believing she had plea∣sed him to the life, assured her self any thing, and therefore said to her Master, if you will promise to pardon, and not turn me out of doors, 
I
 will tell

 you one thing you never ye
 the 
 of, which put me upon the d
sire of this rev
 
 thought it would have 
 
d∣ly said her Master, for I know 
 the cause goes, and by thi
 me
 
 you will please me very much; 
f 
 
ur self, instead of a reward, I will inflict up
 
 a punishment so strange, that I will make thee tell the truth by force.


The poor and unhappy Chamber-maid, began to relate the love between her and the 
ervant, how she was surprized by her Mistress, beaten after a most grievous manner, and how she purposed a re∣uenge, should it cost her her life, in short she omit∣ted nothing that was past, saying moreover that it was not the life of her Mrs. she desired, but to have her as lo
dly basted, as she had been basted by her, 
he Gentleman hea
ing this, (being all 
age and fury,) he 
an a
 her, and having r
p
 open her breast with that D
gg
r he kill'd 
Henry
 with, be to
e out her h
, and stampt upon it, pouring out all the cur
es, repr
aches, and execrations he could think of o∣ver her wretched carcals, cursing himself too for believing the treachery of her miscreant, and now 
vi
g sufficient
 deplored and wept over the corps of his chaste wife, and faithful servant 
Henry,
 he askt of one and the other a thousand pardons, say∣ing, since it is inpossible to remedy so great a crime, as 
I
 have here committed, so great in killing you both so wrongfully, that it must not pass unpunisht; and therefore I will appease it I can, by sacrifising my self to your offended innocency; begging that you will not deny me your Company in death, since

 there was so much love and amity between us in life, till treachery made this final seperation. There is one thing left which aff
ds me some comefort and contentment, that before I dye, I have had my just revenge, although a thousand de
ths of such like Traytors, is no fit reparation for the life I have de∣prived; having said this, he put a halter about his neck, and having tyed it to a beam, strait over the body of his c
ste wife, he wrote against the wall, with his dagge
 these verses under written, which yet to this day are to be seen in the house of that miserable Gentleman.


By a rash act which had its rise from treason,


Incens'd by a maid servant without reason,


I wrongfully have stain my dearest wife


And a male servant have depriv'd of life:


At length I knew the truth but 'twas too late


To stay the hand of my too rigid fate,


And then I stab'd the heart that was the cause


In making me offend great Natures l
ws


For which I hang my s
lf against this wall,


Cleanders
 boundless rashn
s
 was his fall,


Having finisht this writeing, he threw the dagger under him, and pushing the stool on which he stood, to tye the rope about the beam with which he in∣tended to hang himself, he there hung miserably, ending his dayes for being over c
edulous, and pu
∣ting too much confidence in his own eyes.


And now to return to the matter of fact, which is the question I conclude. Sir, that you ought to take great heed in this matter, and weigh

 it with serious consideration without levity believe∣ing in the words of her, who desires the death of 
Era∣stus
 without any reason, thereunto inducing: Con∣sider then within your self, that this affair may be o∣therwise that as it was represented to your eyes. For there is no greater argument, nor more proper in∣stance for entring into jealousie, then this Gentleman of 
Padua,
 of whom we spake before; who without questioning the matter took it for certain, but knew in the conclusion (but too late, and to his utter ruin) that a matter of such great importance, should not rely on the believing of an other, nay nor himself. This oration of the Philosopher, put all the Auditors into admiration; for he spake so much to the pur∣pose, and with such vivacity, that all the standers by could not refrain from bathing their cheeks, in a S
a of teares; which wrought so eff
ctually, that every one Judged, nothing wa
 more requisit
, then staying the execution of the sentence o
 
Erastus,
 untill the fact was more narrowly searcht into, that in the end, he might receive a righteous Judgment. Whereupon the Emperour was constrained to condescend, as well for that excel
t di
course the Philosopher h
 de∣livered, as for the supplications the Senate 
st
r'd up to his Majesty; according to this conclusion, 
Erastus
 was sent br
 to his Dungeon, and so had his life pro∣longed by the mea
s of hi
 good Master 
Enoscopus.

 This History or Example of 
Cleander,
 is according to the originall, in the 
Italian
 and 
French;
 but in regard there is another History in another Book to this purpose; I shall thus relate it.


THere dwelt in a certain City, a Kingh
 well stri∣ken in years, who notwithstanding married a wife; whose youth and beauty bo
h conjoyned to make her the subject of every mans admiration, these two things, so endeared his affections towards her, that their was no
hing to her, by him more p
izable in the whole universe; now least at any time he might be robb'd, of this inesteemable Jewell, after with his own hands he had lockt hi
 doors, he secured the keys under his beds-head. By the way you are to under∣stand that by the Low
 of the City, at a certain hour of the night a Bell was usually rung; after the sound of which, if either man or woman was found gadding in the streets, they were instantly seiz'd and having been detain'd in prison 
 might, the next morning they stood in the Pillory, a
 an object of shame and laughter to all the beholders.


This antient Knight, by reason of his age, was im∣potent, feeble; and altogether unable, to give that satisfaction as youth required; as well for procreati∣on as delight, and therefore his young wife, found out away to supply his defects, by taking the keys every night from under his head, when fast asleep & opening the doors went to her paramour, who having lustfully enjoyed her sill, returned and lay'd the keys in the same place, from whence she took then.


It so happened (but not expected) that one night

 fafter she was gone, to prosecute her accustomed de∣lights, that her husband awaked, and m ssing his wife felt for the keys, but finding them not, he went down to the door, which he found open; therefore he bolt∣ed it, and returned to his Chamber, and suspecting his wifes levity, he lookt out of the window to ob∣serve the passages, which might happen in the street: When it was very late, or rather early his wife came from her lustfull 
allion, but found the door bolted a∣gainst her; however she took the boldness to knock. Hereupon the good old Knight looking out of the window, and seeing it was his disloyal wife, spake to her in this manner; O thou wicked & unchast woman, have I now found you out; how often may 
I
 not from hence conclude thou hast committed adultry, & defiled thy marriage bed; for which cause stand there till the ringing of the Bell, that the Watch may take thee, & that punishment may ensue, according to thy demerit. To which she cunningly & cogingly replied; my Lord, why do you thus unjustly charge me; I am no ways guilty of your accusation, for if you will know the truth, 
I
 was sent for by my Mother, being taken dangerously ill; now finding you in so sweet asleep, I was loath to wake you, & therefore without the least noise I rose, & taking the keys I opened the doors & went whether my duty commanded me. I found my Mother sick even to death, & though I believe she cannot live till the morning, yet so great was my af∣fection to you, that I came away & left a dying Mo∣ther to return to a dear and loving husband wherefore 
I
 beseech you let me in; but the Knight utterly re∣fused it: hereupon she reminded him, what a shame it would be (were she taken) not only to himself, her

 self, but to all their relations, using besides all the per∣swasions her subtile invention could find out requisit for her purpose, but all prov'd unavailable, when she saw nothing would prevaile, she bethought her self of this stratagem: my Lord (said she) you know by this door there is a well, if you let me not in, I will drown my self therein, to avoid the shame 
I
 see is coming upon me, and my friends in my behalf. As the old Gentleman was about to reprove her further; the moon went down, & now was the night obscured with a darkness, more then usuall, she being glad of this advantage, she thus spake; that I may dye like a Christian, before I drown my self, I will make my last Will and Testament, and first I bequeath my Soul to Heaven, and my body to the Earth, but all other things what ever, I solely leave to my dear husband, for him to dispose of, as he shall think convenient; having finished her saying she went to the well, and there finding a great stone, she took it up in her arms and lifting it up cryed out, now 
I
 drown my self, and to threw the stone into the well, having thus done she stept to the side of the door again, and there absconded her self. At the n
i
e of the stones fall into the well, the old man verily bel
ev
d that his wife had been as good as her word, in drowning her self, and having made a miserable out cry ran hastily down to the Well, to prevent what not∣withstanding he thought irrecoverable he was no sooner out but she got in a do
rs, and having lockt them, went up into her Chamber, and lookt out of the window as he had done before, and having heard along while the sad complaints, the poor old man made for

 the loss of his wi
, condem
ng much his over ridg∣ed humour she regarded less of his sorrow, called out to him aloud: reproaching him in the vilest manner imaginable, calling him leacherous Dotard, and up∣braiding him for sl
ghti
g her, and going continually a night walking af
er H
l
; will other base ab
ses which the old Man valued not being overjoy'd to hear that his wife was yet living, and desiring his wife to have a better opinion of him, b
'd her to o∣pen the door, and p
ssing by all they would be good friend
; but she was deaf to all his entre
ties, vow∣ing he should stay there till the w
tch came, that he might suffer deservedly as he had threatned her before. The Knight insisted upon his impotency for his vindication; alledging further, that out of pure aff
ction in her we ha
e he was now in the streets, a
d 
herefore desired h
r not to let him suf∣fer sh
fully for love and tender kindness; but all this would not do, and as he was studying some new pers

Now said the Philosopher to the Emperour have you minded well this story, and he said right well: then said the Philosopher if you execute your Son, being thereunto instigated by your wife your con∣dition may prove more unfortunate than the antient Knights. Hereupon the Emperour con∣demned very much the lew'dness and unworthiness of the woman, and said moreover that for that very cause 
Erastus
 should not dye that day, the Philoso∣pher having applauded his resolution, and 
bly thankt him for it, he departed.








CHAP. XV.
 The Empress again prompted the Emperour to hasten the execution of Prince 
Erastu
,
 by a Letter which she wrote wherein was contain'd a discourse of Treasures belonging to the King of 
Egypt,
 of whome one was very covetuous, and the other libe∣ral, who being over rul'd by the evil councel of his Son resolv d to rob the other Treasurer, and possess himself of that treasure the King had commit∣ed to his charge, but being unable to clear himself from the place wherein he committed this robbery, he ordered his own Son to cut of his head, this Son living after very rich and being arrived to that pitch he pro
osed to himself, kil'd also his own Mo∣ther, who was privy to the theft, to prevent her making any discovery thereof.


THE Emperour with his counsel having ordered acc
ding to the rule of justice, the accom∣plishment of the Proc
ss of 
Erastus,
 and having left the 
x
cution thereof to the Principal of the Senate, 
e r
s lved to leave 
Rome
 for a breathing while, and 
ivert h
mself without troubling his head as he

 with the complain
s of the Empress on the one side, and the orations of the P
ilosophers on the o
her side: for the great iniur

s Castles with
ut the City, in a place ob
cure and 
ecluded, from the noise of people, where he intended to rest himself for some con
evient time. In the mean time the Empress (minding nothing but the joyful newes of the death of Prince 
Erastus
) was inform'd 
hat instead of the ex
cu
i
n of the Prince, the Philoso∣phers had so man
ng'd the matter, that it was gene∣rally believed that the Prince would escape the dan∣ger in which he was involv'd, since the wh
le pro∣ceeding was left to the dispose of the senate, amongst whom there was not a Senator who was not extrem∣ly grived at the death of their y
ung Prince; every one desiring the continuance of his honour, and well being. This m
ss
g
 was no sooner deliverd but she had informati
n by another, of the departure of the Emperour, wh
 had left 
Rome
 without maki

a
n
ed

 departure was de∣signed for the delivery of her son, and that he 
ad done this on purpose that the E

 so near∣ly, assuring you that the grief I have take
 and still retain after this fact pr
ceed princi
ally from this that your honour is as much interested a
 min

 E
 
that Traytor, an act be∣coming so worthy in Emperour as your self: for we find i
 
story that there hath been Emperours who ra∣ther then dev
te from right and equity, have l
id a∣side all Fatherly 
ff
ction and become the ex cu
oners of their own 
hildren as 
ight and justice did require: the same you were willing to show at the begining; but by so much your reputation encreas'd as you were willing severely to give place to justice, by so much are you to be blamed by your womanish indulgence and levity, which 
ns by every w
ndy 
able of those seven Ph
losophers, who by their g
ilded counte
feit expres∣sions toss you 
ee and 
ro as chaff bef

 Emp

nce p 
ou
ce
 by the Emperour himself or by his P
l

 retarded as this is now? Or w
ich is worse the s

lf repeal'd. How comes it that your 
udgement and counsel is so purblind as to order and es
ab
 
h one th
g of which afterwards you are convi
ed to 
h
 contrary. In short, the infamy and reproach
 labour 
 so great,

 that I am almost distracted and had rather have not a being in the world, then to be involv'd in so much trouble as I am. Amongst the rest of my reproaches I see one without an end, for put the case that filial af∣fection should move a heart mild and low as yours seems to be, yet it is a thing dissentaneous to a couragious and a constant soul, and such a heart befits an Empe∣rour who casting behind him all affection and passion ought solely to regard what Justice doth require; now for you to leave me without making me acquainted therewith argueth my presence is displeasing, and that you hate me for loving you too well. And if it be so, (for othe
wise it cannot be) you know you will hate alwayes; however I love you as a
d
ntly absent or pre∣sent; and shall 
dvise you by Letters (since I can∣not do it by word of mouth) of any thing I shall know tending to the prejudice of your welfare and repose: and although I know it is to little purpose having so lit∣tle credit for my advertisements, (how true so ever) yet y
u will l
nd your car to others who propound nothing but what is dangerous interwoven with pain∣ted 
n
 p
rnicious sophistry.


However
 I 
shall d
harge my conscience, being well assu
'd that in the end you will know all my sayings tend to no oth
r end then the conserv
tion of your life and honour; a
d on the contrary what others say o
ly aim at the utter ruine and destruction of them both: as it hapned to a 
reasurer of an
 Egyptian 
King a man 
veral or rather profuse who might have liv'd quietly and peaceably, had he believ'd the counsel of his wife; but instead thereof dyed miserably fol∣lowing

 the disordersd Dictates of his Son, to the great prejudice of his poor wife, and per∣petual infamy; as you will see in this short dis∣course here under written, to the end that by informing your judgement with matter suitable to this purpose, you may from thence gather what is best to be done, taking a b
tter re∣solution in this affair, than hitherto I have known.


In former times there was a King in 
Egypt
 very rich, both in Silver and Gold, as were all the Antient 
Ptolomies:
 But this man so abounded in money, that he was continually making it up in great heaps or piles.


This King had amongst other Officers of his house two Treasurers; one whereof was very liberal, and such as became a servant to so great a King; Notwithstanding the other Treasurer was miserable and covetuous and agreable to the Nature of his Master.


This Prince the better to secure his Treasury, built a strong Tower, wherein he laid his Gold and Silver, and gave the key thereof to his co∣vetuous Treasurer strictly commanding him not to meddle or dispose of any of the money with∣out his express order under Hand & Seal.


This Treasurer guarded the Treasury with such circumspect care, that he trusted non
, nay, hardly

 himself to cast an eye there
n. In short, every day he constantly vnited the treasu
y, p
ying into the lo
ks and trying whether any had been compering to break or op
 them in his ab
ence.


The other Treasurer who was prodigal, who had spent all that little money the King had entrusted him, and his own Estate 
ndes: and not content with this he c
uncelled his 
n to the same profuse∣ness, wh
 
 of himself prodigal enough before: head-strong and licentiou
, at length this young m
n 
ecame so profuse, that he spent all that was left of his Fathers, and hi
 Mothers too, in making presents, and giving here and there without regard∣ing how or to whom; in such sort that all was gone, being unable to do as he did before; however he endeavoured what in him lay to follow his former courses; whereupon his Mother reproved him, of∣ten elling him what a great charge she was at in maintaining two daughters which were si
 for mar∣riage, and to what great poverty his prodigality had reduced doth fathe
 and m
ther: yet for all this he g
w 
rie and w
, and never left till he had 
 all, notwithstanding being more hot than 
, in 
e prosecution of expence, and ad∣dr
 
 to hi
 Father, de
ing him to supply h
s 
 and tha
 he might brave it amongst his Aff
c
 
s former
y, and not to be disgraced by them, 
 whic
 
is Father replyed, that he had no∣thing left to supply his excessive charges, adding m
r
 
 
hought all the money in the other Tr
sure 
 not suffice, what treasury it th
 said the 
 to wh
ch question the Father in∣formed the So
 of all that pa
. Certainly said the

 Son the King hath done you great wrong, in put∣ting less confidence in you, than in the other Trea∣surer, wherefore if you will be rull'd by me, serve him as he deserves.


How must this be done said the Father, since I have nothing of his remaining in my hands no, no, said the Son, the cheat 
I
 intend is 
 what you have not in your hands, and the fault shall lye heavy on the shoulder of another. In short, he councelled him to rob the treasury, relating the manner, and how easie it was to effect it so that the cove
 Treasurer should not suspect any thing, though it was usual for him to go often and view the Treasury, see∣ing that the locks were fast, and unviolated, and the doors shut, for there were many belonging to it, the foolish father knew very well the danger of the attempt, however he was desirous of revenging him∣self of that indignity the King had thrown upon him (as he thought) and to satisfie his own ordi∣nate desires and his Sons, and to maintain that rank and quality he had invested himself with (as he thought) by his profuseness: and therefore deter∣mined to follow the evil counsel of his wicked Son, and having prepared instruments for their purpose, he and his Son one night entred into the Tower, where the treasury lay, having sprung a mine, and broken the wall of the Tower, and having loaded themselves with Gold and Silver returned through the Mine they had digg'd, and stoping up the hole, made the Earth plain as it was before, so that their theft might not be perceived, knowing the danger if it was discovered.


By this means returning home, they were very

 jolly and feasted abundantly, resolving to take the same course in a few dayes, if they heard no noise of this their robbery, and 
o fill their bags, that thereby poverty being banish
, they might have for the residue of their lives, where with all to feast it according to former custome.


N
w the ava
itious Treasurer who was more j
al
u
 in the preservation of this Trea
ury, than if it had been his own, let not a day slip wherein he did not visit it: and being entred into that Cham∣ber where the Treasury was, and looking whish
y about him, saw s
veral things displaced, for every thing lay in its proper order, whereupon he instant∣ly su
pected what was already done, and having di∣ligently look
 ab
ut eve
y where, to spy out where an entrance had been made, found out at a corner of the Tower ear
h newly digged: Hereupon ac∣q
nting no person with his design, he entred the Tower alone, with instruments to dig and mind so l
ng till he c
me to the very hole which they had made at the Basis of the Tower, and knew tha hole to b
 
 
lac
 where it was not usual for any person to be 
g 
 s he m
sed a while, considering what was b
 
o be done, at length concluded to say no∣thing but studied whether it was possible to en∣trap the Thieves by silence. Whereupon having m
de a gr
at Ch
ldr
n, abought the height of a man filled it full of Pitch, Bird-lime, and such like st
ff, which mingled together, became so glutinous that it wou
d forceably ret
in any thing put therein: this being done, he laid it as secret y as he could in the hole which gave entrance into the Tower, and having scraped away the earth, he so covered this

 Cauldron or Kettle, and cleansed the pavement that it could not be perceived that any had been there since the prodigal Treasurer and his Son; who hearing no noise about the money they had stolen, and concluding for certain that the covetuous Trea∣surer had no mistrust of any thing, resolved to pro∣secute their enterprize, and to carry away more mo∣ney than they had done before, and to that end, made choice of a night very dark, without the least glimmering light of the Moon, and so went to the place where was the mouth of the mine; the Father went first, as best knowing the way, just as he came to the hole of the wall, where he was to enter th
 Tower, he fell into the Cauldron and was so fastned on every side, that he could not stir, and presently concluded it a plot for his surprize, and therefore ad∣monisht his Son to withdraw instantly, lest he should be entangled like himself. Whereepon his Son askt him what was the matter, to which the Father re∣plyed; I am dead take you no care of my life, but of my honour, for should I be taken in this thieving plight, infamie will attend my name for ever, the Son would have endeavoured to assist his Father, but that the Father told him it was impossible to take him out of the Cauldron alive, besides should 
 come to help him, he would be in danger of be∣ing caught himself. What must be done the
 said th
 Son? for the safe-guard of my honour & thine owne said the Father: since there is no reme∣dy, cut of my head, to the end they may not know my body & that the name of our family may not be de∣fam'd, the Son hearing this, thought it very strange

 that he should be his Fathers executioner, but con∣sidering with himself that of two evils the least is to be chosen, resolv'd to execute the command of his Father, and comming to the brim of the Cauldron saw him shrunk up to the Arm pits, ir∣recoverably, than taking him by the hair of the head with his left hand rais'd him, and with a Scy∣meter in his right severed his head from his body; after this having enter
'd the head in a secreet place, not to be found, he returned home all bloody to his house, where with sighs and tears related the whole matter to his Mother, beseeching her to take all in good part, and to hinder his Sisters from crying, for that would be a mean
 of discovering what as yet is hidden to the world, the poor woman hearing this sad news began to weep, tearing her hair, and cur∣sing her i
 fortune with the prodigality and disobe∣dience of her Son, who would never hearken to her advice, now blam
ing the extravagancies of her Husband, then condemning the insufferable pro∣fuseness of her Son, and having thus a long while de∣plored her condition, the began to consider that the advice of her Son was not impertinent to avoid the great evil that might follow the contrary, and therefore threw her self on a bed, tormenting her self, and lamenting all the 
ight. The day follow∣ing the Treasurer according to his Custome, went to see the Chamber of the Treasury, and to see whether any was taken in the Cau dron; where coming he saw before the Cauldron the earth all covered with blood, the which amaz'd him much, considering di∣ligently the whole, and looking into the Cauldron, he saw a body without a head, at which he knew he

 had not lost his labour and de
g
, for he though
 to have taken the Thief alive, and consequently have recovered the Gold and Silver he had lost, and i
 may be more to boot. In the mean time he essayed by all means to take c
gn zance of the body, the which he removed out of the Cauldron by the help of fire, and notwithstanding could discover nothing because his stature was low, nor from his garments being all so be daubed with Pitch and Bird∣lime. Hereupon the Treasurer resolv'd to inform the King of all that past; upon which it was conclu∣ded that the body of the Thief should be dragg'd by two horses through every street with a Trumpet, before and at every house the Cryer should pro∣claim, this is the body of that traytrous Thief, that rob'd the Kings treasury, intending thereby to have cognizance of the fact, his relations being unable to contain their tears at so sad a spectacle; and in∣deed it was a very good project for that purpose, if the Son had not prevented it by another wicked act; for the body being drawn through most of the streets it came at length against the house of its abode, at sight whereof his Wife and Daughter could not re∣frain from weeping and lamenting as soon as they heard the cry, 
this is the body of that traiterous Theif who robbed the Kings treasury:
 hereupon a Justice ran instantly to the house of this thieving Treasurer, thinking to find what they fought for; but the villanous Son who was wary took suddain∣ly a hatchet, and therewith g
sht his Mothers leg, before which he laid a l
g of wood, and threw, down the hatchet all bloody on the ground; the Justice being entred the house, enquired of the Mo∣ther,

 and her daughters the occasion of their weep∣ing and wailing; with sighs and tears they answered, do you not see Sire how that poor Woman, who is our Mother is cut grievously, her leg being almost off, by endeavouring to cut that log in peices, and therefore it is no wonder, if we who are her Children grieve and take on for her, having just grounds to fear she will loose her leg; you were better said the Justice go and help her, than cry and lament her, and so took his leave, without affecting any thing ima∣gining all true they told him. Some little time after the poor Mother, who was thus wounded in the leg fell into a feaver which depriv'd her of life, leaving her Son richer in villany then he was before, having with his own hand, kill'd both Father and Mother. God grant Sir, the like befall you not, for certainly I am much afraid hereof, and that you will be redu∣ced to the same danger, that this Treasurer fell into, and as it is an honest woman that gives you this ad∣vice for your benefit, so I shall never desist to tell you sincerly, and in pure verity whatsoever I shall understand; and be not angry, that I put you in mind of your duty. The Treasurer followed the evill counsell of his Son, and so lost his honour, and his life by the hand of him, who should have given him his best assistance; do you also follow the counsell of your fine Philosophers, who to have the mannagment of affairs, to rule and govern the world at their pleasure, thinking of nothing but the installing of their Disciple in your Imperiall seat, to the hazard of your life, and loss of honour. The Son of the Treasurer remained rich, after the death of his Father and Mother, whom he slew with his own hand; I fear 
Erastus
 will serve you in like manner, in

 such sort that we shall be in danger of life and ho∣nour, unles
 you open the eyes of your understand∣standing, the which 
I
 beseech and exhort you to; if my supplications move you not, let this danger wh
h hang
 over your head, and the Imperial dignity which you now possess, perswade you to it? Beseeching you to pardon me, if I off
nd you in saying the tr
 h for the love and sinceer aff
ction which I bear to you, and the faith 
I
 owe you, constrains me thereto, and so I bid you heartily farewell.


This Letter being fin
sht and well desig
'd, she call∣ed to her, one of her Bed-Chamber in whom she put great tru
t; commanding him to go and find out the Emperour with all dilligence, and deliver that night the Letter to the Emperour, assuring him there was matter of great importance therein contained, and that he should instantly read it, and return an answer the same night, and so bring it her the next morning as soon a
 it was ligh
. The Messenger having re∣ceived his dispatch from the Empress, so speedily executed her commands, that though the day was fa
 spent, and the place where the Emperour was, being remote from 
Rome,
 yet he arrived at his journey end before Sun-set, & having found the Emperour alone, delivered him the Letter, which he h
d received from the Empress; who reading it over & over again, and weighing well the contents thereof, all 
m
z d as he was, returned an answer imeadiately 
n the place, to the Empress, excusing himself for his sudden depar∣ture from 
Rome,
 assuring her it was not because he would revoake the sentence pronounced against 
Erastus,
 but onely to delay it for a wh
le; and find∣ing that these de ays were taken 
ll by her, he wo
l
 forthwith proceed to the execution of the sen


 be soon as she pleased: for knowing the sentence to be just, without any other forme of process it should 
e executed; referring all to the disposal of the Em∣press, commanding the Messenger to inform the 
ffi∣cers of Justice to do with 
Erastus
 as the Empress should command them.






CHAP. XVI. Philantropus
 the Philosopher deferr'd the execution of 
Erastus
 by a discourse which he made the Em∣perour of a young Grecian Damsel, who was given in mar
iage to a young strange Gentleman whom sh
 loved by the hands of her own Husband, who was both old and 
 al
rs.


THE Empress having received the Letter of the E
perour, was the most satisfied person in the Wor d; s
eing tha
 the execution of 
Erastus
 was re∣mitted to her d scretion; wherefore not to loose time, fearing 
me accident might happen which sh uld in
pt her design as formerly; she encour∣aged the Officers of justice to a 
p
edy execution: but F
rtune was so favourable to Prince 
Erastus,
 that the J
dges seeing the Emperour departed, and by that means having time to consider of their own b
siness, w
re g
ne some here some there in order to the settlement of their particular affairs. The Philo∣sophers

 in the mean time had the opportunity to consult about what the Emper
ur had concluded on the day before, hoping that the seven 
a
al dayes which threatned the death of 
E
astrs
 w
re as good as past, since there were but three 
 c
me, yet notwith∣standing they were not well 
ssured here of being in continual fear, seeing that the Heavens and every thing from whence they might divi
e, and know things to come, demonstrated their Disciple in dan∣ger of death; moreover that which augmented their fear was the secret threats of the Empress 
Aphrodi∣cia,
 of which they were continually inform d, for inded they had good spyes in her house, some of the principal of her Bed-chambe
, by whom they were adver
sed, that the fore-going night she had sent to the Emperour, one of h
r Bed-chamber in great haste, whereupon imagining what she might effect thereby, they consulted how to frustrate her de∣signs against 
Erastus.
 In short the same night where∣in they understood the menaces of the Empress, they left 
Rome
 and were so speedy that before break of day they arrived, where the Emperour was about to rise, who being troubled all night about the Let er of the Empress, arose in great rage as soon a
 he saw them, and being much troubled, said what come yee here to do, and with what presumption dare 
ou ap∣pear before him, whom you have so much injur'd; assuring them that if he had no more regard to his own quality (which nothing should provoke to an∣ger) than their deserts he would h
ng them all seven but he ass
red them that they should not go
 
g un∣punished, for assoon 
s 
Erastus
 should be disp
 ac∣cording to order, he told them their 
nto must be

 next, causing the rigour of justice to make them ex∣emplary, according to their villany and treason, for m
king him the most miserable and unfortunate man of the Earth, instead of a happy and triumphant Emperour; having constrained him to kill ignomini∣ously by the hand of justice, the Son of his own loyns from whom he expected comfort and assistance, whch' had come to pass, if instead of betters and goodman∣ner
 (whom they ought to have instructed therein) they had not perverted his nature, disdaining hitherto to speak to his father; but on the contrary had in∣cited him to vitiate her, whom he ought to call Mo∣ther; concluding that the matter should not go after this manner. The Philosoph
rs hearing the saying of the Emperour, a
d understanding the conclusion which he had made with the S
ate was reverst, and that he had made new provision for the death of 
E∣rastus,
 they were so troubled, that they had no more to say to the Emperour, then if they had been stab'd to the heart: however knowing that th
ir business required expe
ition, they w
th unwilling to l
ose time in their 
 j
stification; b
t resolved to pro∣secute the case of 
E
astus.
 Wher
 
o
 
Philantropus
 who undertook to speak for 
Eras
us
 his day, and who of all others, was a perso
 most Gentle and complaisant (following in his actions the crymo∣logy of his name (began to speak in this manner Sir, if you have been so dilligent in the informing your self, concerning the truth of the fact, alledged against 
Erastus
 and as you have been too cre∣dulous, so if you be to rash in Judging, I shall not take the boldness to speak the least word in his de∣fence: But since 
I
 am so well assured of the chastity

 of the young Prince, I think it is impossible for him so to let loose the reins to his disordered desires as to commit a fault so foul as this: however I shall of∣fer this to your Judgment, which I kn
w by experi∣ence and must spe
k for him, although you condemn not onely him, but these Sages, also my comp
ni
ns not onely worthy of that death you have ordained, but a punishment much greater. But knowing and understanding that in th
s ca
e you are only g
vern'd by the sole p
rswasion of a S
mple woman, and being inform'd else where in History; as w
ll antient as modern, of the great passions to which women are in∣clin'd, and principally those which l
y a constraint on all, but what their appetites do dictate to them; hence 
I
 conclude, whatever you have heard of 
Era∣stus
 are onely fables, and do not wonder Sir, if you are deceived by a woman, for you are not the fi
st, and shall not be the last; for women will not only re∣duce us to believe what is possible as in this, but things that are altoge
her impossible, as it happened to a Gentlemen of 
Greece,
 Governer of 
Morocco,
 who was so deluded by his wife (whom notwith∣standing he loved better then his life) that with his own hand, he give her in marriage to a strang Gentle∣man whom she loved, thinking it was some other. Let me see said the Emp
rour how can that b
? I will tell you Sir, said the Philosopher, not doubting to have as good success from my disc
urse, as my com∣panions have had from thei
; and thereup
n be∣gan to spe
. Not long si
ce, there was a Gentle∣man in 
Greece,
 whose name 
I
 shall not tell, b c
use I know h
 w
ll; and the accident wh
ch befell him, cannot be intruth imputed to him any sottery or

 folly of hi
, but chiefly to the disasters of fortune, who takes delight to trouble and interrupt the de∣signs of men, and chiefly of th
se who not onely study to g
vern their own course of life, but that of oth
rs, 
ndeavouring to shew in that respect a greater st
ck of prudence th
n other m
n: B
t 
 return to our Gentleman, who was of a good and antient fami∣ly, and every where esteemed a mighty m
n, not on∣ly for the great estate his Father left him▪ but for the Lands and Lord-ships, he had purchased by his own industry; at leng
h he purposed to marry thinking himself a happy man, if he could procure a w
fe b
th fair and honest too; and certainly it had not happen∣ed ami
s, if the thing had fallen 
 as he desired; but 'tis very seldom (I will not say never) that beauty and honesty l
dge together. With a dilligent eye he sought after a beauty that might be call'd a None such or a N
n p
rcill, resolving to marry one that was pleasant and of a good grace; in some few months he found out what he desired, and cho
se her for his wife, who was very pleasing to his eye, and whom he loved as his life. In the intervall, the Deputies of 
Greece
 having a very good oppinion of this Gen∣tlem
n, whom by experience they found wife and ac∣complisht, established him in th
 g
vernment of 
Mo∣rocco;
 and thereupon b
ing constrained to retire to h
 g
v
nment he took with him his wife, whom he c n 
ou
d having so intirely, that he became jealous in s
ch sort, that he abridg
 himself of that liberty he took in d
v
r
 sing h
m
elf at Fe
stivalls am
ng his ass
cia
s, and the company of G
ntlewomen; and not sat 
fied with that, he 
et a g
d 
ver her of such as 
e most 
usted, watching her himself and en∣deavouring

 to find out what he could, either in what she did or said; knowing f
r cer ain that it is hard, nay, imp
ssible almost, to guard that which every one covets; for the more he loved 
, and 
he m
re lovely she appear
d in his eye, the more he thought she was b
lov
d by every one, an
 
hat 
he was 
∣tempting to all, as she 
 to him; 
aving be
n thus tormented for some time, instead of fin
ing any 
a
e he g 
w worse and w
rse, whether i
 w
s becaus
 no mistr
sted hi
 g
rdians he had plac
d over his wife, whom he feared might be bribed to treachery; or whether he revolv'd in his thoughts the great de u∣sion
 women put upon their husbands, pretending to be blind when they have, or would have as many 
y
 as 
Argus,
 o
 whether he had seen some thing him∣self, he did not well aprove of. Hereupon being un∣willing to trust any, and being unable always to ob∣se ve and watch her himself, by reason of business 
e was continually employed in, he fell into the great∣est melancholly th
 could be, still considering how he might assure himself, that she might not cast a wanton eye, or bestow her love 
n any b
 him
elf. Now he had a very fair and high T
w
r 
n a corner of the Castle wherein he lived, which wa
 built ra∣ther for ornament than streng h; herein this Gentle∣man pi
eh
 upon a Chamber for himself, the most commodious for h
s design; and having pain
ed and adorn'd it, so that there was nothing to be seen but the glittering of Gold, he res lved to enclose his wife therein & not to let her but, but on some certain days in the y
a
; in sh r
 he perf ct
d his de
ig
 & 
s it were, put his wife in prison. As to the 
 the doors which must give him inlet where his wh
 was were many in number (for there was ten doors to

 pass through) he carried them always abent him, and would not trust them with any body. Hereupon the Gentlewoman grieved, and lamented sadly, not so much for being enclosed, as for the little confidence her husband had in her. All her tears availed nothing, f
r she could not be s
t at liberty, till the arrivall of some Feastivals, which in all were but four in the year, and but two of them neither, properly belong∣ed to the Damsell; doubtlessly she had a great mind to make an escape, and therefore employed all the faculties of her mind to that purpose; but her guards about her, and the little assistance she saw she had, be∣sides her husbands having a continual watchful eye upon her, frustrated her design. Now as we said be∣fore, this Damsel was a very great beauty, and the same thereof, which spread it self all there about was much greater: For which cause a young Gentleman (of whom 
I
 shall speak more at large anon) forsook his own house, to put something on fact, he should think most requisit. In process of time fortune or love brought it to pass, that it happened that a strange Gentleman who had a Father very rich arrived at the Matropolis of 
Morocco
 where having lived a while, there happened one of these solemn annuall Feastivals which invited him to go and see their publick sports, which were usually performed on those days, to de∣light the people, where being come, & and consider∣ing every thing, 
t leng
h he saw the arrivall of the Governers wi
e, to whom every one gave place, and shew'd their reverance, as well for that rank sh
 held in Magistracy, as for her excellent deportment, & in∣comparable beauty, which was then accompanied with rich accoutrem
n
 and so many gr
ces, wh ch d
zled the eyes of the spectators. All these were suffici
nt not

 only to force all to give place, & 
o give her honour & respect so great was her beauty, & so lovely & bleig∣ing was her behaviour. Oposite to the Chair which was prepared for her was placed a Scaffold, in which were windows to look out on the place, where the sports were solemniz
d. Hereupon the strange Gen∣tlemen taking notice thereof, adv
nced in good time to bargain with the Master of the Scaffold for a place, which was so dear that very few people were there; so that the Gentleman had the opportunity to sit un∣crowded & and at his case, for the accomplishment of what ever he designed. In fine, having his eyes con∣tinually fixt on the Governe
s & considering her brave behaviour with gestures all divine was presently cap∣tivated by love, so that his internall passions (wh ch afflicted his mind) constrain'd him to manifest by out∣ward signs, that which was contain'd within his breast if any there had taken notice; but every one had his eyes so busied, that his passion wa
 not discovered, fortune being than very favourable, especially in this the that damsel looking now here, now there, at last cast her eyes upon the young Gent. whom finding in a good ga
b & gesture, she amorously glanced her eyes upon him, & he on her, so that the glances which past between these lovers, had in a little time so absolutly disposed of the heart of this Gentlewoman, that she shew'd as much satisfaction in the friend-ship of this Gent. as he shewed affection for her service. Now that which incited her to consent easily, to the friend∣ship of this Gent. was her hopes by his means, to be freed out of Prison; forgeting all the difficulties she formerly found for her deliverance. The sports being finisht, the people began to with-draw, so did these new two lovers, fixing their eyes on each other, as f
r

 as their eyes could reach. In the mean time the Gent. f
llowed at a distance, even to the Castle-walls; the Dam
e
 b
g en
o
d, the poor Gentleman which was lef
 without, than fel
 those pains which are in∣c
n
 
o 
v
rs, nor w
s the Gentlewoman insensi∣ble there
f, f
r b
th the one and the other having no other ben
fit than the glance of an eye, nor ha∣v
ng no assurance of one anothers friendships, had less hopes of ever conferring together; for the Gentlewoman was assured of being made close pri∣soner as soon as she entred the Castle, and so it hap∣ned. N
w the Gentleman who had heard some∣
ng 
quired diligently how the matter stond, in the mean time the Gentlewoman w
pt and bewail'd her c ndition in prison, tha
 she had found so sweet a Gentleman, who on the contrary despised that li∣berty he enjoyed and w sh
 himself the happiness to be with her, under the same constraint, and both of them employ'd their whole time in contriveing w y
s now i
 succour and rel eve one another: a∣b ut this 
ffair they consumed a great deal of time, hav
ng no other remedy than to d
ssemble, in the mean time that which at present they could not ob∣tain. Hereup
n the strange Gen leman gave out that h
 was come to inhabit in this City pretending he had i
 
 
is own Count
y upon a very lawful ac∣count, ariseing from a q
arrel in which he had slain a G
ntlema
, 
nd that he m
g
 frankly do, because his Father was dead who had left him a consider h
 estate, by which means he could frolick and p
 away the time with other Gen lemen of the Cit
, who esteemed much and caressed high this strange Gentleman; for he ob
iged them to expenc
 by pay∣ing

 all the reckoning, hoping enough to do it; by this manner of feasting one anothe
, in a little time he came acquainted with the Governour. Now to the intent he might be lodged nearer the Castle, and to have better access to Court, he bought him a state∣ly house, very near and just facei
g the Tower, fur∣nishing it with very rich T
p
stry which he had brought out of his own Country; in which he o
ten essayed to treat the Governour, and with him to pass away the t
me therein pleasantly; 
n such 
or
 that for the most part he was not looked on as a stranger but a Courtier or a Citizen. This Gentleman besides his other accomplishments, was much delighted 
n arms, for he was a great Traveller, and had been in the service of a King of Greece, who du
g life had justly for him a very great esteem; after whose death be returned home, looking on it as an unglori∣ous thing to live the life of a Souldier, being so rich for that service which he had undertook, he did not for necessity, but to exercise himself in honour∣able exploits and employments. Being accustomed as aforesaid, to the exercise of arms, it hopned that a solemn day drew near, of wh
ch 
e was joyful, and particularly having understood that 
here would be a Turnament with Lances, for the delight and satis∣faction of the Ladyes; whereup
n without delay, or furnisht himself with Lance and Arms, and with every thing requisi
 for that purpose, with such secrecy that none knew it but himself, and one con∣fident, and the better to carry on his enterprize, he re
oved his furniture from his lodging, and had c
ningly bought a very brave horse in another name. The day of justing being come (which

 seem'd the day of re
urrect
on to the poor Prisoner, and to the young Gentleman) who had counted the hours and minutes, to the time wherein he should appear before his Mistr
s, he there made himself known her N
ighbour, & yet he was nearer to her in hear: than in habitation, now as he past he bowed, & lid-elongcast an amorou
 glance, receiving the like re∣ciprocal glance from his Mistress. In short, having eyed her all the way he went to his place of standing, and thinking she would excuse him, if he was less lavish of h s amorous glances, since there was so ma∣ny eyes upon them, he hasted to his post or place ap∣pointed, to be armed, and being arm'd from head to foot in white armour, he came to the course with a Lance all silver'd over, both thicker and larger than customary, having his head-price crested with a black and white Plume of Feathers, answering the the colours of his Horses caparison; under the Helmet there was a Corsset of Beass, out of which issued a little smoak, denoting the fire that was hid∣den within, with a scrole whereon was written in Letters of Gold these words, 
'Tis hard to hide a flame.
 This devise was thus invented by him, to ma∣ny rest that aff
ct
on which was known to very few: every one began to reg
rd from head to foot this br
ght Cavaleer, one saying this, another that, yet every one mistaken, for this Gentleman had his Vi∣z
r down to able 
nd himself from knowledg, but e∣v
ry one might kn
w his horse by reason of his great Caparison. To a
k his name was a
 great an i
 civi∣lity, as m
desty to conceal it; after several Lances broken by the Gentleman who en
ered the L
sts, a
 this Gentleman stranger was willing to break his, a

 Herold at Arms arriv'd and proclaimed in the behalf of the defendants, that all Gentlemen assailants have∣ing won the victory, of the defendants, should have for their prize a Chain worth 300 Crowns; but on the contrary if they had the worse, to give them the like, or be the defendants Prisoners. On a sudden the white Cavalleer elevated his Gantlet, in token he accepted the chall
nge with its conditions wherein (to be short) he behaved himself so well that he won the Chain, having past his Lance against the head of his antagonist. The second defendant, he so briskly charg'd, that he made his head kiss the Pommel of his Saddle. This made every one amazed, for every one held these two defendants the most valliant and couragious Cavalleers in all 
Morocco,
 as indeed they were and having besides conquered many other Gent∣leman and carried off in token of victory many small Chains and perfumed Gloves, and having sustained many a shock with Gallantry of Spirit, all the whole assembly remained astonisht. Yet every one eager∣ly desired to know who was this Cavalleer who had so admirabley behav'd himself in the Turnaments: but above all the Governour had a Great affection who earnestly besought him to make himself known for the honour of nobility, to the end that the accu∣mulation of praises which he had merited, might not vanish in the aire. Whereupon the Gentleman turn∣ing his face to the Governess, who without saying any thing shew'd by a sign that she was desirous to know this Cavalleer (for women are more affected with curosity than men) hereupon the Cavalleer put∣ting up his vizier? see here 'tis 
Fabio
 (for so he was called) your friend and servant.


This being observ'd by all, there was a general

 amazement seized the whole Company, and chiefly those who before thought him a man more fit for pleasure than for Action, The day being far spent, a retreat was sounded to put an end to the Tourne∣ment, and the white Cavaleer was accompanied with Drums and Trumpets towards his Lodging, still pre∣tending to treat one and another, staying in the street till the Governess should pass that way, who was at∣tended with an honourable retinue; to whom he made a profound reverance without as to the wife of the Governour, but within, as to his dearest friend, and having received the like from her, with a joyfull countenance he reteuned to his own habitation, where after he had paid those respects due to the honour was done him, he then began to ruminate on his love concerns, and how he should accomplsh them, in which considerations he found many and great diffi∣culties: how ever like a true Lover, finding nothing impossible, after a long consultation with himself, he dispatcht his servant whom (he could confidently trust) to fetch him a Master Mason, which was a stranger, and very skilful in his Art, such a one was brought him in a short time, whom this Gentleman treated so generously well, that he became absolutely his creature, sealing up his mouth with a world of presents he gave him, adding with all threats if he discovered the design, so that it was buried between them three, the Master, Servant, and Mason; the latter of whom began to set his hands to work to e∣very thing he was commanded, and that was to spring a Mine under the foundations of the Tower where the Damsel was, with as little noise as might be, to which the Gentleman lent his assistance very fre∣quently in digging and carrying out the earth,

 continuing their labour, in a little time they under∣mined the Tower without the least discovery. Here∣upon the Gentleman discovered to the Mason his re∣solution of mounting into the Chamber of the Dam∣sel; to which the Mason gave him admission, as well by reason of his long experience in such matters, as by reason of the advantage of the Winding stairs, which were in the said Tower; by which means it was very easie to ascend into the Chamber of the Damsel; yet there were several impediments in the way, however the Mason found out other ways to ascend, listning to the Walls if any one took notice, at length they arriv'd at the floore of the Chamber, or rather prison of the Damsel; not knowing now what to do but to trust in fortune, and leave the issue of all to her guidanc
, intending not to pass further as yet for fear of inconveniencie, resting there & hoping in a little time to have some beetter opportunity sub∣miting his passion to reason which ought to govern in all such matters and respects: Upon the approach of a solemn festival, the Gentleman was not unmind∣ful of putting an end to his enterprize, and having gi∣ven out that he was extreem sick and that he could not go to see the publ
ck sports, much less take plea∣sure in them, & the D
msel being releast for that day to go and see them; this Gentleman 
Fabio
 said to the Mason; Master this opportunity will not admit us to loose time, for this is the day whe
ein we ought to esteem our selves no less happy (every thing favour∣ing us) then 
Deucalion
 and 
Phyrrha
 after the Deluge, so that for any one to loose one single minute of this opportunity were to hate himself, & provoke the Gods. Hereupon the Master and the servant immea∣diately

 furnisht themselves with instruments, and o∣ther things requisite for their purpose, and having past the Mine they had made, they arriv'd at the place they desired, where being come they searcht round a∣bout and at last found out in a little time a hole big enough for a man to enter, at that very corner where stood the bed of the Damsel, according as the Master Mason had contriv'd with the assistance of the God of love. The Gentleman being entred the Chamber (whilst the Mason and servant were regar∣ding the hole, how to return again another time with out discovery) he regardful lookt about the Cham∣ber, wherein he saw a little box lying open (for it had no key, which which was made in the form of a little Press to contein Clothes, wherein were rich habilliments which he would not disorder, as well by reason he had no leisure, as that he might not be dis∣covered; notwithstanding having found a place (at he thought, were the Damsel was accustomed to lay her hand at her return he resolved there to leave some signal of his entrance, which however was so obscure, that though any other should see it by chance, he should not gather any thing from it, and so left this following 
Madrigall,
 which some days before he had composed in manner of a Riddle.




Madrigal.


Madam ther's one hath vow'd to be


Your Captive whom you know not;


And though you are within a tye,


Hath sworn to break the knot:


And this I do to move your heart,


But let not eyes or heart with grief




Be troubled for what's done


Love hath consulted your relief,


When I the victory won


And acted then a Lovers part;


And will do still and must do more,


'Tis he that come from forreign shore,


Will serve you with his hand and heart




The Gentleman having laid this 
Madrigal
 where he purposed, returned to the Mason, desiring him to dispatch what he had begun; so that all being descen∣ded, and the Gentleman seeing all things as he would have it, had some thoughts of killing the Mason to assertain the non discovery of his plot, but mov'd with compassion, he changed his intention, and giving him many presents he caus'd him to embark the same day, and leave 
Morocco.
 In the mean time the Dam∣sel being entred her Hermitage, she tumbled over some things she had, amongst which she sound the 
Madrigal,
 which she read and read again and again, thinking and rethinking of the interpretation there∣of, how it could be laid there, and what should the issue be thereof, in sine she gathered who it should be that layed it there, but could not collect by what means it could be left; and at last concluded it must be done by Nicromancy; for in those days there were many Witches, and many put confi∣dence in them. Whilst she was in these strange imaginations supper time, and consequently that of bed time drew near, and so she went to bed, not with an intent to sleep but to be vigilant to the intent she might see the issue of this doub
ful

 matter. At length the night being far Spent, and ha∣ving tyred her self with thinking, she was constrain'd to give repose to her senses, and so fell into a sound sleep. Now according to her thoughts awake she saw in a dream what afterwards hapened; for she thought she saw him who had so much eyed her before & she him, was on the battlements of the Castle bewailing himself by reason of those impediments and obstructi∣ons, which were laid for the hindering one anothers pleasures; and that then the prison miraclously was opened, and as miraclously shut as soon as he was en∣tred; and that both afterwards fell into great anexi∣ty of minde, she fearing that there was no means left for his going out, and he fear
ng he was surprised for gathering the fruits which belonged to the Master of the house; but whither a truth or a dream, it was ve∣ry true that during the time of her dreaming, the Gentleman who had tarried some while from coming that he might not affright the D
msel, entred at last softly through the hole into the chamber of the dam∣sel, and coming 
e
r the bed perceiv
d that she knew nothing, and s
 s
d these few words: Mad
, 
I
 
m he that am wholy yours, to whom ye
erday fortune was so favourable as to h
ve the means to make known to you in wri
ng, the main end of all my in∣tentions is onely to love you, as you may well g
th
r by signs in my way & by my eyes in th
 publick pass times; to be brief it is 
I
 that am l
dg'd so near this Tower, for no other purpose, but to employ my life in your service, if you please to accept of my indea∣vours, and finally to deliver you from this thral dom. The damsel at first seemed astonisht; however as well

 for fear as desire she had to understand the sequel of this business, kept her mouth shut, but her ears open to the saying of the Gentlemen; whose request being well understood, & unwilling to shew her self harder than a stone, and being more unwilling to the ruine of the Gentleman, and much more of her self; thinking it withal an Act of Piety to preserve those who love us, became at length inclinable to pitty, and resolved to entertain him, whereupon without further loss of time they both addrest themselves for the gathering of loves fruits; and to make manifest the Riddle, thinking of nothing else but the perpetuity of their pleasure; advising the best way how they should meet often together.


This story here inserted, Sir, it tends much to our purpose, and those also who have endeavoured to know women; but principally those many Hypo∣crites, which makes profession of being half Saints. This Damsel of whom we speak, Sir, not induring to be lock't up under the guard of her Husband, (who we may presume had good reason to be careful of that he valued above every thing;) was resolved for a long time to be revenged of him, and so seeing occasion offer it self, she greedily laid hold thereon; not only to save 
nd deliver her self, but also to con∣clude the detriment and confusion of the poor inno∣cent; and so having taken her pleasure many nights with her friend, she resolved to forsake her Husband, and cleave to this young Gentleman, and that with much subtlety, so that she was pr
s'd, and her old man blam'd. In the mean time her friend visited he
 often, and she desirous to come to that end the Gen∣tleman propounded, without regarding any thing bu


 the present she spake to him in these words; my friend 
I
 know you are valiant and that you hear me great affection, wherefore it is requisite that you en∣terprize something in which I shall have the greatest charge, to the intent that if any thing happen contra∣ry to our design which 
I
 hope, the whole may be im∣puted to me, and no other; and that you may not perplex your brain, I will undertake the particular management.


In the first place tomorrow morning going to Court you shall wear on your finger one of the rings of my Musty Husband, which 
I
 shall give you, and so order the basiness, that he may see it on your fin∣ger, and I doubt not but imm
diately he will know it to be his own, in such sort 
hat he will aske you, whence you had it; to which you must answer that you have had it a long time, say no more, but come straight aw y to me, and give me the ring again, after∣wards I shall informe you how things proceed. Day breaking (which constrained the Gentle-man to de∣part) the Damsel gave him the good morrow, putting the ring on his singer wi h which the Gentleman de∣rected his course towards the Governour, and had no soon
 perf
med hi
 
beisance towards him, bu
 that the G
vern u
 saw that which netled h
m to see, and although he dissembled the knowledg o
 what of that which was too true, yet he could not but fix his eyes a long time thereon, and to shew by some strange gestures that he was not well pleased; in such manner that many of the attendants desired to know the reason of this suddain change; but 
he presently went to the Tower, and was so long in opening the several doors, that the Gentleman who was gone

 before had the opportunity of delivering the ring to her from whence he had it; now the old Dotard ha∣ving found the said ring in the place he desired, rested himself satisfied, and was resolved to lye with her the following night which was accordingly done; of which her friend was advertised by a certain signal given by her, which he finding returned to his lodg∣ing.


The day following the Gentleman seeing all things safe return'd to his accustomed rest, where he and the Damsel had time enough to laugh at the poor old∣man. In fine the Damsel said to the Gentleman; my friend the God of Love hath given us a good be∣ginning to satisfie our selves, and certainly I hope no less of the middle & conclusion, and so for the second tryal, you shall do what I shall tell you, and do but as you did with the ring in which you behaved your self most gallantly. The Gentleman descended from the Tower (after he had received a little 
D
g
 from her which she kept for her pastime,) and went to the Court, carrying with him the little Dog, the Go∣vernour seeing his little dog, was about to have call'd him by his name, but considering the quality of him who held him, and wondering how it was possible for it to be procured, for he saw by all the marks of the dog, that it must be the same, he said not a word but went straight to the Tower, grinding his teeth, and threatning both his wife and Gentle∣man that he had worse dog for them both then they had of his. The young Gentleman turning his back to the Governour disposed of the Dog with as much celerity as he had done with the ring.


The Governour being entred the Chamber

 Chamber of his Wife, and there seeing the little dog, knew not what to say, but believed it might so happen, that two things might be found alike in two different places; and having seen already things like his own, he entertain'd no bad opinion, and le
s jealousie. In the mean time the Gentleman had his full delight with the Damsel; who was desirous to put an end to all; resolving with her Friend about the means they should take to deliver her from this servitude, shewing him the way he should take, and what pretences he must use, and that he must fit a Galley, as swift of sail as he could choose, and that he should place her in some Haven near the City, and pretending that he was in haste to be gone, he should procure some strange H
b
lliments for her, and ha∣ving taken leave of the old Dota
d, they should get aloft with all speed they could, discovering how he had cheated her Husband as he did. The Gentleman descended the Tower, and went to procure the light∣est Galley in all 
Morroco,
 and having victual'd and arm'd her he put her off a little to Sea, the better to abscond his design: after this he subtlely contriv'd womans apparel very rich, but made after a strange manner, the which he laid up in his Chamber, the hour for their design being come, the Damsel remov'd from her Prison that night she knew the Dotard would not come to see her, he conducted her to the Galley which was arrived at the Port that very night∣giving out that it was a strange Galley then come in, and having embarked his Lady, he committed her to the care of his trusty servant, and return'd a shore to perfect his design. Now the Govenour was rilen very early to go a hunting, and seeing 
Fabio,
 desired

 him to make one of the Party, of which he excuse himself, saying to the Governour that he was con∣strained to lay all business aside to return speedily into his own Country. How said the Governour, shall we be deprived of the company of a man so good and honest as you are: whereupon the Gentle∣man replyed that he could be content to stay and see their pa
times, but that he was constrain'd to depart as suddenly as he could, having received the good ty∣dings of the peace his Parents had concluded with those of the Gentleman he had Du
l'd with for wh
ch cause his presence was altogether requisite for the ratifying what had past in his absence, and that he fear'd delay in going might endanger him more than any thing else; the Governour having askt who brought him this news, the Gentleman answer'd to tell you the truth it is my dear Female friend who who alwayes hath confer'd on me her friendship, who being much troubled at my absence, is very de∣sirous of my return, being come in all baste for that purpose, in a Pinnace which arriv'd in the Port this mo
ning at break of day; wherefore I am come ex∣presly to take my leave of you, according to that service and duty 
I
 ever owed you, and to pray you also that you will drink a glass of wine with me in that Vessel which is come on purpose to carry me off; to the intent with better courage I may set sail. The Governour praising much the Cordiality and Friendship of the Damsel which was come to find our 
Fabio,
 promised him to go and dine with him in the Galley, and following his hunting, the young Gentleman in the mean time gave order for dinner after the best manner he could: dinner time being

 come he went before the Governour, with several Gentlemen his friends whom he also c
nducted thither, and being ariv'd near the Port, he began to consider and amongst other things he declared that for the great love he had found in his friend in times past which she had sufficiently dem
nstrated then and now in seeking him out, he resolved forthwith to marry her; beserching the Governour as he had ever found him affectionate to his service that in ac∣knowledgment thereof it would please him to solem∣nize his marriage, and that he might have the happy∣ness to receive a wise from so good a hand as his. The Governour readily agreed to the motion, and being on the strand, a Skiff presently carried them a∣board the Gally, where being come, the Gentleman ordered her to cover her self & to sit next the Go∣vernour who was no stranger but his own wife. At it first was thought by the Governour and all present that she was his w
f
 (as indeed she was) but by reason of her strange habit and her deportment, knowing well how to counterfeit as in the case of the Ring and little Dog, as aforesaid she remained undiscover∣ed. Dinner being ended the young Gentleman spake briskly to the Governour desiring him to bestow his Female servant on his Male, to whi
h the good old man replyed that it was very reasonable, and that he would do much more for his contentment; hereupon taking the Damsel by the hand, he gave her to the young Gentleman in the presence of all the com∣pany; this being done he returned to the Castle; but the Gentleman with his prey, got as far off as he could. The Governour having some little jealousie in his breast, and that which encreast it

 more was the astonishment of the whole company to see a woman so proportion'd like the Governess; in such manner that to clear all doubts, he was no soon∣er arriv'd at the Castle but that he went straight to his Tower, and having unlockt all the doors and search'd up and down, he could not find his wife, at which he was ready to run mad; and not seeing any remdy for this calamity, there being no hopes of o∣vertaking the Gally, which was now a good way at sea, beside the confusion he was in, ei
her to speak or be spoken to, and silling his he
d with a thousand things, he at length fell into dispair unimaginable, & inexpressible, at length a disease seiz'd him, which took him off.


Who think you Sir, was guilty of his death, but his wicked wife: Wherefore all men ought to con∣sider how to govern their wives rightly; for there is nothing more difficult than to divert a woman from what she in
ends? 'Tis true if their, designs were gui∣ded by reason, I should not so much blame their subtleties by which they accomplish their con∣septions, but seeing the imperfection of the Sex, which is more usually guided by passion than reason, I can confidently say that the end of those designs they plot tends ordinarily to mi
chief and danger, as may be seen in the discourse of this our 
Greccian,
 whose 
x∣ample need not go alone for I can instance a thou∣sand more, and I wish to God that the Empress was not rankt among them as I am certain she is, and you your self may easily discover it: Wherefore it is necessary for you to take mature deliberation in this affair without giving more credit to the passions of any other then reason shall require.




The Emperour having given good attention to the Philosophers discourse, thought good to medi∣tate thereon: but although he had no bad opinion of his wife, yet he did abhor to think of the Death of his Son, which could not but be a great vexation to him: although he much desired that Justice might take place, and the affection which he alwayes had to acquire the reputation of a just Prince, and who would not be rash in any affair, and this induc'd him to resolve to stay the execution of his Son, until the case should be more fully and deliberately exam
ned, having understood by so many examples, that all things ought not to be taken for truth, which at the first seem to be so; yet that he might somewhat please the Empress he purposed to return to 
Rome,
 so that by his presence he might shew her some rea∣son for his present delay; and thereupon without any further stay, or giving any other answer to the Phi∣lopher, but that he would take care that justice should be done, he instantly mounted on horse-back that he might the sooner perform his journy to 
Rome,
 where being arrived, he found the Empress very much en∣raged against the Officers of Justice, who being a∣broad upon their particular occasions, had been the cause of prolonging the life of Prince 
Erastus.
 This very well pleased the Emperour, finding it in his power to deliberate in the proceedings about his Son; and therefore he gave command to the Officers to forbear any further proceedings until they had fur∣ther commands from him.

This Story or example may serve to the same purpose as the Former.


There was a wealthy Burgess living in a certain City, who kept a Pye, the Bird he lov'd so well, that he suffered none to feed him but himself, and as he fed him taught him several Languages; this Pye was so apprehensive and grateful to his kind Master, that whatsoever he saw done in the house he told his Master.


This Burgess was married to a young wife, who was much more beautiful than honest, requiting her husbands love and affection with s
ight and disrespect, because he was not a man of that lustful performance she expected, but that she might not want means to satisfie her amorous desires, she made choice of a man fit for her purpose, whom she alwayes sent for when her Husband was abroad about his business, that they might eat deliciously and wantonly toy one with another.


Now the Pye as she told her Master every thing, she observed, upon his return so particularly this junketting wantonness, and was so open mouth'd, as the report hereof did spread it self through the whole City, her Husband hereupon much troubled and grieved, upbraided her with disloyaly and charged her down right with adultry, to which she said she was innocent, and that he was to blame to belive his Pye, and that as long as he continued so doing, there would be nothing but variance and discord among them; but he reply'd the Pye could not lye, for what she saw or heard, that she told him, and therefore

 would belive her rather than his Wife.


It so hapned not long after that, this Burgess tra∣velled abroad, and was no sooner gone, but she sent to advise her friend, that to avoid the suspition of the People he should come secretly to her that night, to do as he was accustomed: being come, as he en∣tred into the house, he said Dearest I fear this Make∣bait Pye will discover us, but she bid him be bold, for it was dark, and therefore the Pye could not see them; the Pye hearing this, said 'tis true, I see you not, but I can hear you, and know that you Cuckold my Master, which It shall tell him when he cometh home; at which this lusty young fellow was startled, but she bade him be of good courage, and she would be revenged of the Pye, so they went and lay together, about midnight the Adultress arose, and calling her maid-servant, commanded her to fetch a Ladder, which they did set up to the roof of the house, and having got thereto, they made a hole therein, straight over the Pye, and through it cast at the Pye, somtimes water, then small stones, sand and the like, in so much that the poor Pye was ready to dye.


Upon the Burgesses return h
 went to visit his Pye, asking her how she fared, and what had past in his absence, to which the Pye replyed, Master I shall sa∣tisfie you in both; first, I have strange new
 to tell you, and that is you are Cuckold, for that very night after your departure, your wife entertained a young man all night in Bed with her, notwithstanding I told them I would informe you thereof: as to my welfare, that very night 
I
 had like to have dyed it was so tempestuous, either raining, hailing, or snow∣ing upon me all night long. The wife hearing this

 said to her husband, you have hitherto belived in the Pye, 
I
 will see whether you will continue so doing. She saith she had like to have lyed with rain, hail and snow, that night she accuseth me of adultery, where as there was never any thing clearer but my innocen∣cy, there having not been seen so lovely fair a night as that for many years, and therefore for the future belive her not. The good man to be satisfied of the truth, inquired of the Neighbours whether that night was foul or fair, who all affirmed no night cuold be fairer; then going to his wife he acknowledg'd the fault of his credulity, and after that went to his Pye, and having rail'd at him for sowing discord be∣tween man and wife, notwithstanding he had lov'd him so well, and though the Pye protested he had told him nothing but what he either saw or heard, yet he wrung his neck of, the Wife at the sight here∣of was over-joy'd, but the Husband looking up, saw a ladder, and a hole in the roof the house, and a vessel of water, sand and stones standing by, which made him soon perceive the treachery of his Wife, at which he grew so troubled to be thus deluded, and deprive his dearly beloved Pye of life, that he sold all that he had, and went a Pilgrimage. Now said the Philo∣sopher to the Emperour, was not this a false and wicked woman, by deceit and craft to cause the faith∣ful Pye to be slain, and the Emperour answered it was very true, and I much pitty the Pye, that she should dye for her fidelity, this is a good example for me, therefore this day my Son shall not dye, the Philoso∣sopher commending the prudence of the Emperour, took his leave, having first recommended him to the protection of the Almighty.










CHAP. XVII.
 The Empress 
Aphrodicia
 again induceth the Empe∣rour to proceed to the execution of Prince 
Erastus,
 by a discourse which she made to him of a great in∣convenience which befel a King of 
Persia,
 by put∣ing too much confidence in Philosophers and Wise∣men which belonged to his Court: who by means of a Phantasme which they made in a town, besieged by the 
Persians,
 and ready to be surrendred caused the Seige to be raised, to the great damage of the King, of 
Persia,
 they having taken Bribes and Presents from the Enemies.


THE inconstancy and instability of those who loose themselves in the service of women, may be cleerly demonstrated in this example of the Em∣perour 
Dioclesian:
 who had no sooner ordained and established any thing in this case of his Son: but that at the discourse of the adverse Party he soon changed his mind: for after he had heard the Philosopher 
Philantropus,
 he resolved to examine well the fact of 
Erastus,
 and search out the truth, but being come to 
Rome,
 he was so over rul'd by the speeches of the Empress, that he gave fresh orders to proceed with∣out any delay to the execution of Prince 
Eastus;
 the





top: representation of an empress or queen and an emperor or king beside a throne, with two more figures; bottom: representation of a group of figures outside a castle, fort or tower, over which stands a winged figure with two swords






 manner thus, The Emperour went to visit the Em∣press, to acquaint her that the delay which he had caused in the case of 
Erastus,
 was not to hinder the course of Justice, nor to deferre the revenge for the abuse she had suffered: but to avoid the blame of be∣ing accounted rash and chollerick, as already several had reported him to be, in regard he had pronounced sentence without using the formes in those cases ac∣customed which ought to be freely used to the satis∣faction of every one; wherefore the execution of the sentence must be deferred for a few dayes, other∣wise he should be very much blamed in not admi∣nistring Justice according to the usual manner.


The Empress sighing and groaning thus answered, I deny not Sir, but that in all ordinary cases it is ne∣cessary to observe the customes of the Court; but in so extraordinry a case wherein the crime exceeds all punishments established by law: I say there it is ill to delay the punishment, but to hasten and be speedy in the execution thereof? and Sir, I pray was it ever known or read in any Chronicle or History, that any one was so audacious as only to think to force an Empress, much less to attempt it? where do you finde a Son so unnatural and wicked, as to endeavour to quench his disordinate appetite in a vessel conse∣crated to his Father, and now this great abuse is com∣mitted against one who is above all Laws and Ordi∣nances: and for him to delay the punishment, I know not what to say to it, but that you are so blinded by a Fatherly affection, that you are in a manner con∣tented with the outrage that hath been done to for the laws formerly made by Emperours were to tye up their hands, but to keep their Subj

 within compass, and to inflict severe punishment upon those who should be found so manifest guilty as 
E∣rastus,
 who hath comitted a crime of the highest na∣ture that he could possibly be guilty of; wherefore I see that all this prolongations are to no other end, but that I should dye of grief, which will soon and easily happen to me, since you have so small esteem for my honour, and if my life be troublesome to you, wherefore do you trouble me and your self in this manner, and not kill me out-right at once; for assure your self, 
I
 shall be better pleased to dye, so it may please you, then to live in this torment I now indure.


At these words the Emperour could not forbear weeping, which the Empress observing, she prosecuted her discourse with greater affection than before, shew∣ing that she was not so much troubled on her one ac∣count, as in respect of him, ading that she very welknow that all these delayes about 
Erastus
 proceeded from the malignity of the Philosophers, who under pre∣tence of zeal and religion endeavoured to ruin the ho∣nour and life of the Empress; and I wish to God, said she, that it hapneth not to you as it did to a King of 
Persia,
 who having to do with the 
Caldeans,
 was in bad case, by being advised by his Philosophers as you are by these here; and although I find my self very much weakned by the continual trouble which affl
cts my poor heart, yet however I should be willing to relate the whole affair to you, were it not wholly loss of time, seeing you resolved to stop the execution of the sentence you have denounced.


Let not that hinder you replyed the Emperour, and 
I
 pray you (provided it does not displease you) to relate to me all that hapned to this King, and I

 assure you that you shall see your self revenged both of 
Erastus
 and the Philosophers sooner than you ex∣pect: And thus having comforted the Empress in the best manner that he could, he so entreated her that she began her Narrative after this man∣ner.


In times past there was a very puissant King in 
Persia,
 (as it is usual for all the Kings of 
Persia
 to be so) who was named 
Psamentin:
 this King being de∣sirous to enlarge his Kingdom, at the first began to war upon his Neighbours, and so pursued his Victo∣ries, that in the end he having reduced all the adjoyn∣ing Countries to his command, he came to the Con∣fines of 
Caldea,
 hoping to conquer that Kingdom, as he had done the rest of their Neigbours; and there∣upon having raised a very fair Army, and being pro∣vided with all things necessary for so great an enter∣prize, he with great fury entred the Country of the 
Caldeans,
 putting all that he met to fire and sword▪ the King of 
Caldea
 who was named 
Achias,
 being informed of the great provision which the King of 
Persia
 made to assault him, caused his Nobility to be assembled, whom he acquainted with the design of the King of 
Persia
 had to subdue the Country of 
Caldea,
 and to reduce it to the obedience of the 
Persians,
 for which purpose he had raised a great Army with which he had taken the field, so that he daily expected newes of his arrival into their Cou
try.


Representing to them that they all very well knew what Forces they c
uld raise, and yet how∣ever he was resolved to maintain the fredom of his Country choosing rather to dye than to fall unde


 the Government of the 
Persians,
 whose Impieties they were sufficiently acquainted with, and did ab∣hor them for their Religion; which they could not by any means admit off, wherefore he prayed and ex∣horted every one, both particular and general to con∣sider of what expedient they should u
e in that tim
 of so eminent danger, and that for the conservation of the Crown, a right to which he would not parti∣cularly claim, but should remit it to the General: and thereupon a Royal Throne being placed in the middle of the Counsel Chamber, he went thither and placed the Crown thereon, and then went and sate down among the rest of the Counsel, concluding his discourse thus. 
As for me, I shall serve the Crown, and shall not spare my life to maintain it: being assured that if every one will follow my example, and do their endeavours, we shall well enough preserve it from tyranny of the
 Persians.


This action being accompanyed with a Vehemence which the King used in his speech, did so move the hearts of the 
Chaldeans,
 that laying aside the fear which they had of the 
Persian
 forces, conforming themselves to their Kings example and his vertuous heart, they all unanimously cryed out, that they would live and dye in the service and protection of the Crown, in sign whereof they took it into their hands; and having replaced it on the head of their King, they all promised and swore that they would never yield to the 
Persians,
 but that they would ra∣ther choose to dye than to fall into the power of their Enemies, praying the King to be courageous, and to advise of the necessary provisions for defence of their Country, offering themselves ready, wholly to obey all that he should enjoyn them.




It is high time said the King to take order therein, but however it is first requisite that the Estates take care of provisions, and since you have restored me the Crown: I shall not fail to let you know by my Government the love I have alwayes had for you.


After several propositions on all sides, the Estates resolved to carry into the City of 
Hur,
 all the riches and wealth of the Kingdom, in regard that it was the Capitol City of the Country; and also by reason of the Fortress, and that all the Forces of 
Caldea
 should there have their general Rendevouze, to make to make head against the Enemy, for that it was im∣possible for them to meet the 
Persians
 in the open fields, whose Army was not numbred by hundreds of men, but by thousands. And thus the King of 
Caldea
 having given the best order he could in his affairs according to his power, he caused the City of 
Hur
 to be victualled and munitioned, wherein he also placed a good number of men to sustain the Seige: yet he made not so much haste, but the Enemy was entred the Country, before he had victualled the Ci∣ty of 
Hur
 as he had intended, and the Army of the 
Persians
 was so numerous both in Horse and Foot, that it seemed sufficient to Conquer not only one Citty, but all the World.


The 
Persians
 being entred into the 
Caldeans
 coun∣try, put all that they met to the Fire and Sword: so that the 
Caldeans
 being forced to forsake their little Towns, all 
led to the Citty of 
Hur,
 being followed by their Enemies. Those who were within, seeing so great an Army without their walls, began to fear, yet in the end every one resolved to keep his Oath, and to defend themselves, purposing rather to lose their

 lives then to yeild to the 
Persians,
 who frequently assaulted the Citty, but it was as valiently defended as assaulted. The Citty was so straitly beseiged on all sides, that it was impossible to enter it, and much less to issue out, but without great difficulty, and that by the way of the Mountain, which was adjoyning to the C tty; and thus the seige endured for several moneths, the beseigers not being able to take the Cit∣ty, nor they within to damage the beseigers; and yet they were many times assaulted, but the Fortress was so strong and so well defended, that the assaliants could gain nothing thereon, but many times they had epual losses. The seige then having continued a long time, the Victuals began to fail them within, the King understanding thereof took the number of the men, and cattel that were within the Citty, giving to every one a competent, though slender allowance, so that the beseiged k
pt themselves for some time in very good order. But the King seeing that their victuals would endure but f
r 
 few dayes longer, he caused the Counsel to assemble, acquainting them with their condition, concluding that of two evils they must choose 
n
▪ ei
her to dye by hunger in the Citty, or valiantly t
 issue out upon their Enemies; saying that although the best was bad, yet his opinion was not to dye of hunger, but like men of courage, to fall upon their Enemies, on whom they must needs make a co
siderable slaughter, assuring them that if they beh
ved themselves as he hoped they would, they should lessen the number of their Enemies, and give the rest occasion not to beast of any vi∣ctory.




All of them approved of the Kings advice, consi∣dering the desperate condition of their aff
i
s, and it was concluded that at the next new Moon (for the 
Caldeans
 reckon the increase of the Moon to be a good sign, and the decrease to be a bad sign to them) they would all issue out intending to dye in the Bed of Honour, fighting against their Enemies, and the Women declared themselves to be no less valiant, re∣solving to accompany their husbands. This conclu∣sion being taken, and every one being resolved, they all began to make merry, and give signs of joy and gladness. The 
Persians
 hearing this, and being acquain∣ted with the great want and scearcity which they with in had indured, were astonished thereat, and more particularly their Philosophers and Magitians, where∣of there were three in the Camp, who managed all the affairs of the King of 
Persia,
 so that nothing was done without their advice, for these three Philoso∣phers were reputed to be very wise and good servants to the King, yet within few dayes treason and disloy∣alty, appear in the ruin of their King, and destructi∣on of their Army. Now these three Philosophers being very well experi
nced did pre
ume that all the treasure of the 
Caldeans
 would be brought to this Citty of 
Hur,
 and that t
erefore there would be a great quantity of Gold and Silver, as indeed there was, and they had designed this seige for no other end, but that they might gain a good par
 of the trea∣sures that should be there, but now understanding that the beseiged had not lost courage, but that the longer they continued, they appeared the more hardy in de∣fendi
g their Citty, they therefore b
lieved they had found some quan
y of Corn or other Mu
itio
,

 whereby they might yet endure the Seige. And there∣fore not having patience, but being very desirous to satisfie their avarice, they reso ved to be Masters of some of the 
Caldeans
 treasure by one means or o∣ther, and not attaing their ende by the ruin of the Citty, which had worne out their patience by their long holding out, they therefore intended to g
in it by delivering of them within, whereupon having conferred together, they all three entreated the King to permit them to depart from the Camp for some certain dayes, to cel
brate some sacrifice, where none ought to be present but those of their quality; whereby they should discover by the communication of Spirits, the 
ccasion of the feast, which was made by the besieged, and what means they must use to reduce them to the necessity of yeilding. To this the King consented, and withal entreated them to be diligent in their sacrifices, to the purposes aforesaid.


These Philosophers then leaving the Camp, pre∣vailed so with the K
ng of 
Persia,
 that he promised to attempt nothing 
gainst the Citty until their re∣turn, only to kee
 it straitly besieged, and to take care of his own Camp. This being done they tra∣velled to to the Mountain, where they remained un∣til night, which being come they went towards the Citty, and being perceived by the Sentin
l
, who asked who goes there, and having answered that they were there for the service of the Citty, and that they should conduct them to the King to acquaint him with somwhat of importance, the Court of guard see∣ing that they were but three, permitted them to en∣ter the Citty, and having set a guard of soldiers over them, some went to the King to acquaint him of their arrival, who caused them to come presently that he

 might know their business; they being before the King desired private audience, to this the King con∣sented, retireing into a Chamber with some Princes his favourites, and there the Philosophers began to discover and declare what they were, saying, that the great compassi
n which they had for the poor inha∣bitants of the City of 
Hur,
 had mov'd them to come thither, to advertize the King, that if they might be recompensed equal to the g
eatness of their desert, and as the case required they would cause the seige to be raised, and constrain their Army to leave the Coun∣try of 
Caldea.
 The King hearing this, although he could give no credit to their promises, taking them for Traytours, yet however seeing his affairs reduced to so great extremity, that within a few dayes he should be constrained for want of victuals to fall up∣on desperate actions; he therefore would not slight this occasion, and thereupon knowing that the de∣sign of these Philosophers was only to get mony, though he was uncertain of their performance, but the better to oblidge and ingage them, he carried them in∣to the treasury, where there was so much Gold and Silver, 
hat it is impossible to reckon it, for the whole treasury of the Country had been brought thither for security. The Philosophers seeing this, were asto∣nished at the vastness of that treasure; and the King promised them and solemnly swore to them, to let them have what part of this treasure they pleased, in case they performed what they promised in causing the seige to be raised, and the Army to leave his Country.


The Philosophers being contented told the King that he should incourage his people; for within 4 days

 the seige should by their means be raised, which they performed as you shall presently hear.


In the middle of the Citty of 
Hur,
 there was a very high Tow
r, which not only commanded the Camp of the 
Persians,
 but also discovered all the ad∣joyning Countryes. The Philosophers intending to play their project on this Power, caused a habit to be made of a Gyant like proportion, covering the same with burning glasses, looking-glasses of Christal and other Glasses of several colours wrought together in marvalous order; after this they made two golden wings, which had as much luster as the habit, and painting two swords with Vermission, that they seemed to be bloody, 
et however they shined very cleerly, they also provided several artificial fire works, which should make a great noise, and seem to be Thunder and Lightning: all things being thus pro∣vided and ordered, two of the Philosophers went out of the Citty, and went to the Mountain the same way that they came, the third remained in the Citty, to execute that which they had determined between them.


The next m
rning the Rascal Philosopher who staid behind, did put on the habit of gl sses, and pla∣ced the two golden wings on his shoulders, so that he could command them, and spread them as artifi∣cially as a Bird doth naturally; besides all this he put a great Crown on his head, from whence issued several bright beams or raies of divers co∣lours, having in each hand a bloody sword.


This done he fell to work with the wild-fire▪ making so great a noise with slashing and cracking

 as if the whole Citty of 
Hur
 had been on fire, and in the midst of this flameing and thundring the Philosopher appeared on the top of the Tower, in the habit and equipage which I have described to you, appearing of so large a stature and size, that it succeed∣ed all humain proportions. The Sun beams struck so directly upon the Glasses, and their shineing ha∣biliments, that it dazeled the eyes of the beholders. After the Philosopher had for some space spread his wings, and sluttered with them, he began to bran∣dish and flourish with both his vermillion swords, so that the beholders supposed him to be in fight. The 
Persians
 seeing this strange and dismal sights were terrified and dismayed, not knowing what should oc∣casion it. In the midst of these passages the two other Philosophers who were in the Mountain came run∣ing and crying into the Camp, and going directly to the Kings Tent, cryed out they were all dead men, wherefore said the King? do you not see Sir, said they, the God of the 
Caldeans
 who is descended from Heaven to defend them, so that if we stay here any longer we shall be all lost; and therefore it is necessa∣ry for us to flee, lest we enrage this God any further, and thereby loose our lives as our Companion hath done, who having seen the apparition of this God, and being desirous to appease his fury with certain new Sacrifices which he would offer, was suddenly slain in the Mountain by a Thunder-bolt, which we seeing made all possible haste down hither, to acquaint you that if you do not this day depart the place, none of your Camp will escape: and thereupon they be∣gan to flee, which caused several who gave as much credit to these Philosophers, as if they had been

 a God to follow them, and flye as well as they The King himself presently mounted on horseback, so that in one hours time the Seige was raised; The besieged who were in armes and who were ready to issue out, seeing their enemies in a Rout, fell on their Reer and charged them so briskly, that they made as great a slaughter as they pleased, and took so many Prisoners that it was wonderful, for the poor 
Per∣sians
 fled without any order, thinking that the God of the 
Caldeans
 was still behind them, so that a small number escaped, & they too hastening night & day out of the 
Caldeans
 Country. The pursuit being finished which lasted untill night, the 
Caldeans
 returned to their City being all rich & more contented, for all the baggage of the 
Persians
 was left in the Camp, where∣by the 
Caldeans
 had the Pillage which was of an in∣esteemable value. The Philosophers faceing about took the way of the Mountain, and from thence returned to the City of 
Hur
 where they were high∣ly welcomed, and the King of the 
Caldeans
 kept his promise with them, having by their cunning device and tricks defeated the King of 
Persia
 who was their Master, and had turned the victory to the 
Caldeans
 side, and that for covetousness of the Treasure which was delivered to them.


And thus Sir, (continued the Empress) will it happen to you if you prevent if not: For I foresee that you lending your ears to these Phi osoph
rs, and not taking heed to their device, and following their wicked & pernicious counsel as you d
, they will occa∣sion your death & will enstall their 
Erastus
 with the Emperiall Crown▪ that they may divide among them∣selves the Treasure of 
Rome;
 but I beseech God to

 be so meciful to me to take me out of this miserable life before that happeneth, so that I may not with my Corporall eyes behold that which with my Spiritual eyes 
I
 foresee with much regret.


And thus having finished her discourse, she began to sigh groan and weep, so that the Emperour himself could not refrain from weeping; and after he had comforted her as much as he could, he said take no care for this Madan, for I am too well in Instructed to be over-reached with all their cunning; and to give you the more satisfacton I have purposed that to morrow morning 
Erastus
 shall be executed without any further delay, and he being dispatch justice shall soon after proceed to the punishment of these who have brought him to so pittiful an end by their bad Instructions: At which speeches the Empress being somewhat app
ased they went to bed together, but the Empress found this nighr to be as long as the precedent wherein she the next morning expected news of her son-in-laws death.








CHAP. XVIII
 The Philosopher 
Agathus,
 put a stop to the execution of 
Erastus
 by his oppinion upon a Letter which a Queen of 
Germany
 had written to the Emperour, to cause her husband to be put to death; alledging in confirmation of his oppinion the Story of a Gentle∣man of 
Modena,
 whose wife did cut his 
hroat that she might have a young man whom she loved, she ha∣ving before endeavoured to kill him by several ways, and means wherein she had failed.


THE Emperour being willing to lye with the Em∣press, in s
me manner to appease her, did perceive soon after midnight (he being so continually troub∣led in mind that he could not take his natural rest) several people who talked very loud in the with∣drawing Room of the Empr
ss; and having asked of the women of the Empresses Bed-Chamber wha
 was the ma
ter, one of them entred the Chamber, and presented a Letter to the Emperour, saying that one of the Gentleman of his Chamber had brought it, and had charged her to deliver it suddenly, accor∣ding to the desire of a Messenger who was come from 
Germany
 in Post, who said he was commanded by those that sent him, to cause it to be instantly read to the Emperour in regard it was of importance for the Conservation of the Empire, further saying that

 the lowd talking the Emperour had heard was in ar∣guing the case with the Messenger, whether it was absolutely necessary to deliver the Letter presently; doubting there might be danger in staying till the Emperour did rise, and for fear they should presently awake him.


The Emperour having seen the contents of the Letter, which required suddain consideration and yet mature deliberati
n, commanded that the cheif of the Senators sh
uld be assembled, in the mean time he arose, (for it w
s not long to day) and went only habited in his night gown to meet the Senators, in the Empresses Hall, among others the Philoso∣phers were al
o called to this counsel, whose pre∣sence although it some what displeased the Emperour by reason of 
Erastus,
 yet however he was very well contented that they should be present at this Counsel; to see h
w much they would surpass the others in readiness of advice. The Counsel being then 
ssemb∣led & all others being turned out, but such as belonged to the Counsel, the Emperour acqu
inted them with the c
use why he had caused them to meet, and after he had spent some time in discoursing ab
ut the pre∣sent affair, be commanded one of his S
cretaries to read the Letter from the Q
en of 
Germany,
 the contents whereof followeth.


HEliodora
 Queen of 
Germany,
 to 
Dioclesia
 Em¦perour of the 
Romans
 greeting; the horror which 
I
 naturally have against any thing contrary to my duty joyn'd to the faith 
I
 owe to the 
R
man
 Empire, not only in respect of the general obligation which this king∣dom hath as being a dependant on the said Empire, but also by a particular affection of my Family which is an∣tiently descended from the illustrious blood of the Romans

 hath constrained me to send you this Letter, without respecting and having little regard to the great danger and hazard of my life, in case of discovery that the ad∣vertisement which I send you should come from me, preferring this advice which only tends to the preser∣vation of the great 
Roman
 Empire, before my own life.


Know then that the King 
Erastus
 my husband, who at first shewed himself very affectionate to the service of the 
Roman
 Empire, from whom he holds his Crown, is so altered in his latter age, that he endeavours nothing more than your ruin, and the destruction of 
Rome,
 and yet I am ignorant of the occasion. To com∣pass which ends, he daily endeavours to draw to his o∣pinion, the most dexterously that he can the cheif, and Governours of the Countries adjoyning to this King∣dom. Nay hath many intelligences and secret practi∣ses in 
Italy▪
 by which means he may on a suddain raise a great and strong army to surprise you unprovided; and by this means to abuse the granduer of the 
Roman
 Empire. And this he may easily perform (if you pre∣vent him not) by the great number of men which he can raise in these Countries, who are very strong and brave warriours as every one knowes. And therefore you are not only to advise how to defend your self, but to think of Chastiseing his rashness; so that he may serve as an Example to other Princes, who shall be so hold as to rebel against the 
Roman
 Empire, and to maintain 
Rome
 in its greatness.


Now to think of chasting him by force of Arms, as the case requires, it will be very difficult▪ and in a man∣ner impossible, for as you very we
 know our 
Germans
 are so valiant, that all the Forces of your Empire, which

 
I
 confess are very great, yet they would be to weak to subdue and conquer this Nation. Wherefore that which cannot be done by force, may more easily be per∣formed by cunning which if you leave the management to me? 
I
 will deliver this disloyal King to you either alive or dead: provided that you warrant me in the action, and will take me into your protection, and that of your Em∣pire, to which I account my self so much obliged, that I rather choose to keep faith with you, than with him, to whom my person is obleiged some years since: where∣fore expecting Letters of assurance on your part, you may be confident of the sincerity of my heart towards you and your Empire, which I will manifest to you in short time, more by effect than words, 
Fare you well.


This Letter being read in full Counsel, and the importance of the affair being well considered, they were devided in their opinions, some advised that 
Rome
 ought presently to be fortyfied, so that the E∣nemies might have little mind to come and beseige a place so well provided; others on the contrary said that this was not correspondent to the grandeur of the 
Roman
 Empire▪ and that this would demonstrate their fear, which would be a thing contrary to the honour and reputation of the 
Roman
 People, who ha∣ving been Conquerers of the World, would not seem to fear the barbarous 
Germans,
 without great pre∣judice to their honour; and therefore concluded that a potent army should be raised, and led withal ex∣pedition to chastise the rashness of those who had not only presumed to rebel, but also had sworn the ruin of the Empire.




O her
 wh
 were disp
ased with the war, disap∣proved of the 
German
 exp
dition, alleadging that it w
s not only 
fficult, but in a manner imp
ssible by force of Arms to over run a Nation so populous and Warlike as the 
Germans
 were; and to this pur∣pose they related the many losses which the Antient 
R
mans
 had at divers times susteined, and therefore they advised under some pretence to send an Ambssa∣dour to the King, who might by fair means remon∣strate the duty which he owed to the 
Roman
 Empire, from which his Crown depended; endeavouring to perswade him to desist from making war upon the Empire, intimating that if he did prosecute his design, it would be his certain ruine.


Others were of opinion to acccept the Queen 
Heliodora
 into the protecti
n of th
 Empi
e n t 
∣cept of her offer, considering the great aff
ction which she shewed, by advertiz
ng them of that which might be of dangerous conseq
ence to her. This opi∣nion was contradicted by others, in respect that the 
Romans
 had alwayes maintained their greatness by a millitary vertue, and not by any indirect courses, such as those were; wherein the Queen proposed and of∣fered her assistance, in this variety of opinions, the greatest part of the morning was spent without taking any resolution, when the Philosopher 
Aga∣thus
 (whose turn it was on this sixth day to defend 
Erastus
) arose, it being his turn to give his opinion, and because all the Assembly believed him to be a wise man, of good counsel and ready judgment, every one kept silence, so that he being obs
rved by all, he began to remonstrate by a very elegant discourse, the little appearance for any suddain motion, and

 less to m
ke any w
l ke preparati
ns up
n the simple Letter of this Queen, since that by the Let∣ter it self wh
ch sh
 h
d sent th
re a
peared falsi
y and deceit in the 
d
rtisements, which pr
ceeded rather fr
m the P
ssi
ns and d
 rd
nate aff ct
ons of that Prince
s, th
n f
o
 any z 
l which she had for the co
se
va ion of the 
Roman
 Empire, and ope∣ning all the p
rticulars of 
he Letter, he made out the little credit that was to be given to it▪ for as for h
r Orig
nal which she said she was derived from the illustrio
s blood of the 
Roman
 Senators, he prov'd from the Annuals and Ch
onicles that this was false, for he could not finde that any 
Roman
 Gentle∣man had left 
Rome
 to marry in 
Germany,
 or that a∣ny 
Roman
 Lady ma
 married thither; further adding that if it had been so (which was not to be beleived) yet h
wever that it was imp
ssible that any 
Roman
 Lady should so long remain in a barbarous Nation without being basterd
z
d: her Letter expressing that her Family was descended from the Antient 
Ro∣man
 blood, and therefore he concluded that this Letter could not be impa
d to proceed from a∣ny good z
al, alleadg ng further that there was very l
t
le prob
ility that this K ng had sollicited the Neig
bou
ing N
ions to reb
l with him, since that if it were so, it wo
ld be impossible but that the 
French, Sweedes, Hungarians,
 and those of the adj
yning Co
ntries who are alwayes mo
t faithful to the Empire, should have some know∣ledge of it. And as for the Practices and in∣tell
g
nces which 
he said her husband had in 
Italy,
 this m
ght easily be discovered to be untrue, in re∣gard the affairs of 
Italy
 were as well setled as they

 had been for a long time: and that 
Italy
 had not ever been more at the command of the Empire than it was at that present. And therefore knowing that the said Letter was composed of falsities and impossible things, he concluded that no regard should be had thereto; for although the King of 
Germany
 should bear such intentions against the Empire, (which he could not believe, esteeming all that the Queen had written to be false,) yet he could not on a suddain raise such an Army, but that their Allies, nay the Governours of the 
Roman
 Provinces would have knowledg 
f it, who would give such timely notice thereof at 
Rome,
 that they might be well enough pro∣vided to stop their pass
ge, more especially at the 
Alps.
 And now said he, these things being thought to be probably false, it will be necessary to resolve a doubt, which is this, what should be the cause, and what should move the Queen to write this Letter, and thereby to caluminate her Husband. As to this, the contents of the Letter being considered, the resolu∣tion is very plain, and in short is her Husbands age, for there is nothing more displeasant to a young wo∣man than to lye by an old mans side; so that if Na∣ture do not take them away as soon as they have a minde to it, they never leave then to study some way how to dispateh them, and I wish to God that their case would alwayes prove as it did with a Damsel of 
Modena,
 whose story I shall willingly relate, which may serve as well to this purpose as another, if I did not doubt to displease the Counsel with my tedious∣ness, no, no replyed the Emperour, proceed and you shall very much please me, for time cannot be better imployed than in hearing those things, from whence

 we may learn some good and profitable doctrine; whereupon the Philosopher prosecuting his discourse thus began.


In times past at 
Modena
 one of the famousest Ci∣ties in 
Italy,
 there was a Gentleman one of the Principal of his Country, who having spent his youthful dayes in the study of learning, and in seve∣ral other exercises fitting his degree and quality, without subj ct
ng himself to the yoak of wedlock, being arrived to a declension in years, purposed to marry, as well out of complyance to the desiers of his friends, as out of an effection to leave some issue behind him: and thereupon he took a woman his e∣qual in riches, and the greatness of his Family, but much different in age, he being well stricken in years, and she entring into the flower of her age, who ha∣ving lived with him for some time, and having had some experience of the World, she understood that although she had plenty of all manner of worldly goods, yet she wanted a full enjoyment of that one thing which women most principally covet; and un∣derstanding that her Husband could not give her a full satisfaction, she purposed to look out for it else where, so that by the assistance of her Chamber-maid, she contracted love with a young man, and having had tryal of his youth, she so entirely placed her af∣fection on him, that she not only enjoyed him in pri∣vate, but was not ashamed to own him before all the World. But knowing that this could not be done without great scandal so long as her husband live
 she therefore endeavoured to dispatch her old Husband out of the way that she might be Married to this young one, who for his par


 loved her with an equal affection, hoping that it would not be long ere they had both their wishes ac∣compl
shed, in regard that the old man could not by the course of Nature live much l
nger.


These two Lovers having sevaral times discoursed upon this subj
ct, with a recip
ocal promise of a c
n∣stancy in aff
ction, the young woman at length re∣solved to hasten that which Na
ure had so long de∣ferred, which the young man understanding, he told her that although he should be pleased with her hus∣bands death, yet it was necessary to consider that this hastning might wholy hinder that which they so earnestly desired, for in c
using the old man to dye of a vio
ent death, Justice would take such an ac∣count of it, th
t he should be forced to forsake his Country to save his life, or to suffer a shameful death; by that means losing the pleasure which they had al∣ready tasted, and of which they hoped in time to have a full inj
yment. Upon this discourse the young wo∣man did in part moderate her rage, yet however she endeavoured to attain her ends, but yet so as it might be thought he dyed of a natur
l death. And thereupon being acquainted with an old woman, who like many others commit much wickedness under the vaile of devotion, she learned of her the receipt of a cer∣tain powder made of the roots of Herbs, and many o∣ther ingredients, which being taken either in 
Bolus,
 or Licquor, would cause a burning Feaver, and having provided this powder, she administred it to her Hus∣band, hoping that the Phisitians judging this Feaver did proceed from bad humours, would cause her hus∣band to be purged by means of which purgation and his weakness the Physick would bereave him of his

 life. The powde
 performing its operation, put the poor Gentleman into a Feaver, which he being sensi∣ble of, sent for an 
ld well experienced Phisitian who having examined his Patient, and found by his an∣swers that he had not at all disordered himself; he at∣tributed the cause of his distemper to his age; and in regard he had a young woman to his wife, whereupon he was of opinion that in straining himself more than his age would admit, to pleasure his young wife, he had caused this Feaver to seize on him, and there∣fore he concluded not to purge him either with Me∣dicines r G
ysters, believing that a restorative would be more pr
per for the conservation of his Radical moisture, than to weaken him further by evacuation, seeing him already feeble enough, as well in respect of hi
 age, as in regard of his straining himself with his wife.


The poor Gentleman having remained several dayes in this condition, his wicked wife failed not to let him taste often of her powder, sometimes she gave it him in Broth, and other times after some other manner, that she might continue him in his Feaver, but finding that this caused him only to languish and not dispatch him as she intended (for the restaurative which the Phisitian administrd to him was of such vertue, that it exceeded the malignity of the Feaver, and maintained his radical temper) wherefore she de∣termined to make use of absolute poyson, to effect that which neither Age nor his distemper could per∣forme, and so as it might be supposed that his Feaver only did occasion his death; and there∣upon having purchased some strong Poyson, She mixed it with some Broth which she gave

 gave him as a restaurative. But fortune was at that instant so favourable to the old man, that taking the Porringer with trembling hands, he chanced to let it fall, and it became a Medecine to the Cat, which soon lick'd it up; the woman was very angry at this ac∣cident (pretending her displeasure to be at the loss of so precious a restaurative) and having thus spent all her Poyson, for resolving to make fair work she had given him as much poyson as would have killed a do∣zen: Wherefore that being lost, she was necessitated to give him of the true restaurative, by vertue of which the good Gentleman recovered his former health, the powder which the old she Devil had pro∣vided being likewise all spent. Whereupon the wick∣ed woman was mad with anger, and therefore resol∣ved whatever might happen to di
patch him out of the way; she therefore procured a sleepy potion and gave it him one night at Supper, so that the poor man be∣gan to sleep as he sate at the Table. His wife per∣ceiving that, to express her kindness to her husband, she undressed him for bed where she purposed he should take his last sleep, and having pulled off his Clothes she very gently laid him on his Bed: In the mean time her Paramour being sent for, he attended her in an adjoyning Chamber, where they were used to meet together. She soon left her husband asleep to go to her waking friend, in whose company she took her pleasure, and having enflamed him to a height, she fell upon the discourse of the long life of her husband, and understanding that her young Lover was as much troubled as her self, she told him that if he had courage enough to do one thing which

 she would d
rect, he might be assured to have a full and free enjoyment of that which they had so long and so earnestly desired, and expect
d, and therefore she pressed him to execute her desires. The young man who little thought of the wicked purposes of his Mistress, being willing to content her as it is usual for young men, told her that there was nothing so difficult but he wound enterprize for her se
vice. He making this protestation to his Mistress, she made him swear to performe it; after which she tooke him by the hand and led him into the Chamber, where the good man was in a found sleep, and being approached near the Bed, she put a naked Dagger into his hand saying: Behold him who hath so long hindred the ac∣complishment of our desires, he is fast asleep, and will be so for these four hours, for so eff
ctual is the slee∣py potion 
I
 have given him, you have therefore the means of dispatching him from troubling us both and therefore I pray keep promise with me, and let this Dagger be instrumental in conveying him thither where long since he ought to have been. The young man was startled and troubled at these words of his Mistress, and although he loved her very well and a∣bove all things desired the death of the Gentleman, that he might be married to her; yet however he was seized with horror and compassion to see this antient Gentleman who was in great esteem throughout 
Mo∣dena,
 to be thus cruelly dealt with by his wife; some∣times in one manner, and then after in an other, so that the consideration hereof having seized on his Spirits, being in amaze he let fall the Dagger; which this wicked and obstinate woman tooke up saying

 since your weakness and Coward
ze hinders you from executing what you ought, you shall see that I am Mistress of m
re resolu
ion and courage than you; and lifting up the Dagger she cut the poor mans throat, who was so fast asl ep by vertue of the p 
tion, that without waking he went to sl
ep in the other World. And not contented h
rewith, she gave him diverse blowes with the D
gg
r into his heart, utter∣ing so many outragious speeches against him, tha the young man begin to be ang y w
th her. H
v ng thus dispatched her hu

The young man approved of the Counsel of this Murdress, and thereupon they wraped the body in the bloody Clothes, and carryed it unto an unfrequented place without the City where wery few persons pas∣sed; and having digged a hole and buried him, they concluded that for the future nothing could hinder them in their Loves, but the young man was still somewhat doubtful, and according to their agree∣ment they went to the Country to prosecute their intentions which would certainly have taken the ef∣fect; the lewd woman intended had it not been for an extraordinary accident which was not thought of, and did discover all the treason.


This antient Gentleman had bred up a Dog which always attended him: This dog followed the Litter wherein the woman was carried to the Country-house, supposing that his Master was also with her. But being come to the Village and n
t finding his Ma∣ster there, he returned to the City and having hunted and sought over all the house, not leaving the least Corner untrodden; he according to the nature of Dogs began to smell and sent out his Master, and to find the place where they had conveyed his Masters body, and in conclusion he hunted so long over all the fields, that he came to the place where he was bu∣ried; & three he stayed putting his nose to the ground he scented his Masters body: whereupon this poor C
rr began to howle for his Master, and that in such pittiful manner that many who passed that ways stop∣ped at this howling, although this was the Common lestal for the whole city: & the dog did so scratch & claw with his feet that having remov'd some earth he discover'd one corner of the bloody cloth wch he en∣deavor'd to pul out with his teeth forbearing to tear it

 as if he feared to hurt his Masters body, and thus did he continue and encrease his howling. This the P
ssengers seeing and observing the pains which the Dog took with the bloody Cloath, which be endea∣voured to draw out, they therefore resolved to see what it was; the poor Dog looking sometimes upon one, and then upon another, as if he asked their assistance, fawing on those that helped him to dig, and flying on those who would hunt him away, as if he had resolved to defend this Pit even to the death; so that in conclusion people came with spades and shovels, and digging found the body wrapped up in bloody cloathes. The good Dog seeing his Masters body, began to lick it so that he cleansed it from the blood wherewith it was besmeared, and yet for all that none knew the body; the news hereof being carried through 
Modena,
 caused that many and some of the Chief of the Citty went to see it, among the rest several of the Murthered Gen
lemans Relations, who first knew the body by the Dog, before they knew the Dog by his Master, whose body was very much disfigured. The Governour of the place having notice hereof, being a wise and understanding Person, examined the particulars of all; and being told that the Wife of the deceased was young, and the man old; he thereupon conject
red the truth of the mat∣ter, whereupon he sent Officers to the Place where the Woman had reported her Husband was gone for change of Air. The wretched Woman who was re∣turned to 
Modena,
 hearing the noise about the Dogs and the body that was found, was about to flee, but the Officers came timely enough to seize on her and secure her and her wicked Chamber-maid; she seeing

 her self taken and bound, and knowing in whose custo∣dy she was, freely confessed the fact, saying she very well knew the cause why she was taken, and particu∣larly related how she had used her deceased Husband that she might be rid of him, and how she had kill'd him with her own hands, whereupon she was led to the Governour, where she reiterated and confirmed her disposition, further adding that she repented she had endured so much, and that she had delayed his death so long, and that if it were to do again she would do it.


The Governour hearing this, being much troubled to see so fair a young woman so obstinate in her wickedness, which she did not endeavour to excuse, but rather to justifie, he therefore condemned her to be burnt alive, at the common place of Execution in 
Modena,
 and that her Chambermaid who had not only kept her counsel, but bin her assistant and com∣panion should also suffer with and accompany her in death, and this sentence was the next day executed, this wretched woman not shewing the least repen∣tance for so wicked a crime.


And this may be the very case of the Queen of 
Germany,
 for I am very confident, that no cause hath induced her thus miserably to calumniate the King her Husband, but only an earnest desire to have him dispatched out of her sight. True it is this woman is more cunning, & endeavours to have more assurance then she of 
Modena,
 for she would be assured of the protection and safeguard of the Empire▪ that she may with more safety execute her wicked design▪ wherefore my opinion is that she ought not to be protected in so wicked an action, but that in short an

 answer should be returned her, that the 
Roman
 Em∣pire is puissant enough, not only to defend it self from those who shall dare to assault it, but also for to punish those that shal attempt any unjust action where∣by this perverse Princess may know that we well enough understand the reason of her writing this Letter, and that therefore she should forbear acting of those things that deserve punishment, lest she serve as an example to others who shall attempt the like.


And it is my earnest wish that there were none like her at 
Rome,
 and then I should not have occasion to continue my discourse, and then Sir you and w
 that are your servants should not be put to the trouble we this day are at, on the 
ccasion of Prince 
E∣rastus;
 for certainly if the c
use were searched to the bottom, it would be found to be quite different, than his mother in 
 h
th i
sly imputed it, to cause him to do so, that she may with the more ease con∣trive the same against you and b
 out of fear and dan∣ger of y
ur S
ns he
 g rev
d on her; this Sir, or some such curse is the only r
son, wh
ch at present is to me unknown, but I can affi
, as you will in conclusion s
d, that 
Erastus
 
 
noc
nt, not only of this fact, but of 
ll other v
i 
actions, if the hasty execution of a rash sentence giv
n against him d
h not hinder the knowledg of the truth; to pr
cure which 
I
 shall follow the Nature of the Gentleman of 
Modena's
 D
g, and the example of my Com∣panion
, who have no
 ceased not do not yet cease to crye that order may be, observed, and if you are not pleased to open your ears to the adver∣tisements which we give you, have a care that our clamours be thought hereafter to be to as little pur∣pose

 as the Howlings of the good dog were to his Ma∣ster, to discover the truth of the fact when there was no remedy. Open your eyes and your eares Sir, while it is yet time, without precipitating on an action that may cause a too late & vain repentance; if you believe that 
Erastus
 is guilty of the crime wherewith he is ac∣cused, we are of a contrary opinion, & yet none of us are upon certainties; & therefore if you put him to death, you will be accounted throughout all the world to be a wicked unjust & cruel Prince; wherefore let me prevaile with you to do that which you have so often intended, to remit the cause to the trial of the Senate, to proceed according to right reason & justice; if it proves to be so as the Empress hath falsly alledged, & that 
Erastus
 be 
o d
ed th
n you may execute him and us also who 
 been his 
tors without incur∣ring any infamy. And on the contrary if his Inno∣cence doth appear as I believe it will, you will not be deprived of a Son and the Empire of a Successor.


The Oration of good 
 
Igathus
 was pronounced with such earnestness th
 all the Senate stood up en∣treating the Emperor to 
 the advice of the Phi∣losopher, and 
 counsel could be given in a case so difficult: 
 & also by reason of the learned speeches which the Philosopher 
Agathus
 had made, the Emperor, was constrained to put a stop to the execution of the sentence of 
Erastus
 for that day, but he was troubled to hear the Empress so open∣ly blamed before the Senate. And as for the Queen of 
Germany,
 it was concluded to give her such an answer as the Philosopher had directed, who gained very great honour in this Counsel for that he had discovered the intention of this Queen of 
Germany
 wch could be no other but what he had describ'd in regard there was no other

 advise if any rebellion in 
Germany
 whereupon the Counsel arose, and every one retired to their houses, expecting to hear the cause of Prince 
Erastus
 which had been left to the tryal of the Senate, and it was the wishes and desires of all, that the cause should prove as the Philosophers had averred, and not ac∣cording to the accusation and imputation of the Em∣press, whose Tyranny was hated by many, on the contrary every one admired the good carriage which they had only once seen in Prince 
Erastus,
 who was esteemed and loved by all the world.


This History or example of the Philosopher
 Agathus 
is according to the original in the
 Italian 
and
 French; 
but there being an other story to this purpose,
 I 
shall thus relate it.


A Gentleman of 
Rome
 (whose Ancestors had left him a plentiful estate, becoming Master of it by the death of his Relations before he had descretion to manage it;) was so expensive and prodigal, that in few years it was much impared and lessned; he not perceiving it or at leastwise not taking care to im∣prove what he had left, still spent in superfl uous manner, keeping the highest though not the best com∣pany; but the most chargeable was his converse with women, whom he had treated in a splended manner, hoping, to make up his own fortune by matching himself to a rich Lady; but those who were so under∣standing his profuseness, had almost reduced him to b
gery, refused his Court-ship and Importunity, and at length his Company, so that he being disap∣pointed in his intentions of recovering his Estate be∣came desperate, and having long courted a rich 
Roman
 Lady, and missing of her, he was at last contented to

 be married with her Chamber-maid, who was as fair though not so rich as her Mistress, and who had tasted of his bounty as a servant, that she might speak a good word for him to her Mistres, but she who was deceitful and ambitious, and indeed amorous of him, instead of furthering and assisting him in his Courtship to her Lady, spake and acted all she could to hinder the progress of their loves; which was soon broken off, so soon as her Lady who was cove∣tous, understood that he had made shipwrack of his fortune, and had no other way to keep himself from sinking but the hopes of her Estate which she had resolved he should never be master off.


Our Gentleman understanding the resolution of the Mistress, was as I told you married to the Maid, by which action he thought to vex the Lady which slighted him, and marry her who loved him, and that he might make the Lady and all the World believe they were mistaken in him, and that his Estate was as good as ever, he lanched out all that he could to make a sumptuous wedding, so that by such time as h
s and his Brides cloathes were paid for, and the o∣ther expences defrayed, not only his own Estate was consumed, but all his new wives ready money which she had pickt up in her service was spent, and besides one Citty house and some moveables, all else was sold, and the money wasted, all the Treasure he could boast of was his wives beauty which was indeed ad∣mirable, and so attractive that it brought her many servants and adorers, but she who was vitious enough in other matters as you shall understand ere long was virtuous in preserving her chastity for him alone who

 who had paid so dear for it, and refused the embra∣ces of all her Lovers for her husband.


They who courted her, finding that amorous language and handsome treats would not work upon her, and partly understanding her husbands condition to be necessitous, resolved to take an other course, and pre∣sented her with rings, plate, and some trifling jewels, which she accepted of, and than gave them the hear∣ing, but yet stood out as to the main, and wou
d not admit of any neer approaches, resolving since they had begun with presents that they should proceed in the same manner, and that if they had injoyment, it should be a costly one, as indeed in the end it proved to be. Many of these suiters she had, (all which she held in hand so long as they brought grift to her Mill) but the principal were three 
Roman
 Knights, who having large revenues, not only spent largely, but presented her very roundly that they might have a lick at her honey p
.


Her husband was no such Novice in these affairs, but that he understood what was meant by this court∣ship, but being confident of his wiv
s chastity, (who indeed acquainted him with all her proceedings, and permitted him to share in her profits) he therefore was contented, and advised with her how to manage her affairs to the best advantage; so that the 3 Knights becoming imp
rtuna
 
uiters, and besides the pre∣sents off
ring her fair in moneys, she at length made a bargain with them she managed each of them seve∣rally, not one knowing the design of the other, though they were all very well known to each other, yet this was a secret they discovered not 
 any, she having engaged them so to doe for

 preservation of her honour.


The some she agreed upon was 200 Crowns of each of them they were to pay, and fare all alike, and to be entertained all at one and the same time and place. The appointed time being come, and one of the Knights having entred her house, and delivered the mony ready told, her husband was ready to re∣ceive him, but in a fatal manner with a naked sword running him through so often, that he sunk down dead on the ground, the first being thus di
patched, it was not long after before the second came, who fared no better than the first, and the third also was forced to bear his friends company in death.


Thus did these three Knights fall inglorlously, and instead of pleasure they intended, they purchased a suddain death, and these two murderers were proud of their prize and conquest, believing that they had done well in preserving their honor, and supposing that if the world were acquainted with the whole matter they might well enough justifie the fact, yet however they were willing and desirous to conceal it, and to that purpose they contrived a way how to be rid of the dead bodies.


The murdress had a Brother who was Commander of the watch of the whole Citty, and with some attendants, such as he thought fit to choose from a∣mong the rest, he went the Rounds, and visited the several watches, he being in his Circuit was called in by his Sister, who gave him and his crew a sufficiant quantity of strong liquor, and keeping them in k
n house so long that it was too late to pro
a
 in his walk she desired him to send away hi
 Attendants; and that she had a private h


 private business to impart to him. He consented to what his loveing Sister desired, and they being gone, she tells him that she hath somewhat to impart that he must be very secret in, and withal assist her in or else she was undone; he not questioning the matter what, makes her an absolute general promise to do all things she would desire, she having thus assured him, she tells him a Knight of the Emperours Court came that day into her house, and intended an abuse to her but was hindred by her husband, who by chance ar∣rived and being Cholerick and the other desperate, they so far engaged together that her husband ha∣ving the Juster cause overcame and slew his enemy whose body remained there in the house unburied, and that without his assistance they knew not how to convey it away. Well Sister replyed he I will rid you of that trouble; help me to a Sack and 
I
 will put the body into it and carry it on my back and throw it into the River 
Tiber,
 whose streams will quickly convey it into the Sea, so that you shall hear no more of it.


His Sister did as he required, and desired him by all means to return thither again, so soon as he had done what he promised: He accordingly did as he had said and soon returned, bidding her take no more care for by that time the body was carried far enough by the violence of the stream, she hearing him say so fetched him a cup of the best liquor her house afford∣ed, but pretending some business in the next Room to that where they were drinking, she went thi∣ther? but hastily and as it were in amaze returned crying out, Oh Lord! Brother I am undone; for the Knight which you so lately carryed to the River is

 returned and lyes here: How said he, it is impossible; but going thither he there found the body of a dead Knight, whom he supposed was as she told him the former returned. Well said he give him me again, and I will try what can be done and now make sure work, for 
I
 will throw him in again Sack and all and a great stone tyed to it; having aid thus he takes the body puts it into his Suc
 layes it on his shoulders, and carries it where he had said; and returned saying, now Sister assure your self I have secured all well e∣nough, for 
I
 saw the body sink to the very bo
om: therefore fill the other dish of liquor and let us be merry. She did as he desired and they drank on, but not long before she made the same excuse as formerly, and came running and frighted, crying out that the Knights body was again returned.


Her Brother hearing her speeches and seeing a dead body (which indeed was of the third Knight though she said it was the first) was much am
z
d concluding that this Knight was borne under some Planet whose influence was such that the water should not prejuduce him, wherefore he resolved to take another course, and try what the fire would do: therefore he puts it into a Sack and carryes it to a place without the Citty where there was much Wood, this he put together in such manner a∣bout the dead body that it might be consumed He having placed all things in order, and set fire to the Wood, retired a little out of the way to do the deed of Nature.


In the mean time, it growing towards morning a Knight who was Journeying to the Emperour

 Court, chanched to ride that way, and seeing a fire the weather being cold & raw, he drew near to it to warm himself, and in this posture did our Over-seer of the watch finde him when he returned, whereupon he asked what he was, a Knight replyed the Traveller, you are a Devil and no Knight said the Over-seer, for I first carried you into the River and threw you in, but you returned, I then again threw you in sack and all with a stone, but you still returned, and then I finding that the water had no power over you, tryed what the fire could do and intended here to burn you, but I think to no purpose, for I see you are come out again, yet I will once again try what I can do, and thereupon he seized on the travelling Knight, and threw him horse and all into the fire, and their stayed tell they were burned.


By this time it was day, and he having done his work throughly as he beleived, returned to his Sisters house, telling her what he had done, and how that at last he threw him and horse too into the fire, she seemed to admire at it, and was very well contented with the story, and having treated her Brother with good drink and victual, and many thanks she per∣mitted him 
,


Thus did the 
 woman perform this enter∣prize, coming off with flying colours, and the bag∣gage of the field, 
hree considerable baggs of money which was very welcome to her and her husband, to price up their broken fortunes, and thus did she often times g
t many of her several woers, till at last she came off with loss, and thus it was.




Among her many lusty woers, she had one a little dapper fellow for her servantt by profession a Law∣yer, he having a moneths mind to be dabling with her, made his addresses to that purpose, he was rich and prodigal, she covetuous and a niggard of her favours which must be purchased at a dear rate; he had tryed the vertue of his tongue, but it had no vertue at her bar without that which caused it to speak at the Judges, ready m
n
 was used to oyle his tongue, and that must be produced before she would give the comfortable word you shall have your desire; but in the end he agreeing to give her what she desired she consented, but she intended it not, for of all men she liked not this Handy-prat Lawyer; and therefore intended to serve him as she had done the three Knights.


She acquainted her Husband with her design, who was willing enough to assist and take part in the pain, because he was to take part in the gain.


It was a tall sum she agreed upon, 300 crowns which she pretended she would only borrow for some time, but designed never to pay; the time being come the poor Lawyer came to the place her own house, and delivered the money, but so soon as he at∣tempted to take his pleasure with her, he had it with a vengeance, with a lusty blow laid on between his neck and shoulders, with a large cudgel that set him a sprawling, as it used to do Conies, there needed not many blows, nor no sword to dispatch him, that one with the staff was sufficient; so that he soon kickt up his heele, and went to plead causes in the other world.




They being certain of his death, consulted what to do with his body, which not being wounded, they resolved on this case, the murdering Husband took him on his back and carried him to the back side of the Lawyers own house, which was not far distant, and there being a house of office in the yard, he set him down on the fear, as if he had been there easeing his body, and thus having placed him; he there left him, and went home,


The Lawyer had a companion and bed-fellow who was acquainted with his love story, and knew of that nights appointment and therefore did sit up for him, he having occasion to visit the house of Office, ope∣ning the door saw one sitting there, although he could not imagine who it should be, yet out of modesty he retired for some time, but attending somewhat longer than ordinary, and seeing the Party did not come out he again opened the door, and making a neerer ap∣proach perceived that it was his friend the Lawyer: he wondred at his being there, supposing he was in an another place, wherefore he called him by his Name▪ but received no answer; he then believing him to be asl
ep, and resolving to awake him, pulled him by the C
t, fi
st s
ftly, and then so rudely that he fell on the flo r, he seeing that, upon a little fur∣ther search found that he was dead.


Our Lawyers Chamberfellow being ready witted, was not long in considering the matter, but g
ssed how all had hapned, and therefor, resolved to carry the dead body back to the place from whence he was brought, and thereupon taking him up in his arms, he went to the house where he had been murthered, and setting him upright against the door, he there

 left him and returned to his lodg ng.


Our Murdress had some occasi
 ab
ut midnight to go to the door, opening it, d
wn 
ll 
 b dy into the house, to her great amazement and 
ble; but when she broug
 a Candle, and saw that it was the body of the dear Lawyer, she was ex
reamly terrifi∣ed, calling out to 
er Husband, and acquain
g him with the business, he was 
 
en troubled as she had bin, but knowing the
 
 a 
ssi y of doing som∣what, he resolved to c
rry the b
dy and throw i
 in∣to to the River, he was to pass through divers streets, but in the midst of his Journy he heard a noise of People walking and talking; he having a guilty con∣science, and fearing all things stood up at a conveni∣ent corner to hear and see what these People were, it was not long ere they came so near him, that he could discover by their words and actions that they were night walkers, shop-lifts, or house-breakers, and that they having met with some pr
ze or booty, which they had in a sack, were resolved to leave it on a stall, and retire to a Tavern to make merry.


Our Murderer understanding this, perceaving that they were gone, came from the place where he had stood up, and examining the Sack, found there was in it two flitches of Bacon, he was not long in resolving what to do, but taking the Bacon out of the Sack, put the dead man into it, and placing it on the stall went home laden with the Bacon. His wife expected his return, but seeing him laden was 
ff
ighted, thinking he had broug
 back the body, but he get∣ting in a doors undeceived her, shevving her the Ba∣con, and acquain
ng her how all had hapned, she understanding that they were enriched by an other

 Priz
 went to bed, being very well pleased with her evenings work.


The night walkers who had the Bacon, went to the Tavern and drank so long there that all their mo∣ny would not pay their reckoning; wherfore they bethought themselves of selling their Bacon, and ha∣ving drank their Land-lord to a handsome Pitch, they told him that they had a bargain for him, he asked what? and they replyed Bacon, this is good chaffer said he, if I could see it, whereupon one of them went to the place where they had left their Bacon, and soon after returned, and setting down his load they opened the Sack, but instead of Bacon the Lawyers head appeared. This amazed them all, but the Vint∣ner more especially, who cryed out they had mur∣thered his Neighbour; who was well known to him, and indeed to all the Citty: they were as much sur∣prized as he, and knew not at first what to say, but although he threatned to secure them as murtherers, yet in conclusion they over-rul'd and perswaded him to be patient, and told him all they knew of the story, and that they took it for Bacon, and had it in such a place▪ a Chandlers back house, which indeed they had plan
red, and that thither they would carry it again. The Vintner understanding by their dis∣course that there was a mistake in the case, and believ∣ing that he should only purchase trouble by his med∣ling in it, and it may be, be accounted a party, he there∣fore was contented to be ruled by them and thereupon they went to the Chandlers house from whence they had the Bacon, and carried the body and laid it there and so departed. The Chandler at whose house they had left the body did that morning call up his servant

 early to carry Corn to the Mill, to be ground, the servant ariseing and having fitted his horse and his corn for his journy, had a mind to a breakfast before he went, and a rasher of Bacon was that which he desired wherefore up he went to the Ba∣con loft, but instead of Bacon, he met with the Sack and dead Lawer which tumbling on him, threw him down, he crying out up went his Master to see what was the matter, where he found his man tumbling and rowling with a man in a Sack, he won∣dred to find a dead man there; but missing his Ba∣con he supposed they who had took the one had brought the other, but now it was there he studdied how to be rid of it; wherefore having brought his man to his little wits, they resolved that he should carry the dead body with him towards the Mill, and by the way either drop him or bury him. The servant agreeing to what his Master said, intending to do so, but falling into company who went the same way, he had not the opportunity to do it all the way he rode to the Mill, so that being come thither, and having de∣livered his Sack of Corn to the Miller, he then hunted about to finde a place where to put the dead body. It was winter time the nights long and it was not yet day, however the Miller was up and had provided a Cart load of meal to carry to the Citty, to sell, the Chandlers man seeing this took one of the Sacks of meal & taking some of it out, and stuffing out the sack wherein the Lawyers body was, with it made an ex∣change and laid the sack with the Lawyer & meal on the car
, taking the other sack & laying it on his horse & having his own sack of corn ground, he took that also and returned homewards.




This wandring body of our dead Lawyer was now on the Millers Cart, who soon after set for∣wards to market, and exposing all to sale; but mark how pr
vide
er ordered the matter to discover this Murther, and the true Act
r
 of it. Our murtherer and his Wife being p
ssessed of a round summe of mon
y, and two flitches of Bacon, did resolve to have m
re store of prov sion, and lay in Meale as well as Bacon; and th
refore went the next day to market to purch
e s
me; although they came lightly by their money, yet knowing the want of it they resol∣ved not to part from it easily but buy a good penny∣w
rth, and therefore they examined all the market where to buy ch
pest, and at last they pitched upon the Miller who had the little Lawyer in a Sack, that was set down in the open market, but tyed up as a Sack of meale; the woman having cheapned and tryed tha
 the Miller would use her well, agreed up∣on price for two S
cks full, one which he opened and another w
 he warranted to be of the same goodness but seeing being believing; She caused him to open the Sack, and she her self thrusting in her hand intend∣ing to d
w 
 handful of Meale; caught hold of the Lawyers ha
, she therefore tels the Miller he in∣tended to cheat her with some worse commodity than Meale, wherefore to be sure, some of the Meale being taken out the Lawyers head appearing, she cryed out; Oh Lord! hu
band the Lawyer you killed is come again: Although she spake this in an af∣frighted, distracted manner, yet she was observed and notice was taken by some persons there present and the Lawyers head being seen by the multitude tha
 gathered together upon this account, caused a

 great amazment; all concluded that Murder had been committed, but how strangely none could guess. The Miller was secured as owning the Sack and Meale, and our murdress and her husband, although they would have slunk their necks out of the Coller and denyed what she had said, yet they also were seized on and carried before the Justice.


The noise of this accident was soon spread through all the Citty, and came to the eares of our Lawyers Chamberfellow, who knowing somewhat of the truth of the matter, went to the Justices to hear what would be said of the Whole; but there was little proof of any thing, till he declared that he knew his Companion the dead Lawyer, went the foregoing evening to the house of the murdress whom I may now truly call so; she being supposed to be guilty therefore she and her husband were both committed to Jayle, and being seperated and put into several Prisons and strictly examined; it was not long be∣fore she confessed the whole fact, and also accused her husband for murthering the afore mentioned three Knights, so that just
ce taking place, they were both sentenced to dye and accordingly executed.


Thus although this woman pretended to a great height of vertue in preserving her Chastity, yet was she guilty of a greater crime murher; which was the loss of all who had any converse with her. Therefore we ought not to give credit to every seeming vertue, for some Vice may exceed it.




This story or example may be and hath been ap∣plyed to the same purpose as the former of the Lady of 
Modena;
 to shew the cruelty and little cre∣dit that is to be given to women, and this or the for∣mer preserved the life of Prince 
Erastus
 for one day longer.






CHAP. XIX.
 The Empress moveth the Emperour to proceed to the ex¦ecution or 
Erastus,
 and to put the seven Philosophers into Prison by a discourse which she made him of two marvails at 
Rhodes
 one of a fire not to be put out, which however was extinguished by a Schollar. The other of a Colunine wherein might be seen all passages and actions that were contrived against the Isle of 
Rhodes,
 which wa destroyed by the knauery of three Philo ophers, under p
etence of finding great Treasures under it, wh
ch occasioned the ruin of 
Rhodes.


ALL matters being ordered according to the agree∣ment made in Counsel, the Emperour purposed to leave the Citty and not return to the Empress, (whom he highly effected) that he might not hear the exclamations she would make in regard of the





from top to bottom: representation of a male figure and female figure standing next to a sack with a head emerging from the top, nearby four male figures seated at a table; representation of a male figure standing on a cart next to a windmill, nearby a saddled horse grazing; representation of a market-place, with male and female figures standing around baskets and sacks, with a head emerging from the top of one; representation of a male figure lowering a pike on a statue of a male figure holding a drawn bow and arrow, near them a fire beneath an arch; representation of a pillar supported by statues of an eagle and a lion, nearby an emperor or king and three other male figures






 delaying the execution of 
Erastus,
 so that the mise∣rable Princess who thought of nothing but the death of her Son in law, doubted of that which had hapned; wherefore that she might be informed of the truth, she sent for one of the Secretaries, whom she had preferred to the Emperours service, of whom she enquired a particular account of what had passed that morning. The Secretary gave her a full answer, freely relating all that had been said and concluded on, so that by this means the Empress was adver∣tized not only how it was endeavoured to bring the cause to the hearing of the Senate, but also all that the Philosopher 
Agathus
 had so freely spoken against her; whereupon she was very much enraged, and conceived as much anger against the Philosophers, as she had against 
Erastus,
 purposing not to desist until she caused them all to suffer dea
h, that she might be fully revenged on them, wherefore contriving in her brain a thousand m
chinations and treasons as mis∣chievous as she could imagine, she expected all that day when the Emperour should come to visit her.


And having understood that he arrived late, and had not (according to Custome) come to see her, and discourse with her, she became des∣perately angry, and having for some time con∣tinued so, but knowing that she lost time, in ex∣pectation of the Emperour, she therefore resolved to go to him,


Having staid till every one was retired, she be∣ing accompanied by two of her Damsels, went to the Emperours Chamber just as he was going to bed.


There she began to sigh and cry, and make the greatest complaints in the world; she having (as she

 said) performed all dutiful love to her Husband, as to her soveraign Lord, yet she was so unfortunate, that (although a reciprocal love was pretended) she was mocked, and she believed hated, as might be easily conjectured by the effects: for instead of re∣venging the injury had been done to her, he had not only favoured him that had deserved the punishment, but also hearkned to the Counsels of those who had occasioned all this evil; by pretence of defending their Disciple by false inventions, and fraudulent speeches had not forborn to speak unworthily of her, and accuse her of that which she never so much a
 dreamt of, and had been so confident as to perswade the Emperour that she had caused and procured that against him, which he with his own eyes had seen acted against her; much wondering that he should so much debase himself, as before his Counsellors to appear so friendly to these traiterous Philosophers, who made no difficulty; so much to work on his easiness, as to perswade him that black was white; further adding that she valued not how much she suf∣fered in the opinion of all the world, so long as she enjoyed his love and good opinion; which she sound would be difficult to continue, by means of these mens venemous tongues, who endeavoured to possess him with an evil opinion of her. But she still hoped he would do her justice, in punishing those who had so highly prejudiced her honour; telling him that if he should refuse that justice, she could easily have it by other means; for her Relations being advertized of the great outrages that these Philosophers had spoken against her, w
uld not let them pass unpu∣nished, but would execute such vengeance as the per∣sumption

 and rashness of these Calumniators, and the greatness of her house did require; nay, she did not question but their revenge would reach against 
E∣rastus
 himself, in regard he had been so backward in executing justice for the great wrong which more in∣trenched upon his honour than hers. But especially if he should hinder the course of justice, as he had done in only condemning, and rather giving him the means of escaping by this delay, and permitting him to live, to the great scandal of the Empire; and truly (continued she) I foresee to my great grief, that in the conclusion these wicked men will execute their mal
gnity against your person, to the ruin and de∣struction of the C
mmon-wealth, and it will happen to you as it did to 
Philarchus
 King of 
Rhodes,
 whose story I would relate to you, if 
I
 thought that my true discourse would b
 as effectual with you, as those false ones of the Philosophers.


The Emp
r
ur having considered of the complaints of the Empress, made many excuses, assuring her that the delaying the execution of 
Erastus
 was not in any respect of any desire he had to hinder the course of justice wch-she intended should proceed not only a∣gainst his son, but also against those who having the charge of instructing him in g
od learning and good manners, had it couraged him by their wicked instru∣ctions, to commit that lewdness which they had seen, and who under pretence of defending him, had spoken so ignominiously against her vertue: but that the Se∣nate had so pressed him, that he had not power to de∣ny that which the Laws grant to all Criminals, that is to give them time to justifie and defend themselves, and although 
Erastus
 had already had six dayes time

 to defend himself, during which time he had heard nothing absolute to signify that what he was accused of was not true, as indeed it was, he therefore purposed not to delay it any longer, desiring the Empress 
o de∣pend upon his word, that in a very short time she should be revenged of all the wrongs she had re∣ceived either of 
Erastus
 or the Philosophers; and therefore he prayed her to relate the story of the King 
Philarchus,
 which was a great Novelty to him, who had never heard any thing thereof; neither had he read any thing thereof in any History, assuring her that as to his great trouble, he had been constrain∣ed in full Senate to hear the calumnious discourses of the Philosopher 
Agathus,
 so on the other side he should take as great pleasure in hearing the Nar∣rative of 
Philarchus.


Although the Empress would not at first consent to give the Emperour this satisfaction, making excu∣ses that she might cause the Emperour to be the more earnest, yet in conclusion after much importunity she began as followeth.


All people do very well know the great renown which in times past was had of the Citty of 
Rhodes,
 as well by reason of the Antiquity thereof, as for the famous University that was there: where all manner of learning did flourish, and out of this furth
r re∣spect and consideration that the Inhabitants of that Citty had by force of arms subdued not on
y all the Island, but also the greatest part of the adjoy
ing Countries.


There were many rare things in the Island, but principally two that were admirable and profitab
e, 
e was of great use and service to the poor, and the

 other was for the preservation of the Country. These two mervails were in the publick place, under two great triumphant Arches made of Marble, in one of which there was a fire, that without any Wood or Goals, or any other fewel did continually burn, yeilding so great a heat, that the poor Inhabitants who wanted fire at home, came commonly to this, so that many of the 
Rhodians
 spared making fire in their own houses, having the convenience of warming them selves at this publick fire, just opposite to this fire there was a great statur of brass, holding in his left hand a 
Turkish
 bowe, which he had so drawn with his right, that the very point of the arrow which was drawn to the head, and ready to discharge, touched the wood of the bowe whereon was written.


Strike me not, for if you do,


I have more power t'offend than you.


Under the other Arch there was a 
Columne
 which did shine very bright, and none knew of what ma∣terials it was composed, some supposed it to be of one unknown stone; others were of opinion that it was composed of divers mettals, but what ever it was made of, the brightness was so great that it sh
ned cleerly under all the Arch, thi
 
Columne
 wa
 suppor∣ted by four other stutues of brass, made in the figures of animals, the one was of an Eagle, the other of a Lion, the third of a Griffin, and the fouth of a Horse. And although this 
Columne
 was thus bright & shine∣ing as any looking glass, yet a man could not see himself therein, neither could one see any thing that was adjoyning, as is usual to do in any other Looking-glasses, or other things that are polished, yet it had this admirable property 


 that when a
y thing was enterprized against the Ci∣ty of 
Rhodes,
 or when any Prince did raise forces to assault the 
Rhodians,
 all might be seen in the 
Columne,
 so plainly that you might behold those that made these enterprizes, and by the same means see from what Parts the Enemies came, for the 
Rhodians
 could not in any manner be surprized, for no soo
er was a∣ny thing intended, and contrived against the Citty, but the 
Columne
 pres
ntly discovered it, and therefore the 
Rhodians
 were by means of this 
Columne
 al∣wayes provided for their Enemies, 'tis imp
ssible to tell wh
 was the Inven
or and Archit
ct of these two 
Co
umnes,
 it being altog
ther uncertain, yet it is sup∣posed that some g
e
t Magiti
n, (for at all times that Citty hath bred men of kn
wledg, and well ex∣perienced in all Arts) made them both; and the 
Rhodians
 were as pr
ud of these two 
Columens,
 as of any thing that was in then whole Country; and yet so great

 he that should strik that, wherefore he purposed to make tryal, and having taken a halbert, he struck it as hard as he could against the breast of the Archer; but he had no sooner given the blow, when the Ar∣cher discharged his Arrow directly into the inex∣tinguishable fire which presently vanished; so that the place became as cold as if there had never been any fire there; at which the yo
ng Schollar was a∣mazed, and doubting what would become of him if it were known, that through his folly the unextin∣guishable fire was put out, h
 ran away as fast as he could, having deprived the Citty of 
Rhodes
 of one of the greatest commodities; and indeed the disturb∣ance occasioned by the loss of this fire was very great, for all the Inhabitants but principally the poor ones were very much interested and troubled at the loss; and it was not long after that they lost the o∣ther marvail.


This hapned in the raign of 
Philarchus
 King of 
Rhodes,
 who had a difference with 
Nichomachus
 King of 
Cyprus,
 for certain ships which the King of 
Rhodes
 had taken from the 
Cypriots,
 refusing to restore them; although the King 
Nichomachus
 had often prayed and sollicited the King 
Philarchus
 both by Letters, and Ambassadours; wherefore the King of 
Cyprus
 being angry, resolved to be revenged for the abuse the 
Rhodians
 had done him, but he could not raise any forces, and surprise the 
Rhodians
 by reason of the admirable vertue of the 
Columne,
 which disco∣vered all to King 
Philarchus,
 so that by this means he had time to prepare for his Enemies; this enmity being between these two Princes, the one no
 b
ing willing to be at the charge of a War, doubting h


 should lose his labour, and the other not valuing his Enemies, knowing that they could not surprize him; three of these under pretence of dispiseing riches, and the greatness of the world, but had no other end but to make themselves both great and rich, (such as these Philosophers are, in whom you put so much confi∣dence) seeing the great gain they might get by the difference between these two Princes; after they had a long time consulted the matter among themselves, they went to King 
Nichomachus,
 to whom making themselves known to be wise men, (as they were e∣steemed) they told him that if he would give them conveniences, they would undertake to ruin and destroy the miraculous 
Columne
 of 
Rhodes,
 so that nothing should after that be seen in it, which being done, he might easily attain his ends of 
Philarchus;
 by taking him unprovided; the King of 
Cyprus
 who desired nothing more earnestly, than to have the means to be revenged for the wrong which 
Philar∣chus
 had done him; assured these Philosophers that he would not spare for any thing to accomplish this design, though it cost him his Crown; further promising to give them all that they should ask, if they would p
rform what they had said, nay, he promised to make them partakers with him in his Kingdome if they would live in 
Cyprus;
 pray∣ing and entreating them to perform it with all speed.


You shall see it in short time answered the Phi∣losophers, but to attain your desires, you must provide us three Antient Vessels, which must be

 filled with Gold, wherewith we shall in such man∣ner blind 
Philarchus,
 and those who have the keeping of this miraculous 
Columne,
 that they shall as well be deprived of that, as they were of the unextinguishable fire, which they had in their Citty.


The King of 
Cyprus
 who was very rich, see∣ing their demands were so small, said to the Philosophers, if Gold will finish the enchant∣ment of the 
Columne
 of 
Rhodes,
 we will easily attain our ends, as your selves shall see; and thereupon he shewed them his great treasure, telling them they might take as much as they pleased; and that they should fill certain Anti∣ent Vessels which he had furnished them with∣all.


The Philosophers having made choice of three Vessels, one made of Earth, and the other of Brass, and the third of Silver, they filled them with Gold, as much as a man could carry, and having taken their leaves of the King, they de∣parted for 
Rhodes
 in a Friggat which they had provided, were being landed, they each of them took one of these vessels under their Arms, going strait to the Citty of 
Rhodes,
 and being neer it they buried one of their Vessels in a place which they took special notice of; then going into the Citty, they did the same with the other two, burying them neer to the principal Church of the Citty, so ordering the Earth that it could not be discerned, that the place had been lately dig∣ed.




This being done and they having remained some time in 
Rhodes,
 and agreed among themselves how they should accomplish what they had promised the K
ng of 
Cyprus;
 they went, early one morning to King 
Philarchus,
 of whom having demanded private audience, and obtained it, they told him they three were Brethren, and that they had spent all their time in the study of Sciences, and obersly in the Art of Magick; wherein they had so well profited, that by the means of their knowledg, and of certain Sacrifi∣ces and Invocations which they made alwayes; observing th
 di position of the Moon, each of them saw in the night time, certain treasure that was buri∣ed in any place neer unto th
se parts where they at present did reside; and having known by their Art, that the Citty of 
Rhodes
 did abound in hidden trea∣sures more than any o
her place in the world; they were theref
re come thither to practice their know∣ledg, which they had no intenti
n to d
, without first having the Licence and permission of his Majesty, entreating him to permit them to make discovery of those hidden treasur
, wh
ch rem
ining under ground wer
 unp ofitabl
 
o any, p
omiseing to give him all that should be fou
d, and tha
 he might bestow on them what part of it h
 sh
uld p
ase.


Philarchus
 hearing this discourse of the Philoso∣pher, could not at first believ
 that they were so skilful as they professed themselves to be but having examined them about other pert
cular affairs, in which he found them knowing, he changed his mind, and esteemed them to be wise men, as indeed th
y were so that he resolved to make tryal of their knowledg, in regard that he himself had heard, that in the

 Isse of 
Rhodes
 (which had alwayes been accounted very rich) several measure
 had b
en found out, which had been formerly b
ried in the 
ime of the wars, and therefore having cour
eously 
ceaved them, he with cheerful countenance told them that they were very welcome, offering them lodging in his Castle, so long as they should please to stay at 
Rhodes,
 and that he would take order for all such ne∣cessary provision as they should please to have; they having very humbly thanked the King, l
dged in the Castle, concluding thus with him, that so soon as they should understand by their Art that the M
on was in a condition for them to make their S
crifices a
d in∣vocations, they would acquaint the King therewith, so that he with his own ey
s might see the truth which they had told him. This 
Philarchus
 very well approved of, who having took leave of the Philoso∣phers, caused them to be honorably entertained in the Castle, commanding the Masters of his house, and all his other Officers and Treasurers to give them all they they should desire, and to provide all necessaries for them.


Some dayes af
r this the Philosophers told the King 
Philarchus,
 th
 the M
on was very well dispo∣sed for them to make their Sac
fice
, so that the following night the youngest of the three would have a Vision and Rev
la
i n.


The King being very gl
d of this advertisement, prayed them to put their off
irs in so good order, that they might not loose that opportunity, where∣upon these knavish Philosopher
 put on their Priestly habits, & having sanctifyed & purifyed him who was to see the vision by persume & holy waters & h
v
ng

 made their invocations and Sacrifices, with a world of Ceremonies which they said were necessary, they wraped him who was to divine, in the skins of those beasts that they had Sacrificed, and having left him there alone (for they told the King that it was con∣venient so to do) they went to rest themselves, have∣ing first assured the King, that the n
xt morning he should have Intelligence of some hidden Treasure; the King being so near seeing the experience of the Philosophers promises, was so impatient that, that night seemed to be a whole year, thinking the day ne∣ver come soon enough, to make proof of the truth or falsehood of these three Brothers. So that as soon as day break he went to the Philosophers lodgings, who making him believe that they were in contemplation and prayer, did not stir un
ill such time as the King entring their Chamber, asked how the matter went; whe
eupon these Rascalls feigning to be awaked from a deep sleep, made th
ir obeysance to him, saying that it would not be long before the D
eamer would come out, whom they must attend so that they nor no other persons might en
er into the place where he was. And thereup
n so 
n after th
 Dreamer came forth from his Chamber, cloathed in his Priestly ha∣b
liments requisite for the visions he was to see. On a sudden the Philosophers prostrated themselves on their knees before him; a
vising the King to do the same, saying that this honour appertained to those who had been all the night in the counsel of the Gods so that they were made participators of the divinity of those G
ds with whom they had comunicated, & then after that the Dreamer had caused himself to be adored for some certaine time, he made a sign with his hand that his Priestly habits should be taken off, & his

 own put on; then being dressed in his usuall Clothes he said to the King Sir, I bring you good news by the Revelation of the God 
Pluto,
 who hath power over all the Treasures that are out of the power & man∣nagement of men. I therefore tell you that this night I have seen a Vessel of earth full of Gold, in a place without the City and yet very near the same, which was hidden there many a hundred year since; the place is without the Eastern Gate, 333. paces from the City wals, in a direct line against the Sun-rising, so that with the help of an Astraloble 
I
 can easily shew you the place where the Treasure lies: And be∣cause according to the Revelation which 
I
 have had, this Treasure is to be discovered at six of the Clock in the morning let us readily pray to God 
Pluto
 for to find us upon the place at the hower he hath appointed Assuring you Sir, that since we find Treasure without the City, that we may very well expect to find grea∣ter abundance within it. The King being joyfull to hear what this Dreamer had said, desired the company to return thanks to God 
Pluto,
 according to the u∣sual Ceremonies, and that he would not fail at the hour appointed, to be at the place where the Gold was hidden, saying that he would be there himself, to see the issue of the business, this the Philosophers ap∣proved of that the King finding what they had said was true, should put the more confidence in them, to believe what else they should acquaint him with, so that by this means they might execute what they had intended. Having returned thanks according to their ceremonies they mounted on horseback to follow the King and principal Courtiers, and they went to∣wards that gate without wch the Philosopher had said the treasure was hidden acording to his relation when they were come thither, the dreaming Philosopher

 tooke an Astrolabe and a Q
adrant to find out the full 
ast, where he was to pr
ce
d and to measure Geom
tric
lly the Pac
s between the Wals and the plac
 where t
e Treasure was to be. And having dilligently mea
ured it, he assured the King and the Company that in that very place the Treasure was; and then having inv
ked the G
d 
Pluto,
 he caused them to dig with fresh assurance that it was the right place. T
e King 
ging to 
ee the truth of this as∣sa
, commanded to dig wi
al dilligence, carefully ob
erving what the Pion
e
 did do: But it was not long before the Pione
r
 did discover the Vessel which the King 
eeing, he hims
lf wou
d take it up to see what was in i
; and finding it to be just as the Phi∣losopher had said, he r
tu
ned towards the Castle very well satisfied, honouring and treating the Philo∣sophers w
th all kindness; hoping by their means to be Master of a world of Gold. And after he had gi∣ven them great presents, he e
quired when they might have another Revelation? to t
is they answered that they must be governed by the Moon, and that they must wait untill another change o
 the Moon, because the aspect
 of the Moon and Sun, which was requi∣si
e on this occasion; happened b
 once in a moneth, assuri
g the King that they w
uld advertise him when the time should come, wh
 in expectation thereof indeavoured to ho
ur and pleasu
e them in all that he could. In fine, the enc
easing of the Moon come∣ing 
h
y acquainted the King that the following night the e would be a vision, which the midlemost of the three was to be concerned in, and therefore having per
med th
ir o
dinary sacrifice, and observed the same order that 
I
 have before related to you. The

 next day the King coming to them, the Dreamer said to him Sir, I have good news, for this day we shall find in the Citty twice as much Gold as we found the other day, and having remarked the place where the Treasure was to be, and found it out by means of the Astralobe and the Q
adrant, and having used the usual Ceremonies, they began to dig neer the Temple in that place where the Philosophers had bu∣ried the two other Vessels, having placed one much deeper than the other; also the Dreamer had told that the Treasure which he had seen was contained in two Vessels of Me
tle whereof the one vvas richer than the other, and that the richest would be the deepest in the ground; wherefore after they had for some time digged they began to discover the br zen Vessel, and following their work as the Philosopher directed they also found the Vessel of Silver, both which were filled with Gold. This did so encrease the affection of King 
Philarchus
 towards these Rascally Philoso∣phers, that he did nothing without their advice and counsell, and had them always in his Company commanding that they should be honoured as he himself was.


And now was be in great expectation to see the ef∣fects of the third Philosophers vision, which was to be at the third Moon, and on the other side the Philo∣sophers thought of nothing more but the means how they should performe their promise, which they had made to King 
Nichomachus;
 acording to which de∣sign they went one morning early to the King, to whom they with cheerful Countenances told that the Moon was disposed for the vision, so that the fol∣lowing night they should have the third Revelation

 which would concern the most antient of the three 
Philarchus
 being very joyful at this news command∣ed that all things requisite for their Sacrifice, should be provided: And now using greater Ceremonies then ordinary, as the age of the person required, at their desire every one departed expecting what the Dreaming Philosopher would say the next morning; after the Sun was up the three Philosophers went to the Kings lodgings, the Dreamer being in the middle whither being come, he with smiling countenance said. Sir▪ g ve me your hand, for I bring you the best news you have had this long time; know then that in the Citty, not far from hence there is a Treasure three times as large as that which we have already found, and the Vessels that contain it are much more rich than the others: true it is that there will be some difficulty to come at it, for 
Pluto
 seeing the greatness of the Treasure, hath placed it very deep in the earth yet that shall be but li
tle hindrance, for since it is discovered it will be free.


The place 
here the Treasure it posited, it six hun∣dred paces from the Pallace, (you may take notice that these Rascalls had taken the pains privately to measure the distance which was between the 
Columne
 and the Pallace) di
ectly towards the South, which was the very place where the 
Columne
 stood. The King hearing this news was very well pleased, and pressed the Philosophers to make hast and find out the place; whereupon he went accompanied with diverse Princes and Lords▪ where being come the Dreaming Philosopher began to Calculate the distance of the place by the Astralobe and having marked by the Quadrant the exact place of the last pace, it happened

 to be exact
y in the midst of the Pedestal, and of the Base of the 
Columne,
 and having measured and calculated very exactly, he affi
med that the treasure was placed directly under the 
Columne.


Philarchus
 seeing this began to be suspitious, so that he looked as white as a Clout, appearing to be more like a Ghost than a living man, but spake cleer∣ly, that he would not by no means suffer any digging under the 
Columne
 choosing rather to be without the gold & lose all that he already had rather than hazard the miraculon 
Columne,
 wch might truly be said to be the 
Columne
 and prop to the Kingdome of 
Rhodes;
 to this the Antient Philosopher answered, that truly it would be great imprudence to hazard so rich and so excellent a treasure as the 
Columne
 was, which surpassed and exceeded all the treasures in the world; and that only to gain another lesser treasure which was hidden in the earth, but if so great a treasure might be attained as that which was hidden without damageing the m
raculous 
Columne,
 that then it would be indiscretion to let it alone there. I dare un∣dertake said he, and so may others to keep this 
Co∣lumne
 with Timber which I will place round about it, which shall support it as formerly, that it shall be impossible to damage it, and these Engines shall be so strong, and so orderly placed, that you may dig under the foundation as much as you will, without the least prejudice in the world, and when the trea∣sure is taken from underneath it, a new and better foundation may be laid, then that which is there now, whereby the miraculous 
Columne
 may perpetually perform its office.


King 
Philarchus
 hearing this, began to consider, yet being still fearful of hazarding his rich 
Columne,


 but withal very desirous to have the treasure which he certainly believed was underneath; wherefore he desired the Philosopher to make a case for the 
Co∣lumne,
 as soon as possibly he could, and to pro∣vide the other Engines to support it according to his best skill saying that as he found the Engines to be strong, he would consider whether he would have any digging under the 
Co∣lumne
 or not. The Philosopher who desired no more, being very glad that they had brought the King to this point, in very cheerful manner told him, so Sir be confident of this, that the Engin which we shal make, shall be so strong that they shall be not only capable of sustaining the miraculous 
Columne,
 but sufficient to support a Tower, so that all the digging that shall be used under it, shall not move it, but it shall remain as firm as if fixt on a sure foundation; and thereupon they made an Engine of wood to be as a case to the 
Columne,
 so that nothing could harm or touch it, this being done as the Pyoneers wrought, these Phi∣losophers were very curious that the 
Columne
 should suffer no prejudice by dust, and the better to preserve it, they covered that and the four Animals which served as supporters with cloathes, and they fil∣led all the void places between the Case and the 
Columne
 with Wool; but these Traitors pri∣vately mixed Pitch and Tarre, not permitting any to h
ve a hard in this p
etended preservation of the 
Columne,
 and that for fear that their treason should be discov
red; after this was done they desired the King and several Engineers to take a view of the Engines they had made to support the 
Columne;
 and this view being made, it was agreed on all hands that they might with safety dig under the 
Columne;


 whereupon the King was well pleased and contented, and commanded that without any delay they should proceed to digging; then the Pyoneers began, but although they d gged all day, yet they found nothing, nay, they cont
nued their work for part of the night, which the Philosopher seeing, he pretended to mea∣sure and c
lculate with his Astralobe, and having been dilligent in his calculation, he told the King that the treasure was yet as deep agen in the ground as they had digged; and therefore it would be convenient to deferre the digging untill the next morning, assuring him, that he should then see great matters.


Upon his promise the King retired, very desirous to see this great treasure discovered, certainly believe∣ing that i
 would be very great; considering that which had been already found out, and which in con∣clusion was too great for him, for instead of a trea∣sure which he thought to finde, he lost that wch was of more vaine than all the treasures in the World.


The Philosophers having made provision of all things necessary for the finishing their treason, and being assured of a Friggat, they went about mid∣night, when all the world were asleep, to the place where the 
Columne
 stood, and having anointed and bedaubed the case and wooden Engine, and all the Materials about the 
Columne
 with Oyl, Grease, and other ingredients fit to take fire, they put a barrel of Pitch, Sulpher and other Materials just underneath the 
Columne,
 and having set fire to it, on a suddain it made a terrible execution,


The Philosophers seeing this, and finding all things to be as they desired▪ and that the 
Columne
 could not possibly escape being destroyed, and knowing

 they had no more to do at 
Rhodes,
 they embarqued themselves in their Friggat, where they had pri∣vately conveyed not only their Gold and Silver, but also several rich things which they had of the Kings; which they easily procured, as having liberty to take any thing they had a mind to without any contra∣diction, for so the King had commanded, and the Mariners plyed their Oars so lustily, that by the next morning they had lost the sight of 
Rhodes,
 in which there was a great uproar; for these Traitors had pla∣ced so much wood about the 
Columne,
 under pretence of securing it, that it caused so great a fire, that it not only consumed the 
Columne
 which was their prin∣cipal design; but also the Arch of Marble under which the 
Columne
 was placed, at the fall of which there was so great a noise as if the whole Pallace of King 
Philarchus
 had fallen into ruin; at the noise of which all the People did run to see what was the mat∣ter, and so did the King too: who now too late saw his Covetuousness, but however he commanded seve∣ral things to be done: to see if the 
Colum
 might be pre∣served, but all his endeavours were ineffectual, for not only the Arch but the 
Colum
 were both wholy ruined.


The people perceiving this, many of them ran with violence to the lodging of the Philosophers, and there they understood that they were gone, and had carried much of the Kings treasure with them; and then their suspition was cleered that all this ruin came by the only treason of the Philosophers; who being arrived at 
Cyprus
 were welcomed by King 
Nichoma∣chus,
 who gave them much treasure in recompence of their good service, whereby they had empoured him to be revenged on King 
Philarchus.


In the mean time the poor 
Rhodians
 were very

 much troubled, that they were deprived of that which served for a defence, not only to the Citty of 
Rhodes,
 but to all the Island; and it was not long before their sorrow was increased, by means of King 
Ni∣chomachus,
 who having privatly raised great Forces, and obtained the alliance and friendship of divers Princes of 
Natolia,
 who were troubled at the pow∣er of the 
Rhodians
 their Neighbours; fell upon the Isle of 
Rhodes
 being unprovided, and so well prosecu∣ted their intentions, that they took the Citty, and King 
Philarchus
 had hardly the liberty to avoid the fury of the war, who from being a powerful Prince, was reduced to the necessity to turn Schoolmaster, & teach publickly in the Isle of 
Metolin.


And thus as the unextinguishable fire which was of so great commodity t the poor 
Rhodians,
 was put out by the sottishness of a Schollar, so the Citty of 
Rhodes
 was taken and pillaged by the cunning ma∣chinations of the Philosophers, and the King of that Island forced to confine himself as a banished man, into an Island, there to spend the remainder of his mise∣rable life.


To apply this History to the present occasion, I am fearful that the same calamnities may befall you, since the experience is already begun at 
Rome;
 where 
I
 may truly say these 2 marvails were. For I dare boast my self to have been that fire and burning lamp of honor, which the Ladies and Damsels of 
Rome
 owe unto their husbands, so that from me they m
ght take example of their duty; but I may say this immortal fire of honor is extinct, not only by the sottishness, but by the disordinate appetite of a Schollar▪ who under pretence of being your Son, i
 your Capital Enemy: and although the integrity

 of my faith did make him such resistance, that he did not obtain his will upon me, yet however the in∣famy still remains imprinted in the minds of all men, considering the great delayes which from day to day you make to avoid the execution of that just sentence which you have given against him. The consideration of which doth much trouble me, more out of respect to you than my self, but my heart is ready to burst to see the cunning contrivances that are used to ruin and destroy this most firm and strong 
Columne
 which has served as a safegua
d both to 
Rome
 and all the Empire; being so clee
 that by its brightness it hath frustrated all the designs and enterprizes of those who design to raise arms against the Empire. This Sir is your prudence wherein formerly every one might see as in a looking glass, that which con∣cern'd the repose of all in general, so that being in its luster, and standing on its foundation, there is nothing that can prejudice the estate of the Empire; against which I see several treasons designed, not by three, but by seven, who have the title of Philosophers, ha∣ving abandoned themselves to all vices, only tending to the deliverance of 
Erastus,
 that he may take pos∣session of the Empire before his time; by means of their cursed and pernicious Coun
e
s▪ to deprive you of your Estate, that they may at their wills manage the affairs of the Empire; and because nothing can resist their designe, but the 
Columne
 of 
our prudence they endeavour to undermine it by the various subtle wayes which they use to set all on fire as the other three did; and truly they are not far from accom∣plishing their ends; for they have already caused you to doubt of that truth which hath appeared before

 your eyes: wherefore Sir while you have yet time open the eyes of your understanding, and do not permit the false and indirect inventions and machina∣tions of these Traytors, to bereave us with our ho∣nor (which already it much shaken) both of our E∣states and lives.


These complaints of the Empress were spoken with so much earnestness, that the Emperour con∣ceited that all the good advertisements which tho Philosophers gave him, were to no other purpose but to deceive him, so that he presently commanded that they should be committed to prison, promising the Empress that the next day should not pass, but she should see her self revenged both of 
Erastus
 and the Philosophers, and that he did not doubt but that the Philosophers were Traitors as she had wisely disco∣vered. The Empress being very well contented ap∣peared more pleasant than usual, and lay that night with the Emperour, only waiting for the hour, wherein her wicked and perverse desires should be ac∣complished by the death of her Son in law, & the in∣nocent Philosophers.








CHAP. XX.
 The Philosopher 
Lencus
 perswadeth the Emperour to leave the cause of Prince 
Erastus
 to the Senate, by a Letter which he writ to him, demonstrating the danger of being guided in any Importunate case by the counsel of a Woman; and this he made out by the discourse of a Phisitian of 
Milain.
 Who having lost his only Son by the inducement of his Wife; who hindred him from giving to the Child in a violent distemper something which the Child demanded, and which the Phisitians had not forbidden, & after find∣ing by experience that the Child by a certain natural instinct asked for that which would have cured him, out of despair, he first killed his wife, and then himself.


IN pursuance of the Emperours command, the Guard immediatly se zed on the seven Philoso∣phers, who were chained and fettered, and put every one in a several Prison, that they might not conferre wi
h one another, and th
y were told that they must suffer death the n
xt day after the execution of the Prince 
Erastus,
 which was to be per∣formed in the morning, according to the former sentence. Those w
o had 
he custody of the Prince did likewise discourse after this manner; so that he heard of it, which did not so much trouble him as the Detension of his seven Masters who were his faithful Advocates, so that he could not for∣bear manifesting by evident signs the great trouble

 that he was in; and being reduced to a kind of des∣pair, he was upon the point of breaking silence, not valuing his own life, so as thereby hi
 Masters might 
ape and be discharged; yet con
ing the neces∣sity of the Caelestial influences, against which it was impossible for man to resist, and be
ieving that accord∣ing to the dispositions of the Heavens, that not only his own life but his Masters consisted in his seven dayes silence, six whereof were already passed, he therefore resolved not to speak, assuring himse
 upon the great wisdom of his Masters, who would not fail to finde some means to stay the execution of the sen∣tence; although they were imprisoned. In hopes of this although there was but little probability; he en∣deavoured to comfort himself. The Philosophers on their parts were as much troubled, being out of hope of life, which did not so much trouble them, is that they had no way to d
fend the poor innocent 
Erastus.


But above all the Philosopher 
Lencus,
 whose turn it was to defend the Prince 
Erastus
 the seventh day, he was much troubled, for he had prepared so pa∣theticall an Oration, that although the Emperour should be never so obstinate, yet he assured himself by his Oration to move the Senate and People to take the young Prince out of Prison and secure him for some time, till the Emperours anger should be over. But now he being secured in a Prison where his Ora∣tion would be to little purpose he was so dejected that he was alm
st out of his wits; yet however he did intend to do his utmost for his young Master, and in regard he had not the conveniency of speaking, he resolved to write to the Emperour, and having Pen, Ink and Paper, he thus began.




TO the Emperour 
Dioclesian,
 one of his faithful Counsellors sendeth greeting. The duty which oblieges all men to serve each other, and the truth of which I have always made profession, together with the fidelity which I owe to my soveraign Lord and Prince, hath constrained me Sir, to declare to you by Writing, that which with a good will I should have spoken by word of mouth: The matter being of such importance, that your honour and reputation and quiet of the Empire de∣pendeth thereon; you being established in the Govern∣ment thereof, ought not only to give audience to those who demand it, but it is also convenient for you to change your mind, when it contradicted by reason; for that man who hath the mannagement of publique affairs, ought not to be stiffe in his opinion but to alter his mind as often, as to the publique good it shall appear to be necessary; and if he ought to be thus observant in af∣fairs of small importance, how much more is an Em∣perour engaged in great affairs, nay in those wherein consist the safety or 
uin of the Empire; and I question not but you will do so, provided you will lay aside your passion which every M
gistrate ought to do; and have patience to read what 
I
 now write unto you, not for my particular interest but out of respect to your self who are my Soveraign Prince, and for the consequen
 which may happen to the Empire, the repose and good whereof entirely depends upon that which is now in question; for as justice causeth Common wealth and Empires to encrease, so on the contrary where iniquity and inordinate affections reign & wher justice is wan∣ting, all things go from bad to worse. And of this we every day see a world of experiences which are manifest enough to us all; and we are sure that there is no Mo∣narchy

 nor Empire so firmly fixed, but injustice in short time destroys it which entring the brest of a great E∣state produceth most dangerous fruits and ffects: Now no person is more remarkable than an Emperour; and if histories which have made so great mater of the severity of 
Br
tus
 & 
orquatu
,
 who are so m
morable for their cruelty although when they put their Children to death it was for violating the Laws. With what 
nfamy then will the Emperour 
Dioclesian
 be noted for putting to death his only Son without hearing any thing in his de∣fence, which is a thing contrary to all Laws and ordi∣nances, humane anal divine; for there is no Nation so Barbarous, to execute a Criminall without giving him a competent time to Justifie himself.


Is it then possible that the Emperour 
Dioclesian
 who hath always been esteemed a just Prince, and an obser∣ver of right shall now introduce a custom so inhumane and cruel as this. If the authority of the Senate doth not at all move you, or if you doubt that Prince 
Erastus
 shall escape while you proceed orderly, are not your Pri∣sons strong enough, and well guarded with Soldiers, is there any 
enato
s Prince or Barron, to whom you have been pleased 
 sp
k of this affair, who hath not endea∣vored to divert you from t
 is hasly execution, and none hastens you therein but the venemous rage of a woman by whose counsel a 
Roman
 Emperono can get nothing but blame, let the Counsel be never so good; and there∣fore what infancy will you procure to your self to use contrary to all reason so great cruelty at the only per∣swasions of a woman. Know Sir, that women are made to serve men, and not to counsel them and he who is ab∣lutely governed by their counsel shall in the end to bis damage repent thereof; for although a woman is desire∣ous

 to give good counsel, yet the imbecillity of the sex causes their counsel alwayes to happen to the worst as not long since it happened to a Physitian; which story be pleased to read.


It is not long since that at 
Millain
 there was a Physitian named 
Polictetus
 in very great esteem of all, as well by reason of his wealth, as for the opini∣on which every one had of his knowledge; so that he was esteemed the principal and most famous Phy∣sitian of 
Millain,
 and indeed he deserved this title, having performed many almost incredible Cures.


This Physitian had for wife a Damsel of 
Millain
 named 
Flaminia
 who was one of the principal fami∣lies of that City, by whom he had one only Son, and no other Children. But although nature had been niggardly in giving him but one, yet in recompence she was very liberal, having formed this Child so fair and of so gentle a spirit that it was pleasant to behold him, for being but seaven years of age, he gave hopes not onely to his Father and Mother, but also to all that beh
ld him, that in time he would be a great personage and of reputation; for which cruse his Father l
ved him more then his own life and caused him to beinstructed and exercised in all exercises, as well of the body as the mind, proper and convenient for that age; finding him very well disposed to Sci∣ences, well formed in his body, strong in his mem∣bers as having never been sick.


It happened when he was nine years old, he fell in∣to a distemper which in the beginning seemed to be small; which his father seeing would take the advice

 of other Physitians, although he himself was esteemed the first; for fe
r his affection in his own case should deceive him. Having therefore brought two of the most experienced Physitians of 
Millain
 to his house he recomended his Son to them; however he himself took notice of what they ordered. This disease of the Child which at the first was small and slight, did daily increase so that instead of diminishing, by means of the remedies, which were given yet he every day grew worse and worse, and thus it continued for a moneths time; all which time the Physitians did all that was possible according to Art, for the health of the Child, without perceiving any amendment but or the contrary he was the worse for every thing they give him: The poor father was almost desperate and so were the Physitians, who now resolved to g
ve him no more Medecines, but only to comfort and fortify nature by restoratives, that he might live as long as he could, being out of hopes of restoring him to his former health; the Child finding himself as sick as his heart could hold, desired them to give him a white Onion to eat; to this the Physitians would not con∣sent, in regard an Onion is contrary to a feavour, and yet all the while the disease encreased so much the more did the Child cry out for an Onion, say∣ing if they would not give him a white Onion he should dye.


The Physitians seeing there was no other reme∣dy for him agreed that he should have an Onion, more to content him then any thing else, say∣ing that, that could not do him much prejudice considering the violence of his distemper; and having sent for a white Onion to give him, the Childs Mother

 another came into the the Chamber, who seeing them a∣bout to give him an Onion, fell into the greatest pas∣sion in the world; saying that this was to kill her Child, and that she could not endure it to be a Mur∣dress of her own blood, and she made such a noise to her husband, and the other Phisicians, that the Onion was not given to the Child, whereupon the Child took it so to heart, that he did not languish long be∣fore he dyed, still even to death crying out after his Onion.


The Father and Mother were as much grieved a
 can be imagined, having no other Child but his wherein was all their comfort, and being out of hopes of having any more, af
er the death of the Child, the Phsitians were desirous to op
n the body, at this the Father was was well contented, being desirous to know the cause of that distemper, which no Phisick had p
wer to cure, he being then opened, there was found on the b
tom of his stomach, neer to his heart, a peice 
 Ice hard as Christal, at which they were all astonished, to see water thus congealed in a humain body, and they all agreed that there was no c
g of him, but by things proper to desolve the 
 
ol; and that the Child dyed for want of such Remedies, the poor Father who alwayes had his Son before his eyes, in respect of the great love he had for him, that he might have some mark and token caused this Christal to be enchased in the haft of a knife, which he usually carryed about him upon all occasions, and when he drew it, he alwayes kissed the Christal in memory of his Son; and thus it passed for a whole year, but on that very day twelve moneth that his son dyed (whether by chance or that Na∣ture

 was willing to shew the greatness of its secrets) this Phisitian being at the Table, had a mind to eat a white Onion, one being brought him hercut it in to peices with his knife, and having tasted a slice or too, he asked for drink, and let his knife fall on part of the Onion that was on the Table, but he had no sooner drank, whe
 going to take his knife, he found it without a haft, for the Christal that wa
 fixed thereon was dissolved, and diligently searching the cause, he knew that the vertue of the Onion had de∣solved the Christal into water; wherefore being a wise man, he conjectured that his Son by a secret in∣stinct of Nature, was so importunate before he dyed to have a white Onion, as being the sole remedy, and only expedient for his disease, so that understanding that he had caused the death of his only Son, by de∣nying him an Onion, only at the perswasions of a woman, contrary to the directions of him, and the other Phisitians, he took his knife in one hand, and the peice of the Onion in the other, saying with sighs and tears, Ah poor and unfortunate Father, you now see the great evil, which you have caused; this day it is just twelve moneths, that by my own fault I lost my only Son, and that 
I
 might know my misfortune, the Heavens have this day made me see it; who will not blame my sottishness, knowing that I have caused the death of my only Son, by following the di∣rections of a foolish and distracted woman. Now 
I
 know it but too late, that Nature shewed her self as bountiful in preserving my Son, as she was liberal in bestowing him upon me; behold the sign, behold the Christal dissolved, by vertue of the white Onion which my poor Child so often desired to have, but

 in vain, whereat Nature being angry, hath made me understand and know to take such vengeance of me as I deserve; and to serve for a perpetual example to all men, not to give credit to this sotteri
s & malig∣nities of their wives; my Son being dead, who other∣wise by the course of Nature might have lived long, shall I live? 
I
 who have caused his death? It shall not be so, I cannot endure my self, such a mischief shall not go unpunished, and on a sud
in when he had spo∣ken thus, he thrust the kni
e which he held into his wives b
ea
, a
d 
hen did as much to himself; and that with such quickness, that those who were pre∣sent, and who melted in tears, thus to hear the poor Father complain, did not mind him, and much less had the means to hinder what he did.


This was the end of poor 
Polectetus,
 who to his great prejud
ce found the danger of being governed by the counsel of a woman; for if the counsel of a woman be bad, when sh
 thinks to do well, as it was with the poor 
Flaminia,
 what is it then when she is moved with rage and fury.


The means which the Empress uses up
n this ac∣count I sh
ll let pass, because Sir your Maj
sty is best acquainted therewith: but I dare say and affirm, that if you suffer your self to be over ruled by her, and cause your Son to dye, without well considering of the matter, I doubt nor but it will happen to you, as it did to 
Polictetus,
 and it may be worse; and yet 
I
 do not conclude that Prince 
Erastus
 ought not to suffer death, if what he is accused of be found to be true, and that the Philosophers escape death who instead of instructing him in vertuous courses and good learning; have rendred him so unnatural,

 and given to sensuallity. Yet however I once again urge, that in this point you do not depend upon the sole words of a woman, nor to those who on this oc∣casion are transported with passion, as you your self are, for the wrong you think you have received; which if it should be true there should be no torment nor pain how great soever, which should not be thought li
l
, in comparison to such an excess; But all those who know and are acquainted with the ver∣tues, and gre
t continence of young Prince 
Erastus,
 are of another mind. And therefore not only to con∣tent your mind, as belongs to so great a Prince as you are; I pray, Exhort, and Counsel you to leave this affair to the Senate. And in case Prince 
Erastus
 be found guilty of the fact, that he dye miserably by the hand of justice, and with him the seven Philosophers, who have instructed him so wickedly; and on the contrary if he be found Innocent, that his Innocence he not oppressed. And do not think Sir, that 
I
 say this to prolong this cause, and by this means escape death, for I onely desire three days time for the Philoso∣phers; in which time if they do not cleerly make ap∣pear the Innocence of your Son, and if he himself do not Justifie himself wi hin that time, that he be put to death, and with him the seven Philosophers, begin∣ning with me 
Lencus,
 who have writ this present Letter; not having at the beginning put the name of him who sent it, lest (considering the great hatred you bear to us) you should refuse to read it, seeing it directed by one of us; & therefore wonder not Sir, at what I send you word, that your son shall Justifie himself; for the cause of his not speaking hitherto comes not by any natural default which he hath, nei∣ther

 is it occasion'd by the accident for wch we are de∣teyned, but it is caused by a certain great Mistery & se∣cret, which you shall understand from him within two days if you have the patience to let him live so long: Praying the Gods that your life be long and happy.






This is the Story or example which 
Lencus
 the Philoso∣pher did write, and send in a Letter to the Emper∣our, and as I find it in the Originals 
Italian
 and 
French;
 but others say it was an other Story, which I thus relate to you.




A woman having buried her husband is resolved to dye in his Ʋault and will therefore stay with his body. A Soldier (who is appointed to Watch a Rogues bo∣dy, that was hanged on a 
Gibbet
) comes to the Ʋault to the woman, perswades her to drink and eat, and enjoyes her; in the mean time the Rogues body is stolen from the 
Gibbet.
 The Souldier is dis∣tracted being to dye for his neglect; he therefore at∣tempts to kill himself but the woman hinders him, & helps to hang her husbands body where the Rogues was.




A Gentleman of 
Rome
 who was blessed with a large estate, had for his sole heir, or Daughter of an incomparable beauty and Ingenious Soul, and having been carefull to give her vertuous education, she by that Addition had so honourable a fame, that all the young men of quality in those parts became her Suitors; but it being impossible for her to be the lawful prize for them all, she at length was so importunatly courted by one, that she was espoused to him. He who was thus happy in her love & enjoment was a Gentleman, in whom nothing was wanting that could be req
ired to make him accomplisht and ami∣able, especially in her eye, who loved him with equal

 ardours, and thought of no felicity, but in his mutual affections and Society, so that all men (his envous. Rivals only excepted) expected from so fare an Uni¦on, would proceed all mortal happiness in perfection. But observe the unconstancy of humane felicity, these two Lovers had not long enjoyed each other when fate (seldome long favourable to Lovers) steps in and divides them, by the Eternal divorce of death; translating the husband into an other life, and leaving the Widdow almost liveless, for so had her grief made her, and nothing kept her from using violence on her self, that she might enjoy him in the 
Elizium
 shader but the desire of seeing him laid into his Tomb, with such Funerall Pomp and solemne obsequies, as were agreeable both to her sorrow and his quality; and that affair being once over, she resolved that it should not be long ere her Spirit were remitted to his, to re∣gain that content in the other World, which had been ravisht from her in this; and to perfect this resolution she made a rigorous vow that she would receive no nu∣rishment to continue her in this world, but by her ab∣stinence hasten her to the other; & thus she continued for some days & nights, notwithstanding the impor∣tunities of her relations, and the necessities of nature urged her to comiserate & relieve her self: And as if this had not been sufficient to exalt her sorrowes, she goe
 privately into the Vault where her husbands bo∣dy remained, & siting down on the damp earth, fixt her eyes upon his Coffin as the proper object of her dis∣tracted fancy. At the same time that this her hus∣bands Corps was deposited in a Tomb in the earth a notorious Malefactor was condemned to the Gibbet and his body to remain hanging in the aire that it might serve for terrour & example to all othe crimi∣nals

 & that all spectators might abhor his crimes & lest any of the vilains relations or confederators, should take down the carcass by night; Proclamation was made to forbid it, & a guard of Soldiers order'd to watch it, with no less penalty than death, to those that should neglect their duty; & the night being come, the Soldiers thinking one would be enough to watch the 
Gibbet:
 they cast lots who should perform that duty, while the others went to a Tavern hard by to secure themselvs from the cold; they being gone, our Sentinal appli'd himself to perform his duty, but he finding it to be cold, & believing none would hazard their lives to steal away the carcass of a Rogue: he bethinks himself of shelter & rest, & remembring that there was aspaci∣ous arch'd Vault, he retired thither & being entred he saw a weak light, that was at some distance, wondring thereat but being confident and bold he went thither∣wards & perceiving a woman in a mournful dress, but with a countenance far more mournful, siting on the ground & casting her eyes upon a Coffin. He admires the obiect, wch indeed deserv'd admiration (being as I told you our desolate Matron) who notwithstanding all her sorrow, did discover a certain charming lustre such as is wont to strike respect & adoration into the hearts of the beholders; & cannot be concealed by the most altering disguise of the greatest passion. At this sight he was so amazed that he wanted not much of becoming a Statue: But he resuming his courage, & be∣ing about to speak to her, she lifting up her eyes saw a man or Ghost standing before her; & although at first she was startled, yet her grief & melancholly had not so depriv'd of her courage, but that she soon spake to him after this manner. Friend said she (& certainly you can be no other to me who have no enemy but life) have you any thing to say, if you have speak fre∣ly,

 for 
I
 am not afraid of the worst news you can bring fate hath shot the cruelest of all its arrows already, all that are to follow will be but favours, my misery is al∣ready so great, that it cannot admit of any addition. Lo here (pointing to the coffin) nere lies my heart dead & cold as marble; & I am only here to prepare my, self to attend that shade, who by this time expects me; if your coming hither was by chance, I pray be gone & leave me the peace of this solitray place fit for mour∣ners, therefore lest you be guilty of a Prophanation; leave me to accomplish the sacrifice my fidelity & vow oblige me to offer in this place; she having uttered her mind the Soldier soberly replys: That no design but chance had brought him thither, that the sight of a wo∣man at that time, & in that place & posture had, caus'd his admiration & raised a curiosity to satisfie, which he had approached her, that if he had disturbed her in a∣ny thing, he beg'd her pardon; that he conceav'd him∣self innocent of any offence to those dead bodyes, he not in the least purposing to violate their Sepulchers; & lastly, if his presence were troublsome to her, he was ready to depart, but withal he offer'd all the succor he was able to afford, wch though mean; yet he desired her to accept of, & if his life might be serv
cable to her she might freely command it. The Matron observing the habit & armes of her visitant, & perceiving him to be a Soldier, had spoken somewhat roughly to him & expected as rude an answer, but seeing him so courte∣ous in his speech & intending to give him thanks and dismiss him in order thereto arose, but her tongue & legs both failed her, and she suddenly sank down in a swound, falling on her husbands Coffin; which the Sol∣dier seeing took her in his armes & bending her body pour'd a little wine into her mouth which he had in a bottle

 to comfort his own Spirits, & now prov'd very com∣fortable to her, for in short time she gave some signes of a recovery; he seeing the effects of a little Wine, and being unproivded of any better Restauratives, a∣gain made use of his bottle; and forcing some more of the Liquor down her throat it wrought so well & had such good effects on her weak body, that she opened her eyes, had the use of her legs; but being still weak she to rest them, sat down upon her husbands Coffin.


The Soldier seeing the success of his endeavors, was glad that he had been so well accomodated with Li∣quor; and believing that V ctuals would also be very necessary for strengthning of his patient, and he being provided of some which he had in his Knapsack about him, he therefor takes it out, and in an humble man∣ner and in as decent a posture he offers it to her, intrea∣ting her to be so Charitable to her self, as to refresh her weak body with such as he was t
ere furnished withal; he seeing her somewhat attentive to what he said, used more arguments to perswade her and al∣though he was no Philosopher or Oratour, nor his head so wel furn
sh'd wi h p
rsw
s
ve arguments as his Kn
psack and bottle had been of p
ovisi
n; yet the ef∣fects of the win
 and i
 s m
de
t though homely dis∣course, did in the 
 prevail with her to taste of his homely v ctuals, & having eaten moderately thereof, the aire of her countenance was changed & her face wch had been so cloudy was now cleer, pleasant, and cheerful: 
he man observing this alteration & believng it was n
c
ss
y to use some arguments to bring her to a true u
der
anding of her condition he therefore tel
 her 
hat 
 sorrow was to be used for the decease of our rel
tio
 & 
ds, yet it was to be bounded & moderated by reason which if we once laid aside or

 exceeded we became like the brute B
asts and indeed worse being unnatural to our selves, without doing any good, or availing any thing to the benefit of the dead; as to recalling them to life agen, and hazarding and endangering our own, contrary to the laws of Nature whereby every one is obleidged to endeavour their preservation as much as in them lyes, and if she had designed any thing against her own life (as he doubted she had) she ought instant∣ly to retract it, for as murder was the greatest crime humain nature could be guilty of, so much the more criminal were they that should be murderers of them∣selves, and that it was so detestable a crime that it was dangerous to presume that heaven would be so mer∣ciful as to satisfie it; and that it was most certain the Ghost of her Husband could receive no satisfacti∣on thereby, but be rather displeased, since if he loved her when living he could not allow of any violence she should offer to her self, but rather ab
or the so∣ciety of so great a Criminal.


The woman hearing that her visitant had done, re∣plyed, that indeed his discourses Were true, but she had such a subject of sorrow, as was not 
 be par∣ralled her loss had been so great th
 
lthough her grief were so too, yet she rather deserv
d pitty and excuse, than to be reprehended or condemned, and this short speech was accompanyed, n
t only with a deludge of tears, but another fit of fainting; the man of War and Phisick, for at this time he had acted the the Phisitian, seeing his Patient so far fr
m being cured, that he feared a relapse; had immediate re∣course to his only Medicine the Antidote of the bot∣tle, and holding up her head with one h
nd, with th
 other he drencheth her with a conside
 a 
e dose o


 the remaining licquor which was 
o sooner in her stomach, but she finding the warmth and vigour of it, was at it were reannimated, the fountains of her tears stopped, her forehead smoothed, and her face reduc
d to her Native sweetness, and this last draught did not only effect thus strangely on her body, but her minde also seemed to be perfectly restored to its antient mildness and tranquillity, for as if a new soul had been infused into her; she became the most affa∣ble, complaisant and cheerful Creature in the world, and indeed there was not only a change of humor, but also a perfect metamorphosis of her Person, that she seems not to be the same woman; for instead of a sorrowful widdow which she lately was, she now ap∣pears to be a most pleased and contented Bride. Her forehead seems to be smoothed, d lated to a graceful largeness, and spread with a sanguine dye. Her eyes though little more than half open, yet sparkling with lustre, and their amiable whites turned upward, and yet by stealth casting glances on her Visitant (such as dying persons and lovers in the extasie of delight are observed to us
.) Her lips w
re swelled with a delici∣ous vermillion 
ncture, her cheeks overflowed with pleasing blushes, her head a little d
clining as when modesty and desi
e have a secret confl
ct, and she is wholly poss
ssed with an impatient, though gentle dispute, and her spirits being highly agitated within so there was an effusion of them upon the outward parts, a temperate and balmy sweat, extilling from the Pores of her snow white skin; so that there was rea
on to suspect that this Matron (although still in the Cha
nel house, and sitting upon the coffin

 of her dearest all, whom she so lately lamented with so much violenc
) she 
I
 say we may suspect to be in Love, and that she now burns as extreamly in the flames of amorous desires of the Sold
er, as she was lately frozen in the Ice of sorrow for her husband: her looks and gestures betray her and all the ayres of high content and pleasure appear in her face: and that she may taste of those joyes 
he so much desires, she throws her self into the Soldiers arms she emb
ac
th him, she k sses him & wi
h that violence as if she were unsati
fied with th
 bare touches of his lip
; a
d l ng∣ed to leave the impression of hers upon them & when she had feasted her lips with touching, 
 feasted her eyes with beholding their bel
ved obj
ct; in a word there is nothing of liberty, dalliance, caresses & indearments, which this sportful woman d
th not use to make herself grateful and charming to her new Gallant, and to kindle fresh desires in him, so that we may conclude one of the Daughters of the beauti∣ful 
Venus,
 is now sporting with one of her beloved 
Mars
's his Sones, and that in the height of Solace; neither was the Soldier wanting for being sensible of the Magick, of her wanton en∣ticements, he is soon armed for an encounter, which being to be done in the dark, let us season∣ably avert our eyes and leave these Votaries quietly to finish their 
Cytherian
 Rites they are going about; especially since their Zeale is so Fervent, as not to scruple the Nicietie of ma∣king the dead H
sbands Coffin the Altar; whereon to kindle and exhale the Incense they have brought. Thus you see here was a

 great and suddain change in our Matron, who is no longer Mourner or Widdow.


I shall not trouble you with a large discourse of what should be the cause of this suddain and pro∣digious Metamorphosis; some attribute it to the Mu∣tability and Levity of womens nature in general, considering the softness and tenderness of their con∣stitution, is such as renders them like wax, capable of any impressions; but we have daily examples of the constancy in affection of some women; who will loose their lives in defense of their honor, so that I will not attribute this Mutability and Levity of wo∣men to be general to all women, nor that this was the only cause of our Matrons Metamorphosis, for some impute it to the force of the wine the Soldier gave her, but 
I
 suppose this can at the most be recko∣ned to be but an Accessary, and not the principal A∣gent; for the quantity she drank, though it was suffi∣cient to renew her spirits, cherish her vitals, warmeth and quicken the motion of her blood, yet was it too little to intoxicate her brain▪ and enflame her to the heighth of desires; so inconsistent and contrary to the fridgid temper and low condition it found her in, and as to the quallity, though good wine be the milk of 
Venus,
 yet doth it s
ld me work effect
ally that way, but where it meets with boyes pr
disposed to admit, and concurre with its sprightly and heightning influ∣ence, wherefore it cannot consist with reason to ag∣gravate the facility of this woman, and transferre it wholly upon the innocent means of her refreshment, and recovery: so that the Mutability and Levity of women in general, and the eff
cts of wine not being the cause; I know not what else to attribute it unto, or

 charge it upon a
 Love in general, which we know is the Author of many wonderful Advetnures, and is a kinde of Magick; against which Nature hath given us no power of resistance, and which mastereth the greatest and wisest men in the world, as may be proved by a world of examples, which I shall omit, and return to the Matron, and her beloved Souldier, who by this time had satisfied hers and his own de∣sires, and now after his pleasure in the Vault, was de∣sirous to know how his business at the Gibbet stood, which although he found standing in the place he left it, yet the body was removed, this was a sight as un∣pleasing as that of his Mistress had been pleasant; and he now becomes more despairing than she had been, and he strives more to destroy himself, than he had hefore to preserve her. Being distracted with hor∣ror at the Gibbet, he returns in a horrible posture to the Vault, and there without speaking he falls to act∣ing: one while he casteth up his eyes that flame with fury, beats his breast, tears his hair, stampeth upon the ground, and useth all the gestures of a man trans∣ported to perfect madness, which suddain and violent passion; another while he stands unmoved and silent, fixing his exe
 upon the earth, as if 
e were consulting the infernal spirits what to do with himself; he ex∣claims against heaven, despises fate to make him more miserable, reproaches Fortune for her giddiness, Cur∣ses his Malevolent Stars, renounceth Providence; sometimes he condemns his own negligence, and then he reflects upon the innocent woman, a the unhappy occasion of his wretchedness, and thinki
g he had met with the true cause of his mischeif, he interpre∣tates all the plagues in Nature upon the heads of the

 whole Sex, and vomits out these blasphemies a∣gainst them.


Ah 
Women, women
 (saith he) why did Nature make you, unless, repenting the perfection she had given to man, she found out you to lessen it? For, 
Man
 who otherwise would be more than half 
Divine;
 only by being obnoxious to the corrupt temptations of Woman, is made less than half 
Hu∣man.
 What misery ever befel him, in which Wo∣man had not a hand? What crime did He ever com∣mit; to which she did not incite him? What Tra∣gedy hath at any time been acted in the theatre of the world, in which a woman had not her part? what war, what desol
tion, what ruin hath not found its beginning in that mischeivous s
x? How many mighty Nations, flourishing K ngdomes, prospe∣rous Common-wealths, populous Cities, and noble Families, have owed their destruction, to either the Malice or Pride, or Lust of Woman? What are you Women, but the poyson of Mans Innocence and Peace, which Nature hath guilded-over with a splended out-side, that we might swallow it down with the less suspition? all your beauties, all your ch
rms are but like the Apples of 
Sodom,
 which have fair and inviting rinds, and yet within are no∣thing but stinking d
; you are the true 
Sirens,
 that enchant us with the melody of your voice, and then hold us captives in the chains of beastial slavery. You are the true 
Hiena's,
 that assure us with the fairness of your skins; and when folly hath brought us within your reach, you leap upon us, and devour us. You are the traiters to Wisdom; the impediments to industry; the obstacles to honour; the softners of

I
 set my foot in∣to this unlucky, this fatal place.


Having thus belched out this virulent invective a∣gainst poor innocent women (who deserved much better language at his hands) his wild imagination, (which catcheth at any thing) wheels about, and he thus vomits the remainder of his choler upon him∣self.


What damned spirit was it that conducted me into this Charnel-house, & made me quit my duty? where was the care & vigilancy of my good Angel, when he left me to be seduced into this dismal vault? would

 had fallen into a den of Lions & Tygres, when I light∣ed upon this woman here: then had dyed innocent, & without dishonour; whereas now I have contracted a guilt, whose punishment is an infamous death, and that inevitable, unless I prevent the stroke of justice, and become my own Executioner. Which being the only refuge my disaster hath left me, why am I thus slow in addressing my self unto it? why do 
I
 waste that time in weak and fruitless complaints, which I ought to imploy in delivering my self from the ex∣tremity of misfortunes, that is yet to come? dye I must, by sentence of the magistrate; why then should I defer to fall by my own hand? to vindicate ones self from extream, and otherwise inevitable Calami∣ty, by 
Sui-cide
 is not certainly) a crime: but an act of Heroique Fortitude.




I
 am resolved therefore, my sword shall prevent the ignominy of the Gallows, and by forcing open the Gates of death, I will stop up the way to pub∣lick shame.


Here, he puts a period to his desperate Harangue, and hasting to put one to his life also, he suddainly draws his sword; and beginning to set the hilt of it upon the ground, that he may cast himself upon the point, he is most seasonably prevented by the 
pious Matron.
 Who being all this while ignorant of the cause of his fury, hath been wholly possessed with a∣mazement at the extravagant effects of it; so that she minded not a word of all those bit
er reproaches he had cast forth against her whole Sex: but quickly roused out of the stupifying fit of wonder, where∣with she had been invaded, by seeing him draw his sword; she throws herself into his armes; & partly by grasping his hands, p
tly by the charms of her kisses tears, and entrea
ies, she so far becalm's his rage, as that he seems not unwilling to p
rouge at least the execution of that self-assasination, he intended, until he had convinced her of the necessity of it.


He tells her therefore in short, that the body of a certain notorious villain, which he had been appoint∣ed to guard, was taken from the G
bbet, and con∣veyed away; that the penalty of the like death 'denounced by the Governour against him and his fellows (who had transferred the whole charge upon his care and vigilancy) was certain and inevitable, unless he hilled himself, by way of pre∣vention; that if she could have any sentiments of kindness for so unfortunate a wretch, as this sad acci∣dent had made him, there was now no way left for

 her, to express them, but by permitting him q
ietly to pervert the infamy of a publick execution, by a private with-drawing himself into the other world; and that it was some content to him, in this his A∣gony, that he should leave his body to be dissolved into the same dust with that of her former Lover, of whose singular worth fame hath defused so honour∣able a report.


And having thus hastily delivered to her the cause of his desperate resolution, he begins again to free his hands of the incumbrance of hers, that he may speedily effect it.


But good and tender hearted 
Creature!
 her af∣fection was too great, to suffer her to yeild to any thing conducing to his death; and the more he strives to dis-engage her breast from his, the closer she clings to him; vowing withal, 
tha
 if he wounded himself, it should b
 by forcing the sword first through her body, to which she added, that she would not live to be so miserable, as to loose so dear a person so soon and in the same place, where she had been so happy to finde him unexpectedly; that very gratitude forb
de her to consent to the ta∣ing away his life, who had lately and miraculously preserved hers, and as (she had some reason to be∣lieve) infused a new life into her;
 that it would be less affliction to her, to die before him, than to sur∣vive and behold at once the dead bodies of two per∣sons, each of which she had loved infinitely above her owne life; and that the death he so much dreaded from the Hangman, was not so unavoidable, as his fears had made him imagine, but there were other wayes of evasion, besides self murder, and would he

 but follow her advice, she doubted not to put him up∣on such a course as should procure both his owne se∣curity and her content. The Soldier more effectually w
ought upon by this last clause, than by all else she had said; and remembring the old saying, that 
Women are alwayes more subtle and ingenious at Eva∣sions, in suddain Exigences than Men:
 he easily pro∣mise h (as who would not in his case?) to listen to her C
unsel, and pursue it also, if it appeared reaso∣nable.


Well then, saith this 
Good woman;
 since the bo∣dy of the best and greatest of Mortals, is but a lump of clay, after the departure of the Soul, which gave it life sense, and motion; that all Relations are extinguished in death, all Piety is determined in the grav
: & that it is but Charity to use the Re∣liques of the Dead, in case of necessity, to preserve the Living: why should not I dispense with the for∣mality of post hume-respects to the putrifying Corps of my deceased Hu
band, and make use of it for the preservation of my living friend, with whose life my own is insep
rably bound up, and whose danger therefore is equally mine? come therefore my Dear and let us take my Husbands body out of his Coffin and place it upon the Gibbet, in the room of the Malefactors, which you say hath been stolen away. Death (you know) doth so change and disfigure the Countenance, as to disguise it from the knowledg of even the most familiar ac∣quaintance. Who then can distinguish his naked body from the other? besides, we will besmear his face with blood and dirt, and rather than fail in any part of resemblance, break his arms and legs, and

 make the same wounds in him, the Executioner did in the Rogue's: so that his nearest Relations shall not be able to find a difference, much less shall strangers, who come to gaz-upon such horrid specta∣cles, out of a 
avage Curt
sity, and commonly stand a loof off.


The Souldier quickly approves the woman's project how to excuse him; and having no time (for, now day was approaching) to insist upon acknowledg∣ment either of her great love, or of the felicity of her wit: he joyns his strength with hers, and removes the Husband's Corps out of the vault to the Gibbet, whereon he placeth it, in the same posture he had left the villains, omitting no part of those resemb∣lances she had suggested, as requisite to delude the spectators. Which cone, He and his incomparable Mistriss secretly retire to consu
t further not only of their present safety, but also how they might conti∣nue that mutual hapine
s which Fortune had so un∣expectly begun betwixt them. And thus did they put an end to this nights Adventures, which had been admirable to them both; and we may from hence learn the instability of all sublunary things, but more particularly the Mutability and Levity of wo∣men, so that there is no great heed to be taken of them; especially when they are in their passions, as I may conclude the Empress is now possest of, which rageth so extreemly that nothing but the death of your Son, the Prince 
Erastus
 will quallisy; whether her passion be Love or Hate I know not, but believe in the conclusion you will finde that it is both, and that Hate at present is the product of former Love, but let it be which, or how it will, I am sure it is not

 commendable in her to let it proceed so far as to take away the life and honor of a Prince so vertuous as is Prince 
Erastus,
 and who I hope if you please to spare from executing at present, will very suddainly make it appear to you and all the world, that he is not in the least guilty of the crimes whereof he hath been accused.


I have already told you, that some others say this was the story or example which 
Lencus
 the Philoso∣pher did write in a Letter, and send to the Empe∣rour, but some agen say that it was the former of the Physitian of 
Millain,
 they are both to one pur∣pose and efect, to shew the weakness, instabillity and passions of women, and may be, and are well applyed to the Emperour in this occasion about his Son 
Erastus;
 for the satisfaction of the Reader, & that nothing may be wanting to make this book as com∣pleat as possibly as I can, I have given the Reader an account of them both, he may give credit to which he pleaseth, and therefore I shall thus proceed.


After the Philosopher 
Lencus
 had sealed and sub∣scribed this Letter, he delivered it to one of the Sol∣diers that was set to gard him, charging him above all things to deliver it that morning early to the Em∣perour, and to tell him that it was an advertisement of very great importance. This the Soldier promi∣sed faithfully to do, and thereupon he went directly to the Castle to execute his charge; the Emperour seeing the day break and that the Sun did already gild the tops of the mountains, that he might be di∣stant from a spectacle so miserable, as that of the death of his Son, and of seven Persons esteemed and reputed to be the wisest of that Age, he therefore

 purposed to ride out into the fields, to divert his me∣lancholly as well as he could, and as he was about to mount on horseback the Soldier which the Philoso∣pher had sent, making his reverence, delivered the Letter to him. He instantly opening it read it, but not without great alteration, which was taken notice of by those that were about him, seeing that he often changed colour, from thence beleiving that it was something concerning the Prince 
Erastus.
 The Em∣perour having then read this Letter, remained for some time very pensive, without speaking one word, yet withal concluding that he could do no less than to communicate this advertisement to the counsel, he returned in some p
ssion to the Castle. The Senate being assembled he declared that as he could do no less than punish by the way of justice the detestable fellony which his own Son had c
mmitted against him; and the treason of those who having the charge to instruct him as well in good manners as in learn∣ing; instead of rend
ing him eloquent, and of good speech, they had brought him dumb and distracted; and instead of instruct
ng him in good manners, they had instructed him in the wickedness that was in question, and yet these Philosophers had presumed to justifie him in an act so wicked and so apparent; however he would not proceed of himself, but had caused this counsel to be assembled, to make them ac∣quainted with the sentence which he had given on this occasion, so that he did believe there was no reason to revoke it; nor no occasion for further proof, the matter of fact being so cleer and manifest unto all; yet nevertheless to let all the world know, that he would not, nor did not intend to stop the

 mouths of any Criminals from justifying themselves (al
hough in this case he could not see any way of justification) he was content to wash his hands of this business, & to remit the whole cause to the considera∣tion of the Senate, with this 
proviso,
 nevertheless that 
Erastus
 and the Philosophers should only have two dayes time to say and alledge before the Senate, all that they could think off, or speak for their justi∣fication and defence; and that if in the same two dayes it did not appear to the Senate by evident proofs, and manifest arguments that 
Erastus
 was innocent of that whereof he was accused to have acted against his honour, that then without delay He and his Masters should be all publickly executed by the hand of justice the morning of the third day follow∣ing; and having finished his discourse, he command∣ed that his Son & the Philosophers should be brought before the Senate fettered, and with a strong guard. Prince 
Erastus
 hearing the door of his Dungeon opened, supposed they came to fetch him to executi∣on: but when he perceived that they led him before the Senate he took heart, and more especially when he saw his Masters there, in whose wisdome he had so much assurance that he hoped to escape that day which being 
ce pass d, he feared nothing.


Now it 
as that he was in most care and fear to to keep silence, aswel in consideration of the many questions that were asked him, as also in regard of the op
nion that had poss
ssed many of the Senators that he w
s gu
lty of the fact wherewith he was charged; not using any manner of justification in a matter that concerned his life; and therefore the most part of the Senators, seeing him thus dumbe

 held him guilty of the fact, but on the other side, the Philosophers did so readily defend the cause of 
E∣rastus
 and their own, and alledged so many examples to the Senate, that they were divided in their Opi∣nions, and all that day was spent without taking any resolution to the great satisfaction and content of Prince 
Erastus;
 and by order of the Senate the Pri∣soners were sent back to Prison, and kept assunder with express intimation, that if on the next day they made not better proof of their innocence than hitherto they had done, they should proceed against them in real execution of that sentence which the Emperour had pronounced against them.








CHAP. XXI.
 The Empress 
Aphrodicia
 found means to induce the Emperour to command that execution should be done immediately upon 
Erastus,
 and the seven Philoso∣phers, by a discourse which she made of one 
Phile∣mon,
 that being adopted by a french Gentleman named 
Archelaus,
 contrived how to kill his Mo∣ther in law, conceiveing a hatred against her. And being desirous to be Lord and Master of all; by the assistance of seven of his Complices, he caused his father in law to be secretly murthered.


THE Empress 
 
Aphrodicia
 impatiently expected the 
ew
 so much desi
ed by her; which was that the sentence which the Emperour had in great anger pronou
ced against the Prince 
Eraslus,
 and 
gainst the seven Philosophers, should be really ex∣ecuted, which had been so many times delayed. But now she thought herself assured that none could hinder her designs; for that by the Im∣pri
onment of the Philosophers, she had stopped all wayes of inducing the Emperour to have a knowledg of his error, and thereupon to spare his Sons life. The consideration hereof did very much please her, to see her design take the effect she

 had desired, but on a suddain there arrived to her one of her Spies (whom she had sent to acquaint her with the certainty of all that should happen) who related to her how Prince 
Erastus
 had been brought before the Senate, guarded and settered, and with him the seven Philosophers, in regard the Emperour had remitted the tryal of the cause to the Senate, with this 
proviso,
 that if within two dayes the fact of 
Erastus
 was not so cleerly justi∣fyed that every one might plainly find him to be innocent of what he was accused, the sentence pro∣nounced against him by the Emperour, should be then immediately and without further delay executed so that 
Erastus
 should dye by the hands of justice and with him the seven Philosophers: further ad∣ding that she might reckon the business done, in regard of the shortness of the time which had been given the Prince for his justifycation, in which it would be improbable for him to cleer himself, from so manifest a guilt as he had committed in any time, and much less in so short a terme as two dayes, whereof the first was already expired, so that it was impossible for Prince 
Erastus
 to avoid the sentence: and therefore the news which he brought were little different from what the Empress so much desired, which wa
 the real execution of 
Erastus,
 which in short time would be accomplished.


The Empress hearing this n
wes was so troubled, that if her Damsels had not taken gre
t care of her, she had fallen down in a swound, but th
y seeing her faint away, laid her on the bed, w
ere having remain'd some time in a trance, and being again come to her self, she retired into her Cabinet, where after

 after she had groaned and cryed, she tore her cloathes, and beating her self, cursed her foolish mad love which had induced her to enterprize so rash an action, and in conclusion seeing that tears and and complaints availed little in her designs, and con∣sidering that if the Philosophers, and Prince 
Erastus
 had so long time of respite, the truth of the matter might come to light; she therefore purposed upon new matter, to take new counsel, wherefore recol∣l
cting her spirits the best that she could, she sent for her Father and Mother and all her Relations, who were many, and all g
at Lords, she bring descended from the most illustrious and principal Family in 
Rome;
 they being all come t
 her, did every one per∣swade her to condiscend to the Emperours pleasure, and attend till the terme of two dayes ordered for the Prisoners to justify themselves should be expi∣red; telling her that they could no more cleer them∣selves the s
cond time, than they had done the first, and that the more 
he cause was examin
d, so much more would ner vertue and contin
nce be manifested, and that would fu
 her 
 
he world against the wicked 
Erastus,
 and ag
inst tho
e who had under∣taken to defend his wickedness. But the Empress would not hearken t
 this counsel, but answered her Relations in gen r
l, that if they had any resp
ct for her honor, they would not thus sl
ght her; and there∣up
n she sent to the Emperour to desire him to come to her chamber for she had matter of great import∣ance to relate t
 him in 
he p
sence of her Father and Mother and 
hers her Relations. The Emperoor un∣derst
nding hereof, went to the chamber of the Em∣p
es, wh
 imm
diately 
egan to complain of the lit∣
 este
m the Emperour had for her, in that she had

 suffered the greatest outrage in the world from 
E∣rastus,
 which he himself and others had seen, having been publickly surpriz
d in his flight, and having pro∣mised to inflict such pu
ishment as the enormity of the case required; instead thereof he had admitted of justifications and against all reason had called her ho∣nor and fidelity in question, remitted the matter to the judgement of the Senate; where without publick bla∣ming and calumniating of her, it would be imp
ssible to defend the care of Prince 
Erastu
:
 yet for her own part she did not much care bein
 ass
red in her con∣science that nothing could be proved against her. But she was most concerned in the honor of the family from whence she was descended, that injury would be done thereto in having a bad opinion of a woman de∣scended there-from, and that any dishonest actions should be mentioned of her, as there needs must be, in that case, her honor being remitted to an ordinary Process as the Emperour had determined, and being resolved to maintain the honor of her house which she esteem'd above her li e, she was constrain'd to acquaint her father and mother, and other relations with the cause of her grief, to the end that they on their parts might advise how to maintain their honor, in reveng∣ing the wrong that had been done to her, by the best means that they could advise, since that the Emperor had given liberty of speaking to her prejudice; and as for her part she had rather live as a private woman in honor, than to be Empress of 
Rome,
 & to command all the world & be tainted with disgrace; as for the ho∣nor of an Empress, she had it not only as being wife to the Emperor, but being descended from the race of Emperors, more mighty than the E. 
Dioclesian
 was &

 that she nor none of her relations had procured the marriage between them, but that he himself had en∣deavoured it, and took all p
ssible pains to procure her to be his wife, and therefore he ought better to esteem of her; and if it were a trouble to him to put his Son to death, and that he was desirous to have him live (which would be great injustice) he might par∣don him out of his absolute power, whereby it is Lawful for an Emperour to pardon the greatest Criminals, without perswading and imprinting this opinion in his mind, that the wicked and Traytorous 
Erastus
 was Innocent; of a crime so enormous and manifest as that which he had committed, and to give credit to the fantastical inventions of those Rascally Philosophers who defended him, which means will serve for no other purpose, bu
 to open away for the 
Roman
 youths, t
 under
ake all sorts of wicked and infamou
 actions; in hopes to prove by the eloquence and well speaking of Orators and Advocates, where∣of 
Rome
 is well stored; that white is black, and that Vice is vertue, and that instead of punishment and shame, they des
rve praise and recomp
nce: Of which matter she thought good to advertise him, considering the b
d cou
sel which he followed, which proceeded from those that g
ve it, who did not acquaint him with the truth of m
tters, as indeed they were; where∣as she on her part had never hidden the truth, and had never endeavoured to hide it from him since she had lived with him. And 
lthough his disdain of her or his passion, which choaked his understanding, had caused him to do those things which he ought not, and to abhor and disdain, th
se who advertised him of his honour and quiet, yet however she would not

 be wanting to let him kn
w those things which should be for his Comodity, although by experience she knew that he had not so much regard 
f her speeches, as the importance of the cas
 requi
ed, nor the sinceri∣ty wherewith she proceeded in her advertisements; because she knew not how to disguise things as those Traytorous Philosophers did, who ordinarily hid the truth of things; although she were now despised and disdained of t
e Emperour, who at first had so great a respect for her: and to conclude and put an end to her complaints, she said thus, Sir, 
I
 much doubt that it will happen to you as it did to a 
French
 Gentleman, whose Story was told me when I was young, which is so proper to your purpose, that if you do not pro∣vide while you have the power in your hands, I fear and that to my great trouble, that it will happen to you as it did to this Gentleman; wherein I shall n
ver∣theless have a cleer conscience, in regard I have not only advertised you whom it principally conc
r
, but also my Relations who are here present, who also have great interest therein. And although it may hap∣pen that there are s me h
re present, who have heard this Story of the 
French
 Gentl
man, yet however I shall relate it, as being n
t improper to alledge known examples, especially when they may serve to the mat∣ter whereof we treat.


In 
France,
 there was some time since a Gentleman named 
Archelaus;
 esteemed to be one of the richest and greatest Lords of all the C
ntry, he being Lord of much Lands; and having in his power diverse fair and strong places, and especially o
e which was so pleasantly Scituated, and so strongly bu
l
 
h
t he had the command of all the adj
yning Countrey.

 This Gentleman took to wife a Damsel his neighbour, whom he kept long without having any Children; yet he lived with her in the greatest love and friend∣ship that could be immagined to be, between man and wife, yet in the end seeing that his wife was barren and being out of hopes of having any Children, he purposed to adopt some Child to bear his name and Armes, and to succeed in those Lands and Lordships which he held; since the bounty of heaven did not ex∣tend so far, as to give him natural and Law
l issue, so that having conferred with his wife about this design who on her part was also very well contented; he a dopted and took for his Son a young Child named 
Philemon,
 who was one of his nearest relations, whom h
 ca
sed to be bred and instruct
d as belonged to the Son of a great Lord, and as if he had been his own Child. The child had so good natural parts that he learned all that was taught him; so that his adopted F
ther was very well pleas
d, and so was the Mother and all the family and in regard of the great hopes which all the Subj ct did c
nceave of the good breed∣ing of the young Gentleman; there was none of them which did not love him and who did not honour him being assured that for a long time there had not been any more wise and prudent than their young Lord was likely to be. And his ad
pted Father seeing his good genius, notwith
tanding his youth did not omit to acquaint him wi h his aff
irs, and to entrust him with 
me charge and mannagment, wherein he ac∣quitted himself with great d
xterity. It happened that this 
Philemon
 being dilligent in all the affairs of his a∣dopted F
her his ad
pted Mother fell sick, and in short time died; wherefore 
Archelaus
 was extreamly

 sorry, so that the better to pass away his melancholly and grief, he retired to a Country house, there to live solitary and pass away his time in reading and studdy, in the mean time leaving the mannagement of all his great affairs to the young 
Philemon
 who also appeared to be much grieved for the death of his Adopted mother at the first appearance shewing that it was impossible for him to live in the absence of his adopt
d father, and that whether-tsoever he went he would follow him, to do him all service as in duty bound. But this adopted father would not permit him; C
mmandi
g him not to stir and that above all thing he should adimnister good justice to his Subj
ct. This 
Philemon
 performed; that he might not appear disob
diant, 
o that his chief design was 
o govern well, the Subj
cts of his Father Nay, he demeaned himself, so vertuo
sly in the Go∣vernment of his Subj
ct
, that they were very well contented; and thus he continued for some time. But in short time, whither it was that his wickedness be∣ing hidden was so great that it could be no longer dissembled, or whither it proceeded from the Im∣peruosity of youth, which cau
ed him t
 make a bad use of his freedome, and power, he began to loosen the Reins to his f
lly as it is usual for young men who know themselves to be free and out danger of punishment. True it is that being very wary, he so ordered his affairs that no com∣plaint came to the eares of his adopted Father; who having past away his time of mourning, and being weary of a Solitary life, he purposed to return to his house where he was highly welcomed by his Sub∣jects but chiefly young 
Philemon
 appeared to be the most contented person in the world and gave so good

 an account to 
Archelaus,
 of all matter
 of impor∣t
nce that had p
ss
 in his absence; and thereby cau∣sed him to und
rstand hi
 g
 spirit, that his Fa∣ther al
h
ugh present remitt
d all aff
irs to his man∣nagement, who acted all his busine s being held in his fathers pres
n
s, in greater reput
tion and a more abs
lute Lord than in his f
thers abs
nce; in which mannagement he continued a cer
ain time, with a very great in
de
y in appearance, y
 in private abandon∣ing hims
lf to the sa
ct
on of his disordinate appe∣tite.


Archelaus
 then seeing young 
Philemon
 to be grown to mans 
state, purposed to seek 
ut a wife for him which 
Philemon
 under
ta
ding, and fearing to be tyed to a wife by the bands of 
ri
age when he could not so freely enjoy 
is accustom
d pleasures as he had done, being to give an account in the night, whereas now he 
cted what he luted, and let loose the Reins to his v
l
pte usness of which liberty he should be deprived wh
n 
e w
s 
ur ed, he therefore went to his Father, 
 him to let him continue in the condition h
 w
, in 
 brid
ing him by mar∣riage, alledg ng that a Wife would disturb him fr
m his study, and the 
gement of his affairs, & 
old him several other rea
on
 
 
olour of ze
l which he had for 
 good of hi
 Subjects, so well using his tongue, that 
Archilaus
 (who yet above all things desired t
 see of the race of his beloved 
Phile∣mon
) having fir
t us
d all p
ssib e perswasions, was in the end constrained to comply with him, as well in respect of the z
al which 
Philemon
 shewed to his business, as not to contradict him in that where he excused himself with some appearance of reason, so that he intended not to urge it any further yet how∣ever

 purposing to cause him to condescend in time by other mean
.


Whereupon having considered the manner how he discovered his intent to his favourites, telling them that since his Son would not consent to be married, than he himself should be constrained to take a wife, whereby so noble a family as his might not be lost; having none to bear his Name and Arms but the young 
Philemon,
 and this he gave out, not out of a∣ny thoughts of being married, but to invite 
Phile∣mon
 to take a wife; certainly believing that when 
Philemon
 should hear this news, if nothing else should move him to be married; yet at last the fear of being deprived of so great a succession, as that of 
Archelaus
 by the Children which he might have of a wife, if he should take one, would induce him to consent to the will of his Father. But all this did not divert 
Phile∣mon
 from his oppinion knowing on the one side that 
Archelaus
 was already out of hopes of having Chil∣dren, and on the other side, if he should have any he could not live to see them great by the course of na∣ture, so that by necessity he should always have the government of those Children, and of the Lands and Lordships of 
Archelaus,
 remaining by this means as absolute Lord of the said Lands, as if 
Archelaus
 had no Children. In conclusion 
Archelaus
 seeing that young 
Philemon
 regarded not the same that was spread abroad, thought that by the greatness and vi∣vacity of his spirit he had disovered his intention; and therefore to make the matter seem more probable and real he began to seek out for a marriage for himself, enquiring among all the Damsels that were marriage∣able,

 to find one prop
r and convenient for him, not that he intended to be ma
r ed, but to induce 
Philemon
 thereunto, seeing tha
 there was no diss
mbling in the Case, and that he might think his father would in good esrnest marry, as it was the general discourse of all people. But for all this 
Philemon
 still continued absolute ag
nst marriage, so that what was first in∣tended for jest proved in earnest, for a Damsel was found out for 
Archelaus
 her name was 
Eufrosena
 she was fair vertuous, of a C
p
ten
 age, and of as good a family as he desired.


Archelaus
 seeing this, and that this Damsel came freely to him, and that 
Philemon
 w
uld not marry; he therfore purposed to p
ceed in this marriage. This was approved of by all, and o
 
Philemon
 himself without whose advice he would not conclude thereon And so this Wedding was solemnized, with all fit magnificence to the great content of every one.


Archelaus
 being very well pleased with his marri∣age, having d
ly experience of the mild Spirit, great prudence and vertue of his wife, began to introduce her into the Rule and Government of all his Lands and houses; y
t with
ut taking the mannagement of his affairs from 
Philemon,
 but with this charge that in all eases of importance, and which required coun∣sel, he should act nothing without Communicating thereof to his Mother-in-law. This woman behaved her self so vertuously in her mannagement, that in short time by degrees all affairs passed through her hands; for on the one side 
Archelaus
 being striken in years, would not trouble himself with business having more need of rest, and on the other side 
Philemon
 minded nothing but his pastime, and to enjoy all the

 pleasure that came into his fantasie sometimes to the prejudice of others, remitting all dispatches to his Mother in Law, who did expedite all the most dextruously that might be, and with great equity. The subjects seeing their Lady behave her self so virtuously in the Government of the Country, took heart to complain to her of the great disorders and violence which 
Philemon
 committed; so that from all parts complaints came to her ears; yet she being mild and good natured endeavoured at first to ex∣case and cover the faults of 
Philemon;
 and then in private to c
de him, admon
shing, exhorting and praying him so to de
an himself, that he should use no violence towards the Subjects, and to mind his business as formerly he had done, shewing himself worthy of that quality whereto he had been called by the bounty of Fo
tune; and by the love which 
Archelaus
 had born him, hereupon young 
Philemon
 very humbly thanked her, with a pro∣mise from thence forwards to follow the good ad∣vertisements, which by her b u
ty she had given him; yet nevertheless he acted quite contrary, not omitting to do any thing that his wicked inclina∣tions led him to, and al
hough he endeavoured to act his lew'd tricks at privately as he could, that his Mother in law might not discover him; yet now it was not so as it had formerly been with his Fa∣ther, for he was acquainted with all his actions, because the Subjects went more freely to make their complaints to 
Eufrosena,
 than to 
Archelaus,
 seeing the ready and quick dispatches which she gave to all affairs; and now they did not fear that she should be transported with natural affecti∣on

 at the discovery of the dis
rdinate life of 
Philemon,
 as it may be 
Archelaus
 himself would have been, who being neer of Kin to 
Philemon,
 had taken so great a love for him; that he had adopted him when a young child, and had alwayes bred and entertained him as his own Son.


The wise 
Eufrosena
 seeing the advertisements which she had given to 
Philemon,
 had not at all p
fited him she began to be more free with him; threatning that in case he did not change his manners, to acquaint her husband therewith that he might take course with him: yet withal mildly telling him the great blame he would have when his lewd life should be discover∣ed. Whereupon 
Philemon
 promised that for the fu∣ture he would so behave himself that she should hear no Complaints of him; an
 
t
e was every day worse and worse, so that the ve
uous 
Eafrosena
 was constrained to acquaint her hu
b
 th
ewith, earnestly entreating him, to advise hi
 S
n to leave those wicked courses, and to bring him back to his former v
rtuou
 manner of living. 
Archelaus
 hear∣ing this new
 of his Son thought 
 very 
range to hear of 
uch dishonest 
ct
s, so c
ntrary to the good opinion which he had of his C
ntin
c
 and vertue; wherefore 
e c
id him 
ve
ely and threatn∣ed him highly, st
ly c
mm
nding him from thence forwards, not t
 c
mmit any ex
s or violence; In∣timating to h
 that for the first 
ault he should be guilty of, he wo
ld so Chastise him, that his former c
lmes and th
se which he should commit, should not escape unpunished, and that he should 
erve as an example to others, who seeing that he had not spared his adopted Son, should forbear offending for fear of

 punishment. Young 
Philemon
 counterfeiting a Re∣pentance, and that he was very sorrowful, that he had committed crimes to the displeasure of his Father, begged his pardon promising to live so strictly from thence forward
, that he should never hear any just complaint against him.


Yet it was not long after this that he had a mind to a fair young Damsel, daughter to a Gentleman of the most considerable quality of his fathers Subjects▪ and not knowing how by fair means to get poss
ssion of her, 
e one day made a forceible entry into the house of this Gentlem
n, and carryed away the Dam∣sel. This rude action coming to the knowledge of 
Archelaus,
 he Commanded that 
Philemon
 should be suddenly seiz
d on, and being strictly guarded should be carried Prisoner to a strong Castle, giving express commands to the Captain of the Castle, that upon pain of his high displeasure, he should put 
Philemon
 in the stronge; Prison of the Castle, that he might at all times render a good account of him.


Philemon
 being thus put into Prison, conceived mortal hatred against his Mother-in-law, believing all the anger of 
Archelaus
 did proceed from her, and by her Instigation; and from thencef
rth purposed to imploy all his power and wicked Spirit, to ruine the good and innocent Lady: And that he might accom∣plish his design, he endeavoured all that in him lay to get the friendship of the Captain of the Castle which he easily performed; the Capt
in being a good fellow, one who desired to please all and par∣ticularly 
Philemon,
 whom he one day hoped to see Lord of all the Lands of 
Archelaus.
 And therefore he often visited 
Philemon
 eating and

 drinking with him, endeavouring to divert him by Playing, singing, and other recreation; so that his liberty only excepted, he knew nothing that would please 
Philemon,
 but he suffered him to enjoy it. This Captain had one only Daughter competently fair and mar
iagable, which he lov
d above all things. 
Philemon
 having seen her, resolved to make use of this means, to accomplish what he most desired. He seeing his keeper to be so much his friend, that he might without any danger discover any secret to him; he one day took him apart, and having made a long preamble of the many traverses which his Mother-in-law had practised to his prejudice, and that with∣out cause, so that she had by these means brought him t
 a Prison him who was by right the true and Lawful Lord of the Countrey; there to cause him to Languish in a condition worse than death, had it not been for his kin
ness to him, for which he reckoned himself v
ry much oblig
d, so that he should never forget it, and being willing to begin to acknow∣ledge the g
eat 
iendship and service which he had received of him, and gave him assurance of what he m
ght hereafter expect; when by the death of his Father he should be Master of his 
; he therefore purposed to take his only daugh 
 to wife, 
on this condition that the said C
ptain would Aid and assist him in what he purposed to do And then he began to discourse of the probable coo
 he would take to be revenged on h
 Innocen
 
ufrosena,
 and told him particularly how the design should be man∣naged.


The affection which the Captain had to see his daughter so highly preferred and the Ambition to

 be Father-in-law to his Lord and Prince, and by consequence Governour of the Countrey, caused him to open his eares; so that although he knew this to be an unjust undertaking, yet however he resolved to be an Actor, and therefore they having plighted their trothes to each other, the marri
ge of his daughter and 
Philemon
 was secretly c
nated. The Captain of the Castle resolving to keep promise, choosed out seven S
ldiers 
Reformadoes,
 in whom he could confide, and after he had c
njured them, and received an oath from them for their fidelity and secresie, he discovered his and 
Philemons
 enterprise to facillitate which, he shewed them the proper means, giving them great presents and greater promi∣ses, to serve as false witnesses, to testifi
 and affirm that which should be requited of them. This being done he dispatched one of these 
Reformadoe
 to 
Ar∣chelaus,
 to entreat him to come to the Galile, about a business of very great Consequence, and wherein consisted the quiet of his estate which w
s of so great importance, that he durst not write least the Letter should miscarry and mu
h less could be trust a third person to acquaint him by w
rd of m
uth.


While the Soldier was on hi
 way 
o deliv
r his Message, the Traytor 
Philemon
 pur
sing to act his wickedness, cunningly laid his found
tion on a Letter which he found, wh
ch the S
ge 
Eufrosena
 had with her own hand wri
ten to the C
ptain of the Castle; whereby 
h
 g
v
 him some particul
r orders about governing the Country, which Letter he found among the Captains 
; 
nd b
ng well ac∣quainted with his Mother-in-l
w, ha
 h
 pr
ctised 
 nterfeit it & did it so artificially that it was not to

 be distinguished from her own proper writing. This Letter being perfected, he sealed it up at 
Eufrosena
 was used to do; counterfeiting a Superscription (which was addressed to the Captain of the Castle) as he had done to the Letter it self; and this he gave to the Captain, concluding with him how to use it.


But to return to 
Archelaus,
 as soon as he heard the Message from the Cap
ain of the Castle, he mounted on hors-back, and rode with a small train to the Castle; where being come the Captain retired with him into a private Chamber, entring into a large discourse of the great obligation which he had for him and his service, who from so low a degree as a private Ge
tleman and Soldier, had raised him to be a Captain of s
 remarkable a place, that indeed might be very well accounted to be the strongest of the Kingdom of 
France;
 f
r which cause and also in regard he was his naturall Leige-Lord, his duty Commanded him, to think of nothing more than the peace and conservation of his estate and person, which he 
s b
und to defend, and ma
ntain by hi
 blood 
d w
 his L
fe. And therefore he having the m
 t
 deliver h
m fr
m a very great danger, he had been so bold as to entreat h
m to come thither, to give him p
iva
e adver∣tisement of that wh
c
 was al
ady 
 forwa
d, that were it not for his great fidelity and o∣thers that belonged to him, it m ght be concluded that hi
 life was at an 
nd, so forwards was the d
ign ag
inst him; And it wo
ld be diffi∣cult to prevent it, in regard it was contrived by a per∣son

 in whom he put the greatest c
nfidence, and of whom he always had a good opinion. And to make it more plain to you said the Captain, it was your wife; whom you and I and all men else, have esteemed for the best and Loyalest Lady in the world. But I very well know that this Sex is frail and Subject to Ch
nge, which hath at all times been seen, and now more then ever, but I never heard of so wicked a design as this: F
r some days since whither it is out of hatred to you, or love to some other person, or any other occasion hath induced her (for I cann
t 
mm
gin the reason) she hath endeavoured to engage me to her by presents, and great promises being more liberall than ordinary. I was at first 
rpr
zed, yet in conclusion resolved that this was only the effects of her good nature of which she always gave sufficient proof. And therefore without immagining any evil, I endeavoured to do her all possible service and to insinuate further into her favour, acknowledging her for my Lady and Mistress, as indeed she is being your wife; and I many times told her that th
 greatest d
sire 
I
 had in this world, was effect
all
 to d
 
a
e the great aff
ction which I had for her serv
ce, accord∣ing to my duty; praying her freely to command me, and to imploy me as she should think fit as Lady and Mistress, both of my goods and life, putting all into her power, t
 disp
se of at her pleasure, holding my life and goods very well imployed, when they should be used in her service. She hearing these off r▪ wh
c
 were in general did believe she had 
 much p
wer over me, that I would performe wh
soev
r her bru
ish

 cruelty had possest her mind, which till then she had covered with a cloak of mildness and courtesie, without considering what my honor and duty ob∣lidges me to: being confident hereof, not long since she wrote this letter to me, which is of her own writing, as he that brought it told me, by which (as you may see if you please to read) she sollicites me to commit the treason therein contained, to kill you privately one day when you should come to this place, and give out a report that you dyed of age, or some accident, whereby she might have full posses∣sion of your land; in recompence whereof as you may see, she promises me the best of your houses, this only excepted at my choice, but God forbid that any such treason should enter into my breast, for proof of what I say said the Captain, behold the letter, and thereupon after a due reverence he gave it him into his hand.


Archelaus
 hearing this newes of his wife, was du∣ring the Captains discourse in great torment, con∣sidering the great experience he had of his wives vertue; he could not im
gine that she would have thought, and much less have endeavoured so treaso∣nable an action, yet understanding tha
 by the letter, he migh
 know the truth, he p
rmitt
d the Captain to finish his discourse, which being ended he took the letter, and having well v
ewed and considered it, he did certainly bel
ive it to be her own hand writeing.


And H
 having 
f
e
 read this Letter, was very m
ch 
v shed with admiration, and even as a man who d
ames of something, and not

 being able to discerne whether it be true or false so this poor Gentleman knew not what to think on the one side, knowing it to be his wives hand, and on the other side believing her to be so fa
hful▪ that he thought it unpossible any such treasonable action should enter into her heart, this perpl
xity of spirit being perceived by the Traytor who spake to him that he might the better compas
 his design, he thus continued his discourse to 
Archelaus.


Sir, I doubt that this Letter is not the true hand of my Lady, it is, it is sighing said the poor 
Archelaus,
 I know it too well suppose it to be so said the Cap∣tain, it was only to make tryal of my fidelity, for I cannot imagine for what reason she should attempt to murther one to whom she hath without the least distaste alwayes shewed all manner of dutiful love; but I have discovered something else, which cleers the truth of all, for she hath sub
rned with mony some my Soldiers, and took an oath of them that they would kill me at her arrival here, which should be soon after your death, that she might be rid of us both; and these very Soldiers have discovered this conspiracy, after I had assured them of pardon, and this they themselves will relate to you.


Having said thus, he caused the seven Complices to come into the Chamber, who when they c
me thither fell down on their knees befo
e 
Archelaus,
 begging pardon for the great fault which they had committed in harkning to so great a Treason as that wherein they had b
 engaged, 
nd for which 
hey had received reward; and 
 a par
c
l 
on how 
Eufrosena
 had hy
 
 the
 C
p∣tain, as the Captain had told 
Archelaus,
 but 
fter

 that being sensible of the greatness of the crime which they had undertaken; they resolved of two evils to choose the least, and submit to their Captain who had been graciously pleased to pardon them.


Archelaus
 comparing this relation with the con∣tents of the Letter, no longer doubted but that the case was just as the trayterous Captain had told him, yet he knew not what to resolve upon, for on the one h
nd the great treason which he believed his wife to be guilty of, drove him on to revenge; and on the other hand the love he bore to the innocent Lady, staid and hindred him. The trayterous Captain per∣ceiving this, said Sir, when a man is interested in any case, and passionate his best course is to take advise of others, and therefore I will give you my best counsel, which if you please you may follow, other∣wise you may d
cline it, and take your own course.


If it were my case, I would have you send for your wife; pretending to conferre with her about s
me case of importance, and so soon as she comes h
th
r, cause her head to be cut off, as a reward for her treason, which 
I
 think is plain enough proved un∣to you; 
Archelau,
 approving of the counsel of this tr
yterous and cursed Captain, sent to his wife that without any delay, she should come to the Castle to acquaint her with some weighty matters; the good and virtuous Lady having received her husbands l
t
er, suddainly mounted on horse-back and came thither; but she was no sooner passed the two first gates of the Castle, when she was se
zed on by the seven Soldiers, who cut of her head, not p
rmitting her to speak one w
 d; 
Archelaus
 would not be present at this miserable execution, but remitted all

 to the Captains discretion, who having performed what he had intended, and resolving to adde one treason to another returned to 
Archelaus,
 to whom he said that 
Eufrosena
 se
ing her life to be at the latest account, and that her treasons were discovered, for which she had deserved death: she therefore charged him to tell her Husband that she prayed him to pardon those crimes she would have committed, therefore confessing her self worthy of a more cru∣el death than she was to suffer; also acknowledging that she knew not wherefore such a Treason had en∣tred into her mind, but that God by his just judge∣ment had bereaved her of her sense and understand∣ing, for the great wrong; which she had done to the innocent 
Philemon,
 having so calumniated and accu∣sed him, having hyred a Gentleman who complained against him, pretending that he had forced his daugh∣ter, which was a thing counterfeited, that she might remove her Son in Law from the management of affairs, and be her self the sole Governness.


This the poor old man easily believed, so that he caused the traiterous 
Philemon
 to be immediately taken out of Prison, making excuses to him, for the hard usage which he had receaved, and he instantly out him into the same capacity he had bin in: giving him greater authority than before; so that all dis∣patches depended absolutely upon him and passed through his hands.


Philemon
 then seeing himself in the condition he de∣sired, for some time managed the affairs with such dexterity that he in short time obtained the good will of the People; yet considering that 
Archelaus
 was not so old but that he might be married again, and

 that then there would be an alteration in his condi∣tion, he purposed to assure himself and be peaceable; Lord of all the Lands of 
Archelaus,
 whilest it was in his power, and not to delay his design, lest some new trouble should arise; wherefore being experi∣enced in the dexterity of his Father in law, in wick∣ed actions he declared his intention to him, desireing his assistance. This Traytor had often thought of this matter as well as 
Philemon,
 and was so ambitious of seeing himself great, that every day seemed a year to him▪ till his Son in law should be absolute Lord and Master of th
se Lands; and therefore he told 
Philemon
 that he should leave the management of that affair to him, for at 
Archelaus
 his next coming to the Castle, such order should be taken, that for the future he should not be hindred of being abso∣lute Lord; and having conferred his intention with those Soldiers that had murthered 
Eufrosena,
 that the next day he should leave the Castle, and go 
 dayes journey from thence to mannage his aff
irs, that his abse
ce should not cause him to be in the least suspected, and that he should be r
ady to re∣turn thither as to the chief place of residence, and to s
ize on all his other houses before any trouble should happen.


Philemon
 takeing his Father in laws advice, de∣parted f
om the Castle, and not long after 
Ar∣chelaus
 came thither, who one day walking with the Captain in a private place of the Castle, two of those murderours Soldiers threw a girdle about his neck, and there immediately strangled him.




The poor 
Archelaus
 being dead, the rascal Captain made an out-cry, so that all the Soldi∣ers did run to see what was the matter▪ and he holding the dead body in his arms, with feigned tears told them, that while he was talking a 
Ga∣tarhe
 had seised on him, so that he f
ll down dead in the place: and then he caused him to be laid in his bed, applying perfumes and other re∣medies to see if he would come to himself, but all was to no purpose, which he seeing without any delay sent in Post to 
Philemon,
 and after he had counterfeited lamentations for the death of his Lord, he caused him to be interred in the most sumptuous manner that he could.


Philemon
 understanding of the death of 
Ar∣chelaus
 was very well pleased, but in appearance shewed much discontent and sorrow, but soon re∣turned to the Castle, where with tears he was received of the Captain, and all others of the Town for their lawful Lord; and having taken order for mourning, he took poss
ssion of the Lordships thus wickedly usurped before the time, beginning at the cheif City, and from thence go∣ing from place to place without any contradicti∣on.


The time of mourning being over, 
Philemon
 was solemnly married to the Captains daughter, and he gave large rewards to the Soldiers who had served him in his designs, but in conclusion he caused them all to be privately murthered.


He himself did not long enjoy his estate, for the justice of Heaven which leaves no evil

 action unpunished, raised an English Lord against him to be his Enemy; who having intelligence with cer∣tain o
er French Lords, who although they were 
Philemons
 Neighbours, yet they hated him for his tyranny) necessitated him to retire to an inconsider∣able Cittie, where being taken by the 
English,
 he was burnt alive, and as they led him to execution, he confessed that he had deserved not only to be burnt, but a far w
rse punishment, not for the wrong which he had done to the 
English,
 but for the great treason which he had committed against 
Archelaus,
 and the innocent 
Eufrosena;
 declaring particularly how all things had been contrived and executed, and then being fastned to the stake, he there finished his wicked life,


This history my Lord, said the Empress, I had a minde to relate to you, to see if it might be possi∣ble to open your eyes that you may see that this your Son endeavors nothing else, with his seven trayterous Complices (and not Philosophers) to dispatch me out of this world, being assured that if I were removed: I who am your loyal wife and com∣panion, they would more easily attain their ends; which is to make themselves peaceable Lords of the Empire, without waiting for the nat
ral course of your life, ag
inst which they have had many designs, and it would not be long ere they were effected, if 
I
 were once taken away from you, and this all persons of j
dgment may easily perceive; and although Heaven in the end will not leave this unpunished, but 
et we must first suffer a miserable death, if ac∣cording to your duty, you do not make timely provision against it, and my Parents and Relations

 here present ought to give their ready assistance.


These speeches of the Empress were uttered with so much livelyness and earnestness, that not only the Emperor, but her Relations resolved that 
Erastus
 should dye without delay, so that if it had been day time, as indeed it was not, part of the night being passed away and spent, the Emperour would have caused the innocent 
Erastus,
 and the seven Philoso∣phers to be dispatched; and therefore he gave abso∣lute command, that without attending any other or∣der of the Senate, the next morning without any delay, Prince 
Erastus
 should be publickly executed by the common Executioner, and after him the seven Phi∣losophers; after he had given this order, he endeavo∣red to appease the Empress, and for her better sa∣tisfaction he committed the execution of the sentence to four Persons, who were her particular favorites; causing his father in Law, and other Lords who were the Relations of the Empress to stay and sup with him, and he that night lay with the wicked and per∣verse 
Aphrodicia.








CHAP. XXII.
 The Emperour 
Dioclesian
 saw a Vision in his sleep, of several sorts of Animals whereby was demon∣strated all passages about Prince 
stus,
 and what part he should take, by reason of which Vision he be∣came very melancholly.


THE Emperor being in bed with the Empress was was so trouble
 in mind, that he could not pos∣sibly sleep until 
 little before break of day; and then his e
 
 
o sooner closed, but he saw in a Dream 
ss
 from his Reins a Pidgeon white as snow 
he 
 h
t
st and 
est that ever he had seen; whereupon 
e being joyful, purposed to have it well and c
efully nourish
d, it being already so fair that all the World admired it, and he himself was so much in love with it, that all his pleasure and qui
t consisted in considering 
f the whiteness and f
irness of the Bir
; which g
ow
ng larger, and daily encreasing 
n be
y, he perceived that a Ser∣p
n
 came to his P
lla
e which was so beautiful, tha
 although this An mal is naturally horrible, yet he was so in love with it, that sometimes he put it in hi bosome, and at other times lay with it; he also perceived that so soon as this Serpent saw his young

 Pidgeon to be so fair, he took great pleasure in it, and by all means 
ndeavoured to have its company. The Pidgeon at fir
 was well enough contented, and not only shewed love to, but also respected the Ser∣pent; but seeing that the Serpent kissed it, and en∣deavoured by all means to couple with it, the Pid∣geon with h
ror and anger which it had against this villanous and venemous beast began to flye; the Ser∣pent on the other side seeing it self disdained, seemed to have changed into mortal hatred, all the love which he had to this Pidgeon, endeavouring by all means to kill the poor Bird, in such manner pur∣suing it, that the Emperour himself hated it▪ out of respect to the great Serpent, so that he also assisted to kill it, and yet he thought that the poor Pidgeon made no defence, only looked to heaven, without speak∣ing, as if from thence it exp cted assistance and fa∣vour, he also saw that as the cruel Serpent was about to kill the fair Pidge
n, seven several Animals ap∣peared in order, who were all of different shapes, so that he could not distinguish what they were, yet they were so fair, that all that beheld them took plea∣sure therein; these Animals being arrived, one by one placed themselves to defend the young Pidgeon from the great Serpent, fighting for the Pidgeon one after another; so that in the beginning it seemed that the Serpent yielded, and yet afterwards he returned to assault the poor Pidgeon more fiercely than before; so that it was necessary that another of the seven A∣nimals should come to combate no defend it, and so there was seven assaults, during which the Emperor seemed to favour the Pidgeon against the Serpent, when the Serpent had the worst, and on the contrary

 when the Serpent had the better, he altered his mind, and was pleased to help to kill the Pidgeon, for love of the Serpent.


In conclusion, he perceived that the Serpent raised himself higher than before, and casting forth all its poyson with the rage and fury that possessed him, he had so disordered the seven Animals, and the Pid∣geon which all that time had made no defense, that they seemed to be at the last gaspe of their lives, and that yet nevertheless the Pidgeon appeared then with so good a grace, and so great a vertue, that without fighting he overthrew and abased the Serpent, so that it remained upon the place not daring to stir, which the cursed and perverse Beast seeing it, imployed all its rage and venome against it self, so that it killed it self; whereupon the Emperor seemed to have then as much hatred as formerly he had love for it, very much repenting that he had so persecuted so pleasant a Bird as this Pidgeon was, at the desire of so horri∣ble a beast as was the Serpent; he also thought that all the City of 
Rome
 made Bone-fires for the delive∣rance and victory of the Pidgeon, so that nothing was heard throughout the whole City, but Drums, Trumpets, and other musical Instruments.


In conclusion the great noise which the people of 
Rome
 made at these Bone-fires, seemed to be so great that it awaked the Emperor just at break of day; then when the Sun-beams chased away the obscurity of the night, and being awake, he began to consider of the great dream he had in that hours time wherein he had slept; the apprehension of which, was so im∣printed in his mind, that he thought it rather a truth than a Dream; and yet he could not comprehend

 one single point of it, although he could not remove from his fansie a thing that he had seen so perfectly, believing that it must necessarily have some great sig∣nification considering the impressi
n it had left in his mind, being thus very melancholly he arose, and soon after him the Empress; to whom a minute of an hour seemed to be a year, so desirous she was to be satisfied in the death of the innocent 
Erastus,
 and the seven Philosophers, who took part with him to maintain the just quarrel of their Disciple; and she was no sooner up, but she sent in great haste for those who had Commission to execute the sen∣tence of the Emperor against 
Erastus
 and the Phi∣losophers.








CHAP. XXIII.
 Prince 
Erastus
 declares in full Senate, the necessity which had constrained him to be silent untill then; and by an example of 
Hermogenes,
 afterwards na∣med 
Entichus,
 whose Father had caused him to be cast into the Sea, that he might not see him to be greater than himself: Ye
 however the same 
Enti∣chus
 at length obtained the Crown, of the Kingdom of 
Candia,
 although he was but the Son of an ordina∣ry Merchant, according to the fatal destinies, who had foretold that he should Arive at this dignity; shewing that there is no prudence nor humane coun∣sell, that can hinder that which once hath been de∣termined in Heaven, and by the Caelestiall Influence. And having declared the truth of the fact, as it had passed between him and the Empress; he and the Philosophers are acquitted, and the Empress is cast into Prison.


PRINCE 
Erastus
 knowing the Term was past, of 
 fatal silence which the St
s had demon∣strated to him, and enjoyned him to, under great pe∣nalties; and knowing that for the future he might employ his tongue, which in so long time and in so great dangers, wherein he had been encompassed, had neglected to perform its duty, rendering thanks with∣in

 himself to the bounty and goodness of heaven; and to the vertue of his Masters, who on so signal an 
c∣casion had found out the way to preserve his life, a∣gainst the Malignity of the Stars, seven days toge∣ther; So soon as he saw the dawning of the Eighth day, by him so much longed for, he called the Jay∣lor in whose custody he was, saying to him, my friend go from hence to the Emperour my Father, and tell him from me that his Son 
Erastus
 is no longer Dumb, and that he can now as freely speak, as formerly it was necessary for him to be silent; and intreat him in my name, that although he may have purposed to bereave me of that life which he formerly gave me: Yet nevertheless at the end of my day
 he will not deny me this favour, to give me audience in a full Senate before 
I
 dye, and assure him that I have such matters to relate, as will give him m
ch satisfaction to hear, and if after that he will put me to death I shall rest very well contented.


The Jaylor having heard the Message of Prince 
Erastus;
 went with all dilligence to the Emperours Lodgings, yet he doubted that he should be de∣rided, for delivering a Message from one that was Damb; but however he delivered what he had in charge to the Emperour, who understanding this new Embassy, remained very much perplexed and astonished, by means of what had newly hap∣pened. And although he believed that his Son had given that in charge to the Jaylor which he had delivered, yet he thought it very strange that he now speaking, he should all that time keep silent even, in those great

 dangers wherein he had been and was still envolved, So that he sometimes resolved not to make any reckoning of him, considering the small esteem 
E∣rastus
 had for him, not vouchsafeing to speak and justi∣fie himself, when he had been charged with so great a crime; for which cause he believed he had just occasi∣on to be angry with his Son, who had so little re∣spected him, as not to pay him one civil salutation as in duty he was bound to, and for that he had not answered one single question, there having been so many propounded to him, whe efore he had conclu∣ded that this his silence was sufficient proof of his guiltiness, in so abominable a case as he had been charged withall: And then again natural affection and instinct, which induces Tygers to bear affection to their young ones (although they disdaine & hate all o∣thers) induced and inclined the Emperour to give him audience; And thereupon he gave command to the Jaylor that 
Erastus,
 and the seven Philosophers should be brought bound before the Senate, being however resolved that so soon as he had finished his discourse, (which in his opinion could be nothing but to aske mercy and pardon) he should be publickly executed and with him the seven Philosophers, according to the Sentence formerly given, and the evening before con∣firmed, the news was already spread throughout all 
Rome,
 how that the Empress had the evening before obtained of the Emperour, that without any process or delay the young Prince 
Erastus
 and his seven Ma∣sters, should the next morning be publickly executed; so that before day break, the place of execution was full of Spectators to see the end and issue of this spectacle, every one believing it impossible that so

 vertuous persons as the Philosophers, should be miser∣ably and publickly executed, with the only Son and heir of a 
Roman
 Emperour, and that their wisdome and vertue which was known to all, could not save them, not that none would engage in their rescue. The people being thus gathered together, some of them perceived the Jaylor when he went to the Em∣perour, and therefore followed him (being inquisi∣tive after news) but were hindred by the Guard from entring the Pallace, only some Noble men and per∣sons of quality were admitted, and were present when the Emperour commanded the Jaylor to bring forth the Prince; these relating this news abroad to others it was matter of novelty to all, as being of so great importance that it could not be hid in obscurity, so that at length it became so publick, that not only all in the Pallace was acquainted therewith, but also the whole City of 
Rome,
 and principally the Senators who had upon this occasion been already sent for, so that throughout the whole City there was a world of people of all sorts and qualities, men and women, great & small, who being every where met together made it their whole business, all expecting the issue & conclusion of the speech that 
Erastus
 would make be∣fore the Senate, where every one strived to get a place that they might hear what would be said. Only the Empress hearing of this news, began to suspect her af∣fair, as well in respect of certain remorse of conscience which pressed her, as for the novelty of the case, so that being retired into her Chamber, she ruminated in her thoughts the event of this discourse; and she already repented of the rashness of her pursuit: and then on a sudden she would take courage by a certain presump∣tion that had possessed her, and further enflamed her

 with malice and ang
, setting good spies upon the place, to know when 
Erastus
 should be brought be∣fore the Emperour, and to give her an account of all passages that should happen. All the world being in this expectation, the young Prince 
Erastus
 arived, who went before his Masters, all th
ir hands being fettered and as strictly guarded as if they had been go∣ing to execution, as the Emperour had commanded; which 
pectacle moved 
ll to compassion. But on the contrary, the young Prince marched with so much magnaminity and confide
ce, that he appeared as if he had made a Triumphant entry, rather then to go to execution: And there did he see his Father sitting in the Senate, purposing not to be overcome by father∣ly love, although his Son should beg pardon or fav∣our but to leave him to the Justice of the Law. 
E∣rastus
 being come to a convenient place, with a voice high enough to be heard of all, began as followeth.


I deny not my Lord and Father, that the Creatures of this world every one in its kind do sometimes pro∣duce eff cts degenerating from their essence, so that there is noth
ng here below that arives to an absolute perfection; but when this mi
fort
n
 happens to man to see wicked Children issue from good Parents, who however have taken pains to have them well bred up, and instructed such as these may be reckoned not to be men but brute Beasts. And therefore so much the more should I confess my self to be such, if I should commit, or think of committing so great a crime as that wherewith I am charged, and should be more Criminall then all men, both against Nature and the breeding that I have had, being naturally issued from your Royal

 Loynes being educated and instructed with such knowledg and integrity as hith
rto hath been 
own and will for the future be acknowledged to b
 in these my seven Masters, who are here p 
ent; who for good cause you made choice of to 
 
mit the Government of my tender Age, to whom a
 to the goodness of Nature, and by their dilig 
 and in∣dustry, I am sure I am so well profited, a
 have given such an opinion of me in 
Rome,
 (for alwayes with my Age I have so pursued the steps of vertue, that I can speak it without being taxed of arrogance) that being come to the Age of discretion, it is a thing al∣most incredible to believe that 
I
 should so much for∣get my self, as to fall into a crime which should de∣fame your blood, and the reputation of our house, which by this means should be contaminated with so villanous a crime, as this whereof I am accused; I wonder how it can enter into the thoughts of any, that I should have so small respect to the honor of our house which wholly concerns me being your Son, and only successor, considering my Age, and my study of Philosophy to which I have wholly applyed my self, ever since the hour of my Nativity, 
I
 must needs be a competent Judge of good and evil, that which is pro∣fitable and hurtful, honest or dishonest; and there∣fore I have wondered hen I thought with my self how it should be possible to believe, and that so easily that 
I
 should commit an act so villanous, & how you should be possessed with a thought to condemn me to death so suddainly for the speeches of a single woman, without any proof of the fact, true I am more to blame than you, who have given sentence against me because I have not spoken one word that might

 serve for my Justification, neither at the beginning when I was accused, nor during these days wherein my Masters here present have saved my life; so that this my silence hath had the power to induce those who consider things no further than their eyes de∣monstrate to them, to believe that I had commited this Villainous act wherewith I was charged, and that be∣ing surprized in the very manner, and knowing the Crime to be so hanious that there was no expectation of pardon; I was thereupon so confounded, that I was bereaved of my speech. But my silence was occasion∣ed by a higher cause, wherewith if you had been so well acquainted as were these my Masters, you would have known that it was impossible for me to do o∣therwise, without falling into an extream evill, which I could not avoid, it having been already allotted to me, and my only remedy consisted in being silent for these seven days, I very well knowing that my life was in great danger if it were not prolonged for that time, as well by the learned discourse of my Masters, as by the necessary silence which I have used. For these vertuous persons as well as I, did foresee on that day we received your commands to come to 
Rome,
 the great danger I should be in of a shamefull death, in co∣ming hither, for they are endowed with so great knowledge, that there are very few disasters which they do not foresee, and provide a remedy if there be any; it is very true that we could not possibly find out the means which should cause this disaster al∣though we were very well assured of the great danger I should be in for seven days; to avoid which, there was no other remedy but for that time for me to keep an absolute silence. This

 we concluded to do rather than disobey your commands in not coming to 
Rome,
 doubting al∣so lest I should fall into some other inconvenience which should procure pour displeasure, and render me infamous to all posterity; and therefore hazarding all that might befal me, 
I
 resolved to continue seven dayes without speaking, assuring my self that my just cause would not fail me, being confident of the great vertue of these my seven Masters; who like vigilant and vertuous Advocates have alwayes oppo∣posed themselves against the fury of those who endeavoured the ruin of my life and honor.


And thereupon he gave a particular account of what they had seen in the Heavens and the Aspects of the Stars, that evening before they took their journey to 
Rome;
 and the resolution which he and his Masters had thereupon taken, in pursuance where∣of he had suffered very much, considering the great inconvenience caused by his silence, which gave oc∣casion to all people to believe that in regard he made no defence, he was guilty of the great felony where∣of he was accused; yet however his heart had not failed him, being assured that what was once esta∣blished and confirmed by the Caelestial influences; (that is if he continued silent) he should avoid that disaster; so that in conclusion he did not doubt but by this means all things would be well, notwithstand∣ing the impetuosity of the words, and storms which had so over-whelmed him; wherein the will of the Gods appeared to be different from that of men, for all mortal things are easily changed, whereas the will of God being immortal, remaines eternally immutable; so that what hath bin once determined

 above follows by necessity, although it be by ordi∣nary means, notwihstanding all oppositions and con∣tradictions whatsoever, And that it is thus said the young Prince, I will prove it to you by the example of a very vertuous young man, and to whom Fortune was so contrary, that he who should have advanced him, endeavoured his death; and yet however he ar∣rived to be a King from being a mean personage, as the influences of the Stars had predicted, and that which was intended to hinder his greatness, was the means whereby he arrived to royal dignity.


And 
I
 now make it my humble request to you all here present to excuse the length of my discourse, in regard I have been silent so long, and now being at li∣berty to speak; I think it not to be inconvenient nor unreasonable, that I give my self this satisfaction, & that I use my utmost endeavours to please my Audi∣tors, the matter in question being of so great impor
¦ance to me.


Long time since in the 
Levant
 Countries, and par∣ticularly in the most illustrious and famous City of 
Alexandria,
 there lived a Merchant named 
Euro∣pus,
 who contrary to the custome and fortune of ma∣ny others, having a long time traffiqued with Mer∣chandise without any los
, had so increased his riche
 and arrived to so much wealth, that he had no mind to have any more; and contrary to the humor of most men, was content with what he had. This Mer∣chant being thus wealthy left of his tradeing, take∣ing no other thoughts but of advancing an only Son which he had, who was called 
Hermogenes
 to at∣tain to which he sent him to study, that he might fashion him to those things that were gentile and

 honorable; and Fortune was so favourable to him in this enterprise, that in short time he saw his son ve∣ry well instructed in Learning and Armes, and in all other vertuous actions becoming a Gentle-man; yet however seeing that he was morose and melancholly, by reason he had no company in the house to con∣verse with at home, neither had he travelled abroad; for there is no better way to know the World than to travel in it, which gives a greater reputation to men, and is more profitable than to live alwayes at home in their Nests; wherefore that he might please him, he resolved to travel into several places, and ha∣ving made provision of moneys necessary for such an undertaking, and chosen out those that should ac∣company or attend him, he provided and furnished a Ship, wherein he and all his company embarqued, and having taken order about his Domestick af∣fairs, with the first good wind they set sail, and having sailed several dayes, and meeting with a storm, they made towards an Island where they landed; in this Island he had a mind to remain some dayes, as being a pleasant place; well ma∣nured, and the Inhabitants very civil and courte∣ous, but being desirous to pursue his Voyage, he embarkqued, when he and his son had no sooner left the shore but they saw two Birds as white as Swans, who hovered about their Vessel, and in the end perched on the Antient of the main M
st, where they had not long rested, but they descended as if they would have setled on the head of the young 
Hermogenes,
 but soon re∣turned from whence they came, where they began to warble & sing so sweetly & harmoniously that one

 would have imagined them to have bin Musitian
 that endeavoured to shew their utmost skill and cun∣ning; so that all the Ships company, who were plea∣sed with their harmony, durst not stir for fear of di∣sturbing them; 
Europus
 who had formerly learned several words of the auguries of Birds, and their significations, bethought himself what this might mean, being ignorant whither it foretold good or e∣vil; and seeing his son very pensive, and yet never∣theless very pleasant in countenance, he said to him, is it possible that what I have formerly heard hath been true, that there are brute Beasts, who by extra∣ordinary gestures will foretel things to come; and that there are men so wise as to understand them? there is nothing more certain replyed young 
Hermo∣genes,
 for often times by these and such like means, some men have fore-told several accidents to come, a long time before they have hapned, and that their hearts might be enlightned, and be upon the greater certainty, they offered sacrifices proper thereunto; making use of many things that I shall not at present mention. If this be true said the Father, I would gladly know the meaning of the singing of these two Birds, if you are very desirous said young 
Her∣mogenes,
 for the Obligation which I have to obey you, 
I
 will give you that satisfaction let what will be∣fal me; and therefore you are to take notice that all which you have seen, and all the warbling of the Birds was made only in respect of me, and of my future greatness, for these Birds have signifyed no other thing but as they perched themselves so much higher than you are, so much hereafter shall 
I
 surpass you in greatness, in sign whereof they have begun to sing praises to me.




The Merchant 
Europus
 hearing this was surprized tither with Choller or Envy, or rather with both to∣gether, and in a great fury said, I will take order that this angury shall not take effect, and saying so, he took his son by the shoulders and threw him over∣board into the Sea; saying to those in the Ship, that although he desired his Sons advancement; yet how∣ever he intended not to make him greater than him∣self; and that he had rather choose to dye without an Heir, than to give the least respect in the world to his Son, and therefore he commanded instantly to hoyst up the sailes, and steer their course for 
Alexandria,
 certainly believing that his Son was devoured by the wave
, but it hapned quite otherwise, for he thinking to abase his Son, and to hinder the great∣ness that was prepared for him, he shortned his way thereunto; young 
Hermogenes
 than endeavouring to gain the shore by swiming so well as he could, a strong wind so assisted him, that in less than an hour he found himself ashore, on the same Island from whence they set out & from whence his cruel father had cast him in∣to the Sea being much weary & spent; yet the Islanders releived him so well (having compassion for the cru∣elty that had been shewed to him) that he in short time recovered, and having continued two dayes in that Island, he saw a very large Merchants Ship w
 endeavoured to take harbor there to refresh them∣selves, and take in fresh water, and considering with himself that to continue longer in that Island, his condition would not be better, he made his case known to the Master of the Ship, who was a rich Merchant of 
Candy,
 named 
Sterifo,
 who having dis∣coursed

 with young 
Hermogines,
 and understanding from him particularly how every thing had hapned, he asked him what course he intended to take; to this the young man answered that he was content to what he sh
uld please to command him, if he would be pleased to accept of his service; whereupon 
Steri∣fo
 being very willing, accepted of him, and from that time 
Hermogenes
 disposed himself to serve him truly and faithfully, which he performed so well, that 
Ste∣rifo
 being childless and being out of hopes of having any Children, purposed to adopt the young 
Hermo∣genes,
 
eeing his good and honest carriage, which was every way such as 
Sterifo
 desired in a Son, if he had had any; Being arrived at his house, and having acquainted his wife with his design, he found her very willing and free to it, and f
on after they both declared him for their proper Child, and because of the bounty of Fortune which had been manifested towards him, they changed his Nam
 and called him 
Entichus;
 that is to say 
Bonadventure,
 or good 
Ad∣venture,
 which being done you may understand that if at the beginning, a young man so well bred, had carried himself respectively towards 
Stirefo
 and his Wife when he was adopted, he then made it his Study to do much better, and with all fidelity, dili∣gence and readiness to apply himself to their ser∣vice.


It was about this time that the King of 
Candy,
 who was named 
Critorneus,
 that is to say a Judge of Birds, (whether that were his proper name or only impo∣sed on him) by a certain accident, was then in great trouble, and not knowing which way or how to de∣liver himself out of it, he counted himself to be un∣happy

 and unfortunate, and being ignorant of the cause of this trouble; he Judged that some great mis∣fortune would befall him, and the 
Candiots
 his Sub∣jects had a bad opinion of him, supposing that this had happened in respect of some enormous Sin which he had Committed. And this was his affliction, so often as he went out of his Chamber three Crowes would present themselves before him, as if they had waited on purpose, which flew round about him fluttering and Croaking in such manner, that the poor Prince had his brains almost broken, so that he was forced to return into his Chamber from this mischief, being very desirous to be released, as his last refuge, he cau∣sed it to be proclaimed through all his Countries by Sound of Trumpets, and through all the Isle of 
Candy
 that if there were any one who could remedy this Croaking of the Crows, and deliver him from the trouble which they gave him; he would give them the one half of his Kingdome for their reward and if it were a man, he would furthermore give his onely Daughter in marriage to them.


This being Proclamed, many went to try their skill, thinking to deliver the King from the trouble of the Crows, some by Negromancy and the In∣vocation of Spirits, and others by certain Medeci∣nal compotsi
ons and Ten thousand other experi∣ments, and yet there was none that could effect what they intended. The young 
Entichus
 un∣derstanding this news of the Proclamation of the King of 
Candy
 bethought himself that it

 might happen to be he that should receive this great reward which the King had promised, since all con∣sisted in the Interpretation of the Gestures and Song of the Crowes, in which knowledge he was very well skill'd; and therefore he humbly entreated 
Steri∣fo
 (without whose commands he would undertake nothing) that he would please to give him leave to deliver King 
Gritorneus
 from the trouble of the Crowes, assuring him that he could easily perform it; to this the Old man consented, and he himself pre∣sented him to the King, who likewise promised him, that so soon as 
Entichus
 should have delivered him from the trouble wherein he was, he would perform the promise he had made, and confirmed it with an oath; whereupon young 
Entichus
 having made his Reverence to the King, he humbly entreated that it would please his Majesty to take the Aire out of his Pallace, assuring him that he would immeadiately acquaint him, with the occasion of the Croaking of the birds, and by that means free him from the trouble he was in. The King very readily performed this, but he was no sooner come out of his doors, but the Crowes came fluttering and Croaking more then ever they had done. The young 
Entichus
 said to the King, know Sir, that this Croaking and fluttering of the birds, comes not by any evil that is in you nor any other in your house, but these birds come to you to decide a difference which is between them: This Crow which is known by his feathers to be older than the other, took to wife this other which appears to be a Male but is a Female, but when a scarcity of provision happened, he hunted her away and would not keep her company, so that she joyned her self to

 this young Crow, which is that in the middle; when there was victuals enough to eat then the old Crow would again have his Female, but she seemed to be discontented, and furtherfore the young Crow hoped to have some pleasure with the Female in that good season, since he had provided for her in the time of scarcity, & this being in debate, & they not agreeing there upon are com to you that by your royal authori¦ty whereby you make Laws and ordinances, that you would be pleased to put an end to their difference, by your definitive sentence; assuring you Sir, that so soon as you shall pronounce sentence they will be gone, and trouble you no further. The King hear∣ing what 
Entichus
 had said, adjudged by his absolute sentence the Female to the young Crow, and he had no sooner made an end of pronouncing his sentence but the Crowes flew away without ever returning again, to the wonder of all the Spectators, who much marvailed thereat, but above all the King was a∣stonished, and being transported ran to embrace young 
Entichus;
 telling him that from thenceforth he should take him and no other for his natural Fa∣ther, for said he I will perform my promise in giving you my Daughter and the half of my Kingdom, 
Enti∣chus
 making his due reverence to the King, humbly thanked him, and so they returned to the Pallace, the good old 
Sterifo
 being joyful of his Adopted Sons advancement after he had given him his best instructi∣ons and blessing, departed goeing home to his wife and leaving his Son 
Entichus
 at Court, both beloved and admired at by the King and all his Nobility, as well in respect of his Gallant deportment, as of his

 kill and cunning, for he frequented Jousts and Tournaments in short time became so Compleat a Practitioner, that he excelled all others still bearing a∣way the Prize.


At this time there was an Emperour of 
Germany,
 whose name was 
Frederick,
 who was so accomplished a Prince in all endowments both of body and mind, that he excelled all the Princes, Kings, and Empe∣rours in the whole world. The same of this Empe∣rours vertues flying abroad into all parts, it came to the hearing of Prince 
Entichus
 (for so I may now call him, his vertue having procured him that Title) who being desireous of procuring fame abroad, as well as it home; and therefore purposing to t
avell, and no place being so fit as he thought as the Court of the Emperour 
Fredrick
 he asked leave of the King to go thither. His request was not denied, only the King adv
sed him to stay some time till honourable provision were made for him, that he might appear at the Emperours Court, in an equipage befitting the Son of the King of 
Candy,
 and that before he went he would perform what was at first intended, and was indeed necessary in marrying his Daughter. To this Prince 
Entichus
 replied, Most renowned King and honoured Father, I most humbly thank you for your great respect towards me, in condesending to give me attendance, and other equipage befitting your Son, but I desire you to spare that charge and trouble, for if my own vertues are not sufficient to to bespeak and make known my quallity, it will be in vain to have any other Ornaments; therefore 
I
 desire to go, although not altogether unaccompanied

 and as a private person, yet to have as few as may be, and as little charge only your Letters Credenti∣als, that I may be received as your Son if I shall de∣serve that Title; and as to your other desire of my present marriage, I humbly and heartily thank you for your offer, and above all things accept of your Majesties Alliance, but desire the consumation there∣of may be deferred till my return, hoping then to bring so good a fame with me, as may in part merit the Illustrious Title of your Son-in-law, and there∣by render me to your Daughter more acceptable for her husband.


Prince 
Entichus
 having finished his speech, which was dilligently observed by the King who knew it was modest and reasonable, he therefore consented thereto and gave him leave to depart accordingly first furnishing him with a sufficient quantity of Money and Jewels; and now in short time he arriv∣ed at the Court of the Emperour, who received him with 
ll Immaginable kindness: And there he be∣haved himself so well, that the Emperour made him his Carver. And soon after Prince 
Arthur
 Son to the King of 
England,
 arriving there was kind
y re∣ceived of the Emperour, and him he made his Cup∣bearer; And these two Princes 
Entichus
 and 
Ar∣thur
 were so like one another in face Proporti∣on, and voice, that they could hardly be distingui∣shed, and as they were alike in bodies, so they Loved each other with an entire and f
ithful af∣fection.


The Emperour had only one Child and that was a Daughter who although she kept a Court by

 her self and had servants of her own yet every day did the Emperour send her a dish from his own table by 
Entichus
 his Carver, who by that means had the opportunity of seeing her and the advantage to be e∣steemed by her; but he being one day absent from the Emperours Table, and the Emperour according to Custom intending to send to his Daughter; Prince 
Arthur
 performed that Office on his behalf, by this means he had the sight of the Princess 
Angelica
 (for so was she named) who perceiving that it was not 
Entichus,
 enquired his name and quality, and he having answered her departed, but although he was well in body, yet he was so sorely troubled in mind that not being able to hold up his head, he retired and went to Bed.


His friend Prince 
Entichus
 missing him, and doubt∣ing the matter to be as indeed it it was (for he un∣derstood that he had supplyed his place, in carrying a Dish from the Emperour to the Princess,) and he supposing that the sight of her, had wounded his heart with love; he therefore w
nt to his friend 
Arthurs
 Chamber, and demanded the cause of his sickness, which Prince 
Arthur
 being unwilling to discover, made excuses, but 
Entichus
 being confirmed in his o∣pinion, declared it to his friend 
Arthur,
 who then could not deny, but that the Love of the Princess 
Angelica
 was the cause of his distemper; thereupon 
Entichus
 desired 
Arthur
 to be comforted, and he would assist him in all that he might, neither did he fail in his promise, for the next day he having the op∣portunity of waiting on the Princess, he presented her with a Rich Jewell of his own, but delivered it as sent to her by his friend 
Arthur,
 whose Love he

 recommended to her and 
me an humble Suitor to her in his behalf.


The Princess seemed to be offended with him for his boldness and charged him not to proceed in that manner, but however he took all opportunities of presenting her with Jewels from the Prince 
Arthur,
 and used all possible Arguments to induce her to pitty and love his friend; whereupon she who had borne some affection to himself, asked him why he had not spoken on his own behalf, to this he replied that he did not esteem himself so worthy as the Prince his friend, either in birth or otherwise, and besides that his heart had not as yet been wounded with love, as his friends was; wherefore there being so great a friendship between him and Prince 
Arthur,
 he thought himself oblieged to try all means to procure his satisfaction and therefore he was an humble Supplyant to her in his friends be∣half.


The Princess understanding thus much, and being enclined to love Prince 
Arthur,
 accepted of those pre∣sents that 
Entichus
 had offered, and at his entreaty was won to admit them both into her Chamber, at a time appointed that evening. This was good news to 
Entichus,
 who soon carried tydings hereof to his friend 
Arthur;
 who was in a manner ravished with joy at the recitall, so that he left his Bed and was immeadiately so well, that at the time appointed he went to visit his fair Princess; who received him kind∣ly at present and soon after was conquered with his Importunity and his friends courtship, so that he had freedome to be with her, when and as often as he pleased; but this affair was mannaged very privately

 in regard the Empero
 
s very cautious and vigilant over his Daughter, and many Courtiers who per∣ceived 
Arthers
 too much familiarity with the Prin∣cess; were envious thereat, and sought how to en∣trap him, but they were frustrated and disappointed in their contrivances, by the vigilance and valour of his friend 
Entichus;
 who oftentimes put his person in great hazard on his friends behalf.


The case stood thus with these Princes, when Let∣ters came to 
Entichus
 of the death of the King of 
Candy,
 and that he should return and take possession of his kingdom, this newes he declared to them who were right sorrowful for his departure, and so was the Emperor himself when he came to take leave of him; but however knowing that it was necessary for his advancement, he gave leave for his departure, most of the Court attended him part of his way, but particularly his friend 
Arthur
 and the Princess, who were grieved for the loss of his Company, he advi∣sed them to be very private in their meeting, telling 
Arthur
 that some one in time would discover his love to the Princess, if he were not very wary and circum∣spect, and that would be his ruine; to this be promi∣sed to take good heed, and Prince 
Arthur
 taking a precious ring from his finger, and giving it to Prince 
Entichus
 after strict embraces, and a solemn but sor∣rowful f
rewell, these friends and Lovers seperated, he pursuing his journey, and they returning to Court; where not long after 
Pharamond
 Son to the King of 
France,
 arrived and was admitted into the place of P
ince 
Entichus,
 which was much to the sorrow and trouble of the two Lovers, for

 they were suspected and watched by Prince 
Phara∣mond,
 who was so curious in his search after the truth of their love, that he found it and discove
ed them, and having some designs upon the Princess himself, and now finding all his hopes frustrated, he through rage and anger resolved to be revenged on them both; and therefore he publickly accused them both before the Emperor, who so soon as he heard of it was very angry, and sending for 
Arthur,
 told him of what he was accused, telling him that if it were proved, he should dye a shameful death; 
Arthur
 pleaded that he was innocent, and that he would prove it in Battel against his Accuser, to this the other consented, and the Emperor assigned them the day of Combat.


This was very unpleasant to Prince 
Arthur,
 but much more to the Princess, when he acquainted her therewith; but they seeing how their affairs stood, advised how to prevent the ensuing danger, for dangerous it would be for him to fight with 
Pharamond,
 who was not only a very valiant Knight, but had a just and true cause, which com∣monly is the occasion of the victory; whereas if he should fight in defence of an untruth and for that of which he was guilty, he might justly expect to 
ail, and be vanquished; this they both beleived would happen, and therefore consulted what to do, and thus it was, that they wanted the pre∣sence of their dear friend 
Entichus.
 This con∣sideration brought it into the minde of the Prin∣cess, how that they should accomplish their bu∣siness, and therefore she having thus advised her Lover; to take his opportunity very suddenly,

 to speak with the Emperor, and tell him that he had received Letters from the King his Father, that he must needs go home suddainly, because he was sick; and therefore to desire his leave to dpart, and to give longer time for the Combat, which having obtained, to go then immediately to King 
Entichus,
 and desire his advice and assistance; Prince 
Arthur
 followed the directions of the Princess in all these particulars, and obtaining leave of the Emperor, he travelled so long that he arrived at the Court of King 
Entichus,
 and there privately be acquainted him with his af∣fairs, and the occasion of his journey; King 
Entichus
 was very glad to see him, and desirous to all things to advise and assist him but knew not how; there is no way but this replyed 
Arthur,
 that you return in my behalf, and not being known to be other than my self, on my befalf to perform the Battel and return; King 
Entichus
 approved of what his friend 
Arthur
 had pro∣pounded, but they were very much straitned for time in regard it was but eight dayes time to the day pre∣fixed for the combate, and if it were delayed for one day he could not possibly arrive there time enough, and he had invited all his Nobility on the next day to come to his Wedd
ng. This was such an ob
tacle as could not be removed or remedyed, and put them to their wits ends; but King 
Entichus
 being resolved to give an absolute proof of his friendship, and ha∣zard Kingdome, Wife and Life, and all rather than his friends should suffer in their honor, he therefore thus contrived the business; that Prince 
Arthur
 in all things resembling King 
Entichus
 should stay there, and as if it were he be married to his Queen, and hold all the solemnity of the Nuptials, only when he was in bed with her to forbear proceeding with her: and

 that he would immediately return to the Emperors Court, and undertake the Combate, and if he ob∣tained the Victory suddainly return, and so might he do so too to his best beloved, this being concluded upon they seperated accordingly.


On the next day was solemnized the Wedding of Prince 
Arthur
 and the Queen, as if he had been King 
Entichus,
 and after much feasting, at night he went to bed with his Bride, but that he might per∣form with King 
Entichus,
 he laid a naked sword be∣tween them, and which she much wondred at, how∣ever he continued to do so all the time of the absence of his friend; King 
Entichus
 arrived at the Emperors Court, applyed himself to the Emperor, telling him that although his Father the King of 
England
 was very sick, yet as a true Knight he had left him, and was come at the time prefixed, to perform the ap∣pointed Combate, the Emperor received him kindly, and wished him good success, and so he went to his Lodgings as if he had been Prince 
Arthur,
 only the Princess entertained him privately, and understood from him in what condition he had left his friend, much wondring that there should be so much friend∣ship between them. The next day being the day of Battel, both the Champions being ready before the Combate began, King 
Entichus
 before the Emperor declared that if 
Pharamond
 did accuse him with in∣continence, or too much familiarity with the Princess 
Angelica,
 that the accusation was false and untrue, and that he therein lyed to the great dishonor of him∣self, the Princess, and of the Emperor, and that he was a false Kt. and that he was then ready to make good upon him in single combat. 
Pharamond
 hearing this protestation, answered, that what he had said was

 true, and that he was ready to prove, and thereupon being both ready arth'd, they mounted their horses and began the combate which lasted not long, for K. 
Entichus
 being the better Warriour, soon vanquished his enemy, and cutting off his head, presented it to the Princess to her great joy; and to the satisfaction of the Emperor, and all the Court, who applauded King 
Entichus,
 supposing him to be Prince 
Arthur;
 but he having leave of the Emperor to go to his sick Father, as he pretended, and having taken his farewel of the Emperor and Princess, he departed not towards 
England
 as he pretended, but to his own kingdom; where he was privately but joyfully re∣ceived of Prince 
Arthur,
 to whom he gave a true ac∣count of the success of his journey, to his great sa∣tisfaction, who told him that he had saved his life and the Princesses; and therefore he was Debtor to him for both, not being able to requite such a peice of friendship but with his own life, which he would gladly at ony time off
r up for his service; this was the kindness between these two unparralled frinds, whose friendships exceeded all that was ever written, as in the s
quel of my discourse you will understand, but at present after many kindnesses offered to one a∣nother, these two friends 
Entichus
 and 
Arthur
 sepa∣rated; 
Arthur
 returned to the E. Court, and 
Entichus
 remained in his own kingdom, neither was it known of any that he had bin absent for when night came he went to bed to his 
Q.
 and as soon at he was laid be∣gan to kiss and embrace her in loving manner, she hereupon told him that this was a suddain alteration, as how said he, because replyed she, you hitherto have been very cautious of coming near me, and have put a naked sword in bed between us, not so much as turn∣ing

 towards me; Oh my dear Lady said he, that was intended for no harm, only the performance of a vow, which time being expired, 
I
 shall for the fu∣ture make you amends, she seemed to be contented with his excuse, but was so enraged with his former coldness, that she was resolved to be revenged on him, and therefore consulting with a Knight of the Court, who had formerly loved and courted her, they con∣spired his ruine; and to that end they gave him poy∣son, which he taking had almost bereaved him of his life, but although he escaped with life, yet the poy∣son had such effects as it made him like a Leaper, and that in a monstruous manner; so that he was abomi∣nable to behold, and being abhorred by his Queen and Subjects, they turned him out of his kingdome, his wife being married to the Knight 
I
 lately spake of, who reigned as King in his stead.


This was the sad condition of the poor unfortu∣nate 
Entichus,
 but on the other side, Prince 
Arthur
 was as highly advanced, for his father the King of 
England
 dying, he became King, and the Emperour of 
Germany
 dying, and he marrying with the Princess 
Angelica
 he was crowned Emp. King 
Entichus
 un∣derstanding the fortune of his friend to be thus pros∣perous was joyful, and resolved to go to him for re∣leif in time of adversity, and therefore putting on Her∣mits apparrel, he travelled to the E. court, where when he was arrived and would have entred, he was turned out by the courtiers, who could not indure the sight of so deform'd a monster, wherefore he spak with one of the Emperor servants, desiring him for the love of God to do a message for him. The servant being a sober person bid him speak on

 on and say what he would have? 
I
 desire said the Leaper that you go to the Emperour and tell him that here is a Leaper, that desires for the love of God and King 
Entichus
 his sake, that he may be admited to eat in some place this day, in the Emperours presence. The Servant told the Leaper that certainly his request would be refused, but however he would perform his desire; and thereupon went and told the Emperour, who hearing the name of his dear friend King 
Enti∣chus,
 was so charmed therewith that he presently con∣sented to the Leapers request, commanding that he should eat in the Hall at a Table by himself, and be respected as a person of honour; Dinner time being come, and the Emperour and his Courtiers being sat at Table the Leaper was also placed and served, and when he had eaten he desired one of the Servitors to go to the Emperour, and desire him for King 
Enti∣chus
 his sake to send him his best Bowl ful of Wine; This is an unreasonable request said the Servitor, for my Lord the Emperour will never drink in it again, if you should once touch it but however he went and delivered his Message to the Emperour who wondred at the request, but performed what was desired, and the Leaper receiving the Bowl drank off the Wine, and taking the Ring which formerly the Emperour had given him, put it into the Bowl and de∣sir'd the Servitor to carry it to the Emperor, who see∣ing the Ring and knowing it, was amazed believing he should hear something of his dear friend 
Entichus;
 wherefore he commanded that the Leaper should be look'd after & conducted to his private Chamber that he might speak with him, this his commands was o∣bey'd, and he arising from Dinner went to the Leaper,

 and being alone with him, he asked how he came by that ring, very honestly replyed the Leaper, I had it of the right owner, who said the Emperor King 
Enti∣chus?
 no said the Leaper, of 
Arthur
 Prince of 
Eng∣land,
 that cannot be replyed the Emperor, for I am that 
Arthur,
 and I gave it to none but my dear friend King 
Entichus,
 that is confessed said the Leaper, and since you still call 
Entichus
 your dear friend, know that I am that unfortunate King; Oh what impossi∣bilities do you tell me said the Emperor! nothing but what is too true replyed the King with tears in his eyes, which by this time flowed too from the Empe∣rors eyes, down his cheeks in great abundance, but his greif and passion having had this vent for a time, he then ran to the Leap
rous King, and kissed and embraced him, crying out on my dear friend, how is this great mi
f
rtune befallen you; you replyed the King are the occasion of it, though I must confess you to be innocent, how said the Emperor could I your friend be the cause of this misfortune and yet be innocent: it is most certain replyed the King, for your friendship to me in lyi
g with my wife, and being innocent in not knowing her, she supposeing you to be me, hath so enrag
d her, that she revenged her
elf on me by poyson, which hath wrought this dismal effect upon me, so that your innocence occasi∣oned my ruine; and thereupon the King related the whole manner how it had befallen him, and how he was turned out of his Kingdome, Oh me unfortu∣nate said the Emperor! that I should occasion so much evil, that my dear friend who hath so often hazarded his life for me should be thus evilly recom∣penced through my occasion: I cannot (said the King)

 complain of you, but of fortune, to whom we must all submit, well said the Emperor, since you are still Master of so much vertue continue it and hope the best; and 
I
 will endeavour your remedy if it may be done by the skill of any man, I will give a∣ny reward, nothing in my Dominions shall be wanting or spared that may do you good: the good King thanked him, and resolved to continue there unknown to all, to see if there might be any remedy for his infirmity.


In order to his cure the Emperor imployed all Phi∣sitians that he could here of, setting out Procla∣mations, that if any could cure this distemper, they should have a large reward; but when all was done they could do nothing, and so they told him, that it was not within the cure of Phisick, and that if he were ever healed it must be by miracle. The Emperor hearing this was very much afflicted, and being resolved to try alwayes for the restau∣ration of his friend, he applyed himself to all reli∣gious Persons and their prayers, neither was he wanting in his own, for he did not only make fre∣quent and daily prayers for his friend, but he set a∣part several dayes whereon he fasted and prayed up∣on this occasion; the good King 
Entichus
 was pati∣ent in this adversity, and yet prayed also to be de∣delivered from this evil if it might stand with the good pleasure of the Almighty, who in the end was entreated of him, and in a Vision told King 
Entichus
 how he might be cured: but it was by so strange means that he resolved rather to continue as he was than attempt it; for the Vision told him that there was other way for his recovery, but to be bathed in

 blood of two Children of the Emperours which the Emperour must with his own hands kill, and after bath him with their blood; This was the only re∣medy prescribed for his malady, wherefore he purpo∣sed to be silent accounting it unreasonable to kill two Innocents to preserve one Sinner; but let him resolve what he pleases, it was the pleasure of heaven to re∣solve otherwise and as he had given an Unparalleld proof of his friendship to the Emperour, so the Em∣perour must retalliate and indeed exceed it in this great tryal of his naturall affection in preferring his friend before himself, for his Children may be term∣ed himself being the best part of him; wherefore that I may proceed you are to know that the Emperour still continued his prayers to heaven, neither was heaven silent, but in a vision told him that his friend 
Entichus
 knew how to be cured, he thereupon goes to him and desires him to tell him and that truly if he did not know of a remedy for his disease, to this af∣ter much importunity, 
Entichus
 not only told him that he did but also the manner now, but withall dis∣swades him from executing it; to this the Emperour replyed, that since heaven prescribed the remedy he would dispute no further but obey what was com∣manded; and thereupon went and Cut the throats of the two Innocents, and saving the blood and bathing his friends body therewith, he became as cleer and fair as ever, to the great joy of them both, the Emperour rejoycing that he had so good an opportunity as to give proof of his friendship.


The King being thus healed, it was thus agreed that he should leave the Court and go some few miles out of the Town, wherein he should have attendants

 suitable to his quality, and then he should send word of his approach, and so should be met and entertain∣ed as to his dignity appertained; accordinly there came a Messenger the next day into the Emperors Hall, who gave the Emperor an account of the arri∣val of his friend King 
Entichus.
 The Empress hear∣ing of this news was joyful, and told the Emperor that by all means they must entertain their good friend very splendedly, and to that end said she, you with your Nobles, and I with my Ladies will go meet him; to this the Emperor agreed, and they rode together till they met him and received him with great reverence; and attending him till they came to the Pallace, where they gave him royal entertain∣ment.


Although the Emperor was joyful at his dear friends company, yet the Empress exceeded him in demonstration of her joye; which the Emperor ob∣serving, he told her that he was well pleased there∣with: wherefore said the Empress should I not ex∣press my joy to the heighth, for his company is more precious than all the Treasure in the World; for by his means you attained to this hono
 and dignity, and he hath often hazarded his life to save yours.


The Emperor hearing this, desired her to take good notice of what he should presently say; it is not long since (continued he) that a deformed Leaper was in my Court, I well remember him said the Empress, a most horrible creature he was indeed; suppose (said the Emperor) this Leaper were our friend King 
Entichus,
 and that there was no way to cure him of his loathsome Leaprosie, but by the death of both your children, in whose blood he must be

 washed, could you for his sake suffer it. It is a very strange question replyed the Empress, but I thus re∣solve it, that had I ten Children, I would kill them all with my own hands, rather than our dear friend King 
Entichus
 should continue so loathsome a Lea∣per, for we might have more Children, but never such a friend as he. The Emperour hearing her constant speech, was resolved to make full tryal of her con∣stancy, and told her how all had hapned, and that her two Children were dead, she bearing this, notwith∣standing all her eouragious speeches, yet Nature so wrought with her that she sunk down in a swoun, but remedies being used she recovered; at the newes of the Emperours Childrens death, the Nurses went to see after them, when they came where they were, and expected to finde them dead, they saw the contra∣ry; for they were alive and singing, and about their Necks where they were cut, were Circles of Gold; this joyful newes was brought to the Emperor and Empress, who were exceeding joyful thereat, give-thanks to Heaven for this Miracle.


Soon after the Emperour raiseing an Army, went along with King 
Entichus
 to 
Candy,
 and overcoming an Army which the Queen and her Husband had raised, King 
Entichus
 was ag
in put in possession of his Kingdome, and the Queen and her Husband slain,


And now the King being a single man, that these two friends might be allyed by marriage as well as affection, the Emperour having one only Sister, gave her in Marriage to his Friend King 
Entichus


 and then these two great friends were again sepe∣rated.


The Emperour returning to his Empire, and the King remaining in peaceable and quiet possession of his Kingdom; and now he began to think of his old friends especially his Foster father 
Sterifo
 whom he ennobled with Titles of honour, and giving him an honourable and profitable employment at Court, had him near him as a Counsellor in all his affairs; and carrying himself courteously and justly to his Subjects, he was beloved of all them and feared of his enemies. Thus affairs grow∣ing every day better and better, it happened that in the Citty of 
Alexandria,
 which was his naturall Country, the great warrs, unfruitful seasons, and o∣ther bad influences had caused such a Scarcity of Victuals, that the g eate
t part of the inhabitants dyed with famine; so that the inhabitants of 
Alexandria
 were necessitated to travel into se∣veral Countries to get Corn for the poor, and therefore they made choice of the most expert and the most knowing men that they could find amongst them (who willingly accepted of the Imployment, because they were well provided with every thing) that from other parts they might relieve their Citizens, passing their time at the charge of others. Among the rest they made Choice of 
Europus
 the naturall Father of 
Enti∣chus,
 and who had thrown him into the Sea; who having taken Povt in the Isle of 
Candy
 where the Stars had so long before prepared a Crown

 for him, he desired leave to buy up in that Island a great quantity of Corn, King 
Entichus
 being ac∣quainted herewith caused enquitey to be made, who they were that were in the Ship, and from whence they came, and being informed of the truth, and knowing the necessity of his Country, and the name of the Commander, and of the Ship, he did suspect that it was his Father; and therefore he purposed before he departed to make himself known to him, and to put him in mind of the great fault which he had committed. Whereupon having sent for him, to come to his Pallace pretending to discourse with him about other affairs, he cau∣sed him to stay and Dine with him: which invi∣tation he knowing not how to refuse, accepeted of w
th such honour and reverence, as hath been accusto∣med to be used by those who speak with Kings, Prin∣ces, and other great Lords.


Being at the Table, after that the King had suf∣ficiently informed himself of the estate of the City of 
Alexandria
 in generall, he questioned with his Father of his particular affairs, of his name, and how many Children he had? Where∣upon the Merchant having told his name, answer∣ed sighing that he had no Children, and that he never had but one, who perished in the Sea by a miserable misfortune.


It may be said the King your Son is not dead, for there is one here present who hath escaped from such a like misfortune as you speak of and as he saith he is the Son of a Merchant of the City of 
Alexandria,
 and therefor
 advised him to

 look about him, upon all the Company there present for it may happen that he may know his Son, before his Son did know him. The Merchant observing what the King had said, began to take notice of all those that were in the Hall; and on the other side every one looked upon him, believing that they should un∣derstand somewhat that was as yet unknown, and after he had well looked upon and taken notice of e∣very one, he said to the K ng that he could not find that his Son was there present, whereupon the King said, if you had well considered the Spectacle which you had of the two white Birds, and the interpre∣tation that was made to you, you would of your self have known that which I shall now tell you; for it was I my felf, whose way to greatness you would hinder instead of advanceing it as you ought. The good man hearing him speak of two white Birds, suddenly changed his Collour, being confounded within himself with shame; But when he heard this spoken to his face and in the presence of so many great Lords, the occasion that had moved him to such an excess, he g
ew pale and red both at once; and know∣ing no other way to make amends for his faults, he arose from the Table and cast himself at his Sons feet asking him p
rdon. But the King who was no less generous then great and puissant took hold of him and raised him, praying him that forgetting what was passed he would make use of that power which God had given him and that he would rest con∣tented that he had made him know by effects that it is impossible to interrupt or hinder that which the pleasure of God hath once ordained; and so having

 sent by others a sufficient quantity of Corn for his Country, he caused his Father to remain with him, taking order to bring the rest of his family to 
Candy,
 to participate of that good fortune which had befallen him, contrary to all humane thoughts and which he had well and wisely persued.


By this Example (said 
Erastus
) and many others as admirable as this, which I could relate; we may assuredly conclude that whatsoever hath been once ordained and established above, doth usually come to pass, so that nothing here below can obstruct or hin∣der it; being assured of this, I and my Masters did ex∣pose our selves to very great hazard and danger, in our coming to 
Rome,
 and the only remedy that we had was for me to be silent for the space of seven days, in doing whereof the heavens promised me a good issue and deliverance, provided that some would defend my cause, for that Term; the which my seven Masters like prudent and valliant Champions have done: I therefore resolved to follow the right re∣medy which had been prescribed me, for the conser∣vation of my life and honour, the which otherwise I should have dishonourably lost (as the heavens had let me know) soon after my arrivall at 
Rome,
 the shame whereof would have been much more grievious to me, than the death wherewith I was threatned. Behold then what hath induced me and indeed enforced me to be Dumb these seven days, which I suppose hath been as much to your astonishment, as my trouble to see my self constrained by a fatall silence to confirme the opini∣on

 that every one might have, that I would commit an action so wicked and wretched, as that which hath been falsly charged on me by the Empress; who be∣ing a woman and naturally enclined to be fickle and angry, and having been lately in love with me, it is no wonder if she hath converted that love which she first shewed me into a mortal hatred, endeavour∣ing to make me dye who am her Son in Law, as it hath frequently befallen others who without any reason have prosecuted their Sons in law, either through hatred or anger. As for hatred we may finde examples enough in antient Histories; as that which 
Jur
 conceived against 
Phrisso
 and 
Helle,
 and of the 
Modern
 Histories there are enough; and of hatred we may read how the cruel 
Phedra
 treated the inno∣cent 
Hipolitus,
 whose companion I had certainly bin, both in cause and miserable death; if the evi∣dent danger wherein I was, had not been manifested to me by Heaven, and the means to escape it, the which I have hitherto done by the good assistance of my Masters here present, to whom I am indebted, not only for the good instructions I have received of them but also for my life; as for the crime wherewith 
A∣phrodicia
 hath endeavoured to cha
ge me which is that I attempted to force her, and confirmed the truth of this outrage by my flight, it had been very easie for me to manifest my innocence, and her incontinence, if I had permission to speak, but knowing very well by the course of the Stars that my speech would not have de∣livered me from danger but rather have plunged 
s into a bottomless pit of misfortune, 
I
 have

 been constrained to endure these dayes past all the Calumnies that have been charged upon me, that I might now discharge my self, and mak
 my Innocence appear to all the World, I being unwil∣ling to advance before my time, lest I should at once loose both life and honor.


And now before I proceed any further, may it please you Sir, to grant me this favour, to cause the Empress to appear before you and the Senate, that the truth of what I shall speak may be cleered, and that you may not think 
I
 have contrived what I have spoken, as she hath falsly contrived the Im∣putation wherewith she hath charged me, miserably to ruine both my life and renown: yet however I do not desire the same manner of proceeding against her as hath been used against me; that is to begin with execution before the matter of fact in deliberatly debated, but I desire that the truth may be known by the confronting of the Parties, and that what term she pleases may be given for her justification, entreat∣ing you Sir to believe that what I shall propose to the Empress when she is present, to be for the discharge of my innocence, and the cleering of the truth, and not to imagine that I shall speak or propose any thing whatsoever for revenge, for it will never enter in
o the heart of any man of honor to revenge himself upon a woman. This Oration of Prince 
Erastus
 was spoken with so much confidence, that not only the Emperor, but also all the Senators, and generally all those who had heard him speak were astonished, & thereupon without any contradicton it was conclu∣ded & ordered that the Empress should be immediate∣ly sent for, who understood by her spies with what

 courage the Prince 
Erastus
 had spoken before the Se∣nate, and doubting what would become of her, she purposed to have fled, and by that means to escape the danger, but it was too late, for she had no soon∣er taken this resolution, but those whom the Empe∣ror had sent, came and surprized her; at whose arri∣val she lost courage, and was so out of countenance, that understanding the charge which they had from the Emperor, she could not give one word of answer, being pale and trembling not knowing what to do or say; whereupon those who were sent for her did easily conjecture that the case of 
Erastus
 was other∣wise than she had represented it, seeing that she was so confounded at her being carried before him. In this distracted condition they conducted her from the Pallace, into the Hall of the Senate, at whose ar∣rival all the Senators arose, making reverence to her, who took no notice of them; whereas formerly she was used to be so complaisant that she returned all sa∣lutations, not only to the Senators, but also to the meanest person in 
Rome,
 this fi
ceness was observed by all, being sate down by the Emperors side in a dif∣ferent posture from what she was used to, Prince 
E∣rastus
 pursuing his discourse, did particularly declare from the beginning to the end, all that had passed between him and her, beginning with the letters and rich presents which she had sent him before his comming to 
Rome,
 which might be attributed to a loving and Motherly affection, if she had not proceeded further; but no sooner was he come thither, when she made cleerly evident the dishonest intentions that she designed by

 those presents, endeavouring at the beginning by smooth and amorous speeches, and after that by dis∣ordinate and luxurious gestures, to induce him to vi∣olate the holy and sacred marriage of his father; and in conclusion endeavouring to have her pleasure with him by force: whereupon he had rather chosen to fly from her, than to stain his hands in her motherly blood, in revenging the great outrage she intended a∣gainst his Father; according to the enormity of the case, considering the violence she used to him, but she seeing that the case was otherwise than she ex∣pected, measuring the continence and chastity of o∣thers, according to her own disordinate appetite; through rage and anger to see her self so slighted, (as it is usual for women in her condition to do) or else doubting that he would discover this villany to the Emperor his Father, who might punish her as she justly deserved, took her advantage seeing him take his flight out of her Chamber, to cry out a Rape, and say that he would have forced her, confirming her re∣port by his suddain flight, assuting her self that this would be sufficient to move the Emperor and every body else, the truth being so apparant, to kill him immediately, being surprized in such an action, with∣out giving him leasure to justifie himself; and by this means failing in the satisfaction of her disordinate appetite, she might have the content to be revenged. To which design of hers at the beginning Fortune had been as favourable to her, as contrary to him, in winding him into this Labrinth; at such a time as the Heavens would not permit him to speak, whereby all men might beleive that he was guilty of the crime whereof he had been accused; true it is, that accord∣ing

 to the instability and ordinary inconstance of For∣tune, she had turned her wheel, giving opportunity to his Masters to stay the execution of the sentence against him, until he had the liberty of speaking, to manifest the matter as it had passed.


And here did Prince 
Erastus
 apply every thing to his purpose, which might be material to the conser∣vation of his life and honor; sometimes he would ad∣dress himself to the Empress, rehearsing to her the ve∣ry speeches she had used to him in her Chamber, with her luxurious and disorinate gestures whereby she endeavoured to induce him to let loose the Reynes of his continence, oftentimes asking her wherefore and for what cause she would thus 
aint an Imperial family with so villanous an action; to this the misera∣ble woman knew not what to answer, seeing her folly and treason so apparant in the presence of the Empe∣ror, and so many persons of honor which were there present, but her eyes were continually fixed on the ground, often changing her color, shrinking up her shoulders and sighing continually; which things ser∣ved as an absolute index to prove the speeches of P
: 
Erastus
 to be true, who was so eloquent and lively in his defence, that he not only drew to his side the Se∣nate, and others who loved and reverenced him, but also the friends and relations of the Empress, (who the evening before being seduced by the fraudulent speeches of 
Aphrodicia,
 had procured that without a∣ny delay Prince 
Erastus
 should be dispatched and with him the seven Philosophers) who were the first that declared the Prince to be innocent, casting themselves at his feet, and asking him pardon and mercy, most humbly entreating him that he would forget the pro∣secution

 which they had made against him, for that they as well as the Emperor had bin cunningly sedu∣ced; and for satisfaction if no others should, they themselves would take a revenge according to the quality of the crime against her, who by so great treason had abused them; hereupon Prince 
Erastus
 re∣ceived them very courteously, with a free and cleer countenance, and he and his seven Masters being un∣bound, he went directly towards the Emperor, who having retained all that his Son had said, how every thing had passed, he bethought him of his dream, understanding the truth of the Vision that had the night before appeared to him; and therefore ariseing from his Imperial seat, he went to his Som imbraceing him so loveingly that the tears flowed from his eyes, to see him in a manner raised from death to life, as well in body as in honor, which he esteemed more highly than life; and being about to excuse himself for those rigorous courses which had bin used against him, the young Prince interrupted his discourse, saying that his fatal silence was the cause of all, where∣of having said enough before the Senate he should forbear to speak further, only he intreated him to de∣clare plainly if he yet had any scruple of his being guilty, which was not cleered to him, so that he might fully justify himself; whereupon all the Senate una∣nimously answered him, that they esteemed him suffi∣ciently justifyed and innocent of that wherewith he had bin accused, and after some further discourse the Emperor caused him to sit down by him, to consult what should be done with the Empress; whereupon the Emperor (having learned by the pains & trouble he had lately suffered) speak aloud that by experi∣ence

 found it to be an unjust thing for a man to be a judge in the matter wherein he himself was concern'd and therefore he would not meddle with the proceedings about the Empress; but remit all to the judgement of the Senate to proceed as they should finde cause, without respect to any person; and accordingly by order of the Senate, the Empress was delivered into the Custody of some of the principal Senators until the next day, when they would consider what way to proceed against her; and if she should not at all justify her self, (as every one beleived it to be im∣possible) that sentence should be justly executed on her, that she would have unjustly caused to be exe∣cuted on the Prince; and that in the mean time all things should be taken from her, wherewith she might offend or kill her self through despair.








CHAP. XXIV.
 The Empress 
Aphrodicia
 understanding the desperate∣ness of her condition, being in Prison desperately killed her self.


SO soon as Prince 
Erastus
 was restored and con∣firmed according to his place and quality, the fame thereof was presently spread through all the City, by means of the great multitude who were assembled at the Pallace, to understand how the Case would be with Prince 
Erastus,
 which having had an honorable issue, all the 
Romans
 both general and par∣ticular, made the greatest feast in the World; in such manner that there was no Man or Woman, young nor old, great nor small, but laid aside all bu∣siness, though never so importunate; and hastening to the Pallace endeavoured to see the face of the Victorious and Triumphant 
Erastus;
 so that no tri∣umphant entry that was ever made in 
Rome,
 had caused so great a croud of people in all the streets, nor no joy more general nor more common; every one speaking so highly and advantageously as possib∣ly could be of Prince 
Erastus;
 who for his part re∣ceived all the people and saluted them with an incre∣dible modesty; letting them understand that he knew how to keep a 
medium
 without being elevated in pro∣sperity,

 as his spirits had never failed him when he was in adversity; but it was far otherwise with the unhappy 
Aphrodicia,
 who finding her self in the night time locked up in her Chamber, which those who had the charge of her had provided (they having offe∣red her two Damsels to keep her company, which she resolving to be alone had refused) she began to curse herself, the Heavens and Nature, and being enraged wished that before her death, that it were in her power to ruinate not only her Son in law, but also the Emperor himself, the Senate, the City of 
Rome,
 the Empire, and all the world together; and having a long time continued in these wicked meditations, and finding that this would be much more diffi∣cult than her former enterprize against the life of her Son in Law, she converted all her rage towards her self; and considering her self to be culpable not of the crime, which she intended to commit against her Husband, but that she enterprized a matter which she could not effect, she attempted to be, revenged on her self, and to dye by her own hands. And not finding any thing to make a cord to strangle her self & much less any thing to stab her self withal, she then found her self truly miserable, in that she was necessitated to dye of a violent death, and yet had not the means to execute her desires; this consi∣deration brought her into so great an Agony that she fell upon the floor in a swoon, in which she continu∣ed a long time without any knowledge, but in time she recovered, wherefore out of despite that she was come to her self, she afresh cursed ner self and her life, through rage and anger tearing her garment
, in doing whereof she saw she had fetched blood on one of her

 fingers, whereupon she search'd dilligently for that which had caused it, to see if therewith she might make a larger wound, wh
reby her Soul might make its issue out of her miserable body: Upon this curi∣ous search she found a bodkin, wherewith she was used to prick out figures in parchment to divert her self, and this she had stuck into her Clothes as wo∣men are used to do, without being taken notice of by her Attendants; they having been commanded to take from her every thing that might hurt her, but this bodkin was so Cunningly hidden that it was im∣possible to be found. Having found this bodkin she took it in her hand, and casting her self on her bed she said see what I am enforc'd to, Ah bodkin! thou hast ere now when I us'd thee, diverted me from me∣lancholly thoughts, but now thou must be instru∣mentall to deliver me from the sadest melancholly that ever any was possessed with. This bring uttered with a firme resolution she fixed this bodkin under her left breast, and with her finger thrust it so strong∣ly that it entred up to the top, so that having pierc∣ed her heart it was not long before death seized her; yet she lay rather like a sleeping than a dead woman.


At the break of day those Lords who had the charge and keeping of her, sent several Damsels to see how it was with the Empress, who opening the Chamber door very softly and seeing her lye on the bed thought that she had slept, not immagining that it was her last long sleep as indeed it was and there∣fore that they might not awak her they returned to those that had 
ent them, telling them that the Empress was fast asleep; whereupon those Sena∣tors that had the charge of her were amazed, won∣dring

 that one in her condition could sleep so soundly. The Sun being risen they went to the Senate, which on that occasion was so early assembled; where be∣ing come, they advised how they should proceed in this affaire, and they concluded that all manner of advantage allowed to Criminals, should be permitted to the Empress, that she might Justifie her self, that she should have leave to choose one or more Advo∣cates to plead her cause, either in her presence or in her absence, as she should think fit. This being de∣termined by the Senate, those who had the Empress in Custody were sent to fetch her, that she her self might see the fair means they would use in her cause, notwithstanding the great rigour and precipitateness which she had used against Prince 
Erastus.
 The Gentlemen being arrived at the lodging where the Empress was deteyned, sent the same Damsels that had been there in the morning to see what she did; who finding that she had not stirred, carried back word to the Gentlemen that she was not yet awake: Whereupon the Gentlemen wondring resolved to awake her, and thereupon entring into the Chamber with the Damsels they opened the Windows, and seeing that for all that she stirred not, one of the Damsels called softly, 
Madam, Madam;
 To which she not answering all who were in the Cham∣ber seeing her so pale did believe that some accident had happened, which was very likely in regard of her great trouble: yet nevertheless seeing that for ought they could do by throwing water on her face, she came not to her self, they therefore sent for the Emperours Physitians, who being come and having felt her pulse concluded that she was dead. The

 Senate was advertised hereof, but none could Ima∣gine that any trouble of mind though never so sud∣den could have the power to kill, for that griefs though never so great, have not the porwer to op∣press & suffocate the vitall spirits as an excess of joy. And therefore searching very dilligently over all the body of the Empress to see if they could find how she came by her death, they found nothing but a scratch which the bodkin had made on her fing∣er, which gave little light to the Physitians, they Judging it to be impossible that so little a scratch should cause her death, in regard they could not find that it was envenomed: In fine one of the Physitians observing a little blood to be under the Empresses left brest, he put his finger there and feeling some∣thing hard, he pressed his finger so that he felt the bodkin, which being pluck'd out did plainly shew how it had happened. Which being reported to the Emperour, he was at first much moved; Yet however being unwilling to hinder the course of justice, he referred to the Senate to do what they thought fit to the body of the Empress; consider∣ing the great Felony which she endeavoured to commit to the Emperour, and the Treason which she had contrived against the life of the Inno∣cent 
Erastus:
 But the young Prince who above all things abhorred cruelty and vengance, seeing his in∣nocence fully and entirely justified to all the world, which was the only thing he desired, would in no wise permit that any shame should be done to the bo∣dy of the Empress, this he easily obtained both of the Emperour and Senate to the content of all; so that her Funerall was c
lebrated, as belonged to an

 Empress as may be seen by the sumptuous Tomb that was made for her, which remaineth to this day, where the Emperor caused an Epitaph to be ingraved which in few lines contains the whole matter, which is more amply specified in the Histories and Chroni∣cles of the 
Romans.
 The Emperor 
Dioclesian
 whether out of grief or otherwise, did not long out live his wife, having first elected his Son for his Copartner and successor, who being come to the Empire chang∣ed his name, governing his estates for a time with much prudence, according to the great wisdom where∣with he was endowed, and yet notwitstanding all his judgement he could not keep himself from giving too much credit to the speeches of his malignant wife; although the Plots and contrivances which women had contrived against him, should have fore-warned him; but it is very difficult to avoid that which the Heavens have determined, and since both the one and the other History have seemed to me worthy of me∣mory, I have committed them to writing for the profit of posterity.


This i
 the conclusion of the History of the Prince 
Erastus,
 and his seven wise Masters, as I have transla∣ted it from the Originals, 
Italian
 and 
french:
 but in an old English book it is very different, as well in se∣veral places as I have already recited, as also in the conclusion, being the manner of the Empresses death, which is thus related.


The eighth day being come wherein the Prince re∣solved to be no longer silent, but speak in his own defence, and acq
ainting his Keepers with his in∣tention,

 he was carried before the Emperor and Se∣nate, after due reverence to his Father, and excuses he gives his reasons for his silence, and for a proof of his innocence of what the Empress had charged him with, he chargeth her with incontinence and a∣dultery, and the Empress and her Damsels being sent for at the Princes request, one of the supposed Dam∣sels being stripped naked before the Court, proves to be a man so disguised, with whom the Empress was used to accompany and often lye, this being a certain proof of the Empresses guilt. The Emperor commanded that both she and the Ribauld her com∣panion should be immeadiately burnt: but the Son de∣sired him to forbear judgement till she were reproved for her fact. The Emp
ror then committed the full judgement to his Son, who particularly related how things had passed between him and the Empress, she seeing her wickedness discovered, fell at the Em∣perors Feet, and crying for mercy, but he wholly re∣fused her, relating the haniousness of the crimes which she was not able to deny; wherefore the Son demanding justice of the Judges and Justices, they pronounced this Sentence against her, that she should be bound to a horses tail, and drawn through all the streets of the City, to the place of Execution and there burnt; And that the Ribauld should be quartered and his flesh cast to the Hounds, and Birds of the Aire to devoure him, and this was executed upon them.


This is the Conclusion of the Empress as it is related in that former Book, now the Reader having read what both conclude, are left at liberty to believe which they please; and thus have I given

 you a full and particular account of all that I can find Written in any Language, of this Prince 
E∣rastus
 and those Famous Philosophers the Seven Wise Masters of 
Rome.
