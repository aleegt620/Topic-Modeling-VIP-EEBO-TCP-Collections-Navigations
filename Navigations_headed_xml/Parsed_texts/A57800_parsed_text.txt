TO THE READER.


NOT to cheat thee with a Preface instead of a Book, nor make this Brat of my own Brain such a Rickety Crea∣ture, as to have its Head bigger than all the rest of the Body, both middle and t'other end; I'll only dispatch a little ne∣cessary business, and then Gentlemen step in and take your Places: Or to be a little more Heroical, the Musick has played the last time, the Candles are all Snuffed, and the Curtain is just about to be drawn up.—Know ye, first and foremost, that the Name of this following Play relates to another part yet to come, which will more signally fill the Title; though this has enough of the 
Royal Voyage
 in it to make that good and proper in this, as well as the other. The 
Con∣quest of Granada
 is only begun in the first part, nay, no more than the Siege on't, yet the propriety of the Title none ever questioned to that part as well as the other.


The next thing I'm to do you, to wit, is, that the 
End
 of this Play is chiefly to expose the Perfidious, Base, Cowardly, Bloody Na∣ture of the 
Irish,
 both in this and all past Ages, especially to give as lively a Scheme as will consist with what's past, so far of the worse than Heathenish Barbarities committed by them on their Peaceable British Neighbours, in that Bloody and Detestable Massacre and Rebellion of 
Forty One,
 which will make the Nation stink as long as there's one Bog or Bog-trotter left in it.


Wherein, though every one knows this way of Writing al∣lows great Liberty; I protest 'twas impossible to invent more dread∣ful things than I found ready to my Hand; nay scarce could a single circumstance be any where added to set their Murders in a better

Light,—the Instances themselves, as History gives 'em, being such glaring ones, that Hell-Fire itself could scarce make 'em brighter. Nor even here have I taken any thing for granted, though there's so much abundant Evidence of the truth of all here asserted, even from the acknowledgment of some more ingenuous among 'em, 
Beling, Walsh,
 &c. of their own Writers, and from the Pride and glory which others of them take in relating what then happened, instead of those few Hundred Thousands Murder'd, only wishing that All had gon the same way; but dropping that advantage, have confined my self even to the Chastness of an Historian, examining as the Reader will find, all the material Objections those wicked People can make to our Accusations, and all those thin Excuses where∣with they generally impose upon the Ignorant, and in vain en∣deavour to palliate their unheard of Inhumanities. I am confident I have herein done 'em Justice, and urged their Arguments as far and as home, perhaps closer, than any of them could have done for themselves. And if I have made one Exception from the general Rule, and introduced one Irishman amongst 'em all, brave and ho∣nest (as far as his Cause would let him be,) to foil the rest; if I have gone a little beyond the Pale, and left Truth behind me, 'tis a pardonable fault, and the more easily, because perhaps it mayn't be so common to err on the side of Good-nature. In his Character it's indeed designed to shew that there may possibly be some Individuals among 'em better than the rest of the Nation.—In that of all the rest, that if such a thing happens, 'tis but a chance, and won't often be brought into Example by the others. After all, let any Man take the pains but to read the Irish Histories, Foreigners as well as others, nay their own too, if he has any patience, into the bargain, and if he does not confess that I have not, nay cannot misrepresent the 
Irish,
 when I speak any thing ill of 'em, I'll be content to be sent over in∣to that blessed Island, and live there 'till I've forgot my Mother Tongue, and grow as Irish as 
O Hanlan's,
 &c) as their mannerly Proverb has it.)


Tho on t'other side, so far is this piece from any Reflection on the British there, that one main end thereof is to give 'em their due En∣comiums, and just Honour.




In order whereunto, the principal brave Actions performed by them at the wonder of the World, and confusion of their Enemies, under all apparent disadvantages imaginable, Treachery of some, Cowar∣dise of others, want of Necessaries, a numerous well-provided Ar∣my pressing against 'em, are not (as many as could be handsomly brought in here) neglected, tho' the Historical order, unnecessary here, perhaps not observed.


For the manner in which those actions are introduced, 'tis done the most inoffensively that could be possibly contrived; —'tis out of choice that I have named no Persons, unless of the Enemies side. —As all shared in the Danger, so let 'em all in the Glory,—what∣ever parties there might then be, or are since, there shall be none in this Play, but 
English
 and 
Irish.


That the desirable work of their entire Conquest may soon be ac∣complished, which all 
Europe
 as well as 
England
 groans for, the Second part of this Drama really acted, and our glorious King 
William
 there conquering all our Enemies, I am sure every honest Man wishes as heartily as I do; — for those who hope the contrary, tho' their own Countries, 
Europe
's, and Religion's implacable Enemies, I'd wish 'em no greater plague, than possessed with all the Rage, Ma∣lice, and defeated desperate Wickedness of an Irish-man, to stand by and see our great victorious Prince enter Triumphantly into his Royal City of 
Dublin,
 — which a few Weeks may in all fair pro∣bability produce, and a few more the 
Second Part
 of the 
Royal Voyage,
 or 
Irish Expedition.

ACT I. SCENE I. DUBLIN-
Castle.


[
Enter
 Tyrconnel, Nugent, Neagle, Mac-carty, Hamilton, 
the titula Archbishop of
 Cashell, 
and Primate;
 Irish 
Lords.




Tyrcon.


THus far the 
CAƲSE
 has with Success been crown'd;


And Great St. 
Patrick
 blest his sacred Ground;


Has been his own lov'd Country-men's Defence,


And chac'd the English Toads and Serpents hence.


Again shall 
Ireland
 her old Name renew;


'Tis now a 
Land of Saints
 and Heroes too;


Th' 
Asylum
 long before design'd for those


Sent into Exile by their faithless Foes;


That safe, that happy Sanctuary, where


By our great 
Faith's Defenders
 pious Care,


The Church it self can now glad Refuge find,


Leaving her cheated desperate Foes behind.


Cash
 Like 
Arethusas
's Stream, her Fountain clear


Dives under Earth, and Sea, and rises here:




But never shall we her fair Spring restore,


As pure and limpid as it was before,


Unless we hollow the polluted Flood,


And purge out Heretick-Stains with Hereticks Blood.






Prim.


The very thought does my chill Age renew,


And almost make 
Armagh
 a Souldier too.


O 
Portendown!
 that happy Day is past;


Grief
 stays too long, and 
Pleasure
 runs too fast:


I saw, and 'twas a wisht, a welcome sight


As e'er was shewn: By Heavens bright burning Light,


I saw the wandring Flood new-blacken'd o'er,


And shoals of Bodies washed down the shore,


Whilst fresh Supplies still o'er the Breach were thrown,


'Till there at last was hardly room to drown.






Macar.


And thinks your Grace this was a sight so proper,


For one whose Character shou'd be Compassion,


Pity, and Love, all like our mighty Maker?


I, though long steel'd in Camps, and drench'd in War,


To Execution us'd, and Blood, and Carnage,


(Fatal Effects of necessary Cruelty)


I
 rather shou'd have wish'd to have given the Lives


To all those Wretches, though at the expence


Even of my own.






Prim.


—Are you a Catholick?






Maccar.


Yes, and will die one. —But cou'd 
I
 believe


That my Religion taught the same that you do,


I
 rather wou'd turn Heretick, Turk, or Pagan,


Than be so one hour longer.






Prim.


Scarce can the stupid Ignorance excuse you;


A Heretick himself could say no more.


Hath not the sacred 
Lateran
 Council made it


An Article as needful to Salvation,


As any of the 
Creed,
 That this curst Fry,


Rebels to 
Holy Church,
 shou'd be destroy'd


By Fire and Sword, or any other way,


Where-e'er they'r found, like other Beasts of Prey?




While that of 
Constance
 makes this other easie,


And bids us keep no Faith with those that have none:


A pious, necessary, useful, comfortable Doctrine!


You are a Souldier—'Tis a Stratagem:


Those still in War are lawful —And I'll tell you


Once more, If this you know not, Sir, you'r guilty


Of Ignorance inexcusable—. Why 'tis


The very Cement of the 
CAƲSE,
 the 
Blood,
 the 
Life


Of 
Holy Mother:
 (Yet you are to learn


Your Catechise.) —'Tis what her eldest Son


Has practised many Years. See how he's blest,


How all succeeds. and he speaks Fate in 
Europe.


If this you know, as how can you be ignorant


Of what each Catholick, especially


Each 
IRISH
-Man sucks with his first-drawn Milk.


(Whoever here of all your Country-men,


Besides that false Apostate Wretch 
Clanrickard,


Was guilty known, of such an easie Meanness)


Repent, or else expect the 
Church
's CURSE.


The heavy Doom that waits; for by her Laws


Your 
ipso facto
 Excommunicate.






Tyrcon.


My Lord, 'tis not a time for these Discourses:


Though his weak Conscience cannot yet digest


Such manly Food, we know he's firm to th' Cause;


Brave! and wou'd freely lose a Life i'th' Quarrel:


Rather let's 
think,
 and, with united Councels,


Consider what we've done, and where we are.






Nug.


Think?
 What have we to think of? First let's act;


'Tis time enough to 
think
 when that is done:


'Tis a plain 
Imposition
 on our Natives.


To fall on such unnecessary Work:


We have an Hundred Thousand Men in Arms;


None but the wretched Relies of Rebellion,


That dare withstand us here: Let's o'er to 
England,


That golden Land, where Palms and Laurels wait us,


Delicious Murthers, and sweet Massacres:




Hang, Drown, Stab, Burn, B
oil, Eat, Damn
 our proud Conquerors.






Neag.


That will do well; 'tis excellently motion'd;


What brave 
Milesan
 wou'd not stake his Soul


On the 
Design?
 But first let's clear our own,


Ere we attempt on others Lands. Those Relies


You talk of, are like Vipers Spawn, if not


Crusht speedily, in time they'll grow too sturdy,


And send their Venome hissing o'er the 
Island:


First send 
fair Words, good Terms, sweet-honied Proffers,


(Which we know how to keep) clear once the 
North,


Derry,
 and 
Inniskilling,
 all's our own:


Give 'em what Articles they please themselves,


Promises cost not much; they may believe;


The 
English
 all are kind-believing FOOLS,


Or now had been our Masters: If this takes,


We have our Men, and vain Expence of Blood,


For better Purposes.






1. 
Irish Lord.


Wou'd that were over;


I'd be content, cou'd we secure our own;


Nor ever much ambition'd Foreign Conquests:


The 
English
 sooner 
Cheated
 are, than 
Beaten;


We must expect a formidable Army


Shortly in our Bowels: Though their Hands


Are raising long, they generally fall heavy.






2. 
Lord.


My Lord, 
I
 must entirely join with you;


We owe our 
Safety
 to their 
Easiness:


Had they not kindly thought we wou'd come over,


And yield the Sword, entreating they'd accept


That, and our Lives; we scarec had now been talking


How we shou'd conquer them: And, to say truth,


That was a Master-piece of 
Irish
 Cunning,


To drill 'em on with Promises and Oaths


Of free submission, when they'd please to take it,


Till we were able to laugh at 'em, and


Despise their Threatnings. 
I
 own 'twas justly managed,




And very pleasantly was that fine Fool


Entrapt, who promis'd 
England
 such Success,


Such Mountains of Foreign Hopes from Secret Treaties,


The end too crown'd the Work: When he perceiv'd


We were not quite so good to keep our Words


The Generous Fool dispatch'd himself for Shame,


To be out-witted by an 
Irish
 Man:


And heartily I wish, as any here,


The Frolick would go round, till we possess'd


Their Vacant Hives, without the toyl of Firing


The Drones away; (tho' then we lost the Pleasure


Of Killing, and the Lechery of Murder;)


But Since they won't go on in a good Work,


We must take Care to keep secure, by 
force,


What we by 
Art
 have won; First, clear those Garrisons;


(Talk'd of, perhaps, more easily then done;)


Secure the Country next from Rapparees,


Who else will soon destroy the breed of Cattle,


And bring a Famine, spite of all our plenty,


That done, a Magazeen of Arms sufficient,


Provision too, against what casually


May happen, and that certain Desolation


Armies and War bring with 'em; then we may


Think on the other Projects.






Prim.


A Curse on this Luke-warmness, in the Cause,


It ruines all; Was't not these Noble Lords,


These Valiant Heroes, who (in Council) pressed


To have the Prince Proclaim'd?






1st. 
L.


Yes, and we judged,


We then had Reason; had not first the King


Both quitted 
England,
 and obliged his Subjects,


Armies, Commanders, Officers and Garrisons,


To yield to 
Orange?
 Did not a sure Friend


(As some we still have there) send us a Pacquet,


Advising this, and his departure following,




We knew not where? Shou'd all have been exposed


To a Head-strong, Wild, Ungovernable Rabble?






Tyrc.


No more my Lords, the Case is alter'd since,


And we have Arms from 
France,
 whose generous Prince,


Delight of all Mankind, with pious Care,


Our Royal Refuge has welcom'd there:


Strong Succours thence we wait, nor shall we fail,


The Catholick Cause, with them, must needs prevail;


The while, my Lords, we all must rest content,


The Fate of War there's nothing can prevent;


Disorders make the Souldiers brave and bold,


You break him if too close the Reins you hold;


Besides, our Troops on nothing else can live;


But what our vanquish'd Slaves Estates can give;


When they are humbled, and their stock brought low;


For theirs, we need not doubt, the first will go,


'Twill then, be time, my Lords! to think on you.


Be you, and your Estates, our chiefest Care,


On pain of Death they shall your Fields forbear;


But first, the Northern Rebels let's subdue,


At 
Derry,
 and at 
Inniskilling
 too;


The First your Lot

[to 
Hamilt.
]
 The Second fall to you,

[to 
Mac.
]






Hamilt.


My Lord I doubt not, speedily to give


A better Account of them, then ere to 
England


Of my Wise Errand hither; nor was ought


Lost, by my not returning, but my Word,


A few loose Vows, perhap an Oath or Two,


And Airy Honour pawn'd; let 'em make much on't,


And seize those precious Pledges for my stay,


While with this Sword, I th'Obligation pay;


And hasten to my welcome Charge, away.




Exit Hamilton.




Mac.


I cannot promise much, our Troops are raw,


Have seen no Enemy, if Disciplin'd


For a few Months, yet grown by their late Freedom


Glaggard and Wild, Unruly, Careless, Vain;




The Enemy Desperate, Numerous, Firm and Hearty,


But what I can perform, in Act or Council,


Whether by Expedition or Surprize,


If they too heedless, as they often are;


Or by fair fighting, if they stand the Field;


Or formal Siege, if they still keep the Town,


I will attempt, and do, if Fate play fair,


Or leave my Life behind.






Tyrcon.


We know you Sir,


Your Courage and your Conduct, take the best


Of all our Troops; proceed, success attend you,


While we go order your Dispatch, and send


Once more to th' Rebels, if fair means avail,


And save our Troubles, and their own Destruction.




Exeunt Omnes.






ACT. I. SCENE. II.


[
Enter
 Irish Rabble, 
Men, Woman and Children; the Men with Swords and Clubs, the Women with Skenes, the Children with wooden Swords and Knives. A
 Piper 
before 'em (as was their usual Custom) with a Prey of
 Black and small Cattle, 
which they had robbed the
 English 
of.
)




[1st 
o'th' Rabble.
]


Rare times, by Saint 
Patrick;
 the best that 
Ire∣land
 ever saw, by my Soul Joy; why who wou'd be at the Trouble to raise and breed Cattle of their own, when the 
Heretick Dogs
 can do't to our Hands, without any pain?






2. —


Right Neighbour 
Teague;
 and besides they are all our 
Te∣nants,
 not we 
Theirs;
 for 
I
 heard 
Father Dominick, our Priest,
 make a Swear, that this was all our Country, Five Thousand Years before the 
New-Moon
 was made, and the 
English
 Thieves never came hither to rob us of our own till the next Year after the Flood was over.








3. —


Well, See what 'tis to have Learning; they must talk what they will, but if 
I
 know any thing, there's ne'r a Clergy, in Christendom to compare with the 
Irish;
 only the Truth is, they do lead a stray a Cheese, or a Flitch of Bacon, now and then; and sometimes the Bottle of 
Ʋsquebagh
 straggles after it. But all that's as easily forgiven as they do us, since they have so kindly prov'd the Lawfulness and Necessity of our plundering the 
English,
 their Snacks always reserved and reason good.






4. —


But to see how stubborn and impudent some of these Pro∣testant Devils are; 
I
 went to one of 'em that had been once my Ma∣ster, (tho' now the Case is alter'd), and bid him give me a Cow; the impudent Pascal denied it to my Face, which so much provok'd me, as well it might, 
I
 had stuck my Skene in his Guts, had not some other of his Crew hindred me. who are all since fled together, to the Northern Rebels, where 
I
 hope, shortly, to have the hanging of Two or Three Dozen of 'em.






1. —


They are e'n too kindly used, that makes 'em so malepert, what would they be Angels? Would they have more than their Lives? Unconscionable Dogs; their Brains deserved to be knock'd out if 'twere for no other Reason.






2 —


Ay, That's the only way, after all. Ah Neighbours! had you seen, but what 
I
 ha' seen; we have made some sport on't for∣merly, but now this Foolish pity spoils all. If you had but heard how the Hereticks yelp'd, when we burnt a Hundred of them in a House together. Oh! 
I
 cou'd have humour'd it to the Life then; but now 
I
 grow hoarse, and have almost forgot it; 
I
 remember there was one sprawling Brat, of a Year or Two Old, that the Mother on't, or some body, had thrust out to save its Life; but how we all laugh'd when one of our Company stuck it a top of his Pike, to see the little Bastard sprawl about with his Legs and Arms, till he pitch'd it over again into the Fire, and made an end on't.






3. —


What's that to the Invention of my Old Grand-Mother, rest her Soul, tho her Body was hang'd for't: My Father had ripp'd up Two or Three fat Persons Bellies, and the good saving Creature, finding they tallowed well, took out their Grease, and made Can∣dles of it: But never was a pleasanter sight, than to see how it dripp'd

in the Candle-stick, as if they had been sweating at it in their Pul∣pit agen.






5 —


That was nothing neither, to what work we made with one of 'em; we ripp'd up his Belly, and tied one end of his small Guts to a Tree, driving him round till he had pull'd 'em all out, and then knock'd him o'th' Head, and with our common Farewel, tho' to good for 'em, sent his 
Soul to the Devil.






2. —


Ha, ha, ha! That was pretty well; but I think our Town was even with you; we had kill'd about Twenty, or some such small Business, of 
English
 Whores, and afterwards finding one of their Brats, in a Cradle, bawling for Meat, took it out, and put it to the Breast of the dead Jade his Mother, bidding the young Bastard suck if't had any mind to't, and there left it for the Dogs to eat them to∣gether.






4. —


All in good time, we may yet serve 'em the same sawce. In the mean while, let's be reveng'd on any thing that belongs to their Country. Their Lubberly Breed of Black-Cattle here, what shall we do with 'em all? We'll find some way or other to torment, as well as get rid of 'em, and they'll have little Cause to complain, that are used as well as their Masters.






2. —


Let's serve 'em as we did the Fellow, I told you of, Tie 'em to a Stake, and cut off pieces of their Flesh alive; by this we shall have the double Pleasure of tormenting 'em, and seeing how finely they'll dance and roar to make us Musick.






1. —


By Saint 
Pautrick,
 but that be a very good way, Joy! Agreed; all Hands to work here. What, Do these hang an Arse, and pretend to be Refractory, as well as their Masters? There, — this is fast enough: Come, — First let's have a Song, and then fall on, at the Word of Gommand.




[They Sing an 
Irish
 Song, Dancing round a fat 
English
 Ox, ti∣ed to a Stake; and as soon as that was over, fall all together upon it, cutting out pieces of them alive, and broiling it upon the Coals. In the mean while, a small Party of 
English,
 surprize, and fall upon 'em; on which, all the Rabble set up the 
Irish
 yell, and run away without striking a stroke.]






1. 
Englishman.


A Soul-less heap of Animals! that Nobler Beast


They here torment, has infinite more Valour,


Than all their Rascal Nation, piled together.






2. —


Are these the Champions, these the Stil-Cow Heroes,


Must Conquer 
England?
 Sure 'twould be a Problem


Well worth resolving; How many of 'em


Must go to killing one of us: I shou'd


Be flatter'd to esteem my Self immortal,


Had I a Lease of Life, till they cou'd take it.






3. —


Slaves! long-worn Slaves, and Ten times baffled Rebels,


Were one poor 
English-man
 (design'd by Fate,


By Courage, Earth, and Heaven it self their Master)


Tied to a Post, as this poor Beast before us,


Among a Thousand of those Cut-Throat Monsters


Were but his Face uncover'd, cou'd they see him


See but their Master, sure they scarce dar'd stab him.


I question'd if the Cowards would not tremble,


Until their bloody Baggonets forsook


Their Guilty Hands.






4. —


No Sir, you are mistaken,


Then is their very time; or then or never;


Unless, when loaded with base Multitude;


And rather press'd to Death, than fairly kill'd.


They can't so much as Murder one of ours.


O they are bold as Lions, rather Wolves,


When they on helpless 
Women
 light, or 
Children,


Or Men unarm'd, helpless, and weak, as they.






2. —


But lest we meet, the Fate which oft has happen'd


To our brave Countrymen, and fall a Prey,


Born down and trodden with inglorious Numbers;


Let's cut our way to 
Derry,
 for this part


O'th' Country's all their own; but there 'tis said


They stem the Fide, already shut the Gate


Against their Troops.






1. —


Fair Fortune still attend 'em,


And Crown their Courage with well purchased Lawrels,




Whilst to their Succour, and our own we flie,


And bravely conquer, or as bravely die.




[Exeunt Omnes.]






ACT I. SCENE III.


Enter
 Tyrconnel, 
the
 Primate, Cashel, Nugent, Neagle.




Neag.


How tame the harmless Sheep convey'd himself


To a safe Prison! O 'twas a wise Message,


To ask leave to bestow so large a Kingdom,


Almost for less than asking. Thoughtless 
Mountjoy,


Whose Embassy, no doubt, is kindly taken;


Thy self for more Magnificence and Grandeur,


In highest State art lodg'd at the 
Bastile.






Tyrc.


Chiefly to you we owe that piece of Policy,


Nor shall it fail Reward: He need not fear


A kind Reception, when so true a Friend


As 
Rice
 goes with him; but we must have News,


The Wind stands fair from 
Brest,
 and they must needs


Be long ere this arriv'd.






Cash.


Sure the very Thoughts of our admired, adored, true Cath. K.


Thus honouring this lov'd Country, with his Presence,


Will make us all invincible.






Prim.


Then shall the Rebels know what 'tis to affront him;


'Tis their turn now. The 
English
 are the Rebels,


And we their Rightful, Loyal, conquering Masters.






Tyrc.


And have a Title that's uncontroverted,


A Hundred Thousand Men besides the King;


And who dares call him Rebel that has either


Of these Two Glorious Helpers to his Cause?






Cash.


The very Name of one so much belov'd,


So long desired by all our Country-men,




And justly, for as much he honours them


With his kind Thoughts,—his single Name wou'd do,


Without an Army, and inspire new Courage


If any wanted it—'twas he alone,


Who thro' the last false dangerous Trimming Reign,


Screen'd off the fury of the Rebels from us;


Got that proud Heretick, imperious 
Ormond,


Oftner than once remov'd. 'Twas he who found


The Treacherous 
Essex,
 who buoyed up the 
English,


And their decaying Interests against us.


He found him out at last, spite of his Policy,


And did reward him in due time and place.


—But when kind Fate, or of her own accord;


Or jogg'd by some Officious Catholick Hand,


Broke 
Charles
 his Linsy-Woolsey Line of Life,


When our bright Star ascended his Meridian,


And shot his Beams from 
London
 to our Isle,


What Loyal Face was seen without a smile?


Scarce will our Joy, or Juster, be or more,


When with his Royal Feet, he treads our Shore.






Tyrc.


Be it our Care, the while t' amuse the People,


Persuade 'em he's arriv'd already her;


This will affright the 
English,
 if they'd stir,


And raise the Courage of our Country-men.


Were we not Politicians, things exempt


From the dull common road of Just and Right,


In which the World drudge on; yet our Religion


Permits, nay, does encourage such a Lye


As serves the Church, and that no doubt's wrapt up


Together, with our Cause, and stands or falls,


As we do here.




[Enter Servants.]
 A Courier wants Admittance to your Excellency.




Tyrcon.


Go fetch him in.






Courier.


These from 
Versailles,
 my Lord, some few days since.




[Delivers Letters.]
 From the King's Royal Hand I did receive 'em.






Tyrcon.


Say, How was his Reception and Attendance


In that great Court?






Cour.


Magnificent and Royal;


Shou'd he return a 
Conqueror
 to 
London,


Scarce cou'd the Pomp be greater. Guards were sent


To attend him on the Road; a fair Retinue


Of young Nobility soon found to wait him:


And when he came, we scarce knew which was King.






Cash.


were any Preparations going forward


For his appearing here?






Cour.


All that was possible;


And the Great 
LEWIS
 swore to all his Court,


If any wou'd almost 
Oblige
 their Prince,


'Twou'd be by waiting on the 
ROYAL EXILE,


Vent'ring their Lives on one joint Stock with HIS.


A Squadron was equipp'd at 
Brest,
 as 
I


Came through the Harbour, all prepared, and ready


To attend him thither.






Tyrcon.


His Letter speaks as much;

Having read the Pacqu


Ere this time he's embarked, the Wind stands fair;


And large Supplies of Money, and of Men,


Will with him soon be here, (if it were possible)


To inspire more Life into our vigorous Cause.






Nug.


And shall we be too merciful and tender,


And ruine all agen, as once before?






Prim.


Then we deserve to fall unpitied too,


Pointed and laugh'd by each zealous Catholick,


The Scorn of every Heretick in 
Europe:


No; had good Counsel been but follow'd, when


We last appeared for the same noble Cause.


Had those who safely then advised 
Kill All.


Been hearken'd to, we'd long ere this been Masters,


And 
Ireland
 full as Catholick as 
Spain.


But O this easie, foolish, cruel Pity!


This Ague of Mankind, far worse than Fear!


This Palsie of the Soul, which makes it tremble,




When ought that's Daring calls ir out to act!


Others there were, forsooth, for gentler Methods


For 
Speeding;
 none but such as die resist:


And thus the Matter hung, 'till 'twas resolv'd


All shou'd be left at liberty; Or kill,


Or save alive, as Bravery or Weakness


Shou'd prompt 'em; and we since have felt the Event;


We did 
Our Business
 by not doing 
Theirs:


The safer wiser, much more Catholick Way,


Had been on highest pain of 
Church
's 
Thunder,


Incurring greater Excommunication


As after; though too late we did at 
James-Town,


And soon blew Mighty 
Ormond
 from the Kingdom;


Nor valu'd his Commission from his Master,


Since both were Hereticks: On all the Pains


Of this and t'other World, (for both do well together)


To have forbid all Quarter; Children, Women,


And all their cursed Brood one Sacrifice.


We now have one Throw more; if that we lose,


Farewel for ever.






Neag.


Stay for the Bear's Skin;


Secure the 
Dam,
 or we ne'er get the 
Cubs:


Derry
 and 
Inniskilling
 once our own,


All is so; then we may have all our Wishes.


(Enter Courier.)
 Here comes a Face of News; let's have it speedily.






Cour.


The King is safely landed at 
Kingsale,


And comes directly hither: All the Country


Roll after him: We ne'er cou'd want Arms,


Had we none Listed.






Tyrcon.


Ring the Bells; let Bonfires,


Illuminations, all the Expressions possible


Of Joy be made; the Conduit fill with Claret,


(Another Liquor, though of the same Colour


Much nobler were) Draw up the the Guards in readiness;


Let th' Aldermen be ready in their Robes.






Cour.


'Tis done already; all is freely done,




And more, as I came by and told the News:


For very Joy, the 
English Dogs
 are plunder'd


Of all they have; their Houses Bonfires made;


Well if they 'scape Themselves.






Prim.


'Tis rarely well—O this dear pious Rabble!


Honest plain-hearted People! How I love 'em!


My very Soul seems of a piece with theirs:


Here's no Dissimulation; that I hate;


No mincing o'er the Business; but plain-dealing,


Without the curst Disguise of 
Policy,


The odious luke-warm Temper dresses in.






Cour.


As he in highest Pomp past through 
Killkenny,


The Elegant 
Recorder
 made a Speech,


Which 
Tully
 could not mend; scarce equal it:


I have a Copy here.






Cash.


Let's see it immediately.




Cashel
 Reads.




May it please Your most sacred Majesty,


If ever Rain was welcome to the thirsty Earth, the Sun to fro∣zen 
Greenland,
 or Bonny-clabber to the gaping Jaws of an hungry 
Irish
-man, your Majesty is welcome, trebly welcome, to this your LOYAL Kingdom. 'Twould be time vainly spent, to inform a Person so well read, so deeply skill'd in Books and History, as your Majesty, how many thousand thousand Years your Majesty's Royal Ancestors have Sway'd the Scepter of this 
Blessed Island.
 In the thirty three thousandth Year, it was precisely of 
Plato
's great Circle, when your Progenitors first landed here, as we find atte∣sted in the most Authentick Chronicles of this our ancient Nation: Nor was it many Thousands after, ere we made a Descent into 
Scotland,
 routed the heretical Kirk there, planted by 
Cain
's great Grandson, and establish'd the primitive Catholick Religion, which has remain'd unto this day, among the civil 
Highlanders
 there, as

well as in this your no less Accomplished Kingdom. We must take leave to protest, We can hardly be sorry that the rebellious Here∣ticks of your Neighbour-Nation, have given us so splendid an oc∣casion of letting your Majesty see our Loyalty, and they feel our our Valour. Now is the time, or very near is it approaching, when your rebellious 
Exeter,
 your fanatical 
Bristol,
 your treache∣rous 
York,
 and your ungrateful 
London,
 and all the other little Hamlets there, shall fly before the conquering Arms of your Loyal 
Dublin,
 and ever-renowned 
Kilkenny,
 when in the midst of the loud Acclamations of the heroical 
Irish,
 and Curses of your grovling Rebels, we re-seat you in the ancient 
Throne,
 with as much Glory as ever you left it.




Dixi.




Prim.


Who now dares say our Country-men are Blockheads?


Here is a Speech almost worth Paradise.


Turning to
 Nugent.


Scace that, my Lord, you spake at Council-
Table,


When one of our Embassadors at 
London,


So highly admired, that as 
I
 oft have heard,


The very Boys, though Spawn of Hereticks,


Ran by your Coach, and clapt you as you went;


Scarce that cou'd this exceed.






Nugent.


My Lord 
I
 own it:


And more, he has himself out-done, as well


As we; and were it possible, done right


Unto the great Occasion.






Tyrcon.


We've now to time to spend in such Discourses;


The King himself in a few hours sees 
Dublin:


Each moment 
I
 expect a Post from the North;


And cou'd we but present him with the News,


As 
I
 much hope, that those two stubborn 
Towns,


Are in our hands, 'twou'd be a grateful Welcome.






Nug.


More grateful News that Messenger would tell,


Who brought Advice,


That they and all within 'em sunk to Hell.














ACT II. SCENE I. 
INNISKILLING.


Enter the Governour, two Collonels, Captains,
 &c.




Governour.


NOw for our Honour, Country, and our Lives,


And more than all, the Protestant Religion.


All beckon out the brave — this World and t'other,


Courage and Nature, all that's dear and sacred,


Both warrant and oblige Resistance here.


Be Slaves to th' 
Irish,
 such as have been ours,


Almost beyond the reach of Chronicle;


So long 'till 'tis at last as much their Nature,


As Falshood, Cowardice and Cruelty!


So long, they 
dare
 not sure be otherwise;


And 'twas indeed their choice, their backs were made for't,


Their Souls just of a 
size
 and 
bore
 that spoke 'em


What they have spoke themselves — yet when we found 'em,


(Call'd over by themselves under our 
Henry
)


Bruitishly base as Nature made or Hell


Reform'd 'em, sunk in sins too black to name,


Murders as common as Adulteries,


Incests or Rapes — no sence of just or right,


No Law, no Faith, no Truth, no Manners left.


When thus we found 'em, only at first content


With some few Castles there, we those reliev'd,


Who begg'd our aid, and peaceably still liv'd,


'Till what so fair we bought they'd have retain:


With Treachery, Perj
ry, Blood-shed, they began,


Nor have degenerated — when our own Defence


Forc'd us to Arms, when Strong bow, 
Courcy, Lacy,


(Only two mighty Names) i'th' Chance of War,


Obtain'd whole Counties from 'em, or indeed




From Wolves and Bogs, and Fastnesses and Woods;


And our great 
Henry
 with a Royal Army


The Conquest perfected — we found 'em savage,


But left 'em Men — or wou'd at least have done it,


Had they consented, as they feign'd to do.


They flunk and ran, and truckled to their Conqu'ror,


They kneel'd, and crouch'd, and fawn'd, and lickt his Feet.


He gave 'em Life, and more, he gave 'em Laws,


Redeem'd 'em from themselves and one another,


Whose only rule before was Brutal Force,


And when they all had sworn perpetual Fealty,


Restor'd their Countrey better than before.






1. 
Coll.


Oft have we read the Story, oft have wonder'd


At this repeated Treachery and Blood;


Until so oft repeated, 'twas no wonder


They never injur'd us, but when we trusted


To their good Nature, Vows, or slight-spun Oaths,


Snapt easily as weak 
Arachne
's thred.






2. 
Coll.


'Tis hard that these at last must be our Masters —


Nor shall they be, while we have Hands or Swords,


Nay, Teeth or Nails — (weapons to fight with Beasts)


O 'tis transporting Pleasure thus to dye,


Rather than live Slaves to the insulting 
Irish.






Governour.


Live Slaves to th' 
Irish!
 if some Angel bid us,


I shou'd make bold to question his Commission;


Whom by so many hundred Skirmishes,


So many Battels and almost new Conquests,


After their vain, their fruitless kind Rebellions,


By which their Title they so justly lost


To what remain'd— whom we so oft have broke,


And trod their stubborn necks so oft in dust


At vast expence of English Coin and Blood,


Infinitely more than e're the Island's worth,


— Yet still our fatal Goodness ruin'd all,


Forgiving faster than they could offend,


'Till now we feel our Kindness and their Gratitude,


Almost too late —








1 
Coll.


And yet 'tis not so strange for Brutes to act


As Nature prompts 'em, bite, and snarl, and struggle,


And gnaw their Chain — but that a 
humane Creature,


A 
Man
 should Brutifie so much,


To learn their Manners, eat and drink like they,


And yell, and rove, and sport, nay couple with 'em,


Till they descend, and creep in the same manner;


'Tis strange indeed — Yet thus and worse do those


Who have so long bin conversant among 'em,


'Till what by Meetings, Intermarriages


And Gossippings, they grow as errand 
Irish,


Stark bruitish, mad, wild things as ever howl'd


O're a dead Carkass — For the Wolves and they


With the same Order, self-same Ceremony


And Note, and Tune, over the Dead lament.






Governour.


What Death, what Punishment is equal to


This Sin, this Crime, this worse than bestiality?


— But 'tis too soon or late for such a Question,


This one effort they make, and have pusht home,


To clear the land of their not wish'd Instructors,


And be as barbarous as they were before.


If this they gain not, they are lost for ever,


If this we gain, henceforth 'tis ours for ever.


'Tis true, there's little left, but that's worth keeping.


England
 is still our own, and that brave Prince


Who holds the Crown with strong and rightful hand,


Will not forsake our Interest and his own.


Then happy they who bravely stem the Wave,


'Till he holds out his Hand our sinking Bark to save.






2. 
Coll.


We shall have Storms — the Sea works hard and loud,


The gathering Floods look big, and scowl along


Rolling far off — from all hands we've advice


Macarty
 with the Flower of all their Forces


Approaches hither, and has vow'd to lay


His Bones here, or subdue us.






Governour.


That may be —


For he has Honour, and 'tis not unlikely,




He will do one or t'other — which o'th two


Lies yet in Fates dark womb — Do Heaven its pleasure;


Let's act like Men, and either live or dye so.






2. 
Coll.


They say indeed that Gentleman you named


Is a meer Prodigy of an 
Irish
 man,


A stranger thing than Toad or Serpent were,


That he's both brave and honest in despite


Of his curst Country, and as curst Religion.


And his good natural temper has workt out


The Venom of 'em both — In brief he wants


Only a better Cause and better Master:


Grant him but that and better Souldiers too,


I'd not desire a braver Enemy.






Captain.
 What e're he is, you'll have him quickly here,


As o're the Neighbouring Hills I scowr'd this Morn,


We saw some Troops, which sure cou'd be no other


Than advanc'd Guards to his Army.






Governour.


When he please —


We wou'd not willingly be unprepared


Of kind reception for so great a Stranger.


— Go draw your Forces up under the Walls,


We'll meet, not wait 'em — Captain! be't your care


With a smart flying Party to discover


Once more what Face they bear, and of what number;


(Thô that's the least, we'll fight 'em, thô a Million)


Beware of Ambushes, the Graves o'th' 
English,


Which there have bury'd ten times more than e're


They in fair Battle lost. — Each Man to his Charge.




Exeunt Omnes








ACT II. SCENE II. 
MACARTY
's 
Camp.


Enter
 Macarty, 
Officers, Souldiers, — Exercising.




Macarty.


ARe these the Men design'd to conquer Kingdoms?


The miserable Props of bleeding 
Ireland:


Simplicity and Cowardice mixt in


Such just proportion, none knows which surpasses.


Why must I blame my Countrey-men, yet why


Do they deserve 't? — Were any Cause besides


My King's concern'd, I'd never trust my self


At the Head of 'em — These the best, cull'd Men!


Sure they ne're handled Musquet, Pike or Sword


Before this Expedition — Let's however


See what we must expect — Serjeant, draw out


A File or two, and exercise 'em here.


The Officer draws 'em out, and after the other usu∣al words of Command, bids 'em


Face to the Right!




They all fall into Confusion, some facing one way, some t'other.




Macarty.


O stupid, worse than Beasts — I'll teach my Horse


What is too high for them!


Officer sets 'em in order agen, and then Commands.


To the left!


They fall into the same Confusion they were in before.






Macarty.


I never knew 'em constant but in Mischief,


And there they never fail —


Once more they are reduced, and the Word given.




To the left about!


They all throw down their Arms and run quite away.






Macarty.


There only did they not at all deceive


My Expectations—Shall I rave or pity 'em?


Are these fit men to face well-order'd Troops,


Flesht with Success and a long Train of Victories?


Well Gentlemen,—We must be Sacrific'd,


And that's the worst—We die for a good Master,


For such we ever ought to think our King;


But yet I can't without regret resign


A Life which might with yours have done some Service,


If not Encumber'd with a useless Rabble


Miscall'd an Army.






1. 
Officer.


Twas perhaps chance,


Those Raw, Rude-Fellows lately were drawn out,


The others sure are better, — 'Tis impossible


They shou'd be all so.






Macarty.


One and all I fear,


However, order forth another Party,


And see what they'll do.




The Officer draws out others —Gives the words — They do all well enough till he bids 'em Fire, — one half never does it at all, the other one after another, and most of them wink, and shoot just in one anothers Faces, — at which concluding themselves kill'd, one part drops down, and t'other runs away.




Macarty.


The very Emblem of a Battle this!


And this I expect — they n'ere shall cheat me more.






2. 
Officer.


Tho' they are somewhat inexpert, my Lord,


They may be brave and faithfull when they meet


The Enemy — whom yet they never saw.


There stands a little Castle not far off,


Man'd by some fifty Foot — 'tis Old and Weak,


They've little Ammunition — If on this


We flesht 'em, t'wou'd do well, they'd rowze their Courage,


Which yet has drowsie lain for want of Action.






Macarty.


Tho' but too easily I guess th' Event,


I'll not forebode — and seeing fight we must,




As good begin — Detach 500 Foot,


A Company of Granadeers may joyn 'em;


Sure those will carry't, or the Army won't.


Mean time the rest to Council to resolve,


How we must manage this unlucky business,


And where to most advantage aly our Bones.


Exeunt Omnes








ACT II. SCENE III.


Enter
 3 
or
 4 
Souldiers
 — Mac-Shane, O Donnel, Teigue, 
&c.




Teigue.


BY my Shoul now if ever poor 
Teigue
 saw the like in my Life. Why my Gossip ty'd a Red Ribon about my left hand that I might be sure to know it from my right,— and the Ugly-Dog Rogue of an 
English
 Serjeant bid me turn to the Right, and put me quite out.






Mac-Shane.


But was n't mine Stranger than that too?—may they maak haung upon my Mothers Son if I did did not turn the same way both times, and yet the Churl said I was right the first, and wrong the second time.






O Donnel.


And when he bid us Face about, I thought t'had bin to charge the Enemy — so daring not be out of my Ranks at such a dangerous time, ran back agen to the main Body whence I was drawn.






Teigue.


Upon my Shaulvaashion but so did we too — but had the Rebels bin coming in earnest — wee'd have cut the pittiful Rascals all to pieces. — So, so, — 
Teigue
 wou'd have ript up the Guts of the Hereticks. —


Puls out his Sword and Fences in the Air.


So he would have out his Head off. — and just so, —


Clubs his Musquet.


Just so when he cry for mercy — No 
English
 Dog you — I'll knock out your Brains.


While they are Vaporing and Laughing, Enter the Detach∣ment that went to Storm the Castle, beat in by the
 English,

who Sally'd upon 'em.]






Officer.


They Fought like Devils, and Ours not like men;


Like Women, nay a Child, an 
English
 Boy


Might kill 'em had he but the strength, for they


Make no resistance — once more if you're men


Stand and save all — do but look back and see


Your Enemy. —




[
The
 English 
Enter. The Officer and several Souldiers fall.
 O Donnel 
tumbles among the Slain, and pretends himself Dead.
 Mac Shane 
creeps into a Bush, and
 Teigue 
being the nimblest Footman, runs away (the
 English 
following the Chase,) and Re-enters breathless at the Generals Tent.


Enter
 Macarty, 
Officers,
 Teigue 
looking fearfully over his Shoulder.
 —




Teigue.


O Sir — my Lord—we're lost — St. 
Patrick
 save us!


The Army — oh — the 
English
 Army.






Macarty.


VVhat of them Coward? are they more than men?






Teigue.


Than men Sir — O yes Sir — They have every one of 'em Eyes as big as Sawcers, and spit Fire like Dragons — twenty thousand, O they're here just at the Door, and I'm Dead.






Macarty.


VVhat are they come 
Incognito?
 — VVe must have seen or heard some News what ever 'tis.






Captain.


Go bid my Regiment advance.






Captain.


They're here — and even just there's the Enemy.




Enter the
 English, 
beating in the
 Irish —




Macarty.


Is this the dreadful Army? one poor Company!


VVell-Charge 'em — See if they are all immortal.




They Charge the
 English, 
who still Fighting retreat in good Order, till they regain their Fort.




Macarty.


Farewell Temper! 'Tis beyond the Patience


Not only of a Souldier but a Saint


Patrick
 himself, of whom our holy Fryers


Tell us such holy Lies, wou'd swear to see it;


This half a-handfull to outbrave our Army!


Come on, go off, beat, kill, do what they please! —




O Fate — thou'st cheated me — sure I was mouldie,


To lead such men as those who Conquer mine,


Yes rather had I head one single Troop


Of such as they, than all this Soulless rout!


This Pageant of a War — this Pastbord Army,


Scarce those in musty Arras wove look worse,


Or stand more patient to be cut in pieces:


No, there I wrong'd 'em first — they will not stand,


So fast they run, that Death can scarce o'retake 'em,


Almost outstrip a Bullet in his March,


With Fate and Vengeance wing'd and red Destruction.


VVhy must I bear so many thousand Deaths,


Before the last kind true one gives me Ease,


And sends this rage and shame a passage hence,


Quite crusted round my heart — I'll stay no longer,


If there's a Purgatory sure 'tis here,


Quick, quick, I'll thro' it all and reach my Heaven,


To the Officers.


Go bid the Army March, if they'll obey you,


Mistake not wilfully and run away,


I'll be for 
Inniskilling
 or my Tomb;


—Here call a 
Drummer,
 — Speed him quickly thither,


Carry this Summons to the 
Governour,


Were not my Soveraigns Honour in't concern'd,


Shame wou'd not let me make a proposition


To such as those, to yield to such as ours.


This will, unless I much mistake his temper,


Quickly bring him, and Victory or Death,


Either of which wou'd be so welcome now,


I scarce know which to chuse.




As the Drummer is going out, Enter one from the Out-Guards.




Souldier.


My Lord, we saw the Enemy advancing


On yonder Hill, — and move so fast they must


Be very soon upon us.






Macarty.


Labour saved —


I see there's men of Honour and Civility.




We've yet as much advantage as we'd wish for,


There's not a better spot of Ground in 
Europe


To cool their Courage, — On this little rise


We'll place our Canon, and our last Reserve.


(Speaks to an Officer.)


You 
Colonel,
 Take the Horse, and keep the Causway,


Between the Bogs — And you the Foot dispose


(Speaks to another.)


On either Wing, — Thus planted if they will


But hold their Swords before 'em, 'tis impossible


To lose at least: — And when their Troops are tired,


We may at pleasure fall upon and break 'em,


And once bid fair for Fame. —


[Exeunt Officers.]


Tho' yet I hope not —


Not hope it, — Yes, the man who bravely dies,


In the discharge of whatsoever Post


He's fix'd at, Fames his everlasting portion


What e're he lose, then lets be all — 
Macarty.


— My Soul my thinks expands its self, and greatens


With prospect of near Immortality.


Look down you Holy Forms! who reign above


Where no Contentions dwell, but those of Love.


You Saints, you Heroes all, of whom we're told


You flourish'd here, — And might perhaps of old!


If 'ere 
Macarty
 did an act was base,


Dart all your Thunders in his perjur'd Face;


But if he Vertue and fair Fame pursu'd,


And Ill n'ere chose, unless ith' shape of Good:


If ne're, unless deceiv'd, his Sword was known


To own a Cause which you wou'd blush to own;


Then either aid him with success to day,


Or take at once his Shame and Life away.


His Soul, a Stranger there, a place provide


Among those shining few who bravely dy'd;


Open the Gates, and your kind arms prepare,


They come, they come, you soon will find him there.




Exit to the Battle.








ACT II. SCENE IV.


Both Armies, the
 Irish 
as before, the
 English 
advancing up to the Causway — the Canons play, Trumpets, Drums, Fifes sounding.




Governour.


THere's the Enemy! —






Collonel.


Enough — there needs no Word—


The
 English 
fall on desperately at the Causway — the
 Irish 
receive 'em, and a warm dispute follows.


Macarty 
from the Hill.


They stand! they stand! — Nor yet — nay then I'll hope —


And if they run not, now e'ne beg their Pardon,


And give my self the Lye — There is no way for Foot,


Those Boggs are inaccessible — Let's bring


The Canon once to bear, the Day's our own.


Governour 
to his Soldiers.


How Gentlemen — not Conquer? These are 
Irish,


All errand 
Irish
 — whom as oft yo've baffled


As seen — I know you'll beat, but what's the Reason


You stay so long? — Charge home with the Pikes,


Now — Now or Never —




The Foot receive all the Enemy's Fire, and pass the Boggs to meet 'em, who on the
 Inniskilling 
Mens first Fire retreat in Disorder.




Governour.


St. 
George!
 we've past the Boggs — they run, they run,


And these too bend —






Macarty.


A whole half-hour — 'tis fair,


And more than I in Conscience cou'd expect.






Collonel.


I'll charge my self — the Battel totters,


These may restor't —




To a Collonel and Officers about him.




Coll.


We wait you with our Lives — if not too late,


For the Horse break — and see my Lord — the Devils


Come rolling on in Smoak, and Fire, and Blood,


We yet may fly —






Macarty.


When dead if I get off


That's soon enough — come follow you that Love


Your King or me —






They endeavour to rally the broken Army, the
 English 
come on, take the Cannon, and turn it on the
 Irish; 
some throw themselves into the Bogg, and are knockt on the Head there; others ask Quarter, and throw down their Arms,
 &c.




Macarty.


Rally behind me — once — stand once — but 'till


I've met the Torrent — and then run to Perdition —






Coll.


'Tis vain — they are as deaf as fighting Winds,


A Drove of Sheep as soon will stop their running,


When one leaps first — The Torrent bears us down,


And hurrys us too with 'em to the Wood.


All's lost — yet will your Lordship save your self?






Macarty.


For what — or where — this Army was my Life,


My Spirits — my Blood — 'tis lost, and I'm dead with it,


Let's turn and fall like what we've lived.






Coll.


We cannot, —


Unless we over them or under pass;


And see — already to the Wood we're born,


Driven with the edge of the Multitude


Out of the Tide of Death —






Macarty.


Then let's return to't,


Now 'tis worth stemming — I have lived too long


By half an hour.






Officers.


We'll follow and dye with you.




They make up to a Party of the
 Inniskilling-
men, at whom
 Macarty 
discharges his Pistol, at which they all fire at him, and shoot him down; a Souldier comes up, and Clubs his Musquet to knock out his Brains.




Macarty.


They have done kindly, but thou'lt yet do better,


Quick — kill me Villain — or I'll rise and kill thee.






Irish Officers.


Macarty!






English Capt.


Spare his Life! and 'tis a noble Pris'ner!


Give him fair usage, thô you keep him safe.






Macarty.


O cruel Wretches — now I'll call you base


Cowards — to take a shott and not return it.


Loose my Arm — yet — you shall have t'other — No


I need you not —




Drops into a swound with his Wounds, they carry him off, and the Scene closes.












ACT III. SCENE III. 
LONDON-DERRY.


Enter
 Governour, 
three
 Collonels, Captains, 
&c.




Governour.


'TWas a bold Act, but just and necessary,


Which made us Masters of our Lives and 
Derry.


'Tis now too late to shrink, and who wou'd do't,


Thô twere not so? We yet are strong enough,


Althô almost on every side betray'd,


Bandon, Dungannon,
 quitted all and lost,


Our Passes forc'd meerly for want of fighting,


Relief refused, when half within our Walls.


The 
English
 Troops, Provision, Ammunition,


And all our most experienced Officers,


All gone, and little left but Walls and Hearts,


Yet hold they fast, and favour us kind Heaven,


We need not yet despair — A happy riddance


Of some we've made, whose Presence if still with us


Had done more harm than good: We have Provisions,


And while the Countrey's clear may yet bring more;


A Garrison, strong, numerous, and vigorous;


We've newly sent agen for aid to 
England,


If we succeed, History will record


Our Actions louder than 
Ostend
 or 
Troy;


And if we fall, never a braver Cause,


Nor can it more be worth the while to dye.






1. 
Collonel.


The Enemy apace are drawing hither,


Headed by 
Hamilton,
 who falsify'd


His Word and Trust with 
England
 — they are numerous,


But yet all 
Irish,
 save some Officers


Sent o're from 
France,
 both Nations we have conquer'd,




And may agen — unless by Famine press'd,


More than the Enemy — which, to avoid,


Twere necessary every private House


Were searcht immediately, and all things brought


To th' general Magazine, thence given out


By just proportion as our number is.






Governour.


You Counsel well — about it instantly;


But what's of more concern, if possible,


Than that it self, — Let's all promote a Union


In different Parties here — if that once break,


We're lost inevitably, and become


The scorn and triumph of our Enemies.


What was't destroy'd the fam'd 
Jerusalem,


But Faction within, more deadly and more fatal


Than all the 
Roman
 Army at the Gates?


And batter'd down their Walls with more success


Within, than did the Engines from abroad.






2. 
Coll.


So well I hope our Interest is seen,


That thô their Heads being gone, most left behind


Seem little better than a Rabble now;


Yet even they can 
Feel
 as well as others,


Thô not much used to 
think
 — Besides we've Officers


Remaining still behind, as brave as those


Who quitted 
Derry,
 and as signaliz'd


In bold Defence o'th' 
English
 Int'rest here;


These have the Hearts of all the common sort,


And both wou'd rather Dye, nay, Starve, than yield;


They'd make it Death to 
think
 as well as 
speak
 on't,


Cou'd one as well as t'other be discover'd.






3. 
Coll.


Already their Fidelity we've try'd,


And quickly shall their Valour, thô opprest


With numbers at the Fords, and wanting all


Was necessary for their own Defence:


But now they're satisfy'd their Leaders are


Firm as themselves, ready to share their danger.


In a few hours we easily shall guess


Their future Carriage, for the Enemy




Comes on a pace, already part encampt


Upon the neighb'ring Hills — the whole consists


Of twenty-thousand men effectively;


The 
best
 of 
bad,
 cull'd out of all the rest,


Canon they have, and Bombs and Engineers,


We must expect smart Entertainment with 'em.






Governour.


Let's to the Walls, and see what Face they bear,


Tho' probaby we shortly may meet nearer.




Exeunt omnes.






SCENE II. 
The
 Irish 
CAMP, — and General's Tent.


Hamilton, Mamow, Pusignan, Clancarty, Butler, Fitz-gerald, 
and other Officers.




Hamilton.


WHat mean these sturdy Rebels, that they yet


Delay surrendring? Can they think to stand


Our Royal Army? will those ragged Walls


Which scarce will bear the shock of their own Canon,


How then of ours, secure 'em from our Arms?






Mamow.


Begar me vill batter 'em down with 1, 2, 3, Potgun.


Vat the Diable do they mean? do they not know


My great Maistre send his Lieutenant General 
Mamow


To pull down all de Walls, and burn, kill, kill,


De Man, Woman, and shucking Shild dat fight vid his


Brother King of 
England?






Fitz-gerald.


They only kindly stay 'till we attack 'em,


That we may have the pleasure


Of Military Execution on 'em;


For 'tis impossible they shou'd sustain


The least assault of such a puissant Army.






Butler.


Perhaps they question if we're yet in earnest;


Were but a Battery rais'd, and some few Bombs


Thrown in, 'twou'd make 'em tremble and submit,


If not infatuated.






Hamilton.


The Experiment is quickly try'd upon 'em:


Call th' Engineers, and let some shot be play'd




Against the Market-house — perhaps 'twill stagger 'em,


To see the Stones rattle about their Ears.






Clancarty.


A tedious way — and wer't not far more brave


To scale it instantly, and put to th' Sword


Whoe're resist? I'd be the first should lead 'em.






Hamilton.


My Lord, none e're could doubt 
Clancarty
's Valour,


But the Kings Subjects must not be exposed


To causeless hazards — time enough for that


If this succeed not — as I'd hope it may;


— For see — already they set ope the Gates,


And hurry in disorder hitherward;


Their wisest way, to yield upon Discretion.






Butler.


They rather seem to bear the face of Men


Desperately bent to ruine — see already


They charge our careless Out-Guards, and have beat 'em


Home to the Trenches.






Hamilton.


They are Impudent —


But shall be cooler — To your Charges strait;


Draw out a Party of Horse and face the Rebels;


Remember 'tis the first Attempt, on that


May very much of our Success depend.






Fitz-girald.


They've taken a long Sally from their Town,


Nor shall return in hast —




Exeunt omnes.


Enter a Party of the
 Derry men. 
Collonels, Captains,
 &c.




Collonel.


So — we begin to rouze 'em — who wou'd think


To see how briskly they at first advance;


They were resolv'd to play an 
Irish
-trick,


And run away; but that 'tis the Beasts Nature,


Since one o'th two must run, he'll be so civil


To save the other side the Labour.




Enter
 Irish, Mamow, Fitz girald, 
&c.




Fitz-girald.


Yield Rebels!






Collonel.


Yes! —




Shoots him dead, the Parties joyn, the
 English 
beat the
 Irish 
off, and fight behind the Scenes.








SCENE III. 
Derry.


Enter Governour; to him a Captain from the Field.




Captain,


'Twas a tough bout—, the 
Irish
 cheated us


And fought awhile like men.






Governour.


We from the Walls


Cou'd not distinctly see what happened there.






Captain.


From the brave Colonel I'm sent on purpose,


Who charg'd i'th' head o'th' Horse to give account


Of this days action—, who is now retired


Under the Walls where still he'll face the Enemy.






Governour.


Cure my impatience quick, and let me hear't.






Captain.


He in two Squadrons first the Horse divides


The Enemy did the same; they met us briskly,


And head to head we fought, and breast to breast;


No way appear'd but thro', or o're each other


Each close t'his Friend, as close t'his Enemy,


Two Iron Bodies hacking one another


As Smiths on Anvils beat— while smoke and Fire


And sparks as thick as theirs flew from each Helmet,


Long thus we tugg'd till our impatient Colonel


Grown angry beyond suffrance when they grew


Unconscionably tedious e're they ran,


With his broad Sword clove one o'th' foremost down


Almost to th' Girdle-sted, then should'ring in


Charg'd thro' the whole Brigade—, we follow'd him


And glean'd the Deaths behind him. Twice he met


And hand to hand grappled their bold Commander


The 
French Mamau,
 who fought and curs'd as heartily


As possible—, as oft agen was sundred


By droves of either Party rushing in


Betwixt their lifted Swords— the third wish'd time




They met, and Monsieur at the first Encounter


Fell dead, blaspheming on the dusty
 plain


And dying bit the ground—. His Brother came


Madder than he and swore a quick Revenge


Or else to follow him —, he had the last


From the same hand, who sent him groveling after


On the same spot, so soon, their Souls and blood


Met as they parted, these upon the Sand,


And those i'th' airy regions—. All the rest


Were fairly following them—, till a new party


Came from the Camp, who with their very weight


Forc'd a Retreat—, they eagerly prest on


And met their Fate behind, our Foot stood ready


Who all the Ditches lined, and gave 'em such


Warm Entertainment very few return'd


To tell the News—. At least two hundred left


Upon the spot, their Standard we have won


And store of spoil, nor lost above some Ten


In all the Action.






Governour.


Like true 
Brittains
 done


—And see they here return loaden with spoils


And fairly purchase Lawrels—. —Welcom here


Enter from the Walls, the Colonel, Officers, Souldiers,
 &c.


Thrice welcom to my Breast! dread Sons of War


My Heart beats quick, and something feels abroad


Kin to its own—, 'twou'd fain get out and meet it


O how I envy you so great an Action


(Or were you any else shou'd envy you)


You've let 'em know what they must look for from 
Derry


What Edge your Courages and Swords do bear.




[
Embraces the Colonel,
 &c]




Colonel.


We've bid 'm welcom— somewhat heartily


And as they like it, let 'em come agen


Tho' they'l perhaps be wiser—.








Governour.


No they will not


We certainly shall have 'em quickly with us


Rashness and Cowardice make up their Nature,


Prompt to attempt, mad, eager on destruction


Like other Beasts they'l run on Sword and Fire.


The Bores will stake themselves, hold but the Spear


Direct against 'em—, but when once they feel


The warm blood trickle down and stain the Earth


Unlike a generous Beast, like Curs they whine


Clap up their Tails and run, nor will they stop


Till death reach them, or they some place of safety.


—Howe're we are prepar'd—, fresh men to th' Walls


I'le speed away, and others to the works:


While all your honourable wounds are dress't,


And you from your long Toyl and Labours rest.




Exeunt omnes.






SCENE IV. 
The Irish Camp.


Enter
 Hamilton, Butler, Clancarty, Talbot, Nettervile, 
&c.




Hamilton.


Well—, 'tis the chance of War— always unequal,


Sometimes they must suffer—, but Revenge


Sweet dear Revenge will soon set all things right


And almost make 'em live agen— we must


Repay their visit, home and speedily.






Col. 
Talbot.


If there be God or Devil, let both stand Neuter


Or side with Rebels now as oft before


'Tis the same thing—, I neither fear their Anger


Nor hope their Aid—, this sword and Arm's my God


I have and do 
Decree
 to Conquer them.






Hamilton.


Still wicked Will! But yet he's resolute


And firm to th' Cause—, small faults are soon pass't over.


But we've no room for talk—, swift action calls


The 
English
 will be here with strong Relief


Unless we're speedy—, Let's with Expedition


The Life of every noble Enterprize.




Begin th' attaque upon their Lines, Works, Town.


Last time they met you unprovided, now


Prepar'd you come they ne're can think to stand.






Butler,


What men can do, resolved to beat or dye


What Loyal Subjects against hated Rebels,


And Catholicks against a faithless Crew


Of cursed Heretical Dogs, we promise, swear,


And Vow, ne're to return unless with Conquest.






Hamilton,


Success attend you, equal to your valour.




Exeunt Omnes.






SCENE. V. 
Derry. The Walls.


Governour, Several Captains, Officers,
 &c.




Govern.


I find I took em right, the Camps in motion


And some great thing in hand, see, there they come


And swarm along as if they'd cover us,


Three parties Horse, two other Foot appear.


Captain; I need not order you to your charges


Who are already eager to be there.






1 
Capt.


The Feasts so good there needs small invita∣tion.


Wer'e gone—




Exeunt Omnes.


Manent Governour and a Colonel.




Govern.


Hark— from the Irish Camp a dismal yell


Loud as the Midnight Wolves when met in Troops


To assault the Folds, their parties are come up,


The Horse have top'd our Line, with loud Huzza's


And Fagots all before 'em.






Col.


Trust their welcome.


See, are our men behind hand in returns


They scorn to keep the Forts, but meet them fairly


Tho' theirs the disadvantage, on the Strand.


See how they mow 'em! Sure they are grown hoarse


We here no more Huzzah's. Pykes, Musquets, Scythes


Have spoiled their Musick.— Into th
 
Lough
 they run,


And by one Death another vainly shun.








Governour.


Who should that be that fights when all the rest


Are broke and shatter'd—; I cou'd wish his Life


He is so brave






Colonel.


Unless my Eyes mistake


As easily they may at such a distance


'Tis young 
Montgarret
—, see— his Horse is kill'd


And he takes Quarter—, all his Party routed.






Gov.


'Tis well—, where are the rest—? ha— at what distance,


How reverendly the Cowards gaze upon


Their Fellows Fate—, the other two bold Squadrons


Who with thick bellowings lately tore the Air


Stand still as Statues.






Colonel.


But their Foot come on


And warmly too—, those Granadeers fight well


Ours bend a little—






Gov.


Haste your Regiment


To their Relief.






Colonel.


The work is done without it


They've beat 'em off—, and fire still on their Rear.


—Ha! are they immortal— that none drop,


With all our Shot?






Gov.


O! Pleasant Cowards—, see how witty Fear is!


As they go off they bear the dead behind 'em


Who do more service now than while alive


And guard the rest from all our shot secure.


—But ours return, and almost every man


His Prisoner brings.




Enter the
 Derry 
Men, with
 Talbot, Nettervile, Butler, 
&c. Prisoners.




Governour.


To the Prisoners.


Gentlemen— 'tis the Fate of War—, we use not


What e're your Countrymen return us for it,


To violate our Word and Quarter given.


—
To the Captains,


See they are lodg'd as handsomly as our


Convenience and Security permits 'em.




Exeunt omnes.








SCENE. VI. 
The Irish Camp.


Enter An
 Irish 
Funeral, of one of their Commanders kill'd in the last Action. Tapers, Crosses, Dirges. Two fat Friars singing—, and praying for his Soul.




Song by the Priests.




1.


REst thy Soul in Bliss dear Friend!


Now beginning, n'ere to end:


At Purgatory be not scar'd


Its Flame shall never singe thy Beard.


Mount to rights to Heav'n, nor stay


To call at the Half-way-house by th'way.






2.


On thy Soul, while here below,


If some little spots did grow:


Murder, Perjury, or Rape


Or some such other small Escape:


By thy meritorious Fall


Thou hast o're atton'd 'em all.






3.


Innocent as Child unborn


On the golden wings of morn


Mount to bliss, and pray for those


Strugling with their faithless Foes:


Aid thy Friends who thee adore


As thou other Saints before.




[
They put him into the Grave, and the
 Irish 
kneel down by him, tear their Hair, throw up the Dirt, and lament his death with unsufferable Howlings, as their manner is, singing this Song over his Grave.
]








Irish
 SONG.




AH Brother Teague! Why didst thou go?


Whillilla lilla lilla lilla lilla lilla loo!


And leave thy Friends in grief and wo,


Aboo aboo aboo aboo aboo aboo aboo!






Hadst thou not store of Houshold-stuff


Whillilla
 &c.


Potates and Usquebagh enough


Aboo
 &c.






Three Sheep, one Garroon, and a Cow


Whillilla
 &c.


A Garden, Cabin and a Plough


Aboo
 &c.






Hadst thou not Bonny-clabbar store


Whillilla
 &c.


If not enough wee'd giv'n thee more.


Aboo
 &c.






Why wouldst thou Teague! Ah tell me why


Whillilla
 &c.


Thus play the Fool and maake a dy


Aboo
 &c.






Why didst thou touch the fatal shore


Whillilla
 &c.


Where we shall never see thee more


Aboo aboo aboo aboo aboo aboo aboo!




[While they are in the midst of their Harmony comes a Shot from the Town, and kills the two Fryars and several others—, all the rest start up and run away.]










SCENE VII. 
Derry.


The Walls—, Captains, Souldiers,
 &c.




1 
Sol.


We've spoil'd their howling, why 'twas more unsufferable


Then all their Canon—, there was a yell


Fearful enough to've frighted him almost


From his long sleep agen.






2 
Sol.


But Oh! those holy Cheats—, those goodly Friars


How they both caper'd when the Chain-shot came


And Circumciz'd 'em just i'th' middle!


By this time if their Souls are not so gross


Pursy and unwieldy as their Carcasses,


They may have reach'd their Friend who went before 'em.






1. 
Capt.


Never insult over an Enemy


Conquer'd or slain—, if either, that's enough


The rest is base—, 'Tis true o're you they wou'd


But even there o'recome 'em as in Battle.


—Come Captain—, Let's to our Charge— the 
Irish
 Prisoners


See how they brook confinement here.






2. 
Capt.


Agreed—




[
They open a Door, and the Prisoners come forth—,
 Talbot, Macdonald, 
&c. discontented and gloomy.
]




1. 
Capt.


to 
Talbot.
 You're Melancholy Colonel—, we are come


To give you some diversion— not insult you


What's now your Fate, to morrow may be ours.






Talbot.


Such Rebels merit not so good—.






2. 
Capt.


We Scorn


The name and thing—, nor wou'd, nor ever did


Yet take it in the Field—.






Macdonald.


Can you deny it?


To reason calmly—, took you not up Arms


Against your Kings Lieutenant here at first,


And since even he himself in Person's come


Continue in your stubborn disobedience?








1. 
Capt.


For our first taking Arms, 'twas on advice


Of Massacres intended—, and as some


Of you acknowledge, actually proposed


To th' Deputy—. Those barbarous attempts


All Nations own 'tis lawful to repel


With utmost Force, since that's the only Law


Can either authorize or from 'em shield.


The last is not forgot—. For our remaining


In such a posture, 'tis for 
Englands
 King


And 
Ireland
's too we fight—. This ever was


Since Conquer'd, a Dependant held inseparable


From th' 
English
 Crown, when quitted, thrown away


And slighted by that Bigot Prince who wore it


Placed on two Royal Heads, the next in blood


And brightest pair in 
Europe—,
 those we own


Our rightful King and Queen, and you no better


Than that foul name with which you've branded us.






Talbot.


The Massacre you talk of with such dread


Was no more real than that common place


Of cruelty—, the bloody Forty one—


When, after infinite insufferable


And odious provocations the poor Natives


Took for themselves and their Religion both


Just necessary Arms, Commission'd by


The King himself—. The Murthers buzz'd so loud


Were Executions which in War will ever


Be more or less—, and those you first begun


How many Thousands in the Isle 
Magee;


Before a stroke was struck by ours— and then


We offer'd Murtherers on either side


Shou'd have fair Trial—, this you ne're accepted


Because you dared not.






2. 
Capt.


Only there you're right.


We dared not be indeed such hardy Fools


To trust our Lives with 
Irish
 Consciences


Judges and Jury all your Countrymen




Who do notorious Justice when they meet us,


And before such you did propose a Tryal


Of which there was no need, for all the 
Irish


Had been acquitted, all the 
English
 guilty.


That of 
Magee
 was a full year at least


After your horrid Massacre begun,


And only warm revenge for many Murthers.


Which you began er'e any provocation


The hour, the day prefixt all o're the Kingdom


Own'd by your own, and not by you denyed;


Who only say you were provoked to what


You did— but how— had you not your Estates,


Liberties, Lives, although a conquer'd Nation;


Were not your Lawyers, nay some Judges 
Irish,


Was it Religion then? But was not that


Which you call so, allowed more bare then ever,


Convents and Nunneries every where connived at,


No man molested, Mass in publick said


All o're the Kingdom, spite of all the Laws


Point-blank against it— as for your Commissions


Your great 
Oneal
 himself, and Lord 
Mac-guire


Own'd at their death 'twas all a Forgery.






Butler,


Well Gentlemen, which ever part went wrong


Or this or that can never now recall it.


But one things certain, and you've treated us


So generously we cannot but in kindness


Advise you on't— You see no succours yet


From 
England
 come, or if they are in vain


Kilmore
 is ours, and we a Boom have fastned


Across the 
Lough
 that 'tis impossible


By that way to releive you; —your Provisions


I see come short, you may have yet fair Terms;


If you stand out there's not a man escapes,


Yield then and let not such brave men be ruin'd.






1 
Capt.


Captain we thank you for your kind advice


But should the Souldiers hear you'd not be safe




From worrying, nor shou'd we propose it.


We're one and all— There's not a private Centinel


But willingly wou'd eat the Flesh from one arm


And fight with t'other, ere they wou'd surrender,


—Besides for yet a while we're richly stored


Tallow and Starch, —why 'tis luxurious diet.


And when that fails, and all besides, the Garrison


Sir, we have heard e'm swear't, and do believe it


Will first eat you, and then themselves, e're yield.


Tho' every hour we expect releif


And know the English are ith' 
Lough
 already.


And will be here—


(A shout without) But we must to our Charges.


For business calls, we wish you well to bear


What can't he mended.




Exeunt Omnes.






SCENE VIII. 
Derry-Walls


Enter Governour, Colonels, Captains.




Govern.


Too well appears the reason of that shout


I'th' Irish Camp— See in the 
Lough
 below


The English Ships attempting our relief,


The first is stranded, while the barbarous Enemy,


Runs down in Sholes to Fire, or kill, or take 'em,


While with insulting Flowts they call t'our Guards,


And bid us send our Carpenters to help 'em.






1 
Col.


Some of their mirth is spoiled with that broad∣side,


Full in the midst o'th' Rabble— nay the shock


Unless— I see as many, what they wish.


Has floated her again.






2 
Col.


'T has done it really


Not only in your fancy, now Salvation!


The Boom is broke, with Wind and Tide they come,


And scatter storms of Fire and Death about 'em




Till 
Kilmore
 rattles, and the bloody strand


Lies spread with Carcasses, and Legs and Arms,


Bodies and Heads and Men alive and dead,


Fly every where so fast as if they strove


Which shou'd outrun the other.






Gov.


They have reached the Key, relief & life comes with 'em.




Enter English
 Captains.




Govern.


Brave Countreymen there's little need to tell you,


You're welcome here, for all that's left of 
Derry


Confesses it, those living Carcasses


You see remaining fain wou'd smile, had they


But flesh enough to do it, not great 
Orange,


Our now great King was with more joy received,


In gasping 
England
 when he came to save it


From the same Enemy, then you are here.






Engl.


C. Nor with less Joy we bring you this relief


Then wee'd our selves receive it, but what news


From th' Enemies Camp, must we go visit them,


Or won't they be so civil to attend us.






Govern.


They do what they were born to run away.


Fire all their very Tents and Huts, and worse,


The Countrey too least we should make advantage.


Whole waggon-loads of Arms thrown into th' River.


Bursting their largest Guns, as too unweieldy


For thir light March, O had we but some Horse


To give 'em one kind Farewell, 'tis so strange


For those who have been Neighbours now so long


To part abruptly.






Engl.


Capt. We again shall find 'em,


For 
Schombergh
 speedily is here designed


With twenty thousand men to march for 
Dublin.


And end the War.






Governour,


Impatiently we wait,


Till that wish day when we agen may meet,


Those who so often grovelled at our Feet.

Tyrconnel, Rice, Nugent,
 &c. 
Neagle.




Tyrc.


Derry
 reliev'd, and 
Inniskilling
 lost,


Sure destiny mistakes, or we do so.


Macarty
 Prisoner, 
Hamilton
 baffled, 
English
 landed


And more still coming! What will next be done.


Were all my Goods aboard, as once before


And I there too, I scarcely shou'd look back


To be Lieutenant, Or indeed a something


Which bears some lesser name, (the King's scarce more




Aside.




Nug.


The glorious Cause we now are all embarkt in


Is firm enough to stand in spite of all


Th'attempts against it of weak Hereticks,


What are two Towns? they yet have won no more


Nay only kept 'em, and for the disgrace


Incurred by missing them, there are excuses


Sound plausibly enough, which wee'l transmit


To our Friends in 
England,
 as our selves wee'l use 'em.


—Alas, 'twas place, a little mean


And worthless Town, we only lay before it


For Recreation, might have taken it


When e're we pleased, at an hours warning had we


But strained our Forees there, 'tis true wee'd some,


Some few perhaps of note who dy'd in th' Army,


But there are many ways of death besides




The Sword and Cannon, several brought Diseases


That left 'em there, tho' lives and all went with 'em.


The usual chance of War, not to be avoided.


—For what's to come we've still a numerous Army,


A noble body of Horse as are in 
Europe,


Ten Thousand with the least— with these wee'l tug.


At least this Summer ore, the fickle English


By then perhaps will tired and weary grow


Of their new King, or 
France
 will be at leisure


To give their Arms a powerful diversion


And us assistance here. His Privateers


Will scowr our Seas, and pick each Vessel up


That peeps abroad, this will breed Discontents


In those enough inclin'd to't without Cause,


Besides we still have a strong party there


Desperate and Resolute—, they may produce


Something themselves thats not contemptible,


But come the worst, 'tis but to Fire the Countrey,


Kill all the Heretics, and run away


By th' Light their Houses make.






Neagle,


But still for Money


The Life oth' cause—, That must be got or all


Yet done or counselled will be lost and nothing.






Rice,


We shall have shortly large supplies from 
France


Some we already have.






Neagle,


All far too little


But our Invention must supply what's wanting,


Money there is ith' Kingdom, and good store


This i'le contrive, and speciously, to bring


Each Cob into th' 
Exchequer.






Tyrconnel,


That would half


Restore my hopes, but 'tis impossible.






Neagle,


First hear it. I propose new pieces should


Be Coyned, of Copper, or some pretty mettal


That may look well, their value as we please


Let all be obliged to take this Royal money,




From Souldiers or the King; but when they pay


Custom or Subsidy, or ought beside


Be that in the old Coyn—






Rice,


The only fear


Is least they murmur at the imposition.






Tyrcon.


How, murmur at their Prince, d'ye think they'r Rebels


If he demands their their Throats, are they not his,


Their heads, all at his service, and shou'd tumble


Themselves oth' floor for him to tread and spurn 'em,






Neagle,


Not yet so high to run the supposition


The Natives never were much used to Money


To them 'tis all the same— alas they're scarce


So subtle to distinguish one and to'ther


And they're ith' right on't, every thing is worth


Its settled value, if this buys a Cow


And Silver did no more, 'tis the same thing.






Tyrconnel.


To say but truth, the less we are engaged


To insulting 
France
 the better, they begin


To scorn, affront, abuse the Native 
Irish


Which we sure cannot bear.






Neagle,


Nor need we long—


When once they'v done their business that they came for


We easily can turn 'em home agen.


Mean while all may be fair, dissemble what


We can't digest, nor can we er'e be greater


The King, good man, is old, and minds his Beads,


His Priests and Hounds share all his time between 'em.


Sometimes wee'l bring him out, and let him walk


A turn or two, as the 
Chinese
 their Emperors,


To let the people know he's still alive.


And make all preparation necessary


To oppose the English, if they shou'd descend


On any part o'th' Island.






Enter Messenger with a Rope about his neck.




Mess.


Post from the North I bear the dreadful news


The Sea's all covered with the English Fleet,


A thousand Sail I think, for there's no end,


And bore directly in for 
Bangor Bay.






Tyrc.


—'Tis well enough, I doubted they wou'd bid


For 
Dublin,
 we have time and ground and men,


Sufficient for 'em, come they when they will.




Enter another Messenger as the former.




Messenger,


The Enemies landed all in 
Bangor Bay.


Belfast
 already's yielded, 
Carrick-fergus


Invested round, and gone by this, the Countrey


Roll in amain, the English drive along


And none or can or dare resist the Torrent.






Nugent,


Time enough yet, they will be out of breath


And 'twill be our turns then to march and meet 'em.


Already we are rendevouzed betwixt


Dundalk
 and famed 
Tredagh,
 when they come thither


(But first they have the 
Newry
 to get through,


A Pass that none can force but bulls or Devils)


We may speak with 'em.






Tyrcon.


When we know their numbers,


For Fame still greatens as it farther goes.


Till then lets take what measures now are needful,


We've all the Arms already of the Hereticks.


If there are any persons yet whose power


May injure us, let them too be secured,


And to amuse the people, set the Priests


To Prayer for good success.






Rice,


If this blow over,


Or we but keep 'em there at a due distance


Wee'l have a Parliament to attaint the Estates


Of all that joyn the English, or absent,


And tare in pieces those faint Nun-spun Acts,




Made to the prejudice oth' Loyal Irish,


Unsettle and unhinge their Settlements,


Law or the Sword wou'd do it, best by both;


Dominion to our Country we'l restore,


And to proud Conquerers be Slaves no more.




Exeunt Omnes.






Scene II. 
The Newry.
 Schombergs 
Army. The
 Inniskilling 
Men, &c.




General.


Thus far we've only marcht, not fought our way.


Here will be occasion for your Valour, if


They've but a spark of Courage, and tough work


Must needs ensue. The Pass is strong, but must


Be won, or we stay here.






Captain.


No, rather in our Graves; we only wait


Orders to charge, as they our doing that,


Unless they're strangely changed, to run away.






General.


Go take a Party then and try th' event.




The
 Irish 
appear posted advantagiously. The
 English 
throw themselves upon 'em, who after two or three Fires, fling their Arms into the River, and shift for themselves.




General.


Both sides I see are very expeditious.






Captain.


Next for 
Dundalk.




Exeunt.








Scene III. Dublin.


Tyrconnel, Nugent, Neagle, Irish Lords. To 'em a Messenger.




Mess.


The Newry's lost; and on the Plain before


Dundalk
 I saw the 
English
 Troops advance


Er'e I came thence. By this they must be there.






Tyrcon.


Sure they fly.






Nug.


I doubt tis ours do so. But are our Army


Ready to meet 'em there?






Tyrcon.


They'r all prepared.


We know their formidable Numbers too;


Some twenty thousand only at the most:


We thrice out-number 'em; and when they know


Our force, will sure retire faster than they


March'd forward— but my Lords, I'll to the Army,


The King will do no hurt, what's yet left of him:


If hee's there too, perhaps some of the Rebels


Will yield at his approach. Besides already


We've many Friends in 
Schomberg
's Camp, from whence


We nere shall want intelligence at least,


Perhaps do something more.






Neag.


Success attend your Excellency thither.








Scene IV. Dundalk.


English Army, General, Council of War, Officers, &c.




General.


I know the English Genius and their Fire,


My Country-men have ofte felt 'em both.




And now, tis granted they'll but fight their Slaves.


— But then the disproportion is so huge,


Our Horse so few and weak, their's strong and numerous,


Their Foot four times at least more than the 
English,


'Twou'd be too great hazard to attempt;


Too great a price, ev'n Victory to gain


By breaking all our Army, ere more Force


Arrive to joyn us, or advantage offers.


We've here firm footing, whence they nere can beat us;


If they attempt, they fight at disadvantage;


And only come to meet prepared Destruction.






Officer.


We must submit, tho 'tis a thing looks strange


To Englishmen thus coopt, to wait the Enemy,


Who always used to seek 'em, and dy here


By sickness, closeness, and thick foggy Air,


Who bravely might for a good purchase sell


Our Lives, and get eternal Fame by losing 'em.






General.


Which ever way they'r lost; if in defence


Tis of your Country, and obedience to


So good a King, you never cou'd fall braver.


— But to that reason I before advance


Against Engagement, there's perhaps a greater,


A secret kept till now — I have Intelligence


There's a design form'd to betray the Camp


To th' Enemy — We shall hear more on't speedily;


The Guards are doubled, and I wait each minute


Some false Deserters making to the Enemy,


Who are so strictly watcht they can't escape.


And here they come—




Enter Souldiers, with a Deserter, his Hands tied,
 &c.




Deserter.


Mercy, my Lord, and I'll discover all.






Officer.


We've seiz'd his Papers which have don't already,


A draught of all the Camp, and each weak place


Described that's in it— A List of several Officers




And Souldiers, who design to joyn the Enemy,


When we engage; or when they'r on the Guard:


Deliver up the Gates.






General.


Now Gentlemen,


You see my Reason— Go and hang him instantly,


As soon as his Confederates are seiz'd:


Proclaim immediate Death to every Papist,


Who owns not his Religion publickly.


Guard well the Avenues. To night my self


I'll walk the Rounds to see you do your Duties,


And shall severely punish negligence.




Exeunt Omnes.






Scene V. Irish Camp.


Enter
 Tyrconel, Hamilton, Clancarty, 
Monsieur de
 Rozen, 
&c.




Tyrcon.


Tho' our designs are on their Camp discovered,


And that sly Fox their General, posts himself,


Where none can touch him— 'tis full out as well;


Distempers will their business do, and save


Our Swords the Labour— They already drop,


Provision comes but slowly, our thick Fogs


Please not their queasy Stomachs; they'll begin


To wish for home. What if our own fall with 'em,


As hundreds do each week? — 'Tis a fair change


And we can spare 'em. What's a Subjects Life,


A hundreds, thousands, or a millions to


A great mans Interest?— The next News we hear,


They leave 
Dundalk,
 and then — beware their Rear.


Exeunt Omnes.










Scene VI. Dundalk, as before.


Most of the Souldiers sick, many dead, the rest pining.


Enter a Collonel and two Captains.




1. 
Capt.


Ah Collonel! — Was't for this we hither came,


To lay our bones in this accursed Country


Without a blow— The Land of Want and Famine,


Sickness and Misery, and Grief and Death.—






2. 
Capt.


Death Captain! and d'ye reckon that among the Grievances


And cou'd you have the Conscience to ask more?


Had we but that, and honestly and fairly


Had these two Arms bin torn with Chain-shot from me,


Not pined away with dull dull lingring torments


Twou'd nere have made me sigh.






Collon.


I own t'is hard.


Nor have you only suffered, — None can blame


Our prudent General, who moved at last,


With the Condition of this Skeleton,


Of what was once an Army, has gi'en Orders.


To quit this fatal place, and march agen


Beyond the 
Newry,
 there to quarter till


Recruits and better Seasons call for Action.






Capt.


Nay, then there's hope we yet may pay our Land-Lords;


And thank them for their courteous Entertainment.


Dundalk
 adieu: Had but the Traytors doom


Bin changed, we died, they guarded in our Room,


They'd had the worse, we the far better choice,


And shou'd at such a wish'd exchange rejoice.


V
lleys of Curses be thy last Farewell,


Thou Map of 
Ireland,
 and thou Map of Hell.




Exeunt Omnes.










ACT. V.




Scene I. 
Irish Army at
 Dundalk.


Tyrconnel, Lazune, Hamilton, Clancarty,
 &c.




Tyrcon.


ONce more we're here agen — tis a kind Omen,


May all the rest return as does 
Dundalk.


Quick — after with the Horse, cut off their Rear,


And drive the Rebels back into the Sea.


— Nor shall that save 'em, thither and beyond


We'll follow—






Hamil.


First discover in what order


They march, and where they stand — tis probable


They'll keep the 
Newry
-Pass and in that Country


Endeavour to secure their Winter Quarters.






Clanc.


Then we must force it instantly, nor suffer


Their harbring there— They'r on the run already,


And soon will quit it when our Troops approach,


Who so much Valour have already shown






Tyre.


Let it be done, and 
Ireland
's all our own.




Exeunt Omnes.






Scene II. 
The Newry.


A Party of Irish — Officers, Souldiers, &c.




Offic.


March quick and close— They take not yet th' Alarm.


The Town's already ours— The Prisoner whom


We lately took, informs there's scrarce a hundred


Yet left alive, and those half sick and languishing;


The rest or careless are or desperate,


Nor dream of that warm visit we shall make 'em.




The Centry discovers 'em, and fires three times, retiring.






Officer.


Discovered— But too late for their prevention;


In— and we're Conquerers—




They enter the Town— Several Officers come out in their shirts, and are knockt oth' head. A Drummer beats an Alarm, and a few of the English gather in the Streets.




Eng. Offic.


Ha— are you come so far to hinder us


From dying now in quiet— Fellow Souldiers,


You see 'em— Rally here behind this Cart,


And give one Charge— if they march not back


At their accustomed pace— I'll e'ne run for 'em.




[The English charge— The Irish run]


Enter several English Souldiers crawling upon their Hands and Feet with their Musquets in their Hands.




Officer.


Poor Wretches—What d'ye mean— You'r fitter for


Your Beds or th' Hospital, than War and Action.






1 
Sould.


Noble Captain — Let me have but shot at 'em,


And then I'll dy contented.






2. 
Sould.


Now we're their Matches, 'twere not fair to fight 'em,


If strong and well as they.




They both get up to a Bank, fire their Pieces at the
 Irish, 
and fall dead themselves.




Offic.


'Twas done like Englishmen— Their Courage did


Almost outlast their Breath— but were too weak


To follow these — who, lest agen they rally


And come more numerous— Souldiers, post away


For speedy Succour.




Exeunt Omnes.






Scene III. 
Belfast.


General, Several Officers.




Gener.


Heaven smiles agen— The Sun has drest the Air


With fragrant blooms — nor is the Earth less fair,




Supplies from 
England
 every day appear


And more— the King himself will soon be here.


Who wou'd not fight when such a General leads


Who in the Steps of Ancient Heroes treads,


Despises Danger, and himself can meet,


What wou'd make meaner Souls dissolve to fee't?


Each hour we him expect, and when he comes;


Then for the Field and Fame, for Palms or Tombs.




Exeunt.






Scene IV. 
The Royal Fleet at the Bay of
 Bangor— 
The
 Mary 
Yacht with the Standard— All the Shore enlightned with Bonfires.
 Belfast.


The General, Officers, Messenger.




Messeng.


From 
Carick-sergus
 Garrison I bring


News of the safe Arrival of the King.


Five hundred Sail attend him — such a sight


As glads the Shore more than each Festal Light


Kindled at his approach.






General.


A joyful sound!


Go fire the Train, and send the News around:


Let all our Quarters the blest Tidings hear,


And all the Bogs in 
Ireland
 quake for fear.


Their Fate is come — The Pageant King must run;


And once agen fly from the conscious Sun.


And in some Monastery hide his Head


Midst lonely Tombs, and the polluted Dead.


While that bright Hero who supplies his place,


Sways his strong Scepter with so great a Grace:


In trembling 
France
 shall give new wonders Birth,


And rend the witherd 
Lilies
 from the Earth.




Exeunt.






The end of the First Part.
