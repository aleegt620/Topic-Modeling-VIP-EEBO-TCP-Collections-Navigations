The Authour's
PREFACE.


THE study of Geogra∣phy
is both profitable
and delightfull; but the Wri∣ters
thereof, though some of
them exact enough in setting
down Longitudes and Lati∣tudes,
yet in those other re∣lations
of Manners, Religi∣on,
Government and such
like, accounted Geographi∣cal,
have for the most
part miss'd their proportions.


Some too brief and deficient
satisfy not; others too volu∣minous
and impertinent cloy
and weary out the Reader;
while they tell long Stories
of absurd Superstitions, Ce∣remonies,
quaint Habits,
and other petty Circumstan∣ces
little to the purpose.
Whereby that which is usefull,
and onely worth observation,
in such a wood of words, is
either overslip't, or soon for∣gotten:
which perhaps brought
into the mind of some men,
more learned and judicious,
who had not the leisure or
purpose to write an entire
Geography, yet at least to as∣say
something in the descrip∣tion


of one or two Countreys,
which might be as a Pattern
or Example, to render others
more cautious hereafter, who
intended the whole work. And
this perhaps induc'd 
Paulus
Jovius
 to describe onely 
Mus∣covy

and 
Britain.
 Some such
thoughts, many years since,
led me at a vacant time to
attempt the like argument;
and I began with 
Muscovy,

as being the most northern
Region of 
Europe
 reputed
civil; and the more northern
Parts thereof, first discovered
by 
English
 Voiages. Where∣in
I saw I had by much the
advantage of 
Jovius.
 What
was scatter'd in many Vo∣lumes,


and observ'd at seve∣ral
times by Eye-witnesses,
with no cursory pains I laid
together, to save the Reader
a far longer travaile of wan∣dring
through so many desert
Authours; who yet with some
delight drew me after them,
from the eastern Bounds of

Russia,
 to the Walls of 
Ca∣thay,

in several late Iour∣neys
made thither overland
by 
Russians,
 who describe the
Countreys in their way far
otherwise than our common
Geographers. From procee∣ding
further other occasions
diverted me. This Essay,
such as it is, was thought by
some, who knew of it, not


amiss to be published; that
so many things remarkable,
dispers'd before, now brought
under one view, might not
hazard to be otherwise lost,
nor the labour lost of collec∣ting
them.

MOSCOVIA:
OR,
Relations of Moscovia,
As far as hath been discover'd by
English VOYAGES;


Gather'd from the Writings of se∣veral
Eye-witnesses: And of o∣ther
less-known Countries ly∣ing
Eastward of Russia as far as
Cathay, lately discovered at se∣veral
times by Russians.




CHAP. I.


A brief Description.


THE Empire of 
Moscovia,

or as others call it, 
Russia,

is bounded on the North
with 
Lapland
 and the Ocean;


Southward by the 
Crim Tartar;

on the West by 
Lituania, Livo∣nia

and 
Poland;
 on the East by
the River 
Ob,
 or 
Oby,
 and the

Nagayan Tartars
 on the 
Volga,
 as
far as 
Astracan.


The north parts of this Coun∣try
are so barren,
 that the Inha∣bitants
fetch their Corn a 1000
miles, and so cold in Winter that
the very Sap of their Wood-fewel
burning on the fire, freezes at the
Brands end where it drops. The
Mariners which were left a ship∣board
in the first English Voyage
thither,
 in going up onely from
their Cabins to the Hatches,
 had
their breath so congeal'd by the
cold, that they fell down as it
were stifl'd. The Bay of Saint

Ni∣cholas,
 where they first put in,
lyeth in 64 degrees;
 call'd so
from the Abby there built of
Wood; wherein are 20 Monks;
unlearned, as then they found
them, and great Drunkards:


their Church is fair, full of Ima∣ges,
and Tapers. There are be∣sides
but 6 Houses, whereof one
built by the English. In the Bay
over against the Abby is 
Rose
Island,
 full of damask and red
Roses,
 Violets, and wild Rose∣mary;
the Isle is in circuit 7 or 8
miles: about the midst of 
May

the snow there is clear'd, having
two months been melting; then
the ground in 14 daies is dry,
and Grass knee-deep within a
month: after 
September
 Frost
returns, and Snow a yard high:
it hath a House built by the En∣glish
near to a fresh fair Spring
North-east of the Abby on the
other side of 
Duina
 is the Castle
of 
Archangel;
 where the English
have another House. The River

Duina
 beginning about 700 miles
within the Country, having first
receiv'd 
Pinega
 falls here into the
Sea, very large and swift, but
shallow. It runneth pleasantly


between Hills on either side; be∣set
like a Wilderness with high
Firre, and other Trees: their
Boats of Timber without any
Iron in them, are either to sail,
or to be drawn up with Ropes
against the stream.


North-east beyond 
Archangel

standeth 
Lampas,
 where twice a
year is kept a great Fair of 
Rus∣ses,
Tartars
 and 
Samoeds:
 and
to the Land-ward 
Mezen,
 and

Slobotca
 two Towns of traffick
between the River 
Pechora,
 or

Petzora,
 and 
Duina;
 To Seaward
lies the Cape of 
Candinos,
 and
the Island of 
Colgoieve
 about
30 leagues from the Bar of 
Pe∣chora

in 69 degrees.


The River 
Pechora
 or 
Petzora

holding his course through 
Sibe∣ria,

how far, the 
Russians
 therea∣bouts
know not, runneth into
the Sea at 72. mouths, full of
Ice: abounding with Swans,
Ducks, Geese and Partridge,


which they take in 
Iuly,
 sell the
Feathers, and salt the Bodies for
Winter Provision. On this River
spreading to a Lake stands the
Town of 
Pustozera
 in 68 degrees,
having some 80, or 100 Houses,
where certain Merchants of 
Hull

winter'd in the year 1611. The
Town 
Pechora
 small and poor
hath 3 Churches. They traded
there up the River 4 daies jour∣ney
to 
Oustzilma
 a small Town
of 60 Houses.
 The 
Russians
 that
have travail'd, say that this River
springs out of the Mountains of

Iougoria
 and runs through 
Per∣mia.

Not far from the Mouth
thereof are the Straits of 
Vaigats,

of which hereafter: more east∣ward
is the Point of 
Naramzy,

and next to that, the River 
Ob.

Beyond which, the 
Muscovites

have extended lately their domini∣on.
Touching the 
Riphaean
 Moun∣tains
whence 
Tanais
 was ancient∣ly
thought to spring, our men


could hear nothing; but rather
that the whole Country is Cham∣pain,
and in the northmost part
huge and desert Woods of Firre,
abounding with Black Wolves,
Bears, Buffs, and another Beast
call'd Rossomakka, whose Female
bringeth forth by passing through
some narrow place, as between
two Stakes; and so presseth her
Womb to a disburthening. Tra∣vailing
southward they found the
Country more pleasant,
 fair and
better inhabited, Corn, Pasture,
Meadows and huge Woods.
 
Ar∣kania

(if it be not the same with

Archangel
) is a place of English
trade, from whence a days jour∣ney
distant, but from Saint 
Ni∣cholas

a 100 versts, 
Colmogro

stands on the 
Duina:
 a great
Town not wall'd, but scatter'd.
The English have here Lands of
their own, given them by the
Emperour, and fair Houses; not
far beyond, 
Pinega
 running be∣tween


Rocks of Alabaster and
great Woods, meets with 
Duina.

From 
Colmogro
 to 
Vstiug
 are 500
versts or little miles, an ancient
City upon the Confluence of 
Iu∣ga,

and 
Sucana
 into 
Duina
 which
there first receives his name.
Thence continuing by water to

Wologda;
 a great City so nam'd
of the River which passes through
the midst; it hath a Castle wall'd
about with Brick and Stone, and
many wooden Churches, two for
every Parish, the one in Winter
to be heated, the other us'd in
Summer; this is a Town of much
Traffick a 1000 miles from Saint

Nicholas.
 All this way by water
no lodging is to be had but un∣der
open Sky by the River side,
and other provision onely what
they bring with them. From 
Wo∣logda

by 
Sled
 they go to 
Yeraslave

on the 
Volga,
 whose breadth is
there at least a mile over; and
thence runs 2700 versts to the 
Ca∣spian



Sea,
 having his head Spring
out of 
Bealozera,
 which is a Lake,

amidst whereof is built a strong
Tower wherein the Kings of 
Mos∣covy

reserve their Treasure in
time of War. From this Town
to 
Rostove,
 then to 
Pereslave
 a
great Town situate on a fair
Lake; thence to 
Mosco.


Between 
Yeraslave
 and 
Mosco

which is 200 miles, the Country
is so fertile, so populous and full of
Villages, that in a forenoon 7 or
800 
Sleds
 are usually seen com∣ing
with Salt Fish,
 or laden back
with Corn.


Mosco
 the chief City, lying in
55 degrees, distant from Saint

Nicholas
 1500 miles, is reputed
to be greater than 
London
 with
the Suburbs,
 but rudely built,
their Houses and Churches most
of Timber, few of Stone, their
Streets unpav'd; it hath a fair
Castle four-square, upon a Hill,
two miles about, with Brick


Walls very high, and some say
18 foot thick, 16 Gates, and as
many Bulwarks; in the Castle
are kept the chief Markets, and
in Winter on the River being
then firm Ice. This River 
Mos∣cua

on the south-west side enclo∣ses
the Castle, wherein are nine
fair Churches with round gilded
Towers, and the Emperour's Pa∣lace;
which neither within, nor
without is equal for state to the
King's Houses in 
England
 but ra∣ther
like our Buildings of old
fashion with small Windows,
some of Glass, some with Latices,
or Iron Bars.


They who travail from 
Mosco

to the 
Caspian,
 go by Water
down the 
Moscua
 to the River

Occa;
 then by certain Castles to

Rezan,
 a famous City now rui∣nate;
the 10
th
 day to 
Nysnovo∣grod

where 
Occa
 falls into 
Volga,

which the 
Tartars
 call 
Edel.

From thence the 11
th
 day to 
Ca∣zan



a 
Tartan
 City of great wealth
heretofore, now under the 
Rus∣sian;

wall'd at first with Timber
and Earth, but since by the Em∣perour

Vasiliwich
 with free Stone.
From 
Cazan
 to the River 
Cama

falling into 
Volga
 from the Pro∣vince
of 
Permia,
 the People
dwelling on the left side are 
Gen∣tiles,

and live in Woods without
Houses:
 beyond them to 
Astra∣can,
Tartars
 of 
Mangat,
 and 
Na∣gay;

on the right side those of

Crimme.
 From 
Mosco
 to 
Astra∣can

is about 600 leagues. The
Town is situate in an Island on a
Hill-side wall'd with Earth, but
the Castle with Earth and Tim∣ber;
the Houses except that of
the Governour's, and some few
others, poor and simple; the
Ground utterly barren, and with∣out
Wood: they live there on
Fish, and Sturgeon especially;
which hanging up to dry in the
Streets and Houses brings whole


swarms of Flies, and infection to
the Aire, and oft great Pestilence.
This Island in length 12 leagues,
3 in breadth is the 
Russian
 limit
toward the 
Caspian,
 which he
keeps with a strong Garrison;
being 20 leagues from that Sea
into which 
Volga
 falls at 70
mouths. From Saint 
Nicholas,

or from 
Mosco
 to the 
Caspian

they pass in 46 daies and nights,
most part by Water.


West-ward
 from Saint 
Nicho∣las

1200 miles,
 is the City 
No∣vogrod

58 degrees, the greatest
Mart-town of all this Dominion,
and in bigness not inferior to

Mosco.
 The way thither is
through the western bottom of
Saint 
Nicholas
 Bay, and so along
the Shoar full of dangerous
Rocks to the Monastery 
Solofky,

wherein are at least 200 Monks;
the People thereabout in a man∣ner
Savages, yet Tenants to
those Monks. Thence to the


dangerous River 
Owiga,
 wherein
are Waterfalls as steep as from a
Mountain, and by the violence
of their descent kept from free∣zing;
so that the Boats are to be
carried there a mile over land:
which the Tenants of that Abby
did by command, and were
guides to the Merchants without
taking any reward. Thence to
the Town 
Povensa
 standing with∣in
a mile of the famous Lake

Onega
 320 miles long; and in
some places 70, at narrowest 25
broad, and of great depth. Thence
by some Monasteries to the Ri∣ver

Swire;
 then into the Lake

Ladiscay
 much longer than 
One∣ga:

after which into the River

Volhusky
 which through the midst
of 
Novogrod
 runs into this Lake,
and this Lake into the 
Baltick

sound by 
Narv
 and 
Revel.
 Their
other Cities toward the western
bound are 
Plesco, Smolensko
 on

Vobsco.


The Emperour exerciseth ab∣solute
power:
 if any man die
without male issue,
 his Land re∣turns
to the Emperour. Any rich
man who through age, or other
impotence is unable to serve the
Publick, being inform'd of, is
turn'd out of his Estate, and
forc'd with his Family to live on
a small Pension, while some other
more deserving, is by the Duke's
authority put into possession. The
manner of informing the Duke is
thus. Your Grace, saith one, hath
such a Subject, abounding with
Riches, but for service of the
State unmeet, and you have o∣thers
poor and in want, but well
able to doe their Country good
service. Immediately the Duke
sends forth to enquire, and cal∣ling
the Rich man before him,
Friend, saith he, you have too
much Living, and are unservicea∣ble
to your Prince; less will serve
you, and the rest maintain others


who deserve more. The man
thus call'd to impart his Wealth,
repines not, but humbly answers,
that all he hath is God's, and the
Duke's: as if he made restitution
of what more justly was ano∣thers,
than parted with his own.
Every Gentleman hath rule and
justice over his own Tenants:
if the Tenants of two Gentlemen
agree not, they seek to compose
it, if they cannot, each brings
his Tenant before the high Judge
of that Country. They have no
Lawyers, but every man pleads
his own Cause, or else by Bill or
Answer in writing delivers it
with his own hands to the Duke:
yet Justice by corruption of infe∣riour
Officers is much perverted.
Where other proof is wanting,
they may try the matter by per∣sonal
combat, or by champion.
If a Debtor be poor, he becomes
bondman to the Duke, who lets
out his labour till it pay the dept;


till then he remains in bondage:

another tryal they have by lots.


The Revenues
 of the Empe∣rour
are what he list, and what
his Subjects are able; and he o∣mits
not the coursest means to
raise them: for in every good
Town there is a drunken Tavern,
call'd a 
Cursemay,
 which the Em∣perour
either lets out to farm,
 or
bestowes on some Duke, or Gen∣tleman
in reward of his Service;
who for that time is Lord of the
whole Town, robbing and spoi∣ling
at his pleasure; till being
well enricht, he is sent at his
own charge to the Wars, and
there squeez'd of his ill got
wealth; by which means the
waging of war is to the Empe∣rour
little or nothing chargeable.


The 
Russian
 armeth not less in
time of war than 300 thousand
men;
 half of whom he takes
with him into the Field,
 the rest
bestows in Garrisons on the Bor∣ders.


He presseth no Husband∣man
or Merchant, but the Youth
of the Realm. He useth no Foot,
but such as are Pioners, or Gun∣ners,
of both which sort 30 thou∣sand.
The rest being Horsemen,
are all Archers, and ride with a
short Stirrup after the 
Turkish.

Their Armour is a Coat of Plate,
and a Skull on their Heads. Some
of their Coats are cover'd with
Velvet, or cloth of Gold; for they
desire to be gorgeous in Arms,
but the Duke himself above mea∣sure:
his Pavilion cover'd with
cloth of Gold, or Silver, set with
pretious Stones. They use little
Drums at the Saddle bow instead
of Spurs; for at sound thereof the
Horses run more swiftly.


They fight without order;
 nor
willingly give battail but by stealth or ambush;
 of cold and
hard Diet marvelously patient;
for when the Ground is cover'd
with Snow froz'n a yard thick,


the common Souldier will lie in
the Field two months together
without Tent, or covering over
head; onely hangs up his Man∣tle
against that part from whence
the Weather drives, and kindling
a little fire, lies him down be∣fore
it, with his Back under the
Wind: his Drink, the cold Stream
mingl'd with Oat-meal, and the
same all his Food: his Horse fed
with Green Wood and Bark,
stands all this while in the open
Field, yet does his service. The
Emperour gives no pay at all, but
to Strangers; yet repaies good
deserts in war with certain Lands
during life; and they who often∣est
are sent to the wars, think
themselves most favour'd,
 though
serving without Wages. On the
12
th
 of 
December
 yearly the Em∣perour
rides into the Field which
is without the City, with all his
Nobility on Jennets and Turky
Horses in great state: before him


5000 Harquebusiers, who shoot
at a bank of Ice till they beat it
down, the Ordnance, which they
have very fair of all sorts, they
plant against two wooden Houses
fill'd with earth at least 30 foot
thick, and beginning with the
smallest, shoot them all off thrice
over, having beat those two Hou∣ses
flat. Above the rest 6 great
Cannon they have, whose Bullet is
a yard high, so that a man may
see it flying; then out of Mor∣ter-pieces
they shoot wild-fire in∣to
the Aire. Thus the Emperour
having seen what his Gunners
can doe, returns home in the
same order.


They follow the 
Greek
 Church,

but with excess of Superstitions;

their Service is in the 
Russian

Tongue. They hold the Ten
Commandments not to concern
them, saying that God gave them
under the Law, which 
Christ
 by
his death on the Cross hath abro∣gated:


the Eucharist they re∣ceive
in both kinds; they ob∣serve
4 Lents,
 have Service in
their Churches daily, from two
hours before dawn to Evening;
yet for Whordom, Drunkenness
and Extortion none worse than
the Clergy.


They have many great and
rich Monasteries,
 where they
keep great hospitality. That of

Trojetes
 hath in it 700 Friers,
and is wall'd about with Brick
very strongly, having many Pie∣ces
of Brass Ordnance on the
Walls; most of the Lands,
Towns and Villages within 40
miles belong to those Monks,
who are also as great Merchants
as any in the Land. During
Easter Holy-daies when two
Friends meet they take each
other by the hand; one of them
saying, the Lord is risen; the
other answering,
 it is so of a
truth; and then they kiss, whe∣ther


Men or Women. The Em∣perour
esteemeth the Metropoli∣tan
next to God, after our La∣dy,
and Saint 
Nicholas,
 as being
his spiritual Officer, himself but
his temporal.
 But the 
Musco∣vites

that border on 
Tartaria

are yet 
Pagans.


When there is love between
two,
 the Man among other tri∣fling
Gifts,
 sends to the Woman
a Whip, to signify, if she offend,
what the must expect; and it is
a Rule among them, that if the
Wife be not beaten once a week,
she thinks her self not belov'd,
and is the worse; yet are they
very obedient, and stir not forth,
but at some Seasons. Upon ut∣ter
dislike, the Husband divor∣ces;

which Liberty no doubt
they receiv'd first with their Re∣ligion
from the 
Greek
 Church,
and the Imperial Laws.


Their Dead they bury with
new Shooes on their Feet,
 as to


a long Journey;
 and put Letters
testimonial in their Hands to
Saint 
Nicholas,
 or Saint 
Peter,

that this was a 
Russe
 of 
Russes

and dy'd in the true Faith;
which, as they believe, Saint 
Pe∣ter

having read, forthwith ad∣mits
him into Heaven.


They have no Learning,
 nor
will suffer to be among them;

their greatest friendship is in
drinking; they are great Tal∣kers,
Lyars, Flatterers and Dis∣semblers.
They delight in gross
Meats and noysom Fish; their
Drink is better, being sundry
sorts of Meath; the best made
with Juice of a sweet and crim∣son
Berry call'd 
Maliena,
 grow∣ing
also in 
France;
 other sorts
with Black-cherry, or divers o∣ther
Berries: another Drink they
use in the Spring drawn from
the Birch-tree Root, whose Sap
after 
Iune
 dries up. But there is
no People that live so miserably


as the Poor of 
Russia;
 if they
have Straw and Water they
make shift to live; for Straw
dry'd and stampt in Winter time
is their Bread; in Summer Grass
and Roots; at all times Bark of
Trees is good Meat with them;
yet many of them die in the
Street for hunger, none relieving,
or regarding them.


When they are sent into Fo∣reign
Countries,
 or that Strangers
come thither,
 they are very
sumptuous in apparel, else the
Duke himself goes but meanly.


In Winter they travail
 onely
upon Sleds,
 the Wayes being
hard, and smooth with Snow,
the Rivers all froz'n: one Horse
with a Sled will draw a man
400 miles in 3 daies; in Sum∣mer
the way is deep, and tra∣vailing
ill. The 
Russe
 of better
sort goes not out in Winter, but
on his Sled; in Summer on his
Horse: in his Sled he sits on a


Carpet, or a white Bears Skin;
the Sled drawn with a Horse
well deckt, with many Fox or
Wolve Tayles about his Neck,
guided by a Boy on his Back,
other Servants riding on the
tayle of the Sled.


The 
Russian
 Sea breeds a cer∣tain
Beast
 which they call a
Morse;
 who seeks his Food on
the Rocks, climing up with help
of his Teeth; whereof they
make as great account, as we
of the Elephant's Tooth.








CHAP. II.


Of Samoedia, Siberia, and other
Countries north-east subject to
the Muscovites.


NOrth-east of 
Russia
 lieth 
Sa∣moedia

by the River 
Ob.

This Country was first disco∣ver'd
by 
Oneke
 a 
Russian;
 who
first trading privately among
them in rich Furrs got great
Wealth, and the knowledge of
their Country; then reveal'd his
discovery to 
Boris
 Protectour to

Pheodor,
 shewing how beneficial
that Country gain'd, would be
to the Empire. Who sending
Ambassadours among them gal∣lantly
attir'd, by fair means won
their subjection to the Empire;
every Head paying yearly two
Skins of richest Sables. Those Mes∣sengers
travailing also 200 leagues


beyond 
Ob
 east-ward, made re∣port
of pleasant Countries, aboun∣ding
with Woods and Fountains,
and People riding on Elks and
Loshes, others drawn on Sleds
by Rain-deer, others by Dogs as
swift as Deer. The 
Somoeds
 that
came along with those Messen∣gers
returning to 
Mosco
 admir'd
the stateliness of that City, and
were as much admir'd for excel∣lent
Shooters, hitting every time
the breadth of a penny, as far
distant as hardly could be dis∣cern'd.


The River 
Ob
 is reported by
the 
Russes
 to be in breadth the
sayling of a Summer's day:
 but
full of Islands and Shoals,
 having
neither Woods, nor, till of late,
Inhabitants. Out of 
Ob
 they
turn into the River 
Tawze.
 The

Russians
 have here, since the 
Sa∣moeds

yielded them subjection,
two Governours with 3 or 400
Gunners; have built Villages


and some small Castles; all
which Place they call 
Mongozey,

or 
Molgomzay,
 Further up-land
they have also built other Cities
of Wood,
 consisting chiefly of

Poles, Tartars
 and 
Russes,
 fugi∣tive
or condemned men; as 
Ver∣gateria,
Siber,
 whence the whole
Country is nam'd,
 
Tinna,
 thence

Tobolsca
 on this side 
Ob,
 on the
Rivers 
Irtis,
 and 
Tobol,
 chief
Seat of the 
Russian
 Governour;
above that, 
Zergolta
 in an Island
of 
Ob,
 where they have a Cu∣stom
house, beyond that on the
other side 
Ob, Narim,
 and 
Tooi∣na

now a great City.
 Certain
Churches also are erected in
those Parts; but no man forc'd
to Religion; beyond 
Narim
 east∣ward
on the River 
Telta
 is built
the Castle of 
Comgoscoi,
 and all
this Plantation began since the
year 1590. with many other
Towns like these. And these
are the Countries from whence


come all the Sables and rich
Furrs.


The 
Samoeds
 have no Towns,

or certain place of abode,
 but
up and down where they find
Moss for their Deer; they live
in companies peaceably, and are
govern'd by some of the Ancien∣test
amongst them, but are Ido∣laters.
They shoot wondrous
cunningly; their Arrow heads
are sharpned Stones, or Fish∣bones,
which latter serve them
also for Needles, their Thread
being the Sinews of certain small
Beasts, wherewith they sowe the
Furrs which cloath them; the
furry side in Summer outward,
in Winter inward. They have
many Wives, and their Daugh∣ters
they sell to him who bids
most; which, if they be not
lik't, are turn'd back to their
Friends, the Husband allowing
onely to the Father what the
marriage Feast stood him in.


Wives are brought to bed there
by their Husbands, and the next
day go about as before. They
till not the Ground; but live on
the Flesh of those Wild Beasts
which they hunt. They are the
onely Guides to such as travaile

Iougoria, Siberia,
 or any of those
north-east parts in Winter; being
drawn on Sleds with Bucks, ri∣ding
post day and night, if it be
Moon-light; and lodge on the
Snow under Tents of Deer Skins
in whatever place they find
enough of white Moss to feed
their Sled Staggs, turning them
loose to dig it up themselves out
of the deep Snow: another 
Sa∣moede

stepping to the next Wood,
brings in store of Firing; round
about which they lodge within
their Tents, leaving the top
open to vent Smoak; in which
manner they are as warm as
the Stoves in 
Russia.
 They car∣ry
Provision of Meat with them,


and partake besides of what Fowle
or Venison the 
Samoede
 kills with
shooting by the way; their Drink
is melted Snow. Two Deer be∣ing
yoak'd to a Sled riding post
will draw 200 miles in 24 hours
without resting, and laden with
their Stuff will draw it 30 miles
in 12.






CHAP. III.


Of Tingoesia, and the Countries
adjoyning eastward, as far as
Cathay.


BEyond 
Narim
 and 
Comgoscoi

the Souldiers of those Gar∣risons
travailing by appointment
of the 
Russian
 Governour in the
year 1605.
 found many goodly
Countries not inhabited;
 many
vast Deserts, and Rivers, till at
the end of ten weeks they spy'd


certain Cottages, and Herds,
or companies of People, which
came to them with reverent be∣haviour,
and signify'd to the 
Sa∣moeds

and 
Tartars,
 which were
Guides to the 
Russian
 Souldiers,
that they were call'd 
Tingoesi;

that their dwelling was on the
great River 
Ienissey.
 This Ri∣ver
is said to be far bigger than

Ob;
 distant from the Mouth
thereof 4 daies and nights say∣ling;

and likewise falls into the
Sea of 
Naramzie;
 it hath high
Mountains on the East,
 some of
which cast out Fire, to the West
a plain and fertil Country, which
in the Spring time it overflowes
about 70 leagues;
 all that time
the Inhabitants keep them in the
Mountains,
 and then return with
their Cattel to the Plain. The

Tingoesi
 are a very gentle Nation,
they have great swoln Throats
like those in 
Italy
 that live under
the 
Alpes;
 at perswasion of the



Samoeds
 they forthwith submit∣ted
to the 
Russian
 Government;
and at their request travailing the
next year to discover still east∣ward,
they came at length to a
River, which the Savages of that
place call'd 
Pisida,
 somewhat less
than 
Ienissey;
 beyond which
hearing ofttimes the towling of
Brazen Bells, and sometimes the
noise of Men and Horses, they
durst not pass over; they saw
there certain Sayles afar off,
square, and therefore suppos'd to
be like 
Indian
 or 
China
 Sayles, and
the rather for that they report
that great Guns have been heard
shot off from those Vessels. In

April,
 and 
May
 they were much
delighted with the fair prospect
of that Country, replenish't with
many rare Trees, Plants and
Flowers, Beasts and Fowle.
Some think here to be the
Borders of 
Tangut
 in the north
of 
Cathay.
 Some of those 
Sa∣moeds



about the Year 1610. tra∣vail'd
so far till they came in
view of a White City; and heard
a great din of Bells,
 and report
there came to them Men all arm'd
in Iron from head to foot. And
in the Year 1611. divers out of

Cathay,
 and others from 
Alteen
Czar
 who stiles himself the golden
King, came and traded at 
Zergol∣ta,

or 
Surgoot
 on the River 
Ob,

bringing with them Plates of Sil∣ver.
Whereupon 
Michael Pheo∣dorowick

the 
Russian
 Emperour in
the Year 1619. sent certain of
his People from 
Tooma
 to 
Alteen,

and 
Cathay,
 who return'd with
Ambassadours from those Princes.
These relate,
 that from 
Tooma
 in
ten daies and a half, three daies
whereof over a Lake, where Ru∣bies
and Saphirs grow, they came
to the 
Alteen
 King, or King of

Alty;
 through his Land in five
weeks they pass'd into the Coun∣try
of 
Sheromugaly
 or 
Mugalla,



where reigned a Queen call'd

Manchika;
 whence in four daies
they came to the Borders of 
Ca∣thay,

fenc't with a stone Wall,
15 fathom high; along the side of
which, having on the other hand
many pretty Towns belonging
to Queen 
Manchika,
 they travail'd
ten daies without seeing any on
the Wall till they came to the
Gate. Where they saw very
great Ordnance lying, and 3000
men in watch. They traffick
with other Nations at the Gate,
and very few at once are suffe∣red
to enter. They were tra∣vailing
from 
Tooma
 to this Gate
12 weeks; and from thence to
the great City of 
Cathay
 ten
daies. Where being conducted
to the House of Ambassadours,
within a few daies there came a
Secretary from King 
Tambur
 with
200 Men well apparell'd, and ri∣ding
on Asses, to feast them with
divers sorts of Wine, and to de∣mand


their Message; but having
brought no Presents with them,
they could not be admitted to his
sight; onely with his Letter to
the Emperour they return'd as is
aforesaid, to 
Tobolsca.
 They re∣port
that the Land of 
Mugalla

reaches from 
Boghar
 to the north
Sea,
 and hath many Castles built
of Stone four-square, with Tow∣ers
at the Corners cover'd with
glazed Tiles; and on the Gates
Alarum-Bells or Watch-Bells twen∣ty
pound weight of Metal; their
Houses built also of Stone, the
Seelings cunningly painted with
Flowers of all Colours. The Peo∣ple
are Idolaters; the Country
exceeding fruitfull. They have
Asses and Mules, but no Horses.
The People of 
Cathay
 say that
this great Wall stretches from

Boghar
 to the north Sea four
months journey with continual
Towers a flight-shot distant from
each other, and Beacons on every


Tower; and that this Wall is
the bound between 
Mugalla
 and

Cathay.
 In which are but five
Gates; those narrow, and so
low, that a Horse-man sitting
upright cannot ride in. Next
to the Wall is the City 
Shiro∣kalga;

it hath a Castle well fur∣nish't
with short Ordnance, and
small Shot, which they who
keep watch on the Gates, Tow∣ers
and Walls, duly at Sun set
and rising discharge thrice over.
The City abounds with rich
Merchandize, Velvets, Damasks,
Cloth of Gold and Tissue, with
many sorts of Sugars. Like to
this is the City 
Tara,
 their Mar∣kets
smell odoriferously with Spi∣ces,
and 
Tayth
 more rich than
that. 
Shirooan
 yet more mag∣nificent,
half a day's journey
through, and exceeding popu∣lous.
From hence to 
Cathaia

the imperial City is two daies
journey, built of White-stone


four-square, in circuit four daies
going, corner'd with four White
Towers, very high and great,
and others very fair along the
Wall, white intermingl'd with
blew, and Loop-holes furnisht
with Ordnance. In midst of
this White City stands a Castle
built of Magnet, where the King
dwels, in a sumptuous Palace,
the top whereof is overlaid with
Gold. The City stands on even
ground encompass'd with the Ri∣ver

Youga,
 7 daies journey from
the Sea. The People are very
fair, but not warlike, delighting
most in rich Traffick. These
Relations are referr'd hither, be∣cause
we have them from 
Russi∣ans;

who report also,
 that there
is a Sea beyond 
Ob
 so warm that
all kind of Sea-Fowl live therea∣bout
as well in Winter as in Sum∣mer.
Thus much briefly of the
Sea and Lands between 
Russia,

and 
Cathay.








CHAP. IV.


The Succession of Moscovia
Dukes and Emperours taken out of
their Chronicles by a Polack
with some later Additions.


THE great Dukes of 
Musco∣vy

derive their Pedegree,
though without ground, from

Augustus Caesar:
 whom they fa∣ble
to have sent certain of his
Kindred to be Governours over
many remote Provinces; and a∣mong
them, 
Prussus
 over 
Prussia;

him to have had his Seat on the
eastern 
Baltick
 Shoar by the Ri∣ver

Wixel;
 of whom 
Rurek, Si∣naus,

and 
Truuor
 descended by
the Fourth Generation, were by
the 
Russians
 living then without
Civil Government sent for in the
Year 573.
 to bear rule over
them; at the perswasion of 
Go∣stomislius



chief Citizen of 
Novo∣grod.

They therefore taking
with them 
Olechus
 their Kins∣man
divided those Countries a∣mong
themselves, and each in his
Province taught them Civil Go∣vernment.


Ivorson
 of 
Rurek,
 the rest dy∣ing
without Issue, became Suc∣cessour
to them all; being left in
nonage under the protection of

Olechus.
 He took to wife 
Olha

Daughter to a Citizen of 
Plesco;

of whom he begat 
Stoslaus;
 but
after that, being slain by his E∣nemies,

Olha
 his Wife went to

Constantinople,
 and was there
baptiz'd 
Helena.


Stoslaus
 fought many Battails
with his Enemies; but was at
length by them slain, who made
a Cup of his Scull engrav'n with
this Sentence in Gold; Seeking
after other Mens he lost his own
His Sons were 
Teropolchus, Ole∣ga

and 
Volodimir.


Volodimir
 having slain the o∣ther
two, made himself sole
Lord of 
Russia;
 yet after that
fact enclining to Christian Reli∣gion,
had to wife 
Anna
 Si∣ster
of 
Basilius
 and 
Constantine
Greek
 Emperours; and with all
his People in the Year 988.

was baptiz'd, and call'd 
Basilius.

Howbeit 
Zonaras
 reporteth that
before that time 
Basilius
 the

Greek
 Emperour sent a Bishop
to them; at whose preaching
they not being mov'd, but re∣quiring
a Miracle, he, after de∣vout
Prayers, taking the Book
of Gospel into his hands, threw
it before them all into the Fire:
which remaining there uncon∣sum'd,
they were converted.


Volodimir
 had eleven Sons a∣mong
whom he divided his
Kingdom; 
Boristus
 and 
Glebus

for their holy Life register'd
Saints; and their Feast kept eve∣ry
year in 
November
 with great


solemnity. The rest through
contention to have the sole Go∣vernment,
ruin'd each other;
leaving onely 
Iaroslaus
 inheritour
of all.


Volodimir
 Son of 
Iaroslaus

kept his Residence in the ancient
City 
Kiow
 upon the River 
Bori∣stenes.

And after many conflicts
with the Sons of his Uncles; and
having subdu'd all was call'd

Monomachus.
 He made war with

Constantine
 the 
Greek
 Emperour,
wasted 
Thracia,
 and returning
home with great spoils to prepare
new war, was appeas'd by 
Con∣stantine,

who sent 
Neophytus
 Bi∣shop
of 
Ephesus,
 and 
Eustathius

Abbot of 
Ierusalem,
 to present
him with part of our Saviour's
Cross, and other rich Gifts, and
to salute him by the name of

Czar,
 or 
Caesar:
 with whom he
thenceforth enter'd into league
and amity.


After him in order of des∣cent

Vuszevolodus, George, De∣metrius.


Then 
George,
 his Son, who
in the Year 1237.
 was slain in
battail by the 
Tartar
 Prince 
Ba∣thy,

who subdu'd 
Muscovia
 and
made it tributary. From that
time the 
Tartarians
 made such
Dukes of 
Russia,
 as they thought
would be most pliable to their
ends; of whom they requir'd, as
oft as Ambassadours came to him
out of 
Tartary,
 to go out and
meet them; and in his own
Court to stand bare-headed,
while they sate and deliver'd
their Message. At which time
the 
Tartars
 wasted also 
Polonia,
Silesia,
 and 
Hungaria,
 till Pope

Innocent
 the Fourth obtain'd peace
of them for 5 years. This 
Ba∣thy,

say the 
Russians,
 was the
Father of 
Tamerlan,
 whom they
call 
Temirkutla.


Then succeeded 
Iaroslaus
 the
Brother of 
George,
 then 
Alexan∣der

his Son.


Daniel
 the Son of 
Alexander

was he who first made the City
of 
Mosco
 his Royal Seat, builded
the Castle, and took on him the
Title of great Duke.


Iohn
 the Son of 
Daniel
 was
sirnamed 
Kaleta,
 that word sig∣nifying
a Scrip, out of which,
continually carried about with
him, he was wont to deal his
Almes.


His Son 
Simeon
 dying without
Issue left the Kingdom to 
Iohn

his next Brother; and he to his
Son 
Demetrius,
 who left two Sons,

Basilius
 and 
George.


Basilius
 reigning had a Son of
his own name, but doubting lest
not of his own Body, through
the suspicion he had of his Wife's
Chastity, him he disinherits, and
gives the Dukedom to his Bro∣ther

George.


George
 putting his Nephew 
Basi∣lius

in prison, reigns; yet at his
death, either through remorse,
or other cause surrenders him
the Dukedom.


Basilius
 unexpectedly thus at∣taining
his supposed right, en∣joy'd
it not long in quiet; for

Andrew
 and 
Demetrius
 the two
Sons of 
George
 counting it injury
not to succeed their Father, made
war upon him, and surprizing
him on a suddain, put out his
Eyes. Notwithstanding which,
the 
Boiarens,
 or Nobles kept
their allegiance to the Duke
though blind, whom therefore
they call'd 
Cziemnox.


Iohn Vasiliwich
 his Son was
the first who brought the 
Russian

Name out of obscurity into re∣nown.
To secure his own Estate
he put to death as many of his
kindred as were likely to pre∣tend;
and stil'd himself great
Duke of 
Wolodimiria, Muscovia,


Novogardia, Czar
 of all 
Russia.

He won 
Plesco
 the onely walled
City in all 
Muscovy,
 and 
Novo∣grod

the richest, from the 
Litua∣nians,

to whom they had been
subject 50 years before; and
from the latter carried home
300 Waggons laden with Trea∣sure.
He had war with 
Alexan∣der

King of 
Poland,
 and with the

Livonians;
 with him, on pre∣tence
of withdrawing his Daugh∣ter

Helena,
 whom he had to
wife, from the 
Greek
 Church to
the 
Romish;
 with the 
Livonians

for no other cause, but to en∣large
his Bounds: though he
were often foyl'd by 
Pletteber∣gius

great Master of the 
Prussian

Knights. His Wife was Daugh∣ter
to the Duke of 
Tyversky;
 of
her he begat 
Iohn,
 and to him
resigned his Dukedom; giving
him to wife the Daughter of 
Ste∣ven,

Palatine of 
Moldavia;
 by
whom he had Issue 
Demetrius,



and deceas'd soon after. 
Vasili∣wich

therefore reassuming the
Dukedom married a second Wife

Sophia
 Daughter to 
Thomas Pa∣laeologus:

who is said to have re∣ceiv'd
her Dowry out of the
Pope's Treasury, upon promise
of the Duke to become 
Romish.


This Princess of a haughty
mind, often complaining that she
was married to the 
Tartars
 Vas∣sal,
at length by continual per∣swasions,
and by a wile found
means to ease her Husband, and
his Country of that Yoke. For
whereas till then the 
Tartar
 had
his Procurators, who dwelt in
the very Castle of 
Mosco,
 to over∣see
State-affairs, she fain'd that
from Heaven she had been
warn'd, to build a Temple to
Saint 
Nicholas
 on the same place
where the 
Tartar
 Agents had
their House. Being therefore de∣livered
of a Son, she made it her
request to the Prince of 
Tartary,



whom she had invited to the
baptizing, that he would give
her that House; which obtain∣ing
she raz'd to the ground; and
remov'd those Overseers out of
the Castle: and so by degrees
dispossess'd them of all, which
they held in 
Russia.
 She pre∣vail'd
also with her Husband to
transfer the Dukedom from 
De∣metrius

the Son of 
Iohn
 de∣ceas'd,
to 
Gabriel
 his eldest by
her.


Gabriel
 no sooner Duke, but
chang'd his name to 
Basilius,

and set his mind to doe nobly;
he recover'd great part of 
Mus∣covy▪

from 
Vitoldus
 Duke of 
Li∣tuania;

and on the 
Boristhenes

won 
Smolensko
 and many other
Cities in the Year 1514.
 He
divorc'd his first Wife, and of

Helena
 Daughter to Duke 
Glin∣sky

begat 
Iuan Vasiliwich.


Iuan Vasiliwich
 being left a
Child was committed to 
George



his Unkle and Protector; at 25
years of age he vanquish'd the

Tartars
 of 
Cazan
 and 
Astracan,

bringing home with him their
Princes captive; made cruel war
in 
Livonia
 pretending right of
inheritance. He seem'd excee∣dingly
devout, and whereas the

Russians
 in their Churches use
out of zeal and reverence to
knock their Heads against the
ground, his Forehead was seldom
free of swellings and bruzes, and
very often seen to bleed. The
cause of his rigour in government,
he alledg'd to be the malice and
treachery of his Subjects. But
some of the Nobles incited by
his cruelty,
 call'd in the Crim

Tartar
 who in the Year 1571.

broke into 
Russia,
 burnt 
Mosco

to the ground: he reigned 54
years; had three Sons, of which
the eldest being strook on a time
by his Father, with grief thereof
dy'd; his other Sons were 
Pheo∣dor



and 
Demetrius:
 in the time
of 
Iuan Vasiliwich
 the 
English

came first by Sea into the north
parts of 
Russia.


Pheodor Iuanowick
 being un∣der
age was left to the protec∣tion
of 
Boris
 Brother to the
young Empress,
 and third Son
by adoption in the Emperour's
Will.
 After 40 daies of mour∣ning,

the appointed time of Co∣ronation
being come, the Empe∣rour
issuing out of his Palace,
the whole Clergy before him,
enter'd with his Nobility the
Church of 
Blaueshina
 or blessed∣ness;
whence after Service to
the Church of 
Michael,
 then to
our Lady Church being the Ca∣thedral.
In midst whereof a
Chair of Majesty was plac'd,
and most unvaluable Garments
put upon him: there also was
the imperial Crown set on his
Head by the Metropolitan, who
out of a small Book in his hand


read Exhortations to the Empe∣rour,
of justice and peaceable
government. After this rising
from his Chair he was invested
with an upper Robe, so thick
with Orient Pearls and Stones
as weigh'd 200 pounds, the
Train born up by 6 Dukes; his
Staff imperial was of a Unicorn's
Horn three foot and a half long,
beset with rich Stones: his
Globe, and six Crowns carried
before him by Princes of the
Bloud: his Horse at the Church
door stood ready with a Cove∣ring
of imbroidered Pearl, Saddle
and all suitable to the value of
300 thousand Marks. There
was a kind of Bridge made
three waies, 150 fathom long,
three foot high, two fathom
broad, whereon the Emperour
with his Train went from one
Church to another above the
infinite throng of People making
loud Acclamations; At the Em∣perour's


returning from those
Churches they were spread un∣der-foot,
with Cloth of Gold,
the Porches with Red Velvet,
the Bridges with Scarlet and
Stammel-cloth, all which, as the
Emperour pass'd by, were cut
and snatch't by them that stood
next; besides new minted Coines
of Gold and Silver cast among
the People. The Empress in her
Palace was plac't before a great
open Window in rich and shi∣ning
Robes, among her Ladies.
After this the Emperour came
into Parliament, where he had a
Banquet serv'd by his Nobles in
princely order; two standing on
either side his Chair with Battel∣axes
of Gold; three of the next
Roomes great and large being
set round with Plate of Gold
and Silver, from the ground up
to the roof. This Triumph la∣sted
a week, wherein many roy∣al
Pastimes were seen: after


which, election was made of the
Nobles to new Offices and Dig∣nities.
The conclusion of all was
a Peal of 170 Brass Ordnance
two miles without the City, and
20000 Harquebuzes twice over:
and so the Emperour with at
least 50 thousand Horse return'd
through the City to his Palace:
where all the Nobility, Officers,
and Merchants brought him rich
Presents. Shortly after, the Em∣perour
by direction of 
Boris
 con∣quer'd
the large Country of 
Si∣beria,

and took Prisoner the
King thereof: he remov'd also
corrupt Officers and former
Taxes. In sum, a great altera∣tion
in the Government follow'd,
yet all quietly, and without tu∣mult.
These things reported
abroad strook such awe into
the neighbour Kings, that the
Crim 
Tartar
 with his Wives al∣so
and many Nobles valiant and
personable men came to visit


the 
Russian.
 There came also
12 hundred 
Polish
 Gentlemen,
many 
Circassians,
 and People of
other Nations to offer service;
Ambassadours from the 
Turk,

the 
Persian, Georgian,
 and other

Tartar
 Princes; from 
Almany,
Poland, Sweden, Denmark.
 But
this glory lasted not long
through the treachery of 
Boris,

who procur'd the death first of

Demetrius,
 then of the Empe∣rour
himself, whereby the im∣perial
Race after the succession
of 300 years was quite extin∣guish't.


Boris,
 adopted, as before was
said, third Son to 
Iuan Vasili∣wich

without impeachment now
ascended the Throne; but nei∣ther
did he enjoy long, what he
had so wickedly compass'd;
 Di∣vine
revenge raising up against
him a Counterfeit of that 
Deme∣trius

whom he had caus'd to be
murthered at 
Ouglets.
 This Up∣start


strength'd with many 
Poles

and 
Cossacks
 appears in arms to
claim his right out of the hands
of 
Boris,
 who sent against him
an Army of 200 thousand Men;
many of whom revolted to this

Demetrius: Peter Basman
 the
General returning to 
Mosco
 with
the empty Triumph of a repor∣ted
Victory. But the Enemy
still advancing, 
Boris
 one day,
after a plentifull Meal finding
himself heavy and pain'd in his
Stomach laid him down on his
Bed; but 'ere his Doctours, who
made great haste, came to him,
was found speechless, and soon
after dy'd, with grief, as is sup∣pos'd,
of his ill success against

Demetrius.
 Before his death,
though it were speedy, he would
be shorn, and new christn'd. He
had but one Son, whom he lov'd
so fondly, as not to suffer him
out of sight; using to say he
was Lord and Father of his Son,


and yet his Servant, yea his
Slave. To gain the Peoples
love, which he had lost by his
ill getting the Empire, he us'd
two Policies; first he caus'd

Mosco
 to be fir'd in four places,
that in the quenching thereof he
might shew his great care and
tenderness of the People; among
whom he likewise distributed so
much of his Bounty, as both
new-built their Houses, and re∣pair'd
their Losses. At another
time the People murmuring,
that the great Pestilence which
had then swept away a third
part of the Nation, was the pu∣nishment
of their electing him, a
Murtherer, to reign over them,
he built Galleries round about
the utmost Wall of 
Mosco;
 and
there appointed for one whole
month 20 thousand pound to be
given to the Poor; which well
nigh stopt their Mouths. After
the death of 
Boris, Peter Basman



their onely hope and refuge,
though a Young man, was sent
again to the Wars, with him
many 
English, Scots, French

and 
Dutch;
 who all with the o∣ther
General 
Goleeche
 sell off to
the new 
Demetrius;
 whose Mes∣sengers
coming now to the Sub∣urbs
of 
Mosco,
 were brought by
the Multitude to that spatious
Field before the Castle Gate;
within which the Council were
then sitting; many of whom
were by the Peoples threatning
call'd out and constrain'd to hear
the Letters of 
Demetrius
 openly
read: which, long 'ere the end,
wrought so with the Multitude,
that furiously they broke into
the Castle, laying violence on
all they met; when strait ap∣pear'd
coming towards them two
Messengers of 
Demetrius
 former∣ly
sent, pittifully whipt and roa∣sted,
which added to their rage.
Then was the whole City in an


uproar, all the great Counselours
Houses ransack't, especially of
the 
Godonova
's the Kindred and
Family of 
Boris.
 Such of the
Nobles that were best belov'd,
by entreaty prevail'd at length
to put an end to this Tumult.
The Empress flying to a safer
place had her Collar of Pearl
pull'd from her Neck; and by
the next Message command was
given to secure her with her Son
and Daughter. Whereupon 
De∣metrius

by general consent was
proclaim'd Emperour. The Em∣press
now seeing all lost, coun∣sel'd
the Prince her Son to fol∣low
his Father's example; who,
it seems, had dispatch't himself
by Poyson; and with a despe∣rate
courage beginning the dead∣ly
Health, was pledg'd effectual∣ly
by her Son; but the Daugh∣ter
onely sipping, escap'd. O∣thers
ascribe this deed to the se∣cret
Command of 
Demetrius,



and Self-murther imputed to
them, to avoid the envy of such
a Command.


Demetrius Evanowich,
 for so
he call'd himself,
 who succeeded,
was credibly reported the Son of

Gregory Peupoloy
 a 
Russe
 Gentle∣man,
and in his younger years
to have been shorn a Fryar; but
escaping from the Monastery, to
have travail'd 
Germany
 and other
Countries, but chiefly 
Poland:

where he attain'd to good suffici∣ency
in Arms and other Experi∣ence;
which rais'd in him such
high thoughts, as grounding on
a common belief among the 
Rus∣sians,

that the young 
Demetrius

was not dead, but convey'd away,
and their hatred against 
Boris,

on this foundation with some
other circumstances, to build his
hopes no lower than an Empire;
which on his first discovery found
acceptation so generally, as planted
him at length on the Royal Seat;


but not so firmly as the fair be∣ginning
promis'd; for in a short
while the 
Russians
 finding them∣selves
abus'd by an Impostor,
on the sixth day after his marri∣age▪
observing when his Guard
of 
Poles
 were most secure, rush∣ing
into the Palace before break
of day, drag'd him out of his
Bed, and when he had confes'd
the fraud, pull'd him to pieces;
with him 
Peter Basman
 was al∣so
slain, and both their dead Bo∣dies
laid open in the Market-place.
He was of no presence,
but otherwise of a princely dis∣position;
too bountifull, which
occasion'd some exactions; in o∣ther
matters a great lover of ju∣stice,
not unworthy the Empire
which he had gotten, and lost
onely through greatness of mind,
neglecting the Conspiracy, which
he knew the 
Russians
 were plot∣ting.
Some say their hatred
grew, for that they saw him


alienated from the 
Russian
 Man∣ners
and Religion, having made

Buchinskoy
 a learned Protestant
his Secretary. Some report from

Gilbert
's relation, who was a

Scot,
 and Captain, of his Guard,
that lying on his Bed awake,
not long before the Conspiracy,
he saw the appearance of an aged
man coming toward him; at
which he rose, and call'd to
them that watch'd; but they
denied to have seen any such
pass by them. He returning to
his Bed, and within an hour af∣ter
troubl'd again with the same
Apparition, sent for 
Buchinskoy,

telling him he had now twice
the same night seen an aged man,
who at his second coming told
him, that though he were a good
Prince of himself, yet for the in∣justice
and oppression of his infe∣riour
Ministers, his Empire should
be taken from him. The Secre∣tary
counsell'd him to embrace


true Religion, affirming that for
lack thereof, his Officers were so
corrupt. The Emperour seem'd
to be much mov'd, and to intend
what was perswaded him. But
a few daies after, the other Se∣cretary,
a 
Russian,
 came to him
with a drawn Sword; of which
the Emperour made slight at
first; but he after bold words as∣saulted
him, strait seconded by
other Conspiratours crying liber∣ty.

Gilbert
 with many of the
Guard oversuddenly surpris'd re∣treated
to 
Coluga
 a Town which
they fortify'd; most of the other
Strangers were massacr'd, except
the 
English,
 whose mediation
sav'd also 
Buchinskoy. Shusky

who succeeded him reports in a
Letter to King 
Iames
 otherwise
of him; that his right name was

Gryshca
 the Son of 
Boughdan;

that to escape punishment for
Villanies done, he turn'd Fryar,
and fell at last to the Black art;


and fearing that the Metropoli∣tan
intended therefore to impri∣son
him, fled into 
Lettow;
 where
by counsel of 
Sigismund
 the 
Po∣land

King, he began to call him∣self

Demetry
 of 
Ouglitts;
 and by
many Libels and Spies privily
sent into 
Mosco,
 gave out the
same; that many Letters and
Messengers thereupon were sent
from 
Boris
 into 
Poland,
 and from
the Patriarch, to acquaint them
who the Runnagate was; but
the 
Polanders,
 giving them no
credit, furnish't him the more
with Arms and Money, not∣withstanding
the League; and
sent the Palatine 
Sandamersko

and other Lords to accompany
him into 
Russia,
 gaining also a
Prince of the Crim 
Tartars
 to
his aide; that the Army of 
Boris

hearing of his sudden death,
yielded to this 
Gryshca,
 who ta∣king
to wife the Daughter of

Sandamersko,
 attempted to root


out the 
Russian
 Clergy, and to
bring in the 
Romish
 Religion,
for which purpose many Jesuits
came along with him. Where∣upon

Shusky
 with the Nobles and
Metropolitans conspiring against
him, in half a year gather'd all
the Forces of 
Moscovia,
 and sur∣prising
him found in writing un∣der
his own hand all these his
Intentions; Letters also from the
Pope and Cardinals to the same
effect, not onely to set up the
Religion of 
Rome,
 but to force
it upon all, with death to them
that refus'd.


Vasily Evanowich Shusky
 after
the slaughter of 
Demetry
 or 
Grysh∣ca

was elected Emperour;
 having
not long before been at the Block
for reporting to have seen the
true 
Demetrius
 dead and buried;
but 
Gryshca
 not onely recall'd
him, but advanc'd him, to be
the instrument of his own ruine.
He was then about the age of


50; nobly descended, never mar∣ried,
of great wisedom reputed,
a favourer of the 
English;
 for he
sav'd them from ritling in the
former Tumults. Some say he
modestly refus'd the Crown,
 till
by lot four times together it fell
to him;
 yet after that,
 growing
jealous of his Title, remov'd by
Poyson, and other means all the
Nobles that were like to stand
his Rivals; and is said to have
consulted with Witches of the

Samoeds, Lappians
 and 
Tartari∣ans,

about the same fears; and
being warn'd of one 
Michalowich,

to have put to death three of
that name; yet a fourth was re∣serv'd
by fate to succeed him;
being then a Youth attendant in
the Court, one of those that held
the golden Axes, and least suspec∣ted.
But before that time he al∣so
was supplanted by another re∣viving

Demetrius
 brought in by
the 
Poles;
 whose counterfeited


Hand, and strange relating of
privatest Circumstances had al∣most
deceiv'd 
Gilbert
 himself;
had not their persons been utter∣ly
unlike; but 
Gryshca
's Wife so
far believ'd him for her Hus∣band,
as to receive him to her
Bed. 
Shusky
 besieg'd in his Castle
of 
Mosco,
 was adventrously sup∣ply'd
with some Powder and
Ammunition by the 
English;

and with 2000 
French, English

and 
Scots,
 with other Forces
from 
Charles
 King of 
Sweden.

The 
English
 after many miseries
of cold,
 and hunger and assaults
by the way, deserted by the

French,
 yielded most of them to
the 
Pole,
 neer 
Smolensko,
 and
serv'd him against the 
Russ.
 Mean
while this second 
Demetrius
 be∣ing
now rejected by the 
Poles,

with those 
Russians
 that sided
with him laid siege to 
Mosco:
Zolkiewsky
 for 
Sigismund
 King of

Poland
 Beleaguers on the other


side with forty thousand Men;
whereof 1500 
English, Scotch,

and 
French. Shusky
 despairing
success betakes him to a Mona∣stery;
but with the City is yiel∣ded
to the 
Pole;
 who turns now
his force against the Counterfeit

Demetrius;
 he seeking to fly is
by a 
Tartar
 slain in his Camp.

Smolensko
 held out a siege of two
years, then surrender'd. 
Shusky

the Emperour carried away into

Poland,
 there ended miserably in
prison. But before his departure
out of 
Muscovy
 the 
Polanders
 in
his name sending for the chief
Nobility as to a last farewell,
cause them to be entertain'd in a
secret place, and there dispatch'd:
by this means the easier to subdue
the People. Yet the 
Poles
 were
starv'd at length out of those Pla∣ces
in 
Mosco
 which they had for∣tify'd.
Wherein the 
Russians
 who
besieg'd them, found, as is repor∣ted,
60 Barrels of Man's Flesh


powder'd, being the Bodies of
such as dy'd among them, or
were slain in fight.


After which the Empire of

Russia
 broke to pieces,
 the prey
of such as could catch, every one
naming himself, and striving to
be accounted that 
Demetrius
 of

Ouglitts.
 Some chose 
Vladislaus

King 
Sigismund
's Son, but he not
accepting, they fell to a popular
Government; killing all the No∣bles
under pretence of favouring
the 
Poles.
 Some overtures of re∣ceiving
them were made, as some
say, to King 
Iames,
 and Sir 
Iohn
Meric,
 and Sir 
William Russel
 im∣ploy'd
therein. Thus 
Russia
 re∣maining
in this confusion, it
happen'd that a mean Man, a
Butcher dwelling in the North
about 
Duina,
 inveying against
the baseness of their Nobility,

and the corruption of Officers,

uttered words, that if they would
but choose a faithfull Treasurer


to pay well the Souldiers, and
a good General (naming one

Pozarsky
 a poor Gentleman, who
after good service done liv'd not
far off retir'd and neglected;) that
then he doubted not to drive out
the 
Poles.
 The People assent,
and choose that General; the
Butcher they make their Treasu∣rer
who both so well discharg'd
their Places, that with an Army
soon gather'd they raise the siege
of 
Mosco,
 which the 
Polanders

had renew'd; and with 
Boris Li∣cin

another great Souldier of that
Countrey fall into consultation
about the choise of an Emperour,
and chose at last 
Michalowich,
 or

Michael Pheodorowich,
 the fatal
Youth, whose name 
Shusky
 so
fear'd.


Michael Pheodorowich
 thus e∣lected
by the valour of 
Pozarsky

and 
Boris Licin,
 made them both
Generals of his Forces, joyning
with them another great Com∣mander


of the 
Cossacks
 whose aid
had much befriended him; the
Butcher also was made a Coun∣selour
of State. Finally a Peace
was made up between the 
Russi∣ans

and the 
Poles;
 and that part∣ly
by the mediation of King

Iames.








CHAP. V.


The first discovery of Russia by
the North-east, 1553 with the
English Embassies, and Enter∣tainments
at that Court, untill
the Year 1604.


THE discovery of 
Russia
 by
the northern Ocean,
 made
first,
 of any Nation that we
know, by 
English
 men, might
have seem'd an enterprise almost
heroick; if any higher end than
the excessive love of Gain and
Traffick, had animated the de∣sign.
Nevertheless that in re∣gard
that many things not un∣profitable
to the knowledge of
Nature, and other Observations
are hereby come to light, as
good events ofttimes arise from
evil occasions, it will not be the
worst labour to relate briefly the


beginning, and prosecution of
this adventurous Voiage; untill
it became at last a familiar Pas∣sage.


When our Merchants perceiv'd
the Commodities of 
England
 to
be in small request abroad, and
foreign Merchandize to grow
higher in esteem and value than
before, they began to think with
themselves how this might be
remedied. And seeing how the

Spaniards
 and 
Portugals
 had en∣creas'd
their Wealth by discove∣ry
of new Trades and Countries,
they resolv'd upon some new and
strange Navigation. At the same
time 
Sebastian Chabota,
 a man
for the knowledge of Sea-affairs
much renown'd in those daies,
happen'd to be in 
London.
 With
him first they consult; and by
his advice conclude to furnish
out three Ships for the search
and discovery of the northern
parts. And having heard that a


certain Worm is bred in that
Ocean, which many times ea∣teth
through the strongest Oak,
they contrive to cover some part
of the Keel of those Ships with
thin sheets of Lead; and victual
them for 18 months; allowing
equally to their journey their
stay, and their return. Arms
also they provide and store of
Munition, with sufficient Cap∣tains
and Governours for so great
an enterprise. To which among
many, and some void of experi∣ence
that offer'd themselves, Sir

Hugh Willowby
 a valiant Gentle∣man
earnestly requested to have
the charge. Of whom before all
others both for his goodly perso∣nage,
and singular skill in the
services of War, they made
choise to be Admiral; and of

Richard Chancelor,
 a man great∣ly
esteem'd for his skill, to be
chief Pilot. This man was
brought up by Mr. 
Henry Sid∣ney,



afterwards Deputy of 
Ire∣land,

who coming where the
Adventurers were gather'd toge∣ther;
though then a young
man, with a grave and eloquent
Speech commended 
Chancelor

unto them.


After this, they omitted no
enquiry after any person that
might inform them concerning
those north-easterly parts to
which the Voiage tended; and
two 
Tartarians
 then of the
King's Stable were sent for; but
they were able to answer no∣thing
to purpose. So after much
debate it was concluded that by
the 20
th
 of 
May
 the Ships should
depart. Being come near 
Green∣wich

where the Court then lay,
presently the Courtiers came
running out, the Privy Council
at the Windows, the rest on the
Towers and Battlements. The
Mariners all apparell'd in Watch∣et,
or sky-coloured Cloth, dis∣charge


their Ordnance; the
noise whereof, and of the People
shouting is answer'd from the
Hills and Waters with as loud
an Echo. Onely the good King

Edward
 then sick beheld not
this sight, but dy'd soon after.
From hence putting into 
Har∣wich,

they staid long and lost
much time. At length passing
by 
Shetland,
 they kenn'd a far
off 
Aegelands,
 being an innumera∣ble
sort of Islands call'd 
Rost
Islands
 in 66 degrees. Thence
to 
Lofoot
 in 68. to 
Seinam
 in
70 degrees; these Islands belong
all to the Crown of 
Denmark.

Whence departing Sir 
Hugh Wil∣lowby

set out his Flag by which
he call'd together the chief men
of his other Ships to counsel;
where they conclude, in case
they happen'd to be scatter'd by
Tempest, that 
Wardhouse
 a no∣ted
Haven in 
Finmark
 be the
appointed place of their meeting.


The very same day after noon
so great a Tempest arose, that
the Ships were some driv'n one
way, some another in great pe∣ril.
The General with his lou∣dest
voice call'd to 
Chancelor
 not
to be far from him; but in vain,
for the admiral sayling much
better than his Ship, and bearing
all her Sayles was carried with
great swiftness soon out of sight;
but before that, the Ship-boat
striking against her Ship was
overwhelmed in view of the 
Bo∣naventure

whereof 
Chancelor
 was
Captain.
 The third Ship also in
the same Storm was lost. But
Sir 
Hugh Willowby
 escaping that
Storm, and wandring on those
desolate Seas till the 18
th
 of 
Sep∣tember

put into a Haven where
they had Weather as in the depth
of Winter; and there determi∣ning
to abide till Spring, sent
out three men southwest to find
Inhabitants; who journy'd three


daies but found none; then other
three went westward four daies
journey, and lastly three south∣east
three daies; but they all re∣turning
without news of People,
or any sign of Habitation, Sir

Hugh
 with the company of his
two Ships abode there till 
Ianua∣ry,

as appears by a Will since
found in one of the Ships; but
then perish'd all with cold. This
River or Haven was 
Arzina
 in

Lapland
 neer to 
Kegor,
 where
they were found dead the year
after by certain 
Russian
 Fisher∣men.
Whereof the 
English
 A∣gent
at 
Mosco
 having notice,
sent and recover'd the Ships
with the dead Bodies and most
of the Goods, and sent them for

England;
 but the Ships being
unstanch, as is suppos'd, by
their two years wintring in 
Lap∣land,

sunk by the way with
their Dead, and them also that
brought them. But now 
Chan∣celor



with his Ship and Company
thus left, shap'd his course to

Wardhouse,
 the place agreed on
to expect the rest; where ha∣ving
staid 7 daies without ty∣dings
of them, he resolves at
length to hold on his Voiage;
and sayl'd so far till he found
no night, but continual day and
Sun cleerly shining on that huge
and vast Sea for certain daies.
At length they enter into a great
Bay, nam'd, as they knew after,
from Saint 
Nicholas;
 and spying
a Fisherboat, made after him to
know what People they were.
The Fishermen amaz'd with the
greatness of his Ship, to them a
strange and new sight, sought to
fly; but overtak'n, in great fear
they prostrate themselves, and
offer to kiss his Feet; but he ray∣sing
them up with all signes and
gestures of courtesie, sought to
win their friendship. They no
sooner dismist, but spread abroad


the arrival of a strange Nation,
whose humanity they spake of
with great affection; whereup∣on
the People running together,
with like return of all courteous
usage receive them; offering them
Victuals freely; nor refusing to
traffick, but for a loyal Custom
which bound them from that,
without first the consent had of
their King. After mutual de∣mands
of each other's Nation
they found themselves to be in

Russia
 where 
Iuan Vasiliwich
 at
that time reign'd Emperour.
To whom privily the Gover∣nour
of that place sending no∣tice
of the strange Guests that
were arriv'd, held in the mean
while our Men in what su∣spence
he could. The Empe∣rour
well pleas'd with so un∣expected
a Message, invites them
to his Court, offring them Post∣horses
at his own charge, or if
the journey seem'd overlong,


that they might freely traffick
where they were. But 'ere this
Messenger could return, having
lost his way, the 
Muscovites

themselves, loath that our men
should depart which they made
shew to doe, furnish't them with
Guides and other Conveniences
to bring them to their King's
presence. 
Chancelor
 had now
gon more than half his jour∣ney,
when the Sled man sent to
Court meets him on the way;
delivers him the Emperour's
Letters; which when the 
Rus∣ses

understood, so willing they
were to obey the Contents
thereof, that they quarrell'd and
strove who should have the pre∣ferment
to put his Horses to the
Sled. So after a long and trou∣blesome
journey of 1500 miles
he arriv'd at 
Mosco.
 After he
had remain'd in the City about
12 daies, a Messenger was sent
to bring them to the King's


House. Being enter'd within
the Court Gates, and brought
into an outward Chamber, they
beheld there a very honourable
company to the number of a
hunder'd sitting all apparell'd in
Cloth of gold down to their
Ancles: next conducted to the
Chamber of presence, there sate
the Emperour on a lofty and
very royal Throne; on his
Head a Diadem of gold, his
Robe all of Goldsmiths work,
in his Hand a chrystal Sceptre
garnish'd and beset with precious
Stones; no less was his Coun∣tenance
full of majesty. Beside
him stood his chief Secretary;
on his other side the great
Commander of silence, both in
Cloth of gold; then sate his
Council of 150 round about on
high Seats, clad all as richly.

Chancelor
 nothing abash'd made
his obeysance to the Emperour
after the 
English
 manner. The


Emperour having taken, and
read his Letters, after some en∣quiry
of King 
Edward
's Health,
invited them to dinner, and till
then dismiss'd them. But before
dismission the Secretary presen∣ted
their Present bareheaded;
till which time they were all
cover'd; and before admittance
our men had charge not to
speak, but when the Emperour
demanded ought. Having sat
two hours in the Secretary's
Chamber, they were at length
call'd in to dinner; where the
Emperour was set at Table,
now in a Robe of silver, and
another Crown on his Head.
This place was call'd the golden
Palace, but without cause, for
the 
English
 men had seen many
fairer; round about the room,
but at distance, were other long
Tables; in the midst a Cup∣board
of huge and massy gob∣lets,
and other Vessels of gold


and silver; among the rest four
great Flagons nigh two yards
high, wrought in the top with
devices of Towers and Dragons
heads. The Guests ascended to
their Tables by three steps; all
apparell'd in Linnen, and that
lin'd with rich Furrs. The Mes∣ses
came in without order, but
all in Chargers of gold, both to
the Emperour, and to the rest
that din'd there, which were
two hundred persons; on every
Board also were set Cups of
gold without number. The Ser∣vitors
one hundred and forty
were likewise array'd in gold,
and waited with Caps on their
heads. They that are in high
favour sit on the same Bench
with the Emperour, but far off.
Before Meat came in, accor∣ding
to the custom of their
Kings, he sent to every Guest
a slice of Bread; whom the Of∣ficer
naming saith thus, 
Iohn


Basiliwich
 Emperour of 
Russ,
 &c.
doth reward thee with Bread,
at which words all men stand
up. Then were Swans in se∣veral
pieces serv'd in, each piece
in a several Dish, which the
great Duke sends about as the
Bread, and so likewise the Drink.
In dinner time he twice chang'd
his Crown, his Waiters thrice
their Apparel; to whom the
Emperour in like manner gives
both Bread and Drink with his
own hands; which they say is
done to the intent that he may
perfectly know his own Hous∣hold;
and indeed when dinner
was done, he call'd his Nobles
every one before him by name;
and by this time Candles were
brought in, for it grew dark;
and the 
English
 departed to their
Lodgings from dinner, an hour
within night.


In the Year 1555.
 
Chancelor

made another voiage to this


Place with Letters from Queen

Mary;
 had a House in 
Mosco,

and Diet appointed him; and
was soon admitted to the Empe∣rour's
presence in a large room
spread with Carpets; at his en∣tring
and salutation all stood
up, the Emperour onely sitting,
except when the Queen's name
was read, or spoken; for then
he himself would rise: at dinner
he sate bareheaded; his Crown
and rich Cap standing on a Pi∣nacle
by.
 
Chancelor
 returning
for 
England, Osep Napea
 Gover∣nour
of 
Wologda
 came in his
Ship Ambassadour from the

Russe;
 but suffering shipwrack
in 
Pettislego
 a Bay in 
Scotland,
Chancelor
 who took more care
to save the Ambassadour than
himself was drown'd, the Ship
rifled, and most of her lading
made booty by the People
thereabout.


In the Year 1557. 
Osep Na∣pea

returned into his Countrey
with 
Antony Ienkinson
 who had
the command of four tall Ships.

He reports of a Whirlpool be∣tween
the 
Rost Islands
 and 
Lo∣foot

call'd 
Malestrand;
 which
from half ebb till half flood is
heard to make so terrible a noise,
as shakes the Door-rings of Hou∣ses
in those Islands ten mile off;
Whales that come within the
Current thereof make a pittifull
cry; Trees carried in and cast
out again have the ends and
boughs of them so beaten, as they
seem like the stalks of bruized
Hemp. About 
Zeinam
 they saw
many Whales very monstrous
hard by their Ships; whereof
some by estimation sixty foot
long; they roard hideously, it
being then the time of their
engendring. At 
Wardhouse,
 he
saith, the Cattel are fed with
Fish. Coming to 
Mosco,
 he


found the Emperour sitting a∣loft
in a Chair of state, richly
crown'd, a Staff of gold in his
hand wrought with costly stone.
Distant from him sate his Bro∣ther,
and a Youth the Empe∣rour's
Son of 
Casan
 whom the

Russ
 had conquer'd; there din'd
with him diverse Ambassadours,
Christian and Heathen, diversely
apparell'd; his Brother with some
of the chief Nobles sate with
him at Table: the Guests were
in all six hundred. In dinner
time came in six Musicians; and
standing in the midst, sung three
several times, but with little or
no delight to our men; there
din'd at the same time in other
Halls two thousand 
Tartars
 who
came to serve the Duke in his
Wars. The 
English
 were set at
a small Table by themselves di∣rect
before the Emperour; who
sent them diverse Bowles of Wine
and Meath and many Dishes


from his own hand: the Messes
were but mean, but the change
of Wines and several Meaths
were wonderfull. As oft as they
din'd with the Emperour, he
sent for them in the Morning,
and invited them with his own
mouth. On 
Christmass
 day be∣ing
invited,
 they had for other
provision as before; but for store
of gold and silver Plate exces∣sive;
among which were twelve
Barrels of silver, hoop'd with fine
gold containing twelve gallons a∣piece.


1560. Was the first 
English

traffick to the 
Narve
 in 
Livo∣nia,

till then conceal'd by 
Dan∣skers

and 
Lubeckers.


1561. The same 
Antony Ien∣kinson

made another voiage to

Mosco;
 and arriv'd while the
Emperour was celebrating his
marriage with a 
Circassian
 Lady;
during which time the City
Gates for three daies were kept


shut; and all men whatsoever
straitly commanded to keep
within their Houses; except
some of his Houshold; the cause
whereof is not known.


1566. He made again the
same voiage;
 which now men
usually made in a month from

London
 to Saint 
Nicholas
 with
good Windes, being seven hun∣dred
and fifty leagues.


1568. 
Thomas Randolf,
 
Esq

went Embassadour to 
Muscovy,

from Queen 
Elizabeth;
 and in
his passage by Sea met nothing
remarkable save great store of
Whales, whom they might see
engendring together, and the
Sperma-ceti swimming on the
Water. At 
Colmogro
 he was
met by a Gentleman from the
Emperour, at whose charge he
was conducted to 
Mosco:
 but
met there by no man; not so
much as the 
English;
 lodg'd in a
fair House built for Ambassa∣dours;


but there confin'd upon
some suspicion which the Empe∣rour
had conceav'd; sent for at
length after seventeen weeks de∣lay,
was fain to ride thither on
a borrow'd Horse, his men on foot.
In a Chamber before the presence
were sitting about three hun∣dred
Persons, all in rich Robes
taken out of the Emperour's
Wardrobe for that day; they
sate on three ranks of Benches,
rather for shew than that the
Persons were of honour; being
Merchants, and other mean In∣habitants.
The Ambassadour sa∣luted
them, but by them unsa∣luted
pass'd on with his Head
cover'd. At the Presence door
being receiv'd by two which
had been his Guardians, and
brought into the midst, he was
there will'd to stand still, and
speak his message from the
Queen; at whose name the Em∣perour
stood up, and demanded


her health: then giving the
Ambassadour his Hand to kiss
fell to many questions. The
Present being deliver'd, which
was a great silver Bowle curi∣ously
grav'n, the Emperour told
him, he din'd not that day
openly because of great Affairs;
but, saith he, I will send thee
my Dinner, and augment thy
Allowance. And so dismissing
him, sent a Duke richly appa∣rell'd
soon after to his Lodging
with fifty Persons each of them
carrying Meat in silver Dishes
cover'd; which himself deliver'd
into the Ambassadour's own
hands tasting first of every
Dish, and every sort of Drink;
that done, set him down with
his Company, took part, and
went not thence unrewarded.
The Emperour sent back with
this Ambassadour another of
his own call'd 
Andrew Savin.


1571. 
Ienkinson
 made a third
voiage; but was staid long at

Colmogro
 by reason of the
Plague in those Parts; at length
had audience where the Court
then was, near to 
Pereslave;
 to
which place the Emperour was
return'd from his 
Swedish
 War
with ill success: and 
Mosco
 the
same year had been wholly
burnt by the 
Crim;
 in it the

English
 House, and diverse 
En∣glish

were smother'd in the Sel∣lars,
multitudes of People in
the City perish'd, all that were
young led captive with excee∣ding
spoil.


1583.
 
Iuan Basiliwich
 having
the year before sent his Ambassa∣dour

Pheodor Andrewich
 about
matters of Commerce,
 the Queen
made choice of Sir 
Ierom Bowes,

one of her houshold, to go into

Russia;
 who being attended with
more than forty persons, and ac∣companied
with the 
Russe
 re∣turning


home, arriv'd at St. 
Ni∣colas.

The 
Dutch
 by this time
had intruded into the 
Muscovy
-Trade;
which by privilege long
before had been granted solely
to the 
English;
 and had cor∣rupted
to their side 
Shalkan
 the
Chancellor, with others of the
great ones; who so wrought,
that a creature of their own was
sent to meet Sir 
Ierom
 at 
Col∣mogro,

and to offer him occasi∣ons
of dislike: Until at 
Vologda

he was receiv'd by another from
the Emperour; and at 
Yeraslave

by a Duke well accompanied,
who presented him with a Coach
and ten Geldings. Two miles
from 
Mosco
 met him four Gen∣tlemen
with Two hundred Horse,
who after short salutation, told
him what they had to say from the
Emperour, willing him to alight,
which the Ambassadour soon re∣fus'd,
unless they also lighted;
whereon they stood long deba∣ting;


at length agreed, great di∣spute
follow'd, whose foot should
first touch the ground. Their
Message deliver'd, and then em∣bracing,
they conducted the Am∣bassador
to a house at 
Mosco,

built for him purposely. At his
going to Court he and his fol∣lowers
honourably mounted and
apparell'd, the Emperour's Guard
were set on either side all the
way about 6000 shot. At the
Court-gate met him four Noble∣men
in Cloth of Gold, and rich
Furr-Caps, embroider'd with Pearl
and Stone; then four others of
greater degree, in which passage
there stood along the Walls, and
sate on Benches seven or eight
hundred men in colour'd Sattins
and Gold. At the Presence-dore
met him the chief Herald, and
with him all the great Officers
of Court, who brought him
where the Emperour sate: there
were set by him three Crowns


of 
Muscovy, Cazan
 and 
Astracan;

on each side stood two young
Noblemen, costly apparell'd in
White; each of them had a broad
Axe on his shoulder; on the
Benches round sate above a hun∣dred
Noblemen. Having giv'n
the Ambassadour his hand to kiss,
and enquir'd of the Queens Health,
he will'd him to go sit in the
place provided for him, nigh ten
paces distant; from thence to
send him the Queens Letters and
Present. Which the Ambassadour
thinking not reasonable, step'd
forward; but the Chancellor
meeting him, would have tak'n
his Letters; to whom the Am∣bassadour
said, that the Queen had
directed no Letters to him; and
so went on and deliver'd them
to the Emperour's own hands;
and after a short withdrawing in∣to
the Council-Chamber, where
he had Conference with some of
the Council, he was call'd in to


dinner: about the midst where∣of,
the Emperour standing up,
drank a deep Carouse to the
Queens Health, and sent to the
Ambassadour a great Bowl of
Rhenish-Wine to pledge him.
But at several times being call'd
for to treat about Affairs, and not
yielding ought beyond his Com∣mission,
the Emperour not wont
to be gain-say'd, one day especi∣ally
broke into passion, and with
a stern countenance told him, he
did not reckon the Queen to be
his fellow; for there are, quoth
he, her betters. The Ambassa∣dour
not holding it his part, what∣ever
danger might ensue, to hear
any derogate from the Majesty
of his Prince, with like courage
and countenance told him, that
the Queen was equal to any
in Christendom who thought
himself greatest; and wanted
not means to offend her Ene∣mies
whomsoever. Yea, quoth


he, what saist thou of the 
French

and 
Spanish
 Kings? I hold her,
quoth the Ambassadour, equal
to either. Then what to the

German
 Emperour? Her Father,
quoth he, had the Emperour in
his pay. This answer mislik'd
the Duke so far, as that he told
him, were he not an Ambassa∣dour,
he would throw him out
of doors. You may, said the
Ambassadour, doe your will,
for I am now fast in your
Countrey; but the Queen I
doubt not will know how to
be reveng'd of any injury offer'd
to her Ambassadour. Whereat
the Emperour in great sudden
bid him get home; and he
with no more reverence than
such usage requir'd, saluted the
Emperour, and went his way.
Notwithstanding this, the 
Mus∣covite,

soon as his mood left
him, spake to them that stood
by, many praises of the Am∣bassadour,


wishing he had such
a Servant, and presently after
sent his chief Secretary to tell
him that whatever had pass'd
in words, yet for his great re∣spect
to the Queen, he would
shortly after dispatch him with
honour and full contentment,
and in the mean while he much
enlarg'd his entertainment. He
also desir'd that the Points of
our Religion might be set down,
and caus'd them to be read to
his Nobility with much appro∣bation.
And as the year before
he had sought in marriage the
Lady 
Mary Hastings,
 which took
not effect, the Lady and her
Friends excusing it, he now a∣gain
renu'd the motion to take
to wife some one of the Queen's
Kinswomen either by sending
an Embassage, or going himself
with his Treasure into 
England.

Now happy was that Nobleman
whom Sir 
Ierom Bowes
 in pub∣lick


favour'd; unhappy they
who had oppos'd him: for the
Emperour, had beaten 
Shalkan

the Chancelour very grievously
for that cause, and threatn'd not
to leave one of his race alive.
But the Emperour dying soon
after of a Surfeit, 
Shalkan
 to
whom then almost the whole
Government was committed,
caus'd the Ambassadour to re∣main
close Prisoner in his House
nine weeks. Being sent for at
length to have his dispatch, and
slightly enough conducted to
the Council Chamber, he was
told by 
Shalkan
 that this Em∣perour
would condescend to no
other agreements than were be∣tween
his Father and the Queen
before his coming: and so dis∣arming
both him and his Com∣pany,
brought them to the Em∣perour
with many affronts in
their passage, for which there
was no help but patience. The


Emperour saying but over what
the Chancelour had said before,
offer'd him a Letter for the
Queen: which the Ambassa∣dour,
knowing it contain'd no∣thing
to the purpose of his Em∣bassy,
refus'd, till he saw his
danger grow too great; nor was
he suffer'd to reply, or have his
Interpreter. 
Shalkan
 sent him
word that now the 
English
 Em∣perour
was dead; and hasten'd
his departure, but with so ma∣ny
disgraces put upon him, as
made him fear some mischief in
his journey to the Sea; having
onely one mean Gentleman sent
with him to be his Convoy; he
commanded the 
English
 Mer∣chants
in the Queen's name to
accompany him, but such was
his danger, that they durst not.
So arming himself and his Fol∣lowers
in the best wise he
could, against any outrage, he
at length recover'd the Shoar of


Saint 
Nicholas.
 Where he now
resolv'd to send them back by
his Conduct some of the af∣fronts
which he had receiv'd.
Ready therefore to take Ship,
he causes three or four of his
valientest and discreetest men to
take the Emperour's Letter, and
disgracefull Present, and to deli∣ver
it, or leave it at the Lodg∣ing
of his Convoy, which they
safely did; though follow'd with
a great Tumult of such as would
have forc'd them to take it back.


1584. At the Coronation of

Pheodor
 the Emperour▪ 
Ierom
Horsey
 being then Agent in

Russia,
 and call'd for to court
with one 
Iohn de Wale
 a Mer∣chant
of the 
Netherlands
 and a
Subject of 
Spain,
 some of the
Nobles would have preferr'd the

Fleming
 before the 
English.
 But
to that our Agent would in no
case agree, saying he would ra∣ther
have his Leggs cut off by


the Knees, then bring his pre∣sent
in course after a Subject of

Spain.
 The Emperour and Prince

Boris
 perceiving the controver∣sy,
gave order to admit 
Hor∣sey

first: who was dismiss'd with
large Promises, and seventy Mes∣ses
with three Carts of several
Meath sent after him.


1588. Dr. 
Giles Fletcher
 went
Ambassadour from the Queen to

Pheodor
 then Emperour; whose
Relations being judicious and
exact are best red entirely by
themselves.
 This Emperour up∣on
report of the great learning
of 
Iohn Dee
 the Mathematician
invited him to 
Mosco
 with offer
of two thousand pound a year,
and from Prince 
Boris
 one thou∣sand
Marks; to have his Provi∣sion
from the Emperour's Ta∣ble,
to be honourably receiv'd,
and accounted as one of the
chief men in the Land. All
which 
Dee
 accepted not.


1604. Sir 
Thomas Smith
 was
sent Ambassadour from King

Iames
 to 
Boris
 then Emperour;
and staid some daies at a place
five miles from 
Mosco
 till he
was honourably receiv'd into
the City; met on horseback
by many thousands of Gentle∣men
and Nobles on both sides
the way; where the Ambassa∣dour
alighting from his Coach
and mounted on his Horse, rode
with his Trumpets sounding be∣fore
him; till a Gentleman of
the Emperour's Stable brought
him a Gennet gorgeously trapt
with gold, pearl and stone, es∣pecially
with a great Chain of
plated gold about his Neck,
and Horses richly adorn'd for
his Followrs. Then came three
great Noblemen with an Inter∣preter
offring a Speech; but the
Ambassadour deeming it to be
ceremony, with a brief Com∣plement
found means to put it


by. Thus alighting all, they sa∣luted,
and gave hands mutually.
Those three after a tedious pre∣amble
of the Emperour's Title
thrice repeated brought a several
Complement of three words a∣piece,
as namely, the first, to
know how the King did, the
next, how the Ambassadour, the
third, that there was a fair
House provided him. Then on
they went on either hand of the
Ambassadour, and about six
thousand Gallants behind them;
still met within the City by
more of greater quality to the
very Gate of his lodging: where
fifty Gunners were his daily
Guard both at home and abroad.
The Prestaves or Gentlemen as∣sign'd
to have the care of his
entertainment, were earnest to
have had the Ambassadour's
Speech and Message given them
in writing, that the Interpreter,
as they pretended, might the


better translate it; but he ad∣monish'd
them of their foolish
demand. On the day of his au∣dience
other Gennets were sent
him and his Attendants to ride
on, and two white Palfreys to
draw a rich Chariot, which was
parcel of the Present; the rest
whereof was carried by his Fol∣lowers
through a lane of the
Emperour's Guard; many Mes∣sengers
posting up and down the
while, till they came through
the great Castle, to the utter∣most
Court gate. There met by
a great Duke they were
brought up stairs through a
Stone-gallery, where stood on
each hand many in fair Coats
of 
Persian
 Stuff, Velvet and Da∣mask.
The Ambassadour by two
other Counselours being led into
the presence, after his obeysance
done, was to stay and hear again
the long Title repeated; then the
particular Presents; and so deli∣ver'd


as much of his Embassage
as was then requisite. After
which the Emperour arising
from his Throne demandeth of
the King's health; so did the
young Prince. The Ambassa∣dour
then deliver'd his Letters
into the Emperour's own hand,
though the Chancelour offer'd
to have taken them. He bore
the Majesty of a mighty Empe∣rour;
his Crown and Sceptre of
pure gold, a Collar of Pearls
about his Neck, his Garment
of crimson Velvet embroider'd
with precious stone and gold.
On his right Side stood a fair
Globe of beaten gold on a Pyra∣mis
with a Cross upon it 
 to
which, before he spake, turning
a little he crost himself. Not
much less in splendour on ano∣ther
Throne sate the Prince. By
the Emperour stood two Noble∣men
in Cloth of silver, high
Caps of black Furr, and Chains


of gold hanging to their Feet;
on their Shoulders two Poleaxes
of gold; and two of silver by the
Prince; the ground was all co∣ver'd
with Arras or Tapistry-Dismist,
and brought in again to
dinner they saw the Emperour
and his Son seated in state, ready
to dine; each with a Skull of
Pearl on their bare Heads, their
Vestments chang'd. In the midst
of this Hall seem'd to stand a
Pillar heap'd round to a great
height with massy Plate curious∣ly
wrought with Beasts, Fishes
and Fowl. The Emperour's Ta∣ble
was serv'd with two hundred
Noblemen in Coats of gold; the
Princes Table with young Dukes
of 
Casan, Astracan, Siberia, Tar∣taria

and 
Circassia.
 The Empe∣rour
sent from his Table to the
Ambassadour, thirty Dishes of
Meat, to each a Loaf of extra∣ordinary
fine Bread. Then fol∣low'd
a number more of strange


and rare Dishes 
il'd up by half
dozens, with boyl'd, roast and
bak't, most part of them besawc'd
with Garlick and Onions. In
midst of dinner calling the Am∣bassadour
up to him he drank
the King's health, who receiving
it from his hand, return'd to his
place, and in the same Cup be∣ing
of fair Chrystal pledg'd it
with all his Company. After
dinner they were call'd up to
drink of excellent and strong
Meath from the Emperour's
hand; of which when many did
but sip, he urg'd it not; saying
he was best pleas'd with what
was most for their health. Yet
after that, the same day he sent
a great and glorious Duke, one
of them that held the golden
Poleax, with his Retinue, and
sundry sorts of Meath to drink
merrily with the Ambassadour,
which some of the 
English
 did,
untill the Duke and his Followers


light-headed, but well rewarded
with thirty yards of Cloth of
gold, and two standing Cups,
departed. At second audience
the Ambassadour had like recep∣tion
as before: and being dis∣miss'd
had dinner sent after him
with three hundred several Dishes
of Fish, it being Lent, of such
strangeness, greatness and good∣ness
as scarce would be credible
to report. The Ambassadour de∣parting
was brought a mile out
of the City with like honour as
he was first met; where lighting
from the Emperour's Sled, he
took him to his Coach, made
fast upon a Sled; the rest to
their Sleds an easy and pleasant
passage.
