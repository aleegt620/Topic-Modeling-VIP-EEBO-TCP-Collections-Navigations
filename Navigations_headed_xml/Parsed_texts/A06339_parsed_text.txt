LONDON

Printed by Iohn Wolfe. 1597.

























To the most Gracious and Reuerende
Father in God, IOHN by the proui∣dence
of God, Lord Archbishop of Can∣terbury,
Primate and Metropolitane of
all Englande, and one of the Lordes
of her Maiesties most hono∣rable
Priuie Coun∣cell.


M
Ost Reuerend Father,
my singular good and
gracious Lorde: In all
humble dutie I do offer
to your grace this poor
and slender present, 
in auspicium nas∣centis
anni,
 which I doe most hartely
pray, may bee as happie and prospe∣rous
both for your health and quiet




gouernement, as (thanks be to God)
your latter yeares haue beene. It is a
description of a certaine Region or
Kingdome in 
Africa,
 called 
Congo,

whose name is as yet scarce knowen
to our quarters of 
Europe,
 neyther is
there any great or solemne mention
of it in any bookes that haue beene
published of that Third parte of the
old World. And because this treatise
doeth comprehend not onely the na∣ture
and disposition of the 
Moci-Conghi,

which are the naturall inha∣bitantes
and people of 
Congo,
 toge∣ther
with all the commodities and
trafficke of that Countrey, very fitte
and pleasaunt to be reade, but also the
religion which they professed, and
by what meanes it pleased God to
draw them from 
Paganisme
 to 
Chri∣stianity:





I thought good thus to make
it knowen to my countreymen of

England,
 to the end it might be a pre∣sident
for such valiant English, as do
earnestly thirst and desire to atchieue
the conquest of rude and barbarous
Nations, that they doo not attempt
those actions for commodity of Gold
and Siluer, and for other transitorie
or worldly respectes, but that they
woulde first seeke the Kingdome of
God, & the saluation of many thou∣sand
soules, which the common ene∣mie
of mankinde still detayneth in
ignorance: and then all other thinges
shall be put in their mouthes aboun∣dantly,
as may bee seene by the 
Por∣tingalles

in this narration. Written it
was by one 
Philippo Pigafetta,
 an Ita∣lian,
and a very good Mathematici∣an,




from the mouth of one 
Lopez
 a

Portingal,
 together with two maps,
the one particular of 
Congo,
 the other
generall of all 
Africa,
 and especially
of the 
Westerne
 Coast, from 34. de∣grees
beyond the 
Aequinoctial
 north∣wardes,
downe along to the 
Cape
 of

Good-Hope
 in the 
South,
 and so vp∣wardes
againe on the 
Easterne
 Coast
by the great Island of 
Madagascar,
 o∣therwise
called the 
Isle
 of 
S. Laurence,

til you come to the 
Isle
 of 
Socotora,
 &
then to the 
Redde Sea,
 and from 
Ae∣gypt

into the Inland 
Southwards
 to the
Empire of 
Presbiter-Iohn.
 I beseech
your grace to accept of this my poore
trauell, and I will not cease to pray to
Almightie God, according to my
dutie, that hee will multiply many
good years vpon you, vnder the hap∣py




gouernment of our most gracious
& soueraigne Lady Queene Eliza∣beth:
wherevnto the Church of 
Eng∣lande

is bound to say, Amen. From
your Graces house in Lambehith,
the first of Ianuarie. 1597.


Your Graces most humble Seruant
at commaundement,

Abraham Hartwell.








❧ The Translator to the
Reader.


I
 Finde it true, that 
Sophocles
 writeth
in his 
Whipp-bearer Aiax,
 
:
Labor labori laborem
adfert, 
that is to say, Labour doth
breede labour vpon labour.
 For
after that the translation of the Booke,
contayning the Warres betweene the

Turkes
 and 
Persians
 written by 
Iohn-Thomas Minadoi

was published, diuers of my friends haue earnestly moued me
to be still doing somewhat, and to help our 
English Nation,

that they might knowe and vnderstand many things, which
are common in other languages, but vtterly concealed from
this poore 
Island.
 I haue aunswered some of these my friends
to their good satisfaction, and told them, that the weakenesse
of my body would not suffer me to sit long, that the houres of
my leasure were not many, vnlesse I should vnduetifully de∣fraude
those to whome I am most beholden and bounden, of
that duty and attendance which I owe vnto them: and
lastly, that I had no great pleasure to learne or informe my
selfe of the state of other 
Nations,
 because I do not as yet suf∣ficiently
know the Estate of mine owne 
Countrey.
 Whereof
(I am verily perswaded) I may iustly auouch that which 
V∣lysses

protested of his 
Ithaca:
 
.

Then which poore Countrey
can I neuer see any sweeter.
 Among others that made




these 
Motions
 vnto me,
 one there was, who being a curious
and a diligent searcher and obseruer of Forreine aduentures
and aduenturers, as by his good paines appeareth, came vnto
me to the house of a graue and learned 
Prelate
 in 
Suffolke,

where I lay in my returne out of 
Norffolke,
 and there made
the like request vnto me, and I the like answere vnto him.
But it would not satisfie him: for he sayd it was an answere
answerelesse, and it should not serue my turne. And presently
presented me with this 
Portingall Pilgrime
 lately come to
him out of the 
Kingdome
 of 
Congo,
 and apparrelled in an

Italian vesture:
 intreating me very earnestly, that I would
take him with me, and make him 
English:
 for he could re∣port
many pleasant matters that he sawe in his 
pilgrimage,

which are indeed vncouth and almost incredible to this part
of 
Europe.
 When I sawe there was no remedie, I yeelded,
and euen (as the Poet saith) 
,
 I brought
him away with mee. But within two houres conference, I
found him nibling at two most honourable Gentlemen of

England,
 whome in plaine tearmes he called 
Pirates:
 so
that I had much adoo to hold my hands from renting of him
into many mo peeces, then his 
Cosen Lopez
 the 
Doctor

was quartered. Yet 
, 
My second wits

stayed me, and aduised me, that I should peruse all his 
Report,

before I would proceede to execution: which in deede I did.
And, because I sawe that in all the rest of his behauiour hee
conteyned himselfe very well and honestly, and that he vsed
this lewd speech, not altogether 
exanimo,
 but rather 
ex vi∣tio
gentis,
 of the now-inueterate hatred, which the 
Span∣yard

and 
Portingall
 beare against our 
Nation,
 I was so
bold as to pardon him, and so taught him to speake the 
Eng∣lish
toung.
 In which language, if you will vouchsafe to heare
him, hee will tell you many notable obseruations of diuers





Countreys
 and 
peoples
 inhabiting in 
Africa,
 whose
Names haue scarse been mentioned in 
England.
 As namely,
the 
Kingdome
 of 
Congo,
 with all the 
Prouinces
 thereof,
the 
Kingdome
 of 
Angola,
 the 
Kingdome
 of 
Loango,

the 
Kingdome
 of the 
Anzichi,
 the 
Kingdome
 of 
Mata∣ma,

the 
Kingdome
 of 
Buttua,
 the 
Kingdome
 of 
Sofala,

the 
Kingdome
 of 
Mozambiche,
 the 
Kingdome
 of 
Qui∣loa,

the 
Kingdome
 of 
Mombaza,
 the 
Kingdome
 of 
Me∣linde,

with the three great 
Empyres
 of 
Monomotapa,
 of

Moenemugi,
 and of 
Prete-Gianni.
 He will tell you the
seuerall 
Rites
 and 
Customes,
 the 
Climates
 and 
Tem∣peratures,

the 
Commodities
 and 
Traffiques,
 of all these

Kingdomes.
 He will tell you the sundry kinds of 
Cattell,
Fishes
 and 
Fowles, strange Beasts,
 and 
Monstrous Ser∣pents,

that are to be found therein: For 
Africa
 was alwayes
noted to be a fruitfull Mother of such fearefull and terrible

Creatures.
 He will tell you of great 
Lakes,
 that deserue the
name of 
Seas:
 and huge 
Mountaynes
 of diuers sorts, as for
example, 
Mountaines scorched with heat, Mountaines

of 
Snow
 proceeding of colde, 
Mountaynes
 of the 
Sunne,
Mountaynes
 of the 
Moone, Mountaynes
 of 
Christall,
Mountaynes
 of 
Iron, Mountaynes
 of 
Siluer,
 and 
Moun∣taynes

of 
Golde.
 And lastly, he will tell you the 
Originall
Spring
 of 
Nilus,
 and the true cause of the yerely increase
thereof. In any of these poynts, if his Mouth shall happen to
runne ouer (as I hope, much it doth not) you must needes
beare with him, for he will challenge the priuilege of the

English
 Prouerbe, 
A Traueller may lye by authoritie,

and the old 
Greeke Agnomination,
 
,

Euery Pilgrime is not a Sooth-sayer.


But to leaue this long 
Allegorie,
 which indeede is meant
of this Booke, and to come seriously and briefly to certaine




faults, that some Readers may peraduenture finde therein, I
will do my best indeuor to satisfie them in such obiections as
may be made. And first, they will except perhaps against the

Methode
 of the 
Author,
 because he keepeth no continuate

Order
 in this 
Report,
 but leapeth from one 
Matter
 to ano∣ther,
without any coherence, like 
Marots Poeme,
 called 
Du
Coqual' Asne:
 and so maketh a 
Hotchpot
 of it. But herein

Pigafetta
 is not greatly to be blamed, who gathering this

Report
 out of the tumultuarie Papers of 
Lopez,
 and from
his vnpremeditated speeches, vttered by mouth at seuerall
times, could not so well reduce it into so exact a forme and

Methode,
 as curious wits do require. He is rather to be com∣mended,
that hauing so rude and vndigested a 
Chaos
 to
worke vpon, he could frame so handsome a little world of it as
this is. If happily it be further vrged, that the Translator
should haue taken paines to cast him in a new 
Mould,
 and to
make his members hang proportionably one vpon another:
I must answere, that I neither do, nor euer did like of that
kinde of course. I was alwayes of this opinion (and therein I
do still dwell) that 
Authors
 should be published in the same

Order,
 in the same 
Termes,
 & in the same 
Stile
 which they
themselues vsed. For how know I, what moued them to ob∣serue
this 
Order
 or that 
Order,
 and to make choyce of one
word rather then of another? peraduenture the reason of
their so doing might proue to be so strong, as I doubt it would
not easily be ouerthrowne.
 And touching 
Style,
 some are
so scrupulous and so nice, that they cannot abide to haue old
and auncient Writers to be published in 
Latin,
 vnlesse they
do imitate one of the 
Triumuiri
 of the 
Latin
 toung, 
Cicero,
Caesar
 or 
Salust.
 If all men should be of that humour, we
should be bereaued both of singular 
Diuinitie,
 and antique

Historie,
 which haue been written by men of no great lear∣ning,




as 
Monkes
 and 
Friers,
 whome (though they were
very simple and meane, yet) it pleased God in the times of
ignorance, to vse as meanes to preserue vnto vs those 
Mo∣numents

of 
Antiquitie.
 And therefore I could wish, that
they might be published in their owne 
Style,
 and (as it were)
in 
Puris Naturalibus,
 yea though they write false 
Latin,

as some of them do. On the other side, some of our 
Critikes

are so 
Criticall
 and so audacious, that when they publish any
of the foresayd 
Triumuiri,
 or any other 
Classicall Author,

they will transpose, and omit, and foyst into the 
Text
 many
words and many 
conceytes,
 whereof the 
Author
 neuer
dreamed, as 
Eustathius
 and 
Seruius
 haue done vpon 
Ho∣mer

and 
Virgill.
 But if algates some 
Enthusiasme
 haue
come vpon our 
Critikes,
 that hath reuealed vnto them 
tan∣quam
ex antro Trophonij,
 the certaintie of the 
Authors

writing and meaning, to be such as they haue confidently set
downe, let me be bold to intreate them, that they would muster
their conceytes in the 
Margine
 (if the 
Margine
 will hold
them: as I doubt it will not in this 
Hypercriticall
 world)
or else that they would reiect them (as some of them haue
done) to the later end of their publications, vnder the title of

Corrections, Castigations, Emendations, Animaduer∣sions,
Variae Lectiones,
 or such like, 
Vt suo quisque v∣tatur
iudicio & sensu abundet,
 That euery man may vse
his owne iudgment, and abound in his owne sense. But 
Male∣dicta
Glossa quae corrumpit Textum. Cursed be that
Glosse that corrupteth the Text.
 And sory I am, that
some of our later 
Diuines
 haue erred in this point, euen in
translating the 
Holy Scripture.


Another exception may be taken against the 
Paradoxes

that are maintayned in this 
Treatise,
 As namely, contrary
to the opinion of the old world, and of the auncient 
Philoso∣phers,




That the two Zones, Torrida, and Frigida, are
both habitable and inhabited.
 But hereunto if the 
Au∣thors

reasons here alleaged do not sufficiently answere, I do
referre them, that will not yeeld therein, to the excellent
Treatise of 
Iosephus a-Costa, de Natura Noui Orbis,

printed this last yeare, and composed by him in 
Anno
 1584.
in which 
Theologicall
 and 
Philosophicall
 worke, he doth
at large both by good reasons and also by his owne experience
proue this his position to be true. And therefore I protest vn∣to
you, it was one of the chiefe 
Motiues,
 which moued me to
translate this 
Report,
 to the end it might be more publikely
knowen, that it was not the single fancie of one man, touching
the temperature of these two 
Zones,
 but also of diuers others
that by their owne trauell haue tryed the certayntie thereof:
among whome, this 
Lopez
 was one, who deliuered this 
Re∣lation

in 
Anno
 1588, being foure yeares after the 
Treatise

made by 
Iosephus-a-Costa.
 And I do not doubt, but that
within few yeares you shall haue it confirmed by many others
that are and haue been trauellers, who haue not as yet publi∣shed
their knowledge and trials in this behalfe. In the meane
time we do great iniurie to them that haue been alreadie so
desirous to acquaint vs with their labours, and to make vs
know as much as they know vpon their credites and honesties:
when in stead of shewing our selues thankefull vnto them for
the same, we skoffe and mocke at them, and confidently sweare
that they are lyers, and opposite to all auncient 
Philoso∣phers.

But in a word, I will answere herein with an Argu∣ment,

which 
Aristotle
 vseth, 
. i. 
Siquidem in vsu est hominibus,
mentiri id quod credibile: existimare oportet & con∣trarium,
Incredibilia multa hominibus, contingere




vera:
 which for the better vnderstanding I must paraphrase
in 
English:
 If it be an vsuall thing among men, that when
a thing is reported, which is very credible and like to be true,
yet afterwards it falleth out to be a starke lye: Then must we
needes thinke on the contrary, That many Reports or things
which are incredible, do in the end fall out to be true. In
which case, as 
Credulitie
 leaneth a little to 
Foolerie,
 so

Incredulitie
 smelleth somewhat of 
Atheisme.


Another Paradox is, 
That the heate of the Sunne
is not the cause of Whitenesse or Blacknesse in the
Skinnes of men.
 This 
Position
 in the 
Negatiue
 he may
safely defend against all 
Philosophers,
 by vertue of the rea∣sons
that he hath vouched in this 
Report,
 which in deede do
vtterly ouerthrow their 
Affirmatiue.
 But because neither
any auncient Writer before this age, nor he himselfe, hath
euer been able to declare the true cause of these colours in hu∣mane
bodies, very honestly and modestly he leaueth it vnde∣cided,
and referreth it to some secret of Nature, which hi∣therto
hath been knowne to God alone, and neuer as yet reuea∣led
to man. And therefore I do wish, that some sound 
Natu∣rall
Philosopher,
 such as 
Fernelius
 that wrote 
De abdi∣tis
rerum causis,
 or as 
Leuinus Lemnius de Occultis
Naturae miraculis,
 or as 
Franciscus Valesius de Sacra
Philosophia,
 would enter into the 
Closet
 of 
Contempla∣tion,

to finde out the true 
Naturall
 cause thereof. In the
meane while I hold still with my 
Author
 in the 
Negatiue.


The third 
Paradoxe
 touching the 
Amazones
 mentio∣ned
in this booke, I do not see, why it should be counted a 
Pa∣radox

to beleeue, that there is such a 
Nation,
 considering
how many 
Authors
 both 
Greeke
 and 
Latine,
 both 
Histo∣riographers

and 
Cosmographers,
 both 
Diuine
 and 
Pro∣phane,

haue acknowledged that 
Nation,
 and the 
Coun∣trey





wherein it inhabited. But our new Writers say, that
a little after 
King Alexanders
 death it was vtterly ouer∣throwne
and quite extinguished. What? 
Vsque ad vnam?

not one of them left aliue? Certainely that depopulation must
needes proceede, either from the peculiar visitation of God al∣mighties
owne hand, or else it was the strangest slaughter that
euer was heard of, that of a whole 
Nation,
 being so populous
as that was, there should not remaine some few, that escaped.
But yet suppose that some 
Hypsiphile,
 or 
Penthesilea,
 or

Thalestris,
 or some such other, did wisely conueigh hir selfe
away, 
cum Dijs Penatibus, cum Matre, & cum filia,

and being guided by some happie 
Venus,
 arriued in a farre
remote 
Region,
 and there obserued the customes and fashions
of their owne 
Natiue Countrey:
 Might not these three,
together with some other women that were desirous of Rule
and gouernment, and allured by them to be of their 
Socie∣tie;

might not they (I say) in processe of time, (for it is a long
time since 
Alexander
 died) breede a 
New Nation
 of 
A∣mazones,

although we neuer heard, in what 
Climate
 they
remained? Yea it may be for any thing that I know, this latter
generation might growe againe to be so populous, that they
could send foorth 
Colonies
 from them into other places, and
so plant themselues in diuers 
Countreys.
 For I heare that
there are of them about 
Guiana,
 and heere in this 
Report

I reade that some of them serue in the warres of the 
King
 of

Monomotapa.
 And I hope that in good time, some good

Guianian
 will make good proofe to our 
England,
 that there
are at this day both 
Amazones,
 and 
Headlesse men.
 And
thus much for the 
Paradoxes.


The last exception which may be made against this booke,
is the discourse of the 
Conuersion
 of the 
Kingdome
 of

Congo
 to 
Christianitie,
 which is amplified, and set out with




such 
Miracles
 and 
Superstitious Vanities,
 as though it
had been plotted of purpose for the glorie and aduancement
of the 
Pope
 and his 
Adherents:
 Wherein, because it doth
concerne matter of 
Religion,
 I will deale more warily and
seriously to satisfie my 
Reader.
 True it is that the 
Inhabi∣tants

of 
Congo
 were all 
Pagans
 and 
Heathens,
 vntill
they entertayned Traffike with the 
Portingales:
 Among
whome, one 
Massing Priest
 became a meanes to conferre with
a 
Noble Man
 of 
Congo
 concerning 
Christianitie,
 who
taking liking thereof, as being a 
Man
 of good inclination and
disposition, was very desirous to be further instructed. The

Priest
 being wise, tooke oportunitie to make way for his

Countreymens
 traffike, and also for planting of the 
Chri∣stian
Faith
 in that 
Region,
 It may be in hope to be prefer∣red
and aduanced in a new established 
Church,
 as com∣monly
our trauelling 
Priests
 vse to do, that wanting mainte∣nance,
or being vpon some occasion discontented at home,
do leape ouer sea into forreine partes, not for the desier which
they haue to gaine 
Christian Soules,
 or to preach the 
Gos∣pell,

but to procure to themselues either dignities or wealth.
But I do not say that this 
Priest
 was such a one: for I neither
haue reason nor authoritie so to say. For he sent ouer into

Portingall
 for some fellowes to helpe him, who being come
into 
Congo,
 laboured so much, that in time the 
King
 and
his people consented to become 
Christians.
 Then did the

Portingall-Priests
 bestirre themselues nimbly in 
Baptising

the 
King,
 the 
Queene,
 the 
Lordes,
 and the 
Commons.

They built 
Churches,
 they erected 
Altars,
 they set vp 
Cros∣ses,

and at last brought in a 
Bishop.
 And all this was done
(I must needes confesse) with all pompe and solemnitie, after
the 
Romish
 maner, which in deede is so plausible, as it is able
to allure any simple Man or Woman, euen with the very sight




thereof. Yet will I not denie, but that these 
Priests
 had a good
intent, and for my part I do beleeue that they were in 
bona
fide,
 because they conuerted a great part of the 
People,
 not
to 
Poperie,
 but to 
Christianitie,
 the true foundation of all

Religion.
 And this 
Action,
 which tendeth to the glory of

God,
 and may be a notable example to the 
World,
 of do∣ing
the like, shall it be concealed and not committed to me∣morie,
because it was performed by 
Popish Priests
 and 
Po∣pish
meanes?
 God forbid. 
S. Paule
 maketh mention of
diuers that preached 
Christ, Some of enuie and strife,
and not purely,
 and 
Some of loue and good will.
What then? Yet Christ is preached, whether it be vn∣der
pretence, or sincerely, and therein do I ioy.
 So these
Men are not to be regarded, whether they preached 
Christ

for vaineglory, and for maintenance of 
Poperie,
 or of a sin∣cere
minde: but certaine it is, that 
Christ
 was preached by
them,
 and therein ought we to ioy. In 
Marke
 and in 
Luke,
S. Iohn
 saith to 
Christ,
 
Maister, we sawe one casting
out Deuils in thy Name, but we forbad him, because
he followeth not with vs. Forbid him not
 (saith Christ)

for he that is not against vs, is with vs.
 If we see a 
Turke,

or a 
Iewe,
 or a 
Papist,
 vpon what pretence soeuer, seeke to
drawe any to 
Christ,
 or to driue the 
Deuill
 of 
Ignorance

out of any, let him alone, forbid him not, mislike him not,
for in that point hee is not against vs, nay peraduenture hee
may become one of vs.
 In the 
booke of Nombers,
 word
was brought to 
Moses,
 that 
Eldad and Medad prophe∣cied
in the hoast. And Iosua sayd, My Lord Moses
forbid them. But Moses sayd, Enuiest thou for my
sake? Would God that all the Lords people were
Prophets.
 And are we angrie, or shall we finde fault, that
the 
Portingall Priests
 being 
Papists,
 should be reported to




haue conuerted the 
Realme
 of 
Congo
 to the profession of

Christian Religion?
 Shall we enuie them in their well
doing? I for my part do earnestly wish with all my hart, that
not onely 
Papists
 and 
Protestants,
 but also all 
Sectaries,

and 
Presbyter-Iohns men
 would ioyne all together both
by word and good example of life to conuert the 
Turkes,
 the

Iewes,
 the 
Heathens,
 the 
Pagans,
 and the 
Infidels
 that
know not 
God,
 but liue still in darknesse, and in the shadow
of 
Death.
 What a singular commendation would it be vnto
vs, if it might be left in 
Record,
 that we were the first con∣uerters
of such a 
Nation,
 and such a people, and first brought
them to the knowledge of 
God,
 and the true profession of his
glorious 
Gospell?


Thus I haue (gentle 
Reader)
 laboured to satisfie such
scruples, as may arise in thy minde touching this 
Treatise:

which if it shall breede either profit or delight vnto thee,
I shall reioyce to my selfe: If not, I shall be sorie that
I haue employed my precious time so idly.
Farewell in 
Christ.


Abraham Hartwell.

A REPORTE OF
the kingdome of Congo, a Regi∣on
of Africa.


Gathered by Philippo Pigafetta, out of the discourses of
M. Edwarde Lopes a Portugall.




Chap. 1.
The iourney by sea from Lisbone to the kingdome of Congo.


I
N the yeare one thousande fiue
hundreth threescore and eygh∣teenth,
 when 
Don Sebastian
 king of

Portugall,
 embarked himselfe for
the conquest of the kingdome of

Marocco: Edwarde Lopes
 borne at

Beneuentum
 (a place xxiiii. myles
distant from 
Lisbone,
 neere vpon the South shore of the
riuer 
Tagus)
 sayled likewise in the moneth of Aprill to∣wardes
the hauen of 
Loanda,
 situate in the kingdome
of 
Congo,
 in a shippe called S. 
Anthony,
 belonging to an
vncle of his, and charged with diuerse marchandises
for that kingdome:
 And it was accompanied with a
Patache (which is a small vessell) whereunto the ship
did continually yeelde good guarde, & ministred great
reliefe, conducting and guiding the same with lightes




in the night time, to the ende it shoulde not loose the
way, which the ship it selfe did keepe. He arriued at the
Islande of 
Madera,
 belonging to the King of Portugal,

distant from 
Lisbone
 about sixe hundred myles, where
he remained xv. dayes, to furnish himselfe with freshe
vittaile and wine; which in great aboundance grow∣eth
in that Islande, yea and in mine opinion the best
in the world, whereof they carry abroad great store in∣to
diuers countries, & especially into England. He pro∣uided
there also sundry other confections & conserues
of Sugar, which in that Islande are made and wrought
both in great quantity, and also of singular excellency.
From this Islande they departed, leauing all the 
Cana∣ries

belonging to 
Castile,
 and tooke hauen at one of the
Islandes of 
Capo verde,
 called S. 
Anthony,
 without ha∣uing
any sight thereof before they were come vpon it:

and from thence to another Islande called 
Saint Iacopo,

which commaundeth all the rest, and hath a Bishoppe
and a Chaplen in it, that rule and gouerne them: and
here they prouided themselues againe of victuailes.


I doe not thinke it fitte in this place to tell you the
number of the Canarie Islands, which indeede are ma∣ny:
nor to make any mention of the Islandes of 
Capo
verde,
 nor yet to set downe the history and discourse
of their situations, because I make hast to the kingdome
of 
Congo:
 and the shippe stayed here but onely for pas∣sage,
and especially for that there doth not want good
store of Reportes and histories, which in particularity
doe make relation of these countries: Onely this I will
say,
 that these Islandes of 
Capo verde
 were established by

Ptolomee
 in the tables of his 
Geography,
 to be the begin∣ning
of the West, together with the Cape or Promon∣torie




which he termeth 
Cornu vltimum,
 or the Islandes

Macarie
 or 
Blessed,
 which we commonly call 
Fortunate.

In these Islandes of 
Capo verde
 the Portugalles do often
arriue, and in those countries do trafficke with sundry
marchandises, as little balles of diuers coloured glasse, &
other such things, wherein those people do greatly de∣light,
and Hollande cloth, and cappes and kniues, and
coloured clothes: In exchaunge whereof they bringe
back againe, slaues, wax, hony, with other kind of food,
and cotton-cloth of sundry colours. Moreouer, right
ouer against them within the lande are the countreyes
& riuers of 
Guynee,
 and of 
Capo verde,
 and 
Sterra Leona,

that is to say the Mountain 
Leona,
 which is a huge great
mountaine and very famous.


From the foresaide Islande of 
San Iacopo,
 they direc∣ted
their fore-decke towards Bresil: for so they must
do to gaine the winde, and taking such harboroughes
as were conuenient for the seasons that raigne in those
places,
 to arriue at the ende of their voyage. Two are
the waies, whereby they saile from the Isle of 
San Iaco∣po

to 
Loanda
 a hauen in the kingdome of 
Congo:
 the one
is by the coast of 
Africa,
 the other by the mayne Ocean,
still enlarging their course with the North winde,
which very much ruleth there in those Monethes, and
for the most parte is called North, euen by the Portu∣galles
themselues, & by the Castilians, & by the French,
and by all those people of the North sea. And so tur∣ning
their foreshippe to the South, and south-east, they
holde on forwarde till they be neere the Cape of 
Good-Hope,

leauing behind them the Kingdome of 
Angola;

for by that way they must afterwardes returne: & then
they come to the altitude of betweene xxvij. and xxix.




degrees beyond the equinoctiall, quite opposite to our
Pole, which South Pole in this writing shall be called
the Antarctike,
 that is to say, contrary to the Arctike,
which is our North Pole, and so the Antarctik is oppo∣site
thereunto towardes the South.


In that altitude then of the contrary Pole, the Say∣lers
vse to meete with certaine windes that they cal 
Ge∣nerali,

which doe blowe there almost all our Sommer,
and are termed by them 
Northeast,
 and 
Northeastes
 in
the plural number, and by vs Italians, 
Li venti dal Graeco,

that is to say, the windes betweene the Northeast, and
the Easte in the spring time: which peraduenture the
Venetians in their proper speech doe call 
Leuantiere,

that is to say, easterly, & the Greekes and Latines terme
them 
Etesii,
 that is to say, such winds as euery yeare do
ordinarily blow in their certayne and accustomed sea∣sons.


And thus sayling euen to xxix degrees of the An∣tarctik,
with the North winde, there falleth out an
admirable effect. For diuers saylers, perceyuing the
first Generall windes when they blowe, doe straight
turne their sailes about, and set their fore-ship directly
on the way to 
Angola,
 and so very oftentimes they fayle
and are deceyued. But better it is for him that desireth
to arriue at his wished hauen to go much further, & to
expect a lustie winde, and after to returne backwarde:
wherin it is to be noted for a most memorable accidēt,
that the windes do blow very strong from the North,
euen vnto xxix. degrees beyond the Equinoctiall, and
then they meete with other winds, which being more
fierce & furious then they are, doe driue them backe a∣gaine.
And this is vsuall and seasonable there for sixe




monethes in the yeare.


Now the ship called 
S. Anthony,
 holding on his fore∣said
course, met with the said Generall windes, & then
turned their prowe and their sayles, by North and by
Northwest on the right hand towardes the kingdome
of 
Congo.
 And sayling onwardes closely with the halfe
shippe, they came in twelue dayes and twelue nightes,
to the Islande of 
S. Elena,
 not looking for the same, nor
thinking of it.
 This Islande was so called, because
on the feast day of 
S. Helene,
 which falleth vppon the
thirde day of May, it was by the Portugalles first des∣cried.
And as it is very smal, so is it (as it were) singular
by it selfe: for being situate in the height of xvi. degrees
towardes the Antarctike, it contayneth in compasse
nine miles about, & is farre distant from the firme land.
As you sayle by sea, it may be discouered thirty myles
of, through certayne hilles: and it is a great miracle of
nature, that in so vnmeasurable an Ocean, being all a∣lone
and so little as it is, it shoulde arise (as it were) out
of a most tempestuous and deep sea, & yet yeeld a most
safe harborough, and most aboundant store of reliefe
and victuaile, for shippes that are forewearied, and rea∣dy
to perishe for thirst, which come out of the In∣dies.


The woodes of it are very thicke, and full of Ebene
trees,
 whereof the Mariners do builde their boates. In
the barkes of these trees you may see written the names
of an infinite number of Saylers,
 which passing by that
Islande, doe leaue their names cut and carued in the
sayde barkes, the letters whereof doe grow greater and
greater, as the bodies of the trees doe waxe greater in
bignes. The soyle (euen of it selfe) bringeth forth very




excellent fruites.
 For there groweth the vine, (which
was in deede at the first brought thether by the Portu∣galles)
and especially in the arbours and walkes that are
about the little Church, and in the lodgings that are
there for such as sayle thether.
 You shall see there also
huge wild woodes, of Orenges, of Citrones, of Limons
and other such Apple trees, that all the yeare long doe
carry flowers & fruites both ripe and vnripe. And like∣wise
Pomegranates, great and sweete, and of a good
indifferent taste, with kernelles great and redde, and ful
of pleasant iuyce, and the stones within them very smal:
and ripe they are at all seasons of the yeare, as the Oren∣ges
are: and figges very great both in quantity and a∣boundance:
which naturall gift and property (of being
ripe all the yeare long) 
Homere
 noted to bee in diuers
fruites of the Isle of 
Corfu.


Ouer all the countrey they take Goates,
 and wilde
Kiddes, that are very good to eate, and Boares and o∣ther
foure-footed beasts, and Partriches, and wild hens
and Pigeons, and other kindes of foules, both great &
small. All which beastes and fowles are so secure and
so tame, that they feare not a man, because they doe not
know in what daunger they are to be killed. So that the
people which dwell there doo take of them dayly, and
poulder them with salte, that is congealed on the banks
of the Islande in certaine caues and holes of the rockes,
that are naturally made hollow and eaten by the waues
of the sea. And the flesh thereof being thus preserued,
they giue to the Saylers that arriue at the Island.


The earth is as it were crommeled like ashes,
 of co∣lour
redde, very fat and fruitfull beyond measure, and
so soft, as if ye treade on it with your foote; it will sinke




like sande, and the very trees will shake with the force
of a man. And therefore it needeth no labour or tillage:
for when it raigneth, the fruites doe presently spring vp
out of the olde seede. It beareth rootes of Radish as
bigge as a mans legge,
 and very good to eate. There
growe also Colewortes, and Parsley, and Lettise, and
Goordes, and Chiche-person, and Faselles, and other
kindes of Pulse, naturally: which being ripe doo fall in∣to
the fruitfull grounde, and multiply of themselues,
and spring agayne without any tilling. Euery shippe
that commeth thether, bringeth with it some fruyte or
garden hearbe, which being planted taketh roote pre∣sently:
and bountifull nature yeeldeth a courteous re∣warde
and vsury, by reseruing the fruite thereof for the
Saylers when the ship returneth againe.


There are certaine little Riuers in this Islande,
 that
runne in diuerse partes of it: whose water is good
and wholesome, and wherein are sundry safe places for
ships to ryde in, as if they were hauens. But the prin∣cipall
of them is in a place, where they haue erected a
little Church, wherein are kept the ornamentes of the
Altar, and the priestes vestimentes, and other necessaries
for Masse. And when shippes passe that way, the Re∣ligious
persons go downe vnto them to celebrate di∣uine
seruice.


There is also in the same place a little cottage, where∣in
for the most parte some Portingalles doo remayne,
sometimes three, sometimes two, yea and sometimes
but one alone, being left there, eyther by reason of
some infirmitie, or for some offence committed, or
else euen voluntarily, because they doe desire by this
meanes to leade the life of an Heremite in that wilder∣nesse,




and so to doe penaunce for their sinnes.


Moreouer,
 in the same place there is so great aboun∣daunce
of fish, as if the sea were very neere vnto them:
so that you shall not need but onely to cast your hooks
into the water, and you shall presently drawe them out
againe loaden with fish.


I once demanded the questiō,
 what reason there was,
why the Portingals did neuer make any accompt, nor
had any care to fortifie this Island, considering it was so
fit and necessary for saylers, and founded there (as it
were by the prouidence of God) for the reliefe of the
Portingals which passe that way, as 
Granata
 doth large∣ly
discourse vpon the Creede, first written by him in
Spanishe, and since translated by my selfe into Italian:
But aunswere was made vnto mee, that there was no
need so to doo: for that the Islande serueth to no pur∣pose
for the voyage into the Indies, because there is
another way for that passage, and it is also a very harde
matter to finde it out: but in returning from thence it
lyeth full in the way, and is very easily descried. So that
it woulde not quite the cost to bestow money & time
in maintayning souldiers therein without any profite,
seeing none other vessels come thither but onely the
Portugals. And when I replyed, that the English had
nowe twice entred into those seas;
 once vnder the con∣duct
of 
Drake,
 and secondly this year 1588. vnder ano∣ther
Pirate, being also an English man and more valiant
then hee, called 
Candish,
 who is returned home ful of
great richesse: It was aunswered, that yet for all that it
coulde not possibly bee brought to passe to fortifie the
same within a sea being so farre off, and seeing that
all the prouision which should build there, must of ne∣cessity




bee brought out of Europe.


To be short,
 besides all these naturall good giftes
aboue rehearsed, the climate is temperate, the ayre
pure, cleane and holesome, and the winds which blow
there are very pleasaunt. So that sicke persons, and such
as were halfe deade with the diseases of the sea, arry∣uing
at this Island, haue beene presently healed, and
recouered their former strength, through the benigni∣ty
of this Country.


From the Islande of 
S. Helena,
 they made sayle with
the same weather, and so within the space of xvij. dayes
came to the hauen of 
Loanda,
 which is in the prouince
of 
Congo,
 the windes being somewhat more calme then
they were afore. This is a very sure, and a great hauen,
so called of an Islande of the same name, whereof wee
shall speake hereafter.


I told you before, there were two courses of sayling
from the Islands of 
Capo verde
 to 
Loanda;
 the one of thē
is now declared, which beeing neuer vsed afterwardes,
was at the first attempted and performed by the same
ship wherein 
Signor Odoardo
 went, being then guided
by 
Francesco Martinez
 the kings Pilot, a man very great∣ly
experienced in those seas, and the first that euer con∣ducted
vessell by that way: the other is atchieued by
passing along the coast of the firme lande.


From the Island of 
San Iacomo,
 they come to 
Capo
dos Palmas,
 and from thence direct themselues to the
Islande of 
San Thomas,
 which lyeth vnder the Equino∣ctial,
so called because it was discouered vpon that day,
wherein the feast of that Apostle is vsed to bee celebra∣ted.
It is distant from the firme lande CLxxx. myles,
right against the riuer called Gaban, which is so termed




because it is in shape very like to that kinde of vesture
that it is called a Gaban or a cloake.


The hauen thereof is fore-closed with an Island that
raiseth it selfe in the chanell of the riuer,
 whereunto the
Portingalles do sayle with small barkes from 
S. Thomas

Islande, carrying thether such thinges as vsually they
carry to the coast of 
Guinea,
 and from thence carrying
backe with them Iuory, waxe & hony, Oyle of Palme,
and blacke-More slaues. Neere to the Islande of 
S.
Thomas
 towardes the the North lyeth another Islande, cal∣led
the Isle of the Prince,
 distant from the firme lande
an hundred and fiue miles, being of the same conditi∣on
and trafficke, that the Isle of 
S. Thomas
 is, although
in circuite somewhat lesse. This Islande of 
S. Thomas

is in fashion almost rounde,
 and in breadth contayneth
Lx. miles, and in compasse Clxxx. Very rich it is and
of great trafficke, discouered at the first and conquered
by the Portingalles, at such time as they began the con∣quest
of the Indies. It hath diuers hauens, but the prin∣cipal
and chiefest of all, whereinto the vesselles arriuing
there, doe withdraw themselues, is in the place, where
the Cittie standeth.


The Islande breedeth an infinite deale of Sugar, &
almost all kinds of victuals.
 In the Citty there are some
Churches, and a Bishoppe, with many Clerks and one
Chaplen or Prieste. There is also a Castell, with a
garrison and Artillary in it, which beat vpon the hauen,
being a very great and a safe Port, where many shippes
may ride. But a very straunge and admirable thing it
is, that when the Portugals did first come thether, there
was no sugar there planted, but they brought it thether
from other Countreys:
 as they did Ginger also, which




tooke roote, & grew there in most aboundant manner.
The soyle in deed is moyst, and as it were appropriated
to foster the Sugar Cane, which without any other wa∣tering,
multiplyeth of it selfe, and fructifieth infinitely:
the reason whereof is, because the dewe falleth there
like rayne and moisteneth the earth.


There are in this Island aboue Lxx. houses or presses
for making of Sugar,
 and euery presse hath many cot∣tages
about it as though it were a village, & there may
bee about some three hundred persons that are appoin∣ted
for that kinde of worke: They do euery yeare loade
about fortie great shippes with sugar. True it is indeed
that not long ago the wormes (as it were a plague to
that land) haue deuoured the rootes of the Canes, and
destroyed the fruites of their sugar, in such sort, as now
of the forty shippes, they do not load aboue fiue or sixe
vessels with that marchandise. And therevpon it com∣meth
that sugar is growen so deare in those Coun∣treyes.


The Island of 
S. Thomas
 holdeth trafficke with the
people that dwell in the firme lande, which do vsually
resort to the mouthes or entries of their Riuers: The
first whereof (to begin withal) is named the riuer of

Fernando di Poo,
 that is to say, of 
Fernando Pouldre,
 who
did first discouer the same, and lieth in fiue degrees to∣wardes
our Pole. Right against the mouth of it, ryseth
an Island of the same name,
 lying thirty and sixe miles
distant from it. The seconde Riuer is called 
Bora,
 that
is to say,
 
Filth.
 The thirde 
La riuiera del Campo:
 The
fourth, 
di San Benedetto,
 and the fifth, that of 
Angra,

which in the mouth of it hath an Islande called 
di Coris∣co,

that is to say 
Thonder.
 All these doe trafficke the same




marchaundises, which we mentioned before.


But to returne to the voyage of 
S. Thomas:
 Depar∣ting
from thence towardes the South, wee found the
Cape of 
Lupo Gonzale,
 which standeth in the altitude
of one degree beyonde the Equinoctiall towardes the
Pole Antarctike, a hundred & fiue miles distant from
the foresaid Isle. And from thence they sayle with land
winds, creeping stil all along the coast, and euery day
casting ancre in some safe place, either behynde some
point, or else in some hauen, vntill they come to the
mouth of the greatest Riuer in 
Congo,
 called in their
tongue 
Zaire,
 which signifieth in Latine 
Sapio,
 (in
English 
I knowe.)
 From whence if ye will go through
to the hauen of 
Loanda,
 yee must saile the length of an
hundred and fourescore miles.


These bee the two voyages by sea, that bee vsed
from the Islande of 
San Iacomo,
 which is one of those
Islandes, that before wee tolde you were the Islandes
of 
Capo verde,
 & was but a little while ago first begun to
be frequented.


And nowe it is time to intreate of the kingdome of

Congo,
 and all the conditions thereof.








Chap. 2.
Of the temperature of the ayre of the kingdome of Congo,
and whether it bee very colde or hote: whether the men
be white or blacke: whether are more or lesse blacke they
that dwell in the hilles, or those that dwell in the playnes:
Of the winds and the raynes, and the snowes in those quar∣ters,
and of what stature and semblaunce the men of that
Countrey are.


T
He Kingdome of 
Congo
 in the
middle part therof,
 is distant from
the Equinoctiall towardes the
Pole Antarctike (iust where the
Cittie called 
Congo
 doth lie) seuen
degrees and two thirdes: so that it
standeth vnder the Region which
auncient writers thought to be vnhabitable, and called
it 
Zona Torrida,
 (that is to say, 
a Cincture or Girdle of the
earth, which is burnt by the heat of the Sun)
 wherin they are
altogether deceiued.
 For the habitation there is excee∣ding
good, the ayre beyonde all credite temperate, the
winter nothing so rough, but is rather like Autumne in
this Region of 
Rome.
 The people vse no furres, nor
chaunge of apparell: they come not neere the fire: nei∣ther




is the colde in the toppes of the Mountaines grea∣ter
then that which is in the plaines: but generally in
Winter time the ayre is more hote then it is in som∣mer,
by reason of their continual raynes, and especially
about two houres before & after Noone, so that it can
hardely be endured.


The men are blacke,
 & so are the women, and some
of them also somewhat inclyning to the colour of the
wilde Oliue. Their hayre is black & curled, and some
also red. The stature of the men is of an indifferent big∣nes,
and excepting their blacknes they are very like to
the Portingalles. The apples of their eies are of diuerse
colours, blacke and of the colour of the sea. Their lips
are not thicke, as the 
Nubians
 and other Negroes are:
and so likewise their countenaunces are some fat, some
leane, and some betweene both, as in our countreyes
there are, and not as the 
Negroes
 of 
Nubia
 and 
Guinea,

which are very deformed.
 Their nights and their daies
doo not greatly differ: for in all the whole yeare yee
shall not discerne the difference betweene them to bee
more then a quarter of an houre,


The Winter in this countrey (to speake at large) be∣ginneth
at the same time,
 that our Spring here begin∣neth,
that is to say, when the Sun entreth into the Nor∣thren
signes, in the Moneth of 
March.
 And at the same
time that we haue our winter, whē the Sun entreth in∣to
the Southern Signs in the moneth of 
September,
 then
beginneth their sommer. In their winter it rayneth 5.
monethes almost continually, that is to say, in 
April,
May, June, July
 & 
August.
 Of faire daies they haue but a
few, because the raine falleth so greatly, & the drops of
it are so big, as it is a wonder to see. These waters doe




maruellously supple the grounde, which is then very
drie, by reason of the heate of the Sommer past, where∣in
it neuer rayneth for the space of sixe monethes to∣gether,
and after the ground is full and as it were ingor∣ged
with water, then do the riuers swell beyond all cre∣dite,
and are so replenished with troubled waters, that
all the countrey is surrounded by them.


The windes which blow in these Moones through
all this region,
 are the very selfe same that 
Cesar
 calleth
by a Greeke worde 
Etesij,
 that is to say, 
Ordinary euery
yeare:
 whereby are meant those winds that in the 
Cearde

are noted from the North to the West, and from the
North to the Northeast. These windes doo driue the
cloudes to the huge and high mountaines, whereupon
they rush with very great violence, and being there stai∣ed
of their owne nature, they are afterwardes melted
into water. So that when it is likely to raine, you shall
see the cloudes standing (as it were) vpon the toppes of
their highest hils.


And hence ariseth the encreasing and augmentati∣on
of the riuers that spring in 
Aethiopia,
 and especially
of 
Nilus
 and others, that discharge themselues into the
east and west Ocean: And in the kingdome of 
Congo

and 
Guinea,
 through which runneth the riuer 
Nigir,
 so
called by the auncient writers, and by the newe termed

Senega,
 you shall see the saide riuer encrease at the very
selfe same time that 
Nilus
 doth; but in deed carrieth his
waters towards the west, directly against the Islandes
of 
Capo Verde,
 whereas 
Nilus
 runneth by the Isle of 
Me∣roe

in 
Egipt
 towardes the North, refreshing and wate∣ring
all those Regions that are full of scorching heates,
and wildernesses and deserts. Now for as much as in




the regions of 
Congo
 and 
Aethiopia
 it is alwaies wont to
rayne euery yeare at a certaine set tyme, the swelling
and ouerflowing of the riuers there, is of no great
consideration, nor any straunge accident to make ac∣compt
of.


But in the Countries,
 that are farre distant and very
drie, as in 
Aegypt,
 where it neuer raineth (sauing onely
in 
Alexandria
 and the territories thereof) it is accoun∣ted
a maruellous matter, to see euery yeare so great a
quantity of thicke troubled water come vppon them,
from places so remote, at a certaine set tyme, without
missing: which water doth quicken the grounde, and
ministreth foode both to man and beast. And there∣vpon
the auncients did sacrifice to that riuer, calling it

, the 
good God,
 as 
Ptolomy
 noteth in his fourth
booke. Yea and some of our Christians at this day doo
hold it for a miracle. So that without these waters they
shoulde perish for hunger, because their liues do de∣pende
vpon this increase of the water, as 
S. Chrysostome

saith.


Thus these windes called by 
Cesar Etesij,
 and by the
Portugalles 
Generali,
 do blow with vs in Sommer; but
with them in winter, and carry the cloudes vnto the
toppes of those huge mountaines, which make them to
melt into raine. And so it falleth out that by reason of
these raines, their winter (as it is aforesaid) is nothing so
colde, because the waters do engender a certayne kind
of warmth in those hot regions. This is then the cause
of the increase of 
Nilus,
 & other riuers in that Climate,
whereof the ancients of old times made so great doubt,
and inuented so many fables and errours


But in their sommer, which is our winter, there blow




other windes that are quite opposite to the former,
 e∣uen
in 
Diametro,
 and are noted in the 
Carde,
 from the
South to the southeast, which out of all question must
needes be colde, because they breath from the contra∣ry
Pole Antarctike, and coole all those countreyes, euen
for all the worlde as our windes in Sommer doo coole
our countreyes. And whereas, there with them, these
windes do make the ayre very fayre and cleere, so doo
they neuer come vnto vs, but they bring with them
great store of raine. And this commeth to passe by a
certain naturall disposition of the earth which is gouer∣ned
by the Heauens and the Clymates thereof, and
by the soueraigne prouidence of God, who hath
parted the heauen, and the course of the sunne and of
the other planets in such sort, that euery countrey vpon
the face of the earth, doth inioy the vertue of their
lightes, both in heate, and in colde, and also in all other
seasons of the yeare, by a most singular measure and
proportion. And certainly if the breath of these winds
did not refresh and coole these countries of 
Aethiopia
 &

Congo,
 and other places neere about them, it were not
possible for them to endure the heate, considering that
euen in the night tyme they are constrayned to hange
two coueringes ouer them to keep away the heat. The
same cooling and refreshing by windes, is common also
to the inhabitants of the Isle of 
Candie,
 & of the Islandes
in 
Arcipelago,
 and of 
Cyprus,
 and of 
Asia
 the 
lesse,
 and of

Soria,
 and of 
Aegypt,
 which doe liue (as it were) with
this refreshing of the foresaid winds of the Northwest,
and of the West: so that they may well be called as they
are in Greeke 
Zephyri quasi
 
,
 breeders of life.


Let it bee also remembred, that in the mountaines of





Aethiopia,
 and of 
Congo
 & the regions neere adioyning,
there falleth no snow, neither is there any at all in the
very toppes of them, sauing onely towardes the Cape
of 
Good-Hope,
 and certaine other hilles, which the Por∣tugalles
call, 
Sierra Neuada,
 that is to say, the 
Snowie
mountaines.
 Neyther is there anye ice or snow to bee
founde in all the Countrey of 
Congo,
 which would bee
better esteemed there then golde, to mingle with their
drinkes: So that the riuers there doo not swell and in∣crease
by melting of snow, but because the raine doth
fall out of the cloudes for fiue whole Moones continu∣ally
together, that is to lay in 
April, May, Iune, Iuly,
 &

August:
 the first raine sometimes beginning on the xv.
day, and sometimes after. And this is the cause why
the newe waters of 
Nilus,
 which are so greatly desired &
expected by the inhabitaunts there, do arriue sooner or
later in 
Aegipt.






Chap. 3.
Whether the children which are begotten by Portugalles, be∣ing
of a white skinne, and borne in those Countries by the
women of Congo, bee blacke or white, or Tawney like a
wilde oliue, whom the Portugals call Mulati.


A
L the auncient writers haue certainly
beleeued,
 that the cause of blacke co∣lour
in men is from the heate of the
Sun. For by experience it is founde,
that the neerer wee approach to the
cuntries of the 
South,
 the browner &




blacker are the inhabitants therein. And contrariwise,
the farther you go towardes the north, the whiter shall
you finde the men, as the 
French,
 & the 
Dutch,
 & the

English,
 and others. Notwithstanding it is as certaine a
thing as may be, that vnder the 
Equinoctiall,
 there are
people which are borne almost all white, as in the king∣dome
of 
Melinde
 & 
Mombaza
 situate vnder the 
Equino∣ctial,

& in the Isle of 
San Thomas
 which lieth also vnder
the same Clymate, and was at the first inhabited by the
Portingalles, though afterwardes it was disinhabited,
and for the space of a hundred yeares and vpwardes
their children were continually white, yea and euery
day still become whiter and whiter. And so likewise
the children of the Portingals, which are borne of the
women of 
Congo,
 do incline somewhat towards white.
So that 
Signor Odoardo
 was of opinion, that the blacke
colour did not spring from the heate of the Sunne, but
from the nature of the seede, being induced thereunto
by the reasons aboue mentioned. And surely this his
opinion is confirmed by the testimony of 
Ptolome,
 who
in his discription of the innermost partes of 
Lybia
 ma∣keth
mention of white 
Ethiopians
 which hee calleth in
his language 
; that is to say, white Moores,
and in another place also of white Elephants, which are
in the same countrey.








Chap. 4.
Of the circuite of the Kingdome of Congo, and of the bor∣ders
and confines thereof. And first of the Westerne coast.


T
He Kingdome of 
Congo
 is distingui∣shed
by foure borders: The first, of the
West, which is watered with the O∣cean
sea: the seconde of the North:
the thirde of the east, & the last which
is towardes the South.


And to beginne with the border lying vpon the sea,
the first part of it is in the Bay,
 called 
Seno delle Vacche,
 &
is situate in the height of 13. degrees vpon the Antarctik
side, and stretcheth all along the coast vnto 4. degrees
and a halfe on the North side, neere to the Equinoctial;
which space contayneth 630. miles. This 
Seno delle vac∣che

is a hauen but of a moderate bignes, and yet a good
one & able to receiue any ship that arriueth. It is called

Seno delle vacche,
 that is to say, the Bay of 
Cowes,
 because
thereabouts there are pasturing very many heardes of
that kind of Cattel: The country is plain, & aboundeth
with all manner of victuailes: and there you shall find
some kinde of mettels to be publikely solde, especially
siluer, and it is subiect to the King of 
Angola.


A little more forwarde lyeth the Riuer 
Bengleli,

where a certaine Lorde, being subiect to the King of

Angola
 doth specially commande: and about the said




Riuer is a great compasse of countrey, much like to the
former. And a little further runneth the riuer 
Songa,

so called by the Portingalles: wherein you may sayle
25. miles vpwardes in a country also like to the former.
The followeth the riuer 
Coanza,
 which issueth out of
a little lake,
 fedde by a certaine riuer that floweth out
of a great lake, being the chiefe and principal spring or
head of 
Nilus,
 wherof in the other part of this discourse
we shall haue occasion to write. 
Coanza
 at the mouth
of it is two miles broade, and you may sayle with small
barkes vpwardes against the streame about 100. miles,
but hath no hauen. And here it is to be noted, that all
this Country which we haue here described, was wont
to be subiect to the king of 
Congo:
 but a while ago the
Gouernour of that countrey is become the absolute
Lorde thereof, and professeth himselfe to bee a friende
to the king of 
Congo,
 but not his vassall: and yet some∣times
he sendeth the King some present, in manner of
a tribute.


Beyond the Riuer 
Coanza
 is the hauē of 
Loanda
 being
in ten degrees, made (as it is said) by a certaine Island
called 
Loanda,
 which signifieth in that lauguage, 
Bald
 or

Shauen,
 because it is a Countrey without any hilles and
very low: for indeed it scarce rayseth it selfe aboue the
sea. This Island was framed of the sand and durt of the
sea, and of the riuer 
Coanza,
 whose waues meeting to∣gether,
and the filthy matter sinking downe there to the
bottome, in a continuance of time it grew to be an Island.
It may be about 20. miles long, and one mile broade at
the most, and in some places but onely a bowshoote.
But it is a maruellous thing, that in such a sandy ground
if you shall digge to the depth of two or three hande-breadthes




you shall finde sweete water, the best in all
those Countreyes. Wherein also there is a very strange
effect, that when the 
Ocean
 ebbeth, this water becom∣meth
somewhat salte, but when it floweth to the top,
it is most sweete. A thing that falleth out also in the
Islande of 
Cadis
 in 
Spayne,
 by the report and testimo∣ny
of 
Strabo.


This Islande is the 
Mine
 of all the money which
the King of 
Congo
 spendeth,
 and all the people therea∣boutes.
For vppon the shores you shall haue certayne
women, that vse to diue and ducke into the sea, two
yardes deepe and more, and fill their baskets with sand,
and afterwardes diuide the grauell from certayne smal

Shel-fishes
 that are among it, which are called 
Lumache:

& when these 
Lumache
 are seuered by themselues, then
doe they picke out the 
Males
 from the 
Females,
 which
they may easily do, because the 
Female
 is more fine then
the 
Male,
 and greatly esteemed for her colour, which is
very neat, bright and pleasant to the sight.


These 
Lumache
 doo breede in all the shores of the
kingdome of 
Congo,
 but the best of all are those of 
Lo∣anda,

because they looke very fine, and of a very bright
colour, some gray or ashecoloured, and some of other
colours not so precious. And here you must note that
gold and siluer and mettell is not of any estimation, nor
in vse of money in these countreyes, but onely these 
Lu∣mache:

so that neither with golde nor siluer, in masse or
in coine you shal buy any thing there, but with these

Lumache
 you shall buy both golde and siluer, or any
thing els.


In this Islande there are 7. or 8. 
Townes,
 called
in that Country language, 
Libata,
 the principal where∣of




is 
Spirito sancto:
 and therein dwelleth the Gouer∣nour
which is sent from 
Congo,
 to minister iustice, and
to gather the treasure of the moneyes of these 
Lumache.

Here are also 
Goates,
 and 
Sheepe,
 and 
Boares
 in great
numbers, which being tame at the first, do afterwardes
become wilde and liue in the woods. Here groweth
also a tree called 
Enzanda,
 which is a great one and al∣waies
greene,
 and endued with a singular qualitie. For
from the bowes of it that sproute vpwardes, there hang
downe certaine threedes (as it were) which creeping
into the earth do take roots, & out from these roots do
rise other trees, & so they multiply. And within the out∣most
barke thereof, there groweth a certaine kind of pil
like fine linnen, which being beaten and cleansed, they
spreade out in length and in breadth, and therewith
they cloath their men and women, that are of the basest
sort.


In this Islande they haue certaine vessels, made of
the bodies of 
Palme-trees,
 ioyned together and framed
after the manner of our boates, with a prowe and a
sterne, wherin they passe from place to place, both with
oares and sayles. In these boates they vse to fish about
the riuers, which are indeede exceeding full of fish, and
sometime also they will go ouer to the firme lande.


In that part of this Islande, which is towardes the
maine land, in certaine lowe places there grow certaine
trees (which when the water of the 
Ocean
 ebbeth) di∣scouer
themselues: and at the feet thereof you shal find
certaine other 
Shel-fishes
 cleauing as fast to the trees as
may bee,
 hauing within them a great fish as bigge as a
mans hande, and very good meate. The people of the
countrey know them very well, and call them 
Ambizia∣matare,





that is to say,
 the 
Fishe of the Rocke.
 The shels
of these fishes, they vse to burne, and thereof make very
good lime to builde withall. And being like the corke
or barke of the tree which is called 
Manghi,
 they dresse
their Oxe hydes withall, to make their shooe soles the
stronger.


To be briefe this Island bringeth forth neither corne
nor wine,
 but there is great store of victuaile brought
thether from all parts thereaboutes, to fetch away these

Lumache.
 For as in all other places all things may be had
for money of mettell, so all things here are had for 
Lu∣mache.

Whereby may bee noted, that not onely here
in this kingdome of 
Congo,
 but also in her neighbour 
E∣thiopia

and in 
Africa,
 and in the kingdomes of 
China,
 &
certaine others of the 
Indies,
 they vse moneyes of other
matter then of mettall, that is to say, neyther golde, nor
siluer, nor copper, nor any other mixture tempered of
these. For in 
Aethiopia
 their money is 
Pepper:
 and in
the kingdome of 
Tombutto,
 which is about the Riuer

Nigir,
 otherwise called 
Senega,
 their money is 
Cockles

or 
Shelfishe:
 and among the 
Azanaghi
 their moneyes
are 
Porcellette:
 and in the kingdome of 
Bengala
 likewise
they vse 
Porcellette
 and mettall together. In 
China
 they
haue certaine 
Shelfishes,
 called also 
Porcellette,
 which
they vse for their money: & in other places 
Paper
 stam∣ped
with the kings seale, and the barks of the tree called

Gelsomora:
 Whereby it appeareth, that the money
which is payed for euerie thing is not mettall, all the
worlde ouer, as it is in 
Europe,
 and in many and sundry
other countries of the earth.


This Islande in the straitest part of it, is very neere to
the firme lande, and the people do oftentimes swimme




ouer the channell there. In this straite there arise out of
the 
Ocean
 certaine 
Islettes,
 which shewe themselues
forth from the water when it ebbeth, and are couered a∣gaine
when it floweth. And in those Islettes you shall
see great trees, and most excellent 
Shelfishes
 cleauing
fast to the bodies of them, such as I tolde you of be∣fore.


Neere to this Islande towardes the outwarde coast
to the sea,
 there swim an innumerable sorte of Whales,
that looke blacke, and fighting one with another doe
kill themselues: which afterwardes being by the waues
cast vp vpon the shore, as bigge as a midling marchants
shippe; the 
Negroes
 goe forth with their boates to
fetch them, and to take the oyle out of them, which be∣ing
mingled with pitch they vse to trimme their vessels
withall. Vpon the ridges or backes of these creatures,
there growe many 
Shelfishes,
 made like 
Snailes, Cockles

and 
Whelkes:
 whereof 
Signor Odoardo
 affirmed, that hee
had seene great store. He was also of opinion that 
Am∣ber

commeth not from these fishes. For ouer all the
coast of 
Congo,
 where there is an infinite number of
them,
 you shal not finde either 
Ambregriz,
 or any other

Amber,
 blacke or white in any place. And yet if it should
come from these creatures, there must haue beene of
necessity great store of it founde vpon these Shores.


The principall hauen of this Island hath his entrance
towardes the North,
 and on that side it is halfe a mile
broade, and of a very great depth. Vpon the firme land
directly ouer against the Island is a towne called 
villa di
San Paulo,
 altogether inhabited with Portingalles, and
their wiues, which they brought with them out of

Spaine:
 and yet it is not fortified.






All this channell is very full of fish, especially of 
Sar∣dinaes,

and of 
Anchioues:
 whereof there is so great store,
that in the winter time they will of themselues leape vp
to land. Other kindes of most excellent fishes there are,
as 
Soles
 and 
Sturgeons
 and 
Barbelles,
 and all manner of
dainty fish: and great 
Crabbes,
 in straunge aboundance,
and all very wholesome: so that the greatest parte of
the people that dwel about the banks there, do liue vp∣on
them.


Into this channell runneth the Riuer called 
Bengo,

which is a very great one, & nauigable vpwardes xxv.
miles. This Riuer with that other of 
Coanza,
 whereof
I tolde you before, doe make the Isle of 
Loanda,
 because
when their waters do meete together, they leaue their
sande and filth behind them, and so increase the Island.
There runneth also into it another great Riuer called

Dande,
 which wil receiue vessels of an hundred tunne:
& then another Riuer called 
Lemba,
 which neither hath
Hauen, neyther do any Shippes enter into it. Very
neere vnto this there is also another Riuer called 
Ozone,

which issueth out of the same 
Lake,
 whence 
Nilus
 like∣wise
springeth, and it hath a hauen. Next to 
Ozone,
 there
is another called 
Loze,
 without any hauen: and then a∣nother
great one with a hauen called 
Ambriz,
 which
runneth within foure leagues neere to the Royall Citty
of 
Congo.
 Last of all is the Riuer 
Lelunda,
 which signifi∣eth
a 
Trowtfish,
 and watereth the rootes of that great hil,
wheron the pallace of 
Congo
 standeth,
 called by the Por∣tingalles
the 
Oteiro.
 This Riuer 
Lelunda
 springeth out
of the same 
Lake,
 from whence 
Coanza
 issueth, and ta∣keth
into it by the way another Riuer, that commeth
from the great 
Lake:
 and when it doth not raine, then




you may passe ouer 
Lelunda
 on foote, because it hath so
little store of water in it.


Next vnto this is the 
Zaire,
 a huge Riuer and a large,
and in deed the greatest in all the kingdome of 
Congo.

The original of this Riuer commeth out of three 
Lakes:

one is the great 
Lake
 from whence 
Nilus
 springeth, the
second is the little 
Lake
 aboue mentioned, and the third
is the second great 
Lake
 which 
Nilus
 engendreth. And
certainely, when you will consider the aboundance of
water that is in this Riuer, you will say, that there was
no nede to haue any fewer or lesser springes to make so
huge a streame as this carrieth. For in the very mouth
of it, which is the onely entraunce into it, the Riuer is
28. myles broad, and when it is in the height of his in∣crease,
he runneth fresh water. 40. or 50. miles into the
sea, and sometimes 80. so that the passengers doe refresh
themselues withal, & by the troublesomnes of the wa∣ter
they know the place where they are. It is nauigable
vpwardes with great barkes about 25. miles, vntill you
come to a certaine straite betweene the rockes, where it
falleth with such a horrible noise, that it may be hearde
almost 8. miles. And this place is called by the Portin∣galles

Cachiuera,
 that is to say a 
Fall,
 or a 
Cataracte,
 like
to the 
Cataractes
 of 
Nilus.
 Betweene the mouth of this
Riuer,
 and the fall thereof, there are diuers great Islands
well inhabited, with townes and Lordes obedient to
the king of 
Congo,
 which sometimes for the great enmi∣tie
that is among them doo warre one against another
in certaine boates,
 hollowed out of a stocke of a tree,
which is of an vnmesurable bignes, & these boats they
call 
Lungo.
 The greatest boates that they haue, are made
of a certaine tree called 
Licondo,
 which is so great, that




sixe men cannot compasse it with their armes, and is in
length of proportion aunswerable to the thicknesse, so
that one of them will carrie about 200. persons. They
rowe these boates with their oares, which are not tyed
to any loopes, but they holde them at libertie in their
handes, and moue the water therewith at pleasure. E∣uery
man hath his oare and his bowe, and when they
fight together, they lay downe their oare and take their
bowe. Neyther do they vse any other Rudders to turne
and gouerne their boates, but onely their oares.


The first of these Islandes,
 which is but a little one,
is called the Isle of 
Horses,
 because there are bredde and
brought vp in it great store of those creatures that the
Greekes call 
Hippopotami,
 that is to say, 
Water-horses.
 In
a certaine village within this Islande doe the Portingals
dwel, hauing withdrawen themselues thether for their
better securitie. They haue their vesselles to transporte
them ouer the water to the firme lande, vpon the south
banke of the Riuer, which lande is called the hauen of

Pinda,
 where many shippes doe ryde that arriue there∣in.


In this Riuer there are liuing diuerse kinds of crea∣tures,

and namely mighty great 
Crocodiles,
 which the
Countrey people there call 
Caiman,
 and 
Water-horses
 a∣boue
named: And another kind of creature, that hath
(as it were) two hands, and a taile like a Target, which
is called 
Ambize Angulo,
 that is to say a 
Hogge-fishe,
 be∣cause
it it as fat as a 
Porke.
 The flesh of it is very good,
and thereof they make Larde, and so keepe it: neyther
hath it the sauour or taste of a fish, although it bee a
fishe. It neuer goeth out from the fresh water, but fee∣deth
vpon the grasse that groweth on the banks, & hath




a mouth like the mozell of an Oxe. There are of these
fishes, that weigh 500. poundes a peece. The fishermen
vse to take them in their little boates, by marking the
places where they feed, and then with their hookes and
forkes, striking and wounding them, they drawe them
dead forth of the water: and when they haue cut them
in peeces, they carry them to the king: For who soeuer
doth not so, encurreth the penaltie of death, and so doe
they likewise that take the 
Trowt,
 and the 
Tenche,
 and
another Fishe called 
Cacongo,
 which is shaped after the
likenes of a 
Salmon,
 sauing that it is not red: but indeed
so far it is, that it quencheth out the fire whiles it is ro∣sted
or broiled. Other fishes also there are that are called

Fishes Royall,
 which are carried to the king, vpon very
seuere and rigorous punishmentes, by open proclama∣tion
to be inflicted on such as shall do the contrary, be∣sides
other kindes of fishes that are taken in this Riuer,
the names whereof we thinke it superfluous here to re∣cite.


Beyonde this Riuer of 
Congo,
 there commeth downe
another Riuer, which the Portingalles call, 
La Baia de∣las
Almadias,
 that is to say, the Golfe of 
Barkes,
 because
there are great store of them, that are made there, by
reason of the aboundance of woods & trees that growe
thereabouts, which are fit for that vse, and wherewith
all the Countries round about do furnish themselues.
At the mouth of this Bay there are three Islandes, one
great Isle in the middle of the Channell, which maketh
a conuenient hauen for small vesselles, and two other
lesse, but none of them inhabited.


A little higher runneth another streame,
 not verye
great, which is called 
De las Barreras Rossas,
 of the redde





Clay-pittes,
 because it floweth from among certaine
Rockes of hils, whose earth is died with a redde colour:
where also there is a very high mountain, called by the

Portingals, La Sierra Gomplida,
 that is to say, 
The long
Mountaine.


And yet going vp a little further, there are two 
Golfes

of the sea in the likenesse of 
a paire of Spectacles,
 where∣in
is a good heauen,
 called 
La Baia d' Aluaro Gonzales,
 that
is the Golfe of 
Aluaro Gonzales.
 Beyonde all these are
certaine hilles and shoars, not worth the remembrance,
vntill you come to the 
Promontorie
 that is called by the
Portingalles 
Capo de Caterina,
 which is the border of the
kingdome of 
Congo
 towardes the 
Equinoctiall,
 and is
distant from the 
Equinostiall
 line two degrees and a
halfe, which is 150▪ 
Italian
 miles.






Chap. 5.
Of the North coast of the Kingdome of Congo,
and the confines thereof.


N
Ow from 
Capo de Caterina
 on the

North
 side beginneth another
border or Coast of the kingdome
of 
Congo,
 which 
Eastwarde
 stretch∣eth
it selfe to the place where the
Riuer 
Vuniba
 ioyneth with the Ri∣uer

Zaire,
 contayning the space of




600. miles and more. Beyonde this coast of 
Congo
 to∣wardes
the North, and vnder the 
Equinoctiall
 lyne vp∣on
the sea shoare, and about 200. miles within lande,
(comprehending in that reckoning the foresaide 
Golfe

of 
Lope Gonzales)
 the people called the 
Bramas
 doo inha∣bite
in a Countrey,
 that is nowe called the kingdome
of 
Loango,
 and the king thereof 
Mani-Loango,
 that is to
say, the King of 
Loango.
 The Countrey hath great a∣boundance
of 
Elephantes,
 whose teeth they exchange
for iron, whereof they make their arrowe heades, their
kniues, and such other instrumentes. In this Countrey
also, they weaue certaine cloath of the leaues of 
Palme

trees, in sundry sorts: as wee shal tell you in some other
place of this narration.


The king of 
Loango
 is in amity with the King of 
Con∣go,

and the report is, that in times past he was his vassaile.
The people are circumcised after the manner of the

Hebrues,
 like as also the rest of the nations in those coun∣tries
vse to be. They do traffick together one with ano∣ther,
& sometimes make war against their neighbors, &
are altogether of the same nature, whereof the people
of 
Congo
 are. Their armour are long targets, which co∣uer
almost all their bodies,
 made of very hard & thicke
hides of a certaine beast called 
Empachas,
 somwhat lesse
then an 
Oxe,
 with hornes like the hornes of a 
Coate:

(this Creature is also bred in 
Germanie,
 and is called a

Dante.)
 The hides thereof are transported out of these
countreyes, and out of the kingdome of 
Congo
 into 
Por∣tingale,

and from thence into 
Flanders,
 where they are
dressed; and then they make ierkens of them as good
as breastplates and corselets, which they call iackets of

Dante.
 Their weapons offensiue are dartes with long




and large heads of iron, like Partizans, or like the aunci∣ent
Roman 
Pilum
 or 
Iauelin:
 the staues whereof are of
proportionable length to cast, hauing in the middest of
them a certaine peece of wood, which they take in their
hands, and so with greater force and violence discharge
their dartes. They carry also certaine daggers, which
are in shape much like to the heads of their dartes.


Beyond the kingdome of 
Loango,
 are the people cal∣led

Anzigues,
 of whom wee shall deliuer vnto you a hi∣story,
which in truth is very strange, and almost incre∣dible
for the beastly and cruell custome, that they vse in
eating mans flesh, yea and that of the neerest kinsefolkes
they haue: This countrey towards the sea on the 
West,

bordereth vpon the people of 
Ambus:
 and towardes
the 
North,
 vpon other nations of 
Africa,
 and the wilder∣nes
of 
Nubia:
 and towardes the 
East,
 vpon the seconde

great Lake,
 from whence the Riuer of 
Congo
 springeth, in
that parte which is called 
Anzicana:
 and from the king∣dome
of 
Congo,
 it is diuided by the Riuer 
Zaire,
 where∣in
there are many Islandes (as before is tolde you) scat∣tered
from the lake downewardes, & some of them be∣longing
to the dominion of the 
Anzigues,
 by which Ri∣uer
also they do trafficke with the people of 
Congo.


In this kingdome of the 
Anzigues
 there are many
Mines of 
Copper,
 and great quantitie of 
Sanders
 both
redde and graie: the red is called 
Tauilla,
 and the graie
(which is the better esteemed) is called 
Chicongo,

whereof they make a poulder of a verie sweet smell, and
diuerse medicines. They do also mingle it with the
oyle of 
Palme
 tree, and so annoynting all their bodyes
ouerwithall, they preserue themselues in health. But
the Portingalles vse it being tempered with Vinegar,




which they lay vpon their pulses,
 & so heale the French
Pockes, which they call in that language 
Chitangas.


Some doe affirme, that this gray 
Sanders
 is the very

Lignum Aquilae,
 that groweth in 
India:
 and 
Signor Odo∣ardo

affirmed, that the Portingals haue proued it for the
heade ake,
 by laying it on the coales, and taking the
smoake of it. The pith and innermost parte of the tree
is the best, but the vtter parte is of no estimation.


They make great store of linnen of the 
Palme
 tree,
both of sundry sortes and coloures, and much cloth of
silke, whereof we will discourse more hereafter. The
people are subiect to a king▪ that hath other princes vn∣der
him: they are very actiue and warlike:
 They are
ready to take armes, and doo fight on foote. Their wea∣pons
are different from the weapons of all other people
rounde about them: for their bowes are small and short,
made of wood, and wrapped about with serpents skins
of diuers colours, and so smoothly wrought, that you
woulde thinke them to be all one with the wood. And
this they doo, both to make the bowe stronger, and also
to holde it the faster. Their stringes are of little wood∣den
twigges, like reedes, not hollow within, but sound
and pliable, and very dainty, such as the 
Caualieros
 of

Portingale
 do carry in their handes to beat their palfries
withall. They are of an ashe colour, and of a Lion taw∣ney,
somwhat tending to blacke. They growe in the
Countrey of the 
Anzigues,
 and also in the kingdome of

Bengala,
 through which the riuer 
Ganges
 runneth. Their
arrowes are short and slender, and of a very hard wood,
and they carry them on their bow hande. They are so
quicke in shooting, that holding xxviij. shaftes or moe
in their bow-hand, they will shoote and discharge them




all, before the first arrow light on the grounde: yea and
sometimes there haue beene seene diuers stout archers,
that haue killed birds as they flie in the ayre.


Other weapons also they make, as 
Axes
 and 
Hat∣chets,

which they vse and frame after a strange manner.
For the handle is shorter by the halfe then the iron is,
and at the lowest end of it there is a pommell▪ for the fa∣ster
holding of it in the hand, and all couered ouer with
the foresaid skinne of a serpent. In the vppermost ende
of it, is the iron very bright and shining, fastned to the
woode with plates of 
Copper,
 in the manner of two
nailes, as long as the handle: it hath two edges, the one
cutteth like a hatchet, and maketh a wounde after the
fashion of a halfe Roundell▪ the other is a hammer.
When they fight with their enemies, or defende them∣selues
from their arrowes, they are so exercised with a
wonderful speed and nimblenesse to manage their wea∣pons,
that whirling them rounde about, as it were in a
circle, they keepe all that compasse of the ayre which is
before them, so that when the enemie shooteth, & the
arrowe beginneth to fall, it lighteth vpon the hatchet,
being so swiftly and vehemently whirled about, that it
breaketh the force of the arrowe, and so it is repulsed:
Then do they hang the 
Hatchet
 vpō their shoulder, & be¦gin
to shoot themselues. They haue also certaine short
daggers, with sheathes of the serpents skins, made like
kniues with a haft vnto them, which they vse to weare
a crosse. Their girdles are of diuers sorts, but the men of
war haue their girdles of 
Elephants
 skin, 3. good fingers
broad: & because they are at the first 2. fingers thicke, &
very harde to handle handsomly, by the heate of the fire
they bow thē round, & so with certain buttons tie them




ouerthwart about them. The men are very actiue and
nimble,
 and leape vp and downe the mountaines lyke

Goates.
 Couragious they are and contemne death: men
of great simplicitie, loyalty and fidelitie, and such as
the Portingalles doo trust more then any other. In so
much as 
Signor Odoardo
 was wont to saye, that if
these 
Anzichi
 woulde become Christians, (being of so
great fidelity, sincerity, loyalty and simplicity, that they
wil offer themselues to death, for the glory of the world,
and to please their Lordes will not sticke to giue their
owne flesh to bee deuoured) then woulde they with a
farre better harte and courage endure martirdome, for
the name of our redeemer 
Iesus Christ,
 and would most
honourably maintaine our faith and religion, with their
good testimony, and example against the 
Gentiles.


Moreouer,
 the said 
Signor Odoardo
 did likewise af∣firme,
that there was no conuersing with them, because
they were a sauage and a beastly people, sauing onely in
respect that they come and trafficke in 
Congo,
 bringing
thether with them slaues both of their owne nation, &
also out of 
Nubia
 (whereupon they do border) & linnē∣cloth
(whereof we will tell you hereafter.) & 
Elephantes

teeth: in exchange of which chaffare they recarry home
with thē 
Salt
 & these 
Lumache,
 which they vse in steed
of their money & coine; and another greater kinde of

Lamache,
 which come from the Isle of 
S. Thomas,
 and
which they vse to weare for brooches to make them∣selues
fine & gallant withal. Other marchaundises also
they carry backe with them which are brought out of

Portingall,
 as silks, and linnen, and glasses, & such like.


They vse to circumcise themselues: and another
foolish custome they haue, both men and women, as




well of the nobilitie,
 as of the commonalty, euen from
their childhood to mark their faces with sundry slashes
made with a knife, as in due place shal be further shew∣ed
vnto you.


They keepe a shambles of mans flesh as they do in
these countryes for beefe and other victuailes.
 For their
enemies whom they take in the warres, they eate, and
also their slaues, if they can haue a good market for
them, they sell: or if they cannot, then they deliuer
them to the butchers to be cut in peeces, and so solde,
to be rosted or boyled. And (that which is a maruellous
history to report) some of them being weary of their
liues, and some of them euen for valour of courage, and
to shew themselues stout and venturous, thinking it to
be a great honour vnto them, if they runne into volun∣tary
death, thereby to shewe that they haue a speciall
contempt of this life, will offer themselues to the but∣chery,
as faithfull subiectes to their Princes, for whose
sakes, that they may seeme desirous to doe them nota∣ble
seruice, they do not onely deliuer themselues to be
deuoured by them, but also their slaues, when they are
fat and well fed, they doe kill and eate them. True it is
that many nations there are, that feede vpon mans flesh
as in the east 
Indies,
 and in 
Bresill,
 and in other places:
but that is onely the flesh of their aduersaries and ene∣mies,

but to eat the flesh of their owne frendes and sub∣iectes
and kinsefolkes, it is without all example in any
place of the worlde, sauing onely in this nation of the

Anzichi.


The ordinary apparel of these people is thus:
 The cō∣mon
sort go naked from the girdle vpwards, & without
any thing vpon their heades, hauing their hayre trussed




vp and curled. The noble men are apparelled in silkes
and other cloath, and weare vpon their heades blewe
and red, and blacke colours, and hattes and hoodes of
Portingale 
Veluet,
 and other kindes of cappes vsuall in
that countrey. And indeede they are all desirous to
haue their apparell handsome and neat as their hability
will suffer them. The women are all couered from top
to toe, after the common manner of 
Africa.
 The poorer
sort of them doe girde themselues close from the girdle
downewards. The noble women and such as are of
wealth, do weare certaine mantelles, which they cast
ouer their heades, but keepe their faces open and at li∣bertie:
& shooes they haue on their feet, but the poore
go barefoote. They go very quicke and lightsome:
Their stature is comely, and their conditions fayre and
commendable.


Their language is altogether different from the lan∣guage
of 
Congo,
 and yet the 
Anzichi
 will learne the lan∣guage
of 
Congo,
 very soone and easily, because it is the
plainer tonge: but the people of 
Congo
 do very hardely
learne the language of the 
Anzichi.
 And when I once
demaunded what their religion was, it was tolde mee
they were Gentils, and that was all that I could learne
of them.








Chap. 6.
Of the East coast of the Kingdome of Congo, and the
confines thereof.


T
He East Coast of the kingdome
of 
Congo,
 beginneth (as we haue
tolde you) at the meeting of the
Riuer 
Vumba,
 and the Riuer of

Zaire;
 and so with a line drawen
towardes the South in equall di∣stance
from the Riuer 
Nilus,

which lyeth on the left hande, it
taketh vp a great mountaine which is very high, & not
inhabited in the toppes thereof, called the mountaine
of 
Christal,
 because there is in it great quantity of 
Christal

both of the mountaine and of the cliffe, and of all sorts.
And then passing on further includeth the hilles that are
called 
Sierras de Sol,
 that is to say, the hilles of the 
Sunne,

because they are exceeding high. And yet it neuer sno∣weth
vpon them, neyther doe they beare any thing,
but are very bare and without any trees at all: On the
leaft hand there arise other hils, called the hilles of 
Sal-Nitrum,

because there is in thē great store of that 
Mine∣ral.

And so cutting ouer the riuer 
Berbela,
 that commeth




out of the first Lake, there endeth the ancient bound of
the kingdome of 
Congo
 on the East.


Thus then the east coast of this kingdome is deriued
from the meeting of the two foresaid riuers 
Vumba
 and

Zaire,
 vntill you come to the lake 
Achelunda,
 and to the
Countrey of 
Malemba;
 contayning the space of sixe
hundred miles. From this lyne, which is drawen in the
easterne coast of 
Congo
 to the riuer 
Nilus,
 and to the two
Lakes (whereof mention shalbe made in conuenient
place) there is the space of 150. miles of ground wel in∣habited,
and good store of hils, which do yeeld sundry
mettalles, with much linnen, and cloth of the 
Palme

tree.


And seeing wee are now come to this point of this
discourse,
 it will be very necessary to declare vnto you
the maruellous arte which the people of this countrey,
and other places thereabouts do vse in making cloathes
of sundry sortes, as 
Veluets
 shorne and vnshorne, cloth
of 
Tinue, Sattens, Taffata, Damaskes, Sarcenettes
 and
such like, not of any silken stuffe, (for they haue no
knowledge of the Silkewormes at all, although some of
their apparell bee made of silke that is brought thether
from our Countreys.) But they weaue their cloathes a∣forenamed
of the leaues of 
Palme
 trees, which trees they
alwayes keepe vnder and lowe to the grounde, euery
yeare cutting them, and watering them, to the ende
they may grow smal and tender against the new spring.
Out of these leaues being cleansed & purged after their
manner they drawe forth their threedes, which are all
very fine and dainty, and all of one euennesse, sauing
that those which are longest, are best esteemed. For of
those they weaue their greatest peeces. These stuffes




they worke of diuers fashions, as some with a nappe vp∣on
them like 
Veluet
 on both sides, and other cloath cal∣led

Damaskes,
 braunched with leaues, and such other
thinges; & the 
Broccati,
 which are called 
High
 and 
Lowe,

and are farre more precious then ours are. This kinde
of cloath no man may weare but the king, and such as it
pleaseth him. The greatest peeces are of these 
Broccati:

for they contayne in length fower and fiue spannes,
and in breadth, three and foure spannes, and are called

Incorimbas,
 by the name of the countrey where it grow∣eth,
which is about the Riuer 
Vumba.
 The 
Veluettes
 are
called 
Enzachas
 of the same bignesse, and the 
Damaskes
Insulas,
 and the 
Rasi Maricas,
 and the 
Zendadi Tangas,
 &
the 
Ormesini Engombos.
 Of the lighter sort of these stuffes
they haue greater peeces which are wrought by the 
An∣zichi,

and are sixe spannes long, and fiue spannes
broade, wherewith euery man may apparell himselfe
according to his habilitie. Besides that, they are very
thicke and sounde to keepe out the water, and yet very
light to weare. The Portingalles haue lately begun to
vse them for tents and boothes, which do maruellously
resist both water and winde.


This coast then shutteth vp the kingdome of 
Congo,

which lyeth 
Westwarde
 of it:
 and from this Coast with
a line of equall distance somwhat more towardes the

East
 runneth the riuer 
Nilus,
 about 150. miles, contay∣ning
within it a Countrey that aboundeth with all the
commodities aboue rehearsed, possessed by sundrye
Lordes, some subiect to 
Prete Gianni,
 and some to the
mighty King 
Moënemugi.
 In all which Countrey
there was nothing worth the noting, sauing that from

Nilus
 towards the 
West,
 the people do trafficke with the
















kingdome of 
Congo,
 and the riuers of that sea: and from
thence towardes the East they goe through the king∣domes
of 
Moenemugi,
 euen to the sea of 
Mombaza
 and

Mozambiche.






Chap. 7.
Of the confines of the kingdome of Congo to∣wardes
the South.


T
His Easterne Coast (as it is be∣fore
set downe) endeth in the
mountain called 
Serras de Plata,

that is the mountaines of siluer,

and there beginneth the fourth
and last border of the kingdome
of 
Congo,
 towardes the South,
that is to say, from the foresaide
mountaine to the Bay of 
Cowes
 on the West, contay∣ning
in length the space of foure hundred & fifty miles.
And this Southerne line doth parte the kingdome of

Angola
 in the middle, and leaueth on the left hand of it,
the foresaide mountaines of 
Siluer,
 and further beyond
them towardes the South the Kingdome of 
Matama,

which is a great kingdome, very mighty, and absolute
of it selfe, and sometimes in amity, and sometimes at
vtter enmitie with the kingdome of 
Angola.


The king of 
Matama
 is in religion a Gentile,
 and his




kingdome stretcheth towardes the 
South
 to the riuer

Brauagal,
 and neere to the mountains commonly called
the 
Mountaynes of the Moone,
 and towardes the east
bordereth on the 
Westerne
 bankes of the riuer 
Bagami∣dri,

and so crosseth ouer the riuer 
Coari.


This countrey aboundeth in vaultes of 
Christall
 and
other mettalles, and all manner of victuaile, and good
ayre. And although the people thereof, & their neigh∣bour
borderers do trafficke together: Yet the King of

Matama,
 and the king of 
Angola
 doo oftentimes warre
one against the other, as we told you before: And this
riuer 
Bagamidri
 diuideth the kingdome of 
Matapa
 from
the kingdome of 
Monomata,
 which is towards the 
East,

and whereof 
Iohn de Barros
 doth most largely discourse
in the first Chapter of his tenth booke.


Towardes the sea coast there are diuers Lordes, that
take vpon them the title of kinges: but indeed they are
of very base and slender estate: Neyther are there any
portes or hauens of any account or name in the riuers
there. And nowe forasmuch as wee haue oftentimes
made mention of the kingdome of 
Angola,
 this will be
a very conuenient place for vs to intreate thereof: be∣cause
it hath beene heretofore saide, that the king of

Angola,
 being in times past but a Gouernour or Deputy
vnder the king of 
Congo,
 although since that tyme he is
become a good Christian, yet hath he made himselfe a
free and an absolute Prince, and vsurped all that quar∣ter
to his owne iurisdiction, which before hee had in re∣giment
and gouernement vnder another. And so after∣wards
in time conquered other countries thereabouts,
insomuch as he is now growen to bee a great Prince, &
a rich, and in power little inferiour to the king of 
Congo





himselfe, and therefore eyther payeth tribute, or refu∣seth
to pay tribute vnto him, euen at his owne good
pleasure.


It came to passe,
 that 
Don Giouanni
 the second, being
king of 
Portingall,
 planted the christian religion in the
Kingdome of 
Congo,
 and thereupon the king of 
Congo

became a Christian. After which time the Lorde of

Angola
 was alwaies in amitie, and (as it were) a vassall
of the forenamed King of 
Congo,
 and the people of both
countries did trafficke together one with another, and
the Lord of 
Angola
 did euery yeare sende some presents
to the king of 
Congo.
 And by licence from the King of

Congo
 there was a great trade betweene the Portingalles
and the people of 
Angola
 at the hauen of 
Loanda,

where they bought slaues and chaunged them for o∣ther
marchaundises, and so transported all into the
Isle of Sainte 
Thomas.
 Whereby it came to passe,
that the trafficke was heere vnited with the trafficke
of 
S. Thomas:
 so that the shippes did vse first to arriue
at that Islande, and then afterwarde passed ouer to 
Loan∣da.

And when this trade began in processe of time to
increase, they dispatched their shippes from 
Lisbone
 to

Angola
 of themselues, and sent with them a Gouernour
called 
Paulo Diaz
 of 
Nouais,
 to whome this busines did
(as it were) of right appertaine, in regarde of the good
desertes of his auncesters, who first discouered this traf∣ficke.
To this 
Paulo Diaz
 did 
Don Sebastiano
 King of

Portingale
 graunt leaue and authority to conquere,
 for
the space of xxxiij. leagues vpwardes along the coast,
beginning at the Riuer 
Coanza
 towards the 
South,
 and
within the lande also, whatsoeuer hee coulde get, to∣wardes
all his charges for him and his heyres. With




him there went many other shippes that opened and
found out a great trade with 
Angola,
 which notwith∣standing
was directed to the foresaide hauen of 
Loanda

where the saide shippes did still discharge themselues.
And so by little & little he entred into the firme land,
 &
made himselfe a house in a certain village called 
Anzelle

within a mile neer to the riuer 
Coanza,
 because it was the
more commodious & nigher to the trafficke of 
Angola.


When the trade here beganne thus to increase, and
marchaundises were freely caried by the Portingales, &
the people of 
Congo
 to 
Cabazo
 a place belonging to the
Lorde of 
Angola,
 and distant from the sea, 150. miles,
there to sell and barter them, it pleased his Lordship to
giue out order, that all the Marchants should be slaine,
and their goods confiscated, alleadging for his defence,
that they were come thether as spies, and to take pos∣session
of his estate: but in truth it is thought that hee
did it onely to gaine all that wealth to himselfe, consi∣dering
that it was a people that did not deale in the ha∣bite
of warriours, but after the manner of Marchants.
And this fell out in the same yeare, that the King 
Don
Sebastiano
 was discomfited in 
Barbarie.


When 
Paulo Diaz
 vnderstoode of this course, he put
himselfe in armes against the King of 
Angola,
 and with
such a troupe of Portingals as he could gather together
that were to bee founde in that countrey, and with two
Gallies and other vessels, which he kept in the riuer 
Co∣anza,

he went forwarde on both sides of the riuer con∣quering,
and by force subdued many Lords, and made
them his frendes and subiectes. But the king of 
Angola

perceyuing that his vassalles had yeelded to the obedi∣ence
of 
Paulo Diaz,
 and that with all prosperous suc∣cesse




he had gayned much land vpon him, he assembled
a great army to go against him, and so vtterly to destroy
him.
 Whereupon 
Paulo Diaz
 requested the King of

Congo
 that he woulde succour him with some helpe to
defende himselfe withall, who presently sent vnto him
for aid an army of 60 thousand men, vnder the conduct
of his cosin 
Don Sebastiano Manibamba,
 and another cap∣tayne
with 120. Portingale souldiers, that were in those
countryes, and all of his owne pay for the atchieuing of
this enterprise. This army was to ioyne with 
Paulo Di∣az,

and so altogether to warre against the King of 
Ango∣la:

but arriuing at the shoare, where they were to passe
ouer the riuer 
Bengo,
 within 12. miles of 
Loāda,
 & where
they shoulde haue met with many barkes to carry the

Campe
 to the other shore, partly because the said barks
had slacked their cōming, & partly because much time
wold haue been spent in transporting so many men, the
whole armie tooke their way quite ouer the riuer, and
so going on forwardes they met with the people of the
King of 
Angola,
 that were ready to stoppe the souldiers
of 
Congo,
 from entering vpon their Countrey.


The military order of the 
Mociconghi
 (for by that
terme we do call the naturall borne people of the king∣dome
of 
Congo,
 as wee call the 
Spaniardes
 those that
are naturally borne in 
Spaine)
 and the military order of
the people of 
Angola,
 is almost all one: For both of them
doo vsually fight on foote, and diuide their armie into
seuerall troupes, fitting themselues according to the si∣tuation
of the field where they doo incampe, & aduan∣cing
their ensignes and banners in such sort as before is
remembrd.


The remoues of their armie are guided and directed




by certaine seuerall soundes and noyses, that pro∣ceede
from the 
Captayne Generall,
 who goeth into the
middest of the 
Armie,
 and there signifieth what is to bee
put in execution: that is to say, eyther that they shall
ioyne battell, or els retyre, or put on forward, or turne
to the right hand, and to the leaft hand, or to performe
any other warlick action. For by these seueral sounds di∣stinctly
deliuered frō one to another they doe all vnder∣stande
the commandementes of their 
Captayne,
 as we
heere among vs doo vnderstande the pleasure of our

Generall
 by the sundrie stroakes of the 
Drumme,
 and the

Captaines
 soundes of the 
Trompet.


Three principall soundes they haue which they vse
in warre: One which is vttered aloude, by great 
Rattles


 fastned in certaine woodden cases, hollowed out of a
tree, and couered with leather, which they strike with

 certaine little handles of 
Iuory.
 Another is made by a
certaine kinde of instrument, fashioned like a 
Pyramis

turned vpwarde: for the lower ende of it is sharpe and
endeth as it were in a point, and the vpper end waxeth
broader & broader like the bottom of a 
Triangle,
 in such
sort that beneath they are narrow & like an 
Angle,
 & a∣boue
they are large and wide. This instrument is made
of certayne thinne plates of iron, which are hollowe
and empty within, and very like to a bell turned vp side
downe. They make them ring, by striking them with
woodden wandes: and oftentimes they do also cracke
them, to the ende that the sound should be more harsh,
horrible, and warlicke: The thirde instrument is

 framed of 
Elephants
 teeth, some great, and some small,
hollowe within, and blowen at a certaine hole which
they make on the side of it, in manner of the 
Fife,
 and




not aloft like the 
Pipe.
 These are tempered by them in
such sort that they yeelde as warlicke and harmonious
musicke as the 
Cornet
 doth, and so pleasant and iocund
a noyse, that it moueth and stirreth vp their courages, &
maketh them not to care for any daunger whatsoeuer.
Now of these three seueral sorts of warlick instruments,
there are some bigger and some lesse.
 For the 
Captayne
Generall
 carrieth alwaies with him the greater sort, to
the ende that by them he may giue signification to the
whole 
Campe
 what they shall doo. The particular
bandes and troupes of the armie haue in like manner
their smaller sort, and euery 
Captayne
 in his seuerall re∣giment
hath also one of the smallest, which they strike
with their handes. Whereupon it falleth out, that when
they heare the sounde of the generall 
Rattle,
 or 
Cornet,

or the other thirde kinde of instrument, euery part of
the army doth presently answere in the same note, signi∣fying
thereby that they haue wel vnderstood the good
pleasure of the 
Captaine,
 and so consequently the 
vnder
Captaines
 do the like. Neyther do they onely vse these
instruments and sounds vniuersally, but also when they
are in fight in skirmish, the valiant and couragious
souldiers go before the rest, & with this kinde of belles,
which they strike with their woodden wandes, they
dance, & encourage their fellows, & by the note do sig∣nifie
vnto them in what danger they are, and what wea∣pons
they haue met withall.


The militarie apparell of the better sort,
 and of the
Lords of the 
Moci-Conghi
 is this. On their heades they
carry a cappe, which is garnished with sundry plumes
of the feathers of the 
Eastruche,
 of the 
Peaeocke,
 of the

Cocke,
 and of other kindes of birdes, which make them




to seeme men of greater stature then they are, and terri∣ble
to looke vpon. From the girdle vpwards they are all
naked, and haue hanging about them from their necks,
both on the right side and on the leaft, euen as lowe as
to both their flanks, certaine chaines of iron, with rings
vpon them as bigge as a mans little finger, which they
vse for a certaine military pompe & brauery. From the
girdle downewardes they haue breeches of linnen, or
sendale, which are couered with cloath, and reach
downe to their heeles, but then they are folded againe
vpwardes and tucked vnder their girdle. Vpon their
girdle, which (as we tolde you) is made with exquisite
and curious worke, they do fasten certaine belles, very
like to the instruments that are before named, which in
moouing of themselues and in fighting with their ene∣mies,
do ring & make a noise, & ad courage vnto them,
while they are in combate with their aduersaries. Vp∣on
their legges they haue likewise their buskins after
the Portingall fashion.
 Their armour we haue already
declared, that is to say, bowe and arrowes, sworde, dag∣ger
and Target: but yet with this caueat, that whosoe∣uer
weareth a bowe, he weareth also a dagger, but no
target: for those two weapons may not be worne toge∣ther,
but sword & target they may lawfully weare both
at once.


The common souldiers go all naked from the girdle∣stead
vpwardes,
 and haue the rest of their bodies armed
with bowe and arrowes and daggers. These are they
that do first offer the skirmish, going out before the rest
of the armie, as it were seuerally and dispersedly pro∣uoking
to fight, and receyuing the shot from a farre
of, they turne and winde this way and that way, and




doo nimbly leape from one side to another, to the ende
they may auoide the lighting of their enemies arrowes.
Besides these there are also certaine quicke and gallant
young men that runne out before the rest, which with
the ringing of their bels (as afore is sayde) are as it were
comforters of their fellows, and when they haue fought
so much, that the Captaine thinketh them to bee euen
weary, then doth he call them backe with the sounde of
one of those instruments aboue mentioned: so that per∣ceyuing
the medley to waxe hote, they turne about and
retyre themselues back againe, & others succeed in their
places, which course is still obserued and kept vntill such
time, as both the armies do indeed ioyne all their maine
forces together, and so fight it out.


In the place aboue described,
 there were sundry en∣counters
on the one side and on the other. And in the
first battels the people of 
Congo
 remayned conquerours:
but afterwards, when they had diuers times fought to∣gether
with great losse on both sides, and victuailes be∣gan
nowe to faile, and consequently men waxed sicke
and died, the Campe of the king of 
Congo
 was dissolued,
and euery man returned to his owne home.


In this meane while 
Paulo Diaz,
 though he coulde
not ioyne his forces with the Armie of his frendes that
came to succour him, yet set himselfe forwardes, and
passing ouer the riuer stayed at 
Luiola,
 because it was a
place very strong & fit to resist the King of 
Angola.
 The
situation of 
Luiola
 is this: The two riuers 
Coanza
 and

Luiola
 do ioyne together about 105. miles from the sea
shore, and a little aboue the said ioyning together, these
Riuers doe seauer themselues for the space of an Arcu∣buse
shotte, so that they make as it were an Islande be∣tweene




them: In which Islande at the meeting of the
two riuers there riseth a hill, which 
Paulo Diaz
 surprised
and fortified for his better safety. And whereas in times
past there was neuer any habitation there, nowe at this
present it is growen to be a prety conntrey inhabited by
the 
Portingalles.


From this place thus surprised by 
Paulo Diaz,
 and
called 
Luiola,
 you may saile along the riuer with certain
small vesselles, euen to the sea, and goe by lande with∣out
any daunger for the space of one hundred and fiue
miles.
 Neere therevnto are the hilles that are called the
hilles of 
Cabambe,
 producing infinite store of siluer:
which the saide 
Diaz
 doth euery day by little and little
endeauour to conquere. And these hils are the graund
quarrell betweene him and the people of 
Angola.
 For
knowing that the 
Portingalles
 doe esteeme greatly of
these hilles, in regarde of the siluer pits which are there
in great aboundance, they doe vse all the force and skill
they can to keepe the 
Portingalles
 from them. They
fight also with them in diuers other places: for the Por∣tingalles
passing ouer the riuer 
Coanza
 doe continually
make inroades into the countries that are subiect to the
king of 
Angola.


The weapons of these peoples, are bowes sixe hand∣fulles
long,
 with stringes made of the barkes of trees: &
arrowes of woode, lesse then a mans little finger, and
sixe handefuls long. They haue iron heads made like a
hooke, and feathers of birdes in the toppes of them: and
of these arrowes they vse to carry to the number of sixe
or seauen vpon their bow hand, without any quiuer at
all. Their daggers are fashioned with a haft after the
manner of a knife, which they weare at their girdle, on




their left side, and hold them aloft in their hands, when
they fight with them.
 By their 
Militarie
 actions and pro∣ceedinges
you may obserue their great skill and good
order in matter of warre. For in diuers battels that were
betweene them and the 
Portingalles,
 it was plainly seene
how they coulde choose their aduantages against their
enemies, as by assaulting them in the night time, and
in rayny weather, to the ende that their arcubuses and
guns shold not take fire, & also by diuiding their forces
into many troups, to trouble them the more. The king
doth not vse to go to the warre in his owne person, but
sendeth his 
Captains
 in his steed. The people are also ac∣customed
to flie & run away incontinently, as soone as
they see their Captaine slaine, neyther can they be per∣swaded
to stay by any reason or argument, but present∣ly
yeelde vp the fielde. They are all footemen, neyther
haue they any horses at all. And therefore the Cap∣taines
if they will not go on foote, cause themselues to
be carried on the shoulders of their slaues, after one of
the three manners, which wee will shew vnto you here∣after.
This nation goeth out to warre in number almost
infinite, and very confusedly: they leaue no man at
home that is fit to carry a weapon: they make no prepa∣ration
of victuailes necessary for the Campe: but such
as perhaps haue any, conuey it with them vpon the shol∣ders
of their seruantes, and yet they haue sundry sortes
of creatures that might bee managed, and serue their
turnes to drawe and to carry as in the seconde part of
this Treatise shalbe described vnto you. And thereup∣on
it falleth out, that when they come into any country
with their whole armie, all their foode is quickly quite
consumed, & then hauing nothing leaft to feede vpon,




they dissolue their hoast euen in the greatest necessity
of prosecuting their enterprise, and so are inforced by
hunger to returne into their owne countries.


They are greatly giuen to 
Diuination
 by birdes: If
a bird chaunce to flie on their leaft hand,
 or crie in such
manner, as those which make profession to vnderstand
the same, doe say that it fore-sheweth ill lucke and ad∣uersity,
or that they may go no further forwardes, they
will presently turne backe and repayre home: which
custome was also in the old time obserued by the anci∣ent

Romanes,
 and likewise at this day by sundry other

Pagans.


Now if it shall seeme straunge to any man,
 that so
few 
Portingall
 souldiours as 
Paulo Diaz
 retayneth there
with him, and others of the 
Portingall
 nation, which
traffick into the Realme, & relieue him with succours,
being in number but three hundred at the most, ac∣counting
their slaues, and also the 
Malcontentes,
 the
rebelles and fugitiues of 
Angola
 which dayly resort vn∣to
him, & amount not in al to the quantity of xv, thou∣sand
men, should be able to make so gallant a resistance
against that innumerable rabble of 
Negroes,
 being sub∣iect
to the king of 
Angola,
 which are gathered there to∣gether
(as it is said) to the number of a Million of soules.
I aunswere, that great reason may bee alleadged for the
same. For the armie of the 
Negroes
 is all naked, and vt∣terly
destitute of all prouision and furniture for armour
of defence: And as for their weapons of offence, they
consist onely but of bowes and daggers (as I told you.)
But our fewe 
Portingalles
 that are there, are well lap∣ped
in certaine iackets that are stuffed and basted with
bombast, and stitched and quilted very soundly, which




keepe their armes very safe, and their bodies downe∣wardes
as lowe as their knees: Their heades also are ar∣med
with cappes made of the same stuffe, which doo
resist the shot of the arrow and the stroke of the dagger:
Besides that, they are girt with longe swords, and some
horsemen there are among them that carry speares for
their weapons. Now you must vnderstande that one
man on horsebacke, is of more worth then a hundred

Negroes,
 because the horsemen do affray them greatly:
& especially of those that do discharge guns and pee∣ces
of artillarie against them, they doo stande continu∣ally
in an extreame bodily feare. So that these few be∣ing
well armed, and cunningly and artificially ordered,
must needes ouercome the other, though they be very
many in number.


This kingdome of 
Angola,
 is full of people beyonde
all credite: For euery man taketh as many wiues as hee
listeth, and so they multiply infinitely: But they doe
not vse so to do in the kingdome of 
Congo,
 which liueth
after the manner of the 
Christians.
 And so 
Signor Odo∣ardo

did affirme and belieue, that the kingdome of 
An∣gola

had a Million of fighting men, by reason that euery
man taking to him as many wiues as he woulde, begot
many children, and likewise because euery man doeth
willingly go to the warres in the seruice of his Prince.


This kingdome also is very rich in mines of 
Siluer,
 &
most excellent 
Copper,
 and for other kindes of mettall
there is more in this kingdome then in any other coun∣trey
of the world whatsoeuer. Fruitfull it is in all man∣ner
of foode, and sundry sortes of cattell, and specially
for great heards of 
Kine.
 True it is, that this people do
loue 
Dogs
 flesh better then any other meate: & for that




that purpose they feede and fatten them, and then kill
them, and sell them in their open shambles. It is con∣stantly
affirmed,
 that a great dogge accustomed to the

Bull
 was solde by exchaunge for xxij. slaues, which af∣ter
the rate of x. 
Duckates
 a poll, were worth in all 220.

Duccates:
 in so high a price and account do they holde
that Creature.


The moneyes that are vsed in 
Angola,
 are much dif∣ferent
from the 
Lumache
 of 
Congo:
 for they of 
Angola

do vse beades of glasse, such as are made in 
Venice
 as big
as a Nut, and some of lesser quantity, and of diuers and
sundry colours and fashions. These doe the people of

Angola
 make, not onely to vse them for money, but also
for an ornament of their men and women, to weare a∣bout
their neckes and their armes, and are called in
their tongue 
Anzolos:
 but when they are threeded
vpon a stringe lyke a payre of Beades, they call them

Mizanga.


The King of 
Angola
 is by religion a Gentile,
 and
worshippeth 
Idoles,
 and so doo all the people in his
kingdome. It is true, that hee hath greatly desired to
become a Christian, after the example of the King of

Congo.
 But because there hath not beene as yet any pos∣sibility
to sende 
Priestes
 vnto him, that might illuminate
and instruct him, he remayneth still in darkenes. The
foresaide 
Signor Odoardo
 tolde mee that in his time the
king of 
Angola
 sent an Ambassadour to the King of 
Con∣go,

requesting that he would sende him some religious
persons to inform him in the Christian religiō: but the
King of 
Congo
 had none there that hee coulde spare, &
therefore coulde sende him none. At this day, both
these kinges doo trafficke together, and are in amity




one with another, the king of 
Angola
 hauing now clee∣red
and discharged himselfe for the iniuries & slaugh∣ters
that were committed vpon those of 
Congo,
 and vp∣on
the Portingalles at 
Cabazo.


The language of the people of 
Angola
 is all one with
the language of the people of 
Congo,
 because (as wee
told you before) they are both but one kingdome. One∣ly
the difference betweene them is, as commonly it is
betweene two nations that border one vpon another,
as for example betweene the 
Portingalles
 and the 
Casti∣lians,

or rather betweene the 
Venetians
 and the 
Calabri∣ans,

who pronouncing their wordes in a diuers man∣ner,
and vttering them in seuerall sortes, although it be
all one speech, yet do they very hardly vnderstand one
another.


Wee haue signified vnto you heretofore, that the
Bay of 
Cowes
 doth diuide the kingdome of 
Angola
 in
the middest, and hitherto wee haue treated but of the
one halfe thereof:
 Now we will describe vnto you the
seconde parte of it, which lyeth from the said Bay of

Cowes
 towardes the 
South.
 From this Bay then, to the
black Cape called 
Capo Negro,
 by the coast of the 
Ocean

they doe reckon two hundred & twenty miles of such
country and soile as the former is, and possessed by ma∣ny
Lordes that are subiect to the king of 
Angola.
 From

Capo Negro
 there runneth a line towardes the 
East,

through the middest of the Mountaynes, that are called

Monti Freddi,
 that is to say, the 
Cold Mountaines:
 which
also in some certaine parts of them, that are higher then
the rest, towardes the 
Equinoctiall
 are tearmed by the
Portingalles 
Monti Neuosi,
 or 
Snowie Mountaines,
 and
so endeth at the rootes of other Mountaynes that are




called the 
Mountaines
 of 
Chrystall.
 (Out of these 
Snowie
Mountains
 do spring the waters of the 
Lake Dumbea Zoc∣che.)

This foresaid line from the mountaine of 
Christall

draweth onwardes towardes the 
North
 through the
Mountaines of 
Siluer,
 till you come to 
Malemba,
 where
wee tolde you the kingdome of 
Congo
 was diuided, and
parted the Riuer of 
Coari
 in the middest. And this is
the Countrey possessed by the King of 
Angola,
 where∣of
I haue no more to say, then is already set downe, nei∣ther
of the qualities of his person, nor of his Court.






Chap. 8.
Of the circuite of the Kingdome of Congo possessed by the
King that nowe is, according to the foure borders aboue
described.


B
Eginning therefore at the Riuer 
Co∣anza,

and drawing towardes the

Equinoctiall
 375. miles, you shal find
the Riuer that they call 
Las Barreras
Vermellias,
 or the 
Redde Pittes,
 which
are indeed the ragged ruines of cer∣taine
rockes worne by the sea, and
when they fall downe doo shew themselues to be of a
redde colour.
 From thence by a direct line vpon the

North,
 that which the King possesseth is 450. miles.




And thē the said line diuiding it self towards the South
passeth by the hilles of 
Christall
 (not those that we told
you before did belong to 
Angola,
 but others that
are called by the same name) and so by the moun∣tains
of 
Salnitro,
 trauersing the Riuer 
Verbela
 at the roots
of the Mountaines of 
Siluer
 it endeth at the Lake 
A∣quelunda,

which is the space of 500. miles. The fourth
line runneth along the Riuer 
Coanza,
 which issueth out
of the said Lake & contayneth 360. miles. So that the
whole Realme now possessed by 
Don Aluaro
 the king of

Congo
 is in compasse 1685. miles.
 But the breadth there∣of
beginneth at the mouth of the Riuer 
Zaire,
 where
the point is, which in the Portingal speech is called 
Pa∣draon,

and so cutting the kingdome of 
Congo
 in the mid∣dle,
and crossing ouer the mountaines of the 
Sunne,
 and
the mountaines of 
Christall,
 there it endeth, containing
the space of 6
0. miles, & within 150. miles, neere to the
Riuer 
Nilus.
 Very true it is indeed, that in ancient time
the predecessors of this Prince did raigne ouer many
other countreyes thereaboutes, which in processe of
time they haue lost: and although they bee now in
the gouernement of others,
 yet doo the Kings of 
Con∣go

retaine still to this day the titles of those regions, as
for example, 
Don Aluaro,
 king of 
Congo,
 and of 
Abundos,

and of 
Matama,
 and of 
Quizama,
 and of 
Angola,
 and of

Cacongo,
 and of the seauen kingdomes of 
Congere Amo∣laza,

and of the 
Pangelungos,
 and Lorde of the Riuer

Zaire,
 and of the 
Anziquos,
 and 
Anziquana,
 and of 
Lo∣ango.








Chap. 9.
The sixe Prouinces of the kingdome of Congo, and
first of the Prouince of Bamba.


T
His kingdome is diuided into sixe
Prouinces, that is to say, 
Bamba,
Songo, Sundi, Pango, Batta
 & 
Pemba.

The Prouince of 
Bamba,
 (which
is the greatest and the richest) is
gouerned by 
Don Sebastian Mani
Bamba,
 cosin to the King 
Don Al∣uaro

last deceased, and it is situated vpon the sea coast,
from the riuer 
Ambrize,
 vntill you come to the riuer

Coanza
 towardes the 
South.
 This 
Don Sebastian
 hath
vnder his dominion many Princes and Lordes, and the
names of the greatest of them are these, 
Don Antonio
Mani-Bamba,
 who is Lieuetenant and brother to 
Don
Sebastian,
 and 
Mani-Lemba
 another, and 
Mani-Dandi,
 &

Mani-Bengo,
 and 
Mani-Loanda,
 who is gouernour of the
Island of 
Loanda,
 and 
Mani-Corimba,
 and 
Mani-Coanza,

and 
Mani-Cazzanzi.
 All these doo gouerne all the sea
coast but within lande, for that parte which belongeth
to 
Angola,
 there are another people called the 
Ambun∣dos,

who dwelling on the borders of 
Angola
 are subiect




to the saide 
Mani-Bamba,
 and they are these, 
Angazi,
Chinghengo, Motollo, Chabonda,
 and many others of ba∣ser
condition.


Note, that this worde 
Mani
 signifieth a Prince or a
Lord,
 and the rest of the word is the name of the coun∣trey
and Lordeshippe, where the Lorde ruleth. As for
example, 
Mani-Bamba
 signifieth the Lord of the coun∣trey
of 
Bamba,
 & 
Mani-Corimba
 the Lorde of the coun∣trey
of 
Corimba,
 which is a parte of 
Bamba,
 and so like∣wise
of the rest. This Prouince of 
Bamba
 confineth with

Angola,
 on the 
South,
 & vpon the 
East
 of it towardes the
Lake 
Achelunda
 lyeth the country of 
Quizama,
 which is
gouerned like a comon wealth, and is diuided among a
number of Lordes, who in deed liuing at their owne
libertie, doo neyther obey the King of 
Congo,
 nor the
King of 
Angola.
 And to bee short, these Lords of 
Qui∣zama,

after they had a long time quarrelled with 
Paulo
Diaz,
 yet at last they became his subiects, because they
woulde auoide the yoake of the King of 
Angola,
 and
by their good aid and assistance doth 
Paulo Diaz
 great∣ly
helpe himselfe against the said King of 
Angola.


Nowe the aforesaid Countrey of 
Bamba,
 (as wee
haue tolde you) is the principall Prouince of all the
Realme of 
Congo,
 and in deed the very keye, and the
buckler and the sworde, and the defence thereof, and
(as it were) the frontier which opposeth it selfe against
all their enemies. For it resisteth all the reuoltes and re∣bellions
of those quarters, and hath very valorous peo∣ple
in it, that are alwaies ready for to fight, so that they
do continually keep their aduersaries of 
Angola
 in great
awe: and if it happen at any time that their king stande
in neede, they are alwaies at his commaunde to annoy




the other countries whensoeuer. When neede requi∣reth,

hee may haue in 
Campe
 foure hundred thousande
men of warre, and yet that number is but onely the sixt
parte of the whole kingdome, though indeede it be the
better parte and the stronger. The principall Citty of
this Prouince lieth in the plaine which is betweene the
riuer 
Loze
 and 
Ambrize,
 and is called 
Panza
 (which is
a common name for euery towne.) There dwelleth
the Lorde of the Prouince, and it is distant from the sea
a hundred miles. In this 
Signorie
 also doo the hilles be∣ginne,

where the mines of 
Siluer
 and other Mettalles
are founde, and so stretch out towardes the kingdome
of 
Angola.
 It is very rich: for vpon the coast of the sea
there, they haue great store of the 
Lumache,
 which are
vsed for Moneyes ouer all the kingdome of 
Congo:
 Be∣sides,
there is also a greater trafficke & Market for slaues,
that are brought out of 
Angola,
 then in any place els.
For there are yearely bought by the Portingalles aboue
fiue thousand head of 
Negroes,
 which afterwardes they
conueigh away with them, and so sell them into diuers
parts of the worlde.


The people of this Prouince are in armes the most
valiant of all the Kingdome of 
Congo.
 They go armed
like the 
Sclauonians,
 with long and large swords, that are
brought them out of 
Portingal.
 There are among them
very mighty men, that wil cleaue a slaue in the middest
at one blowe, and cut of the head of a Bull at one stroke
with one of those swordes. And (that which is
more, and will peraduenture seeme incredible) one of
these valiant men did beare vppon his arme a certaine
vessell of wine, which was the fourth parte of a Butte,
and might waigh about 325. pound, vntill it was cleane




emptied. Moreouer, they do carry bow and arrowes,
whereat they are very quicke and nimble, and withall
their long Targets made of the 
Dants
 skin, whereof we
told you before, when we made mentiō of the 
Anzichi.


The Creatures that are founde in this Prouince, are
first the Elephantes,
 which doo breed ouer all the king∣dome
of 
Congo,
 but principally in the countrey of 
Bam∣ba,

because it aboundeth in Woodes, in pastures and
in waters, more then any of the rest, by reason of the
many riuers that runne through it. And therefore the
countrey is (as it were) appropriated to nourishe and
breede such a kinde of beaste, as is indeede of an vnrea∣sonable
bignesse.
 For 
Signor Odoardo
 tolde me, that hee
had oftentimes taken the measure of an 
Elephantes
 foot
in the dust,
 & one of them was in plain 
Diameteer
 fower
spannes broade. Whereby if you frame the whole cir∣cle
of the foote, accordingly you may by proportion
finde out the bignesse of the whole bodie of the beast.
This foot they cal 
Malo-Manzao
 that is to say, the 
Foot
of an Elephant.
 And if in 
Portingal,
 in 
Italy,
 & in 
Germany,

ther haue been seen in our times, any of these creatures
that were far lesser in respect of the aforesaid hugenes,
you must vnderstande that they were but young, and
brought into those countreyes in their tender age, of
purpose to make them tame.
 But in these quarters they
say that the Elephantes doe liue an hundred and fiftie
yeares, and that vntill the middle of their age they con∣tinue
still in growing.
 And to confirme this truth hee
added, that he had seene and waighed diuerse of their
teeth (which are not of home, as some thinke) and their
waight amounted to 200. pounds a peece after the rate
of xii. ounces to euery pound. In the language of 
Congo





the 
Elephants
 tooth is called 
Mene-Manzao,
 that is to
say, 
The tooth of an Elephant:
 and their young ones are
called 
Moana-Manzao,
 that is, a young 
Elephant.
 Their
eares are greater then the greatest Targattes that the

Turks
 vse to weare, in length sixe spans, in shape like an
Eg, & towards their sholders they grow to be narrow∣er
& sharper. With their ears, & with their tronke, and
with their tayle, they beate away the flies that trouble
them: yea and some haue leaft it in writing, that where
they cannot reach with their tronke, with their eares,
or with their taile, they will gather their skinne toge∣ther,
and so nip the poore flies to death betweene the
wrincles.


They haue in their taile certaine hayres or bristles
as bigge as rushes or broome-spriggs,
 of a shining black
colour. The older they bee, the fayrer and stronger
they be, and of great price among them. For the people
of that countrey doe greatly esteeme them because the
noble men and women of the kingdome of 
Angola,
 and
of the 
Ambundi
 their neighbours doe vse to adorne and
bedecke their neckes withal, & therefore do loue them,
for that they are indeede very fayre and rare, and grow
vpon so goodly a beast. They are very stronge, and like
a twined corde, so that if a man shall striue to breake
them asunder with both his handes, hee shall not bee
able with all his force and strength to cracke them, but
rather spoyle his handes with them. And for the cause
lately rehearsed, many there are, which waiting for the

Elephantes,
 when they ascend some steepe and narrowe
way, doe come behinde them, and with very sharpe
kniues cut of their tayles: the poor beast being not able
in those straits to turne back to reuenge it selfe, not with




his tronke to reach his enemie. And this they do, onely
to haue those haires, which they sell for two or three
flaues a peece. Other light & couragious persons there
are, that trusting much to their swiftnes in running, do
he in a waite, and set vpon the poore beastes behinde,
whiles they are in feeding, and at one blow attempt to
cut off their tayles, & so endeauour to saue themselues
by running away in a rounde. For the greatnes of the
beast is such, as outright it is very swift, because it ma∣keth
very large strides though in deede but slowe, and
in the plaine is farre quicker then any lustie horse: but
in turning rounde it looseth much time, and so the
huntseman escapeth in safetie. And therefore many
haue beene surprised and slaine by the 
Elephantes,
 that
haue sought to escape from them by running away out∣right.


Our Auncestors,
 being not well enformed in these
matters haue leaft in writing, that the 
Elephantes
 could
not ly down vpō the ground, but that they vsed to lean
themselues against a tree: which being before weake∣ned
or sawed in sunder by the hunters, both the 
Ele∣phantes

and the tree fel downe to the earth, and so were
taken. But 
Signor Odoardo
 affirmed vpon his credit, that
they lay downe vpon the ground, that they kneeled vp∣on
their knees, and that they woulde with both their
fore-feete leape vpon the trees to feede on the leaues, &
stoope downe to drink of the waters, that were in their
caues, and that they had their iointes as other creatures
haue, sauing that in some partes they do somewhat dif∣fer
from others: as for example, frō the hoofes of their
fore-feete, vp to their shoulders, you shall not perceaue
that they haue any more then two ioyntes. In their




feeding: they vse to shake and roote vp the great trees
with the force of their shoulders,
 and strength of their
whole backes▪ But the smaller trees they take between
both their teeth, and so bowe them and plucke them
downe, that they may feede vpon the leaues of them:
insomuch as sometimes they breake one of their teeth
with so doing. And this is the cause why you shall find
diuers of them in the fieldes that haue lost their teeth.
They chawe their meate with their short teeth, which
are not seene as their two long tuskes are: and they car∣ry
it to their mouth by their long Snout, or Tronke,
which is to them in steed of an arme & a hand. The tip
of their Tronke is fashioned & diuided into little slits,
and (as it were) fingers, wherewith they will take vp
very small thinges, as Nuttes, and Strawes, and Berries,
& so reach them to their mouth, as I 
Philippo Pigafetta

haue seene my selfe at 
Lisbone.


The Females of these creatures doe beare their
broode in their wombe for the space of two yeares and
no more:
 And forasmuch as the younge 
Elephant
 can∣not
so quickly bee brought vp, (for it groweth very
slowly) the milke is kept from it, and so it waxeth apt to
feede of it selfe. And therefore Mother 
Nature
 hath
prouided that the 
Elephantes
 are not great with young,
but from seauen yeares to seauen yeares.


Their skinne is harde beyond all credite.
 For be∣ing
fower fingers thicke, it cannot bee pearced, no not
with the shot of an Arcubuse. And 
Signor Odoardo
 re∣ported,
that with a little Gunne, which is called a 
Pe∣treraa,

one of them was stricken, without any wound
making, but indeede he was grieuously bruised, so that
he ranne away from that place all in a rage, the space of




three daies iourney and there died, after hee had slaine
certaine slaues that he met by the way.


The people of that Countrey haue not the skill to
tame these beastes. Whereby they might reape great
commodity and profite, for carrying their stuffe from
place to place for diuerse other good vses. But yet they
take them; by digging certaine deepe trenches in the
places, where they vse to pasture; which trenches are
very narrowe at the bottome, and broade aboue, to the
end the beast may not help himselfe, & leape out when
he is fallen into them. These trenches they couer with
Soddes of earth, and grasse, and leaues, because the
beast shoulde not see their traine, but passing ouer them
remaine there entrenched. Whereupon the Gentle∣man
beforenamed tolde mee, that hee had seene with
his owne eyes a very straunge and admirable thing in

Coanza,
 namely, that a younge 
Elephant
 following his
damme fell downe by chaunce into one of these pittes,
and after that shee coulde not with all her skill and
strength drawe him out of it, she buried him therein,
and couered him with earth, with branches, and with
bowes, insomuch as she filled the pit vp to the toppe, to
the ende that the hunters shoulde not enioy her calfe,
choosing rather to kill it her selfe, then to leaue it to the
mercie of the cruell huntsemen. This louing and kind
mother, not fearing the people (that stood round about
her, & shouted against her, & threatned her with sun∣dryweapons,
& vttered straunge clamours and noyses
to affray her, & cast many fiers at her) but assuring her
selfe in her owne stronge and valiant nature, did labour
and toyle from morning till night, that she might draw
her calfe out of the pitte: and when shee founde that




it was not possible for her to atchieue what she desired,
then shee couered it in manner as wee haue tolde you.


The 
Elephant
 is a very gentle beast, and trusteth
greatly in his natural strength. He feareth nothing, nor
hurteth any man that doth not trouble him:
 and haun∣teth
neere to mens houses without doing any harme at
all. If he espie men that go in his walke, he wil not med∣dle
with them, vnlesse they seeke to molest him: sauing
that sometimes peraduenture hee will gently with his
snowte hoyse them vpwardes into the ayre, whom he
meeteth withall in his way; and that is all the hurt hee
will doo vnto them. These 
Elephantes
 doo greatly de∣light
in waters: and if a man be desirous to see them, his
best way is to lie somewhere nigh to the Riuers, and
Lakes, where they vse to haunt about noone tide, to
drinke, to refresh themselues, and to bathe their bodies
in the water: for there they will stande vp to their bel∣lies,
and all the rest of their bodie, that is aboue the wa∣ter,
they will wash all ouer with the water that they
snuffe vp into their snout for that purpose. And be∣cause
there are so many foords & pastures (as is said) in
the kingdome of 
Congo,
 therefore is there very great
store of these creatures in that countrey. For 
Signor O∣doardo

affirmed, that in the way betweene 
Cazanze,
 &

Loanda,
 in a little grassie valley hee had seene about a
hundred of them in a company, olde and young that
followed their dammes: and these were the first young
ones that euer hee saw till that day. And herewithall
you must vnderstand, that they vse to go together in
heardes, as 
Kine,
 and 
Camelles,
 and other such like gen∣tle
Creatures doo, and not alone like 
Lions
 and other
such wilde beastes. Now the reason why this country




aboundeth so in 
Iuory,
 is easy to be yeelded. For so many

Elephantes
 being bredde in that Region, they made no
account of that commodity in times past: but onely af∣ter
that the 
Portingalles
 began to trafficke with those
countreyes, it grewe in estimation: and so hauing ga∣thered
together in so many ages an infinite quantity
thereof, which they found in their fieldes, they haue
sould them till this day at a very good penniworth.


It is not knowen,
 whether there be in that countrey
any other beast that is so big as an 
Elephant
 is, nor whe∣ther
there breed therein any 
Rinoceros,
 which is a Crea∣tures
as bigge indeede as the 
Elephant,
 and in 
India
 is cal∣led
a 
Bada.
 But yet there are brought into the countries
of the 
Anzichi
 some of their hornes that growe vpon
their noses, that are both of great value & estimation, &
also vsed for the help of diuers diseases. So that it is very
credible and likely, that there are some of them to bee
founde in those quarters.


There are in the Region of the 
Anzichi Lions
 also,
like the 
Lions
 that breed in other partes of the worlde,

but they doo not vse to haunt the Region of 
Bamba:

But in 
Bamba
 there are very great store of 
Tigres,

which are of the very same shape that those in 
Florence

are,
 which 
Signor Odoardo
 saw there, and testified to be
very 
Tygres
 indeed. He tolde mee also of a notable cu∣stome
which they haue: And that is, that they will not
set vpon any men that are white, but onely such as are
blacke: And it hath beene found, that when the white
and the blacke haue slept together in the night time,
they haue slayne the blacke to deuoure them, and spa∣red
the white. When they are hungry they will bee so
bolde as to fetch cattell euen out of the yardes that




are about the houses without any feare at all, when
they cannot finde any victuailes abroade in the fieldes.
They are very daungerous and hurtfull to all kindes
of Creatures whatsoeuer they be, and in that language
they are called 
Engoi.
 They are as fierce and cruell
beastes as the 
Lion,
 and roare as the 
Lion
 doth. They
are also altogether like the 
Lion,
 sauing onely in the co∣lour
of their haire; for the 
Tygre
 is spotted, but the 
Lyon

is all of one colour.
 They vse to take and kill these 
Ty∣gres

after diuers manners. For besides that, which hath
beene before spoken, they poyson them with 
Sublimate

or some other venome, mingled with flesh which is laid
for them. Or els they tie young 
Goates
 at certaine lines
made like snares, and fastned about the stocke of a tree,
so that when the beast commeth to her pray, the en∣gine
openeth it selfe, and the more the beast striueth
withall, the more it is intangled, and so at last is hanged
therein. Another way they haue to kill them, that is
with arrowes, with Iauelins, and with Arcubuses. It
is a Creature very harmeful, both to the 
Negroes
 them∣selues,
and also to their flockes of sheepe and heards of
cattell.
 Notwithstanding 
Signor Odoardo
 tolde me, that
he had gotten one of them, that was fifteene dayes old,
and he brought it vp with Goates milke: which be∣ing
afterwardes growen bigger would followe him like
a dogge: and although it were very tame, yet it would
not willingly suffer any other to touch it besides his
maister. He woulde also roare mightily, and when he
was angry, his eies wold looke very terribly & fearfully.
But in processe of time this 
Tygre
 killed a 
Dogge,
 belong∣ing
to the house, and also a 
Zebra,
 that were very 

to their maister, and thereupon, perceiuing 

















a beast it was, hee slewe it with an Arcubuse-shot.
He reported moreouer, that the 
Mostacchios
 of the 
Ty∣gre

are helde in that Region to be mortall poyson: for
being giuen in meates, it procureth a man to die, as it
were in a madnesse: And therefore the king doth pu∣nish
all those that bring him a 
Tygres
 skinne without the

Mostacchios.


There breedeth likewise in this Countrey another
Creature,
 which they call a 
Zebra,
 commonly founde
also in certaine Prouinces of 
Barbary
 and 
Africa:
 which
although it be altogether made like a great 
Mule,
 yet is
not a 
Mule
 indeed, for it beareth young ones. It hath
a most singular skinne, and peculiar from all other crea∣tures.
For from the ridge of the chine downe towards
the bellie, it is straked with rowes of three colours,
blacke, white, and browne Bay, about the breadth of
three fingers a peece, and so meet againe together in a
circle, euery rowe, with his owne colour. So that the
necke, and the head; and the Mane (which is not great)
and the eares, and all the legges are so interchaunged
with these colours, and in such manner and order, as
without all faile, if the first strake beginne with white,
then followeth the second with blacke, & in the thirde
place the Bay: & so another course beginning in white
endeth still in Bay. And this rule is generally and infal∣libly
obserued ouer all the body. The tayle is like the
tayle of a 
Mule,
 of a Morell colour, but yet it is well co∣loured,
and hath a glistring glosse. The feet like the feet
of a 
Mule,
 and so are the hooffes. But touching the rest
of her carriage and qualities, she is very lusty and plea∣saunt
as a horse: and specially in going, and in running
she is so light & so swift that it is admirable. In somuch




as in 
Portingale
 and in 
Castile
 also, it is commonly vsed
(as it were for a prouerbe) 
As swift as a Zebra,
 when they
will signifie an exceeding quickenes. These creatures
are all wilde, they breede euery yeare, and are there in
such aboundance that they are innumerable. If they
were made tame, they woulde serue to runne and to
drawe for the warres, and for many other good vses, as
well as the best horses that are. So that Mother 
Nature

seemeth to haue sufficiently prouided in euery country
for the commodity and necessity of man, with diuers
sortes of Creatures, of nourishments, and temperature
of ayre, to the ende hee shoulde want nothing. And
therefore they hauing no horses at all in the whole
Kingdome of 
Congo,
 nor any skill to vse their oxen
to the yoke, or to the packsaddle, that they might ey∣ther
be drawen or carryed, nor to tame their 
Zebraes

with bridle and saddle, or any other way to take the be∣nefite
of their beastes, that might transport them from
place to place:
 Euen very necessity hath taught them to
vse men in steed of labouring cattel. For either they lay
thēselues al along in certain Litters (as it were) or els set
themselues vpright, with shadows ouer them to keepe
them from the Sunne, and so they cause themselues to
be carried too and fro, by their slaues, or by other men
that for wages are alwaies ready at Poste-houses to that
purpose. They that meane to iourney with speede, do
take with them many slaues, and when the first num∣ber
are weary, then do the seconde number vndertake
the burden, and so successiuely chaunge one after ano∣ther,
as the 
Tartarians
 and 
Persians
 vse to do with their
horses: and these men being thus accustomed to these
labours, (and so often chaunging) will go as fast, as any













































































Postilion
 gallop. Of all which fashions of carrying or go∣ing
in iourney, we haue set down the pictures as also of
the 
Zebra,
 of the apparel both of the men & women, of
the souldiers, and of the Military Instrumentes or 
Cor∣nets.


There are also to bee founde in this countrey cer∣taine
other foure-footed beastes,
 somewhat lesse then

Oxen,
 of colour red, with hornes like 
Goats
 horns, which
are very smooth and glistering, and enclining to black:
whereof they make diuers prety knackes, as they doe
likewise of the 
Buffes
 hornes. They haue their heades
and their haires, like the heads and haires of 
Oxen:
 and
their skinnes are of great estimation: & therefore they
are carried into 
Portingall,
 and from thence into 
Germa∣ny,

to be dressed, and then they are called 
Dantes.
 The
king of 
Congo
 is very desirous to haue some men that
had skill to cleanse them and dresse them, and to make
them fit for vse, to the end hee might employ them for
Armour of defence. And yet those nations doo alrea∣dy
vse them for shieldes and Targats: and do find that
they will resist the blowe of a weapon, and especially
the shot of an Arrow. They kill them with Arcubuses
and with arrowes. But if they doe espy the huntsman,
they wil set vpon him, and being by nature very fierce,
and couragious, they will so knocke him and thumpe
him with their feete and their Muzzle (because they
cannot do him any harme with their hornes) that they
wil leaue him either halfe deade or starke dead. There
is also an infinite number of wilde 
Buffes,
 that go wan∣dring
about the deserts in the kingdoms of the 
Anzichi,

and wilde 
Asses
 likewise, which the 
Greekes
 call 
Ona∣gri.






There are besides these, other beasts called 
Empalan∣ga,

which are in bignesse and shape like 
Oxen,
 sauing
that they holde their necke and heade aloft, and haue
their hornes broade and crooked, three handbreadthes
long, diuided into knots, and sharp at the endes, where∣of
they might make very faire 
Cornets
 to sound withall:
and although they liue in the forrests, yet are they not
noysome nor harmefull. The skinnes of their neckes
are vsed for shoo-soles, and their flesh for meate. They
might likewise bee brought to drawe the plough, and
doo good seruice in any other labour, and tilling of
the ground. Moreouer they feed great heards of 
Kine,

and tame 
Oxen,
 tame 
Hogges
 and wilde 
Boares,
 flockes of

Sheepe
 and 
Goates. Signor Odoardo
 affirmed, that the

Goates
 and the 
Sheepe
 doo bring forth two, and three, &
foure lambes or kids at a time, and two when they haue
fewest, and neuer one alone at any time. And because
their pasture is so fat, they do all sucke, and milke their
owne dammes, which hee proued himselfe to be true
in his owne house, where hee had very great store of
that Cattell.


There are 
Wolues
 also which loue the oyle of 
Palmes

beyonde all measure,
 and haue a great sent: a propertie
that 
Virgile
 attributeth to 
Dogges, Odora Canum vis, The
smelling sent of Dogges.
 They will smell this oyle a farre
off, and steale it in the night time out of their houses of
strawe, and sometimes from those that carry it by the
way, whiles the poore soules doe rest themselues and
sleepe. The oyle (as shall be tolde you) is made of the

Palme
 tree: it is thicke and harde like Butter. And it is
a maruell to see, how these 
Wolues
 do take a bottle that
is full of this liquor betweene their teeth, & so cast it




on their shoulders and run away withall, as our 
Wolues

here doo with a 
Sheepe.
 There are very great store of

Foxes,
 that steale 
Hennes
 as our 
Foxes
 doo. And further
in this country of 
Bamba,
 there is an innumerable quan∣tity
of hunting game,
 as 
Stagges, Fallow-Deere, Roebucks,

and 
Gazelles,
 whereof he affirmed that he had seene ex∣ceeding
great heardes, as also of 
Conies
 and 
Hares,
 be∣cause
there were no hunters to kill them.


In the Region of 
Pemba
 there are many wilde 
Ciuet-Cattes,

which the 
Portingales
 call 
Algazia,
 and some of
these the people of that countrey had made tame, that
they might inioy their 
Ciuet,
 in the smell whereof they
doo greatly delight. But this was before the 
Portingals

did trafficke with those Countryes. And in 
Manibatta

there are caught many 
Sables,
 with very white hayres
and exceeding fine, called 
Incire:
 but no man may
weare these skinnes, vnlesse the Prince permit him so
to do: for it is helde in great estimation, and euery 
Sa∣ble

is worth a slaue. Towardes the 
Anzichi
 they catch

Marterns
 also,
 wherewith they apparrell themselues, as
in due place we will note vnto you.


Apes,
 
Monkeyes,
 and such other kinde of beastes,
small and great of all sortes there are many in the Regi∣on
of 
Sogno,
 that lyeth vpon the Riuer 
Zaire.
 Some of
them are very pleasant and gamesome, and make good
pastime, and are vsed by the Lordes there for their re∣creation
and to shew them sport. For although they
be vnreasonable Creatures, yet will they notably coun∣terfait
the countenances, the fashions, & the actions of
men. In euery one of these Regions abouenamed, there
are some of the aforesaid Creatures, in some places mo,
and in some places fewer.






Of 
Adders,
 and 
Snakes
 in these countries there bree∣deth
a certaine kinde,
 that in respect of our countryes is
very straunge, and of an excessiue greatnesse. For you
shall finde some that are xxv. spanne long, and fiue span
broade: and the bellie and the mouth so large, that they
can swallow and receiue into their bellie a whole 
Stag,

or any other creature of that bignesse. And it is cal∣led
that is to say a great 
Water-Adder.
 It wil go forth
of the water vp to the land to prey for his victuails, and
then returne into the riuers againe, and so it liueth in
both the Elements. It wil get it self vp vpon the bows &
braunches of trees, and there watch the cattell that feed
thereaboutes, which when they are come neere vnto
it, presently it will fall vpon them, and wind it selfe in
many twines about them, and clappe his tayle on their
hinder partes, and so it strayneth them and biteth so ma∣ny
holes in them, that at last it killeth them. And then
it draweth them into some woode or other solitary
place, where it deuoureth them at pleasure, skinne,
hornes, hooffes and all. Now it falleth out, that when
it is thus full, and (as it were) great with so monstrous
a meale, it becommeth almost drunke & very sleepie, so
that any child may kil it. And in this sort wil it remaine
full & satisfied for the space of 5. or 6. daies together,
& then returne againe to prey. These 
Adders
 do change
their skinnes in their ordinarie seasons, yea and some∣times
after they haue eaten so monstrously, and the said
sloughes, when they are found, are gathered vp and re∣serued
for a shew of so vnmeasurable a Creature. These

Adders
 are also greatly esteemed by the 
Pagan Negroes,

for they do vse to rost them, and eate them for meat, &
make more account of them then they doo of 
Hennes,





or any such delicate flesh. They find great store of them
when they haue occasion to burne their thicke woods:
for there they shall haue them lying on the ground, ro∣sted
with the fire.


Besides these there are 
Vipers
 also,
 well knowne vnto
that people. Which 
Vipers
 are so venemous, that such
as are bitten by them doe die within the space of xxiiii.
houres: But the 
Negroes
 are acquainted with certaine
hearbes that will heale their woundes.


There are also certaine other Creatures,
 which be∣ing
as big as 
Rams,
 haue wings like 
Dragons,
 with long
tailes and long chappes, and diuerse rowes of teeth, &
feede vpon raw flesh. Their colour is blew and greene,
their skinne bepaynted like scales, and two feete they
haue but no more. The 
Pagan Negroes,
 do vse to wor∣shippe
them as 
Goddes,
 and at this day you may see di∣uers
of them that are kept for a maruaile. And because
they are very rare, the Chiefe Lordes there doo curi∣ously
preserue them, and suffer the people to worship
them, which tendeth greatly to their profite, by reason
of the giftes and oblations which the people offer vnto
them.


There are there also to be found 
Chameleons,
 which
haue fower feete, and breede vpon the rockes, and liue
of the winde and the aire, of the bignesse and likenesse
of an 
Efte,
 with a sharpe heade, and a tayle like a sawe.
They are for the most parte of the colour of the skie,
but somewhat more duskie and greenish, and if you
stand to looke a while vpon them, you shall see them
chaunge themselues into diuers colours. They dwell
much vpon high rockes and trees, to the ende they may
take aire, wherewith they are nourished.






Other serpentes there are that are venemous,
that carrie vpon the tippe of their taile a certaine little
roundell like a bell,
 which ringeth as they go, so as it
may be hearde. It may be it was there set by nature, of
purpose, that people should beware of them, and it is
founde by experience that these belles and the heades
of the serpents are very good remedies against an ague,
and against the trembling of the hart. These kindes and
sortes of lande-Creatures are to be founde in these re∣gions,
besides others also that are commonly to be had
in other countries.


It resteth now, that we speake somewhat touching

Birdes,
 and first of all of the 
Eastriche,
 because it is big∣ger
then all the rest. These 
Eastriches
 are found in those
partes of 
Sundi
 and of 
Batta,
 that are towardes the 
Mu∣zambi.

The young 
Eastriches
 doo spring out of their
egges, being warmed and disclosed by the eye & heate
of the 
Sunne.
 Their feathers are vsed in steede of 
En∣signes

and 
Banners
 in warre,
 mingled with some plumes
of the 
Peacocke,
 and are fashioned in the likenesse of a
shadowe against the Sunne. And forasmuch as I am
fallen into the speech of 
Peacockes,
 I must tell you by the
way, that in the partes, of 
Angola,
 there are 
Peacockes

brought vp priuately in a certaine woode that is com∣passed
about with walles: and the king will not suffer
any other bodie to keepe those birdes but onely him∣selfe,
because they are for the 
Royall Ensignes,
 as I tolde
you before. And it is read in auncient histories of 
A∣lexander
the Great,
 that he did also priuiledge this Birde,
at such time as he first saw it in 
Europe.


There are also 
Indie-Cockes
 and 
Hens,
 and 
Geese,
 and

Duckes
 of all sortes both wilde and tame:
 
Partriches
 so




many as children take them with ginnes. Other birdes
they haue likewise, as 
Pheasantes,
 which they call 
Gallig∣noles,
Pigeons,
 
Turtles,
 and of these small birdes called

Becca fichi
 an infinite number. Birdes of prey, as 
Eagles-Royall,
Faulcons, Gerfaulcons
 and 
Sparhaukes,
 and others,
great store, which notwithstanding the people neuer
vse to hauke withall. Birdes of the sea, as 
Pellicanes
 (for
so the 
Portingalles
 do call them) white and great,
 which
swimme vnder the water, and haue their throates so
wide, that they will swallow a whole fish at once. This
bird hath so good a stomacke, and naturally so hot, that
it easily digesteth the fish that it swalloweth whole, and
the skinne of it is so hoat, that the people of that coun∣trey
do vse to weare them, and to warme their colde
stomackes withall, and therefore make great reckoning
of them.


There are many white 
Herons
 and 
Gray Bittours,
 that
feede in the washes there, and are called 
Royall Birdes.

Other 
Fowles
 there are of the likenesse of a 
Crane,
 with
a red bill and redde feete, as bigge as 
Storkes,
 and their
feathers for the most part redde and white, and some
darke graye. Goodly birdes they are to looke too, and
the people of the countrey doo call them 
Flemminges,

because they doo much resemble them, and are good
meat to eate.


They haue 
Parrattes
 of gray colour,
 great and very
talkatiue: & others of greene colour, but they are little
ones & not so talkatiue: They haue likewise certaine
smal little birds, which they call 
Birds of Musicke,
 and yet
greater thē the 
Canarie Birds,
 of feather & bill red: some
greene, with their feet & bill only black: some all white:
some gray or dunne: some all blacke, and this kinde is




more sweet in their notes then all the rest aforenamed:
for you woulde thinke that they talked in their singing.
Others there are of diuers colours: but they do all sing
in sundrie sorts, so that the chiefe Lords of those coun∣treyes,
from auncient times to this day, haue continu∣ally
kept them in cages, and greatly esteemed them for
their song.






Chap. 10.
Of the Prouince of Sogno, which is the Countrey
of the Riuer Zaire, and Loango.


T
His Countrey is bounded with the
Riuer 
Ambrize,
 towardes the 
North
 in
seauen degrees and a halfe, and so tra∣uersing
the Riuer 
Lelunda,
 and the Ri∣uer

Zaire
 it endeth at the Rockes called

Barreuras Vermellias,
 that is to say, the

Redde pittes,
 which are in the borders of the Kingdome
of 
Loango.
 In the middest of this Prouince there is a
certaine 
Territory,
 called by the same name 
Sogno,
 where
the Gouernour of the Countrey dwelleth. The chiefe
Lordes that rule this Prouince are called 
Mani-Sogno,

that is 
Princes of Sogno,
 and are commonly of the blood

Royall.
 The Prince that gouerneth there at this day is




called 
Dō Diego Mani-Sogno.
 He hath vnder his dominiō
many other petty Lords,
 & other prouinces, that in olde
time were free and liued by themselues, as the people of

Mombalas,
 situate somwhat neere to the Cittie of 
Congo,

which are now subiect to this gouernement. And on
the other side of the Riuer 
Zaire
 towardes the 
North
 is
the Prouince of 
Palmar,
 that is to say of 
Palmes,
 because
there is great store of 
Palme trees
 growing therein. O∣ther
Lordes there are, that border vpon the King of

Loango,
 who was sometime subiect to the King of 
Con∣go,

but in processe of time he became a free Lord, and
now professeth himselfe to be in amity with the king of

Congo,
 but not to be this vassall. The people that are vn∣der
these Lords in those borders, are called the 
Bramas:

and they reach within land,
 vnder the 
Equinoctiall
 line
towardes the 
East
 to the boundes of 
Anzicana,
 all along
the Mountaines which diuide them from the 
Anzichi

vpon the 
North.
 They are called by the people of 
Loan∣go,
Congreamolal,
 because they were subiect to 
Congo.


In this Countrey of 
Loango
 there are many 
Elephants

and great store of 
Iuory
 which they doo willingly ex∣chaunge
for a little iron,
 so that for the naile of a shippe
(be it neuer so small) they will giue a whole 
Elephantes

tooth. The reason thereof is either because there grow∣eth
no iron in that place, or els they haue not the skill
to get it out of the mines where it groweth: But all the
iron they can get they employ for heading of their ar∣rowes,
and their other weapons, as we told you, when
we spake of the 
Bramas.


They make great store of cloth of the 
Palme
 trees,

whereof wee made mention before: but these are lesser
and yet very fine. They haue greate aboundance of




Kine and of other cattell before named. They are in
Religion 
Pagans:
 their apparell after the fashion of
the people of 
Congo:
 They maintaine warre with their
bordering neighbours, which are the 
Anzichi
 and the
inhabitants of 
Anzicana,
 & when they enterprise warre
against the 
Anzichi,
 then they craue aide of the people
of 
Congo,
 and so they remaine halfe in freedome, and
halfe in daunger of others. They worship what they
list, and hold the 
Sunne
 for the greatest 
God,
 as though
it were a man, and the 
Moone
 next, as though it were a
woman. Otherwise euery man chooseth to himselfe
his owne idol, and worshippeth it after his owne plea∣sure.
These people would easily embrace the Christi∣an
Religion: For many of them, that dwell vpon the
borders of 
Congo
 haue beene conuerted to Christen∣dome:
and the rest, for want of Priestes and of such as
should instruct them in true religion, do remaine stil in
their blindnes.






Chap. 11.
Of the third Prouince called Sundi.


T
His Prouince of 
Sundi
 is the nee∣rest
of all to the Citty of 
Congo,

called 
Citta di San-Saluatore,
 the
Citty of 
Saint Sauiours,
 and be∣ginneth
about 40. miles distant
from it, and quite out of the ter∣ritory
thereof, and reacheth to




the riuer 
Zaire,
 and so ouer the same to the other side
where the 
Caduta
 or 
Fall
 is, which wee mentioned be∣fore:
and then holdeth on vpwardes on both sides to∣wards
the 
North,
 bordering vpon 
Anzicana
 and the 
An∣zichi.

Towardes the 
South
 it goeth along the said riuer

Zaire,
 vntill you come to the meeting of it with the Ri∣uer

Bancare,
 and all along the bankes thereof, euen to
the rootes of the mountaine of 
Christall.
 In the bounds
of the Prouince of 
Pango,
 it hath her principall Terri∣tory,
where the Gouernour lyeth, who hath his name
from the Prouince of 
Sundi,
 and is seated about a daies
iourney neere to the 
Fall
 of the Riuer, towardes the

South.


This Prouince is the chiefest of all the rest,
 and (as it
were) the Patrimony of all the kingdome of 
Congo:
 and
therefore it is alwaies gouerned by the Kinges eldest
Sonne, and by those Princes that are to succeede him.
As it fell out in the time of their first Christian King,
that was called 
Don Iohn:
 whose eldest sonne, that was
Gouernour here succeeded him, and was called 
Don
Alfonso.
 And euer sithence, the Kinges of 
Congo
 haue
successiuely continued this custome, to consigne this
Gouernement to those Princes which are to succeede
in the kingdome: As did the king that nowe is called

Don Aluaro,
 who was in this Gouernment before 
Don
Aluaro
 the King his father died,
 and was called 
Mani-Sundi.


And here by the way you must note, that in all the
Kingdome of 
Congo
 there is not any person, that posses∣seth
any proper goodes of his owne, whereof hee may
dispose, and leaue to his heyres: but all is the Kinges, &
he distributeth all offices, all goodes, and all landes, to




whomsoeuer it pleaseth him. Yea and to this law, euen
the Kinges owne sonnes are subiect. So that if any
man do not pay his tribute yearely (as hee ought) the
King taketh away his Gouernement from him, and gi∣ueth
it to another. As it happened to the king that now
liueth, who at the time that 
Signor Odoardo
 was at the
Courte, being of his owne nature very liberall, and
bountifull beyond measure, and one that bestowed
much vpon his seruants, could not discharge those im∣positions
that the king had layed on him. Whereupon
he was by the king depriued of his reuenews, of his go∣uernement,
and of his royall fauour, that is to say in
that language, hee was 
Tombocado,
 as we will declare
more at full in the seconde part of this discourse.


Many Lords there are that are subiect to the Gouer∣nour
or 
Sundi.
 The people do trafficke with their neigh∣bour
Countries,
 felling and bartering diuers things. As
for example, falt, & clothes of sundry colours, brought
from the 
Indies,
 and from 
Portingale,
 and 
Luma
 to
serue for their coine. And for these commodities they
doo exchaunge cloth of 
Palme
 trees, and 
Iuory,
 and the
skinnes of 
Sables
 and Marternes, and certaine girdles
wrought of the leaues of 
Palme
 trees, which are great∣ly
esteemed in those partes.


There groweth in these countries great store of 
Chri∣stall,

and diuers kinds of mettall: but 
Iron
 they loue a∣boue
all the rest, saying that the other mettalles are to
no vse: for with Iron they can make kniues, and wea∣pons,
and hatchers, and such like instruments, that are
necessary and profitable for the vse of mans nature.








Chap. 12.
Of the fourth Prouince called
Pango.


T
He Prouince of 
Pango
 in aunci∣ent
time was a free kingdome,

that was gouerned of it selfe, &
bordereth on the 
North
 vppon

Sundi,
 on the 
South
 vpon 
Batta,

on the 
West
 vpon the Countie
of 
Congo,
 and on the 
East,
 vpon
the mountaines of the 
Sunne.

The principal Territory,
 where the Gouernours dwel∣ling
is, hath the same name that the Prouince hath, viz.

Pango.
 It standeth vpon the Westerne side of the Ri∣uer

Barbela,
 and in olde time was called 
Pangue-lungos,

and in time afterwardes the worde was corrupted and
chaunged into 
Pango.
 Through the middest of this
Prouince runneth the riuer 
Berbela,
 which fetcheth his
originall from the great 
Lake
 (whence the riuer 
Nilus

also taketh his beginning) and from another lesser 
Lake

called 
Achelunda,
 and so dischargeth it selfe into 
Zaire.





And although this be the least Countrey of all the rest,
yet doth it yeeld no lesse tribute then the rest.


This Prouince was conquered after the Countrey
of 
Sundi,
 and made subiect to the Princes of 
Congo:
 and
is now all one with it, both in speech and manners, nei∣ther
is there any difference at all betweene them.
 The
present Gouernour thereof is called 
Don Francesco Ma∣ni-Pango,

and is descended from the most auncient no∣bilitie
of all the Lordes of 
Congo:
 and in all consultati∣ons
touching the State he is sent for, because he is nowe
an olde man, and of great wisedome. For hee hath re∣mained
in the gouernment of this region for the space
of fiftie yeares, and no man euer complained of him,
neither did the king at any time take his gouernement
from him.


The trafficke of this Prouince is like the trafficke of

Sundi.






Chap. 13.
Of the fift Prouince called Batta.


T
He boundes of this Prouince are
towards the 
North,
 the Countrey
of 
Pango:
 on the 
East
 it taketh
quite ouer the Riuer 
Barbela,
 and
reacheth to the Mountaines of the

Sunne,
 and to the foote of the




Mountaines of 
Sal-Nitre.
 And on the 
South
 from the
said Mountains, by a line passing through the meeting
of the riuers 
Barbela
 and 
Cacinga,
 to the mountaine 
Brus∣ciato,

that is to say 
Scorched.


Within these boundes is 
Batta
 contayned,
 and the
Principall Cittie, where the Prince dwelleth, is likewise
called 
Batta.
 In auncient time it was called 
Aghirimba,

but afterwardes the word was corrupted, and it is now
called 
Batta.
 It was in old time a very strong and a great
Kingdome, & voluntarily of it selfe, without any war
it ioyned it selfe with the kingdome of 
Congo,
 peraduen∣ture
because there was some dissention among their
Lords:
 and therefore it hath more preheminence then
the rest of the Prouinces of the kingdome of 
Congo,
 in
priuiledges and liberties. For the Gouernment of 
Batta

is alwaies assigned to one, that is of the bloode of the
Kings of that countrey at their choise and pleasure, ha∣uing
no more respect to one then to another, so that he
be of the stocke and bloud Royall, neyther to the eldest
sonne nor to the second. Neither yet goeth this Go∣uernement
by inheritaunce, but the king of 
Congo
 (as
is told you before) doth dispose it at his own pleasure to
whō he thinketh best, to the end they shold not vsurpe
it by way of succession, or by rebellion. Hee dwelleth
neerer the king then any other Gouernour or Lorde of
the kingdom of 
Congo,
 & is the secōd person therin, nei∣ther
may any man gainsay his arguments & reasons, as
they may any of the rest, for it is so decreede among
them. Nowe if the line of the king of 
Congo
 should
chaunce to faile, so that there were none of that blood
to succeed,
 the succession shall fall vpon the gouernour
of 
Batta.
 Hee that now gouerneth there, is called 
Don




Pedro Mani-Batta.


Sometimes he eateth at the kinges owne table, but
yet in a baser seat then the kinges seat is, and that also
not sitting, but standing, which is not graunted to any
other Lord of 
Congo,
 no nor to the sons of the king him∣selfe.
His Court and his traine is little lesse then the
Court & traine of the king of 
Congo.
 For he hath 
Trom∣pets

and 
Drummes
 and other instrumentes going before
him, as becommeth a Prince, and by the 
Portingalles
 he
is commonly called the 
Prince of Batta,
 because (as it is
said) if the succession shoulde faile in the bloode of the
kinges of 
Congo,
 the empire of the whole kingdome
must light vpon some one of this stocke.


Hee doth holde continuall warres with the 
Pagans

that border vpon him: and hee is able to gather toge∣ther
about 70. or 80. thousand fighting men. And be∣cause
hee doth still mayntaine warre with the people
that are next him,
 he hath liberty graunted vnto him to
entertaine Arcubusiers, that shall bee of his owne natu∣rall
subiectes. For the king of 
Congo
 will not suffer any
other Gouernour of any other Prouinces, nor any of
their children, to haue any Arcubusiers, that are borne
within their Countrey, but onely the 
Portingalles. Sig∣nor
Odoardo
 demaunding once of the King, why he did
not giue leaue to his other Gouernours to retaine shot
about them: the King aunswered, that if peraduenture
they should rebell against him with a thousand, or two
thousande Arcubusiers, he should not haue any possi∣bility
to make them resistance.


And forasmuch as wee haue told you,
 that the King
hath graunted licence, onely to the prince of 
Batta,
 to
entertaine Arcubusiers in his owne countrey, it is fitte




you should vnderstand, that hee doth it vpon very ne∣cessary
occasion. For towardes the 
East
 of 
Batta,
 be∣yond
the mountaines of the 
Sunne,
 and of 
Sal-Nitre,
 vp∣on
the bankes of the 
East
 and 
West
 of the riuer 
Nilus,
 &
in the borders of the Empire of 
Mohenhe-Muge
 there
liueth a nation,
 which by the people of 
Congo,
 are called

Giaquas,
 but in their own language they are called 
Agag:

Very fierce they are and warlicke, much giuen to fight
and pillage, and make continuall inroades into the
Countries neere adioyning, and sometimes among the
rest into the Prouince of 
Batta.
 So that this Countrey
must needes be in continuall Armes, and stande vpon
good guarde, and maintaine Arcubusiers to defende
themselues from them.


The Prince of 
Batta
 hath many Lordes vnder him:
and the naturall people of this Prouince are called 
Mon∣sobos,

and their language is well vnderstoode by the in∣habitants
of 
Congo.
 They are farre more rude and ru∣sticall
then the 
Moci-Conghi,
 and the slaues that are
brought from thence, doo proue more obstinate and
stubborne, then those that come from other Coun∣tries.


Their trafficke is the same, that the trafficke of the
other countreyes are,
 whereof we haue last intreated.
And the profite which the king receyueth from 
Batta,

amounteth to double asmuch, as he receiueth out of a∣ny
two of the other Prouinces before mentioned.








Chap. 14.
Of the sixt and last Prouince called
Pemba.


T
He Prouince of 
Pemba
 is seated in
the heart and middle of the King∣dome
of 
Congo,
 compassed and
comprised within the boundes
before described, whose Gouer∣uernour
is called 
Don Antonio
Mani-Pemba,
 seconde sonne to
King 
Don Aluaro,
 that dead is, and brother to the king
that raygneth at this present. And forasmuch as his
father did loue him dearely, he assigned vnto him this
Gouernement, because he knew not what better thing
to giue him, sauing the Realme it selfe: which in deed
he would willingly haue bestowed on him, for that he
was more like vnto him in quality & nature then his el∣dest
son was. But it would not be by reason of the lawe
of the Kingdome, which wold not haue yeelded there∣vnto.


This countrey is the very 
Center
 and middest of all
the state of 
Congo,
 and the originall of all the auncient
Kings, and the Territorie where they were borne, and
the chiefe and principall seat of all the other Prouinces




and Principalities. And therefore the chiefe and roy∣all
Citty of all that Empire is assigned to this Prouince,

whereof we will heareafter deliuer you a full informa∣tion.
The Gouernour of 
Pemba
 dwelleth in a Terri∣torie
of the same name, situate at the foote of the 
Scor∣ched
Mountaine,
 along the Riuer 
Loze,
 which riseth out
of the 
Lake,
 and runneth through the Region of 
Bamba

into the sea.


The Courtiers, and Lordes, and seruitors belong∣ing
to the king of 
Congo,
 haue their goods and possessi∣ons,
and reuenewes in this Prouince, because it is nee∣rest
to the Court, & very conuenient for the conueigh∣ing
of their victuailes, and their other stuffe vnto the
Court. Some of these Lordes, in that parte specially,
that bordereth vpon the aforesaid Prouince of 
Bamba,

haue much a doo to keep fight and defende themselues
from the people of 
Quizama,
 because they are neerest
vnto them. For this people (as wee tolde you) did
rebell against the king of 
Congo,
 and reuolted from him,
and doe professe that they will bee at libertie, and go∣uerned
of themselues.


And here will we end the first booke,
 which con∣sisteth
of the description of the kingdome of 
Congo
 in
generall, and of his borders, and in particular of all the
sixe Prouinces thereof. Now it remayneth that wee
proceede forwarde to the second booke:
 Wherein we
will treate of the situation of the Cittie of 
Congo,
 and
of the Territorie therevnto belonging, of the first chri∣stening
of the king, of his manners, of his Court and
of other conditions appertayning to the politicke and
militarie Gouernment of these people. And afterward
we will describe vnto you the kingdomes neere ad∣ioyning,




and all the regions thereaboutes towardes
the 
South,
 euen till you come to the 
Cape
 of 
Good Hope,

and the riuers and countries of the 
Ocean
 that is right a∣gainst

India:
 and within land the kingdomes of 
Presbi∣ter
Iohn,
 touching also by the way the spring and
original of 
Nilus,
 and the causes of his won∣derful
encrease, which sundry fooles
doe account to bee a
Miracle.














THE SECOND
BOOKE.




Chap. 1.
Of the situation of the Royall Cittie of the
Kingdome of Congo.


A
Lthough the chiefe and
Royall Cittie of the King∣dome
of 
Congo
 bee after a
sort comprehended within
the Prouince of 
Pemba,
 yet
notwithstāding forasmuch
as the gouernement there∣of,
and the territorie there∣vnto
belonging, which
may in compasse amount
to the space of twenty miles about, doeth depende
wholly of the king of 
Congo
 himselfe, wee will place it
in a seuerall regiment, and intreate of it by it selfe.


This cittie is called 
San Saluatore,
 or 
Saint Sauiours,

and in times past in that country language it was called





Banza,
 which generally signifieth the Court, where
the king or the Gouernour doeth ordinarily soiourne.

It is seated about 150. miles from the sea, vpon a great
and a high Mountaine, being almost all of a rocke, but
yet hauing a veyne of iron in it, whereof they haue
great vse in their housing. This mountaine hath in the
toppe of it a great plaine,
 very well manured and fur∣nished
with houses and villages, contayning in circuite
about ten miles, where there doeth dwell and liue the
number of a hundred thousand persons.


The soile is fruitfull,
 and the ayre fresh, holesome
and pure: there are great store of springes, of indiffe∣rent
good water to drinke, and at certaine times doo
not harme any man: and of all sortes of cattell great
aboundance. The toppe of the mountaine is seuered
and distinguished from all the rest of the hill which is
about it, and therefore the 
Portingalles
 doe call it 
The
Otheiro,
 that is to say, 
a Viewe,
 or a 
Watch Tower,
 or a

Singular height,
 from whence you may take a sight of
all the Champeigne round about. Onely towardes the

East,
 and towardes the Riuer, it is verye steepe and
rockie.


For two causes did the first Princes of this King∣dome
place this habitation in the foresaide 
Height
 of
this Mountaine.
 First, because it lyeth in the very
middest and (as it were) in the 
Center
 of all the Realme,
from whence he may presently send ayde to any part
of his Kingdom that may stand in neede of reliefe: &
secondly because it is situated in a Territory that is by
Nature mounted aloft, hauing a very good ayre, and of
greate safetie: for it cannot be forced. By the chiefe
common high way, that goeth vp to the Citie, and




looketh towardes the Sea, being distant from thence
150. Miles (as hath bene told you) which way is very
large and competent, though it go somewhat about
incompasse, you shall ascende (fiue Myles from the
bottom to the toppe of the Mountayne.
 At the foote
thereof on the East syde there runneth a Riuer, where∣vnto
the women doe descend by the space of a myles
walke to washe their clothes.
 In diuerse other partes
thereof there are sundry valleyes planted & manured:
neyther do they suffer any part of the countrey there∣aboutes
to be left vntilled or vnvsed, because it is the
countrey where the Court remaineth.


The Cittie is seated in a corner or angle of the hill
towards the 
Southeast,
 which 
Don Alfonso
 the first chri∣stian
king did compasse about with walles, and gaue
vnto the 
Portingalles
 a seuerall place for themselues,
 shut
vp likewise within walles. Then did he also inclose his
owne pallace and the Kinges howsen with another
wall, and in the middest betweene these two enclosures
left a great space of ground where the principal Church
was built,
 with a faire market place before it. The
doores and gates aswell of the lodginges of the Lords,
as of the 
Portingalles
 inhabitations, do open on the side
of the said Church. For in the vppermost ende of the
market place do diuers great Lords of the Court dwel,
and behinde the Church doeth the market place runne
into a narrow street, where there is also a gate, and be∣yond
that gate many houses towardes the 
East.
 With∣out
these walles, (which do inclose the kinges houses,
and the Cittie of the 
Portingalles)
 there are a number
of other buildinges, erected by diuers Lordes, e∣uery
man making his seuerall choice of the place




which he thinketh most fit & conuenient for his dwel∣ling
neere vnto the Court. So that the greatnes of
this Citie cannot well be determined or limited. Be∣yond
these walles also, that thus do compasse this Cit∣ty;
there is a great champaigne plaine, full of villages,
and sundry pallaces, where euery Lorde possesseth (as
it were) a whole Towne within him selfe. The circuite
of the 
Portingalles
 cittie contayneth about a mile: and
the kings housen as much. The walles are very thick:
the gates are not shutte in the night time, neyther is
there any watch or ward kept therein.


And although that plaine doeth lie verie high &
aloft,
 yet is there great aboundance of waters in it, so
that there is no want thereof. But the Court and the

Portingalles
 Cittie do al drinke of a certaine fountaine,
that springeth continually, towardes the 
North,
 and
lyeth downe the hill, as farre as a Gunne will shoote:
And from hence they doe fetch all their water, and
bring it to the Cittie in vesselles of wood, of earth and
of leather, vpon the backes of their slaues.


All this plaine is very fruitfull,
 and well manured:
It hath meadowes full of grasse, and trees that are al∣wayes
greene. It beareth sundrie sortes of graine, but
the principall and beste of all is called 
Luco,
 which
is very like to 
Mustardseede,
 but that it is somewhat big∣ger.
When it is grinded with 
Hand-Quernes
 (for so
they vse to doe) it yeeldeth a very white meale, where∣of
they make bread, that is both white, and also of a ve∣ry
good sauour, and holesome withall: neyther doth
it giue place to our wheat in any sort, sauing that they
doe not celebrate the 
Sacramente
 with it. Of these
graines there now is great store ouer all the Kingdom




of 
Congo:
 but it is not long since that this seede was
brought thether from that parte of the riuer 
Nilus,

where it falleth into the second 
Lake.
 There is also a
white kinde of 
Millet,
 called the 
Mazza
 of 
Congo,
 that
is to say, 
the Corne of Congo:
 and another graine which
they call 
Maiz,
 but they make no account of it, for they
giue it to their hogges: neyther doe they greatly e∣steeme
of 
Rice.
 The foresaid 
Maiz
 they commonly
terme by the name of 
Mazza-Manputo,
 that is to say,
the 
Portingalles Corne:
 for they call a 
Portingall Man∣puto.


There are moreouer diuerse and sundry sortes of
trees,
 that beare very great store of fruites, insomuch as
the greattest parte of the people doe feede vppon the
fruites of the Countrey, as 
Citrons, Limons,
 and special∣ly

Orenges,
 very ful of liquour, which are neither sweet
nor sower, & are ordinarily eaten without any annoy∣ance
or harme at all. And to shewe the fruitfulnesse
of this countrey, the said 
Signor Odoardo
 reported, that
hee had seene from a kernell of the fruit of a 
Pome-Citrone,

which was leaft within the rinde thereof, there
spronge vp within the space of fower daies a prettie
tall sprigge. Other fruites there are, which they call

Banana,
 and we verily thinke to be the 
Muses
 of 
Aegypt

and 
Soria,
 sauing that in those countreyes they growe
to be as bigge as trees, but here they cut them yearely,
to the end they may beare the better, The fruit is ve∣ry
sweet in smell, and of good nourishment. In these
plaines there growe likewise sundry kindes of 
Palme-trees:

one that beareth 
Dates,
 and another that beareth
the 
Indian Nuttes,
 called 
Coccos,
 because they haue with∣in
them a certaine shell, that is like to an 
Ape:
 and




therevpon they vse in 
Spaine
 to shewe their children a

Coccola
 when they wold make them afraide. Another
Palme tree there groweth also very like to the former,
but of a more straunge and singular property: For it
yeeldeth 
Oyle,
 
Wyne, Vineger, Fruite,
 and 
Breade.
 The

Oyle
 is made of the Shale of the fruite, and is of the co∣lour
and substance of butter, sauing that it is somewhat
greenishe. They vse it, as other people do vse 
Oyle

and butter, and it will burne like oile. They annoint
their bodies withall, and besides it is very good to eate.
They presse it out of the fruite, as oyle is pressed out of
the 
Oliues,
 and then they boyle it, and so preserue it.
The bread is made of the stone of the fruit it self,
 which
is like to an 
Almond,
 but somewhat harder: and within
the same is there a certaine kernell or pith, which is
good to eate: very holesome and of good nourish∣ment.

The whole fruit, together with the vtter shale
is greene, and they vse to eate it both raw and rosted.
The Wine is drawen from the toppe of the tree,
 by
making a hole therein, from whence there distilleth a
liquor like milke, which at the first is sweet, but after∣wardes
sowre, and in processe of time becommeth ve∣ry

Vineger,
 to serue for sallets. This wine they drinke
colde, and it moueth to vrine very much: so that in
those countries, there is not a man that is troubled
with grauell or stone in the bladder. It will make them
drunke, that drinke too much of it: but in deede it is of
a very good nutriment.


There are other trees, that beare a certaine fruite
called 
Cola,
 as bigge as a 
Pyne-apple,
 which hath within
it other fruites like 
Chest-nuttes,
 wherein are foure seue∣rall
shales or skinnes, of redde and Carnation colour.
















These they vse to holde in their mouthes, and chawe
them, and at last to eate them, for the quenching of
their thirst, and better relishing of their water. They
comforte and preserue the stomacke, but aboue all
other qualities they are singular good against the
diseases of the liuer. And it is saide, that the liuer of
a 
Henne
 or of any other like birde, which is putrified
and stinketh, being sprinkled ouer with the matter of
this fruit, returneth into his former estate, and becom∣meth
fresh and sounde againe. This foode is com∣monly
and generally vsed among them all, and there is
very great aboundance of it: and therefore it is good
cheape.
 Other kindes of wilde 
Palme-trees
 there are,
which yeeld diuers fruites that are eaten: and their
leaues reserued to make mattes, wherewith their hou∣ses
are couered, and baskets and skeppes, and such other
like instrumentes,
 that are necessary for their dayly v∣ses.
Other trees there are likewise, called 
Ogheghe
 which
beare a fruit which is like a yellow 
Plumme,
 and is very
good to eate, and hath a very sweete smell withall.
Of these trees they cut off the bowes, and plant them so
thicke together, that they touch one another, and stand
closely all in a ranke, so that when they are growen
great, they make a strong fense or wall about their hou∣sen,
which being afterwardes couered with mattes, it
resembleth a handsome Court or closse, wherein they
vse to walke, (as it were) in an arbour that maketh
a great shaddow, and defendeth them from the heate
of the Sunne. In the middest of these enclosures they
vse to build certaine housing of woode, couered with
straw, & diuided into sundry conuenient rooms, all on
the ground without any stories or Sollers aboue them:




These they do line with very faire and delicate mattes,
and furnish them with other ornaments in very hand∣some
manner.


Wherein you must note that they doe not
builde thus rustically and shephearde-like for
want of stuffe to builde withal.
 For in the moun∣taines
of the Realme of 
Congo,
 there are a number of
places, that yeelde most exquisite fine stone of diuers
kindes: From whence you may digge out whole pil∣lers,
and principalles, & Bases, and other peeces as big
as you list, if ye be disposed to build. Insomuch as it
hath beene confidently affirmed, that there are to bee
found among them many masses and lumpes of stone,
which are of such thicknesse and hugenesse, that you
may cut out a whole Church, euen of one whole
peece, yea and of the same kinde of stone, whereof
the 
Obelisco
 is made, that is erected before 
Portadel Po∣polo

in 
Rome.
 Besides this, there are whole Mountains
of 
Porphyrie,
 of 
Iasper,
 and of white Marble, and of
other sundry colours, which here in 
Rome
 are called

Marbles of Numidia,
 of 
Africa,
 and of 
Aethiopia:
 cer∣taine
pillers, whereof you may see in the Chappell of

Pope Gregorie.
 Other Stone there is, that is speckled
with graines or strakes, but among all the rest, that kind
is most admirable, which hath in it faire 
Iacinthes,
 that
are good iewelles. For the strakes being dispearsed
like vaynes ouer all the bodie of their 
Mother-Stone,
 if
you shall diuide them and plucke them out as you
would picke the kernels out of a 
Pomegranate,
 they wil
fall into graines and little peeces of perfect 
Iacynth:
 But
if you please to make pillers, or 
Obeliskes,
 or other such
like Memorialles, of the whole Masse, you shall see




them shine and sparkle, full of most faire and goodly
iewels. There are also other kinds of rare stones, which
make a shew of mettell in them, as of 
Copper,
 and of sun∣dry
other colours, that are very fresh, and bright, and
smooth, whereof you may make Images, or any other
worke of singular beautie. And therefore it is not the
scarcitie of matter or stuffe, that is the cause of this
their simple building, seeing that their mountains haue
such plenty of the foresaid stone, yea and perhaps more
store of other kindes, then is to be founde in any other
place of the whole worlde,
 besides lime, and trees for
beames, and cattell both for carryage and drawing in
the cart, and all other manner of prouision, that is re∣quisite
for building. True it is in deede, that they
want Masons, & Cutters, and Plaisterers, and Carpen∣ters,
and other such artificers: for when the Churches,
and the walles, and the other fabrickes in those coun∣tries
were built, the workemen were brought thether
out of 
Portingall.


There are also 
Tamarindes,
 and 
Cassia,
 and 
Ceders
 in
such multitudes growing all along the Riuer of 
Congo,

besides other trees of an vnmeasurable length and
thicknesse, that an infinite number of shippes and hou∣ses
may be builded of them. Their gardens do beare
all manner of hearbes and fruites,
 as 
Pompions, Melions,
Cocombres, Colewortes,
 and such like, besides other sorts
that doo not agree with our 
Climates
 of 
Europe.








Chap. 2.
Of the Originall beginning of Christendome in the
Kingdome of Congo, and how the Portin∣galles
obtained this trafficke.


T
He K. of 
Portingal Don Giouanni

the secōd,
 being desirous to di∣scouer
the 
East Indies,
 sent forth
diuers ships by the coast of 
A∣frica

to search out this Nauiga∣tion,
who hauing founde the

Islands
 of 
Capo Verde,
 and the Isle
of Saint 
Thomas,
 and running all
along that coast, did light vpon the Riuer 
Zaire,
 wher∣of
we haue made mention before, and there they had
good trafficke, and tryed the people to bee very cour∣teous
and kinde. Afterwards he sent fourth (for the
same purpose) certaine other vesselles, to entertaine
this trafficke with 
Congo,
 who finding the trade there
to be so free and profitable, and the people so frendly,
leaft certaine 
Portingalles
 behinde them, to learne the
language,
 and to trafficke with them: among whom
one was a Masse-priest. These 
Portingalles
 conuersing
familiarly with the Lorde of 
Sogno,
 who was vncle to




the King, and a man well stroken in yeares, dwelling
at that time in the Port of 
Praza
 (which is in the mouth
of 
Zaire)
 were very well entertained and esteemed by
the Prince, and reuerenced as though they had beene
earthly 
Gods,
 and descended downe from heauen into
those Countries. But the 
Portingalles
 told them that
they were men as themselues were, and professors of

Christianitie.
 And when they perceyued in how great
estimation the people held them, the foresaide 
Priest
 &
others beganne to reason with the Prince touching the
Christian religion, and to shew vnto them the errors of
the Pagan superstition,
 and by little and little to teach
them the faith which wee professe, insomuch as that
which the 
Portingalles
 spake vnto them, greatly pleased
the Prince, and so he became conuerted.


With this confidence and good spirit, the prince
of 
Sogno
 went to the Court, to enforme the King of the
true doctrine of the Christian 
Portingalles,
 and to en∣courage
him that he would embrace the Christian Re∣ligion
which was so manifest, and also so holesome for
his soules health. Herevpon the king commanded
to call the Priest to Court, to the end he might himself
treat with him personally,
 and vnderstand the truth of
that which the Lord of 
Sogno
 had declared vnto him.
Whereof when he was fully enformed, he conuerted
and promised that he would become a Christian.


And nowe the 
Portingall
 shippes departed from

Congo,
 and returned into 
Portingall:
 and by them did
the King of 
Congo
 write to the King of 
Portingall, Don
Giouanni
 the second, with earnest request, that he would
send him some Priestes, with all other orders and ce∣remonies
to make him a Christian. The Priest also




that remayned behind, had written at large touching
this busines, and gaue the King ful information of all
that had happened,
 agreeable to his good pleasure.
And so the King tooke order for sundry religious per∣sons,
to be sent vnto him accordingly, with all orna∣ments
for the Church and other seruice, as 
Crosses
 and

Images:
 so that hee was throughly furnished with all
thinges that were necessary and needefull for such an
action.


In the meane while the Prince of 
Sogno
 ceased not
day and night to discourse with the Portingall priest,

whom he kept in his owne house, and at his owne ta∣ble,
aswell that hee might learne the Christian faith
himselfe, as also instruct the people therein: so that he
began to fauour christianitie with all his power. And
forasmuch as the Christian Religion had nowe taken
roote and begun to bud in those Countries, and for
that both the people, & also the king himselfe did con∣tinue
in their earnest desire to purge themselues from
that abhominable superstition, he did instantly deale
with the Priest, that he wold proceed in the sowing &
dispearsing of the Christian doctrine, as much as hee
could. And in this good affection did they wait for
the 
Portingall
 shippes, that shoulde bring them all pro∣uision
for baptisme; and other thinges therevnto ap∣pertayning.


At the last the shippes of 
Portingall
 arriued with the
expected prouisions (which was in the yeare of our
saluation 1491) and landed in the port which is in the
mouth of the Riuer 
Zaire.
 The Prince of 
Sogno
 with
all shewe of familiar ioy, accompanied with all his
gentlemen ran downe to meete them, and entertained




the 
Portingalles
 in most courteous manner, and so con∣ducted
thē to their lodgings. The next day following
according to the direction of the Priest that remayned
behinde,
 the Prince caused a kinde of Church to bee
builded, with the bodies and braunches of certayne
trees, which he in his owne person, with the helpe of
his seruantes, most deuoutly had felled in the woode.
And when it was couered, they erected therein three
Altars, in the worshippe and reuerence of the most ho∣ly

Trinitie,
 and there was baptised himselfe and his
young sonne, himselfe by the name of our Sauiour, 
E∣manuel,

and his child by the name of 
Anthonie,
 be∣cause
that Sainte is the Protector of the Cittie of

Lisbone.


Now if any man here demande of me, what names
the people of these Countries had,
 before they recey∣ued
Christianitie: of a truth it will seeme incredible
that I must answere them, that is to say, that the men
and women had no proper names agreeable to reaso∣nable
Creatures, but the common names of Plantes, of
Stones, of Birdes and of Beastes. But the Princes &
Lordes had their denominations from the places and
states which they gouerned. As for example the fore∣said
Prince, which was the first Christian in 
Congo,
 was
called 
Mani-Sogno,
 that is to say, the 
Prince of Sogno,
 &
when hee was christened, was called 
Emanuel,
 but at
this day they haue all in generall such Christian names
as they haue learned of the 
Portingalles.


After a Masse was celebrated and songe,
 one of the
Priestes that came from 
Portingall
 went vp, and made
a briefe Sermon in the 
Portingall
 language, declaring
the summe of the new Religion, & faith of the Gospel




which they had receiued. This sermon, the Priest
that was left behinde, hauing nowe learned the 
Congo

speech, did more at large expounde to the Lords that
were in the Church: for the church could not possibly
holde the innumerable multitude of the people that
were there gathered together,
 at the conuersion of
their Prince: who afterwardes came abroade vnto
them, and rehearsed the whole sermon, with great loue
and charitie, mouing and exhorting them to imbrace
likewise the true beliefe of the Christian doctrine.


When this was done, all the 
Portingals
 put themselues
on their way towards the Court,
 to baptise the King,
who with a most feruent longing attended the same.
And the Gouernour of 
Sogno
 tooke order that many of
his Lordes should wait vpon them with Musicke, and
singing, and other signes of wonderfull reioysing, be∣sides
diuers slaues which he gaue them to carry their
stuffe, commanding also the people, that they should
prepare all manner of victuaill to be ready in the streets
for them. So great was the number of people, that
ran and met together to beholde them, as the whole
Champaigne seemed to be in a manner couered with
them, and they all did in great-kindnes entertaine and
welcome the 
Portingall Christians,
 with singing and
sounding of Trompets, and Cimballes, and other in∣strumentes
of that Countrey. And it is an admirable
thing to tell you, that all the streetes and high wayes,
that reach from the Sea, to the Citty of 
Saint Sauiours,

being one hundred and fiftie miles, were all cleansed
and swept, and aboundantly furnished with all man∣ner
of victuaile and other necessaries for the 
Portingals.

In deede they do vse in those countries, when the king




or the principall Lordes go abroade, to cleanse their
waies and make them handsome: and therefore much
the rather vpon this speciall occasion, when the 
Portin∣gals,

whom they reuerenced as though they had bene
some of the old 
Heroes,
 did purchase for their King the
Iewell of Religion, and saluation of his soule, and ge∣nerally
for euery one of them the cleere knowledge of
God, and of eternall life.


Three dayes iourney from the place whence they
departed,
 they descried the kinges Courtiers, that
came to meet them, to present them with fresh victu∣ailes,
and to doe them honour: and so from place to
place they encountred other Lordes, that for the same
purpose were sent by the King to receiue the Christi∣ans,
who were the messengers and bringers of so great
a ioy. When they were come within three miles neere
to the Cittie, all the Court came to entertaine and wel∣come
the 
Portingalles,
 with all manner of pompe and
ioyfulnes, and with musicke and singing; as in those
countreyes is vsed vppon their solemnest feast-daies.
And so great was the multitude of people, which a∣bounded
in the streets, that there was neyther tree, nor
hillocke, higher then the rest, but it was loaden with
those that were runne forth and assembled to viewe
these strangers, which brought vnto them this newe
law of their saluation. The King himselfe attended
them at the gate of his pallace,
 in a Throne of estate e∣rected
vpon a high scaffold, where hee did publikely
receiue them, in such manner and sorte as the auncient
kinges of that Realme accustomed to doe, when any
Embassadours came vnto him, or when his tributes
were paied him, or when any other such Royall cere∣monies




were performed.


And first of all, the Embassador declared the Embas∣sage
of the King of 
Portingall,
 which was expounded
and interpreted by the foresaid Priest, that was the
principall authour of the conuersion of those people.
After the embassage was thus deliuered,
 the King ray∣sed
himselfe out of his seate, and standinge vpright
vppon his feete, did both with his countenaunce and
speech shew most euident signes of the great ioy, that
he had conceyued for the comming of the Christians,
and so sate downe againe.
 And incontinently all the
people with shouting, and sounding their trumpets, &
singing, and other manifest arguments of reioycing,
did approue the kinges wordes, and shewed their ex∣ceeding
good liking of this Embassage. And further
in token of obedience, they did three times prostrate
themselues vpon the grounde, and cast vp their feete,
according to the vse of those kingdomes, thereby al∣lowing
and commending the action of their king, and
most affectionately accepting of the Gospell, which
was brought vnto them from the Lorde God by the
handes of those religious persons.


Then the king tooke view of all the presentes that
were sent him by the King of 
Portingall,
 and the 
Ve∣stimentes

of the 
Priestes,
 and the Ornamentes of the

Altar,
 and the 
Crosses,
 and the 
Tables,
 wherein were de∣painted
the 
Images
 of 
Saintes,
 and the 
Streamers,
 and
the 
Banners,
 and all the rest, and with incredible atten∣tion,
caused the meaning of euery one of them to bee
declared vnto him, one by one. And so withdrewe
himselfe, and lodged the 
Embassadour
 in a pallace
made ready of purpose for him, and all the rest were




placed in other houses of seuerall Lordes, where they
were furnished with all plentie and ease.


The day following the King caused all the 
Por∣tingalles

to bee assembled together in priuate:
 where
they deuised of the course that was to be taken for the
christening of the king, and for effecting the full con∣uersion
of the people to the christian faith. And af∣ter
sundry discourses, it was resolued and concluded,
that first of all a 
Church
 shoulde be builded, to the end
that the christening, and other ceremonies therevnto
belonging, might be celebrated therein with the more
solemnity: and in the meane while the king and the
Court should be taught and instructed in the 
Christi∣an
Religion.
 The king presently commaunded, that
with all speed prouision should be made of all manner
of stuffe necessary for this building, as 
Timber, Stone,
Lime
 and 
Bricke,
 according to the direction and ap∣poiutment
of the 
Worke-maisters
 and 
Masons,
 which
for that purpose were brought out of 
Portingall.


But the 
Deuill
 who neuer ceaseth to crosse all good
and holy proceedinges, raysed new dissentions, and
conspiracies, and lettes against this promoting of the

Christian Faith,
 which in deede began to ouerthrowe,
and destroy the power that hee had long helde in that
Realme, and in steed thereof to plant the most health∣full
tree of the 
Crosse,
 and the worship of the 
Gospell.

And this hee did by procuring a rebellion among cer∣taine
people of the 
Anzichi,
 and of 
Anzicana,
 which
dwell vpon both the bankes of the Riuer 
Zaire,
 from
the foresaid falles vpwardes, to the great 
Lake,
 and are
subiect and belonging to the King of 
Congo.
 Now this
monstrous Riuer being! restrained and kept backe by




these falles, doeth swell there mightily, and spreadeth
it selfe abroade in a very large and deepe channell. In
the breadth whereof there are many 
Islandes,
 some
small and some great, so that in some of them, there
may be maintayned about thirtie thousande persons.
In these 
Islandes
 and in other places adioyninge to the
riuers thereaboutes, did the people make an insurrecti∣on,
and renounced their obedience to the king, and
slew the Gouernours that hee had sent thether to rule.


And all this was done by the 
Deuill,
 of purpose to
interrupt the propagation of Christianity, which was
now begunne, and to hinder it by the meanes of this
rebellion. But the King, by the inspiration of God,
prouided a good remedy for this mischiefe, and sent
thether his eldest sonne,
 called 
Mani-Sundi,
 within
whose Prouince that countrey lyeth. And yet after∣wardes
the trouble and tumult fell out to be so great &
daungerous, that the king must needes go himselfe in
person to pacifie these broyles: howbeit hee resolued
to be baptised before his going, and so was enforced to
forbeare the building of the 
Church
 of 
Stone,
 and with
all speed in steed thereof to erect one of timber, which

Church
 hee in his owne person with the aduice of the

Portingalles,
 did accomplish in such manner and sort as
it ought to be, and therein did receiue the 
Sacrament

of holy 
Baptisme,
 and was named 
Don Giouanni,
 and his
wife 
Donna Eleonora,
 after the names of the king and
Queene of 
Portingall,
 and the Church it selfe intituled
and dedicated to S. 
Sauiour.


But here it is to be noted, that all these stirs and re∣bellion
of the people aforesaide, arose by the cunning
sleight & instigation of the Deuill, & not of the poore




soules themselues, that dwell in those 
Islandes
 of the

Great Lake:
 (as it is written in the first booke of the hi∣stories
of the 
Indies
 lately set forth in latine). For the

Lake
 is distant from the confines of the Cittie of 
Congo,

about two hundred miles, neyther had the inhabitants
thereaboutes any knowledge of 
Congo,
 but onely by
hearesay in those dayes, and very little they haue of it
as yet, at this day. And besides that, the booke is
faultie in the name of that people that rebelled: for
it calleth them 
Mundiqueti,
 whereas in deede the 
Por∣tingalles

do rightly call them 
Anziqueti.


The same day, wherein the king was baptised, di∣uers
other Lords following his example were baptised
likewise,
 hauing first learned certaine principles of the

Christian Fayth.
 And when all this was done, the kinge
went in person to dispearse the turbulent attemptes of
his aduersaries, against whom he found the Prince his
sonne, and the Lorde of 
Batta
 already fighting with a
formall Armie. But at the arriual of the king, the ene∣mies
yeelded, and submitted themselues to the obedi∣ence
which before they performed: and so he returned
in triumph to the Cittie of 
Congo,
 and the Prince his son
with him, who presently was desirous to become a

Christian,
 and was christened by the name of the first
Prince of 
Portingall,
 called 
Alfonso:
 and with him also
were christened many gentlemen and 
Caualieros,
 and
other of his seruantes, that came with him out of his
Prouince.


But see the 
Deuill
 once againe, the vtter enemy of

Christian Religion,
 howe hee prosecuted his former in∣tent
to hinder 
Christianitie
 among these people. For
when hee perceyued that hee preuayled nothing by




these wars, he incensed the mind of the 
Kings second Son,

that hee woulde not agree to receiue the new 
Keligion

which his 
Father,
 his 
Mother,
 his 
Brother
 so many o∣ther
Lords had imbraced, sowing his Cockle & Darnel
not onely in him, but also in many other Lordes that
fauoured him, who being addicted rather to the sen∣sualitie
of the flesh, then the puritie of the minde, resi∣sted
the Gospel, which beganne now to be preached,
especially in that Commaundement, wherein it is for∣bidden
that a man should haue any mo wiues but one.
A matter that among them was more harde and diffi∣cult
to be receyued, then any other Commandement
whatsoeuer, because they were vsed to take as many
wiues as they would. And thus the two brethren
being diuided betweene themselues, eyther of them
did stiffly maintaine his seuerall opinion. The eldest
brother 
Don Alfonso,
 did with great feruencie, defende

Christianitie,
 & burned all the 
Idoles
 that were with∣in
his Prouince. The second brother (called 
Mani-Pango,

because he was Gouernour of the Countrey of

Pango)
 did resist it mightely, and had gotten the great∣est
part of the principall Lordes of 
Pango
 to bee on his
side. For there were diuers of the newe christned
Lordes, whose Ladies seeing themselues seperated, and
forlorne of their 
Husbande-Lordes
 by force of the 
Chri∣stian
Lawe,
 did take it as a great iniury and scorne done
vnto them, and blasphemed and cursed this new Reli∣gion
beyond all measure. These Lords vnited them∣selues
together with others,
 and began to plot treache∣ry
against 
Don Alfonso,
 hoping that if they could ridde
him out of the world, the Christian Faith would vtter∣ly
cease of it selfe. And therefore 
Mani-Pango
 and




his complices gaue intelligence to his Father, that the
Prince 
Don Alfonso
 fauoured the Christian faction, one∣ly
to the end that vnder the colour of his countenance
and fauour they might rayse an insurrection and rebel∣lion
against him, and so driue him out of his king∣dome.


The king gaue credite to their informations,
 and
depriued his sonne of the Gouernement wherein hee
was placed: But the prouidence of God which reser∣ued
him for a greater matter, did relieue him by the
good mediation and counsell of his frendes, who en∣treated
the 
King
 his Father, that he would not be mo∣ued
to anger, before he had examined the answeres &
reasons of the Prince his sonne. Wherein the Kinge
was especially perswaded by 
Mani-Sogno,
 who (as we
tolde you) was before christened,
 and called 
Don Ema∣nuel,

and by good happe was in Court at that present.
This man (being the auncientest 
Courtier
 and Lorde
of that time, singularly well beloued of the king and
all his people) did with sound reasons and dexterity of
wit, procure the king to reuoke the sentence that was
giuen against the Prince 
Don Alfonso,
 so that the Kinge
being afterwardes throughly informed both of the ho∣nest
mind and actions of his sonne, perceiued that the
accusations plotted against him, were false and malici∣ous,

and therevpon restored him againe to his former
gouernement, with a speciall charge, that hee shoulde
not proceed with such rigour against the Gentiles, for
the propagation & exaltation of the christian Religion.
But he being full of feruent charity, and godly spirit,
ceased not (for all that) to aduance the faith of the 
Go∣spell,

and to put the commandements of God in execu∣tion.






Wherevpon his aduersaries who neuer rested from
their former attempt, were continually at the Kinges
elbowe, and sought by all cunning shifts and secret de∣uises,
to destroy that which the good prince had build∣ed,
especially when they saw that the Prince of 
Sogno

was departed from Court, and returned into his Go∣uernement.
So that no body being now leaft to pro∣tect
& defend the 
Christian Religion,
 the King began
to doubt of the faith, which with so great zeale he had
before embraced: and therefore sent to his sonne, that
he should come againe to the Court, to make account
of those 
Reuenues
 that hee had gathered within the
Countrey of his Gouernement, with a full intent and
meaning indeed to depriue him, when his accountes
shoulde be finished. But hee being illumined by his
good 
Angell,
 and discouering the treacheries of the e∣nemies
of God and himselfe, delayed and delayed the
matter so long, that in the meane while, his Father be∣ing
an old man,
 did by meanes of a naturall infirmity
departe out of this life. And his mother who alwaies
perseuered constant in the 
Catholicke Faith,
 louinge
her eldest sonne most entirely, concealed the Kinges
death for the space of three daies, being therein aided
and assisted by some of her trustie frendes, and gaue it
out, that the King had taken such order as no man
might come vnto him to trouble him. In the meane
season she did secreatly signifie to her Sonne the death
of his father, which she would keepe close till his com∣ming,
and charged him without any delay, and in all
haste to speede him to the Court. This she did by
certaine 
Runners,
 that from place to place in conueni∣ent
















distaunces and iourneyes, are alwayes readie like

Postes
 to conueigh the precepts and commandements
of the King ouer all the Realme. Wherevpon he pre∣sently
caused himselfe to be carryed 
Post
 both day and
night, by certaine slaues according to the vse of that
Countrey, and in one day and two nightes, with most
exquisite diligence accomplished the iourney of two
hundred miles, and so arriued at the Cittie, before he
was expected.






Chap. 3.
Don Iohn, the first Christian King being dead, Don Alfonso
his sonne succeeded. Of his warres against his Bro∣ther.
Of certaine miracles that were wrought,
and of the Conuersion of those
people.


N
Ow together with the death of
the king,
 there was also published
the succession to the 
Crowne
 of

Don Alfonso,
 being then present,
who in his owne person did ac∣companie
the corps of his deade
Father to the buriall, withall the
Lords of the Court, and all the Christian 
Portingalles,





which was solemnised after the manner of Christen∣dome,
with seruice and prayers for the dead, and all
this with such funerall pompe, as was neuer seene be∣fore
among those people. But they which hereto∣fore
were aduersaries to this newe King, doubting of
their owne safetie if they should remaine in the Court,
vnited themselues with 
Mani-Pango,
 who was nowe
departed into the Prouince of his owne Gouernment,

and while his father liued, was wholly employed in
fighting against the 
Mozombi,
 and certaine other peo∣ple
that had rebelled against him. When he heard
of the death of his Father, and vnderstoode that his
brother was already placed in the 
Seate Royall,
 he tooke
truce with his enemies, and gathering together a great
armie beganne to go in armes against his Brother, and
lead with him almost all the whole Realme, which in
deed fauoured him, to the number of two hundred
thousande men. King 
Alfonso
 awaited his comming
at the 
Royall Cittie,
 with a very small number, sauing
that he was directed, aduised and assisted by the good
auncient Lord 
Mani-Sogno,
 who vniting himselfe vn∣to
him in the strength and vertue of the holy 
Christian
Faith,
 and making a list of all those armed frends, that
he had to defend him against so great an enemy, found
by computation that they did not amount to the num∣ber
of ten thousand, among which there were but a∣bout
one hundred Christians, naturall of that Coun∣trey,
besides some few 
Portingalles,
 which by chance
arriued there at that time.


All these people were indeed too few for such an
encounter, and therefore not very resolute to abide a∣ny
attempt, but became very doubtfull and timorous,




by reason of the great power, that 
Mani-Pango
 brought
with him. But the king trusting confidently in his
strong faith, and in the Celestiall aide and assistance:
comforted and strengthened his souldiers by all the
meanes he could, and so did the good olde Lorde his
vncle, who ceased not, both night and day, with words
and deeds to encourage that smal number, which they
had, to expect and endure the assaults of their aduersa∣ries,
with all manhoode and courage, assuring them,
that God would bee their helpe and succour. Thus
while they attended the procedinges of their enemies,

Mani-Pango
 and his forces set forwardes to the be∣sieging
of the Cittie, with so great a noise of warlicke
instrumentes, and cries, and shoutinges, and terrible
threatninges, that the poore fewe, which were in the
Cittie, aswel Christians as others, fainted in their harts,
and failed in their courage, and came and presented
themselues before the king, saying, that hee had not
power enough to resist so power-full an enemie, and
therefore they thought it better for him to growe to
some concorde and composition, and to abandon the
new 
Religion,
 which hee had lately begun to professe,
to the ende hee might not fall into the handes of his
cruell aduersaries.
 But the king being resolute, and
full of religious constancie, reproued their cowardise,

and called them dastardes, and base people, and willed
them, if they had any mind or desire to forsake him, &
go to the enemie, that they should so doe: As for him∣selfe
and those few that would follow him, hee did not
doubt but assuredly trust, though not with the possibi∣litie
or strength of man, yet with the fauour of God, to
vanquish and ouercome that innumerable multitude.




And therefore he would not request them eyther to
ioyne with him, or to put their liues in hazarde against
his aduersaries for his sake, but onely they might rest
themselues and expect the issue that shoulde followe
thereon.


But they for all this speech became neuer a whit the
more couragious,
 but rather waxed more timorous, &
were vtterly determined to forsake the king, and to
saue themselues. Now they were scarse out of the
Cittie, and on their way homewardes, when by great
good fortune, they met with the good old Lord 
Mani-Sogno,

who with some few of his followers had beene
abroade to surueigh the enemies Campe,
 and to make
prouision for such thinges as were necessary in such an
action: To him they declared all that they had before
declared to the King, 
That they thought it to bee a point
of expresse madnesse, to put their liues and goods in daunger
with so fewe people against an infinite multitude, and that
without all doubt it were a safer way to compounde with the
enemie, and so saue themselues.
 The good Lorde with
great pietie and Christian valour aunswered them, that
they should not so quickly fall into dispaire; but (as the
king had tould them before) they should looke vpon

Iesus Christ
 the Sauiour of the worlde, whose faith and
religion they had so lately and with so great zeale gay∣ned
and purchased: who also most assuredly and vn∣doubtedly
would succour and defend those that were
his. And so entreated them, that they woulde not like
rash headed people chaunge their mindes from that
holy doctrine, which they had with such feruency of
late receyued, adding moreouer, that they had not to
fight with a straunge nation, nor with a people that




came from farre Countries, but with their owne kins∣men
and countreymen, so that they might alwaies
haue opportunity (if need so require) to yeelde them∣selues,
and in all frendship and kindnesse to bee embra∣ced.

Behold I pray you (saith 
Mani-Sogno)
 mine age
now arriued to a hundred yeares, and yet I beare armes
for the zeale and defence of the Religion that I haue
entred, and for the homage and honour that I owe to
my king. And you that are in the flower of your yeares,
do you shew your selues to be so base and feareful, and
vnfaithfull to your owne narurall king? If algates you
be not minded to fight your selues, yet incourage your
vassals and subiects, and doo not dismay them. Let
vs expect the first encounter of the enemie, and there∣vpon
we shall not want fit occasion to take some other
course and prouide for our safetie.


With these comfortable wordes,
 the Lords re∣couered
their spirites that were quailed, and returned
backe with him to seeke the king, who was in the
Church at his prayers, beseeching God to sende him
helpe and succour. They waited for him vntill he
came forth, and then kneeled downe vpon their knees
before him, requesting pardon for their fault and want
of dutie, which they had shewed vnto him being their
Prince, in that they would haue forsaken him when he
was in this extreame daunger, and promising that they
would put on a new and constant courage for the de∣fence
of him, and of the law and religion which they
had receyued, and that they would fight for the same
euen vntill death.
 But the king who perceyued well
that this comfort and helpe came from God himselfe,
first gaue him hartie thanks secretly from the bottome




of his hart, and vowed that he would sacrifice himselfe
for the maintenance of his faith and Gospell. And then
with a cheerefull countenance he saide. 
I doe beleeue
(Lord) that thy greatnes is infinite, and that thou canst
doo all thinges, and canst make of little much, and of
much little, whensoeuer it pleaseth thee. Neyther do
I any thing doubt, but that thou wilt yeeld aide to this
my weakenes, and assist the same with thine inuincible
force, so that through thy gracious fauour, with these
few and weake persons I shall become the conquerour
not onely of this armie, but also of a farre greater, if it
should come against me. And I promise thee (O my
God) besides that which I haue already spoken, that I
will all the dayes of my life promote and exalt thy
true faith, thy holy name, and thy most holesome do∣ctrine.

In testimony and memory of which his con∣fession,
he did presently cause a 
Crosse
 to bee planted, &
erected in the middest of the market place right against
the 
Church,
 which his father had builded: This 
Crosse

was of a wonderful length, for it was fourescore span
long, and the Crosse-barre in proportion aunswerable
therevnto. Nowe the eternall God, who knew the
faith from whence this vow of the good king did pro∣ceed,
vouchsafed to comfort him with a celestiall visi∣on,
which was a very cleere and admirable light. At
the shining whereof,
 hee cast himselfe vpon his knees,
and wept, and lifted vp his handes and eyes to hea∣uen,
but spake not a word, for that hee was ouercome
with teares, and sighes, and wholly rauished in spirite.
But that which he himselfe saw, was seene of no body
els, neyther woulde hee euer publish the same to any
man. All those that were in his company did euen




as he did, and for a while lost the sight of their eyes:
and by reason of that miraculous light remayned in a
traunce.
 At the last euery man lifted vp his eyes, and
perceyued that there were imprinted on him fiue

Swordes,
 very bright and cleere, which for the space
almost of an houre continued vnmoueable (as it were)
in a circle, but all they could neyther vnderstand nor
expounde what was the meaning thereof. The fiue

Swordes
 the 
King
 tooke for his armes, as is to be seene in
his 
Signet Royall,
 which hath beene vsed euer
sithence that time, yea euen by the 
Kinge
 that
nowe liueth and raigneth. The 
Crosse
 also, that
was thus planted by vowe, is to be seene in the same
place, wherein it was erected, at the front of the 
Church,

which 
Church
 was called 
Saint Crosses,
 of the 
Crosse
 there
planted, and of the miracle that there appeared. This

Crosse
 the last 
King,
 that dead is, 
Don Aluaro
 father to
the 
King
 that now is, renewed and made another of
the same bignes that the first was of, in remembraunce
of such a miracle. For the old 
Crosse
 was in time decai∣ed
and consumed, and quite fallen downe.


The aforesaid vision did greatly confirme the minds
of the Cittizens, which before were quailed, and did
wonderfully appall and fully terrifie the enemies, when
they vnderstood the news thereof.
 Notwithstanding

Mani-Pango
 sent vnto the 
King,
 & signified vnto him
and to all the rest that were with him, that if they did
not incontinently yeelde themselues, and deliuer the
Cittie vnto him, and create and sweare him for their

King,
 and withall abandon and relinquish their newe

Christian Religion,
 he would put them all to the edge
of the sworde: but if they would so do, hee woulde




freely pardon them. Herevnto the Lordes that stood
on the Kinges parte answered,
 that they were most rea∣dy
to die in defence of their 
Prince,
 and of the 
Christian
Faith.
 
But in particular the 
King
 sent him this message,
that he nothing feared his terrible threates, but rather
as his kind brother was very sory, euen from his hart, to
see that he walked in darkenes, and strayed out of the
way of light: that the kingdome did by law belong vn∣to
him, and was not fraudulently vsurped by him: And
that the 
Religion,
 which he had receyued, was assured∣ly
deliuered him from God, who no doubt woulde
protect and maintaine him therein: And withall be∣sought
him, that he would estraunge himselfe from his
false beliefe and worshipping of the 
Deuill,
 wherein he
had beene nourished and brought vp, and that he wold
be baptized, for so hee shoulde become the childe of
God, and mertie the 
Glorie Celestiall.
 Then the 
King

sent to fetch his iewelles and other rich ornamentes of
housholde, which he had at home, and the better to
encourage these Lordes, that tooke his part, hee most
graciously distributed them amongst them all: where∣with
they remayned very greatly satisfied, and bounde
themselues to prosecute his enterprise and to followe
his ensigne with a most ardent courage.


This being done, the very same night, the one halfe
almost of the base people that were in armes,
 being sur∣prised
with a very great feare did secretly flie into the

Campe
 of 
Pango,
 and hauing thus reuolted, gaue 
Mani-Pango

to vnderstand, that the 
King
 and all the rest of
his retinue were vtterly dismaied and discouraged, that
euery man was deuising with himselfe how he might
escape, & that they had none other meane to saue




themselues but onely by taking the lane that leadeth
downe to the Riuer, which (as wee haue tolde you)
was distant from the Cittie about the space of a mile.
At the end of which lane,
 betweene the Riuer and the
hill, there was a little 
Moore
 about two foot deepe on
the right hande, and on the left hand were the moun∣taines,
and the garrisons of 
Pango,
 that had besieged &
beset the hill, so that there was none other issue for
them to escape, but onely by passing ouer the 
Moore,

which was in length as farre as the shotte of an Arcu∣buse
could reach, and as much in bredth, and then to
come to the Riuer. 
Mani-Pango
 beleeuing all this,
that they had related vnto him, sent presently to stop
that passage, with planting sharpe stakes in the bottome
of the 
Moore,
 which were couered with water, to the
ende that if his enemies shoulde flie in the darke of the
night because they would not be seene, they shoulde
be all staked and taken therein. All that night he with
all his armie remayned in great ioy, and awaited the
fresh morning, that he might giue the assault vpon the
Cittie, bethinking himselfe in the meane while, what
course might be most easie and conuenient for him to
attempt the same.


But 
Don Alfonso
 on the other side, hauing con∣fessed
himselfe,
 and consulted with all the most faithful
and loyall frendes that hee had, expected his enemie,
who assuring himselfe of the victorie, and hauing now
granted all the Cittizens goodes, and all the states and
Gouernementes of the kingdome, to his great Lords a∣bout
him, very earely in the morning with a furious
violence gaue assault to the Cittie, on that side which
is towardes the 
North,
 where the great and wide plaine




restrayning it selfe into a narrow straite, entreth (as it
were) into a rounde circle, naturally compassed about
with certaine hilles, and then maketh a large way, as
broade as a man maye shoote with a Gunne, vn∣till
you come to the site or place where the Cittie
standeth, which is a little plaine of two miles compasse,
wherein (as it hath beene tolde you) the Cittie and
the 
Church,
 and the Lordes houses and the kings court
are situate. In this place did 
Don Alfonso,
 with those
few that he had with him, settle himselfe against the 
Pa∣gans,

and against his 
Enemie Brother,
 who before hee
coulde confront the Kinge, was vtterly discomfi∣ted,
dispearsed and put to flight. Wherevppon the
king perceyuing that he was ouerthrowne and driuen
to runne away, was wonderfully amazed, not know∣ing
himselfe how this matter came to passe, seeing that
he had not ioyned battel, nor fought with his enemies,
and therefore must needes thinke, that it so fell out by
some hidden and secreate meanes to him vnknowne.
Notwithstanding the day following 
Mani-Pango
 re∣turned
to the assault in the same place,
 but hee was in
the same manner once again discomfited and constrai∣ned
to flie: whereby hee knew assuredly that this his
losse and ouerthrow was not occasioned by the valour
of his enemies, but onely by some miracle. So that the
people of the Cittie mocking and scorning those 
Ido∣laters,

and taking stomacke vnto them, for these two
victories thus happened, beganne nowe to make no re∣coning
of them, and woulde with all violence haue
runne vpon them. To whome their aduersaries made
this aunswere, 
Tush you are not the men that haue thus
vanquished vs, but it was a certaine faire Lady all in




white, which with her admirable brightnesse had blinde∣ded
vs, and a Knight riding vppon a white palfrey, that
had a redde Crosse vppon his breast: and hee it was that
fought against vs, and turned vs to flight.
 Which when
the King vnderstoode, he sent to tell his brother, that
of those two, the one was a 
Virgin,
 the 
Mother
 of 
Christ,

whose faith he had embraced: and the other was S.

Iames,
 who both were sent from God to succour and
relieue him, and that if he also would become a 
Chri∣stian,

they would likewise shew great grace and fauour
vnto him.
 But 
Mani-Pango
 would not accept of this
message, but all the night following did put himselfe
in a readinesse to besiege the Cittie vpon both sides at
once, the one with one part of his Armie at the straite
aboue mentioned, and the other with another parte of
his people, himselfe in his owne person compassing
about by the lane that ascendeth from the riuer, and so
in a place vtterly vnprouided of eyther watch or ward,
he thought to attempt the victorie. Those that were
aboue at the strait did first ioyne battell, and were quite
discomfited and ouerthrowne: and 
Pango
 himselfe,
hoping to haue thrust forward on the other side, while
his enemies were wholly occupyed in defending them∣selues
at the straite, found himselfe greatly deceyued:
for his people were already put to flight by those of the
Cittie▪ who perceyuing the great noyse, that 
Pango

and his troupes made in ascending the hill on the o∣ther
side, ranne with all speed to meete with that dan∣ger,
and driuing him and all his people backe againe,
put them in disarray, and then so vexed and molested
them with such a furie of dartes and other weapons,
which they threwe among them, that 
Pango
 being o∣uercome




with feare and daunger ranne away,
 and fell
into the snares and nettes which he himselfe had layde
for the 
Christians.
 For lighting among the foresaide
stakes, he was with one of them thrust into the bodie,
and so being surprised with an euill death, he finished
his life, as it were in a rage. For you must vnderstand
that the sharpe ends of the said stakes were envenomed
with a certaine poyson,
 which taking holde of the
blood, and entring somewhat into the flesh, woulde
kill without all cure or remedy.


By this victory and death of his brother did the king
remaine in securitie and libertie, wiihout all contradi∣ction,
and then thinking with himselfe, that his peo∣ple
and subiectes were in a great doubt and quandarie,
and durst not for feare present themselues before him,
by reason of the errour that they had committed a∣gainst
him, like a good Prince hee sent to signifie vnto
them, that he would pardon their former faultes, and
receiue them into his grace and fauour. Wherevpon
they came and yeelded themselues vnto him with all
obedience,
 all sauing the 
Captaine Generall,
 whose name
was 
Mani-Bunda.
 For hee feared greatly to appeare
before the king, for very shame of his disloyaltie and
villanie: but yet at the last hee obtained his pardon,
with a certaine penance enioyned him, that he should
go and serue in the building of the 
Church:
 wherevp∣on
he became afterwardes so humble and deuout a

Christian:
 that when the King woulde haue eased him
of that trauell, he would not by any meanes giue ouer
his labour, vntill such time as all the 
Church
 was whol∣ly
built and finished.


The Kingdome being thus pacified, and all things




well established, the king 
Don Alfonso
 tooke order, that
they should presently go in hande with the fabricke of
the principall 
Church,
 called 
S. Crosses,
 which was so na∣med
of the 
Crosse
 that was there planted (as wee tolde
you before) and also because vpon the feast day of the

Holy Crosse
 the first stone was layed in the foundation
thereof. Moreouer hee commaunded that the men
should bring stones, and the weomen shoulde fetch
sand from the Riuer, for the furthering of this worke.
The king woulde needes bee the first 
Porter
 himselfe,
and vppon his owne shoulders brought the first basket
of stones, which he cast into the foundation, and the

Queene
 her basket of sande likewise, thereby giuing
an example to the Lordes and the Ladies of the Court
to do the like, and to encourage and harten the people
in so holy an action. And so this fabricke being fur∣thered
by so good worke-maisters and workemen, in
a very short time was fully finished, and therein were
celebrated 
Masses,
 and other diuine seruice, with great
solemnitie, besides a number of Lords and others that
were there baptised and christened: so that the multi∣tude
of such as came to bee partakers of the 
Holy Bap∣tisme

abounded so greatly, that there were not 
Priestes

enough to execute that office.


After this the king dispatched away the 
Portingall
Embassadour,
 who till this time had remained at the
Court, by reason of these troubles: and with him hee
sent also another 
Embassadour
 of his owne, called 
Don
Roderico,
 and diuerse others that were of kinne both to
himselfe and to his 
Embassadour,
 to the ende that they
should learne both the doctrine of the 
Christians
 in 
Por∣tingall,

and also their language, and further declare vn∣to




the King all these accidents that had happened.


Moreouer hee caused the Lordes of all his pro∣uinces
to bee assembled together in a place appoin∣ted
for that purpose,
 and there publikely signified vn∣to
them, that whosoeuer had any 
Idoles,
 or any thing
els that was contrary to the 
Christian Religion,
 he should
bring them forth and deliuer them ouer to the 
Lieuete∣nantes

of the Countrey: Otherwise whosoeuer did
not so, should be burned themselues without remissi∣on
or pardon. Which commandement was inconti∣nently
put in execution. And a wonderfull thing
it is to bee noted, that within lesse then one moneth,
all the 
Idolles,
 and 
Witcheries
 and 
Characters,
 which they
worshipped and accounted for 
Gods,
 were sent and
brought vnto the Court. And certainely the number
of these toyes was infinite: for euery man adored and
reuerenced the thing that best liked him, without any
order, or measure, or reason at all, so that there was
among them a huge multitude of 
Deuilles,
 in sundrie
straunge and terrible shapes. Many there were, that
carryed a deuotion to 
Dragons
 with winges, which
they nourished and fed in their owne priuate houses,
giuing vnto them for their foode the best and most
costly viandes that they had. Others kept 
Serpents

of horrible figures: Some worshipped the greatest

Goates,
 they could get, some 
Tygres,
 and other most
monstrous Creatures, yea the more vncouth & defor∣med
the beastes were, the more they were honoured.
Some held in veneration certaine vncleane foules and
night-birdes, as 
Backes, Owles
 and 
Schritche-Owles,
 and
such like. To be briefe, they did choose for their Gods
diuers 
Snakes,
 and 
Adders,
 and 
Beastes,
 and 
Birdes,
 and





Hearbes,
 and 
Trees,
 and sundry 
Characters
 of woode and
of stone, & the figures of all these things aboue rehear∣sed,
aswell painted in colours, as grauen in woode and
in stone, and in such other stuffe. Neyther did they
onely content themselues with worshipping the saide
creatures when they were quick and aliue, but also the
very skins of them when they were dead, being stuffed
with straw.


The acte of this their adoration was performed in
diuers sortes,
 all wholly addressed and directed to ex∣presse
their humilitie, as by kneeling on their knees, by
casting themselues groueling vpon the earth, by defi∣ling
their faces with dust, by making their prayers vn∣to
their 
Idoles
 in wordes and in actions, and by offering
vnto them the best parte of the substaunce which they
had in their possession.
 They had moreouer their 
Wit∣ches,

which made the foolish people to belieue, that
their 
Idoles
 could speake: and so deceyued them: and if
any man being in sicknes or infirmitie woulde recom∣mend
himselfe vnto them, and afterwardes that man
recouered his health, the 
Witches
 woulde perswade
him that the 
Idole
 had beene angry with him, but now
was appeased and had healed him. And this is in part
that which was vsed among the 
Moci-Conghi
 concer∣ning
their 
Religion,
 before they had receiued the 
Wa∣ter

of 
Holy Baptisme,
 and the knowledge of the liuing

God.


Now the King hauing gathered together all these
abhominable 
Images,
 and put them into diuers houses
within the Cittie, and commanded, that to the same
place, where a little before hee had fought and van∣quished
his brothers Armie, euery man should bring a




burthen of woode, which grew to be a great heape, &
when they had cast into it all the said 
Idoles,
 & pictures,
and whatsoeuer els the people afore that time held for
a God, he caused fire to be set vnto them, and so vtter∣ly
consumed them. When he had thus done, he as∣sembled
all his people together, and in steed of their

Idoles
 which before they had in reuerence, hee gaue
them 
Crucifixes
 and 
Images
 of 
Saintes,
 which the 
Portin∣galles

had brought with them, and enioyned euery
Lord, that euery one in the Cittie of his owne Gouern∣ment
and Regiment shoulde builde a 
Church,
 and set
vp 
Crosses,
 as he had already shewed vnto them by his
owne example. And then he tolde them and the rest
of his people, that hee had dispatched an 
Embassadour

into 
Portingall
 to fetch 
Priestes,
 that should teach them

Religion,
 and administer the most holy and holesome

Sacraments
 to euery one of them, and bring with them
diuers 
Images
 of 
Christ,
 of the 
Virgin Mother,
 and of o∣ther

Saintes
 to distribute among them. In the meane
while hee willed them to bee of good comfort, and to
remaine constant in the faith. But they had so liuely
imprinted the same in their hartes, that they neuer
more remembred their former beliefe in false and ly∣ing

Idoles.


He ordayned moreouer, that there shoulde be three

Churches
 builded.
 One in reuerence of our 
Sauiour,

to giue him thanks for the victorie which he had gran∣ted
vnto him, wherein the Kinges of 
Congo
 doe lye bu∣ried,
and whereof the 
Cittie Royall
 tooke the name,
(for as it was tolde you before, it is called 
S. Sauiours.)

The second 
Church
 was dedicated to the 
Blessed Virgin,

the 
Mother
 of 
God,
 called 
Our Ladie of Helpe,
 in memory




of the succour which he had against his enemies: And
the thirde was consecrated to 
S. Iames:
 in honour and
remembraunce of the miracle, which that 
Saint
 had
wrought by sighting in the fauour of the 
Christians,
 &
shewing himselfe on horsebacke in the heat of the bat∣tell.


Not long after this,
 the shippes arriued from 
Por∣tingall,

with many men that were skifull in the holy
scriptures, and diuers religious 
Friers
 of the orders of

S. Frauncis,
 and of 
Saint Dominike,
 and of 
Saint Austine,

with sundry other Priestes, who with great charitie
and feruencie of spirite, sowed and dispearsed the 
Ca∣tholike
Faith
 ouer all the Countrey: which was pre∣sently
embraced by all the people of the kingdome,
who held the said 
Priests
 in so high reuerence, that they
worshipped them like 
Saintes,
 by kneeling vnto them,
and kissing their hands, and receiuing their blessing, as
often as they met them in the streetes. These 
Priestes

being arriued into their seueral Prouinces, did instruct
the people in the faith of 
Christ,
 and taking vnto them
certaine of the naturalles of the Countrey, they taught
them the true heauenly doctrine, whereby they might
the better declare the same to their owne Countrey∣men
in their owne proper language. So that in pro∣cesse
of time the 
Catholike Faith
 was rooted ouer all
those Countreyes in such sorte, as it perseuereth and
continueth there euen till this day, although it hath
endured some small hinderance, as in conuenient place
we shall shew vnto you.








Chap. 4.
The death of the King Don Alfonso, and the succession of Don
Piedro. How the Islande of Saint Thomas was first in∣habited,
and of the Bishop that was sent thether. Other
great accidents that happened by occasion of Religion. The
death of two Kings by the conspiracie of the Portingalles &
the Lordes of Congo. How the Kinges linage was quite
extinguished. The banishment of the Portingalles.


W
Hile these matters were thus in
working for the seruice of God, &
that 
Christianitie
 was nowe begun
and encreased with so happy suc∣cesse,

it pleased God to call away
to himselfe the King 
Don Alfonso,

who at the time of his death yeel∣ded
great signes, which beautified and exalted his for∣mer
life, For he dyed in great faith, declaring that
his hower was now come, and discoursed of the Chri∣stian
Religion with so great confidence and charitie, as
it euidently appeered that the 
Crosse
 and 
Passion,
 & the
true beliefe in our 
Sauiour Iesus Christ
 was imprinted
in the roote of his heart.
 To 
Don Piedro,
 his sonne &
successour he did especially & principally recommend




the 
Christian doctrine,
 which in deed following the ex∣ample
of his father, he did maintain and vphold accor∣dingly.


In his time, there began to sayle into these quarters
a great number of vessels,
 and the 
Islande
 of 
S. Thomas

was inhabited with 
Portingalles,
 by the Kinges com∣mandment.
For before those dayes it was all waste
and desert within lande, and inhabited onely vpon the
shore by a few saylers that came from the countries ad∣ioyning.
But when this 
Islande
 in processe of time was
well peopled with 
Portingalles,
 and other nations that
came thether by licence of the King, and became to
be of great trafficke, and was tilled and sowed, the king
sent thether a 
Bishoppe,
 to gouerne the 
Christians
 that
were in that 
Islande,
 and those also that were in 
Congo:

which the said 
Bishoppe
 did accomplish presently vpon
his arriuall, and afterwardes in 
Congo,
 where hee tooke
possession of his Pastorall charge. When he was come
into the kingdome of 
Congo,
 it was a thing incredible
to see,
 with howe great ioy hee was entertained by
the Kinge and all his people. For from the sea side
euen vnto the Cittie, being the space of a hundred and
fiftie miles, he caused the streetes to bee made smooth
and trimme, and to be couered all ouer with Mattes,
commanding the people, that for a certaine space seue∣rally
appointed vnto them, they shoulde prepare the
wayes in such sort, that the 
Bishoppe
 shoulde not set his
foote vpon any part of the grounde which was not a∣dorned.
But it was a farre greater wonder, to behold
all the countrey thereaboutes, and all the trees, and all
the places that were higher then the rest, swarming
with men and weomen that ran forth to see the 
Bishop,





as a man that was holy and sent from God, offering vn∣to
him, some of them lambes, some kiddes, some chic∣kins,
some 
Partriches,
 some venison, and some fish, and
other kindes of victuailes in such aboundance, that hee
knew not what to do withall, but leaft it behind him;
whereby he might well know the great zeale and obe∣dience
of these new 
Christians.
 And aboue all other
thinges it is to be noted for a memorable matter, that
the 
Bishoppe
 going on his way, there met him an innu∣merable
multitude of men, & weomen, and girles, and
boyes, and persons of fourescore yeares of age, and a∣boue,
that crossed him in the streetes, and with singu∣lar
tokens of true beliefe required the water of 
Holy
Baptisme
 at his hands: neyther would they suffer him
to passe vntill hee had giuen it them: so that to satisfie
their desires, hee was greatly stayed in his viage, and
was faine to carry water with him in certaine vesselles,
and salte, and other prouision necessary for that
action.


But I will leaue to report vnto you all the welcome
and entertainment, that was made vnto him in euery
place where he came, and the liuely ioy that generally
and particularly was shewed for the comming of this

Bishoppe.
 And now I will tell you, that hee arriued at
the Cittie of 
Saint Sauiours,
 where hee was met by the

Priestes,
 and by the king, and by all the Court, and so in
procession entred into the Church, & after due thanks
giuen to God, hee was conducted to his lodging that
was assigned vnto him by the king.
 And then present∣ly
he beganne to reforme & reduce to good order, the
Church it selfe, and the 
Friers,
 and 
Priestes
 that dwell
therein: ordayning the saide Church to bee the 
Cathe∣drall




Church
 of 
Saint Crosses,
 which at that time had be∣longing
vnto it twentie and eyght 
Cannons,
 with their

Chaplens,
 and a Mayster of the 
Chappell,
 with 
Singers,

and 
Organs,
 and 
Belles,
 and all other furniture meete
to execute diuine seruice. But this 
Bishoppe,
 who la∣boured
in the 
Lords Vineyard,
 sometimes in 
Congo,
 and
sometimes in the 
Isle
 of 
Saint Thomas,
 going and com∣ming
continually by shippe, the space of twentie daies,
and still leauing behinde him his 
Vicars
 in the place
where he himselfe was absent,
 at the last dyed, & was
buried in the 
Island
 of 
S. Thomas.


After this 
Bishoppe
 succeeded another 
Bishoppe
 in

Congo,
 being a 
Negro,
 and descended of the blood 
Roy∣all,

who before had beene sent by 
King Alfonso
 first in∣to

Portingall,
 and afterwardes to 
Rome,
 where hee lear∣ned
the 
Latine
 tongue, and the 
Christian Religion,
 but
being returned into 
Portingall,
 and landed out of
his shippe,
 to goe and enter vppon his 
Bishopricke
 of

S. Sauiours,
 hee dyed by the way: wherevpon the king∣dome
remained without a 
Pastor
 for the space of diuers
yeares. 
Don Piedro
 also the 
King
 aforesaide dyed like∣wise
without children,
 and there succeeded him his
brother, called 
Don Francesco,
 who in like manner la∣sted
but a while: and then was created the fift 
King,

named 
Don Diego,
 who was next of all the race 
Royall:

A man of haughtie courage, and magnificall, and wit∣tie,
of a very good disposition, wise in counsell, and
aboue all other qualities, a maintayner of 
Christian
Faith:
 and in briefe so great a warriour he was, that in
few yeares hee conquered all the countries adioyning.
He loued the 
Portingals
 very much, so that he forsooke
the vsuall garmentes of his owne naturall countrey, &




attyred himselfe after the 
Portingall
 fashion. He was ve∣ry
sumptuous aswell in his apparell,
 as also in the orna∣ments
and furniture of his pallace: he was besides very
courteous and liberall, and woulde bestowe largely
both vpon his owne subiectes and also vpon the 
Portin∣galles.

With great cost woulde hee prouide and buy
such stuffe as pleased him, and woulde often say, that

Rare thinges shoulde not bee in the handes of any but onely of
Kinges.
 He vsed to weare one suite of apparel but once
or twice and then he would giue it away to his follow∣ers.
Wherevpon the 
Portingalles
 perceyuing that he
did so greatly esteeme cloth of gold and Arras, & such
other costly houshold stuffe, they brought great store
therof out of 
Portingall,
 so that at that time, Arras-hang∣ings,
and cloth of gold, and of silke, and such like Lord∣ly
furniture beganne to bee of great estimation in that
kingdome.


In the time of this 
King,
 there was a thirde 
Bishop
 of

Saint Thomas,
 and 
Congo,
 by nation a 
Portingall,
 who
with the vsuall ceremonies was entertayned both by
the way,
 and also in the Court at 
Saint Sauiours.
 And
nowe the 
Deuill,
 the common enemie of 
Christian Reli∣gion,

being much grieued with the happie successe and
promoting of the 
Catholike Faith,
 beganne to sowe his

Darnell
 of diuision betweene the 
Friers
 and 
Priestes,
 and
their new 
Bishoppe:
 which sprung vp and arose from the
long libertie, wherein they had nowe liued so many
yeares without a 
Pastor,
 so that euery man esteemed
himselfe not onely to be as good as the 
Bishoppe,
 but al∣so
to be a farre better man then he was: and therefore
would yeeld no obedience to their 
Prelate,
 in such sort
that there was raysed among them so great a discord &




dissention, as it wrought a grieuous scandale and wic∣ked
example among the people. But the king like a
good 
Catholike,
 and a faithfull, did alwayes maintaine
the 
Bishops
 part, and to cut of these troubles and stirres
he sent some of these 
Priests
 to prison into 
Portingal,
 and
others into the 
Isle
 of 
Saint Thomas,
 and some others
went away with all their substaunce of their owne ac∣corde:
and by these meanes, the doctrine of these mi∣nisters,
in steede of encreasing, did greatly diminish
through their owne default,


Neyther was our common aduersaries herewithal
contented, but woulde needes proceed further by set∣ting
discorde betweene 
Kinges
 and subiectes.
 For af∣ter
the death of this 
King,
 there started vp three 
Princes

at once to challenge the succession. The first was the

Kinges
 sonne, whom fewe of them fauoured, because
they desired to haue another, so that he was slaine in∣continently.
The two other that remayned were of
the bloud 
Royall:
 One of them was created 
King
 by
his fauourites and followers, with the good lyking of
the greater parte of the people, but vtterly against the
mindes of the 
Portingalles
 and certayne of the Lordes,
who aymed and endeauoured to set vp the other. In∣somuch
as the foresaide Lordes, together with the 
Por∣tingalles,

went into the 
Church
 to kill the 
King
 elected:
making this reckoning with themselues, that if they
slewe him, the other must of necessitie bee made 
King.

But at that very selfe same time, those of the contrary
faction had slaine the 
King
 that was already made by
the 
Portingalles,
 perswading themselues assuredly, that
he being dead there would bee no difficultie for them
to obtaine the state for their 
King,
 because there was




none other least, that by law could challenge the 
Scep∣ter
Royall.
 And thus in an houre and in two seuerall
places were these two 
Kinges
 murthered at once.


In these conspiracies and slaughters, when the peo∣ple
saw,
 that there were no lawfull persons leaft to en∣ioy
the 
Royall Crowne,
 they laide all the blame vpon the

Portingals,
 who were the causers of all these mischiefes:
and therevpon they turned themselues against them,
and slew as many of them as they could finde: Onely
they spared the 
Priests,
 and would not touch them, nor
any other that dwelt in other places.


Seeing therefore (as before is saide) that there was
none of the blood 
Royal
 leaft to be placed in the 
Gouern∣ment,

they made choice of one 
Don Henrico, Brother
 to

Don Diego
 the 
King
 deceased. And this 
Henrico,
 going
to warre against the 
Anzichi,
 leaft behinde him in his
steede for 
Gouernour,
 vnder the title of 
King,
 one 
Don
Aluaro,
 a young man of twentie and fiue yeares of age,
sonne to his wife by another husband.
 But 
Don-Hen∣rico

dyed shortly after the warre was ended, and there∣vpon
the saide 
Don Aluaro
 was with the common con∣sent
of them all, elected 
King
 of 
Congo,
 and generally
obeyed of euery man. And thus fayled the 
Royall
Stocke
 of the auncient 
Kinges
 of 
Congo,
 in the person of

Don Henrico.


But 
Don Aluaro
 was a man of good iudgement and
gouernenent, and of a milde disposition, so that he did
presently appease all these tumults in his kingdome, &
caused all the 
Portingals
 that by the last warres were dis∣pearsed
ouer all the countries thereaboutes,
 to bee ga∣thered
together, aswell religious persons as lay men, &
by their meanes hee was much better confirmed in the





Catholike Faith
 then he was before. Moreouer he vsed
them very courteously, and cleared them of all faultes
that were laide to their charge, declaring vnto them by
gentle discourses that they had not beene the occasion
of the former troubles, as euery man wold confesse and
acknowledge: and to that effect he determined with
him selfe to write a large information touching al these
accidentes to the King of 
Portingall,
 and to the 
Bishoppe

of 
S. Thomas,
 which he did accordingly, and dispatched
certain 
Messengers
 vnto them with his letters. When the

Bishoppe
 of 
S. Thomas
 vnderstode these newes, he was
very glad thereof,
 and whereas before he durst not ad∣uenture
to go into the 
Kingdome
 of 
Congo
 in the heate of
all those troubles, he did now presently take ship, and
sayled thether, where he imployed himselfe wholly
with all his authoritie to pacifie the former dissentions,
and to set downe order for all such matters as concer∣ned
the worshippe of 
God,
 and the office of his 
Priestes.

And a while after hee had so done, hee returned to his
habitation in the 
Isle
 of 
Saint Thomas,
 where by meanes
of sicknes he finished his dayes. And this was the third
time, that those partes remayned without a 
Bishop.


Nowe it came to passe,
 that for want of 
Bishoppes,
 the

King
 and the 
Lordes,
 and the people likewise, began to
waxe cold in the 
Christian Religion,
 euery man addicting
himselfe licentiously to the libertie of the flesh, and e∣specially
the 
King,
 who was induced therevnto by di∣uers
yong men of his owne age, that did familiarly con∣uerse
with him.
 Among whom there was one princi∣pall
man, that was both a 
Lorde,
 and his kinsman, called

Don Francesco Bullamatare,
 that is to say, 
Catche-Stone.

This man, because he was a great 
Lorde,
 and wholly e∣stranged




from all instructions of 
Christianitie,
 walked
inordinately after his owne pleasure, and did not sticke
to defende openly, 
That it was a very vaine thing to keepe
but one wife, and therefore it were better to returne to their
former auncient custome.
 And so by his meanes did the

Deuill
 open a gate to the ouerthrowe and destruction
of the 
Church
 of 
Christ
 in that kingdome, which vntill
that time with so great paine and trauaile had beene
there established. But afterwardes the man did so wan∣der
and stray out of the way of truth, that he fell from
one sinne to another, and in the end quite relinquished
and abandoned all true 
Religion.
 Yet at the last the
said 
Francesco
 dyed, and was solemnely buried like a
noble 
Lorde,
 in the 
Churcb
 of 
Saint Crosses:
 although he
was notoriously suspected and spotted for his false 
Reli∣gion.

But it fell out (and a maruellous case it is, to
confirme the righteous in their good belief, & to terrify
the wicked) that in the night time certain 
Spirits
 of the

Deuill
 vncouered a part of the roofe of 
S. Crosses Church,

where he was enterred, and with a great and horrible
noyse, which was heard all ouer the 
Cittie,
 they drew
him out of his 
Tombe,
 and carryed him away. And
in the morning the 
Church
 doores were found shut, the
roofe broken, and the graue without the body of the
man. By this extraordinarie signe the 
King
 was at
the first aduertised of the great fault that hee had com∣mitted,
and so were the rest also that followed him in
his course: but notwithstanding, because there was no

Bishop
 in that kingdome to giue him good counsell, and
the 
King
 but a young man and vnmarried, although he
remained somewhat sound in the 
Christian Faith,
 yet
he continued still in the licentiousnes of the flesh, vntill




such time as God had chastized him with another se∣uere
discipline, as you shall hereafter vnderstand.






Chap. 5.
The incursions of the people called Giachas in the kingdome
of Congo. Their conditions and weapons. And
the taking of the Royall Cittie.


F
Or not long after,
 there came to
robbe and spoyle the Kingdome
of 
Congo,
 certaine nations, that
liue after the manner of the 
Ara∣bians,

and of the auncient 
Noma∣des,

and are called 
Giachas.
 Their
habitation or dwelling is about
the first 
Lake
 of the 
Riuer Nilus,

in a prouince of the Empyre of 
Moenemugi.
 A cruell
people they are and a murderous, of a great stature,
and horrible countenance, fed with mans flesh, fierce
in battell, and valorous in courage. Their weapons are

Pauises
 or 
Targates, Dartes
 and 
Daggers:
 otherwise they
go all naked: In their fashions and dayly course of li∣uing
they are very sauage and wilde: They haue no




King to gouerne them, and they leade their life in the
forrest vnder cabbins and cottages like shepheardes.


This people went wandring vp and downe, de∣stroying,
and putting to fire and sworde, and robbing
and spoiling all the countries that they passed through,
till they came to the Realme of 
Congo,
 which they en∣tred
on that side where the Prouince of 
Batta
 lyeth.
Those that first came forth to make resistance against
them, they ouerthrew, and then addressed themselues
towards the 
Cittie
 of 
Congo,
 where the 
King
 remained
at that time in great perplexitie, for this victorie that
his enemies had gotten in the Countrey of 
Batta:
 yet
some comfort hee tooke to himselfe, and went out a∣gainst
his aduersaries with such souldiers as he had, &
in the same place, where in times past 
Mani-Pango

fought with the 
King Don Alfonso,
 he ioyned battell
with them. In which encounter the 
King
 being halfe
discomfited, retired into the 
Cittie,
 wherein when he
perceyued that he could not remaine in good safetie,
being vtterly forsaken of the grace of God by reason
of his sinnes, and not hauing that confidence in him,
that 
Don Alfonso
 had, he thought good to leaue it for a
pray to his aduersaries, and to betake himselfe io an 
Is∣lande

within the 
Riuer Zaire,
 called 
Isola del Cauallo,
 that
is to say,
 the 
Isle of Horse,
 where hee continued with
certaine 
Portingall Priestes,
 and other principal 
Lordes

of his Kingdome.
 And thus were the 
Giachi
 become

Lords
 and maisters of the 
Cittie Royall,
 and of the whole
Realme. For the naturall inhabitants fled away, and sa∣ued
themselues in the mountains, & desert places: but
the enemies burned and wasted, 
Cittie,
 and 
Churches,
 &
all, and spared no mans life, so that hauing diuided




themselues into seuerall armies, they ruled and gouer∣ned
sometimes in one 
Prouince,
 and sometimes in ano∣ther
ouer all the kingdome.


With this persecution did God generally afflict and
chastize all the inhabitantes of the saide Kingdome of

Congo,
 the King himselfe, the 
Lordes,
 the people, the

Portingalles,
 and their 
Clergie,
 euery one in their degree,
and calling. As for the poore people, they went wan∣dring
like vagabondes ouer all the Countrey,
 and peri∣shed
for hunger and want of necessaries: And for the
Kinge with those that followed him, and had saued
themselues in the 
Islande,
 they also because the 
Isle
 was
very little, and the multitude great, were oppressed
with so terrible a scarsitie of victuailes, that the most
part of them dyed by famine and pestilence. For this
dearth so increased, and meate arose to so excessiue a
rate, that for a very small pittance (God wot) they were
faine to giue the price of a slaue, whome they were
wont to sell for tenne 
Crownes
 at the least. So that the
Father was of necessitie constrayned to sell his owne
sonne, and the brother, his brother, and so euery man
to prouide his victuailes by all manner of wickednesse.
The persons that were solde for the satisfying of other
mens hunger, were bought by the 
Portingal Marchants,

that came from 
S. Thomas
 with their ships laden with
victuailes. Those that sold them, said they were slaues,
and those that were solde, iustified and confirmed the
same, because they were desirous to be ridde of their
greedie torment.
 And by this occasion there was no
small quantity of slaues, that were borne in 
Congo,
 solde
vpon this necessitie, and sent to the 
Isle
 of 
S. Thomas,
 &
to 
Portingall,
 among whome there were some of the




bloud 
Royall,
 and some others, principall 
Lordes.


By this affliction, the King did manifestly learne &
know, that all these great miseries and aduersities a∣bounded
for his misdeedes: and although he was not
much punished with hunger,
 because hee was a King,
yet he did not escape the cruel infirmitie of the 
Dropsie,

that made his legges to swell exceedingly, which dis∣ease
was engendred partely by the ayre, and very ill
diet, and partely by the moystnesse of the 
Islande,
 and
so it accompanied him euen vntill his death. But in the
meane while, being stricken to the hart with these mis∣fortunes
and calamities, he conuerted and turned to
God, requiring pardon for his offences, and doing
pennance for his sinnes: and then was counselled and
aduised by the 
Portingalles
 that he shoulde sende to re∣quest
succours of the 
King
 of 
Portingall,
 by certayne

Embassadours,
 that might recount vnto him all the mis∣chiefes
which had lighted vpon him. This 
Embassage

was accordingly performed, at the same time that the

K. Don Sebastiano
 began his raign,
 who with great speed
and kindnesse sent him succours by a 
Captaine,
 called

Francesco di Gouea,
 a man well exercised in diuers wars,
both in 
India,
 and also in 
Africa,
 who lead with
him sixe hundred 
Souldiers,
 and many

Gentlemen Aduenturers,
 that did
accompany him.








Chap. 6.
The King of Portingall sendeth aide, and an Embassadour to
the King of Congo. The knowledge of the Mettall mines,
which abound in Congo, is denyed the King of Portingall.
At the same time the King of Congo dispatcheth Embas∣sadours
to the King of Spaine, to request Priestes of him, &
what befell vnto them. He sendeth diuers proofes of the
Mettalles. The vow of Odoardo Lopes.


T
His 
Captayne Francesco di Gouea,

carried with him a commande∣ment
from his 
Kinge,
 that the

Islande
 of 
Saint Thomas
 shoulde
prouide him ships, and victuails,
and whatsoeuer els was requi∣site
for this enterprise. And
with this prouision hee arriued
at the last in the 
Isle
 of 
Horse,
 where the 
King
 of 
Congo

was resident. In whose company the 
Portingalles
 de∣parting
from thence, & gathering together all the men
of warre in that Countrey, with all speed possible, put
themselues onwardes against their aduersaries, and
fought with them sundry times in plaine battell, so that




at the ende of one yeare and a halfe, they restored the
King into his former estate. Which victory they at∣chieued
in deede by the noyse and force of their 
Arcu∣buses

(for the 
Giachi
 are exceedingly afraid of that wea∣pon)
rather then by the valour and strength of their
souldiers. And so they were in spight of their teeth
driuen out of the Realme of 
Congo,
 & but few of them
there were that returned home againe to see their
frendes.
 But the 
Portingall Captaine
 stayed there for
the space of foure yeares to settle the King in his King∣dome,
and then returned into 
Portingall
 with letters of
request to his 
King,
 that hee woulde sende ouer some
moe 
Priestes
 to vpholde and maintaine the 
Christian
Religion.
 Howbeit a number of 
Portingalles,
 that came
by shippe with him, remained behinde him in these
Countries, and are at this daye become very rich and
wealthie men. And the King being thus established
in his former degree, and the Kingdome all in quyet
and peace, became a very good 
Christian,
 and married
the 
Ladie Catarina,
 who is yet aliue: by whom he had
fower daughters, and by certaine 
Maide-seruants
 which
he kept, two sonnes and one daughter. And because
in those regions the weomen doe not succeede: there
remayned as heyre of his kingdome his elder sonne,
called also 
Don Aluaro,
 who liueth at this day.


During the time,
 that the foresaide 
Captaine
 stay∣ed
in 
Congo,
 the 
King
 of 
Portingall Don Sebastiano
 vn∣derstanding,
that there were in that 
Kingdome
 diuers

Caues
 and 
Mines
 of 
Siluer,
 of 
Golde,
 & other 
Mettalles,

sent thether two persons that were cunning and skilful
in that Arte, (for therein they had serued the 
Castilians

in the 
West)
 to make search for them, and to drawe




some profite thereof. But the 
King
 of 
Congo
 was by
a certaine 
Portingall,
 called 
Francesco Barbuto,
 that was
his 
Confessour
 and great familiar, perswaded to the con∣trary,
that he should not in any case suffer those 
Mines

to be discouered: signifying vnto him, that thereby
peraduenture the free enioying and possession of his
Kingdome might by little and little be taken quite
from him, and therefore aduised him that he woulde
cause these skilfull Maisters to bee ledde and guided by
some other wayes, where hee knewe there were no

Mettall-Mynes
 to be founde, which he did according∣ly.
But assuredly, it grew afterwardes to a great mis∣chiefe,
that the 
King
 would not suffer this Arte of dig∣ging
and melting of mettalles,
 so greatly esteemed o∣uer
all 
Europe,
 to be exercised in 
Congo.
 For therevpon
beganne the great trade and trafficke in that Countrey
to cease, and the 
Portingall Marchants
 did not greatly
care for venturing thether, or dwelling there any
more: and so consequently very few 
Priestes
 resorted a∣mong
them. So that aswell vpon these occasions, as al∣so
for other such causes afore rehearsed, the 
Christian
Religion
 waxed so colde in 
Congo,
 that it wanted verye
little of being vtterly extinguished. But the 
King Don
Aluaro
 (as it hath beene tolde you) after all these migh∣ty
afflictions laid vpon him by the hand of God, for the
punishment of the sinnes which he had committed a∣gainst

Religion,
 had acknowledged his errour, and be∣came
a good 
Christian,
 cherishing the 
Portingals,
 whom
he called his 
Sonnes,
 and doing them all the pleasure hee
could. Especially and aboue all thinges hee ceased
not, still to sende new 
Embassadours
 into 
Portingall,
 with
earnest request that he might haue moe 
Priestes,
 and




such as were skilful in the holy Scriptures to maintaine
the 
Catholike Faith,
 which was now almost vtterly for∣gotten
in that Realme, onely for want of religious
persons, that shoulde teach the people and administer
the 
Sacramentes,
 and not for any fault of their good
willes: for they were meruellously well inclined and
affected to the 
Holy Faith.


After that the aforesaid 
Captaine
 was arriued in 
Por∣tingall,

and had presented the requestes of the 
King
 of

Congo
 to his 
King,
 (who was also but a young man)
he had none other aunswere from him but wordes and
promises, that he would haue a care of the matter that
was demanded: but in the meane while hee prouided
neyther 
Priests,
 nor 
Diuines
 to be sent for 
Congo.
 Where∣vpon
the King of 
Congo
 dispatched againe another
principall 
Embassadour,
 being his kinseman, called 
Don
Sebastiano Aluarez,
 together with a 
Portingall,
 to beare
him company and entreate for moe 
Priestes,
 and with∣all
to redeeme certaine slaues borne in 
Congo,
 that were
in the 
Isle
 of 
S. Thomas
 and in 
Portingall,
 and were sold
vpon meere necessitie, as wee haue tolde you before.
Some of them woulde needes remaine still in volunta∣rie
seruitude, and many were raunsomed and brought
home into their Countrey. By whose good labour
and meanes, and especially by the paineful industrie of
such as were 
Lords,
 & borne of noble bloud, (for some
there were of that dignitie among them,) the King of

Congo
 restored the 
Christian Religion,
 which was almost
lost: and some of them he vsed for Counsellours, and
Officers of the Realme, as men that were well practised
and experienced in the worlde, by reason of this their
long captiuitie. To this 
Embassadour,
 the 
King
 gaue a




gracious aunswere, and tolde him that hee should bee
satisfyed according to his request:
 But yet for all that,
hee was faine to returne home agayne into 
Congo,

without any 
Priestes
 or Religious persons to go with
him.


Three yeares after,
 the King 
Don Sebastiano
 dispat∣ched
a certaine 
Bishoppe
 (called 
Don Antonio de gli Oua,

being a 
Castilian
 borne) principally to the 
Islande
 of 
S.
Thomas:
 but withall he gaue him also a commission to
visite the kingdome of 
Congo:
 who being arriued at 
S.
Thomas,
 fell at iarre with the 
Captayne
 there, and so say∣led
into 
Congo,
 where hee was also persecuted by the
saide 
Captaine
 and his frendes that hee had there:
 For
they informed the 
King,
 that hee was an ambitious
man, of a haughtie spirite, and very obstinate, & there∣by
did vtterly discredite him with the King and all his
Court: Wherevpon being induced therevnto by these
accusations,
 the King forbad him at the first to enter
within his Realme, but afterwardes he receyued him
with great honour, and sent his sonne to entertain him,
and to accompany him to the Cittie. There he stayed
about eyght monethes, and then departed againe,
somewhat before the King of 
Portingall
 passed into

Africa,
 and leaft behinde him in 
Congo,
 two 
Friars,

and fower 
Priestes.
 The 
Bishoppe
 being thus gone, &
the King ouerthrowen in 
Africa,
 there was exalted to
the Crowne of 
Portingall, Don Henrico
 the 
Cardinall,

to whome the King of 
Congo
 did write, with great in∣staunce,
and earnest request; that he would send him
some religious personnes, and Preachers: but he could
obtaine nothing at his handes, because the 
Cardinall

liued but a short time in that 
Gouernement.






After 
Don Henrico
 succeeded 
Phillip King
 of 
Castile,

who sent aduertisementes to the Captain of 
Saint Tho∣mas,

that he was inuested in the Crowne of 
Portingall,

and letters also to the King of 
Congo,
 to the same effect.
Wherevpon the Captaine did presently dispatch one

Sebastiano di Costa,
 that with the title of 
Embassadour,

shoulde carry these newes and letters vnto the saide
King. When these letters were presented, and all
complementes performed,
 the king of 
Congo
 returned
him againe to the Court to king 
Phillip,
 with answere
of his letters, and therein proffered to discouer vnto
him the mettall mines, which heretofore had beene
concealed from all the other kinges his predecessors,
and withal sent him diuers trialles of them: Beseeching
him especially with all affectionate entreatie, that (as
soone as possiblie he could) hee woulde furnish him
with some store of Priestes: declaring also vnto him
the miserable state and condition, whereinto his peo∣ple
were fallen,
 by reason of the troubles that had
happened about the 
Christian Religion.
 But 
Costa
 died
by the way, the vessell wherein he sayled being cast a∣way
vpon the shore of 
Portingall,
 and euery man drow∣ned
that was in it: and the naughtie newes were know∣en
by the contentes of the Letters, that were found in a
little chest, which was driuen on land by the waues of
the sea: & by a briefe note of such Commissions, as he
had in charge to deliuer to the king.
 When the king
of 
Congo
 hearde of this accident, hee did not cease, but
still continued and perseuered in his godly purpose, &
woulde not suffer Christianitie to bee vtterly extingui∣wed
in his Kingdome, as it was very likely to be. And
therefore he determined yet once again to send a new





Embassadour
 of his owne to the 
King
 of 
Spaine.
 But
forasmuch as there arose some difficulties and differen∣ces
among some 
Lordes
 of the 
Court,
 that desired this
honour, the king because he woulde not displease any
of them, by preferring one of them before another,
made choice of one 
Odoardo Lopez
 a 
Portingall
 borne,
from whose mouth 
Pigafetta
 tooke this present report,
and put it in writing. This man had dwelt now a
good time in those Regions, and was well experien∣ced
in the affaires of the worlde, and being by good
chaunce at that time in the Court, he was thus emploi∣ed
with the good fauour and countenance of the king:
who deliuered vnto him in writing very ample instru∣ctions,
for all matters whereof hee was to treate, as
well with his 
Catholike Maiestie
 in 
Spaine,
 as also with his

Holinesse
 at 
Rome:
 together with very earnest letters of
credence, and authoritie, and commoditie to them
both, and safe conductes, and exemptions in all liber∣ties,
both within and without, besides his effectuall re∣commendations
of him to all other 
Christian Princes,

with all such other priuileges and declarations, that
might shew how dearly the king esteemed his person,
as to an 
Embassadour
 in such causes appertaineth.


The summe of his
 Embassage 
was this:
 That he should
present his Letters to the King 
Don Phillip,
 and at large
discourse vnto him the state, wherein the kingdome of 
Con∣go

stoode touching matter of Religion, by the reason of the
former warres, and scarcitie of 
Priestes,
 and therevpon re∣quest
his Maiestie to prouide him a competent number of
Confessors, and Preachers, that might bee sufficient to main∣taine
the Gospell in those remote Countries, being but lately




conuerted to Christianitie. Moreouer that he should shew
vnto him the sundrie trialles of Mettalles, which hee had
made, and many other matters, which were worthie to bee
knowen: and withall that he should proffer vnto him in his
name, free & liberal trafficke of them, which heretofore was
euer denyed to his Predecessors.
 Touching the 
Pope,
 That he
should likewise on his behalfe kisse his feete, deliuer vnto him
his letters, and recount the miserable trouble and detriment
that his people had suffered for the 
Christian Faith.
 That
he shold recōmend those poor soules to his 
Holines,
 & beseech
him as the Vniuersal Father of all 
Christians,
 to haue com∣passion
vpon so many faithful persons, who because they had no
Priestes to deliuer the holy Faith vnto them, and to admini∣ster
the wholesome 
Sacramentes,
 were by little and little
falling into euerlasting perdition. 
And being thus dis∣patched,
he departed from the Court, and went about
certaine seruices for the King, wherein he spent about
eyght Monethes: So that in
 Ianuary, 
being then
 Som∣mer

time in
 Congo, 
he embarked himselfe in a vessell of
a hundred Tunne burthen, which was bound with her
lading for
 Lisbone.


Now as he sayled, he came to the sea of the 
Islands

of 
Cape Verde,
 where the vessell being somewhat olde,
began to take in much water, at a leake that was open
in the foreship. So that the wind blowing very luste∣ly
and strongely before, and the Saylers being not a∣ble
eyther to reach the 
Islandes
 aforesaid, or to gayne
the firme lande of 
Africa,
 much lesse (though they
woulde neuer so fayne) to follow on their voyage, by
sayling on with the halfe ship, and to straine the vessel
that leaked so much, the 
Pilot
 thought it better to turne




his course, and taking the wind in the poope, to goe &
saue themselues in the 
Islandes
 of 
Noua Hispania.
 And
so after terrible stormes, and extreame dangers of
drowning, and of perishing with hunger for want of
all kinde of meate,
 they arriued with much adoo at a
little 
Islande,
 called 
Cubagoa,
 and situate ouer against the

Isle
 of 
Saynt Margarete,
 where they fish for 
Pearles.
 From
thence, when they had in some haste amended their
shippe, and somewhat refreshed themselues, they say∣led
with a short cut to the firme lande, and tooke ha∣uen
in a Porte called 
Cumana,
 or (as it is called by ano∣ther
name) 
The new kingdome of Granado in the West In∣dies.

This battered and wetherbeaten vessell was no
sooner arriued in this safe harbour, but it sunke present∣ly
to the bottome, but the persons that were in her
were all saued, although afterwardes they fell sicke to
the death by reason of the great griefe, which they
had endured in hunger, in thirst, and in want of all o∣ther
sustenance, and chiefly by the horrible stormes of
that tempestuous 
Ocean.


While the foresaide 
Embassadour
 endeauoured in
this place to recouer his former health,
 the company
of shippes which is called 
La Flotta,
 that is to say, the

Fleete,
 and vseth euery yeare to sayle from the coast
for 
Castile,
 departed from thence, so that he was con∣strayned
to stay for a new Nauie, and so consumed a
whole yeare and a halfe without doing any good. In
this meane time the King of 
Congo,
 hauing neuer re∣ceyued
any tydinges of this his 
Embassadour Odoardo,

but accounting him for dead, and not knowing that he
was driuen by tempest into the 
West Indies,
 continued




still constant in his former purpose, to procure some re∣medy
for Christianitie in his kingdome.
 And there∣fore
hee sent another 
Embassadour,
 with the selfe same
commandements, called 
Don Piedro Antonio
 the se∣conde
person in all his Realme, and with him one 
Gas∣paro
Diaz,
 a 
Portingall
 borne, a principall man and very
rich, and an auncient inhabitant in that Countrey, to
the ende that hee shoulde accompany the saide 
Don
Piedro,
 and suffer him to want nothing, and in any case
ioyne his good helpe to procure, that the request, which
he hoped to obtain of the king of 
Spaine,
 might be fully
effected: with a further expresse commandement, that
if they did meete with the saide 
Signor Odoardo,
 they
should deale in their businesse with his aduise & coun∣sell.

But an infortunate end had this 
Embassadour,
 for
he was taken at sea by 
Englishmen,
 and his shippe also,
which being drawen towardes 
Englande,
 when it was
neere vnto the Coast, by great misfortune it ranne a∣thwart
the shoare, ane there 
Don Piedro Antonio
 & his
sonne were both drowned: but the 
Portingal
 and some
fewe others with him escaped,
 and arriued in 
Spaine,
 at
such time as the said 
Odoardo
 was come to the Court, &
had entred vppon the charge of his 
Embassage.
 And
therefore this 
Gasparo
 wrote to 
Odoardo,
 that hee was
minded to returne home into 
Congo,
 and not to goe to
the Court at all: whether it were for the death of the

Cardinall,
 or for any other respect, I cannot tell, but
home he returned in deed, as he said he would.


In the time that our 
Signor Odoardo
 remained in the

West India,
 which is situate vnder the same skie, and
vnder the same climate, and of the same temperature




of ayre, that 
Congo
 is subiect vnto: hee noted that the
colour of the skinnes of the inhabitants in both coun∣tries
was farre different:
 For in 
Congo,
 they are general∣ly
and for the most parte blacke, and in 
India
 almost
white, that is to say, of a middle colour, betweene
white and blacke, which the 
Spaniardes
 call 
Mulato,
Browne,
 or 
Darke-Tawney.
 Whereby he would signifie,
that it is not caused by the Sunne, as it hath beene re∣corded
of long time, but that it commeth of nature it
selfe, who worketh it by some secreat reason, which
neuer yet to this day, eyther by auncient 
Philosopher,

or new writer, hath beene fully set downe or vnder∣stoode.


When he had recouered his health,
 he sayled to
the Porte of the Cittie of 
San Domingo
 in the 
Island
 of

Hispaniola,
 that there at the first passage he might take
some shippe that went towardes 
Castilia:
 and by good
chaunce he found a 
Portingall
 vessell, among the rest
of the Nauie, which was minded to ioyne with the

Fleete
 of shippes, that passed from the firme lande to

Castilia,
 and so to goe in good companie and better
safetie.
 All these shippes being thus vnited together,
they arriued by the helpe of a very good winde, at

Terzera,
 which is one of the 
Islandes
 called 
Azores,
 that
is to say, the 
Sparre-Haukes.
 and from thence to 
San
Lucar di Barameda,
 which is a hauen in the mouth of
the Riuer 
Guadalchibir,
 and so to 
Siuile:
 from whence
he tooke his iourney into 
Portingall
 to see his frendes,
and to furnish himselfe with all thinges necessarie for
his businesse,
 and at the last hee rode to the Court,
which was at that time in 
Madrill.
 There hee was
courteously entertained by his 
Catholike Maiestie,
 to




whom he propounded the contents of his Commissi∣ons.
But diuers great accidentes there happened, &
many difficulties that crossed him, and altogether hin∣dered
the course of those affaires, which hee had to ac∣complish
in the name of the King of 
Congo.
 For first
hee hearde the dolorous newes of the Kinges death,

that sent him on this message: and then the 
King Don
Philip
 was wholly busied about the conquest of 
Eng∣land,

so that this busines went nothing forwardes, but
was delayed from time to time: neyther did he see any
meanes of dispatch, but rather hee was giuen to vnder∣stand,
that for that time they could not intende to har∣ken
vnto him.


Now the foresaide 
Odoardo,
 being afflicted with so
many aduersities,
 began to call to mind the innumerable
perilles that he had passed, and the deadly infirmi∣tie
wherewith he was plagued, after that long, & hor∣rible
nauigation. He saw that he was sometimes cast
downe, and sometimes exalted: and knew that in this
worlde there was none other rest or quiet, but in God
Almightie. He was greatly oppressed with hart griefe,
which he did dayly and continually endure, because
he could not relieue the necessities wherewith the peo∣ple
of 
Congo
 were vexed and troubled, and manifestly
perceyued, that those poore soules incurred the ex∣treame
daunger of falling into the vtter darkenesse of
hell. He considered the great expenses, that euery
day must be defrayed at the Court for the maintenance
of himselfe and his familie. Lastly, he was wholly de∣priued
of all hope, that he should euer be able to bring
that matter to effect, which the king of 
Congo
 had im∣posed
vpon him. And therefore he made choice of




another course, that was not onely profitable for him,
but also most wholesome for his soule. For the good
Angell had touched his harte, and caused him with a
manly courage to abandon the 
Sword,
 and to take the

Crosse
 vpon him: and therevpon hee renounced the
worlde with all the deceitfull pompe and glorie
thereof; and in 
Madrill
 apparelled himselfe in a graye
course habite,
 and so went to 
Rome,
 to declare to 
Six∣tus
Quintus
 the 
Pope
 the tenor and Commission of his

Embassage,
 because he would not altogether neglect
the good intent and meaning of the King, that had sent
him, although he were now descended into a better
life. He was kindly welcomed and receiued by his

Holines,
 to whom hee discoursed the miserable estate,
wherein the Christian people of the Realme of 
Congo

did stand, for want of the worship and seruice of God,
and also the small number of Priestes, that were there
to instruct them in the doctrine of the 
Gospel,
 and to de∣liuer
vnto them the 
Sacraments
 of the 
Church,
 especial∣ly
the multitude in that countrey being (as it were)
innumerable, that euery day resorted together, to bee
baptised, instructed, confessed and communicated.
Moreouer he made a vowe and resolued in his minde,

that with such store of wealth, as God had blessed him
withall in 
Congo
 (which was not very small) he would
builde a house, wherein for the seruice of God, there
should dwell certaine learned men, and sundrie 
Priests,

to instruct the youth of those Countries in all good
languages, and in the arts liberal, and in the doctrine of
the 
Gospell,
 and in the misteries of our saluation. Out
of which house, as it were out of a holy Schoole, there
might come forth from time to time, many learned




men and well studied in the law of God, that shoulde
be able in their owne naturall Countrey tongue, to a∣waken
and raise againe the Faith of 
Christ,
 which was
now asleepe, and dried vp in those Regions: and there∣by
in processe of time there woulde spring vp many
fruits of blessing, & vigilant soules in the 
Christian Faith.

Herevnto he ment also to adde an 
Hospitall,
 that might
be a recourse and harbor for 
Gods
 poore, which com∣ing
and sayling out of strange 
Countries
 should haue re∣liefe
and entertainment in that 
Hostelry,
 and there be
cured and restored of their infirmities and necessities.
With this purpose therefore he went to 
Rome,
 to ob∣teyne
of his holynes a licence to erect this 
Seminary
 and

Hospitall,
 and to beseech him also that he would graunt
him 
Iubilies, Indulgences,
 and other 
Dispensations,
 that for
such 
Christian
 and wholsom works are requisite, espe∣cially
to the vse & benefit of those 
Countries,
 which are
so remote from 
Christendome.
 He presented himselfe to
the 
Pope,
 & deliuered vnto him his letters of credence,
and then declared vnto him at large the tenor of his
Commissions,
 wherein he had a gracious audience.
But when the 
Pope
 did vnderstand that the king∣dome
of 
Congo
 belonged to the king of

Spaine,
 he remitted that matter
wholly vnto him.








Chap. 7.
Of the Court of the King of Congo. Of the apparell of
that people before they became Christians and after.
Of the Kinges table, and manner of
his Court.


H
Etherto we haue manifestly dis∣couered
the beginning of 
Christi∣an
Religion
 in 
Congo,
 & consequent∣ly
the strange accidents that hap∣pened
therein. And now it is time
to discourse & lay open the man∣ners
and fashions of that Court, &
other customes and conditions appertayning to that
Realme. In auncient time this King and his Courti∣ers
were apparelled with certaine cloath made of the

Palme-Tree,
 (as we haue tolde you before) wherewith
they couered themselues from the girdlesteed downe∣wardes,
and girded the same streyght vnto them with
certaine girdles made of the same stuffe, very faire and
well wrought. They vsed also to hang before them,
like an apron, certaine delicate and dainty skinnes, of




little 
Tygres,
 of 
Ciuet-Cattes,
 of 
Sabelles,
 of 
Marternes,

and of such like creatures for an ornament: and for a
more glorious pompe and shew, they did weare vpon
their shoulders a certaine cape like a Whoode. Vpon
their bare skinne they had a certaine rounde garment
like a 
Rotchet,
 which they call 
Incutto,
 reaching downe
to their knees, made after the manner of a net, but the
stuffe of it was very fine cloth of the said 
Palme-Tree,
 &
at the skirtes there hung a number of threede-tasselles,
that made a very gallant shew. These 
Rotchets
 were
turned vp againe, & tucked vpon their right shoulder,
that they might be the more at libertie on that hande.
Vpon that shoulder also they had the taile of a 
Zebra,

fastned with a handle, which they vsed for a kinde of
brauery, according to the most auncient custome of
those partes. On their heades they wore cappes of
yellow and redde colour, square aboue and very little,
so that they scarcely couered the toppes of their heads,
and worne rather for a pompe and a vanitie, then to
keepe them eyther from the ayre or from the Sunne.
The most part of them went vnshodde: but the King
and some of the great 
Lords
 did weare certaine shooes
of the olde fashion, such as are to be seene in the anci∣ent

Images
 of the 
Romanes,
 and these were made also of
the woode of the 
Palme-Tree.
 The poorer sorte and
the common people were apparelled from their
middle downewardes, after the same manner, but the
cloath was courser: and the rest of their bodie all na∣ked.
The women vsed three kindes of trauerses, or (as
it were) aprons: beneath their girdlesteed. One was
very long and reached to their heels: the second short∣er
then that, and the thirde shorter then both the o∣ther,




with fringes about them, and euery one of these
three was fastened about their middle, and open be∣fore.
From their breastes downewardes, they had
another garment, like a kinde of dublet or iacket, that
reached but to their girdle: and ouer their shoulders a
certaine cloake. All these seuerall garmentes were
made of the same cloth of the 
Palme-Tree.
 They were
accustomed to goe with their faces vncouered, and a
little cappe on the head, like a mans cappe. The mea∣ner
sorte of weomen were apparelled after the same
manner, but their cloth was courser: Their Maid-ser∣uantes
and the basest kind of women were likewise at∣tyred
from the girdle downeward, and all the rest of
the bodie naked.


But after that this kingdome had receyued the 
Chri∣stian
Faith,
 the great 
Lords
 of the 
Court
 beganne to ap∣parell
themselues after the manner of the 
Portingalles,

in wearing cloakes, 
Spanish Capes,
 and 
Tabards
 or wide
Iackets of 
Scarlet,
 and cloth of 
Silke,
 euery man accor∣ding
to his wealth and abilitie. Vpon their heads they
had hats, or caps, and vpon their feet Moyls or Pantof∣fles,
of 
Veluet
 and of 
Leather,
 and buskins after the 
Por∣tingall

fashion, and long 
Rapiers
 by their sides. The
common people, that are not able to make their appa∣rell
after that manner doe keepe their olde custome.
The women also go after the 
Portingall
 fashion, sauing
that they weare no cloakes, but vpon their heads they
haue certaine veyles, and vpon their veyles blacke vel∣uet
cappes, garnished with iewelles, and chaines of
golde about their their neckes. But the poorer sorte
keep the old fashion: for onely the 
Ladies
 of the Court
doo bedecke themselues in such manner as wee haue




tolde you.


After the King himselfe was conuerted to the 
Chri∣stian
Religion,
 hee conformed his Court in a certaine
sorte after the manner of the King of 
Portingall.
 And
first for his seruice at the table when he dyneth or sup∣peth
openly in publike, there is a 
Throne
 of 
Estate

erected with three steppes, couered all ouer with

Indian Tapistrie,
 and therevpon is placed a Table, with
a chaire of 
Crimzen Veluet,
 adorned with bosses and
nailes of Golde. Hee alwaies feedeth alone by him∣selfe,
neyther doth any man euer sit at his table, but the
Princes stand about him with their heads couered. He
hath a 
Cupborde
 of Plate of 
Gold
 and 
Siluer,
 and one that
taketh assay of his meat and drinke. He maintaineth
a guarde of the 
Anzichi,
 and of other nations, that keep
about his pallace, furnished with such weapons as are
aboue mentioned: and when it pleaseth him to goe a∣broade,
they sounde their great instrumentes, which
may▪ bee hearde about fiue or sixe miles, and so signifie
that the King is going forth. All his Lords do accom∣pany
him, and likewise the 
Portingalles,
 in whom hee
reposeth a singular trust: but very seldome it is that he
goeth out of his pallace.


Twice in a weeke hee giueth audience publikely,
yet no man speaketh vnto him but his 
Lordes.
 And
because there are none, that haue any goods or lands
of their owne, but all belongeth to the 
Crowne,
 there
are but few suites or quarelles among them, sauing
peraduenture about some words. They vse no writing
at all in the 
Congo
 tongue. In cases criminall they pro∣ceede
but slenderly, for they doo very hardely and
seldome condemne any man to death. If there be a∣ny




ryot or enormitie committed against the 
Portingals

by the 
Moci-Conghi,
 (for so are the inhabitants of the
Realme of 
Congo
 called in their owne language,) they
are iudged by the lawes of 
Portingall.
 And if any mis∣chiefe
bee founde in any of them, the king confineth
the malefactor into some desert 
Island:
 for he thinketh
it to bee a greater punishmente to banish him in this
sorte, to the end he may doe pennance for his sinnes,
then at one blow to execute him. And if it so happen
that those which are thus chastized, doe liue tenne or
twelue yeares, the King vseth to pardon them, if they
be of any consideration at all, and doeth imploy them
in the seruice of the State, as persons that haue beene
tamed and well schooled, and accustomed to suffer
any hardenesse. In Ciuill disagreements there is an
order, that if a 
Portingall
 haue any suite against a 
Moci-Congo,

he goeth to the Iudge of 
Congo:
 but if a 
Moci-Congo

doe impleade a 
Portingall,
 hee citeth him before
the 
Consul
 or Iudge of the 
Portingalles:
 for the King
hath graunted vnto them one of their owne nation to
be Iudge in that countrey. In their bargains between
them and the 
Portingalles,
 they vse no writinges nor
other instrumentes of billes or bondes, but dispatch
their businesse onely by word and witnesse.


They keepe no histories of their auncient Kinges
nor any memoriall of the ages past, because they can∣not
write. They measure their times generally by
the Moones. They knowe not the houres of the day
nor of the night: but they vse to say, 
In the time of such
a man such a thing happened.
 They reckon the distan∣ces
of countries not by miles or by any such measure,




but by the iourneyes and trauell of men, that goe
from one place to another, eyether loaden or vnloaden.


Touching their assembling together at feastes,
 or
other meetinges of ioy, as for example, when they
are marryed,
 they sing 
Verses
 and 
Ballades
 of 
Loue,
 and
play vppon certaine Lutes that are made after a strange
fashion. For in the hollowe parte and in the necke
they are somwhat like vnto our 
Lutes,
 but for the
flat side, (where wee vse to carue a 
Rose,
 or a 
Rundell

to let the sounde goe inwarde) that is made not of
wood, but of a skinne, as thinne as a bladder, and the
stringes are made of hayres, which they draw out of
the 
Elephantes
 tayle, and are very strong and bright:
and of certaine threedes made of the woode of 
Palme-Tree,

which from the bottome of the instrument doe
reach and ascende to the toppe of the handle, and are
tyed euery one of them to his seuerall ringe. For to∣wardes
the necke or handle of this 
Lute,
 there are cer∣taine
rings placed some higher and some lower, where∣at
there hange diuers plates of 
Iron
 and 
Siluer,
 which
are very thinne, and in bignesse different one from a∣nother,
according to the proportion of the instru∣ment.
These ringes doo make a sounde of sundrie
tunes, according to the striking of the stringes. For
the stringes when they are striken, doo cause the rings
to shake, and then doo the plates that hang at them,
helpe them to vtter a certayne mingled and confused
noyse. Those that play vppon this Instrument, doo
tune the strings in good proportion, and strike them
with their fingers, like a 
Harpe,
 but without any quill
very cunningly: so that they make thereby (I cannot




tell whether I shoulde call it a melodie or no, but) such
a sounde as pleaseth and delighteth their sences well
enough. Besides all this (which is a thing very ad∣mirable)
by this instrument they doo vtter they con∣ceites
of their mindes, and doo vnderstande one ano∣ther
so plainely, that euery thing almost which may
be explaned with the tongue, they can declare with
their hande in touching and striking this instrument.
To the sounde thereof they do dance in good measure
with their feet, and follow the iust time of that musicke
with clapping the palmes of their handes one against
the other. They haue also in the 
Court, Flutes
 and

Pipes,
 which they sound very artificially, and accor∣ding
to the sounde they daunce and moue their feet,
as it were in a 
Moresco,
 with great grauity and sobrietie.
The common people doe vse little 
Rattles,
 and 
Pipes,
 &
other instrumentes, that make a more harsh and rude
sound, then the Court-instruments do.


In this kingdome,
 when any are sicke, they take
nothing but naturall phisicke, as 
Hearbes,
 and 
Trees,

and the barkes of 
Trees,
 and 
Oyles,
 and 
Waters
 and

Stones,
 such as 
Mother Nature
 hath taught them. The

Ague
 is the most common disease that raigneth among
them: and plagueth them in Winter by reason of
the continuall raine, that bringeth heat and moysture
with it more then in Sommer, and besides that the sick∣nes
which here we cal the 
French disease,
 & 
Chitangas
 in
the 
Congo
 tongue, is not there so daungerous and so
harde to be cured, as it is in our Countries.


They heale the Ague with the poulder of a wood,

called 
Sandale,
 or 
Saunders,
 whereof there is both redde




and gray, which is the woode of 
Aguila.
 This poul∣der
being mingled with the oyle of the 
Palme-Tree,

and hauing annointed the bodie of the sicke person
two or three times withall from the head to the foote,

the partie recouereth. When their head aketh, they
let bloude in the temples, with certaine little boxing
hornes: first by cutting the skinne a little, and then
applying the 
Cornets
 therevnto, which with a sucke
of the mouth, will be filled with bloud: and this man∣ner
of letting bloude is vsed also in 
Aegipt.
 And so in
any other parte of a mans body, where there is any
griefe,
 they drawe bloude in this fashion and heale it.
Likewise they cure the infirmitie called 
Chitangas,
 with
the same vnction of 
Saunders:
 whereof there are two
sorts, one redde (as we tolde you) and that is called

Tauila:
 the other gray, and is called 
Chicongo:
 and
this is best esteemed, for they will not sticke to giue or
sell a slaue for a peece of it.
 They purge themselues
with certaine barkes of trees, made into powder, and
taken in some drinke: and they will worke mightely
and strongly. When they take these purgations,
they make no great account for going abroade into
the ayre.
 Their woundes also they commonly cure
with the iuyce of certaine hearbs, and with the hearbs
themselues. And the sayde 
Signor Odoardo
 hath af∣firmed
vnto me, that he sawe a slaue, which was stab∣bed
through with seauen mortall woundes of an Ar∣row,
and was recouered whole and sound, onely with
the iuyce of certaine hearbes, well knowen vnto them
by experience. So that this people is not encumbred
with a number of 
Phisicians,
 for 
Surgery,
 for 
Drugges,





for 
Sirruppes,
 for 
Electuaries,
 for 
Playsters,
 and such
like Medicines, but simply doe heale and cure them∣selues
with such naturall Plantes as grow in their owne
Countrey. Whereof they haue no great neede nei∣ther:
for liuing (as they doo) vnder a temperate cly∣mate,
and not ingorging themselues with much va∣rietie
of meates to please their appetites, nor surchar∣ging
their stomackes with wine, they are not greatly
troubled with those diseases, that commonly
are engendred of meates and drinkes
that remaine vndigested.








Chap. 8.
Of the Countries, that are beyonde the Kingdome of Congo
towardes the Cape of Good-Hope: and of
the Riuer Nilus.


N
Ow that we haue seene the King∣dome
of 
Congo,
 and the conditi∣ons
both of the Countrey and
people that dwell therein, and al∣so
of the nations therevnto ad∣ioyning,
it remayneth that wee
discourse a little further, and that
with all breuitie, of the rest of 
A∣frica,

towardes the 
Cape
 of 
Good-Hope,
 all along the

Ocean,
 whereby they vse to sayle into 
India
 euen as
farre as the redde sea: and then we will returne backe
againe into the 
Inlande,
 and treate of the Riuer 
Nilus,

and of 
Preti-Gianni,
 and of all his kingdomes: to the
ende, that so farre, as our matter will beare, we may
make a perfecte relation of those Regions, which hi∣therto
haue not so well and so rightly been conceaued
of euery man. Beyond the Kingdome of 
Congo,
 we
haue signified vnto you, that there are other countries




belonging to the King of 
Angola,
 and beyond that to∣wardes
the 
Cape
 of 
Good-Hope,
 a King called 
Matama,

who ruleth ouer diuers Prouinces, which are called

Quimbebe.
 This Realme (as we tolde you) from the
first 
Lake
 and the confines of 
Angola,
 contayneth all the
rest of the countrey 
Southwardes,
 till you come to the
Riuer of 
Brauagul,
 which springeth out of the moun∣taines
of the 
Moone,
 aud ioyneth with the Riuer 
Mag∣nice,

and that springeth out of the foresaide first 
Lake:

These mountaines are diuided by the 
Tropicke
 of 
Ca∣pricorne,

towardes the 
Pole Antarctike,
 and beyonde
this 
Tropike
 lyeth all the Countrey and borders of the

Cape
 of 
Good-Hope,
 which are not ruled and gouerned
by any one Kinge, but by diuers and sundry seuerall

Princes.
 In the middest betweene that 
Cape
 and the

Tropike,
 are the saide Mountaines of the 
Moone,
 so fa∣mous
and so greatly renowned among the auncient
writers, who do assigne them to be the originall head
and spring of the 
Riuer Nilus:
 which is very false and
vntrue, as the situation of the countrey doth plainely
shewe, and as wee a little hereafter will discouer vnto
you. This Countrey is full of high and rough moun∣taines:
it is very coulde, and not habitable: It is fre∣quented
and haunted with a few persons that liue after
the manner of the 
Arabians,
 vnder little cabbins in the
open fieldes, and apparelled with the skinnes of cer∣taine
beastes. It is a sauage and a rusticall nation, with∣out
all faith and credite, neyther will they suffer any
straungers among them. Their furniture is Bowes
and Arrowes. They feede vpon such fruites, as the
lande breedeth, and also vpon the flesh of beastes.






Among these 
Mountains
 of the 
Moone,
 there is a 
Lake

called 
Gale:
 a very little one it is, and lyeth somewhat
towardes the 
West.
 Out of this 
Lake
 there issueth a

Riuer
 called 
Camissa,
 and by the 
Portingalles
 named 
The
sweete Riuer,
 which at the point of the 
Cape of Good-Hope

voydeth it selfe into the sea, in that very place that is
termed 
The False Cape.
 For the shippes of the 
Indies

sayling that way, doo first discouer another greater

Cape,
 which is called 
The Cape of the Needles,
 and then
afterwardes this lesser 
Cape:
 Wherevpon they call it

The False Cape,
 because it is hidde and couered with
the true and great 
Cape.
 Betweene these two 
Capes
 or

Promontories,
 there is the distance of an hundred miles,
contayning the largenesse and breadth of this famous

Cape:
 which being deuided into two points, as it were
into two hornes, it maketh a 
Gulfe,
 where sometimes
the 
Portingall
 shippes doe take fresh water, in the Riuer
that they call the 
Sweet Riuer.


The inhabitantes of this coast, which dwell be∣tweene
these two points,
 are of colour blacke, although
the 
Pole Antarctike
 in that place be in the eleuation of
thirtie and fiue degrees, which is a very strange thing:
yea the rude people that liue among the most colde
mountains of the 
Moone
 are blacke also. This I write
of purpose, to aduise and moue the 
Philosophers
 and
such as search the effectes of nature, that they would
fall into their deepe contemplation and speculation, &
therevpon teach vs, whether this blacke colour be oc∣casioned
by the 
Sunne,
 or by any other secrete and vn∣knowne
cause: Which question I for this time doe
meane to leaue vndecided.






Now forasmuch as this 
Promontory
 of 
Good-Hope,

is the greatest 
Cape
 of all,
 and stretcheth out into the
Sea farther then any other in the whole vniuersall
worlde, and is very daungerous to passe (as all 
Pro∣montories

are:) and for that also the sea is there most
terrible, and from the lande there blow most horrible
winds, which cause that 
Ocean
 to be exceedingly tem∣pestuous
and stormie, so that many 
Portingall
 shippes
of admirable burthens, haue beene cast away therein:
and lastly, because the auncient 
Historiographers
 did
neuer knowe it, no not so much as by hearesay, and
it is not long ago since the King of 
Portingalles
 Fleetes
did first discouer the same: It shal not be impertinent,
but rather a matter of great conuenience in this place
to decipher the measure thereof, & to make so manifest
a declaration of it, as may serue also to vnderstande,
how great the nauigation is from 
Portingall
 into 
India,

by compassing the Coast of the 
Cape
 of 
Good-Hope
 one∣ly,
almost the space of sixe thousande miles, as a little
hereafter it shall be shewed vnto you,


For from the Riuer of 
Ferdinando Poo,
 where the said

Cape
 beginneth to iut-out into the sea,
 as farre as to the

Poynt,
 which we call the 
Point of Needles,
 there is con∣tayned
vpon the shoare more then two thousande and
200. myles from the 
North,
 to the 
South,
 and on the
contrary side, from the said 
Point
 to the 
Cape
 of 
Guarda-Fuy,

right ouer against the 
Islande
 of 
Socotora,
 they rec∣kon
more then three thousande and three hundred
miles by the coast from the 
South
 to the 
North.
 So that
from 
Lisbone,
 compassing about the shoares of 
Africa,

and all the 
Cape
 of 
Good-Hope,
 vnto the kingdome of





Goa,
 there are moe then fifteene thousand miles. And
from thence afterwardes to 
Malaca,
 and to 
China,
 and
so forwardes, there remayneth so long a iourney, that
neuer yet in any time hetherto hath there beene so
great and so daungerous a nauigation vndertaken and
performed, as this of the 
Portingalles,
 neyther with
great vesselles nor with small.
 It is called the 
Cape
 of

Good-Hope,
 because all such as saile that way, aswell in
going forth, as in returning home, doo especially &
principally ayme at this marke, that they may passe
and get beyonde this 
Promontorie;
 which when they
haue doone, they account themselues to bee out of all
daunger, and as it were to haue performed their iour∣ney.
And vpon this their generall desire, they gaue it
the name of the 
Cape
 of 
Good-Hope.


Nowe to returne to our purpose, and to talke
further of the Coast of 
Africa,
 beyonde the 
Cape
 or

Poynt
 of the 
Needelles,
 there are many competent har∣boroughes
and hauens,
 the principall whereof is 
Seno
Formoso, The faire Bay:
 and 
Seno del Lago, The Bay of the
Lake:
 For there the sea maketh a certaine 
Gulfe,
 where∣in
are sundry 
Islandes
 and 
Portes:
 and somewhat be∣yonde
there runneth into the sea the Riuer of 
S. Chri∣stopher,

and at the mouth thereof there lye three pret∣tie

Islettes.
 A little further forwardes, the Coast run∣neth
all along by a Countrey,
 which the 
Portingalles

call 
Terra do Natal,
 the Land of the 
Natiuitie,
 because
it was first discouered at 
Christmasse:
 and so reacheth
to the 
Cape
 called 
Della Pescheria.
 Betweene which

Cape
 and the Riuer 
Magnice,
 within the Land is the
Kingdome of 
Buttua.
 whose Territories are from the




rootes or bottome of the mountaines of the 
Moone,
 vn∣till
you come to the riuer 
Magnice
 towards the 
North,

where the countrey of 
Monomotapa
 standeth, and west∣wardes
from the Riuer 
Brauagul
 towardes the sea all a∣long
the bankes of the Riuer 
Magnice.
 In this king∣dome
there are many mynes of 
Golde,
 and a people
that is of the same qualities and conditions, that the
people of 
Monomotapa
 is, as hereafter shall bee shewed
vnto you. And so going along the shores of the 
Oce∣an,

you come to the Riuer 
Magnice,
 which lyeth
in the very entraunce of the Kingdome
of 
Sofala,
 and the Empire of

Monomotapa.








Chap. 9.
Of the Kingdome of Sofala.


T
His Kingdome beginneth at
the Riuer 
Magnice,
 which
springeth out of the first 
Lake
 of

Nilus,
 and conueyeth it selfe in∣to
the sea in the middest of the

Bay,
 betweene the point 
Pesche∣ria

and the 
Cape
 called 
Capo delle
Correnti,
 situate in twentie and
three degrees & a halfe of the 
Pole Antarctik
 vnder the

Tropike
 of 
Capricorne.
 With this Riuer neere vnto
the sea,
 there ioyne three other notable riuers, the
principall whereof is by the 
Portingalles
 called 
Saynt
Christophers,
 because vpon the day of that 
Saintes
 feast it
was first discouered,
 but by the inhabitantes it is na∣med

Nagoa.
 The second tooke the name of one 
Lo∣renzo
Margues,
 that first found it. These two Riuers
do spring originally from the mountains of the 
Moone,

so greatly renowned among the auncient writers, but
by the people of the country they are called 
Toroa:
 out
of which Mountains they did thinke that famous 
Nilus





tooke also his beginning: but they were vtterly decey∣ued.
For (as we haue already tolde you) the first

Lake
 ariseth not out of those Mountaines,
 but lyeth a
great way distant from it: and betweene it and them
is there a very great and a huge low plaine. Besides
that, the streames that flow from the said mountaines
do runne towardes the 
East,
 and bestow their waters
vpon other great Riuers, so that it is not possible for
them to passe into the foresaide 
Lake,
 much lesse into

Nilus,
 considering especially that the 
Riuer Magnice

springeth out of that first 
Lake,
 and by a farre different
course from the course of 
Nilus,
 runneth towards the

East,
 and so ioyneth it selfe with the two Riuers afore∣saide.

The thirde is called 
Arroe,
 and ariseth on
another side out of the Mountaines of the 
Gold-Mines

of 
Monomotapa:
 and in some places of this Riuer there
are founde some small peeces of 
Golde
 among the sand.
These three Riuers enter into the great 
Magnice
 neere
vnto the sea, and all fower together doo make there a
great water, in a very large channell, and so dischar∣geth
it selfe into the 
Ocean.
 From the mouth of this
riuer all along the sea coast,
 stretcheth the kingdome
of 
Sofala
 vnto the Riuer 
Cuama,
 which is so called of a
certaine castel or fortresse that carryeth the same name,
and is possessed by 
Mahometans
 and 
Pagans:
 but the

Portingalles
 call it, 
The mouthes of Cuama:
 because at the
entry into the sea, this riuer diuideth it self into seauen
mouthes, where there are fiue speciall 
Islandes,
 besides
diuerse others that lie vp the riuer, all very full and wel
peopled with 
Pagans.
 This 
Cuama
 commeth out of
the same 
Lake,
 and from the same springs from whence

Nilus
 floweth. And thus the Kingdome of 
Sofala
 is




comprised within the saide two Riuers, 
Magnice
 and

Cuama
 vpon the sea coast.
 It is but a smal Kingdome,
and hath but few howses or townes in it: The chiefe
and principall head whereof, is an 
Islande
 that lyeth in
the riuer called 
Sofala,
 which giueth the name to all
the whole Countrey. It is inhabited by 
Mahometans,

and the King himselfe is of the same secte, and yeeldeth
obedience to the 
Crowne
 of 
Portingall,
 because he will
not be subiecte to the Empire of 
Monomotapa.
 And
therevpon the 
Portingalles
 there doo keepe a Forte in
the mouth of the riuer 
Cuama,
 and doo trade in those
Countryes for 
Golde,
 and 
Iuory,
 and 
Amber,
 which is
founde vppon that Coast,
 and good store of slaues,
and in steede thereof they leaue behinde them 
Cotton-Cloth,

and 
Silkes
 that are brought from 
Cambaia,
 and is
the common apparell of those people.
 The 
Maho∣metans

that at this present do inhabite those Countries
are not naturally borne there, but before the 
Portingals

came into those quarters, they trafficked thether in
small barkes from the Coast of 
Arabia Foelix.
 And
when the 
Portingalles
 had conquered that Realme,
the 
Mahometans
 stayed there still, and nowe they are
become neyther vtter 
Pagans,
 nor holding of the secte
of 
Mahomet.


From the shoars and Coast, that lyeth betweene the
two foresaide riuers of 
Magnice
 and 
Cuama,
 within the
land spreadeth the Empire of 
Monomotapa,
 where there
is verye great store of 
Mines
 of 
Golde,
 which is carryed
from thence into all the regions thereaboutes, and into

Sofala,
 and into the other partes of 
Africa.
 And some
there be that wil say, that 
Salomons Golde,
 which he had
for the Temple of 
Ierusalem,
 was brought by sea out of




these Countreyes. A thing in truth not very vnlikely:
For in the Countries of 
Monomotapa,
 there doe remain
to this day many ancient buildings of great worke and
singular 
Architecture,
 of 
Stone,
 of 
Lime,
 and of 
Timber,

the like whereof are not to be seene in all the 
Prouinces

adioyning.


The Empire of 
Monomotapa
 is very great, and for
people infinite.
 They are 
Gentiles
 and 
Pagans,
 of co∣lour
blacke, very couragious in warre, of a middle sta∣ture,
and swift of foote. There are many Kinges, that
are vassalles and subiectes to 
Monomotapa,
 who doe of∣tentimes
rebell and make warre against him. Their
weapons are bowes and arrowes, and light dartes.
This Emperour maintayneth many Armies in seuerall
Prouinces,
 deuided into 
Legions,
 according to the vse
and custome of the 
Romanes.
 For being so great a 
Lord

as he is, he must of necessitie be in continuall warre, for
the maintenance of his estate. And among all the
rest of his souldiers, the most valorous in name are his
Legions of women, whom he esteemeth very highly,
and accounteth them as the very sinewes and strength
of his military forces. These women do burne their
leaft pappes with fire,
 because they should bee no hin∣deraunce
vnto them in their shooting, after the vse and
manner of the auncient 
Amazones,
 that are so greatly
celebrated by the 
Historiographers
 of former prophane
memories. For their weapons they practise bowes
and arrowes: They are very quicke and swift, liuely
and couragious, very cunning in shooting, but especi∣ally
and aboue all venturous and constant in fight. In
their battelles they vse a warlike kind of craft and sub∣tiltie:
For they haue a custome to make a shew that




they would flie and runne away, as though they were
vanquished and discomfited, but they wil diuers times
turne themselues backe, and vexe their enemies migh∣tely
with the shot of their arrowes. And when they
see their aduersaries so greedie of the victory, that they
beginne to dispearse and scatter themselues, then will
they suddenly turne againe vpon them, and with great
courage and fiercenes make a cruell slaughter of them.
So that partely with their swiftnes, and partely with
their deceitful wiles and other cunning shifts of warre,
they are greatly feared in all those partes. They doo
inioy by the Kinges good fauour certayne Countries
where they dwell alone by themselues: and sometimes
they choose certaine men at their owne pleasure, with
whom they doo keepe company for generations sake:
So that if they doo bring forth Male-children, they
sende them home to their fathers housen: but if they
be female, they reserue them to themselues, and breed
them in the exercise of warfare.


The Empire of this 
Monomotapa
 lyeth (as it were) in
an 
Islande,
 which is made by the Sea-coast, by the Ri∣uer

Magnice,
 by a peece of the 
Lake
 from whence 
Mag∣nice

floweth, and by the Riuer 
Cuama.
 It bordereth
towardes the 
South
 vpon the 
Lordes
 of the 
Cape
 of 
Good-Hope

before mentioned, and 
Northwarde
 vpon the
Empire of 
Moenemugi,
 as by and by shall be shewed vn∣to
you.


But now returning to our former purpose, that is to
say,
 to runne forwardes vpon the sea-coast, after you
haue passed ouer some parte of the Riuer 
Cuama,
 there
is a certaine little Kingdom vpon the sea called 
Angoscia,

which taketh the name of certaine 
Islandes
 there so cal∣led




and lie directly against it. It is inhabited with the
like people, both 
Mahometans
 and 
Gentiles,
 as the King∣dome
of 
Sofala
 is. Marchaunts they are, and in small
vesselles doo trafficke along that coast, with the same
wares and commodities, wherewith the people of 
So∣fala

doo trade.


A little beyonde,
 suddenly starteth vp in sight the
Kingdome of 
Mozambique,
 situate in fourteene degrees
and a halfe towardes the 
South,
 and taketh his name of
three 
Islands,
 that lie in the mouth of the Riuer 
Meghin∣cate,

where there is a great hauen and a safe, and able
to receiue all manner of shippes. The Realme is but
small, and yet aboundeth in all kind of victuailes. It is
the common landing place for all vesselles that sayle
from 
Portingall,
 and from 
India
 into that Countrey. In
one of these 
Isles,
 which is the chiefe and principall,
called 
Mozambique,
 and giueth name to all the rest, as
also to the whole kingdome,
 and the hauen aforesaide,
wherein there is erected a Fortresse, guarded with a
garrison of 
Portingalles,
 wherevpon all the other For∣tresses
that are on that Coast doo depende, and from
whence they fetch all their prouision: all the 
Armadas

and Fleetes that sayle from 
Portingall
 to the 
Indies,
 if
they cannot finish and performe their voyage, will go
and winter (I say) in this 
Island
 of 
Mozambique:
 and
those that trauell out of 
India
 to 
Europe,
 are constrained
of necessitie to touch at 
Mozambique,
 to furnish them∣selues
with victuailes. This 
Island,
 when the 
Portin∣galles

discouered 
India,
 was the first place, where they
learned the language of the 
Indians,
 & prouided them¦selues
of Pilots to direct them in their course.
 The
people of this kingdome are 
Gentiles:
 Rusticall and




rude they be & of colour blacke. They go all naked.
They are valiaunt and stronge Archers, and cunning
Fishers with all kinde of hookes.


As you go on forwardes vpon the foresaide coasts,
there is another 
Islande
 called 
Quiloa,
 in quantitie not
great, but in excellency singular: For it is situate in a
very coole and fresh ayre: It is replenished with trees
that are alwaies greene, and affordeth all varietie of
victuailes. It lyeth at the mouth of the Riuer 
Coauo,

which springeth out of the same 
Lake
 from whence 
Ni∣lus

floweth, and so runneth about sixtie miles in length,
till it commeth neere to the sea, and there it hath a
mightie streame, and in the very mouth of it maketh
a great 
Islande,
 which is peopled with 
Mahometans
 and

Idolaters,
 and a little beyonde that towardes the Coast
on the 
West
 you may see the said 
Island
 of 
Quiloa.
 This

Islande
 is inhabited with 
Mahometans
 also,
 which are
of colour something whitish. They are well apparel∣led,
& trimly adorned with cloth of silke and Cotton:
Their women do vse ornaments of 
Gold,
 and 
Iewelles

about their handes and their neckes, and haue good
store of houshold stuffe made of siluer. They are not
altogether so black as the men are: and in their limmes
they are very well proportioned. Their houses are
made of 
Stone,
 and 
Lime,
 & 
Timber,
 very well wrought
and of good architecture, with gardens and orchardes
full of hearbes and sundry fruites. Of this 
Islande
 the
whole Kingdome tooke the name, which vppon the
Coast extendeth it selfe from 
Capo Delgado,
 (the 
Cape
Delicate,
 that bordereth 
Mozambique
 & 
Quiloa,)
 & is si∣tuate
in nine degrees towards the 
South,
 & from thence
it runneth out vnto the aforesaide Riuer of 
Coauo.





In olde time the Kingdome of 
Quiloa
 was the chief∣est
of all the 
Principalities
 there adioyning, and stoode
neere to the sea: but when the 
Portingalles
 arriued in
those countries, the King trusted so much to himselfe,
that he thought he was able with his owne forces not
onely to defend himselfe against them, but also to driue
them from those places which they had already sur∣prised.

Howbeit the matter fell out quite contrary.
For when it came to weapons, hee was vtterly ouer∣throwen
and discomfited by the 
Portingals,
 and so fled
away. But they tooke and possessed the 
Island,
 and
enriched themselues with the great spoyles and boo∣ties
that they found therein. They erected there also
a Fortresse, which was afterwarde pulled downe by
the commandement of the King of 
Portingall,
 because
hee thought it not necessary, considering that there
were others sufficient enough for that Coast.


And here we may not leaue behinde vs the 
Isle
 of

S. Laurence,
 so called by the 
Portingalles,
 because they
did first discouer it vpon that 
Martyrs
 feast day. It
is so great,
 that it contayneth in length almost a thou∣sande
miles, and standeth right ouer against the coast
which we haue described, beginning directly at the
mouthes of the Riuer 
Magnice,
 which are in twenty
and sixe degrees of the 
South,
 and so going forwardes
to the 
North,
 it endeth right against the mouthes of 
Cu∣ama

in the kingdome of 
Quiloa.
 Between this 
Island

and the firme lande there is (as it were) a channell,




which at the entrie 
Westwarde
 is three hundred and for∣tie
miles broade, in the middest where it is narrowest
ouer against the 
Islande
 of 
Mozambiche
 an hundred and
seuentie miles, and for the rest it enlargeth it selfe very
much towards 
India,
 and contayneth many 
Isles
 within
it. The ships that go from 
Spaine
 into 
India,
 or returne
from 
India
 to 
Spaine,
 doo alwayes for the most parte
passe and saile in and through this channell, if by time
or weather they be not forced to the contrary. And
surely this 
Islande
 deserueth to be inhabited with a bet∣ter
people, because it is furnished with singular com∣modities.
For it hath many safe & sure hauens. It is wa∣tred
with sundry Riuers that cause the earth to bring
forth fruits of diuers kinds, as 
Pulse,
 and 
Ryce,
 and other
graine, 
Oranges, Limons, Citrons,
 and such like fruite.
Flesh of all sorts, as 
Hennes
 &c. and venison, as wilde

Boare
 and 
Deere,
 and such like, & all this of a very good
tast and relish,
 because the soyle is very fat: their fish al∣so
is exceeding good. The inhabitants are 
Pagans,

with some of the sect of 
Mahomet
 among them. They
are of the colour which the 
Spaniardes
 call 
Mulato,
 be∣tweene
blacke and white. Very warlicke they are &
giuen to their weapons, which are bowes and arrows,
and dartes of very light wood, strengthned with 
Iron,

whereof they make the heads of their dartes, which are
crooked like hookes: and these they wil cast and throw
most slightly and cunningly. They vse also 
Targattes

and 
Iackes
 that are made of certain beasts-skins, where∣with
they saue themselues in fight from the blowes of
their enemies. This 
Islande
 is deuided among seueral
Princes, that are at enmitie one with another: for they
are in continuall warres, and persecute one another




with Armes. There are diuers mynes of 
Gold,
 of 
Sil∣uer,

of 
Copper,
 of 
Iron,
 and of other Mettalles, The
sauage people doo not vse to saile out of the 
Island,
 but
onely from one side to the other they goe coasting a∣long
the shoares, with certaine barks that are made but
of one stocke of a tree, which they hollowe for that
purpose. The most part of them doo not willingly
entertaine straungers, neyther will they consent that
they shoulde trafficke or conuerse with them. Not∣withstanding
in certaine portes, the 
Portingalles
 do vse
to trade with the 
Islanders
 for 
Amber,
 
Waxe, Siluer, Cop∣per,
Ryse,
 and such other thinges, but they neuer come
vpon the lande. In the channell before mentioned
there are diuers 
Islandes,
 some greater, and some lesse,
inhabited with 
Mahometans.
 The chiefe of them is
the 
Isle
 of 
Saint Christopher,
 and then of 
Santo Spirito:
 &
another called 
Magliaglie,
 and so the rest, as the 
Isles
 of

Comoro,
 
Anzoame, Maiotto,
 and some other.


But let vs returne to the sea side, and prosecute the
Coast of the kingdome of 
Quiloa
 where we leaft. Next
vnto it, is the kingdome of 
Mombaza,
 in the height
of three degrees and a halfe towardes the 
South,
 which
taketh the name from an 
Islande
 inhabited with 
Maho∣metans,

which is also called 
Mombaza,
 where there is a
fayre Cittie, with houses that haue many Sollers, fur∣nished
with pictures both grauen and painted. The
king thereof is a 
Mahometan,
 who taking vpon him to
resist the 
Portingalles,
 receyued the same successe that
happened to the king of 
Quiloa,
 so that the city was ran∣sacked
& spoyled by his enemies, who found therein
good store of 
Gold,
 and 
Siluer,
 and 
Pearle,
 and 
Cloth
 of

Cotton,
 and of 
Silke,
 and of 
Golde,
 and such other com∣modities.




This kingdome lyeth betweene the bor∣ders
of 
Quiloa,
 and 
Melinde,
 and is inhabited with 
Pa∣gans

and 
Mahometans,
 and yeeldeth obedience to the
Empire of 
Mohenemugi.


A little beyond,
 is the Kingdome of 
Melinde,
 which
being likewise but a little one, extendeth it selfe vpon
the sea coast as farre as the Riuer 
Chimanchi,
 and lyeth
in the height of two degrees and a halfe: and vp the
streame of that riuer it reacheth to the Lake 
Calice,

the space of an hundred miles within lande. Neere
vnto the sea along the bankes of this riuer, there is a
great deale of Countrey inhabited by 
Pagans
 and 
Ma∣hometans,

of colour almost white. Their houses are
built after our fashion. But there is one particulari∣tie
to be admired, that their Muttons or 
Sheep
 are twice
as great as the 
Sheepe
 of our countrey: for they deuide
them into fiue quarters,
 (if a man may so call them) &
reckon the tayle for one, which commonly wayeth
some twentie and fiue, or thirtie pounde. The wo∣men
are white and sumptuously dressed after the 
Ara∣bian

fashion, with cloth of 
Silke.
 About their neckes
and handes, and armes, and feete, they vse to weare
iewelles of 
Gold,
 and 
Siluer:
 When they go abroade
out of their houses,
 they couer themselues with 
Taffa∣ta,

so that they are not knowen but when they list
themselues. In this Countrey there is a very good
hauen, which is a landing place for the vesselles that
saile through those seas. Generally, the people are ve∣ry
kinde, true and trustie, and conuerse with strangers.
They haue alwayes entertained and welcomed the

Portingals,
 and haue reposed great confidence in them,
neyther haue they euer offered them any wrong in a∣ny




respect.


In the sea betweene these two 
Capes
 of 
Mombaza,

and 
Melinde
 there are three 
Isles:
 The first is called

Monsie,
 the second 
Zanzibar,
 and the thirde 
Pemba,
 all
inhabited onely with 
Mahometans,
 that are of colour
white. These 
Isles
 abound in all things as the others
doo, whereof we made mention before. These peo∣ple
are somewhat enclyned to armes: but they are in
deed more addicted to dresse & manure their ground:
For there groweth much 
Sugar,
 which in small barkes
they carry away to sell into the firme lande with other
fruites of that Countrey.


Besides these three realmes last described, 
Quiloa,
Melinde,
 and 
Mombaza,
 within the Lande is the great
Empire of 
Moenemugi,
 towards the 
West.
 It bordereth
vpon the 
South,
 with the kingdome of 
Mozambique,

and with the Empire of 
Monomotapa
 to the riuer 
Coauo,

vpon the 
West
 with the riuer 
Nilus,
 betweene the two

Lakes;
 and vpon the 
North
 it ioyneth with the Empire
of 
Prete Gianni.
 Towardes the sea, this Emperour
standeth in good termes of peace with the foresaide
kings of 
Quiloa, Melinde,
 and 
Mombaza,
 by reason of
their trafficke together, and the better to secure the en∣tercourse
and trade by sea: by meanes whereof they
haue brought vnto them much cloth of 
Cotton,
 and
cloth of 
Silke
 from diuers Countries, and other mar∣chandises
that are well esteemed in these partes: and
particularly certaine little balles, that are made in the
kingdome of 
Cambaia,
 of a kind of 
Bitumen
 or clammie

Clay,
 like vnto glasse, but that it is (as it were) of a red
colour, which they vse to weare about their neckes,




like a payre of beades in steed of necklaces. It serueth
them also in steede of Money, for of 
Gold
 they make
none account. Likewise with the silks that are brought
vnto them, they doo apparell themselus from the gir∣dle
downewardes. In exchaunge and barter of all
these commodities, they giue 
Gold, Siluer, Copper
 and

Iuorie.


But on the other side towardes 
Monomotapa,
 there
are continuall warres, yea and sometimes so blooddy,
that it is hardely discerned who hath gotten the victo∣rie.
For in that border there meet together two of the
greatest and most warlike powers and forces that are
in all those regions: that is to say, on the party of 
Mo∣nomotapa

there came forth into the field the 
Amazones,

of whom wee tolde you before, and on the partie of

Mohenemugi
 are the 
Giacchi,
 (as the 
Moci-Conghi
 do
call them) but in their owne tongue they are called

Agagi,
 who did sometime so greatly afflict the king∣dome
of 
Congo,
 as you may remember. Neyther are
these people lesse couragious or strong then the 
Ama∣zones,

but are of a blacke complexion, and presump∣tuous
countenances. They doo vse to marke them∣selues
aboue the lippe vpon their cheekes with certain
lines which they make with 
Iron
 instruments and with
fire. Moreouer, they haue a custome to turne their
eye liddes backewardes: so that their skinne being all
blacke, and in that blacknes shewing the white of their
eyes, and those marks in their faces, it is a strange thing
to behold them. For it is in deede a very dreadfull &
diuelish sight. They are of bodie great, but deformed
and liue like beastes in the fielde, and feede vpon mans




flesh. In fight they shew themselues exceedingly cou∣ragious,
and doo vtter most horrible shouting and
crying, of purpose to daunte and affray their enemies.
Their weapons are Dartes, and Pauises of 
Leather
 that
couer all their whole bodie, and so defend themselues
therewith. Sometimes they will encampe together,
and sticke their 
Pauises
 in the grounde, which are vnto
them in steed of a trench: Sometimes they wil go for∣wardes
in the battell, and shrowde themselues vnder
them, and yet annoy their aduersaries with the shot of
their dartes. And thus by warlike pollicie they doo
ordinarily plague their enemies, by endeauouring
with all subtiltie to make them spende their shotte in
vaine vpon their Targettes: and when they see that
they haue made an ende of shooting, then doo they
renew the battell a fresh, and driuing them to flight,
make a cruell slaughter of them without all mercie.
And this is the manner which they vse against their e∣nemies,

and the 
Amazones.
 But the 
Amazones
 on the
other side, which are very well acquainted herewith∣all,
doo fight against them with other militarie strata∣gems
(as we haue aboue declared) and doo ouercome
the forces of their aduersaries with their swiftnes and
great skill in matters of warre. For they doo assure
themselues, that if they be taken they shalbe deuoured:
and therefore with doubled courage they fight for
life, that they might ouercome, and in any case saue
their liues from that fierce and cruell nation. And
in this sorte doo they maintaine continuall warre, al∣wayes
with great mortalitie on both sides. These 
Agags

dwell at the beginning of the Riuer 
Nilus,
 (where it




runneth 
Northwardes
 out of the 
Lake,)
 vpon both the
bankes of the Riuer, till it come to a certaine limite,
wherein they are bounded, and then 
Westwardes
 all o∣uer
the banks of the said 
Nilus,
 euen to the second 
Lake,

& to the borders of the empire of 
Prete-Gianni.
 Touch∣ing
these 
Agags,
 I thought it conuenient in this place to
adde all this, which before I had omitted. Between
the confines of this 
Moenemugi,
 and 
Prete-Gianni,
 there
are sundry other pettie 
Lordes,
 and people that are of a
white colour, and yeeld obedience sometimes to one
of these two 
Princes,
 and sometimes to the other.
They are men of a farre greater stature then
all the rest of the people in those
Countries.

spring thereof.


A
Nd now to returne to our
former treatise of the coast,
beyond the Realme of 
Me∣linde,

towardes the 
Cape
 of

Guarda-Fuy,
 there are many
places inhabited with 
Ma∣hometans,

all along the sea
side, of colour being white.
Vpon this shoare there are
diuers good hauens,
 where
the shippes of sundry countries doo trafficke with the
foresaide marchaundises. The first of these places is
called 
Patee,
 the seconde 
Braua,
 the third 
Magadoxo,

the fourth 
Affion,
 and the last is the famous 
Promontory

and 
Cape
 of 
Guarda-Fuy:
 which because it is very great,
and iutteth out a good way into the sea, is wel knowen
to all saylers that come from 
India,
 and from 
Ormuz,
 &




from 
Arabia Foelix.
 It is the place and harborough
where the 
Portingalles
 are wont to attend, and yearely
with their nauies to watch for the vesselles of the 
Ma∣hometans,

that being laden with precious marchaundi∣ses,
doo saile into those partes without their licence,
they being the Lordes of the trafficke and trade for
spicery and all other commodities that are brought
from 
India.
 So that euery yeare the 
Portingall Fleete

doth take great prises of Marchauntes shippes in that
place, as the 
English
 and the 
French
 doo at 
Cape Saint
Vincent.


After you haue compassed about the foresaid 
Cape

of 
Guarda-Fuy,
 towarde the redde sea, you shall come
to other Townes and hauens of the 
Mahometans.
 The
first of them is called 
Methe,
 and another beyond that
called 
Barbora.
 And this is the furthest place, wherein
you shall finde any people with white skinnes: for
here the men beginne to bee all blacke. Then there
is 
Ceila,
 & 
Dalaca,
 and 
Malaca,
 and 
Carachin:
 and all this
Coast is called in that Countrey language 
Baragiam.

The people that inhabite therein are all blacke, valiant
in armes, and apparelled from the girdle downewards
with cloth of 
Cotton:
 but those that are of the best ac∣count
among them doo weare vppon their shoulders
certaine cloakes with whoodes, called 
Bernussi,
 such as
the olde 
Romanes
 vsed, and were termed 
Saga Romana.

It aboundeth in 
Gold,
 and in 
Iuory,
 and in Mettalles, &
in victuailes of all sortes.


Then follow the mouthes or entrances into the red

Gulfe,
 otherwise called the 
Redde Sea,
 well knowen to
euery man. In number they are two, caused by an

Islande
 that lyeth betweene them, and is called 
Babel∣mandel.





The one of them towards the 
West
 is fifteene
miles broade,
 and hath a deep channell, and through
this doo all the great shippes enter: the other is a little
one, and contayneth in breadth but fiue miles, and
yet is full of shallowes and shelfes of sande, and some
Rockes: so that the whole mouth is but thirtie myles
in all. The one 
Cape
 on the side of 
Africa
 is called

Rosbel,
 and the other towardes 
Arabia Foelix,
 is 
Ara.

From this place all the 
Westerne
 Coast of the said 
Gulfe

runneth vp to 
Suez,
 which is the farthest towne there∣of

Northwardes,
 and is distant from these mouthes
twelue hundred miles. All this 
Gulfe,
 both on the
one side and on the other neere to the bankes, is much
pestered with 
Islettes
 and shelfes that are very shallow,
and affordeth free and safe nauigation but onely in the
middest. For the sea following the motion & streame
of the 
Ocean,
 with great swiftnes doth keepe the chan∣nell
and the bottome in the middle, very cleane and
neat, by casting vp the filth and sande vpon the bankes
on both sides.


And now forasmuch as we are to speake of the Em∣pire
of 
Prete Gianni,
 who is the greattest and the rich∣est
Prince in all 
Africa,
 let vs tell you in briefe, that his

State
 and 
Gouernement
 at this day reacheth from the
two mouthes of the redde sea, vnto the 
Island
 of 
Syene,

which is vnder the 
Tropike
 of 
Cancer,
 excepting the
Coastes of the said sea. For about fiftie yeares ago he
lost them by negligence, and suffered the 
Turke
 to take
them from him. So that the Confines of his estate
are these, viz. towards the 
North-East,
 and the 
East,
 the
greater parte of the 
Red Sea:
 towards the 
North, Aegypt:





towardes the 
West,
 the Desertes of 
Nubia,
 and towards
the 
South
 the countrey of 
Mohenemugi:
 & so in a grosse
and generall account, the Empire of this 
Christian King

may happely bee in compasse some foure thousand
miles. The principall Cittie, where hee most remay∣neth
and keepeth his Court,
 is called 
Bel-Malechi.
 He
ruleth ouer many Prouinces that haue their seuerall
Kinges.
 His estate is very rich, and aboundeth in

Golde,
 in 
Siluer,
 in precious stones, and in all sortes of
mettalles. His people are of diuers colours, as white,
blacke, and a middle colour betweene both: they are
of a very good stature, and haue good countenances.
His Courtiers and Lordes are apparelled with cloth
of 
Silke,
 and adorned with 
Golde
 and sundry Iewelles.
There is among them a lawe for apparell,
 according
to the seuerall degrees of men. For certaine persons
there are, for whome it is not lawfull to weare any o∣ther
garment, but such as are made of dressed skins.


These people are in a manner 
Christians.
 For
they doo obserue certaine ceremonies of the Lawe
of the 
Hebrewes.
 Vpon the Feast day of our 
Ladie
 in

August,
 all the Kinges and principall Lordes assemble
themselues together in the Cittie aforesaid, to celebrate
that feast, euery man bringing with him his tribute
that he oweth to the King, and the people comming
from all partes in pilgrimage to performe this their de∣uotion.
They haue a very solemne procession, and
out of the 
Church,
 from whence they walke, they carry
with them an 
Image
 of the Blessed 
Virgin
 the 
Mother
 of

God,
 which is as bigge as any common person, and all
of 
Gold.
 This 
Image
 hath for the eyes two very rich




and great 
Rubies,
 all the rest of the bodie is garnished &
adorned with iewels and curious workes: and it is car∣ryed
vpon a frame made of 
Golde,
 of a wonderfull and
admirable workmanshippe. In this procession also,
there commeth abroade in publike shew 
Prete Gianni,

himselfe, eyther vpon a Charriot of 
Gold,
 or els vpon
an 
Elephant,
 all garnished and trimmed with iewelles,
and such rare and precious thinges, and couered all
ouer with cloth of 
Golde.
 The multitude of people
that runneth to see this 
Image,
 is so great, that many
are stiffled in the presse and die therevpon.


This King is called by a corrupt terme 
Prete Iani,

for the right name is 
Bel-Gian.
 Now 
Bel
 signifieth
that which is chiefest, perfectest, and excellentest in a∣nything,
and 
Gian
 is a 
Prince,
 or a 
Lorde,
 and is applyed
to euery man that hath a 
Gouernement
 and iurisdiction,
and therefore 
Belgian
 is asmuch to say, as 
The Chiefest
Prince:
 and being so ioyned together in one worde,
it appertayneth to the King alone, and to no man else.
He beareth also the surname of 
Dauid,
 as the 
Emperours

of 
Rome
 doo vse the name of 
Cesars.


Now it remayneth that we doo discourse of the ri∣uer

Nilus,
 which doth not spring in the Countrye of

Bel-Gian,
 much lesse out of the mountains of the 
Moone,

nor (as 
Ptolomie
 writeth) out of the two 
Lakes,
 which he
setteth down in 
Parallele,
 from the 
East
 to the 
West,
 with
a distaunce of about foure hundred and fiftie miles be∣tweene
them. For in the altitude of the same 
Pole,

wherein the said Authour placeth those two 
Lakes,
 ly∣eth
also the kingdome of 
Congo
 and of 
Angola
 towards
the 
West,
 and and on the other side 
Eastward
 is the Em∣pire
of 
Monomotapa,
 and the Kingdome of 
Sofala,
 with




a distaunce from sea to sea of twelue hundred miles.
Now within all this space, as 
Signor Odoardo
 affirmed
vnto me, there is but one onely 
Lake
 to bee founde,
which lyeth in the confines of 
Angola
 and 
Monomotapa,

and contayneth in 
Diameter
 an hundred ninetie and
fiue miles. Of the 
Westerne
 side of this 
Lake,
 the peo∣ple
of 
Angola
 do giue sufficient information, and of
the other side 
Eastwarde,
 those of 
Sofala
 and 
Monomota∣pa.

So that there is a ful and perfect knowledge of this
one 
Lake,
 but of any other thereabouts, there is no
mention at all made: And therefore it may well bee
concluded, that there are none other to be founde in
that altitude of degrees, True it is in deede, that there
are two 
Lakes,
 but they are situate in places quite con∣trary
to that which 
Ptolemie
 writeth. For he (as it hath
beene told you) placeth his 
Paralleles
 from 
West
 to 
East:

but these are situate from the 
South
 to the 
North,
 as it
were in a direct line, with the distance of about foure
thousand miles betweene them. Some that dwell in
those countries do holde an opinion,
 that 
Nilus
 after it
is issued out of the first 
Lake,
 hideth it selfe vnder the
grounde, and afterwardes riseth againe: but others
doo deny that it is so. 
Signor Odoardo
 did iustifie it to
me, that the true history and certainty of this matter,
is that 
Nilus
 doth not hide it selfe vnder the grounde,
but that it runneth through monstrous and desert val∣leyes
without any setled channell, and where no
people inhabiteth,
 and so (they say) it sinketh into the
bottome of the earth.


From this first 
Lake
 in deed doth 
Nilus
 spring, which
lyeth in twelue degrees towardes the 
Pole Antarctike,
 &
is compassed about like a vault, with exceeding high




mountaines, the greatest whereof are called 
Cafates
 vp∣on
the 
East,
 and the hilles of 
Sal-Nitrum,
 and the hilles
of 
Siluer
 on another side, and lastly with diuers other
Mountaines on the thirde part. This Riuer 
Nilus
 run∣neth
for the space of 400. miles directly towardes
the 
North,
 and then entreth into another verye great

Lake
 which the inhabitantes doo call a 
Sea.
 It is much
bigger then the first, for it contayneth in breadth two
hundred and twentie miles, and lyeth vnder the line

Equinoctiall.
 Of this second 
Lake
 the 
Anzichi,
 who
are neere neighbours to 
Congo,
 doo giue very certaine
and perfect information, for they trafficke into those
partes.
 And they report that in this 
Lake
 there is a peo∣ple,
that sayleth in great shippes, and can write, and
vseth number, and weight and measure, which they
haue not in the partes of 
Congo;
 that they builde their
houses with stone and lime, and that for their fashions
and qualities they may bee compared with the 
Portin∣galles.

Wherevpon it may bee well gathered, that
the Empire of 
Prete-Gianni
 cannot bee farre from
thence.


From this second 
Lake
 the riuer 
Nilus
 runneth for∣wardes
to the 
Islande
 of 
Meroe,
 for the space of seauen
hundred miles, and receyueth into it sundry other ri∣uers.

The principall of them all is the riuer 
Coluez,
 so
called, because it issueth out of a 
Lake
 of the same name,
and situate in the borders of 
Melinde.
 After that 
Nilus

is come to 
Meroe,
 it deuideth it selfe into two braun∣ches,
and so compasseth about a good high Territory,
which is called 
Meroe▪
 Vpon the right hand whereof
towardes the 
East,
 there runneth a Riuer named 
Abag∣ni,

that springeth out of the 
Lake Bracina,
 and crosseth




ouer the Empire of 
Prete Gianni
 till you come to
the said 
Islande:
 and on the other side 
Westwarde
 there
are diuers other Riuers,
 among which 
Saraboe
 is one.
When 
Nilus
 hath thus receiued these riuers into it, &
hath compassed the 
Islande
 with both his armes, hee
waxeth greater then he was before, and meeteth againe
in one channell, and by 
Aethiopia
 (which is called 
Ae∣thiopia

aboue 
Aegypt)
 runneth to the 
Falles
 (as they call
them) which lie in a very lowe valley, that is very nar∣rowe
and straite, and shutteth the riuer within a very
little channell,
 so that it falleth from aloft downewards
with a most horrible noyse, neere to the 
Isle
 of 
Syene.

And from thence watring all 
Aegypt,
 it disgorgeth his
streames into the 
Mediterranean
 sea,
 (which lyeth di∣rectly
ouer against the 
Islande
 of 
Cyprus)
 by two of his
principall braunches, the one called at this day, the

Mouth of Damiata
 on the 
East,
 and the other, the 
Mouth

of 
Rossetto
 on the 
West.


And forasmuch as wee are nowe come to the very
ende of this discourse concerning 
Nilus,
 it will be very
conuenient,
 that wee touch in briefe the occasion of
his encrease. As we haue tolde you before, the prin∣cipall
cause of the encrease of 
Nilus,
 is the great quan∣tity
of waters, that raine from heauen at such time as
the spring beginneth here in these countries, but there
with them in winter, which may be (to speake gene∣rally)
about the beginning of 
April.
 This water falleth
not, as the water falleth in these Regions of 
Europe,
 but
it falleth most aboundantly, and commeth downe not
in smal drops like our raine, but is powred down (as it
were with pailes and buckets.) So that because it falleth
with so great violence and in so great a quantity, the




earth cannot sucke it vp, nor drink it in: for the ground
being ragged, and somewhat bending downward, the
water scowreth away with an exceeding furie, and
running into the riuers causeth them to swell and to
rise in a maruellous manner, and so ouerflowe the coun∣trey:
You must herewithall consider especially, that
they haue these continuall raines for the space of fiue
whole Moones together, that is to say in 
Aprill, May,
Iune, Iuly,
 and 
August,
 but principally in 
May, Iune
 and

Iuly:
 for then are the waters in their greatest pride. And
herevpon it commeth to passe, that the Countrey be∣ing
full of mountaines and very high hilles (as hath
beene told you) and consequently replenished with
diuers brookes, and rillets, and 
Lakes,
 they all ioyning
and meeting together in the channelles of the greater
Riuers, doo make them so great and so large, that they
containe and carry more water, then all the Riuers of
the vniuersall worlde: and the 
Lakes
 growe to such an
excessiue compasse and widenes, that it is a wonder:
as may be seene in the discourse touching the 
Cape
 of

Good-Hope,
 and all these kingdomes of 
Congo,
 and the
Countreyes there adioyning, where there are 
Lakes
 of
so extraordinarie a bignesse, that in the languages of
those Regions, they are not called 
Lakes,
 but 
Seas.


And thus you see how the Riuer 
Nilus,
 in the times
and seasons before mentioned,
 on the one side doeth
runne most furiously from those Countries, into the

North
 to water 
Aegypt,
 and the Riuer 
Zaire,
 and the Ri∣uer

Nigir
 on the other side 
Westwarde
 and 
Eastwarde:

and towardes the 
South,
 other huge and monstrous Ri∣uers,
which at certaine determined and limited times
doo neuer faile to encrease as 
Nilus
 doeth. And this




is the effect of them, which is ordinarily seene euery
yeare, especially in 
Cairo,
 and ouer all 
Aegypt,
 where

Nilus
 beginneth to ryse about the ende of 
Iune,
 and
continueth his rising till the twentith of 
September,
 as I
haue seene my selfe. But the occasion and cause of this
encrease hath beene vntill this present time very secret
and obscure:
 and although the ancient writers, begin∣ning
euen at 
Homere,
 haue after a sorte and in generall
tearmes leaft in writing, that 
Nilus
 doeth increase by
raine, yet haue they not so distinctly and plainely dis∣coursed
thereof, as 
Signor Odoardo
 hath done, and te∣stified
the same by his owne view and knowledge. For
some there were, that haue assigned the cause of this
ouerflowing, to bee the raine that commeth from the
Mountaines of the 
Moone:
 Others haue attributed it
to the snowes that are melted in those Mountaines, &
yet 
Nilus
 doth not swell or ryse any thing neere to the
Mountaines of the 
Moone,
 but a great way from them
towards the 
North:
 and besides that the season of win∣ter
doeth rather breed Snow, then yeeld any heate to
melt it.


And now that I haue with good diligence enqui∣red
of 
Signor Odoardo
 these matters aboue written,
 vp∣on
such pointes as I had before plotted to my selfe, and
hee also propounding the rest vnto mee of his owne
meere motion, like a man of high conceite (as in truth
he is) and satisfying me with such aunsweres, as are set
downe in this discourse: yet I doo assure my selfe, that
euery man will not rest fully contented and satisfyed
herewith, especially such as are curious, and practised
in matters of the worlde, and skilfull in the Sciences.
The 
Geographer
 woulde peraduenture desire to vnder∣stand




more, and the 
Phisician,
 and the maister of 
Mine∣ralles,

and the 
Historiographer,
 and the 
Marchaunt,
 and
the 
Marriner,
 and the 
Preacher,
 and some others that
are different from these in respect of their profession.
But 
Signor Odoardo
 hath promised with as much speed
as possible he may to returne to 
Rome
 from 
Congo,
 whe∣ther
he sayled, presently after he had finished this trea∣tise,
which was in 
May
 1589. with very ample infor∣mations
and further instructions, for the supplying of
that which here wanteth touching 
Nilus,
 and his origi∣nall,
and such other matter. In the meane time, that
little which is contayned in these few leaues, is not ve∣ry
little. But yet if perhaps there be any thing found
therein, that may be eyther profitable, or straunge, or
delightfull, or fit to passe away the time, and to driue
away Melancholie, let it bee wholly ascribed to the
right noble and Reuerend Father, my 
Lorde Antonie
Migliore, Bishop
 of 
San Marco,
 and 
Commenda∣dor

of 
Santo Spirito,
 who was the authour
of this worke to be published
for the common
benefit.
