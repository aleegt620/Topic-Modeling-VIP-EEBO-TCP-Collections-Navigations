A true Relation of a Voyage, upon discovery of part of the Coast of FLORI∣DA, from the Lat. of 31 Deg. to 33 Deg. 45 m. North Lat. in the Ship 
Adventure, William Hilton
 Commander, and Com∣missioner with Captain 
Anthony Long
 and 
Peter Fabian;
 set forth by several Gentlemen and Merchants of the Island of 
Barbadoes;
 sailed from 
Spikes
 Bay, 
Aug.
 10. 1663.


A
FTER Sixteen days of fair wea∣ther, and▪ prosperous windes, 
Wednesday
 the 26 instant, four of the clock in the Afternoon, God be thanked, we espied Land on the Coast of 
Florida,
 in the lat. of 32 deg. 30 min. being four Leagues or thereabouts to the Northwards of Saint 
Ellens,
 having run five hundred and fifty Leagues;


and to the Westward of the Meridian of 
Barbadoes,
 three hundred thirty and one Leagues. This Evening and the Night following we lay off and on: 
Thurs∣day
 the 27th instant, in the morning, we stood in with the Land, and coasted the Shoar to the South∣ward, Ankering at Nights, and sending our Boat out a Mornings, till we came into the lat. of 31 deg. but found no good harbour that way. On 
Sun∣day
 the 30th instant, we tacked, and stood North∣ward: and on 
Wednesday
 the second of 
September,
 we came to an Anchor in five fathoms at the mouth of a very large opening of three Leagues wide, or therea∣bouts, in the lat. of 32 deg. 30 min. and sent our Boat to sound the Channel. On 
Thursday
 the third, we entered the Harbour, and found that it was the River 
Jordan,
 and was but four Leagues or therea∣bouts N. E. from 
Port Royal,
 which by the 
Spanyards
 is called St. 
Ellens:
 within Land, both Rivers meet in one. We spent some time to sound the Chanels both without and within, and to search the Rivers in several branches, and to view the Land. On 
Saturday
 the fifth of 
September,
 two 
Indians
 came on Board us from the N. E. shoar, whom we entertain∣ed courteously, and afterwards set them on shoar. On 
Sunday
 the sixth, several 
Indians
 came on Board us, and said they were of St. 
Ellens;
 being very bold and familiar; speaking many 
Spanish
 words, as, 
Cappitan, Commarado,
 and 
Adues.
 They know the use of Guns, and are as little startled at the firing of a Peece of Ordnance, as he that hath been used to them many years: they told us the nearest 
Spanyards
 were at St. 
Augustins,
 and several of them had been there, which as they said was but ten days journey; and


that the 
Spanyards
 used to come to them at Saint 
Ellens,
 sometimes in Canoa's within Land, at other times in small Vessels by Sea, which the 
Indians
 describe to have but two Masts. They invited us to come to St. 
Ellens
 with our Ship, which they told us we might do within Land. 
Munday
 the 14 
September,
 our Long-Boat went with twelve hands within Land to St. 
Ellens.
 On 
Wednesday
 the 16th, came five 
Indians
 on board us; one of them pointing to another, said, he was the Grandy Captain of 
Edistow:
 whereupon we took especial notice of him, and entertained him accordingly, giving him several Beads, & other trade that pleased him well: He invited us to bring up our Ship into a branch on the N. E. side, and told us of one Captain 
Francisco,
 and four more English that were in his custody on shoar; whereupon we shew∣ed him store of all Trade, as Beads, Hoes, Hatchets and Bills, &c. and said, he should have all those things if he would bring the English on board us; which he promised should be done the next day. Here∣upon we wrote a few lines to the said 
English,
 fearing it to be a 
Spanish
 delusion to entrap us. In the dark of the same Evening came a Canoa with nine or ten 
In∣dians
 in her with their Bowes and Arrows, and were close on board before we did discern them: We ha∣led them, but they made us no answer, which increa∣sed our jealousie: So we commanded them on board, and disarmed them, detaining two of them prisoners, and sending away the rest to fetch the 
English;
 which if they brought, they should have theirs again. At length they delivered us a Note written with a coal, which seemed the more to continue our jealousie, be∣cause in all this time we had no news of our long-boat


from St. 
Ellens,
 which we feared was surpri∣zed by the 
Indians
 and 
Spanyards.
 But to satisfie us that there were 
English
 on shoar, they sent us one man on board about twelve of the clock in the Night who related to us the truth of the matter, and told us they were cast away some four or five leagues to the North-ward of the place we then rode, on the 24th of 
July
 past, being thirteen persons that came on shoar, whereof three of them were kill'd by the 
Indians.
 On 
Thursday
 the 17th of 
September
 the Long-boat returned from St. 
Ellens,
 which presently we sent on shoar to fetch the other 
English,
 the 
Indians
 delivering us three more; and coming abroad them∣selves, we delivered them their two men. Then we demanded of the chief Commander where the rest of our 
English
 were: he answered, Five were carried to St. 
Ellens,
 three were killed by the 
Stonohs,
 and the other man we should have within two dayes. We replyed to him again, That we would keep him and two more of his chief men, till we had our 
English
 that were yet living; and promised them their li∣berty, with satisfaction for bringing us the 
English.
 Now to return to the businesse of our Design; the entertainment we had at S. 
Ellens
 put us in great fear of the 
Indians
 treachery; for we observed their con∣tinual gathering together, and at last began with stern-look'd countenances to speak roughly to us, and came to search our mens Bandileers and Pockets; yet inviting us to stay that night with them: but we made a sudden retreat to our Boat, which caused the 
Indian
 King to be in a great rage, speaking loud and angry to his men; the drift of which discourse we understood not. That which we noted there, was a


fair house builded in the shape of a Dove-house, round, two hundred foot at least, compleatly cover∣ed with 
Palmeta
-leaves, the wal-plate being twelve foot high, or thereabouts, & within lodging Rooms and Forms; two pillars at the entrance of a high Seat above all the rest: Also another house like a Sentinel-house, floored ten foot high with planks, fastned with Spikes and Nayls, standing upon sub∣stantial Posts, with several other small houses round about. Also we saw many planks, to the quantity of three thousand foot or thereabouts, with other Tim∣ber squared, and a Cross before the great house. Likewise we saw the Ruines of an old Fort, compas∣sing more than half an acre of land within the Tren∣ches, which we supposed to be 
Charls
's Fort, built, and so called by the 
French
 in 1562, &c. On 
Mon∣day, September
 21. one English youth was brought from St. 
Ellens
 aboard us by an 
Indian,
 who inform∣ed us that there were four more of their company at St. 
Ellens,
 but he could not tell whether the 
Indians
 would let them come to us: For saith he, Our Men told me, that they had lately seen a Frier and two 
Spany∣ards
 more at St. 
Ellens,
 who told them they would send Soldiers suddenly to fetch them away. This day we sayled up the River with our Ship to go through to St. 
Ellens.
 On 
Tuesday
 the 22 instant, three 
Indians
 came on board; one of them we sent with a Letter to the 
English
 Prisoners there. On 
Wednesday
 the 23d. we sent out Boat and Men to sound the Chanel, and finde out the most likely way to St. 
Ellens
 with our Ship by 
Combeheh.
 In the mean time came many Canoa's aboard us with Corn, Pumpions, and Ve∣nison, Deer-skins, and a sort of sweet-wood. One


of our men looking into an 
Indian
 basket, found a piece of 
Spanish
 Rusk: it being new, we demanded of the 
Indian
 where he had it; who said, Of the 
Spani∣ards.
 In the interim, while we were talking, came a Canoa with four 
Indians
 from St. 
Ellens,
 one stand∣ing up, and holding a paper in a cleft stick; they told us they had brought it from the 
Spanish
 Captain at St. 
Ellens.
 We demanded how many 
Spaniards
 were come thither; who said, Seven, and one 
Eng∣lish-man:
 We received their Letter writ in 
Spanish,
 but none of us could read it: We detained two of the chiefest 
Indians,
 one of them being the Kings Son of S. 
Ellens,
 and that kept one of the 
English
 priso∣ners▪ the other two we sent away with a Letter to the 
Spaniard,
 wherein we gave him to understand, that we understood not his letter; and told the 
Indi∣ans,
 when they brought the 
English,
 they should have their men again, with satisfaction for their pains. On 
Thursday,
 24 instant, we sayling further up the River to go through, at last came to a place of fresh water, and Anchored there, sending our Boat ashoar with a Guard to get water. Towards night came the first 
Indian
 that we sent to St. 
Ellens
 with a letter to the 
English,
 who brought us another letter from the 
Spaniards,
 and an Answer of ours from the 
English,
 writ in the 
Spaniards
 letter. The 
Spaniard
 sent us a quarter of Venison, and a quarter of Pork, with a Complement, That he was sorry he had no more for us at that time. We returned him thanks, and sent him a Jug of Brandy; and withal, that we were sorry we understood not his letter. This night about twelve of the Clock we had a most violent gust of winde, but of no long


continuance. On 
Friday
 25 
September,
 we weighed, and returned down the River six leagues, or therea∣bouts, because we perceived the 
Indians
 had gather∣ed themselves in a Body from all parts thereabouts, and moved as the Ship did: and being informed by an 
Indian,
 that the 
Spaniards
 would be there the next day; we took in Fire-wood, and continued there that night, at which time one of our 
Indian
 Prison∣ers made his escape by leaping over-board in the dark. On 
Saturday
 the 26. we weighed, and stood down to the Harbours mouth, and stayed there till 
Monday
 the 28. In all which time came no one to us, though we stay'd in expectation of their coming con∣tinually; therefore put out to Sea, concluding their intentions not to be good. Being out of the River 
Jordan,
 we directed our course S. W. four leagues or thereabouts for 
Port-Royal,
 to sound the Chanel without from the poynts of the Harbour outwards; for we had sounded the Harbour within from the points inward when our Boat was at St. 
Ellens:
 And now being athwart the Harbours mouth, we sent our Boat with the Mate and others, who found the N. E. and E. N. E. side of the opening of 
Port-Royal
 to be Sholes and Breakers to the middle of the open∣ing; and three leagues or thereabouts into the Sea, from the side aforesaid, is unsafe to meddle with: but the S. W. and W. side we found all bold steering in N. N. W. two or three miles from the S. W. shoar, sayling directed with the S. W. head-land of the en∣trance of 
Port-Royal:
 the said head-land is bluft, and seems steep, as though the trees hung over the wa∣ter: But you must note, that if you keep so far from the S. W. side, that you stand in N. N. W. with


the bluft head aforesaid, you shall go over the Out∣skirt of the E. N. E. sholing, and shall have but three or four fathom for the space of one league or thereabouts, and then you shall have six and seven fathoms all the way in: But if you borrow more on the S. W. side, till you have brought the S. W. head of the Entry to bear N. N. E. you shall have a fair large Chanel of six, seven, and eight fathoms all the way in, and then five, six, seven and eight fa∣thoms within the Harbour, keeping the Chanel, and standing over to the Northward: we supposed that it flows here as at the River 
Jordan,
 because they are but four leagues asunder, and flows S. E. and N. W. seven foot and half, and sometimes eight foot perpendicular: the Mouth of 
Port-Royal
 lyes in 32 deg. 20 min. lat. Now as concerning the entrance of the River 
Jordan,
 lat. 32 deg. 30 min. or there∣abouts, you shall see a range of Breakers right a∣gainst the opening, two or three leagues off the S. W. Point; which you must leave to the Northward, and steer in with the said S. W. Point, giving a range of Breakers that runs from the said Point a small birth, and you shall have two, three, and four fa∣thoms at low water; and when you come one mile from the Point aforesaid, steer over directly to the N. E. Point, and you shall have six or seven fathom all the way. VVithin the 
N. W.
 Point is good An∣choring: you shall have five fathoms fair aboard the shoar: and you shall have five, six, seven, and eight fathoms, sayling all along upon the River, ten leagues, and a large turning Chanel: It flows here 
S. E.
 and 
N. W.
 seven foot and a half, and eight foot at common Tydes. The River 
Grandy,
 or as the 
In∣dians



call it 
Edistow,
 lyes six leagues or thereabouts from the River 
Jordan,
 and seems to be a very fair o∣pening: but because the chief 
Indian
 of that Place was on board us, and the Countrey all in Arms, we not knowing how the winde might crosse us, it was not thought fit to stay there: But some of those 
English
 that had lived there, being Prisoners, say, that it is a very fair and goodly River, branching in∣to several branches, and deep, and is fresh water at low Tide within two leagues of the Mouth; it seem∣ing to us as we passed by, a good entrance large and wide, lat. 32 deg. 40 min. in or thereabouts. Now our understanding of the Land of 
Port-Royal,
 River 
Jordan,
 River 
Grandie,
 or 
Edistow,
 is as followeth: The Lands are laden with large tall Oaks, VValnut and Bayes, except facing on the Sea, it is most Pines tall and good: The Land generally, except where the Pines grow, is a good Soyl, covered with black Mold, in some places a foot, in some places half a foot, and in other places lesse, with Clay under∣neath mixed with Sand; and we think may produce any thing as well as most part of the Indies that we have seen. The 
Indians
 plant in the worst Land, be∣cause they cannot cut down the Timber in the best, and yet have plenty of Corn, Pumpions, Water-Mellons, Musk-mellons: although the Land be o∣ver-grown with weeds through their lazinesse, yet they have two or three crops of Corn a year, as the 
Indians
 themselves inform us. The Country abounds with Grapes, large Figs, and Peaches; the Woods with Deer, Conies, Turkeys, Quails, Curlues, Plovers, Teile, Herons; and as the 
Indians
 say, in Winter, with Swans, Geese, Cranes, Duck


and Mallard, and innumerable of other water-Fowls, whose names we know not, which lie in the Rivers, Marshes, and on the Sands: Oysters in a∣bundance, with great store of Muscles; A sort of fair Crabs, and a round Shel▪fish called 
Horse▪feet;
 The Rivers stored plentifully with Fish that we saw play and leap. There are great Marshes, but most as far as we saw little worth, except for a Root that grows in them the 
Indians
 make good Bread of. The Land we suppose is healthful; for the 
English
 that were cast away on that Coast in 
July
 last, were there most part of that time of year that is sickly in 
Virgi∣nia;
 and notwithstanding hard usage, and lying on the ground naked, yet had their perfect healths all the time. The Natives are very healthful; we saw many very Aged amongst them. The Ayr is clear and sweet, the Countrey very pleasant and delight∣ful: And we could wish, that all they that want a happy settlement, of our 
English
 Nation, were well transported thither, &c.








FRom 
Tuesday
 the 29th of 
September,
 to 
Friday
 the second of 
October,
 we ranged along the shoar from the lat. 32 deg. 20 min. to the lat. 33 deg. 11 min. but could discern no Entrance for our Ship, after we had passed to the Northwards of 32 deg. 40 min. On 
Saturday
 the third instant, a vio∣lent storm came up, the winde between the North and the East; which Easterly windes and fowl wea∣ther continued till 
Monday
 the 12th. By reason of which storms and fowl weather, we were forced to get off to Sea to secure our selves and ship, and were horsed by reason of a strong Current, almost to Cape 
Hatterasse
 in lat. 35 deg. 30 min. On 
Monday
 the 12th aforesaid we came to an Anchor in seven fathom at 
Cape Fair-Road,
 and took the Meridian-Altitude of the Sun, and were in the lat. 33 deg. 43 min. the winde continuing still Easterly, and fowl weather till 
Thursday
 the 15th instant; and on 
Friday
 the 16th, the winde being at 
N. W.
 we weigh∣ed, and sailed up 
Cape Fair-River,
 some four or five leagues, and came to an Anchor in six or seven fa∣thom; at which time several 
Indian
 came on Board, and brought us great store of Fresh-fish, large Mul∣lets, young Bass, Shads, and several other sorts of very good well-tasted Fish. On 
Saturday
 the 17th, we went down to the Cape to see the English Cattel, but could not finde them, though we rounded the Cape: And having an 
Indian
 Guide with us, here we rode till the 24th instant; the winde being against


us, we could not go up the River with our Ship; in which time we went on shoar, and viewed the land of those quarters. On 
Saturday
 we weighed, and sayled up the River some four leagues or therea∣bouts. 
Sunday
 the 25th, we weighed again, and tow∣ed up the River, it being calm, and got up some fourteen leagues from the Harbours mouth, where we mored our Ship. On 
Monday
 the 26 
October,
 we went down with the Yoal to 
Necoes,
 an 
Indian
 Plan∣tation, and viewed the Land there. On 
Tuesday
 the 27th, we rowed up the main River with our long-Boat and twelve men, some ten leagues or therea∣bouts. On 
Wednesday
 the 28th, we rowed up about eight or nine leagues more. 
Thursday
 the 29th was foul weather, of much rain and winde, which for∣ced us to make Huts, and lye still. 
Friday
 the 30th, we proceeded up the main River, seven or eight leagues. 
Saturday
 the 31, we got up three or four leagues more, and came to a Tree that lay athwart the River: but because our Provisions were neer spent, we proceeded no further, but returned down∣ward the remainder of that day; and on 
Monday
 the second of 
November,
 we came aboard our Ship. 
Tues∣day
 the third, we lay still to refresh ourselves. On 
Wednesday
 the 4th, we went five or six leagues up the River to search a branch that ran out of the main River towards the 
N. W.
 In which branch we went up five or six leagues: not liking the Land, we re∣turned on board that night about midnight, and called that place 
Swampy-branch. Thursday
 the fifth in∣stant, we staid aboard; on 
Friday
 the 6th we went up 
Greens
 River, the mouth of it being against the place we rode with our Ship. On 
Saturday
 the 7th, we


proceeded up the said River some fourteen or fifteen leagues in all, and found that it ended in several small branches; the Land for the most part being marshy and swamps, we returned towards our ship, and got aboard in the night: 
Sunday
 the 8th instant we lay still, and on 
Monday
 the 9th we went again up the main River, being well provided with Pro∣visions and all things necessary, and proceeded up∣wards till 
Thursday
 noon 12th instant, at which time we came to a place where two Islands were in the middle of the River, and by reason of the crooked∣nesse of the 
River
 at that place, several Trees lay a∣thwart both branches, which stopped up the passage of each branch, that we could proceed no further with our Boat; but we went up the River side by land some three or four miles, and found the River to enlarge it self: So we returned, leaving it as far as we could see up a long reach running N. E. we judging our selves from the Rivers mouth North near fifty leagues; we returned, viewing the Land on both sides the River, and found as good tracts of land, dry, well wooded, pleasant and delightful as we have seen any where in the world, with great burthen of Grasse on it, the land being very level, with steep banks on both sides the River, and in some places very high, the woods stor'd with abun∣dance of Deer and Turkies every where; we never going on shoar, but saw of each also Partridges great store, Cranes abundance, Comes, which we saw in several places; we heard several Wolves howling in the woods, and saw where they had torn a Deer in pieces. Also in the River we saw great store of Ducks, T
ile, VVidgeon, and in the woods great flocks of


Parrakeeto's; the Timber that the woods afford for the most part consisting of Oaks of four or five sorts, all differing in leaves, but all bearing Akorns very good: we measured many of the Oaks in several pla∣ces, which we found to be in bignesse some tvvo, some three, and others almost four fathoms; in height, before you come to boughs or limbs, forty, fifty, sixty foot, and some more, and those Oaks very common in the upper parts of both Rivers; Also a very tall large Tree of great bignesse, which some do call 
Cyprus,
 the right name we know not, growing in Swamps. Likewise Walnut, Birch, Beech, Ma∣ple, Ash, Bay, Willough, Alder and Holly; and in the lowermost parts innumerable of Pines, tall and good for boards or masts, growing for the most part in barren sandy ground, but in some places up the River in good ground, being mixed amongst Oaks and other Timber. We saw several Mulberry∣trees, multitudes of Grape-Vines, and some Grapes which we did eat of. VVe found a very large and good tract of Land on the N. W. side of the River, thin of Timber, except here and there a very great Oak, and full of Grasse, commonly as high as a mans middle, and in many places to his shoulders, where we saw many Deer and Turkies; also one Deer with very large horns, and great in body, therefore called it 
Stag-Park▪
 it being a very pleasant and delightful place, we travelled in it several miles, but saw no end thereof. So we returned to our Boat, and pro∣ceeded down the River, and came to another place some twenty five leagues from the Rivers mouth on the same side, where we found a place no lesse delightful than the former▪ and as far as we


could judge, both Tracts came into one. This low∣er place we called 
Rocky-point,
 because we found ma∣ny Rocks and Stones of several bignesse upon the Land, which is not common. We sent our Boat down the River before us; our selves travelling by Land many miles, were so much taken with the pleasantnesse of the Land, that travelling into the woods so far, we could not recover our Boat and company that night. On 
Sunday
 the morrow follow∣ing we got to our Boat, and on 
Monday
 the 16th of 
November,
 we proceeded down to a place on the East-side of the River some twenty three leagues from the Harbours mouth, which we call'd 
Turkie-Quarters,
 because we killed several Turkies there∣abouts. VVe viewed the Land there, and found some tracts of good Land, and high, facing upon the River about one mile inward, but backwards some two miles all Pine-land, but good pasture-ground: we returned to our Boat, and proceeded down some two or three leagues, where we had formerly view∣ed, and found it a tract of as good Land as any we have seen, with as good Timber on it. The banks of the River being high, therefore we called it 
High-Land Point.
 Having viewed that, we proceeded down the River, going on shoar in several places on both sides▪ it being generally large Marshes, and many of them dry, that they may more fitly be called Medows: the wood-land against them is for the most part Pine, and in some places as barren as ever we saw Land, but in other places good Pasture▪ground, And on 
Tuesday
 the 17th instant, we got aboard our Ship, riding against the mouth of 
Green
's River, where our men are providing wood, and fitting the


Ship for the Sea: In the interim, we took some view of the Land on both sides of the River there, finding some good Land, but more bad, and the best not com∣parable to that above. 
Friday
 the 20th instant was foul weather, yet in the Afternoon we weighed, and went down the River some two leagues, and came to Anchor against the mouth of 
Hilton
's River, and took some view of the Land there on both sides, which appeared to us much like unto that at 
Green
's River. 
Monday
 23. we went with our Long-boat well victualled and manned up 
Hilton
's River; and when we came three leagues or thereabouts up the said River, we found this and 
Green
's River to come into one, and so continued for four or five leagues, which causeth a great Island betwixt them. We proceeded still up the River, till they parted a∣gain, keeping up 
Hilton
's River on the Lar-board side, and followed the said River five or six leagues further, where we found another large branch of 
Green
's River to come into 
Hilton
's, which maketh another great Island. On the Star-board side going up, we proceeded stil up the River some four leagues, and returned, taking a view of the Land on both sides, and now judge our selves to be from our ship some eighteen leagues 
W.
 and by 
W.
 One league be∣low this place came four 
Indians
 in a Canoa to us, and sold us several baskets of Akorns, which we sa∣tisfied for, and so left them; but one of them follow∣ed us on the shoar some two or three miles, till he came on the top of a high bank, facing on the 
River,
 we rowing underneath it, the said 
Indian
 shot an Arrow at us, which missed one of our men very nar∣rowly, and stuck in the upper edge of the Boat, which


broke in pieces, leaving the head behind. Hereup∣on we presently made to the shoar, and went all up the bank except four to guide the Boat; we searched for the 
Indian,
 but could not finde him: At last we heard some sing further in the Woods, which we thought had been as a Chalenge to us to come and fight them. We went towards them with all speed, but before we came in sight of them, we heard two Guns go off from our Boat, whereupon we retreat∣ed with all speed to secure our Boat and Men: when we came to them, we found all well, & demanded the reason of their firing the Guns: they told us that an 
Indian
 came creeping on the Bank as they thought to shoot at them, therefore shot at him a great distance with Swan-shot, but thought they did him no hurt, for they saw him run way. Presently after our re∣turn to the Boat, while we were thus talking, came two 
Indians
 to us with their Bows and Arrows, cry∣ing 
Bonny, Bonny:
 we took their Bows and Arrows from them, and gave them Beads, to their content. Then we led them by the hand to the Boat, and shew∣ed them the Arrow-head sticking in her side, and re∣lated to them the businesse; which when they under∣stood, both of them manifested much sorrow, and made us understand by signes, that they knew no∣thing of it: so we let them go, and marked a Tree on the top of the bank, calling the place 
Mount-Skerry.
 We looked up the River as far as we could discern, and saw that it widened it self, and came running directly down the Countrey: So we return∣ed, and viewed the Land on both sides the River, fin∣ding the banks steep in some places, but very high in others. The banks sides are generally Clay, and


as some of our company doth affirm, some Marle. The Land and Timber up this River is no way inferi∣our to the best in the other, which we call the main River: So far as we discovered, this seems as fair, if not fairer than the former, and we think runs further into the Countrey, because there is a strong Current comes down, and a great deal more drift-wood. But to return to the business of the Land and Timber: We saw several plats of Ground cleared by the 
Indi∣ans
 after their weak manner, compassed round with great Timber-Trees; which they are no ways able to fall, and so keep the Sun from their Corn-fields very much; yet neverthelesse we saw as large Corn-stalks or bigger, than we have seen any where else: So we proceeded down the River, till we found the Canoa the 
Indian
 was in who shot at us. In the morn∣ing we went on shoar, and cut the same in pieces: the 
Indians
 perceiving us coming towards them, run away. We went to his Hut, and pulled it down, brake his pots, platters, and spoons, tore his Deer∣skins and Mats in pieces, and took away a basket of Akorns: So we proceeded down the River two leagues, or thereabouts, and came to another place of 
Indians,
 bought Akorns and some Corn of them, and went downwards two leagues more: at last we espied an 
Indian
 peeping over a high bank: we held up a Gun at him; and calling to him, said, 
Skerry:
 presently several 
Indians
 appeared to us, making great signes of friendship, saying, 
Bonny, Bonny,
 and running before us, endeavouring to perswade us to come on shoar; but we answered them with stern countenances, and said, 
Skerry,
 taking up our guns, and threatning to shoot at them; but they cryed still



Bonny, Bonny:
 And when they saw they could not pre∣vail, nor perswade us to come on shoar, two of them came off to us in a Canoa, one padling with a great Cane, the other with his hand; they came to us, and laid hold of our Boat, sweating and blowing, and told us it was 
Bonny
 on shoar, and at last perswa∣ded us to go ashoar with them. As soon as we land∣ed, several 
Indians,
 to the number of near forty lusty men, came to us, all in a great sweat, and told us 
Bonny:
 we shewed▪ them the Arrow-head in the Boats-side, and a piece of the Canoa which we had cut in pieces: the chief man of them made a large Speech, and threw Beads into our Boat, which is a signe of great love and friendship; and made us to understand, when he heard of the Affront which we had received, it caused him to cry: and now he and his men were come to make peace with us, making signes to us that they would tye his Arms, and cut off his head that had done us that abuse; and for a further testimony of their love and good will towards us, they presented to us two very handsom propet young 
Indian
 women, the tallest that we have seen in this Countrey; which we supposed to be the Kings Daughters, or persons of some great account amongst them. These young women were ready to come into our Boat; one of them crouding in, was hardly per∣swaded to go out again. We presented to the King a Hatchet and several Beads, also Beads to the young women and to the chief men, and to the rest of the 
Indians,
 as far as our Beads would go: they promi∣sed us in four days to come on board our Ship, and so departed from us. When we left the place, which


was presently, we called it 
Mount-Bonny,
 because we had there concluded a firm Peace. Proceeding down the River two or three leagues further, we came to a place where were nine or ten Canoa's all together; we went ashoar there, and found several 
Indians,
 but most of them were the same which had made Peace with us before: We made little stay there, but went directly down the River, and came to our Ship before day. 
Thursday
 the 26th of 
No∣vember,
 the winde being at South, we could not go down to the Rivers mouth: but on 
Friday
 the 27th, we weighed at the mouth of 
Hilton
's River, and got down one league towards the Harbours mouth. On 
Sunday
 the 29th, we got down to 
Crane-Island,
 which is four leagues or thereabouts above the Entrance of the Harbours mouth. Now on 
Tuesday
 the first of 
December,
 we made a purchase of the River and land of 
Cape-Fair,
 of 
Wattcoosa,
 and such other 
Indians
 as appeared to us to be the chief of those parts: they brought us store of Fresh-fish aboard, as Mullets, Shads, and other very good Fish: this River is all Fresh-water fit to drink. Some eight leagues within the mouth, the Tide runs up about thirty five leagues, but stops and riseth a great deal farther up; it flowes at the Harbours mouth S. E. and N. W. six foot as Neap-Tides, and eight foot at Spring-Tides: the Chanel on the Easter-side by the 
Cape-shoar
 is the best, and lyes close aboard the 
Cape-land,
 being three fathoms at High-water, in the shallowest place in the Chanel just at the Entrance; but as soon as you are past that place half a Cables length inward, you shall have six or seven fathoms, a fair turning Cha∣nel into the River, and so continuing four or five


leagues upwards; afterwards the Chanel is more difficult in some places six or seven fathoms, four or five, and in other places but nine or ten foot, e∣specially where the River is broad. When the River comes to part, and grows narrow, there is all Cha∣nel from side to side in most places; in some places you shall have five, six, or seven fathoms, but ge∣nerally two or three, Sand and Oaze. We viewed the Cape-land, and judged it to be little worth, the Woods of it shrubby and low, the Land sandy and barren; in some places Grass and Rushes, and in other places nothing but clear sand: a place fitter to starve Cattel in our judgement, then to keep them alive; yet the 
Indians,
 as we understand, keep the 
English
 Cattle down there, and suffer them not to go off the said Cape, as we suppose, because the Countrey-
Indians
 shall have to part with them, and as we think, are fallen out about them, who shall have the greatest share. They brought aboard our Ship very good and fat Beef several times, which they could afford very reasonable; also fat and very large Swine, good cheap penny-worths: but they may thank their friends of 
New-England,
 who brought their Hogs to so fair a Market. Some of the 
Indians
 brought very good Salt aboard us, and made signes, pointing to both sides of the Rivers mouth, that there was great store thereabouts. We saw up the River several good places for the setting up of Corn or Saw-mills. In that time as our businesse called us up and down the River and Branches, we kill'd of wild∣fowl, four Swans, ten Geese, twenty nine Cranes, ten Turkies, forty Duck and Mallard, three dozen of Parrakeeto's, and six or seven dozen of other small Fowls, as Curlues and Plovers, &c.



VVHereas there was a Writing left in a Post at the Point of 
Cape-Fair
 River, by those 
New-England
-men that left Cattel with the 
Indians
 there, the Contents whereof tended not on∣ly to the disparagement of the Land about the said River, but also to the great discouragement of all those that should hereafter come into those Parts to settle: In Answer to that scandalous writing, We whose names are under-written do affirm, That we have seen facing on both sides of the River, and branches of 
Cape-Fair
 aforesaid, as good Land, and as well Timbred, as any we have seen in any other part of the world, sufficient to accommodate thousands of our 
English
 Nation, lying commodiously by the said River.


On 
Friday
 the 4th of 
December,
 the winde being fair, we put out to Sea, bound for 
Barbadoes;
 and on the 6th day of 
January,
 1663/4, we came to Anchor in 
Carlisle
-Bay; and after several known apparent dangers both by Sea and Land, have now brought us all in safety to our long-wish'd-for and much desi∣red Port, to render an Accompt of our Discovery, the verity of which we aver.

I Am come to this Town of Infidel-
Indians,
 to seek some 
English,
 which my Governour and Captain-General, 
Don Alonso de Arangows, de Colis,
 Cavallier, and Knight of the Order of St. 
James,
 for his Majesty, had notice that there was a Ship lost in that Port in which you are, that the men might not run any hazard of their lives, as those with me here have. 
Don Adeleyers,
 with the Governor of the Garison of S. 
Augustine,
 are gone to ransome and free the Subjects of the King your Ma∣ster, 
CHARLES
 the Second: Wherefore I advise you, that if these 
Indians
 (although Infidels and 
Bar∣barians)
 have not killed any of the Christians, and do require as a gift or courtesie for those four men, four Spades, and four Axes, some Knives, and some Beads, and the four 
Indians
 which you have there, you de∣liver them, and that for their sakes that shall sayl on this Coast: you may send a Boat, who when she comes athwart the Port of St. 
Ellens,
 may hoist an Ancient twice or thrice, and I will do the same. The shortnesse of the dispatch I desire, for I want pro∣vision for my Soldiers, and the way is large. Your Servant desires you would give me a speedy Answer; and what may be done in your service, I shall do very willingly: And if you have none that can in∣terpret the 
Spanish
 Tongue, you may write in your own, for here are your Countrey-men that can un∣derstand it: but if you can, let it be in 
Spanish.

A Copy of the 
Spanyard
's second Letter.


MY Governour and Capt. General, as soon as he had News that a Ship, by Nation 
English,
 was lost in that Port in which you now are, sent me with Soldiers of the Garison of St. 
Augustine
 in 
Flo∣rida,
 as they have at other times done, to free them from death; for which cause I came to this Port of St. 
Ellens,
 where I found all these 
Indians
 in a fright, fearing that you will do them some mis∣chief: So having found four men of those that were lost, I thought good to advise you, that you might carry them in your company, giving some gifts to those 
Indians
 which they desire; which is, four Spades, four Axes, some Knives, and some Beads. This they desire, not as payment, but onely as an acknowledgment of a kindness for having saved their lives; which they have always done as Naturals who have given their obedience to the King our Ma∣ster. And they do also desire you to let go those four 
Indians
 which are there: You may send a Boat when you discover the Points of St. 
Ellens;
 may hoist an Ancient two or three times, and I will do the same. I desire your Answer may be sodain; for I am scarce of Provisions, and the way is somewhat long: and if you have no body who understands 
Spanish,
 you may write in 
English,
 for here are your Countrey∣men who will interpret it.

Alanso Arguiles.
