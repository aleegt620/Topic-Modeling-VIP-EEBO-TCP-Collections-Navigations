The Epistle DEDICATORY.


To his deservedly Honoured Friend 
Francis Willughbie,
 
Esq


SIr, Since I have had the happiness to be known to you, (my Habitation being not far distant from yours) I have found so much Candour and Civility in you, that I thought I needed not to seek further for a person, to whom I should dedicate this little Tract of Travel and Coyns, you having Travelled into the most famous Coun∣tries

of 
Europe,


 and (being inquisitive after all Curiosi∣ties) also improved your tra∣vel both to the acquiring and knowledge of Coyns, and ma∣ny other rarities, some of which you were pleased for∣merly to shew me and others, and have (for the better com∣pleting of this Treatise) com∣municated to me several Ob∣servations, about Forein coyns especially. I would our Gen∣try generally were more stu∣dious, and would spend their time as profitably as you and

some others do. That would confirm what Mr. 
Burton
 in his Melancholly

 observes of some of our 
English
 Gentry, that they are excellently well learned, like those 
Fuggeri
 in 
Germany, Du Bartas, Du∣plessis, Sadael
 in 
France, Pi∣cus Mirandula, Scottus, Ba∣rottus
 in 
Italy.
 There is an Honourable Gentleman

 now of the Royal Society, (whereof you are likewise a worthy Member) who hath Travelled abroad to good purpose, and by his Philosophical

 Expe∣riments and other useful Trea∣tises, hath much honoured the Nation. I may here relate, what I have heard from a very

worthy Divine; that he never knew a Family, wherein the Men and Women both, were of so obliging a Carriage, and of such great abilities. There is also a learned Knight and Baronet

 of this Parliament (mentioned among the Bene∣factors to the 
Polyglott Bible
) who hath written Critical notes in Latine on the New Testament. I shall onely adde this, that it may seem strange for me to publish a Discourse of Money, who (when I had the honour to be a Member of the House of Commons) was alwaies silent when that Sub∣ject came into debate,


Sir,
 
Your Affectionate Friend to serve you
 Edward Leigh.








TO THE Candid READER.


REader, It is said of 
Ulysses, Qui mores hominum multorum vidit, & urbes, Horat. De Arte Poetica.
 Yet I would not have thee read my Discourse of Travel, 
Peregrinante animo.
 The Commodity which comes to humane Societies, by the Tra∣vells of prudent, pious, and well governed persons, is very great. The Apostles, the Dis∣ciples of Christ, and also their Disciples, and many others, have gon through a great part

of the World to convert the 
Gentiles.
 So if a Voyage be un∣dertaken to know the rites and customes of several places, and the forms of Cities, as the 
Ro∣man Decemviri
 were sent to 
Greece,
 that they might know the Laws of that Countrey, and especially 
Solons. Pythagoras, Plato, Apollonius
 did go into divers Countries to increase their knowledge. 
Diodorus Si∣culus
 & 
Strabo
 Travelled into several parts of the World, that they might be acquainted with the History and Scituation of those places. 
Pausanias


 
com∣passed Greece, Arrianus,
 the

Euxine Sea,
 and 
Cluverius
 Travelled into many Countries of 
Europe,
 that they might more exactly describe those parts. The knowledge of Lan∣guages hath incited many to Travel; 
Vossius


 instanceth in 
Jacobus Golius
 (that famous 
Arabist
) who not satisfied with the instruction of 
Thomas Er∣pinus
 in the Arabick 
Lan∣guage,


 went first into 
Mouri∣tania,
 and being chosen Succes∣sor to 
Erpenius
 in his place af∣ter

his death, he took a long Voyage into 
Syria,
 and there staid till he had perfected his skill in that Language. I may very well here mention, our worthy professor of the 
He∣brew
 and 
Arabick
 Tongues in 
Oxford, Dr. Edward Pocock,
 who was long abroad at 
Alep∣po,
 and other places on the same account. Where he so de∣meaned himself, that he was very much respected by the Na∣tives, and chosen for an Ʋmpire amongst them, to compremise such differences as fell out there. The learned works he hath published, give ample Testimony of the skil he attain∣ed in the Arabick, especially by

that long Voyage. The Jesuits themselves and others write much, how industrious the Je∣suits were in the propagation of the Christian Faith, and how they have sown the seed of sa∣ving truth in 
China
 or else∣where.


Mr. 
Baxter
 in the 
2d.
 part of his last Book of Christiani∣ty, 
c. 14. p. 488.
 saith, The at∣tempts of the Jesuits in 
Congo, Japon
 and 
China
 were a very noble work, and so were the 
Portugal
 Kings encourage∣ments: but two things spoiled their success.


First, That when they took down the Heathens Images, they set them up others in their

stead; and made them think that the main difference was, but whose Image they should worship.


Secondly, But especially, that they made them see, that while they pretended to promote Re∣ligion, and to save their souls, they came to promote their own wealth, or the Popes Domini∣on, and to bring their Kings under a Forein power.


The honest attempts of Mr. 
Eliots
 in 
New-England,
 is much more agreeable to the A∣postles way,

 and maketh more serious spiritual Christians.


Justus Heurnius
 (son to 
John Heurnius
 the learned Physician) left the study of

Physick, and wholly gave him∣self to the study of Divinity, that thereby he might be the better inabled to promote the Conversion of the Indians, and taking an Evangelical Em∣bassie to the Indies, he there abode above 
14
 Years, preach∣ing to the Indians in their Mo∣ther Tongue, Catechising them, and admonishing them pri∣vately, and by his singular in∣nocensie,

 humility and mode∣sty, and daily fervent devotion, and great charity to the poor; He endeavoured to propagate the Kingdome hf Christ among them.




The Pilgrimages

 of the Turks to 
Meccha,
 and of the Papists to 
Loretto
 are vain, we need not to travel for to find God.


I have joyned these three Discourses together, since in that of Money and Measuring, I write of the Forein Coyns and Measures, and so hoping, that they may be all useful to the Traveller, I remain


Thy Hearty Well-willer, 
Edward Leigh.
















A Diatribe OF TRAVEL.


By 
Edward Leigh
 Esq;


Psal. 107.23, 24.


They that go down to the Sea in Ships, that do business in great waters:


These see the works of the Lord: and his wonders in the deep.


Patri est, Ubicunque est bene.


Printed in the Year, MDCLXXI.














A DIATRIBE OF Travel.


T
Ravel in the Younger sort, is a part of Edu∣cation; in the Elder, a part of Experience. Sir 
Francis Bacon's Essays.


There is no Map like the view of the Coun∣try; One journey will shew a man more then any Description can. He that sear∣cheth Forreign Nations is becoming a

Gentleman of the World. 
Felthams Re∣solves of Travel.


Many Travellers returning to their own home, bring back only some vain Garbs and Fashions, and are leavened with the ill Customes and Manners of the Countries they passed thorough. 
Vagari, Lustrare, disquirere qui vis potest, pauci indigare, discere, id est, vere perigrinari.
 Lip
i 
Epistola ad
 Lanoium 
de Peregrina∣tione Italica.


 I think it most requisite and fit, that none should Travel without leave of the State, or Publick Council; and at their return should be accounta∣ble to the State and Publick Council of their Travels, and the advantages they have made: Dr. 
Hall
 in his First Decade of Epistles, Epistle 8th, giving advice to the Earl of 
Essex
 for his Travel, saith, There is nothing can quit the labour and cost of Travel, but the gain of Wisdom; when young Nobles came to take their leaves of our late King 
Charles,
 before they Travelled into Forreign parts; He thus councelled them; My Lord, keep alwaies the best Company, and be sure never to be idle.


Alsted
 in his 
Systema Mnemonicum, l.
 4. 
De Geographia, Zeilerus
 before

his Itenerary of 
Spain
 and 
Portugal
 Monsieur 
de Sorbiere
 in his 
Lettres & Discours Lettre
 85. Mr. 
Palmer
 in his 
Traveller,
 part second, and Sir 
Francis Bacon
 in his 
Essays,
 give directions to Tra∣vellers, and shew what things are fit to be observed by them.


Neugebavarus
 and 
Loyzius
 have writ∣ten in Latine 
'De Peregrinatione.




Dr. 
Hall
 hath written in English of Travelling, his Tract is stiled, 
Quo vadis.
 Sir 
Balthasar Gerbier
 hath 
Subsidium Pe∣regrinantibus.


Mr. 
Howell
 hath put out instructions for forreign Travel.


Mr. 
Palmer
 also hath written an Essay of the means how to make our Travels into forreign Countries profitable and honourable; he dedicated it to Prince 
Henry.


Jones
 hath put out instructions for Travellers.


The Merchant proposeth to himself 
bonum utile
 in his Travel, and brings

home exotick Commodities, as Wine, Fruit, Spices, Metals, precious Stones, Silk, and such like, serving both for use and luxury.


Impiger extremos Currit mercatas ad Indos,
 Horat. 
Epist,
 1. 
lib.
 1.


The dissolute rich young Gentleman, 
bonum jucundum;
 The well-bred Gen∣tleman; 
bonum honestum,
 or honor, that he may accomplish himself for the service of his

 Country.


In such a one going to Travel, there is required.


First, A competent age, that he be a∣bove 18 or 20 years old, although the years of 14 or 15 are more proper

for learning the true accent of any Lan∣guage, and all exercises belonging to the body.


Secondly, That he hath the Latine Tongue, and some skill in the Liberal Sciences.


Thirdly,

 That he be skilful in Ar∣chitecture, able so well to Limn or Paint; as to take in paper the Scituation of a Castle or a City; or the Platform of a Fortification.


Fourthly, That he be well grounded in the true Religion, lest he be seduced and perverted. 
Gal.
 4.1. 
O foolish Gala∣tians, who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, Galli a peregri∣nando nomen habent;
 For 
Vuallen
 in the Teutonick Tongue, signifies 
peregrinari,
 alluding therefore to this Etymoligy: He chides the 
Galatians
 for their wandering in Religion, 
q. d.
 You like Travellers, of∣ten change your Opinions about the Do∣ctrine of Truth. I know a Noble Per∣son

who being in 
France
 well acquainted with a Popish Gentleman, once when the other left him, he wisht that he were as good a 
Hugonot
 as himself; the other im∣mediately after sent him a Defence of their Religion, to which he replyed, and shewed the same unto me: I more disliked the Popish Religion when 
I
 was in 
France
 then before, and more esteemed the Pro∣testants, since at 
Nants,
 and some pla∣ces, there were scarce any French Prote∣stants.


Fifthly, He should be first well ac∣quainted with his own Country, before he go abroad; as to the places and Go∣vernment.


If any came heretofore to the Lords of the Council for a License to Travel; the old Lord Treasurer 
Burleigh,
 would first examine him of 
England;
 if he found him ignorant, he would bid him stay at home, and know his own Country first.


Sixthly, It were of use to inform him∣self (before he undertakes his Voyage,) by the best Chorographical and Geogra∣phical Map of the Scituation of the coun∣try he goes to, both in it self and Rela∣tively to the Universe, to compare the 
Vetus & Hodierna Regio,
 and to carry

with him the Republicks of the Nations to which he goes; and a Map of every Country he intends to travel thorough.


Seventhly, Before his Voyage,

 He should make his peace with God, Re∣ceive the Lords Supper, satisfie his Cre∣ditors if he be in debt; Pray earnestly to God to prosper him in his Voyage, and to keep him from danger, and if he be 
sui juris,
 he should make his last will, and wisely order all his affairs, since ma∣ny that go far abroad, return not home.




In the Survey of a Countrey, these things are observable.


First,

 The Name and its derivation, the Latitude and Longitude of the place, the Temperature of the Climate, the goodness or barrenness of the Ground, the populousness or scarcity of the Peo∣ple, the limits of the Countrey, how it is bounded by Sea or Land, or both, the Commodities, Natural, Artificial, the

Dis-commodities, either Imperfections or Wants, the Manners, Shape, Lan∣guage and Attire of the People, their Building, their Havens and Harbours, the Religion and Government, the History of the Countrey and Families.


2. The Courts of

 Princes are to be seen and observed, especially when they give audience to Embassadors, the Courts of Justice whiles they sit and hear Causes, and so of Consistories Ec∣clesiastick, the Churches and Monuments therein, the Walls and Fortifications, of Cities and Towns, Antiquities and Ruines, Libraries, Colledges, Disputati∣ons and Lectures where they are, Ship∣ing and Navies, Houses and Gardens of State and pleasure near great Cities; Armories, Arsenals, Magazines, Ex∣changes, Burses, Ware-houses; Exer∣cises of Horsemanship, Fencing, Train∣ing of Soldiers, and the like; Treasuries

of Jewels and Robes, Cabinets, and rare Inventions.


Aubertus Miraeus
 in the Life of 
Lipsius,
 saith, that when he came first to 
Rome,
 he spent all his time (when he was at leisure) in viewing the stones and antient places, and other rarities there, and spent his time in the Popes Vatican Library, in comparing together the Ma∣nuscripts of 
Seneca, Tacitus, Plautus, Propertius,
 and other Antients. He view∣ed also other famous Libraries publick and private.


Thirdly, The choice Herbs

 and Plants, Beasts, Birds, Fishes, and Insects proper to that Country, are to be taken notice of; Minerals, Metals, Stones, and Earths; their Proverbs also should be observed, in which much of the wisdom of a Nation is found.


Fourthly, Learned men, and such as have abilities in any kind, are worthy to be known, and the best Books there, are to be inquired after. Men that Travel

must be very cautious both of their speech and demeanour; The 
Italian
 Pro∣verb saith, For a man to travel safely thorough the world, 
It behoveth him to have a Faulcons Eye, an Asses Ears, a Monkies Face, Merchants Words, a Camels Back, a Hogs Mouth, and Deers Feet.


Sir 
Henry Wotton
 in his Letters, men∣tions twice the answer that was given him by 
Alberto Scipioni,
 when he beg'd his advice, how he might carry himself securely at

 
Rome, Signor Arrigomio
 (says he) 
Pensieri Stretti, Et il viso Sci∣olto, Your thoughts close, and your Coun∣tenance loose, will go safely over the whole world.




Fifthly,

 Make choice of the best pla∣ces for attaining of the Language, as 
Valladolid
 for the 
Spanish, Orleans,
 or 
Blois
 for the 
French, Florence
 or 
Sienna
 for the 
Italian, Lipsick
 or 
Heidelberg
 for the 
High-Dutch
 Tongues: in these places the best Language is spoken.


Abraham Ortelius
 in his 
Itinerari∣um Belgiae,
 perswades Travellers to note, and observe what they see most memora∣ble; 
Peregrinationes nostrae futurae nobis erunt longe gratiores, si una cum itineri∣bus animadvertamus, & annotemus in Chartis, si quid observatione dignum oc∣currerit.


What profit Travelling brings to an Architect, 
Vitruvius
 shews, what to a Souldier, 
Vegetius,
 what to a Limner or Statuary, the Horses of 
Phidias


 and 
Praxiteles
 made by art, witness; Mer∣chandise is almost maintained by Travel; How much are Cosmography, Topo∣graphy and Astronomy, improved and furthered by Travel.


Change of Air by Travelling, after one is used unto it, is good: And there∣fore

great Travellers have been long liv'd: The Countries which have been observed, to produce long livers, are these; 
Arcadia, Aetolia, India,
 on this side 
Ganges, Brasil, Topropane, Bitain, Ireland,
 with the Islands of the 
Arcades,
 and 
Hebrides,
 Sir 
Francis Bacon's
 History of Life and Death.


How much may the art of Navigation further the spreading of the Gospel!

 
Dan.
 12.4. 
Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased,
 that is, say some Expositors by Travelling to and fro, as the 
Waldenses
 to learn and propagate the Truth, knowledge shall

be multiplied in the earth in the last time. The same word is used, 
Numb.
 11.8. Of the Children of 
Israel
 going about to gather Manna, and of the Devils go∣ing to and fro,

Francis Bacon, De Augmentis Scientiarum l.
 2. 
c.
 10. 
Et Nov. Org. l.
 1. 
Aphor.
 93. that God would so order it by his providence, that the passing through the world (which is now fulfilled by so many far Navigati∣ons) and the increasing of Sciences should fall into the same age.

 Baconus Nov. Org. l. 1. Aphor. 72.


In the 
Philosophical Conferences
 of the 
Virtuosi
 of 
France
 Conference 87. It is determined whether Travel be necessary to an ingenuous man. He saith there, if you except Embassies,

 in which the good of the State drowns all other considera
i∣ons, those that would Travel must be

young and strong, rich and well borne, to get any good by their Travells.


La Moth le Vair
 in his 
Opuscules Lettre
 6.

 Speaks of the profit of 
Voyages,
 and Lettre 7. of the unprofitableness of them, he saith in the sixth Letter, that Travelling is the best School for life, in several respects: The French say 
Ʋn ho∣neste homme, Est un homme meste,
 an ho∣nest or wise man is a mixt man, that is, one who hath somthing in him, in point of knowledge of all Nations.


Charles
 the fifth made Nine Voyages,

 into 
Germany,
 Six into 
Spain,
 Seven in∣to 
Italy,
 four into 
France,
 Ten into the 
Low-Countries,
 Two into 
England,
 as many into 
Affrica,
 he also passed the 
Ocean
 and 
Mediterranean
 Seas eleven times.




The Emperour 
Hadrian
 travelled o∣ver a great part of the world,

 and with his Head bare, though it was cold and wet, and so fell into a deadly dsease; whence the Verses of 
Florus
 the Poet, whom 
Salmasius
 (in his notes on 
Aelius Spartianus
) thinks to be the Historian, who elegantly wrote the Epitome of the 
Roman
 affairs and lived under 
Hadrian.




Ego nolo Caesar esse,


Ambulare per Britannos,


Scythicas pati pruinas.






I
 will in no wise 
Caesar
 be,


To walk along in 
Britainie,


The 
Scythick
 frosts to feel and see.










To which the Emperour answered in the like strain




Ego nolo Florus esse,


Ambulare per tabernas,


Latitare per popinas,


Culices pati rotundos.






And 
I
 will never 
Florus
 be,


To walk from shop to shop, as he,


To lurk in Taverns secretly,


And there to feel the 
Rome
-wine fly




But (saith 
Stuckius
) how many Chri∣stian Princes and Nobles are now to be found,

 more like 
Florus
 than the Empe∣rour 
Adrian?


They that have written the Iteneraries of the Apostles,

 have observed that St. 
Paul
 Travel'd much farther, than either St. 
Peter
 or St. 
John,
 as they have de∣scribed the circuite; and 
Purchas
 both Divines, of which last, Dr. 
Casaubon
 of Credulity and Incredulity, part first,

saith, a book of very good worth with them that know the right use, and more valued abroad, than it is at home by ma∣ny. Of the Navigation of the 
French
 into 
America, Johannes Lerius
 hath writ∣ten well of the

 
Navigations
 of the 
Por∣tugals
 and 
Spaniards,
 See 
Guicciardines
 History of 
Italy, lib.
 6. Of those of the 
English, Hackluit
 speaks sufficiently. Of the profit which comes to men by 
Na∣vigations,
 see 
Fourniers Hydrography, l.
 4. 
c.
 9. and of the Faith enlarged and amplified by means of Navigation: See the same book, chap. 6. There are also the 
Navigations
 and 
Voyages
 of 
Leyis Vertomannus,
 and 
Cadamusti Navigatio ad terras ignotas,
 of whom 
Peter Mar∣tyr
 saith, in the seventh Chapter of his second 
Decade,
 that he stole certain An notations out of the three first Chapters of his first 
Decade,
 written to Cardinal 
Ascanius
 and 
Acimboldus,
 supposing that he would never have published the same.




Dr. 
Casaubon
 (in his first part of Cre∣dulity and Incredulity, in things Natural, Civil and Divine) saith, I have (as all men, I think have, that are any thing curious) read several relations of all the known parts of the world, written by men of several Nations and Professi∣ons, Learned and Unlearned, in divers Languages; by men of several ages, an∣cient and late.


There are divers 
Hodaeporica Voyages,
 and Itineraries, Antient, Modern, in Prose, Verse, in Latin, French, English.


 
Benjamin Tidelensis,
 his Itinerary. He was a Jew, and travelled over a great part of the world. 
Ecchellensis
 in his Pre∣face to his 
Historia Arabum
 seems to slight him: 
Constantine l'Empereur
 (who hath publisht notes upon him) saith, in his 
Dissertat. Ad Lectorem. Cum judicio legen∣dum hoc itinerarium, nec auctori in om∣nibus habenda fides, praesertim ubi suorum conditionem ac statum extollit: plurima tamen notatu digna passim occurrunt, ut quae de locorum distantiis aliisque annotat.

Apollo
 said to the Author of the 
Chi∣na History,
 that he should reduce the immense Metropolitan City of so many Kingdoms, inhabited by many millions of men to some credible measure; and particularly, that he should bring the Palace of that King, which he had affirm∣ed to be many miles long, to such a form, as 
Vitruvius
 should not laugh at him for it; saying, that if that building were so great as he had described it to be, the Halls must needs be half a mile long, and the Chambers little less; which if it were true, the whole Academy of Ar∣chitects had reason to say, that to bring the meat but to the Table, the servants of so great a King must ride Post.

A Diatribe OF MONY OR COYN.


Printed in the Year, MDCLXXI.














A DIATRIBE OF MONY Or COYN.


C
Oyn
 seemeth to come from the 
French, Coin,
 a 
Corner;
 because the ancientest sort of 
Coyn,
 was cornered and not round.




Cowells Intepreter.


Coyning of Money is a special right

and Prerogative of Soveraigne

 Majesty, Mony is as the sinews and strength of a state, so the life and soul of Commerce.


Mony, Commonly is the mean for all Commodities, and answereth to all, 
Ec∣cles.
 10.19. Yet the 
Spaniards
 Com∣ing into the 
West-Indies,
 had many Com∣modities of the Country which they needed, brought unto them by the In∣habitants; to whom, when they offered them Money, goodly pieces of Gold Coyn, the 
Indians
 taking the Mony, would put it into their Mouths, and spit it out to the 
Spaniards
 again, signifying, that they could not eat it, or make use of it; and therefore would not part with their Commodities for Money, unless they had such other Commodities as would serve their use.


That Money hath been anciently used in a way of Commerce, we may see 
Gen.
 33.19. And the most ancient was the

purest Gold. Medals are certain pieces of Money dispersed at the Coronation of Kings. They call them commonly 
Me∣dallias,
 in the Italian, Spanish, and French Languages, (saith 
Antoninus Augustinus, De veterum numismatum Antiquitate
) from the Latine word 
Metalla,
 since those three Languages had their Original from the Latine.


Pope Gregory
 the 13th after he had received tidings in the Consistory of the 
Massacres
 in 
France,


 one thousand five hundred and seventy two, went to the Church that night to give thanks, made 
Bonfires,
 and gloried in the bloody feats of those 
Emissaries,
 having a 
Coyn
 with his 
own Face
 on one side, and an 
Angel
 on the other; with a 
Cross
 in one hand, and a 
Sword
 in the other, with this Motto, 
Hugonothorum Strages.




Lewis
 the 12th of 
France,
 a moderate Prince, when his Realm was interdicted by 
Pope Julius
 the second, caused Coyn to be stamped with his own image,

 with this superscription,

 
Perdam Nomen Ba∣bylonis.


In 
Athens
 the Tower excelled,

 in which there was a Temple to 
Minerva. Juleus Pollux
 writes, that the 
Attick te∣tradrachme
 was stamped with the face of 
Minerva,
 and he might have added with the 
Noctua
 on the reverse. Mr. 
Greaves
 of the 
Denarius. Hugh Broughton
 said, it was portended by his Arms, that he should be a 
Grecian,
 for he gave the house 
Athens.


There is a Medal in 
Oxford
 made upon the sinking of the Spanish ships in 88.

 with a Navy on one side and a Rock on the other. See 
Cambdens Annals.




The 
Lydians
 first invented Gold and Silver Money, 
Janus
 Brass Money.


Gutherius


 out of 
Isidore,
 saith three things are required in Money; the Metal, the Figure, and the Weight; 
Gold
 is the most excellent of all Metals, saith 
Georgi∣us Agricola.
 Gold hath 
Greatness of Weight, Closeness of Parts, Fixation, Pliantness,
 or 
Softness, Immunity
 from 
Rust, Colour
 or 
Tincture
 of 
Yellow.


Sir 
Francis Bacon
's 
Natural History,
 Centuary 4. Experiment 328.


Martiall
 calls Gold, Yellow Mony.

 
Has nisi de flaxa loculos implere moneta. Non decet, argentum vilia ligna ferant.
 Silver is next to it, it is not consumed in the fire. It is more ductile than any other metal except Gold. Its white co∣lour is delightful.




Yet 
Budaeus De Contemptu Rerum Fortuitorum l.
 3. saith well, 
At Ʋsu subla∣to quid tandem aurum & argentum aliis praestat metallis,


Diligent inquiring into Coyns,

 is one great piece of antiquity; by the know∣ledge of which (as other ways) we may come to understand the right wri∣ting of several words.


Heliogabalus,
 or 
Algebalus
 rather, as he was stiled of old, as 
Egnatius (Notis ad Caesares)
 proves out of some old Coyns.


Leonardus Aretinus,
 in the fourth Book of his Epistles, describing his journy from

Rome
 to 
Constance,
 saith, when he en∣quired of some Citizens there, of the an∣tiquity and original of 
Constance, nemo adhuc mihi occurrit, qui vel avi sui nomen & memoriam ne dum urbi tenere vide∣retur.
 Yet by diligent searching, he found a Marble Table Containing ancient let∣ters, by which it appears, that this Ci∣ty took its name from 
Constantius
 the Father of 
Constantine,
 being called 
Vi∣tudura.


There is much learned pleasure in the Contemplation of the several figures stamped on each side of these Attique Coyns. Would you see the true and un∣doubted models of their 
Temples, Altars, Deities, Columns, Gates, Arches, A∣quaeducts, Bridges, Sacrifices, Vessels, Sellae Curules, Ensignes
 and 
Standards, Naval
 and 
Mural Crowns, Amphithea∣ters, Circi, Bathes, Chariots, Tro∣phies, Ancilia,
 and a thousand things more. Repair to the old Coyns and you shall find them. 
Peachams Compleat Gentleman,
 ch. 12.


There is a twofold Inscription of Coyns, 
obversa
 and 
aversa.


Vide Seldenum De Jure Naturali.
 l. 6, c. 17.




I have heard of some men,

 (but heard it onely) who by the bare handling and smelling, would judge better of old Coyns (which is a great trade beyond the Seas, and concerning which, many Books are written) than others, not al∣together strangers unto them, could by the sight.


The general names for Money among the 
Romans
 are three,

 
Moneta, Numus, Pecunia.


First, 
Moneta
 (whence the 
French Monnoye
) 
à Monendo,
 because it sheweth us the Author, the Value and the time.


Numisma, quasi Nomisma à nomini∣bus scilicet & effigiebus principum quae ei imprimebantur,
 Isidorus 
dici putat.
 Wa∣serus 
De
 Antiquis Numis Hebraeorum, Chaldaeorum 
&
 Syrorum 
c.
 11.


Secondly, 
Numus,
 or 
Nummus
 ra∣ther, saith 
Vossius,
 a 
Numa,
 saith 
An∣gelo Cretor,
 it hath rather a Greek Ori∣ginal,

 from the Law, because

it is a Legitimate and publick price. 
No∣misma
 and 
Numus
 (saith 
Martinius
) seem to be of the same Original.


Thirdly, 
Pecunia,
 either from the Images of

 Cattel stamped upon it, or from their skin out of which mony was Coyned.


Gen.
 33.19. 
For an hundred pieces of money,
 the 
Greek
 and 
Chaldee
 translate it, a hundred Lambs. Others think they were 
pieces of money,
 on which the ima∣ges of Lambs were stamped. So in 
Jos.
 24.32. 
Job
 42.11. 
Ainsworth, Vide Me∣neru in loc. & Brerewood De Ponderibus, &c.


The Mony currant in 
Attica
 was com∣monly stamped with an Oxe, whence came the By-word. 
Bos in Lingua,


 ap∣plied to such Lawyers as were bribed to say nothing in their Clients cause, not much unlike to which was the Proverb rising from the Coyn of 
Aegina,
 (an Isle adjoyning) stamped with the figure of a 
Snail, viz. Virtutem & sapientiam vin∣cant. Testudines.




The Names of the Brass Money among the 
Romans
 were,



As


Quadrans


Sextans


Triens




Of the Silver.




Denarius


Quinarius


Sestertius.




Of the Gold.


Aureus

 sive Solidus,
 it was valued with the 
Romans
 at 25 
Denaries.


As
 or 
assis,
 is a little piece of mony, whose baseness grew into a Proverb. 
Omnes unius aestimemus assis,


Aes
 is also used for Money, because the first Money amongst the 
Romans
 was made of Brass, whence 
aerarium
 also for

a Treasury. 
Tam aeris quam argenti no∣minibus in sermone latino pecunia indica∣tur.
 Camerarius.


Servius Tullius
 First Coyned Money at 
Rome,
 as 
Pliny
 witnesseth, 
l.
 33. 
c.
 3. This was of 
Brass.


 They used this till the 5th year before the first Punick war. Then 
Silver
 Money was first Coyned, which is called 
Denarius, quia valeret decem li∣bras aeris.
 The 
Golden
 Money was Coyn'd at 
Rome,
 forty two years after the Silver Money was used, as 
Pliny
 shews in the place before-named, 62. saith 
Lipsius.
 The price and esteem of Gold was different among the 
Greci∣ans
 and 
Romans,
 among the 
Grecians
 Golden Money was changed for ten of Silver, among the 
Romans
 for twelve and a half; often it was much more e∣steemed. 
Vossius De Philiologia Christi∣aniae.
 l. 6. c, 35. 
Meursius
 hath put out 
Denarius Pythagoricus opusculum pereru∣ditum, ac mihi eo gratius quod inscripse∣rit nomini nostro
 Vossius, 
ibid.
 l. 8. c. 3.




Amongst the ancient Hebrews Chal∣deans and Syrians,

 the most usual money was the 
Siclus
 or 
Shekel,
 among the La∣tines the cheif and usual kinds of Silver money were 
Denarius
 and

 
Sestertius,
 among the Grecians, 
Drachma, Mina, Talentum.


A 
Shekel
 (coming from 
Shakal,
 he weighed, from whence our English 
Skole
 and 
Skale
 to weigh with, is derived) is by interpretation a 
weight,
 as being the most common in payments, in which they used to weigh their money, 
Gen.
 23.16. 
Jer.
 32.9. The Chaldee calleth a Shekel 
Silgna,
 and 
Selang
 (from whence our English shilling seemeth to be bor∣rowed) and the quantity of the common shekel differd not much from our shilling, as the shekel of the Sanctuary was about two shillings., 
Answ.
 on 
Gen.
 20.16. See him on 
Exod.
 33.13.




A shekel is about the weight of an English half Crown,

 
Valet pro inde She∣kel de nostro.
 2 s. 6 d. 
Brerewood de Ponde∣ribus & Pretiis veterum nummorum.
 c. 1.


Exod.
 30.13.

 The Gerah is held to have been about a penny half penny, and by that estimate, the shekel was two shillings six pence, and half the shekel fifteen pence.


It is the ancientest of all the monies the Scripture mentions,

 the weight of it is almost four Spanish Reals, or four Roman Julii,


A Roman Julio

 or; a Spanish Royal, is about 7 pence English, a piece of eight called so, because equal to eight Royals is about 4 
s.
 6 
d.
 English, so that 
Ains∣worth
 seems to be mistaken.




Graeci pecuniarum summas num era∣bant drachmis, ut
 Judaea 
siclis, & Ro∣mani sestertiis,
 Brerewood 
De Ponderi∣bus & Pretiis veterum nummorum.


Mr. 
Greaves
 in his 
Denarius,


 would have the thirty pieces of Silver, which were given to 
Judas,
 as the reward of his treason, to be thirty shekels, that be∣ing less then fifteen of our ordinary Crowns.


We find in 
Exodus
 (saith he) the price of a servant to have been thirty shekels. 
Gassendus De vita Peireskii,
 saith as much, and so doth Dr. 
Hamon
 on 
Matth.
 26.15. 
Mr. Greaves,
 there also saith, the distinction of a double shekel, the one sacred equal to the tetradrachme, the o∣ther prophane weighing the didrachme: that used in the Sanctuary, this in Civil Commerce, is without any solid foun∣dation in the writ, and without any pro∣bability

of reason, that in any wise State, the Prince and people should have one sort of Coyn, and the Priests should have another, and that this of the Sanctuary should be in a double proportion to the other, and yet that both should concur in the same name, 
Rivet.
 on 
Exod.
 30.13. goes the same way and gives four reasons to prove that the shekel was but one.


Matth.
 22.20. The 
tribute Money
 or 
Denarius,
 that was to be paid to 
Cae∣sar
 by way of tribute, had on it, saith 
Occo,
 the picture or image of 
Caesar,
 and in it these Letters written, 
Caesar Augu∣stus,
 such a year after the taking of 
Ju∣daea,
 Dr. 
Hammond in loc.


Denarius
 may be considered in a dou∣ble respect, either as 
nummus,


 or as 
pon∣dus:
 In the first acception, the valuation of it in civil affairs is remarkable, in the later, the gravity and ponderousness: The 
Denarius
 was a Silver Coyn in use amongst the 
Romans,
 passing at the first institution for 
Dena aera
 or ten 
Asses.
 whence the name: The Dutch esteem it at six Stivers, or a 
shilling.




The 
Assis
 was a brass Coyn weigh∣ing a pound.

 The 
denarius
 had an im∣press upon it of the figure X. denoting the decussis, or number of the 
Asses.


Denarius
 as 
Pondus
 was either 
Consu∣laris,


 made under the government of the City by the 
Consuls,
 or 
Caesareus,
 under the 
Caesars,
 somtimes there is the Effi∣gies of the 
Consuls,
 and somtimes of the Emperour on it. 
Denarius
 is of as great moment for the Discovery of weights, as the 
Roman foot
 for the 
Measures.


It weigheth of our Money seven pence, or seven pence half peny, and was the pay of the Roman Soldiers, and the wages of a Day-labourer, 
Matth.
 20.9.


The 
Athenian
 Drachma (the pay of their Souldiers) by account both of Mer∣chants and Physicians weighed alike, and was of one value




Sestertius
 signifies two and a half,

 as the vulgar note also importeth H s. or joyned H. s. that is, 
duo & semis,
 two and a half, 'tis meant alwaies of so ma∣ny 
asses,
 four 
Sestertii
 are equivalent to a 
denarius.
 Sir 
Henry Savil
 on 
Tacitus,
 and Mr. 
Greaves
 of the 
Denarius.


Every 
Sestertium
 was valued at seven pound sixteen shillings three pence.


As the 
Sestertius
 according to 
Arrun∣tius,
 was 
olim dupondius & semis,
 anci∣ently 
two pounds of brass and an half;
 so the 
Sestertius pes,
 was two foot and an half. Mr. 
Greaves
 his Discourse of the Roman Foot.


As the 
Ʋnity
 in respect of Numbers, or the 
Sestertius
 in Discourses 
de re num∣maria:
 So is the 
Denarius
 for weights, a fit rise or beginning, from whence the

rest may be deduced. Mr. 
Greaves
 of the 
Denarius.


The 
Drachma
 as 
Nummus,
 was a sil∣ver Coyn in use amongst the Athenians,

 and so it was the measure of things vendible, as all Coyns are, and as 
pon∣dus,
 it was the measure of their gravity and weight. Mr. 
Greaves
 of the 
Dena∣rius.


Dilher
 in the first 
Tome
 of his Acade∣mical Disputations, reckons up eight kinds of 
Drachmae;
 See 
Beza Schmi∣dius,
 and Dr. 
Hammond
 on 
Matth.
 17.27.


Gellius, Noct. Attic. lib.
 1. 
chap.
 8. saith that 
Demosthenes
 went privately un∣to 
Lais,
 and desired to lie with her; but she demanding 10000 
drachmae

Snellius De Re Nummaria
 saith, it is manifest by the testimonies of Come∣dians, that there was a double Talent in use among the Athenians, a greater and a lesser.


A
 Talent is the greatest weight which was in use,

 every Talent was a twelve pounds weight; it weighed three thousand Shekels, and every Shekel three hundred and twenty grains of Barley. An Hebrew Talent in Silver, is of our mo∣ney three hundred seventy and five pounds. In Gold, four thousand five hundred pounds.




1 
Chron.
 22.14.

 
Now behold in my po∣verty I have prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand Talents of Gold, and a thousand thousand Talents of Silver.
 Some compute it to be above thirty three thousand Cart-loads of silver, allowing six thousand pound sterling to every Cart-load, and seventy millions of French Crowns of Gold. See Sir 
Walter Rawleigh

 The Jews had two Ta∣lents, the one sacred, the other common. The sacred was in weight and worth, as much more as the common. The sacred in Gold was reputed to be three thousand seven hundred and fifty pound in value; the common, one thousand eight hundred seventy and five pounds sterling. Dr.

False money (saith He in

Camden
 in his

 saith, 
Nicolaus Fabricius de Peiresc.

He saith there also that many pieces of Roman money are every

About thirty five years since,

 not far from

 many pieces of silver

were taken up, which the plow had thrown upon the edge of the Furrough: Being examined, they were found to be silver with the impression of

 caused all such base monies as were Coyned by any of her Predecessors,

 to be reduced to a lesser value, and to be brought into her Ma∣jesties Mint, for which she gave them money of the purest silver, such as passed commonly by the name of Easter∣ling or Sterling money,

 since which time, no base money hath been Coyned in 
England,
 but only of pure Gold and Silver, to pass for current in the same; save that of late times, in relation to the Necessity of poor people, a permission hath been given to the Coyning of Far∣things, which no man can be forced to accept in satisfaction of a Rent or Debt.




In all other States of the Christian World, there are several sorts of Copper money, as current with them for pub∣lick uses, as the purest metal,

That name of Sterling began in time of

Esterling money, now called Sterling, not from 
Striveling
 in 
Scotland,
 nor from a Star, which some dreamed to be Coyn∣ed thereon.

Sir 
Henry Savill
 on a Place in 
Poly∣bius.


In the Low-Countries and Germany, the usual Coyns in Gold are Duckats, and double Duckats, the Duckats are called Hungars at 
Venice,
 and are worth nine shillings English.


In the Low-Countries the usual silver pieces are Ducatoons equal to ten Dutch shillings, or sixty stivers; Paracoons e∣qual forty eight stivers, or eight Dutch shillings; Shillings equal to six stivers. But the States money is a little under this value, stiver, in brass, the fourth part of stivers pieces.




In 
Germany
 the most Common pieces in silver are Dollars, Copsticks, and half Copsticks, equal just to our shillings and six-pences,

 and there is abundance of our shillings and sixpences which pass under that name.


This word Copstick comes from 
Ca∣put,
 as the Italian Teston from 
Testa.
 Kreutzers, so called from the Mark of the Cross. Weiss-penny equal to two Kreutzers. Grasse equal to three Kreut∣zers; ten Weiss-pennies are equal to five Copsticks, Guilders equal to three Cop∣sticks, and half Guilders, a Weiss-pen∣ny a White Penny in Dutch, these lesser peices are of a mixt metal.


The 
German Dollars
 furnisht all the Mints of 
Europe,


 before the Mines of 
Mexico
 and 
Potosi
 were discovered in 
America.




There were the Latine, Attick, and Greek pounds.


Libra. Numaria
 or pound,

 took its name from the weight, because it weigh∣ed in times past a 
Trojane
 pound, that is, twelve Ounces. Thence the 
Saxon punde,
 and the 
English pound.


The pound sterling in 
Britain
 (saith 
Angelo Crator De Monetis
 c. 1.) is e∣steemed ten 
Brabantine Florenes,
 or four 
Spanish
 Dollars.


In 
Spain
 for Gold

 Pistolls, and half Pistolls, and double Pistolls. In Silver, the common pieces there, are a piece of eight, a half piece of eight, a quarter piece of eight, a half quarter piece of eight, and a piece that is but a sixteenth part of a piece of the Royal eight.


In 
France
 for Gold, the common pieces are the Lewis, equal (not many years since) to eleven Livers, the half Lewis half so much. The Escud' or now about six Livers,. For Silver the Escue equal to three Livers, the thirty, fif∣teen,

and five Sous pieces. The Quart D'Escu (because the fourth part of the Escud' or) equal to one Liver. Mixt me∣tal, the Souse and the Souse Marque. For Brass the Denier and the Lyard e∣equal to two Deniers, at first stamp'd for three Deniers.


Johnson
 adviseth Travellers if they car∣ry over money with them, that it be in double Pistolets or French Crowns of weight, by these (saith he) He is sure to sustain losse in no place, and in 
Italy
 to gain above twelve pence in the pound.


Bizantines
 or 
Bezants,


 as coyned at 
Constantinople,
 somtimes called 
Bizanti∣um,
 and not at 
Besanson
 in 
Burgundy,
 plates of Gold are called 
Bezantes;
 and in the Court of 
England
 where a great piece of Gold valued at fifteen pound, which the King offereth upon high Festi∣vall days is yet called a 
Bizantine,
 which anciently was a piece of Gold Coyned by the Emperours of 
Constantinople, Cam∣dens Remains of money;

 ten thousand pieces of this great Coyn of Gold of theirs, and so corrupted them; which thing when 
Agesilaus
 understood, he said merrily, but yet truly, 
That he was driven away with ten thousand Bow∣men,

A Diatribe OF MEASURING OF THE DISTANCE Betwixt PLACE and PLACE.


Printed in the Year, MDCLXXI.














A DIATRIBE OF MEASURING, &c.


G
Eometry is an Art of Measuring well.


The several

 Nations of the World do not more differ in their Languages, then in the various kinds and proportions of their Measures.




That the Foot was the most received and usual measure amongst rhe 
Romans,


 as the 
Cubit
 amongst the 
Jews,
 is a thing not controverted by any. Mr. 
Greaves
 of the 
Roman Foot.
 As the 
Denarius
 con∣tained sixteen 
Asses,
 so the 
Foot
 contain∣ed sixteen 
Digitos.


The 
Roman Milliare
 contains 
Mille p
ssus
 as the very name imports,

 and eve∣ry 
p
ssus
 consists also of five 
Feet,
 as 
Co∣lumelia
 and 
Isidorus
 expressly tell us. Mr. 
Greaves
 of the 
Roman Foot.


The Sun according to the Mathemati∣cal Computation, every hour, and that in respect of the Earth onely, by this course absolves two hundred twenty and five miles, in the day and night, and in respect of the earth, it runs over five thousand four hundred miles. How great then will its course be in respect of its Orbe.




The Phylosophers are of opinion that the Earth, together with the Sea,

 do contain in compass or circuit six thousand three hundred Dutch miles.


The 
Romans
 used to Measure out the distance betwixt one place and another,

 by thousands of Paces, which they call 
Milliaria,
 Miles; and whereas there was placed at each Miles end, a stone, or pillar, the word 
Lapis
 came to be used to signifie a Mile, as 
ad Decimum lapidem positaurbs,
 a City ten Miles off.


Ad Lapidem Torquatus habet praetoria quartum, Mart. Epig. l.
 10. 
Epig.
 79.


Whence grew also the usual Phrase, 
Ad tertium quartum quintum ab urbe la∣pidem,
 for three, four or five miles from the City.


Sir 
Henry Savill
 in his notes on the first Book of 
Tacitus
 his 
History,
 where he also observes; that as there were 
mil∣liaria

laepidea,
 Little pillars of stone e∣rected by order from 
C. Gracchus
 at the end of every mile; so there was 
Millia∣rium aureum,
 a Golden pillar set up by 
Augustus;
 so called because from thence began the account of Miles.


There are still in the 
Appian
 way se∣veral 
Columnae
 or 
Lapides Milliarii,
 standing,

 whereby the 
Romans
 divided and distinguished their Miles, which occa∣sioned those phrases, 
ad primum, ad quartum, ad centesimum lapidem.


Mr. 
Greaves,
 Among the divers Mea∣sures which Geographers use to shew the dimension of the Earth,

 the most usual are these.




First, A Geometrical 
pace
 which is five 
feet.


Secondly, A 
Furlong
 which is 125 
paces,
 or 625 
feet.


Thirdly, A 
Mile
 which is eight 
furlongs,
 or a thousand 
paces.


Fourthly, A 
League
 which is 2 
Miles
 in the quantity of 
Measures,
 we go from a Barley Corn to a Finger breadth, from a Finger breadth to an inch; from an inch to a hand breadth; from an hand breadth to a span; from a span to a foot; from a foot to a pace, and so forth to a pearch, a furlong, a leque, a mile.


Keckerman
 in his 
Systeme
 of 
Geogra∣phy. l.
 1. 
c.
 4. saith, the general instru∣ments of measure are either lesser, a Bar∣ly Corn, a Finger, a Palm, a Foot; or greater, a Pace, a Furlong, a Mile. He saith, the Pace is either simple two Feet and a half, or Geometricall, five Feet.


The Sabbath-days journey, 
Acts
 1.12. was the space of two thousand paces, that is, half a 
German
 mile. 
Victorinus Strigelius in loc.


There are 
Mensurae applicationis,
 as a span, a cubit, a yard.


Et mensurae Capacitatis,
 either of things liquide, a Pint, Quart, Pottle,

Gallon, Firkin, Barrel, Hogshead, Pipe, Tunne, or things dry; a Peck, Bushel, Quarters.


The 
Greeks
 did mete out the distances of places by 
Stadia


 or 
Furlongs;
 one 
Stadium
 doth contain 125 
paces;
 hence eight 
Stadia
 make one 
Roman
 mile, that is, one thousand 
paces.
 Mr. 
Greaves
 saith seven 
Greek Stadia
 and a half, make a 
Roman
 mile.


Furlong

 quasi
 a Furrow long, a Fur∣row, 
hoc est quod longitudinem sulci deter∣minatur,

Ro∣mans,


it was esteemed to be 240 Foot in length, and a 120 in breadth. See 
Plin. Nat. Hist.
 l. 18. c. 3.


The 
Persians
 made use of their kind of measure called 
Parasanga,


 and by them at this day 
Farsach,

See of it in Mr. 
Greaves
 his Epistle to Mr. 
Selden
 before his Discourse of the 
Roman Foot
 and 
Denarius. Musladinus Sadus
 calls them 
Farseng,
 the 
Arabians Fersach,
 and the 
Latines Parasanga. Gen∣tius;
 Whence the 
Latines
 use that Phrase, 
Multis parasangis superare.


Among the 
Greeks
 and 
Romans
 for measuring, the 
Perch
 was in use, as in these times in 
Europe,
 among the 
Egyp∣tians, Arabians
 and 
Persians,
 the 
Para∣sanga
 and 
Schoenus,
 Among the 
He∣brews

Now a days the name of Mile is most used by the 
Italians, Germans, Danes, Norweigians, Sweeds, English, Scots.


Keckerman
 in the book and chapter before quoted, saith, a mile is either proper, containing a 1000 paces, which being alwaies used in 
Italy,
 is called 
Ita∣lian,
 or improper, either a league or a 
German
 mile: A league (saith he) is either old, that is, a proper mile and a half, or new, (which they call a 
French
 mile) two proper miles. Four 
German
 mile is either common 4000 paces, or great, 5 thousand paces.


The 
Spaniards
 and 
French
 met out their distance of places by 
Leagues,

 Leu∣cae
 or 
Leugae,
 which are of a different length, as the miles in other Nations, 
Peter Martyr
 in his 
Decades
 saith, a league contains four miles by Sea, and but three by Land. From 
Spain
 to 
Hi∣spaniola
 is a 1200 leagues.


The 
Russians
 or 
Muscovites
 reckon their distances of places by a certain

space which they in their native tongue call 
Vorest.


Purchas
 in his 
Pilgrims
 speaks of the 
Cose
 among the 
Chinois
 and 
East-Indians.
 The 
Course
 or 
Cose,
 saith he, is a mile and a half, somtimes two miles; most 
English
 Mathematicians accord with the 
Italians,
 and reckon 60 miles to a degree. The 
Gothick
 and 
Sweedish
 mile is 5 or 6 
Italian
 miles, somtimes 8. The Common 
English


 mile makes one and a half 
Ita∣lian; Villamont
 saith, that a 
French
 league contains two 
Italian
 miles.


The common 
German
 mile being for the most part in plain makes more then 3 
English
 or 5 
Italian
 miles; but in some places the solitude and the ascent of mountains make the miles of 
Germany
 seem much longer; one Dutch mile and a half makes a mile of 
Switzerland.
 The miles of 
Switzerland
 being over conti∣nual mountains are so long, as the pas∣sengers distinguish their Journy more by the spaces of hours, then by the distances or numbers of miles. The miles of 
Bohe∣mia
 and 
Moravia
 are no less tedious, and though the length of the 
Switzers
 and 
Bohemian
 miles may in part be attribu∣ted to the climbing of the mountains and

bad way, yet no such reason can be gi∣ven for the miles of 
Moravia,
 which countrey is either a plane, or full of little pleasant Hills, and the ways fair, and the Country well inhabited.


The 
Low-Country
 miles are of a mid∣dle length between the 
German
 and 
French
 miles, among which the miles of 
Holland
 and 
Freezeland
 are longer than the rest.


The mile of 
Denmark
 is somewhat longer then 3 
English
 miles, and answer∣eth to the common 
German
 mile.


The miles of 
Poland
 generally are like the miles of 
Denmark.


The 
Turks
 at this day have no distin∣ction of their ways by miles, nor days by hours.



Ychan
 is a kind of measure among those of 
China,
 the journy of one day.


A 
Cubit
 is the length of a mans arme from his Elbow to the top of his middle finger, it contains 
six hand breadths,
 or a 
foot and an half.


It was the most common measure in dimensions of length, breadth, height and depth among the 
Jews, Gen.
 6.15. 
Exod.
 25.10.




Some say the Cubits were of 2 sorts,

 the Civil or common Cubit, consisting of one foot and an half six hand breadths, 24 finger breadths, and eighteen thumb breadths; and the sacred or holy Cubit, that consisted of an hand breadth, or 4 fingers more then that other, 
Ezek.
 40.5. and 43.13, 
Vide L'Empereur praefat. ad Cod. Middoth.


Mr. 
Ley
 on 
Gen.
 5.15. mentions 3 sorts of Cubits.


1. The Common Cubit containing 5 palms of 4 fingers breadth.


2. The Cubit of the Sanctuary one palm more, 
Ezek.
 40.5.


3. The Geometrical Cubit, 6 times as great as the common Cubit. See him on 
Gen,
 20.16. and on 
Deut.
 3.11. and 
Dutch Annotat.
 on 
Gen.
 6.15.
