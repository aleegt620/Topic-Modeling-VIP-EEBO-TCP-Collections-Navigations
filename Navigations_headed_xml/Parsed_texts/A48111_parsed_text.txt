THE LADIES LOSSE AT THE ADVENTURES OF FIVE HOURS: OR, THE Shifting of the Vaile.


Printed in the year 166
.














The Ladies Loss, 
&c.




YE 
Females
 that 
Do
 at 
Adventures


For 
hours five
 (or less, as't Enters)


And sometimes chance to 
shift
 the 
Vaile,


Not onely of the 
Head,
 but 
Taile;


Come listen, for it may concern ye,


How 
Mulier formosa Superne


Desinit.
 In 
Janivere,


Where 
some
 were not, though 
many
 were


All in the Fields of 
Lincolns Inn,


The 
Folk
 beginning to 
Begin,


For Poet (hight the 
Lord
 knows what)


Had made a Play of this and that;


Whereto resorted grave and fickle


As Saints did erst to 
Conventicle:


Some dressing 
Heads
 instead of 
Vailes,


With Periwiggs; and some the 
Tailes,


As it appear'd; by foul mischance,


When 
Lady
 trim'd ith' 
Mode
 of 
France,


Drop'd 
Utensils
 from 'twixt her 
legs,


(No matter whether 
Malls
 or 
Peggs
)


A pretty kind of fashion, that-


For 
Girles
 to 
Periwig
 a 
Twat!


'Tis 
sign
 (perhaps) it keeps good 
orders,


When 'tis 
confin'd
 within the 
Borders.




How came the 
custom
 with the pocks,


Puts 
Member Privy
 under locks,


And nat 
Italian?
 What 
mishap


Occasion could this 
After-clap?


Was it, O 
Mother Gibbs,
 thy 
care


To fit the 
Lady
 to a 
hair,


And fasten 
Ware
 upon thy 
word,


That leaves her 
Ware
 like 
Tayle
 of 
Bird;


To every 
Stage-wright
 made a scoff,


Like 
Coot,
 with 
Periwigg
 stript off.


'Twixt 
Madams
 Legs (as sung the 
Poet
)


But 'twas so 
lately done,
 all 
know
 it.


But do not 
(Muse)
 thus fondly raile


On the nice-
Trimmer
 of the 
Taile;


Perhaps her 
Art
 was not in 
fault,


Securing every 
slight assault;


Presuming, 
Wight,
 would come to 
hand,


Like a 
Dutch Cow,
 or 
Wench
 well 
man'd,


And not endanger (as it chances)


Both 
Member
 and 
Appurtenances,


To the rude 
hands
 of 
Blade
 so 
rough,


That mistakes 
Merkin
 for a 
Muff,


And carries all off with a 
vengeance,


Then 
rubs away
 (as erst did S
t
. 
Johns
)


And never 
minds
 for to 
restore,


Or leave 
behind,
 what's 
lost before.


Oh 
Varlet
 vile! who with fierce 
handing


Hast done more 
mischief (notwithstanding)


Then 
Wallace
 with his 
Tool
 so 
stayward,


Can make amends for, though like 
Bayard


He ne're so 
stifly
 could stand to't,


This 
gain
 that 
loss
 could ne're 
recruit:


For (as an 
Author
 sayes) her 
Mounsieur


Coming that night with thoughts to trounce her,


And finding his 
Tatterdemalian


As 
b
ld
 as 
Huswife
 clip'd 
Italian,




Who in her 
Infancy
 with 
unction,


Is so 
un-hair'd
 for future 
function,


That after 
Oyles
 and 
Labours
 expence,


A 
Barber
 there shall ne're earn 
six pence.


He thus rebuk't her, — Be gar 
Madam,


Me think your 
Ladyship
 have 
had 'um:


The case is 
alter'd
 since I 
foutred;


Your 
Cunny
 is not well 
accoutred:


Undress'd below the 
Busk
 you be,


Some honest 
Lad
 from 
Muscovy


Will you present with 
fur
 of 
Rat


To 
furnish
 out your 
Twit-cum-twat;


A 
Pox
 upon this 
filthy Paltry


Commodity,
 that snodes like 
Palfrey:


And though at first he was full fervent,


Kiss'd hand, and cry'd, 
Your humble Servant:


And 
Lady
 sad for 
work
 oth' 
day,


Did lose her 
Night-work
 as they say.


So fared it with 
Absolon,


Who found a 
Beard,
 expecting 
none.


When 
Gossip
 (to his great amazement)


Turn'd 
Tayle
 for 
Smeller,
 out of 
Cazement,


Womanaging
 so 
cleaverly,


That 
Nab
 kist 
Tout
 full 
savorly,


And started back, like 
Horse
 cryes 
Wy-hee


At Female-Beard, to hear her 
Ty
hee.


But let's return, (what e're it cost)


In 
quest
 of 
what
 our 
Lady lost:


Some call it 
one thing,
 some 
another:


But, while the 
Learned
 make a 
pother,


And, in sundry 
Disputes
 are,


Wee'l term it 
Muff
 for 
Lady-ware;


Though 
it
 be neither 
Budge
 nor 
Miniver,


Worn in the 
dayes
 of good Queen 
Guinever:


The 
Sisterhood
 in 
Bloomsbury,


Have other 
name
 to call it by;




But hold not fit that every 
Lunges


Should understand 
it,
 more then 
Spunges,


Which for a special 
Friend,
 or so,


They will produce; but if not, no.


Had 
this
 befell in time oth' 
Rump,


'That struck 
them
 into such a 
dump,


That (Stage-men all) 
who
 ever gav't ye,


Before 
Committee-men
 of 
Safety


Had been led 
captive,
 where he should


Shew 
whence
 it 
came,
 and whither 't 
would:


For 
they
 would soon have spent their 
Verdict,


And made a 
Law,
 none should 
interdict.


(If 
Harry Martins
 lucky wit


Had not by chance 
discover'd
 it.)


First, to 
secure all
 that were


Confederates
 with this 
Enginere,


Who (as presum'd) had found a 
trick


To 
Beard
 the 
Body-Politick:


Next that a 
Privy-search
 be made


Throughout the 
City,
 though the 
Trade


Seem rather 
Forreign
 then 
Domestick,


(As being 
intricate
 and 
mystick:


Besides, the 
Hogow,
 or the 
stench


Was (some say) 
Spanish,
 some say 
French
)


Last, that the 
Author
 should be sent


To suffer 
condign punishment.






A 
Presbyter
 (for sometimes they


Will shuffle in to see a Play)


Listning with 
open mouth,
 as 
wide


As are in length of's 
Ears;
 the 
Hide


By chance espy'd in 
clutch
 of 
Player


(Who much admir'd the 
twirle
 oth' 
hair
)


This 
pretty Muff
 for 
Lady-ware;


Who, as he nicely did it 
handle,


Upheaving 
Spectacle
 to 
candle,




Quoth he, This is some 
Popish shred,


Or 
shaving
 of some 
Fryer's head;


A piece of 
Nuns work,
 fastned on


The 
English Whore
 of 
Babylon,


Sent hither by the 
Lord
 knows 
whom,


No more then does the 
Pope of Rome.


An invention, 'twill move your laughter,


For us to run a whoring after.


So down he threw't, and fled from thence,


And troth I have not seen him since;


And (sooth to sayn) as matters go,


I care not wh're I do or no.


But 
Lady
 gay, who 
dropp'd
 the 
Muff,


It seems did know him well enough,


And having (as she thought) a 
claw


Against this 
Gospel-Wright
 at 
Law,


As having seen 
Commodity,


Last in his hands (though odd it be)


Unto her 
Lawyer
 did 
complain,


Who told her that her 
case
 was 
plain,


And 
Wright
 should render, or hee'd make him,


And 
where
 she 
found
 her 
goods,
 to take 'em.


But 
Presbyter
 having good witness,


That Stager's wife had try'd its 
fitnesse,


After it was from his hands given,


(Intending with her to be even)


Remov'd the 
cause
 with 
certiorari,


Where (as I hear) 'tis like to tarry.


But one thinks 'twould have done as well,


By petty Herauld with a Bell:


O yes!






If any one of what account


Soever in the Town or Count—


ry, Have ta'ne up an 
Instrument


Which 
Women
 use for 
Ornament




To set forth 
Member
 that is private


(As the 
main thing
 that people drive at)


Wherewith being 
drest,
 the naked 
Fubs


Looks not unlike the 
Ace
 of 
Clubs,


Or as the 
Song
 sayes that is 
told


By 
Fidler
 touching 
Marygold,


Which if it chance to 
slip,
 or so,


When as the 
Sign's
 in 
Scorpio,


The Mortal that was in 
conjunction,


Looks somewhat like the 
Man
 oth' 
Moon


That goes off with a 
bush
 on's 
back;


One cannot say — it's Eye is 
black:


But (as discerning 
Authors
 say)


The Ground is 
black,
 the Eye is 
gray,


Befitting 
Jane
 as well as 
Cisley,


Whose special mark is, that 
'tis grisley;


Whereby appears (as 
Damrose Page
 sed)


Such 
things
 are us'd amongst the 
aged.


But be she either 
Wife
 or 
Virgin,


Or 
Widow,
 'tis not worth the urging:


Did you but 
know,
 you'ld not deny her,


Who ever brings 
it
 to the 
Cryer,


Shall have for's pains in coming home,


The pleasure to 
cover
 and 
come.


'Till when the thousandth 
Maiden-head.


Is to be let unfurnished.




FINIS.
