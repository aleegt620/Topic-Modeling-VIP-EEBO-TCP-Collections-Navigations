A Description OF WALES BY S
R
 JOHN PRISE KNIGHT.


OXFORD,
 Printed by WILLIAM HALL 
Anno Salutis
 M. DC. LXIII.










A short description of CAMBRIA, now called WALES, drawne by Sir 
Iohn Prise
 Knight, and perused by 
Humphrey Lloyd
 Gentleman.


T
He three Sonnes of 
Brutus, Locri∣nus, Albanactus,
 and 
Camber
 divided the whole Isle of 
Bri∣taine
 into three Parts. The part contained within the 
French
 Seas, the Rivers 
Severne
 (called in Bri∣tish 
Hafren
) 
Dee
 and 
Humber
 fell to 
Locrinus
 the eldest son, from whom it was called 
Lloyger,
 which name it hath in the 
British
 tongue to this day, in 
English
 it is called 
England,
 and now extendeth it selfe Northward to the River 
Tweed;
 The 2d son 
Albana∣nactus
 had all the Country Northward from 
Humber
 to the Sea 
Orkney
 (called in the 
British
 tongue 
Môr Werydh,
 and in Latine 
Mare Caledonium
) for his Share; The 3d son 
Camber
 had the remaining part lying within the 
Spanish
 and 
Irish
 Seas, and separated from 
England
 by the Rivers 
Severne
 and 
Dee;
 this part was after his name called 
Cambria,
 the Inhabitants 
Cambry,
 and their Language 
Camberaec,
 as at this day; The Inhabitants of this part have kept their Country and Language about 2690 years, without commixtion with any other Na∣tion. This Country 
Cambria,
 in British 
Cymru,
 was called by the 
Saxons
 (a people of 
Germany
 that conquered and inhabi∣ted that part of Britaine called 
Lloyger
) 
Wales,
 and the Inha∣bitants and the Language, 
Welsh,
 which are words signifying 
strange;
 and the Inhabitants of High and Low 
Germany
 doe at this day call the Language they do not understand, 
Walsh,
 and the people that speake it, 
Welshmen;
 so that they are much de∣ceived,


who derive the word from a Queene called 
Gwalaes,
 or from a Prince named 
Wala;
 neither is the phancy of 
Polydor Virgil,
 who saith it was called 
Walia quasi Italia,
 because the remaining part of the 
Romans
 in the Isle were driven thither, to be approved of; 
Giraldus Cambrensis
 before him and others were guilty of the same mistake. That the Country was call∣ed 
Wales
 and the People 
Welsh
 by the 
Saxons
 (a strange Nati∣on) is evident, in that the 
Welsh
 know not what those words meane, their mother tongue teaching them only to call themselves 
Cymru
 and their Language 
Cymraec;
 And that they were not 
Romans
 that were driven into 
Cambria,
 the language doth sufficiently evince, which hath words that have no affinity at all with the 
Latine:
 it must needs be granted that many words are borrowed from the 
Latine,
 as it could not be o∣therwise, the 
Roman Legions
 and 
Colonies
 having been so long seated in the Country, but they are so different in termination that it requires some skill to discover the words that are of 
Ro∣man
 extraction.


The 
Saxons
 gaining still ground, the 
Britains
 were driven by them out of the plain, champion country on the other side the rivers 
Dee
 & 
Severne,
 especially by 
Offa
 K. of 
Mercia,
 who made a 
Ditch
 of great depth and breadth to be a 
Meare
 between his
 
Kingdom
 & 
Wales;
 the 
Ditch
 begins at the river 
Dee
 by 
Basing∣werke
 between 
Chester
 and 
Ruthlan,
 & runs along the sides of the hills to the 
South
 Sea a little from 
Bristoll;
 It reacheth above a 100 miles in length, and is in many places to be seene at this day; the 
Welsh
 call it 
Clawdh Offa;
 the Country between it and 
England
 is commonly called (in 
Welsh) Y Mars,
 although the greatest part thereof be now inhabited by the 
Welsh,
 espe∣cially in 
Northwales,
 which yet keepeth the ancient limits to the river 
Dee,
 and in some places reacheth beyond it.


Giraldus
 and others make the river 
Wy,
 in Welsh 
Gwy,
 to be the meare between 
England
 and 
Wales
 on the 
South
 part, the breadth of 
Wales
 from 
Salow
 or 
Willowford,
 in Welsh 
Rhyd yr helig
 upon 
Wy
 to S. 
Davids
 in 
Menevia
 is a 100 miles; also the length from 
Caerlleon
 upon 
Use
 in 
Gwentland
 to 
Holyhead
 or 
Caergybi
 in 
Anglesey,
 in Welsh 
Mon,
 is above a 100 miles; the 
Welsh
 tongue is at this day commonly spoken beyond these meares, as in 
Herefordshire, Glocestershire,
 and 
Shropshire.


About the yeare of Christ 870 
Rodericus Magnus
 divided
 
Wales
 into three 
Territories
 or 
Kingdomes,
 which were these, 1. 
Gwynedh,
 in English 
Northwales,
 in Latine 
Venedotia.
 2. 
De∣heubarth,
 in English 
Southwales,
 in Latine 
Demetia.
 3. 
Powis∣land.
 In each of these he ordained a Princely Seat or 
Court
 for the Prince to live at most commonly, as in 
Gwynedh, Aberffraw
 in the Ile of 
Môn
 or 
Anglesey;
 in 
Deheubarth, Caermardhyn,
 from whence it was removed to 
Dinevowr,
 eight miles thence;
 in 
Powys, Pengwern
 or 
Ymwythic,
 in English 
Shrewsbury,
 from whence it was removed to 
Mathraval
 in 
Powis
 land.




Of the Kingdome of 
Gwyneth
 or 
Aberffraw.


Rodri
 the 
Great
 gave 
Northwales
 to his eldest Sonne, and ordained that the other two should pay him (each of them) yearly by way of Tribute 2001, as appears by the Laws of 
Howel Dha. Northwales
 hath upon the North side the 
Sea,
 up∣on the West and Southwest the river 
Dyvi,
 which divideth it from 
Southwales,
 and in some places from 
Powis;
 it extends from the river 
Dee
 at 
Basingwerke
 to 
Aberdyvi;
 on the South and East it is divided from 
Powis
 sometimes with rivers, some∣times with mountains, till it comes to the River 
Dee
 againe. It was of old divided into foure parts, the first and chiefest where∣of was 
Môn,
 now called 
Anglesey,
 in which at 
Aberfraw
 the
 Prince had his chiefe house; It is an 
Island
 separated from the maine land by an arme of the Sea called 
Menai;
 It hath in it 
three
 Cantreds or Hundreds, which are subdivided into six Co∣mots, as 1. Cantref 
Aberfraw
 to Comot 
Llivon
 and 
Malliraeth:
 2. Cantref 
Cemais
 to 
Talebolion
 and 
Twrcelyn:
 and 3. Cantref 
Rossîr
 to 
Tindaethwy
 and 
Menai.
 It hath in it a neat, commo∣dious towne called 
B
umarish,
 also 
Newburgh,
 and a passage into 
Ireland
 at 
Caergybi,
 in English 
Holyhead.
 It is an egregious mi∣stake in 
Polydor,
 to deny this Isle the name of 
Mona,
 and al∣low it only to be called 
Anglesia
 or 
Anglorum Insula;
 and to give the name 
Mona
 to the Isle of 
Man,
 whereas the Inhabitants and throughout all Wales they know no other name for it, but 
Môn
 and 
Tîr Môn,
 that is, the Land of 
Môn
 unto this day, and that 
Man
 was never called 
Môn
 by any; the Inhabitants themselves call it 
Manaw,
 as the 
Welsh
 also doe. And 
Corn: Ta∣citus
 puts the matter out of question, when in the 
life
 of 
Agrico∣la
 he saith the 
Roman
 Souldiers swom over into 
Mona,
 which


it was impossible for them to doe into the Isle of 
Man
 being above 20 miles distant from the maine Land.


2. 
Arvon,
 which is as much to say as, 
Over against Môn,
 is
 the 2d part; it hath in it foure Cantreds and ten Comots.




1. Cantref 
Aber
 hath in it three Comots, 
Y Llechwedd uchaf, y Llechwedd isaf
 and 
Nanconwey.


2. Cantref 
Arvon
 hath two Comots, 
Uwch Gwyrvai,
 and 
Isgwyrvai.


3. Cantref 
Dunodic
 hath two Comots, 
Ardudwy
 and 
E∣vionyth.


4. Cantref 
Llyn
 containeth three Comots, 
Cymytmaen, Tinllayn,
 and 
Canologion.
 All these, except 
Ardudwy,
 which is now a part of 
Merionethshire,
 are in 
Carnarvonshire.
 In this shire are the 
Snowdon
 Hills, called 
Eryri,
 which for their fertili∣ty, height, wood, cattell, fish and fowle yeeld not to the fa∣mous 
Alps;
 and this Country is without controversy the strongest for situation within 
Britaine.
 Here are the Townes of 
Carnarvon,
 called in old time 
Caer Segont
 (
Segontium An∣tonini,
) of 
Conwey,
 called formerly 
Caergyffyn▪
 the 
See
 of 
Bangor, Pwllheli, Nevyn,
 the Castles of 
Crickieth, Dolathelan, Dolba∣darn: Dinas Dinlle, Clynnoc vawr, Ynys Enlli
 or 
Bardsey,
 and o∣ther ancient places. This was the last part of 
Wales
 brought under the dominion of the Kings of 
England:
 It hath on the North the Sea and 
Menai,
 upon the East and South-East the river 
Conwey,
 which divides it from 
Denbighshire
 in most pla∣ces, except it be toward the sea, where it passeth the river, and reacheth about five miles beyond it; on the South-west and West it is separated from 
Merionyth
 by high Mountains, Rivers and Meares.




3. 
Merionyth
 the third part of 
Gwyneth
 containing three
 Cantreds, each of which contains three Comots. 1. Cantref 
Meirion
 hath three Comots, 
Talybont, Pennal,
 and 
Ystymaner.
 2. Cantref 
Arustly
 hath, 
Uwchgoed, Iscoed, Gwarthrenion.
 3d. Cantref 
Penllyn,
 which hath 
Uwchmeloch, Ismeloch,
 and 
Mic∣naint.
 This Country keeps the said name to this day, but not all the same Meeres it had in former times; It is full of Hills and Rocks, it hath upon the North the Sea, to which there is great resort to take Herrings. It hath upon the East 
Arvon,
 and 
Denbigh
 land, upon the South 
Powis,
 upon the West 
Dyvi
 and



Cardiganshire.
 In this Country are the Townes of 
Harlech,
 where there is a strong Castle, 
Dolgelley
 and 
Bala,
 and here is the great Lake 
Llyn Tegyd,
 that is three miles long; of which it is said, that the River 
Dee
 running through it mingleth not with its water; moreover it is said that Salmons, commonly ta∣ken in the River hard by the Lake, are never seen in the Lake, and that a sort of fish called 
Gwyniaid
 are very common in the Lake, but never taken in the River. Not farre from the Poole is a place called 
Caergai,
 which was the house of 
Gai
 K. 
Ar∣thurs
 foster brother. This shire (like 
Arvon
) is full of Cattell, Fowle, and Fish, and hath good store of red Deere and Roes, but Corne is scarce.


4. The Fourth part of 
Gwyneth
 was called 
y Berveddwlâd,
 which may be Englished, the 
Inland
 or 
Middle
 Country; It contained Five Cantreds, and Thirteen Comots, as 1. Cantref 
Rhyvonioc,
 which hath in it these Comots, 
Vwchalet
 & 
Isalet.
 2. Cantref 
Ystrat,
 which hath 
Hiraethoc
 & 
Cynmeirch.
 3 Cantref 
Rôs,
 which hath 
Uwchdulas, Isdulas
 & 
Creuthyn,
 all which are in the Lordship of 
Denbigh,
 except 
Creuthyn,
 which is a part of 
Carnarvonshire,
 and hath in it the Castle of 
Diganwy,
 which did belong to the Earles of 
Chester,
 and in the Latine and Eng∣lish Chronicles is commonly called 
Gannoc.
 4. Cantref 
Dyffryn Clwyd,
 that is, the Valley of 
Clwyd,
 it is now called the Lordship of 
Ruthyn,
 and hath these Comots, 
Coleigion, Llanerch
 and 
Do∣gueilyn.
 5th. Cantref is 
Tegengl,
 now a part of 
Flintshire,
 it hath these Comots, 
Counsyllt, Prestatyn
 and 
Ruthlan.
 In this part of 
Gwyneth
 is the faire valley of 
Dyffryn Clwyd,
 which reacheth 18 miles in length, and is in breadth 4, 5, 6, and in some places 7 miles: Northward it borders on the Sea, and on the East, West, and South it is inclosed with high hills: It a∣bounds with all manner of necessaries both for Man and Beast, as Cattell, Fish, Fowle, Corne, Hay, Grasse, Wood, &c. The river 
Clwyd
 being increased by the accession of 
Clywedoc, Ystrat, Whilar, Elwey
 and other rivers from the hills runnes along and divides it in the midst. In this Valley two miles from the Sea doe stand the Towne and Castle of 
Ruthlan,
 famous for a 
Parlia∣ment
 K. 
Edward
 I. kept there in the 12 yeare of his Reigne. And two miles above it is the See of S. 
Asaph
 called in old time 
Llanelwey,
 between the Rivers 
Clwyd
 and 
Elwey:
 foure miles


thence and two miles from the river 
Clwyd
 lies situate 
Denbigh,
 the Shire towne for that County, in which there is a very faire, strong Castle built upon a rock, which was very much enlarged and strengthened by 
Henry Lacy
 Earle of 
Lincolne,
 to whom King 
Edward
 gave the Lordship of 
Denbigh:
 five miles above this lies the towne of 
Ruthin,
 wherein is a faire Castle, which did sometimes belong to the 
Grays
 Lords of 
Ruthyn
 and Earles of 
Kent.
 This part of 
Gwyneth
 hath upon the North the river 
Dee
 and the Sea; upon the West, 
Arvon
 and the river 
Conwey;
 South and East 
Merionyth
 and 
Powis;
 these be the Meeres and Bounds of 
Gwyneth.
 So there was under the Kingdome of 
A∣berfraw
 15 Cantreds and 38 Comots. But 
Northwales,
 as it is now reckoned sixe shires, containeth in it besides 
Gwyneth
 a great part of 
Powis.


The 
British
 Chronicle saith of 
Northwales,
 that it came by in∣heritance to Women three times: 1. To 
Stradwen
 daughter to 
Cadvan
 ap 
Conan
 ap 
Endaf
 & Wife to 
Coel Godeboc,
 Mother to 
Genaw, Dyvyr
 & 
Gwawl:
 the second time to the same 
Gwawl
 wife to 
Edern
 ap 
Padern
 & Mother to 
Cunetha Wledic,
 which 
Cune∣tha
 being a Prince in the 
North
 of 
England,
 about the yeare of Christ 540 sent his sonnes to recover 
Cardigan
 his inheri∣tance
 from the 
Irish Scots
 and 
Picts,
 who had possessed them∣selves of those parts of it which bordered upon the Sea; 
Tibiaon
 his eldest sonne dyed in 
Man,
 which the 
Irish Scots
 had con∣quered; 
Gildas
 saith, that of the Progeny of 
Glam-Hector,
 that peopled a great part of 
Ireland, Yscroeth
 with his people in∣habited 
Dalrienda,
 a part of 
Scotland. Builke
 with his people came to 
Man. Builke cum filiis suis inhabitavit
 Euboniam 
In∣sulam, vulgò
 Manaw, 
quae est in meditullio Maris inter
 Hyberniam 
&
 Britanniam. The Children of 
Bethoun
 inhabited 
Demetia,
 or Southwales, with 
Gwyr
 and 
Cydweli,
 untill they were chased thence by the Children of 
Cunetha.
 thus farre 
Gildas.
 The sons of 
Cunetha
 being arrived in 
North wales
 divided the Coun∣try betwixt them: first 
Meireaon
 the sonne of 
Tibiaon
 the son of 
Cunedha
 had Cantref 
Meireaon
 to his part. 
Arustel
 ap 
Cune∣tha
 had Cantref 
Arustly. Caredic
 ap 
Cunetha
 had 
Caredigion,
 now 
Cardiganshire. Dunod
 had Cantref 
Dunodic. Edeyrn
 had 
Edeyrnion. Mael
 had 
Dynmael. Coel
 had 
Coleyon. Dogvael
 had 
Dogveilyn. Ryvaon
 had 
Ryvonioc
 now 
Denbigh▪ land. Maelor



the son of 
Gwran
 the son of 
Cunetha
 had 
Maeloron,
 that is, the two 
Maelors, Maelor Gymbraeg,
 called 
Bromfield,
 and 
Maelor Saesneg. E
n Yrch
 had 
Caereneon
 in 
Powis. Vssa
 had 
Maesu∣s
 now 
Oswestree:
 What they say commonly of 
Oswald
 K. of 
Northumberland,
 that he was slaine there, and that a Well sprung up where his Arme was carried, is nothing so: for 
Beda
 and all other writers testify that 
Peanda
 slew 
Oswald
 at 
Maser∣felt
 in the Kingdome of 
Northumberland,
 and his body was bu∣ried in the 
Abbey
 of 
Bardney
 in the Province of 
Lyndesey.
 These names given by the Progeny of 
Cunetha
 continue to this day. After this the 
Irish Picts
 which the 
Britains
 called 
Y Gwyddyl Phictiaid
 overran the Isle of 
Môn,
 from whence they were dri∣ven by 
Caswalhon Law hîr,
 that is, 
Caswalhon
 with the long hand, the son of 
Eneon yrch
 ap 
Cunetha,
 who with his own hands slew 
Serigi
 their King at 
Llan y Gwyddyl,
 that is, the 
Irish
 Church in 
Holy head.
 This 
Caswalhon
 was Father to 
Maelgon Gwyneth,
 whom the Latines call 
Maglocunus,
 King of 
Britaine:
 In his time lived the famous Bard 
Taliessyn
 who was called 
Pen Beirdh,
 that is, the chiefest of the 
Bards
 or 
Wisemen. Lucan
 in his first book of the Civil warre between 
Caesar
 and 
Pompey
 makes mention of our 
Bards
 thus, 
Plarima securi fudistis carmi∣na Bardi:
 This 
Maelgon
 had a son called 
Run,
 in whose time, the 
Saxons
 invited 
Gurmond
 (who had come from 
Afric,
) from 
Ireland
 to joyne with them against the 
Britains,
 who by him and them were greatly distressed, drove first over 
Severne,
 and slaine, as many as were known of them to professe 
Christ.
 This 
Run
 was Father to 
Beli,
 who was Father to 
Iago
 (or 
Iames
) who, and not 
Brochwel
 or 
Brecyval
 (as the English Chronicle saith) was Father to 
Cadvan,
 the Father of 
Cadwalhon,
 the Father of 
Cadwalader
 the last King of the 
Britains. Brochwel,
 surnamed 
Ysgithroc,
 by reason of his long teeth, was Captain over those who fought with 
Adelred
 aliàs 
Ethelbert
 King of 
Kent,
 and his 
Saxons
 and 
Angles,
 whom 
Augustin
 the Monke had incited to make warre against the 
Christian
 Britains. 
Bro∣chwel
 was twice put to flight by them not farre from 
Chester,
 and they cruelly slew a 1000 Priests and Monkes of 
Bangor,
 with a great number of 
Lay
 Brethren of the same 
house
 that li∣ved by the labour of their hands, and were come bare-footed to desire mercy and Peace. Then 
Brochwel
 retired over 
Dee,
 and


defending the passages against the 
Saxons,
 untill 
Cadvan K.
 of 
Northwales, Meredyth
 K. of 
Southwales,
 and 
Bledrus
 or 
Bletius
 Prince of 
Cornwall
 came to his aide, he gave the 
Saxons
 battell and slew of them a 1066, and put the rest to flight. After this Battel 
Cadvan
 was chosen King of 
Britaine,
 and was the chief Ruler within the Isle.


3. The 3d time that 
Northwales
 came to a Woman was to 
Esyllt,
 the daughter of 
Conan Tindaethwy,
 the son of 
Edwal Ywrch,
 the son of K. 
Cadwalader,
 The 
British
 Annals say, 
Conan
 was the son of 
Rodric Molwynoc
 son of the sayd 
Edwal.
 She was wife to 
Mervyn Bhrych
 and Mother to 
Roderic
 the 
Great.


The last Kings of the 
Britains
 finding 
Northwales
 to be a Coun∣try exceeding strong, as being full of high Mountains, craggy rocks, great Woods, deep Valleys, streights and dangerous pla∣ces, and deepe and swift Rivers, made it their chiefest Seate. The chiefe Rivers in 
Gwyneth
 are, 
Dyvi,
 which springs in the Hills of 
Merioneth,
 runnes North-west by 
Mowthwy
 and 
Machyn∣llaeth,
 and so to the sea at 
Aberdyvi;
 it divides 
Northwales
 and 
Southwales. Dee,
 in Welsh 
Dourdwy,
 springs also from the same hills, runs East through 
Penllyn
 and the Lake 
Tegid,
 downe to 
Corwen
 & 
Llangollen,
 between 
Chirke
 land & 
Bromfield,
 where it bowes Northward towards 
Bangor iscoed,
 so to 
Holt
 & 
Chester,
 thence Northwest to 
Flint Castle,
 and so to the Sea. 
Conwey,
 which riseth likwise in 
Merionethshire,
 runs under 
Snowdon
 North-East, by the Towne of 
Aberconwey
 to the Sea. 
Avon Wy∣nen,
 that fals into the sea at 
Traeth Mawr. Yvelenryd,
 which the sea receives at 
Traeth bachan. Mouthau,
 that falls into the Sea at 
Bermouth. Desynny. Alwen. Lleder. Llygwy. Machno. Ogwen. Cegid. Seint,
 which runs to the Sea at 
Carnarvon. Gwrvai. Llivon. Llyfni. Dwyvôr. Dwyvech. Erch. Soch. Clwyd,
 which riseth in 
Denbigh
-la
d, runs downe to 
Ruthin,
 and plaine North, not farre from 
Denbigh,
 to St 
Asaph,
 and so by 
Ruthlan
 to the Sea. 
Cefni. Dulas. Aled. Elwey. &c.
 Among the Mountains in 
Carnar∣von
 and 
Merioneth
 Shires there are very many 
Llynns
 or 
Lakes
 abounding with large 
Trouts;
 In the River 
Conwey
 there is a sort of Fish called 
Brwyniaid,
 which they use to take from the mid∣dle of 
March
 to the middle of 
April.
 And in two Pooles, to wit, 
Llynn Peris
 and 
Llynn Torthenni,
 which are about three miles asunder, there is a Fish called 
Torgoch,
 from his red belly, which, when the season is to take it in the one, is not to be found in the other.








Of 
Deheubarth
 or 
Dinevowr.


This Kingdome although it was the largest, yet was it not
 the best (in 
Giraldus
 his opinion) when the Division was made, in regard it was much infested with the 
Saxons,
 and afterwards with 
Flemings
 and 
Normans,
 and for that in divers parts there∣of the Lords would not obey their Prince, as in 
Gwent
 and 
Morgannwc:
 It was divided into six Parts. 1. 
Caredigion
 was the first, it contained 4 Cantreds and 10 Comots, 1. Can∣tref

Radnorshire,
 formerly a part of

 are now com∣monly called 
Southwales:
 It is a large Country having many faire Plaines and Valleys for Corne, high Mountains full of Pasture for Cattell, great and thick Woods, Forrests and Parks for red Deere and Fallow: cleare and deepe Rivers full of Fish. The Rivers are,

 his time there were in this River (above other Rivers) a great number of 
Bevers,
 a kind of beast the 
Welsh
 called 
A∣vanc;
 the name remaineth still in 
Wales,
 but what it was very few can describe: It is not much unlike an Otter, only it is bigger, all hairy saving the tail, which is like a fishes tail, broad and thick like a mans hand: It useth as well the water as the land, hath very sharp teeth, and is a very sagacious Creature: He that will learne more of this beast, let him read 
Girald. Itiner. l.

Cledhe
 in 
Pembroke∣shire, Remney, Gevenni, Arth, Aeron, Ystwyth &c.


There are divers Lordships added to other Shires, that were heretofore taken for parts of 
Wales,
 and have at this day the 
Welsh
 spoken in most of them, as 
Oswestree, Knocking, Whitington, Elsmer, Masbrooke, Cherbury, Gaurs, Clunn,
 which are now in 
Shropshire; Ewyas Lacy, Ewyas Haroald, Clifford, Winsor∣ton, Yardley, Huntingdon, Whitn
y, Loghardneys
 in 
Herefordshire.


Southwales,
 as all the rest of 
Britaine,
 was first inhabited by 
Britains,
 who remain there to this day, though in divers places, especially neare the Sea, mingled with 
Saxons, Normans,
 and 
Flemings.
 Since the 
Norman
 Conquest their Princes could never keepe quiet possession of it, but by reason of opposition from Strangers, and the disloyalty of their own people, & vexation and war thereupon, they were for the most part compelled to keepe themselves in 
Carmarthenshire.






Of 
Powis
 or 
Mathraval.


To this Kingdome belonged the Country of 
Powis
 and the
 Land between 
Wy
 and 
Severne.
 It was bordered upon the South and West with 
Southwales,
 the rivers 
Wy
 and 
Tywy &c.
 upon the North with 
Gwyneth;
 and with the 
Marches
 of 
England,
 from 
Chester
 to 
Wy,
 a little above 
Hereford,
 upon the East; By reason of its nearnes to 
England
 it was most troubled with wars, from the 
Saxons
 first, and afterwards from the 
Normans,
 Lords 
Mar∣chers,
 who daily conquered some portion thereof, by which means it came to passe, that it was the first part that submitted unto and served the 
King
 of 
England.
 This part called 
Powis
 was divided into 
Powis Vadoc
 & 
Powis Wenwynwyn. Powys Va∣doc
 contained in it 5 Cantreds and 15 Comots. 1. Cantref 
Y Barwn,
 which hath 3 Comots,

 the three first Can∣treds only beare the name of 
Powys
 at this day. This is a Coun∣try full of Woods, Hills and Rivers: it hath in it these Townes, the 
Poole
 (in Welsh 
Trallwng
) 
Newtowne, Machynllaeth
 and 
Llanvylling. Arustly

 they speake to this day 
Welsh

 So there are in this Territory or Kingdome of 
Mathraval
 14 Cantreds and 40 Comots.


Camden,

The Printer to the Reader.


BE Pleased, Gentle Reader, to take this short account of the 
British Annals
 following, as also of this and the former Edition thereof. 
Caradoc
 of 
Lancarvan
 collected the 
Acts
 and 
Successions
 of the 
British Princes
 from 
Cad∣walader
 to the yeare of Christ 1156. Of his 
Collections
 there were afterward severall 
Copies
 kept in the 
Abbeys
 of 
Conwey
 in 
Car∣narvonshire,
 and of 
Strata Florida
 or 
Stra
flur
 in 
Cardigan∣shire,
 which received addition as things fell out, being ordinarily compared together every third yeare, to wit, when the 
Bards
 or 
Beirdh
 belonging to those 
Abbeys
 went their ordinary Visitation (which they called 
Clera
) from the one to the other; They contai∣ned in them (besides) such other occurrences happening within the Isle of 
Britaine,
 as were thought worthy the 
Recording.
 This Course continued in those 
Abbeys
 untill the yeare of Christ 1270, which was a little before the death of the last Prince 
Llewelyn,
 who was slaine at 
Buellt.
 Of these 
Collections
 there were a 100 Copies at least in 
Wales
 very anciently written. 
Humphrey Lloyd
 Gentleman (a painfull and worthy searcher of 
British
 Antiquities) lighting upon one of the Copies, translated it into 
English,
 and augmented it somewhat, out of 
Matt. Paris
 and 
Nicolas Trivet
 chiefely, but left it imperfect, God being pleased to take him away before he had finished it, as he had designed. The Right Honoura∣ble 
Sir Henry Sidney
 Lord President of 
Wales,
 having had a Copy of his 
Translation
 a great while lying by him, employed 
David Powel
 Doctor of Divinity to Peruse, Correct, Augment, and Con∣tinue it in order to the setting of it out in Print. The 
Doctor
 at his request compared the translation with the 
British
 Booke, where∣of he had two ancient Copies, and corrected it where he saw cause. Moreover he consulted all Authors he could come by, that treat of the affaires of 
Wales,
 as 
Gildas, Asser Menevens., Galfrid, Wil∣liam
 of 
Newborough, Matt. Paris, Matt. Westminster, Thomas Walsingham, Ponticus Virunnius, Polydor Virgil, Jo. Leland, Jo. Bale, J. Prise, Matt. Parker, Jo. Caius, William Lambard,



and all the 
English
 Chronicles Printed; and in MS. 
Gildas Sapi∣ens
 aliàs 
Nennius, Hen. Huntington, William Malmesbury, Ma∣rianus Scotus, Ralph Cogshall, Jo. Eversden, Nic. Trivet, Flo∣rentius Vigorniensis, Simon
 of 
Durham, Roger Hoveden,
 and other which 
John Stow
 Citizen of 
London
 had got together, the 
British
 books of 
Pedegrees, Jo. Castoreus, Sylvester Girald. Cambr.
 with divers other Pieces of Antiquity he had received from the Right Honourable the Lord 
Burleigh
 High Treasurer of 
England,
 who had also by his Letters directed him to all the 
Offi∣ces
 where the 
Records
 of the 
Realme
 were kept: Out of which he gathered Notes (though not so many as he would, if time and his occasions had permitted him) which with the 
Book
 he Printed A. D. 1584, and Dedicated to the Famous 
Sir Philip Sidney
 Knight. Some of the Notes he 
added
 where he sound they were wanting, and some other, where the matter was delivered briefly and obscurely, for the better clearing of the Text he 
inserted
 in their due places in the 
Booke.
 Also he gave in the 
Margent
 exact 
quotations
 of the 
Authors,
 as well where they agree with the Book as when they are brought to Adde to it, or for further Explanation. In his Notes touching Families he was greatly furthered by the Paines of 
Sir Edw. Stradling
 Knight, 
Thomas Powel
 of 
Whi∣tington Parke,
 and 
Richard Broughton
 Esquires. And the Book would have come out much more exactly done, had it not bin Printed almost quite off, when he received another Larger, and better cor∣rected Copy of the 
Translation
 from 
Robert Glover
 Somerset Herald: So much touching the former 
Edition
 out of Dr 
Powell's
 Epist. Dedicat. As concerning this latter, 
Robert Vaughan

Cadvvalader 
Bhendiged, 
That is,
 The SAINT or BLESSED, in whom ended the 
British
 Kingdome, whereupon the Government of 
Wales
 by 
PRINCES
 began.


C
ADWALADER
 the last King of the
 Britains of the Noble 
Trojan
 Race, be∣ing by reason of a great famine and mortality driven to forsake his Realm and native Country, went over with a great number of his Nobility and Sub∣jects to 
Lhydaw
 (now called 
Little Britaine
 in 
France)
 there to so journe with his Cousin 
Alan
 King of the Country. And he had not been there long but intelligence arrived to him of the landing of strangers, as 
Saxons, Angles,
 and 
Juthes
 in
 his Kingdome of 
Great Britaine,
 which they finding desolate and without Inhabitants (sabe a few 
Saxons
 who had invi∣ted them in, and a small remnant of poore 
Britons,
 who in Rocks and Woods by feeding upon roots prolonged a mise∣rable life) did soon over-run and possesse themselves of a great part thereof. And dividing it into severall Territo∣ries


and Kingdomes, inhabited that part which was then and now (at this day) is called 
Lhoyger
 in the Brytish or 
Welsh
 tongue, and in English 
England,
 with all the Cities, Townes, Castles, and Uillages, which the 
Britains
 had buil∣ded, ruled and inhabited by the space of 1827 years, under diverse Kings and Princes of great renowne: whereupon he purposed to returne, and by strength of 
British
 Knights to recover his own land again.


But having made ready his Navy for the transporting of his forces, which were partly his own men, and partly such succours as he had received from his Cousin 
Alan,
 an 
Angell
 appeared to him, who declared it to be the will of God that he should not take his voyage towards 
Britaine,
 but to 
Rome
 to Pope 
Sergius,
 where he should make an end of his life, and be afterwards numbred among the 
blessed:
 for GOD had appointed that the Britaines should have no more the Rule and Governance of the whole Ile, untill the Pro∣phesy of 
Merlin Ambrose
 should be fulfilled.


Having acquainted his friend 
Alan
 with his 
Vision,
 and the message of the 
Angel, Alan
 immediately consulted all his
 books of Prophesies, as the works of both 
Merlins;
 of 
Merlin Ambrose
 (who lived in the time of King 
Vortiger
) and of 
Merlin Sylvester,
 or 
Merdhin Wylht,
 (who flourished (after) in King 
Arthurs
 time) and also the words which the 
Eagle
 spake
 at the building of 
Caer Septon,
 now called 
Shaf
sbury;
 and after long study found the time to be now come, whereof they had Prophe
ied.


{fleur-de-lys} Little 
Britaine
 is a Country in 
France,
 called in 
Caesars
 time, 
Armorica,
 and after inhabited by 
Britains,
 who about the
 year of Christ 384. under the conduct of 
Conan
 Lord of 
Meria∣doc,
 now 
Denbighland,
 went out of this Ile with 
Maximus
 the Tyrant, to his aid against the Emperour 
Gratianus,
 and winn∣ing the said Country of 
Armorica
 (which 
Maximus
 gave 
Co∣nan
 and his People) slue and drove out all the old Inhabitants thereof, planting themselves in the same, where they to this day speak the 
British
 tongue, being the third remnant of the ancient 
Britains.

Slaine by his own men, and then was that King∣dome turned to an Earledome, whereof one

was the first Earle, who valiant∣ly resisted the
 Nor∣mans, 
vanquishing them in severall Bat∣tles.




Concerning the words of the 
Eagle
 at the building of 
Caer
 
Septon
 in 
Mount Paladour
 in the time of 
Rudhudibras,
 in the year after the Creation of the World, 3048. some think that an 
Eagle
 did then speak and Prophesy: Other are of opinion, that it was a 
Britaine
 named 
Aquila
 that Prophesied of these things, and of the recovery of the whole Ile again by the 
Britains,
 bringing with them the bones of 
Cadwalader
 from 
Rome,
 as in the said Prophesies is to be seen.


Alan
 hereupon counselled 
Cadwalader
 to fulfill the will of God in going to 
Rome,
 which he did; and after he had lived there eight years in the service of God he dyed in the yeare of Christ 688, So that the 
Britains
 ruled this Ile, with the


out-Iles, of 
Wight: Môn,
 in English called 
Anglesey: Manaw,
 in English, 
Man: Orkney
 and 
Ewyst, 1137.
 years before Christ, untill the yeare of his incarnation 688. And thus ended the Rule of the 
Britains
 over the whole Ile.


{fleur-de-lys} The 
Britains
 being sore troubled with the 
Scots
 and 
Picts,
 and denied aid of the 
Romans,
 sent for the 
Saxons
 to come to de∣fend them against their Enemies: who coming at the first as friends to the 
Britains,
 liked the country so well, that they became their mortall enemies, and drove them out of the same.


About the yeare of Christ. 590. 
Gurmundus
 an arch-pirate
 and Captaine of the 
Norwegians,
 after that he had conquered 
Ireland,
 being called by the 
Saxons
 to their aid against 
Careticus
 King of the 
Britains,
 overcame the same 
Careticus
 in battell, and compelled him and his 
Britains
 to flee beyond the rivers of 
Sea∣verne
 and 
Dee
 to 
Cambria
 (now called 
Wales
) and to 
Corn∣wall,
 and some to 
Britaine Armorike,
 where they remaine to this day, and gave 
Loegria
 (now 
England
) to the 
Saxons.
 And al∣beit that 
Cadvan, Cadwalhon,
 and 
Cadwalader
 were since intituled 
Kings
 of all 
Britaine,
 yet they could never afterwards recover the quiet possession of the whole Iland. After the de∣parture of 
Cadwalader
 out of the Land, the 
Britains
 were govern∣ed within the Country of 
Wales
 or 
Cambria
 by those men, whereof this history following doth intreat, which were commonly called 
Kings
 of such Provinces and Countries as they possessed, untill the time of 
Owen Gwyneth,
 who being in the daies of King 
Stephen,
 and 
Henry
 the second, was the first that named himselfe 
Prince
 of 
Wales,
 and so the rest after him kept that title and stile: and yet neverthelesse, they are sometimes called 
Princes
 before his time, and 
Kings
 after him, as I have observed by diverse Charters and old Records, which I have seen in the Tower of 
London
 and else∣where. Howbeit, this Author calleth the chiefest of them 
Kings
 till the time of the said 
Owen,
 and since, 
Princes.


¶ Some say that 
Cadwalader
 was the sonne of 
Cadwallan
 by
 the sister of 
Penda
 King of 
Mercia,
 and that he is the same that 
Beda
 calleth young 
Cadvalla.


He beareth 
B.
 a Crosse pateé fitcheé 
Or.
 Which coate of


armes was also borne by his sonne 
Ivor,
 who was slaine by the 
Saxons,
 and succeeded by his Nephew 
Ive,
 who was Crowned and Annointed 
King,
 not upon the account of his being a 
Bri∣tain,
 but because he had 
Saxon
 blood running in his veines, his Father being one 
Renten
 of the 
British
 race, and his Mo∣ther of the 
Saxon.
 This 
Ive
 Reigned 37 years, he was a wise and a provident Prince, he bare the fore▪mentioned Armes of K. 
Cadwalader
 as long as he lived, & so did the rest of the Kings untill the time of King 
Edward
 the First, so 
Nic. Upon de offic∣militar. Humphred: Duc. Glocest.


After three years of his Reigne he went to 
Rome,
 in the time of Pope 
Sergius
 about the yeare of our Lord 690. so 
Po∣lychron.


Cadwalader
 the 
Blessed
 being much weakned by a continuall war with the 
Saxons,
 which was attended with a great famine, & a raging pestilence, is said to retire with his Nobility to 
Little Britaine,
 where being kindly received by 
Alan
 King of the Country he lived, untill news was brought to him, that the plague began to coole and cease; then having obtained aid of his Cousin 
Alan
 for the recovering of his Kingdome he pre∣pareth for his returne. But one night, as he lay a bed, an An∣gell appearing to him, and telling him, that it was Gods will he should goe to 
Rome,
 and there spend the rest of his dayes in the service of God, and that it was declared that neither he nor his posterity should have the chiefe rule of 
Britaine,
 untill the time that his bones were brought back from 
Rome
 to 
Britaine,
 made him alter his resolution, and goe to 
Rome
 A. D. 680, where after he had lived eight years he dyed 688 or 689 in Pope 
Sergius
 his time, as 
Galfr. Mon:; Cadwalader
 being much dismayed and perplexed at the Vision, 
Quaesivit causam tanti maligni in Regnosuo,
 as is recorded in an old Book, 
Cui Angelus respondens dixit, Negligentia Praelatorum, rapina poten∣tum, cupiditas Iudicum, detestanda luxuria, rabies perjurorum, & inordinatus Cultus vestimentorum.


There are some Authors say, that the time of the great pe∣stilence and mortality, and consequently of 
Cadwaladers
 going to 
Rome
 was before the yeare 680. 
Beda
 saith, the pestilence happened A. D. 664. 
Nennius
 or whoever is the Author of the Tract beginning thus, 
Woden genuit Beldoc &c.
 (who by



Leland, Bale & S. Simon Dewes
 is said to live in the declining age of the 
British
 Empire, 
that is,
 in the time of 
Cadwallan
 and 
Cad∣walader
 Kings of 
Britaine,
 and 
Penda
 King of 
Mercia
) averreth that the mortality aforesaid hapenned in the Reigne of 
Oswi
 King of 
Northumberland,
 and of 
Cadwalaeder
 King of the 
Bri∣tains. Oswi
 began his Reigne A. D. 643. and dyed 670, so that the year wherein, as 
Beda
 saith, the plague began, was a∣bout the 22 or 23 yeare of 
Oswis
 Reigne, at what time also 
Cadwalader
 ruled the 
Britains.
 For farther confirmation, there is an old 
British
 Chronology written on parchment 400 years agoe, which saith that from the battell of 
Caerlegion
 or 
Westchester
 fought A. D. 603 (between 
Ethelfred
 King of 
Northumberland
 Generall of the 
English
 and 
Brochwel Ysgythroc
 Leader of the 
Britains
) to 
Cadwaladers
 going to 
Rome
 is 62 years, which 62 years added to 603 will make 665, the time about which the Pestilence, as 
Beda
 and the rest say, reged in 
Britaine. Ieffrey
 of 
Monmouth
 who saith that 
Cadwalader
 dyed in Pope 
Sergius
 his time on the 12 of the calends of May, seems to mistake 
Cadwalader
 for 
Cadwalla
 King of the 
West-Saxons,
 who went to 
Rome
 688, being the 3d year of the Reigne of 
Alfred
 King of 
Northumberland
 as 
Beda
 in the 7 and 8 Chap∣ters of the 5 book of his 
Ecclesiasticall History,
 and also 
S. Hen. Savil
 doe affirme; upon Easter day following this 
Cadwallae
 was Baptized and dyed the 12 of the Calends of May 689, but in our old 
British
 Calendars we find the 12 day of 
November
 to be consecrated to the memory of K. 
Cadwalader,
 which is to be reckoned the day of his death, or second Birth; 
Caradoc
 (our Author) as well as 
Ieffrey
 is mistaken in the time of 
Cadwala∣ders
 going to 
Rome,
 and probably upon the same grounds.


In the old 
MS.
 text we read that after 
Cadwalader, Ivor
 sonne of 
Alan
 King of 
Little Britain
 ruled 48 years & then dyed. And after him 
Rodri Molwynoc,
 but no yeare put downe; the Trans∣lators (it seems) found in some Copies that 
Rodri
 began his Reigne A. D. 720: take 48 out of 720 there will remaine 672 which must be the yeare of our Lord, that 
Ivor
 came into 
Bri∣taine,
 by that account, 
that is
 8 years before 
Cadwalader
 went out of 
Britaine,
 which is not probable, so that we may conclude the 
account of
 time 
Ieffrey
 and 
Caradoc
 give us as to this parti∣cular very uncertaine. Adde the three years 
Caedwalader
 resided


in 
Litle Britain
 to 665 which out of 
Ninnius, Beda &c.
 is proved to be the yeare of 
Cadwaladers
 going for 
Rome,
 his going thi∣ther may be said to fall A. D. 668, unto which adde the 48 years of 
Ivors
 Reigne, the whole will be 716, wherein 
Ivor
 may be supposed to dye, being but foure years short of the yeare 720, which the Translators assigne for the beginning of 
Rodri Molwynocs
 Reigne; the reason inducing the Translators to assigne that yeare (peradventure) might be this, 
viz.
 that 
Ivas
 King of the 
West-Saxons,
 whom they confound with 
Ivor,
 went to 
Rome
 in the same yeare.


King 
Cadwalader
 was a Benefactor to the 
Abbey
 of 
Clynnoc Vawr
 in 
Arvon,
 as may be seen in the 
Extent
 of 
North-wales,
 which is in the keeping of the 
Auditor,
 and in the 2d volume os 
Monasticon Anglicanum
 published by M. 
Dugdale,
 to whom I sent the following account of the endowing of the said Abbey as it was taken out of the said

St 
Beuno,
 to whom the Abbey of 
Clynoc
 was dedicated, was the Sonne of 
Hywgi
 ap 
Gwynlliw
 ap 
Glywis
 ap 
Tegid
 ap 
Cadell
 a Prince or Lord of 
Gl
wisig,
 Brothers sonne to S. 
Cadoc
 ap 
Gwynlliw
 sometime Bishop of 
Beneventum
 in 
Italy;
 He was by the Mothers side Cousin German to 
Laudatus
 the first Abbot of 
Enlli
 (in English 
Bardsey
) and to 
Kentigern
 Bishop of 
Glasco
 in 
Scotland,
 and of 
Llanelwey
 in 
Wales.
 The said 
Centigerns
 fa∣ther was 
Owen
 Regent of 
Scotland
 and sonne of 
Urien
 King of 
Cumbria. Beuno
 having raised to life, as the tradition goes, S. 
Wenifryd
 (who was beheaded by one 
Caradoc
 a Lord in 
North-wales
 because shee would not yeeld to his unchast desires) was greatly respected by King 
Cadvan,
 who gave him Lands, whereon to build a 
Monastery. Cadwallon Cadvans
 sonne also gave him lands called 
Gwareddoc,
 where beginning to build a


Church, a woman came to him with a Child in her armes, who told him the said Lands were the Inheritance of the said Child: this did trouble 
Beuno
 exceedingly, insomuch that hee and the said woman along with him went in all hast to 
Caer Seiont
 (called by the Romans 
Segontium,
 now 
Carnarvon
) to K. 
Cadwallon,
 who then kept his Court there. When he came before the King, he told him with a great deale of zeale, he had not done well to devote to Gods service another mans inheritance, and demanded of him back againe the golden Scepter he had given him as a consideration for the said Lands, which the King refusing to restore was without more adoe excommunicated by him; 
Beuno
 after he had pronounced his sentence against him went his waies, but 
Gwyddeint
 a cou∣sen german of the King's having heard of it followed after him, and overtaking him gave him (for the good of his own soule and the King's) the Towneship of 
Clynnoc vawr,
 which was his undoubted inheritance: there 
Beuno
 built a 
Church
 a∣bout the yeare of our Lord 616 about what time 
Cadvan
 dyed
 leaving his sonne 
Cadwallon
 to succeed him. Some say 
Beuno
 recovered 
S. Wenifryd
 to life in the yeare 644, but that a∣greeth not with the truth of History. Not long before this time 
Eneon Bhrenin,
 or 
Anianus
 Rex 
Scotorum,
 a Prince in the North of 
Brytaine
 leaving his Royalty came to 
Llyn
 in 
Gwy∣neth,
 where he built a 
Church,
 which is at this day called (from him) 
Llan Eingan Bhrenin;
 It is said that there, in the service of his God, he spent the remainder of his daies; K. 
Eneon
 was the sonne of 
Owen Danwyn,
 the sonne of 
Eneon Yrth,
 the sonne of 
Cunedha Wledig
 King of 
Cambria,
 and a great Prince in the 
North.
 He was cousen german to 
Maelgwn Gwyneth
 King of 
Britaine,
 whose Father was 
Caswallon Law-hîr,
 brother to 
Owen Danwyn.
 The sayd 
Maelgon
 dyed about the yeare of our Lord 586. 
Medif
 daughter to 
Voylda
 ap 
Talu traws
 of 
N
n∣conwey
 was 
Maelgons
 mother.








Edvval 
Ywrch
 and Iuor.


AFter that 
Cadwalader
 had taken his journey to∣wards
 
Rome,
 as before is declared, leaving his Sonne named 
Edwal▪ 
Ywrch,
 that is to say, 
Ed∣wal
 the 
Roe
 and his people with his Cousen 
Alan, Alan
 taking courage to him, and not de∣spairing of the conquest of 
Britaine,
 manned his ships as
 well with a great number of his own people, as with those which 
Cadwalader
 had brought with him, and appoint∣ed 
Ivor
 his sonne, and 
Ynyr
 his nephew to be the leaders and Chiefetains of the same, who sailing over the narrow seas, landed in the 
West
 parts of 
Britaine;
 of whose arrivall when the 
Saxons
 were certified, they gathered a great army, and gave 
Ivor
 battell, wherein they were put to flight, and lost a great number of their People: and 
Ivor
 wan the Countries of 
Cornewall, Devon-shire,
 and 
Somerset-shire,
 which he peo∣pled with 
Britaines.


Whereupon 
Kentwinus
 King of 
Westsex
 gathered a great number of 
Saxons
 and 
Angles
 together, and came against the 
Britaines,
 which were ready to abide the battell: and when both Armies came in sight one of another, they were not ve∣ry desirous to fight, but fell to a composition and agreement, that 
Ivor
 should take 
Ethelburga
 to wife, which was cousen to 
Kentwyn,
 and quietly enjoy all that he had, during the reigne of 
Ivor.


This 
Ivor
 is he whom the English Chronicles doe call 
Ive
 
or lew
 King of the 
West Saxons,
 that reigned after 
Cedwall,
 and they say that he was a 
Saxon,
 for 
Kentwyn
 reigned but five years after 
Ivors
 coming to 
England,
 and after him, his nephew 
Cedwall,
 who after he had reigned over the 
West




Saxons
 two years went to 
Rome,
 leaving his Kingdome to 
Ive
 his cousen: This 
Ive
 or 
Ivor
 (whom the 
Britains
 call the sonne of 
Alan,
 and the 
Saxons
 the sonne of 
Kenred
) be∣ing King of the 
Saxons
 and 
Britains
 which inhabited the 
West
 parts of 
England,
 after many victories atchieved against the Kings of 
Kent, Southsex,
 and 
Mercia,
 left his Kingdome to 
Adelred,
 or (as some call him) 
Adelerdus,
 his cousen, and took his journey to 
Rome,
 where he made a Godly end, about the yeare of our Lord 720.


{fleur-de-lys} Of 
Cadwalader, Cedwall,
 and 
Ivor,
 there be diverse opini∣nions. Some hold, that 
Cadwalader
 and 
Cedwall
 are the selfe∣same man; and that the 
Saxon
 writers call him 
Cedwall
 whom the 
Britains
 doe name 
Cadwalader:
 who (as the 
Brytish
 Chroni∣cles do affirme) after his foresaid 
vision,
 did resigne all his right, title and interest in Great 
Brytaine,
 to the said 
Alan
 King of 
Brytaine Armorike,
 despairing that either he or his should ever have any thing to do there, so leaving his sonne 
Edwal Ywrch
 and his people to the ordering of his cousen 
Alan
 he went to 
Rome.
 But this opinion seemeth to vary from the assertion of 
Bernardus Guidonius.
 But certainly in my opinion it is more probable that that this 
Cedwall
 was 
Edwal
 the sonne of 
Cadwalader,
 for the name 
Edoal,
 which in the ancient Brytish copy is written 
Etoal,
 may well agree with that which

C.
 capitall to creep in, which is almost all one with that character which the 
Lawyers
 do call a 
paragraph,
 and is used commonly in all old
 Text hands at the beginning of periods or sections. Of this mat∣ter thus writeth 
Guidonius,
 In suo pontificali Catalogo, sub Ser∣gio primo.


Per idem tempus Ethoal Rex Brytonum, cùm per decem
 annos multis regulis obviasset, & plura mala illis irrogas∣set, tandem ipsis in pacem devenientibus, super occidentales Saxones regnavit annis duobus. Videns autem Brytanniam multis miseriis contritam, regnum sprevit terrenum propter aeternum, & Romam veniens, paucis diebus transactis migra∣vit ad Christum. 
Et paulo post.
 Hic ex toto illud regnum antiquissimum Brytonum corruit, quod omnibus ferè regnis diuturnius fuit. A tempore Heli Sacerdotis usque ad hoc


tempus, per annos 1825. Rob. Caenalis lib. 2. per. 2.


That is.


At the same time 
Ethoal
 King of the 
Brytains,
 when he had by the space of ten years warred with diverse Kings, and often put them to the worse, at length coming to an agreement with them, he reigned over the 
West Saxons
 two years: then perceiving 
Bry∣taine
 to be overworne with miseries, and preferring the heavenly Kingdome before the earthly, he came to 
Rome,
 and within few days dyed: and in him ended wholly that ancient Kingdome of the 
Brytains,
 which continued in a manner longer then any other, from 
Heli
 the priest to this time, by the space of 1825▪ yeares.


Further, it is not like that 
Iuor
 coming to the aid of 
Edwal
 his cousen would euer seeke the kingdome to himselfe and defeate the right heire: but very well it may be, if this 
Iuor
 be that man whom the 
Saxon
 writers call 
Inas
 or 
Iue,
 that after these 
Brytaines
 had arriued in the south part of this 
realme,
 and fought diuers times with the 
Saxon
 kings, and continued in 
Cornewall, Deuon∣shire,
 and 
Somersetshire
 by the space of two yeares▪ they should meet 
Centwyn
 in the field and so fall to an agreement, that 
Iuor
 taking 
Ethelburga
 the cousen of 
Centwyn
 to wife should enjoy the kingdome of the 
West Saxons
 after 
Centwyn,
 and that therevpon 
Edwal
 resigning his title and interest to 
Iuor
 departed to 
Rome,
 and so died: as 
Guidonius
 saith.


All this notwithstanding, it seemeth by the report of other writers of very good account, that 
Inas
 or 
Iue
 king of the 
West Saxons
 (whose lawes are extant in print, set out by master 
William Lambard
 Esquier, a worthy searcher and preseruer of the anti∣quities of this land) was not a 
Brytaine,
 but a 
Saxon,
 who had warre again
t the 
Brytaines
 diuers times, and vanquished them.


Matth West.
 reporteth that 
Inas
 or 
Iue
 fought with 
Gerent
 King of the 
Brytaines.


I haue an ancient book written (as 
Iohn Leland
 thinketh) by 
John Castoreus
 or 
Bever,
 sometimes Monke of 
Westminster,
 who lived in the time of 
Edward
 the third, which reporteth the History of 
Inas
 in this sort.


About the yeare of Grace 689. 
Ivor
 and 
Henyr
 sonnes of the Daughter of 
Cadwalader
 sometime King of 
Brytaine,
 came over
 from 
Ireland,
 and taking to their did the two Kings of 
Wales
 de stroyed the Province of 
Chester,
 and sent messengers to the 
Saxon



Kings, commanding them to restore againe to the 
Brytains
 the Country of 
Lhoyger,
 out of which they had wrongfully expelled
 their Parents and Ancestors: adding that if they would not do so within fifteen daies, they should be sure not to enjoy it longer. This message 
Inas
 the Noble King of 
Westsex
 signified to all the other 
Saxon
 Kings, who soon met together in 
Mount Campden,
 to whom 
Sibertus
 King of 
Essex
 spake thus:


Deare friends and companions, let us weigh and consider not on∣ly
 what we are our selves, but also what our enemies are which come against us: they are the very 
Britains,
 whose Fathers and Ance∣stors our Fathers have bereft of their inheritance, and expelled out of their 
own
 land, and now they justly come against us to claime that which our Ancestors by violence have taken from theirs. Let us therefore like other Nations choose unto us a Head; to lead, di∣rect, and governe us, whom, as chief Lord in time of Peace and Warre, we as Members may obey and stick to, sith without a Head there is no victory to be looked for. Have not the 
Brytains
 after two years of their dispersion set upon the ancient 
Saxons
 (a more valiant people than we are) fifteen times within seaven years? Did they not spoile their Kingdomes, kill their people, and leave such as remained alive sore wounded and maimed at their departure?


The rest of the 
Saxon
 Kings agreed to his mind, and with one assent chose that worthy Knight 
Ina
 King of 
Westsex
 to be their Soveraigne, who having taken their Homage, advanced his Stan∣dard, and marching forward against 
Ivor
 and 
Henyr
 set upon them, so that they were faine to forsake their Tents, and flye into 
Wales.


Thus 
Inas
 having obtained the victory with the other 
Saxon
 Kings (saving 
Sibertus
 who by reason of his age and impotency had gone home before) returned to 
Southampton,
 where his Cousen 
Adelard
 informed him that 
Ivor
 and 
Henyr
 had gathered and le∣vied a puissant Army afresh to set upon the 
Saxons:
 whereupon 
Inas
 foreslowed not the matter, but went against them, and layd siege to the Castle of 
Snowdon,
 compelling the 
Brytains
 to flye to their ships, and while he was at 
Bangor
 with the other 
Saxon
 Kings, and the Nobles of 
Wales
 he kept the feast of S. 
David,
 and then dismissed the other Kings home to their Country, untill hee should have occasion for them again: and departed himselfe with 
Adelard
 his cousen to Queen 
Ethelburga
 being then at 
Manchester
 and continued there almost three months.


In the mean while 
Adelard
 minding to travell about all 
Wales
 met three spies, of whom (being by him taken and exami∣ned) he learned that 
Ivor
 and 
Henyr
 were returning againe with a huge strong Army, such as all the 
Saxon
 Kings would not be able to resist. Then went he and shewed 
Inas
 what he had heard: wherefore 
Inas
 forthwith certified the other 
Saxon
 Kings of the same, commanding them without delay to be ready at 
Chester
 with Horse and Armour to go against their ene∣mies, and to defend their Country from violence. They accor∣dingly met at 
Chester,
 and following the Kings Standard gave the 
Brytains
 battell, and put them to flight. Howbeit, the 
Britains
 eftsoones invaded 
England,
 into which they made seaven inrodes in two years, destroying Townes and Villages wheresoever they came, and never returning without rich booties; 
Inas
 after this victory returned home, and raigned over the 
West Saxons 36
 years, and then bequeathed his Kingdome to his cousen 
Adelard.
 Thus much out of 
Castoreus.


This 
Ivor
 made the fratrie of 
Glastenbury,
 called in the 
British
 tongue 
Ynys Avalon.


{fleur-de-lys} 
Joseph
 of 
Arimathea
 being sent by 
Philip
 the Apostle, as
 
Gildas
 reporteth, came into this Iland in the daies of 
Arviragus
 King of 
Brytaine
 about the yeare of 
Christ
 53. and instructed the 
Brytains
 in the doctrine of Salvation, in the Ile of 
Aualon,
 where he built a Church for the Christians: which Church this 
Ivor
 (if it be hee that governed the 
West Saxons
) converted to an 
Abbey,
 which he endowed with large possessions, and was the more famous, because the Bodies of the said 
Joseph
 of 
Ari∣mathea
 and King 
Arthurs
 were there buried.


He gave also great lands to the Church of 
Winchester.
 In the second year of 
Ivors
 Reigne, 
Bryth
 a Subject to 
Egfrid
 King of 
Northumberland,
 did over-run & destroy a great part of the Country of 
Ireland.
 In the fourth year of his reigne there was a great Earthquake in the Ile of 
Man:
 and the year following it rained bloud in 
Brytaine
 and 
Ireland.
 The Milke like wise and the Butter turned to the colour of bloud. The second year after that the Moon appeared all bloudy.


After the departure of 
Ivor
 to 
Rome, Adelard
 or 
Adelred
 took the rule of the 
Saxons.
 And 
Rodericus,
 or 
Rodri 
Mol∣wynoc
 the sonne of 
Edwal 
Ywrch,
 did take the rule of the 
Brytains
 in the 
West
 part of 
England.


¶ One 
Welsh
 History saith, that 
Iva
 was the sonne of one 
Assar
 King of 
Little Brytaine,
 and that he reigned 48 years, but another affirmeth 
Ivor, Alan,
 and 
Idwal
 to have been the sonnes of 
Cadwalader,
 and to have governed 
Wales.


Idwall
 Prince of the 
Britains
 not being able to withstand the continuall assaults of the 
Saxons
 brought over with him into 
Cambria
 a remnant of 
Britains
 who were miserably afflicted both with Warre and Famine, and governed them (under the name of 
Welsh men
) 30 years. Dr 
Morgan
 saith 
Edwal
 lyeth buried at 
Caergybi,
 towit, 
Holyhead.
 Bp 
Nicol. Robinson's MS.


I. Dee
 thinketh that 
Ivor
 was sonne in Law to 
Alan
 by mar∣riage of his daughter 
Agatha,
 but I find by good Records that she was married to 
Edwal Ywrch.


Sr 
Iohn Pryse
 K
t
 thinketh that 
Ynyr
 the cousen of 
Ivor
 is the same that the 
Saxon
 writers call 
Yne
 or 
Ynas,
 who was King of the 
West Saxons,
 and went after to 
Rome,
 as is here set downe, but 
Iohn Harding
 doth write plainly and distinctly of them both, 
Ynyr
 a 
Briton,
 and 
Yna
 a 
Saxon.


About this time was solemnized a Marriage in 
North Wales
 between the sonne and heire of the King of 
Man
 and 
Nest
 the daughter of 
Cadell
 the sonne of 
Brochwel Yscythroc
 ap 
Elise
 ap 
Cynllaw
 ap 
Eli
 of the race of K. 
Gorthyrn.
 Prince 
Mervyn Bhrych
 was the sonne of the said Prince of 
Man
 by the fore∣said 
Nest.


In some copies of the old Text we read thus, 
viz.
 Two years after 688 there was a great slaughter in 
Ireland,
 and the next yeare there was an Earthquake; foure years after that it rained bloud in 
Great Brytaine
 and 
Ireland,
 and the Milke and the Butter turned to 
Bloud.
 Two years after that the Moon looked like 
bloud.
 A. D. 704 
Elfric
 K. of 
England
 dyed, and was buried at 
Damnam.
 The yeare after the night was as light as the day. The yeare after dyed 
Osbric
 K. of the 
Saxons.
 And the yeare after that S. 
Michaels Church
 was conse∣crated. A. D. 720▪ it was a very hot Summer.








Roderike
 Molwynoc. 
Roderike
 or 
Rodri,
 the Sonne of 
Edwal
 Ywrch.


ROderike
 began his Reigne over the 
Brytains An. 720.
 against whom 
Adelred,
 King of 
Westsax
 raised a great Army, and destroying the Country of 
Devon∣shire
 entred 
Cornwall,
 where 
Roderike
 with the 
Brytains
 gave him Battell, wherein the 
Brytains
 were Con∣querours.
 The yeare after the 
Brytains
 obtained two other victories against the 
Saxons,
 one in 
Northwales
 at a place called 
Garth Maelaw
,
 and another in 
Southwales
 at 
Pencoet.
 At this time 
Belin
 the sonne of 
Elphin
 a Noble man amongst the 
Brytains
 dyed. The year following died 
Celredus
 King of 
Mercia
 and 
Ethelbaldus
 was made King after him, who be∣ing
 desirous to annex the fertile soyle of the Country lying between 
Severne
 and 
Wye
 to his Kingdome of 
Mercia,
 ga∣thered an Army, and entred into 
Wales,
 and destroying all before him, he came to the Mountaine 
Carno,
 not farre from 
Abergevenny,
 where a sore battell was fought between him
 and the 
Brytains
 in the year 728.


The yeare 733 died 
Beda
 a Priest, brought up in the Abbey
 of 
Wyrnetham,
 a great 
Clerke
 that wrote many works, a mong which, there is one intituled, 
The Ecclesiasticall Histo∣ry of the English Nation,
 Dedicated unto 
Cleolwolf
 King of 
Northumberland.
 This yeare 
Adelard
 King of 
Westsex,
 and 
Ethelbald
 King of 
Mercia
 joyned their powers against the
 
Brytains,
 and gave them battell, and after a long fight and great slaughter on both sides, obtained a bloudy victory. The yeare 735. 
Adelard
 King of 
Westsex
 died, and 
Cudred
 reigned in his stead. And the yeare following dyed
. Edwyn


King of the 
Picts.
 And in the yeare 746. there was a great
 battell fought at 
Hereford
 betwixt 
Cudred
 and 
Ethelbaldus,
 where after a long 
ight 
Cudred
 had the victory. Also the next yeare ensuing he gave the 
Brytains
 an overthrow and dyed shortly after.


{fleur-de-lys} The 
Brytains
 seeing they could prevaile but little a∣gainst
 the 
Saxons
 joyned in league with 
Cuthred
 King of the 
West Saxons,
 who then was out with 
Ethelbald
 King of 
Mercia,
 whereupon the said 
Ethelbald
 entred into 
Wales
 with a strong ar∣my, and the 
Brytains
 met him, and were there discomfited. After that 
Cuthred
 and 
Ethelbald
 met in the field, where 
Ethelbald
 was put to flight: but anon after they two were made friends, & joy∣ned together their powers against the 
Brytains
 and overcame them.


After 
Cudred
 in the yeare 749. was 
Sigebert
 created 
King,
 who for his evill behaviour was expelled by his Nobles out
 of his Kingdome, and was miserably slaine by a swinebeard,
 after whom 
Kenulph
 was made King of the 
West Saxons
 the year 750. About the same time died 
Theodor
 the sonne of
 
Belin,
 a man of great estimation among the 
Brytains.
 Not long after there was a great battell fought betwixt the 
Bry∣tains
 and the Picts at a place called
 
Magedawc,
 where 
Da∣largan
 King of the 
Picts
 was slaine. Within a little after, 
Roderi
 or 
Roderike Molwynoc
 was driven by the 
Saxons
 to forsake the 
West
 country, and to come to seek his own inheri∣tance in 
Northwales,
 where did rule at that time the Children of 
Bletius
 or 
Bledericus
 Prince of 
Cornewal
 and 
Devonshire
 (who was one of them that gave 
Adelred
 and 
Ethelbert
 the o∣verthrow at 
Bangor
 upon the river 
Dee
 who had enioyed the government of 
Northwales
 ever since 
Cadvan
 was chosen King of 
Brytaine
 untill this time.


{fleur-de-lys} By this History it should seem that the 
Brytains
 continued their Government in the 
West part
 of 
Loegria
 untill this time. But certainly the consent (in a manner) of all writers is, that the Bry∣tish Kingdome ended in 
Cadwalader,
 after whom the 
Brytains
 had nothing to doe beyond 
Severne,
 being con
rained to keep themselves within the Countries of 
Cambria
 and 
Cornubia.
 It is also written by diverse, that 
Ivor
 and 
Ynyr
 at their first arriving in 
Brytaine,
 were repelled by the 
Saxons,
 and driven to 
Wales,
 where 
Ivor
 ruled as 
Prince
 many years, whom this 
Roderi
 or 
Ro∣derike
 the sonne of 
Edwal
 the sonne of 
Cadwalader
 succeeded.


When 
Roderike
 King of the 
Brytains
 had reigned about 30 years he dyed the yeare 750. leaving two sonnes after him, 
Conan 
Tindaethwy,
 and 
Howel.


¶ 
Tho. Maelor
 saith 
Rodri Molwynoc
 founded and endowed the 
Monastery
 of 
Ynys Enlli
 (in English 
Bardsey
) adjoyning to 
Llyn
 in 
Carnarvonshire.
 Reedify and augment it he might, but it seems to be of an ancienter foundation, for we find in our Records mention of a 
Monastery
 and an 
Abbot
 there before his time. 
S. Dubricius
 Arch-Bishop of 
Caerleon
 resigning his 
ishoprick to 
S. David
 went to 
Bardsey
 from the Synod of 
Brevi,
 which was held against the 
Pelagians
 about the yeare of Grace 522, with most of the Clergy of that 
Synod
 along with him, there to spend the remainder of their dayes in a 
Monastery,
 where be∣ing remote from the World they might the more entirely and unanimously devote themselves to the service of God. One 
La
datus
 was then 
Abbot
 of 
Bardsey,
 who is taken notice of, that being summoned to that 
Synod
 he did not appeare. 
A∣neyrin gwawdydd mychdeyr

Aneirin
 the

 King of

British
 Historian who dyed about the yeare 512,) writes thus of the retirement of St

 and his followers to 
Bardsey,

Conan
 Tindaethwy. 
Conan
 Tindaethwy 
The Sonne of 
Rodri
 Molwynoc.


COnan 
Tindaethwy
 began his Reigne over the 
Bry∣tains
 the year of our Lord 755. About two years after, there was a great Battell fought at 
Here∣ford
 betwixt the 
Brytains
 and the 
Saxons,
 where 
Dyfnwal
 the sonne of 
Theodor
 was slaine. And this year died 
Athelbert
 King of 
Northumberland,
 and 
Oswald
 reigned in his stead. About this time, there was an order taken for the right keeping of the feast of Easter in 
Wales
 by 
Elbodi∣us
 a man both Godly and Learned: for the Brytains eber be∣fore
 that time differed from the Church of 
Rome,
 in celebra∣ting the 
Feast
 of 
Easter,
 and the difference was this. The 
Church
 of 
Rome
 by order of a 
Generall Councell
 holden at 
Nice
 had appointed, that ever the next Sunday after the 14 day of the moon should be 
Easter
 day, so that 
Easter
 should be ever either the 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or 21 day of the moon, and neber the 14 day it selfe, nor never passe the 21. And the 
Brytains
 did use to keep their 
Easter
 upon the 14 day, and so to the 20 as it fell, so that sometimes when it was 
Easter
 day with the 
Brytains,
 it was but 
Palme-sunday
 with the 
Sax∣ons:
 from this diversity grew a great contention about the yeare 660. betwixt 
Colman
 and 
Hylda
 upon the one part
 defending the 
Rite
 of the 
Brytains;
 and 
Gilbert
 and 
Wilfrid
 on the other part, who could scarce afford to call the 
Bry∣tains
 and 
Scots
 Christians, because they kept not 
Easter
 within the dayes appointed.


{fleur-de-lys} I read that this 
Hylda
 (which was the neece of 
Edwin
 King
 of 
Northumberland,
 & brought up by 
Paulin
 and 
Aedan
) did in a publike Synod withstand 
Wilfrid
 and other Monks about the keeping of Easter alleadging for herselfe (out of 
Polycrates
) the fact of 
Irenaeus,
 who withstood 
Victor
 Bishop of 
Rome
 in that behalfe, and the custome of the Church of 
Asia
 observed by 
S. John
 the E∣vangelist, 
Philip
 the Apostle, 
Polycarpus
 and 
Melito,
 and taught in this Iland of 
Brytaine
 by 
Joseph
 of 
Arimathea,
 who first Prea∣ched the Gospell in the same.


In the yeare 763. was 
Offa
 made King of 
Mercia,
 and
 
Brichtrich
 King of the 
West Saxons.
 In which yeare dyed 
 
Fermael
 the sonne of 
Edwal:
 and the year following, 
 
Ce∣moyd
 the King of the 
Picts.
 The yeare 776. the men of 
Southwales
 destroyed a great part of 
Mercia
 with fire and sword. And the summer following all the 
Welshmen
 gathe∣red themselves together, and entring the Kingdome of 
Mercia
 did there much hurt.


{fleur-de-lys} The 
Saxons
 bordering upon the Country of 
Cambria
 or
 
Wales,
 did daily incroach so upon the lands of the 
Welshmen
 be∣yond 
Seaverne,
 that they had gotten much of the same into their hands, especially toward the 
south part
 of the Country. Where∣fore the 
Welshmen
 put themselves in armour, and set upon the 
Sax∣ons,
 and chased them over 
Seaverne
 againe, and then returned home with a great prey, and thus they did oftentimes, killing and destroying all before them, and alwaies bringing home with them much Cattell, which thing caused 
Offa
 to conclude a peace with the other 
Saxon
 Kings, and to bend his whole force against the 
Welshmen.


Whereupon 
Offa
 King of 
Mercia
 caused a great 
ditch
 to be
 made, large and deep from sea to sea, betwixt his 
Kingdome
 and 
Wales,
 whereby he might the better defend his 
Country
 from the incursions of the 
Welsh.
 And this Ditch is to be seen in many places as yet, and is called 
Clawdh Offa,
 that
 is, 
Offas
 ditch, at this day.


{fleur-de-lys} King 
Offa
 calling to his aid the other 
Saxon
 Kings gathe∣red


a huge army, and came over 
Seaverne
 into 
Wales:
 upon whose coming the 
Welshmen
 (being not able to encounter with such a multitude of armed souldiers) left the plaine and even Country by 
Seaverne
 side, and the land between it and the river 
Wy,
 and withdrew themselves to the Mountains and Rocks, where they might be most in safety▪ untill the enemies were gone out of the country; neverthelesse they made continually diverse invasions by stealth into the land of 
Mercia,
 and alwaies returned with ad∣vantage; the 
Saxons
 keeping themselves encamped could doe no goed against them, for they durst not pursue them to the Mountains and Woods, for feare of being entrapped by such as kept the passages and streights.


Offa
 perceiving this expelled them all quite out of the 
Coun∣try
 between 
Seaverne
 and 
Wy,
 and planted 
Saxons
 in their pla∣ces. And annexing it to his own Kingdome of 
Mercia
 caused this famous ditch to be made for the security of his people from the invasions of the 
Welsh.
 Hereupon the seat of the Kings of 
Powys
 was translated from 
Pengwern
 (now called 
Salop
) to 
Mathraval,
 where it continued long after.


In the yeare 795. the 
Danes
 came first into 
England;
 sixe
 years after they came againe, and destroyed a great part of
 
Lindsey
 and 
Northumberland;
 they over▪ ran also the grea∣test part of 
Ireland,
 and destroyed 
Rechreyn.


Also about the same time there was a battell fought at 
Ruthlan,
 between the 
Saxons
 and the 
Welshmen,
 where 
Cara∣doc
 King of 
Northwales
 was slaine. This 
Caradoc
 was the sonne of 
Gwyn,
 the sonne of 
Colhoyn,
 the son of 
Ednowen,
 the sonne of 
Blethyn,
 the sonne of 
Blecius
 or 
Bledricus
 Prince of 
Cornewall
 and 
Devonshire.
 Also this yeare dyed 
Offa
 King of 
Mercia,
 and 
Egfert
 his sonne reigned in his stead.


In the yeare of our Lord 800. 
Egbertus
 was made King of 
Westsex:
 and 
Kenulphus
 the yeare following created King of 
Mercia. Arthen
 also the sonne of 
Sitsylht
 the sonne of 
Clydawc
 King of 
Caerdigan
 dyed the same yeare. Likewise 
Run
 King of 
Dyuet,
 and 
Cadelh
 King of 
Powys
 died in the
 yeare 808.


{fleur-de-lys} This was a troublesome time, and no setled Governement as yet



established in 
Wales,
 and therefore such as were 
chiefe Lords
 in any 
Country
 are here called 
Kings.


The next yeare after died 
Elbodius
 Archbishop of 
North∣wales,
 before whose death the Sunne was sore eclipsed. In the yeare 810 was the Moon eclipsed upon Christmas day.
 The same yeare 
S. Davids
 was burnt by the 
West Saxons.
 There was also a generall murrein and death of cattell throughout all 
Wales.
 The next yeare ensuing 
Owen
 the sonne of Meredyth, the sonne of 
Terudos
 dyed▪ and the Ca∣stle of 
Deganwy
 was destroyed with Thunder. 
Conan
 Prince of 
Wales,
 and his brother 
Howel
 could not agree, insomuch that they tried the matter by Battell, wherein 
Howel
 had the victory.


{fleur-de-lys} This 
Howel
 the brother of 
Conan,
 King or Prince of 
North∣wales,
 did claime the Ile of 
Môn
 or 
Anglesey
 for part of his Fa∣thers inheritance, which 
Conan
 refusing to give him, they fell at variance, and made Warre the one against the other.


This Mischiefe grew from a Custome in 
Wales,
 viz. the divisi∣on of the Fathers inheritance amongst all the Sonnes commonly called 
Gauel-kind.
 In which division the elder sonne had the better share, but the younger had alwaies the ancient seate and man∣sion house. And this custome did not only in time weaken their Families, but was also a cause of continuall strife and feud amongst them.


And the next yeare there was much hurt done by 
Thunder,
 and in diverse places many houses burnt to the Earth. The same yeare dyed▪ 
Gruffyth
 the sonne of 
Run,
 and 
Griff
i
 the sonne of 
Kyng
 was slaine by the treason of 
Elice
 his Bro∣ther.


Howel
 fought with his brother 
Conan
 another Battell, & slew a great number of his people, whereupon 
Conan
 leavied an Army in the yeare 817 and chased his brother 
Howell
 out of the Ile of 
Môn
 or 
Anglesey,
 compelling him to fly into 
Man.
 And a little after dyed 
Conan,
 chiefe 
King
 of the 
Brytains
 or 
Welshmen,
 leaving behind him a daughter called 
Esylht,
 which was married to a Noble man, called 
Mervyn Vrych,
 the sonne


of 
Gwyriad,
 or 
Uriet,
 the sonne of 
Elidur,
 and so forth in the right line to 
Belinus
 the brother of 
Brennus
 King of the 
Bry∣tains,
 and his Mother was 
Nest
 the daughter of 
Cadelh
 King of 
Powys,
 the sonne of 
Brochwel Yscythroc,
 (that fought with the 
Saxons
 at 
Bangor
 who was Prince of 
Powis.


{fleur-de-lys} This 
Brochwel
 is called by the Latine writers, 
Brecivallus
 and 
Brochmaelus,
 of whom I find this written in 
Historia Divae Monacellae.


Fuit olim in 
Powysia
 quidam Princeps illustrissimus nomine 
Brochwel Yscithroc,
 Consul Legecestriae, qui in urbe tunc tem∣poris, 
Pengwern Powys
 (nunc vero▪ 
Salopia
 dicta est) habitabat: cujus domicilium seu habitaculum ibi steterat, ubi Collegium divi 
Ceddae
 nunc situm est.


That is.


There was sometimes in 
Powys
 a noble Prince, named 
Broch∣wel Yscithroc,
 Consul or Earle of 
Chester,
 who dwelt in a towne then called 
Pengwern Powys,
 and now 
Salop,
 whose dwelling house was in the very same place where the Col∣ledge of Saint 
Chad
 now standeth. This man with 
Cad∣van
 King of 
Brytain, Morgan
 King of 
Demetia,
 and 
Blede∣ricus
 King of 
Cornewal,
 gave an overthrow to 
Ethelfred
 King of 
Northumberland,
 near the river of 
Dee, Anno gra∣tiae
 617. The Ancestors of divers in 
Wales
 at this day, are known (by ancient books and records) to have descen∣ded Paternally from him.

Brochwel Yscythroc
 was a great friend and favourer of the 
Monkes
 of 
Bangor,
 whose part he took ▪against the 
Saxons
 that were set on by 
Augustin
 the 
Monke
 to persecute them with fire and sword, because they would not forsake the customes of their own Church, and conforme to those of 
Rome;
 some say he fought against 
Ethelred
 A. D. 607, in which yeare there were slaine about 1200 of the said 
Monkes
 by the instigation of that blondy Apostle 
Austin; Tantum Religio potuit suadere malo∣rum?
 Thus the 
Roman
 Religion (not the 
Christian
) was first planted with bloud in this 
Island. Augustin
 did set out from 
Rome
 about 588, arrived in 
Brytain
 596, A. D. 603 he held a 
Synod
 in the borders of 
Wales
 at 
Augustines Oake
 or 
Worcester,
 to which there came the seaven 
Bishops
 that were under the ju∣risdiction of the 
Arch-Bishop
 of 
Menevia.

 he having first obliged them by his wri∣ting in defence of the Church of 
Rome
 against the 
Brytains
 and 
Scots,
 who would not receive Law from her to the prejudice of their own Church, which they reckoned no lesse ancient and absolute then the 
Roman.

Bangor Monachorum
 (so called from the famous 
Monastery
 that was in it) lyes situate in 
Maelor
 or 
Bromfield
 not farre from 
Caerlleon
 or 
Westchester.
 Both 
Towne
 and 
Monastery
 have so felt the injuries of time, that at this day there are hardly any r
ins of them remaining; there is now only to be seen a small Village of the name, but no footsteps of the old City, save the rubbish of the two principall gates, 
Porth Cleis
 and 
Porth Wogan,
 the former looking towards 
England,
 the later towards 
Wales;
 they are about a mile distant the one from the other, so that it is easy to conjecture how large the City might be; It lay be∣tween those two Gates, the river 
Dee
 running through the middle of it; The old 
British Triades
 tell us that in the time of the 
British
 Kings there were in the 
Monastery
 of 
Bangor
 2400 
Monkes,
 who in their turnes (that is, a hundred every houre of the 24) continually (Night and Day) read prayers and sung Psalmes, so that the service of God went on there still without intermission.


Off a

Meredith
 King of 
Dyvet
 dyed in the battell fought at 
Ruthlan
 794. 796 the 
Saxons
 killed 
Cara∣dawc
 King of 
Northwales.
 This 
Caradawc
 could not be the sonne of 
Gwyn
 ap 
Collwyn,
 for 
Gwyn
 ap 
Collwyn
 lived 200 years and above after this time, nor yet 
Caradawg
 ap 
Alawg
 King of 
Pennarddal
wg
 (now 
Hawarden
) who in the time of King 
Cadvan
 (200 years before) was slaine by 
Owen Penyverw
 the sonne of 
Tyvid
 in revenge of the wrong he had done to his sister S
t
 
Wenifryd;
 But he may very well be 
Caradoc
 Earle of 
Here∣ford
 the only one of that name that I read of living in those times; this 
Caradoc
 descended from 
Coeliog Myngrudd
 of the



North
 of 
Brytain
 was fain to leave his Country, 
Ethelbald
 King of 
Mercia
 having despoyled him of his estate in the yeare of our Lord 760. Probably 
Roderic
 or his sonne 
Conan
 gave him Lands in 
Northwales
 for his support, which might be an occa∣sion why he should be called King of 
Gwyneth.
 He might well be that 
Caradoc,
 that 28 years after the battell of 
Hereford
 was slaine by the 
Mercians,
 being much enraged for the death of their King 
Offa.
 This 
Caradawc's
 sonne 
Lluddocca
 ap 
Caradawc
 had one daughter called 
Rhieingar
 mother to 
Tuder Trevor
 of 
Bromfield,
 who was in her right Earle of 
Hereford,
 and is reckoned to be the Tribe of the 
Marches.


In one copy of the old Text we read thus▪ A. D. 760 there was a battell fought betweene the 
Brytains
 and 
Saxons
 called 
Gweith Henfordd. Dyfnwal
 the sonne of 
Tewdwr
 dyed the same yeare. 768 the 
Brytains
 were fain to change the time of their ancient observation of 
Easter,
 and 
Elbodius
 a servant of God was the Author of the change.

Mervyn 
Bhrych
 and Esyllt the Daughter of 
Conan
 Tindaethwy.


THE first yeare of the Reigne of 
Mervyn 
Bhrych
 and
 
Esylht
 his Wife, 
Egbert
 King of 
Westsex
 entred 
Wales
 with a great Army, and destroying the whole Country unto 
Snowdon
 hills, seised into his hands the Country of 
Rhyvonioc
 in 
Denbighland.
 About this time, there was a sore battell fought in 
Anglesey,
 called the Battell of 
Lhanvaes.


In the year of Christ 819 
Kenulph
 King of 
Mercia
 de∣stroyed
 
West Wales,
 and the summer following, he oberran 
Powys
 land, doing much hurt, and soon after dyed, and 
Ke∣nelme
 Reigned in his stead. About the same time also 
Howel
 King of 
Man
 dyed. The yeare 825 
Ceolwulph
 was made King of 
Mercia,
 and Reigned two years. After whom 
Ber∣nulph
 was created King, who was overthrown at 
Elledowne
 by 
Egbert
 King of the 
West Saxons,
 who also brought to his subjection the Countries of 
Kent
 and 
West Angles.
 Not long after, about the yeare 828 
Bernulph
 was slaine by the 
East
 
Angles.
 After that there was a great Battell fought 
at a place called 
Gauelford,
 betwixt the 
Brytains
 and the 
West Saxons
 of 
Devonshire,
 and many thousands slaine on either side, and the victory
•
 uncertain. The yeare 829 
Egbert
 over∣threw
 
Wyhtla
e
 King of 
Mercia,
 and made him subject to his Kingdome. He also passed 
Humber,
 and conquered the Land
 beyond, so that he was the first Monarch of the 
Saxons,
 ha∣ving brought the 
Seaven Kingdomes
 into 
one,
 and changed the name of 
Brytain
 linto 
England,
 calling the people 
English∣men,
 and the language 
English:
 for the people that came into this Ile from 
Germany,
 were 
Saxons, Angles,
 and 
Juthes.
 And of the 
Saxons
 came the people of 
Eastsex, Southsex, Middlesex,
 and 
West Saxons.
 Of the Angles came the 
East Angles,
 middle 
Angles
 or 
Mercians,
 and all on the North side of 
Humber.
 And of the 
Juthes
 came the inhabitants of 
Kent,
 and the Ile of 
Wight▪
 And the seaven Kingdomes were these:






1 The first 
Kent.


2 The second 
Southsex,
 containing Sussex and 
Surrey.


3 The third 
East Angles,
 containing 
Northfolke, South∣folke,
 and 
Cambridgeshire.


4 The fourth 
Westsex,
 containing 
Barkeshire, Devonshire,
 and 
Somersetshire.


5 The fift 
Mercia,
 containing 
Glocestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Cheshire, Warwike∣shire, Darbyshire, Notinghamshire, Lincolneshire, Northamp∣tonshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire,
 and halfe 
Hartfordshire.


6 The sixt was 
East Saxon,
 containing 
Essex, Middlesex,
 and the other halfe of 
Hartfordshire.


7 The seaventh Kingdome was all the Lands upon the 
North
 side of 
Humber,
 and it was divided into two King∣domes, 
Deyra
 and 
Bernicia. Deyra
 was the land betwixt 
Hum∣ber
 and 
Tine, Bernicia
 from 
Tine
 to the 
Scottish
 sea.




All these were brought under subjection by 
Egbert
 King of the 
West Saxons:
 and this Realm was called 
England
 the year after the coming of 
Brutus
 to this Ile 1968 after the coming of 
Hengist
 383, and after the departure of 
Cadwala∣der
 149 years. Which name although it hath continued to this day, for the space of 755 years, yet was it not very lucky to the 
Saxons:
 For even upon this change of name, and u∣nion of the 
Kingdomes,
 followed the cruell invasion of the 
Danes;
 and after that, the conquest of the 
Normans,
 of whom the 
Kings
 of this time are descended. But to returne again to my matter. The year 833 the 
Danes
 in great companies
 landed in divers places of this Realm, and fought diverse Battles with 
Egbert,
 wherein sometime they and sometimes he had the better. Afterward in the yeare 836 they landed in 
West Wales,
 and passing through 
Wales
 to 
England
 (with the accession of many 
Welshmen
 which joyned with them a∣gainst 
Egbert
 fought him, but he overthrew them all at 
Hen∣gestdowne,
 and dyed the year following.


{fleur-de-lys} This 
Egbert
 King of 
England
 wan the City of 
Caerlhêon ar
 
Dhowrdwy
 or 
Chester
 (the chiefe City of 
Venedotia,
) out of the hands of the 
Brytains,
 in whose possession it had remained untill that time. He caused also (as some writers doe affirme) the


brazen image of 
Cadwalhon
 King of 
Brytaine,
 to be thrown down
 and defaced, commanding that no man upon paine of Death, should set up any such againe, and that this Land should be called no more, 
Brytain
 but 
England,
 and the people 
Englishmen.
 He also made proclamation (by the instigation of 
Redburga
 his wife, who bare an implacable malice towards the 
Brytains
) that no 
Brytain
 should remaine within the confines of 
England,
 commanding that all and singular which were of the 
Brytish
 bloud should within six moneths with their Wives and Children remove out of his King∣dome, upon paine of losing their Heads.


After the death of 
Egbert,
 his sonne 
Ethelwulph
 reigned, who gave his daughter in marriage to 
Berthred
 King of 
Mer∣cia
 and tributary to him. He had great warres, and much a∣doe with the 
Danes,
 who with fire & sword destroyed the coasts of 
England.
 The yeare 841 dyed 
Idwalhon
 a Noble man of
 
Wales.
 And two years after was the battell of 
Kettell
 betwixt 
Burchred
 King of 
Mercia
 and the 
Brytains,
 wherein (as some write) 
Mervyn Bhrych
 King of the 
Brytains
 was slain, leaving behind him a son called 
Rodri Mawr,
 that is to say 
Roderike
 the 
Great.


¶ 
Mervyn Bhrych
 King of 
Man
 was the sonne of 
Gwyryat
 and 
Nest
 the daughter of 
Cadell
 ap 
Brochwel
 ap 
Elise
 King of 
Powis.
 The said 
Gwyryad
 was the sonne of 
Elidir,
 whose mo∣ther was 
Celeinion
 daughter of 
Anarawd Gallgrwm
 ap 
Mervyn Mawr
 ap 
Cynvyn, &c.
 in a direct line to 
Maximus

Emperour. Elidirs

 ap

 ap

 a Noble man of King 
Arthurs
 Court li∣neally descended from 
Coel Godebog.


Howel
 the Brother of 
Conan Tindaethwy
 in his distresse fled to 
Mervyn Bhrych,
 by whom he was kindly entertained. To gratify his Noble Landlord, 
Howell
 used such meanes afterwards that 
Mervyn
 married 
Esyllt
 the daughter and heire of his bro∣ther 
Conan. Howel,
 after he had about five years enjoyed the Isle of 
Man
 with other Islands and Lands in the 
North
 given him by 
Mervyn
 to hold under him, dyed A. D. 825. After his death the premises reverted to 
Mervyn,
 who with his Ancestors had always held the same under the Kings of the 
Brytains.


A. D. 831 dyed 
Saturbin
 Bishop of 
Menevia. Burchred
 was not King of 
Mercia
 before the yeare 852, ten years after 
Mervyn



death, therefore it may be said with more probability that 
Mervyn
 was slaine in a battell fought between 
Ethelwolph
 and the 
Brytains.

 or of his sons. His progeny it seems hath not much increased, there are not many (at this day) known to be descended from him, though some there are.

Roderike
 the 
Great,
 Sonne of 
Mervyn Bhrych
 and 
Esylht.


ROderike
 the 
Great
 began his Reigne over 
Wales,
 the year after 
Christ
 his incarnation 843. This Prince divided all 
Wales
 into three territories, 
viz.
 of 
Aberffraw, Dinevowr,
 and 
Mathraval.
 He had Warre with 
Burchred
 King of 
Mercia,
 who with the aid of 
Ethelwulph
 entring 
North-Wales
 with a great power destroyed 
Anglesey,
 fought diverse times with the 
Welshmen,
 and slue
 
Meyric
 a great Prince among them. About the yeare 846 
Meyric
 Bishop of 
Menevia
 was slaine by the 
Sax∣ons▪


The yeare 846 the 
Danes
 over-ranne a great part of 
Eng∣land,
 and having fought with 
Athelstan
 King of 
Kent,
 bro∣ther to 
Ethelwulph,
 had their Winter quarters in 
England.
 This year also was 
Ithel
 King of 
Gwent
 or 
Wentland
 slaine in fight by the men of 
Brecknock.
 This yeare 854 
Kongen
 King of 
Powys
 died at 
Rome,
 being slaine by 
Pagans,
 as some
 say, or (as others) choaked by his own men. And two years after dyed 
Cemoyth
 King of the 
Picts,
 and 
Jonathan
 Lord of 
Abergeley.
 About 854 the black Nation, to wit, the 
Danes
 and 
Normans
 wasted 
Anglesey.
 About the yeare 856 
Ethel∣wulph
 took his journey to 
Rome,
 he made his Kingdome tributary to the 
Pope,
 and payd the 
Peter-pence
 to the 
Church
 of 
Rome.


The old 
Saxons
 doe bring the Genealogy of this 
Ethel∣wulph
 to 
Adam,
 after this manner, 
viz.
 Ethelwulph
 the sonne of 
Egbert,
 the sonne of 
Alcmund,
 the sonne of 
Eaffa,
 the sonne of 
Eoppa,
 the sonne of 
Ingils
 the brother of 
Inas,
 the


sonne of 
Kenred,
 the sonne of 
Coelwald,
 the sonne of 
Cud∣win,
 the sonne of 
Ceawlin,
 the sonne of 
Kenrick,
 the sonne of 
Cerdick,
 who was the first King of the 
West Saxons,
 the sonne of 
Esly,
 the sonne of 
Gewise,
 of whom the people were called 
Gwysses,
 the daughter of 
Gewyn,
 the sonne of 
Wingy,
 the sonne of 
Freawyn,
 the sonne of 
Fridagare,
 the sonne of 
Brendy,
 the sonne of 
Beldegy,
 the sonne of 
Woden,
 from whose issue came 
Kings
 of many 
Nations,
 the sonne of 
Frethewold,
 the sonne of 
Freolaff,
 the sonne of 
Frethewolf,
 the sonne of 
Finny,
 the sonne of 
Godulph,
 the sonne of
 
Geta,
 the sonne of 
Teathwy,
 the sonne of 
Beane,
 the sonne of 
S
ldy,
 the sonne of 
Seafe,
 who Reigned in a Country called 
Anglia,
 lying be∣twixt the 
Goths
 and the 
Saxons,
 from whence the 
Angles
 came first to 
Brytain,
 he was the sonne of 
Heremod,
 the sonne of 
Itermod,
 the sonne of 
Hadey,
 the sonne of 
Wale,
 the sonne of 
Bedwy,
 the sonne of 
Sem,
 the sonne of 
Noe,
 and so forth to 
Adam.


{fleur-de-lys} There is another Pedegree layd down by the same Author, of
 
Offa
 King of 
Mercia,
 ascending up even to 
Adam,
 not in all points agreeing with this; the Author writing the latter, seemeth often∣times to forget what he had written in the former. The like also I find in 
Iohn Castoreus,
 at the end of the history of 
Edward
 the
 
Confessor.
 And another in 
Matth. Paris:
 in the History of King 
Henry
 2. A. D. 1155. And these foure Genealogies seem to as∣cend by the same men, although the names doe sometimes vary.


This Genealogy have I set downe here, that the Reader may understand thereby, how that not only the 
Brytains,
 but all other Nations have been ever desirous to set forth their antiquity and progeny, which was no hard thing to do for such as had not been inter-mingled with other Nations, and that had ever among them such as from time to time did professe that 
Art,
 and commit to writing the Progeny, the names of the Wives and Children of all that were of any estimation in the Country. In these two things, 
Wales
 ever surpassed all other Countries, having not mingled with any other Nati∣ons, untill of late years with the 
English,
 and also having those that professed the art of Genealogy; who although they have sometimes erred, or rather willingly to humour the vain∣glorious
 coined false Genealogies, yet surely are able by


their books to bring any Gentlemans Genealogy to Ance∣stors that lived nine hundred years ago, and but few farther, except those descended from the kings of 
Brytaine.


The 
Italians,
 before they mingled with the 
Vandals, Goths,
 and 
Lombards,
 could bring their Genealogies to 
Aeneas.
 The 
Spaniards
 to 
Hesperus,
 before the 
Goths
 and 
Moores
 overran their land. The 
Saxons
 to 
Woden,
 before they mingled with the 
Danes
 and 
Normans.
 Yea the 
Frenchmen
 and 
Turks
 re∣joyce at this day, to bring themselves to the 
Thracians,
 and so the Germans to the children of 
Gwyston:
 and it is possi∣ble they may do it, because they have not bin mingled nor overrun with any other Nation. There are few Nations in the least civilized, but are taken with this innocent study as well as the 
Brytains.
 The 
Grecians
 honoured the memory of 
Berosus
 with a Copper Statue, which they set up for him
 in 
Athens,
 for his pains in transmitting to posterity the 
Be∣ginnings
 and 
Pedegrees
 of 
Nations.
 Men are not to be blamed for delighting in this kind of History, but rather for not making a right use of it, by imitating the vertues, and shun∣ning the Uices of their Ancestors.


This year the 
Danes
 chased 
Burchred
 out of his kingdome, who went to 
Rome,
 and there died. The year 857. died 
Ethel∣wulph,
 and left behind him his sons 
Athelbald
 king of 
West∣sex,
 and 
Athelbright
 king of 
Kent,
 and of the 
East Saxons.


{fleur-de-lys} Of this 
Ethelwulph
 it is written, that he was so well learn∣ed and so devout, that the 
Clerks
 of the 
Church
 of 
Winchester
 did choose him in his youth to be their 
Bishop,
 which function he took upon him, and was 
Bishop
 of 
Winchester
 for seven years before he was King. It is reported also that he conquered the kingdom of 
Demetia
 or 
Southwales,
 and gave the same with the kingdom of 
Southsex
 to 
Alfred
 his son; and that the said 
Alfred
 should bring a thousand souldiers out of 
Wales,
 to his brother 
Ethelbert's
 aid to 
Winchester,
 and put the 
Danes
 there to flight, having destroyed a great number of them. 
Athelbald
 the son of 
Ethelwulph
 after the death of his father kept his Mother-in-law for his Concubine, and afterward married her in the City of 
Chester.


After 
Athelbald
 had Reigned eight years he dyed, and 
A∣thelbright
 his Brother took the rule of his Kingdome. And that year the 
Danes
 spoiled 
Winchester,
 and after a great fight were driven out of the Land: but returning to 
Thanet
 and remaining there that winter, spoiled by incursions all the sea shore. This year also was the battel of 
Gweythen
 be∣twixt the 
Brytains
 and the 
English,
 wherein was a great num∣ber slain on either side. The year 895. died 
Conan Nant Niuer,
 a worthy Captain and noble Warrior. And the year
 following came 
Hungar
 and 
Hubba
 with a great army of 
Danes
 into 
England.
 In the year 867. died 
Athelbright,
 and 
Ethel∣red
 his brother reigned in his stead. The 
Danes
 the year next
 ensuing spoiled 
York,
 and slew the two kings of 
Northumber∣land,
 
Osbright
 and 
Elba,
 and afterward overran all the Coun∣try to 
Notingham,
 spoiling and destroying all before them, and then returned to 
York,
 from thence to 
East Angle,
 where they slue 
Edmond
 the King. The sixt year of 
Ethelred
 came ano∣ther 
Host
 of 
Danes
 through 
Westsex,
 and to 
Reding,
 with 
Bas∣reck
 and 
Alding,
 and fought five battels with 
Ethelred
 and 
Alfred
 his brother, in two whereof the 
Danes
 were overcome at 
Henglefield
 and 
Estondowne,
 and in the thrée other the 
Eng∣lish
 were overcome, at 
Reding, Basing
 and 
Mereton.
 The year 871. King 
Ethelred
 died, and 
Alfred
 his brother reigned in his stead.


{fleur-de-lys} 
Alfred
 having taken upon him the kingdome and considering with himsef, what a heavy burthen it was, sought out the wisest men and the best learned he could hear of, to be directed by them; These he worthily entertained, using their advise as well in the pub∣lick Government of the Commonwealth, as in his private Studies and Affairs. He sent for two famous men for learning out of 
Wales,
 the one named 
John De Erigena,
 surnamed also 
Scotus,
 born at 
Meneuia
 or S. 
Davids,
 and brought up in the Colledge there, who
 having for knowledge sake travelled to 
Athens,
 bestowed there many years in the study of the Greek, Hebrew, and Chaldee tongues and the secret Mysteries of Philosophy, and coming from thence to 
France,
 where being esteemed well by 
Carolus Caluus,
 and 
Ludo∣vicus Balbus,
 he translated the works of 
Dionysius Ar
opagita,



De caelesti hierarchia, out of Greeke into the Latine tongue; and at the last being returned home to 
Wales,
 was sent for by this King 
Alfred,
 who began then the founding of the University of 
Oxford,
 and was the first that professed learning, and read publikely in the said University. The other was 
Asserius
 or 
Asser,
 of whom I shall
 have occasion to speak hereafter. He would not suffer any to 
ear Office in his Court, but such as were Learned, exhorting all men generally to embrace and honour Learning and Learned men.


Alfred
 in the first year of his Reigne fought two Battels with the 
Danes
 upon the south side of 
Thames,
 and slue of them one King, and nine Earles. About this yeare died 
Gwgan
 King of 
Caerdigan.


{fleur-de-lys} This was that Noble 
Gwgan
 ap 
Mevric
 ap 
Dunwal
 ap 
Ar∣then
 ap 
Sitsylht,
 King or Prince of 
Caerdigan,
 who, as some Bry∣tish Books have it, was by misfortune drowned at this time.


At this time the 
Danes
 destroyed the Towne of 
 
Alclyd,
 wan also 
London
 and 
Reding,
 and all the inland Country and Kingdome of 
Mercia.
 And one King or Leader of them took the Country of 
Northumberland,
 who with his people did much annoy the 
Picts.
 Likewise the year following three Kings of the 
Danes
 went from 
Cambridge
 to 
Warham
 in 
Dorsetshire,
 and 
Alfred
 would have given them battell, but the 
Danes
 desiring peace forsware 
England,
 which they had never done before, and the same night their horsemen took their journey toward 
Excester,
 and their footmen which went to Sea were all drowned at 
Sandwich.
 When the 
Danes
 had thus abjured 
England,
 they bent their force against 
Wales
 en∣tred the Ile of 
Môn
 with a great army in the year of Christ 873. where 
Roderike
 gave them twice battell, once at a place
 called 
Bangole,
 and the other time at a place called 
Mene∣gid.


{fleur-de-lys} I find also that about this time 
Halden
 and 
Hungar
 two Cap∣tains of the 
Danes
 arrived in 
Southwales,
 and overran the whole
 country, destroying all before them with fire and sword, neither sparing Churches nor religious houses; but within a while after they received their deserved reward at the hands of the 
West Sax∣ons,
 who meeting with them on the coast of 
Devonshire,
 slew both 
Halden
 and 
Hungar,
 with 1200 of their men.


At this time 
Eneon
 Bishop of 
Menevia
 or 
S. Davids
 died,


and 
Hubert
 was installed in his place. And within two years after 
Dungarth
 King of 
Cornwall
 was drowned by a mischance. In the year 876 the 
Englishmen
 entred 
Angle∣sey,
 fought with the 
Welsh
 a sore bloudy battell, and in the year following slue 
Roderike
 King or Prince of 
Wales,
 and 
Gwyriad
 his Brother, or (as some say) his sonne. This 
Roderike
 had by his Wife 
Enghârad
 the daughter of 
Meyric
 the sonne of 
Dyfnwal
 or 
Dunwal
 the sonne of 
Arthen
 ap 
Sit∣sylht
 severall sonnes, as 
Anarawd
 his eldest, to whom he gave 
Aberfraw
 with 
Northwales; Cadelh
 the second, who had given him 
Dinevowr
 with 
Southwales,
 and took also by force 
Mathraval
 and 
Powys
 land after the death of 
Mervyn
 the third sonne, to whom their Father 
Rodri
 had given the same.


{fleur-de-lys} 
Roderick
 the 
Great
 is esteemed by all writers to be the un∣doubted owner and possessor of all 
Wales. Venedotia
 or 
North∣wales
 descended unto him from his mother 
Esylht,
 the daughter and sole heir of 
Conan Tindaethwy. Demetia
 or 
Southwales
 (as some do affirm) descended to him by his wife the daughter and heir of 
Meyric ap Dyfnwal ap Arthen ap Sitsylht
 king of 
Caer∣digan:
 her brethren (who are thought to be illegitimate) holding of her husband. 
Powys
 he had by 
Nest,
 the Sister and Heir of 
Con∣gen ap Cadelh
 king of 
Powis,
 his fathers mother. These three Dominions he appointed under their meares and bounds, with a Princely house in each of them; these he named 
Y tair Talaeth,
 and left them unto three of his sons, 
Anarawd, Cadelh,
 and 
Mer∣vyn,
 who were called 
Y tri Twysoc Talaethioc,
 that is, The three 
Crowned Princes,
 because each of them did wear upon his Bonet or Helmet a 
Coronet
 of 
Gold,
 being a broad lace or headband indented upwards, set and wrought with precious stones, which in the 
Brytish
 or 
Welsh
 speech is called 
Talaeth,
 and Nurses do to this day name that broad headband wherewith a childs head is bound uppermost, other linen being under it, 
Talaeth. Aberffraw
 was the 
Chief House
 of the 
Prince
 of 
Gwyneth,
 whose Dominion was therefore called 
Talaeth Aberffraw: Dinevowr
 the princi∣pal house of 
Dehevbarth,
 whereof that part is named 
Talaeth Dinevowr:
 and in like manner 
Talaeth Mathraval,
 was so called
 from the principal seat of 
Powys
 called 
Mathraval.


Giraldus Cambrensis,
 in his Book Entituled, Descriptio Cam∣bria,


is of opinion that 
Mervyn
 was the eldest son of 
Roderike,
 to whom 
Venedotia
 was given, and was the father of 
Anandhrec,
 who was the father of 
Meyric,
 that was the father of 
Edwal,
 that was the father of 
ago,
 &c: and that 
Anarawd
 had 
Powys
 and died without issue. But the common opinion of all other Wri∣ters is otherwise, agreeable to what this Author affirmeth.


Roderic
 had also other sons, 
Rodrick, Meyric, Edwal
 or 
Tudwal, Gwyriad
 a
d 
Gathelic,
 of whom more in the follow∣ing History.


¶ The Armes of 
Rodri
 the 
Great.
 G. a Cheveron between three Roses A. Or else thus▪ Quarterly G. and Or. four Lyons passant gardant counterchanged.


Roderic
 the 
Great
 is said to have corrected some of the old Brytish 
Laws,
 and to have appointed 
new.


He ordained that his eldest son should have the 
Crown
 or Co∣ronet of 
Aberffraw,
 with the fifteen 
Cantreds
 thereunto belong∣ing; that his Second should have the 
Crown
 or Coronet of 
Dinevowr
 or 
Cardigan,
 with its fifteen 
Cantreds,
 extending from the mouth of the river 
Dovi,
 to the mouth of 
Severne;
 and that his Third should have the 
Crown
 or Coronet of 
Mathraval
 with the fifteen 
Cantreds
 of 
Powis,
 from the mouth of the river 
Dee
 to the Bridge over 
Severne
 at 
Gloucester.


He ordained also that his eldest Son and his Successors, should continue the payment of the ancient Tribute to the 
Crown
 of 
London,
 and that the other two, their Heirs and Suc∣cessors, should acknowledge his Sovereignety, and pay the like tribute to him and his Successors, and that upon the invasion of Strangers, they should send him aid, and that he should also be ready to protect them, when there should be need.


Moreover he ordained that when any difference should arise between the Princes of 
Aberffraw
 and 
Cardigan,
 the three 
Princes
 should meet at 
Bwlch y Pawl,
 and after hearing of coun∣sel on both sides, the Prince of 
Powis
 should be Umpire be∣tween them.


And if the difference were between the Kings of 
Aberffraw
 and 
Powis,
 that they should likewise all three meet at 
Dôl rhia∣nedd
 (perchance 
Morva rhianed
 on the bank of the river 
Dee
) where the King of 
Cardigan
 was to end the controversie.


And if there should be difference between the Kings of 
Powis
 and 
Cardigan,
 the Meeting should be at 
Llys wen
 upon the river 
Wy,
 and the King of 
Aberffraw
 to decide it.


Also he ordained that all Strong-holds, Castles, and Citadels, should be fortified and kept in repair; that the Churches and Chappels should be re-edified and adorned, and that in all Ages the History of 
Brytain
 (being faithfully 
Registred
) should be kept therein. This I gathered out of a 
MS.
 of 
Roger Lloyds
 of 
Pentro Aron,
 a 
Shropshire
 Gentleman, which he copied out of an old Book of his Neighbours 
Thomas Powel
 of 
Parke
 
Esq
. Some of these Ordinances are to be seen also in an old Chard of the Prin∣ces of 
Powis
 beginning, 
Cadwaladrus
 ultimus Rex 
Britonum
 &c. now in the keeping of Sir 
Percy Herbert
 Lord 
Powis;
 Doctor 
Powel
 cites the sayd 
MS.
 in his Latine History; It is supposed to be written by 
Thomas Maelor.


In the beginning of the forementioned King 
Alfreds
 Reign, there were 
Brytains
 that inhabited some parts of 
Scotland,
 as 
Alclud
 Castle (now called 
Dunbritton
) and the Country between the Towne of S
terling
 and the S
ea. Constantius
 and his Brother 
Hebertus
 were their 
Kings. Caeralclud
 the Royall Seat of the 
Northern Brytains
 was destroyed by the 
Danes
 A. D. 870, at what time (according to 
Hump. Lloyd
) those 
Britains
 being by reason of the oppression of the 
Danes
 forced to seek out new habitations came into 
Northwales. Florent. Wigorn. Ethelward. Asser
 and other Historians averre the same.


In King 
Alfreds
 time it was thus recorded touching the 
West Saxon
 Kingdom, 
In toto Regno

Anaravvd
 The Eldest Sonne of 
RODERIKE
 the 
Great.


ANarawd
 the son of 
Roderick
 began his Reign over 
Wales
 in the year of Christ 877. In his time 
Rollo
 with his 
Normans
 came to 
France,
 and conquered the Country of 
Neustria,
 which (from the 
Normans
 is called 
Normandy
 to this day. At that time the 
Danes
 that had fled to 
Excester,
 having broken the Truce, unto which they were sworn, were so pursued by 
Alfred,
 that they were glad
 to give him Pledges for the performance of the 
Articles
 agreed upon between him 
nd them; but the year following they 
an all the land on the North side of 
Thames,
 which they held, and after they passed the River to 
Chipenham
 in 
West∣sex,
 and the 
Englishmen
 fled before them, yet 
Alfred
 fought with a number of them, slew their 
Prince,
 and wan their Standard, which they called 
Raven.
 After that he overthrew them at 
Edendowne,
 where, after they had given him Pledges,
 their Captain 
Godrun, 
ali
s
 Gurmond
 received the Christian Faith, and then reigned in 
East Angle.
 The year 878. died
 
Aedan
 the son of 
Melht,
 a Noble man of 
Wales:
 and the se∣cond
 year following there was a great battel fought by the 
Danes,
 and the 
Englishmen
 of 
Mercia,
 against the 
Welshmen
 near the River 
Conwy,
 where the 
Welshmen
 had the victory; and this battel was called, 
The Revenge of Rodericks death.
 After that about the year 882. the 
Danes
 that lay at 
Fullen∣ham
 by 
London,
 passed the Sea to 
France,
 and marching along the River 
Seyn,
 spoiled the Country about 
Paris,
 and over∣threw
 the 
Frenchmen
 in battel; but they were afterward all slain and drowned by the 
Brytains
 of 
Armorica.
 Then 
Alfred



got 
London,
 and chased away the 
Danes
 that besieged 
Roche∣ster,
 but at the same time he lost a great number of ships, which the 
Danes
 took and sunk at 
Sturmutham.
 In the year 889. 
Submon Cubin
 the greatest 
Clerk
 in 
Scotland
 died.
 And the year following the Black Nation (for so the 
Brytish
 Book calleth the 
Danes
 and 
Normans
 came to 
Northwales,
 and did much hurt. Here I think it convenient to let the 
Reader
 understand from whence such a wonderful number of 
Danes
 and 
Normans
 came. The Kingdom of 
Denmark
 had under it, not only 
Denmark,
 which is but a small country di∣vided by the sea into Isles and half-Isles, as that which ad∣joyneth to 
Saxon
 and
 
Holsake,
 and runneth like an arme of the Sea, called 
Cymbrica Chersonesus,
 and the Isle of 
Sealand
 and 
Funen,
 with a piece of the main land adjoyning to 
Sweth∣land;
 but also 
Norway
 and the great country of 
Suetia
 or 
Swethland,
 which reacheth to 
Moscovia,
 and almost to the 
North Pole.
 This Country being scarce known to the world at that time, poured out of it (like the 
Trojan
 horse) divers people, that at sundry times overran and spoiled all 
Europe
 with a great part of 
Africa,
 like a suddain hideous storm, fil∣ling every Country whereunto they came. From thence came the 
Goths,
 who overran 
Germany, France, Spain, Afrike
 and 
Italy.
 From thence came the 
Vandals
 of no less worthiness. From thence came the 
Lombards,
 the 
Alans,
 the 
Switzers,
 the 
Burgundians,
 the 
Danes,
 and the 
Normans,
 who came from 
Norway
 and the sea shore of 
Eastland
 by 
Prussia,
 from whence the 
Vandals
 came. He that is desirous to understand the marvellous history of 
Swethenland,
 let him read the works of 
Olaus Gothus,
 and 
Joannes Magnus.
 And from these Countries (as I declared before) came the people called the 
Danes,
 and not from 
Denmarke
 only. The yeare 890 there
 came from these Countries 250 sailes, which landed at 
Ly∣mene
 in 
Kent,
 hard by the great wood called 
Andreslege,
 and
 built a Castle at 
Auldre
 or 
Apledor,
 as some books have it. The same time also came 
Hasting
 with 80 sailes to Thames mouth, and built a Castle at 
Middleton,
 and swore to 
Alfred,
 that he would never annoy him or his Subjects more: but shortly after he built a Castle at 
Beamfleete,
 and invaded the Country about him. Wherefore Alfred came & overthrew his


Castle, and took his Wife and two Sonnes, which having first by his means bin Christned, he sent to their Father again.


{fleur-de-lys} Other Kingdoms and Countries of 
Europe
 were disquieted
 with this persecution of the 
Danes
 as well as 
England.
 For of this 
Hasting
 it is written, that l
ying siege to the City of 
Limogis
 in 
France,
 and despairing of the speedy gaining of the same, he de∣vised this trick to get it. He fained himself dangerously sick, and sending to the Bishop and the Consull of the city, desired them most instantly, he might be admitted to the Christian Faith, and be Baptized before his death. The Bishop and the Consul (suspecting no guile) were very glad not only to be delivered from the present distresse, but also to gain so great a person to the Christian Religi∣on Whereupon a firm Peace being made between both Nations, 
Hasting
 is Baptized, the Bishop and the Consul being his God-fa∣thers; this being performed, he was carried by his Souldiers to his ships, in very weak case, as was outwardly pretended. About midnight he caused himselfe, being compleatly armed, to be laid upon a 
Beere,
 commanding also his souldiers to arme themselves, and to carry their weapons under their upper garments, so that they might be ready when he should give them a signe. The day following all things being in a readiness, he was carried solemnly by his people with great clamour and counterfeit mourning, to be interred in the chief 
Church
 of the 
City,
 where the Bishop and the Consul accompani∣ed with all the chief men of the city came to honour the Buriall; but as soon as the Bishop had made himselfe ready to bury the corps, (most of the Towns-men being in the 
Church
) 
Hasting
 stepped up all armed with his sword drawn, and first killed the Bishop and the Consul, and then fell with his armed Souldiers upon the naked peo∣ple, and destroyed them in a manner every one, putting all to the sword, sparing neither sex, age, or infirmity. And when he had sack'd the Town, he sent messengers to 
Charles
 the French King for peace, which he obtained, and (to keep him quiet) the city of 
Char∣tres
 also towards his charges.


About this time 
Euneth
 the son of 
Bledryd
 a Baron of 
Wales
 died. And the year 893. 
Anarawd
 King or Prince of
 
Northwales
 came with a great number of 
Englishmen,
 and making war against his brother 
Cadelh
 spoyled the Coun∣tries of 
Caerdigan
 and 
Ystradgwy.
 In those dayes the 
Danes
 besteged 
Excester,
 against whom, when 
Alfred
 went, they


which were at 
Auldre
 passed over to 
Essex,
 and built a Castle at 
Scobrith,
 from whence they took their journey to 
Buding∣ton
 upon 
Seaverne.
 And when 
Alfred
 came to 
Excester
 the 
Danes
 fled to sea, and spoyled the sea-coasts of 
Wales.
 And they which were in 
Budington
 hearing of the Kings coming fled back to their Castle in 
Essex.
 Another company of them came to 
Leycester,
 where 
Alfred
 did bes
ege them, till they were driven to eat the flesh of their Horses. Afterwards the year 895 the 
Danes
 that were in 
Leycester,
 with the rest
 of them which were in 
Northumberland,
 passed by the North
 seas to Meresige, an Isle in 
Essex,
 and the year following they entred the River 
Lyne
 with the 
Thames,
 and there built a Castle twenty miles from 
London;
 and as they came out to spoil the country, they were overthrown, and having lost four of their Princes, fled to the Castle. Then 
Alfred
 dividing the river into three parts, the water was so low, that their ships could not returne to the sea, which when the 
Danes
 perceived, they left their wives and children in 
Essex,
 and went spoiling
 the Country to 
Quadbrydge
 upon 
Seaverne,
 and passing the river spoyled the Countries of 
Brecknocke, Gwentland,
 and 
Gwentlhwg.
 Also this year a great number of them went to 
France
 by the river 
Seyn,
 and another company of them spoyled the coasts of 
Devonshire,
 where after a long conflict, they lost six ships. The summer following 
Ireland
 was de∣stroyed by strange wormes having two teeth, which consumed every thing that was greene in the Land. These seem to be Locusts, a plague unusuall in these Countries, but often seen in 
Afrike, Italy,
 and other hot Regions.


About the yeare 900 
Igmond
 came from 
Ireland
 with a
 great number of Souldiers to 
Anglesey,
 where the 
Welshmen
 gave him Battell at 
Molerain.


{fleur-de-lys} There be some Copies of this History, which affirme, that this battel, between 
Igmond
 Captain of the Black Nations and the 
Brytains,
 wherein 
Mervyn
 was slaine, was fought at a place called 
Meilon,
 from whence it was called 
Maes Rhôs Meilon.


The same yeare dyed 
Alfred,
 which some call 
Alured,
 ma∣king (
v
 a vowell, which should be a consonant. This Prince translated the ancient Lawes of 
Dysnwal Moelmut
 King of 
Brytain
 and the Laws of 
Marsia
 Queen of 
Brytain
 and wife


to 
Cyhelin,
 out of Brytish into English, and called it 
Marsian Laws,
 which was afterward called 
Westsaxon Lex,
 and kept in a part of 
Mercia,
 and in all the Countries on the South of 
Thames,
 for the other part of the Land had another 
Law
 called 
Dane lex,
 and these remained till 
Edward
 the 
Confes∣sors
 time, who of these two Lawes made one. Also this 
Alfred
 did divide the day into three Parts, by a Taper which burnt continually in his Chappel, and endured just Twenty four hours. The first part of that time he bestowed at his Book and in Prayer; the second in the Affairs of the Common∣wealth: & the third part to take his Rest and refresh himself: after his death, a certain 
Clerke
 made his 
Epitaph,
 as fol∣loweth.




Nobilitas innata tibi probitatis honorem


Armipotens 
Alfrede
 dedit, probitasque laborem,


Perpetuúmque labor nomen, cui mixta dolori


Gaudia semper erant, spes semper mixta timori.


Si modò victor eras, ad crastina bella pauebas,


Si modò victus eras, ad crastina bella parabas,


Cui vestes sudore jugi, cui sica cruore


Tincta jugi, quantum sit onus regnare probârunt.


Non fuit immensi quisquam per climata mundi,


Cui tot in adversis vel respirare liceret:


Nec tamen aut ferro contritus ponere ferrum,


Aut gladio potuit vitae finisse labores.


I am post transactos regni vitaeque labores,


Christus
 ei fit vera quies, sceptrumque perenne.




After 
Alfred
 reigned 
Edward
 his son, against whom 
Adel∣wulph
 his brother made war, for flying to 
Northumberland
 he stirred the 
Danes
 against him. He was chosen King as well by the 
Danes
 as the 
Angles,
 which at that time were both become one people: and after he subdued the 
East Saxons,
 and with a great army spoyled 
Mercia,
 he passed over 
Thames
 at 
Crick∣land,
 and destroyed 
Brythend,
 and returned home with great spoil. At that time 
Evneth
 was slain in 
Arwystli.
 King 
Ed∣ward
 also pursued his brother, and overran all the land be∣twixt
 
Ouse,
 and the Dike of 
S. Edmond,
 and returned back with all his army, saving the Kentishmen, who tarried behind
 to spoil, against whom the 
Danes
 came, and fighting a sore bat∣tel,


slue a great number of them, and put the rest to flight. The 
Danes
 about the year 905. entred into 
Ireland,
 and fight∣ing
 with the 
Irishmen
 slue 
Carmot
 King and Bishop of all 
Ire∣land,
 and the sonne of 
Cukeman,
 a man both Godly and Re∣ligious, and 
Kyrnalt
 sonne of 
Murgan
 King of 
Lagines.
 About a year after dyed 
Asser
 Archbishop of 
Wales.


{fleur-de-lys} There were two of this name at the same time both Country∣men
 and kinsmen; the one being the Uncle, was Arch-bishop of 
S. Davids,
 of whom mention is made in this place. The other 
Asser
 the Nephew was a man of excellent Learning and Wisdom, and for that cause being Chancellor to his Uncle, was sent for by King 
Alfred
 to teach his children; this wrot the Acts of the same 
Alfred,
 and was afterward Bishop of 
Sherburn,
 of him mention is made in the 
English
 Chronicles.


About this time 
Edward
 sent a great Army to 
Northum∣berland,
 which spoiled the Country, and then returned home: neverthelesse, the 
Danes
 followed them, and destroyed a great part of 
Mercia.
 But within a while after, 
Edward
 gathe∣red an Army, and giving them Battell, overthrew them, and slue their Kings 
Alden
 and 
Edelwulph,
 and a great number of their Nobles. This year died 
Edelred
 Duke of 
Mercia,
 who
 had been long sick; after him, 
Elfleda
 his Wife enjoyed the Country of 
Mercia,
 saving the Cities of 
London
 and 
Oxford,
 which King 
Edward
 seised into his own hands. The yeare 907 died 
Cadelh
 King or Prince of 
Southwales,
 second sonne
 of 
Roderike
 the Great, leaving behind him three sonnes, 
Howel Dha
 (that is to say 
Howel
 the 
Good
 who succeeded his Father in the Kingdome of 
Southwales, Meyric
 and 
Cly∣daw
.
 About two years after King 
Edward
 built the Castle
 of 
Hartford
 betwixt the Rivers 
Benefic, Minier,
 and 
Lige;
 and also the Borough of 
Wytham
 in 
Essex,
 and lay at 
Wealdyne,
 where he subdued those Countries. The year following, the 
Danes
 of 
Leycester
 and 
Hampton
 slew a great number of 
Eng∣lishmen
 at 
Hochnorton,
 and in their returne homeward spoy∣led all 
Oxfordshire.
 The next year after that there came a great Navy from 
Tydwike
 with 
Uther
 and 
Rahald,
 which passing by the Westerne Sea into 
Wale
 destroyed 
S. Davids
 and there was the Battell of 
Dinerth
 fought
, where 
Meyloc
 (the sonne of 
Peredur Gam
 was slaine. And afterward


they entred 
Herefordshire,
 where they were fought withall, and 
Rahald
 slaine, and the rest compelled to forsweare the Kings Country. Then the King caused the south side of 
Sea∣vern
 to be defended with a great Army; yet did the 
Danes
 twice enter his land, once by the 
East
 at 
Werd,
 another time at 
Porto∣gan,
 but were both times overthrown by the 
English.
 And then they departed to the Ile of 
Stepen,
 from whence they were driven by hunger to 
South-wales,
 where they were beaten and constrained to depart into 
Ireland.
 The yeare ensuing there was a great battel fought betwixt the 
Kentishmen
 and the 
Danes
 at 
Holme,
 but who had the victory there is no cer∣tainty.
 In the yeare 913 
Anarawd
 chief King of 
Wales
 dyed, leaving behind him two Sonnes, 
Edwal Voel,
 or the 
Bald,
 who Reigned after him, and 
Elise;
 some say a 
3
d
 named 
Meyric.


¶ After the death of 
Roderic
 the 
Great,
 the Northern 
Bri∣tains
 of 
Stratclwyd
 and 
Cumberland,
 were (as 
Hector Boetius
 and 
Buchanan
 relate) much infested and weakned with the daily in∣cursions of 
Danes, Saxons
 and 
Scots;
 which made many of them (all that would not submit their necks to the yoake) to quit their Country, and seek out more quiet habitations. Un∣der the Conduct of one 
Hobert
 they came to 
Gwyneth
 in the beginning of 
Anarawd's
 Reigne, who commiserating their di∣stressed condition gave them the 
Country
 from 
Chester
 to the River 
Conwey
 to inhabit, if they could beat out the 
Saxons,
 who had lately possessed themselves thereof. These 
Brytains
 ha∣ving returned thanks to their Cousen 
Anarawd
 as was meet, fell upon the 
Saxons,
 and, necessity giving edge to their valour, soon drove them out thence, being yet scarce warme in their seats. About three years after this A. D. 880 
Edryd Wallthîr
 King of the 
Saxons
 (called by the 
English
 Historians 
Eadred
 Duke of 
Mercia
) made great preparations for the regaining of the said 
Country;
 But the Northern 
Brytains,
 who had settled themselves there, having intelligence thereof, for the better se∣curing of their Cattel and goods, removed them over the river 
Conwey.
 In the mean time 
P. Anarawd
 was not idle, but gathe∣red together all the strength he could make; His Army encam∣ped neare the Towne of 
Conwey,
 at a place called 
Cymryt,
 where He and his Men making gallant resistance against the assaults of


the 
Saxon
 power, at length after a bloudy fight obtained a compleat Victory. This Battel was called 
Gwaeth Cymryt Conwey
 because it was fought in the Towneship of 
Cymryt
 hard by 
Conwey,
 but 
Anarawd
 called it 
Dial Rodri,
 because he had th
re revenged▪ the death of his Father 
Rodri.
 In this battel 
Tudwal
 the sonne of 
Rodri Mawr
 received a hurt in the knee, which made him be called▪ 
Tudwal glôff
 or the 
Lame
 e∣ver after; his Brethren to reward his valour and service gave him 
Uchellogoed Gwynedd;
 The 
Brytains
 pursuing their vi∣ctory, chased the 
Saxons
 quite out of 
Wales
 into 
Mercia,
 where having burne and destroyed the Borders they returned home laden with rich spoyles. And 
Anarawd
 to expresse his thank∣fulnesse to God for this great Victory, gave Lands and Possessi∣ons to the Church of 
Bangor,
 as the 
Records
 of that 
Sea
 doe testify, and likewise to the Collegiate Church of 
Clynnoc
 in 
Ar∣von,
 as we read in the 
Extent
 of 
North Wales.
 After this the Northern 
Brytains
 came back from beyond the river 
Conwey,
 and possessed again the Lands as
igned the 
 between 
Conwey
 and 
Chester,
 which for a long time after they peaceably enjoyed. Some 
English
 writers as 
Ma
. Wes
 &c.
 not considering (belike) that the 
Brytains
 had lands in 
Loegria
 and 
Albania,
 af∣ter King 
Cadwaladers
 time, take those of the 
North, Cumber∣land,
 and 
Stratclwyd
 for the 
Brytains
 of 
Wales. Asser Menev.
 who lived A. D. 875. saith that 
Halden
 the 
D
n
 marched into 
Northumberland,
 which he subdued, having before conquered the 
Picts
 and 
Brytains
 of 
Stratclwyd
 in 
Northumberland,
 Perrex∣it eam{que} subjugavit, nec non & 
Pictos & Stratcludenses.


Of 
Collwyn
 ap 
Tagno
 one of the fifteen Tribes of 
Gwynedd▪ Collwyn
 ap 
Tagno
 lived in the time of Prince 
Anarawd
 about the yeare of our Lord 877. He was Lord of 
Ardudwy
 (now a part of 
Merionethshire
) and of 
Evi
nyth
 (now one of the Hun∣dreds of 
Carnarvonshire
) and also of part of 
Llyn.

 and 
Gwgan
 the sonnes of 
Merwydd
 ap 
Collwyn
 were grown up to mens estate in the be∣ginning of the Reigne of Prince 
Griffith
 
p 
Conan,
 and lived in 
Llyn,
 when he first layd claime to the 
Principality
 of 
Wales▪
 as is recorded in the life of the said Prince. From whence i
 may be easily guessed what time he lived. His dwelling is said to


have been at 
Bronwens tower,
 afterwards called (from him) 
Caer Collwyn,
 now 
Harlech.

This Sir 
Howel
 ap 
Griffith
 (whom his Countrymen re∣member by the name of 
S. Howel y Bhwyall,
 from his Poll-axe) lived in the time of King 
Edward
 the 3d. and served under the 
black Prince
 at the battell of 
Poictiers,
 wherein 
Iohn
 King of 
France
 was taken prisoner: It is a tradition that goeth currant among Sir 
Howells
 Countrymen, that it was He, that first took 
him,
 which might be occasioned by some lines in the foregoing 
Cowydd
 of 
Iollo Goch's
 to him. And History leaving it doubt∣full who took him, he might be the man as well as any other; 
Paulus Aemilius, De Serres,
 and other 
French
 Historians say, there were severall challenged the honour of it; and that 
Denis Morbec
 a 
French
 man, but then a Captain in the 
English
 Army, seeing the 
French
 King so distressed that it was impossible for him to escape the hands of the 
English
 did only speak to him, at some distance, and advise him to surrender himselfe; So that it is very probable some other person took him, or (which is as much) forced him to yeeld himselfe a 
Prisoner,
 and that be∣ing known to be the King, he was in civility suffered to deliver


himselfe into the hands of his own Countryman 
Denis;
 But however it were, it is most certain Sir 
Howell
 behaved him∣selfe valiantly in that Battell, and performed some signall service with his axe there, as may be gathered from his 
reward,
 which was Great and Noble, for he had conferred on him the honour of Knighthood, the Constableship of the ancient Castle of 
Crickieth
 in 
Carnarvonshire,
 a new Coat of 
Armes,
 the farme of the Mills at 
Chester
 for life, and other things of great value; Besides, he had allowed in perpetuall memory of his service a 
Messe
 of meat to be carried before his 
Axe
 or Partisan for ever; Which messe after his death was carried down to be given to the Poore for the good of his soule; the said Messe had eight 
Yeomen
 attendants, found at the Kings charge, which were af∣terwards called 
Yeomen
 of the 
Crowne,
 and had eight pence 
per diem
 of standing wages, and continued to the beginning of Q. 
Elizabeths
 Reigne; Sergeant 
Roberts
 of 
Havod y 
wch
 neare 
Wrexham,
 who had been at first 
Yeoman
 of the 
Crowne
 heard it as a tradition in the Kings house, that the beginning of that Or∣der of Yeomen of the Crowne was from thence; This he told his Brother in Law 
Robert Turbridge
 of 
Caeruallen
 neare 
Ruthin
 Esq. who upon the other mans credit related it to Sir 
Iohn Wynne
 of 
Gwedir
 Knight and Baronet, from whose MS. History (remaining in the house of 
Gwedir
) this relation was taken.

Edvval Voel 
or the
 Bald, 
Sonne of
 ANARAWD.


AFter that 
Edwal 
Voel
 began his Dominion ober 
Northwales, Howel Dha
 being King or Prince of 
Southwales
 and 
Powys
 land, a terrible Comet ap∣peared in the firmament. At which time, or the year following, 
Leicester
 was new built.


{fleur-de-lys} I think that▪ the name of 
Leycester
 is here mistaken for 
Le∣gecestria,
 that is 
Chester,
 called by the 
Romans, Legionum Ce∣stria,
 which being destroyed by the 
Danes
 was (about this time) by the procurement of 
Adelred
 Duke of 
Mercia,
 and 
Elfled
 his wife, repaired and reedified, as 
Matth. Westm.
 writeth, and as the an∣cient Records of the City of 
Chester
 doe testify. Besides that, I find no mention of the reedifying of 
Leycester
 at this time, neither in the 
Brytish
 Chronicle, nor yet in any ancient English wri∣ter.


The next summer after the men of 
Develyn
 destroyed the Ile of 
Môn
 or 
Anglesey.
 And the year 917 
Clydawc
 the
 sonne of 
Cadelh
 was slaine by the hands of his brother 
Mey∣ric,
 and about the same time the 
Englishmen
 overthrew the
 
Danes
 after a great fight at 
Tottenhall.


The year 919 
Edelfled
 or 
Elfled
 Dutches of 
Mercia
 the
 wife of 
Edelred
 Duke of 
Mercia
 and sister to King 
Edward
 dy∣ed: She built the boroughs of 
Strengat
 and 
Bruge,
 by the For∣rest of 
Morph, Anno Domini 913.
 The next year after the building of that she built 
Tamworth
 and 
Stafford;
 and the year after that, 
Edelburgh;
 and the Winter following, 
Che∣renburgh
 and 
Wadeburgh;
 then the next summer, 
Runcofe
 or 
Runcorne,
 as some think. After that, she sent her whole


Army t
 
Wales,
 and fighting with the 
Welshmen
 wonne
 
Brecknocke,
 took the Quéen and 33 men. This was it, which is called in Welsh 
Gweythy Dinas Newydh,
 that is to say, 
The battell of the new Citty.
 Also she wan the towne of 
Derby,
 with all that Country from the 
Danes:
 neverthelesse she lost there four of her chiefest Captains.


{fleur-de-lys} 
Jo: Castoreus
 reporteth this story in this manner. 
Huganus
 Lord of 
Westwales,
 perceiving King 
Edward
 to be occupied in the Danish warre, farre enough from him, gathered an Army of 
Brytains,
 and entred the Kings land. Whereupon 
Elfled
 Lady of 
Mercia
 and sister to King 
Edward
 came to 
Wales
 with a strong Army, fought with the 
Welshmen
 at 
Brecknock,
 and putting 
Hu∣ganus
 to flight, took his 
 Wife and 34 men Captives, which shee brought with her to 
Mercia. Huganus
 thus discomfited, fled to 
Derby,
 and there being peaceably received by the Countrymen with fifteen men of warre, and two hundred Souldiers well appointed, joyned himselfe with the Kings adversaries the 
Danes, Elfled
 be∣ing hereof certifyed by the men of 
Derby,
 pursued him with a great Army, and entred the gates of the Towne, where 
Huganus
 resisted her and slue four of her chief Officers. But 
Gwyane
 Lord of the Ile of 
Elie
 her Steward set the gates on fire, and furiously running upon the 
Brytains
 entred the Towne. Then 
Huganus
 being over∣matched, and choosing rather to dye by the sword, then to yeeld himselfe unto a Woman, was there slaine. Thus out of 
Casto∣rous.


The yeare ensuing 
Elfled wan Leycester,
 and subdued all the 
Danes
 that lay there. The 
Yorkeshire men
 also did her homage and service: she dyed at 
Tamworth,
 after that shee had worthily ruled 
Mercia
 eight years, and lyeth buried at 
Glocester
 by 
S. Peters
 porch; upon her tombe this 
Epitaph
 was written.




O 
Elfleda
 potens, ô terror virgo virorum,


O 
Elfleda
 potens, nomine digna viri.


Te quoque splendidior fecit natura puellam,


Te probitas fecit nomen habere viri.


Te mutare decet sed solùm nomina sexus,


Tu Regina potens Réxque trophaea parans.


Iam nec 
Caesareos
 tantùm mirere triumphos,


Caesare
 splendidior virgo, virago vale.




After the death of 
Elfled, Edward
 disinherited her daugh∣ter
 
Alfwyen,
 and seazed the land of 
Mercia
 to his own hands.


{fleur-de-lys} The cause why 
Edward
 disinherited this young Lady his own Neece, whose mother 
Elfled
 his sister had done so much for him, was (as 
Castoreus
 writeth) for that 
Alfwyen
 not making the King her Uncle (whom her Mother had appointed guardian and over∣seer of her) privy to her doings, had promised and contracted marriage with 
Raynald
 King of the 
Danes:
 whereupon King 
Ed∣ward,
 to prevent his enemy, entred the land of 
Mercia,
 and seazed the same to his own hands, and carried also the said Lady with him into 
Westsex.
 The same Author also reporteth, that about this time 
Leofred
 a 
Dane,
 and 
Gruffyth
 ap 
Madoc,
 brother in law to the Prince of 
Westwales,
 came from 
Ireland
 with a great Army to 
Snowdon,
 and minding to bring all 
Wales
 and the 
Marches
 thereof to their subjection, overran and subdued all the Country to 
Chester,
 before King 
Edward
 had notice of their arrivall. Where∣at being sore offended, and loath to trouble his Subjects in that be∣halfe, made a vow that he and his sonnes, with their own people, would be revenged upon 
Leofred
 and 
Gruffyth,
 and thereupon came to 
Chester,,
 and wan the City from them. Then he divided his Army into two Battels, whereof He and his sonne 
Athelstan
 led the first, and 
Edmund
 and 
Edred
 the second, and so following them with as much celerity as he could, he overtook them at the for∣rest of 
Walewod,
 now 
Sherwod,
 where 
Leofred
 and 
Gruffyth
 set upon him fiercely, so that the King in the beginning was in some distresse, untill 
Athelstan
 stepped in between his Father and 
Leo∣fred,
 and wounded the 
Dane
 in the arme, in such sort, that hee being not able to hold his speare, was soon taken, and committed to the custody of 
Athelstan.
 In the mean time 
Edmund
 and 
Edred
 encountring with 
Gruffyth,
 slew him, and brought his head to their Father. Then 
Athelstane
 caused 
Leofred
 to be beheaded, and so both their heads being set up together on the top of the tower of 
Chester, Edward
 and his sonnes returned home with Great triumph.


Then 
Edward
 after he had built 
Glademutham
 dyed at 
Fe∣randyne,
 whose sonne named 
Alfred
 dyed also the same time at 
Oxford,
 and were buried both at 
Winchester, Anno 924.
 After his death 
Adelstan
 his base son reigned King of 
Eng∣land,



the worthiest Prince of 
Saxon
 bloud that ever reigned. He overcame 
Cudfryd
 the father of Reynald King of the 
Danes,
 at 
Yorke.
 He gathered also the second year of his Reigne a great Army against 
Hawlaf
 King of 
Ireland,
 who
 came with the whole power of the 
Scots
 and 
Danes
 against him, & gave him battel at 
Brimestbury,
 where 
Adelstan
 got the victory, who siue the said King 
Hawlaf
 and the King of 
Scots,
 and five Kings of the 
Danes
 and 
Norman▪,
 and twelve Earles,
 so that he brought all the land of 
England
 and 
Scotland
 in subjection to him, which none of his predecessors had ever attempted. The year 933. 
Owen
 the sonne of 
Gruffyth
 was
 slain by the men of 
Caerdigan.
 Then 
Adelstan
 entring 
Wales
 with a great Army brought the Kings of the Country to sub∣jection,
 and received yearly of tribute 20 pound in gold, and 300 pound in silver, and 200 head of Cattel: Yet the Lawes of 
Howel Dha
 appointed the King of 
Aberfraw
 to pay yearly to the King of 
London
 no more then 66 pound for a tribute: and that the Prince of 
Dinevowr
 and the Prince of 
Powys
 should pay a like summ, 66 pound yearly to the King of 
Aber∣fraw.
 To this 
Adelstan
 the Kings of 
Norway
 and 
France
 sent great and rich guifts to purchase his friendship and good will. In the year 936 died 
Euneth
 the sonne of 
Clydaw
,
 and Meyric the sonne of 
Cadelh.
 At this time also 
Adelstan
 did remove the 
Brytains
 that dwelt in 
Excester
 and therea∣bouts to 
Cornwal,
 and appointed the river 
Cambia
 to be the
 uttermost Mere towards 
England,
 as he had before appointed the river 
Wy
 to be the mere of 
England
 and 
Wales.
 In the year of Christ 939 the Noble Prince 
Adelstan
 dyed, and was
 buried at 
Malmsbury,
 his brother 
Edmund
 borne in wedlock Reigned in his stead, and in the first year of his Reigne, took
 five Cities from the 
Danes, Leycester, Darby, Stafford, Lin∣colne,
 and 
Notingham.
 Then 
Aulaf
 King of the 
Danes
 sent to 
Edmund
 to desire Peace and Baptisme, both which 
Ed∣mund
 granted him, so the 
Danes,
 which then were called 
Nor∣mans,
 received first the Christian Faith, 
Edmund
 being their Godfather, who making peace with them returned to 
Westsex
 with much Honour. This year dyed 
Abloic
 chief King of 
Ire∣land.
 The year following 
Cadelh
 the son of 
Arthvael
 a Noble 
Brytain
 was 
imprisoned,
 and dyed by poyson & 
Edwal Voel
 the


son of 
Anarawd
 and 
Elise
 his 
brother
 were s
aine in a battell they fought against the 
Danes & Englishmen.
 This 
Edwal
 had six sons, 
Meyric, Jevaf
 or 
Jevan, Jago,
 which is, 
James; Conan, Edwal Vachan,
 and 
Roderike.
 After his death, 
Howel Dha
 his Cousen german ruled all 
Wales
 during his life. 
Elise
 also had issue, 
Conan
 and a daughter named 
Trawst,
 which was mother to 
Conan ap Sitsylht, Gruffyth ap Sitsylht,
 and 
Blethyn ap Convyn,
 the two last whereof were afterwards Princes of 
Wales.

 ap

 ap

 ap

 He was Privy Councellor to Prince

 ap

 and to his sonne Prince 
David
 ap 
Llewelyn.
 He was 
Generall
 of Prince 
Llewelyn's
 Army, when the Earle of 
Chester
 with an Army of 
English
 invaded the 
Principality. Ednyved
 gave them battell, and after a bloudy fight, wherein on the 
English
 side were slaine three Lords, many Commanders of


good note with a great number of common souldiers, obtained an absolute Victory: For this service (among other rewards) his Lord & Master (the Prince) gave him a new coat of Armes, 
viz.
 G. a Cheveron Ermine between three Englishmens heads cooped, proper. Some say 
Ednyved's
 coate is, G. a cheveron S. between three helmets A.


Sir 
Griffith Lloyd
 Knight, the sonne of 
Rees
 ap 
Griffith
 ap 
Ednyvet Vychan
 was a valiant Gentleman but unfortunate, 
Magnae quidem sed calamitosae virtutis,
 as 
L. Florus
 saith of 
Sertorius.
 He was Knighted by K. 
Edward
 the 
First,
 when he brought him the first news of his 
Queenes
 safe delivery of a Sonne, at 
Carnarvon Castle:
 the King was then at 
Ruthlan,
 at his 
Parliament
 held there; This Sir 
Griffith
 after∣wards taking notice of the extream Oppression and Tyranny exercised by the 
English
 Officers, especially by Sir 
Roger Morti∣mer
 Lord of 
Chirke
 & Justice of 
Northwales,
 towards his Coun∣trymen the 
Welsh,
 became so far discontented, that he brake out into open Rebellion, verifying that saying of 
Solomon, Oppression maketh a wise man mad.
 He treated with Sir 
Edward Bruce
 (Brother to 
Robert
 then King of 
Scotland
) who had conque∣red 
Ireland,
 to bring or send over men to assist him in his de∣signe against the 
English,
 but 
Bruses
 termes being conceived too unreasonable, the treaty came to nought; however being despe∣rate he gathered all the forces he could, and in an instant, like a candle that gives a sudden blaze before it is out, overran all 
Northwales
 and the 
Marches,
 taking in all the 
Castles
 and 
Holds,
 but to little purpose, for soone after he was met with, his party discomfited and himselfe taken prisoner: this was in the yeare of our Lord 1322.

Records

Iohn Salter
 Justice of 
Northwales.








Sir 
Tuder Vaughan
 ap 
Grono
 descended from this 
Ednyvet,
 being the sonne of 
Grono
 ap 
Tuder
 ap 
Grono
 ap 
Ednyvet Vaug∣han.



He was, for Estate, Power, and Interest, one of the chiefest men in 
Northwales
 in his time, as 
Lewis Morgannwc
 hath it in a MS. of his. It is set down in the aforecited book of the 
Records
 of 
Northwales,
 how that he assumed to himselfe the 
Honour
 of 
Knighthood,
 requiring all people to call and style him Sir 
Tuder
 ap 
Grono,
 as if 
even then
 his mind had given him, that out of his loynes hereafter should spring those that should have power to conferre that 
Honour;
 The King, 
viz Edward
 the 
third
 up∣on notice hereof having sent for him & asked him, how he durst presume to invade his Prerogative, by assuming the title of 
Knight
 without his authority, received from him this answer, 
viz.
 that by a 
Law
 or 
Ordinance
 of King 
Arthur
 he might as∣sume that title, in regard he had those three qualifications, which whoever had was by the said 
Law
 to be deemed a 
Knight;
 1. He was a Gentleman. 2. He had a sufficient estate. 3. He was valiant and adventurous, saying this withall, If my valour and hardinesse be doubted of, Loe, here I throw downe my Glove, and am ready to fight with any man (whoever he be) for due proof thereof. The King liking well his courage and resolution, was easily perswaded to confirme to him the said 
Honour.
 From this Sir 
Tuder
 descended 
Worthies
 indeed, as 
Henry
 the 7th King of 
England,
 with the Kings, Queenes and Princes come from him. 
Henry
 the 7th was the sonne of 
Ed∣mund
 Earle of 
Richmond,
 who was the sonne of Sir 
Owen Tu∣der,
 the sonne of 
Meredith,
 the sonne of this Sir 
Tuder. Iasper
 second sonne to Sir 
Owen Tuder
 was created Earle of 
Pembroke
 by his halfe-Brother King 
Henry
 the 6th, and was a Noble He∣roe of the 
Lancastrian
 party. When King 
Henry
 the 6th was deprived both of his Kingdome and Life, and 
Edward
 the 4th of the House of 
Yorke
 setled in the 
Throne,
 he found means to convey his Nephew 
Henry
 Earle of 
Richmond
 into 
France,
 out of King 
Edwards
 reach, who had a jealous eye upon him, as being (in the right of his Mother) next Heire to the 
Crowne
 of the House of 
Lancaster.
 He returned into 
England
 with his said Nephew, who (being King) created him Duke of 
Bedford,
 which Honour he enjoyed about two years and then dyed. 
Richard Owen Theodor
 of 
Penmonyth
 in 
Anglesey
 Esq. is a Branch of the same Family.

The 
Williamses
 of 
Cochwillan
 and the 
Coetmors
 in the Coun∣ty of 
Carnarvon &c.
 are descended from 
Ednyvet Vaughan.
 Sir 
Griffith Williams
 of 
Vaenol
 (the fourth 
Baronet
 of the Name and Line) is descended from the 
Williamses
 of 
Cochwillan.
 The most Reverend Father in God 
Iohn Williams
 D. D. and Arch∣bishop of 
Yorke
 was of this Family. He was a Person of great abilities, which were a means to raise him to great 
Honours
 and 
Dignities:
 King 
Iames
 made him 
Dean
 of 
Westminster,
 Bishop of 
Lincolne,
 and 
Lord Keeper
 of the 
Great Seale
 of 
England,
 and he was advanced to the Arch-Bishoprick of 
Yorke
 by King 
Charles
 the First. His places and preferments brought him


wealth, which enabled him to purchase 
Cochwillan,
 which had been the house of his Ancestors, and also

Hovvel Dha 
Sonne to
 Cadell 
ap
 Rodri and Cousin German to EDWAL Voel.


THis 
Howel Dha
 King or Prince of 
Southwales
 & of 
Powys
 long before, after the death of 
Edwal Voel
 his Cousen, took upon him the Government of all 
Wales
 about the yeare of Christ 940. Not∣withstanding
 the sonnes of 
Edwal
 did somewhat murmur a∣gainst him he was for his Godly behaviour, discreet and just Rule beloved of all men. This 
Howel
 constituted and made Lawes to be observed throughout his Dominions, which were in use in 
Wales,
 till the Inhabitants received the lawes of 
England
 which was in the time of 
Edward
 the first, and in some places thereof long after. These Lawes are at this day to be seen in 
Latine
 and in 
Welsh.


{fleur-de-lys} 
Howel Dha
 King of all 
Wales
 perceiving the Lawes and customes of his Country to have growne into great abuse, and disregard, summoned the Archbishop of 
Menevia,
 with all the other Bishops and 
Chiefe
 of the 
Clergy
 to the number of 
140 Pre∣lates,
 and all the 
Barons
 and 
Nobles
 of 
Wales,
 with six men of the Wisest and best reputed in every Commot to meet all together at his house called 
Y Tuy gwyn ar Taf,
 that is, The 
White house
 upon the River 
Taf
 (in 
Carmarthenshire:
) Thither he came him∣selfe, and continued there with those his Nobles, Prelates vnd Sub∣jects all the 
Lent
 in Prayer and Fasting, craving the direction and blessing of Gods holy spirit upon his endeavour to reforme the Lawes and Customes of his Country, to the honour of God, and the good of his people. About the end of 
Lent
 he chose out of that com∣pany twelve of the wisest, gravest, and of greatest experience among them: to whom he added one 
Clerke
 or 
Doctor
 of the 
Lawes,
 na∣med 
Blegored,
 a learned and perfect wise man. These had in


charge to examine the old Laws and Customes of 
Wales,
 and to gather out of them such as were meet for the government of the Country: which they did, retaining those that were wholesome and profitable, expounding those that were doubtfull and ambigu∣ous, and abrogating those that were superfluous and hurtfull, and so ordained three sorts of Laws. The first, of the Ordering of the
 
Kings
 or 
Princes
 houshold, and his 
Court.
 The second, of the Af∣fairs
 of the 
Country
 and Common-wealth. The third, of the spe∣ciall
 
Customes
 belonging to particular places and persons. All these being read, Proclaimed, and Allowed, he caused three seve∣rall Books of them to be written, one for his daily use to follow his Court, another to lye in his Palace at 
Aberffraw,
 and the third at 
Dinevowr,
 that all the three Provinces of 
Wales
 might have the use of the same when need required. And for the better observati∣on of these Lawes, he caused the Archbishop of 
St Davids
 to de∣nounce sentence of Excommunication against all such of his Sub∣jects, as should refuse to obey them. Within a while after 
Howel
 (because he would omit nothing that might procure strength and Authority to his said Laws) went to 
Rome
 taking along with him, the Archbishop of 
 
S. Davids,
 the Bishops of 
 
Bangor
 and S. 
 
Asaph,
 and thirteen other of the most Learned and Wisest
 men in 
Wales,
 where the said Laws being recited before the Pope were by his Authority confirmed: then having finished his devout Pilgrimage and emptied his purse, he came home againe with his Company.




1. By these Laws they might not morgage their lands but to such as were of the same Family or kinred, 
De eadem parentelâ.


2. Every Tenant holding of any other than of the Prince of Lord of the Fee, paid a fine 
pro defensione Regia,
 which was called 
A∣rian ardhel,
 in Latine 
Advocarii.


3. No Legacy of Goods by Will was good, otherwise than those which were given to the 
Church,
 to the 
Lord
 of the 
Fee,
 or for payment of Debts


4. Every man might distraine as well for debts, as for Rent of lands, any goods, or cattell, saving Horses, which were counted to serve for a mans necessary defence, and were not distrainable with∣out the 
Prince
 his licence.


5. Causes of Inheritance were not heard or determined but from the ninth of November, til the ninth of February; or from the ninth of


May untill the ninth of August. The rest of the yeare was counted a time of Vacation, and so ordered as for sowing in the Spring, so for roaping in the Harvest.


6. This also is to be observed, that all matters of Inheritance of land were determined and adjudged by the 
King
 or 
Prince
 in 
per∣son,
 or his speciall Deputy (if he were sick or impotent) and that upon view of the same land, calling unto him the 
Freeholders
 of that place, 
two Elders
 of his 
Councill,
 the 
Chiefe Justice
 atten∣ding alwayes in the 
Court,
 the Ordinary 
Judge
 of the 
Country
 where the land lay, and the 
Priest.
 The manner of their procee∣ding was thus. The King or Prince sate in his 
Judiciall seate
 high∣er than the rest, with an 
Elder
 on his right hand, and another on his left, and the 
Freeholders
 on both sides next unto them, which for this cause (as I think) were called 
Uchelwyr.
 Before him directly a certain distance off and a little lower sate his 
Chiefe Justice,
 having the 
Priest
 on his right hand, and the ordinary 
Judge
 of that country on the left. The 
Court
 being set the Plain∣tiff came in with his 
Advocate, Champion,
 and 
Rhingylh
 or 
Ser∣geant,
 and stood on the right side: and last of all, the Witnesses of both Parties came, which stood directly before the 
Chiefe Justice
 at the lower end of the 
Hall
 untill they were called up to testify their knowledge touching the matter in controversy.




The figure of this I thought good to set down here before you.

After hearing the Books read, the depositions of the witnesses also, and full pleading of the 
Cause
 in 
open Court,
 upon warning gi∣ven by the 
Rhingylh,
 the Chief 
Justice,
 the 
Priest,
 and the ordi∣nary 
Judge,
 withdrew themselves for a while to consult of the mat∣ter, and then 
Secundum allegata & probata,
 brought their ver∣dict, the Court sitting. Whereupon the King or Prince after con∣sultation had with the Elders or Seniors which sate by him, gave definitive sentence; except the matter were so obscure and intri∣cate, that right and truth did not appeare: in that case it was tried by the two Champions, who put an end to it.


At this time the foresaid King 
Aulaf
 and 
Regnald
 entered the Land of 
Edmond,
 who gathering his strength together followed them into 
Northumberland,
 where he overcame them in plaine Battel, and chased them out of the Land, he remained a whole yeare in those Parts, to set things in order, and quiet the Country. And because he could not by any means bring the Inhabitants of 
Cumberland
 to live in any good order, he spoyled that Country, and committed it after∣wards to the Government of 
Malcolme
 King of 
Scotland,
 up∣on condition, that he should send him succours in all his warres both by Sea and Land.


{fleur-de-lys} Some other write, that King 
Edmond
 being accompanied
 with 
Lhewelyn ap Sitsylht
 (who was after 
Prince
 of 
Wales
) en∣tred 
Cumberland,
 and taking the two sonnes of 
Dummail
 King of
 that 
Province
 put out their eyes, and then gave that Country to 
Malcolme
 to be holden of him, upon this condition that he would keep the 
North part
 of the 
Realm
 from incursion of enemies, which afterward was but slenderly performed. This 
Malcolme
 was the sonne of 
Donald
 King of 
Scotland,
 and was the next King after 
Constantine
 the third, being in number the 76.


In the yeare 942 died 
Hubert
 Bishop of 
S. Davids▪
 the
 year following 
Marclois
 Bishop of 
Bangor,
 and 
Ussa
 the sonne of 
Lhavye
 died. The yeare 944 the 
Englishmen
 entred 
Wales
 with a strong Army, and after they had spoiled 
Strad Clwyd,
 returned borne. At which time 
Conan
 the sonne of 
Elise
 was
 in danger of death by poyson, and 
Everus
 Bishop of 
S. Davids
 dyed. The yeare after 
Edmund
 King of 
England
 was slain by
 Treason, as some writers say, upon 
S. Augustines
 day, as he was at dinner. Other say, that he espyed an 
Outlaw
 fitting in



the
 Hall, 
and as he drew him from the Table the Outlaw slew the King with a knife.


{fleur-de-lys} And some are of opinion, that as the King would have rescu∣ed
 a man of his from an Officer who had arrested him, the same Of∣ficer slue him, not knowing that he was the King: he lyeth buried at 
Glastenbury.


After his death, 
Edred
 or 
Edfred
 his Brother was Crow∣ned in his stead, who making an expedition into 
Scotland
 and 
Northumberland
 subdued both the 
Northumbers
 and 
Scots
 promising fealty and homage by Oath, which was not long kept. In the yeare 948 died 
Howel Dha
 the Noble and
 worthy King of 
Wales,
 whose death was much bewailed by all men, for he was a 
Prince
 that loved Peace and good Or∣der, and that truly feared God. He left behind him four sonnes, 
Owen, Run, Roderike,
 and 
Edwyn,
 betwixt whom and the sonnes of 
Edwal,
 there ensued great Warres, for the chief Rule of 
Wales,
 as shall appeare in the History follow∣ing.


¶ The sonnes of 
Howel Dha,
 as some Writers doe record it, were these, 
viz. Owen,
 who did not live long after his Fa∣ther, 
Eneon, Meredyth, Dyfnwal, Rodri,
 the two last whereof, as is conceived, were slaine in the Battell fought neare 
Llanrwst
 A. D. 952 by the sonnes of 
Edwal Voel. Run
 Lord of 
Cardi∣gan
 and slaine before the death of his Father. 
Conan y Cwn
 who possessed 
Anglesey. Edwin,
 who was also slaine, as is sup∣posed, in the forementioned battell. 
Owen
 ap 
Howel Dha
 dyed about the same time.


There was a battell fought between 
Howel
 and 
Conan
 ap 
Ed∣wal Voel
 for the Ile of 
Anglesey,
 wherein 
Conan
 fell; 
Griffith
 his sonne renewing the Warre was overcome. And 
Cyngar
 a po∣tent man being driven out of the Ile 
Howel
 enjoyed quiet pos∣session thereof, and of the rest of 
Gwyneth.


I suppose 
Howel Dha
 was chosen to rule 
Wales
 during the minority of the sonnes of his Unkle 
Anarawd,
 who at the death of their Father were very young and not fit for Gover∣ment: we have it in some copies of his 
Laws
 that in the year of our Lord 914 (soon after the death of 
Anarawd
) he summo∣ned the Arch-Bishops, Bishops, the rest of the Clergy with the
 Lords of 
Wales,
 and six of the most discreet Freeholders out of


each 
Commot
 to appeare at his Court called 
y Tû gwyn ar Dâf,
 to advise with him touching the reformation of the 
British Laws;
 Being there met they compiled a new 
Body
 of 
Law;
 in the Preface of the said 
Laws
 he is styled 
Brenhin Cymru oll,
 King of all 
Wales. Northwales
 he held as 
Regent
 untill his Cousen 
Edwal Voel
 the eldest sonne of 
Anarawd
 came of Age to go∣verne; In the yeare of our Lord 920 
Howel Dha
 went to 
Rome
 to have his 
Laws
 confirmed by the 
Pope; Lambert
 Archbishop of 
Menevia, Mordaf
 Bishop of 
Bangor, Blegowryd
 Arch-Dea∣con of 
Landaffe,
 and 13 of the best learned of his 
Clergy
 with a like number of the 
Nobility
 accompanied him thither; the 
Pope
 confirmed his 
Laws,
 after they had been read before him, and nothing found dissonant to 
Gods word
 therein. After his returne from 
Rome,
 as a faithfull Steward he resigned the King∣dome of 
Gwyneth
 to his Cousen 
Edwal Voel
 being then of age, together with the 
Soveraignty
 of all 
Wales.


About the yeare 924 we have mention of 
Ludwall Rex omnium Wallensium,
 who in his submission to 
Athelstan
 is corruptly called 
Ludwal
 for 
Iudwal,
 which makes me to conclude that in the year 924 
Idwal
 had began his 
Reigne. Idwal Voel
 and 
Elisseu
 his brother being both slaine by the 
English
 A. D. 940 
Howel
 took upon him again the rule of 
Wales.

Of 
Caradoc Bhraichfrâs.


There were two famous men of this name, the first lived long before the other; the British 
Triades
 say, he was King of 
Cornwall
 in King 
Arthurs
 time, He was the sonne of 
Llyr Marini
 of the Tribe of 
Cunedda Wledig;
 Our books agree that he was Lord of 
Ferlix,
 to wit, the Country between 
Wy
 and 
Sea∣verne: Tegayrvron
 Daughter and Heire to King 
Pelinor
 was his Wife. His Armes are S. a Cheveron between three spears heads A. 
Goared
 pointed upwards G. The other 
Caradoc Bhraich∣frâs
 was Earle of 
Hereford
 and sonne of 
Coeliog Myngrudd
 of the North of 
Brytaine.
 He had issue a sonne called 
Lluddocca
 whose daughter 
Rhieingar
 was mother to 
Tuder Trevor,
 the 
Tribe
 of the 
Marches:
 the said 
Tuder
 marryed 
Gladys
 daughter to 
Howel Dha
 King of 
Wales
 who Reigned A. D. 940, which computation of time inclines me to believe he was the same 
Ca∣radoc
 that was styled King of 
Northwales
 and slaine A. D. 788. by the 
Saxons
 in revenge of K. 
Offa's
 death, who had bin slain at 
Ruthlan
 two years before; this was he to whom 
Rodri Mol∣wynoc
 or rather 
Conan
 his sonne gave the Lands between 
Chester
 and 
Conwey
 to inhabite. His Armes, Vert a Lyon rampant par∣ted per fesse Or & A. within a bordure of the 3d. Who say this 
Caradoc
 was the son of 
Gwyn
 ap 
Collwyn
 ap 
Ednowen,
 and father to 
Trahayrn
 King of 
Wales
 are much deceived.

There are many other worthy Families, in 
Southwales
 espe∣cially, descended from this 
Caradoc,
 whose names all my en∣quiry and industry could not procure.






Of Sir 
David Gam
 Knight.


Sir 
David Gam
 was the son of 
Llewelyn
 ap 
Howel Vaughan
 of 
Brecknocke
 by 
Maud
 the daughter of 
Ievan
 ap 
Rees
 ap 
Ivor
 of 
Eluel,
 the said 
Howel Vaughan
 was the son of 
Howel
 ap 
Eneon Sais
 ap 
Rees
 ap 
Howel &c.
 he was surnamed 
Gam,
 because he had but one ey; The 
Gameses
 derive their name & linage from him; He was a worthy Knight descended from the said 
Caradoc,
 whose 
Coat
 he gives: for his Policy and Valour we may style him our 
British Hannibal.
 He was a great stickler for the Duke of 
Lancaster,
 who was afterwards King 
Henry
 the 4th, upon which account it was, that 
Owen
 ap 
Griffith Vaughan
 (common∣ly called 
Owen Glendor
) was his mortall enemy: The said 
Owen
 having had his education at the Innes of Court, got to be prefer∣red to the service of King 
Richard
 the 2d, whose 
Scutifer,
 as 
Walsingham
 saith, he was; 
Owen
 being assured, that his King and Master 
Richard
 was deposed & murthered, & withall provoked by severall affronts and wrongs done him by the Lord 
Gray
 of 
Ruthin
 his neighbour, whom King 
Henry
 greatly countenanced against him, he took Armes; And looking upon 
Henry
 as an
 
Usurper
 he caused himselfe to be proclaimed 
Prince
 of 
Wales;
 And though himselfe were descended Paternally but from a younger Brother of the House of 
Powis,
 yet (as ambition is in∣genious) he finds out a way to lay claime to the 
Principality,
 as descended (by a daughter) from 
Llewelyn ap Griffith
 the last Prince of the 
British
 Race, He invaded the Lands, burnt and de∣stroyed
 the Houses and Estates of all those that favoured and adhered to King 
Henry.


Owen
 called a 
Parliament
 to meet at 
Machynlleth
 in 
Montgo∣mery shire,
 whither the Nobility and Gentry of 
Wales
 came, in obedience to his Summons, & among them the said 
David Gam,
 but with an intention to murther 
Owen;
 the plot being disco∣vered, and he taken before he could put it in execution, was like to have suffered had not intercession in his behalfe been made by 
Owen's
 best friends, and the greatest Upholders of his Cause,


whom he could not either handsomely or safely deny; 
Owen
 being thus prevailed upon pardoned him and let him goe free, only requiring of him, that he would for the future be more loyall and loving to him, which he promised, but did not per∣forme, for as soon as he came home to his own Country, where he was a man of great interest, he did exceedingly annoy and molest 
Owen's
 friends. When he lay in durance at 
Machynlleth
 for his attempt against 
Owen's
 life, there was this 
Englyn
 made of him, 
viz.




Davydd Gam dryglam dreigl, ddi ymwan frwydr,


Fradwr Rissiart Bhrenin


Llwyr yrhoes Diawl (hawl hwyl fliû


Y fath ystâd) î fys i'th dîn.




Not long after 
Owen
 entered the 
Marches
 of 
Wales
 destroying all before him, he burned then the house of 
Davyd Gam,
 and, as the report goeth, called to him one of 
Davids
 Tenants, to whom he spake thus mer
ily in verse,




O gweli di wr côch Cam


Yn ymofyn y Girnigwen


Dywed ei bôd hi tan y lan


A nôd y glo ar ei phenn.




But 
David
 himselfe kept out of 
Owen's
 reach, living most com∣monly at 
Court,
 till 
Owen's
 time was expired.


When King 
Henry
 the 5th went with an Army into 
France
 against the 
French, David Gam
 brought in to his service a goodly company of stout souldiers and 
Gentlemen,
 which upon all occasions shewed their resolution and courage. News be∣ing brought to the 
King
 that the 
French
 Army was advancing towards him and very numerous, he sent Captain 
Gam
 to ob∣serve their motions and to bring him an account of their num∣ber; He upon a diligent view perceiving them twice to exceed the number of the English was not a whit daunted, but when the 
King
 asked him how it was, what their number might be, made him this answer, 
An't please you, my Liege, They are enough to be killed, enough to run away, and enough to be taken Prisoners:
 The 
King
 was well pleased and much encouraged with this resolute saying of his; Nor did his tongue discover more courage then his hands, for in the heat of the Battell the 
Kings
 person being in danger he charged the enemy


with such eagernesse that he forced them▪ to give ground, so securing the King, though with the losse of much bloud, and also of his own life, for in that service 
Himselfe, Roger Vaughan
 his sonne in Law, and 
Walter Lloyd
 of 
Brecknocke
 his Kinsman received their mortall wounds; when the 
King
 was told they were past all hopes of recovery, he came unto them, and in re∣compence of their good service Knighted them 
all Three
 in the 
field,
 where they soon after dyed; Thus ended the Life but not the Fame of valiant Sir 
David Gam.

Ievaf & Iago the Sonnes of 
Edwal Voel.


AFter the death of 
Howel Dha,
 his Sonnes divided 
South-Wales
 and 
Powys
 betwixt them: And 
Jevaf
 and 
Jago
 the second and third sonne of 
Edwal Voel
 ruled 
North-Wales,
 their elder brother 
Mey∣ric
 being not a man fit to rule, They coming from the elder house would faine have had the chiefe Rule of all 
Wales,
 but were denyed it by the sonnes of 
Howel Dha:
 Thereupon 
Ja∣go
 (or 
James
 and 
Jevaf
 entred 
South-wales
 with a great power, 
Owen
 the sonne of 
Howel
 and his brethren came a∣gainst them and fought with them at the hills of 
Carno,
 where 
Jago
 and 
Jevaf
 had the victory: And the year follow∣ing 
Jago
 and 
Jevaf
 entred twice into 
South-wales,
 spoyled 
Dyvet,
 and siue 
Dwnwalhon
 the Lord thereof. And within a while after died 
Roderike
 one of the sonnes of 
Howel Dha.
 In the yeare 952. the sonnes of 
Howel
 gathered their strength together against 
Jevaf
 and 
Jago,
 and entring their land as farre as the river 
Conwy,
 they fought a cruell battel at a place called 
Gwrgustu,
 or 
Lhanrwst,
 as some think, where a great number were slaine on either side, as 
Anarawd
 the sonne of 
Gwyriad
 (or 
Uriet
 the sonne of 
Roderike
 the 
Great,
 and 
Edwyn
 the sonne of 
Howel Dha:
 in this battell the sons of 
Howel
 were overthrown by 
Jevaf & Jago,
 who pur∣sued them to 
Caerdigan,
 & destroyed their Country with fire and sword. About this time 
Yarthyr
 the sonne of 
Mervyn
 was drowned: and the year following 
Congelach
 King of 
Ireland
 was slaine. But to returne to 
Edred
 King of 
England.
 As soon as he was returned to his own Land, 
Aulaf
 with a


great Army landed in 
Northumberland,
 and was received of the people with much gladnesse; but anon after like fickle and unconstant men, they banished him the land, and took to their King one 
Hircius
 the sonne of 
Haroald,
 whom likewise after three years they expelled, and willingly submitted them∣selves to 
Edred,
 who after he had ruled▪ the whole Land eight years died, and was buried at 
Winchester.
 After him reigned 
Edwyn
 sonne of 
Edmund,
 in whose time nothing chanced worthy the remark, but that he married another mans Wife, her Husband being yet alive. This man after he had Go∣verned the Realme foure years died, leaving his Kingdome to his Brother 
Edgar,
 who was Crowned King of 
England
 in his stead. In the yeare 958. was a wonderfull hot sum∣mer,
 when 
Gwgan
 the sonne of 
Gwyriad
 the sonne of 
Rode∣rike
 died After that Heate, there followed a great plague
 in March following. In those daies 
Jago
 and 
Jevaf
 by force and strength ruled all 
Wales
 as they thought good: and yet for all their power, 
Abloic
 King of 
Ireland
 landed in 
Môn,
 and having burnt 
Holyhead
 spoyled the Country of 
Lhyn.
 In the yeare 961. the sonnes of 
Edwyn
 the son of 
Colhoyn
 were slain, after they had destroyed all the country to 
Towyn
 About this time 
Meyric
 the son of 
Cadvan, Rytherch
 Bishop of 
S. Davids,
 and 
Cadwalhon ap Owen
 departed out of this transitory World. Not long after, the country of 
North∣wales
 was sore distressed and spoyled by the Army of 
Edgar
 King of 
England.


{fleur-de-lys} The cause of this Warre was the non payment of the Tribute that the King of 
Aberffraw,
 by the Laws of 
Howel Dha
 was to pay to the King of 
London.
 In the end there was a peace conclu∣ded: for King 
Edgar
 understanding what hurt the Countries of 
England
 and 
Wales
 received daily, by reason of the great multi∣tude of Wolves that then abounded (especially in 
Wales
) which destroyed much sheepe and otherwise did great harme, released the Tribute in mony appointed by the said Laws of 
Howel Dha,
 and
 bound the Prince of 
Northwales
 to pay him yearly certain Wolves for his Tribute, and so to be released of that other Tribute in mony, which the said Prince performed, untill he had left never a Wolfe either in 
Wales
 or 
England.


In the yeare 966 
Roderike
 the sonne of 
Edwal Voel
 was



slaine by the 
Irishmen,
 by whom 
Aberfraw
 was destroyed. The next yeare there 
ell a great debate betwixt the two sonnes of 
Edwal, Jago
 and 
Jevaf,
 which had ruled joyntly from the death of 
Howel Dha
 to that time; and shortly after 
Jago
 having taken his brother 
Jevas
 by force, very cruelly kept him in Prison a long time. About this time, 
Eneon
 the sonne of 
Owen
 Prince of 
Southwales
 wan and seazed to himselfe the land of 
Gwyr.
 And in the yeare 969 
Mactus
 the sonne of 
Haroald
 with an Army of 
Danes
 entred the Ile of 
Anglesey,
 and spoyled 
Penmon.
 These 
Danes,
 were suffered by 
Edgar
 to inhabit quietly throughout all 
England,
 till they were grown as strong as the 
English,
 then they fell to such riotousnes and drinking, that much mischiefe ensued thereof: whereupon 
Edgar
 made a law, that every man should drink by measure, and caused a certain marke to be set in every Pot
 how deepe they should drink, and so by these meanes he some∣what stayed that immoderate ingurgitation. Not long af∣ter that, 
Godfryd
 the sonne of 
Haroald
 did subdue to him∣selfe the whole Ile of 
Anglesey,
 which he enjoyed not long. King 
Edgar
 likewise in the yeare 972 did send a great Na∣vy
 to 
Caerlheon
 upon 
Use,
 which shortly turned back, with∣out doing any notable act. The next year following, 
Howel
 the sonne of 
Jevaf
 raised a great power against his Uncle 
Jago
 for the deliverance of his Father out of Prison, and o∣vercoming his Uncle in Fight he chased him out of the Land, and he took his eldest Uncle 
Meyric
 the sonne of 
Edwal,
 and put out both his eyes, and kept him in Prison; where he died shortly after, leaving behind him two sonnes, 
Edwal
 and 
Jonaval,
 from which 
Edwal
 came afterward the most worthy Princes of 
Wales. Howel
 notwithstanding he had set his Father at Liberty, yet took upon himselfe the sole rule of the Land for his life time, his Father preferring a private Life before a Kingdome suffered him to Reigne. He had thrée Brethren, all men of great estimation, 
Meyric, Jeva
,
 and 
Cadwalhon,
 whose Lives doe follow.

Iago
 ap 
Idwal
 having fled to K. 
Edgar
 prevailed so farre with him, that He brought an Army into 
Northwales
 to restore him to his right: He came as farre as 
Bangor,
 where he was honourably received by 
Howell,
 who at his request was conten∣ted his Uncle 
Iago
 should have a share in the Government, as he had in his father 
Ievafs
 time. 
Edgar
 then founded a new 
Church
 at 
Bangor
 on the South side of the 
Cathedrall,
 which he dedicated to the blessed Virgin 
Mary:
 He confirmed the ancient liberties of that 
Sea,
 and bestowed Lands and gifts up∣on it; Then with 
Howel
 and 
Iago
 in his company, he march∣ed towards 
Chester,
 where met him by appointment six 
Kings
 more, 
viz. Keneth

Scots, Malcolme
 King of

 King of 
Man,
 and

 and

 Kings; These eight Kings having don him homage entred with him into his 
Barge,
 and rowed him, foure of each side, from his Palace to the Church or the Monastery of 
S. Iohn

Baptist,
 and after Divine Service rowed him back againe to his

Morgan Hên
 called in his younger years 
Morgan Mawr
 dyed about this time being a hundred years old, having li∣ved fifty years after the death of his Wife 
Elen
 Daughter of 
Roderic
 the 
Great,
 by whom he had one sonne called 
Owen. Morgan
 was a Valiant and a victorious 
Prince
 well be∣loved of his Subjects. 
Owen
 the sonne of Prince 
Howel Dda
 some years before the death of 
Morgan
 layd claime to 
Ystradwy
 and 
Ewyas
 (called the two sleeves of 
Gwent Vwchcoed
) being the right of 
Morgan,
 and seized upon them to his own use, but the matter through the mediation of the 
Clergy
 and 
Nobility



being by both parties referred to the decision of 
Edgar
 King of 
England,
 it was adjudged by the said 
King,
 that the sayd Lands did of right belong to the said 
Morgan,
 and to the 
Dio∣cesse
 of 
Landaffe,
 and that 
Owen
 ap 
Howel Dda
 had wrongfully possessed himselfe of the said Lands. The 
Charter
 of the said 
Award
 was made before the Arch bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Earles and Barons of 
England
 and 
Wales,
 and is kept at 
Lan∣daffe,
 as I have been informed by an old MS. called 
Y Cwtt
 cyvarwydd o Vorgannwg.
 In the old book of 
Landaffe
 there is also somewhat to the same purpose, but the mistake in both is that they make 
Howell Dda
 to be the intr
der into the said lands, who had been dead twenty years before King 
Edgar
 began his Reigne.

Hovvel the Sonne of 
Ievaf
 ap 
Edwal Voel.


AFter that 
Howel
 the sonne of 
Jevaf
 had expelled his Uncle out of the Land, he took the sole Rule of it. And at that time 
Dwnwalhon
 Prince of 
Strad∣clwyd
 took his journy to 
Rome.
 Then died 
Edwal∣hon
 the sonne of 
Owen.
 Likewise 
Edgar
 King of 
England
 passed out of this transitory life after that he had built many Monasteries. After him 
Edward
 his sonne was King, who when he had Reigned foure years was traiterously slaine through the malice of his stepmother, that her sonne 
Edred
 or 
Edelred
 might enjoy the Kingdome; who after his bro∣thers death was Crowned King of the land. The yeare 976
 
Eneon
 the sonne of 
Owen
 King of 
Southwales
 destroyed the land of 
Gwyr
 the second time. The yeare ensuing 
Howel
 the sonne of 
Jevaf
 with a great Army both of 
Welsh
 and 
English
 made warre against such as assisted and maintained the cause of his Uncle 
Jago,
 and spoyled the Countries of 
Lhyn
 and 
Kelynno
 Vawr:
 shortly after 
Jago
 was taken by 
Howels
 men, and suffered to enjoy his Part of the land peaceably. About the yeare 979 
Edwal Vachan
 the sonne of 
Edwal Voel
 was
 slaine by his nephew 
Howel.
 At this time 
Custenyn Dhu,
 that is, 
Constantine
 the Black, son to 
Jago
 (who then was prisoner) hired 
Godfryd
 the sonne of 
Haroald
 with his 
Danes,
 against his 
Cousen;
 They both destroyed 
Anglesey
 and 
Lhyn▪ Howel
 hereupon gathering his Army together, and setting upon them at a place called 
Gwayth Hirbarth
 overthrew them, there 
Constantine
 was slaine. About this time, the 
Danes
 landed with 
VII
 ships at 
South-hampton,
 and spoyled the Towne.


{fleur-de-lys} They overcame also and spoyled the whole Country of 
Devon
 and 
Cornwal,
 burned the Towne of 
Bodman,
 and the Cathedrall
 Church of 
S. Petrokes,
 with the Bishops house. Whereupon the Bishops Sea was removed from thence to 
S. Germans,
 where the same continued, untill the removing and uniting thereof unto 
Crediton.


About this time died 
S. Dunstan,
 who prophefied of much mischiefe and great destruction of the Land to ensue by the 
Danes.
 The yeare 981 
Godfryd
 the sonne of 
Haroald
 ga∣thered
 a great Army, and landed in 
Westwales,
 where spoyl∣ing all the land of 
Dyvet,
 with the Church of 
S. Davids,
 he fought the battell of 
Lhanwanoc.
 Likewise in the yeare next ensuing, Duke 
Alfred
 with a great power of 
Englishmen
 spoyled and destroyed 
Brecknock,
 and a great part of the lands of 
Owen
 Prince of 
Southwales,
 against whom 
Eneon
 sonne of the said 
Owen,
 and 
Howel
 King of 
Northwales
 came with all their power, and overthrew them in Battell, where the greatest part of 
Alfreds
 Army was slaine, and the rest put to flight. The yeare following, the Gentlemen of 
Gwents∣land
 rebelled against their Prince, and cruelly slue 
Eneon
 the sonne of 
Owen
 who had come thither to appease them. This 
Eneon
 was a worthy and Noble Gentleman, who did many notable acts in his Fathers time, and left behind him two sonnes, 
Edwyn
 & 
Theodor
 or 
Tewdor Mawr,
 from which last came the 
Kings
 or 
Princes
 of 
Southwales.
 In the yeare 984
 
Howel
 the sonne of 
Jevaf
 King of 
Wales
 entred 
England
 with an Army, where he was fought withall, and slaine valiantly fighting. This 
Howel
 had no sonne, but his Brethren reigned in his stead.


¶ Some say 
Howel
 left a sonne foure years old named 
Co∣nan,
 who afterwards being of age was King of 
Gwyneth
 A. D. 999.

Cadvvalhon the Sonne of JEVAF 
ap
 Edwal Voel.


AFTER the death of 
Howel,
 his brother 
Cad∣walhon
 second sonne of 
Ievaf
 tooke upon him the government of 
Northwales:
 his first businesse was to make warre with his Cousin 
Ionaval
 son of 
Meyric ap Edwal Voel,
 and the right Heire, whom he slue: but 
Edwal, Jonaval'
s youngest brother, escaped out of his hands. The yeare following, 
Meredyth
 the sonne of 
Owen
 King or Prince of 
Southwales,
 with all his power entred 
Northwales,
 and in fight slue 
Cadwalhon
 the sonne of 
Ievaf,
 and 
Meyric
 his brother, and so subdued the land to himselfe. Herein a man may see how God punished the wrong 
Iago
 and 
Ievaf,
 the sons of 
Edwal Voel,
 had done to their eldest brother 
Meyric,
 who was first disinherited, and afterward had his eyes put out by them, and one of his sonnes slaine. First 
Ievaf
 was imprisoned by 
Iago,
 then 
Iago
 with his sonne 
Constantine,
 by 
Howel
 the sonne of 
Ievaf:
 and afterward the said 
Howel,
 with his bre∣thren 
Cadwalhon
 and 
Meyric,
 were slaine and spoiled of all their lands.


¶ Meredyth 
ap
 Owen 
slue
 Meyric 
first; And
 Cadwalhon 
advan∣cing forwards he slue after in another battell;
 Anglesey 
and the rest of
 Gwyneth 
were the purchase of his Victories, which he plagued with insupportable
 Tribute.








Meredyth the Sonne of Owen 
ap
 Howel Dha.


THis 
Meredyth 
ap
 Owen,
 having slain 
Cadwalhon,
 obtained the rule and gouernment of 
Northwales.
 In the yeare 986 
Godfryd
 the sonne of 
Haroald,
 en∣tered
 the Ile of 
Anglesey
 the third time, took 
Lhy∣warch
 the sonne of 
Owen,
 and put out his eyes, He took 2000 prisoners besides. Hereupon 
Meredyth
 the Prince, with the rest, escaped and fled to 
Caerdigan.
 And there was a great murrain also among the cattell throughout all 
Wales.
 Then the 
Danes
 againe entred 
England
 with diverse Armies, and at 
Westport
 and 
Witest
 overthrew the Lords of 
England, Go∣dan
 and 
Britchwould:
 so that the King was compelled to hire the 
Danes
 with the payment of 10000 pounds to live quietly in the Land: and yet within a while after, the king himself
 broke the Peace, For he prepared a great navy to meete the 
Danes
 by sea, where he was ouercome, & lost all his ships, which were taken, with 
Alfricke
 Earle of 
Mercia
 Captaine of the same. After this the 
Danes
 spoiled 
Yorke,
 with 
Lyndsey,
 & went to 
Northumberland,
 where they were put to flight by 
Godwyn
 & 
Fridgist.
 About the same time 
Aulaffe
 & 
Swayn,
 sailing vp the 
Thames,
 with 94. sailes, besieged 
London,
 which was valiantly defended. Wherefore the 
Danes
 left their ships, entered the land, and cruelly with fire and sword
 destroyed all 
Kent, Sussex, Surrey,
 and 
Hampshire.
 Herevpon king 
Edelred
 sent to them for peace, which he purchased with great summes of money and Uictuall; so that they lay peace∣ably at 
Hampton
 that winter. Then 
Aulaffe
 vpon composition came to 
Edelred,
 who receiued him worthily, and did so entertaine him, that he promised to depart the land, and ne∣uer to returne, which Promise he faithfully kept.


The yeare 987. died 
Ievaf
 the sonne of 
Edwal,
 who had



liued many yeares a private life. The same yeare also died 
Owen
 the son of 
Howel Dha,
 Prince of 
Southwales.
 This 
Owen
 had three sons, 
Eneon,
 which died in his Fathers time; 
Lhywarch,
 who lost both his eyes; and 
Meredyth
 who (as is before declared) had wonne 
Northwales,
 and after his Fa∣thers death took also to his possession all 
Southwales,
 having no respect to his brother 
Eneon's
 sons, 
viz. Edwyn
 & 
Theodor
 or 
Tewdor.
 About the same time the 
Danes
 sailed from 
Hampton
 along the coast, spoiling 
Deuonsbire
 & 
Cornwal;
 and so at the last landed in 
Southwales,
 and destroied 
S. Dauids, Lhanbadarn, Lhanrystyd,
 and 
Lhandydoch,
 (which were all places of 
Religion;
) and did so much hurt in the country be∣sides, that to be rid of them, 
Meredyth
 was faine to agree with them, & to giue them a Peny for every man within his Land, which was called 
The tribute of the blacke army.


At this time 
Elwmaen
 the son of 
Abloic
 King of 
Ireland
 was slain, & a great number of people died for hunger. The yeare 989 
Owen
 the son of 
Dyfnwal
 was slaine. Within a
 yeare after 
Meredyth
 King of 
Wales
 destroyed the towne of 
Radnor,
 at what time his nephew 
Edwyn
 the sonne of 
Eneon,
 hauing to his aid Duke 
Adelf,
 and a great army of 
English
 and 
Danes
 spoiled all the land of 
Meredyth in Southwales,
 as 
Caerdigan, Dyvet, Gwyr, Kydweli,
 and 
S. Dauids:
 where 
Edwyn
 took Pledges of the chiefe men of those Countreys. In the meane time this 
Meredyth
 with his people did spoile 
Glamorgan,
 so that no place was free from sword and fire: but at the last 
Meredyth
 and 
Edwyn
 fell to an agreement, & became friends. Soone after 
Cadwalhon
 the onely sonne of 
Meredyth
 died. 
Meredyth
 being thus occupied, had so much to doe in 
Southwales,
 that 
Northwales
 lay open to the enemy: which when the 
Danes
 perceived, they arriued in 
Anglesey,
 up∣on Ascension day, & destroyed the whole Ile. Wherevpon the
 Inhabitants of that 
Country
 received 
Edwal
 the sonne of 
Meyric
 the right heire of 
Northwales,
 for their 
Prince,
 in the yeare 992, the 
Nobility
 delivering both Him & his Brothers
 out of Prison, where 
Meredyth
 had secured them as 
Pledges.
 These great troubles being past, there followed within a year after such famine and scarcity in 
Southwales,
 that many perished for want of food.








Edvval
 ap 
Meyric
 ap 
Edwal Voel
 and 
Meredyth
 ap 
Owen.


THis 
Edwal
 being in possession of 
Northwales
 studi∣ed to keep and defend his people from wrongs. But 
Meredyth
 (the difference between him and his Nephew 
Edwyn
 being composed) gathered to∣gether all his Power, intending to recover 
Northwales
 a∣gaine, And 
Edwal
 meeting him at 
Lhangwm,
 overthrew him there in Battell; Where 
Theodor
 or 
Tewdor Mawr, Mere∣dyth's
 Nephew, was slaine, who left behind him two sonnes, 
Rees
 and 
Rytherch,
 and a Daughter called 
Elen
 wife to 
Ble∣thyn 
ap
 Maenyrch
 Lord of 
Brecon.
 A little after this 
Swayn
 the sonne of 
Haroald
 destroyed the Ile of 
Man:
 and entring
 
Northwales
 slew 
Edwal
 the Prince thereof, who left behind him a sonne called 
Jago.


In the yeare of Christ 998, the 
Danes
 came again to 
S. Davids,
 destroying all before them, and there they slew 
Mor∣geney
 or rather 
Urgeney
 Bishop of that Sea. The same yeare also died 
Meredyth
 the sonne of 
Owen
 King or Prince of 
Wales,
 leaving behind him one only Daughter called 
Angha∣rad,
 which was married to 
Lhewelyn 
ap
 Sitsylht,
 and, after his death, to 
Conuyn Hirdref,
 or (as others think) to 
Conuyn 
ap
 Gwerystan;
 shee had Children by both of them, which was the cause of much Warre and Mischiefe in 
Wales,
 as shall hereafter appeare.


¶ 
A. D. 1000 the
 Danes 
spoyled
 Northwales, 
and the year after dyed
 Môr 
ap
 Gwyn, 
and
 Ivor Porthalarchi.


I am prone to believe, it was not 
Tewdwr Mawr
 but his bro∣ther 
Edwin
 that was slaine in the Battell forementioned, which also seems rather to have been fought at 
Hengwm
 in 
Ardudwy
 in 
Merionethshire
 then at 
Llangwm;
 for there are to this day certain Monuments of Victory to be seen, as heaps of stones, Tomb-stones, & Columnes, which they call 
arnoddi Hengwm.


Edwyn
 the sonne of 
Eneon, Meredyth's
 elder Brother, was the lawfull Heire of 
Southwales
 though dispossessed by 
Meredyth.








Aedan the sonne of BLEGORED.


THe death of both these Princes (for so much as 
Me∣redyth
 had no issue Male, and 
Edwal
 had left be∣hind him a Child under age, not able to take the charge of a Common-wealth) did cause much trouble to ensue: for in 
Northwales
 severall did aspire to the Government, and sought the Rule of the Land, as 
Conan
 the sonne of 
Howel,
 and 
Aedan
 the sonne of 
Blegored,
 who tried the matter in open field, where 
Conan
 was slaine in the yeare
 1003.


{fleur-de-lys} I doe not know, neither could I ever find, what Colour or pretence of Title, this 
Aedan
 ap 
Blegored
 had to the Principality of 
Northwales,
 nor yet of whom he descended, or who came of him: whereas all the other Princes are notoriously known, of what Families they descended, and who came of them. Neither yet doe I read of any 
Blegored,
 whose sonne he might be, except it be that 
Doctor
 of 
Law,
 of whom mention is made in the Laws of 
Howel Dha,
 his Estate may be thought too meane to challenge the Princi∣pality. He is reported to have Governed about XII years. Of the Acts by him atchieved, there is very little written, saving of those two Battels, the one wherein he overcame 
Conan
 ap 
Howel,
 and the other wherein he was overcome himselfe, and slaine with his foure sonnes, by 
Lhewelyn
 ap 
Sitsylht.


In the yeare 1004, 
Gulfath
 and 
Ubiad
 Irish Lords,
 were taken by the 
Scots,
 and their eyes put out, which 
Scots
 did also destroy the Country and Towne of 
Dublyn.
 Likewise the 
Danes,
 who had destroyed againe 
Westwales
 went to 
England,
 spoyling and burning the Land all before


them, especially 
Somersetshire, Dorsetshire,
 and so through 
Hampshire
 and 
Sussex,
 they came towards the River of
 
Thames
 without any Let or Stay, and so sailed along the Ri∣ver to the place, where the River 
Mydwey
 entreth the 
Thames,
 along which they came to 
Rochester,
 where they ouerthrew the 
Kentishmen
 that gave them battell. 
Edelred
 King of 
England
 was at this time in 
Cumberland
 the chiefe Den of the 
Danes,
 which land he brought to his subiection: but in the meane while another army of 
Danes
 fought againe with the men of 
Somersetshire,
 and got the victory, and ruled the countrey at their pleasure. Then 
Edelred
 hearing of the great worthines of 
Richard
 Duke of 
Normandy
 sent to him for his Daughter 
Emma
 in marriage, thinking to have succour thereby: But God intending to punish the great sinnes and enormities of the 
Saxons
 moued the King thereto, that as they being instruments of Gods wrath, vnder colour of friends and hired soldiours, had traiterously slaine the 
Brytaines,
 and driuen them out of their own land, so should the 
Normans
 by colour of this affinity first enter the land as friends, and bring succour against the 
Danes,
 and afterward come as foes, and be the vtter destruction of the 
Saxons
 and 
Angles:
 which was then foreseen and told the King by an 
Anachoret,
 who inspired with the spirit of God, saw the plagues which he had certainly appointed to fall vpon the 
Saxons:
 but the King puffed vp with pride, and hope of this affinity, did priuily write to all the 
English
 Rulers through the realme, to kill the
 
Danes
 in one night, who then liued peaceably; this murther was cruelly executed vpon 
S. Brices
 day at night. But yet the 
Danes
 would not giue ouer so with losse. Therefore the yeare following, there came an army of them to 
Deuonshire,
 and over-ran the land with fire & sword, sparing nothing that had life, that they might revenge the murther of their Cousens. They rased the citie of 
Excester,
 and slue 
Hugh
 the 
Norman,
 whom the Queene had appointed 
Gouernour
 there. Then 
Almarus
 Earle of 
Deuon
 gathered a great army out of 
Hamp∣shire, Wiltshire,
 and all the 
Country
 about, and met the 
Danes:
 but he and his were put to flight, and the 
Danes
 pursued them to 
Wilton,
 and destroyed it and 
Salisbury,
 and returned to their ships with rich spoiles and great triumph.


{fleur-de-lys} Some are of another opinion, who affirme, that the said 
Hugh
 the 
Norman
 enticed and procured the 
Danes
 to come and besiege the City of 
Excester,
 which they burned, and vsed the people with great cruelty, vntill in the end the said 
Almarus
 Earle of 
Deuon,
 and the Gentlemen of the countrey submitted themselues, and so obtained peace.


And the yeare following, being 1004, 
Swayne
 a mighty
 Prince of 
Denmarke,
 to whom God predestinated the Crowne of 
England,
 came with a great number of ships, laid slege to 
Norwich,
 and spoiled it, with whom 
Wol
kettel
 Duke of the
 Country made peace: yet the 
Danes,
 after they had rested a while, went to 
Thetford,
 which they also spoiled, and return∣ed to their ships with their prey, and overthrew Duke 
Wolf∣kettel
 (who had gathered and prepared an army to fight with them) and so sailed to their Countrey: And two yeares after returned againe with their companions, fire, sword and spoile, and landed at 
Sandwich,
 which they burned, and made 
England
 quake as a réed in the wind, and thence sailed to 
Wight,
 where they wintered till Christmas, and then entred 
Hampshire,
 and passed in diverse Bands through the land to 
Reding, Walling∣ford
 and 
Colsey,
 deuouring such victuals as they found in the houses, and paying with sword and fire at their departing. And at their returne they met neare 
Essington
 the army of the
 
Westsaxons,
 which did nothing but trouble them with killing, and laded them with spoile, and so passed by the Gates of 
Winchester,
 with much triumph to 
Wight;
 and all this while was King 
Edelred
 at his Mannour in 
Shropshire
 full of cares and troubles. And then the Nobility of 
England
 bought peace of the 
Danes
 for 30000 pound. In which time of Peace 
Edelred
 made an Order, that of every 300 Hides of land
 through the Realme, there should be a ship made and furni∣shed, and of every 8 Hides, a Corselet and a Helmet. An Hide containeth as much ground as a plough may eare by the year. Besides these the King had a Naby from 
Normandy,
 which being all together at 
Sandwich,
 was one of the greatest that ever was seen in 
Brytain.
 But it happened so, that where
 the King had banished one 
Wilnot
 a Noble man of 
Sussex,
 he fell a roving upon the Sea, and troubled all passages and


Uictuallers. Then 
Brightrych
 brother to the Traitor 
Edric
 Earle of 
Mercia,
 promised the King to bring before him 
Wil∣not
 either alive or dead, but it hapned otherwise, for there fell such a tempest, that he was driven of force to the shore, where many of his ships were lost, and the rest 
Wilnot
 and his Company set on fire and burned. Then 
Brightrych,
 being a∣bashed at this infortunate beginning, returned again along the 
Thames
 to 
London.


Shortly after there landed a Navy of 
Danes
 at 
Sandwich,
 and so passed by land to 
Canterbury,
 with a mind to destroy the City: but the Citizens bought their peace for 30000 pound. And the 
Danes
 passed first through 
Kent, Suffex, Hamp∣shire,
 and 
Barkshire,
 where King 
Edelred
 with all the power of 
England
 met them: notwithstanding being perswaded by the Traitor 
Edric,
 he would not fight with them, so that they returning back by 
London
 (which City defended it selfe manfully) went to their ships. But the yeare following they landed again at 
Ipswich
 upon 
Ascension
 day, and there overcame and put to flight Duke 
Wolfkettel,
 who fought with them. Then passing from thence to 
Cambridge,
 they met the Kings sisters sonne with his Army, whom they slew, and with him Duke 
Oswyn,
 with 
Edwyn
 and 
Wolfrike
 Earles, and after took their way by 
Essex
 towards 
Thames,
 leaving
 no part of cruelty unpractised by the way. And along the Ri∣ver
 side they went to 
Oxford,
 which they had burned the year before, and so to the three castles upon 
Ouze, Buckingham, Bedford
 and 
Huntingdon,
 and destroyed 
Godmanchester,
 which was then a faire Towne, and burned 
Northampton,
 and at Christmas returned to their ships. The next yeare following when they had spoiled all the land from 
Trent
 Southward, they laid siege to the City of 
Canterbury,
 and won it by the treason of one 
Almarike
 (whom 
Alfege
 the Archbishop had de∣libered
 from death) and left nothing behind them, but bloud
 and ashes, carrying the Archbishop with others to their ships, whom they cruelly slew afterward. Within a while after, 
Swayn
 King of 
Denmarke
 came along the 
Humber
 to 
Gainsbourgh,
 to whom 
Vitred
 Duke of 
Northumberland
 with all his people, and all 
Linsey
 with the Countries North of Watlingstreet became subjects, and gave him hostages.


Whereupon 
Swayn
 finding his enterprises succesfull, com∣mitted his Navy to 
Cnute
 his sonne, and went himselfe to 
Oxford
 and 
Winchester,
 which Cities with all the Coun∣tries about acknowledged him for their King. Then he came to 
London,
 where King 
Edelred
 was, but the Citizens defen∣ded the City so manfully and valiantly, that 
Swayn
 returned to 
Wallingford,
 and so to 
Bath,
 and received homage of all 
Westsaxon,
 and afterward coming to 
London,
 received the City to mercy, and was called King throughout the Land. Then 
Edelred
 perceiving all things to goe against him, sled
 to 
Normandy,
 to his Wife and his two sonnes, 
Edward
 and 
Alfred,
 whom he had sent thither before. And 
Swayne,
 after he had brought the whole land to his obedience, dyed suddainly, after whose death, the 
Danes
 chose 
Cnute
 his sonne for their King; but the 
Englishmen
 sent for 
Edelred
 home a∣gaine. who coming with a great Army destroyed 
Lynsey,
 because that Province was become subject to 
Cnute;
 Which thing when 
Cnute
 understood being at 
Ipswich,
 he cut off the hands and noses of all the Pledges that he had, and returned to 
Denmarke.
 About this time, 
Brian
 King of 
Ireland,
 and 
Murcath
 his sonne, and other Kings of that land subject to him, did gather a great Power against 
Sutric
 the sonne of 
A∣bloic
 King of 
Dyuelyn,
 and 
Mailmorda
 King of 
Lagines;
 which 
Sutric
 hired a number of strangers, all armed men, and rovers upon the seas to his succour, and gave 
Brian
 battell, where the sayd 
Brian
 and his sonne were slaine, and on the o∣ther side 
Mailmorda,
 and 
Broderike
 Captain of the strangers. In the yeare 1013, 
Cnute
 came again from 
Denmarke,
 and
 landed in 
Westsex,
 and spoyled all the Country. Then 
Edric
 with 
Edmund
 King 
Edelreds
 bastard sonne, gathered an Ar∣my, but yet they durst not give him Battell. Then went 
Ed∣mund
 to 
Vitred
 Duke of 
Northumberland,
 and together they spoyled 
Staffordshire, Leycestershire,
 and 
Shropshire. Cnute
 likewise, upon the other side, came downe through 
Buckin∣ghamshire, Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire,
 and so by 
Stafford
 passed toward 
Yorke,
 to whom 
Vitred
 came and yeelded him∣selfe, yet he lost his life, whose possessions 
Cnute
 gave to one 
Egricke,
 and made him Duke in his stead, whereupon 
Edmund
 went to his Father, which lay sick at 
London.
 Then 
Cnute



returned to his ships, and sailed to the Thames mouth, and up the River towards 
London:
 but before he came thither, 
Edelred
 was departed, after he had reigned with much trou∣ble and misery 37 years. After whose death, the 
Englishmen
 chose his base sonne 
Edmund,
 surnamed 
Ironside
 for his strength and hardines in War, to be their King. This 
Ed∣mund
 went to 
Westsex,
 and brought all that Country to his subjection. Then the 
Danes
 laid siege to 
London,
 and made a great trench about it, that no man could escape out, and gave
 
Edmund
 battell (who came to raise the siege) at 
Proman
 by 
Gillingham,
 where 
Edmund
 had the vpper hand. The se∣cond
 battell fought at 
Caerstan,
 wherein 
Edric, Almar
 and
 
Algar
 behaved themselves traiterously against 
Edmund,
 where after a long fight the night parted both the Armies. The third battell was at 
London,
 where 
Edmund
 pursued the
 
Danes
 to their ships, and entred the City triumphantly, and two days after they fought the fourth Battell at 
Brenford,
 from whence 
Edmund
 bare the honour away: and went to gather a new Army, whiles 
Cnute
 did besiege 
London
 by Water and Land, but it was manfully defended. Then 
Ed∣mund
 with his Army passed the Thames at 
Brenford,
 and en∣tred into 
Kent,
 and fought the fift Battell, where the 
Danes
 fled as sheep before him, but he staied the pursuit by the wic∣ked
 counsell of the Lraitor 
Edric,
 whom he had received to mercy & made Steward of the Land; this Battel was fought at 
Essedowne
 in 
Essex,
 with the whole power of the 
Danes
 and 
Englishmen,
 there 
Edmund
 shewed his prowes, and for∣saking his place, which was betwixt the Dragon and the
 Standard, he entred the Army of his enemies, breaking their thickest rankes, and compelling the proudest of them to turne their backs. Which when 
Edric
 saw, fearing the overthrow of the 
Danes,
 he cried aloud, 
Fledd Engle, Fledd Engle, Edmund
 is Dead: and thereupon fled with his people, all the Army following him, to the great slaughter of the 
English;
 there were slaine there 
Edmund, Alfric, Godwyn,
 and 
Ul
kettel,
 all
 Dukes, and all the Chevalry of 
England.
 After which victo∣ry, 
Cnute
 entred 
London,
 and was Crowned King of the Land. And 
Edmund
 having gathered his Army together they met in 
Glocestershire,
 but both Armies fearing one the other


were loth to fight, so that they moved the Kings to make an end of this cruell bloudshed by Combat, whereunto both Prin∣ces
 agreed, and the place being appoynted, fought together manfully, and they were both of them found so Ualiant and Worthy men, as few the like. But 
Cnute
 fearing the incom∣parable strength of 
Edmund
 moved him to accord, whereun∣to be agreed: Thereupon Peace was concluded with much joy, that 
Edmund
 should Keigne in 
Westsex,
 and 
Cnute
 in 
Mercia:
 and so they departed, 
Cnute
 to 
London,
 and 
Edmund
 to 
Oxford,
 where he was traiterously murthered by a sonne
 of 
Edric
 with a sharpe knife, as he was at the Privie. 
Edric
 being quickly certifyed of the déed came to 
Cnute
 (with much joy) and gréeted him as only King of 
England,
 declaring how 
Edmund
 was slaine at 
Oxford.
 To whom 
Cnute
 replied, that for his good service be would reward him, as his deserts re∣quired,
 and set him above all the Nobles of 
England:
 There∣upon he caused his Head to be cut off forthwith, and to be set upon a Pole, on the highest Lower in 
London,
 and then he caused execution to be done upon all the other, that were consenting to the murther. In the yeare 1015 
Lhewelyn
 the sonne of 
Sitsylht
 raised a great power against 
Aedan,
 who had by usurpation possessed himselfe of the rule of 
North∣wales,
 and having slaine him with his foure sonnes in bat∣tell (without any respect to 
Jago
 (or 
James
) the sonne of 
Ed∣wal
 the right heire) he took upon himselfe, the name and au∣thority of King of 
Wales.
 This 
Lhewelyn
 was descended from the Kings of 
Wales
 by his Mothers side, whose name was 
 
Trawst,
 Daughter to 
Elise,
 second sonne to 
Anarawd,
 the eldest sonne of 
Roderike
 the 
Great:
 He had to wife 
An∣gharat,
 the only daughter of 
Meredyth
 Prince of 
Southwales,
 and so by these means he claimed and enjoyed the right of both Countries, as hereafter shall be declared.


¶ Elystan Glodrydd 
Prince of
 Ferlix, 
or the Country be∣tween
 Wy 
and
 Severne, 
who is reckoned the 4th Royall Tribe of
 Cambria, 
reigned about this time. Our Writers stile him al∣so Earle of
 Hereford. Athelstan 
King of
 England 
was his God∣father, and gave him his own name at his Baptisme.

 Esq. a Gentleman well seen in the Antiquities of

 was the sonne of 
Arviragus,
 the sonne of 
Cynobelinus,
 and not the son of the Emperour 
Claudius,
 as 
Ieffrey
 of 
Monmouth
 would have it. Our Antiquities say, that the posterity of 
Casnar Wledig
 the sonne of 
Gloyw
 had their habitations on both sides os 
Severne,
 as in 
Powis, Arustli, Ceri, Cydewen, Radnorshire,
 being the Lands and Possessions of 
Ble∣thyn
 ap 
Convyn, Trahayrn
 ap

 So were also

 and the rest of

 with 
Gwerthrynion
 and 
Buellt,
 the Lands of

 Al∣so wee read in the same Author, that

 (commonly called

 gave unto

 the sonne of

 upon his submission some part of his Fathers inheritance, to wit,

AFter that 
Lhewelyn
 the son of 
Sitsylht
 had taken in∣to his hands the gouernment of 
Wales,
 all things prospered: the earth brought forth double to the time before passed, the people prospered in all their affaires, and multiplied wonderfully, the cattell encreased in great number, so that there was neither begger nor poore man from the South to the North sea, but euery man had plenty, euery house a dweller, and euery towne inhabitants. Now in this time 
Cnute
 married 
Emme
 sometimes wife to 
Edelred,
 and mother to 
Alfred
 and 
Edward,
 and sent 
Edmund
 and 
Edward
 the sonnes of 
Edmund Ironside
 to 
Hungary
 to be slaine, but the King of 
Hungary
 cherished them as his own
 children. King 
Cnute
 also levied upon the land a great subsi∣dy of 72000 pounds, besides 11000 pounds, which the Citi∣zens of 
London
 payd. In the yeare 1019 
Meyric
 the sonne
 of 
Arthpoel
 raised a great Army against 
Lhewelyn
 King or Prince of 
Wales,
 who met him in the Field, manfully slue him, and discomfited his people. Also this yeare 
Cnute
 with a great Navy sailed to 
Denmarke,
 and made warre against
 the 
Vandals,
 who had a great Army in the field, which 
Cnute
 overthrew by the prowes of Earle 
Godwyn,
 and the 
English∣men,
 which made him love them the better ever after.


In the yeare 1020, a certain 
Scot
 of low birth came to
 
Southwales,
 who naming himselfe 
Run
 the sonne of 
Meredyth
 their late King, was by the Nobility, which loved not 
Lhew∣elyn,
 exalted to the Regall Throne, and taken for their King; which when 
Lhewelyn
 heard, he gathered his power in



Northwales,
 and advanced towards 
Run,
 who had gotten all the strength of 
Southwales
 together at 
Abergwili,
 where with great pride he abode the coming of 
Lhewelyn.
 But when both Armies were ready to joyne, 
Run
 full of brags and crakes encouraged his people to fight, promising them the vi∣ctory: yet he himselfe (following the Proverb, which biddeth a man to set on his dog, and not to run after him) set on his people to fight it to the uttermost, and withdrew himselfe pri∣vily out of the way: whereas upon the contrary part, 
Lhewe∣lyn,
 like a bold and couragious Prince, came before his peo∣ple, calling for the vile 
Scot
 Run,
 that durst so bely a Princes bloud; so both the Armies joyned Battell with much malice and hatred, the one party was not so couragious to defend the quarrell of so worthy a Prince of their own bloud, as the o∣ther was obstinate in the cause of a stranger: in the end, after great slaughter upon either part, the 
Northwales
 men re∣membring their old victories, and encouraged by the prowes of their 
Prince,
 put their enemies to flight, and pursued 
Run
 so narrowly, that all his 
Scottish
 shifts could not save his life, and so returned home with great spoyle and prey. Then 
Lhewelyn
 ruled all the land quietly, but the year following be was slaine by 
Howel
 and 
Meredyth
 the sonnes of 
Edwyn,
 leaving behind him a sonne named 
Gruffyth 
ap
 Lhewelyn.


¶ It is not recorded in History, of what Stock or Linage 
Lhewelyn
 ap 
Sitsyllt
 Paternally descended, nor have we in a∣ny of our Books his Coat of Armes, or the Coat of his sonne Prince 
Griffith
 ap 
Llewelyn.
 The house and land of the sayd 
Llewelyn
 and his sonne 
Griffith
 being at 
Ruthlan
 (which was a part of that Country 
Anarawd
 gave to the Northerne 
Britons
 of 
Cumbria
 in 
England,
 and 
Stratclwyd
 in 
Scotland
 to inhabite) it is probable they might be descended from one of those No∣ble strangers that seated themselves there; Possibly the interest and Relations 
Sitsylt
 (
Llewelyns
 Father) had in 
Cumberland
 might induce 
Edmund
 King of 
England
 to make use of his as∣sistance, when he marched with an Army against 
Dunmail
 King of 
Cumbria.

 (if he be the Author of the 
Card
 of the Pe∣degree of the Princes of 
Powis
) writes thus, 
Blethyn
 ap 
Convyn
 ap 
Llewelyn
 ap 
Griffith
 ap 
Seissyllt
 ap 
Trahayrn
 ap 
Anarawd
 Prince of 
Powis,
 where he makes 
Trahayrn
 to be the Father of 
Seissyllt,
 which is a grosse mistake, there being herein never a true descent save that 
Blethyu
 was the son of 
Convyn.








Iago the Sonne of 
Edwal
 ap 
Meyric
 ap 
Edwal Voel.


After the death of 
Lhewelyn, Jago
 or 
James
 the son of 
Edwal
 took upon him the rule of 
Northwales
 as right Heire thereof. And 
Rytherch
 the sonne of 
Jestyn
 governed 
Southwales
 by strong hand. 
Cnute
 King of 
England
 about this time made a voyage to
 
Denmarke
 and 
Swethen,
 against 
Ulf
 aud 
Alaf,
 who had stirred up the 
Finlanders
 against him, he had a cruel fight with them, lost a great number of his Army, as well 
Englishmen
 as 
Danes;
 and after his returne to 
England,
 he made his jour∣ney to 
Rome
 in great pompe and glory, not because he
 thought by that journey to be clensed from his sinnes, but that his ambitious mind might have the praise and fame of the World, for his rich gifts and Princely behaviour, and what holinesse be learned there, it appeared at his returne. For forthwith be entred 
Scotland
 with a great Army, a∣gainst 
Malcolme
 the Prince thereof, who desired Peace, and became his Subject, wi
h two other Kings of the 
Orkneys,
 and 
Ewyst, Molbeath
 and 
Je
mare.


About the yeare 1031 the 
Irish-Scots
 entred 
South∣wales,
 by the means of 
Howel
 and 
Meredyth,
 the sonnes of
 
Edwyn 
ap
 Eneon 
ap
 Owen 
ap
 Howel Dha,
 who hired them a∣gainst 
Rytherch 
ap
 Jestyn,
 whom they discomfited and slew, and by that means attained unto the governement of 
South∣wales,
 which they two ruled joyntly, but yet with small quietnesse, for the
 sonnes of 
Rytherch
 gathered a number of such as were their Fathers friends to revenge his death, with whom 
Howel
 and 
Meredyth
 met at 
Hyarthwy,
 and af∣ter a long dispute put them to f
ight. But the yeare follow∣ing, 
Meredyth
 was slaine by the sonnes of 
Conan
 the sonne of 
Sitsylht,
 Brother to the worthy Prince 
Lhewe∣lyn,
 to revenge their Fathers death, whom 
Meredyth
 and


his brother had slaine. The yeare next ensuing, certain 
Eng∣lishmen
 entred the land of 
Gwent,
 with whom 
Caradoc
 the son of 
Rytherch 
ap
 Jestyn
 fought, and was by them slaine. Not long after died 
Cnute
 the most Powerfull and famous
 Prince in the 
West
 Parts of the World, as he that had under his Dominion, the great Country of 
Swethen,
 from 
Germa∣ny
 to the North pole, with 
Norway
 and 
Denmarke,
 and all the Noble Ile of 
Brytaine.
 After him 
Haroald Harfote
 his son begotten upon 
Alwyn
 the Daughter of Duke 
Alselyn,
 was Created King. For 
Hardi Cnute
 his other sonne by 
Em∣ma
 was then in 
Denmarke.
 This 
Haroald
 in the first year of his Reigne banished 
Emma
 his stepmother out of the Realme.


In the yeare 1037 
Gruffyth
 (the son of 
Lhewelyn 
ap
 Sit∣syllt
 sometimes King of 
Wales,
) raised a great number of peo∣ple against 
Jago
 then enjoying the Principality or Kingdome of 
Northwales,
 whom 
Jago
 likewise provided for, as well as he could: but the greater part and the better Souldiers were of 
Gruffyths
 side, for the love they bare to his Father, which afterward well appeared: for after the Armies once met, 
Jago
 was soon overthrown and slaine. This 
Jago
 left behind him a sonne called 
Conan,
 by his Wife 
Avandred
 Daughter 
o 
Gweir
 the sonne of 
Pylh.


¶ A. D. 1022. One 
Ioseph
 was made Bishop of 
Landaff,
 whose
 election was ratified by the aforesaid Prince 
Rytherch,
 who, as we have it in the said book of 
Landaff,
 confirmed also the Lands and Churches belonging to that 
Sea.


In the old 
British
 Text thus we read, Un mlynedd ar ddêg ar ugain a mil oedd oed

 Hence it may seeme, 
Iago
 had but the Isle of 
Môn
 only in his possession, untill the death of 
Rytherch.
 About the year of 
Christ
 1034 
Morgynnith
 a Bishop dyed.








Gruffyth the Sonne of 
Lhewelyn
 ap 
Sitsylht
 and 
Angharat.


GRuffyth 
ap
 Lhewelyn,
 after he had slain 
Jago
 gover∣ned 
Northwales,
 and worthily in all things, fol∣lowing his Fathers steps, who overcame both the 
Danes
 and the 
English
 diverse times, and defended his Country and People manfully all his Reigne. In the first yeare of his Government he fought with the 
English
 and 
Danes
 at 
Crosford
 upon 
Seaverne,
 and put them to flight, and from thence he led his Army to 
Lhanpadarn vawr
 in 
Caerdi∣gan shire,
 and destroyed it utterly, and from thence passed all 
Southwales
 throughout, and received the people to his sub∣jection. For 
Howel 
ap
 Edwyn
 their King fled before his face, and forsook the Land.


{fleur-de-lys} This 
Howel
 procured 
Edwin
 the Brother of 
Leofrike
 Earle
 of 
Chester
 or 
Mercia,
 to come with an Army of 
Englishmen
 and 
Danes
 to his aid against Prince 
Gruffyth,
 who met his enemies in the field, and overcame them, and slue the said 
Edwyn,
 but 
How∣el
 escaped by flight. After which victory 
Gruffyth
 made sundry
 invasions into the 
Marches
 towards 
Hereford,
 and always retur∣ned with great spoyles.


When 
Gruffyth
 had brought all 
Wales
 under his Domini∣on, he returned to 
Northwales
 again. The yeare insuing, 1038 
Herman
 Archbishop of 
Menevia
 or S. 
Davids
 died, a
 man both learned and Godly. The year next following, 
How∣el
 King of 
Southwales
 gathered a great power of his friends and strangers, and entred the Land, intending to recover it againe. Wherefore 
Gruffyth
 like a worthy Prince, came with all speed to succour his people, and meeting with 
Howel
 at Pencadair, after he had encouraged his Souldiers, gave


him Battell, and overthrew him, and pursued him so nar∣rowly, that he took 
Howels
 wife, whom he had brought to the field to see the overthrow of 
Gruffyth,
 but it fell out o∣therwise, and 
Gruffyth
 liked her so well that he kept her for his Concubine.


About this time, 
Haroald
 King of 
England
 dyed, and his brother 
Hardy cnute
 Reigned in his stead, a Noble and a libe∣rall Prince, who (as it is reported) caused his Lables to be
 covered and furnished four times every day, for strangers and all comers, and after he had Reigned two years, he dyed at 
Lambeth
 in the floure of his age. After his death, the 
Eng∣lish
 sent for 
Alfred
 the eldest son of 
Edelred from Normandy,
 but that message pleased not Earle 
Godwyn,
 who was the most potent man in the Land, because he knew the young Prince to be Couragious and stout, and therefore one that would not suffer him to rule the Land as he intended to doe. Therefore he perswaded the People that 
Alfred,
 who had come well accompanied with 
Normans,
 had promised them the whole rule of the Land, thereupon they took all the 
Nor∣mans
 and bound them, and afterward tithed them, putting e∣very tenth man to death. And yet they thought there were two many, wherefore they tithed them the second time, and led 
Alfred
 from 
Gilford
 (where this cruelty was committed) to 
Gillingham,
 and there put out his eyes, and removed him from thence to 
Ely
 where he was pitifully murthered. Af∣terward they sent for 
Edward
 the younger sonne, whom they received as King the year following, after that he had married 
Godwyns
 daughter, He in the first year of his Reign banished Earle 
Swayne,
 sonne to the said Earle 
Godwyn,
 who was received of the Earle of 
Flanders.
 In the yeare 1041 
Howel
 came againe to 
South wales,
 and remained
 there a while: and shortly after a number of strangers landed in 
West wales
 and spoyled the Country, against whom 
Howel
 gathered a number of People, and fought with them, and drove them to their ships with much losle.


At this time 
Conan
 the sonne of 
Jago
 (who had fled to 
Ire∣land
 to save his life) with the power of 
Alfred
 or 
Auloedd
 King of 
Develyn,
 whose daughter 
Ranulph
 or 
Ranull
 he had married, entred 
North wales,
 and by Treason had taken 
Gruf∣fyth



the King, and carried him towards the ships: but when it was known, the Country upon the sudden followed the 
I∣rishmen,
 and overtaking them rescued their Prince, and pur∣sued their enemies (with much slaughter) to their ships, who returned streight with 
Conan
 to 
Ireland.
 The yeare follow∣ing, 
Howel
 the sonne of 
Owen
 Lord of 
Glamorgan
 dyed, being a man full of years. Then 
Howel 
ap
 Edwyn
 called to his succour 
Danes
 and 
Englishmen,
 with all the power he could make in 
South wales.
 Whereof 
Gruffyth
 being certified, ga∣thered his power together in 
North wales,
 and came on cou∣ragiously to meet his enemies, (whom he had twice before discomfited) and overcame them, and chased them, as farre as the spring of the river 
Towy,
 where after a long and dange∣rous battell 
Howel
 was slaine, and his Army discomfited, and so narrowly pursued, that few escaped alive. After his death 
Rytherch
 and 
Rees
 the sons of 
Rytherch 
ap
 Jestyn
 aspiring
 again to the rule and government of 
South wales,
 which their father had once got, gathered a great Army, as well of stran∣gers, as out of 
Gwentland
 and 
Glamorgan,
 and met with 
Gruffyth
 King of 
Wales
,
 who after his accustomed manner loosing no time, but couragiously animating his men with the remembrance of their former fortune and Uictories under his Standard, joyned Battell with his enemies, whom he found disposed to abide, and to regaine the honour which be∣fore they had lost: when they met, the fight was cruel and bloudy, and continued till night, which easily parted both Ar∣mies being weary with fighting, And either fearing other re∣turned to their Countries, to gather more strength. This year 
Joseph
 Bishop of 
Teilo
 or 
Landaf
 dyed at 
Rome.
 The Land being thus quieted, 
Gruffyth
 ruled all 
Wales
 without any trouble: till about two years after, the Gentlemen of 
Ystrad Towy
 did by treason kill 140 of the Princes best Souldiers, to revenge whose death King 
Gruffyth
 destroyed all 
Dyvet
 & 
Ystrad Towy.
 It is also to be noted here, that such snow fell this year, that it lay upon the earth from the Kalends af 
January,
 to the 14 of 
March.
 About this time, 
Lothen
 and 
Hyrling
 landed at 
Sandwich
 with a great number of 
Danes,
 and after they had spoyled the Towne, they returned to their ships, and sailed to 
Flanders,
 and sold their booties, and


so sailed to their Conntry. At this time also Earle 
Swayne
 returned to 
England,
 and came to his Fathers house at 
Pe∣venese,
 and humbly besought his Father, and his Brethren 
Haroald
 and 
Tosty,
 to procure him the Kings Favour. So Earle 
Beorned
 promised to intreat the King for him, and went with 
Swayne
 to his ships, where he was traiterously murthered, and his body left upon the shore, untill his friends, being certifyed of the same, fetched him away, and buried him at 
Winchester,
 where his Uncle King 
Cnute
 had been buried before. 
Swayne
 having committed this wicked fact, sailed againe to 
Flanders,
 and continued there, till his father made peace with the King, and brought him in favour againe about a yeare after.


In the yeare 1050 
Conan
 the sonne of 
Jago
 did gather
 an Army of his friends in 
Ireland,
 minding to recover his inheritance againe, and as he sailed towards 
Wales,
 there a∣rose such a tempest, that it scattered his Navy abroad, and drowned most of his ships, so that he was disappointed of his purpose, and quite lost his labour. Shortly after, 
Robert
 Archbishop of 
Canterbury
 accused Earle 
Godwyn
 and his sonnes, 
Swayne
 and 
Haroald
 of Treason, and the Queene of Adultery, who because they refused to appeare, being called before the King, were banished the Land, and the Queene put away from the King, whereupon 
Godwyn
 with 
Swayne
 fled to 
Flanders,
 and 
Haroald
 to 
Ireland.


{fleur-de-lys} 
Eustace
 Earle of 
Bologne,
 the Father of 
Godfrey,
 having
 marryed 
Goda
 King 
Edwards
 sister, the widow of 
Walter de Maunt,
 came to 
England
 to his brother in Law, and as he was re∣turning home againe one of his servants killed a man at 
Canter∣bury
 (or at 
Dover,
 as 
Matth. Westm.
 hath it) whereof grew great
 inconveniency and slaughter on both sides: whereupon 
Eustace
 re∣turning again, made a grievous complaint to King 
Edward
 a∣gainst the 
Kentishmen,
 whose part Earle 
Godwyn
 took, because they were of his County. But 
Eustace
 by the suggestion of 
Robert
 Archbishop of 
Canterbury
 (who hated 
Godwyn
 and his sonnes)
 so incensed King 
Edward
 against him and the 
Kentishmen,
 that 
Godwyn
 and his sonnes were sent for, to answer the matter before the King at 
Glocester,
 Whereupon 
Godwyn
 fearing the Kings displeasure (who could never brooke him sithence the death of his


brother 
Alfred
) gathered an Army out of 
Kent
 and the Countrys where his sonnes ruled, and so came towards 
Glocester,
 reporting abroad, that all this preparation was made to resist 
Gruffyth
 Prince of 
Wales,
 who (as they affirmed) was ready with an army to invade the Marches. King 
Edward
 being certifyed by the 
Welshmen,
 that there was no such thing in hand, commanded 
Godwyn
 to send backe his army, and to come in person to answer, according to the order of law. Which when he refused to doe, the King by the aduise of Earle 
Leofrike
 appointed a Parliament and meeting at 
London,
 to take order in these matters, Where the King came with a great army out of 
Mercia
 and other 
westerne
 countrys Then 
Godwyn
 remaining with his army in 
Southwerke,
 and perceiuing how that divers of his friends disappointed him, and other daily forsook him and went to the Kings part, despairing to be able to withst and the Kings proceedings against him, conveyed himselfe away priuily with his sonnes, and fled out of the land. Wherevpon King 
Edward
 proclamed him and his sonnes Outlaw
s, confiscated their goods, and gaue their lands to other of his nobility.


Then the King gaue to 
Adonan
 the Earldome of 
Devon∣shire
 and 
Dorsetshire,
 and to 
Algar
 sonne of Earle 
Leofrick
 the earldome of 
Haroald.
 Neuerthelesse 
Godwyn
 and 
Swayne
 got men and ships in 
Flanders,
 and sailed to the Ile of 
Wight,
 which they spoiled, as they also did 
Portland.
 At the same time 
Haroald
 coming from 
Ireland,
 and wafting alongst the shoare, spoiling the country as he went, at length met with his father & brother, who being together burned 
Pevensey, Romney Heath, Folkston, Douer,
 and 
Sandwich,
 & entring the Thames destroyed 
Sheppey,
 & burned the Kings houses at 
Middltowne,
 and afterward sailed vp towards 
London,
 where by the way they met with the King, and so sailed with him, & when they were even ready to fight, an accord was made by means of Bi∣shop 
Stigand,
 in such sort that the King restored them their lands and goods, tooke home the Queene, and banished the Archbishop with all the Frenchmen, which had put that su∣spicion in the Kings head.


{fleur-de-lys} 
Mat. Westm.
 writeth, that about this time, to wit, 
An. 1053.
 Rees
 the brother of 
Gruffyth
 King of 
Wales
 was slaine in a place called 
Bulendune,
 whose head was presented to King 
Edward,
 the
 day before the Epiphany, the King being then at 
Glocester.


A little after that, 
Oswald
 Earle of 
Northumberland,
 when he heard that his sonne was slaine in 
Scotland,
 whither he had sent him with Forces to Conquer it, asked whether his deaths wound was in his brest or in his back; and they saying, in his brest, he answered, I am right glad thereof, for I would not wish me nor my sonne to dye otherwise▪ Then King 
Edward
 entred 
Scotland,
 and overcame the King in Battell, and subdued the whole Land to himselfe. The yeare following, Earle 
Godwyn
 dyed at the Kings table, choaked with a piece of Bread, whose Earledome 
Haroald
 his sonne had, and 
Algar
 Earle of 
Chester
 had the Earledome of 
Haroald.


{fleur-de-lys} About this time 
Makbeth
 King of 
Scotland
 caused a Noble
 man of his (named 
Bancho
) to be cruelly murthered, whereupon 
Fleance
 the sonne of the sayd 
Bancho
 escaping the hands of 
Mak∣beth,
 fled to 
Gruffyth
 ap 
Lhewelyn
 Prince of 
Wales,
 where being
 joyfully received & entertained courteously, he grew into such favor with the sayd Prince, that nothing was thought too good for him. But in processe of time 
Fleance
 forgetting the curtesy to him shewed,
 fell in love with the Princes daughter, and got her with child. Which thing the Prince tooke in so ill part, that he in a rage caused 
Fleance
 to be kild, holding his daughter in most ▪vile estate of servitude, for so suffering her selfe to be defloured by a stranger. At length she was deliuered of a sonne, which was named 
Walter,
 who in few yeares proved a man of great courage and valiancy, in whom from his childhood appeared a certaine noblenes of mind, ready to attempt any great enterprise. This 
Walter
 on a time fell out with one of his companions, who in that heat of contention obje∣cted vnto him, that he was but a bastard, Which reproach so grieved 
Walter,
 that he fell vpon the other, and slew him; wherevpon fear∣ing the punishment of the law, he fled into 
Scotland,
 where he fell into the company of those 
Englishmen
 which were come thither with Queene 
Margaret
 the sister of 
Edgar Edeling,
 amongst whom he shewed himself so discreet and sober in all his demeanor, that he was highly esteemed of all men: and so attaining to higher reputa∣tion and credit, was afterward employed in the affaires of the Common wealth, and at length made Lord Steward of 
Scotland,
 receiuing the Kings revenues of the whole Realme. From which office he and his posterity reteined that surname of 
Steward
 ever


after. The most Noble Kings of 
Scotland
 of the Family of 
Stew∣ards,
 besides many other Dukes, Marquesses, Earles, and Barons of Great Fame and Renowne, descended from him.


Also at this time, 
Siward
 that worthy Earle of 
Northum∣berland,
 being brought to the point of death with the bloudy flux, be wailed his mischance, that he had escaped in many a dangerous Battell, and now should dye such a filthy and cowardly death, and calling his friends and his men about him, commanded them to set him in his chaire, to Arme him at all points, & to put his shield in the left hand, & so he made an end of his worthy life. His Earledome, because his Sonne was within years, was given to 
Tosty Godwyns
 sonne.


In the yeare 1054 
Gruffyth
 the sonne of 
Rytherch 
ap
 Je∣styn,
 did gather a great number, as well strangers as others, against 
Gruffyth 
ap
 Lhewelyn
 King or Prince of 
Wales,
 but commonly called King of 
Northwales:
 who protracting no time, met him, fought with him, and slew him. Shortly af∣ter, 
Algar
 Earle of 
Chester,
 being convicted of Treason a∣gainst
 the King, fled to 
Gruffyth
 King or Prince of 
Wales,
 who gathered his power to revenge the often wrongs, which he had received at the 
Englishmens
 hands, who succoured ever his enemies against him. Therefore he together with
 
Algar
 entred 
Herefordshire,
 and spoyled with fire and sword all the way to the City, whither all the People had fled, and
 they boldly issued forth (Earle 
Randulph
 being their leader) and gave him Battell, which 
Gruffyth
 wished for above any other thing, as He that had wonne five set fields; and coura∣giously receiving his enemies, fought with them. Which fight was long and doubtfull, till such time as 
Gruffyth
 en∣couraged his people with the remembrance of the Prowesse and worthy acts of the ancient 
Brytains
 their Forefathers, say∣ing that they were the same Enemies, whose backs they had so oftentimes seen before: which doubled their strength and force, and so they pressed forwards, that their foes were com∣pelled to forsake the field and trust to their feet, where their hands prevailed not, and thought to have taken the Towne for their defence: But 
Gruffyth
 and his men pursued them so hard, that they entred in with them, & after a great slaugh∣ter


returned home with many worthy Prisoners, great tri∣umph, and rich spoyles, leaving nothing in the Towne, but bloud and ashes, and the walls rased to the ground.


{fleur-de-lys} There be some which affirme, that King 
Edward
 by evill
 counsell (as it is thought) banished 
Algar
 the son of Earle 
Leofrike,
 whereupon he gat him into 
Ireland,
 and there providing 
XVIII
 ships of rovers, returned and joyned himselfe with 
Gruffyth
 King or Prince of 
Wales,
 who both together invaded the Ceuntry of 
Mer∣cia,
 about 
Hereford,
 where 
Ranulph
 Earle of that Country (who
 was sonne to King 
Edwards
 sister named 
Goda,
 by her first hus∣band 
Walter
 de 
Maunt
) came against them with a great Army, and met them about two miles from 
Hereford,
 where after a sore fight by the space of three houres, 
Ranulph
 and his Army were dis∣comfited, and about 500 of them slaine, and the rest put to flight, whom 
Gruffyth
 and 
Algar
 pursued to 
Hereford,
 and entring the Towne, set the Cathedrall Church on fire, and slue the Bishop na∣med 
Leogar,,
 with seven of the Canons, spoiled and burned the Towne miserably. Whereupon, King 
Edward
 being advertised hereof, gathered an Army, & sent 
Haroald
 the son of Earle 
God∣wyn
 against them, who pursuing the enemies to 
Northwales,
 pas∣sed through 
Stradclwyd
 to 
Snowdon:
 but 
Gruffyth
 and 
Algar
 being afraid to meet 
Haroald,
 got them again to 
Southwales,
 whereof 
Haroald
 being advertised, left one part of his Army in 
Northwales,
 to resist the enemies there, and returning with the residue to 
Hereford,
 caused a great Trench to be cast round about the Towne, with a high Rampire strongly fortifying the Gates of the same. After this, by means of a parle had with 
Gruffyth
 and 
Algar,
 at a place called 
Biligelhag,
 a peace was concluded, whereupon 
Algar
 being pardoned by the King, and restored again to his Earledome, returned home to 
Chester.
 About two years af∣ter, 
Algar
 was accused againe of treason, so that he was the se∣cond time exiled the Land, and repaired to his old friend 
Gruf∣fyth
 Prince of 
Northwales,
 by whom he was received joyfully, and restored again to his Earledome by the aid of certain strangers, which came by chance from 
Norway.
 Whereupon King 
Edward
 being sore offended with 
Gruffyth,
 sent 
Haroald
 again with pow∣er to 
Northwales,
 to be revenged upon him, who coming to 
Ruthlan,
 burned the Palace of 
Gruffyth,
 and his ships, and then returned back to the King at 
Glocester.


About this time, 
Edward
 the sonne of 
Edmund Ironfide,
 came to 
England
 with his Wife and Children, 
Edgar Ede∣ling
 (which signifieth in the 
Brytish
 tongue, a young Lord or Prince) and 
Margaret,
 which was afterwards Queene of 
Scots,
 and mother to 
Mawd,
 wife to 
Henry
 the first King of 
England.
 About two years after came 
Roderike,
 sonne to 
Haroald
 King of 
Denmarke,
 with a great Army to 
Wales,
 where being friendly received by King 
Gruffyth,
 and joyning his power to 
Gruffyths,
 entred 
England,
 and cruelly spoyled and burned a great part of the land. But shortly after, 
Ro∣derike
 was compelled to returne to his ships, and to saile to 
Denmarke,
 and 
Gruffyth
 returned home with spoyles.


This yeare, as 
Haroald Godwyns
 sonne would have sailed
 to 
Flanders,
 he was driven by force of a tempest to land in 
Poytiers,
 where he was taken, and conveyed to 
William Ba∣stard,
 Duke of 
Normandy,
 to whom 
Haroald
 declared his journey thither, to be only to offer him service in the affaires of 
England,
 and took a solemne oath, first to marry the Dukes daughter, and after the death of 
Edward
 to reserve the Crowne to the Dukes use. Then shortly after receiving rich gifts, with much honour he returned to 
England.
 This yeare dyed 
Owen
 the sonne of 
Gruffyth ap Rytherch,
 and 
Joseph
 Bishop of 
Menevia.
 Also 
Haroald
 and his brother 
To∣sty,
 by the procurement of 
Caradoc ap Gruffyth ap Rytherch,
 and others, gathered a great power, and entred 
Southwales,
 and subdued a great part thereof, and wrought so with those that were about 
Gruffyth
 the King, that as soon as he had gathered his people in 
Northwales,
 and took his journey to meet with 
Haroald,
 he was cruelly and traiterously slaine by his own men, and his head brought to 
Haroald:
 who appoin∣ted and placed 
Meredyth
 the sonne of 
Owen ap Edwyn,
 Prince and Ruler in 
Southwales,
 and then he and his Bro∣ther 
Tosty
 returned home.


{fleur-de-lys} Some doe report, that 
Haroald,
 about the Rogation weeke by the Kings commandment, went against the 
Welshmen,
 and ta∣king the sea, sailed by 
Bristow,
 round about the coast, compassing in a manner all 
Wales.
 His brother 
Tosty,
 that was Earle of 
Northumberland,
 met him by appointment with an Host of Horsemen, and so joyning together, they destroyed the Country of



Southwales,
 in such sort, that the 
Welshmen
 were compelled to submit themselves to deliver hostages, and engage to pay the anci∣ent Tribute which before they had payd. The people of that Coun∣try, because 
Groffyth
 their Prince fled at the coming of 
Haroald,
 leaving them to be a prey to the enemy, hated him sore, and slue him when he returned to them againe, and sent his head to 
Haroald,
 which he sent to the King. After whose death, King 
Edward
 granted the Principality of 
Northwales
 to
 
Blethyn
 & 
Rywal∣hon
 the sonnes of 
Convyn,
 brethren to 
Gruffyth
 by the Mothers side, who did homage unto him for the same.


This 
Gruffyth ap Lhewelyn
 governed 
Wales
 34 years va∣liantly and Worthily, be never fought but he bare away the victory, he was gentle to his Subjects, and cruell to his foes, loved of the one, and feared of the other: liberall to stran∣gers, costly in apparell, and Princely in all his doings, and unworthy of that cruell death, that the ambitious desire of Rule did provoke his unkind Subjects and unnaturall Cou∣sens, to prepare for so Noble a Prince, and so gentle a Ma∣ster as he was.


¶ In the yeare of our Lord 1061 Prince 
Griffith
 ap 
Llewelyn
 was murthered, and 
Ioseph
 Bishop of 
Menevia
 dyed; but the 
English
 writers say, he was not slaine till A. D. 1064. I have an ancient 
Chronology,
 which sayth that there were from 
Grif∣fiths
 death to 
William
 the Conqueror's coming to 
England
 (which was A. D. 1066) five years, from the 
Conquest
 to the death of 
Blethyn
 ap 
Convyn
 7 years, and from 
Blethyns
 death to the battell in 
Mynydd Carno
 (where 
Trahayrn
 was slain) six years. He left two sons 
Meredith
 and 
Ithel.


A. D. 1053 
Griffini
 Regis 
Australium Walensium, Res
 nomine, propter frequentes pra das quas egit, in loco qui 
Bulendun
 di∣citur jussu Regis 
Edwardi
 occiditur. 
Simeon Dunelmensis
 saith that 
Leofegarius Harold's
 Chaplaine succeeded 
Ethelstan
 in the 
See
 of 
Hereford,
 and that in the very same yeare the XVI of the Calends of 
Iuly
 he was slain by 
Griffith
 King of 
Wales
 at a place called 
Glastbyrig,
 with his Clergy, cum Clericis suis & Vice∣comite 
Agelnotho
 & multis aliis.


Our Author 
Caradoc Lancarvan:
 sayth that 
Ioseph
 Bishop of 
Landaff
 dyed A. D. 1043, but Bishop 
Godwyn
 saith it was three years after, 1046: he dyed in his way to 
Rome
 in the 24 yeare of his Bishoprick, as it is in the Book of 
Landaffe.


About the yeare 1051 
Marbodus evanc
 a Priest of 
Wales
 was made Bishop of 
Redon
 in little 
Britaine. Bal.


Herewald
 who succeeded 
Ioseph
 next in the 
See
 of 
Landaffe,
 was, as Bishop 
Godwyn
 saith, consecrated A. D. 1056 by 
Sti∣gand
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 but the Book of 
Landaffe
 gives another name to the Arch Bishop that Consecrated him, for it is thus recorded therein, 
Confirmata illius consecratio à summo Archiepiscopo
 Cynisi 
& aliis Angliae plurimis Episcopis Canonicè consummata est.
 By (
Cynisi
) must be understood ei∣ther 
Eadsin
 then Arch Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 or else 
Kinsius
 Arch-Bishop of 
Yorke,
 of whom 
Ingulfus
 Abbot of 
Croyland
 writes that he dyed A. D. 1060. As touching the 
Synod
 Bishop 
Godwyn
 saith was held at 
London
 A. D. 1056, 
Chronicon Lan∣dav.
 saith it was held A. D. 1059. The election of 
Herewald
 was confirmed by Prince 
Griffith
 ap 
Llewelyn,
 ab invicto Rege 
Grifido Monarchâ
 Britonum 
praepollente,
 as saith the Book of 
Landaffe,
 wherein we have also set downe this following 
Charter.

Of 
Edwin
 ap 
Grono.


Edwin
 ap 
Grono
 commonly called King of 
Tegaingl
 (which is now part of 
Flintshire
) was one of the 15 Tribes of 
Gwy∣neth.
 His Armes, A. a Crosse ingrailed flowry S. between 4 Cornish Crows proper.




Argento gerit 
Edwinus Tegenius
 atram


Florentemq, Crucem nodosam quatuor inter


Cornices, rostris pariter pedibus{que} cruentis,


Regis 
Griffini Leolini
 tempore vixit.




He lived in the time of 
Griffith ap Llewelyn
 A. D. 1041. He had a sonnne called 
Owen,
 whose daughter 
Angharad
 was wife to 
Griffith ap Conan
 King of 
Gwyneth.
 Many good Families in the Counties of 
Flint, Denbigh,
 and elsewhere are descended from him. The Right Reverend Father in God 
D. William




Roberts
 Lord Bishop of 
Bangor
 (who was Consecrated A. D. 1637. and now living) derives himselfe lineally from him.


Also hee was Auncestor to that Famous Scholar and Lawyer 
Thomas Owen
 one of the Judges of 
England,
 and Father to Sr. 
Roger Owen
 of 
Condover
 neare 
Salop
 Kt. 
Howel Gwyneth
 a valiant Gentleman, who sided with 
Owen Glendor
 against King 
Henry
 the 4th, was of this Tribe: He was one that did for a long time very much hurt and annoy the 
English
 that dwelt in his neighbourhood; (as before him one 
Owen
 ap 
Aldud
 had done, who kept by force of armes under his sub∣jection all 
Tegaingl
 about three years, untill such time as he had obtained his pardon) but at length he was taken by his enemies of the Towne of 
Flint
 and beheaded by them at a place called 
Moelygaer,
 and his Lands were given to one 
Sax∣ton.










Blethyn ap CONVYN & RYWALHON 
his Brother, the sonne also of
 Convyn.


AFter the decease of King or Prince 
Gruffyth, Mere∣dyth
 the sonne of 
Owen ap Edwyn
 (which 
Edwyn,
 as some writers say, was the sonne of 
Howel Dha
) did take upon him the government of 
Southwales,
 and 
Blethyn
 and 
Rywalhon
 the sonnes of 
Convyn,
 and halfe∣brethren to King 
Gruffyth ap Lhewelyn
 (as being also borne of 
Angharat
 daughter to 
Meredyth
 King of 
Wales
) did go∣verne 
Northwales, Conan
 the sonne of 
lago
 being all this time with his Father in Law in 
Ireland.
 About this time it fortuned, that as 
Haroald
 served the King with drink at 
Windsor
 his brother 
Tosty
 moved with envy, that his youn∣ger brother should be preferred before him, pulled him by the
 haire of the head, and overthrew him. Then departing thence, full of rancor and malice, to 
Hereford,
 where 
Haroald
 had prepared great chéere for the King, he s
ue all 
Haroalds
 servants, and cut off their Heads, Armes, Leggs, Noses, Feet, and Hands, and filled all the vessels of Wine, Meath, Beere, and Ale therewith: and sent the King word, that he should want no powdred and s
wsed meats when he came thither; as for other things, he might make provision himselfe. For which hainous offence the King banished him the land for ever.


{fleur-de-lys} 
Caradoc
 ap 
Gruffyth
 ap 
Rytherch
 was the first that pro∣cured 
Haroald
 to come to 
Wales
 against 
Gruffyth ap Lhewelyn,
 h
ping by him to attaine unto the government of 
Southwales.
 But it fell out otherwise, for when 
Haroald
 understood that he should not get that at the hands of 
Caradoc
 which he looked for, which was a certain Lordship within 
Wales
 nigh unto 
Hereford,
 and knowing also 
Caradoc
 to be a subtile and deceitfull man, he compounded with 
Meredyth ap Owen
 for that Lordship, and made
