Brazutus.




Hil.


MAss! thou hast got a luckie hand 
Brazutus,


The 
Septicollis
 now of 
Rome
 is levell'd,


My way made even to St. 
Peters
 chair,


The Popedome mine!






Bra.


God bless your Holiness!


Never had men quicker dispatch to Heaven,


(I Judge Sir) that those seven your predecessors,


Thanks to my luckey starres, and pills! (then which


There can be nothing more Infallible)


(Your Holiness excepted)






Hil.


Here's my hand.






Bra.


Your Toe, good Sir, your Toe's too great a honour.






Hil.


Murder as many as thou canst, 
Brazutus,


(Husband it likewise to thy best advantage,


I know mens Deaths must be thy Livelyhood)


You freely have my Dispensation for it.






Bra.


All thanks, Sir,


My study shall be to deserve it.






Hil.


Harke.


a shout within,


They come, I must retire.




Enter 
Cardinal Victor,
 with a Mitre, other 
Cardinals, Monks Fryers,
 with a mixt company.




Car.


God save the Pope!






All.


Peter
 th' Apostle chooseth 
Hildebrand!


Exeunt, manet Brazutus.




Enter to 
Brazutus, Jocoso.




Jo.


Master! the Kettle-drumms past by just now.






Bra.


Peace foole, those were religious men, call'd 
Fryers.






Joc.


Men! shave they for the scabb? or were half poyson'd?


Pox on the bungler! could his feeble dosse,


But fetch the hair off?






Bra.


No Jests now, 
Jocoso.


Exit Jocoso.


Hasten home, I am with you straight; but first


Will fetch my Patent, to prepare for travel:


I cannot think it safe, abiding here,




So near the Pope, should once his Magick prompt


Him to beleive, some liberal bribes might tempt


Me to ridd him hence (by one slight or other)


(To make all sure) he'd send me packing first.


For all his fair pretenses I confess,


I dare not too much trust his Holyness.








Act.

Scen.

Enter 
Honorio, Prudentio,
 to them 
Junio:




Ho.


How can the Emperour take this 
Prudentio:






Pru.


Pride and Ambition ruines all the world.


Truth, Sir, I fear 'twill breed bad bloud, if not


Timely made up; He's a Prince wise and valiant,


And wont be baulk'd thus of his ancient right.






Ho.


Hildebrand
 reckons all the Roman Empire,


May I not say the the whole fourth Monarchie?


For 
Peter's
 Patrimony, falling now,


To him, whereof he will be sole, supream;


Making the Scepter level to his Mitre.






Pru.


Must none arrive to heaven without his leave,


Nor yet possess the earth in any quiet?


Would he be Metropolitane of both?


I must confess, to men in Sacred Orders,


We owe all love, awful respect and honour;


Yet there are two extreams do ill become


Their cloth 
Honorio,
 Pride and Poverty:


I'de neither have them swell, nor starve to death.






Ho.


Here comes mad 
Junio.




Enter Junio.




Pru.


God save you, Sir!






Jun.


Yours 
Prudentio, Honorio
 I am yours!






Ho.


Junio,
 sweet 
Junio!
 prethee lad, what news?






Jun.


Faith, that which makes me laugh, Sir, The new Pope


(Talking against Massing-Preists Wives already:)


Hath wrought the prettiest different effect:


Some storme, and some are glad on't: The one swears


(Should he nere use bead more) he'l never quit


His pretty Bet
y for an Ave Marie.


h' other complains, Nets Lectures spoil his Sermons.






Pru.


Mad 
Junio
 still. 






Jun.


Troth, I am serious, Sir.








Ho.


Prethee speak






Jun.


I am, and can tell you further,


Th' Arch-bishops Grace of 
Mentz,
 the other day,


Pressing this Order, from his Holiness,


Narrowly scap'd his life.






Ho.


What project's this?


I warrant you 
Prudentio,
 Some cunning


Citizen Miser (to preserve his purse)


(Fearing least his Impropriated Preist


Might Marry, and so leave a parish charge)


Hath put it in his head.






Pru.


With this perswasion.


Most Benefic'd men dying Batchelours,


Would make him Heir, and so enrich his See.






Jun.


I had almost forgot to tell you too:


Those who contrive the thriftiest way to live,


Think Wives, will be as cheap as Concubines.


Cardinal 
Cremensis
 the other day,


(Arguing fiercely 'ganst Priests-Matrimonie)


Was catcht that night bedding a common strumpet.






Pru.


I fear this design will but promote


Lusts more, and secret Murders to conceal 'um.


Restraint oft creates those unruly passions,


Which Freedom, slights.






Jun.


But Gentlemen! before


We part let's clash one pint of Wine together,


I'le give you that shall be most excellent.






Pru.


All thanks kind 
Junio. Ho.
 We'll accept your proffer.






Jun.


With all my heart; now I could hugg you dearly.


Let times go how they will, the Grape-juyce merits


My praises still, for that preserves my spirits.






Pru.


Poetical!






Jun.


Whether or no, you know it:


The very thoughts of Sack will make a Poet.






Ho.


Ha. ha. ha.




Exeunt.

Enter Emperour, Henry, Conrade, Attendants.
 to them 
Otho.




Emp.


It can't be born! Princes are things too holy


For Popes to 
oole: Hath kind fate blest me with




Such conquest o're the 
Saxons,
 and will this


Religious Rebel, now spoyl all at home?


To make a Pope without me, is all one


As to unmake me.






Henry.


Sir, I thought that past


Off!


The reach of mortals, dare they snarch that Crown off,


Which none, but a Divine hand setled on you?






Con.


They had as good seek to unravel Heaven,


And fetch the Diety thence.






Emp.


My Sons talk,


As if descended, from Imperial Loines;


But what wont human Impudence attempt,


Spurr'd with ambition?


Enter Otho.


What meanes this haste?






Otho.


Hildebrand
's Nuntio, is arriv'd, Sir, And—






Emp.


And what, Sends for my Scepter doth he not?


May I nere more ask pardon of my sins!


If this steel doth not make him cry me mercy.






Otho.


And so he doth, Sir, may it please your Highness!






Emp.


He shall know that there was a 
Caesar
 long


Before St. 
Peter,
 or his Successor


Were ever thought on. 
Otho.
 May it please your Highness!






Emp.


The Election of the Pope from 
Constantine


Descended to Me, 
Otho,
 Reckon that.






Otho.


'Tis now Seven Hundred years agon, and upwards.






Emp.


Nor shall this 
ome-Usurper stand a day,


Can I but once reach Italie.






Otho.


Please you —


Sir, Hear me, 
Hildebrand
 is sorry.






Emp.


How?






Hen.


For that he cannot, Sir, play 
Prester John.


Be Prince and Prelate too.






Emp,


Grant he were so,


Could it be thought these twins of government,


Might ever wrangle in the self-same breast


For the Supremacy; It would be found,


(I lay my life on't) that St. 
Peters
 Chair


Must owe it self upheld by 
Caesars
 Throne.






Otho.


Sir,—






Con.


No Bull like the roaring Cannon, No




Anathama like a good Sword and Pistol.






Otho.


I see I am still disturb'd.






Emp.


Go on, 
Otho.






Otho.


For ought we hear, Sir, 
Hildibrand
 is sorry,


The lawless rout of common people should


Cry him up Pope: which Title he protests


He ne're will own, Sir, without your Election.






Hen.


I hate this flattering.






Con.


It takes too much.




aside.




Otho.


Till when he hath refus'd Inauguration.






Emp.


Now thou saist somewhat.






Otho.


For this very purpose,


Comes th'Embassie.






Emp.


This is some satisfaction.


Receive 'um, we will give 'um some Audience.




Exit Otho.




Hen.


Were it not fit 
Hildebrand
 should have made


Most Royal, Sir, a Personal submission?






Con.


Proxy humilitie seems but presumption.






Emp.


I see Youth's rash and inconsiderate,


It was the giddie factious multitude,


Not he (my Boyes) intruded on my right.






Hen.


Con.
 Sir, we submit.






Emp.


Haste then without delay,


To grace the Entertainment.






Both.


We obey.




Exeunt.

Enter 
Rodolphus, Magnus, Frederick
 in Prison.




Fred.


And is the Emperours promise come to this?


Is this his Liberty?






Mag.


A Princes word


I took to be, as true as Heaven it self.






Ro.


For this I'le n'ere believe a Conquest more,


But what shall meet me over eares in bloud.






Mag.


'Twas not we feared death as to be thought


Foolishly lavish of our lives: to fight


For that liberty, we might have with peace.






Ro.


Would we had dyed before we yeilded.






Fred.


Hark! They sing and dring within.








A Song.


Here's to that Noble Soul;


Drowns his sins in a Bowl;


And cares not a fig for the Pope.


Here's to him a full Glasss,


That counts him an Asse,


Who will stinch at the sight of the Rope.






All within.


Ho Boyes!






First.


A merry life and a short.






2.


About with it.






3.


Where lyes the fault?






1.


Roger
 'tis your liquor.






Ro.


O plague, I drank the very last but one,


Ralph
 wants it.




They sing agen.




Fred.


O Brave Roarers! They know no other prayers.


These are their Mattins, and their Evening Songs.






Ro.


Is there such mirth in death?






Mag.


Or are they rather


Glad that the friendly Halter shortly will


Free them from Goal, which I count worse then death.


VVhat man that hath that Noble thing call'd Soul


But hates confinement? This whole world would be


To narrow for him, were he alwaies tied to'r.






Fred.


But these poor souls are hardned in their Irons.






Ro.


I was in hopes that breach like to have bin


Betwixt the Emperour and the Pope of late,


Would have made our way out






Fred.


But that's all dash't.






Ro.


Could not our old friend (
Otho
 having got


Into such favour) do us here a kindness?






Mag.


We are but here kept like 
West-Indian
 captives,


To be devoured at some solemn meeting,


With Mirth and Jollitie; endure't who list


Let our wits work our freedom






Ro. Fred.


We'l all assist.

Enter 
Aurelia, Silvia,
 to them 
Sophrona, Matilda, Attendants.




Au.


May not one guesse affection by a glance?






Syl.


Madam!






Au.


'Twas but one look, and that look did it.


Those lights like 
Archimedes
 burning-glasse




Set me on Fire at that distance from him.






Syl.


Your meaning, Madam.






Aur.


Sylvia,
 thou art dull,


I see, for hadst thou any sence at all,


How couldst thou choose but feel the self-same heat?






Syl.


Explain your self, pray Madam.






Aur.


Then I will.


I'me conquer'd by my Fathers Captive.






Syl.


Which?






Aur.


Now I could chide thee for a silly Gitle:


Dost ask me which?






Syl.


Otho
's fair, 
Frederick
 smiling.






Aur.


I see my errour. Love is such a madness;


What we love, we'd have all love; and yet can't


Endure a Rival: Didst not mind him 
Sylvia


With the Majestick countenance? My love


Is not Effeminate, although a Womans.






Syl.


Bold Magnus!






 Aur.


Magnus!






Syl.


In your cheeks I read it,


That blush betraies you; He is—






Aur.


Hush the Empress.




Enter 
Empress, Matilda,
 Attendants.




Soph.


Aurelia!
 Why were you wanting at


The sport but now?






Aur.


Madam I was just comming.






Mat.


'Twas excellent, I love to see men active.






Soph.


They're gon to visit now the 
Saxon
 Captives,


Nothing that's tending to your Fathers glory,


Must be concealed from these noble strangers.






Aur.


Must 
Magnus
 make them sport?






Syl.


Pray Madam!




weeps aside.




Soph.


What saith 
Aurelia?
 What's that 
Sylvia?






Syl.


She's sorry, Madam, she should loose the sport.






Soph.


I thought 'twould trouble her, there's more behind,






Mat.


But Madam, shall we never visit 
Rome?






Sop.


We may perchance, 
Matilda,
 danger it


Now there is made this happy reconcilement.






Mat.


I long to see his Holyness, methinks


I fancy most those by Religion ty'd


From lust and wedlock; am (you must concieve)


A chast Platonick Lover.






Aur.


What is that?


To Love, to love, and not to enjoy?






Mat.


Fruition


Doth but allay those hightned flames, which are


The very life of love.








Aur.


I am but raw,


(Yet give me leave) you seem, as if 
Matilda


You own'd no Paradise to scorching 
Aetna.


Platonick loves, (like Purgatorian sires)


Doe but prepare us for a perfect blisse,


And make us worthy of a free possession.






Soph.


Aurelia,
 have a care my Girle, I fear


By your Romantick tongue, you may be smitten.






Aur.


If my discourse offend (my Royal Mother)


May I be ever silent rather then


Provoke your hand.






Mat.


You do mistake the Empress.






Soph.


No matter, keep her still in Ignorance.






Mat.


Ours is but talk, Madam, you'l pardon it.






Soph.


It is Ingenious, I gladly could


Hear more on't: but I dare believe by this


They are return'd. 'Tis high time to be gon,


We must be all there: This night puts anen'd


To the Solemnity.






All.


We shall attend.




Finis Act. Primi.










Act. II. Scen. I.


Enter 
Pope, Card. Victor,
 other 
Cardinals,
 Attendants. The 
Pope
 ascends his Chair.




Ʋict.


God save Pope 
Gregory
 the Seventh! 
All.
 Long live!






1. 
Card.


Caesar
 confirmes it!






Pope.


Who's that mentions 
Caesar?


For Policie I did complie a while,


It was but to procure the surer ground,


To give the Emperour the stronger blow.


Must 
Peter
 stoop to 
Caesar?






2 
Card.


That rests fully,


Sir,
 in your Holiness to remedy.






Po.


My Keys already look and unlock Heaven,


And if they wont fit, I will add a ward


Wherewith they shall serve Earthly Kingdoms,


To make and unmake Princes at my pleasure.






Vict.


Nobly Resolv'd, 
Sir,
 This will grace your See,


With the more awe and splendour.






2. 
Car.


And restore


Rome to itsformer fame, that it shall be


Once more the worlds renown'd Metropolis.








1. 
Card.


Henry
's accus'd—






Pope.


I may as well ask him


Forgivness of my sins, as to be Pope.






1. 
Card.


He needeth pardon, Sir, or punishment,


Who is so loudly tax'd for a truce-breaker.






2. 
Card.


The 
Saxons
 gladly would help to depose him.






1. 
Card.


A Tyrant.






Vict.


Cruel, Symoniacal,


A buisie Bodger of Church-livings, Sir.






Pope.


I hear enough: makes him uncapable,


starts up.


Both of Heavens mercy, and of mans protection.


Let him be Excommunicated! lesse


Cannot be done to him, doth so transgresse.

Enter 
Brazutus
 to him 
Jocoso.




Bra.


All things succeed as well as heart could wish.




Enter 
Jocoso
 telling Money,




Joc.


So, this is somewhat towards my Journey now.






Bra.


What hast thou there 
Jocoso?






Joc.


Nothing Sir,


But a peice for killing an good old woman,


That did so lave the house still with her nose


As she swept it.






Bra.


Didst it accurately.






Joc.


To a hair, Sir, no Juggler ever playd


Legerdemaine neater, then I shook that same


Into her Hallow tooth.






Bra.


And is she dead?






Joc.


Dead, and at heaven I hope. Her son was mad


For haste to bury her the 
Rushian
 fashion,


With Hose and Shoes, she was so troublesome


To the chymney-corner (he said) and liv'd


So unmercifully, to keep that little


She had from him.






Bra.


'Twas he then gave the peice.






Joc.


It was, and to say truth, I well deserv'd it.


It did so plague me Sir, to hatch a cry,


And pray an hours nonsence by the clock.


I must not touch her, if I touch'd abook.






Bra.


I warrant 'twas one of those good women


That us'd to fetch an ill contrived sigh


At Church, in the wrong place; (not hearing well)






Joc.


She was, all said, hugely well given Sir,








Bra.


And so art thou, nay if thou canst 
Jocoso


Fanatick-like, murder with prayers and teares,


N'ere fear a livelyhood 
Joc.
 and when thy 
orks done,


My Fee will make me a Thanks-giving day.






Bra.


All such odd jobs I give thee.






Joc.


I thank you Sir.






Bra.


Come hasten, fetch our things, we must be gon.






Bra.


Now the Popes Licence without peradventure


Will be excepted from the Emperour


Exit Joc.


To gain me leave, (since they are both agreed)


To practice near his Court: My man may play


At lower stakes, and kill men for a trisle:


But where I venture Soul, Life and Estate,


It shall, believe me, cost a saucie rate.

Enter 
Prudentio, Honorio, Junio.




Jun.


What! we are likely to be all to peices


Agen, 
Honorio,
 with the 
Emperour.






Ho.


So the newes goes, and the Popes Arrogance


Hath rais'd a civil warre amongst the Clergy.






Jun.


I am resolv'd I'le be of no religion


Till all agree.






Pru.


I must confess these failings


Shew they'r but men, but what they'd have us learn,


Is of an higher and diviner nature,


In that themselves so hardly practice it.






Ho.


I cannot blame the German Bishops


To stand for their custome and prerogative.


Is there no Patriarchal seat but Rome?






Jun.


I'me apt to think they shortly will determine


No Baptiz'd Infant, shall be call'd a Christian


Except his Name be 
Peter.






Ho.


Can there be


Nothing decreed without the Pope 
Prudentio?


Ought he, and only he, command a Council,


How, where, and when, he please?






Pru.


This is in Truth,


Novel Encroachment, and he's like to smart for't,


Should the Prelates now joyn with th' Emperour.






Jun.


Would they were at it once.






Ho.


Will you engage?








Jun.


There's nothing better, Boy, then Wars or Women,


To tame this Fact, and I abhor a Mistress.






Ho.


The better Warriour.






Jun.


Those desperate Dam-hims


Who for a while may force the fare of Valour.


To stand a prick or two in vindicating


Their Ladyes naughty title to her Honour,


(To gain some Commendation, or a kindness)


Can never serve their Country worth a rush.






Pru.


Why now I like you: Gentlemen, your Hands,


You'l side with me.






Both.


May we else never speed:




Exeunt.




Pru.


Resolve then for the Emperour.






Both.


Agreed.

All thanks kind Princess: Madam you are noble:


Your Presence is a freedome.

Such Calmes and Tempests in the self-same breath


Am I offensive?

You have mov'd him Madam.

 Silvia,

Here is a Weapon, if you must dispatch me.






Aur.


He still misaprenends me 
Sylvia,


And how undauntedly he talks of death!


Dear 
Magnus!
 sheath, the Prison that I talkt of


Was nothing else but loves ensnarement.






Mag.


Now,


You surfet me with joy, tell't by peice-meales.






Aur.


My Fathers purpose is to set you free.






Magnus


I owe it you.






Syl.


Heaven bless these meeting flames.






Aur.


Some German Princes lately proving Rebels,


Joyn with the 
Saxons
 now agen in Armes.








Syl.


You Noble 
Magnus
 must be one of us.






Aur.


Swear Loyaltie t'assist the Emperour.


Thy Valour's know.






Mag.


If I must take this oath,


I'le go and bid the 
Saxons,
 fight and help 'um;


And then return and willingly submit


To that just death my perjury deserves.


I'le prove as false to you, as to my Country.




Exit.




Syl.


Sir you'r unhandsome to your Princess.






Aur.


Peace.






Sylvia,


what was't he said? He'd prove as fals


To me as to his Country, was't not so?


This is no slighting but doth argue rather


That strong and holy zeal he hath for both.


I like him better for this Resolution,


His Constancy to me and that together


Must sind a way He may be fals to neither.




Exeunt.

Emperour, Sophrona, Matilda, Henry, Conrade, Otho.
 Attendants.




Emp.


Were't not for these Apostatizing 
Germans


The Pope should feel by sad Experience,


No curse so heavy, as a Princes anger.






Otho.


These Rebels must be look'd to timely Sir,






Emp.


I first must make my peace with Rome; or else


His Holyness will have in every Corner,


Blind zealots, that will strive by murdering me


To merit Heaven:






Soph.


Can man be thought so stupid?






Mat.


O Madam! Ignorance leads to all mischeif.


This makes some bid good marrow to a Snaile,


Or Serpent, and Adore 'um for that day;


The Vulgar learn Rebellion still without book,


Which the Pope shuts and bids 'um read their Lessons


In his commands, which needs must be (he saith)


Alwaies Infallible.






Emp.


I see 
Matilda,


Thou art Ingenious, and talkst handsomly.


(
ogether with the Empress) I have thought on


Employment for you.






Sop.


May we serve you Sir.






Mat.


Thus 
 I beg this Houour.








Emp.


Rise, 'tis granted.


Hast courage thinkst, to face his Holyness?






Sop.


Thou'rt like now to enjoy thy wish 
Matilda.






Emp.


You see, my Boyes, Princes are somtimes made


The Tennis-balls of Fortune, to be bandy'd


At her unconstant pleasure; now full fraught


With good success, soon after wrackt with crosses.






Hen.


Sir! we are rash and inconsiderate.






Con.


He first usurp'd the Mitre, then ask'd leave.






Emp.


My Children blame me 
Otho,
 that I did not


Tread upon 
Hildebrands
 submissive neck.






Otho.


You were more Noble, Sir, and Mercyful,


Who could have thought on such Hypocrisy?






Emp.


We must not now spend all our time in talk,


Aurelia
 is to tender for this Journey.


Henry,
 and 
Conrade,
 you'r iuclin'd to travel.






Hen.


We must Sir, if it be your Royal pleasure.

Who make their meals either with Mear, or Drink,


Not both together, our trade won't maintain it.

As I did formerly, to gain some custome.

At night throw off their Perewigs, and their Noses.


Pull out their Teeth, and lay aside their Eies.

But this to gain

A free and valid passage to my suit.

Yet it is nothing but Dissimulation.

And how 'twas only fix'd on him?

One point of Wine, to chear thee, these sad times.

A curse upon this Primogeniture!

But that a woman may be fit to govern,


Or why do Poets talk of

Place pow'r and wisdom in the Female Gender?

Must be a Complication of Traytors.

With Pardons in their Pockets, and hopes of


Immediate access into Paradise:


With a fair promise to be Canoniz'd.

And then Men run on in their villainies


As eagerly as e're the Pope run from us.


Pox on him! now the warrs are done, and now


We may make Mustard with our Cannon-bullets,


And stick our Swords up to hang Scare-crows on.

For a mean Fee; I might have starv'd else, Sir.


Your mercy, Sir, your mercy!

Horrid Villain!

EPIGOLUE.




I am to tell you
 (Gentlemen!) 
The Play


Caesar
's sad Tragoedie, you saw to day.


Should any
 Momus 
crie, it can't be true.


A man
 Religious, 
and a
 Rebel, 
too.


Carp at the Title first, and next the Plot,


And then the Sence, the Language, and what not!


Condemn this Poyson, this Lust, and that Treason,


And sware, our
 Pilgrim-Prince 
can't stand to reason;


(But as a Vulgar Errour straight must be


Damn'd with the
 Belisarian 
Povertie.
)


Our
 Poet 
doth confess, and 'tis His glory,


He plaid the Theif, he saith, and stole the story


From men of Trust, who write, the thing was so,


Acted about Six Hundred years agoe.


But yet all this won't do He understands,


Nothing will pass for good, without your Hands.


For which great favour, (she who did express


Her self so handsome to his Holiness.)


—
Witty
 Matilda 
pleads; and 'tis hard hap,


If such a freindly Girle don't get a clap.
