THE Author's Preface.


THE World is so earnest af∣ter the Even
s of the Pre∣sent War, that it has hard∣ly Leisure enough to read the several Accounts which are continually print∣ed on that Subject: And this takes up all our Thoughts so much, that we have scarce Time to reflect on past Transactions. I must confess, we have Reason enough for this; for what is past cannot effect us much, because it can neither add to our Misery, nor better our Condition.


But, the War, wherein 
Europe
 is now engag'd, is of so great a Con∣sequence, that, according to the Turn of Affairs, every one must have their Hopes or Fears, either to expect a Happy Change in their Fortunes, or to dread the contrary. Yet tho' we

 now seem wholly taken up with the present, there are, however, some Histories of former Times capable to excite the Curiosity of the Publick, because what is past may enable us to argue on what's to come, and to draw Consequences accordingly.


The following History, of 
Van Tromp,
 is of this kind; and what the States have perform'd under the Conduct of that 
Great Man,
 and sometimes, by themselves, and against Two formidable Pow∣ers; we may reasonably conclude, that now, since the said States and 
England
 are united, nothing can be able to oppose them at Sea, provided they will be but unanimous and act in Consort:


The manner of the Deliverance of the 
United Provinces
 in 
1672.
 from the Slavery wherewith they were threatned, next to the Favour and As∣sistance of Heaven, through the wise Conduct and Valour of the Prince of 
Orange,
 now King of 
England,
 and

 by the Victories which the Admirals of this State have obtain'd over both the Fleets of 
France
 and 
England,
 then joyn'd together, gives us very good Reason, likewise, to conclude; that there is nothing we may not at this Day expect from these two Potent States, since they have both put them∣selves under the Conduct of that Prince, who commands their Armies conjunctly, and since their Naval Forces are united against the 
Com∣mon Enemy.


We are therefore persuaded, that this Work will not now be unseason∣able, but will have the good Fortune to be well received by the variety of Events, of which we have hitherto had but a very imperfect Account; be∣cause that few Historians have made it their Business to treat at large of Matters relating to the Sea. Here∣in you will find exact Relations of many bloody Engagements perform'd in most Seas, and which have been

 often follow'd by Descents on the Territories of those that have had the wors
 of it. Herein you will see, how Victory has been disputed between the most powerful, as well as most numerous Fleets, and the greatest Admirals that ever fought on the O∣cean. In a Word, you will have a full Account of what 
England
 and the 
Provinces
 have hitherto been capable of executing at Sea, and when they have been the single Combatants.


But we will leave the Reader his full Liberty to make what Reflections he shall think fit, and content our selves with the Performance of a Faithful Historian, by giving you a plain Relation of Matters of most Importance in the Times we shall mention, and particularly of what concerns the Great 
Cornelius Van Tromp,
 whose Life we here present you. We have also been oblig'd, by the bye, to touch a little upon the most remarkable Actions of the Famous

 
Martin Van Tromp,
 and several other Admirals, whose Memories will always be dear to 
Holland,
 on the Account of the great Reputation they acquir'd, as well as for their Zeal shewn for the Service of their Coun∣try.


It will also be necessary to acquaint you, That we have not been able (to preserve both the History contain'd, and the Succession of Years entire) to avoid relating several Events, which seem to have but an indirect Tenden∣cy to 
Cornelius Van Tromp
's Life, because we would fill up the 
Chasms
 wherein he was not employ'd, nor commanded the Naval Forces of this State in chief, or else was in the Ser∣vice of the King of 
Denmark.


And, to make the History the more acceptable by Variety, we have in∣serted the Epitaphs of most of the Hero's of this Republic, whose Names we had occasion to Mention, as so many Monuments, which contain the

 most important Actions of their Lives, and which are not to be found else∣where; whereby the Care which the 
United Provinces
 have taken to re∣ward their Merit, and make their Glorious Memory Immortal, will be sufficiently evident.


We have also added the most con∣siderable Letters which the several Admirals have written, as so many eminent Proofs to authenticate the Actions we relate, and which will shew, that we have made this our in∣violable Rule and Standard, Not to write any thing with Flattery or Fal∣shood, but to give a Body of Truth to this Work.












THE LIFE OF 
Cornelius Tromp,
 Lieutenant Admiral of 
Holland
 and of 
West-Friseland.
 The First BOOK.


THERE is no Flourishing State in the World but must acknowledge it self to be supported chiefly by two main firm and solid Pillars: I mean,
 Wise Ministers of State, and Great and Ex∣perienc'd Commanders, who Constitute the Prima∣ry Cause of it's Grandure and Exaltation. The former of these by their admirable Skill form out into Regular designs in the Councel Chamber those Secret Maxims that Policy Dictates to every Na∣tion as the most adapted to their peculiar Genius and condition, whereby they may best Govern them∣selves,

 grow powerfull and become formidable to their Neighbours; and the others are those Hero's that in order to put in Execution what was Re∣solved in the Cabal of State couragiously lead on the Armies, fight the Enemies, and gloriously ob∣tain Victories: all which duly considered, what honours ought not to be rendred to the Memory of those great men after their Deaths? Certainly it is not only just to give them in some sort a new life by the Recital of their noble Exploits, but it is likewise of great use to others, to render them Recommendable to Prosterity by a History of their worthy Actions, since 'tis the surest and most Ex∣peditious means to move those who read it to a like Course of Vertue, and to excite them to fol∣low the Steps of those Illustrious Hero's that have generously Sacrificed their own private repose, and spilt their best Blood for the Glory of their Coun∣try. 'Twas upon this consideration that the Greeks and Romans, not to speak of the Nations that pre∣ceeded them, took such great care to commit to writing the lives of their Brave men, and were so accurate to Paint them out to us in such lively and natural Colours, that even to this day, at that vast distance whenever we Read their story, we are apt to fancy, we see themselves before our Eyes. But if those two Renowned Nations took such a Religious care to consecrate the Memory of their great Captains to Immortality, what ought not 
Holland
 to do, to Immortalize that of its Famous Admirals? If ever there were any State that has made a noise in the World, and made it self formidable by Sea, is it not this powerfull Re∣publick which has done more in this respect, than all other States put together besides? It would be but needless here to repeat the History of it's first rise, and of it's progresses since, and to enter into so long and particular a Narration as that would require, to prove a truth so generally ac∣knowledged. Neither as to the History of our Ad∣mirals,

 is our Age the first that has employed it's writers upon so noble a Subject, our Ancestors have led the way, and set us worthy Patterns how to acquit our selves of this Just duty. And ac∣cordingly emboldened by their Example I venture to Compose the History of one of those Hero's, who without tarnishing the glory of the others may be said to have been one of the greatest and most Renowned Commanders that ever appeared on the Ocean, a Hero whose very name was a terror to his Enemies; That was descended of a Father who had been present in above Fifty Sea Battles in which he either Commanded in chief, or had at least one of the principal Posts of Au∣thority, whose good Conduct and undaunted cou∣rage had much contributed to make 
Holland
 one of the Richest and most flourishing States of 
Eu∣rope;
 and who at last after gaining so many Tri∣umphs and Victories, died with Sword in hand for the advantage of his Country; a Hero, in fine, that alway followed the glorious foot steps of his Illustrious Father, who was as much beloved by his own Sea-men and people, as he was dread∣ed by his Enemies, and who in a supreme degree possest all the vertues of a great and accomplish'd Captain.


We shall say nothing of the first years of the life of 
Cornelius Tromp,
 whose History we design here to write, because there usually happens nothing to men in that time of infancy that much concerns or is much worth the Curiosity of the publick.


It will be enough only to remark to you that having been as 'twere wholly nourish'd and brought up at Sea from his most tender youth, scarcely was he arrived to a Capacity of Commanding but he was made Captain of a Ship which imployment he discharged with so much Courage and Ability that gave the World a certain prognostick, he was destinated to exercise those of greater importance.




One of the first occasions in which he was im∣ployed, and of which doubtless a particular Re∣lation will be acceptable, was in the War the States were obliged to make against the Corsairs of 
Bar∣bary.
 For those Pyrates taking daily a great Number of 
Dutch
 Merchant-Ships, bound either to 
Spain,
 or for divers other ports in the 
Medi∣terranean;
 the States at length tired out and vext with so many losses, gave order to 
John de Ga∣len,
 Famous for his brave Actions, to Joyn him∣self to the Commander 
de Wilde,
 and to the Capt. 
Tromp,
 and 
Van Velsen,
 to go before 
Sally,
 and to Block up that Port by Sea, in order by that means, to put a stop to the Course of it's Pira∣cies.


He had orders to Convoy by the way, as far as 
Ca∣diz,
 all Merchant-Ships going into 
France
 or 
Por∣tugal,
 and to steer away from thence towards 
Sal∣ly.
 Accordingly Setting sail and being come in∣to those Seas, he was inform'd by Captain 
Ʋries
 who was Cruising there, that no Corsair had yet appeared in those parts, because those 
Barbarians
 were at 
Intestine
 Jars about the Government, and that they of the old Town had taken up arms against those of the new; but that notwithstanding the differences among themselves, they were unanimously inclined to hearken to a Treaty of Peace when∣ever it should be offered to them by the States General, because they stood in much fear of their power. And in effect, 
de Galen
 was no sooner ar∣rived thither, but a Negotiation was presently en∣tred into to draw up the Conditions of the Trea∣ty.


In order to which, it was first agreed upon, that as soon as the 
Moors
 should have put up a White Flag in the Fort, 
de Galen
 should put up the like upon his Main-Mast-Top, for a Signal that the Deputies of 
Sally,
 might safely come on Board the Admiral. At which Signal accordingly four 
Moorish
 Deputies came thither, whom 
de Galen
 received

 in the Captains State-Room, with great Civility. He that was the principal amongst them, said that the Princes both of Old and New 
Sally,
 had ex∣pected with great impatience the arrival of the 
Holland
 Fleet, in hopes of coming to a Treaty of Peace with them, to which they were entirely dis∣posed, and so much the more upon Consideration, that they had formerly lived in good Correspondence with them before they had thrown off the Yoke of those of 
Morocco;
 for that it was surprizingly strange, they should whilst they were yet slaves, have preserved Peace with a free Nation as were the 
Dutch,
 and that now since they were come out of Slavery into Liberty, they should fall out with the same people, but that the cause of all those unhappy Hostilities that had happened since be∣tween them, were to be attributed to some of their Chiefs; and that, in a word, they Ear∣nestly desired, that such Reasonable Conditions might be proposed, that might be the foundation of a lasting Accommodation; to satisfy which desire of theirs, our Admiral proposed to them the fol∣lowing Articles, 
viz.


1. 
That all Christian slaves of what Nation so∣ever that had been taken on Board any
 Dutch 
Ships, should be Released without Ransome and without a∣ny wrong done to them.


2. 
That for the Future no Ship belonging to the States, should be stopt upon any pretence whatso∣ever.


3. 
That no Corsair Ship should be suffered to go out of
 Sally, 
without giving in first sufficient secu∣rity, that none of the Sates Ships should be molested by them.


4. 
That such
 Dutch 
Ships as had been taken by the Corsairs of
 Algier 
or
 Tunis, 
and brought into their Ports to be sold, should be Restored into the hands of their Respective owners.




5. 
That it should not be lawfull to retain any Na∣tive Subject of the united Provinces, as a slave, nor to sell him as such within the Countries under their Jurisdiction, but he should be immediately set at Li∣berty.


6. 
That the
 Hollanders 
should Trade freely and safely with them.


7. 
That no Merchandises Imported or Exported by the
 Hollanders 
should pay any higher Duties, than those of the
 Moors 
themselves.


8. 
That if it so pleased their High and Mighti∣nesses, the Sates, their Allies should likewise be in∣cluded in the same Treaty. And lastly that this Treaty should in all points be observed as firmly and inviolably as the Treaty before made between the said States and the King of
 Morocco. 
It was like∣wise thought fit by the Council on our side, that Captain
 de Uries 
should take Boat and go into
 Sal∣ly, 
to push on with so much the more Vigour the Negotiation of the Peace.


In the mean while in spite of all the vigi∣lance of our men in guarding the Avenues of the Port, one of their Corsairs, slily gliding in along by the Ramparts, stole into the Town. On the o∣ther side, Captain 
de Wilde,
 was ordered to go with his Ship to 
Mamore
 a little sorry Town a∣bout 500 paces from the main Sea, situated at the mouth of the River 
Subus,
 and twelve Miles distant from the Town of 
Sally,
 with design to stop up that passage from the Enemies, and to hinder them from watering there. He was re∣ceived there by the Governour with great demon∣strations of friendship, and after he had perform∣ed the Orders he had Received, he returned again to his Station before 
Sally,
 where he was extream∣ly surprised to see the Treaty of Peace broken off.


For the 
Moors
 were so far from consenting to Release the Prisoners without Ransome, that they would not endure to hear it mov'd, and those of

 
Aribal
 were so refractary as to make a difficulty likewise of accepting the other Articles of the Trea∣ty. Which obstinacy in those 
Barbarians
 had like to have provoked the 
Hollanders
 to shew their Resentment by the last extremities; however, they could not forbear replying to them in such high Terms as sufficiently testified how deeply they were incens'd at their proceedings. But with all this Huffing, they were not able to gain upon the 
Moors
 to make them alter a whit of their Resolu∣tions, nor yet by several other Negotiations by Let∣ters, which produced no effect.


In the interim our Admiral had advice, that there had appeared about 
Cape
 St. 
Vincent
 seven 
French
 Privateers looking sharp after Merchant Ships: Upon which, 
de Wilde, Tromp,
 and 
S
ert,
 were ordered to sail away towards 
Cadiz,
 to Convoy the Ships that were in that Rode, till they were out of danger, and then to make back again to observe those Privateers; all which did not in∣terrupt the Negotiations of Peace before 
Sally.
 But still the 
Moors
 would not abate an ace of their pretensions concerning the Ransoming the slaves that were to be set at liberty; nay, on the con∣trary, they were so insolent as to threaten our Fleet, that if they would not agree with them up∣on their own Terms; that they would send away all the 
Dutch
 slaves they had in their power, either to 
Algier,
 or elsewhere. This Menace made the Officers of the 
Holland
 Fleet, who were then all present, to yield to those 
Barbarians,
 that the slaves should be ransom'd, at the Price they were first bought for. And as to the rest of the Arti
es there was all likelihood they would have been a∣greed to, if the 
Moors
 had not changed their minds on a sudden, and started abundance of New difficulties against the advancement of the Trea∣ty, upon occasion of some advice that was come to them from 
Tetuan,
 which gave them hopes

 to compass the destruction of the 
Holland
 Fleet, which was this: Nine 
Algerine Corsairs
 that put in for Refreshment there, had signified to them, that they had a design to surprize and seize one of the 
Dutch
 Ships that were riding before 
Sally.
 Admiral 
de Galen
's Ship, was in most danger, and most exposed, because he was often all alone. The noise of this enterprize being confirmed by 
de Ʋries,
 put the 
Dutch
 Commanders upon more Circumspection in observing the Enemies. The o∣ther Ships of the Fleet tackt and stood back towards the Admiral, and used all the precautions vigilance could inspire them, to avoid a surprize. In the mean while, they beginning to want fresh Wa∣ter, 
Tromp
 was detacht away, to fetch them some from 
La 
ache,
 and returned not till Nine days after. During these transactions, 
de Ʋries
 came back on board the Admiral, with Letters, and brought with him a 
Spanish
 Merchant. But 
de Galen
 thought not fit to make any answer to these Letters, because he knew well enough, that the Prince of South 
Sally
 was set out some 
ays be∣fore towards 
Fez,
 and that the Prince of North 
Sally
 was likewise to follow him in two or three days, in order to make their Treaty with the K. of 
Morocco,
 to whom the most part of 
Barbary
 had newly submitted, and who most favourably received those that were most forward to range themselves under his obedience: However 
de Ga∣len
 desired the 
Spanish
 Merchant at his return to 
Sally,
 to let those people know from him, that if they offered to send away any of the 
Dutch
 slaves to other places, as they had threatn d, that he would immediately break off the Treaty, and ne∣ver enter into any Negotiation with them any more.




Assoon as the Princes of 
Sally
 were returned from 
Fez,
 they presently sent to give the Fleet notice of their arrival, signifying withall, that there was nothing they more heartily desired than a Peace, and that they passionately long'd to see the Treaty already begun, brought to a happy Conclusion. At the same time, Captain 
Blok,
 who was dispacht out of the 
Texel
 to go to 
Sally,
 arrived there with orders to 
De Galen
 from the States, to go away for the Coasts of 
Bourdeaux
 or 
Rochel,
 to Convoy the Merchant Ships that were to go back from thence towards 
Holland. De Galen
 in pursuit of those Orders, went on board the Ship called the 
Rose,
 leaving at his departure the care of the Conclusion of the Treaty at 
Sally,
 to Captain 
de Wilde,
 and other Captains of the Fleet, who after many con∣testations on both sides, concluded it at length on the 9th. of 
February
 1651, upon the following con∣ditions.


1. 
That the Governours and Princes of the two Towns of
 Sally,
 
engage for themselves and their De∣scendants, to cause to be set at liberty all the Slaves taken on Board any Vessels belonging to the Ʋnited Provinces, that are at present under their power, ac∣cording to the List already drawn, or that shall be afterwards drawn up of them, provided they on their part, pay their respective Ransoms at the price they were first sold for, each one by name, and in the order they shall be set down in the List sign'd on both sides; and that it shall not be lawful in any wise to raise their price for the profit of those con∣cerned with them, and much less to hide and con∣ceal them, or send them away elsewhere during the time their Friends are to be allowed to get up the Money necessary for their Ransom, which shall ex∣tend to the space of three Months after the Date of the present Treaty.




2. 
That no
 Corsair 
Ship shall be permitted to go out of
 Sally, 
till he have given good and sufficient se∣curity not to molest any of the Subjects of the Ʋnited Provinces, nor to meddle with any of their Ships or Effects, against whose liberty it shall not be law∣ful for them to make any attempt.


3. 
That if any of the Subjects of the Ʋnited Pro∣vinces being on board other Ships, shall happen to be taken by any of the
 Corsairs 
of
 Sally, 
it shall not be lawful to sell them, but they shall immediately be set at liberty.


4. 
That the above said Governors and Princes of
 Sally 
shall not suffer the Pirates or Corsairs coming from
 Tunis, Algiers, Tripoly, 
or any other place in
 Tur∣ky, 
to bring in any Prises thither taken from the Subjects of the Ʋnited Provinces, to fell them either directly or indirectly, in any wise whatsoever; or at least when any of these prises shall fall into their power, the prisoners that belong to them shall be set at liberty.


5. 
That the Impost laid upon Merchandises Im∣ported or Exported shall not be augmented, but con∣tinue at the same rate at which they are paid at pre∣sent.


6. 
That the abovesaid Governors and Princes of
 Sally, 
and all their Subjects shall permit all Dutch Merchants there inhabiting, as likewise such as from time to time shall come thither from the Ʋnited Pro∣vinces, to enjoy a freedom of Trade and good Cor∣respondence, and shall demean themselves in all things as good Friends and Neighbours of the States General.


7. 
That it shall not be lawful for the above-said Governors and Princes of
 Sally, 
either directly or in∣directly, to grant any Commissions to the Pirates or Corsairs of
 Barbary 
or
 Turky 
to be made use of a∣gainst the Ships of War of the Ʋnited Provinces, or under what pretence soever, to insult any of their Merchants Ships.




8. 
That the Ships of the States General shall not attempt any thing against the liberty of the Ships of
 Sally, 
or endeavour to seize them, upon any pretence whatsoever, but on the contrary, shall shew them all sort of Friendship and Good-will.


9. 
That it shall not be lawful for any of the Pirates of the Towns of
 Sally 
when they are out in Course, and meet any Merchant Ships belonging to the
 States 
to take out of them any strangers of what Nation so∣ever, but on the contrary they shall be obliged to shew them friendship, and shall render them all manner of good Offices.


10. 
That the whole shall tend in all points to pre∣serve the Friendship and Alliance m
de between the States General of the Ʋnited Provinces, and the King of
 Morocco.


After this Peace, 
Holland
 had some grounds to hope she should enjoy many long years of Repose, and after having by that laid open to her self the Commerce of the 
Levant,
 she might fill her Cof∣fers with new Riches. But Fortune that seems to have made it her business to keep this Republick in a perpetual agitation, made her soon perceive, that the Peace she had newly concluded with those Barbarians, was designed only to prepare her for a much more bloody and dangerous War.


England
 at that time had erected her self into a Republick, 
 and expulsed from the Government the Heirs of the Crown, who thereby were forced to seek an 
Asylum
 abroad, and implore the Succour and Protection of 
France
 and of the 
Ʋnited Pro∣vinces:
 And the unexperienc'd youth of King 
Charles
 the II. having swell'd the daring and am∣bitious humour of the Protector 
Cromwel
 beyond all bounds, as seeing himself Arbitrary Master of that potent Nation over which he Lorded it with an Empire more Absolute than that of any Crown'd Heads, 
Holland
 had reason from thence, to dread some very fatal Consequences. For that new Republick

 grown insolent with the many advantages she had newly gain'd against the Family of the 
Stuarts,
 thought there was left nothing else in the world capable to stop the career of her Ambition; and was so wonderfully increas'd in power, that she begun to grow insupportable to her Neighbours, and particularly to the United Provinces, who saw themselves upon the point of coming to a Rupture with her. But in regard the late long War they had had with 
Spain
 had not yet given them time enough to recover their strength, they chose rather to tem∣porize a while with 
England,
 than to embroil themselves hastily in a new War. And therefore employ'd all sort of means imaginable to divert that Storm, by hastning to send Ambassadors into 
England.
 Accordingly the Heers 
Cats, Schaap,
 and 
Vander-perre
 were dispatcht to 
London
 in that quality, who were received there with great Ho∣nours, but yet in such a manner as promis'd nothing less than a happy issue of their Negotiation.


In the mean while; 
Holland
 was no longer able to keep silence after the many bloody outrages she had received from the 
English.
 For her Merchant-Ships had suffered and daily suffered losses that were reckoned to amount to some Millions, by the Prizes taken by the 
English
 Privateers, to the num∣ber of near two hundred Ships. Yet 
Holland
 had thi∣therto suffered all those cruel Hostilities without complaining, and would not perhaps have come to an open Rupture for them: So much did she dread the dismal consequences of a War that had no o∣ther ground but Ambition, if her too great pati∣ence had not at length been pusht to the last ex∣tremity. But that which seemed an unexampled piece of Hardship imposed by the 
English
 on the 
Dutch,
 was that they pretended, they ought to be permitted even in the midst of a profound Peace, to visit not only the Merchant Ships of the States, but their Men of War too, under pretence they carried Contraband Goods to their Enemies. And besides,

 that, they had forbidden them to traffick into that part of the 
Islands
 call'd the 
Antilles,
 under their Do∣minion. Notwithstanding all that, the States sent Or∣ders to their Ambassadors, to try all amicable ways to come, if 'twere possible, to an accommodation: but when they saw there was no hopes of Peace, they took at last a resolution to arm, for the security of their Commerce. Then the English made no difficul∣ty to declare openly to our Ambassadors, that the Em∣pire of the Sea belonged to them, that they would al∣ways oppose the 
Hollanders
 keeping a Fleet there, because that was a Right belonging to them, which their Ancestors had gotten by dint of Sword from other Nations; And therefore that they would ne∣ver suffer any other Flagg to appear upon the Ocean, but that of their own Republick.


However, this Declaration hindred not the Na∣val Army of the United Provinces, being then rea∣dy, from disposing it self to set Sail under the Com∣mand of Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 who was pro∣moted to that High Office in the year 1637, in the room of the Sieur 
Dorp,
 who quitted the Service. But before they set out, 
Tromp
 desired the States to give him directions how he should behave him∣self towards the English concerning the honour of the Flagg, of which they have in all times been ex∣tremely jealous. The States askt him how he had behav'd himself in that point in the time of King 
Charles; Tromp
 replied, that when any English Ves∣sels happned to meet them towards 
Callice
 or near the Coasts of 
England,
 especially if the English were strongest, the 
Hollanders
 used to salute them with some discharge of their Canon, and by low∣ering their Flag; upon which, the States left the matter to his discretion, to act therein according as his prudence should direct him; ordering him to do nothing to the disadvantage of the Nation, or prejudicial to the Glory of the State; And that he should defend their Vessels from all manner of attempts against any that should attack them: And

 that however, to avoid giving any new matter of jealousie to the 
English,
 he should endeavour not to go near their Coasts.


But a Tempest and contrary Winds hapening to arise, 
Tromp
 was forced to quit the Coasts of 
Hol∣land
 and 
Flanders,
 and much against his will, to make towards the 
English
 Coast, to save his Fleet, and to preserve it from a fatal Shipwrack, but he quitted it again as soon as possible he could, and made towards 
Callis.
 A while after being infor∣med that Seven 
Dutch
 Merchant Ships Richly La∣den were coming from the 
Streights,
 and that two English men of War and some Frigats were in quest of them to take them, 
Tromp
 changed his Course to go to their assistance. And in his way near 
Dover,
 on the 29th. of 
May,
 he met 
Robert Blake
 Admiral for the Parliament of 
England,
 having under his Command a Fleet of about 28 Capital Men of War and Frigats, that put to Sea the 5th. of 
May
 to go a cruising upon the Coasts of the 
Low Countries. Tromp
 seeing him disposed himself to pay the usual Honours to the Banner of 
England,
 and likewise ordered a Boat to be ready to carry one of his Captains on board the Admiral to Com∣pliment him. But 
Blake
 who was in the 
James
 carrying 82 Guns and 700 Men, not minding all those marks of Submission, or at least making as if he perceived them not, made three Canon Shots one after another at 
Tromp
's Ship, called the 
Bre∣derode,
 carrying 54 Guns, and 250 Men, who an∣swered not the English Admiral till after the third Shot: And then 'twas, that the Fight began to grow hot, and Bloody, the two Fleets continuing to Cano∣nade one another for four full hours, and then were parted more by the obscurity of the night, than for having satisfied the eager desire they had to fight.


The two Naval Armies then Sheering off into the main Sea, fell to work each of them to repair their losses, and together together the vessels shatter'd and scattered in the fight. The 
Hollanders


 having hung out lights during the darkness of the night, discovered next morning at break of day, the English Retreating towards 
Dover.
 The Captains 
Tuinemans
 and 
Sipke Fokkes,
 being cut off from the Reer of the Fleet, were forc'd to yield to the Enemies, after a long and vigorous re∣sistance. But 
Fokkes
's Ship having all her Masts shot by the board, and leaking extreamly, as being shot through and through in many places, was quitted a∣gain by the 
English
 as soon as they had Plundred her, for fear she should sink under them; but yet as much maul'd as she was she made a shift to get to the 
Dutch
 Fleet again the same day. 
Bla
e
's Ship was so batter'd, that she could keep the Sea no longer, but was fain to be towed with much ado into the 
Downs.
 It is certainly said, that if 
Tromp
 had had Sea room enough during the fight, the 
English
 would not have come off at so Cheap a rate as they did.


After such an Action as that, which was to be lookt on as the Preludium of a Bloody War, which was ready to break out between the two States, 
Tromp
 being willing to Justifie himself, and to shew that he was not the Aggressour, nor had not passed his Orders, Writ the following Let∣ter upon it to the States.




High and Mighty Lords,


SInce my last of the 20th Instant, after having Cruized before the 
Meuse, Wielengen, Ostend,
 and 
Newport,
 till the 24th. we were forced to weigh Anchor, because of the Boistrous Weather, and the Tempest growing still more furious, se∣veral Captains came aboard the Admiral, to in∣form him what Anchors, and Cables they had lost, some of them having but two left; and be∣cause the Wind continued to grow more violent,

 we Resolved for the preventing of a greater di∣saster, to make towards the Coast of 
Dover.
 We got into the 
Downs
 at one a Clock, when I immediately dispatcht away Captain 
Theyssen
 of Flushing, and Captain 
Allen,
 to Compliment 
Bourn,
 who was then Riding there with a Squadron of the 
English
 Fleet under his Command, and to desire him from me, to take no Alarm at the sight of the 
Hollanders
 upon the Coasts of 
Eng∣land,
 because it hapned only by an unexpected effect of the Tempestuous Weather, and to assure him, they had no other design there than to re∣fit their Vessels in order to return as soon as they could, towards the Frontiers of the State, and that the Orders we had from the States Ge∣neral concerned only the security of our Trade and Fishing, and maintaining the Glory of our Nation. 
Bourn
 having heard this Message, made answer thereto with some Compliments he char∣ged my two Officers to make me, desiring them withall, to return me his thanks for my adver∣tisement. The 29th. of the same Month, we unmoor'd with a Wind blowing fresh at North-East, steering our Course towards 
Callice,
 with design to go and Cruize upon our own Coasts, to refurnish our selves with Anchors and Cables. We met in our way, the Captain 
Van Saanen
 of 
Amsterdam,
 coming from the 
Streights,
 with Captain 
Huntbuyt,
 who informed us, that being come along with Seven Merchant Ships valued at above 50 Tuns of Gold, they had left them at Anchor right against 
Fiverly,
 not far off from 12 Men of War belonging to the 
English
 Par∣liament. And how that the abovesaid 
Van Saa∣nen,
 having likewise met on the 22d. of 
May,
 near to 
Goudstart,
 an 
English
 Frigat that would needs have obliged him to strike to her, against which he defended himself about two hours, till at last she was forced to quit him; all these Circumstances had obliged him to make to the Fleet,

 to give them notice in what danger the Mer∣chant Ships were. This made me Resolve to go to their assistance, and to Rescue them out of the hands of the Enemies, according to the 7th. and 8th. Article of my Commission. In our way we met 15 of the Parliaments men of War, or Frigats, upon which I presently lower'd my Sails, and struck my Flag, in order to pay the Honours due to the Banner of 
England.
 Being come within Cannon shot, the 
English
 Admiral let flie a shot at me, to which I made no Answer; he then gave me another, to which I Answer'd, upon which he let flie a whole Broad side at me, which made so great Havock on board me, that several of my men were Wounded, and some of them had their Arms or Legs shot off. I then like∣wise discharged a Broad side at him, yet was not able all this while to discover what the 
English
 mean't by this, so great a silence there was kept on both sides. And thus the two Fleets came all on a sudden to be Engag'd in a general Battle. In the mean while Major 
Bourn
 being come out of the 
Downs
 with a Squadron of 12 men of War, or Frigats, whereof the first carried from 60 to 70 pieces of Cannon, and the others from 38 to 50, came and fell thundring upon our Rear. So the Fight being begun at 4 in the afternoon, lasted till 9, and was not broken off but by the obscurity of the Night. Then we made out into the Main Sea, and the Ships of both Fleets tack't about to∣wards their Admirals, to refit themselves. We remained all the Night, hanging lights out in e∣very Ship. The 30th. in the Morning, we dis∣covered the 
English
 Fleet to the Leeward, mak∣ing towards 
Dover.
 We have lost two of our Ships that were in our Rear, 
viz.
 Those Commanded by the Captains 
Tuynemans
 of 
Middleburg,
 and 
Sipke Fokkes,
 of 
Amsterdam,
 this last having had all his Masts shot do vnclose by the Board. The Master and other Officers reported to us, that they

 were taken by three of the Parliaments Ships about 9 a Clock at Night, who after they had taken out of her the Captain and Lieutenant with about 14 or 15 men, put a great many 
English
 on board her, but they being afraid she would sink under them, after they had Plunder'd her, quitted her. They reported likewise, that Captain 
Tuyneman
's Ship was taken an hour before theirs. We design now to Cruise along the Channel, to seek out our Merchant Ships coming from the 
Streights,
 and to Convoy them all together home to our own Coun∣try.




At the same time 
Tromp
 dispatcht away an Express into 
England,
 with the Copy of his Letter to the States, to be delivered to our Ambassadours there. And to make it appear more Authentick, he caus'd it to be sign'd by all the Officers of the Fleet. But it happen'd, that their High and Mightinesses Ambas∣sadors, having left 
London
 because of the thick Fogs that usually infect the Air there, were gone then to Reside at 
Chelsey,
 and the Express being stopt, 
Tromp
's dispatches were not deliver'd to them.


The 
English
 Admiral Ship, leaking on all sides, and very much shatter'd, had much ado to get into the 
Downs.
 There 
Blake
 Buried his Dead, in the Number of which were his Master and several other Persons of Note, to whom he caused very particu∣lar honours to be rendred; which done, he put Pen to Paper to inform the Parliament of all that had pas∣sed. Whereof here follows the Copy.




Most Honourable Lords,


I have written to you the present dispatches, to in∣form you of what past yesterday between the two Fleets. Upon the advice Major 
Bourn
 gave me, that 
Tromp
 appear'd toward the Souther-sand with a Fleet of 40 sail, I used all possible diligence

 to get up with him. Yesterday we discovered him below 
Dover
 Rode, and being come within 3 miles of him, 
Tromp
 unmoored with an Easterly Wind, which made us think he endeavoured to avoid us, because of the dispute about the Flag. About two hours after, the 
Dutch
 Fleet changing it's course, tackt about, and stood right towards us, 
Tromp
 be∣ing at the head of this motion. We put our selves into a line of Battle, not doubting but 
Tromp
's intention was to Engage. When the two Fleets were come within Musket shot of one another, I made a shot at his Flagg, which I Repeated three times: After the third shot, 
Tromp
 let flie at us a whole broad side. In the mean while Major 
Bourn
 coming out of the 
Downs
 brought a new Squadron of men of War to the fight, which ceased not till Night put an end to it; and then our Ships not being able to keep the Sea any longer, because of the great quantity of Masts Sails and Cordage we had lost, it was Resolv'd by the advice of all the Captains, to come to an Anchor at 3 miles off the 
Ness,
 where we kept hard at work all night in Refitting our Ships. The next Morning at break of day, we discover'd the 
Dutch
 Fleet about 4 miles from us, making towards the Coast of 
France.
 We Judged fit in a Councel of War, to keep the Weather gage of them, to prevent a surprize, in case they should Charge us again, that so at the worst, we might have nothing else to do but to cut the Cables of our Anchors. As yet we have not been able to discover whither they are steering, nor what da∣mage they have sustain'd. But however we are assur'd, that one of their Ships is sunk, and that we have taken another from them of 30 guns, with two Captains. The first of these Ships hav∣ing her Main Mast shot by the Board, and leak∣ing on all sides, Captain 
Laarsons
 was fain to quit her. We had in this fight 6 killed, 9 or 10 Mor∣tally wounded, and 25 less dangerously; among

 which number are my Master, one of his Mates, and some other under Officers. The Admiral Ship received in her sides, and masts, about 70 great shot, and in her sails and Rigging, almost an infinite Number, I having been engaged with the Main body of the Enemies Fleet for about four full hours. Notwithstanding which, our happiness is to be admired at, that we received no more damage, and we have reason to hope, that the protection of God will favour our Arms, if a War should once break out between the two Nations. The 
Hollanders
 are the Aggressours, and watch all occasions to come and affront us, and Brave us upon our own Coasts, as Experience has newly shewn us.




The News of this Fight being brought to 
En∣gland,
 so wrought upon the 
Mobb,
 that they made an insurrection, and went all in a fury to 
Chelsey
 where the 
Dutch
 Ambassadors were lodged, with design to have sacrificed them to their Resentments, if the Parliament had not provided before hand against the mischief, by sending them a body of Horse to Guard all the passages about their lodg∣ings, with strict command, to let no body go in or out. And besides preventing by that means a∣ny disorder, they designed by the same Expedient, to cut off all ways of Correspondence from the Ambassadors.


In the mean while there was nothing to be heard but Complaints and Murmurings from all parts. For the Country people in 
Kent
 and 
Suffolk
 were so alarmed at this news, that many of them deserted their houses, and others came and Complain'd to the Parliament, Representing to them what great danger their Coasts were as being the most ex∣posed to an Invasion, and putting them in fear that the 
Hollanders
 would come and Ravage the whole Country. Upon which, 
Oliver Cromwell,
 then General of all the Forces of 
England,
 and who was the 
Primum mobile
 of that Infant-Repub∣lick,

 immediately set out towards the Maritime pla∣ces, as well to appease the peoples disturbed Spirits, as to inform himself of the particulars of the fight. Some Regiments were likewise detach'd from the Army, and order'd to march towards the Sea Coasts, which were Quarter'd at 
Greenwich, Gravesend, Sandwich,
 and 
Dover.


Cromwell
 having carefully Examined into all the reports of the Battle, was very ill satisfied at it, and so much the more because Captain 
Wil∣liam Brandley,
 and Captain 
Dennis Bond,
 both 
En∣glish
 Men that were in 
Dover
 Castle at that time, agreed together, as well as the 
Dutch
 Captains, 
Tuynemans
 and 
Sipke Fokkes,
 who were prisoners, that it was their opinion, that 
Blake
 had made three shots at 
Tromp,
 before he offered to defend him∣self. After such a discovery as that, 
Cromwell
 re∣turned to the Parliament at 
London,
 and at his arri∣val, all was pacified, and the unruly 
Mobb
 quietly laid down their arms.


However what had past, left no Room for any to doubt, but that a War would thereupon break out between those two potent Republicks, tho' both par∣ties endeavoured to excuse and Justifie themselves of any blame in the matter, because they were loth to pass for the Authors of the sad-disasters that must needs ensue thereon. For the 
English
 pre∣tended, that the 
Dutch
 were the Aggressors, but they maintained the contrary. 
Tromp
 having writ a Letter to the States with all the Circum∣stances of the Fight, as we have already seen, cau∣sed likewise a more exact information to be drawn up of the whole matter of Fact, which was sign∣ed by Forty 
Dutch
 Officers of the Fleet. It con∣tained the whole account of that action, and of all it's particulars; and all the Captains unani∣mously agreed in their report, that 
Tromp
 had no other design in this Expedition, than to maintain the freedom of Commerce, and that he intended to pay the honours due to the 
English
 Flag, but that

 Admiral 
Blake
 had made three shot at him with his Guns, before he made any at him, till at last his Pa∣tience being pusht to the utmost extremity, he found himself obliged to answer him in the like Language, at the third discharge.


On the other side all the Captains of the 
English
 Fleet, being likewise called together by the Admi∣ral's command, drew up a 
Manifesto,
 by which, after they had related all the Circumstances of the fight, they pretended to prove, that 
Tromp
 came up to the 
English
 Fleet, only to dare them, tho' he against all sence, thought to excuse him∣self under the specious pretence of coming only to the assistance of the 
Dutch
 Merchant Fleet, when it was well known they had already weighed An∣chor, and past by the 
Saturday
 before, in sight of Admiral 
Blake,
 who never made the least offer to attack them. That 
Tromp
 with a very Criminal boldness coming to an Anchor before 
Dover,
 ne∣ver made offer to salute the Castle, tho' the Castle had discharged three Guns, at three different times, to give him notice of his duty; but that yet 
Tromp
 out of contempt, dissembling that he per∣ceived it, remained in his post all Night, and next day till Noon, without striking his Flag. And to add the more weight to this 
Manifesto,
 the 
English
 added some Articles of the orders that 
Tromp
 had given the Captains of his Fleet; which the 
English
 had gotten information of from the two 
Dutch
 Captains they had taken prisoners. They contained among other things,


I. That the Chiefs or Captains of Squadrons al∣ready Equip'd, or to be hereafter Equip'd, had Express Orders to take care to preserve the ves∣sels belonging to these Provinces, and not to suf∣fer them to be visited; without comprising there∣in, the disputes that necessarily happen at Sea concerning the passports and Evidences that e∣very Ship whatever she be, is obliged to shew at the first demand, according to the Marine Trea∣ty

 concluded with the K. of 
Spain,
 the 17 of 
December
 1650. That they should defend them from all manner of Attempts, and Endeavour to re-take them from those who should have taken them, by employing for that effect their whole force against the Aggressor, for the service of their Country, and Act in all things conformably to their Commission, and to the Customs of Sea-faring men.


II. That if in fighting against any Foreign Ships whether to defend themselves, or other Ships be∣longing to the State, they should happen to take them, they should be obliged to carry them into 
Holland,
 with a very exact information of all pas∣sages between them, to be presented to the Ad∣miralty of the place from which the Victorious Ship set out.


III. To these Articles, they added besides, that every Chief, or Captain should keep his Guns and his Arms always in readiness, and should tack a∣bout towards the Admiral, and the main body of the Fleet, upon sight of any Foreign Man of War. That he should take good heed to the Sig∣nal of War, and mind whether it were offensive or defensive, that by protecting the States Ships and not suffering them to be visited, th
y might be the better able to pursue their Respective Voyages by Regulating themselves by the Flag, which be∣ing red, and fastned to the Top Gallant of the Admirals Main Mast, should be understood to be∣token War, at the sight of which, every man should strive to do his b
st, in order to gain some advantage upon the Enemy. That if they took any of their Ships, they should carry it under the Admirals Flag; but that as soon as the bloody Flag should be taken down, all acts of Hostility should cease.


IV. It was moreover expresly forbidden them, to pay any salutes with their Guns, by way of ho∣nour to any, unless upon very good grounds;

 that however, if they chanced to come near a∣ny Foreign Man of War, which they were un∣der a kind of an Engagement to salute, because it concerned the honour of the United Provin∣ces so to do, they should in such cases, use great Circumspection, especially if the Chiefs or Cap∣tains of such Foreign Ships should have first salu∣ted the Lieutenant General, or him that commands in his place, but above all, they were to take care, it might be done without damage.


Likewise when any of the Ships of the Fleet be∣ing sent a cruising to Sea, should discover any Foreign Ship; or, that she got Intelligence that Warlike preparations were making any where, and that Ships were gathering together, to com∣pose a Fleet, then the said Ship was to get the exactest information possible, of the Number of their Men of War, and of their Arms, Guns, and Men, that she should take good notice, which way they steer'd, and whether in their passage, they offer'd to commit any act of Hostility. That in this case, they should give the Admiral advice of it with all the diligence imaginable, who thereupon, was to give the following Orders, 
viz.
 That scouts be sent to all parts of the Seas, that all the Ships of the Fleet should repair to the appointed 
Rendevous,
 where they should con∣sult together what design the Fleet so discover∣ed might have, what course they steer'd, and in∣to what Harbour they would enter, whether in∣to one of the ports belonging to the States, or some other. And if it should happen, they had fail'd at first to use all those precautions, that then they should let off a Great Gun for a Sig∣nal; that so every one taking notice it was an Extraordinary Signal, and Judging from thence of the importance of the business, might return answer thereto, each of them likewise, with a Gun Extraordinary; after which every one of them should be obliged to make to the place

 whence the first Gun was fired, that all the Cap∣tains of the Fleet meeting together on board the Admiral, might take such Resolutions as should be most convenient for the time, and for the good of the State.


From which Articles and Instructions of 
Tromp
 to his Officers, tho' the 
English
 pretended to draw invincible proofs, that the 
Hollanders
 were the Ag∣gressors in the late bloody attempt upon their Fleet, yet the 
Dutch
 on the contrary, pretended it was visible from thence, that their main Aim was only to secure their Trade, and defend the Glo∣ry of their Nation, in case they were attackt, but that they had not the least design to be Aggressors against the 
English.


After this Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 whilst he was Cruising below 
Bullen,
 writ a Letter to Ad∣miral 
Blake,
 dated the 2d. of 
June,
 in which he intreated him to release the two Capt. of his, he had made Prisoners, and who were already carried to 
London,
 and to order the Restitution of Captain 
Tuyneman
's Ship.


But 
Blake
 as yet red hot with Resentment, for what was so newly past between them, and be∣ing much surprized, that after the Rough Com∣pliments between them in that Rencounter, 
Tromp
 should presume to Write to him upon such a Sub∣ject as that, in very great indignation, made him the following Answer.




SIR,


NOthing ever surpriz'd me more than yours of the 2d. of 
June
 last, in that,
 tho you affect with so much vanity, to pass for a Man of Ho∣nour, yet 'tis no way visible, that you main∣tain that Character by any of your Actions. The

 Cruel attempt you lately made against the Par∣liament of 
England
's Fleet, whose ruin you had conspired, is an evident proof of this: That Fleet, I say, to which you were in duty oblig∣ed to pay your Humblest Respects and Submissions, since you have not refused to pay them in several other Rencounters. That Act of Hostility you have so lately committed, is so much the more Criminal, because there was no occasion given you from 
England,
 to engage you to proceed to such an extremity, since you were pleased to do it in a time when your Ambassadors were flatter∣ing our Commonwealth with new hopes of Peace and Union, and pretended to solicit with much earnestness a speedy conclusion of a Treaty of Mutual Alliance and Confederation. That is the Brave Exploit upon which at present you found your glory, and for which you frame an unjust Apology, as pretending you did nothing else but defend your self. But God in whom we put our greatest hopes, having made your designs serve to your own destruction, we have taken some of your Ships, which you now are pleased to redemand with as much confidence, as if the action lately 
ommitted had been no act of Ho∣stility, as it appears in your Writings, by your affecting to give it another name. In fine, I thought not fit to give you any other answer, but this, That I am perswaded, you will find the Parliament of 
England
 very ill satisfied with your Conduct; because they cannot but regard with horror the Innocent Blood of their Subjects that has been spilt; and on the other side, that after all, you will find your self constrained, al∣ways to give them the marks of an entire sub∣mission.






In the mean while, the States Ambassadors, were at 
London
 endeavouring to Renew the Negotiati∣on for a Treaty, and having for that purpose, demanded Audience of the Parliament, it was granted them. It was their business then, to en∣deavour to appease their exasperated Spirits, and thereby to put a timely stop to the dismal con∣sequences of the War that was ready to burst out between these two Formidable Powers, which was a Task of no small difficulty. However, they employed their industry and parts in it to the best advantage they could, and accordingly on that Subject, made the following Speech to the Par∣liament.




Most Honourable Lords.


WE expected nothing less than the fatal disa∣ster which has lately hapned.
 And if what Publick Fame says, of a Sea fight between the two Fleets, prove true, this disgrace is so much the greater and more afflicting to us, because our Men are lookt upon as the Authors of it. All those stories that are whisper'd about concerning this matter, are already lookt upon by the people, as the mournful presages of the ruine of two States that have hi∣therto been ever linkt together in a strict Alliance, and now by this fatal blow, see themselves at the eve of a Bloody War. We are so sensibly concern'd at all the false Rumours that are spread abroad to the disadvantage of our Nation, that we will call God to witness, that the States General were so far from contributing to the late unhappy recoun∣ter, that they had not the least knowledge of it, and desire nothing so much as Ʋnion, Peace, and an inviolable Friendship with 
England.
 However 'tis not impertinent to the matter in question, to let you know, that it may be observ'd from the Let∣ter

 written to us by the Admiral of 
Holland,
 that the true Cause of that action was very different from what 'tis reported to have been: And what is more, 
Tromp
 declares in that Letter, in ex∣press terms, and he repeats it three times, that he had not received any other Orders from the States, than only to defend the Merchant Ships belonging to the States, from the oppression of those who might be capable to disturb the freedom of their Commerce, and to Cruise upon the Frontiers of the State with∣out going far from 
Ostend
 and 
Newport;
 from whence 'tis as clear as the day, That the States General of the Ʋnited Provinces never had any thoughts to attempt any thing that might be capable to break the strict union that has always been be∣tween 
England
 and 
Holland.
 And if any thing has hapned contrary to the sincerity of their intenti∣ons, they who shall be found to have violated the Rules, and passed the Bounds that were prescribed them, ought to be Responsible for it.


According to the Orders given us by their High and Mightinesses, to endeavour a Treaty of Alli∣ance, we presented some days ago to your Com∣missioner, a Memorial, in which we propose means, not only for composing the differences about Com∣merce, but likewise for the securing of it, and ren∣dering it more flourishing. And we desire nothing else at present but to see them brought to a speedy and happy conclusion. And indeed who could believe, that a Treaty that is at present the firmest support of good and well disposed people, and the most solid foundation of the Reformation, should be interrup∣ted by the capricious humour of a few ill intention∣ed persons? It is a Natural Law acknowledged by all the World, That, in Private Affairs, if an At∣torney or Proctor; or in Publick Affairs, if a Mi∣nister of State, offers to pass the Duties of his Of∣fice; or if a General of an Army, without any Order from his Soveraign, Ravages and lays Wast the

 Countries of his Allies, or like a wild unruly Beast that has broken his Chains, runs about the Fields and does all the mischief he can, then in such a case, it is but Justice to hold the Soveraigns blame∣less, and to charge the 
rime upon those who are the true Authors of it; and especially if the Soveraigns disavow the Fact, as there is reason to expect, the States will do in the case now in debate. However there is no doubt, but that it would be a thing al∣together unheard of, and condemned both by Divine and Humane Laws, to go about to commit any acts of Hostility, without hearing first what reasons the Adversary had to alledge for himself. 'Tis a Max∣ime universally received by all Nations conducted by the light of Reason, That when any mischievous fact is committed, the examination of the crime, should precede before Sentence be given; But like∣wise, if the Party offended receive ample satisfa∣ction, ought he not to lay by his Resentment? And it is not to be wondred at, if all Nations natu∣rally avoid War, and are inclined to Peace, since War is a horrible Monster that causes a thousand unhappi∣nesses and feeds upon nothing but innocent Blood. Some holy Fathers of the Church have very truly and perti∣nently said, That men ought to have War in abo∣mination, even when Justice or Necessity it self obliges them by force to take Arms, but especi∣ally Christians, who ought to have learnt to be spa∣ring of the Blood of other people as well as of that of their own Subjects. Experience shews us in na∣tural things, that when the most excellent Wines come to corrupt, they change into Vinegar most extrem∣ly sharp. So likewise if these two Nations that have for so many years been united together, in Religion, Commerce and Liberty, and whom the Neighbourhood of the Sea, the Glory of Arms, and their known valour have rendred yet more in∣separable, should come once to break that Ʋnion, what else must be expected thence but their com∣mon Ruine? Would not they be then like th
s
 Sons

 of the Earth, that destroyed one another, as we are told in the story of 
Cadmus?
 And will not even our Religion be thereby exposed to contempt; and will not our common Enemies draw from our trou∣bles new matter of triumph?


Truly our sense in this case differs nothing from that of some of your Writers, who have very ju∣diciously compared our two Republicks to two Earth∣en Vessels floating on the Sea, with this 
Motto, Si collidimur fragimur, i. e.
 If we fall foul on one another, we shall certainly break. That is an Em∣blem that admirably well shews that a perpetual Peace ought to render them inseparable. For if a well cemented Ʋnion might once be settled be∣tween these two Nations, what felicities are there they might not enjoy? By that, we shall see Reli∣gion firmly established, the Sea open to us, Navi∣gation free, and the Enemies of the two Nations put out of all power to hurt them, Peace and Tran∣quility secured, and what is still more to be desired, the Blessing of Heaven entailed upon us. In fine, to conclude, we therefore most earnestly beseech you, that you would order a Copy of a Relation of the late fight as it really passed, to be delivered to us, and to permit us to send it to the States General of the Ʋnited Provinces, that by examining care∣fully the relations of both Parties, the truth may the more easily be detected; That in the mean while, all Hostilities may cease on both sides. That the Negotiation for a Treaty of Peace, may not be broken off on this occasion, That so by re∣medying the misfortunes lately hapned, we may at last effect the conclusion of a solid and durable Peace, which we passionately wish for, and which we pray God the Soveraign Arbiter and Lord of Peace, to be pleased to grant us.




After this discourse, the Ambassadours retired, and were guarded home to their Lodgings by a Party of the English Guards. The Parliament seemed to them to be extremely divided, and to

 waver much in their Resolutions about so weighty and Nice a Point, but yet without posi∣tively declaring, which of the Admirals they judg∣ed to have begun the Fight. The major part of the Members maintained, that the English Admi∣ral had right on his side, but 
Tromp
 was not of that opinion. The rest of the Parliament being stirred up by the secret practices of the Spanish Faction, said, that the Hollanders had by the late action given an evident proof of their Treachery; That the Republick of 
England
 had reason to be much alarmed at it, and to look upon it as an assured presage of their future Ruine. Yet there were se∣veral Members of that Illustrious Body, whether moved by some private interest, or by a principle of friendship, that were more inclined to an accommo∣dation with the Hollanders than to a Rupture, in the number of which, were these Gentlemen, 
viz. Mildmay, Vane, Pembrook,
 and several others: But 
Cromwel
 who was in the highest degree of his for∣tune, of which he made his Idol, was the only man that had the secret of working upon the spirits of that Nation. His Party was backt by 
Harrison, Whitlock, Bradshaw, St. Johns, Harrington, Fleetwood,
 and Mr. 
Scot,
 who fomented the Jea∣lousies and lying stories that the hatred the peo∣ple had conceived against the 
Hollanders
 had lately produced, nay, and they had blown up the flame to so great a height, that they re∣ported, that 
Tromp
 was come to 
London
 with a design to make a general Massacre of the people; but his enterprise not taking effect, he had com∣manded those of his Fleet, to put all the English they met with to the Sword; and that besides, he had given orders to all his Captains upon pain of Death, that at the approach of any English Man of War, if they found themselves in danger of being taken, having got all their Seamen upon the Deck, they should clap a lighted Match into their Powder-room, as well to destroy their Ene∣mies

 by blowing them up into the Air, as to take from them all hopes of any Booty. The Sieur 
Nieuport
 who was sent some weeks before, as well to carry some Papers to the Ambassadors concerning their Negotiation, as to tell them se∣veral things by word of mouth that were intru∣sted with him by the States, run great danger of his life, because he was taken for a Spie. In a word, the mutual hatred between both Nations was risen to that high degree of bitterness, that there was reason to fear they would never be re∣conciled more.


The Ambassadors well observed, that 
Cromwel
 acting like an able Politition, used great dissimu∣lation with them, and that besides, other motives that actuated him, he was further influenced by his own private Ambition. He appeared the first days of the contest very moderate to∣wards them, and wholly inclined to lay, by some gentle expedient, the Storm that was newly ri∣sen, but yet at the bottom, he was of the same mind with the Parliament, or to speak more pro∣perly, 'twas he that underhand spurred them on to Revenge, and he that perswaded them to em∣ploy all their Forces to destroy the 
Hollanders.
 The Ambassadors having then discovered the Par∣liaments design, and that they were fitting out a formidable Fleet to Sea, on which were to be embarkt 4000 Soldiers, resolved to present a se∣cond Memorial to the Council of State, which was conceived in these Terms.


The Ambassadours of the States General of the United Provinces having protested on 
Monday
 last before this August Council, and called God himself to witness their Innocence, and the Ju∣stice of their Cause, declaring that the Fight be∣tween the two Fleets did not happen by any pre∣meditated design of their High and Mightinesses: They have judged it expedient for the better clear∣ing of that point, to put into your hands a

 Copy of 
Tromp
's Letter, by which this Repub∣lick may evidently see, that their High and Mightinesses gave him no other Commission than to cruise on the Frontier Seas of their own Do∣minions, without passing any farther, for fear of giving jealousie to their Neighbours. And therefore the said Ambassadors come again to day, to give you new assurances upon their having received by yesterdays Post, all the informations given in from the 22d to the 29th of the last month, New stile, concerning the Battle in Question, by which it appears still more clearly, That the States had no hand in that action, directly or indirectly, declaring themselves ready to con∣clude a strict Alliance that may be capable to unite the two Republicks by eternal and invi∣olable friendship. It is certain, That is their last and most sincere intention.


Moreover, the said Ambassadors pray the Coun∣cil of State to be pleased to give them a speedy Answer, such as they in their prudence shall think most proper, in the present juncture, to prevent the mischievous consequences of some more dismal Accident. Neither will it be un∣seasonable, to acquaint the Council that the Sieur 
Newport
 sent from their High and Migh∣tinesses to their Ambassadors for business con∣cerning their Negotiation, is upon his departure to repass the Sea, if the Council of State will please to grant him a Passport, as we pray them to do, and that he may have leave to chuse one of the States Ships that is now in the 
Thames,
 or elsewhere.


The Sieur 
Newport
 having expedited his affairs, waited only for a Passport to be gone, but he found great difficulty to obtain it, which retarded his departure for several days. He got at last out of 
London
 with much ado, and came to 
Gravesend,
 thinking to embark there. But at that time, the English, by shewing fresh marks of their resent∣ment,

 rekindled those flames which were thought to be half extinguisht, and made appear by their slighting the instances of the Ambassadors, and by new acts of Hostility, that all those troubles would soon degenerate into an open War. The Channel was full of their Privateers, who took without any distinction all manner of Ships that came in their way, without excepting even those that belonged to 
France
 or 
Spain.
 All the 
Dutch
 Ships that were in the 
Thames,
 were likewise stopt the 13th of 
June,
 and their Captains went to 
Chelsey,
 to make their Complaints of it to the Ambassadors, who were extremely surprized at all these new attempts, and thought it there∣upon necessary to present yet a Third Memorial more, which they did the very same day, in these following Terms.


We having on the 3d and 6th of this Month clearly made appear to the Council of State, as well by Writing as word of Mouth, taking God, that knows the Hearts of Men, to witness, That the Bloody Battle that was lately fought between the two Fleets of the two Republicks, hapned without the knowledge, and against the will of the United Provinces, so are we more and more confirmed both by Letters and Ex∣presses, that our Masters have been sensibly grie∣ved at this Combat, and that farther, upon the Advices we have given them, they have applied themselves with all care imaginable, to seek out Remedies that may be able to quash all these growing Troubles in their Birth, and timely stop the blood of so dangerous a wound. 'Twas for that effect they have called a solemn and Ge∣neral Assembly of all the Members of the State, in which we not at all doubt, but with the as∣sistance of Heaven, they will find out the true means to renew again that ancient Friendship and Union that has always reigned between the two

 Nations, and that they will remove all the diffi∣culties that seem at present to render them irre∣concileable, which will be an assured advance towards the Conclusion of the Treaty already begun. Their High and Mightinesses desire it with so much the more Passion and Earnestness, because it so highly concerns the Welfare and re∣pose of the two Republicks, and will effectual∣ly stop the fountains of Christian Blood that has been shed. This is what at present flatters the hopes of so many Nations, and especially of the Protestants, so that we intreat you both by the Sacred Bond of Religion that unites us together, and by the Sweet Liberty we equal∣ly enjoy, That nothing may be done with too much precipitation, for fear the Remedies that may be afterward judg'd proper for our reconci∣liation, coming too late, may prove ineffectual. We also pray you, as soon as possible without delay, to answer favourably to our last demand, which we solicit with so much the more earnestness, because we are informed, that the Ships and Mariners of our Nation are taken, and stopt by your orders, on the High Seas, or in your Har∣bours, the one by pure force, and the other af∣ter Fighting.


The Parliament at last answered them in such a manner as might well be expected after what had lately passed.
 And here follows the Tenour of their Answer.


The Parliament of the Commonwealth of 
England,
 reflecting upon all the proofs of bene∣volence and sincere Friendship, they have of∣ten given to the States General of the United Provinces, even from the first beginning of the troubles of this Kingdom, having omitted no∣thing of what might conduce to the main∣taining a perfect Correspondence between them

 and it, and render their union much more strict than ever before, find themselves at present hai∣nously offended by an unexpected attempt, which is an act of Hostility committed upon the Coasts of 
England
 against the Fleet of the Re∣publick, after a mature deliberation, and exa∣mination of the Writings which their Excellen∣cies the Ambassadors of the United Provinces have put into our Hands, we have thought fit to make them the present Answer.


Tho the Parliament were inclined out of a principle of affection and tenderness, to receive favourably the expressions contained in the a∣bovesaid writings, tending to represent the late Fight between the two Fleets, as a thing that hapened without the knowledge and against the will of their High and Mightinesses, yet upon due reflection made thereon, it appears, That the Resolutions of the States; and the Conduct of their Admirals do no ways agree with all those protestations, especially in a time whilst a Trea∣ty of Alliance was managing, which they them∣selves had sought for, and which had been Ne∣gotiated by their own Ambassadors. Besides, what could be the scope of so formidable an Arming of 150 Ships of War, made by them without any occasion for it, was it not for the design which has now lately broken out? Which is nothing else but the effect of a real jealousie, even by the confession of the Ambassadors them∣selves, at the same time they pretend to excuse themselves of it; and according to the Tenour of the Commissions their High and Mightines∣ses have given to the Chief Commanders of their Naval Armies, there are but too many reasons that perswade us to believe, that the States do thereby but aspire to Ravish from 
England
 by force of Arms, her ancient Prerogatives, and the Rights she has over the Seas; and that fur∣ther, they aim at nothing else but the destructi∣on

 of our Fleet; which is our Barrier, and our securest Rampart, and by that means to expose this Commonwealth to an Invasion, as they in∣tended to do by the late attempt. Upon which, the Parliament think themselves indispensably engaged with the assistance of Heaven to exact speedy satis∣faction for the outrages done to the Nation, and to put themselves in such a condition that the like may happen no more for the future. And yet they do all this with design however to appease if possible the Troubles that have lately risen be∣tween the two Nations, by all ways of Humanity and moderation, if God who by his Wisdom and Almighty Power, is able to do all things, shall please to furnish us with more proper and efficacious means for that end, than have been hi∣therto employed.


This Answer, together with that proud and haughty way the 
English
 have with them, begun to give new alarms to 
Holland,
 and make her fear the Consequences would be fatal. It was a very sensible Vexation to the States, to see them∣selves upon the point of coming to a Rap∣ture with that New Republick, whose happy progresses in her beginnings had made them con∣ceive fair hopes, that she would let her Allie 
Holland
 share with her in the prosperities she enjoyed by the good Correspondence and strict Friendship which was like to Reign between them. The Merchants were almost out of their Wits at it, by reason of the great loss they daily suf∣fered both of their Ships and Goods, which un∣happily became a Prey to the 
English
 Privateers. Which obliged the States, before the Negotiati∣on already begun was quite broken off, to dis∣patch another Extraordinary Ambassage to 
Lon∣don,
 being willing to appease all disputes by A∣micable ways, if it were possible to find out a∣ny means to do it, and it being necessary for that

 purpose to make choice of some person of great Me∣rit, they cast their Eyes upon Mr. 
Pauw,
 Lord of 
Heemsted,
 Pensioner of 
Holland,
 one of the ablest Ministers, even by the Testimony of Foreigners them∣selves, the Republick ever had. He set out from the 
Hague,
 the 25th. of 
June,
 on his way to the 
Brill,
 and at 6 a Clock at Night the same day he got on Board a 
Dutch
 Man of War; the 28th. he ar∣rived at 
Gravesend,
 and sent notice of his arri∣val to the States Ambassadors, and to the Parlia∣ment, who were not a little surprised at it. The Ambassadors came presently to him, to inform him of all that had pass'd. The 30th. Mr. 
Heem∣sted
 was Conducted to 
London
 with the Ceremo∣nies usual at the Entry of Ambassadors. He was received at the Tower, by three members of Par∣liament, and Conducted thence by them to the House appointed for his Lodging attended by a very fine Train of Coaches of many great Lords and persons of Quality. He presently demanded Audience of the Parliament, which being granted him the very next day, he there pronounced a dis∣course in 
Latin
 whereof here follows the Transla∣tion.




Most Honoured Lords,


THe Publick Testimonies and Authentick proofs of a sincere and cordial Amity which the States of the United Provinces and their Sub∣jects have always shewn to the British Nation, and especially towards the Parliament of the Com∣monwealth of 
England,
 whose Government is at present so happy and flourishing, are so well known to all Christendom, that no body doubts of them, any more than they do of the ardent passion they have had, to render it perpetual, firm, and unmoveable. But because, by reason of the

 inconstancy of worldly things, there often hap∣pen unlucky accidents and disorders in Humane life, that change the State of affairs, and seem to cover over its face with a thick and sable Cloud that obscures for a time that agreeable Union, and happy mutual Benevolence, there is need of a great deal of precaution to stop its mischiev∣ous Consequences; above all, if it be considered, that when such kind of troubles are timely sti∣fled in their birth, and that unhappy misunder∣standing started by them comes once to cease, it may be said, they serve more to strengthen and confirm that mutual Union, than any way to weaken or dissolve its Bonds.


'Tis for this design, that my Mrs. the States General of the United provinces, have been plea∣sed to send me in Quality of their Ambassador ex∣traordinary to the Parliament of the Common∣wealth of 
England,
 tho' otherwise they had no reason to doubt either of the Prudence or of the Capacity of the Ambassadors they had here al∣ready for Affairs of high importance. I am there∣fore sent, to assure the Commonwealth of 
Eng∣land
 from them, of the sincere and inviolable de∣sire they have to see its Government continue in that Peace, Happiness and Prosperity which at present it enjoys, and to offer it at the same time, all the services they are capable of. And I can give you this Testimony of them with the more assured fidelity, because having always been pre∣sent in their assemblies, and coming now but new∣ly out of them, I have been an Eye witness of the zeal and ardent passion they have, to contribute all that lies in their power, that may possibly con∣duce to the maintaining a firm and solid Friend∣ship between the two States, and to prevent all that may shake it. And therefore 'twas with great Astonishment, and with a very sensible Re∣gret they heard of what has past between the Ad∣mirals of the two Republicks; and for fear that

 fatal Rencounter altogether unexpected should cause some new mis-understandings and raise new Jealousies, or that by putting a stop to the present Treaty, it might make it impracticable to come to a conclusion of a Renovation of the Anci∣ent Amity that has always been between the two Nations, the States, my Mrs. judg'd it neces∣sary I should come hither, because having been always present at all their deliberations by reason of my Employment, I was best able to Repre∣sent to the Commonwealth of 
England,
 the na∣ked truth, and all the Circumstances of that Acti∣on, as they have been related to them, in order to the rasing out all suspicions that might be capa∣ble to distemper or destroy the good intelligence and true Amity that is between the two Nations, and remove all obstacles that might, hinder the conclusion of the Treaty already began.


Moreover I protest and declare in the presence of the Parliament of the Republick of 
England
 by vertue of my Credential Letters; and in the Name of the States General, my Mrs. that they never had any thoughts to attempt any thing, or give order, that any thing should be attempted that might give any just cause of Umbrage to the Sovereign power of this Commonwealth, to break or weaken the Union and good Corre∣spondence that has been so long cultivated be∣tween the two Republicks, or under what pre∣tence soever, to sow any discord between them. But rather on the contrary, I can say, that the States have been moved by their own inclinations, and by the sentiments of a real Friendship, care∣fully to study out all that might conduce to the hastning the conclusion of a strict and inviolable Alliance between the two Nations. It's true a very considerable Fleet was Equip'd in 
Holland,
 but at the same time there's no body but knows, the States were forced so to do by the continual complaints of their Subjects, and that they gave

 notice of it to the Parliament. And they publish∣ed beforehand, that this arming was for no o∣ther end than for the liberty and security of Commerce, which was much endamag'd and in∣terrupted by many very sensible Losses the Sub∣jects of the United Provinces daily suffered of their Ships and Goods; and certainly, it is but natural to make use of the means that force and necessity put into our hands, to protect oppres∣ed innocence: But they thoughr of nothing less than a fight, to create new troubles between the two Nations, and Revive the disputes that were already terminated. But things being so, and there hapning by accident a fierce Battle between the Fleets of the two Nations, the States General have thought fit to Communicate to the Parlia∣ment of 
England
 an exact and faithfull Relation of all that passed, such as they have received from their Admiral, authorized by the Testimony of all the Captains and other persons worthy of Credit: namely, that Admiral 
Tromp
 came to∣wards the Fleet of this Republick, more by ne∣cessity than out of any premeditated design, and that after he had paid his Civilities to Major 
Bourn,
 as he was pursuing his voyage, he fell into the presence of Admiral 
Blake
 before he was a∣ware; that presently he ordered an advice Boat to be made ready, to send some Officers of the Fleet to Compliment him, but that 
Blake
 answering him with Civilities of a quite contrary nature, let flie all his Guns at him, and that then 
Tromp
 dis∣charg'd his, more to defend himself, than to of∣fend the Aggressor. This was the cause of an En∣gagement, in which, the Capricious humour of Fortune had more share than any design of Coun∣cil premeditated, and swell'd up with Ambition, so that it being begun about a mistaken point of Honour, and not continued by our men out of a∣ny principle of animosity, the States General pray the Commonwealth of 
England,
 to be per∣swaded,

 they had no hand in that Action, but to take it for an Event of pure chance, and of the in∣constancy of Worldly affairs, and that accord∣ingly they would be pleased to recall their Or∣ders and Commissions, and to let all Acts of Ho∣stility cease that now disturb Commerce, and the States on their part, are ready to consent to the same, and always to employ all possible means to facilitate an Accommodation.


They are very sensible, that all Christendom is deeply concerned in so great an affair as this, and especially the reformed Churches of all 
Europe,
 who all equally wish and desire, that our troubles may be stifled in their Birth, as being perswaded, that discord arising between Neighbouring States of the same Religion, may not only draw after it the Ruin of that Commerce that makes them Flourish, but likewise awaken the drooping hopes of both their secret and open Enemies, who would not fail to take occasion thereupon, to fo∣ment some new Plots in some Province or other of this Commonwealth which would afterwards break out, and so passing from one to another, we should see our States become the bloody Theater of a War. To prevent therefore and put a stop to the Course of so great mischiefs, I have Orders without further delay, to Repre∣sent to you, and employ all my industry that some assur'd means may be agreed upon on both sides to accommodate the differences about what has past, and for the taking such just Measures for the future, that there may never happen the like accidents again between the two Fleets; and that so thereby the Greatness and Glory of the Parliament of 
England
 may be secured from the danger of all sorts of attempts against it.


Since then the States General openly declare to the Parliament the ardent passion they have to see the two Nations perfectly United toge∣ther and their differences entirely composed, and

 that the propositions on both sides may at last terminate in a strict Alliance, all the favour I desire of the Parliament, is that they would please to give order to their Commissioners, and to the Council of State, to give me speed∣dy Audience, and to labour joyntly with me for the Conclusion of the Treaty, in order to terminate the principal business that is the foundation of my Negotiation, as well as of that of the other Ambassadors In extraordina∣ry, of the States.


In the mean while, I acknowledge my self infinitely obliged to the Parliament, that they have been pleased to grant a Ship to Mr. 
Nieu∣port
 to repass the Sea, and go into 
Holland;
 I will add here, that being a Member of the State, he has had order to remain with me, to assist me with his Council, till my return, which I dare be confident, the Parliament will not take ill; and that they will be pleased favourably to accept my most humble services which I pre∣sent them.


Mr. 
de Heemsted
 going the next day to the Council of State,
 made them the following Speech, which he pronounced in 
French.
 Since it has pleased my Lor
s, the States General of the United Provinces besides the Ambassadors they have already here, to send me extraordi∣narily in the same Quality to the Parliament of the Republick of 
England,
 to whom I had the Honour yesterday in a full Assembly, to declare the Subject of my Ambassage, and the sincerity of the intentions of the High and Migh∣ty Lords, my Mrs. I thought my self indispen∣sably obliged to appear before this 
August
 Council, as well to present them my Creden∣tial Letters, as to assure them for my own par∣ticular, how much I tender the prosperity they enjoy in the management of those great and important affairs intrusted to them by the Com∣monwealth

 and which they discharge with so much Wisdom and Prudence. And as I have already declared to the Parliament, so I Reiterate again here, that the States General desire nothing so much as the Continuation of a good, and in∣timate Correspondence, and the Renewing of a durable and solid Friendship with 
England,
 of which they had in several Rencounters given very signal marks. It is Certain, the States, my Mrs. wish nothing more heartily, than to see the Trea∣ty of Peace brought to a Conclusion, and the U∣nion between the two Republicks, thereby Re-establisht and Corroborated, and all Sub∣jects of hatred and mis-understanding that might be able to disturb it, thereby entirely dispell'd. Gentleman, it is the Aim of the Enemies of the Reformation, by Divisions, not only to weaken but totally to ruin the two Republicks, but the two Nations having received so many great marks of the blessing of God, as well by their par¦taking in the true Religion of which they are the trusty Guardians, as by the prodigies that have appear'd in their foundation and establish∣ment, in several parts of the World, whither they have so happily advanced Commerce in spite of all the dangers of the Seas; the States, my Mrs. Judge it absolutely necessary to maintain Religion, and strengthen our Republicks which cannot be effected otherwise than by a happy Complication, and an agreeable confusion of their Riches and common Interests; that will be the true means with the assistance of Hea∣ven to prevent all that may be capable to trou∣ble their happiness and felicity.


Upon which considerations the States General were so extremely surprized at the news of what past lately between the two Naval Armies, and at the mutual jealousie the two Nations have conceived thereupon, That they thought it most highly important, to depute me extraordinari∣ly

 towards the Parliament of the Commonwealth of 
England,
 and towards this Venerable Coun∣cil, to represent to them the true State of things, so much the rather, because having the honour to assist in two Assemblies, namely that of the States General, and of the States of 
Holland
 and 
West-Friesland,
 I have a full knowledge of their most secret and most weighty Affairs, and that by consequence, I am able to assure them, that there never was any Project form'd, any Resolu∣tion taken, nor any Commission given directly or indirectly, to offend the Republick of 
Eng∣land,
 and to give them any just Cause of Jea∣lousie, and much less, to go and attack their Fleets: But rather on the contrary, it was or∣dered. That wheresoever our Men should meet with those of that Nation, they should treat them as true Friends; tho in the fatal rencoun∣ter we have newly mentioned, things hapned quite otherwise, of which I gave yesterday a Relation ample and particular enough to suf∣fice at present, because it is not convenient to be so often Renewing the Memory of past things that ought to be buried in eternal oblivion, in the mean while, finding by the last answer gi∣ven to our Ambassadors, that you pretend satis∣faction for what is past, and assurances for the future; and besides the States, my Mrs. Judg∣ing it Requisite first to remove all preventions and mistaken prejudices concerning what is past; and that the two Republicks should endeavour to find out means to secure them against the like accidents for the time to come, that the Treaty of Alliance already in good forwardness be without interruption, carried on, that besides, the surest means imaginable be provided to pre∣vent all suspicion and distrust, and that a stand∣ing order be establisht according to which the Naval Armies on both sides shall be obliged to Regulate themselves, concerning which points I

 have received the necessary instructions from my Mrs. I intreat you Gentlemen, to be pleased to name some of your Illustrious Body, to treat with me out of hand concerning the affairs in Question. I must add to all I have just now asserted, that the States never had any thoughts to dispute with the Republick of 
England,
 that Grandure and Sovereign power that distin∣guishes it with so much Glory from all the o∣ther Republicks of 
Europe;
 Heartily wishing besides, that by the Union of two such potent States as 
England
 & 
Holland,
 the two Republicks may contribute to the mutual preservation of one another, be secured against the Conspira∣cies of their Enemies, and assure to themselves a firm and lasting Peace. In the mean while I pray you to give order by your Wise Conduct as soon as possible, that the mischief caused by that unfortunate Rencounter, may not be increased by new Hostilities committed against the Ships of the States; but rather that you would strait∣ly forbid the same, without staying till the sore be grown incurable, and till by that, we awake the drooping hopes of our Enemies; being per∣swaded, that we shall find out effectual means to reconcile us, to the shame and confusion of those that are jealous of our prosperity and common fe
icity. I shall be most sensibly oblig∣ed to this August assembly, if they will please to give me a speedy answer, that so without los∣ing time, I may fall to work upon a business of so great advantag
 and importance, recommend∣ing my self in the mean time with all possible respect, to your Benevolence.




Two days aft
r, the Mr. of the Ceremonies gave notice to 
 
eemsted,
 that the Par∣liament had ap
 
 
mmissioners to Treat with him. And 
 
ence being thereupon entred into, Mr. 
s
ed
 begun with declaring

 to the Commissioners. 
That the States had ne∣ver given any cause of Complaint to the Re∣publick of 
England,
 but rather all the demon∣strations of a true and sincere Amity; that their intention could not be doubted of, since it was Notorious, that it had been always such in time past, and should be so for the time to come, that if there had hapned any thing that seemed contrary to that intention, it ought not to be imputed to the States, as an offence proceeding from them, nor any occasion taken upon that account, to attempt any thing against their Sub∣jects, but that generously forgetting on both sides what was past, Provision ought to be made for their mutual security, by giving the neces∣sary Orders to prevent the like accidents for the future; unless the Parliament should think it fitter to name Commissioners on both sides, to make a through scrutiny into the Business in dispute, and above all, to enquire who was the Aggressor. That their High and Mighti∣nesses in case 
Tromp
 should be found to have begun first, would not only disown his Conduct, as contrary to their Orders, but would cause him to be severely punish'd, but that if on the contrary, 
Blake
 should be convinced of having been the Aggressor, the Parliament was likewise obliged to Chastise him; so that by that proceeding it would be known, not only what was the real intention of their High and Mightinesses, but an assured way would thereby be laid open, to pacifie all troubles, after the Example of seve∣ral other States and Republicks, who have suc∣cessfully practised the like Expedients. That their High and Mightinesses never had the least thoughts of making any encroachment up∣on the Grandure of the British Nation, in any way to Diminish it, but that after the late un∣happy Rencounter, they had given new Orders, that for the future, at the approach of any of

 their Fleets, or Ships of War, the same honours should be rendred to the Parliament in the point of the Flag, that had been usually paid to that Nation during the preceeding Reigns, hoping by that means, both Parties would have reason to rest satisfied; that the Treaty of Al∣liance about which, the States Ambassadors had declared the intention of their Mrs. in several Conferences, might be at length continued and that it would please the Council likewise to de∣clare their intention that the differences being once known, the obstacles that hindred an ac∣commodation might be removed, and a happy conclusion of an Eternal Alliance and inviolable Friendship might be obtained; that an end might be put to all Acts of Hostility, and a Restitution be made of all the Ships and effects belonging to persons that were Innocent in the matter. That for that end, he prayed the Council to be pleased to declare their Resolu∣tion concerning the points abovementioned, and principally concerning the continuation of the Treaty that was begun, the Cessation of Ho∣stilities, and the Releasing of the Ships and Per∣sons seized, and so much the rather because they had not delayed a moment to inform the Coun∣cil of State of the good intentions of their High and Mightinesses.


This Conference passing the 24th. they had a second the next day, which was followed by a third the 27th. of the same Month in which Mr. 
Heemsted
 pressingly demanded a positive answer, adding to what he had already advanced the fol∣lowing propositions. 
viz.


That the States were still in the same mind, to live in perfect Union with the Republick of 
England;
 that upon that consideration, they had promised their protection to the 
English
 Company in 
Holland,
 in case the troubles should

 happen to increase, that he on either side that had transgressed his Commission in the late fight near 
Dover,
 should be obliged personally to an∣swer for it, that it might be no cause of a Rupture between the two Nations; that in or∣der to pacifie all things, Commissioners should be appointed on both sides, to make a strict en∣quiry into all that had past, and that they who should thereupon be found guilty, should ac∣cording to the Maxim, of all other States, be punish'd, as Authors of the Misfortunes and Calamities of the people, that the Ships of War on both sides, being ordered when they meet one another at Sea, to behave themselves as formerly they used to do, there would happen no more disputes for the future about that Subject, that when a perfect Union should be once establish∣ed between the two Republicks, very great ad∣vantages would undoubtedly result from thence for their mutual defence and preservation.


On the 29th. the Council of State having ex∣amined all these Reasons,
 gave the following an∣swer to Mr. 
Heemsted,
 viz. 
That he might well enough see what was the intention of the Parlia∣ment, by the answer given to the three Memori∣als of the other Ambassadors, before his arrival, since nothing had been proposed since, neither by him nor any other, that was capable to make the Parliament change their Resolution; that if the attempt made by the
 Holland 
Fleet, as much by surprize as it was had succeeded according to their hopes, it might have been said, that the Common∣wealth of
 England 
would have seen it self plung∣ed into the greatest disasters imaginable, and that therefore it was not reasonable, after they had been so miraculously preserved, they should expose them∣selves again to the like disgraces for the future. That they could not suffer themselves to be any longer amused under the specious pretence of an Ex∣amen, or by Examples not pertinent to their Case,

 of what other States may have done; but that ra∣ther they were resolved to employ those means which necessity and the Nature of the Fact Require to be used; that besides, they could not consent to the Conclusion of a Treaty of Alliance, till they had received satisfaction about the point in Question, and that as to the demonstrations of a sincere and real Friendship from their High and Mightinesses, which their Ambassadors so much boasted of: The
 English 
on their side likewise had no less reason to value themselves upon the Authentick proofs they have given of the like to the
 Hollanders, 
ei∣ther in general or particular; and that in a word, they could not change any thing in the Answer they had already given them.


Mr. 
de Heemsted
 having received this Answer, demanded on the 1st. of 
July
 a new Conference, in which he Renewed his instances, by declaring, 
That there never had past any thing on the States side that was capable to give any just cause of jea∣lousie to the
 English; 
That they had proposed an assured way, to prevent all sorts of Contestation, and to discover the truth, but that they would not follow it, and that a Manifest injustice was done to his Mrs. That it was very easie to Judge of that by the refusal the States had made to their Subjects, notwithstanding the pressing solicitations used by them for that purpose, to grant them any Letters of Reprisal; that lastly to shew, they were wholly inclined to Peace, they had promised their Protection to the
 English 
Company at
 Rotterdam; 
that if the
 English 
persisted to Reject all the fa∣vourable means to procure an Accommodation, it would cause a great Consternation amongst the peo∣ple of
 Holland; 
That in fine, he therefore pray∣ed the Council of State, to be pleased to propose some other means themselues, and in the mean while, to forbid all Acts of Host
l
ty, and to Release the Ships that had been taken.


After this last Conference, Mr. 
de Heemsted


 seeing they neglected to give him an answer; de∣livered another writing to the Councel of State, by which he Represented the Eminent danger that threatned the two Republicks, by the mischiefs that would undoubtedly follow upon their Re∣fusal to accept the means he had proposed, ad∣ding, that he desired them to propose some other of their own if it were possible, that might be more effectual.


The Parliament could no longer Recoil,
 but at last proposed the following Articles as a ground for the Re-establishment of a Peace: 
viz.


1. 
That the States General of the Ʋnited Provinces should be obl
ged to pay to the Republick of
 England, 
a compensation towards the indemnifying them for the losses they had sustained by the Arming of the
 Hol∣land 
Fleet, and by the attempt they had lately made upon them, of which the particularities should be reported at large, in time and place.


2. 
That presently after the payment of the said sum, the Parliament should surcease all Acts of Hostility against the
 Hollanders, 
and all Ships seiz∣ed since the last troubles, should be released.


3. 
That these two Conditions being first agreed to, and put in Execution, they would proceed to a Treaty of Alliance which should straightly Ʋnite the two Republicks together, render their interests common, and their Friendship perpetual, and in∣violable, and that for this effect, the Parliament would be always Ready to accept all just and re∣sonable ways proposed to them.


The Ambassador of the States being astonish'd at such an answer, demanded on the 6th. of 
July
 a new Conference, wherein he Represented, 
That their High and Mightinesses had been obliged to make an Extroardinary armament, and to be at Excessive Expences for the Reasons he had already mentioned; that their Subjects had suffered considerable damages by the taking of a great many
 Holland 
and
 French 
Ships; that the States

 and their Merchant Subjects still felt the losses that had been caused to them, that if they would needs stand upon the point of indemnifying, they needed only to compare the losses of the one Nation with those of the other, to be convinced, that the States General had been the greatest sufferers, which would be easy to demonstrate, provided the business were not spun out to too great a length, by an over Cap∣tious discussion; That if the said Commissioners would on their side make a just and Reasonable esti∣mation, It would then plainly appear, that the true in∣tention of their High and Mightinesses is to ter∣minate things by an amicable way. As concern∣ing the Treaty of Confederacy, between the two Republicks, and the mutual assistance they might afford one another upon occasion, in case their com∣mon Enemies should go about to attempt upon their liberty, the States other Ambassadors had suffici∣ently before explain'd the intentions of their Mrs. upon that Subject, being always ready to pursue the said Treaty, if it would be consented to: That if the said Commissioners should think fit to render that Treaty more ample and Authentick, it would be a very agreeable thing to him, and that he passi∣onately desired they would please to give him all possible instruction imaginable thereupon. That more∣over, he thought it would be highly important if not very necessary, that orders should be given to the two Fleets not to come near one another, and that they might not come to any new Engagements, as 'twas to be feared they otherwise would; And that besides that, he insisted, that they would with∣out delay release the Ships that were seized, that so their Spirits being once calmed, the two Na∣tions might be 
indly disposed of themselves, and without any Constraint, to the concluding of a firm, solid, and unmoveable Alliance, that in fine, He waited with the greatest impatience for a favoura∣ble answer to all he had j
st then proposed, that so being animated with the hopes of a happy suc∣cess,

 he might employ his industry with the States to endeavour to find out proper means to effect an Accommodation; that he desired it the more ear∣nestly, because he was obliged to obey the Orders of his Mrs.


The Council of State, made answer,
 
that hav∣ing maturely Examined the writing delivered by Mr.
 de Heemsted 
Ambassador Extroardinary from the States General of the Ʋnited Provinces into the hands of the Commissioners, and having found nothing in it that answered clearly or directly to the last proposition made to his Excellency by the Parliament the Council demanded of him a speedy and positive answer, at least to the first Article, which being granted, they would apply themselves to the fixing a moderate and Reasonable sum, that so af∣ter that, they might proceed to the Execution of the second Article, by the restitution of the Ships seized, and the suspension of all acts of Hostility; And that as for the third Article, it should be ta∣ken care of afterward more at Leisure.


The 7th of 
July,
 the Sieur 
de Heemsted
 de∣manded another Conference in pursuance of the orders he had received from his Masters, ad∣ding, that if the Republick of 
England
 would not openly declare themselves, he would demand his Audience of Leave, and that with so much the more Justice; because instead of an Accommoda∣tion with which they had flatter'd themselves, the Parliament had given orders to their Fleet, to destroy the 
Dutch
 Herring Fishery, and to sink all 
Holland
 Ships, whilst to the Northward they were watching for our Ships that were return∣ing from the 
Indies.
 He represented therefore in that Conference,


That whilst he was busied in answering the Writing that was delivered him by Mr. 
Oliver Fleming
 from the Council of State, he had with much displeasure been informed, that the English

 Fleet was put to Sea, in order to some enterprize; That he had likewise received Letters, by which the States his Masters had ordered him, that since he had used all his endeavours to no purpose, to obtain a Cessation of acts of Hosti∣lity, he should demand his Audience of Leave, in order to return with all diligence into 
Holland,
 to give the States an account of his Negotiati∣on. And therefore in Obedience to the Or∣ders of his Mrs. he damanded, he might be per∣mitted to take his leave of the Council of State, the next day, and might for his Transportation make use of the man of War commanded by Captain 
John Verbaaf,
 in which he came into 
England.
 That the said Captain might be pro∣vided with a Passport, that he might not be mo∣lested in his way by the Parliaments Ships: Adding, that because the other Ambassadours had signified to him, that they had likewise or∣der to retire, he desired they might be permit∣ted to take their Audience of Leave at the same time, and to provide themselves with Ships ne∣cessary to transport their persons and Equipages. The Council of State answered, That they were obliged first to make their Report to the Parliament who were to sit the next day, or the 
Tuseday
 following after the Memorial was delive∣red from the States Ambassador Extraordinary to the Commissioners; And that till then they could give no other Answer to the said Ambassador.


But that on the 8th of 
July
 Mr 
de Heemsted
 pre∣sented to the Council of State, two Memorials: The first of which was conceived in these Terms.


The Ambassadour Extraordinary of the States,
 having seen the Answer given by the Council to his last Proposition, has thought fit to declare a new that he intended as soon as he came back into 
Holland,
 in consequence of the Overture made to him for that purpose, to apply his whole endeavours to find out some

 proper means for the Reuniting the two Nati∣ons, and dissipating all the Umbrages that seemed then to render them irreconcilable, that having at length attained to that happy Union so necessary for their common Security, there might be no
hing able to disturb them: And as that Resolution was full of sincerity, and aimed only at the tranquility and happiness of the two Republicks, so it was accordingly expedient, to prevent by a diligent execution, some Evils that other∣wise would grow incurable, if they were not stopt in their very Source, That upon this con∣sideration, he requested, the Council would be pleased to order, he might be speedily dispatcht, by granting him his Audience of Leave, and the necessary Passports for his Ship that waited for him at 
Gravesend;
 and that being perswa∣ded, That the Council of State would have regard to his Quality and Character, he dar'd to flatter himself, they would render him the same Honours at his Audience of Leave as were done him at his Entry, and for which he was very much obliged to the Council.


The other Memorial imported,
 that the Am∣bassador Extraordinary of the States found it necessary to Represent to the Council, That if they thought it fit, after he should have made his Report to their High and Mightinesses, he de∣sired his Secretary, or some other trusty Person, might come back to 
London,
 to maintain a Cor∣respondence together, whether by delivering or receiving to and from the two States, all that might any way conduce to the re-establishing a strict Alliance and perfect Union between them: And that in order thereunto, it would please the Council, to Grant the necessary Passport for the security of that Person; That he should al∣so have permission to stay at 
London
 so long as the Parliament, or the States should think fit; or else that the Council would name some per∣son

 themselves, whom they thought fit to receive the Letters that should be written to that pur∣pose, and to solicit their Answers.
 But they made no Reply to this last Proposal, how equi∣table soever it appeared, as being jealous that un∣der that Covert some Dangerous Intelli∣gence might be carried on against them in fa∣vour of the pretensions of the Family of the 
Stu∣arts.
 The three other Ambassadors presented like∣wise to the Council of State the following Memori∣al, on the 8th of 
July. That since the Ambassa∣dours of the States General had Orders by the last Letters they received, to Retire without delay, to go and give an account of their Negotiation to the States their Masters, they therefore prayed the Council, they might be permitted to take their Audience of Leave of that August Assembly, and that accordingly Ships necessary for their Trans∣portation and that of their respective Equipages, together with Passports for their security might be granted them; adding, that there were some Ships of their Nation ready for that purpose, as Captain
 de Boet, 
and three other Ships of
 Dort.


The Republick of 
England
 fortifying every day more and more their Authority, began to render themselves insupportable, by their excessive Pride and Haughtiness. For 
Sweden
 and 
Denmark,
 se∣veral Princes of 
Italy,
 the Hanse-Towns of 
Ger∣many
 and other Free Cities of 
Europe
 were for∣ced to acknowledge their up-start Government. And they troubled themselves not much about the States Ambassadors, as the scornful disdain they shewed of all their Remonstrances was a visible proof, so that no body was surprized at all to see with what facility they granted them their Audience of Leave. They consented that two of their Men of War should Convoy them, and two other Ships Transport their Equipages. And so the next day the fear Ambassadors were conducted to their Audience, and Mr. 
de Heemsted
 made

 the following Discourse, in the name of them all.


The States General of the United Provinces have sent their Ambassadors Extraordinary to the Parliament of the Republick of 
England,
 to en∣deavour by all sorts of ways to induce them to renew the ancient Amity between the two Na∣tions, and to confirm more straitly their Alli∣ance. They were followed a little while after by Mr. 
Nieuport
 a Member of the States of 
Holland
 and 
Westfriesland
 who was sent to clear some diffi∣culties, and to give a more Authentick proof of their Good Intentions concerning the Treaty of Confederacy.


In fine, it pleased their High and Mightinesses some days after, to make yet another Extraor∣dinary Deputation, and to make choice of me for that, with Express Order to come and give the Republick of 
England,
 new, more particu∣lar and stronger Assurances of a faithfull and sin∣cere Amity, in order to dispel all Umbrages and all Subjects of misunderstanding, and to prevent all Obstacles that might hinder the Execution of so laudable a Design.


For that effect, it was proposed. That an en∣quiry should be made by some judicious persons on both sides, into the Action that lately passed between the two Fleets, and which happened not by any premeditated design, but by pure acci∣dent, that so according to their Verdict, satis∣faction might be given to the Party offended. For we Protest before God, and before Men, and in presence of the Parliament of the Repub∣lick of 
England,
 That the States our Masters never had it in their thoughts, to offend this Republick, and much less to commit any act of Hostility against it. But that they were more disposed by a sence of a true and sincere affection, to contribute to the maintaining a stable and

 good understanding and inviolable Peace between them.


But since unfortunately in spite of the steps that have been made, and the pains taken, to pacifie all these Troubles, the two Ambassages have proved ineffectual, and frustrated of the hopes they had with so much justice conceived, and that, by new Disputes that have arisen and caused great losses; and that besides, the States are threatned with new Hostilities from the Par∣liaments Fleet, without having had the least no∣tice given them of it: The Ambassadors thought themselves obliged in prudence to prevent the Storm, and to retire into their own Country, as well to go and give an account of their Ne∣gotiations, as to take new Instructions from the States their Masters. For this end, we present our selves all together before this August Assem∣bly to give them notice, That we have received order to retire, and are upon the point of our departure.


We have already represented to the Council of State what things are necessary for our departure, with Respect to the Juncture of time and our Character, and we wait their Answer.


In the mean while, it is not only our Duty but a point of Justice to intreat you, that all our Ships that have been brought into the Ports of 
England,
 or been stopt there before the publica∣tion of any Declaration of War, without any offence given by any of the Masters of the said Ships, may at last be released with all their Men, that they may pursue their intended Voyages, without being molested in any manner whatsoe∣ver; and that all be done according to our ancient Friendship, and the Law of Nations practised among Christians. We hope the Justice of the Soveraign Republick of 
England
 will not refuse us a demand so equitable as this.




Moreover, we Implore the Protection of Heaven, and beseech God, the Author of Peace, that he will please of his Goodness to inspire the Par∣liament of this Republick with such Sentiments as may induce them to a Speedy Reconciliation with the States of the United Provinces, for the maintenance of the Reformation whose firmest sup∣port, and most solid foundation has always been Peace, in the Bosom of which it Flourishes, and quietly enjoys Prosperity, and which, on the con∣trary, if our Troubles should continue any longer, would see it self brought to an inevitable De∣struction, and plunged into the greatest Mise∣ries. We still pray God to be pleased to avert the Course of the Mischiefs and Calamities that accompany War; and to pour forth his precious Blessings upon the two Republicks.


And as we are ordered to retire forthwith into 
Holland,
 we shall accordingly take leave of this Illustrious Assembly, with all imaginable thanks for the kindnesses we have received from them, in full confidence, that they will not refuse us the things we have already demanded of them, and which are every where granted to Ambas∣sadors, in regard to their Character, for the se∣curity of their Persons.


Lastly, we recommend to you the 
Dutch
 Mer∣chants residing at 
London,
 or elsewhere within this Kingdom, that their Goods and Persons may be taken into the Protection of the Parliament.


These were the steps made by the States Gene∣neral of the United Provinces, to prevent a Rup∣ture with 
England,
 by which, all the world may judge, how great the Power of that new hatcht State was, tho scarcely yet fledg'd, to make them so Courted by a Nation that at that juncture, more fear'd than lov'd them, and how great and presumptuous their pride was too, in refusing such fair offers and venturing to engage in a

 War with so potent an Enemy, as the States of 
Holland,
 when their own settlement at home was so unsecure. But the flames were blown up on both sides, by the secret friends of the 
Stuarts,
 and by the Emissaries of those Nations that en∣vied to both people, both their Religion, and a∣bove all, their formidable Power at Sea, and their flourishing and universally extended Com∣merce; by some of whom, out of the same mali∣cious principles, the same fire, that was but rak't up for a while, in Embers, was rekindled, and set a burning with a more pernicious vio∣lence than ever, to the manifest increase of a Third Power, that tho before, it durst scarce peep out at Sea, has since appeared a formidable Enemy even upon their own Element, to those Redoub∣ted Masters of the Ocean, and has had the inso∣lence for a while by its dextrous managing of inte∣stine Factions among us, to Brave both our Fleets, till like 
Capaneus
 defying 
Jove,
 its Marine Forces were at length by the magnanimous 
Russel
 and his Valiant Copartners, the 
Dutch
 Admirals, Thunder-struck, and in a manner quite driven off the usurped Main, daring never since to appear on it otherwise than only as Rovers, and sculking Pirates.


On the 11th of 
July,
 that is to say, four days after the 
English
 Fleet set sail for the North Sea, to go and destroy the 
Dutch
 Fleet of Herring Busses, and to watch for their Ships coming back from the 
Indies,
 the Ambassadors departed 
Lon∣don,
 and on the 13th near 
Schouwen,
 met with Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 to whom Mr. 
de Heemsted
 gave a Memorial containing an account of the Forces of 
England;
 he likewise informed him, that Admiral 
Ayschew,
 who but a little be∣fore had given chase to a Merchant Fleet of about 30 or 40 sail between 
Callis
 and 
Swartenes,
 home∣ward bound from St. 
Hubes,
 and 
Portugal,
 was then in the 
Downs,
 with a Squadron of 21 Men of War, where he might be easily attackt and Beaten.




Tromp
 having received Express Orders from the States, who found themselves obliged to make use of Reprizals, not to spair the 
English
 any longer, but to do them all the mischief he could, resolved to go and attack 
Ayschew.
 Vice Admi∣ral 
Evertsz,
 had the Command of the Van, with a Squadron of 21 Ships of War; Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 Commanded the main Body of the Fleet, consisting of 30 Ships; and Rear Admiral 
Florisz,
 the Rear, composed of 28 Men of War. But there happening a Calm, and after that a contrary Wind, it was impossible for them to execute that project. 
Tromp
 therefore steer'd his Course towards the North, in search of 
Blake. Ayschew
 kept close in the 
Downs,
 whilst 
Blake
 with a Fleet of between 66 and 68 Sail, having discovered before 
Boeknes,
 the Herring-Fleet, un∣der the Convoy of 12 Ships or Frigats carrying from 22 to 30 Guns, caused them to be attackt by a Squadron of 20 men of War that compo∣sed his Vanguard: The Fight was sharp, and lasted above three whole hours, till at last the weaker was forced to give way to the stronger. Captain 
Venhuysen,
 and all the Herring Busses excepting four fled away; Ten of them were taken, whereof two sunk, after they had made all the resistance imaginable, and another was at last quitted by the Enemy. 
Blake
 joyned five of them to his Fleet, and sent three of them to 
In∣verness,
 with his wounded Men; but those of the 
Dutch
 were conducted to the 
Texel.


The States to Varnish over their Arms with all the Colour of Justice they could, publisht a Manifesto, setting forth the Reasons why they had declared War against the 
English;
 and they did the same on their side against the 
Hollanders.
 We shall repeat neither of them here, because they are to be found in several places, and that 'tis easie to guess by what has been said, what were the contents of them: And because our de∣sign

 is, to insist only upon relating the Bloody Battels that were fought between these two potent Republicks, and in which the Hero's of this Hi∣story, the two 
Tromps,
 Father and Son, had the most share.


The 
English
 had already seized upon the Isle of 
Inseith,
 where the 
Hollanders
 used to water, and these, latter advancing towards the Coasts of 
Scotland,
 arrived near 
Fulo
 and 
Fairhill,
 where they espi∣ed 
Blake,
 who was watching for our Ships com∣ing back from the 
Indies.
 The two Fleets were disposing themselves for a Fight, when in the night between the 5th and 6th of 
August,
 the Skie grew dark by little and little, and soon after there appear∣ed certain presages of a violent Tempest:
 For the wind having long been shifting about, turned at last to the 
N. N. West,
 and blew with so much im∣petuosity, that our Sails were all rent and torn in pieces, and the Waves rowl'd through them, and so went and spent themselves against the Rocks of 
Hitland,
 throwing their Fome up to the very Heaven. Thus the Fleet being as 'twere buried by the violence of the Sea, in most horrible Abysses, rose out of them only to be tost up to the very Clouds. Here the Masts were beaten down into the Sea, there the Deck was over-flown by the prevailing Waves: Here the Tempest was so much Mistress of the Ships, that they could be no longer governed, and on another side, ap∣peared all the doleful fore-runners of a dismal Wrack. And the Darkness increasing the danger, and the confused cries of the Mariners redoub∣ling the common fear, both together made the saddest and most frightful spectacle, that was e∣ver seen.


When the day was come, the disorder was clearly discovered: Two Ships were found ram∣ed in between two Rocks, and the Shattered Re∣licks of three Fireships, that were separated from the Fleet by the violence of the Waves, left no

 manner of Room to doubt of their being lost. But Providence that presides over all Events sweet∣ned these Evils to our men, by the happy arri∣val of three 
Indian
 Ships, and of several others that were coming from the Islands call'd, the 
An∣tilles,
 who unexpectedly fell into our Fleet, where∣of some put into 
Schalloway,
 others made to the South-West of 
Hitland,
 some others to the West, and the rest to the North of the same Island. In the mean while 
Tromp
 went before, sailing to∣wards, the 
Meuse,
 with a Fleet of 39 sail, and one of the Ships come from the 
Indies;
 And in the Latitude of 
Scotland,
 he discovered 
Blake
 with 62 Great Ships much less damaged then his own, because that by a great happiness for him, the Tempest having driven him to the North∣ward of 
Hitland,
 he found on that side, more Shelter, as soon as 
Tromp
 espied him, he dis∣posed himself to stay for his coming up to him, with intention to present him battle. But 
Blake
 either being loath to lose the Weather-Gage, or for some other Reasons unknown, would not ac∣cept it. Soon after, observing that 
Tromp
 was sheer'd off into the main Sea, in order to pur∣sue his first intended course, he likewise fell down towards the 
Meuse,
 having done nothing with his so potent Fleet, but scattered the Herring Fish∣ers, destroyed their Convoy, and taken two 
Zea∣land
 Ships that were cruizing in those Seas, and which fell by chance into his Fleet, but who had first destroyed him two of his Frigats. The rest of the 
Holland
 Fleet after they had spent some weeks in refitting, entred happily into the 
Vlie
 and the 
Texel
 at the beginning of 
September.
 Whilst 
Tromp
 was out at Sea, the States General resolv∣ed to set out another Fleet, besides, both to se∣cure their Merchant Ships, render Navigation more Free, and put themselves into a Condition the more powerfully to oppose the 
English.
 This Re∣solution taken, they were next to seek for a Man

 Recommendable for his fidelity and Experience to vest with the Command of it. The States of 
Zealand
 cast their Eyes upon 
Michael Adri∣an de Ruiter,
 well known by his great Reputa∣tion, but he having no inclination to go any more to Sea, had resolved to pass the rest of his days in Peace and Repose. Some members of the State having represented to him, that his Country then stood in pressing need of his Service, he answer∣ed them, that his intention was to live in Tran∣quility, and to meddle no more with any Sea affairs. But they pressed it to him again, telling him, that such a man as he, that had given so many Sig∣nal proofs of his Bravery, and of his Zeal for his Country, ought not now to refuse at a dead lift, to give it the last marks of his stedfast affection that were desired of him, especially since, he would be only obliged to go as 'twere a ro∣ving. So that at last he let himself be perswa∣ded, and went on Board the Ship called the 
Nep∣tune,
 carrying 28 Guns, and 134 Men. But the Fleet that was to assemble at 
Wielingen,
 was forced to stay some time for several Men of War which were at the 
Texel,
 and other Ports. 
De Ruiter
 being embark'd on board the 
Neptune,
 put to Sea, and arrived on the 10th. of 
August
 at the Fleet which was then but 15 sail of Men of War, and 2 Fire-ships. Some days after ha∣ving received a Reinforcement of 7 men of War and 2 Fire-ships, he set sail towards the Strait of 
Callis,
 according to the Order he had recei∣ved from the States for that effect. His Com∣mission was, to Convoy along the Channel the Merchant Fleet that was then in the 
Texel,
 rea∣dy to set sail to the West-ward, and afterwards to Cruize about the Channel to pick up the Ships that were coming from divers parts of 
Europe,
 and Conduct them into 
Holland.
 For that purpose Order was likewise given to the Merchant Fleet in the 
Texel,
 to speed away to 
Wielingen,
 to en∣deavour

 to joyn the Fleet of Men of War, or at least to go and seek them out towards the Strait of 
Callis,
 or in the Channel. In the mean while 
De Ruiter
 received advice by two Boats la∣den with 
Dutch
 Prisoners that had been taken on board some Ships that were stopt before the Rupture, but were discharged by the Parliament, that passing by near the 
English
 Fleet between the Isles of 
Wight
 and 
Portland,
 they found it 46 sail strong, of which about 12 were of a pro∣digious bigness. 
De Ruiter,
 writ word of it to the Admiralty of 
Zealand
 complaining of the piteous condition in which he found the Ships of his Fleet, and Representing to their High and Mightinesses, that he needed greater Forces, to form any enterprize, and to attack the Enemy pursuant to the Orders he had received. He kept himself sometimes below 
Swarteness,
 and after∣wards Cruizing along the Channel, he advanc'd as far as the 
Cingles.
 During all which time, he sent out from day to day, several light Frigats to inform themselves of the Countenance of the 
English,
 and to look out for the 
Texel
 Fleet. On the 21st. of 
August,
 8 Men of War, and 50 Merchant Ships, under the Command of 
Gideon Verburg
 joyned 
De Ruiter
 West-ward of 
Grave∣ling;
 the same day he writ another very pres∣sing Letter to the States, in which he desired them to send him some Ships of bigger Force, and better appointed for War, because those he had were very ill Equip'd, being not furnish'd with half their Compliment of Guns and Men, especially those of the Province of 
Friesland.
 The following days he passed the Strait of 
Cal∣lis
 with the Merchant Fleet, and pursuing his way along the Channel, he advanced as far as the Latitude of 
Plymouth;
 but being near the Coast of 
France,
 on the 26th. of 
August,
 about 2 a Clock in the afternoon, the Wind at North-East, he perceived a Fleet of 45 sail to the North∣ward

 of that of 
Holland. De Ruiter
 imagining presently thereupon, that it was the 
English
 Fleet Commanded by Admiral 
George Ayschew,
 watch∣ing for the 
Dutch
 Merchant Ships, tackt about, and stood directly towards Admiral 
Ayschew,
 the 
English
 Fleet was composed of 40 Men of War, whereof 12 as we have said, were of an Extra∣ordinary bulk. For there were two of them of 60 Guns each, and 8 from 36 to 40, and besides them 5 Fireships. 
De Ruiter
's Forces consisted of 30 small Ships of War, and 6 Fire-ships. The greatest of those Ships had not on board above 30 Guns, excepting 2 of them, namly the 
Peace,
 and the 
Ostritch
 that carried each of them 40, and that were Equiped by the care of the 
Indian
 Chamber of 
Amsterdam,
 for the Service of the State; and the others had not half their Com∣pliment of Men; besides which disadvantage, 
de Ruiter
 was hampered with a Merchant Fleet of 60 sail, who were the principal mark at which the 
English
 levelled their designs. Some days be∣fore, 
de Ruiter
 had put all things in order, and divided his Fleet into 3 Squadrons, the first of which he himself Commanded, the second was under the Conduct of 
Vanden Brock,
 in quality of Vice-Admiral; and the third was under that of 
Verbaas
 in quality of Rear-Admiral. To each Squadron, he had joyned 2 Fire-Ships, ordering them to keep themselves in readiness upon the approach of the Enemies, to go and set fire to the biggest of their Ships. And for the Mer∣chant Ships, be placed them along the Fleet in such a manner as they might be most secure. About 4 a Clock in the afternoon they began to Fight.
 
De Ruite
 was in the main Body, Vice-Admiral 
Vanden Broek
 in the right Wing, and Rear-Admiral 
Ve
baa
 in the left. The Fight was fierce, and bloody. 
De Ruiter
 Fought twice through the 
English
 Fleet, and if he could but have gain'd the Weather-gage of which the Ene∣mies

 had the advantage, 'tis to be presumed, he would have entirely defeated them, especially, if the 
Dutch
 Fire-Ships that had the Wind against them, could have come up with them. He found him self Engaged for some time with but 6 or 7 of his Squadron, between the 
English
 Admiral and Vice-Admiral. The Rear-Admiral 
Verbaaf
 with the rest of the Fleet found themselves to the lee∣ward, and some of his Ships perform'd their du∣ty very ill, whilst the rest coming to Grapple with the Enemy, Fought in every respect with a Bravery that has few Examples.


The Night parted the Combatants, when the 
English
 making their way into the main Sea, e∣scaped to the Northward. It was impossible for 
de Ruiter
 to follow them, because many of his Ships were much endamaged, and that he had a Merchant Fleet besides to guard, whose Ships were scattered about here and there. The Event of that Fight extremely surprised 
de Ruiter,
 consi∣dering the inequality of his Forces to those of the Enemy; which made him crie out, 
That when the Arm of Almighty God was pleased to favour the Arms of the weaker side, by inspiring them with more than ordinary courage, the Victory was always on their side. And this work, added he, was carried on by God himself, for reasons that are hidden from us.


The 
Hollanders
 loss, according to their own report, was so very small, that 'tis hardly to be believed, they having lost none of their Ships, and having had but 50 or 60 men kill'd, and about as many wounded; whereas on the 
English
 side, it is pretended according to the most faithfull ac∣count, there were above a 1000 kill'd or woun∣ded, and two or three of their Ships lost.


The Memory of the remarkable Action done on this occasion,
 by one 
Douve Aukes
 a Native of 
Friesland,
 Captain on board the 
Ostritch
 be∣longing to the 
East-India
 Company, is worthy to

 be transmitted to all future Ages: For that brave man, finding himself encompass'd by the Enemies, and having fought till his Sea men dispairing to save themselves, would needs have forced him to yield up the Ship, taking up a stick with a light∣ed Match at the end, made offer to set fire to the Powder, crying out as loud as he could possi∣bly strain his Voice, 
Take courage, my Boys? take courage, I will sh
w you the way, and when you are able no longer to resist the Enemy, I will de∣liver you from prison, with the stick I hold in my hand;
 And he swore to them at the same time, that he would in earnest set fire to the Powder, if he heard them speak any more of yielding. Which undauntedness of their Captain, or rather the panick fear of an assured death, put such fresh courage and vigour into those cowardly wretches, that they promised him from that moment, an in∣violable obedience, adding, that they would fight to the last drop of their blood, and thereupon every one of them returning to his former post, and the brave 
Douve
 giving the Signal, he with but 24 Guns, attackt an 
English
 Ship of 40, and letting her come up just close to his side, he fought her so to purpose, that he sunk her with all her men; another Frigat of 50 Guns coming up likewise to him, was also sunk, and after that again, a third coming to assault him, was so be∣laboured, that she had much ado to hold up a∣bove water long enough to save her self in the first 
English
 port she could reach. It is reckon∣ed, there were in the two first Ships that perish'd above 800 persons, very few of which were sa∣ved. After the Battle, 
de Ruiter
 spent all the night in repairing the damages, the Ships of his Fleet had suffered; and that the Merchant Ships that were dispersed from him during the Fight might be able the better to rejoyn him, he put up lights in four different places on Board his Ship. The next morning at break of day; the

 
Hollanders
 having discovered the 
English
 Fleet at about 2 miles distance from them, 
de Ruiter
 Summoned all the Captains on Board him, to a Consultation, in which 'twas resolved, to pur∣sue the Enemies till Noon, with design, in case they stopt not, to send back the Merchant Ships into their own Country. They tackt then about to stand towards the 
English,
 which was con∣tinued till after Noon, to endeavour to draw them to a Battle, but not being able to bring them to it, towards the Evening the Merchant Ships were sent away under the Convoy of two Men of War, the rather because they were as∣sured, there were no more Enemies to be met with to the Westward.


The day following 
de Ruiter
 calling together all the Officers of the Fleet, told them,
 it was certain, that Admiral 
Ayschew
 was retired with his Fleet to 
Plymouth,
 after the Fight, to repair his damages there; and that for his part, he was of the mind, that 'twere best to go and attack him there, whilst he dreamt of nothing less than that, and whilst most of the Captains of his Fleet might be perhaps a shore to refresh themselves; that he flattered himself by the Divine protecti∣on, to be able totally to destroy them, before they should be in a condition to come themselves and attack him with fresh Forces; that the last Fight sufficiently shewed their small courage, and their weakness, and that therefore it was easy to Judge from thence, that if they were attackt now whilst they were still in that disorder and consternation, they might be entirely defeated without any great trouble; that they had Tri∣umphed over them even whilst they had yet a Mer∣chant Fleet of 60 sail to guard, tho' they were much superiour to them in strength, an
 had the Weather-gage, not to mention the Cowardice of several 
Holland
 Captains that were wanting in their duty; That those who were in the Num∣ber

 of these last would meet with a fine occa∣sion to repair their lost honour; that their Country and the Victors would thereby acquire immortal Glory, which would be so much the brighter, and carry the greater sound, because they would have defeated the Enemy upon their own Coasts; that such a loss as that would be very sensible to them: That the Justice of the cause for which the States had armed out that Fleet to Sea, and the Bravery of those who Com∣manded it, gave him already very hopefull pre∣sages of a Victory, and that in fine the Enemies would have the shame to see the shattered re∣licks of their last Engagement totally ruin'd and destroyed in their own Harbours.


All the Officers applauded this Speech of 
de Ruiter,
 and it was concluded in the Councel, to put this resolve in Execution with all the Expe∣dition imaginable. But when they were just go∣ing to attempt it, the night before, which was on the 30th. of the Month, the Wind changed to the South South East, and turned afterwards quite to the South. And then the Fleet was got within two miles of 
Goodstart,
 and was driven so fierce∣ly by the Wind that they were forc'd to quit that project, 
De Ruiter
 by Cruizing before 
Good∣start,
 had alarmed all those Coasts, and constrain∣ed 
Ayschew
 with all his Fleet to shut themselves up in their Harbours. At which time receiving advice from divers parts, that Admiral 
Blake
 past on the 30th. of the same Month near 
Bevezieck
 with a Fleet of 72 sail, to the Westward, with a design to make towards him to give him Battle, he thereupon judg'd it more Expedient for him to keep to the Westward of the 
English
 Fleet, because he found himself too weak to hazard a second fight.




The 22d. of 
September
 following, as he was still cruising, he was assailed hard by 
Sorles,
 by a furious Tempest that lasted three days together, and on the 3d. day the Wind being appealed, he would fain have given chase to a Squadron of 25 of the Parliaments Ships, and that very even∣ing he found himself already advanced within a mile of the English, with some Ships of his Fleet, but the biggest of them remained still scattered to and fro. The same night another fierce Wind arose, and again dispersed the Ships of his Fleet, so that he mist his blow. For what care soever 
de Ruiter
 could take all the time he was cruising in the Channel, to get his Ships together in a Body, yet he could never effect it. One morning he found them so very much scattered, that there were several of them that were three miles distant one from the other; and he was so much in wrath at it, that he could not forbear signifying to his Captains, that he was unhappy to have to do with Men that heeded not his Orders. Besides that, his Fleet began to be in want of many necessaries, and that which was most vexatious for 
de Ruiter,
 was that he saw himself in danger suddenly to be attackt by the whole power of 
England;
 upon which, having held a Council of War, it was there concluded, that since the Enemies were every where much stronger than they, it was to be feared, that being informed of their weakness, they would take their time to come and over∣whelm them; and that therefore to avoid that Misfortune, it was requisite they should with all diligence pass the Strait of 
Callis,
 in order to go and meet Vice-Admiral 
de Wit,
 who was coming that way with fresh Forces. On the 28th of the same month, advice was brought of his arri∣val, and on the 2d of 
October,
 the two Fleets joyned one another between 
Dunkirk
 and 
Newport.




The States had it seems thought fit to let Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
Tromp
 rest a while, and to give the Conduct of their Naval Army,
 that is, of all the Ships that were left of it, that were still in a condition to keep the Sea, after the Tempest of which we have spoken, to Vice-Admiral 
de Wit,
 in hopes that this latter would perhaps have better luck than 
Tromp
 had in his last ex∣pedition; and because many of the fickle Mobb begun to murmur at 
Tromp,
 and because he had not been so fortunate in his last undertakings, as they expected, to look upon it as a Judgment upon him, for being the cause of that Great War.


The States Commission to 
de Wit
 imported, that he should go and joyn 
de Ruiter. Blake
 had likewise received orders from the English Parli∣liament, to go and joyn 
Ayschew,
 who was retired to 
Plymouth
 after the loss of the last Battle, that they might endeavour to hinder the Junction of the two 
Holland
-Fleets; but the Wind proving contrary to them, it was impossible for them to oppose it. Vice-Admiral 
de Wits
 Fleet being 45 Sail strong when he joyned 
de Ruiter,
 after their Junction, it was resolved with all possible dili∣gence to sail away to the Westward. 
De Wit
 who had the chief Command of the whole Fleet, sent for the Captains that had served under 
de Ruiter
 in his absence, and carefully enquired of them in what condition their respective Ships were, and what necessaries they wanted, and found, that 10 of the Ships of that Fleet were disabled either by the late Fight or Tempest; so that it was thought requisite to send the said 10 Ships, and 5 Leaky Fireships that had lost most of their Sails and Rigging, back into 
Holland,
 with Orders to come and rejoyn the Fleet again so soon as they should be refitted. The 
Neptune
 that 
de Ruiter
 went in was one of that number, which obliged him to Remove into the 
Lovisa.




But we shall leave that Fleet for a moment, to entertain you with the Relation of one of the first Actions of the Hero that is the principal Subject of this History.


The States fearing their Commerce in the 
Le∣vant
 might be disturbed by the English, sent in∣to the 
Mediterranean
 Vice-Admiral 
Catz
 with a Fleet of 14 Men of War.
 He arrived the 7th. of 
July
 in 
Legorn
 Road; and 
Appleton
 who for fear of the 
Hollanders,
 put out a little before from 
Smirna,
 with a Squadron of 7 or 8 Men of War, was already arrived behind the Bason of 
Legorn,
 where he had cast Anchor.


Catz,
 willing to execute the Orders given him by the States, notified to the Governour of the place, That his Commission obliged him to Fight and attack all English Ships wheresoever he found them, but he had thitherto suspended the Execution of his orders in Confidence, that the Governour would not suffer the Ships to be unladen, for that if he offered to permit it, he should be obliged to oppose it by attacking them. The Governour made answer, That the Ports of the Great Duke of 
Tuscany
 his Master were open in general to all the World. After some contestations, the English at last un∣laded their Ships without any opposition from Vice-Admiral 
Catz,
 which gave occasion to the States, as ill satisfied at his Conduct, to recall him, and to send in his room, 
John de Galen,
 a Man of great Reputation for having signalized himself in divers Rencounters.


De Galen
 then went by Land to 
Legorn,
 and producing his Commission to the Fleet, it soon appeared what he was capable of, by the attempt he made upon the English Ships coming from the 
Levant,
 whilst on another side Captain 
Salingen
 kept 
Appleton
 blockt up. The 6th of 
September, de Galen
 discovered them between 
Elba
 and 
Monte Christo,
 and immediately used all the diligence imaginable to get up to them. That Fleet con∣sisted

 of 4 Men of War, and 4 Merchant-Ships under the Conduct of Commodore 
Bodley.
 And the States Fleet under the Command of 
de Ga∣len
 was 10 Sail strong of Men of War, of one of which, 
Cornelius Tromp,
 who was then but a private Captain, had the Command.


The English seeing it was impossible for them to escape, threw themselves into a Half-moon, and put themselves in order of Battle, between the two Islands just-now mentioned: Whilst 
de Ga∣len
 going personally to every Ship of his Fleet, did all he could to encourage the Seamen with the hopes of the Riches of the 
Levant,
 that was likely very soon to be their prey. The Captains at the same time burning with Ambition to signalize themselves, and to get tho it were but grinning Honour, at 3 a Clock in the afternoon, 
James de Boet
 the Dutch Reer-Admiral begun the at∣tack,
 and the Fight growing very hot on both sides, would yet have proved much more Bloody, if a Calm had not hindred the two Fleets from a Close-fight, and coming to Board one another. However they continued firing at one another till the beginning of the Night: When 
de Galen
 whose Ship had most of her Rigging endamaged, that his Fleet might not be scattered, and lose one another in the dark, hung out lights all night in two different parts of his Admiral Ship, 
viz.
 a double one in two Lantherns, upon his Poop, and another in a single Lanthern, above his Main∣mast Top.


The English kept themselves along by the Flatts towards 
Monte-Christo;
 where at Break of Day 
de Galen
 went with design to visit them, but finding himself weakned by the absence of 3 of his Ships which the Tide had carried away to the Leeward, it was impossible for him to execute his enterprize. In the mean while the 
English
 Merchant Ships taking this opportunity to cheat the greedy 
Dutch
 that had counted without their Host, of their

 desired prey, got out to Sea, and escaped; and then 
Bodley
 being not able to recoil any further for fear of running upon the aforesaid Flatts, threw his Ships again into a Half-moon, and stood firmly to receive the 
Hollanders,
 who were now but 7 Sail. 
De Galen
 coming up with 
Bodley
 gave him a Broad-side, which he answered with another. And after he had received 7 Cannon shot between Wind and Water, and was weakned by the loss of 17 Men killed and 27 dangerously woun∣ded, and had escaped the Flames three times, and had almost all his Sails and Rigging torn to pieces, yet he went for all that, and attackt another that was one of the biggest and strongest Ships the English had. Rear-Admiral 
de Boet
 who was in the 
Ʋnion,
 having attackt 
Bodley
 at his Prow, shot down his Main-mast close by the Board, which tumbled into the Sea. 
Wartsworth
 an Eng∣lish Captain seeing him thus disabled, advanced to take his Post, but Rear-Admiral 
de Boets
's Seamen finding opportunity to favour them, Boarded him, and in a moment made themselves Masters of the 
Phenix
 Frigat which he Commanded. But 
Bont
 and 
Swaart
 were not so fortunate, for tho they had grappled 
Bodley
 on each side they found so much resistance that they were forced to retire well mauled after a long and Cruel Fight, and the loss of both their Captains.


The English Admiral seeing himself thereby dis∣engaged, thought it best to flie while he might, and make the best of his way. But 
de Galen
 and some other Dutch Captains pursued him. 
Cor∣nelius Tromp
 on the other side, who had signali∣zed himself in the Fight, made it sufficiently ap∣pear by his undaunted bravery what might one day be expected from him; his Ship as well as 
de Boet
's having so extremely suffered, that they were fain to put into the Road of the Isle of 
Corsica
 to repair their damages.




After the Battel, 
de Galen
 took a very parti∣ticular care of his wounded Men, and caused the broken Masts to be pieced up, and all the Ships of his Fleet to be repaired, that they might be in a condition to give a second Battle to the Eng∣lish the next day. But they for fear of being pursued, retreated, towing away their Vessels without hanging out any lights all the Night. When day was come, they were descried near the Isle of 
Elba,
 and making their way with all dili∣gence, they were got already near 
Porto-Longone,
 before the Dutch could reach them. The 
Hol∣landers
 coming to an Anchor likewise in the same Harbour, designed to besiege them there, but the Governours Secretary 
John Ba
t
sta Brancattio,
 came to them and declared to them from his Master, that he would not suffer any acts of Hostility to be committed upon the Coasts of his Catholick Majesty, adding, that in that case he would fire at the Aggressor. And to shew he would be as good as his word, he had placed a strong Guard over a Battery of five pieces of Canon that was planted on the side of the Shore. Captain 
Tromp
 and Captain 
Blok
 going a shore to Com∣pliment 
Brancattio, Bodley
 permitted them like∣wise to go on Board him, and entertained them there with a great deal of Civility and kindness. They drunk together Admiral 
de Galen
's health, and when they went away, they were honoured with a Salute of five Guns.


A little time after the Fight, the same honours were done on Board the Dutch Admiral, to Cap∣tain 
Hoyen Cox,
 who came thither from the English. But for all these mutual Civilit
es that past betwixt them, each party was never the less watchful to seek their advantages, and to repair their battered Ships with all the diligence ima∣ginable, with design to get them as soon as pos∣sible, into a condition to be able to enter upon new enterprizes. 
De Galen
 having a mind to

 render the last duties to his Dead, The Gover∣nor 
Brancattio
 permitted him to bury them near to a Fountain which 
Frederick Barbarossa
 had caused to be built of white Marble, for the re∣freshment of his Ships when coming from 
Con∣stantinople,
 with a Naval Army he landed on the Coasts of 
Italy.
 The Bodies of the Vice Com∣mander, 
Jonge Hoen, Jans
 Bont,
 and 
Swart,
 were interred near the seven Fig-trees under the Rose∣mary, attended by 40 Musketeers, who paid se∣veral Vollies of Shot to the honour of the Me∣mory of those brave Captains, who newly died in the bed of Honour, for the service of their Country. After these Funerals were over, 
de Galen
 considering it would be but to lose time in vain, to stay any longer in that Harbour, resol∣ved to weigh Anchor in order to sail towards 
Legorn,
 thinking thereby to draw the English out of the secure Post in which they then were.


After having related what passed in the 
Me∣diterranean,
 we shall return to the Ocean. The States Fleet Commanded by Vice-Admiral 
de Wit,
 after the departure of the 10 Ships that were detacht from it, consisted of 64 Men of War, and that of the English under the Conduct of Admiral 
Blake
 was composed of 68. But the Ships of these latter were incomparably much bet∣ter furnisht for the War, than were those of the Dutch. 
De Ruiter,
 after he had well examined all things, found so great a difference between the Naval Army of 
Holland,
 and that of 
England,
 that he saw there was an utter impossility to be able to attempt any thing without exposing the Fleet of the United Provinces to an inevitable Ruine.
 But 
de Wit
 was of another mind, and assoon as ever he came to Sea, affected to let the World know, he had great designs in his Head. His ad∣vice was, to go and attack the English in the 
Downs,
 and according to that project, 
de Ruiter
 was to lead the Van-Guard; But the English having got∣ten

 ready sooner than 
de Wit
 imagined, appeared all on a sudden at Sea, the 2d of 
October,
 and com∣ing up directly to him with a fair wind, his sur∣prise was so great, that he had not time so much as to call a Council of War, besides, that he was in no readiness for a Fight, because that many of his Ships having been scattered here and there by a Tempest that had happened the day before, had not yet time to get together again.


Vice-Admiral 
de Wit
 seeing there was no fly∣ing back, sent by an Advice-Boat, to exhort all the Captains of his Fleet, to do their duty in their respective places. The fight begun at three a Clock in the Afternoon, and was fought at the entrance of 
Callis-strait. De Ruiter
 had the Van∣guard, 
de Wit
 the main Body of the Fleet, and 
de Wilde
 Commanded the Rear. And 
Evertz
 attended besides with a Body of Reserve, to be ready to give assistance to those that should have need. The two Fleets piercing one into the other plied one another hotly with the Thunder of their Cannon; the English loss being most in Men, and that of the Dutch in Sails and Rigging. 
De Ruiter
 and 
de Wit
 did wonders,
 but for all they could do, in a little time they were so rough∣ly handled, that they had much ado to turn themselves. 
De Ruiter
 had a great many killed and wounded; he had received four shot between Win
 and Water; the Main-yard of his Ship was over-turned to the left side, and his main and mizzen Sails, as well as his Rigging were all torn to pieces. Some Captains following his example, signalized themselves, whilst o
h
s gave all the marks of a shameful Coward
ce; and several kept at a great distance behind, 
ill night coming on and parting the Combatants, th
y could get to∣gether again by favour of th
 darkness of the night, in order to renew 
 
gain the next day, if the wind and opp
 
 
ved favour∣able to them. But the 
 
ceived in the

 night a Re-inforcement of 16 Great Ships which Admiral 
Ayschew
 brought from the 
Downs,
 where∣as the 
Hollanders
 found themselves weaker by 20 Ships, through the Cowardice of many Captains, who stole from the Fleet by favour of the darkness.


Notwithstanding all these disadvantages, Vice-Admiral 
de Wit
 was still obstinately bent to at∣tack the 
English,
 and was for that purpose, ma∣king towards them, when perceiving, that he should be but very slenderly back'd, he made a stop, In the mean while the Weather falling to a Calm, 
de Wit
 call'd together all the Gene∣ral and Under Officers of his Fleet to a Coun∣cil of War, to deliberate about the present State of affairs. 
De Ruiter
 and 
Evertz
 that were in joint Command with him, maintain'd, that 'twas a great Rashness, to expose the Fleet to so immi∣nent a danger; because their Ships were so much scattered one from the other, that it would be four a Clock in the afternoon, before the for∣wardest, and Dusk of night before the backwar∣dest of them could come up with the body of the Enemies Fleet; that the 
English
 had received a considerable Reinforcement, whereas the 
Holland∣ers
 on the contrary were grown weaker. That the former had a great advantage by their Fire-Ships, whereas they could make no use of theirs; that their Fleet was very ill manned, and a great many of their men sick and wounded, that two of their Ships had lost their Fore-Masts, that the Main-Mast of the Ship call'd the 
Prince William,
 was quite disabled, and many other Ships much endamaged; and in fine, that there would be no manner of tolerable reason to be alledged in ex∣cuse of so great a fault as it would be at that time, to put the States and the Government in imminent danger of ruin, by so rashly exposing their Fleet. All these reasons were too evident to be rejected; and therefore they tackt a∣bout

 to get away from the Enemies, only 7 Ships that were kept back by a contrary Wind, were forced to lag behind, and endure the Force of the 
English
 Admiral and his Squadron who had the Weather-gage of them, till the Dusk of Night, hut without any great damage. The 
D
tch
 Fleet then having thus made a Retreat under the favour∣able covert of the Darkness, Vice-Admiral 
de Wit
 who affected to shew courage out of season, cal∣led another Council of War, and proposed, that the Fleet should keep to the leeward, but all the Officers smelling out his design, Unanimous∣ly maintained, that it 'twas not at all advisable to stand another attack from the 
English,
 because they were too weak to cope with them, and it would he too great a hazard to venture it, but that it would be much safer to Retreat with all the sail they could, towards 
Goree,
 to recruit themselves, and to wait the Orders of the States.


It was impossible for 
de Wit,
 to oppose that Resolution, and so much the more because he plainly perceived, that many of his Captains were resolved to lie still, and be bare spectatours of a Fight to which they were no ways consenting, and that of all the whole Fleet there were but 15 Ships that he could trust upon, so suspicious to him was the fidelity of all the rest, so that there was no other way lest for him to take, but to make as fast as he could from the Enemy, which at last, tho' much against his stomach, that Bully-Admiral was fain to resolve upon; yet terribly fretted he was, to see himself so deserted at a time when his foolish Ambition flattered him, that he might have gained immortal Glory to himself and a great Triumph for his Country. So the Fleet made all the sail they could for 
Holland,
 and the 
Engl
sh
 pursued them till noon; but seeing 'twas but in vain, they tackt, and stood another Course. The same Evening the 
Dutch


 came in sight of the Isle of 
Schouwen,
 and on the 13th. of 
October
 got into 
Helvoetsluys.


The shamefull Cowardice of the Captains that had fled in such a Rencounter as that, was so much the more Criminal, because there was not so much as one ship lost in the Fight out of the whole Fleet. For one Ship that had all her sails and rigging shot away, yet got away in that sad condition, into the 
Meuse,
 and all the rest that had been battered, made a shift likewise to save themselves. It will not be impertinent to insert by the way the relation of a very Remar∣kable action. 
Broer Jaap,
 Captain of the Ship we told you, was so miserably maul'd, being Grappled with an 
English
 Frigat, had his Mizen-Mast and Bolt-sprit, and part of his Ships Head shot away; upon which, seeing himself in such a miserable and helpless condition, he leapt into a Boat and relinquish'h his Ship to the discretion of the Enemy. But a Gunner
 of the same Ship took up a lighted match and went down into the Powder room, crying out? 
my Comerades, is it possible, you should yield! Let us rather put fire to the Powder, and so we shall all be set at liberty;
 Which bold and desperate Resolution so frighted the 
English
 that had Boarded her, that they ime∣diately quitted the Ship, and left the Mr. quiet∣ly to Conduct her into the 
Meuse.


The States General, to remedy all these disor∣ders, took a Resolution, after they had well in∣formed themselves of the particulars of all that had passed, to punish those that had shewn any symptoms of Cowardice, and accordingly they had began to make an exact inquiry into the Beha∣viour of those Officers, but soon let it fall be∣cause on one side the Number of the Criminals was too great, and on the other the favour of powerfull interceeding friends prevail'd over the severity of Justice.




Tho' the 
English
 had had some disadvantage in the 
Mediterranean,
 yet were they not for that a whit the less venturous to endeavour to retakethe 
Phoenix
 which they had lost, and which young 
Tromp
 then was in, because his own Ship called, the 
Maiden
 of 
Enkuisen
 was so battered in the Battle of 
Elbaa
 and 
Monte Christo,
 that she was hardly able to keep the Sea. And they effected that enterprize with so much the more ease, because the 
Hollanders
 having taken some fresh Codd, were gotten into a debauch, and thought themselves secure enough in 
Legorn
 Road, to dispense with keeping of a good Guard.


Bodley
 and Captain 
Cox
 being informed of their Frolicksome security mann'd out three Boats with 30 armed Seamen each, who were furnish'd with bags of Meal to throw in the 
Dutch
 mens Eyes.
 Being thus provided, they set out in the evening, and tho' the Darkness for a while made them lose one anothers Company, yet they got together again at break of day, and clapt the Fri∣gat a board, dividing themselves into three Com∣panies: The first of which had Orders to cut the Cables, the second to Govern the Sails, and the third, to shut down the Seamen under Deck, and to kill all they met in their way. Cap∣tain 
Tromp
 hearing the alarm,
 got presently out of his Bed, and fired his Pistols two or three times at the 
English
 that were already Mrs. of the Frigat; but finding it was too late to save her, he endeavoured at least to save himself by leaping out of the Window of the Captains Chamber into the Sea, where he swum till a 
Dutch
 Boat came and took him up. The 
Eng∣lish
 having thus regain'd their Ship, without lo∣sing any time, made sail immediately away towards 
Naples,
 and were pursued by two 
Dutch
 Men of War, but in vain, the 
Phoenix
 being a very Nimble sailor.




There were 8 Seamen kill'd in this Rencoun∣ter, and those that were wounded were set a∣shore at 
Naples.
 Notwithstanding this, the 
En∣glish
 were still much weaker than the 
Dutch
 in the Mediterranean, For besides the 14 Men of War Commanded by 
de Galen,
 the 
Dutch
 Con∣sul at 
Legorn
 had hired 11 more, tho' 'tis true, that 
de Galen
's Squadron were much endamaged by the late Fight, and the others could not quickly be got ready for want of Seamen.


After the unfortunate expedition of Vice-Ad∣miral 
de Wit,
 the States began to cast their Eyes again upon Lieutenant Admiral 
Martin Tromp
 who was as much beloved of the Seamen for his mild Temper; as 
de Wit
 was hated by them, for his Cruelty; besides that there was no body that would offer to go about to parallel the merit of the former with the great Capacity of the other. 'Tis true, some seemed not very well satisfied with the last excursion 
Tromp
 had made, but how∣ever the Major part were of opinion, that as things were, they could not be without him.


Thereforeat the beginnig of 
Novemb.
 the States took a Resolution,
 to give him the Command of the Fleet that was then Equipping. Vice-Admi∣ral 
Evertsz, de Wit, de Ruiter,
 and Rear-Admiral 
Florisz
 were named to Command under him: But 
de Wit
 falling sick was put a-shore, and 
de Ruiter
 substituted in his place.


This Fleet was composed of about 73 Men of War, besides Fire Ships and other smaller ves∣sels and Tenders. Besides which, there were 300 Merchant Ships that were joyned to the Admi∣ral's Flag, which 
Tromp
 had orders to Convoy as far as 
Cape
 St. 
Lazar.
 He then put to Sea with this so potent Fleet, and made towards the Strait of 
Callis.
 Between 
Dover
 and 
Folstan,
 he dis∣covered the 
English
 Fleet under the Command of Admiral 
Blake.
 And so the two Fleets com∣ing up one with the other, begun about noon, to

 fire at one another, and about three in the af∣ternoon, came to a full Engagement. When 
Tromp
 was advanced pretty near 
Blake,
 this latter who had the Weather-gage of him, gave 
Tromp
 a broad side, who answered him vigorously with another, Captain 
Batten
 that Commanded the Ship call'd the 
Rose
 and 
Crown,
 carrying 44 Guns followed the 
English
 Admiral so close, that 
Tromp
 Grapled him and run against him with so much violence that the Head and Bolt-split of the Ship 
Bre∣derode
 were broken to peices with the shock. Whilst 
Tromp
 was Grapled on one side with 
Batten, Achson
 coming up to his assistance brought the Ship 
Bonaventure
 to his other side; which is so much the more Remarkable because the Cap∣tains of those two 
English
 Ships had sworn to 
Blake
 either to bring him the 
Dutch
 Admiral, or else at least to sink him to the bottom of the Sea. 
Achson
 advancing to the head of 
Tromp
's Ship let flie a Broad side that raked his Deck fore and aft, killed his Secretary by his side and did a great deal of other mischief on board the 
Dutch
 Admiral. But yet 
Tromp
 keeping still an undaunted presence of mind, endeavoured by his discourses, to revive the pall'd spirits of his men by inspiring into them a love for their Country; while things were thus passing, one of 
Tromp
's sailors contemning all danger, taking hold of the Cables of the 
Rose
 and 
Crown,
 vaulted into her through a shower of shot, and climbing up to the Main-Mast Top Gallant, pull'd down the 
Eng∣lish
 Flag and put up the Princes in its stead; for which Heroick Action he had a Gratification given him by the States of 500 
Dutch
 Livers; At length 
Batten
 after he had lost above 60 men, and was quite disabled, yeilded his Ship; and on the other side 
Evertsz
 coming to a close En∣gagement with 
Achson,
 handled him so roughly that he was fain to quit the 
Bonaventure.




Blake
 being attackt by 
de Ruiter,
 lost his Masts, and the Captain 
de Haas,
 and 
de Liefde
 falling likewise upon him, attackt him on both sides so that he was forced to quit the Fight, and retire very much battered and disabled, to 
Do∣ver.
 The night at last parted the Fray, but those that were Engaged the furthest amongst the 
English
 Ships left not of shooting till towards 9 a Clock. The particularities of this Battle may be seen in the following Letter written by 
Tromp
 to the States.


SInce my last of this Month,
 we have used all possible diligence to make towards the 
Downs.
 And on the 9th sailing between 
Cal∣lis
 and 
Dover,
 we perceived a Fleet. We set sail at 2 a Clock, the Weather being Calm; the 
English
 after our Example, unmoored like∣wise, being 52 sail strong, great and small. At one a Clock, the Wind that was North-West changed to the West. In the Evening about 5 a Clock, we cast Anchor and the 
Eng
sh
 Fleet did the like to the West-ward of 
Dover.
 That night we had a storm; at 10 in the morn∣ing the Wind was North-North West. Some of our Ships of War, and Fire-Ships were scat∣tered from us. At Noon, we set sail, the 
En∣glish
 did the same, and we strove to get up with them. At 1 a Clock some of our nimblest sailors began to Fire at them, about 3 a Clock we arrived at the 
Singels
 with design to pre∣vent the Enemies, but 
Blake
 drawing towards us, we made up directly to him, which assoon as he perceived, he did what he could, to get the Weather-gage of us, in which he succeeded, but we Exchanged in passing, each of us a Broad side; and the Ship called the 
Rose
 and 
Crown,
 carrying 44 Guns, and about 200 men

 Commanded by 
Batten,
 followed him very close, upon which, we fell foul upon with so much impe∣tuosity, that our Bolt-sprit and the point of our Ships head were broken with the shock. At the same Moment, another 
English
 Captain, named 
Achson
 who Commanded the Ship 
Bonaventure,
 carrying 30 Guns, having likewise attackt us on the other side, we fought for an hour between them both, till at last the 
Rose
 and 
Crown
 ha∣ving 60 Men kill'd, and a great many wound∣ed, and two Captains kill'd, was forced to yield her self.


Our Vice-Admiral 
Evertsz
 having attackt the 
Bonaventure
 on her other side, we were four Grapled together, and the 
Bonaventure
 likewise yielded. We took possession of the 
Rose
 and 
Crown,
 after having taken above a 100 men out of her, and put in 60 of our own men instead of them. We had in our Admiral's Ship 3 men killed, and 21 wounded. Vice-Admiral 
Evertsz
 took likewise possession of the 
Bonaventure,
 and the Night having put an end to the Fight, we cast Anchor, and gave order to our Master that kept our prizes, to do the same. About 9 a Clock we still heard the noise of the Fir∣ing of our Rears. About the Dusk of night, Cap∣tain 
Juinbol
's Ship fell on fire, by what acci∣dent we know not, and perish'd with a great part of her men, but the rest were saved. We spent all the night in repairing our Ships and our damages.


On the 11th. of the aforesaid Month, in the Morning the Wind being West-North-West, we perceived 2 Ships to the Westward, to which we gave chace. Captain 
Van Sanen,
 took one of them, which proved an 
English
 Ship of 14 Guns, laden with Figs coming from 
Condat.
 We called all our Captains on Board us, and their men in the mean while, helpt to repair our Ship, and all the other Ships in the Fleet that had need

 of it. We had but very few men kill'd and wounded. Some of our Ships are scattered from us, and we know not which way they have steer∣ed. And about one a Clock, we were got in a readiness to weigh Anchor, with a design to go and seek out the 
English,
 either at 
Dover,
 or to∣wards the 
Downs.
 We accordingly advanced for some time, and then the Night coming on, we were forced to come to an Anchor, 
Dover
 bearing North-East from us. On the 12th. at 10 a Clock; Captain 
Sentson
 brought in to us one of the Parliament Ships, called the 
Hercu∣les,
 carrying 26 Guns, which had on board her 80 Vagabonds that had saved themselves upon that Coast, she was bound from 
Portsmouth
 for 
London,
 in order to joyn the other Men of War that were there, designed to be sent into the 
Mediterranean.
 At the same time some of our strayed Ships found the way back to us again. We used all possible industry clapping on all the sail we could, to make towards the 
Downs,
 but found it impracticable to do it. The 13th. in the Morning, the Wind being at North North-East, we weighed Anchor, and stood towards the Coast of 
France,
 and came to an Anchor in the Rode of 
Bullen,
 where we received the dis∣patches of your High and Mightinesses, dated the 7th. of this Month. As soon as we shall get all our Fleet together again, if the Wind and opportunity permit, we will go and make another attack upon the 
English,
 according to our Orders. We have gotten an account from our Prisoners, of the present condition their Men of War are now in, which we have set down in the Memorial hereto annexed, but we know not whether their report may be relied on. We im∣patiently expect our Merchant Fleet, as also the Men of War and Fire Ships which lagg'd behind us when we came away; and for that effect, we have sent out our best sailors a cruiz∣ing

 along the Strait of 
Callis,
 to hasten them back, 
&c.


In all propability 
Tromp
 in that Action would have entirely destroyed the 
English
 Fleet, if they had not timely retreated into the Thames; and if he could have procured any good sounders, he would have gone to seek them out even in that their place of refuge, but wanting that neces∣sary help he was fain to content himself with the taking of the Ships, the 
Rose
 and 
Crown,
 the 
Bonaventure,
 the 
Hercules,
 and another little Ship of 14 Guns, taken by his Cruizers, 
&c.
 However the 
Dutch
 Merchant Fleet passed the Strait of 
Callis
 about the 15th. of the same Month, and happily pursued their designed Voy∣age.


In the mean while great Complaints and Mur∣murings begun to break out at 
Westminster,
 they being much dissatisfied there at the weak resist∣ance
 
Blake
 had made in the last Engagement, and if he had not had the affection of the Officers and Seamen of his Fleet, he would undoubtedly have incurred a disgrace from his Mrs. and the Mobb would have carried their resentments much fur∣ther; But Policy being dextrous in covering the failings of great Men, husht them all up in si∣lence. 
Oliver Cromwel
 however, going to 
Spit-head,
 where the Fleet then lay at Anchor, caused several Captains to be seized in order to fine them in punishment of their Cowardice. 
Ays∣chew
 having been deserted by 
Blake
 charged him with the loss of the Battle, and openly protest∣ed, he would serve no longer: The Parliament to appease him, ordered him a Gratification of 300 
l.
 in Sterlin besides 180 
l.
 that had been assigned him before upon the Revenues of some Lands in 
Ireland.




Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 after he had cruized some time in the Channel, to wait for the Ships that were to come from 
Holland,
 arrived at the beginning of 
February
 near the Isle of 
Rhee,
 to Convoy 250. Merchant Ships that were there as∣sembled from divers parts of 
Europe;
 and after having staid there 7 days he set out with that Fleet to Conduct them home to their own Coun∣try; but towards the end of the Month, as he came near 
Portland,
 he descryed the 
English
 Fleet under the Command of 
Blake,
 upon which he stood directly towards them, and came up with the Enemies about 10 a Clock in the forenoon, which gave occasion to another Fight which was so much the more bloody, because 
Blake
 on the one side burnt with desire to regain by a Victo∣ry his lost reputation, and 
Tromp
 on the other, was inflamed with no less passion to pre∣serve the glory he had won, and the vast riches of which he was the Conductor.


The two Fleets were scarcely advanced with∣in Cannon shot of one another,
 but 
Tromp
 tackt about upon 
Blake,
 who presently began to play upon him with all his Artillery, tho' without doing 
Tromp
 any great harm because he was at such a distance from him: But this latter for∣bearing to fire till he came within Musket shot of his Enemy, let flie at him a broad side, and then tacknig about nimbly, he fired a second at him on the same side, and then flanking him again on the other side, thundred off a third at him with so great success, that there were nothing but cries and groans to be heard on board of 
Blake,
 who fought after that only in retreating and sheering away as far as he could from 
Tromp
 who ceased not to pursue him. After this 
Preludium,
 the two Fleets inter∣mixing one with the other, the Battle grew so furi∣ous, that there was little else to be seen but Masts overturned into the Sea, and splinters flying on all sides, Sails rent in pieces, and Masts and Cables cut

 short in sunder; in one place, the Enemy was board∣ing our Ships, and in a moment after, were cha∣ced off again, where they were seen to be blown up into the Air with the Deck they stood upon; And on another side, was seen a Ship swallow∣ed up by the Waves with several hundreds of Men, and the Sea turned red with humane blood, and covered over with dead bodies, and float∣ing pieces of shattered Ships, which yet instead of dismaying the Combatants, served only to in∣flame their Courage the more, and flesh them on the more cruelly to mutual and implacable slaugh∣ter: And the Complaints and Lamentations of the miserable wounded wretches, instead of mol∣lifying their hearts with any sentiments of pity, and inspiring them with abhorrence for such cru∣elty, rendred them but the more bloody mind∣ed, and the more violently excited them to fierce and remorseless Revenge. 
Bullen
 and its Moun∣tains on one side, and 
Portland
 on the other, were terribly shaken with the thundring noise of their dead-doing Guns; and in a word, it may be said, that never was there any fight seen more cruel and obstinately bloody then that. 
de Ruiter
 had dreamt the night before, that a Bird came and perch't on his hand, but flew away as he was going to take her, so that seeing the 
English
 draw near the next day, he cried out, 
There's the Bird I dream't of;
 he found himself Engaged with a great 
English
 Ship carrying 44 Guns, and 270 men, called the 
Prosperity,
 which fired most ter∣ribly at him, which put him in such perplexity, that he thought the best way to shelter himself from her fury, would be resolutely to board her: And accordingly his Seamen readily presenting themselves for the Enterprise, with a great deal of courage and undauntedness, they leapt into the Enemies Ship, but were so hotly received there, that they were forced to retire again; but yet 
de Ruiter
 not despairing for all that, to carry her,

 at last, cried out to his men, 
My Boys? That touch was worth nothing, I pray you, my Lads, once more Courage.
 Upon which, giving another assault, they won the Ship, but 
de Ruiter,
 being afterwards over powered by the Enemies Num∣bers, and deserted by the rest of his Squadron, was much against his will, constrained to let that be tamely taken again from him that had cost him so dear.


He found himself once encompast with above 20 sail of the Enemies, but at length Vice-Ad∣miral 
Evertsz
 coming in to his relief, he by his undauntedness, forced his passage through that great Number; after which, being seconded by the Captains, 
Kruik
 and 
Swers,
 he fought a long time against 7 Great 
English
 Men of War, a∣mong whom was Vice-Admiral 
Pen,
 who was fain to retire very much battered to the Isle of 
Wight;
 there was another like wise disabled, all his Masts and rigging being shot away close by the board; there came up besides 4 or 5 
English
 Ships more, and attackt afresh 
de Ruiter,
 and his assistants, 
Kruik
 and 
Swers,
 who for all that, de∣fended themselves till evening, without receiving any other succour than that which their own great cou∣rage was able to furnish them.


Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 pierced through and through the 
English
 Fleet which took up a∣bout a mile in extent, thundring at all that op∣posed his passage. Captain 
Kruik
 signalized him∣self every way; for his Ship, called the 
Ostritch,
 fought on still some time longer against several 
English
 Ships, sunk one of them, and defended her self as long as she had any men left, but at last the valiant 
Tromp
 observing she had lost all her Masts and rigging to the very Hull, and was ready to sink, 
Is it possible!
 cried he in a passi∣on, to his followers, 
There should be any Cap∣tains in the States Fleet so Cow-hearted, as to suffer so brave a Man to be over whelm'd by Numbers?


 And gave order at the same time to 
de Wilde
 to go and rescue him. In pursuance of which, he had already fastned a Harser to his Ship to tow him away, but the Calm hindred him, so that all he could do, was only to save some of the Seamen that threw themselves on board him, whilst the 
Ostritch
 was left swimming in a manner as much in blood as in water, and especially upon the Deck there was nothing to be seen but a most horribl
 spectacle of dead and wounded Men, there being reckoned 80 of the former, and of 40 young Seamen of 
Schiedam,
 all under the Age of 20 years, there were but 3 left alive. The 
English
 had already boarded her to pillage her, but being afraid, she would sink under them, they quitted her, till the same Enemies finding her a∣gain next day without any soul in her, they carried her to 
Portsmouth.


Captain 
Port
 having attackt a great 
English
 Man of War, sunk him, but two more falling in upon him a moment after, he received several shot between Wind and Water, which obliged him to call 
Swers
 to his assistance, who presently ad∣vanced to the head of 
Ports
 Ship at the instant when the two 
Englishmen
 were battering both his sides. And so the 4 Ships being Grapled to one another, 
de Port
's Ship was overturned and sunk together with an 
Englishman,
 but most of the Men were saved by 
Swers.
 At the same time 
Port
 was cruelly wounded in the Reins by a splinter, and was seen tho' thrown down on his back on the Deck to Wave his hanger in his hand to the last and to encourage his men, till the Waves swallowed up both him and his Ship. 
Swers
 likewise on his part had so se∣verely handled an 
English
 ship that had attackt 
Port
 that he was also sunk, but almost at the same time his Ship was attackt by 4 other 
English,
 and sunk. He and some of his Men were saved by the Enemies, and carried to 
London
 after the

 fight; but understanding perfectly well the 
Spanish
 Tongue, he made himself pass for a natural 
Spa∣niard,
 so that shuffling himself in amongst the Domestick servants of the 
Spanish
 Ambassador, he found means to get a passage into 
Flanders,
 and from thence into his true Country. This was the same 
Swers
 that was afterwards made Vice-Admiral of 
Holland,
 of the College of the Ad∣miralty of 
Amsterdam,
 and who gave many sig∣nal marks of his Courage and Ability. Captain 
Kleidyk
 of the 
Brill,
 received almost at one and the same time, the fire of 3 Great 
English
 Men of War, and being already reduced into a very pitiful condition, 
Regemorter
 a 
Zealand
 Captain came in to his Aid, and cleared one of his sides, then 
Kleidyk
 began to take a little breath, and sunk one of the 
English
 Ships that lay against the other side of him but soon after, his own Ship underwent the same fate, yet he saved himself and his men after a most wonderfull manner, for throwing themselves into the 
English
 Ship that lay against the side of 
Regemorter,
 they leapt at the same moment from thence on board 
Regemorter
 who was just then kill'd with 30 or 40 of his men. 
Kleidyk
 then being got thither, took the Command of the Ship, and spoke with so much courage to his people, that they begun to fire afresh at the 
English
 Ship, and that, with so much success, that it was disabled and soon af∣ter buried in the Deep. Captain 
Munick
's Ship, of 
Amsterdam
 was taken about the same time, and to∣wards evening they burnt her.


Captain 
Aart Van Nes,
 following close after 
Tromp,
 found himself in the midst of the Enemies, where he gave signal proofs of his undaunted Courage. He would have Grapled an 
English
 Ship that had the disadvantage of the Wind, but she letting flie at him a broad side, made him glad to sheer off; after which, he attackt another which he furiously battered. He fought likewise

 for some time, against the two 
English
 Vice-Ad∣mirals of the Blew and White Flaggs; and af∣terwards when he saw 
de Ruiter
 surrounded by 4 or 5 
English
 Men of War, he flew in like lightning to his assistance, with Captain 
Balk,
 in which place they fought on both sides with an unconceiveable obstinacy, till at last the 
English
 letting go their hold, and tackt to the West, and then 
Van Nes
 turned his to the East because all his Cartridges being discharged, he wanted Respite to charge new ones, besides that his Fore-Mast was so shattered, that there was no piecing it up again. Rear Admiral 
Florisz
 was for a good while, inclosed by 6 
English
 Ships, and fought valiantly, till 
Tromp
 came and rescued him. 
De Wilde,
 and the other Captains 
Vander Zaen Kemper, &c.
 Signalized themselves. Likewise Captain 
Scholte Wiglemo
 after a long fight, was blown up into the Air with all his Men. Some say, that being Grapled by two 
English
 Ships, and seeing no hopes of saving himself, he had the Courage with his own hands, to set fire to his Powder, that he might destroy the Enemies at the same time he was going to perish himself. There were likewise some other Ships on both sides that were sunk. About 4 a Clock in the afternoon, 
Tromp
 was much surprised to see 26 of his Captains desert the Admiral's Flag, and to retire out of the fight, whilst on the other side, several of the best 
English
 Frigats were detach't, to go and fall upon the Merchant Ships which were under the protection of his Squadron. It was presumed, the 
English
 intended to unmast them, that being not able to follow the main body of the Fleet, they might with the more ease make themselves Mrs. of them; but 
Tromp
 took care to prevent the Enemies design, by speeding to their assistance, and chacing from them the 
English
 Frigats. This first days fight ended not till night. It was found, that 
Tromp
 had made

 that day 800 Cannon shot from his Ship alone, and that one single Brass Gun that was towards the poop, had been discharged 70 times.


The 
Holland
 Fleet wandred about here and there during the obscurity of the night, every ves∣sel endeavouring to repair each one their Re∣spective damages, and to recover themselves into a condition to maintain a second fight. The next day being the 1st. of 
March,
 Admiral 
Tromp
 put up a White Flag, and called together on board him the principal Officers of his Fleet, and exhorted them to acquit themselves worthily of the du∣ty they ow'd to their Country, and to fight like men of Honour and Courage. The 
English
 followed them close at the heels and the Battle begun again next day at 10 a Clock in the morn∣ing, about 3 miles to the North Westward of the Isle of 
Wight.
 The 
English
 had the Wind, but coming near them, we could not find they had any inclination to come to a close fight, they contenting themselves only with shooting at our Masts, Sails, and Rigging, as they had done the day before. 
Tromp
 had drawn up his Fleet into the form of a 
Crescent,
 to be the better able to co∣ver the Merchant Ships; and the 
English
 came up six several times, to endeavour to cutoff those Ships from the main body of the Fleet, but were always repulsed.


Tromp
 was ravish'd with Joy, to see some of his Captains fight more couragiously that day then they had done the day before. Captain 
Van Nes
 kept so close to 
Tromp,
 that he could easily call him to his assistance in case of need. 
De Ru
ter
 also gave upon this occasion, New proofs of his bravery; for after he had received his or∣ders from the Admiral, he engaged so far amongst the thickest of the Enemies, that he was many times in danger of being opprest by them, and after noon, he was so grievously battered, that he was not able any longer to move either forward

 or backward upon which, 
Tromp
 Commanded Cap∣tain 
Du
n
 to assist 
de Ruiter
 to get off, and go out of the Battle. Almost at the same time, the Admiral was informed, that the Merchant Ships were stand∣ing to the South-East-Ward, upon which, Cap∣tain 
Van Nes
 was detatcht away, to Command them by 
Tromps
 order, to stand to the East-North East-ward in order to make towards the Strait of 
Callis. Van Nes
 performed his Commission, and bid them at the same time clap on more Sail; but hapning to come too late, and they ha∣ving neglected to execute the orders given them, the 
English
 took their opportunity to Snap some part of that Fleet together with two Men of War of which they made themselves Mrs. of which one that was Commanded by 
Le Sage,
 yielded not till after a very stout Resistance. Of the Merchant Ships, there were 12 taken, others were defended by the Men of War, and part of them saved themselves in 
Havre de Grace,
 as did likewise two Men of War that had lost their Masts. At the coming on of the night, an 
Eng∣lish
 Ship took fire, and then the fight end∣ed.


In the mean while, some Captains sent word to 
Tromp,
 that they wanted Powder, and were not in a condition to make any longer resist∣ance, upon which, 
Tromp
 ordered them to keep by the Merchant Ships, and to make as fair a shew as they could with their presence, to make the Enemy believe, they were there to defend them; and then all things were disposed to be in a readiness for a third fight. The next morn∣ing at break of day, the 
English
 were seen to come on again to charge them. Upon which, 
Tromp
 having put all things in order for that purpose advanced towards the Enemies Fleet, with more Courage and Resolution than any Forces he had to fight them. For at most he had but one poor Squadron under his Flag that had

 any Ammunition left, whilst the Rest were unpro∣vided of all things. At 10 of the Clock in the morning, the two Fleets came up with one ano∣ther, and commenced a third Battle, which was very obstinate and Bloody, yet without any great advantage to the Enemies. The English Vice-Admiral of the 
Blew
 Braved for some time the Dutch Admiral, thundring continually at him with his Guns, but he forbearing to fire till he came up almost close to his side, gave him then first one Broad-side, and after that another, so much to the purpose, that he was forc'd to retire. But whilst on one side, the Valiant 
Tromp
 signalized himself, many of his Captains basely deserted him on the other, and betook themselves to a shame∣ful flight, besides several others that were con∣strained to it by pure necessity, for want of Powder. Towards the Evening, the English took some more of our Merchant Ships. Captain 
Van Ness,
 at the beginning of the fight, advertised them by order from the Admiral, to clap on all the Sail they could, and make towards the strait of 
Callis;
 but those orders were neglected; 
Tromp
 sent to them, the 
Fisc
l,
 or Treasurer of his Fleet, to press them to make the more hast, but all in vain, it being impossible with all that could be done or said, to make them to go forwards; so that some of the Enemies Fregats appearing in the evening, came and fell upon the main Bo∣dy of that Fleet.


Van Ness
 did all he was able, to defend them,
 but they falling into confusion and disorder, one part of them blindly threw themselves among the Enemies Men of War, whilst the others fal∣ling foul upon one another, knockt themselves to pieces. And for the Dutch Men of War that were there, they alas, could give them no assi∣stance for want of Powder, so that a considerable part of those Merchant Men fell into the hands of the English.




At the approach of the night, 
Blake
 made a shew as if he would have come on again to charge the Dutch Fleet, but Admiral 
Tromp
 keeping himself in a posture ready to stand the shock, the Eng∣lish Admiral retired, steering his Course towards the Coasts of 
England,
 whilst the States Fleet made sail quietly without being pursued, towards the Coasts of 
Flanders,
 and came to an Anchor on the 3d of 
March,
 within three Miles to the Northwestward of 
Dunkirk,
 from whence they got into the Harbours of 
Holland
 and 
Zealand.
 These three successive Battles as the Dutch would needs flatter themselves, cost very nigh as dear to the English as the Dutch. Its true the 
Hol∣landers
 confess they lost 24 Merchants Ships, but the English reported them at 
London
 to be above 40. These Dutch Men of War, 
viz.
 the 
Great St. Luke,
 the 
Ostrich,
 the 
Amity,
 and the 
Gol∣den Cock
 were taken and carried into 
Plymouth
 and 
Dover;
 The 
Crown,
 the 
Angel Gabriel
 and 
Keidyk
 were sunk, and 
Schelten Wiglemo
 blown up. Among the Captains that were kill
d, were reckoned 
Balk, Van Zaanen, Port, Spanhem, Al∣lart, Sipke Fokkes
 and 
Regemorter, Schey, Van Zeelst,
 and 
Swers
 were made Prisoners. The number of men kill'd was about 600, and that of the wounded somewhat more. 
De Ruiter
 having lost all his Masts, and most part of his Men, was forced to retire before the end of the Battel.


On the side of the English, the 
Rainbow,
 the 
Saturn,
 the 
Sampson,
 the 
Rose,
 and Captain 
Button
's Ship were sunk, and the 
Charles
 Burnt, as was like∣wise the Fregat called the 
Fairsax,
 but that was done by the English themselves at 
Chatham,
 be∣cause she was not in a condition to be made fit for Service again. The 
Marmaduke,
 the 
Mer∣lin,
 the 
Pheasant,
 the 
King David,
 the 
Grey∣hound,
 and the 
Seven Brothers
 were so misera∣bly battered, that they never appeared at Sea since. The 
Admiral,
 the two 
Vice-Admirals,


 and the 
Rear-Admiral
 had likewise no reason to boast of any better Treatment. 
De Ruiter
 took from them the Ship called the 
Prosperity.
 The number of men killed and wounded of the Eng∣lish, according to the accounts given in 
Holland,
 amounted to about 2000 Seamen and Soldiers, a∣mong which were reckoned the Captains 
Mildmay, Barker, Bale, Hall, Kirby, Dakirs Broadbridge, Jeffew,
 and 
Button,
 killed, and 
Back, Day, Taduel, Lawson,
 and some others wounded; to which, they add, that the number of the maimed was very considerable.


But letting alone those relations as less authen∣tick, it will be much more pertinent to our pur∣pose, to insert here the Letters of the two Ad∣mirals, by which the truth of things will best appear, and which party had the advantage, and besides, the Curious will be glad to read such O∣riginal Narrations as those, because in them are many Circumstances reported, that are not to be found in the Body of any History of those times. Accordingly we shall present you with a true Copy of the Letter sent by Admiral 
Blake
 upon this Subject, to the Speaker of the Parliament at 
Westminster.


The Almighty power of God in which we put all our trust,
 hath newly given his Servants real marks of his Blessing, by the Defeat of the for∣midable Fleet of 
Holland,
 we having beaten them in three successive Battles, given three several days one after another, so that a great number of Pri∣soners are fallen into our hands, the others are dispersed, and part of them chased into places out of the reach of the pursuits of the Victors. God be praised, that he has been pleased to honour his children with his Protection, by disarming their Enemies. Ever since the 
10th
 of this month, he

 hath given us assured presages of his assistance, by sending us favourable winds. Our Fleet was right against 
Portland,
 and much perplext for fear the Enemy upon sight of us, should have made away farther from us. Two days before, we were at Prayers, and on the 
18th,
 we perceived, that God was going to inform us, where they were. The Text that day was taken out of the 
2 Chron. 20.16.
 in these words. 
To morrow go ye down a∣gainst them,
 &c. And the Chapter was scarce∣ly expounded, but even before break of day, we discovered the Enemies Fleet; upon which, we immediately set Sail, to make to them, and the Enemy did the same by us, and scarcely were the two adverse Fleets met, but they engaged in a Battle. We had at fi
st the disadvantage, be∣cause the Enemies had the weather-gage, and that the major part of our best Ships could not come up to us. Which was the cause, that our Admiral-Ship, the 
Triumph
 was 
orced all that day to en∣dure the greatest fire of the Enemies, whilst the others at the same time were in no less peril. But God was our Soveraign Protector, for tho our Ship had already lost half her men, yet the courage of the rest gave us still great hopes, and much al∣lay'd our grie
 for the loss of the others. But more could not be expected from them than it pleased God they should do,
 and which our Enemies doubtless have sufficiently experienced. The first day we took from them three Rear-Admirals, and one Vice-Admiral, and a little after, we sunk them 
3
 Ships; the others are now at 
Portsmouth.
 The 
2d
 day we burnt or sunk 
8
 or 
10
 more of them; The 
3d
 day, they began to give way, and betake themselves to flight. Their losses are so much the greater and more sensible, in that we took from them above 
40
 men of War and Merchant Ships. We Boarded them in the sight of 
Tromp,
 he not being able to oppose us. Captain 
Lawson
 Grappled a great Ship and took her, but he was very much battred. 
Marten
 and

 
Gaver
 took also two Ships, so that we have taken several, and our Enemies will be forced to own their loss to be great. We have lost several Offi∣cers recommendable for their Merit and Valour, as likewise 
5
 or 
6
 Masters of the first ranks much lamented for their good conduct and great fidelity, besides a great many other brave men that were in the Fleet. But we have lost never a Ship ex∣cept one which we sunk our selves. Our Admirals behaved themselves with an unexampled bravery. Admiral 
Blake
 was wounded in the Thigh, but we hope he will not be much incommoded by it. He would hardly be perswaded to go down into the Ship, to be drest, and never quitted his Post during the whole fight. In fine, we observed, that every day as long as the Battle lasted, the Arm of the Al∣mighty God favoured our Arms, being bound to acknowledge, That 'tis he that gives the Victory, and not the great number of Ships, or the strength of Armies.


This Letter seemed very edifying by the great shew of Piety that appeared throughout it, but it must be observed, that this was the stile of the English in 
Cromwel
's time, that able Politi∣cian covering himself usually with the Cloak of Religion to make his Ambitious Projects take effect, and the way to make a mans Court with him, was to affect a great shew of Devoti∣on. The same Character now reigns in 
France,
 where people are obliged to appear Bigots, to make their Fortune, the Princes humour of late being turned wholly that way.


Here follows now the Letter Written to the States upon the same occasion, by 
Tromp.














High and Mighty Lords,


THis Battle that has lasted 
3
 days together be∣gun the last of 
February
 at 
9
 a Clock in the morning,
 and ended not till the 2d. of 
March,
 when the Night parted the Combatants. It was, given in that extent of Sea that is between 
Port∣land,
 and 
Swartness
 or 
Bullen.
 The 
English
 had about 
69
 or 
70
 sail of Frigats and Men of War, and we 
70
 Men of War, and 
150
 Merchant Ships. I cannot yet give your High and Mightinesses all the particulars, because most of the Captains hardly had time the 1st. of 
March,
 to come on board the Admiral.


They have informed me, that 
de Ruiter
's Squa∣dron which fell upon the Enemies Rear, took some Ships from them, whilst several others on both sides, were sunk. As for our Van guard of which I had the joynt Conduct with Rear Admiral 
Florisz,
 we at∣tackt that of the Enemies under the Command of 
Blake.
 The fight was fierce and obstinate, and the Victory very wavering, so that neither of the Parties had any cause to brag of any advantage they had. This was the success of the first days fight. About 
4
 a Clock in the afternoon observing that the 
English
 had detacht a Squadron of their nimblest Sailors, to go and fall upon the Merchant Fleet, with design to burn them, we quitted the Fight, to hasten to their assistance. After the Acti∣on was over, I sent for the General Officers of the Fleet, 
Evertsz
 and 
De Ruiter,
 on board the Ad∣miral, whilst 
Florisz
 was left to take care those Ships of the Fleet should be repaired that had need of it. We therefore consulted upon the present State of Affairs, whether it would be advisable for us to leave our Merchant Ships to their shifts, to

 go and attackt the Enemies once more, since we were to weak to spare a detachment of Men of War strong enough to Convoy them; and besides that we had some grounds to fear, the 
English
 might have still some body of reserve towards 
Cal∣lis,
 or whether it would not be better, to defend them, by making them keep close by us, and so in a fighting posture to wait the Enem
es charge. And because we were in want of Powder, order was given to husband it well, and not to make one shot unprofitably. We discovered to the East-ward at a good distance from us, the Ship called the 
Ostritch
 so terribly battered and disabled, that she had nothing left but her Main, and Miz∣zen Sa
ls, whereupon, I ordered 
de Wilde
 to go and take her, and bring her to the Fleet. As soon as we had got together all our Sh
ps both Men of War and Merchants, we stood to the North-West, and towards evening we had a great Calm. But 
de Wilde
 not being able to bring off the 
Ost∣ritch,
 the 
English
 carried her away next day to their Fleet.


That day about 
11
 a Clock, the Enemies came and charged us again. They had posted in the Wings of their Fleet, five or six of their best Sh
ps, to Endeavour to intercept some of our Ships. We fought all that day till the Dusk of N
ght. Cap∣ta
n 
le Sage
 of 
Zealand,
 and 
le Bruin, Van Zeelst
 of 
Amsterdam,
 and some Merchant Ships were se∣parated from the Fleet. Towards evening several Captains came and Complain'd, that they had no Ammunition left, upon which, because I had on board the Admiral a great many Bullets, 
8
 pound∣ers, I distributed them amongst those, who had Guns of that Bore. We still pursued our Course the Wind at West-North-West, and every one en∣deavoured to repair their respective Ships as well as it was possible.




On the 2d. of 
March,
 the 
English
 attackt us a∣gain with a great deal of vigour; and we had hard∣ly fought two hours, but half of our Ships had spent all their Ammunition. we fired some guns for a signal to them to come on board us, which they did. I placed them in the main body of the Fleet, and charged them to make shew as if they wanted nothing, telling them, that they which still had a∣ny Ammunition, should take care to defend them; so that I made a shift to maintain the fight till night, defending them all that while with not a∣bove 
25
 or 
30
 Ships that were still provided with Powder and Bullets. Two hours after, 
Blake
 ha∣ving assembled all his Forces, made shew as if he would fall upon us once more. When I saw that, I took in my Sails, and let him know, I was rea∣dy to begin again with him; upon which, after the Vanguards of the two Fleets had charged one ano∣ther for some time, the 
English
 at length sheer'd off, to Sea ward, and 
Blake
 being out of Cannon shot, came no more at us. Vice-Admiral 
Evertsz
 coming then to me, told me, they wanted Powder and Bullets. When night was come, we hang out Lantherns, continuing all the while our former Course with a North North East Wind. 
Blake
 likewise hung out his Lanthenrs, being to the Lee∣ward. Towards mid-night, we lost sight of the E∣nemies lights; and the next morning we perceived 
Callis
 bearing South-West of us at about 
2
 miles d
stance, without seeing any 
English
 at all. I am perswaded, they are retired towards the Isle of 
Wight
 to repair and resit their Ships, 
&c.




The success of this Battle made so great a noise at 
London,
 that they made no difficulty to pub∣lish abroad that 
Tromp, Evertsz,
 and 
de Ruiter
 were totally Routed, and that 100 Merchant Ships, and 50 Men of War of the 
Dutch
 were taken or sunk; nay, and this noise was Echoed over all 
Europe;
 and was carried into 
France, Sweedland, Denmark,
 and to render what they affected to

 speak of it, the more credible, the Parliament appointed an Extraordinary Thanksgiving day to be kept on that occasion; and what seemed ful∣ly to Authorize so great a Triumph, and exalt the glory of 
Blake,
 was, that the Prisoners were led in a Drove to 
Canterbury,
 under the Guard of a Troop of Horse, and that in all the places through which they passed, they affected to ring the Bells, thereby to make that defeat to appear the more signal and incontestable; tho the 
Dutch
 at the same time no less confidently pretended, that the Action did not pass altoge∣ther so much to the advantage of the 
English,
 that they ought to have attributed to themselves all the Glory of it, since, say they, excepting the Merchant Ships that fell into their hands, the 
Hollanders
 had not much less right to pre∣tend to the Victory than their Enemies.


But tho' the Arms of the United Provinces had received some Check on the Occean,
 yet they were Victorious in the Mediterranean; that which had passed in the attempt made for the recovery of the 
Phoenix
 had so offended the Great Duke of 
Tuscany,
 that he lookt upon such a vio∣lence committed in his Ports, to be an intrench∣ment upon his Soveraignty, so that he Com∣manded the 6 
English
 Men of War, either to go out of that Harbour in which the 
Holland∣ers
 had kept them besieged almost 8 Months, or else to restore them their Frigat again. 
Appleton
 who Commanded those Ships in chief held a con∣sultation with 
Bodley
 who had another Squadron of 8 men of War and one Fire-Ship at 
Porto Longone.
 They resolved then, that as soon as 
Bodley
 should have weighed Anchor, 
Appleton
 should slip out of 
Legorn
 in order to go and joyn him, and to at∣tack the 
Hollanders
 with their United Force. On the 12th. of 
March
 at the Dusk of night, the 
Dutch
 begun to discover 
Bodley
's Squadron, and the day following, four of his Ships came

 nearer, followed by the rest that appeared to be still at about 4 or 5 miles distance from the former.


The Forces of the 
Hollanders
 consisted of 16 Men of War and a Fire-Ship, besides 6 or 7 Mer∣chant Ships that came from the 
Streights,
 to whom the 
Dutch
 Commanders declared, That if they would take part with them in the Battle, they should share with them in the Booty. As to the Forces of the 
English,
 they were reduced to two Squadrons, whereof one was of 6 and the other was of 7 Men of War, besides a Flute and a Fire-Ship. According to the project concerted between 
Bodley
 and 
Appleton,
 this latter was not to come out of 
Legorn,
 till 
Bodley
 had begun the fight. 
Bodley
 accordingly detacht out 3 of his Men of War and a Fire-Ship, to go and brave the 
Hollanders,
 who seeing 
Appleton
 offered not to stir out, thought it necessary to use a Stratagem, by making as if they would go out against 
Bodley,
 and in effect they tackt about after him, but keeping their Eye still upon the Harbour, being impatient to see 
Appleton
 weigh Anchor; who thinking the 
Hollanders
 would indeed have pursued their way, to make up to 
Bodley,
 ventures at length to come out with his Squadron of 6 Men of War, which the 
Hol∣landers
 no sooner perceived,
 but immediately veer∣ing back, they fell all on a sudden upon him. 
De Galen
 attackt the 
Bonaventure
 carrying 40 Guns, and 180 men, and without giving him time to make ready for a defence, he fired at him seve∣ral broad sides, one after another, so thick, that at last a Bullet chancing to penetrate into her Powder-Room, she was blown up into the Air with all her men, except 6 or 7 Seamen that were saved. That disaster extreamly discoura∣ged the 
English,
 and raised the courage of their Enemies.


Appleton
 Commanded in the Ship call'd the 
Leop∣ard,


 carrying 54 Guns, and near 200 men. He was at∣tackt by the Ships the 
Sun
 and the 
Julus Caesar,
 who battered him in a most terrible manner.


Tromp
 the Son who was then advanced to the Office of a Rear-Admiral,
 Command∣ed in the Ship called the 
Moon,
 vacant by the death of Captain 
Bont,
 who was killed in the fight of 
Monte Christo;
 he attackt the 
Samson,
 carry∣ing 40 Guns, and 130 Men. He fought with so much the more valour, because he still remem∣bred the affront he lately suffered in the 
Phoenix;
 so that coming to Board her, after he had grap∣led her, he powred into her so great a number of Seamen, that she was forced to yield. But in the mean time there was a 
Dutch
 Fire-Ship, that slipping along cunningly by the other side of the English Ship, under the favourable covert of a thick smoak, and grapling her, the flames overrun her with such Rapidity, that they penetrated into her Powder-Room, and blew her up. But the men in her had better luck than those in the 
Bona∣venture,
 the most part of them being saved by the 
Dutch
 Boats.


The Ship called the 
Levant Merchant
 was at∣tackt by the Captains, 
Forme
 and 
de Ham,
 who likewise boarding her, forced her to yield at Dis∣cretion, after the fight, she was carried into 
Le∣gorn.
 The Ship called the 
Traveller
 being at∣tackt by 
de Ʋries
 and 
Boutebotter,
 was also con∣strained to undergo the same Treatment. A∣midst these Transactions, an 
Engl
sh
 Fire-Ship was played at the 
Dutch
 Rear-Admiral, to burn him but 
de Gal
n
 espying her coming, sunk her with his Cannon.


The Ships called the 
Sun
 and 
Julius Coesar,
 bat∣tered 
Appleton
's sides, who seeing himself deserted by 
Bodley,
 defended himself like a man in despair, and obliged the Aggressors to retire. But Cap∣tain 
de Boet
 having at last grapled him, encou∣raged the other two to come on and charge him

 again; so that 
Appleton
 seeing no less than three Enemies upon him at once, despaired of saving himself, and in that humour was going to set fire to the Powder, but his men having hindred him from executing that horrid design, he was for∣ced to yield the 
Leopard
 which he Commanded, having 80 men kill'd, and 60 wounded.


Of 6 Ships of which 
Appleton
's Squadron was Composed, there were 5 destroyed or Mastered, there was but one left, called the 
Marie,
 which making use of her sails instead of her guns, saved her self by flying towards 
Bodl
y,
 who with his Squadron of 8 Ships, tho' he had the Weather-gage, did nothing during the whole fight, but make some discharges with his Guns against the 
Dutch
 Captains, 
Sybrant Mol, Rijk∣hoven, Slortz, Oosterwout, Roodhaas, Govertsz,
 and 
Ʋiotnhoven:
 But as soon as he heard of the defeat of 
Appleton,
 he put up all his sails, and betook himself to flight. 
Tromp
 would have given him chace with some of the Ships that were least endamaged, but the night coming on, he stole away by favour of the darkness, and so escaped the pursuits of the Vi∣ctors.


But the Glorious advantages the 
Dutch
 had thus newly gained, were traversed by the loss of him that had the most contributed thereto, and who had managed that Action with all imaginable Conduct and Prudence. This Valiant Man being on board in his Post, had his right leg shot off by the second Cannon ball that was shot at his Ship, but yet that his men might not be discouraged, he for some time conceal'd his hurt; till the Mrs. chief Mate of his Ship, being the first that perceived it, represented to him, that he lost so much Blood that he would be in evident dan∣ger of his life, if it were not instantly stopt. He was therefore carried down into the Hold, where his Leg was saw'd off below the knee; and a glass of Wine being presented him to

 fortifie his heart, he drunk it of as briskly as if he had felt no harm, after which, he lay down, saying these words: 
The
 English 
King-killers shall pay for all.
 He was hardly drest but he would needs be carried up again to be a spectator of the rest of the fight, but he was so extreamly weak∣ned, that his people would not obey him in that point. All that he could do then in the pitifull plight he was in, to satisfie that desire of Glory that accompanies all Hero's to their last gasp, was to encourage his men by his discourses; and as soon as he heard, the 
English
 had betaken them∣selves to flight, he Commanded his men without los∣ing of time immediately to hoist up all their sails, and to pursue them, but they being got already a great way off, the night put a stop to the in∣tentions of the Victors, who were forced to re∣turn to an Anchor in the road of 
Legorn.


The 
English
 lost in this Action, 6 Men of War, of which one was sunk, 3 were taken, and 2 burnt. And they had 286 men killed, 293 wound∣ed, and some made Prisoners. The 
Hollanders
 loss amounted to 123 men kill'd, and near as ma∣ny wounded, and one Ship call'd, the 
Madonna Della Vignia
 was also lost.


Admiral 
de Galen
 being carried to 
Legorn,
 the Great Duke of 
Tuscany
 did him all the honours imaginable, sending him presents of all that was ca∣pable to give him any ease or refreshment, till the day of his death, which was on the 23d. of 
March.
 He was 48 years old, and was as much lamented for his Merit, and the Great Experience he had in Marine affairs, as for the great and signal Ser∣vices he had done to his Country. His Body was transported into 
Holland,
 and interr'd the 13th. of 
December
 in the new Church at 
Am∣sterdam.
 The States ordered a Magnificent Tomb to be erected,
 to immortalise the Me∣mory of so great a man; Upon which his Figure is placed lying on his back with his Arms and

 Armour, having his head piece at his Feet. Be∣low the Tomb upon a Table of White Mar∣ble,
 there is represented a description of the Bat∣tle which we have just now related. And un∣derneath are written in Golden Letters upon black Marble, the following verses, composed by that famous 
Dutch
 Poet 
J. V. Vondel.


Hier Legt in't graf van eer de Dappre van 
Galen,


Die eerst ging buit op buit Castilien ashaalen;


En met en leeuwenhert, naby't Toskaner strand,


De Britten heeft verjaagd, veroverd en ver∣brand.


Which may be thus Englished.


The Stout 
de Galen
 here in honours bed is laid,


Fam'd for the Rich Booties he on the 
Spaniards
 made;


Who with heart undaunted attackt the English Fleet,


And near the 
Tuscan
 shore; gave them a sore defeat:


And took and burnt their Ships, to serve him for a light


Down to the Gloomy shades, and so bid us good night.


Above the Tomb there is an Oval Table of Black Marble, flourisht all round with Flaggs, Stan∣dards, Streamers, Pikes, and all the Arms used in Sea-Fights. And thereupon is Engraven the following Latin Epitaph in Letters of Gold.












Generosissimo Heroi Johanni a Galen, Essensi.

M. H. P.


Which we have rendred in English thus.






To the most Generous Hero 
John de Galen
 of 
Essen.


WHO for his many couragious and successful Exploits; for having in one year taken six 
Dunkirk
 Privatiers, and brought away many rich spoils from the Barbarians, being afterwards made Admiral of the States Fleet in the Mediterrane∣an, having in a memorable Battle near 
Legorn,


 by the help of God, taken, put to flight, burnt and sunk the Ships of the English, restored Com∣merce again with the inhabitants of those Coasts; on the 
15th
 of 
March 1653.
 And having lost one of his Legs, he expir'd on the 
9th.
 day after the victory, aged 
48
 years: And that he might live by his Glorious Fame, to all succeeding Ages, By order of the Most Illustrious and Mighty States of the Ʋnited Netherlands, the Senate of the Ad∣miralty of 
Amsterdam
 have erected to him this Monument.










When 
Bodley
 was got back to 
London, Apple∣ton
 charged him with the loss of the Battel, with so much the more grounds of probability, because the Captains of the States Fleet that were returned to 
Amsterdam,
 gave a noble Te∣stimony of the Bravery of this latter. The Sub∣ject of 
Appleton
's Complaint, was, That 
Bodley
 had not performed his promise, but had basely left him to be a Victim to his Enemies; but that difference was not decided.


The Council of 
England
 being grown some∣what more sensible of the complaints made by the people of 
Great Britain,
 upon the Subject of the differences that had caused the War with the 
Hollanders,
 began to be a little more inclined to Peace: But 
Cromwel
's intrigues defeated their purposes, he out of a pretended zeal to the Com∣mon Good, taking upon him to assemble a new Parliament, holding frequent Conferences for that purpose with the Chief Members of the Council of War assembled at St. 
James
's. And in effect, pursuant to the Resolutions taken there, he was so daring as to write a Letter soon after, to Dissolve the Parliament, which was publisht throughout all the three Kingdoms. The substance of it imported, 
That the great prospe∣rities that
 England 
had enjoyed for some years past, by its Conquests and the Battles which its Armies had won for the security of the people of

 the three Kingdoms, being a very sensible token of the Blessing of God, they had been guilty of so hai∣nous an ingratitude as not to behave themselves thankfully to him for the same: For that wicked∣ness, and all manner of Vices were so increased, that they were seen to domineer with so much in∣solence, that a general Subversion was to be feared of all the affairs of the Government; and that there∣fore the necessity of the time was so pressing, that it required speedy Remedies; That it was not to be doubted, but that the over long sitting of Parliaments was an inexhaustible Fountain of Troubles and Dis∣orders in the State. That the Peace and Quiet of the Commonwealth was best secured by making a fit Choice and Election of Members to serve in Parliament, that were good men fearing God, to succeed in the places of others at certain limited times, that so a free power might not degenerate into a Tyranny. That all things ought to be re∣gulated as might best conduce to the common good and preservation of the people, by discharging them of Taxes and burthensome Impositions, and by mak∣ing Religion flourish, and propagating the Gospel every where; That provision ought to be made for the Pastors; and that Liberty of Conscience ought to be granted to all, except to the Popish Religion, and Idolatrous Superstitions.


The Queen of 
Sweden,
 writ almost at the same time,
 a Letter to the States General, to offer them her Mediation in the Differences between the two Re∣publicks: It contained, in substance, 
That she had heard with a very sensible displeasure, by the re∣ports that were spread abroad about them, in her Capital City, of the Disputes that had newly kind∣led a War between
 Holland 
and
 England; 
That she thought her self obliged, in consideration of the common friendship she had with them both, to pro∣pose some means to reconcile, if possible, the two Nations; That the Sieur
 Appleboon 
that was

 her Envoy at the
 Hague, 
would wait the States Answer concerning the mediation she offered them; adding, that she had also made the same offers to the Republick of
 England.


The laudable Cantons of 
Swisserland
 were like∣wise no less concern'd at all these disorders, than Queen 
Christina.
 And therefore writ also to the States, to offer their Mediation.


The States of 
Holland
 on their side, who de∣sired nothing more then Peace, writ a Letter to the Parliament of 
England,
 which was made publick, which imported,


That God, the Just Revenger of Crimes, see∣ing they were come to their full ripeness,
 had doubt∣less stirr'd up 
England
 and 
Holland
 to employ all their forces to their own mutual ruine, and com∣mon destruction, whilst their Confinity in Religion and Government, and their neighbour
ood to the Sea, secured motives rather to engage those two Re∣publicks in an inseparable Ʋnion, and to link them so stra
tly together as to oblige them to assist one another; That the sworn Enemies of the Reforma∣tion were ravisht with joy, to see two Allies of the same Faith thus Remorseles
y to shed Christian Blood; and that they who never could resist one of the Republicks, now flattered themselves with the hopes of destroying them both; That it would be impos∣sible to resist them, if the Party of the two that should prove Victorious, after they had so vainly exhausted all their strength should be afterwards suddenly assailed by a new Enemy, being reduced into an impotent condition, and deprived of the succour of its former Ally; That was no Victory more unhappy than such a one as was gained over an Ally, without whose assistance one could not be without a notable weakning of ones self: That if the English would seriously reflect on considerations o
 such high Importance, there was no doubt, but

 things might be soon brought to an accommodation; but since they found that such equitable sentiments as those, made no impression on their minds, they were resolved, to wait from the hand of God the event of all things.


The Parliament assembled at 
Westminster,
 ha∣ving Read their High and Mightinesses Let∣ter, sent an Answer to the States General, and another to the States of 
Holland.
 The first of which intimated, 
That the Sincere Amity of which the
 English 
had given sufficient proofs to the
 Hollanders 
at all times, was well known to all the world; That besides that, they might rely upon the Passion they had, to re-establish the ancient Peace and Amity between the two Nations; That the Par∣liament were not inclined to continue the War with an Ally which the ties of Religion ought to render inseparable from them; but that rather they were ready to do any reasonable thing in order to stifle these troubles in their beginning, that so they might ami∣cably come to an accommodation.


The Letter which the Parliament of 
England
 writ to the States of 
Holland,
 was to this ef∣fect, 
viz.




THat since the happy Revolution that had changed 
England
 into a Commonwealth,
 they had ex∣treamly well considered, how important it was strait∣ly to unite themselves with a Nation, the least dif∣ference with whom, might draw after it very mis∣chievous Consequences, because in regard of Re∣ligion, the two Republicks were so dependant one of another, that they ought to be inseparable. That if they came to a Rupture with them, it was much against their wills, that the Parliament consented to the effusion of Blood that was so dear to them, being fully perswaded, that the Enemies of the Re∣formation had conspired their common ruine, by

 making use ef their own Arms to destroy them: That if Mr. 
De Heemsted
's proposals to which they had yet made no answer, because of his hasty depar∣ture, had been debated in their Assembly; the Peace would be at present concluded. That the sincerity and ardent passion the Parliament testified for the renew∣ing of a Peace, fully justified to the world, that it was never their intention to have any hand in so ruinous a War. And that their present Conduct, and the Prote∣station they now made; that they were ready to renew the Negotiation for a Treaty upon the same Foot as before, sufficiently manifested, what their Sentiments were in that matter.


At the same time, Mr.
 Appleboon 
presented a writing at the
 Hague, 
to the States General in the Queen of
 Swedland's 
name, which was to this effect:
 That her Majesty did not so much as pre∣tend to penetrate into the bottom of their Affairs, having no other end in so pressing an occasion, but to manifest the sincere desire she had to mediate a Peace between the two Republicks, so much the ra∣ther, because her Majesty, and particularly the late King her Father had always lived in perfect good intelligence with the Ʋnited Provinces; That 'tw
s to be feared, if they too obstinately persisted in a War with 
England,
 it would prove a fountain of irreparable mischiefs: That her Majesty offe∣red her Mediation, and that if the States thought fit to accept it, he would wait for the necessary in∣structions to enable him to make a more particu∣lar Overture of it to the Plenipotentiaries.




The States General made answer to the Par∣liaments Letter:
 That the inclination they always had had for Peace, and for maintaining a strait and inviolable Ʋnion with 
England,
 was well known to the Council of State, nay, and to all the wo
ld: And that they were ready on their side to use all sorts of reasonable means, to put a stop to the dismal consequences of so fatal a War, and disposed, to send Plenipotentiaries with full power,

 for that purpose, to any Neuter place that should be agreed upon.


The Parliament having discontinued their sitting, there was nothing left at the Helm but the Council of State, and
 Cromwell 
remained the sole Arbi∣ter of all the Affairs of the Government, who re∣plied to the Letter of the States General:
 That the change that had newly happned in 
England,
 had not at all changed the just inclinations the Nation had for Peace: That the offers the last Parliament had made by their Letter to the States General, and to the States of 
Holland
 to renew Mr. 
de Heemsted
's Negotiation, and pacifie the Troubles between the two Nations were approved by the Coun∣cil of State; That if they would prevent the Ob∣stacles that might happen in the way, there was grounds to hope for a perfect union and perpetual good correspondence between 
England
 and 
Holland;
 and that the project of it would without contradi∣ction be the sooner advanced, if the Disputes a∣bout chosing a neuter place for the Ambassadors of both Parties to treat in, did not drill on the Ne∣gotiation to too great a length; especially conside∣ring that affairs were then in such a posture as would admit of no delays: And that as soon as their Plenipotentiaries should be arrived thither from the 
Hague,
 the Council of State would be ready to enter into Conference with them, with a promise, to neglect nothing that might conduce to the facilitating of an accomodation.


Upon all these fair appearances, the United Pro∣vinces dispatcht away Mr. 
de Bevering,
 and Mr. 
de Nieuport,
 Ambassadors from the States of 
Holland,
 Mr. 
Vander Perre,
 from those of 
Zea∣land,
 and Mr. 
Jongstal,
 from the States of 
Frise∣land.
 Whilst they were thus flattering them∣selves with Peace, the States were minded to re∣ward the merit of those that had signalized them∣selves in the last Battle. Lieutenant Admiral

 
Tromp
 had a chain of Gold valued at 2000 Livers; The Vice-Admirals 
de Wit, Evertsz,
 and 
de Ruiter
 had each of them one of 1500 Livers; and the other Officers, were gratified by the Council of the Admiralty, every one according to their de∣serts. But the Captains 
Lueas, Albertsz, Reini∣er, Sikkema, Look, Hansbek, Ewood, Heironymus, Allard, Jansz
 and others that had behaved them∣selves Cowardly, were punished.


The United Provinces hoping quickly to see an end put to the troubles that had kindled that War, begun to retrench a part of the vast ex∣pences they were by it obliged to be at. The Fleet being ready to sail, 
Tromp
 thought fit, to divide it into 5 Squadrons. The first was un∣der his own Conduct, and had 
de Wilde
 for Vice-Admiral, and 
Vander Abel
 for Rear-Admi∣ral; the 2d. was to be Commanded by the two Brothers, 
John,
 and 
Cornelius Evertsz,
 the first as Lieutenant, and the other as Vice-Admiral, and by Captain 
Kemp,
 as Rear-Admiral; The 3d. was to be under the Conduct of 
de Wit,
 as Lieutenant Admiral, having Captain 
Lapper
 for Vice-Admiral, and 
Kleidyk
 for Rear-Admiral; The 4th. was to be Commanded by 
de Ruiter,
 as Lieutenant Admiral, having Captain 
Van O∣ven
 for Vice-Admiral, and 
Hartman
 for Rear-Admiral; And lastly the 5th. was to be under the Direction of 
Florisz,
 as Lieutentant Admiral, and was to have 
Kampen,
 for Vice Admiral, and 
Jaarsveld,
 for Rear-Admiral.


The 
English
 Fleet was divided into 3 Squa∣drons; The First under the Red Flag, was Com∣manded by the Admirals 
Dean
 and 
Monk,
 who were to be together in the Ship called, the 
Re∣solution;
 the two others under the Blew. Flag, were Commanded by Vice-Admiral 
Pen,
 and Rear-Admiral 
Lawson.
 Their whole Fleet consist∣ed of 105 Men of War, among which were 26 Frigats newly built. There were in it 16269

 men, and 2840 Guns. Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 having received the chief Command of the Fleet, was not at all satisfied at it; having by wri∣ting, declared to the States General,
 and to the States of 
Holland,
 the reasons he had to Com∣plain, which were, that the States best Ships had been burnt or sunk in the precedent Battles, whilst on the other side, they had neglected to repair those Ships that might have been made fit for further service; That it was none of his fault, that greater advantages had not been ob∣tained against the 
English,
 that however he would obey the orders of the States, but that he was so far from doing it willingly, that on the contrary, he should be very joyfull to see the Com∣mand of the Fleet given to any man else but himself, adding, that when mischiefs and losses should come to be talk of, which he but too well foresaw would happen they should have nothing to say against him. But no answer was made to any of his Complaints.


Yet his discontent was so much the better grounded, because he was obliged to put to Sea, with a great Number of small vessels ill provided for War, accompanied with a great many Co∣wardly and unexperienc'd Officers, whereby it was to be considered, he must needs not only expose his life, but likewise that great Reputa∣tion he had gotten by so many brave Exploits. But time would not then permit the States to Re∣dress so many grievances at once. 'Tis True, that at the instances made by the States of 
Hol∣land,
 a Resolution was taken to build 30 new men of War of sufficient bigness to withstand the 
English,
 but that was a work required time; and in the mean while, 
Tromp
 was fain to make shift with those sorry ones he had already, for want of better, which at that Juncture were not to be had.




The Orders he had from the States General, imported, that he should Convoy towards the North of 
Scotland,
 a Fleet of 200 Merchant Ships bound for 
France
 and 
Spain,
 and should Con∣duct back those other Ships that should be ar∣rived in that Sea from divers places.


The Admirals 
Dean
 and 
Monk,
 who as we have said, had the joynt Command in chief of the 
English
 Fleet, being informed of these Or∣ders, resolved to be beforehand with 
Tromp,
 by attacking him before his Junction with the 
Zealand
 Squadron, and other Ships designed for his Re-inforcement; but they came a day too late, so that a few poor Fishermen were forced to bear the brunt of the displeasure they had conceived for so unluckily missing their blow. There were 54 of them then in 
Terreer
 Road newly came from 
Zerikzee,
 of which 47 were destroyed; and of two Ships that served them for Convoys there was one that had but 4 Guns, and yet defended her self so valiantly that the 
English
 Frigats were forced a while to let her alone, but at last being attackt by a great man of War, she was forced to yield. 
Monk
 and 
Dean
 were informed by the Prisoners taken on that occasion, of the State of the 
Dutch
 Fleet, and then they put them a shore, upon promise they should never serve against the 
English,
 af∣ter they had used all their flatteries they could, to no purpose, to court them into the service of 
England.
 The two 
English
 Admirals writ the following Letter to the Parliament, to in∣form them of what had past.


SInce our last, we saw our selves just upon the point of a Bloody Battle, but God having Or∣dered it otherwise, was pleas'd to permit 
Tromp
 and 
de Wit
 to prevent us by steering away to the Northward, with a great number of Merchant Ships, as well to Convoy them that way, as to

 Reconduct the Ships they should find there, coming from 
France,
 but especially those returned from the 
East-Indies.
 In the mean while, we doubt not but you have heard of the new prosperities which it has pleased God to heap upon us, having put us in a Condition, to strike terrour into the heart of the Enemies Country, by a descent upon their Coasts, which was followed by several advantages, and chiefly by the taking of 
50
 Fish∣ing vessels newly come from 
Zerikzee.
 We have put all the Country in Alarm, for fear we should make an irruption, and that we should make use for that effect, of the vessels we have taken from them. However, 'tis a great mortification to the Poor Inhabitants of 
Zerikzee,
 and a great loss to the whole Country, because they us'd to furnish Fish to the Towns of 
Amsterdam
 and 
Rotterdam.
 We flatter our selves with the hopes, we shall quickly meet with 
Tromp.
 May it please God to favour the desires of those that pray for us.


'Tis true, the 
English
 had begun to carry the Terrour of their Arms to our Coasts near the 
Texel
 and the 
Helder,
 but having landed some men, they were received with so much courage and Resolution, as made them have little stomach to venture again upon such another attempt. The 13th. and the 14th. of 
May,
 the 
English
 Fleet saild towards the Coasts of 
Zealand,
 and on the 15th, the two Fleets came within 5 miles one of another, yet with∣out meeting together. Our Merchant Fleet con∣sisting of 300 sail having fetcht a Compass about 
Scotland,
 by the greatest happiness in the world was already safe arrived into our Ports, without seeing any Enemies by the way. 
Tromp
 having Convoyed our Merchant Ships to the North∣ward as far as 
Hitland,
 and not finding those there that were to come from 
France,
 and which he had Orders to Conduct home, returned to∣wards the Coast of 
Holland,
 about the end of

 the Month; and entred into the 
Meuse,
 where he received a Re-inforcement of 17 Men of War and one Fire-Ship brought him by Rear Admiral 
Florisz
 from 
Zealand,
 upon which he went to 
Goree
 to take the Admiral Ship, the 
Brederode
 which was there repaired, having been extreamly endamaged in the last fight.


On Witsunday, 
Tromp
 had a Conference with three Deputies of the States General: The Re∣sult of their Consultation, was that 
Tromp
 should make towards the 
Downs
 of 
England,
 in hopes to meet there with some of the Parliaments Ships. On the 4th. of 
June
 they discovered some of them to the Northward, upon which holding a Council of War, it was resolved that 
de Ruiter
 with his Squadron joyntly with Rear-Admiral 
Florisz,
 should steer to the Southward, whilst 
Tromp
 with Vice-Admiral 
de Wit
 should move to the North∣ward, that so by shutting up the Enemies Squa∣drons within the 
Downs,
 they might attack them with the greater effect. But the 
English,
 especi∣ally 
Bodley,
 who was returned with a Squa∣dron of 8 men of War, and 8 Merchant Ships, from the Mediteranean, were come to an Anchor under the Castles of the 
Downs,
 of which 
Tromp
 had had advice; 
Bodley
 to escape him, had re∣moved to the Westward, so that Admiral 
Florisz
 coming thither first, found no more but two lit∣tle Ships that were retired under the Cannon of the Castles of 
Dover,
 and the 
Downs,
 the 
Dutch
 begun then to Cannonade them briskly, to which they returned as vigorously; But the 
Hollanders
 at length getting nearer 
Dover,
 found in that road 5 small vessels, of which three were taken, tho' they had at the very first sight of our Ships, cut their Cables, to escape, the fourth fled, and the fifth which was a Frigat retired quite under the Castle.




The 
English
 fired most terribly from the Ca∣stle of 
Dover
 upon the 
Hollanders,
 but 
Tromp
 answered them so vigorously, that all the Inha∣bitants of the Country were alarmed at it, know∣ing not where to flie, and durst not stay in their Houses which they saw unroofed by the 
Holland∣ers
 Cannon balls.


After that Expedition, 
Tromp
 advanced to∣wards 
Swartness,
 where being informed, that the 
English
 Fleet had appeared near the 
Ʋlie,
 he thereupon resolved to go in search of them, and on the 24th. having discovered them over against 
Newport,
 he made up directly to them. The 
Dutch
 Fleet was then composed of 98 men of War, but all of them much smaller, and nothing near so well provided for War, as those of the 
English.
 The Wind was North-East, and the 
English
 had the Weather-gage. The two Fleets having re∣mained some time in presence of one another, without any offer made by the 
English,
 to attack the 
Hollanders, Tromp
 did all he could by Luf∣fing to get up to them; when he came nigh them, the 
English
 began at length to cast their Fleet into a line of Battle, and divided it into three Squadrons. They at first made a Motion with design to enclose the 
Dutch
 within a Cre∣scent, but when they saw the others observe them very narrowly, and seem resolved to stand them, their Squadrons joyned again, and advanced with∣in Cannon shot of their Enemy; and then 
Monk
 and 
Dean
 gave the signal for Battle and so the two Fleets engaged about 11 a Clock before noon.


The Wind being North West favoured 
De Ruiter
's Squadron, so that he taking advantage of that opportunity fell upon the 
English,
 and got the Weather-gage of them, and then the two Fleets most vigorously charged one another Ad∣miral 
Dean
 was killed by one of the first shot that flew from the 
Hollanders;
 
Monk
 seeing

 him fall, covered the Body with his Cloak, and endeavoured to encourage the Sea men. The fight was furious, and bloody, particularly be∣tween 
Lawson
's and 
de Ruiter
's Squadrons; For this latter fought with such Courage and obsti∣nate eagerness, that he consumed most part of his Powder, then 
Tromp
 came into his assistance, which 
Monk
 perceiving, he advanced with his main strength, and fell upon the 
Dutch
 Admiral, which redoubled the fury of the Fight, and the Courage of the Combatants.


Lawson
 at the head of 9 or 10 Frigats, advanc'd with intent to intercept the Captains 
Vander Zaan,
 and 
Joost Bulter,
 of 
Groningen,
 who made great resistance, but at length 
Bulter
's Ship, cal∣led the 
Camel,
 having received 4 or 5 shot be∣tween Wind and Water, was forced to yield, and presently after sunk: 
Bulter
 who was wounded in the middle of his Body with a splin∣ter, died with his drawn hanger in his hand, and was swallowed up half dead by the Waves with part of his wounded men; the rest of the Ships crew saved themselves on board 
Vander Zaan,
 who ran great hazard of being involv'd in the same misfortune as 
Bulter,
 being likewise surrounded by the Enemies, but at last he made his way through them by sinking one of their Ships. 
Tromp
 made all imaginable efforts to grapple the 
English
 Admiral, but never could get near enough to him. While they were fighting, the wind hapning quite to fall, the 
English
 White Squadron was by that means separated from the rest of their Fleet; the 
Hollanders
 willing to improve that opportunity, advanced with design to inter∣cept it, whilst the 
English
 on the other, did all they could, to rejoin their Forces, but before they could effect it, the 
Dutch
 pressed close up∣on the 
English
 Blue Squadron, and with broad∣sides made their way through the 
English
 Fleet.




The Victory having a long time Wavered, be∣gun then to declare it self for the 
Hollanders,
 who making their Enemies give way, pursued them, but a great disorder hapning in their Fleet, the 
English
 knew so well to make their advantage of it, that they gained the Weather-gage of them, which gave life to a second Engagement no less bloody than the first, and which caused the de∣struction of the most part of the Ships that com∣posed both the Fleets. About 9 at night ano∣ther 
English
 Ship was burnt, but they continu∣ed still fighting till the night parted them; And then the 
English
 stood to the Northward, and the 
Hollanders
 to the South-ward; but un∣fortunately, when the Enemies were already reti∣red out of Canon shot, as Captain 
Van Velzen
 was firing off his last shot, his Powder took fire, and blew up his Ship with almost all his Men, hardly 55 escaping of the whole Ships Crew.


The whole night was spent in repairing the damages received in the Battle, and mending up as well as possible, the Ships that were most bat∣tered. At break of day, next morning, the two Fleets found themselves not above a mile distant one from the other. Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 put out the usual signal to call his Officers on board him, at whose arrival, he with much vexa∣tion heard the ill news, that most part of the Ships of his Fleet wanted Ammunition, by which they were disabled to stand a second Battle. It must be confessed, that if 
Tromp
 had been se∣conded as he ought to have been the day before, by some Captains in his Fleet that failed in their duty, and were false to the fidelity they had sworn to their Country, the 
English
 had been so well reduced to reason, that they would hardly have had any mind to begin a new Battle the next day. Vice-Admiral 
de Wit
 had so small a Quanti∣ty of Powder and Bullets left, that it would hardly serve him three hours firing: and 
de Ruiter
 had less

 than he: And besides, a great many other Ships were much weakened by the great Numbers of Men they had killed, and sick. Notwithstand∣ing all these disadvantages, 
Tromp
 was in the mind to venture a second Battle, as thinking, if he were worsted to retreat toward 
Wielingen,
 to take in necessary Provisions and Ammunition. But be∣fore the second Fight begun, 
Tromp
 Writ to the States the following Letter.




High and Mighty Lords,


THe 12th. Instant we perceived the Enemies hovering about 
Newport.
 Our Forces con∣sisted of 98 men of War, and 6 Fire-Ships, and those of the 
English
 of between 95 and 100 sail, amongst which were reckoned 77 or 80 large Men of War, or Frigats well manned and provided. The two Fleets engaged in Fight about 11 a Clock before noon, and ended not till night which separated the two Parties, who both stood off to Sea about 9 a Clock. We lost that day Captain 
Joost Bulter,
 whose Ship was sunk with part of her Men, the other be∣ing saved by our people. Captain 
Velzen
's Ship was blown up, there being but 5 of her men saved. This day all the General and Sub∣alternate Officers of the Fleet came on board the Admiral, and were informed, that the most part of them had so little Ammunition left, that 'tis impossible for us to be able to stand a second Fight. Among others, Vice-Admiral 
de Wit
 has not for above three hours spending, and 
de Ruiter
 has less than he. However, we have resolved to attack the Enemies this day, and to retire to 
Wielingen,
 and fight our way thi∣ther retreating, if the 
English
 
esist to Fight so long. In fine, we pray your High and Migh∣tinesses, that we may be Rein
ted, and may

 receive the Ammunition necessary, and that it may please you, to send Deputies into 
Zealand
 to remedy all things, 
&c.




Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 had done all he could from the first appearance of the morning,
 to tack to the South-East, to be able to get the Weather gage which the English had, that so he might the more successfully force his way into the middle of their Fleet. About 8 a Clock the Van-guards of the two Fleets began to fire at one another at a distance; but 
Tromp
 pur∣suing his design, had already about 10 a Clock got 
Dunkirk
 at the South-South Eastward of him, and was in hopes to get up to the main bo∣dy of the 
English
 Fleet, and to intercept a good part of their Ships. But they were no sooner en∣gaged, but their hapned a Calm, which was the cause, that the 
Hollanders
 found themselves to the lee-ward, and the 
English
 had the Weathergage; which opportunity they improving, came Thun∣dering about 11 a Clock upon the 
Dutch
 Fleet, with so much the greater advantage, because 
Blake
 had reinforced them in the night with a Squadron of 28 great men of War which he had brought from 
Portsmouth. Tromp
 thereby found himself obliged to close up the Rear of his Fleet, to en∣deavour as well as 'twas possible, to sustain the shock of the Enemies. 
Tromp, De Wit, De Ruiter,
 and some others fought with an unparal∣lel'd bravery; But unhapily from the very beginning of the fight, a disorder having hapned in the 
Dutch
 Fleet for want of Experience in the Officers, they began to give way, and at length were part of them taken, and part sunk; nay, the Confusion was so great among them, that some of them quitted their Fire-Ships after having set fire to them themselves, who endeavour∣ed to palliate their infamous Cowardice, by pre∣tending, they had received several shot between

 Wind and Water. However, tho' the valiant 
Tromp
 saw himself thus deserted by his Rear-guard, yet he lost not his courage for that, but possessing still the same presence of mind, and being ani∣mated by Reflections upon his past glory, and by the hopes and unextinguishable passion he had, still to maintain it to the last, grapled Vice-Admiral 
Pen,
 boarded him, and power-d so many men into his Enemies Ship; that he had already made himself Master of her, when 13 
English
 Frigats tacking about upon him, so cruelly hand∣led him, that they forced him to let go his hold.


The Enemies likewise in their turn, grapling afterwards Admiral 
Tromp,
 powred in so great a Number of Sea men, on board him that his men were forced to flie all under Deck. Upon which, 
Tromp
 seeing himself over powr'd with Numbers, thought there was no other Remedy, but to set fire to some barrels of Powder, which he did so effectually, that in an Instant as by a clap of Thunder, the Enemies were blown up Pell Mell into the Air, and their bodies were seen to flie about half burnt, and rent to pieces. Yet this blow did not so much discourage the 
English,
 but they came on and charged him afresh; and he had certainly been lost, had not 
de Wit
 and 
de Ruiter,
 espying the great danger he was in, come up without losing time and disengaged him about 7 a Clock in the Evening.


Captain 
Schellinger
's Ship being much battered, and deserted by most of her Sea men, fell into the 
English
 Fleet, and was soon after burnt to Ashes. The Ship 
Westergoo,
 being surrounded, by three 
English
 men of War, that furiously battered her on all sides, was forced to yield just when she was ready to sink; a little before that, Captain 
Verburg
's Ship having had her Helm shot away, fell into the Enemies hands, and after a vigo∣rous resistance, was at last constrained also to

 yield. 
Tromp
 and the other General Officers fought till within night, when the 
English
 made off to Sea, steering North-ward; but the 
Hollanders
 made for 
Ostend,
 where they arrived about mid∣night, and cast Anchor.


The next morning the 
English
 appear'd again; But because there were many Ships in the 
Dutch
 Fleet very much shattered, and that wanted both Provision and Ammunition, 
Tromp
 with the advice of the other General Officers, thought it best to retreat with the whole Fleet towards 
Wielingen,
 where being arrived he writ the fol∣lowing Letter to the States General.




High and Mighty Lords,


YEsterday at 11 a Clock before noon,
 I writ my last Letter just when I was using all my endeavours to gain the weather-gage, in order to fall into the middle of the Enemies Fleet, But a Calm preventing us, the Enemies gained it, and came up and attackt us. The Fight broke not off till towards Evening. There hapned some disorder amongst some Ships of the Fleet, caused doubtless by the Ignorance and want of Experience of the Sea Officers, which was the reason that the nimblest 
English
 sailors coming up with them, easily intercept∣ed them, and either took or sunk them. So that according to the report made to us this morning on board the Admiral, we hear, that the Captains, 
Verburg, Schellinger, Laurensz, Duin, Fietersz,
 and 
Westergoo,
 are fallen into the hands of the Enemies. If there were any more taken or sunk, it is more than I know yet, because I have been able to know no∣thing but by the report of others, and because the thick smoak arising from the Canon, hin∣dred,

 me from discerning what past in the Fight; But however, I am sure we have lost the Cap∣tains abovementioned. It is possible they might lose us in the night, and may be gotten into some Harbour, tho' against Order. The Pilot 
Van∣der Heyden,
 being just now come hither, has delivered us the two Letters from your High and Mightinesses, dated the 9th. of this Month. he reports, he met 17 of our Ships before 
Schow∣en,
 and that he spoke with 4 of them. Our Ships are in a most pitifull Condition, and want both Provisions and Ammunition. The two Fleets are still in presence one of the o∣ther, and the 
English
 with the Reinforcement they have received are now 100 sail strong of Men of War. By the advice of all the Gene∣ral Officers of the Fleet; we have resolved to retire to 
Wielingen,
 to wait there for the De∣puties of your High and Mightinesses, to come and give Order, that the Fleet may receive the necessary Ammunition, and a considerable Rein∣forcement, to enable them to make head against their Enemies. For otherwise, Humanely speak∣ing, if all the things I have spoken of, be neg∣lected, nothing else can be expected but shame and confusion to the States, and misfortune to their Arms, considering the mighty power of their Enemies. Our Admiral Ship, the 
Brede∣rode
 has received several shot between Wind and Water, and tho we have had her calkt as well as possible, yet she leaks still so much, that in the night the Water gained upon us, in spite of all our Pumps, above 5 foot in height, however till at present we have made a shift by the help of many hands to keep her above Water; but if after all, we find our la∣bour lost, we shall be obliged to run her a∣shore behind Ramekens, 
&c.






Tromp,
 and the rest of the General Officers of the 
Dutch
 Fleet being come to 
Flushing,
 into the presence of the Deputies of the States,
 they all una∣nimously declare'd, that it was impossible for them, to continue their Services, unless the Fleet were re-inforc'd with a considerable number of Great Ships, well appointed and furnisht for War; And so much the more, because there were in the English Fleet above 50 Men of War, the least of which was better than that in which Ad∣miral 
Tromp
 sail'd, whereas on the contrary, there were reckon'd above 50 Ships in the 
Dutch
 Fleet that were unfit for Service, 
&c. De Ruiter
 made no scruple to say, That he in∣tended to go no more to Sea,
 unless the Fleet were re-inforc'd, and made more numerous, and were better Arm'd than it had been before: And Vice-Admiral 
De wit
 being afterwards present in the Assembly of the States, added to all those Complaints, these words: 
Why should I keep any longer silence? I am here before my Soveraigns, and am free to speak; and I can say, That the
 English 
are at present Masters both of us, and of the Seas,
 &c.


The States General therefore endeavoured to re∣medy all those Disorders, and to repair all the los∣ses they had lately sustained, as well as 'twas pos∣sible, in so pressing a juncture. But in the mean time, the English Fleet held the Coasts of 
Hol∣land,
 as 'twere besieged, after they had stopt up the mouth of the 
Texel:
 Which obliged the States to prevent any discent from them, to post some Troops in the Isles, and on the Coasts. During which Distress, 3 Ships returning from the 
East-Indies,
 richly Laden, unfortunately fell into the hands of the 
English,
 as did likewise two others coming from 
Portugal,
 and 3 more from 
Swede∣land,
 whereof 2 were Burnt, and the rest taken. And towards the straits of 
Callis,
 Captain 
Wight
 likewise, was taken with 4 Ships laden with Salt.




About that time the United Provinces began to feel the Effects of new Troubles raised by a Fa∣ction formed among the 
Mobb,
 which being al∣ways accustomed to measure things only by the Event, attributed the Cause of the Disasters of the State, and of the destruction of Commerce, to their Governours. For Trading was interrup∣ted, and the Artificers and Handy-craft People knew not which way to subsi
t any longer. The Town of 
Enkuisen
 had a great hand in all these Disorders. The Towns-men being desperately en∣raged, to see the Sea shut up against them, and their Fleet that was ready to sail out to go a Herring-fishing, on which in great measure de∣pended the Prosperity of all the United Provin∣ces, to be thus Coopt up, and forced to lie idle in their Ports.


The murmurings of the people were risen to that height, that 'twas impossible to stop them. For they loudly complained, that none of them could tell how to get their living any longer, what Trade soever they took to; That if they had a mind to oppose the 
English,
 why did not 
Tromp
 come back from 
Zealand?
 Why were not the Ene∣mies driven out of the Harbors of the 
Texel,
 who without controul, took daily from them Ship after Ship, whilst they saw themselves besieged, and threat∣ned with an inevitable Series of Mischiefs, 
&c.


The Magistrates of that Town, thinking to put a stop to the fatal Consequences of all those Disor∣ders, would needs have Recourse to force of Arms, and sent for some Troops which in Boats approacht the Town: But the 
Mobb
 the more fiercely inra∣ged at that, got together in such multitudes, that they carried all before them, and seized upon the Town-House, the Gates, the Ramparts, and all the Stores of Warlike Amunition. Which done, they put up upon the Towers, the Princes Colours, as de∣signing by that, to revenge the slight the Govern∣m
nt had of late put upon his Authority: They

 then proceeded to Depose the Magistrates, and fi∣red several Vollies of Shot from their Muskets, upon the Souldiery that was embarked in the Boats. The Deputies from the States, and the Sieur 
Bre∣derode,
 who were sent from the 
Hague,
 to ap∣pease, if it were possible this popular Commoti∣on, were constrained to stay without the Town-Gate. And if the Gentleness and Moderation which they used had not at last prevailed over the Fury and Insolence of those rash and headstrong Mu∣tiniers, they would have been in great danger of being overturned with their Coaches off from the Cawsey into the Sea.


So Bold an example open'd a door to the licen∣ciousness of other Factious Spirits, which was so much the more dangerous, because the Affairs they meddled with, were both Nice and Im∣portant.


The War against the 
English
 was not heartily undertaken, said they,
 and yet the Subjects of the United Provinces were daily more and more impoverished thereby. They further alledged, that the interruption of Commerce both within and without the Country, presaged already great misfortunes to them, their Numerous Inhabitants being able to subsist no longer, being deprived as they were, of traffiking with the neighbouring States. That if they had Forces, they ought to be employed, to free the Sea from the Yoak of a Power that claim'd to it self the sole Dominion of it; That they had reason to fear the worst that could be imagined from the cruel Injustice of their Neighbours, if after having lost so much Blood, they should fall to so low an ebb of strength as to be unable to resist the Enemy; That their Merchant Ships were taken in view of the 
Texel,
 and the Seamen made the Innocent victims of Cruelty; That their Ships were so ill Equipt, that they were not able to resist the full man∣ned, and well appointed Ships of the

 
English;
 
 that they were no longer, able to support the Violences and Hostilities used by them to the States Ships, the major part of them having been shattered to pieces by their Guns, their Masts and all their Rigging being shot away close by the Board; that to Compleat their Misfortune, if there were left any that made resistance, they were basely deserted in their danger, by their cowardly compa∣nions; that if there were any shadow of Justice yet left, the crimes of those cowardly deserters ought not to be suffered to go so long unpunisht; and that they ought to have been brought sooner to condign Punishment, that they might serve for such effe∣ctual examples to others, as might make them more heartily and faithfully stick for the future, to the interest of their Reputation, and of their Country. After all which they represented, the Tranquility the Government had enjoyed under the happy and auspicious influence of the 
State-Holders,
 who had the only secret harmoniously to accord and reconcile so many jarring Tem∣pers, and different Spirits; That a Power com∣posed of so many Heads was but a monstrous 
Hydra,
 from whence sprung all the disorders that troubled the Repose of the State; That the sen∣sible decay that had lately happened in all their Affairs, was a manifest consequence of the plura∣lity of their Governours; That the inequality, or subordinate dependence of the one upon the other, kept the Power of the State in a due 
Aequi∣librium;
 That none of them could pretend to be ignorant, that they were all beholding for the sweet Liberty they then enjoyed, to the House of 
Nassau;
 That that Illustrious House had been always the most firm and solid pillar and support of their Peace and Happiness: That they had reason to thank God, for that they had still left so worthy and hopeful a Sprout of so Noble and Pre∣cious a Blood: That the United Provinces never had any reason to Complain of the moderation of

 their Government: And that therefore, they could not comprehend for what reason the lawful heir of that 
August
 Family was not put into posses∣sion of the Offices and Dignities which his Pre∣decessors had justly merited for him and his De∣scendants, by so many Brave and Glorious Actions.


This was the substance of the peoples discourse, who were animated by the name of 
Orange,
 which they repeated, every moment, without paying any deference to the Orders of the States. And the Drummers that beat up for raising of Seamen, with∣out making use of the old accustomed Terms, 
In the name of the Prince of
 Orange, were ill handled by the people; so that at last the Government was obliged to publish an Ordinance to put a stop to those Commotion; and at the same time another was likewise set out, to forbid the car∣rying of any Provisions to the 
English
 Fleet that lay before the 
Texel
 and the 
Ʋlie.


In the mean while the 
English
 did a wonderful deal of mischief upon the Coasts of 
Holland,
 but were partly punished for it by the loss of 3 of their Ships that run a Ground upon the Sands of the Coast; they had also some Boats overset.


Amidst all these Transactions, the 
Hollanders
 wrought with all the diligence imaginable upon the Fleet, in order to Repair and Re-inforce, and Man, and Provide it sufficiently to be in a capa∣city to put again to Sea. But because most part of the Ships were equipt in 
Zealand,
 they were in extreme pain to study out a means, how those that came from 
Zealand
 should joyn with those that were in the 
Texel,
 since the 
English
 were Masters of its enterance, and kept the Coasts of 
Holland
 besieged. However 
Tromp
 after six weeks stay in 
Zealand,
 put at length to Sea the 6th of 
August,
 with a Fleet of between 80 and 90 Sail, with a resolution, assoon as he had joyned

 Vice-Admiral 
De Wit
's Squadron, to make up d¦rectly to the 
English,
 to give them Battle, and chase them if possible, from the Coasts of 
Hol∣land.


About that time the States General of the United Provinces, to encourage their Officers and Sea men of the Fleet, the more heartily and warmly to bestir themselves in the Service of their Country, by the hopes of Reward, publisht a Declaration, which was Read on Board every Man of War, and was as follows.


The States General of the United Provinces have thought fit for the greater encouragement of their Officers and Seamen vigorously to per∣form their respective Duties in the Service of their Dear Country, to Declare; That whoso∣ever shall Board any of the Enemies Ships, and shall take it, shall have the Ship with the Men and all that belongs to her for his free Booty; That he who shall Board the Chief Admiral, shall have not only the Ship and all her Equi∣page to himself, but a Recompense besides, of 10000 
Livers;
 and for the Ships of the other Admirals, 6000 
Livers,
 and for those of the Sub∣alternate General Officers, 4000 
Livers
 a piece; Those who should have the Courage with their Arms in their hands, to venture to go and pull down the Flag off from the Main-mast of the Enemies Admiral Ship, shall receive a 1000 
Livers
 recompence, and for those of the other Admirals 500 
Livers
 each. For the Flag of a Fore-mast 150 
Li∣vers,
 for that upon the Poop 150, and for those of less consideration, 50 
Livers
 a piece. And moreover, we give express notice by these presents to all Captains and other Sea-Officers, that in case any of them with his Ship shall offer to depart from the Admirals Flag, without the consent of the Lieutenant Admiral of the Fleet, shall be punisht with Death without Remssion. Given

 at the 
Hague,
 the 4th of the Month of 
August
 New Stile, 1653.


A few days after, they publisht another Or∣dinance, by which they granted certain fixed re∣compences, to those who should be maimed in the Service of their Country, which were as fol∣lows.

The recompence of those that were only lam'd was left to the discretion of the Colleges of the Admiralty. There was also a Regulation made,
 by which those who were incurable, and conse∣quently uncapable of getting any part of their sub∣sistence, were allowed a Pension each of them of a Crown a Week.


The 
Holland
 Fleet then being got to Sea, arri∣ved the 7th of 
August
 towards the Evening, to the Northwards of 
Gravezande;
 on the 8th at break of day, they sailed near to 
Zandwoort,
 and advanced about 8 a Clock the same morning near 
Egmond.
 Their advanc'd Guard detacht some of their best Sailers, to advertise 
Tromp,
 that the 
English
 Fleet were but 5 Miles from him to the North-Eastward, and soon after they begun to perceive them. About a 11 a Clock, the 
Eng∣lish
 got the Weather-gage, the wind being 
West-North-West.


 However 
Tromp
 thought it best to tack about to the 
South-South-West,
 to make away from the Enemies, with design to draw them after him, and intice them to quit the 
Texel,
 that Vice-Admiral 
De Wit
 taking advantage of their with∣drawing, might the more easily get out of the Harbours there, with the rest of the Fleet. The light Frigats of the 
English
 took that day some of the 
Dutch
 Ships that being sluggish Sailers lagg'd behind the rest. The Van-guards of both Fleets being come near one another,
 began to play at one another with their Guns. 
Trump
 stood the assault of the 
English
 without Flinching, and so the two Fleets engaged in a general fight, which was terrible and bloody. The 
English
 Fleet was 120 Sail strong. Here follows the Letter written by 
Tromp
 to the States about it.




High and Mighty Lords,


MY last was dated yesterday at 8 at night, before 
Scheveling;
 the wind was then South-West. We sail'd all night along by the Coasts, and arrived to day at 8 in the morning near 
Egmond.
 A little time after, some Captains detacht from our Advanced-Guard, came on Board the Admiral, to tell us, they had disco∣vered the 
English Fleet
 before the 
Texel,
 at a∣bout 5 miles distance to the North and a quar∣ter Eastward from us. We immediately tackt about to make up to them. About a 11 a Clock, the wind turn'd to the 
West-North-West,
 and the 
Eng∣lish
 had the advantage of it: upon which, we thought fit to draw back, to oblige the Enemy to draw likewise out from the 
Texel,
 to facili∣tate thereby the coming out of the rest of the Fleet under the conduct of Vice-Admiral 
De Wit.


 But having in the Fleet some very sluggish Sailers, which some of the Enemies light Frigats fell fiercely upon, several of them were taken. The 
English
 are 120 sail strong, great and small ships▪ we stood them, and engaged in a general Battle that lasted till the beginning of the night, with∣out any advantage, God be thanked, that we could perceive, they got over us. They have still the Weathergage. Time will inform us, how affairs will go to morrow. We pray God to be pleased of his Clemency, to make all suc∣ceed to his great Glory, and for the Good and Advantage of the State. If we had received the Reinforcement from the 
Texel,
 we should have reason to flatter our selves, humanely speaking, with some hopes of driving away the Enemies from our Coasts. However, we will do all that Men of Honour and Fidelity to our Country, shall be able to do in such a rencounter as this, 
&c.




The day following, the Wind was so high that it was impossible to renew the Battle; which ex∣tremely favoured the 
Hollanders.
 For by that means Vice-Admiral 
De Wit
 had time to come out of the 
Texel,
 being hastned by the Deputies of the States, who upon advice of the two Fleets be∣ing come in presence of one another before 
Eg∣mond,
 made him use all the diligence imaginable. He came out then about midnight by the 
Spanish Hole,
 conducted by 4 Sounders, who went be∣fore him in Boats, having each of them an open Lanthorn with them; and so he arrived at the place of Battle.


On the 9th. of 
August
 at 6 a Clock in the morning, 
Tromp
 being right against 
Scheveling,
 approached the Enemies, being backt by some men of War of the Van guard, and fired at them some broad sides, but finding himself too weak, he retired towards 
de Ruiter
's Squadron, and stood to the North North-East. And the Wind

 being again grown fiercer, it was impossible for the two Fleets to engage, upon which, the 
Dutch
 Fleet approach'd again to the 
Meuse.
 The Wind turning afterwards to the North West, the 
English
 had the Weather-gage, and pursued the 
Hollanders.


About noon, 
de Wit
 begun to appear with a Reinforcement of 27 Men of War, and 4 Fire-Ships. The two Fleets joyned about 5 in the afternoon, in sight of the Enemies Fleet, they not being able to hinder them. 
Tromp
 being then 106 sail strong, advanced directly towards the Enemies, who at first seemed to flie, only out of design, as afterwards it proved, to get more convenient Sea room; 
Tromp
 pursued them all night with a Wind North-West, and a quar∣ter West, and the day following being the 10th. of 
August,
 the two Fleets met again before the 
Meuse
 over against 
Heide
 and 
Scheveling.


Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 led the right Wing, 
de Ruiter,
 the left, 
Evertsz
 the main Battle, and 
de Wit
 and Rear-Admiral 
Florisz,
 the Rear-guard. And so the Fleet being divided into 5 Squa∣drons, fell as soon as it was Morning, upon the 
English.
 There never was any thing seen so cruel and so bloody as the beginning of that fight. One would have said at first view, that the Sun being covered with a thick smoak, en∣deavoured to hide his face, that he might not be the spectator of so horrible a slaughter. The noise of the Canon much louder than that of Thunder made all the neighbouring shores to tremble, and flying from thence to spend it self in the 
Downs,
 was redoubled thence by Echo's, and became much more frightfull. And the Sea being tinged all over with the blood of so many Butcheries, swallowed up with equal greediness both Men and Ships.




Tromp
 had already the first time pierced into the 
English
 Fleet with so much success, that he had some reason to flatter himself with the ho∣pes of a Victory; and coming on a second time, and falling upon the biggest of the 
English
 men of War, there the undaunted Courage of that Great Admiral, and the bravery of his Seamen, were seen to shine forth in their full Glory: For sometimes he went into the Captains Chamber, and taking up a Telescope, he took a view of all the Squadrons of his Fleet, and observed whether every one did his duty or no, and thence re∣turning again upon Deck, he went and encoura∣ged his men, and used all the Rhetorick he could to inspire them with love for their Country. However, after all, being engaged a great way within the very heart of the Enemies Fleet, he found himself overpower'd by their Numbers, and deserted by his own Ships, at which, conceiving a mortal resentment, he uttered these words: 
VVill any thing be done or no? I must it seems perish! No body comes in to my assistance; Must I alone this day, be the Victime of the Enemies?
 His Ship being covered with a thick Cloud of smoke was not to be seen any longer, and in the mean while the 
English
 Rear-Admiral followed by some Frigats, approaching to him, there flew from the third of that Rank,
 a fatal ball that struck him on the left Temple, as he was giving order about his Guns, and laid him for dead at the feet of his Lamenting Seamen.


So mournfull an accident pierced them to the Quick, that to revenge the death of so valiant a man, and that it might not be said, the Author of so terrible an Action went unpunisht, a Com∣mon soldier of the Admiral Ship, advancing up∣on the Deck, shot the Captain of the aforesaid Frigat in the cheek, and fell'd him dead with a musket Bullet, as he was making Bravado's with his drawn hanger in his hand. Lieutenant

 Admiral 
Tromp
 being carried immediately into the Captains Chamber, was laid upon a Pillow, and some moments after, gave up the Ghost, af∣ter he had exhorted his Seamen, to fight like men of Courage and prayed God to take into his protection all that were under his Command. Some report,
 that at the approach of death, he addressed these words to his men? 
I have finisht my Course, have good Courage.


In the mean while, the Ship, 
Brederode
 was engaged within the main Body of the Enemies Fleet; and because every one attentively lookt out to see whether the Bloody Flagg which was the signal for coming on board, appeared upon the Admirals Poop, the Chief Officers of the 
Dutch
 Fleet, found by that, they were Com∣manded on board the Admiral. Where being come, and being informed of their great loss, upon a consultation held thereupon, they all re∣solved, that to prevent the Seamens being dis∣couraged, the death of the valiant 
Tromp
 should be concealed; and recommended to the Captain on board the Admirals Ship, that he should keep to the Orders 
Tromp
 had before given, and keep up same Flag. After which they all hastned back e∣very one to his respective Ship, and continued the fight.


Upon this fatal blow, it appear'd what a de∣sperate and undaunted resolution are able to make men do: For all the Captains of the Fleet were so sensibly toucht at the loss of their Admiral, that breathing nothing but rage and fury, they pierced three times through and through the Enemies Fleet, fiercely firing at and battering all that opposed their passage; but as an addition to the unhappiness of that unfortunate day, Vice-Admiral 
Evertsz
's Ship, who after 
Tromp
's death had the chief Command of the Fleet, was so miserably shattered and disabled, that to avoid falling into the hands of the 
English,
 they were

 forced to carry her off into the 
Meuse,
 having on board her 70 men killed or wounded. 
De Ruiter
 who was in the Ship called the 
Lamb,
 carrying about 40 Guns and 150 men, was exposed to the greatest fire of the Enemies, fighting with so much Courage, that he made his way through the midst of the 
English
 Squadron; but he found himself at length so extreamly weakned, that he had hardly half his men left, 43 of them being killed, and 35 wounded: His mizzen mast, his main yard, and in General, all his rigging except of his Poop was shot away, and of Ammunition he had but 700 pound of Powder and very few Bullets left, so that seeing himself reduced into so pitifull a Condition that he was no longer able to keep the Sea, he was at last forced to be towed a∣way into the 
Meuse
 by Captain 
Aldertsz de Hoorn.


The 
English
 Admiral being grappled by two Fire-Ships, his Ship was in an instant all in a flame, and some of his men began already to flie out of her; they which were about Captain 
Peacock
 were at the last extremity; and Cap∣tain 
Bitter
 was compleating their destruction by plying them with frequent broad-sides, but that one of the Fire-Ships hapning to be too slowly pusht forward, gave time and occasion to the 
English
 to take new Courage, and briskly to im∣ploy their Guns again, and beat off their Ene∣mies. The 
English
 Ship, the St. 
Andrew,
 having been furiously battered by the Guns of Vice-Admiral 
Florisz,
 was so terribly maul'd and shat∣tered, that it was ready to sink, being half con∣sumed with the flames, had not two other Ships come in timely to her aid, and rescued her from the Eminent danger she was in. Captain 
Grave
 perisht by fire with a great many of his Seamen. As for Captain 
Haas
 who Commanded the Ship called, the 
Rose
 and 
Crown,
 being attackt by 3 
English
 Men of War, he defended himself vigorous∣ly,

 till such time as his Masts and all his rig∣ging being shot away close by the board, his ves∣sel half burnt, and many of his men kill'd, he thought fit to retreat, and as much shattered and disa∣bled as he was, made his way through the Ene∣mies, and got likewise to 
Goree.


Hoyen Cox,
 whom we have several times men∣tioned upon occasion of the Ship 
Phoenix,
 and Captain 
Zanger,
 fought against one another with so much courage and obstinacy, that both their Ships, 
viz.
 The 
Phoenix
 and the 
West Kappel
 were sunk. 
Schatter
 finding himself engaged with the Van guard of 
Monk
's Squadron, made head a∣gainst them alone, and if his Ship, the 
Golden Dolphin
 had not at last been sunk, being pierced through and through as she was with Bullets, he would doubtless have made the Enemies pay some∣what dearer for her loss: But however fortune being willing in some sort to recompence desert, had compassion of so many brave men, and per∣mitted a Frigat to pass by his side, as he was just rea∣dy to be swallowed up by the Waves, and hap∣pily to save him and all his men. But Captain 
Vanger
 was more unfortunate then those Prison∣ers, his Ship and all his men sinking in an in∣stant into the deep.


We ought likewise to allow an honourable place in the list of those that signaliz'd them∣selves in this fight, to 
de Wilde,
 and to the Cap∣tains 
Marreveld, Swart,
 and 
de Kampen.
 About 2 a Clock in the afternoon, both the contend∣ing parties begun to make out into the wide Sea. The 
Dutch
 had broken four times quite through the Enemies Fleet, so that there was no∣thing to be seen almost but masts tumbled in∣to the Sea, and several Ships on fire both of the one and other side, amongst which there was one 
English
 Ship that was blown up, and some others that were sunk. 
Schevelin, Heide, Kat∣wik, Nordwyk, Zandvort,
 and all the whole

 Coast were Witnesses of this bloody fight, and of the bravery of two such formidable Nations. By favour of a Western Wind, the two Fleets approacht the Coasts of 
Holland,
 however the E∣nemies were observed to use all their endeavours to retire, and the 
Dutch
 thereupon were perswa∣ded to believe, they had some disadvantage; so that finding the 
English
 stood to the Northward, they resumed the courage to pursue them, after they had received a recruit of 30000 pound of Powder and other Ammunition proportionable, which was brought them by some Fishing vessels. The Wind rising higher, the two Fleets by favour of the Tide, approach'd towards 
Gorce,
 and continu∣ed firing at one another till 11 a Clock at night. At last the Wind chopping about to the South-West, drove them insensibly towards the 
Texel.
 The 
English
 having made a tack to the Westward, set sail, whilst 20 
Dutch
 Captains detaching themselves from the body of their Fleet, shamefully deserted the line of Battle, and steer∣ed away for the 
Texel.
 The Moon then shone so bright, that the 
English
 perceived it; which made them conceive new hopes, and encouraged them to give the 
Dutch
 another on set, upon which, Fifty more of the Ships of the 
Holland
 Fleet that had suffered most, fled away to the North∣ward, whilst a good part of the rest threw them∣selves cross the Sand-banks! crying out? all was lost


After so fatal a rout, 30 other Ships that were least endamaged, came out of the Rear guard and advanced against the 
English.
 And Rear Ad∣miral 
Florisz
 endeavoured with those feeble and shattered relicks of so potent a Fleet, to cover the Admiral Ship the 
Brederode,
 which was in so much the more danger of falling into the Ene∣mies hands, bccause she was so cruelly shattered, that she was incapable of making any Resist∣ance. Yet her preservation was so much the

 dearer, and the more important for that the loss of the Battle depended thereon. The last new Encounter of this horrible Fight, lasted three full hours. Vice-Admiral 
de Wit
 let flie seve∣ral broad sides at the Cowardly deserters to stop them, if possible, but seeing all in vain, he rallied together into one body the rest of the Ships of the Fleet, by leaving the Main-sails but half displayed.


That unexpected firmness and resolution so much surprized the 
English,
 that being advanced as far as right against the Lordship of 
Brederode,
 they put up all the sail they could, and steered a∣way towards the Coasts of 
England,
 quitting those of 
Holland
 with much regret, and sore a∣gainst their Wills, as thinking they had won Glory enough, and that it would be too much to expose both it and their Fleet, in the shattered condition they were in, to prosecute their Vi∣ctory too far, and that after they had been at home and recruited, they might insult as they pleased over their vanquisht foes, before they could recover themselves of this last fatal blow. In their retreat, they set fire to some of their Ships that were so shattered and maul'd, that they were not able to get them back into their Ports. By favour of the night, the flames were seen from far, and the Sea was enlighted with them almost as much as if it had been by the Sun-beams at Noon day. The next morning, Vice-Admiral 
de VVit,
 found himself before 
Wyk,
 disengaged from all his Enemies, and sailed away with the rest of the Fleet towards the 
Texel.
 The loss of the 
Dutch
 in this Battle,
 according to their own account, amounted to no more than 9 men of War burnt or sunk, most of whose men were saved by the 
English,
 because they sunk amongst their Squadrons, so that by that means, they made above 700 Prisoners. The Ad∣miral Ship, 
Brederode
 and 3 other Ships were

 extremely shattered. There were 50 that had endured the hottest of the Enemies fire, and 30 others that were not so much exposed. The Number of their dead were reported to be but 500, tho' 'tis more probable 'twas 5000, and that of their wounded, 700 men.


The 
English
 are said to have lost, the 
Phoenix,
 the 
Oak,
 the 
Hunter,
 the 
George,
 the 
Prosperity,
 the 
Tulip,
 the 
Portland,
 the 
Dragon,
 the 
Lawrel,
 the 
VVillaim,
 and the 
Golden Cock.
 besides which, to facilitate their retreat, they are reported to have burnt 8 more that were not able to keep the Sea. 
Monk
 having been very severely hand∣led, was one of the first that went out of the fight. Amongst their dead, whose Number was said to amount, to 600, were Reckon'd, Rear-Admiral 
Graves,
 the Captains 
Peacock, Edmond, Chapman, John Tailour, VVilliam Newman, Hoy∣en Cox,
 and 
Crips.
 The Number of their woun∣ded was said to be little less than 2500, amongst whom were reckoned Vice Admiral 
Lawson,
 the Captains 
William Reus, Holland, Joseph Cubit, John Stokes,
 and some others. The Ships that had most suffered, as the 
Triumph,
 the 
St. An∣drew,
 the 
Assurance,
 and the most considerable Frigats, were sent into 
Yarmouth, Dover, Har∣wich,
 and 
Solbay,
 or to 
Chatham
 on the Med∣way. And 40 sail more, which were the rest of the 
English
 Fleet, came to an Anchor about 6 miles from the Coasts, to take in a fresh sup∣ply of Provisions and Ammunition.


Whilst the 
Dutch
 thus by palpable falsities en∣deavoured to cover their defeat, and indeed, to make it none at all, and to attribute the great∣est loss to the known Victors; The 
English
 were not behind hand with them, but ascribing to themselves the whole Glory of that Memorable Engagement, loudly proclaimed the defeat of the 
Hollanders
 all over 
England,
 spreading aboard a report that a Squadron of 24 
English
 men of

 War kept the miserable shattered Relicks of the 
Holland
 Fleet besieged before the 
Texel,
 and that 30 more fresh Ships were sailed out, to re∣inforce them, and to assist them to Compleat their destruction. And to render this represen∣tation of their Victory so much the more pro∣bable, they affected to publish a list of about 50 
Dutch
 men of War taken, burnt, or sunk in that Fight: And 
Monk
 had a chain of Gold, and 
Pen
 and 
Lawson,
 each of th
m a Silver Medal, as an honourable acknowledgment of their Ser∣vice in obtaining so signal a Victory.


The 
Hollanders
 on the Contrary, pretended the Victory was on their side, because said they, they had obliged the 
English
 to quit their Coasts which they had kept besieged for several weeks space, which was the end for which they fought, which exc
se was the more plausible, because it was well known, that the 
English
 retired to their own Coasts, the night after the Battle, tho' it was only to make a speedy return with a powerfull recruit of Ammunition and Shipping, as it would soon after have proved, to the great∣er terror of 
Holland,
 and perhaps to the ut∣ter destruction of their Sea power, before they could have had time to find means to recover themselves, if kind Providence, minded to reserve them for greater things, had not by a sudden turn of the Government in 
England,
 diverted their impending fate, and procured them a speedy Peace with that Nation.


The Body of Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 being sent on shore near the 
Helder,
 was carried in a Coach to the 
Hague,
 and thence conveyed by Water, to 
Delft
 the 5th. of 
September,
 and bu∣ried in the Quire of the old Church there. The order and solemnity observed in paying the Funeral honours to a Hero that was justly ac∣counted the Prime Sea General of his Age, and whose loss was resented by the States as a very

 sensible detriment to his Country, was this. The Guards of the States of 
Holland,
 to the Number of 400, marcht before, trailing their pikes and Colours, with the muzzles of their Muskets turn'd downwards, and their stocks covered with black cloth; After them followed 4 trum∣peters, accompanied with a Herald armed Cap-a-Pee, who represented the Admiralty; next them were carried the great Admiral Flag, the little Standard, the Coat of Arms, the Gantlets, Head∣piece, Spurs of Knight-hood, and the Sword. And immediately before the Body was led the Funeral Horse laden with all the Arms of the deceased, and cover'd over with a large Mantle of black Cloth, the corners of which were held up by some Sea Captains.


After the body, marched the Commissioners of the Admiralty, followed by the three Sons of the deceased Admiral, his Sons-in-Law, and others of his near kindred; after them went the States General, the Council of State, the States of 
Hol∣land,
 the great Council, the Court, and the Chamber of Accounts of 
Holland,
 accompanied by the Magistrates, the Ministers of the Eccle∣siastical Council, and the Burghers of the 
Hague.
 In this manner the Corps was conducted to the Boat, amidst the Tears and Lamentations of the people, to be conveyed to 
Delft,
 where he was recei∣ved by 4 Companies of Burghers in Arms, and Buried in the Church there, and honoured at his in∣terment with a farewel salute of 3 Vollies of Musket shot.


But the States General, to Immortalize his me∣mory, and leave a lasting Monument to Posteri∣ty, of the most valiant Hero that ever appear'd upon the Ocean, and whose name alone had made their Enemies tremble, granted the sum of 10000 Livers, for the erecting him a stately Tomb.




This Monument being made according to the directions of the famous 
de Kampen,
 Master 
Ar∣chitect
 to the States, was placed upon a high Pedestal, the Pilaster of which, as also the rai∣sed work going round them, are of white Mar∣ble, and the middle of Touchstone. The prin∣cipal part of that Pedestal jetts out in a square form, and bears upon its fore side, an Enchased Table of white Marble containing an Admi∣rable description of the Battle that cost 
Martin Tromp
 his life. On both sides, on the right and left, are to be seen several Ornamental works in Relief, or raised work, of white Marble, repre∣senting Crowns of Lawrel, Garlands of Fruits, and flowers, and Garnitures of Sea-shells.


Upon this Pedestal lies the Statue of the Ad∣miral in compleat Armor, with the head resting upon a piece of Cannon, the Body upon the Helm of a Ship. Behind the Body there is a square Table of Marble, in which is enchased a Plate of touch-stone, on which is engraven in Golden Letters, the Epitaph we shall afterwards recite. Underneath upon the same piece of Mar∣ble, are several pieces of raised work, represent∣ing several little Cupids, of which two are the most remarkable, which stand in the middle be∣hind the Admiral's Statue, one of them holding the Arms of the States General, and the other those of the States of 
Holland
 and 
Westfriesland,
 having before and behind them several Cornets, Battle-Axes, Pikes, ancient Bucklers, and other sorts of Roman Arms. On the left hand towards the Admiral's Feet, there is a Helmet garnisht with Plumes of Feathers, placed upon a Marble Cannon. Above those Armorial pieces, we have spoken of, there is a flying 
Cupid
 holding a Na∣val Crown, and above him another having his arms extended, with a scroul in which are writ∣ten these Latin Verses.




Ʋrbs Phoebi Cineres jactat, sed Currus Ho∣nores,


Ingreditur quoties, egrediturque Mari.


Of which we have endeavoured to represent the sense in 
English,
 thus,


From 
Phoebus
's City burning Ashes rain,


Whilst his bright Chariot Honours does dispence;


Each time he baths himself i'th' Liquid Main,


And being refresh'd, retires again from thence.


There are likewise several other little flying 
Cupids
 to be seen playing upon Hauboies, or blow∣ing Trumpets. On each side of these Base Reliefs there are plates of Touch-stone plain and un∣wrought, and upon the two extremities of the Tomb, are represented most part of the Arms of the Ancient Romans, upon white Marble. All this great work is enclosed with beauty a fair square of white Marble that encompasses it round, the top of which is adorn'd with the Admiral's Arms most artfully engraven upon white Mar∣ble, and enrich'd and augmented with the ho∣nours done him by 
Lewis
 the XIIIth. of 
France,
 when he had gained that famous Battle against the 
Spaniards
 near the 
Downs
 in the Year 1639.
 On each side of the Arms, there is a 
Triton,
 blowing a Sea-shell for a Trumpet, whose bodies are represented as overgrown with Moss and Sea-shells. And they are each of them accompa∣nied▪ with a Dolphin, who terminate the extremi∣ties.


Here follows the Epitaph we before men∣tioned, in Latin.

M. P.








That is to say, To Eternal Memory. You that love the Netherlanders, Vertue and True Labour, Read and Weep.


The Ornament of the 
Holland
 Nation, the thun∣derbolt of Military Valour, he that living never reposed, and taught the World by his own Example, that a Great General ought to die standing, reposes here. The love of his Countrymen, the terrour of the Enemies, and the astonishing wonder of the ocean, 
Martin Harpertez Tromp,
 in which name alone are more praises included, then so scanty a Marble is able to contain; to whom both the Eastern and Western Seas were a Subject of Triumph, and the whole world a Theater of Glory: The certain destruction of Py∣rates! the happy Assertour of Commerce; Familiar enough with his men, to be usefull to them, and to be beloved, but not to be despised by them: After he had, with a Command gentle and mild, and tempered with a Paternal tenderness, efficaciously governed his Mariners and Soldiers, otherwise a Rough and headstrong Race: After 
50
 Sea-Battles, in which he had either the Supreme, or a very considerable Command: After many famous, and almost incredible Victories: After he had received the greatest Honours which yet were below his Merits; At last, in a War against

 the 
English,
 being tho' not quite a Victor, yet so near one as to remain unconquered, he ceas'd at once to live and to vanquish, on the 
10th
 of 
August,
 in the year of our Lord, 
1653,
 New Stile, and in the 
56
 year of his Age. The States of the Ʋnited Netherlands, have as to a Hero most highly de∣serving from them,










Erected this Monument.


On the lower part of the Tomb, are written these following 
Dutch
 Verses, composed by that famous 
Holland
 Poet, 
J. V. Vondel.


Hier Rust de Zeehelt 
Tromp
 de Dappere Bes∣schermer


Der Zeevaert en der Zeeten dien van'tvrye Land,


Dat's mans gedachtnis bewaart in korstig Mar∣mer.


Zo levendig gelijk Hy stierf voor Hollandes strand;


Beluid nied moordyeschrey en Dondren van Kar∣touwen,


Daar Groot Brittanje in Brand al't water vich te kleens;


Hy hiest zich Zelv' in't hert der Burg'ren wi∣tehouven;


Dat Held verduurt de praeht van Graf en Marmersteen.


The Sense of which in English Prose is this:


Here lies the Hero of the Sea, 
Tromp
 that vali∣ant Defender of Navigation, in the Service of this Republick. 'Tis to the Momory of that Great Man, which is preserved by the power of Art, in this 
curiously wrought Marble, as fresh and lively as he was himself, when he lost his life before the Coasts of
 Holland, 
lamented by the Tears of the People,

 and by the Thundring noise of the Cannon, where∣by all Great
 Britain 
was set on fire, and the Sea became too narrow for him. He hath engraven himself in the hearts of his Countrymen by the love they bore him, and hath erected himself there such a solid Statue as will out-last this stately Tomb, and the marble it self of which it is composed.


Here is likewise another Latin Epitaph, which Professor 
Thysius
 composed at the same time, and which was designed to have been made use of, but was not, for some Reason unknown to us; However to satisfie the Curiosity of the Reader, we will insert it here.


Qui Patre viro fortissimo, ac Hemskerkana quoque ad Gades Expeditione inclyto, quique & ipse Pa∣triae vitam impendit, Genitus, ab ipsa statim Ado∣lescentia per discrimina multa ac maria, varie tractus & exercitus, captusque aliquando & ob maritimarum rerum singularem scientiam ipsis etiam hostibus aestimatus; sed inter & minas autem pro∣missa horum ingentia, fidus semper Patriae, ac con∣stans, Libertati ac Patriae redditus, huic juvandae totum se dedit, & tandem ad praefecturam Maris admotus, quam septendecim fere annorum non tam spacio, quam admirandis successibus nobilem fecit, post Duinkerkanorum vim saepius, imprimis ad Mar∣dicum, fractam, post Hispanorum magni Terro∣ris Classem repressam, post tandem in Cantii litore dissipatam, gestaque alia, vi hostium ac manu ple∣rumque minor, sed virtute, animo, ac usu, semper major, interritus, invictus, tandem maritimo cum Anglis Bello, Republica praeter expectationem nuper illigata, dum neque hostibus parcit, neque sibi, Publici egregii bono devotus glande plumbea per∣cussus victor occubuit, & insignem Hostibus Cladem ac Terrorem, majorem 
urbato mari Se
uritatem, Patriae Ingens desiderium sui sibi Gloriam nomi∣nis Immortalem, se Rei Nilitiaeque Navalis Peri∣tiae,

 Fidei pro Republica, Prudentiae, Fortitudinis, Magnanimitatis, ac Constantiae Nobilissimum, ex∣primendumque posteris exemplum reliquit. Hoc Monumentum ingentium meritorum ergo, Foedera∣torum Belgarum Ordines posuere.


Which in English is Thus,


Here lies he, who being descended from a Fa∣ther who was a most valiant man, famous likewise in the Victorious Expedition under Admiral 
Hems∣kerk
 near the Straits of 
Gibraltar,
 and who also himself lost his life in the Service of his Country, was even from his Blooming Youth, variously en∣gaged, and exercised in many dangers and many Seas, and sometimes tho when taken Prisoner, he was for his singular knowledge in Marine Affairs, highly esteemed and courted by the Enemies themselves, yet amidst all their high threats, and mighty promi∣ses, remained always faithful and constant to his Country; and being set at liberty, and restored to his Country, entirely dedicated himself to its Service and Defence, and being at length promoted to be Lieu∣tenant Admiral at Sea, during almost 
17
 years space, in which he exercised that High Office, made it Famous and Renowned, not so much for the number of years he held it, as for a Series of most admirable Successes. And after having often broken the Forces of the 
Dunkirkers,
 but especially at 
Mar∣dyke;
 after having first represt the formidable Fleet of 
Spain,
 and afterwards intirely defeated it upon the 
Kentish
 Coast; after several other Brave Actions, wherein, tho he were most commonly in∣feriour to the Enemies in Force and Numbers, yet was ever superiour to them in Valour, Courage, and Experience, 
and always undaunted and un∣conquered:
 At last the Republick being of late unexpectedly ingaged in a Sea War with the 
Eng∣lish,
 whilst he spared neither the Enemies nor him∣self, but was wholly devoted to the publick good, the

 most Glorious Cause he could espouse, being struck with Musket-shot, he fell a Victor, leaving great Loss and Terrour to the Enemies, a greater security to the disturbed Sea, a sensible regret and sorrow for his loss, to his Countrey, to himself an immor∣tal and most glorious name, and in his person, a most Noble and Heroick Example, most worthy by all Posterity to be imitated, of incomparable skill in the art of Navigation, and military Naval con∣duct, of Loyalty to the Republick, and of Prudence, Fortitude, Magnanimity and Constancy; in acknow∣ledgement of which vast Merits, the States of the Ʋnited Netherlands have erected to him this Monument.


And indeed that valiant Man may be said to have ma
e his Fortune in Arms, without any o∣ther Support or Backers than his own personal Merit and Bravery. He was born at the 
Brill,
 in the year 1597, and was but 9 years old when he began to go to Sea, with his Father, Captain 
Harpert Martin Tromp,
 with whom he was pre∣sent at the famous Battle fought near 
Gibraltar
 under the Conduct of Admiral 
Hemskirk.
 Some time after, following his Father again in a Cruise he made towards 
Cape Verd,
 or the Coast of 
Gui∣ney,
 where being attackt by an 
English
 Privateer, his Father lost his Life in the Skirmish, and af∣ter so sensible a loss, the Ship being taken by the said Privateer, young 
Tromp
 was constrain'd to serve the Captain as his Cabbin Boy for about two years and a half, but afterwards, he found means to disengage himself. From that time for∣ward, he got some Employments. In the year 1617 he was made Quartermaster under Captain 
Mooy Lambert,
 and afterwards Pilot or Master of the same Ship. After having made a Voyage towards the Straits, in a Merchant Ship called the 
Tuch∣thuys;
 he was taken by the 
Turks,
 but by the parti∣cular favour of the Bassa of 
Algier,
 he was re∣leased.

 In the year 1622, he was made a Lieute∣nant under Captain 
Bagyn,
 and after a little while, removed into Captain 
Jonge Boes
's Ship in the same Quality. Two years after, Prince 
Mau∣rice
 made him Captain of a little Frigat which car∣ried but 40 men, so that having run through all man∣ner of Sea Employments, there was nothing done remarkable at Sea during the ensuing years, but he was present at it, giving every where sig∣nal proofs of his Great Vertue and Conduct.


In the year 1629, 
De Hein
 who had made him∣self famous by taking some 
Spanish
 Galleons la∣den with Silver, being made Lieutenant Admiral of 
Holland,
 put again to Sea in the Ship called the 
Green Dragon,
 which was a very fleet Sailer, but was soon after unfortunately killed by 
Tromp
's side. The Testimony he gave of 
Tromp
 is altogether remarkable. He had, said he, known many brave Captains, in whom he had however still found some failing or other, but in 
Tromp
 he professed he never had observed any thing but what was great and vertuous, and therefore judg'd him to possess all the happy Qualities necessary in an Admiral. The Ship that 
Heins
 was in, was, as we have said, a very good Sailer, but after he was dead, it was by favour given to another and not to 
Tromp,
 at which, he was so sensibly displeased, that out of meer indignation he quitted the Sea, and retired into the Country, where he exercised an employ∣ment that only at a distance related to Marine Affairs.


In the year 1637 Lieutenant Admiral 
Dorp
 having quitted the service, Prince 
Frederick Henry,
 upon the recommendation of the States of 
Hol∣land,
 gave the Command of the Fleet to 
Tromp,
 in quality of Lieutenant Admiral, with a provi∣sional Commission only for one year: which time being expired, the Prince granted him a Con∣tinuation of it with a more ample Commission. In the sequel, he got a great deal of Honour, and

 signalized himself in divers Battles which he fought against the 
Dunkirkers,
 the 
Spaniards,
 the 
Portu∣guese,
 and the 
English,
 so that he was lookt upon by all the Nations of 
Europe,
 to be the ablest and most valiant Sea Commander of the Age in which he lived. He was so tenderly beloved by the Seamen, that both the Captains and Mariners used to call him their Father, and 
Tromp
 out of a Reciprocal love to them, used to call them likewise, his Chil∣dren. But there was nothing so admirable in him as the Moderation, and cool and sedate Temper of blood which he shewed in the greatest heat of a fight in which he Commanded. For he appear∣ed as quiet and composed when he gave his Or∣ders, as if he had been at home in his own house under safe shelter from all dangers.


But to recontinue the thred of our Discourse, 
de Ruiter
's Ship which was quite disabled to keep the Sea any longer, was carried out of the fight by Captain 
Aldertsz,
 and arrived about the Dusk of Night, before the Meuse. The next day two Gentlemen came on board the Admiral, and delivered him a Letter from the States of 
Hol∣land
 in which their High and Mightinesses de∣manded of him an account of the success of the Battle, and of the destiny of their Fleet. 
De Ruiter
 answered the States, and in few words related to them all the Circumstances of the Battle according to the best knowledge he had of them. The day following he entered into the 
Meuse,
 where Vice-Admiral 
Evertsz
 came to him from 
Goree,
 and brought him a Letter from the States General, by which he was Ordered to remove into 
Evertsz
's Galleot, and to go along joyntly with him, in search of the Fleet. Pur∣suant to which, they sailed along by the Coast, and found Captain 
Taneman
 to the Northward of the Meuse, whose Ship being already sunk 14 Fathom deep under Water, shewed nothing but the very Tops of her M
sts.




At about 2 miles from 
Scheveling,
 they found Captain 
Swart
 at Anchor, who Commanded a Ship fraighted by the 
ast-India
 Company. 
De Ruiter
 and 
Evertsz
 then Rowed off further into the Sea, to learn what news they could of the Enemies Fleet. The 13th of the same Month, they came towards the 
Texel,
 where they found the 
Holland
 Fleet to be 84 sail strong of Men of War, besides 12 more that were in the 
Meuse,
 at 
Goree,
 or▪ in 
Zealand,
 so that, if they gave a true account, the 
Dutch
 lost in all but 9 Ships in the whole Fight, as has been already said.


The States General of the United Provinces being willing to perswade all 
Europe,
 that it was not without some grounds, they gloried to have gained considerable advantages in that Battle, since they had thereby freed their Coasts and Harbors from the oppression of the 
English,
 who had a long time held them straightly block'd up and besieged, used all possible care to make their interrupted Commerce flourish again. For that design, they assembled a great Fleet of Merchant Ships, bound part of them to the North, and part to the Westward; besides which, there were several others bound homewards from the 
Indies,
 and from divers parts of 
Europe,
 which waited in the 
Sound,
 or in the Ports of 
Nor∣way,
 for a Convoy.


Vice-Admiral 
de Wit
 to whom the chief Com∣mand of the Fleet was then given, set sail the 10th. of 
September,
 with a Fleet of 40 sail, Composed of the Ships that had suffered the least damage in the last fight. 70 Merchant Ships from the 
Texel,
 and 100 more from the 
Ʋlie
 came out and joyned him. On the 30th of 
Sep∣tember
 he arrived with this Potent Fleet near little 
Holms,
 where he met 5 
East-India
 Ships, and a great many other Merchant Ships coming from the 
Sound
 under the Convoy of 14 
Da∣nish
 Men of War, who unmoored upon his ap∣proach,

 and joyned themselves to the Admiral's Flag. Besides these, there joyned him above 160 more, coming from 
Mardon,
 and other Havens. And over and above all those, there came to him from time to time re-inforcements of several men of War, from 
Holland,
 which Augmented his Fleet at last to the Number of 76 sail of Men of War, which together with the Merchant Men, made up a Fleet of 400 sail; who all came happily into the 
Texel
 or the 
Ʋlie
 at the begin∣ning of 
November,
 without meeting any 
English,
 tho' they were then at Sea with a Fleet of 50 sail of strong Men of War. The States having resolved to keep their Fleet out at Sea all Win∣er, the Men of War that were to compose it kept about the 
Texel,
 to take in Provisions of Victuals, when a furious Tempest arising, had like to have destroyed them. The Fleet then consist∣ed of 76 Men of War, as we have said, besides two Flutes laden with Ammunition and Provisi∣on. Assoon as the Wind began to freshen, they set sail towards the Main Sea, and came to an Anchor within 2 miles and a half to the East∣ward of 
Kykduin.
 The Wind freshning again on the 9th. of 
November,
 before day, blew af∣terwards so fiercely and with so much violence, from the West-North-West, turning sometimes full to the North-West, that several Ships were driven upon their Anchors, and others having cut down their Main masts run into the 
Texel,
 without considering the great danger they there∣by exposed themselves to. The night following the blustering Weather still continued, and the next day grew so furious, mixt with a fierce storm of hail, that Vice-Admiral 
de Wit
 and 10 other Ships of the Fleet were thereby driven from their Moorings, several perish'd, and others were stranded upon the Coasts.




On the third day the Tempest abated a lit∣tle, when of so potent a Fleet there remained but 47 Ships, 23 of which had had all their Masts and Rigging blown away close by the board. But such a disaster as that had been in some measure more supportable if it had not been unhappily follow'd by the sad news of the loss of 12 or 13 men of War that had likewise perish't together with a Fleet laden with Am∣munition, and several Merchant Ships, and a great many people with them. There were some Ships all whose men were drown'd without so much as one Person escaping: And they which were left were so endamaged, that when the Weather grew calm, they were forced to return into their Harbours to repair and resit themselves. Nei∣ther did the 
English
 Fleet come off at a much Cheaper rate, for after being very roughly used by the Tempest, the Parliament thinking them uncapable to keep the Sea any longer, ordered them to put into their Ports to be disarm∣ed.


About that time there was spread abroad in 
Holland
 a Lamentable report of the deplo∣rable condition into which the 
Dutch
 prisoners in 
England
 were reduced, and the cruel treat∣ment reported to be used to them there, which exci∣ted a most raging and furious resentment in all peo∣ple at such supposed barbarity. Their Number was about 900, who were said to be most of them shut up in the then old decayed, unfinish't and uncovered College of 
Chelsey,
 between four bare walls, in the wide fields, exposed to the open skie, and to all the rigours of the season, laid only upon straw without any thing to cover them: so that many of them not able to en∣dure that misery died. Nay, and 'twas affirmed further, that the hard-heartedness of the 
English
 proceeded so far against those poor wretches, as to forbid those of the 
Dutch
 Nation that lived

 at 
London,
 to assist them as they had before done 'till towards the end of the Month of 
August,
 ha∣ving expended from the beginning to that time above 500 
l.
 Sterlin in relieving them, so that coming afterwards to want that charitable assistance, many of them languish'd to death. Some of them looking upon the peril of an ine∣vitable death as the lesser evil of the two, pre∣ferred it before so many sufferings, and endea∣voured to make their escapes, tho' with the evi∣dent hazard of breaking their necks, by clam∣bering over the Walls, but when any of them were perceived so attempting, the Soldiers would not fail most mercilesly to shoot them, or else to run them through with their swords. But it must be considered indeed that this was the cruel∣ty of a then lawless people, and no worse than what they had used to their own Countrymen, and their own natural Prince, and his most faithful servants, and so is the less to be wondred at, and not imputable to that nation in more regular times. However notwithstanding all those cruel∣ties, some stole away from the vigilance of their guards, in spite of all the exactness they could use, and amongst the rest, Captain 
Schellinger
 who was one of those unhappy captives, found means to escape and to get into 
Holland,
 where he made a dismal Relation of all those inhumani∣ties. But soon after, the Prisoners on both sides were exchanged.


During the last expedition that the Vice-Admirals 
de Wit
 and 
de Ruiter
 had newly made together, the States of 
Holland
 had been deliberating up∣on the choice of a fit person worthily to supply the place of Lieutenant Admiral, vacant by the death of the Incomparable 
Tromp:
 And their opinions were so divided thereupon, that they knew not well what to determine in the matter. Vice-Admiral 
de Wit,
 they knew well enough to be a man that had given signal proofs of

 his Courage, and to be one of them that ha
 some pretension to aspire to so great an Em∣ployment, but when they considered his odd humour, and that by a certain rude and Impe∣rious way he had of Commanding, he had rais'd no small aversion to him in the Minds of most of the Captains and Seamen, the States were fearfull to repose so great a trust entirely in him. On the other side, they were sensible enough, they could not make choice of another which was no more than his equal, and much less of one that was inferiour to him, without giving him an Extraordinary cause of Jealousie, and in∣deed without doing him a manifest injustice; and yet, that if they should not admit him to that Employment, it was to be feared, that the dissention that would undoubtedly arise upon that occasion amongst the General Officers of the Fleet, might draw after it most pernicious and disas∣trous consequences, whenever they happened to come to an Engagement. At last therefore af∣ter having judiciously weighed an affair of such high Importance, they thought fit to make choice of a Person as Recomendable for his Merit, as his Birth and noble Extraction, who was descen∣ded from the ancient and illustrious house of 
Wassenaer,
 whose Valour and great Capacity in Marine affairs was known to all the World; And that was Mr. 
Opdam,
 Collonel of a Re∣giment of Horse, and Governour of 
Heus∣den,
 whose Father likewise formerly exercis∣ed the same Employment. Besides Mr. 
Op∣dam,
 they proposed likewise 
Lewis
 of 
Nassau,
 natural Son to Prince 
Maurice;
 but both their inclinations having been preconsulted in the case, they both declined it with an obliging excuse. How∣ever, Pensionary 
de Wit,
 and some other Mem∣bers of the State, to whom their High and Mightinesses had left the care of that affair, ma∣naged it so well, that on the 22d. of 
Septem∣ber,


 Mr. 
Opdam
 was elected Lieutenant Admi∣ral, under certain conditions.


The States of 
Holland
 being likewise convinced that the providing of a sufficient Number of a∣ble General Sea Commanders was a thing that contributed very much to the gaining of a Na∣val Victory,
 and that the United Provinces might reap very great advantages thereby, decreed, a∣bout the Month of 
November,
 that in every Col∣lege of Admiralty of their province; there should be establisht a Vice Admiral, and a Rear-Admiral according to the Laudable Custom pra∣ctised in the College of the 
Meuse. De Ruiter
 was not forgot in this Rencounter; for the very same day when that great man expected to have perish't by the terrible Tempest he suf∣fered near the 
Texel,
 he was constituted Vice-Admiral of 
Holland
 in the College of the Ad∣miralty of 
Amsterdam.
 Rear Admiral 
Florisz
 was advanced to the Dignity of Lieutenant Ad∣miral of the North; Captain 
Verbaaf
 was e∣lected Rear Admiral of the Admiralty of 
Rot∣terdam;
 
Cornelius Tromp
 Eldest Son of the late Lieutenant Admiral of that name, was al∣so created Rear Admiral of the Admiralty of 
Amsterdam,
 and 
Cornelius de Boet
 was made Rear Admiral of the Admiralty of the 
North.


The States were willing by this promotion, not only to shew young 
Tromp
 some token of their acknowledgement for the great services done by his renowned Father, to his Country, but likewise in part, to recompence his own Perso∣nal deserts, he having upon several occasions given them very signal marks of his Extraordinary Courage, and especially in the fight at 
Legorn,
 under the Command of Admiral 
de Galen.
 As for Vice-Admiral 
de Wit,
 he was placed in the Admiralty of 
Rotterdam,
 that he might hold the principal Rank between the two other Vice-Admirals.




About the end of this year there happened a Great Revolution in 
England.
 For 
Cromwel
 by his subtile contrivances,
 and secret practices, made himself the sovereign Arbiter of all the Affairs of the Government, under the title of Protect∣or of the three Kingdoms; so that seeing himself thereby possess'd of more force and power than any one of the Kings that had Reigned before him, his next thoughts were wholly taken up with seeking out and employing the most pro∣per means to secure his new dignity, and to main∣tain himself in that supreme and boundless Au∣thority he so boldly had assumed, to which, Judg∣ing the Friendship and Good Correspondence of the United Provinces to be absolutely necessary, he began underhand to Court them to a Peace: To which the States of 
Holland
 were so much the more inclined, because they were in some consternation at their late losses, and knew well e∣nough that 
England
 at that time was in a con∣dition to come again upon them with greater force than ever, and perhaps totally to crush their Sea power, and give a mortal stroke to their already agonizing Commerce, before they could furnish themselves with a sufficient recruit of strong and defensive Ships, (which must be a work of time, and of peace,) to oppose such a rough Ene∣my with whom nothing was to be got but a fruit∣less and heavy loss both of Blood and Treasure, the Prodigious expences of that War together with the daily and vast losses sustained by their Rich Merchants, being a burden too insupportable for them to bear much longer. And besides, the Domestick troubles in their Provinces in∣creased day by day so much upon them, upon that occasion, that they thought nothing but a good Peace with 
England
 would be able to ap∣pease them, by restoring Tranquility and their u∣sual Freedom of trade to their people.




Besides that, another powerfull reason prevail∣ed much with them at that time to influence them to a Peace, which was to prevent those growing Factions that aimed at the Election of a Captain General, or a stadtholder, which they were afraid would have forced them against their wills, to be Honest, Just and Gratefull to the Illustrious and August House of 
Orange,
 which they had no Mind to be at that time, nor per∣haps never would if the Terror of the 
French
 Arms afterwards, and the imminent destruction of the State, had not unanimously inspirited the peo∣ple to put more Generous and publick minded patriots at the Helm, who restored this almost over∣turned State to its pristine stability and pro∣sperity, by restoring to them the necessary as∣sistances and services of that most Noble and Ancient house, which were always the very vi∣tals of this Republick, and by rendering to the princely Heir of it, those Honours, Dignities and Emoluments, which merits never to be cancelled or superannuated, had made as inseparably neces∣sary for the Common good, as indispnesibly due to him. Having then, as we have already said renewed the Negotiation for that purpose, the year before, upon these weighty considerations, they now pressed it on with so much earnest∣ness, that after many obstracles,
 the Treaty was concluded and signed at 
Westminster,
 
th. of 
April:
 The Articles of which we shall not here repeat, because they are to be f
and in several other Books.








THE LIFE OF 
Cornelius Tromp,
 Lieutenant Admiral of 
Holland
 and of 
West-Friesland.
 The Second BOOK.


 
 WHILST the two formidable powers of 
England
 and 
Hol∣land
 were thus in vain con∣suming all their Forces by such a cruel War as that of which we have above re∣lated the principal Events, the 
Corsairs
 of 
Bar∣bary,
 being secured by these troubles from any power able to Curb their Excursions, ranged a∣bout without controul, and made all 
Europe
 feel the smart of their outragious Pyracies, so that the Commerce of the Christians to the 
Levant
 was so miserably interrupted, that there was nothing to be heard of in those parts, but the continual losses of the Merchants trafficking that way. Nay, and the Insolence of those 
Bar∣barians
 was advanced to that height, that not

 contenting themselves to Pyrate upon the Me∣diterranean, they impudently ventured to appear upon the Ocean, and make Excursions as far as the Coasts of 
Portugal;
 And shew'd themselves near the Cape St. 
Vincent,
 with Fleets some times of above 20 sail of Men of War well mounted and appointed for service, and keep∣ing the Mouth of the 
Streights
 shut up, they snapt up all the Merchant Ships that came thi∣ther from the four corners of the World, who by that means fell as 'twere into those Rovers Mouths.


For the redressing of all these mischiefs, after the Peace was concluding with 
England,
 the Ad∣miralty of 
Amsterdam
 sent 
de Ruiter
 into the Mediterranean with 5 men of War, partly to Convoy outward some Merchant Ships, and part∣ly to Conduct others homewards at his return. He therefore set out from the 
Texel,
 the 17th of 
June,
 with 14 Merchant Ships, accompanied by the Captains, 
Brakel, Verburg, Ooms,
 and 
Pietersz.
 In his way, he joyned Rear-Admiral 
Tromp
 with the Captains, 
Vander Hulst, Verveen, Huiskin
's and 6 Merchant Ships, that sail'd out of the 
Tex∣el,
 two days before him; And proceeding from thence together as far as 
Ayamonte,
 they took leave, and parted one from the other.


De Ruiter
 past the 
Streights
 steering his course towards 
Legorn,
 where he staid, upon the instant solicitation of the 
Dutch
 Merchants there, about the space of a Month, to wait the coming in of some more of them. During his stay there, the Captains 
Verburg
 and 
Ooms,
 saild away for 
Ve∣nice,
 to convoy from thence 5 Merchant Men. 
De Ruiter
 having unmoored from 
Legorn,
 set sail towards the Island of 
Minorca,
 and from thence proceeded to 
Alicant, Cartagena,
 and 
Malaga,
 where he was informed, that there were arrived at 
Cales,
 2 
Zealand
 men of War Com∣manded by the Captains 
Mangelaar
 and 
Wa∣ter

 Drinker,
 who were ready to return for 
Zealand
 assoon as some Merchant Ships of that Province should have taken in their freight. Upon which advice, he left the rest of his Squadron at 
Mala∣ga,
 to convoy thence the Wine Fleet, and setting Sail the 29th. of 
September,
 he arrived in the be∣ginning of 
October
 in the bay of 
Cadiz,
 and Anchored there.


At his arrival, the 
Dutch
 Consul, and chief Merchants of his Nation came on board him, and with a sensible displeasure delivered him some Letters from 
Sally,
 which related with how much inhumanity the 
Sid
 treated the 
Hollanders,
 upon the taking of a Flute from them near 
Mamora
 called the 
Hound,
 by Rear Admiral 
Tromp,
 and the 
Sid
 highly incensed thereat, having by way of reprisal, seized 3 Merchant Ships of 
Amster∣dam
 full freighted, had imprisoned all the Ma∣sters and men in the said Ships, and threatned to make them slaves, unless the Flute and her Cargo were speedily restored. In the same Let∣ters it was intimated, that the Prisoners passi∣onately desired, that 
de Ruiter
 would come to 
Sally,
 in hopes they should obtain their Li∣berty by the influence of his great Experience, and the acquaintance he had formerly made with the 
Sid. De Ruiter
 accordingly being wil∣ling to prevent those growing troubles, and the mischievous consequences they might draw after them, set sail the 6th. of 
October,
 accompanied with the Captains, 
Mangelaar
 and 
Water Drink∣er,
 and arrived in 
Sally
 road the 10th. of the same Month. The next day he received a Let∣ter from the 
Dutch
 Consul, informing him, how that the 
Sid,
 extremely provoked at the Hosti∣lity committed by Rear Admiral 
Tromp,
 had sent for him into his Palace, and had demanded of him an indemnification for the Ship and her Car∣go that was taken, telling him that as Consul of the 
Dutch
 Nation, he was respo
sible for the

 damages done by the 
Dutch
 men of War, Ad∣ding, that after he had answered all those com∣plaints as well as he could, he had promised the Prince of 
Sally,
 to write to 
Tromp
 to come himself in person to that road, to justifie himself and to pray him in the mean while not to suf∣fer the Cargo of the said Ship to be meddled with; that having accordingly written such a Letter, 
Tromp
 thereupon came to 
Sally
 road ac∣companied with Captain 
Huiskens,
 from whence he had notified to the 
Sid
 by a Letter,


THat the Ship he had seized,
 having refused to send a Boat on Board him, tho' he had put out a White Flag; that upon that refusal he was confirmed in the Opinion he had, that she was an 
Algerine,
 he had taken her with so much the more reason, because all her men deserted her, and run away to shore after they had taken with them all that was most valuable on board her; And that if the Prince of 
Sally,
 thought himself offended by that proceeding, he might Complain to the States General, who were accustomed to do Justice to e∣very one, concluding his Letter with this prote∣station, that he had no Commission to do the least wrong to any of the Subjects of 
Sally.


That after the reading of that Letter, the 
Sid
 answered, he could give no credit to it, for that he could not believe, that Rear-Admi∣ral 
Tromp
 would have dared to venture upon any such attempt upon those of 
Sally,
 without Express Orders from the States so to do; Ad∣ding, that on the other side, if it were true that he had acted as he had done without the Con∣sent or Privity of his Masters, he had no oc∣casion to wait their Orders for the Restitution of the Prize in Question to its right owners. 
De Ʋries
 likewise informed 
de Ruiter
 withall,

 that the Prince of 
Sally
's answer could not be carried on board of 
Tromp,
 because the Sea was then so very rough, that no Boat durst stir out of the Port, so that 
Tromp
 not being able to stay any longer there, hoisted sail, and went away for 
Cales.
 He reported likewise that the 
Sid
 two or three days before his departure, had caused the Master of the Ship called the 
Tyger
 to be seized and imprisoned with all his Men, after he had given leave to two other Ships of 
Amsterdam,
 to unmoor.


Vice Admiral 
de Ruiter
 sent likewise the same day a Letter to the Prince of 
Sally,
 which was to this effect: 
That upon his arrival at
 Cadiz, 
he had with much displeasure heard of the diffe∣rence caused by the taking of the Flute, called the
 Hound: 
and how that in Consequence of it, The Master of the Ship,
 Walishsz 
with all his Men had been seized; which News had obliged him with all diligence to come before
 Sally, 
to assure his Highness, that their High and Mightinesses, the States General had no other design than to pre∣serve and maintain the Treaty of Peace conclu∣ded with
 Sally; 
And if there had hapned any thing prejudicial to it, by the seizure of a Vessel through mistake the States having nothing so much to heart as Peace would be sensibly concerned at it: That for his own particular he was extreme∣ly sorry, that the Orders of the States his Ma∣sters would not permit him to leave his Ship, and go ashore to kiss his Highnesses hands, and wish him a long and happy Reign; as undoubted∣ly promising himself withall, that if he could but have the advantage to tell him his reasons by word of Mouth, that he would be fully satisfied with them, and would thereby be induced glad∣ly to renew the Friendship that had so long con∣tinued between the Ʋnited Provinces and the people of
 Sally; 
and in fine, since necessity engaged him to stay on board his Ship,

 He prayed the
 Sid, 
to be pleased to give leave to the Consul
 de Uries, 
and to
 Walishsz, 
the Mr. of the Ship that was seized, to come to him to in∣form him more amply of all things, that so he might be able to write of them more at large to his Highness.


The Reading of this Letter that was tran∣slated into 
Spanish,
 so extraordinarily satisfied the Prince of 
Sally,
 that he immediately consent∣ed, that the Consul should go on board the Ad∣miral. He likewise at the same time ordered 30 Sheep, 14 Bullocks, and some other Refresh∣ments to be got ready, to be presented to Vice Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 by two Deputies; and some days after, sent him a Letter, expressing,
 
That he had secured himself by way of Provision, of the Ship
 Tyger, 
till the Vessel taken by Rear Admi∣ral
 Tromp 
should be restored; But that however, he gave full liberty to all other
 Dutch 
Ships, to go out of and come into his Ports, for that he was resolved to continue to entertain a perfect good Correspondence with the Ʋnited Provinces,
 &c.


Affairs were there upon that foot, when 
De Ruiter
 was forced by a sudden Tempest, to weigh Anchor, and sail away from 
Cadiz,
 from whence he returned back into 
Holland
 with a Merchant Fleet that had put themselves under his Convoy, and arrived at the 
Texel
 about the end of the Month.


The States General of the United Provinces being desirous to free the Sea for the Yoke of the Corsairs of 
Barbary,
 
 and at the same time to prevent the troubles that were like to arise at 
Sally,
 gave order to 
de Ruiter,
 to pass again into the Mediterranean, with a Squadron of 8 men of War, and 2 Advice Yachts. His Commissi∣on which was signed the 29th. of 
June,
 Imported, that he and the other Captains of his Squadron, where or whensoever they should happen to

 meet any of the Corsairs of 
Barbary,
 and espe∣cially them of 
Tetuan, Algiers, Tunis,
 or 
Tripoli,
 on this side the Kingdom of 
Candy,
 giving chace to any Ships belonging to the States Sub∣jects, they should attack them, and sink or burn them, if possible; That all Voluntary 
Renegado
's found on board any of the Corsairs should be punish'd with death; But the others that turn∣ed so from their youth, or were forced to be∣come so by necessity, especially if they had ren∣dered any services or good Offices to the Chri∣stian slaves, and seemed to Compassionate their misfortune, should be spared, and distributed into the States Ships; that the 
Turks
 and 
Moors
 should be publickly sold, and the Money ari∣sing by their sale, should be laid up: That the Christian slaves should be set at liberty, and put ashore, if they desired it, or else entertained in the Ships, and entered into pay according to their respective Capacities: That he should likewise go again and Anchor before 
Sally,
 in order to enter into a Negotiation for renewing the Treaty of Alliance and Amity concluded in 1651, between the States General of the United Provinces, and those of 
Sally.


Accordingly, on the 18th of 
July
 Vice-Ad∣miral 
de Ruiter,
 sailed out of the 
Texel
 with 8 Men of War, and 55 Merchant Ships bound for 
France, Portugal, Spain,
 and other places in the Mediterranean; and on the 3d. of 
August,
 he arri∣ved in the bay of 
Cadiz,
 with a Fleet of 44 sail; on the 7th. he past the 
Streights,
 steering his Course towards 
Malaga, Cartagena
 and 
A∣licant,
 into which places, some of the Merchant Ships entered. The rest of them quitted 
de Ruit∣er
 near the Isle of 
Formentera,
 which they had chosen for their place of Rendezvous, in case they should come to be separated by any accident. 
De Ruiter
 departed thence with design to go before 
Algiers,
 sending the Captains, 
de Wilde,

 Sweers,
 and 
Zaalingen,
 before him, to see what Ships they could discover riding before that Town, so famous for its Pyracies.


On the 30th. he began to come in sight of it, and coming up with the Captains he had sent before, they reported to him, that they had been so near the Town, that they had seen people walking on the Cawsey, and discerned 5 Ships in the road, and 6 or 7 within the Mole. The same night 
de Ruiter
 advanced with his Squa∣dron, within Cannon shot of the Town, and Anchored in 42 Fathoms depth of Water. The 2 Yachts, the 
Pearl,
 and 
Fortune
 were already prepared for an Enterprize; and the better to deceive the Corsairs, 
de Ruiter
 Commanded all his Captains, to put up 
English
 Colours. Up∣on which, those 
Barbarians
 shew'd themselves upon some small vessels near the shore, but durst not come very near the 
Hollanders.
 Then the 
Dutch
 Captains being all summoned on board the Admiral, a Council of War was held; wherein it was resolved, that in the night by fa∣vour of the Land Breezes, they should make sail, to Conduct, if it were possible, their Fire-Ships back by 3 men of War, up to the Brigantines to burn them, but so great a Calm lasted all the night, that it was hard to know on which side the Wind was. The next Morning it con∣tinued still Calm, and the 
Dutch
 perceived that the 5 Brigantines that were in the Road the day before, were then retired within the Mole, so that it was not difficult to Judge by the Counte∣nance of the 
Turks,
 that they were upon their guard.




 
 Whereupon another Council of War, being called, it was resolved, that since by reason of the Calm, it was impossible to undertake any thing upon the Enemy, they should weigh An∣chor, and make the best of their way towards 
Malaga;
 which accordingly was put in Execu∣tion about noon. As the 
Dutch
 drew near that place, they discovered some Corsair Ships, to which they gave chace; and on the 17th. of 
September,
 they took a 
Tetuan
 Brigantine man∣ned with 20 
Moors,
 whose Captain was a 
Spa∣nish
 Renegado named 
Arnando Dias,
 who had done a great deal of mischief to the Christians, and had caused very great losses to them, having in about 12 years time, made near 2000 slaves whom he had all cruelly sold, and amongst them, as 'twas credibly related, some of his own near kindred; and bragged several times, that he would treat his own Father after the same manner, if he fell into his hands; And therefore according to his Execrable merits, he was immediately hang∣ed up upon a Top-mast.


On the 9th. of the same Month, 
de Ruiter
 continued on his Course, and arrived two days after, in the bay of 
Gibraltar;
 the day follow∣ing, weighing Anchor, he repast the 
Streights,
 and steered his Course towards 
Cadiz,
 with de∣sign to make for the Coast of 
Barbary.
 On the 27th. he discovered 2 Corsair Ships at the mouth of the 
Streights
 to the Eastward, and another to the South-West-ward. 
De Ruiter
 gave chace to this last, as appearing to be the biggest of them. The Corsair made away as fast as she could, directly towards 
Arzila,
 a little Town in the Kingdom of 
Fez
 about 12 Leagues from 
Tangier.
 And it proved to be the Admiral's Ship of 
Algier,
 that was taken from the 
Hollanders
 but the year before, and by the 
Dutch
 was called 
the Wheel of Fortune,
 but by the 
Turks,
 named 
the Golden Palm-tree.
 That Ship was full as

 big as 
de Ruiter
's own Admiral Ship, and car∣ried 38 Guns, and 250 men, amongst whom were 50 Christian slaves that were forced to serve on board her.


De Ruiter
 chased her as far as into the very Haven of 
Arzila,
 where with much ado she made a shift to save her self, after having lost many of her men in the fight, and principally her Cap∣tain who lost his life in the Skirmish. The 
Dutch
 Fleet continuing on their Course, came and Anchored in the road of 
Sally,
 on the 1st. of 
October,
 after they had taken one 
Turkish
 Ship and a 
Tartan,
 and stranded a Renegado Corsair. 
De Ruiter,
 at his arrival saluted the Town with 9 Guns, the great Castle answer∣ing him with 5, and the little one with 4, after which, according to his Commission, he endea∣voured to enter into a Negotiation with the Deputies of 
Sall,
 in order to appease the dif∣ferences they had with the United Provinces; but he being delayed several days without being able to do any thing, and in the mean while receiving advice, that the most part of the 
Tur∣kish
 Pyrates kept the passage of the 
Streights
 shut up, and returned daily from thence to 
Al∣giers
 with Prizes, he thought it was not neces∣sary for him to stay in 
Sally
 road with all his whole Squadron; but calling thereupon a Con∣sultation of his Captains on board him, it was resolved, that 
de Wilde,
 and Rear Admiral 
Ver∣veen,
 and Captain 
Zaalingen,
 should sail away towards the Streights, to give chase to the Corsairs. And accordingly they unmoor'd with the New Moon, steering towards 
Cadiz,
 whilst on the o∣ther side, Captain 
Vander Zaan
 kept out a cruizing with two Men of War more. 
De Ruiter
 in the mean while staid with two of the ships of his Squadron, before 
Sally▪
 to pursue the Negotiation of the Treaty. In the midst of which Transactions, on the 16 of 
October
 he

 discovered between 
Sally
 and 
Mamora
 3 Sail making towards 
Sally,
 but were kept back by the Calm Weather; Upon which, 
de Ruiter
 weighing Anchor, accompanied by Captain 
A∣delaer,
 advanced with design to cut off their passage, the Corsairs having perceived them, made back as fast as they could, to the main Sea again, the Wind being then North-North-East, 
de Ruiter
 used all possible endea∣vours to get up with them, but night coming on, he lost sight of them; However, some hours after having discovered them again, he boarded one of them about 3 in the Morn∣ing, by the assistance of Oars, notwithstanding the Calmness of the Weather. At his very first firing, the 
Turks
 got into their Boat, and fled away, leaving no body on Board but two Por∣tugueses that were in the Ship. She was a ve∣ry good Sailer of about 90 Tuns, that was ta∣ken by the 
Turks
 near the Isle of 
Madera.
 The 2 others were Corsairs of 
Algiers,
 where∣of one carried 26, and the other 16 Guns, who made their escape by favour of a fresh gale of Wind that soon carried them out of Reach. The next day towards Evening, 
de Ruiter
 re∣turned into 
Sally
 road again. In the mean while, the Negotiation for a Treaty having been brought upon a good foot by the Deputies on each side, the 
Turks
 stood firm to their Pretentions, which were, that they should receive an indemnification for their Ship that was taken, till at last, af∣ter several Conferences, the Treaty of Peace was concluded, and renewed on the 22d. of 
October
 upon the following Articles,
 
viz.


1. 
That His Highness,
 Sid Abdala, Ben Sid Mahumad Ben Bukar, 
Prince of
 Fez, 
Lord of South and North
 Sally, 
should without delay re∣store to his former Liberty, Consul
 David de Uries 
who was arrested for some mis-understanding that hapned to fall out.




2. 
That his said Highness should immediately give orders for the Releasing of the Ship called the
 Tyger, 
and the Galliot
 de Ruiter, 
seized at
 Sally, 
and likewise their Cargoe, as much as was yet remaining of them, or the Equivalent of the profit arising from them, as likewise for the set∣ting at liberty all the Pilots and Mariners be∣longing to them.


3. 
That two men taken in a small
 Dutch 
Ship, called the Arms of Hinlopen, and sold at
 Sally, 
should be presently freed out of slavery, and set at liberty.


4. 
That the States General of the Ʋnited Pro∣vinces on their part should cause to be restored to his Highness, that which had been seized, which should be still in nature, or the profits which a∣rose from the Ship, called the
 Hound, 
taken near
 Mamora, 
by Rear Admiral
 Tromp 
the year be∣fore, upon the refusal the said Ship had made, to render the usual salute, and shew her Passports.


5. 
That their High and Mightinesses, to In∣demnify his Highness for the loss of the above∣said Ship, should remit to him the full enjoyment of the Flute, called the
 White Falcon, 
taken at Sea by those of
 Sally, 
and seized and detained to that present day.


6. 
That the losses and damages caused to the Subjects of both parties by the differences lately arisen between them, shall be rendred Common, and forgotten on both sides.


7. 
That under this Common annulling of the losses and damages on both sides, should not be compre∣hended the lawfull right of Pilot
 Warebout, 
con∣cerning the Confiscation of his Ship and her la∣ding, which the Administrators of
 Sally, 
had en∣gaged to pay according to the account that had been delivered in of them, which should subsist till it were fully paid.




This Treaty was signed for the States Gene∣ral, by Consul 
de Ʋries,
 and 
Gilbert de Ʋyant, Fiscal,
 or Treasurer of the Fleet, and lower, by Vice-Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 and sealed with his seal. On the Prince of 
Sally
's side, it was signed by 
Ibrahim Duque,
 and 
Aly Cordevees.


After this business thus dispatcht, they proceed∣ed to treat about the choice of a signal by which the two parties might know one another Reci∣procally when they met at Sea. After which several Articles were drawn up in writing, in or∣der to render the Ancient Treaty of Peace the more firm and inviolable▪ but because 'twas im∣possible for 
de Ruiter
 to make any longer stay before 
Sally,
 as being obliged to return back again to the 
Streights,
 that project could not then be finish'd only he promised, next year to come again to 
Sally,
 to pursue the Execution of it and to put it to a finishing stroke. 
De Ruiter
 then hav∣ing appeased all things and secured the Peace on that side, unmoored from 
Sally
 the 2d of 
No∣vember,
 and sailed towards the 
Streights,
 and on the 10th. of the same Month came to an An∣chor in the road of 
Cadiz.
 Two days before the Captains 
Vander Zaan, Bosch,
 and 
de Wilde,
 had given chace to 3 
Turkish
 Corsairs, one of which being pursued by 
Bosch
 was stranded on the Coast to the Southward of 
Larache,
 a small Town in the Kingdom of 
Fez
 about 6 miles from 
Arzila,
 from whence being got off, she was taken. She proved a Flute of 
Lubeck
 call'd, the Fortune, taken before by the 
Algerines. De Wilde
 chased another which was a Frigat of 
A
g
ers,
 carrying 30 Guns, and 250 men, which likewise run a ground to the Southward of 
La∣rache,
 the 
Moors
 having quitted her, and fled away there were found on board her 25 Chri∣s
ian slaves who were freed thereby from the y
ke of those 
Barbarians,
 and 7 Renegado's whose lives were spared, because tho' it was

 in their power to have saved themselves with the 
Moors,
 they refused to do it. But it being impossible to get the Frigat off from the Coast which she was run upon, she was burnt. The third of these Corsairs being more fortunate than the rest, saved her self by her swift sail∣ing.


About the 15th. of 
November, de Wilde
 and 
Zaalingen
 attackt an 
Algerine
 Frigat, called the Shepherdess Commanded by a Christian Rene∣gado of 
Amsterdam,
 named 
Leendertsz,
 who de∣fended himself vigorously had above 120 
Moors
 killed on board him, which so discouraged the others, that they begun to think of yielding; but about 30 Christian Renegado's would not hear of laying down their Arms, till the 
Hol∣landers
 had promised them by Oath, to grant them their lives. Nay some of those wretches were so desperately bent, that they were alrea∣dy gone down to clap fire into the Powder room to blow up themselves together with the 
Hollanders
 that were entred upon the Deck, had they not been perswaded from that dismal enterprize by fair words. There were found likewise in this Corsair 32 Christian slaves, whereof 17 were 
Dutch
 Men; 124 
Moors
 or 
Turks
 were sold to the 
Spaniards,
 28 Chri∣stian Renegado's were condemned to the King of 
Spain
's Gallies, for Term of life; but the Captain 
Leendertsz
 was saved by the favour and at the request of the Christian slaves, because of the Gentleness and humanity he had used to∣wards them, as likewise were two other Rene∣gado's, one whereof was 
Mounikendam,
 and the other, a 
Polander.


On the 20th of 
November,
 the Captains 
Van∣der Zaan, Bosch,
 and 
Adelaer,
 gave chace again to a Brigantine, and a great 
Turkish
 Corsair, called, the Golden Eagle, the last of which was chased upon the Coast near 
Arzila,
 where she

 was believed to have been stranded, but having had nothing but the handle of her Rudder bro∣ken, she slink'd away from the danger, and got out into the main Sea again. Vice-Admiral 
de Ruit∣er
 having divided his Squadron into 3 parts, set sail towards the 
Streights
 Mouth, followed by 
de Wilde, de Zaalingen,
 and 
Adelaer,
 with design to cruize there against the Corsairs; he gave Orders at the same time, to Rear-Admi∣ral 
Verveen,
 and Cuptain 
Vander Zaan,
 to con∣voy to the Northward of 
Cape Verd
 3 Merchants richly laden, and bound for 
Amsterdam,
 because he had heard, that Commander 
Colart
 was cruiz∣ing off of that Cape, with 4 or 5 
French
 Pri∣vateers, and took indifferently all Ships he met with, without having any respect to their Banner. The Captains, 
Sweers
 and 
Bosch
 had orders to return to 
Sally,
 as well to reconduct thither one of the Prince of 
Sally
's Deputies, and 
de Ʋries,
 the 
Dutch
 Consul, who had been forced by the ill Weather to stay on board of 
Sweers,
 as also to take in some Letters from the Consul for the States. 
De Ruiter
 having chosen the Mouth of the 
Streights
 to be the Rendezvous of all the Ships of his Squadron, sailed on the 29th. of the same Month, towards 
Arzila,
 and having a far off descried two Ships at Anchor, resolved to make up to them, upon the report made to him by Captain 
Leendertsz
 late of the Corsair called the 
Shepherdess,
 That they were the 
Golden Eagle,
 carrying 26 Guns, and 250 Men to which before he had given chace, and the St. 
Catharine
 carrying 20 Guns, and 200 Men all 
Turks.
 Those Pyrates had Anchored very near the Town. 
De Ruiter
 charged them vigorously with his Artillery, and the Infidels defended themselves with much obstinacy, till at last the St. 
Catharine,
 being shot through and through, and leaking on all sides, sunk to the bottom of the Sea: Then having grapled the 
Golden

 Eagle,
 he made himself Master of her, and af∣ter the fight, carried her to 
Malaga.
 Out of those 2 Corsairs, there were 20 Christians deli∣vered out of slavery, 50 
Turks
 or 
Moors
 made Prisoners, and all the rest of their Men either escaped to shore, or were killed.


Vice Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 after he had brought the Corsairs of 
Barbary
 to their duty, and freed the Sea from their Robberries, came on the 15th. of 
March,
 to Anchor in the Road of 
Ma∣laga,
 
 where he received a Letter from the Col∣lege of the Admiralty of 
Amsterdam,
 dated the 29th of 
December
 of the preceeding Year, by which they testified themselves to be very well satis∣fied at his happy Expedition into the Mediter∣ranean, and Commanded him by vertue of an Order from the States General, immediately up∣on the reading of that Letter, to get all the Ships of his Squadron together, and to return with all diligence into the Ports of the United Provin∣ces, without having regard to any other Consi∣deration, how pressing soever it were; permit∣ing him however to stop 8 or 10 days at most in 
Cadiz
 road, to wait for the 
Spanish
 Gallions, that were to come thither, and to take under his Convoy, a great Number of Merchant Ships richly laden and homewards bound for 
Holland.
 Having then set sail in Obedience to those Or∣ders, he arrived to an Anchor in 
Cadiz
 Road the 20th. of that Month, and sailed away again from thence on the 15th. of 
April.
 The 
Spa∣nish
 Gallions arriving at 
Cadiz
 2 days after him, about 22 sail of Merchant Ships joyned themselves to the Admiral's Flag. with whom happily continuing his voyage homeward, he arrived in the 
Texel
 the 2d of May, after ha∣ving met in his way, 
Withorn Comadore
 of a Squadron of 7 English Men of War who were looking sharp after the Merchant Fleet laden with Silver, which he had the charge of

 Convoying. But 
Withorn
 f
nding himself too weak to attack him, stood away of to Sea, be∣ing desperately vext that he had mist so fair a hit. 
De Ruiter
 gained in this Expedition so much the more honour, in that he took 6 great Tur∣kish Corsairs, and 2 Brigantines; sunk or burnt 3 more of their vessels, and got off and saved one of them, that was run ashore; de∣livered at the same time a considerable Num∣ber of Christian slaves from the servitude of those 
Barbarians;
 pacified the troubles that were arising with those of 
Sally,
 and at length terminated so many happy successes by Convoy∣ing home prosperously into his Country, a vast Treasure in spite of the vigilance and avidity of the 
English.


About that time, a War arose in the North between 
Charles Gustavus
 King of 
Swedeland,
 and 
John Casimir
 King of 
Poland,
 which pre∣pared new affairs for the 
Hollanders,
 and gave great Umbrage to the States General of the U∣nited Provinces, who looking upon those Trou∣bles as likely to cause a great interruption, if not a ruin to their Commerce on that side, thought fit to contribute to the preservation of 
Dant∣zick
 and of 
Prussia,
 on which 
Swedeland
 might easily at that time seize, unless they timely op∣posed it. The States therefore knew of what great Consequence it was, to keep the 
Sound
 open, to have a free passage into the Baltick Sea when they pleased, resolved, to Equip out a Fleet, a
d to give the Chief Command of it to Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
Opdam.
 But whilst that was preparing, not to lose time, they Ordered 
De Ruiter,
 and Vice Admiral 
Florisz,
 and Rear Ad∣miral 
Tromp,
 to get all the Men of War toge∣ther that were ready, and to sail away into those parts before the Grand Fleet. Most part of those Ships were Equipt at 
Amsterdam,
 and some of them in North-
Holland;
 and some

 Regular Troops were put on board them, to succour 
Dantzick,
 in case it should be besieged by the 
Swedes. De Ruiter
 then having divided his Fleet into 2 Squadrons, whereof that which bore the Admiral's Flag was under his own Con∣duct, and the other, under the Command of Vice Admiral 
Florisz,
 set sail the last day of May, and on the 8th. of the next Month, came to an Anchor near the 
Sound;
 where as soon as he was arrived, he went on shore at 
Elsenore,
 accompanied by 
Tromp
 and 
Florisz,
 and thence went on to 
Copenhagen
 to confer with their High and Mightinesses Ambassadors there, who were at that time Mr. 
Van Beuniegen,
 Pensioner of 
Amsterdam, Amerongen,
 and 
Van Viersen:
 After which, they were all three to make a visit to the Chief State Minister of the Kingdom, to the Chancellor, and to Admiral 
Lindenhout,
 and then returned again on board their Fleet; which in the mean while entred the 
Sound,
 in expecta∣tion of new Orders, and of a reinforcement with Admiral 
Opdam.
 The 13th. of the same Month, 2 fresh men of War, four on the 16th. and afterwards several more joyned the Admi∣rals Flag, and reinforced the Fleet. On the 27th. 3 Men of War more were discovered approach∣ing the 
Sound,
 which proved to be Admiral 
Op∣dam,
 Captain 
Van Nes
 and 
Kuiper,
 who joyned the Fleet the same evening. The Orders Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
Opdam
 received from the States on that occasion, Imported, 
That he should secure the Commerce of the North; That he should defend and Protect by force of Arms, the States Merchant Ships against, all that should attempt upon their liberty; impowring him besides to Free the
 Bal∣tick 
Sea from the oppression of all those that should offer to disturb its Navigation. Afterwards he received new orders to go and Anchor with all his forces in the Road before
 Dantzick, 
to pre∣vent the
 Swedish 
Fleet from blocking up the pas∣sages

 of it, and to facilitate the going in and coming out of the
 Dutch 
Merchant Ships, by taking them into his Protection; And in all other things, to regulate himself according to the Commission he had in general, to oppose all manner of attempts. Mr.
 Opdam 
going likewise presently ashore, speed∣ed away to
 Copenhagen, 
where he had a Con∣ference with the States Ambassadors, after which he had Audience of the King of
 Denmark, 
and received all imaginable honours from the Grandees of the Court.
 And his 
Danish
 Majesty being willing to give some marks of the concern he had in the laudable intentions of the States his Masters, in sending him for the Protection of 
Dantzick,
 honoured him with the Collar of the Order of the 
Elephant,
 which was carried him the 19th. of 
July,
 by the Vice-Roy of 
Norway,
 after he was returned on board his Fleet.


Vice-Admiral 
de Wit
 putting out likewise from the 
Meuse,
 with several men of War more, came and joyned the Fleet, which afterward set∣ting sail, arrived at 
Copenhagen
 on the 29th. of the said Month, and the next day, the States Ambassadors, advising them to continue on their way, they set sail again to enter into the 
Bal∣tick
 Sea, so that 6 days after, the whole Fleet came to an Anchor in 
Dantzick
 road, being 42 sail of Frigats and men of War,; 
viz.
 7 of 
Rotterdam,
 24 of 
Amsterdam,
 7 of North-
Hol∣land,
 2 of 
Zealand,
 and 2 of 
Friesland.


At the arrival of this Potent Fleet, the Ca∣stle of 
Termund,
 which is at the Mouth of the 
Vistula
 in the Gulf of 
Dantzick,
 saluted them with several Guns, and immediately after, some Emi∣nent Persons came in a Galliot from the Town on board the Admiral, to salute him, and to let him know the Joy the whole regency was in at his arrival. Mr. 
Fabricius
 Pensionary of the Town, and famous for his great learning, Com∣plimented Lieutenant Admiral 
Opdam,
 from the

 Magistrates, and invited him in their name, to be pleased to come ashore into their Town; and the publick rejoycings and other transports of joy which all the People shew'd upon that occa∣sion, lasted several days. The States had had notice given them some time before, as from the King of 
Sweden,
 that his said Majesty had form'd a design to block up the Town of 
Dantzick,
 and afterwards to besiege it, and that he prayed their High and Mightinesses to be pleased to suspend their Commerce during that time, and to for∣bid all Merchant Ships belonging to their State, to go thither to take in any fraight. But the unexpected arrival of that Fleet broke all the designs of 
Swedeland,
 and tho' it was sent out for no other end but to free the 
Baltick
 Sea from the Yoke of that power, yet it was strong enough to make all the fair hopes that Crown had conceived of Compassing so great an En∣terprize as that vanisht to into smoak, and that without any effusion of blood. On the 1st. of 
September
 following there appeared likewise at Sea, a Fleet of 9 Danish Men of War under the Conduct of Admiral 
Lindenhout,
 which came also and Anchored before 
Dantzick.
 They had the same design as had the 
Dutch
 Fleet, which was to de∣fend that Hanseatick Town and the Freedom of Navigation. In the mean time, the States De∣puties, 
Slingeland, Van Dorp, de Hubert,
 and 
Jabrandt
 being entred into a Negotiation at 
El∣bing
 with the King of 
Swedens
 Plenipotentiaries about a Treaty of Alliance, the 
Dutch
 Fleet that continued still before 
Dantzick
 Contributed much to advance it, so that it was concluded and signed on the 1st. of 
September,
 on both sides.


The States knowing the abovesaid Treaty with 
Swedeland,
 was upon the point of being con∣clu
ed, thought fit to recall Lieutentant Admi∣ral 
Opdam
 with 30 of the biggest Ships of War of the Fleet, and to leave Rear Admiral 
Tromp


 in his place, with a Squadron only of 12 o
 the lightest Ships. And the Letters that con∣tained this order were delivered him at 
Dant∣zick,
 at the beginning of 
October.


The Danish Squadron was already sailed away ever since the 25th. of 
September,
 for 
Copenhagen,
 whither the King of 
Denmark
 had recalled it, as being ill satisfied at the Treaty Concluded with 
Swedeland
 without his privity. In fine, on the 6th. of 
October,
 the most part of the Troops that were on board the Fleet, were re∣moved, and distributed into the 12 Ships that were to stay in the road; only 280 men which there was no room to place there, entred into the Town by the Magistrates leave, and towards the Evening, the Fleet sailed away. But before his departure, Lieutenant Admiral 
Opdam
 received a present from the Magistrates of a very fine Silver Ewer with a crossed handle, valued at 600 Crowns.


Not long after the departure of the Grand Fleet, Vice Admiral 
Tromp
 received likewise or∣ders from the States, to quit the 
Baltick
 Sea, and to return into 
Holland,
 with his Squadron. So that having landed 1200 Musketeers he had on boa
d his Fleet, they were placed in the Town to help to guard it, together with those that had been sent thither before. After which 
Tromp
 writ the following Letter to the States, to give them Advice of his departure in pursuance of their Commands, and of the taking of General 
Coningsmark.


SInce it has pleased their High and Mighti∣nesses, to let me know their Intention, by their Letter of the 9th of 
October
 last, by which, they order me to put the Troops embarked on the Fleet into 
Dantzick,
 to help to preserve that place,

 and afterwards to set sail with my Squadron back for 
Holland;
 in pursuance of that Order, we put out from that Road the 30th. of 
October,
 ha∣ving the day before received General 
Konings∣mark,
 who was brought in a Flute, and two days before that, another vessel; there being in both those vessels about 
200 Scotch
 Soldiers. The af∣fair passed in this manner: Tbe Soldiers that were in the first of these Ships revolted against their Officers, saying they were inrol'd for the Service of 
Dant∣zick
 and not for the King of 
Swedeland;
 they were by the ill weather forced to Anchor near 
Heel,
 where they constrained their Officers and their Pilot, to carry them to 
Dantzick.
 Being come into the 
Vistula,
 they reported, that Gene∣ral 
Koningsmark
 lay at Anchor in the same place, upon which Advice 
3
 Galliots were sent towards him, who attackt him before noon, so that he was made prisoner in sight of our Fleet. The same Evening I went with the Governor of the Town, to visit him in the Fort, 
Termund;
 and he told us, he came from 
Stetin,
 with design to go to 
Pilau.
 There was in this Rencounter, one man killed, and 
5
 wounded.


To report the misfortune of General 
Kon∣ingsmark
 with its principal Circumstances, you must know, that at his departure from 
Stetin,
 there was a ship which had on board her, 130 
Scotch
 Soldiers, that set sail at the same time with him, steering her course towards 
Pilau;
 but a Tempest, and a contrary Wind having kept them back 10 days upon the Sea, the Ship being o∣ver loaden with soldiers, fell a Leaking so very much that she could no longer keep the Sea, which obliged the soldiers to take arms against their Officers, and the Master of the ship, whom they forced at length to Land them at 
Dant∣zick,
 where they informed the Magistrates where∣abouts 
Koningsmark
 lay at Anchor. Upon that

 Report, they presently mann'd out 3 Galliots which were detacht against him on the 20th. of 
October,
 about break of day, and between 9 and 10 a Clock before noon, attackt his ship, just when General 
Koningsmark
 was busied in hear∣ing of a Sermon. The preacher perceiving the Enemies, gave notice of it to the General, who thereupon Commanded the Pilot to cut the An∣chor-Cables, and with all possible haste to make all the sail away he could: But the Pilot an∣swering him, that it was impossible to do it, he gave Orders to his men to do every man his best to defend themselves; But before they could get into a posture of defence the Enemies boarded him, 
Koningsmark
 retiring in∣to the Master's Cabbin, demanded Quarter, which was granted to him and all his Men. So that this General, as great a Commander as he was, yet for want of skill in the Art of fighting at Sea; that skirmish being perhaps the first of that kind he ever was in, was forced to yield himself at the discretion of the Victors, who carried him pri∣soner to 
Dantzick.


But to return again to the States Fleet, Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
Opdam
 entred on the 6th. of 
November
 into 
Helvoetsluys
 with a part of the men of War that composed the Fleet, and the rest of them almost at the same time got into the 
Ʋlie;
 and some weeks after, Rear-Admiral 
Tromp
 followed with his Squadron.


Whilst the States General were endeavouring with so much success to pacifie the troubles of the North, the Christian 
French
 and 
Portuguese
 Privateers, and the 
Turkish
 Pyrates domineer'd in the Mediterranean, exercising without controul all sorts of Robbery; so that the 
Hollanders
 Trading suffered extreamly from them by the continual losses of their ships: Which obliged the States to sen
 
de Ruiter
 thither before Win∣ter, with a Squadron composed of the ships Com∣manded

 by the Captains, 
Brakel, Kampen,
 and 
Oms,
 who were to be joyned by 
de Wilde,
 and 
Van∣der Zaan,
 who were then towards 
Cadiz,
 as likewise by the 
Amsterdam
 men of War that were in those parts, in case 
de Ruiter
 stood in need of more considerable Forces for the Execu∣tion of his designs. He therefore set sail the 24th. of 
December,
 having under his Convoy a Merchant Fleet of about 80 sail, bound for 
France, Portugal, Spain,
 or the 
Streights,
 
 on the 20th. of 
January,
 he arrived at 
Cadiz,
 where he Anchored the 28th. of the same Month, he set sail again, and past the 
Streights,
 with 5 Mer∣chant ships; two days after meeting with 
de Wilde,
 and 
Vander Zaan,
 between 
Gibraltar
 and 
Malaga,
 he shewed them the States Or∣der for them to joyn his Admiral Flag: On the 19th of 
February,
 he arrived in 
Legorn
 Road, with 9 Merchant ships, whilst the rest separa∣ting themselves from the Squadron, steer'd their Course towards 
Malaga
 and 
Alicant
 whither they were bound. On the 26th. unmooring a∣gain, he was informed by a 
Hamburgher,
 that 2 
French
 Privateers, had appeared in those parts, and that three more were Equipping at 
Thou∣lon.


The losses the Privateers had caused to the 
Hollanders
 for several years past, in the Neigh∣bouring Seas, and especially in the Mediterranean were very great, and sensible. For when the Sieur 
Boreel,
 Ambassador from the United Provinces arrived at the Court of 
France
 towards the end of the year 1650, there were already 168 
Dutch
 Merchant ships taken by 
French
 Ca∣pers, since which, they were reckoned to have taken 160 more, so that the whole Number of all those prizes amounted to near 328 Ships which the Privateers of that Nation had taken, Detained, Pillaged, or Confiscated without any other grounds than th
se of a manifest usurpati∣on.

 These damages were reckoned at above 30 Millions of Livers. 
France
 even then in those early days, when she was so miserably torn and rent with intestine divisions, yet begun to make her Neighbours feel some effects of her Ambiti∣on, and in a time when one would have thought she had more need of Courting the Amity of the United Provinces, yet took a hank to attempt upon their Liberty by all those injustices; which ought to have been a warning piece to the 
Hol∣landers,
 and an assured presage for the time to come, to have made them fear much greater in∣justices from her afterwards whenever she should become Absolute Mistress of her then disconten∣ted people; what instances soever the States Ge∣neral could make to obtain satisfaction for so many damages, the Kings Council, and the Com∣missioners of the Admiralty took a Resolution to Restore nothing; so that what great justice so∣ever the Ambassador 
Boreel
 had on his side, to solicit the release of them in the name of the States, and in spite of all the diligence he could use for that end, he never was able to obtain any thing, the indulgence shewn by the Court to those Privateers its Subjects, was so great that it encouraged them so extremely, that there was no possibility of obtaining the release of any one Prize. Whereupon, the States General being at length wearied out with making so many fruit∣less Complaints, and apprehending lest their o∣ver great Patience might ruin their Commerce and their Subjects, they resolv'd at last to free themselves from all those Robberies by force of Arms, and to make use of reprisals. And accor∣dingly they Ordered 
de Ru
ter
 to attack the 
French
 Men of War that came out of the Ports of Provence to make excursions in the Mediter∣ranean, and to do all he could to take or sink them. 
De Ruiter
 then had been informed, as we have said, by a 
Hamburger,
 that 2 
French
 Priva∣teers

 that had Plundred him were still roving about those Seas. And on the 28th. of 
February
 at break of day, he discovered 2 ships near the Isle of 
Corsica,
 at about 3 miles distance from him, which seemed to look sharp after him, but when they came nearer within about a Mile of him, they begun to find they had to deal with men of War, and not with Merchant ships, which made them betake themselves to flight. However, about noon the ships of both Parties met between 
Gorgona
 and the Island of 
Corsica,
 without firing so much as a Gun on either side. Then 
de Ruiter
 Commanded the Cap∣tain of the biggest Caper to enter into his Boat, and come on board him; but the Captain contented himself to send his Lieutenant whom 
de Ruit
 detained, sending word to the Cap∣tain again that if he refused to obey his sum∣mons, he would immediately board him, and would make him suffer the punishment due to his obstinacy: At this second Command he en∣tred into the Boat, and came on board the Ad∣miral. Whilst 
de Ruiter
 and 
de Wilde
 kept close to the great Caper, the Captain 
Ooms,
 and 
Vander Zaan
 gave chace to the other, and like∣wise Commanded the Captain to come on board the Admiral, which he having done, 
Vander Zaan
 detained him likewise. So that the 2 Privateers seeing there was no hopes to escape, drew in their Guns out of their port-holes, and throwing down their Arms, submitted themselves to the Clemen∣cy of the Victor. They were 2 
Swedish
 Ships which some time before had been presented to the French King, but were afterwards Armed out by some Private Persons, and employed in the Pyrating Trade. The biggest of them called the Queen, had on board her 230 men, and 32 guns, whereof 30 were brass, the lesser which was called the Hunter, carried 182 men, and 28 guns, whereof 18 were brass. The 
French
 Sea∣men

 that were on board them, were Con∣ducted in 3 Barks, to 
Marseilles,
 but the Cap∣tains and Lieutenants were kept by the 
Hollan∣ders,
 and their ships carried to 
Cadiz.


The news of the taking of these 2 Privateers made a great noise in 
France,
 the Court there looking upon it as the most hanious attempt that 
de Ruiter
 could have committed in time of profound Peace. And Cardinal 
Mazarine
 who then had the chief management of all the Af∣fairs of the Kingdom, pretended to make it pass for an outrage that deeply wounded the Glory of his Master, and was a cruel stroke at his Grandure, and at that deference the United Provin∣ces ought to have for it. They gave out, that those ships were the Kings, and that it was an intollera∣ble piece of Boldness, to offer to attackt and seize them. And therefore in revenge, Express orders were sent to all the Harbours in the Kingdom, immediately to seize all Ships, Merchan∣dizes, and effects belonging to the 
Hollanders;
 which was executed accordingly. The Haughty and Imperious manner with which the Court of 
France
 treated the United Provinces on such an occasion as that, surprised them so much the more, because the King having at first imputed that pretended Hostile attempt wholly to 
De Ruiter,
 believed he had done it without the knowledge or consent of his Masters, who ex∣pected nothing less, than to see their Subjects to be ill treated by the confiscation of the ships and goods they had in that Kingdom. And that way of proceeding seemed so much the harder upon them, in that the 
French
 Court had pas∣s
d to the Execution of it without any warning given to the States, or desiring to know of them, whether they approved or disapproved of that Action of 
de Ruiter,
 and without so much as suffering their High and Mightinesses, after having so often reiterated by their Ambassadors so ma∣ny

 great and just Complaints of the damages they suffered by the 
French
 Privateers, to do themselves Justice. The States of 
Holland,
 though they had the greatest interest of any of the Provinces, in a Commerce with 
France,
 were for intirely forbidding all Trade with that King∣dom; after they had seized and stopt all French ships and effects in 
Holland,
 and all the other Pro∣vinces. But the States General not being so much concerned at what past in 
France,
 as the Province of 
Holland,
 That Resolution was let fall, and came to nothing. All that they could do, was only, to prevail with the States Ge∣neral, to Summon Deputies to the 
Hague,
 from all the Colleges of the Admiralty, to Consult, about Arming out a Fleet of 48 men of War, which they resolved to put out to Sea; with Orders, to give private notice to all Pilots and Masters of Merchant ships, to avoid the Ports of France. The States writ also to Mr. 
Boreel
 their Ambassador in 
France,
 to represent to His Majesty the injustice that was done them, in order to obtain a discharge of the ships, and Merchandizes, that were seized; as likewise all the Insupportable Robberies Committed upon their Subjects for several years together by the 
French
 Privateers; without forgetting the 2 Capers taken by 
de Ruiter.
 But Mr. 
Bo∣reel
 had prevented these Orders of the States before he received them. For immediately af∣ter the abovemention'd Resolution of the Court, he demanded Audience of the King, in Order to Represent to him his Rea∣sons. Which being granted him, He Re∣monstrated very fully and at large, 
That it had been but fit before his Majesty had proceeded a∣ny further, to notifie to the States General of the Ʋnited Provinces, his Mrs. the reasons that in∣duced the Court to take Resolutions so prejudicial to them, that the said States on their side, might

 enter into Consideration how to give his Majesty all agreeable satisfaction on that Subject. After which, he excused
 de Ruiter, 
as far as the Infor∣mation he had been able to get of the matter, would permit, and according to the reports that were spread abroad of his late Enterprize, and of that attempt which was the Subject of the Courts Complaint. He passed on next to the dama∣ges the Subjects of their High and Mighti∣nesses had suffered for so many years, by the con∣tinual depredations which the
 French 
Privateers had Committed, and continued still to Commit up∣on their Merchant Ships, notwithstanding the so often repeated instances to the Contrary, in the Court of
 France, 
and always in vain. He ad∣ded, that in the space of
 9 
years, as we have said, there had been about
 328 
Merchant Ships be∣longing to the States Subjects, Taken or Plunder∣ed; He made mention likewise of
 58 
sentences given against
 French 
Privateers, which he had still in his hands, without ever having been able to get any of them put in Excution, through the fault of the Courts of justice that were too indul∣gent to those Privateers, which made them so inso∣lent and seditious, that they had ventured even to attempt upon the Authority of his Majesties Com∣missaries at
 Thoulon, 
by driving them away like miserable wretches; that the
 Dutch 
Consul na∣med,
 de la Fleur, 
who resided at
 Thoulon, 
was attackt in the streets by those villains, who char∣ged him with unmercifull blows, and would doubt∣less have Assassinated him, if he had not found means to escape out of the reach of their fury, with great hazard of his life; and all that, with∣out any other Reason, than because he had deli∣vered into the hands of his Majesties Commissi∣oners, the sentences rendred against them, in Or∣der to get them put effectually in Execution. In fine, he intreated the King, that sufficient time might be granted him, to inform the States his Ma∣sters,

 of the Subject of his Majesties Complaint; and that in the mean while, he would be plea∣sed to suspend the Execution of the Orders that were given to seize the Ships and effects of his Nation; as not at all doubting, but that the States would give his Majesty all reasonable satis∣faction.


The King having heard him very quietly, made him this Answer: 
I have sent Orders to 
r.
 de Thou, 
who is on his Journey to
 Holland 
to demand Reparation from the States for the Hostile attempt committed by
 de Ruiter, 
and when I shall have received satisfaction thereup∣on, I know what I have to do concerning your de∣mand: But at present I have nothing to Answer to it.
 Mr. 
de Thou
 arrived at the 
Hague,
 the 25th. of 
April,
 and in the first Audience he had of the States General, he loudly Resound∣ed the Complaints of his Master concerning the taking of the 2 Privateers, demanding, without offering to speak of other things, they should be forthwith restored without any further de∣lay, and that 
de Ruiter
 should be severely punish'd. To which they answered him, that as to what concerned the taking of the said two ships, and the Conduct of the States in that matter, they pretended to give him such a rea∣sonable explication thereupon as should make it so clear to him, that he himself would at∣tribute all the Justice to the States. In the mean while, the States of 
Holland
 among o∣ther propositions made there, had Voted in the Assembly of the States General, that to oblige the 
French
 King to submit to reason, it was neces∣sary to forbid all Commerce in any of the Mer∣chandizes of 
France;
 to stop and seize all Ships and effects belonging to the 
French,
 and to take all their Ships they could meet with at Sea. That further it would be requisite, to Augment

 the Fleet they had resolved to Arm out, with 12 Ships of War more, to render it the more Potent. In Consequence of all which Resoluti∣ons, an Ordinance was publish d sign'd the 26th. of 
April,
 by virtue of which, all the Ships, Mer∣chandizes, Moneys, Effects, Letters of Ex∣change, and Debts, which should be found to be∣long to the 
French
 in the Province of 
Holland,
 were to be seized and Confiscated. After which, the States General, at the sollicitation of the States of 
Holland,
 publish'd another Ordinance dated the 11th of 
May,
 by which they for∣bad the importation of Salt, Wines, and Fruits, and all other Commodities of the growth of 
France,
 and all Merchandizes of their Manufactures.


In fine, there was a great deal of reason to fear, that these growing troubles would quickly degenerate into a cruel War between the Crown of 
France,
 and the United Provinces: But those two powers reflecting seriously upon the mis∣chiefs and Calamities such a War would assured∣ly bring upon the people on both sides, 
France
 became more tractable and peaceable; And 
Hol∣land
 having no other end than to preserve Peace with that Crown, it was at last agreed on both sides, that the Ships and Effects of both Nations should be mutually released; that the two Ships the Queen and the Hunter, taken by 
de Ruiter
 should be restored, and that for the future, such proper measures should be taken, as might be effectual to prevent the hapning of any more like disorders.


During these intervening transactions, 
de Rui∣ter,
 lying at an Anchor, in 
Cadiz
 Road, Recei∣ved on the 7th. of 
April,
 a Re-inforcement of 6 Men of War, Commanded by the Captains, 
Verveen, Vander Hulst, Sweers, Kampen, Schat∣ter,
 and 
Adelaar.
 So that having then under his Conduct a Squadron of 12 men of War, he resolved, to go again before 
Sally.
 In Order

 to which, he had beforehand written in the Month of 
January
 preceeding, to 
de Ʋries,
 Con∣sul of the Dutch Nation for the Coast of 
Bar∣bary,
 residing at 
Sally,
 that he intended, in pur∣suance of the Orders of his Masters, to come to 
Sally
 again at the spring of the year, to put a finishing hand to the Treaty of Peace already begun the year before; and that therefore for that effect, he charged him in the name of the States, to give notice of it to Prince 
Sid Abdala,
 and to dispose all things in such a manner, that at his arrival, they might proceed on both sides to the speedy Execution and Compleating of it without any delay. He accordingly arrived be∣fore 
Sally,
 on the 18th of 
April,
 two days af∣ter 4 Ships he had detacht out of his Squadron to give chace to the Corsairs, had rejoyned him: And hearing at his arrival, that the Treaty was already concluded, he went back and Anchored a∣gain at 
Cadiz.


In 
September,
 Vice-Admiral 
de Ruiter
 received Letters from the States General, and from the Ad∣miralty, with orders to cruize upon the Coasts of 
Portugal,
 to joyn the Fleet of 13 men of War which the States were sending that way under the Command of Lieutenant Admiral 
Opdam.
 For the differences the United Provinces had had with 
France,
 having engaged them for their se∣curity, to Arm out that Force, they were wil∣ling to make use of it after they were appeas∣ed to bring Portugal to reason, that it might not be said, they had been at all that great ex∣pence for nothing. The States pretended by the way of Arms, to force the King of 
Portu∣gal,
 to make Reparation for all the Hostilities Committed by the 
Portugueses
 upon their Sub∣jects in 
Brasile
 and other places; For which effect, they gave notice to 
de Ruiter:
 that whilst he was waiting for Lieutenant Admiral 
Op∣dam
's Fleet, he should cruize against the 
Portu∣guese


 Fleet that was to come from 
Brasile,
 and against all other Ships belonging to that Nation, and should endeavour to take them, in order to facilitate thereby an Accommodation with that Crown, and force it to give an account for all its usurpations; which obliged them likewise, to send some Deputies along with Lieutentant Admiral 
Opdam,
 into 
Portugal;
 adding, That if the 
Portuguese
 Ships offered to make any re∣sistance, 
de Ruiter
 should fight them, and do his best to take, or sink them.


The Fleet designed for the Ocean, under the Command of Lieutenant Admiral 
Opdam;
 sail'd then out of the 
Meuse,
 the 5th. of 
September
 Consisting of 12 Men of War, 1 Advice Yacht, and 1 Flute laden with Provisions. They came to an Anchor on the 25th. in the mouth of the 
Tagus
 near 
Lisbon.
 The same day the Sieurs 
Ten Hove
 and 
de Wit,
 Envoys from the States, going into a Yacht, went up the River, and two days after, were admitted to an Audience of the Queen Mother who then held the Reins of the Government, assisted by some Grandees of the Kingdom, during the minority of the King her Son. The Envoys then Represented their Grievances, and demanded restitution of all that had been taken from the States in 
Bra∣sile
 and elsewhere, and an indemnification for all their losses. But the 
Portugueses
 after some Con∣ferences, answered, that they were resolved to Restore nothing? No, not so much as one foot of Land. So positive an Answer as that put an end in an instant to their Negotiation. Some days before, that Court had put out an Order, to forbid all the 
Dutch
 Ships at 
Lisbon,
 and St. 
Hubes,
 to stir out of those Ports till further Order. In the mean while, the States Envoys set on work the 
Dutch
 Consul, named 
Vander Hoeve;
 who u∣sed all imaginable ipmortunities at the Court of 
Portugal,
 to obtain a Liberty of Commerce, since

 as he alledged, the States Fleet had not yet Com∣mitted any Act of Hostility against the 
Portugue∣ses,
 Representing to them at the same time, that the seizure and stoppage they had newly made of the 
Dutch
 Ships, was like to be the 
Plreudium
 of a world of Mischiefs.: But with all he could say, he could obtain nothing of them but a few fair promises without any effect. The Envoys therefore seeing they did but lose their time there to no purpose, Demanded their Au∣dience of leave: But Answer was made them, that the Queen was so indisposed that she was not in a Condition to give them Audience at that time. Upon which, they delivered to 
Pedro Vierra de Silva,
 the Secretary of State, a Let∣ter sealed up, telling him withal, that they were very sensibly troubled, they could not take leave of the Queen in the usual Form, by reason of her Majesties indisposition, and that therefore they prayed him to deliver her Majesty that Letter, which in substance imported, that since they had used all the means they could, to terminate the differences between the two Nations in an amicable manner without any success, they had Order from the States their Masters, to declare War against the Crown of 
Portugal,
 as ac∣cordingly they did; after which going again on board their Yacht, they joyned the 
Dutch
 Fleet the 23d. of 
October,
 where they informed Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
Opdam
 of all that had passed. On the 26th. of the same Month, 
de Ruiter
's Squadron joyned the Admirals Flag, and the Fleet by that Junction, was reinforced to the Number of 27 or 28 men of War. During the time that Lieutenant Admiral 
Opdam
 continued on the Coasts of 
Lisbon,
 some 
Portuguese
 Ships or other vessels laden with their Merchandizes were taken; but the Booty taken off of 
Roxont
 was much more considerable; For in the night time, a Part of the 
Portuguese
 Fleet of about 40

 sail coming from 
Brasile
 Laden with Sugar, fell into the 
Dutch
 Fleet, and tho the darkness of the night favoured their fight, by stealing them from their Enemies fight, yet 20 of them were taken. There were still 44 more with their Convoy that remained behind, being kept back by a Tempest, against whom the 
Hollanders
 for some days cruiz'd, watching for their coming, but seeing they appeared not, and being uncertain whe∣ther they were not already gotten into some safe Port, they took a Resolution to prevent Winter, by retiring home to their own Coun∣try, before the Stormy Weather came in. And accordingly, they arrived in 
Holland
 with all their Prizes at the beginning of 
December.


The year following, 
de Ruiter
 was sent again to the Coast of 
Portugal,
 with a Fleet of 22 Ships of War; 
 But the 
Portuguese
 considering of what great Consequence it was for them, to preserve their Sea Forces, and how dangerous to hazard them in a Battle, kept their Fleet within their Ports, being perswaded, that Win∣ter would, as it did last year, force the 
Hol∣landers
 to quit their Coasts; so that 
de Ruiter
 was able to do them no other harm that Expedition, than only to interrupt their Commerce, and alarm their whole Country.


We have above related, what means the U∣nited Provinces used, to break the designs of 
Swedeland,
 in the year 1656, and to free 
Dant∣zick,
 and the 
Baltick
 Sea from the oppression of that Power. That War which had made the States so uneasie, and put them to so much expence, was followed by another much more bloody and dangerous. For 
Frederick
 the III. King of 
Denmark,
 seeing the 
Swedish
 Monarch Employed with his whole Forces in prosecuting the War he had with 
Poland,
 and considering, that was a fair occasion for him to strike in, and Revenge his Father, 
Christiern
 the Vth's Quar∣rel,

 who about 15 years before was oppressed by his Arms, and had part of his Dominions taken from him, he without any hesitation, de∣clared himself, being inflamed on one side, with the desire of Revenge, and on the other, put for∣ward by the secret allurements of a certain Fo∣reign Power. And accordingly marching his Ar∣my into the Country of 
Bremen
 under the Com∣mand of General 
Bilde,
 he attackt and took se∣veral places belonging to the 
Swedes.
 But For∣tune that had gone along with his Arms in their happy beginning proving afterwards Jadish to him, deserted him to that degree, that he soon saw himself at the point of losing all his Do∣minions. For 
Charles Gustavus,
 King of 
Swede∣land,
 Quitting 
Poland
 immediately upon that News, came hastning to the Assistance of what more nearly concerned him, and fell with all his forces into 
Hostein
 belonging to 
Denmark,
 so that by that Diversion, he forced General 
Bilde
 to Quit the Dutchy of 
Bremen,
 and to retire to 
Fredericksode.
 But that place being situated upon the little 
Belt
 that separates the Isle of 
Funen
 from the Firm land of 
Jutland,
 was soon reduced under the obedience of 
Swede∣land.
 King 
Gustavus
 stopt not the Career of his Conquests there, but passing his Army which was almost all Horse, over the Ice, he enter∣ed the Isle of 
Funen,
 where he put to the Sword all that opposed his Triumphant Arms: In that passage, the Ice hapning to break in a certain place, 2 Ensigns and the King of 
Swedens
 Coach were swallowed up. 
Odonsee,
 the Capital Town of the Island yielded without resistance, and the Town of 
Nyburg
 was also taken.


King 
Charles Gustavus
 being eager to carry the Terror of Arms his yet further, Consulted with his Generals, to resolve, whether it were practi∣cable for him to pass his Army over the Ice, to enter into the Isle of 
Zealand.
 But they being

 now to pass the Grand 
Belt,
 which is an Arm of the Sea about 4 hours march over, that Enterprize seemed to them extreamly Rash and Dangerous, because if the Ice should happen to break, the whole Army would be in hazard of being swa
lowed, or if any part of it should be so happy as to escape, they would be shut up in that Isle till the spring time. But 
Gustavus,
 who was a Couragious and Daring Prince, was willing to prove Fortune that had so far ac∣companied his Arms, and resolved to attempt that undertaking▪ which he lookt upon as what would Compleat all his Labours. In the mean while Sr. 
Thomas Meadow
 Ambassador from the Protector 
Cromwel,
 at the Court of 
Denmark,
 desirous to put a stop to the Conquests of that Prince, dispatcht a Courier to 
Funen,
 with Letters in which he made him some overtures for Peace. King 
Gustavus
 observing, that the Cou∣rier had past upon the Ice over the Grand 
Belt
 on horse back, concluded, it would be strong e∣nough to bear his Army, and therefore fin
ing, that the cold Augmented, instead of abating, he advanced the very next morning without Re∣maining any longer in suspence, towards the Isle 
Langeland,
 and from thence into the Coun∣try of 
Laland,
 where the Town of 
Naskou
 was reduced to his obedience. From thence he car∣ried his Arms into the Isle of 
Falster,
 where he took the Fort Royal, 
Nikoping,
 after which, having crossed the 
Belt,
 he entered into the Isle of 
Zealand,
 that is to say, into the heart of the King of 
Denmarks
 Dominions, and immediately got possession of the Town of 
Wisburg,
 and was just ready to march at the head of his Army, before 
Copenhagen,
 when the Ambassador from the Court of 
England
 arrived, to present him a Mediation for a Peace. At his first interviews with him, King 
Charles Gustavus
 finding himself in the midst of so many Prosperities, refused it,

 but at last, growing more tractable, he consent∣ed to a Project of Peace that was drawn up and Concluded at 
Toustrup
 the 28th. of 
February,
 and on the 8th. of 
March
 following, after it had been more amply examined, it was ratified at 
Rotschild.
 That Treaty was altogether disad∣vantagious to the King of 
Denmark,
 and to the United Provinces, because it was therein a∣greed between the two Princes of the North, to shut up the 
Sound,
 and suffer no Forreign Man of War to pass into the Baltick Sea. Be∣sides, the King of 
Denmark
 by reason of the Conquests 
Gustavus
 had newly made, to yield up to him the Propriety of a good part of his Dominions, namely 
Ho
land, Schoonen, Blecking, Bornholm, Bahus,
 and 
Drontheim.
 And though these Conditions were very hard to 
Denmark,
 yet the 
Swede
 was not content with them, but threatned to enter a second time into the Isle of 
Zealand,
 to besiege 
Copenhagen,
 and to reduce the whole Kingdom under his obedience, if the King of 
Denmark
 did not fully satisfy all points of the Treaty of 
Rotschild.
 The Article of which that obliged them to shut up the passage of the 
Sound
 against all Foreign Ships of War, caused new Umbrages, because the 
Danes
 would by no means consent to it. Whereupon at last, the K. of 
Sweden
 being desirous fully to gratifie his Ambition, and push forward his great designs to their utmost extent, made a descent in the Month of 
August,
 with a powerfull Army in∣to the Isle of 
Zealand,
 and whilst his Troops were landing there, he made his Fleet advance before 
Copenhagen,
 to form the siege of it; which was so effectually done, that it may be said, that if the 
Hollanders
 had not time∣ly succor'd it, in all appearance, the Triumphant 
Gustavus
 would have reduced that Capital Ci∣ty to his obedience, and put a Period to the Kingdom of 
Denmark,
 tho' formerly its Mistress;

 so great a Vicissitude there is in the Fortunes of States and Kingdoms!


The Affairs of the North being in that ticklish Condition, the States of the 
Ʋnited Provinces
 made serious Reflexions upon what might happen in the Time to come, and thought upon freeing the 
Baltick
 Sea from the Oppression of 
Swedeland,
 by sending speedy a
d powerful Succours to the King of 
Denmark,
 who was on the Point, otherwise, in all Appearance, to lose all his Dominions. For the Security of their Commerce in the North, that supplied them with a great part of their Riches, and with Naval Stores, and other Necessaries for Building and Maintaining their Shipping, and Sup∣porting their Sea-power; by which they were en∣abled to carry on their Traffick all over the rest of the World, and to secure indeed their all, both by Sea and Land, wholly depending upon their brisk and timely Interposition, in that critical Juncture, suffered them no longer to hesitate in their Reso∣lutions. And therefore the States determined in so pressing an occasion, to assemble all the Ships of War, that were in a Condition to put to Sea, in order to form a considerable Fleet; the chief Com∣mand of which was conferred upon Lieutenant-Admiral 
Opdam;
 the other General Officers were, the Vice-Admirals 
de Wit,
 and 
Florisz.
 They em∣barked also on Board that Fleet Thirty eight Com∣panies of Regular Infantry, in all about Two thou∣sand Men, with design to throw some of them into 
Copenhagen,
 and the rest into the Castle of 
Kro∣nenburg,
 upon the 
Sound.
 The Fleet then being equipped with an incredible Diligence, Lieutenant-Admiral 
Opdam
 set sail the 17th of 
October;
 it was composed of 38 Ships of War, and six Flutes, laden with Ammunition and Provisions, of four Fire-ships, and six Galleots.


About the end of the same Month, the Fleet ar∣rived to the North-east of 
Jutland:
 But in the mean while, the Castle of 
Kronenburg
 had surren∣dred

 to the 
Swedes,
 on the 26th of 
September,
 af∣ter a Siege of three Weeks, and 
Copenhagen
 it self was briskly pressed. The King of 
Denmark
 be∣ing then in Person in that his Capital City, ani∣mated by his Presence, the Soldiers and Burgers, to make a vigorous Resistance, flattering them with the Hopes of seeing themselves in a short time delivered by the 
Hollanders:
 But the 
Swedes,
 as we have said, having made themselves Masters of the Castle of 
Kronenburg,
 had shut up the 
Sound
 with their Fleet, so that the 
Dutch
 Fleet was forced of necessity to open its way through the midst of that of the Enemy's, which was near of an equal Force with theirs, and to endure all the Fire of both the Castles, on each Side, that de∣fended and stopt up the Passage of that Strait. It's true, the Danger was very great, but the At∣tempt was glorious, since it aimed at no less than at the Deliverance of a distressed King; who, af∣ter having lost all his Dominions, was ready to fall himself into the Hands of his Enemies. The 3d of 
November,
 the 
Dutch
 Fleet, by a contrary Wind, was obliged to anchor behind the 
Lap,
 at the Mouth of the 
Sound. Wrangel,
 Admiral of 
Swedeland,
 had under his Flag Thirty eight Men of War, which were mostly mann'd by 
English
 and 
Sco
ch
 Seamen; and his Design was to dispute the Passage of the 
Sound,
 against the 
Hollanders.
 In the mean while, Lieutenant Admiral 
Opdam,
 who waited for nothing else but a favourable Wind, to advance, finding it on the 8th chopt about to the North, he divided his Fleet into Three Squa∣drons, and set sail about Break of Day. Vice-Admiral 
De Wit
 led the Vanguard, Lieutenant-Admiral 
Opdam
 the main Battle, and Vice-Admiral 
Florisz
 commanded the Rear. About Eight a Clock before Noon, 
De Wit
's Squadron was got∣ten into the middle of the 
Sound,
 between the Two Castles of 
Kronenburg
 and 
Elsenburg,
 where∣of one is in the Isle of 
Zealand,
 and the other in

 the Province of 
Schoneng.
 As soon as 
De Wit
 was come right against those Fortresses, King 
Gustavus
 fir'd against him,
 all the Artillery of both the Castles; nay, and that Prince, who was in Per∣son at 
Kronenburg,
 fir'd with his own Hand the first Gun that was discharged at the 
Dutch.
 How∣ever, the 
Dutch
 Men of War, gliding along di∣rectly in the Middle of the Strait, there were very few Bullets that reach'd to do them harm, so that they past through without much Loss. About Ten a Clock in the Forenoon the Two Fleets engaged in a Cruel Fight, in View of the King of 
Swede∣land,
 of the Queen, and of the Princess his Sister, Wife to the Count 
de la Guarde,
 as also of eldest Son of the Prince of 
Holstean Gollorp,
 and of several other great Lords of the Court, who, being alto∣gether in the Castle of 
Kronenburg,
 were joynt Spectators of that Bloody and Terrible Fight. The 
Swedes,
 at first, bent all their principal Forces against the 
Dutch
 Lieutenant-Admiral, and his Two Vice-Admirals, as thinking, if they could but disable the Generals of their Enemy's Fleet, it would be no hard matter for them to gain the Victory over the rest, when they should want Heads to command them. And, in effect, that be∣ginning did not succeed amiss to them, at first: For Vice-Admiral 
De Wit,
 after having signaliz'd himself to the utmost, was mortally wounded; and his Ship taken for want of Help; but he Dy∣ing, and the Ship sinking immediately after, no∣thing remained to the Enemies but his Body. Vice-Admiral 
Florisz
 underwent the same Fate as 
De Wit,
 for as he was fighting with an unparallel'd Intrepidity, he lost his Life with Sword in Hand, as likewise did the Captain under him, and 36 of his Men: So that none of the General Officers were then left but Lieutenant Admiral 
Opdam,
 to bear the whole B
nt of the furious Efforts of the 
Swedes,
 who 
hav
d himself so couragiously, that he qui
kly 
de th
m see, by a vigorous Re∣sistance,

 that Fortune had chosen him to revenge the Death of so many other brave Men. For, du∣ring Two long Hours together, without any other Help, he stood the Fire of all the Guns of Seven 
Swedish
 Ships, who hotly ply'd him all that Time with continual Broad-sides of their Cannon. He had received several Shot between Wind and Wa∣ter; which latter had gain'd already Five or Six Foot deep in his Ship, and his Prow was on Fire: His Masts, his Rigging and all his Sails were shot down close by the Board, so that he was reduc'd into a very pitiful Condition, when Captain 
Van Nes
 advanc'd one of the foremost, to his Assi∣stance. Captain 
Kampen,
 likewise, having forc'd his Passage through the Enemy's, with an admirable Courage, flew in like Lightning to the Admiral's Aid; which Two Ships were extremely shattered, and that of the Admiral run great Danger of being sunk or burnt. He had on Board him Thirty seven Men killed, and about One hundred wound∣ed; but he triumphed over all those Disasters, by his great Bravery and wise Conduct. But if the General Officers of the States Fleet happened to be ill treated, those of the 
Swedes
 fared never the better for it: For Admiral 
Wrangel,
 and Vice-Admiral 
Bielkenstern,
 and several others, having their Ships shot through and through, and all shattered, were forced to retire out of the Fight. Three 
Swedish
 Ships were taken, and Eight sunk, or burnt. The 
Hollanders
 lost in all that Action on∣ly the Ship 
Brederode,
 commanded by Vice-Ad∣miral 
De Wit,
 which, as we have said, sunk, after she was taken. The 
Swedes,
 on their Side, had above Two thousand Men killed, besides what were wounded and made Prisoners; the Number of which latter was reckoned to be about Four hun∣dred and fifty. The Number of the Slain, on the 
Hollander's
 Side, amounted to near Four hun∣dred Men, and a great many they had wounded. Among the former, were counted the Two Vice-Admirals,

 and the Captains 
Bruinsveld
 and 
Ver∣veen.
 The Battle lasted 5 or 6 Hours, till the 
Swed
sh
 Fleet made away towards the Main Sea: For tho' they had the Advantage of the Weather-gage, yet they suffered the 
Hollanders
 to retreat, who were stopped from advancing towards them by a contrary Wind; shewing sufficiently by their Behaviour, that they knew well enough, there was nothing to be gotten by them, and that they could not venture to charge the 
Dutch
 again, without running great Hazard of an entire Defeat. Lieu∣tenant-Admiral 
Opdam,
 seeing the 
Swedes
 were be∣come immo
eable, by refusing to renew the Fight again, got his Ships together, and sail'd towards the Isle of 
Huen.
 Towards evening, he met 
B
elk,
 the 
Danish
 Admiral, who by a North Wind was hindred from coming to joyn the 
Hollanders,
 and share with them in the Glory of that Fight. After that junction, the Fleet, came and anchored near the Coast of 
Zeland,
 between 
l
enore
 and 
Copen∣hagen;
 and the 
Swedish
 Fleet retired under the Canon of the Castle of 
Kronenburg:
 But King 
Gustavus,
 not thinking it secure enough there, gave them Order to put into the Haven of 
Lands∣kroon;
 which is a Town in the Province of 
Scho∣nen.


That Prince being minded, after the Fight, to give the World some Proofs of his incomparable Generosity, and of the high Veneration he had for those Great Men that glory in spending their Blood for their Country's Service, commanded the Body of Vice-Admi
al 
e Wit
 to be cloathed with white Satin, and to be put into a Coffin covered with black Cloth, and adorned with the Arms of the deceased: After which he caused it to be embarked in a Galliot, painted with Black, with Streamers of the same Colour, and to be carryed to Lieute∣nant Admiral 
Opdam.
 The Bodies of the Two Vice-Admirals, 
De Wit
 and 
Florisz
 were after∣wards transported into 
Holland,
 and buryed at

 the Charge of the State, with all the Honours due to their Memory, 
De Wit
 was interred at 
Roter∣dam,
 and 
Florisz
 at 
Hoorn;
 and the States, to im∣mortalize the Memory of their good Services, or∣dered to be paid to the Heirs of each of them 3000 Livers, to be bestowed upon a Piece of Marble, whereupon to engrave their Epitaphs. That of Vice Admiral 
De Wit
 was as follows, in 
Latin.

To the Merits and Immortality of 
De Witten Cornelius de VVith,
 Kt.


Who owed his Greatness to that Element, to which 
Holland
 hitherto owes the chiefest of hers; who has sailed about the whole Globe of the World, and seen both the Indies, in Quality of Mari∣ner and Soldier, and afterwards of Captain both of Mariners and Soldiers; after he had taken a Scout-Ship, called, 
the Guard,
 as be∣ing superior in Courage, tho' inferior in Force, he opened a Way to the taking of the 
Spanish American
 Plate-fleet. He took, burnt and sunk an infinite number of Ships of divers Nations; and having passed through all the Degrees of Naval Warfare, he was made Vice-Admiral, and had the Conduct of the Fleet of his Coun∣try, and of their Sea-Expeditions, for the Space of Twenty Years. He fought Fifteen set Bat∣tles with the Enemies Fleets, and came out of the Fight seldom with equal Loss, but most commonly Victorious and Triumphant. There remained but one Great and Fatal Day, to put an End to so many Heroick Feats of War, which was the 8th of 
November,
 in the Year 
1658.
 when he gave the last Proof of his Va∣lour, in the Strait of the 
Baltick
 Sea; where rushing foremost into the Fight, he attacqued

 the Admiral of 
Swedeland,
 and disabled him; and afterwards fighting with the Vice-Admi∣ral, and several other great Ships of the same Enemy's, extreamly well provided with Arms and Couragious Seamen, He, with his single Vice-Admiral's Ship, repulsed, disabled, and sunk them; till, at last, being wholly deserted by his Companions, and on all Sides surrounded by the Enemies, his Body being rent with Bul∣lets, he yielded up his War-like Soul to Heaven. The King himself, his Enemy, out of an Ad∣miration of the generous Fortitude of so brave an Enemy, sent back his Body, magnificently habited, and put up, into his Country. So Re∣turn all they whom Honour and Valour send back. He lived 
LIX.
 Years.










The next Day after the Battle, the Transport Ships, laden with Troops and Ammunition, went before 
Copenhagen,
 where Colonel 
Fuchler,
 who commanded the Soldiers, landed them. So that the 
Hollanders
 may be said to have gained all the Advantage of that celebrated Fight, because they executed their Design, which was to succour that important Place. However, Lieutenant-Admiral 
Opdam
 had Orders from the States, to winter with his whole Fleet at 
Copenhagen;
 where his Presence, and the Assistance of the Soldiers and 
Dutch
 Seamen he brought with him, contributed not a little to the Repulsing of the many violent Assaults the 
Swedes
 made from time to time upon the Works of the Town.


In the mean while, the 
States,
 who laid nothing so much to Heart as the Consequence of the Affairs of the North; and knowing of what great Impor∣tance 'twas, to keep an even Ballance between 
Swede∣land
 and 
Denmark,
 by hindring the stronger of them to oppress the weaker, resolved to arm out, for that purpose, a second Fleet, the chief Com∣mand

 of which was given to 
De Ruiter,
 who was returning from 
Portugal.
 It consisted of Forty Men of War, on Board which was embarked a Succour of Four thousand Regular Troops, com∣manded by Colonel 
Killigrew.


On the 20th of 
May,
 Vice-Admiral 
De Ruiter,
 set sail. 
Meppel,
 who was made Vice-Admiral of 
Holland,
 of the College of the Admiralty of the 
North,
 took the Place of Vice-Admiral 
Florisz,
 and embarked, by way of Provision, on the Ship cal∣led the 
Orange-Tree,
 of 
North-Holland. De Rui∣ter
 divided his Fleet into three Squadrons; the first was under his own Command, the second under 
Evertsz,
 and the third under the Conduct of 
Mep∣pel.
 The 10th of 
June
 he arrived at the Mouth of the 
Belt,
 and some Days after, he joyned Lieute∣nant-Admiral 
Opdam;
 so that then the States Fleet was Seventy eight Sail strong of Men of War, Six or Seven Fire-ships, and Ten Galliots, mann'd with One thousand three hundred Mariners and Soldiers, besides the Four thousand Regular Troops that were in 
de Ruiter
's Fleet; and was mounted with Three thousand two hundred Guns.


In the mean while, the 
English,
 conceiving a Jea∣lousie at the formidable Forces the 
Hollanders
 had assembled towards the North, sent likewise thi∣ther a Fleet of Forty two Sail of Men of War, under the Comman
 of Admiral 
Mountague,
 who came into the 
Belt
 to observe their Motions. 
Op∣dam,
 not being able to penetrate the Design of the 
English,
 put out a white Flag, and summoned on Board him all the General Officers and Captains of his Fleet, and commanded them to keep them∣selves in Readiness for a Fight, and not to forget their Honour, and the Oath of Fidelity they had sworn to their Country. The next Morning Ad∣miral 
Mountague
 writ to Lieutenant-Admiral 
Op∣dam,
 and to Vice-Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 telling them, That he was come to endeavour to bring the Two Crowns of the North to an Accommodation;

 that he was persuaded, their High and Mightinesses Fleet had likewise no other Aaim but that, and therefore that it would be convenient for them to act by Consent on both Sides, and to put in pra∣ctise all proper Means that might contribute to the pacifying of those two Crowns, and to the main∣taining a perfect Union between the two Repub∣licks. Answer was made him, That the 
Dutch
 had no other Design neither, but that: Upon which, the 
English
 Admiral set sail, and after noon ad∣vanced further into the 
Belt.
 The 
Dutch
 perceiv∣ing it, unmoored likewise, and stood after the 
English,
 to hinder them from cutting off the 
Da∣nish,
 and some 
Holland
 Ships, that lay at Anchor near 
Nyburg,
 by separating them from the Body of the 
Dutch
 Fleet. But the 
English
 making off into the Main Sea, retired to 
Kallundburg,
 and the 
Hollanders
 towards the Isle of 
Rouse;
 where the 
Danes
 came and joyned them. In the mean time, while the Ambassadors of the States, that came with 
de Ruiter
's Fleet, were negotiating a Treaty of Peace between the Two Crowns at 
Copenhagen,
 the 
English
 interrupted it by their un∣derhand Practices, in proposing a Cessation of Arms for Three Weeks; which extremely trou∣bled the 
Hollanders,
 and obliged 
de Ruiter
 to write about it to the College of the Admiralty of 
Amsterdam,
 intimating to them, That the 
English,
 as far as he was able to judge by their manner of Proceeding, seemed ill intentioned, notwithstand∣ing all their fair Protestations, and that he believed, they turned Affairs in that manner, with Design to favour 
Swedeland.
 Three Days before the Term prefixed for the Suspension of Arms was to expire, which was on the 10th of 
July,
 Lieutenant-Admi∣ral 
Opdam
's Fleet, in conjunction with the 
Danes,
 making together about Thirty seven Sail of Men of War, set sail directly for 
Copenhagen;
 which the 
Swedes
 kept besieged with a Fleet of Thirty three Ships of War; but at the Approach of the Admi∣ral

 of 
Holland,
 they retired, without daring to stand a Fight; which much surprized 
Opdam,
 who expected not to be rid of them at so cheap a rate.


 
 In the mean while, the 
English
 Ministers that were endeavouring, with those of 
Holland,
 to mediate an Accommodation, considering, it was not ne∣cessary the two Mediating Powers should have such numerous and formidable Forces towards the North, only to counterbalance 
Swedeland,
 proposed that they might be diminished. But the States suspect∣ing there was some Mystery in the Matter on the 
English
 side, ordered, That but 20 of their Ships should be recalled, causing private Notice to be given to Lieutenant-Admiral 
Opdam,
 not to send them away neither, till a like number of the 
En∣glish
 were gone before them. But all those Precau∣tions of the States became in short time needless, by the Revolution that was ready to happen in 
England,
 by the Intriegues of General 
Monk,
 whose Aim was, to pull down 
Cromwel
's Party, in order to restore King 
Charles
 to the Throne. For Admiral 
Mountague,
 who held Intelligence with 
Monk,
 burn'd with an impatient Desire to quit the North, with the 
English
 Fleet, and to hasten home to the Assistance of King 
Charles
's Party; and seeking all the Pretences he could think on to promote his speedy departure, he gave out, That, for want of Provisions, his Fleet was able to sub∣sist no longer abroad, and so setting Sail on the 5th of 
September,
 he returned back to the Coasts of 
England.


Vice-Admiral 
de Ruiter
 having weighed An∣chor the same day, moved, and cast Anchor a∣gain at 
Amak
 near 
Copenhagen,
 from whence he went ashore and went to a Tent set up between the Town and the 
Swedish
 Army, where the States Ambassadors, and those of 
Sweden
 and 
Denmark
 were in Conference about a Peace. But Affairs going quite another way than towards

 an Accommodation, Hostilities were begun again. In the mean time Lieutenant Admiral 
Opdam
 ha∣ving written to the States, to desire leave to re∣turn home because of his indisposition, he accord∣ingly set sail at the beginning of 
November,
 with a Fleet of 20 sail of Men of War, and a great Number of Merchant Ships, accompanied with the Vice-Admiral's 
Evertsz
 and 
Meppel. De Ruiter
 then being left in the North, to Com∣mand in chief in the absence of the Lieutenant Admiral, joyned his Fleet with that of the 
Danes,
 Commanded by Admiral 
Bielke,
 and having ta∣ken on board, a good Number of Troops, both Horse and Foot, steer'd directly towards the Isle of 
Funen.
 To attempt a descent there, and if it were possible, to drive out the 
Swedes
 from thence. On the 8th. of 
November,
 he advanc'd as far as before the Town of 
Nyburg,
 situated in the East part of 
Funen,
 upon the 
Belt.
 Tho a great body of 
Swedish
 Horse appeared upon the Coast to oppose a descent, yet Marshal 
Schak
 and other General Officers resolved to fall upon them, notwithstanding the night was coming on. But that Undertaking was not so well backt as it should have been, because there was no body that was well acquainted with that place. In the mean while, the 
Swedes
 having raised some batteries, begun to fire upon the 
Dutch
 Fleet, and they fired no less briskly a∣gain upon the 
Swedes,
 and upon the Ramparts of 
Nyburg.
 The next morning before day, the Officers, Soldiers, and Seamen that had passed the night in Boats, and suffered much by the cold, came back again on board the Fleet, with∣out having done any thing, because it was so very dark that they could not see the Coast. After this attempt, the General Officers resol∣ved to weigh Anchor, and to draw towards 
Kor∣temunde,
 another Town in the same Isle, where they arrived on the 10th. about noon.




De Ruiter
 thereupon, gave order immediately to 
Evertsz, de Wilde,
 to Rear Admiral 
B
akel,
 and to the Captains, 
Van Amst
l,
 and 
Aldert Machysz,
 to joyn him, and to draw up in a line of Battle, in Order to Batter the Town with their Artillery, so that soon after, it was seen all in flames, and the Swedish Horse was forc'd to scamper here and there, not knowing where to shelter themselves. 
De Ru
ter
 observing that disorder, without losing any time, posted 4 men of War more in such a manner, that their guns swept all the plain Country clear, and gall'd the Flank of the Swedish Cavalry. In the mean time the Danish Admiral 
Bielke,
 and Vice Admiral 
Held
 coming to 
de Ruiter,
 prayed him to be pleased to go to Marshal 
Schak,
 to endeavour to perswade him, upon that fair opportunity, to put in Execution without delay, the descent he be∣fore had designed to make, because it was alrea∣dy 2 a Clock in the Afternoon. After several deliberations, the 
Danish
 and 
Holland
 Troops chosen to form the Van guard, entred into Boats, which landed them within Pistol shot of the Town Bridge. The 
Swedes
 had retrenched them∣selves in two different places and had raised Forts from the Town to the Bridge, having po∣sted on one side, 2 Regiments of Horse, and on the other 3. Whilst the Dragoons were left in the Town, to defend that. At the approach of the 
Danes,
 the 
Swedes
 fired hotly upon the Boats, and killed some of the 
Hollanders. De Ruiter
 being in Person in one of those Boats, seeing the danger, cried out? 
My Boys; Have Courage, advance, and march up to the Enemies: Or else you are all lost men!
 That discourse so extream∣ly revived the fallen Courages of his followers, that a 
French
 Gentleman, named 
Fleury de Cu∣san,
 Lord of 
Buat,
 and Captain of a Troop of Horse in the States service, who came in the Fleet in Quality of a Volunteer, hearing those

 words of 
de Ruiter,
 leapt presently out of the Boat with his drawn Sword in his hand into the Sea up to the middle in Water, crying out, 
Friends, fol
ow me!
 Upon which, the Soldiers and Mariners being ashamed not to follow his Ex∣ample, leapt out likewise in Troops, and got to Land, whilst the Men of War fired without in∣termission upon the Town; so that advancing fur∣ther, the Confederate Troops vigorously attackt the Swedish Horse, who came to meet them to dispute their passage. There was never any thing more bloody than that shock, nor was there ever any Courage appear'd so undaunted as that shewn by the Allies in that Rencoun∣ter; so that the 
Swedes
 being no longer able to endure so fierce and obstinate an attack, quit∣ted their ground, and retired in Confusion to∣wards the Bridge. But the 
Danes
 and 
Holland∣ers
 pursued them so close, that they entred with them into the Town, set it on fire in two pla∣ces, and then quitted it again. However, the fire did no great damage, because it was quick∣ly quench'd by the diligence of the Enemies. The day following 
de Ruiter
 detacht away 4 men of War, to go and cruize between the Isles of 
Langeland,
 and 
Spro,
 and 3 more, to go and block up the passages of 
Nyburg,
 in Order to prevent the 
Swedes
 from putting any succours into 
Fu∣nen.
 In the mean while, a part of the 
Danish
 Horse had already begun to disembark, and the next day, they all Landed.


Some days before the descent, King 
Gustavus Adolphus
 had entred the Isle of 
Falster,
 at the head of a Body of Horse, to encourage his Troops by his presence, and defend the Neigh∣bouring Isles from the Irruption of the 
Danes;
 and before his departure, he seemed to the Am∣bassadors to be more inclinable to a Peace than before. But all those fair appearances were but the pure effects of a dissembling Policy that in∣duced

 him to make all those advances, to gain time, and to prevent the mischiefs threatned him by the Junction of the 
Danish
 and 
Dutch
 Fleets; so that he was extreamly surprised, when he was infor∣med a little while after, that the two Fleets were already at Sea. Upon that news, he hastned a∣way with all speed to 
Kotfoot,
 with a full Re∣solution, to throw succours into 
Funen,
 where he foresaw, the Enemies designed to make a De∣scent. But the Confederate Fleets having pre∣vented his vigilance, he was much astonish'd to hear at his arrival, the Extraordinary noise of Cannon and small Arms, which put him into such a Transport of fury, that he Resolved to go immediately in Person into 
Funen,
 to rouse up the drooping courage of his men, and thereby prevent a blow that was likely to Ruine his fairest hopes, and cut short the swift Career of his Conquests. But his Council more wise and Considerate than he, disswaded him from it, by Representing to him, to what great and inevita∣ble danger he would thereby expose himself, since there being no other way for him to pass into 
Funen,
 but in a pitiful sorry boat, in which he could hardly without a Miracle escape being taken by his Enemies. Having therefore chang'd his resolution, he only sent thither General 
Steen∣bok,
 who arrived there time enough to be a Spectator of the misfortune of his Party, and to bear a share in the total defeat of the 
Swedish
 Army.


In the mean while, the 
Hollanders
 and the 
Danes,
 seeing Fortune begun to declare for them, resolved, without any demurring, to push on their Enter∣prizes to the utmost, while Time was, and to pre∣vent the Winter, which would soon disable their Fleets from staying any longer at Sea. General 
Ernest Albert de Eberstein
 was arrived at the Ar∣my of the Allies, ever since the 14th of the same Month, with a Reinforcement of 4 
German
 Regi∣ments,

 4 more of 
Brandenburghers,
 800 
Polanders,
 and 1000 
Danish
 Horse, besides Foot; he had landed near 
Middlelvaart,
 in the Isle of 
Funen,
 and two Days after his Arrival, he joyned General 
Schak,
 near 
Odenzee.
 On the 22d the 
Danish
 Ar∣my, with all those Auxiliary Troops, advanced within a Mile of 
Nyburg,
 where they arrived about 11 a Clock, and discovered the 
Sweedish
 Ar∣my, under the Command of the Prince of 
Sults∣back,
 and General 
Steenbok,
 ready ranged in Or∣der of Battle, upon the side of a Mountain, in a very advantagious Place for them, since they had the Town of 
Nyburg
 behind them, and tall Hedges, and a large deep Ditch before them, which they had thick lined with Musqueteers and Dragoons, well retrencht. However, the 
Danes,
 put them∣selves likewise in Order of Battle. General 
Eber∣stein
 commanded the Right wing, Marshal 
Tramp
 the left, and General 
Schak
 the Main Battle, where were placed the 
Dutch
 Colonels, 
Killigrew, Kuik, Meteren,
 and 
Ailua,
 with their Troops. The Fight was begun by the 
Danish
 Horse; for 
Eberstein
 and 
Schak
 fell with all the Vigour imaginable upon the Enemies, and broke through them, as far as the Hedges; but there they found so much Resi∣stance from the 
Swedish
 Musqueteers and Dragoons, that it was impossible for them to get any further: For the 
Swedes,
 adding Desperation to their natural Bravery, not only repulsed their Enemies, but put them into such disorder, that both the Right and Left Wing of their Army began to give way; and further, they made themselves Masters of some of their Cannon; upon which 
Schak,
 having sent Order to the 
Dutch
 to come up and charge, the Colonels, 
Killigrew, Meteren
 and 
Ailua,
 putting themselves at the Head of them, led them up, charging them to keep close together; the Right Wing of the 
Swedes
 did their utmost to break them, but the Pikes having repulsed them, they were forced, in a few Moments after, to quit their

 Post and their Cannon, and betake themselves to Flight. The right Wing of the 
Swedes,
 having been thus driven out of the Field, the 
Hollanders
 fell upon the Left, which they likewise broke, so that the Victory, which seemed at first to have de∣clared for the 
Swedes,
 then forsook them. Upon which, the 
Imperial
sts, Brandenburgers, Danes,
 and 
Polanders,
 taking Advantage of that Defeat, charged the 
Swedish
 Horse with so much Vigor, that they forced them to retire into 
Nyburg,
 so that their Foot being deserted by the Horse, was surrounded by the 
Polanders,
 who cut them almost all in pieces. The Prince of 
Sultsbach,
 and Gene∣ral 
Steenbok,
 seeing the Fortune of the Day lost, being loth to coop themselves up in 
Nyburg,
 fled through a Wood towards the Sea-coast; where, finding a Fisher-boat, by vertue of large Offers of Mony, they persuaded the Master of it to pass them over the Night following into 
Zealand,
 ac∣companied only with two or three Servants.


Whilst the Land-Army of the Allies was en∣gaged with the 
Swedes,
 General 
Sohak
 sent to in∣treat 
de Ruiter,
 to advance with his Fleet before 
Nyburg,
 in order to besiege it by Sea, in case the Allies proved victorious by Land. The 25th of the same Month, the 
Swedes,
 having been constrained to quit the Fort 
Knotshover,
 because it was laid flat by 
de Ru
ter
's Guns, some Men of War of the Fleet went and anchored so near the Town, that they could make th
 least Guns they had bear to fire into it with effectual Execution: And the whole Fleet, being thrown into a Line of Battle, fired 
o furiously into it, with all their Guns, that so many Houses were beaten down by them, that the 
Swedish
 Horse and other Soldiers that were retired thither, knew not where to fly for Shelter; and that small Place was soon reduced to Ashes, by the continual Broad-sides that flew from the Navy, that swept away Men, Women and Horses, and made the Air most dreadfully echo with the lamen∣table

 Cries of an infinite number of wounded Peo∣ple; and the Desolation was so great and so uni∣versal, that very few Persons could escape from it. The 
Swedes
 therefore, having lost all Hopes of be∣ing able to defend the Place any longer, sent a Trum∣peter to the Generals 
Schak
 and 
Eberstein,
 to let them know, They were ready to capitulate, and to desire them to give order for the Cannon to cease Firing. But they replied, They must expect no other Accommodation from them, but to surrender themselves at Discretion. In the mean while, the Cannon played upon them without Intermission, and a little while after, three 
Swedish
 Lords came out to the Camp, with Offers to yield at Discre∣tion. Whereupon, the Allies named the Sieurs 
Alefeld
 and 
Tromp
 to go on their part into the Town, to treat with the 
Swedish
 Generals, and a Trumpeter was sent on board 
de Ruiter,
 to desire him to intermit Firing, in regard the besieged were treating to surrender at Discretion. 
De Rui∣ter
 answered, That they must resolve to do it out of hand then, or else he would reduce the Town to a Heap of Rubbish. Those Words were fol∣lowed with a short Cessation of Arms; but be∣cause the besieged made some Demur in coming to an Execution of all those Offers, 
de Ruiter
 fired upon them again more fiercely than ever, till by a Letter from General 
Schak,
 he was informed, That the 
Swedes,
 had at last submitted to the Clemency of the Victors, and that the Allies were infinitely obliged to him for having brought things in so short a time, to so happy an Issue. Twelve Regiments of 
Swedish
 Horse, making in all 3000 Men, were made Prisoners of War on this occasion. The Pri∣soners of note, were 12 Colonels, and the Majors General 
Horn, Weyer
 and 
Waldeck;
 and the Duke of 
Weymeren,
 and the Count 
Coningsmark,
 were taken Prisoners in the Battle. That Victory was so compleat, that there never was its parallel known, since of all the whole 
Swedish
 Army in

 the Isle of 
Funen,
 consisting of above 7000 Fight∣ing Men, there escaped but two General Officers, and some few Private Soldiers, that saved them∣selves in the Woods, when they were defeated. And besides, it's worth remark, That those Troops, so defeated, were the Bravest, most Faithful, and most Veteran, and Disciplined Soldiers of all the Forces of the King of 
Swedeland.
 On the 
Danes
 and Allies side, there were about 500 Men killed, among whom were reckoned 8 Officers of note, among whom was Captain 
Hemmema.
 The 
Hol∣landers
 lost very few, tho' they bore the greatest brunt of the Battle. All those happy Progresses were followed by the speedy reduction of the greatest of the 
Danish
 Isles, except 
Zeeland,
 to that before oppressed Crown, and that in less than 16 Days. Near 100 Pieces of Cannon, and great store of Ammunition were taken, and 120 Stan∣dards or Colours. About 2000 
Swedes
 were kill'd, and 5000 made Prisoners. As for the Cavalry that were taken, they were part of them distributed among the 
Danish, Imperial
 and 
Brandenburg
 Horse. The Town of 
Nyburg
 was plundered by the 
Imperialists
 and 
Poles,
 whilst the 
Hollanders
 kept still under Arms.


Funen
 being thus reduced under the Obedience of its rightful Prince, Vice-Admiral 
De Ruiter
 represented to General 
Schak,
 That it was impossi∣ble for the Fleet to subsist any longer in those parts, because of the Dearness of Provisions; adding, That the swift advance of the Winter obliged him likewise to retire. And, accordingly unmooring, on the 28th of 
November,
 he sailed away to 
Lu∣beck,
 with a Fleet of 120 Sail, great and small, to take in a Supply of Provisions. The News of so many Advantages, gained by the Arms of the Con∣federates, was like a stroke of Thunder to King 
Gustavus;
 for, after that Time, he gave himself so much to Melancholy, that he was never after seen in a good Humor: Nay, his Health was sen∣sibly

 endamaged thereby. He retired into the Castle of 
Knonenburg;
 where Reflecting upon the declining Condition of his Affairs, he judged there was no other way for him to take to retrieve them, than to reconcile himself with the 
Ʋnited Provin∣ces,
 as the only Power that had broke his Designs, and interrupted the Course of his Conquests. And so earnestly did he prosecute that expedient, that on the 9th of 
December,
 that is to say, fifteen Days after the Reduction of 
Nyburg,
 the Treaty of Alliance between 
Swedeland
 and the States was renewed, and signed by the Ambassadors of both Powers; which Treaty was followed with the Conclusion of the Project, formed before at 
Elbing
 with all its Dependencies; with this provisional Condition, That the abovesaid Treaty should be of no Validity▪ and should not be put in execution till a Peace were first made and ratified between the two Crowns of 
Sweden
 and 
Denmark.
 Such were the first Fruits of the Conquest of the Isle of 
Funen.


The 1st of 
December, De Ruiter,
 having Or∣ders from the States to winter in the 
Baltick,
 in order to take care to secure 
Copenhagen,
 came to an Anchor in the Road of 
Trave-Munde,
 from whence he sailed next Day to 
Lubeck;
 where he took in Provisions. On the 15th he steered away for 
Co∣penhagen,
 where Admiral 
Bielk,
 coming on board him, presented him with a Golden Chain and a Medal of great Value, from the King of 
Den∣mark.
 The King of 
Sweden
 having still considera∣ble Forces in the Isle of 
Zeeland,
 the 
Danes
 had some reason to fear some Irruption from them, when the Time of the Ice should come; so that they reinforced the Garrison of 
Copenhagen,
 and plant∣ed a greater Number of Guns upon the Ramparts of the Town; and every Captain had his parti∣cular Quarter assigned him, that they might be ready to oppose any Assaults from the 
Swedes;
 The Ice was broke for 40 Foot round every Man of

 War; and the 
Danes,
 in the mean time, making several Sallies against the Enemies, gained conside∣rable Advantages over them.


This was the state of the War in the North, when 
de Ruiter,
 at the beginning of the following Spring, having unmoored from 
Copenhagen,
 on the 3d of 
March,
 1660. went and posted himself, with his Fleet before the Haven of 
Landskroon,
 to block up its Passage, and hinder the coming out of the 
Swedish
 Fleet, which was then about 50 Sail strong of Men of War. He had likewise at the same time detached from his Fleet a Squadron of 16 Men of War, to convoy home some Merchant-ships to 
Holland.
 Amidst those Transactions he heard the News of the Death of 
Charles Gustavus,
 King of 
Sweden;
 which happened on the 23d of 
February
 at 
Gottenburg,
 a violent Distemper, of not above 6 Days continuance, having carried him off, in the 36th Year of his Age. The unexpected Death of that great Prince revived the Hopes and raised the palled Courage of the 
Danes,
 who, not without sufficient Cause, looked on him as the Scourge of their Nation, by reason of his extra∣ordinary Valour and Success.


In the mean while the Negotiation for a Peace, which the Plenipotentiaries of th
 mediating Pow∣ers were endeavouring, was drilled on to a tedious length, notwithstanding the frequent Conferences they had about it in the Tent, erected for that effect between 
Copenhagen
 and the 
Swedish
 Army; which Delay was caused by the Intrigues of the 
French
 and 
English
 Ambassadours at the Court of 
Swedeland;
 for that they were so far from endea∣vouring heartily to bring that Power to an Accom∣modation, that underhand they blew the Coals, and exasperated Matters, by luring on that Court with the Airy Hopes of several Conquests. But, However, at last, after many Obstacles, it was happily concluded on the 6th of 
June.
 And four

 days after, the 
Swedish
 Army raised the Siege of 
Copenhagen;
 and the two Northern Crowns there∣by put an end to those Troubles that seemed to have rendred them irreconcilable, and that had kindled the Jealousie, and raised the Arms of so many Princes against the growing Power of 
Swede∣land.


The States seeing Affairs were happily terminat∣ed on that side, sent Orders to 
de Ruiter,
 that as soon as the 
Swedes
 should have restored to 
Den∣mark
 all the Places they were obliged to restore by the Treaty, he should re-imbark the States Troops, and return back with his Navy to 
Hol∣land.
 But the King of 
Denmark,
 considering the great Service he had received from 
de Ruiter,
 not willing to let him depart, without giving him some Marks of his Acknowledgment, would needs honour him with the Order of Knighthood, for him and his heirs, and with Letters of No∣bility, to which he added an annual Pension of 800 Crowns. 
Pulchler
 likewise who Com∣manded the Land Forces, was gratified with an annual Pension, a Golden Chain, and a Me∣dal. And the other Officers received also every one presents proportionable to their rank, and the merit of their Services.


The War the United Provinces had with 
Por∣tugal,
 
 which we have already mentioned, was also terminated by a Treaty signed the 6th. of 
August,
 to the extreme displeasure of the Pri∣vateers of several Nations that made use of the Commissions of that Crown the more secure∣ly to go a Pyrating after the 
Dutch
 Merchant Ships.


In the mean time, the Corsairs of 
Barbary
 did so much mischief in the 
Mediterranean,
 
 that the States were forced to send thither Vice-Admiral 
de Ruiter
 with a Fleet of about 20 men of War.

 For about the space of 6 Weeks, he only sail∣ed about the 
Mediterranean,
 Convoying Mer∣chant Ships, without discovering any Pyrate, but on the 26th. of 
February
 he gave chace to a Corsair Ship of 
Tunis,
 called the 
Crescent,
 and forcing her to run a ground upon the Coast, he delivered 40 Christian slaves.


Two days after, he went and Anchored before 
Tunis,
 where he Concluded a Treaty of Peace between the United Provinces, and those 
Bar∣barians,
 and delivered 60 
Dutch
 slaves more, who were Exchanged for the 
Turks
 taken in the Corsair called the 
Crescent,
 which he had lately taken. But because there were some Articles in that Treaty that displeased the States, 
de Rui∣ter,
 at his return to the Coasts of 
Barbary
 in 
November
 following, caused them to be alter∣ed.


There was likewise a Treaty of Peace Conclu∣ded with the 
Algerines
 about the end of the Month of 
March,
 in which likewise some change was made by the consent of those Corsairs; but they soon after broke it.


 
 Rear-Admiral 
Tromp
 and Captain 
Schey
 had like∣wise orders to go into the 
Mediterranean,
 with a Fleet of 10 Merchant Ships; and on the 1st. day of 
January
 1663, the two Fleets having met and saluted one another, 
De Ruiter
 steer'd towards 
A∣licant,
 and 
Tromp
 towards 
Leghorn.
 Some weeks after, namely on the 17th of 
March, de Ruiter
 having receiv'd order from the States, to leave the Command of the Fleet that was to stay in the 
Mediterranean,
 to 
Tromp,
 and to return back himself into 
Holland,
 accordingly left it to him, together with the necessary instructions relating to what remained yet to be put in Execution; and at the same time put on Board of 
Tromp
 the Fiscal 
Vyant,
 who had assisted at all the Treaties that had been made with the 
Turks,
 that he might

 serve him for his Counsel. But instead of being a∣ble to pacifie the turbulent humour of those 
Bar∣barians;
 the 
Algerine
 grew thereupon the more insolent. For because the Ratification of the Trea∣ty was not presently sent them, and that several months had past, without their seeing either any one Dutch Man of War, or the promised ransome for the Slaves of that Nation, they began to grow so much the more impatient, because the Plague that then raged among them, sweeping away many of the 
Dutch
 Slaves, deprived thereby their greedy Patrons of their Ransom too; So that the mur∣murs of those discontented 
Barbarians,
 soon after broke out in new Hostilities. For at the beginning of the Summer, they took upon them to visit the 
Dutch
 Merchant Ships, and then under pretence they were laden with Merchandises belonging to their Enemies, they pillaged them without Con∣troul. And not long after they carried a Dutch Merchant Ship to 
Algiers,
 confiscated her Cargo, and sold her Men for Slaves. The States hear∣ing of all these mischiefs Writ to their Consul there, 
Vanden Burg,
 to sollicit the Restitution of the Effects that were seiz'd, and the Liberty of the Slaves those 
Barbarians
 had newly made; But the 
Corsairs
 refusing to give any satisfaction, the States gave Orders, they should be obliged to it by force of Arms.


Rear-Admiral 
Tromp
 therefore having begun to give them Chace, took several of them, 
 and freed thereby a great number of 
Christian Slaves.
 And a∣mong others, he took two 
Algerine Corsairs
 on the 10th of 
January,
 near 
Malaga,
 whereof one carried 18, and the other 20 Guns, and had on board her 180 
Turks
 or 
Moors,
 25 
Christian Slaves,
 and 5 Rene∣gadoes. These Prises caused great alarms at 
Algeirs,
 where the 
Barbarians
 gave out, that their losses in them amounted to the number of 6 or 700 
Turks, Moors
 or 
Renegadoes,
 for which they demanded Re∣paration

 of the 
Dutch
 Consul. Offering to make satisfaction for their own Hostilities; to Re-esta∣blish all things again upon a good Foot, and to break the Treaty Concluded with the 
English:
 They promised likewise, they would stay for the Money designed for the Ransoming of the Dutch Slaves, and demanded earnest for it, thinking it was not yet too late to obtain, a Ratification of the last Treaty of Peace. But the States being but too well acquainted with the Perfidiousness, and Inconstancy of those 
Barbarians,
 were so far from hearkning to them, that they sollicited the Kings of 
France, Spain
 and 
England,
 to joyn their Forces with those of the United Provinces, to Destroy them; since they exercised their Piracies no less upon the Subjects of those Crowns, than upon those of the United Provinces. And the States would fain have perswaded those Powers to have set out three several Fleets, under the Flagg of each Nation, to go and Besiege their Harbours, Chace them from the Sea, and utterly ruine their abomi∣nable and insupportable Domination, without ha∣ving any regard to any former Treaty of Peace or Alliance. Which Project seemed very important and well contrived: But yet not one of those three Princes could be perswaded to hearken to it.


The 
French
 King indeed highly praised it, and gave leave to the Dutch to erect Magazines for that effect, both of Provisions and Ammunition, at 
Thoulon,
 or 
Marseilles.
 The King of 
Spain
 gave Order, that the Dutch Men of War might have free Ingress and Egress in and out of his Ports: And the King of Great 
Britain
 resolved to send a Fleet into the 
Mediterranean,
 but it was more, to give new Umbrages than to correspond with the design of the States, and many already could see in the shuffling conduct of that Prince, certain pre∣sages of an approaching Rupture of the Peace be∣tween him and the United Provinces. For at the same time that he proposed to send a Fleet into the

 
Mediterranean,
 to act in concert with that of the States, he had on the other side given private order to Captain 
Holms
 to sail to the Court of 
Africa
 to ruin there the Commerce of the Dutch 
West-Indian
 Company, and to seze their ships and Forts. The States therefore seeing there was little Reliance to be made upon the assistance of any of all those Fo∣regin Powers, in order to free the Sea from the intolerable Robberies of the 
Algerines,
 Resolved to concern themselves no further than for the pre∣servation of their own Subjects, by sending ano∣ther Fleet into the 
Mediterranean,
 under the Con∣duct of 
de Ruiter,
 because Rear-Admiral 
Tromp
 had not sufficient Forces to accomplish so great an Enterprise. That Fleet was composed of 12 Ships of War, and one Flute laden with Provisions.


They put to Sea about the beginning of 
May,
 and on the 19th of 
June,
 arrived in the Road of 
Algiers. De Ruiter
 presently sent notice of his ar∣rival to the 
Divan,
 to remind them to pay him the usual Honours, and to Congratulate his arrival. But they were so far from acquitting themselves of the Duty he pretended from them, that they refu∣sed to let the Dutch Consul come on board to speak with the Vice-Admiral, and to send Hostages for the security of the Credential Letters, which were to be presented to the 
Divan
 from the States; for all they would do, was only to Grant a Pass∣port by vertue of which the Commissioners, 
Mortaigne,
 and 
Reyn
ld de Koeverden
 went in∣to the Town: who in the first Audience they had, demand the exchange of Prisoners, and the re∣lease of the 
Christian Slaves
 at the rate they were first sold for, according to the Conditions of the last Treaty of Peace, adding that as for other differences, they should be adjusted by the Com∣missioners to be appointed for that purpose on each side. All which was refused by the 
Divan,
 who pretended, before they entered into any Confe∣rence about the Release of Prisoners, to know

 upon what grounds they might be assured of a Peace. 
De Ruiter
 upon that, sent them a Memorial that made a great noise amongst those 
Barbarians,
 because they would by no means consent to any indemnification, nor to the Condition in∣sisted upon by the 
Dutch
 that no free Ship should be liable to be visited, which was the Griev∣ance of the 
Hollanders.
 So that that point was hotly disputed on both sides in the 
Divan;
 But after all, the 
Algerines
 were obstinate, and would absolutely reserve themselves a pow∣er, to visit all 
Dutch
 Ships, and to declare for Lawful Prize all the effects they found in them to belong to other Nations. In fine, the Con∣clusion of the Negotiation was this, That those 
Barbarians,
 declared to 
de Ruiter,
 that if he would not accept their propositions, he would not permit the 
Dutch
 Consul to retire on board him, till he had before hand sent on shore 37 
Turks
 or 
Moors
 that were Prisoners in his Fleet. Which demand of theirs he thought fit to grant, to prevent the mischiefs that might o∣therwise happen to the 
Dutch
 Consul and his Retinue, of which he had a fresh Example in the Person of the 
English
 Consul whom those Pyrates had cruelly handled, after they had bro∣ken the Peace with 
England.


De Ruiter
 therefore plainly finding, that it was to no purpose to use any gentle methods with them, Ju
g
d there was no other way to be taken, but to reduce the 
Algerines
 to reason by force of Arms, and accordingly he declared War against them the 4th. of 
June.


The next day, the Fleet unmoored, and went and Anchored on the 7th of the same Month at 
Alicant,
 where 
de Ruiter
 Received a Letter with advice of the new Troubles that Threatned the United Provinces from the 
English
 and with or∣ders to him, to u
e great Prudence and such Complaisant measures with the Ships of War

 that Crown had in the Mediterranean as to give them no new causes of Umbrage or dissatisfa∣ction. And accordingly there were no Acts of Hostility Committed between them at that time, but when the Captains of both Nations met, they Reciprocally saluted one another with some Guns in a very amicable manner; whilst the main Body of the English Fleet consisting of 13 sail of Men of War under the Command of Admiral 
Lawson
 kept at the Mouth of the Straits.


Scarcely had 
England
 and 
Holland
 begun to tast of the fruits of Peace which had cost so much Blood to the two Nations, but it was disturbed again by new Hostilities as the 
Dutch
 pretend begun by the 
English,
 out of Jealousie at the flourishing Commerce, and great prospe∣rity of the United Provinces, which prepared for 
de Ruiter,
 who was then busie in scouring the 
Medi∣terranean
 of the Corsairs, new work in the O∣cean, whither Rear-Admiral 
Tromp
 was already returned. In the Months of 
May
 and 
June,
 news came to 
Holland,
 that the 
English
 under the Com∣mand of 
Robert Holms,
 Committed strange de∣predations towards the Isles of 
Cape Verd;
 and that in 
January
 before, they had taken a Ship called the 
Spectacles,
 and a Yacht, called the 
Neptune,
 which belonged to the 
Dutch West-India
 Company. The 
English
 Ship that took the 
Nep∣tune,
 the better to deceive those she had a mind to attack, put up 
Dutch
 Colours. The same advices likewise reported, that 
Holms
 had on the 31st. of the same Month, summoned the Fort of 
Cape Verd
 situated in the Isle of 
Goe-rede,
 and that upon the Governours refusal to surrender it, the 
English
 had by their Cannon forced him to yield it, and had at the same time taken ano∣ther Yacht called the 
Crocodile;
 that the E∣vening before, they had taken two other small Ships. That 
Holms
 had at first, promised the

 Subjects of the 
Dutch
 Company which were a∣bout 140 men, to restore them the Ship called the 
Moon,
 to serve to transport them back into their own Country, but that having seen a great quantity of Merchandizes, put on board it for 
Holland,
 he changed his mind, and told them, he had occasion for that Ship himself, to trans∣port his own Goods to 
Sie
ra Lions;
 But that however, at last he had granted them a 
Portu∣guese
 Ship for their transportation: That in the Month of 
July,
 the States had other fresher news, concerning the Hostilities Committed on the Coast of 
Guinea,
 where Captain 
Holms,
 with a Squadron of 14 English men of War, had seiz'd all the places and Forts belonging to the 
Hol∣landers,
 except the Castle 
del Mina,
 exercising all manner of Cruelties towards the Men, as they pretended to make appear by the following Let∣ter written from the Castle 
del Mina,
 by Gene∣ral 
Valkenburg.


Ever since the 
English
 have endeavoured to establish the Royal Company upon this Coast, they have not only troubled themselves no further to contribute to the preservation of the Peace be∣fore Concluded, but they have proceeded to cruel Hosti∣lities by Sea and Land against all of our Nation, and to drive at the utter ruin of our Commerce. Those Fatal attempts begun by the arrival of two of the King of 
England
's men of War, and some others belonging to the Royal Company, under the Command of 
John Stoats,
 who being overcome with the great honour and beneficial civilities done him by the 
Hollanders,
 could not find in his heart to execute any thing against them. But they stopt not there, for on the last day of April, there ap∣peared a Squadron of 
2
 men of War and 
6
 Fri∣gats, under Captain Holms
's
 Flag, and that of one 
Joseph Cubits,
 who being afterwards Reinforced to the Number of 
14
 men of War, have commited in

 the midst of Peace all the Acts of Hostility they could have committed in the middle of a Decla∣red War, attacking both by Sea and Land, our places, and taking from us by Force, the Fortres∣ses, 
Tacorari, Cabo-Cors, Adia,
 and 
Ameabo.
 They have also besieged 
Chama,
 and keep us here blockt up so close that very hardly can we find means to send you a Letter. The losses caused to the Company thereby, amount to several Tuns of Gold; And as to the Persons of the 
Hollanders,
 especially those of 
Adia,
 after they had given them quarter, they have treated them with all the ri∣gour and barbarity Imaginable, cutting off their Noses and Ears, to leave them afterwards to ling∣er out a miserable and languishing life; and others throats they have cut, as if they had been so ma∣ny beasts. The dead Bodies that were buried in the Earth which God and Nature had allotted them to enjoy repose and silence in, have been pull'd out of their Graves, and their heads cut off and fixt on Pikes tops as 'twere in Triumph. And those who were dying, or already dead, had their Privy Members, Heads, Arms, and Legs, cut off, and by an Excess of cruelty some had their Hearts pull
d out. The Prisoners were most unmercifully treated with design to make them Perjure themselves. The 
English
 have continued all these cruelties to this very day, and say they still expect another Reinforcement of 
6
 great men of War to drive the 
Hollanders
 from this Coast. Our men are still more severely handled by the Natives of the Country who usually fol∣low the Victorious Party. The 
English
 assure us, we shall receive no succour, and scatter abroad writings by which they promise a recompense to al that shall embrace their Party. We will endea-l vour in so fatal a conjuncture, honourably to defend the place, in hopes to receive a considerable suc∣cour from the Ʋnited Provinces, by the means of which all things may be re-established.




This Letter was printed by the States Order, and Copies of it sent to all Ships of War, and to all Frontier places that had Garrisons in them. However, supposing all that dreadful Relation true to a Letter, the 
English
 could cite for their excuse the precedent set them before by the 
Dutch
 at 
Amboyna.
 But the truth was ma∣ny had been the wrongs the 
English
 pretended to have suffered both in persons and effects from the 
Hollanders
 in several parts of the World, for which having often demanded and received no satisfaction, they proceed
d to reprisals which occasioned some Foreign Emissaries and Incendi∣aries, common Enemies to b
th Nations, greedi∣ly laying hold of, used all the little Arts and Tricks imaginable to represent all that was done on either side tho' never so trivial, in the most dreadfull Colours on purpose to exasperate the two Nations to worrie one another like Wild Beasts till they were able to stand no longer, that so a third might come in, and devour them both. For that the 
English
 set on by the same pernicious instruments were not a whit behind hand with the 
Dutch
 by rendering them as O∣dious on the other side by writings and mani∣festo's stuffed with no less specious Complaints, appears by the following Remonstrances presen∣ted against the 
Hollanders,
 to the 
English
 Par∣liament, and by the Parliament presented to the King: Which we have likewise inserted, that the Reader might see what each party had to say, and did actually alledge for them∣selves.








The Complaints of the 
English East-India
 Com∣pany against the 
Dutch,
 set forth,


I.
 THAT the 
English East-India
 Company strongly insist, to have an Indemnification for all the Damages they have suffered ever since the Year 
1656.
 valued at 
14008000 l.
 for the Ships and Effects taken from them by the 
Dutch,
 and 
87000 l.
 for the Losses they have suffered, according to a modest and just Supputation that had been made of them, with respect to their Factories, that have been burnt or destroyed by the same 
Hollanders;
 most of which had happened since the glorious Re∣storation of his Majesty. That they complained likewise, That the Isle of 
Poleron
 had been possessed by the 
Dutch
 for the space of 
42
 Years, against all sort of Justice, since the States had no lawful Right to it, and had consented in the Treaties that had been made with them, to restore it, and yet persisted to keep it by Force. They demand also, to be Reim∣bursed the Charges for the two Ships that were sent the Year, before to take Possession of the said Isle, which amounted to 
23000 l.


II.
 The said Company complains also of the indi∣rect means the 
Dutch
 use in the 
Indies,
 to interrupt their Commerce, by affecting to declare War against all those Places where the English settle any Factors for carrying on their Traffick; and that under Pre∣tence of that Declaration, they send Ships to an∣chor before those Places, only with pure Design to destroy the Commerce of the 
English,
 of whom they are extremely jealous; so that the Declaration of War against those Places, is but a meer Juggle, by which the 
English
 really suffer.


III.
 That under Pretence of having made an Agreement with the Kings of those Countries about the principal Commodities of them, they disturb the Commerce of the 
English,
 and fire upon their Boats

 that Approach the Coast; telling them, to excuse themselves from Blame, That they have already bought up all the Commodities; when there is no∣thing so false.


IV.
 That when those Artifices fail them, they put an Arrest upon the 
English
 Ships, both great and small, as is practised among Enemies.


V.
 That they affect to publish aloud, That they are Sovereigns of the 
Indian-Sea,
 and so under the Shadow of an Imaginary Dominion, affront the Ban∣ner of 
England,
 to the great Contempt of his Ma∣jesty and dishonour of the Nation.






The 
Turky Company
 complain,


That since the Restoration of his Majesty, the 
Hollanders
 have taken from their Merchants two Ships, valued at 
110500 l.
 under Pretence of Letters of Reprisal from the King of 
Spain;
 and that af∣ter the said Letters Patents have been recalled by the King of 
Spain,
 in consequence of a renewing of Alliance between the two Crowns: And that the Man of War that took them was both built and equipped in 
Holland.






The Royal Company of 
Guiney
 represent,


I.
 That the 
Hollanders
 had done all they could, to drive their Merchants out of the Coasts of 
Africk;
 that they likewise endeavour to destroy their Com∣merce, by chasing their Ships from one Harbour to another, to interrupt their Traffick with the 
Ne∣groes.


II.
 They have persuaded the 
Negroes,
 to destroy their Slaves and Forts.


III.
 They have seized & arrested their Effects and their Barks.


IV.
 They have seized upon the Fort 
Cabo-Cors,
 of which they are still in Possession, tho it of right belongs to the 
English.




V.
 That they have fired upon his Majesty's Flag, even then when they had no other Design but to put our Merchants and their People on Shore, to go to our Factories.


VI.
 That they have twice sent their Protestations to the 
English,
 to advertise them to offer to sell no more of their Commodities on that Coast; and if they refused, to threaten them, They would proceed to Hostilities, and declare the 
English
 to be the Au∣thors of the War.






The Merchants trading to 
Portugal,
 complain,


That a 
Dutch
 Man of War, called, 
The Sluis van Ulissingen,
 had attaqued and seised 
The Brasi∣lian Frigat,
 belonging to them, valued at 
16000 l.






The Merchants of the 
Royal African Company
 complain,


That the Losses, they had suffered from the 
Dutch,
 amounted to at least 
33000 l.
 That several of their Ships had been burnt or sunk, and some taken, and that the Men of them had been either poysoned, or had had their Throats cut; that some of them having scaped the Rope, had been chaced, like mi∣serable Wretches, up and down the Coasts of 
Barba∣ry;
 four of which, by Divine Providence, got at last into 
England:
 And that two of these last had testified the same in 
Holland,
 and reproached them to the Face with it, who had so inhumanly treated them.


For which offences the 
Hollanders
 had never, to that present time, made any Reparation to the 
English,
 tho' all those hostile Attempts had been fully clear∣ed and proved, by Oaths made before the Admi∣ralty, and by the Complaints put up to the States by His Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary; who demanded, at the same time, satisfaction for them.








All which Losses, suffered by the 
East-India
 Compa∣ny, as well in Ships as Merchandises, amounts to the Sum of


258000 l.






For the 
Turky
 Company,


110500 l.






For the 
Portugal
 Merchants,


160000 l.






For the Private Merchants trading to the Coasts of 
Africk,


33000 l.






Besides the Losses of the Isle of 
Poleron,
 which, according to the just Estimation that had been made of them, amounted to above


4000000 l.










Whilst these things were transacting, Advice was sent, in a Letter, from
 England 
to
 Holland, 
to an eminent Person among the States, of all the Preparations of War that were making in that Kingdom; which Letter was conceived in these Terms.




EVer since the second of 
June,
 they have begun here, with all imaginable Diligence, to hasten the Equipment of the Navy. The King, and the Duke of 
York
 his Brother, have been in person, to visit the Ships in the 
Thames,
 giving Order, with all speed, to equip out those set down in the follow∣ing List. For that end, they have raised a great number of Mariners, Fishermen, Carpenters, and other Sea-faring Men, to be employed in working, without Intermission, in arming out the Fleet, of which the most considerable will most of them, be ready next Week, as tis believed. The Magazines are provided with all things. Those that are equip∣ping at 
Portsmouth
 advance likewise apace, and will be ready much about the same time. They have likewise begun this Week to kill Beasts, and press Men, 
n which they meet with no great Trouble, because of the Good-will of the Seamen to the Cause, who come in Troops to offer their Service; so that the sixt Number of 
10000
 Seamen will be soon compleat. They have also chosen 
25
 new Cap∣tains,

 without any distinction of Religion, they who have served under 
Cromwel,
 and are most of them 
Anabaptists
 or 
Presbyterians;
 they give out, That the Fleet will be composed of 
30
 Capital Ships of War, and that the rest shall be kept in Readiness, to be employed upon occasion, to form a second Fleet. They say, Prince 
Robert,
 the Duke of 
Albemarle,
 and the Earl of 
Sandwich
 are proposed for General Officers. The Ship that was designed to go and fetch the Earl of 
Carlisle
 from 
Stockholm,
 is counter∣manded, and is now with another Fregat at 
Tilbury-Hope,
 to stop all 
Dutch
 Seamen, and take the choic∣est of them to serve in his Majesty's Ships; as also the 
6
 Ships, of which I informed you in my last, which are equipt by the Royal Company. There is also at 
Portsmouth
 a King's Ship of 
36
 Guns rea∣dy to sail with the first fair Wind, hitherward, as is likewise another that is refitting. I am informed, That the 
Advice Yacht,
 that brought the News of the Surrender of 
Cape-Verd,
 has brought back the Governour of that Place, who is kept Prisoner some∣where in the Kingdom.




A List of the Ships that are equipping.


At
 Chatham, 
the
 Royal James, 
augmented with an Addition of several Guns, the
 Royal Prince, 
the
 Royal Charles, 
the
 London, Henry, Matthias, Dreadnought, Revenge, Portland, E∣lizabeth, Hampshire, Diamond, Ruby 
and
 Adven∣ture. 
These Capital Ships, the most of them carry∣ing
 3 
Tires of Guns, are equipping with all diligence. And, for want of Men they have taken a great many Watermen and Fishermen off of the River, and pressed Seamen to arm out the Ships, and pro∣vide them with all sorts of Ammunition and Provi∣sions. At
 Woolwich 
they are fitting out these Third Rate Ships,
 viz. 
the
 Dunkirk, 
the
 Henrietta, 
the
 Plymouth, 
the
 Crown, 
the
 Anne, 
and the
 As∣surance: 
And at
 Deptford, 
of the Fourth and Fifth Rates, the
 Convertine, 
the
 Pearl, 
the
 Dort∣muyen,

 
the
 Hector 
and the
 Dolphin. 
The most of these last have their Sails already spread, and their Guns ready, whilst they are working with all Dili∣gence in fitting out the rest.






Affairs being in that State, and the 
Ʋnited Pro∣vinces
 apprehending that all those Squablings would quickly break out into an open War with 
England,
 began to put all things in order: And it was re∣solved in the Assembly of the States, That No∣tice should be given to the Ships bound Westward, to go round about 
Scotland.
 The 
Zealanders
 like∣wise sent 2 nimble sailing Ships to 
Hitland,
 to give warning to the Ships belonging to the State, to avoid the Harbours of 
England,
 to prevent the falling of the Ships, coming back from the 
East-Indies,
 into the Hands of the 
English;
 and Rear-Admiral 
Tromp
 was sent out to Sea with a Fleet of 23 Men of War, to cruise for them, and to secure their Retreat home.


In the mean while, Mr. 
de Goch
 set out the 17th of 
June,
 in Quality of Ambassadour from the States, towards the Court of 
England,
 to endea∣vour amicably to appease and compose the Diffe∣rences that threatned the two Nations with a Rup∣ture. He arrived on the 22d at 
London,
 and was received by the Master of the Ceremonies, with great Marks of Friendship, and the very same Evening had Audience of his Majesty at 
White∣hall;
 and after the usual Compliments, their Dis∣course fell upon the Affairs that concerned the 
East
 and 
West-India
 Companies, upon which the King, among other Reasons, told him, 
That it was not to be suffered, That the 
DutchWest-India
 Company only by the means of a few Forts, and 3 or 4 Ships, without possessing elsewhere any Country within Land, should pretend to render the Coasts of 
Africk
 inaccessible to all others, by blocking up the Havens and the Mouths of the Rivers, against their Commerce, and keeping

 them off, and driving them away from every Place. The Ambassadour replied, 'That all the Difficulties about that Affair were terminated by the last Treaty; and that it ought to be examined whether the 
Dutch
 had done any thing in contra∣vention to it.
 After that he made his Complaints of the Hostile Attempts of Captain 
Holms,
 in 
Guiney:
 
To which the King made him the same Answer he had done before upon the like Subject, That he had not the least Knowledge of that, but that as soon as he should be informed of it, he would act as he found convenient.
 After which he begun to speak of the great Naval Preparations that were making in 
Holland.
 The States Ambas∣sadour justified himself, by answering, 
That those Preparations were chiefly for the great Con∣voys they were forced to allow their Merchant Ships, for the Security of their Commerce;
 pray∣ing his Majesty withal, 
That he would please to give order, as the States would likewise do, on their side, that nothing might pass between the two Fleets, that might disturb the Peace, or ali∣enate the good Correspondence settled between the two Nations.
 The next day Mr. 
de Goch,
 had Audience of the Duke of 
York,
 and in the Evening of the Chancellour; in which they dis∣coursed of nothing else but of the great Preparati∣ons for War, and of the Affairs of the 
East
 and 
West-India
 Companies. Some Time after, the States Ambassadour presented a Memorial concern∣ing the extraordinary Naval Preparations in 
Eng∣land,
 and about the Hostilities committed by Cap∣tain 
Holms,
 and the forbidding of the Importation of 
Dutch
 Commodities into the Kingdom, under the Pretence of the contagious Disease that then reigned in 
Holland.
 The King answered very largely to all those Points, in Writing; of which the Substance was, 
That he had no Design his Fleet should commit any Act of Hostility; That he had given no Order to Captain 
Holms
 to seise

 upon 
Cape-Verde,
 or any other Forts belonging to the 
Hollanders,
 nor to attempt any thing a∣gainst the Subjects of the United Provinces; That they ought to have more confidence in his Roy∣al word, than in the Reports of Pilots and Ma∣riners, who were very often ill informed: That as what concerned his forbidding the importation of Dutch Commodities, upon the account of the Contagion, he was obliged so to do, for the pre∣servation of his Kingdom, and of the health of his Subjects.


In the mean while the 
French
 King by his Am∣bassadors at 
London
 and the 
Hague,
 presented his Mediation in order to appease the differences that were ready to kindle a War between those two Powers; which the United Provinces agreeably received, but 
ngland
 refused: Which was the cause, that a little time after the Ambassadors of that Crown returned home very ill satisfied. The States laying nothing more to Heart, than the maintenance of Peace, and being very sensible how dear the last War had cost them, were glad before they engaged themselves in such ano∣ther, to try all means possible to avert it. For that effect, they writ a Letter to the King of 
Eng∣land,
 to signifie 
o him, that they had no other Passion greater than that to preserve Peace, hop∣ing his Majesty would be of the same mind. The King made answer to the States by another Letter, which was delivered them by the English Ambas∣sador at his return to the 
Hague,
 for he had made a step to 
London,
 to endeavour to terminate the differences between the two Companies of the East and West 
Indies.
 That Letter was full of protestations, signifying the great desire the King had on his side, to maintain the Peace; But then returning to the accustomed complaints, it was ad∣ded, that he saw with great regret, that they went not about to give any satisfaction to the 
English
 for their losses; and in fine, concluded with

 a protestation before God and Man, that they would be guilty of all the Inconveniencies, and fatal Consequences that would follow, if a speedy Reparation were not made.


The States, after the reading of that Letter, found well enough, that they were no longer to flatter themselves, the Intention of the Court of 
England
 being there clearly enough laid open to them, and without mincing of the matter, the King foretold them a part of those disasters that were ready to happen. In the mean while the 
English
 Navy was assembling with all diligence in the 
Downs,
 and about the Isle of 
Wight;
 And some 
Dutch
 Advice-Yachts that were sent out from time to time, to view and observe them were seized: Which confirmed the States in the Resolution to have Recourse to nothing else but the force of Arms.


Rear-Admiral 
Tromp
 being at Sea, as we have said, to Cruise upon the Watch for the Ships that were expected from the East-
Indies,
 had met them in the month of 
August,
 at 
Fairhills
 near 
Hitland,
 and had conducted them into their respective Ports, without seeing any English by the way. And four Merchant Ships belonging to the 
West-India
 Com∣pany, Bound for the Coast of 
Guiney
 were ready to set sail; but it was not thought fit to let them go without a good Convoy, because of the advice they had had, that Prince 
Robert
 with a Squadron of 18 Men of War, was ready to set out for 
Guiney,
 whither he was going to fa∣vour the depredations the English were making in those parts. The States in regard of the Good Services they had received from the 
West-India
 Company in several occasions, were resolved to employ their Forces to protect them: And for that end gave order to Captain 
Kampen
 with a Squadron of 10 Men of War, to Convoy to 
Gui∣ney
 the 4 Ships bound thither belonging to that Company. But because they doubted not but that the King of Great 
Britain
 would construe

 that Resolution for a new attempt on their side to∣wards the Breach of a Peace, they sent orders to their Ambassador at 
London
 to present his Maje∣sty the following Memorial thereupon.


THE States General of the United Provin∣ces having had advice from their Ambas∣sador at 
London,
 by their last Letters from him, That the King of Great 
Britain,
 the Duke of 
York,
 and his Majesties chief Ministers of State, had testified some discontent at their arming out some Ships of War designed for the Coast of 
Guiney,
 have thought fit for the taking away of all sort of Umbrage to declare the Reasons that moved them to that extraordinary Arming. Which are, That the States of the United Pro∣vinces having heard with much regret, That some Nation among which were some Subjects of his Majesty, contrary to his approbation, and his re∣peated Protestations that he had given no order for it, had some time since, by some hostilities attempted upon the Liberty of the Good Sub∣jects of the State, and especially those in their Countries in 
Africk,
 belonging to the West-
In∣dia
 Company, and principally upon the Coasts of 
Guiney,
 in seizing upon their Ships and Effects, and attacking in the bosome of Peace, this State, by taking of the Forts and Places it possesses: The United Provinces judging it their Duty to Protect their Good Subjects in those Countries, as far as it should be in their Power, and to se∣cure them for the future from the like attempts, had resolved to send thither a Squadron of 10 Men of War, and so much the rather because the West-
India
 Company is about sending thi∣ther four Merchant Ships richly laden, which it was not thought fit to expose without a Con∣voy to the danger the others have incurred, knowing 
hat the Enemies they have in that

 Country, by means of a Re-inforcement they have lately received, have sufficient Forces to make themselves Masters of the said four Mer∣chant Ships at their arrival there, as they have done of the others. And that his Majesty may be fully assured of the sincere intention of their High and Mightinesses, principally in what con∣cerns their maintaining of the Peace, and pre∣serving of a perfect good understanding between 
England
 and the United Provinces, the States were willing by this Memorial, to let his Maje∣sty know, That their Resolution is, to give Or∣der to him that shall have the Command of the said 10 Men of War, that in case he comes to meet on the Coasts of 
Guiney,
 or any where else in his way, with any of his Majesties Ships, or with those of any other Ally of this State, he shall not do them any offence against their liber∣ty, tending to the interruption of their Com∣merce, provided they have the same regards for the Subjects of the United Provinces; upon which his Majesty may entirely rely. And forasmuch as their High and Mightiness
s expect from the Justice of his Majesty, that his Subjects, who without his orders and approbation, have com∣mitted all sorts of Hostility out of his Kingdom, shall not be protected or supported in their enter∣prises, and that it will please him to give his orders to that purpose, to the Admiral of his Fleet that has been already sent into those Coun∣tries, or to others that shall hereafter be sent thither; In that confidence, their High and Mightinesses are assured, there will not happen on their part any mischievous Rencounter be∣tween his Majesties Ships and the States 10 Men of War, that will be capable to disturb the Uni∣on and good Correspondence of the two Nations. On the other side, may it please his Majesty, in order to the taking away all cause of complaint and jealousie, by a Generous and equitable Re∣solution,

 to assure their High and Mightinesses, of the Restitution of the Ships and Forts that cause so great damage to the Subjects of this State, and to their 
West-India
 Company; which is what their High and Mightinesses expect from the Friendship and Generosity of his Majesty.


The States being glad to use all imaginable pre∣cautions to prevent any attempts of the 
English
 against those Ships, because they knew well enough from good hands, that the English-Fleet was rea∣dy to put to Sea, gave order to Lieutenant Ad∣miral 
Opdam,
 who was then at 
Goree
 with a part of the States Fleet, to Convoy them the length of the Channel. That Fleet that had been equipt with all diligence, was composed of 39 Men of War.


But it seems afterwards, the 
Guiney
 Expedition was countermanded both by the English, and the Dutch: For Prince 
Robert
 received other Orders, and the Ships of the Company as well as their intended Convoy were detained by contrary Winds.


In the mean while, news came to the Dutch, That the English had appeared with some Men of War before New 
Amsterdam,
 situated in New 
Holland,
 in the West-
Indies,
 and had taken it, and forced all the Colony to submit to their Obe∣dience, with so much the greater Facility, because the 
Hollanders
 had no relief to hope for, and the English were ten to one, The Capitulation was signed the 8th of 
September,
 under the following Conditions.

Holland

English.

New 
Holland
 had been possess'd by the U∣nited Provinces above 60 Years, but being join∣ed on one side to New 
England,
 so near a Neigh∣bourhood of the two Nations made them that they could not endure one another together, and was a perpetual source of Jealousie and dispute; to prevent which, in the year 1663, they agreed upon certain limits that were to separate them. But the 
Engli
h
 broke that project under pre∣tence they had received no Orders for so doing, and whilst the Deputies from the 
Hollanders
 were at 
Boston
 busied in Regulating the limits, the 
English
 fell upon some Villages belonging to the States, and took them, publishing at the same time, that they knew no New 
Holland,
 but on∣ly a New 
England,
 of which all the Country depended, so that they influenced many of the Inhabitants to take Arms against the Govern∣ment. The directors of the 
West-India
 Com∣pany made their Complaints of it, to their High and Mightinesses, hoping they might come to an amicable Accommodation about it, but the result made it▪ plainly appear, that the 
English
 intended nothing less than Peace.


In the mean while the King of great 
Britain
 had Advice from Vice Admiral 
Lawson,
 and Captain 
Berkley
 at 
Cadiz,
 that Vice Admiral 
de Ruiter
 having Anchored in the Road of that Town, had taken in Provisions for a year, and that on the 5th. of 
October
 at 8 in the morning he weighed Anchor, with a Squadron of 12 great Men of War, in order to make the best of his way in all appearance towards the Coasts of 
Guiney,
 tho' he had given out that he was go∣ing to 
Sally.
 And indeed the suspicions of the 
English
 in that point were not without some foundation, for 
de Ruiter
 had received Express Orders from the States, to sail towards 
Cape Verd
 and the Coast of 
Guiney;
 to reduce the 
English
 to reason, and make them restore by force what they had unjustly usurpt.




Upon that news all the 
Dutch
 Ships were stopt in 
England,
 and Letters of reprisal were granted; but all those Commissions granted in haste were recalled, as well to shew all 
Europe,
 that they would not be Aggressors, as to gain time to Compleat the manning of their Navy. It was thought more proper to let loose the men of War and Capers upon the 
Hollanders
 as well to encourage their press'd Seamen, and to get men enough to furnish their Grand Fleet, as the more effectually to interrupt the Com∣merce of the United Provinces, by taking their Merchant Ships that went to and fro in the Channel.


And because they knew, they in 
Holland
 ex∣pected about that time the return of their Ships from 
France
 and the 
Streights,
 they thought it their best way to go and meet them, and to en∣deavour to take them, before they let the Pri∣vateers go out, who in all likelihood, would but have awakened the 
Hollanders,
 and made them think the more of securing themselves. And this project succeeded well with them: For the Mer∣chant Fleet consisting of 113 sail, having quit∣ted the Coast of 
France,
 to pursue their way home along the Channel, was taken, and carri∣ed into the Ports of 
England.
 But amongst so great a Number of Merchant Ships, there being some Ships belonging to other Nations, they were redemanded, yet all the rest remained in their hands. At the same time the King of 
England
 in Justification of that proceeding, publish'd the following Declaration


HIs Majesty having considered the Injuries, Af∣fronts and Damages suffered in the Per∣sons of his Subjects, by the loss of their Goods and Ships, by the 
West-India
 Company, and o∣ther Subjects of the United Provinces, and those

 losses amounting to very considerable Sums, for which no Reparation could yet be obtained, notwithstanding the Complaints so often reite∣rated by his Majesty to the States General for that purpose, which have had no effect, His Majesty has thought fit by the Advice of his Privy Council, to grant Letters of Reprisal a∣gainst the Ships or Merchandizes belonging to the States of the United Provinces, or their Subjects, so that not only his Majesties Fleet, and Ships of War, but all sorts of Privateers shall have right by Letters of Reprisal, or per∣mission to be given him from his Royal High∣ness the Duke of 
York
 Lord High Admiral of 
England,
 to arrest and seize all Ships and Ef∣fects belonging to the States of the United Pro∣vinces, in Order to put them under the Jurisdicti∣on of the Court of Admiralty, which shall be Authorized to Act thereupon according to the Customs and Laws of Nations. And whereas several Ships and Effects belonging to the Uni∣ted Provinces or their Subjects have been alrea∣dy taken according to his Majesties Orders, and are kept in his Harbours, His Majesty, with the Advice of his Privy Council declares, that the abovesaid Ships and Effects are Comprized in the aforesaid Letters of Reprisal, and that they shall be proceeded against before the Ad∣miralty according to the Customs and Laws of Nations, till a final Judgment: And the Present Declaration shall serve for warrant for all that the said Court of Admiralty shall do in that matter. Dated at 
Whitehall December
 the 16th. 1664.


The United Provinces seeing themselves thus engaged in a War with 
England,
 and the Pro∣per season for putting out their Fleet to Sea be∣ing past, they thought however, that at least they ought to put a stop as much as 'twas possi∣ble,

 to all those Hostilities, and to provide for the security of their Subjects. Accordingly the States prohibited all their Merchant Ships to go out of their Ports, and their Seamen to take ser∣vice under any Foreign Prince. They likewise rigorously prohibited the going out of any ves∣sels and exportation of any Ammunitions, and generally of all materials serving to the building of Men of War, or furnishing their Equipages. Then Mr. 
Van Beuningen
 was sent to the Court of 
France,
 Mr. 
de Amerongen,
 into 
Denmark,
 and Mr. 
Ysbrands,
 into 
Swedeland,
 in Quality of Ambassadors Extraordinary, to inform the Princes that were Allies of the State of all that had lately passed, because the 
English
 by a fetch of their dissembling Policy, endeavoured in all those Courts, to make the 
Dutch
 pass for the Aggressors, and to attribute all the wrong to them. They resolved likewise to raise a fund of 14 Mil∣lions of Livers, as well for the building of 48 men of War, as for Levying of some Troops, to Re-inforce their Companies and their Garrisons, for the raising of a Marine Regiment, and a new Regiment in reserve, and lastly, for defraying the expences of the fortifications of the 
Brill,
 of 
Helvoet,
 of 
Maesland,
 of the 
Texel,
 and of the other necessities of the State. The 
East-India
 Company engaged to Equip 20 Men of War for the service of the United Provinces. The 
Zealand
 Privateers received Letters of Re∣prisal, so that the Capers in little time after took 30 prizes from the English. They also appoint∣ed a day of Prayer which was celebrated the 21st. of 
January
 1665, to implore the Protecti∣on of Heaven against the Contagion then Reign∣ing, and to beg a Continua
ion of Peace and of the Prosperity of the Prov nc
.


 
 In the mean while the S
ur 
de Goch,
 used all imaginable instances with 
 
ng of 
England,
 to endeavour to obtain the r
 
ng of the Ships

 which had been taken; But all in vain. For the King made him Answer, 
That he had cau∣sed to be arrested in his Ports; or to be taken at Sea, the
 Dutch 
Ships, upon the certain Advice he had, that
 de Ruiter 
was sent to
 Guiney, 
to in∣terrupt the Commerce of his Subjects, and to seize on their Ships, and Merchandizes, so that he in∣tended to indemnifie him for all those losses by the Confiscation of the goods that had been taken; that for the same end, he would stop all
 Dutch 
Ships that should come in his way, till he heard further news of
 de Ruiter, 
&c.
 The Duke of 
York
 also declared, in Quality of Lord High Admiral of the Kingdom, that he would go next spring to Sea, to maintain the Honour and Glory of the Crown.


And the Court of 
England
 was just ready to put out a Declaration of War against the 
Hol∣landers;
 But that 
Turner
 and 
Walker
 two Fa∣mous Advocates of the Court of Admiralty Re∣presented to the King, that if he declared War at that time, the Ships taken before the Decla∣ration, could not according to the Law of Na∣tions, be confiscated, upon which, 'twas thought fit to defer it for some time. However the 
Dutch
 Ships were declared Good Prize on the 6th. of 
January
 1665. But when they came to the sale of them, the Commissioners of the Admi∣ralty were far from finding their account advanced by it, so little money did they receive from it be∣cause besides that all the best of what was in those Ships, had been imbezell'd, the charges of the Admiralty Court amounted to very considerable sums.


The 
French
 begun likewise to resent the un∣supportable Dominion of the 
English
 at Sea: For they pretended to visit their Ships in the Channel, to see whether they carried any 
Dutch
 Merchandizes, and several of them were seized on that pretence, and carried into the Ports of

 
England,
 and sold according to their value be∣fore any Plea could be put in for their release. About the end of the precedent year, the 
English
 just as if War had been declared, had attackt the Convoy of the 
Dutch Smyrno
 Fleetnear 
Cadiz,
 un∣der the Command of Commadore 
Brakel
 who was kill'd on that occasion after he had sig∣naliz'd himself, as appears by the following Let∣ter written upon that Subject to the Admiralty of the College of 
Amsterdam,
 by Captain 
Van Meeuwen.


THe 26th. instant we unmoor'd from 
Malaga
 under the Command of Commadore 
Brakel
 Captain 
Roetening,
 and Captain 
Kuiper
 of 
Zea∣land,
 with a Fleet of about 30 Merchant Ships great and small, steering our Course towards 
Cadiz.
 When we were arrived near 
Cape Moly
 3 Merchant Ships more joyned our Flag, 
viz.
 one 
Dutch
 one, and two Foreigners, we made all together towards the Mouth of the 
Streights,
 and having past it on the 28th. with some Merchant Ships of our Fleet separated from us; the same night being arrived within 3 miles of 
Cadiz
 Bay, Commadore 
Brakel
 gave the signal to cast anchor; the next morning at break of day, we set sail again, and some of our Merchant Ships were scattered from us: The 29th. in the morning we met 8 or 9 
English
 Ships, upon which 
Brakel
 advancing towards their Flag, saluted it with some Guns, but the 
English
 Ad∣miral waiting his opportunity till 
Brakel
 came up side by side with him, powered in upon him a whole Broad side. When we saw that, we repaid him his change. But several Mer∣chant men, contrary to the Orders of their High and Mightinesses, and in contempt of their honour, and the Oath of fidelity sworn to their Country, basely deserting us to Retire into the Road. We had not all the advantage

 we had reason to hope for if we had been se∣conded; for without difficulty with the Di∣vine Protection, the 
English
 would have been beaten, whereas on the contrary to our great regret, Commadore 
Brakel
 was kill'd, as also two others, and some wounded in his Ship which has received some shot under Water, and we are now busie in repairing her. Captain 
Roe∣tening
 has likewise had 2 men kill'd, and some wounded. As for my self, God be prai∣sed, I have received no damage excepting some shot in my sails, and some of my Rigging shat∣tered. The 
English
 have taken 2 small Ships. The Pilot 
John Roelofsz
 who was in the Ship 
King Solomon,
 was sunk after he had defended himself like a brave Soldier: The Ship St. 
Ma∣ry,
 one of those we lost in the Night, was ta∣ken by the 
English
 before the fight, as she was retiring into the Road, where we arrived in the dusk of the Evening. The 
English
 keep the bay besieged. I could wish I had received orders from their High and Mightinesses, to un∣lade some Ships and take them into their Ser∣vice; For then I should flatter my self with the hopes, by the blessing of God, to chase them Quickly out of the Bay.


This Letter as well as another from Commis∣sioner 
Giisbert T
mels
 written from Port St. 
Ma∣ry
 the same day, 
viz.
 The 30th. of 
December,
 agreed together in all the Circumstances of that Action: They were read in the Assembly of the States General, who in Consequence of them, publish'd on the 24th. of 
January,
 the following Declaration.


AFter having maturely examined and consi∣dered the offences and frequent Acts of Hostility committed since some time on the part of the King of Great 
Britain,
 or his Subjects

 by usurping Countries, Towns, Fortresses, and Vilages, first on the Coast of 
Guiney
 after∣wards in New 
Holland,
 and lastly by the ta∣king of several Ships in 
Europe;
 It hath been resolved, that all sorts of 
English
 Ships whether Men of War, or Merchants, shall be taken and seized by the States Men of War, and brought into the Ports of the United Provinces, till his 
Britannick
 Majesty shall have made Reparati∣on for the Hostilities committed, or that some Accommodation be made, and in Consequence hereof, the Colleges of the several Admiralties shall be Ordered to send out immediately to Sea some light Frigats, and to put in Executi∣on the above said intention of their High and Mightinesses by the General Officers and Cap∣tains of the Men of War under their Respe∣ctive Jurisdiction, or which depend of them, 
&c.


In pursuance of that Declaration, Express Or∣ders were sent to the Colleges of the Admiral∣ty to cause all diligence to be used in endea∣vouring to forward the Equipages of the Men of War, that they might be Compleated by the next spring. The States on the other side thought fit for very important reasons, to Cre∣ate three new Lieutenant Generals, or Admirals over and above those that were already honour'd with those High Offices, and according to that project, Vice-Admiral 
Me
wisz Rortenaar,
 was elected Lieutenant Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of the 
Meuse;
 Vice-Admiral 
Michael Adriansz de Ruiter,
 was made Lieutenant Ad∣miral of the College of 
Amsterdam;
 and Vice-Admiral 
John Cornel
us Meppel
 was Created Lieut
nant Admiral of the College of 
West-Fries
and,
 for the North. Some change was al∣so made amongst the other Officers of the Fleet. For Rear-Admiral 
Aart Van Nes
 was made Vice

 Admiral of the Admiralty of the 
Meuse,
 and Cap∣tain 
John de Liefde
 was made Rear Admiral in his place, Rear Admiral 
Cornel
us Tromp
 was Created Vice Admiral of the College of 
Am∣sterdam,
 and Captain 
de Wilde
 substituted in his place of Rear Admiral; 
Keort Siewersz Ade∣laar,
 Famous for his Exploits against the 
Turks,
 and who afterwards went into the Service of the King of 
Denmark,
 was elected Vice-Admi∣ral of the College of 
West-Friesland
 for the North, but he thanked the States for the Ho∣nour they intended him, and so Rear-Admiral 
Volkert Schram
 was made Vice-Admiral in his place; and Captain 
Frederick Staghouwer
 had the Office of Rear-Admiral of the same College. The Quality of Lieutenant Admiral of 
Zealand
 was likewise given to Vice Admiral 
John Evertsz.
 But Mr. 
Opdam
 Lieutenant Admiral of 
Holland
 and 
West-Friesland
 was named by the States, to Command in chief, in all the Sea Forces of the States, in Quality of Lieutentant Admiral General, and Lieutenant Admiral 
Kortenaar
 had order to take the place of 
Opdam,
 in case of his death or sickness.


A little time before, some Deputies of the States had been sent to Muster the inhabitants of the Villages near the Coast of 
Holland,
 be∣ginning at the Village, 
Ter Heide
 near the 
Hague,
 and so on to the 
Texel,
 and found their Number to amount to 36000. In the mean while an Ordinance was publish'd, prohibiting all Sub∣jects of the United Provinces to stir out of their Ports, upon pain of Confiscation of their ships and Merchandizes, in case they were ta∣ken; And they likewise prohibited in particu∣lar the exportation of all sorts of Ammunition and the going out of the ships designed for the Whale-Fishing, and all sorts of Fishing about 
Greenland,
 and small Fishing, and the importa∣tion of Herrings, and other salt Fish: which

 was done with intent thereby to get up the more men to Compleat the manning out of the Fleet, and to prevent the 
Dutch
 ships from being ta∣ken by the 
English.
 And for the Encourage∣ment of the Seamen greater Recompences were setled than ever before upon all such who should make themselves Masters of any 
English
 man of War, or of any of their Flags. For to that ef∣fect, there was an Ordinance publish'd, dated the 10th. of 
March,
 by which it was promised, That whatsoever ship of the States should in a General Sea-fight between the two Fleets or in any Rencounter, take any 
English
 ship, should have not only the ship so taken, with all that belonged to it as a reward, but that over and above that, he that should take the chief Ad∣miral ship of the 
English
 should have 50000 Livers Gratification;, for every other Admiral ship, 30000 Livers; for every ship of other General Officers, 20000 Livers; for every other ship of War carrying 40 Guns, 10000, and for every other ship less considerable, excepting Yachts, 6000 Livers: That he that should bring away the Flag of the chief Admiral should have 5000 Livers Reward, and for the Flags of the other Admirals, 2500 Livers; for the Flag of a fore mast, 1250 Livers; for that of the mizzen mast, 750 Livers and for the Flag on the Poop 250 Livers. The Captains of the Fire-Ships that should burn any of the Enemies Ships, were to have for each of them so burnt the 3d. part of the Sum promised to those who take an 
English
 man of War. The same reward was Assigned for those who in quality of Volunteers, should set out Fire-Ships for the Service of the State. He that could sink or otherwise destroy any of the Enemies Fire ships that were ready to en∣damage any of the States men of War, was to have 6000 Livers Gratification, Those who out of an Extraordinary affection to their Country

 should furnish out any man of War to join the Flag of the States Fleet, to endeavour the ruine of the Common Enemy, were to receive double the reward granted to the other ships of the State, both for the 
English
 ships they should take and for their Flags, and that in acknowledge∣ment of their Zeal, their Fidelity, and their Bravery, There were also particular Recompences allotted to those that should rescue out of dan∣ger any of the States Men of War that hap∣pened to be surrounded by the Enemies, and ready to be burnt or sunk, and to those who out of a General fight, should take any 
English
 man of War. Besides all which, there was granted to the Widows and Children of those that should happen to be killed in the fight, double the sum of their Husbands or Parents Wages; It was likewise Ordered, that the said Recom∣pences should be granted, tho' the ships that had merited them shou'd happen to be sunk, or that they could not be brought back into their Ports. And to second, and raise the Courage of the Great Men, and inspire honour into the Cowards and run-aways, it was decreed, that those who should deliver up any of the States men of War into the hands of the 
English
 should be Con∣demned in a Council of War, and punish'd with death, without distinction, and without remissi∣on; and that all Sea-Officers whether General or Subaltern, who should quit the Flag without ex∣press order from the Admiral, should also be pu∣nished with death, 
&c.
 A little while after, a∣nother Ordinance came out from the States, bearing date the 17th. of 
March,
 allotting re∣compences for those who should be disabled, or maimed in the Service of the States, after the following rates, 
viz.








 


Livers






For the loss of both Eyes,


1500






For one Eye,


0350






For the loss of both Arms,


1500






For the Right Arm,


0450






For the Left


0350






For the loss of both Hands,


1200






For the Right Hand,


0350






For the Left,


0300






For the loss of both Legs,


0700






For one Leg,


0350






For the loss of both Feet,


0450






For one Foot,


0200






As for other lamed Persons, the College of the Ad∣miralty reserved to themselves the care to allow them recompences according to their discretion. It was likewise ordered, that all those that were disa∣bled from getting any thing towards their subsist∣ence should receive each a pension of a Ducatoon 
per
 week, during the remainder of their lives, and the rest of the disabled men, proporti∣onably.


The States General thought fit also to adver∣tise all the Neighbouring powers, that in case any of their Subjects should be met at Sea, ar∣med out to prey upon the ships of the United Provinces, under colour of any Commissions bor∣rowed from the 
English,
 that if taken, they shall be punish'd as Pyrates: And that if any 
Hol∣landers,
 Subjects of the States should be found and taken on board any 
English
 Privateers, they should be punish'd with death without remission, and their Goods confiscated. The 
English
 and 
Scotch
 Captains that had been several years in the States service in their Land Forces, having re∣fused to take a new Oath of Fidelity to them for fear of losing their Estates in their own Coun∣try, were thankt for their former services, and transported home in one of the States men of War.




In the mean while, the King of 
England
 having been a long time impatient to declare War against the 
Ʋnited Provinces,
 at last published his so long intended Declaration for that effect, on the 14/4th of 
March,
 1665. by his Heralds, who proclaimed it by sound of Trumpet in the great Streets of 
West-minster
 and 
London
- It was conceived in these Terms.


WHereas,
 upon the Complaints of divers Of∣fences, Injuries and Usurp
tions, commit∣ted by the 
East
 and 
West-India
 Companies, and other the Subjects of the 
Ʋnited Provinces,
 upon the Persons, Goods and Ships of our Subjects, to their great Damage, which amount to very considerable Sums, instead of receiving the Satis∣faction so often demanded, we have found, that they have given Order to 
de Ruiter,
 not only to quit the Project formed against the Corsairs of the 
Mediterranean,
 in Consequence of the Union that had been proposed to us by the States Gene∣ral, but also to attempt upon the Liberty of our Subjects in 
Africk,
 by using against them all sorts of Hostility. After which, we gave Orders to stop all the Ships belonging to the Subjects of the 
Ʋnited Provinces;
 tho' we never granted any Commissions to use Reprisals, or suffered any Proceedings against the Ships so stopt, till we had a full Assurance, that 
de Ruiter
 had put in execution the said Orders, by the taking or seve∣ral of our Subjects, and of their Ships and Mer∣chandizes. Finding at present bv these new Of∣fences and Attempts, and by the Advices we have received of their Preparations for War, and of their granting out Letters of Reprisal against our Subjects, that our over-great Indul∣gence, and all the other Remedies employed by us, to induce them to entertain a true Amity with us, have been ineffectual, seeing they are resolved by Force of Arms to maintain their unjust At∣tempts;

 we therefore have thought fit, with the Advice of our Privy Council, to testifie and de∣clare to the Face of the whole Earth, That the said States are the Aggressors, and ought justly to be acknowledged such by all the World; so that our Fleets and Ships, as well as all other Ships that shall receive Commissions from our well-beloved Brother the Duke of 
York,
 Lord High Admiral of 
England,
 shall have Right, and may, by vertue of them, Fight, Take, and make themselves Masters of all the Ships, Vessels and Effects belonging to the Subjects or the 
Ʋnit∣ed Provinces,
 or to them that shall be bound for their Country. We also expresly forbid all our Subjects (as we likewise advertise all other Per∣sons, of what Nation soever they be) to carry or Transport any Soldiers, Arms, Powder, Am∣munition, or other contraband Merchandizes, into the Lands, Countries, Plantations, or Pro∣vinces, belonging to the said States, for that such things, when taken, shall be adjudged good Prize. And further, we declare, That every Ship, of what Nation soever it be, that shall be found to have on Board her any Effects, Mer∣chandises, or any number of Persons belonging to the United Provinces, or their Subjects, shall be declared good Prize, with her Lading: Also, That all the Effects and Merchandises of what Nation soever they be (whether they belong to us or Foreigners, it matters not) which shall be found in any Ships belonging to the States, or to any of their Subjects, they all shall be de∣clared good Prize, unless the said Ships be pro∣vided with good Pass-ports, granted to them by us, or our Dear Brother.


And that this our Declaration may be publick, and all the World may have perfect Knowledge of it, our Will and Pleasure is, That this pre∣sent Declaration be publisht with all the usual formalities, as it ought to be, 
&c.




As soon as this Declaration appeared, the States sent Copies of it into all the Courts of 
Europe;
 which they directed to their Ministers there, to present them to all the several Princes and Powers, and to make them take notice, at the same time, what Losses and Damages they must expect from such a Declaration, by the Interruption of their Commerce, since by that not only the Merchan∣dizes, which should be found on Board the 
Dutch
 Ships, were to be declared good Prize, but also all the Vessels belonging to them, if they were laden with 
Dutch
 Commodities; or if they had on board them any of the Subjects of the 
Ʋnited Pro∣vinces.
 The 
French,
 and those of 
Hamburg
 and 
Ostend
 sufficiently felt the Effects of it, since ma∣ny of them, tho' they were going toward Neuter-Places, were seized and carried into the Ports of 
England;
 from whence they were not released till a long time after, and with much Difficulty, and after great Expences.


The War then being declared, the 
English
 Navy Royal, under the command of the Duke of 
York,
 consisting of above 100 Sail of Men of War, great and small, set sail the first Day of 
May,
 and two Days after, arrived before the 
Texel;
 a little too soon, and before it was well compleat. The cause of that great Precipitation was, a false piece of News sent to 
White-hall
 by the Earl of 
Ossory,
 Son to the Duke of 
Ormond,
 Vice-Roy of 
Ireland,
 That a certain Bark had discovered, behind 
Hit∣land,
 a Fleet of 60 Sail, which they thought at first to be 
de Ruiter
's Fleet, with some Prizes: but on the 8th of the same Month the 
English
 Fleet was saluted with a violent Tempest, in wnich some of their Ships were scattered, and others very much damnified: So that seeing 
de Ruiter
 appeared not, they were forced to return back into their own Ports, without having made any other Progress than the taking of 7 Ships laden with Wine, with another Ship that served them

 for Convoy, an 
English
 Prize, taken by the 
Hol∣landers
 near the 
Ca
ibee Islands,
 and a Ship of 
Lisbon:
 But the Men of War that were their Convoy, being nimble Sailers, escaped by the Fa∣vour of the Night.


Whilst the 
English
 were busie in repairing the Damages done to their Fleet by the ill Weather, the 
Zealand
 Fleet, consisting of 31 Men of War, having set sail the 22d of 
May,
 at break of Day, joyned that of 
Holland,
 under the Command of Lieutenant-Admiral 
Opdam.
 After which jun∣ction, the whole Fleet kept on their Course, being composed of 103 Men of War, 7 Yachts, 11 Fire∣ships, and 12 Galliots, carrying 4869 Guns, and 21631 Men, and was divided into 7 Squa∣drons.


The first was under the Conduct of Admiral 
Opdam,
 Vice-Admiral 
Vander Hulst,
 and Rear-Admiral 
de Graaf.
 The second was commanded by Admiral 
John Evertsz,
 Vice-Admiral 
de Liesde,
 and Rear-Admiral 
Cornelius Evertsz.
 The third was under the Command of Admiral 
Kortenaar,
 Vice-Admiral 
Schey,
 and Rear-Admiral 
Marce∣veld.
 The fourth was under the Conduct of Ad∣miral 
Stellingwerf,
 Vice-Admiral 
Koenders,
 and Rear-Admiral 
Bruensveld.
 The fifth was under the Command of Admiral 
Cornelius Tromp,
 of Vice-Admiral 
Koeverden,
 and of Rear-Admiral 
P. Salomonsz.
 The sixth was commanded by Ad∣miral 
C. Evertsz,
 Vice-Admiral 
Bankert,
 and Rear-Admiral 
Bronsaart.
 And lastly, the seventh was under the Conduct of Admiral 
Schram,
 Vice-Admiral 
Staghouwer,
 and Rear-Admiral 
Hour∣tuin.


That Fleet, one of the finest and most formida∣ble that ever appeared on the Northern Seas, seized and took, soon after, about 20 
English
 Ships; the News of which coming to 
London,
 put the Mer∣chants almost out of their Wits, for Vexation: Which made double Care and Diligence be used

 in Pressing of Men, and arming out the 
English
 Fleet, so that at length it put to Sea again, con∣sisting of 107 Men of War, and of 14 Fire-ships or Advice-Yachts, and was divided into 3 Squa∣drons: Whereof the first, under a Red Flag, was commanded by the Duke of 
York, Pen
 and 
Law∣son.
 The second, being the White Squadron, was under the Conduct of Prince 
Robert, Mings,
 and 
Samson.
 And the third, being the Blue Squa∣dron, was commanded by the Earl of 
Sandwich, Cuttins
 and Sir 
George Ayschew.


The Two Fleets were not long before they en∣gaged in a Battle, that was cruel and bloody, of which these were the principal Circumstances.


On the 8th of 
June,
 the 
English
 Fleet,
 being re∣fitted, put to Sea a second time, unmoored from 
Gunfleet
 Bay, near 
Harwich,
 and came to an Anchor in 
Southwold
 Bay, as well to take in a new Supply of Provisions as to be nearer hand to ob∣serve the 
Dutch
 Fleet, that was expected on the 
English
 Coasts. The Wind being easterly, the 
English
 kept, during the Night before 
Alborough,
 at about 5 Miles distance from the Shore; about Midnight the Duke of 
York
 received Advice, That the 
Dutch
 Fleet, steering towards the South-east, was making directly up to him, and was not above 6 Miles from him; upon which News, the 
English
 made all their loaden Ships retire towards the Shore; and the 
Dutch,
 on their side endeavoured to get the Weather-gage. The 12th of the same Month, the Wind being at East, the 
Dutch
 were at about 5 Miles Distance from the 
English
 to the South-eastward, and then the Wind, turning to the South-west, continued so all Night, and the two Fleets met before 
Laystoff,
 at about 8 Miles distance from the 
English
 Shore. That Night, a 
Dutch
 Fire-ship took Fire, by the Imprudence of him that commanded it, who was got drunk; which Accident the 
English
 took for a happy Presage of Victory to them. However, the 
Dutch
 Fleet, in

 spite of the Disadvantage of the Wind, of which the 
English
 were Masters, during the whole Fight, fell upon Prince 
Robert
's Squadron that was backt by Vice-Admiral 
Mings.
 The Duke of 
York
's Squadron formed the main Battle, and that of the Earl of 
Sandwich
 made up the Rear. The Battle begun at 3 in the Morning. Admiral 
Opdam
 vigo∣rously broke through Prince 
Robert
's Squadron, being followed by Lieutenant Admiral 
Kortenaar,
 Lieutenant Admiral 
John Evertsz,
 Vice-Admiral 
Cornelius Tromp, Stellingwerf, Bastian, Senten,
 &c. The two Fleets engaged in streight Lines, without throwing themselves into 
Crescents,
 and so recipro∣cally broke through one another, remaining still in Presence one of the other, without rallying presently to make a fresh Charge. The Wind was West, and the 
English
 were towards the North-west, and the 
Dutch
 to the South-westward; the two Fleets broke through one another the se∣cond time, at 6 in the Morning. And because the Duke of 
York
's Squadron kept still the Weather-gage, without engaging in Fight, it was impossi∣ble for the 
Dutch
 to win that Advantage from them; but it fared not in the like manner with that of Prince 
Robert,
 which was broken through by the 
Hollanders.
 But the two Fleets having till then done nothing but canonaded one another afar off, at length the Earl of 
Sandwich
 advancing, about one in the Afternoon, separated the 
Dutch
 Fleet in two; and then the two Fleets coming to a closer Fight, and firing at one another very fiercely, Ad∣miral 
Opdam
 boarded the 
Royal Charles,
 in which was the Duke of 
York
 in Person; and those two Admirals thundred at one another so furiously, with continual Broad-sides, that the Earl of 
Fal∣mouth,
 and the Lord 
Muskerry,
 and Mr. 
Boyle,
 and some of that Princes Footmen, were killed by the Duke of 
York
's Side, and he himself was slight∣ly wounded in the Hand, which was dyed with the Blood of Mr. 
Boyle;
 and just then, as they were

 distributing the Cartridges in Admiral 
Opdam
's Powder-room, an unlucky Shot coming, as is said, from a small 
English
 Ship,
 commanded by one 
Smith,
 afterwards Sir 
Jeremy Smith,
 who in that nick of Time, seeing the Duke's Danger, had un∣perceivedly stole under the 
Dutch
 Admiral's Side, set Fire to his Powder and blew him up in a mo∣ment, with all his Men, excepting only 5, about 3 in the Afternoon. Mr. 
Opdam
 had not as yet been wounded when this fatal Disaster happened to him, but he perished on that unhappy occasion; How∣ever, the Hull of his Ship, after having floated some time, was towed off into the 
Ʋlie.


This sudden and unexpected Loss of Admiral 
Opdam,
 put the 
Hollanders
 in a great Consterna∣tion, and extremely raised the Courage and Hopes of the 
English,
 and that so much the more because till then the Victory seemed to waver and to be uncertain for which Side to declare. And that dis∣mal Accident was soon followed by a second; for 3 
Dutch
 Men of War, 
viz.
 the 
Marsseveen,
 com∣manded by Captain 
Reus,
 the 
Tergoes,
 by Captain the 
Kruining,
 and 
Swanenburg
 by Captain 
Kuiper,
 happened to be intangled together so strongly, and the two latter imprudently falling foul upon the Prow of the 
Marsseveen,
 engaged themselves so fast to her Fore-mast, that it was impossible to part them, tho' 200 of their Seamen did all they could, with their Axes, to do it; which Disorder being perceived by the 
English,
 they resolving not to lose the Opportunity of making their Advantage of it, immediately detacht away a Fireship to burn them, which accordingly fastning upon the 
Ter∣goes
 and 
Swanenburg,
 both new-built Ships, pre∣sently set them on Fire, and the Flames swiftly passing to the 
Marsseveen,
 reduced them all three to Ashes: At which Disaster, the Seamen leapt all into the Sea, and the Fire soon after gaining to their Powder, the 3 Ships were blown up into the Air. Captain 
Reus
 leapt into a Boat, but yet could

 not save himself. In the mean while, at that Spe∣ctacle, the 
English
 cry'd out, 
You Rogues, you Fel∣lows, you must be killed.
 The Master, 
George Thomas,
 with some others that could swim, saved themselves in a deserted Boat, and got to 
Schevel∣ing.
 At the beginning of the Fight 
Tromp,
 being seconded by the Captains 
Tierk, H
ddes
 and 
Swart,
 so miserably battered the 
English
 Ship, called the 
Charity,
 Captain 
Wilkinson
 Commander, that soon after she became an easie Prey to Captain 
Haan,
 and 90 of her Seamen, leaping into a Long-boat, were afterwards conducted to 
Harwich.
 In the mean time, the Duke of 
York,
 observing that some 
Dutch
 Ships made shew as if they had no great Sto∣mach to come on to charge again, sent 
Lawson,
 with some 
English
 Men of War, to attack them; but he found so much Resistance from them, that having one of his Knees all shattered to pieces, he was carried to Shore and died. 
Bastian Senten
 that commanded the Ship called the 
Orange,
 finding himself alone among the Enemies, fought with all the Bravery imaginable: For he had the Cou∣rage to board the 
Mountague,
 and took her, and pulling down her blue Flag, he put up the Princes Flag in stead of it, which he kept up above an Hour, according to the faithful Report of all that were Spectators of so bold an Action: But the 
Mountague
 was afterwards regained by the 
Royal James
 of the White Squadron, where the Earls of 
Marlborough
 and 
Portland
 lost their Lives; And at last, the 
Orange,
 after she had signalized herself against Captain 
Smith
 that commanded the 
Mary,
 was burnt and blown up, and her Cap∣tain 
Bastian Senten
 died of his Wounds. Admi∣ral 
John Evertsz
 stoutly attacked the Ships 
Speaker
 and 
Charles,
 that seconded the Duke of 
York,
 and did them very much damage; and the Admiral∣ship it self, commanded by the Duke of 
York,
 was very near being burnt by a Fireship, had she not by a dextrous and nimble turn avoided it. Captain

 
Koenders
 likewise fought with much undaunted∣ness, as did also 
Stellingwerf.
 This latter had his Body cut off in the middle with a Cannon Bullet. Lieutenant-Admiral 
Kortenaar
 said at the begin∣ning of the Fight, 
Methinks our Admiral falls a little too low, it's impossible that way for us to get the Weather-gage;
 and he falling upon the 
Royal Catharine,
 was shot above the Knee with a Can∣non-Ball, and died immediately. 
Cornelius Evertsz
 being hard by, and hearing of the Death of that Admiral, gave Notice of it to 
John Evertsz,
 cry∣ing out, that it belonged to him now to put up the Admiral's Flag; which he presently did; but having been in all the Attacques that had been made, from 3 in the Morning till 7 in the Afternoon, and having received 17 Shot under Water, had 13 Men killed and 40 wounded on Board him, and spent 14000 Pound of Powder, being no longer able to keep the Sea, he retired towards the 
Meuse,
 and some Men of War, that had not yet fought a Stroke, were so basely cowardly as to follow him against his Will: Upon which, many in the Fleet mistaking the Departure of 
John Evertsz
 for a Retreat, there were above 36 Men of War more, of the finest and best in all the Fleet, that turned likewise Tail, and steered away for the 
Texel:
 Whilst undaunted 
Tromp,
 after he had put up the Admiral's Flag, as thinking 
John Evertsz
 was also killed, maintained the Fight still a considerable while longer: But however, that unlucky Rout preceeding, caused the Loss of many brave Men, that were by that means left helpless, surrounded on all sides by the Enemies, and for want of Assi∣stance, either perished or were made Prisoners. To all which Misfortunes, may be added, the Mu∣tiny that arose among the Men belonging to the Ships, 
Helversum, Charles
 V. and 
Nagelboom,
 &c. who revolting against their Captains, basely forced them to yield to the 
English;
 those Ships were commanded by 
Allert, Matthysz, Trelon


 and 
Boon,
 who had every where given sufficient Marks of their Courage, but yet were forced, on that occasion to yield to Necessity. One Cap∣tain 
Jenraan Poel,
 retired in the Night towards 
Wyk,
 being impatient to be one of the first to leave the Fight, with one of the finest Ships in the Fleet, called, the 
Delfland,
 crying out upon the Coast, 
That the Brave Men were left behind, to be but∣chered, whilst the Cowards ran away.
 The Night being come, and the 
English,
 being employed in giving Chace to some Barks belonging to the Vi∣ctuallers of the 
Dutch
 Fleet, those Cowards were covered and secured in their lurking-Holes, by 
Tromp,
 who keeping fighting still against the Ene∣mies, had all his Sails and Rigging shot down, and shattered to pieces. The 
Nagelboom
 being come to an Anchor before 
Petten,
 the Captain would not desert her, tho' she were left dry; but the Seamen running all away, wandred begging along the Coast like so many Rascals as they were, so that the 
English
 coming up, took her, as they did several other very fine Ships, that were lost to the State, by the meer Cowardice of the Seamen. The Master of 
Kortenaar
's Ship, 
Ate Inter Instra,
 instead of staying in the Fight, basely deserted it, and was followed by a great many others, which yet, when they were come into the 
Texel,
 had the Confidence to complain, That they had been so much exposed, when they scarce had had the Pa∣tience to take any more than a Glympse of the Ene∣my. Only 
Tromp,
 accompany'd with a small num∣ber of others, held out the Fight till the last, giving every where signal Proofs of his undaunted Courage: He was five Times with 
Swartsz
 and 
Cornelius Evertsz
 engaged in the midst of the Ene∣mies, and furiously battered by their Guns on eve∣ry side, and buried, as 'twere under so thick a smoak, that the Seamen in his Ship, openly ascribed to a Miracle the Preservation of his Ship and Per∣son. The valiant 
Tromp
 writ with a sensible Dis∣pleasure

 the following Letter to the College of the Admiralty of 
Amsterdam
 concerning the un∣happy success of this Battle.




High and Mighty Lords,


MY last was of the 9th. of 
June,
 at 
18
 miles distance from the 
Texel.
 On the 11th. of the same Month we discovered the 
English
 Navy to the Westward, and it being impossible for us by reason of the Calm, to get near them, the wind being North East, we steer'd to the East, South-East ward as much as we could, to gain the Wea∣ther gage, but a Calm came on, which continuing all night, and next morning too, we could attempt no∣thing; and finding the design of the 
English
 was to draw us upon the sand banks to which we were pretty near, we resolved to tack about to the West. On the 12th. it being still indifferent Calm, we found our selves to the East North East, and the North Westward: Towards evening we came a little near one another, the Wind continuing during the night, South and South South West, so that we had some hopes of getting the Weather gage, but it chopping about to the South East, both sides began to Cannonade one another. And the Powder of the Powder-room of the Admiral Ship catching fire through carelessness, she was blown up into the Air together with Admiral 
Wassenaar;
 which caused so great a confusion among the Ships of the Fleet that they all betook themselves to Flight by favour of the Enemies Wind; by which means some Ships falling foul upon, and being entangled one with the other, were burnt or taken by the 
English.
 At length after they had continued firing till the beginning of the night, that disorder forced them to separate from the others. The next morning we observed the Duke of 
York
 and the Earl of 
Sandwich
 following close behind us we having then not above 
10
 or 
12
 sail about us, and be∣cause

 it was impossible for us to rejoyn our other Ships, the Enemy followed us as far as before the 
Tex
l,
 where the most part of our dispersed Ships came up to us again but however we know not at present, how many we are in Number; and we fear many of them are missing; time will quick∣ly shew us how all things will end. Lieutenant Admiral 
John Evertsz
 is also missing. Lieuten∣ant Admiral 
Kortenaar,
 and 
Stellingwerf
 are dead. As for other private Captains, I know nothing of them, but that Captain 
de Haan
 was taken by an 
English
 man of War of 
46
 Guns. We saw that the Ships 
Marsseveen, Tergoes,
 and a Frigat of 
Amsterdam
 falling foul one of a∣nother so entangled themselves together that they were burnt, as were also some other Ships. The 
English
 likewise set fire to some other Ships besides, because as far as we could see, they were un∣masted and most shrewdly shattered.




Postscript.


We have lost together with our Ships our Bar∣ges and long Boats, which we desire their High and Mightinesses may be prayed to remember. We have found in our Ship 
44
 men wounded, and 
18
 kil∣led, about whom I request their High and Mihgti∣nesses would please to take Order.






The Winning of this Battle ought not to be imputed to the Bravery of the 
English,
 since the greatest part of the ships they took in it, were delivered them by the Rebellion or Co∣wardice of the Seamen, who received in 
England
 the just reward of their infidelity by the mi∣series they were made to suffer there in the Pri∣sons. The Action of 85 Villains that surrender∣ed to the 
English
 the ship 
Charles
 the 5th. is a terrible and abominable Example of it. They were some Soldiers who in the night of the Battle, joining with some insolent and seditious Seamen seized of all the small fire Arms, nailed up the

 Cannon, struck their Flag, spread their Sails, tur∣ned their Barges and long Boats a drift to the mercy of the Waves, and in that condition wait∣ed the approach of an 
English
 Fregat that was in chace of them, to which they Voluntarily yiel∣ded themselves, after they had with their drawn hangers and cockt pistols presented to their breasts forced the Captain and Officers that belonged to the ship, who would have opposed them, to remain in silence, under pain of death, and to be spectators of so detestable an Action without during to speak a word. The men of the ships 
Helversum
 and 
Nagelboom,
 as also some Officers of the Fleet, of whom we shall speak more amply afterwards, did the like without ha∣ving any regard neither to their honour, nor to the allegiance they had so solemnly sworn to their Country.


The 
English,
 (as the 
Dutch
 would have been in the same case, and as they affected to do afterwards, upon less occasions of Bragging than this,) being proud of all these advantages, failed not to publish them with all the glorious Circumstances imaginable. They Rung the Bells and made Bonfires every where, and put every thing else in practice that might tend to add splendor and renown to the Memory of so great a Triumph. 1500 
Dutch
 Prisoners were carri∣ed to 
Colchester;
 and it may well be judged by so great a Number what cruel and base Co∣wardice the Captains were guilty of, who chose rather shamefully to leave their Companions ex∣posed to the Flames, or to a Lamentable ship∣wrack and drowning, than to venture to snatch them from the devouring Jaws of death, by re∣ceiving them on board them when they fled, so that they must have perish'd, if their Enemies had not taken more Compassion of them then their own unnatural Officers. Amongst those per∣sons there was a Woman named 
Willemite Ger∣rets


 a Native of 
Embden,
 that had performed the function of Gunner in the ship 
Marsseveen,
 who being discovered, was released and set at liberty by King 
Charles
 the second for the ra∣rity of the adventure. She came afterwards to the 
Hague
 drest in the habit of an 
English
 Wo∣man, where she recited all the adventures of her life, and how she was saved, and the pleasant discourse she had with the King of 
England:
 And it appeared, that she had always carried her self very honestly, and that she was present at the fierce Battle of 
Funen
 in the North, no body on board the 
Marsseveen
 ever having dis∣covered her to be a Woman. Here follows an account of the losses on both sides in this fight.




On the 
English
 side.


The Duke of 
York

Before we pass, any further, we will report here some remarkable Circumstances relating to this fight.


The States after the Battle, being willing to provide against all Events had sent Orders to the Fleet to keep the Sea, tho' they had had the worst, as well to support the Reputation of their Arms, as to lessen the Glory of the Victors, that would have made that retreat pass for a total defeat. And for that effect, Mr. 
Witsen, Ʋrybergen,
 and 
Schrick
 being sent to the 
Texel,
 in Quality of Deputies from the States, went out of the Port, and sent for Vice-Admi∣ral 
Tromp
 on board them giving him Order to keep the Fleet out at Sea, and not to suffer it to enter into any Harbours. But 
Tromp
 being griev∣ed at the disasters that had newly hapned by the Baseness and Cowardice of the Officers and Soldiers of the Fleet, and his heart being ready to burst with indignation at them, could not for∣bear Answering, the Deputies that he could not execute their orders with men that had so base∣ly deserted him in time of danger, and upon whose Courage or Fidelity so little reli∣ance could be made. So that without minding the Orders of the Deputies, the Fleet under the Conduct of 
Tromp
 and 
Cornelius Evertsz
 entred into port, being in all about 60 Men of War, of which the most part were but little endama∣ged. Admiral 
Wassenaar,
 or 
Opdam
's ship, was,

 as we have said, blown up; 
Kortenaar
 
 but his ship was saved. However, it w
 
 known yet what was become of 
John
 E
 
 
Stellingwerf
 and 
Schram.
 On the 15th. of 
 the States Deputies took a review of the ships remaining in the 
Texel,
 found all of them in ge∣neral very little endamaged, and the most part in good condition, having lost very few Men, and in a Word, more afraid than hurt. The ships that were still in the 
Texel
 were 58 in Number, 7 that had staid behind in the Road and 2 unmoor'd that were put in before. They had advice that 18 were in the Port of the 
Vlie,
 and 16 or 17 in the 
Meuse, &c.
 So that they found none were missing but those we have set down, of all the whole Fleet.


In the mean while however, the murmurings of the People that were ill satisfied at the suc∣cess of the Battle and the Conduct of the Ge∣nerals, were grown to an extream height, and al∣ready begun to threaten mischievous Consequen∣ces. The first sparks of them begun to appear at the 
Brill,
 where 
John Evertsz
 of 
Zealand
 had like to have lost his life. For being come with his Ship into the 
Meuse,
 and Landing at the 
Brill,
 at his arrival the 
Mobb
 that judge of things always by the success, laid all the blame upon him, and imputing to him a great part of all the misfortunes that had hapned and accusing him of Cowardice, threw him into the Water, where he would certainly have been drown'd if he had not been rescued from the People by a good Number of Soldiers. But they stopt not there, for that Rascality growing thereupon more insolent endeavoured, all they could to sa∣tisfie their unruly passion, and pusht on their resentments to the utmost; so that in the night there appeared a great many Boats filled with Troops of Mutineers and Women, passing the 
Meuse
 to go and watch his coming to 
Maas∣landsluis,










 where he was to come to go to the 
: But they were deceived in their expe∣
n, for that setting out at 2 in the morn∣
g he was conducted under a good guard, to 
Helvoetsluis,
 and thereby escaped the danger of being made the Bloody Victime of an enraged people. Being come to the 
Hague,
 he there gave an account to the States, of his Conduct, and afterwards appeared before a Council of War held at the 
Texel,
 who were constrained by the force of truth, highly to applaud his Bravery and Conduct in the Battle. That Council was com∣posed of the following persons, 
viz.


Vice Admiral 
Tromp,
 Vice Admiral 
Cornelius Evertsz,
 Vice Admiral 
Koenders,
 Rear Admiral 
de Liefde,
 Rear Admiral 
Bankert,
 Rear Admiral 
Bruinsveld,
 the Captain and Commander 
Van∣der Hulst
 late Vice Admiral to Mr. 
Wassenaar
 or 
Opdam,
 Captain 
Nicholas Marreveld,
 late Rear Admiral to Lieutenant Admiral 
Kortenaar,
 Captain 
Peter Solomon,
 late Rear Admiral to Vice Admiral 
Tromp,
 Captain 
Bronser,
 late Rear Admiral to Vice Admiral 
Cornelius E∣vertsz,
 Captain 
de Haan,
 Captain 
Simon Blok,
 Captain 
Jacob,
 and 
Andrew Swart.


This Council of War then having drawn up an Indictment against those Officers of the Fleet that first begun to flie, as Authors of the disa∣sters and of the defeat of the Fleet they were condemned, and accordingly the Cap∣tains 
John Peitersz Onklaar, Anthony Evertsz, De Marre
 and 
Jacob Bruining
 were shot on the 13th. of 
June
 in the Fort of the 
Texel,
 in view of all the people, and on the same day and in the same place, the Captains 
VVilliam Codde, Vander Burg, John Vander Mariche
 and 
Apollonius Pool
 had their Arms broken at their Feet by the Common Hang-Man; and 
Samuel Huisman
 and 
Jacob Vander Kams
 were degra∣ded, and the first of them made uncapable of

 bearing Arms any more in the Service of the State. 
Ate Inter Estra,
 Mr. of Lieutenant Ad∣miral 
Kortenaar
's ship, who had Cowardly de∣serted the fight with the Admirals Flag, was con∣demned to stand with a halter about his neck under the Gallows, and afterwards to perpetu∣al Banishment. But if the States on the one side thought good to punish Criminals, so on the other, they were as Zealous to Recompence the deserving. And accordingly Captain 
De Haan
 that had fought so bravely, and taken the 
English
 Ship called the 
Charity,
 received 10000 Livers reward. The States likewise were pleased to honour the Glorious Memory of Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
Opdam,
 who unfortunately, pe∣rish'd in the Battle, by erecting to him a State∣ly Monument in the great Church at the 
Hague
 whereon is inscribed the following Epitaph in 
Latin.

The Sense of which in 
English
 is thus.






To the Honour and Renown of the most illustrious, descended from a most ancient Stock of the Nobi∣lity of
 Holland, 
by a continued and lawful Suc∣cession, Jacob
 Baron of 
Wassenaer,
 Lord of 
OPDAM,


Admiral of the Ʋnited Provinces, 
&c.
 who af∣ter many brave Exploits both by Sea and Land, not only in the 
Atlantick Ocean,
 wherein having scattered and put to flight the 
Portuguese
 Fleet, he returned home laden with rich Spoils, but like∣wise in the Strait of the 
Baltick Sea;
 where af∣ter

 he had repulsed the Enemies, and gained a glorious Victory over them, he succoured distressed 
Denmark,
 and at the same time asserted and securely established the Majesty of the Common∣wealth, and at last, after having fought most valiantly with but few Ships, against the whole Navy of 
England,
 and being by them surrounded on all sides, yet even then did not flinch from his Enemies, but after having made great Slaughter among them, and his Admiral Ship taking Fire, 
Hercules
-like, by the Flames found a way prepared for him to the Coelestial Heroes, in the 55th Year of his Age. The most Illustrious and Potent Lords, the States of the 
United Pro∣vinces,
 have erected this Monument, as to a most valiant Man that has highly well deserved of the Commonwealth, in the Year of our Lord 
1667.


In the Year of our Lord 
1657.
 the Fleet of the 
Unit∣ed Provinces,
 under the Conduct of the Baron of 
Wassenaer,
 defeated the 
Portuguese
 Fleet, near the Mouth of the 
Tagus,
 that was coming home from 
Brasil.


In the Year of our Lord 
1658.
 the Fleet of the 
Unit∣ed Provinces,
 under the auspicious Conduct of the Baron of 
Wassenaer,
 entred into the 
Sound,
 and carried salutary Assistance to the desperate con∣dition of expiring 
Denmark,
 after having in a most furious Fight repulsed and put to Flight the Enemies Fleet.










Great Honours were likewise paid to the Memo∣ry of Admiral 
Kortenaar,
 whose Tomb is to be seen at 
Rotterdam,
 with the following Epitaph in 
Dutch.










Ter erre van den onvergeliikeliiken Held Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaar Admiral. Hebben d'Ed Mognede Heeren des Admiralteit de Maas dit Gedenkreken van ziin dapperheld en roemruchtige dooddoen stellen.




De Held der Maas verminkt aan Oog en rechter hand,


En echter't Oog van't Roer de Vuist Van't Vader∣land:


De Groote Kortenaar de Schrik van's Vyandre Ʋlooten.


D'ontsluiter van de Sond, leyt in dit graf be∣slo
ten.


Of which the Sense in English is thus.






Egbert Bartholomew Kortenaar 
Admiral. Their High and Mightinesses of the Admiralty of the
 Meuse 
have caused this Monument to be ere∣cted to the eternal Memory of his Great Cou∣rage and Glorious Death.


The Hero of the Meuse, after he had lost one Eye and his Right Hand, yet however continues to Govern the Fleet by his good Conduct, and to support his Country with his valiant Arm; The Great Kortenaar, the Terror of the Enemies Fleet, he that opened the Sound, Rests inclosed in this Tomb.










A little while after the Criminals had been so pu∣nisht, and the merit and valour of those that had sig∣nalized themselves been rewarded, 
viz.
 on the 23d of 
July,
 Vice Admiral 
Tromp
 was elected Lieutenant Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of the 
Meuse,
 in the place of the Deceased 
Kortenaar
 in ac∣knowledgment of the eminent Bravery he had shewn in the last Battel. His advancement to that Office, rekindled a fresh the before damped zeal of the Seamen who testified an extraordinary joy at it, by reason of the extreme affection they bore him, which equall'd that they always had for his Father.




In the mean while, the States being intent upon consulting the means how to repair the ill success of their Arms, by new Forces, gave orders for working with all possible diligence in all the Pro∣vinces near the Sea, to fit up the Fleet again, and put it in a good Condition, and that so much the more prestingly, because they knew the Eng∣lish Fleet was crusing in the Channel, to watch for 
de Ruiter
's return, which was daily expected. After the Death of Mr. 
Opdam,
 they were much puzled about the choice of a person fit to be in∣trusted with the chief Command of their Fleet. Many of them cast their Eyes upon Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 but the obstinacy he had shewn against the Orders of the Deputies, when instead of keeping the Fleet out at Sea after the defeat, as they had Commanded, he made it go into the 
Texel,
 gave grounds for some misunderstanding, and caused a great many murmurings to arise, to the disadvantage of his reputation. Yet on the other side, they put great confidence in his un∣daunted Courage, and in the singular affection the Seamen had for him; but those good thoughts were again over balanced by the suspicions some predominant Members of the States of 
Holland
 then ha
 conceived of his Conduct, because that being passionately devoted to the interest of the then ungratefully contemned Prince of 
Orange,
 then excluded from all great Employments, those Insolent and Ambitious States-men were afraid the inclination he had for that Prince, might over-sway him against that Obedience he owed to those Masters who he knew had usurped from him his Rights. But however, the most judicious among them contested against all those seeming specious reasons, with more solid proofs drawn from his incomparable great Worth and Merit, not stick∣ing to say without bogling, that they could not well chuse another to that high Preferment without doing him injustice. At length after many debates

 and contrary Opinions thereupon, they resolved by common consent to confer upon him that great Employment,
 but yet with these Conditions, that there should be three Deputies of the States ap∣pointed to go along with him, with full Power over the Fleet, 
viz.
 Mr. 
Huiens,
 Deputy of the Assembly of the States General for the Province of 
Guelders,
 Mr. 
De Wit
 Pensionary of 
Holland
 and 
West-Friesland,
 that noted enemy to the 
Orangian
 Family, and Mr. 
Borreel,
 Burger Master of 
Middleburg.


Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 being thus promo∣ted to the chief Command of the Fleet, applied himself with all imaginable care to fill up with all speed the Compliment of Sea-men needful for the effectual manning out the Fleet, that it might be ready to put to Sea again assoon as possible. But when all things were just ready, and 
Tromp
 was already on Board his Ship called the 
Amity,
 with the Deputies of the States appoin∣ted to attend him,
 news came, that 
de Ruiter
 was arrived at 
Eems,
 which occasioned a change in all the Resolutions that had been taken. 
De Ruiter
 gave notice of his arrival to the States, by the following Letter,




High and Mighty Lords,


AFter having made my salutes in general, this shall be to inform your High and Mightines∣ses, of the safe arrival of the Fleet that under my Conduct, has made so long a Voyage, which came in the 6th. Instant in the afternoon to the West-ward of 
Eems,
 with 
5 English
 Prizes where∣of 
3
 are laden most with Sugar, and the other 
2
 are empty, one of which served us for a Fire-Ship in our way. A Merchant Ship likewise came from the 
Caribee
 Islands, which retired under our Con∣voy, 
&c. July
 the 19th. we approached towards the Isles of 
Fero,
 to get intelligence of the 
Eng∣lish,


 but no body could tell us any News of them, the 
21
 we past to the East-ward of 
Hitland;
 on the 22d. in the afternoon, a Galliot of 
Huisd
n
 came and joyned us, who reported to us the un∣fortunate success of the late Battle fought between the two Fleets, 
&c.
 On the 23d. we came near 
Bergen,
 where we received a Confirmation of what had been related to us. We pursued our way all along by the Coast of 
Norway,
 making all the sail we could, and on the 6th. of 
August
 we came into the West-ward of 
Eems,
 upon Advice that the 
English
 Fleet kept near the Coasts of 
Holland,
 being by our inequality in strength obliged to avoid them. And besides we had hardly 
10
 days Provision left, nay, some of our Ships had not for above 
5,
 and what is more they were leaky, and the most of them much endamaged. Captain 
Sweers
 has lost his Mizzen-mast and Bolt-sprit; the Ships of the Captains 
Pomp
 and 
de Hoen,
 leak on every side, so that they were by necessity constrained to cut down their Fore-masts, and their Prows; neither is Rear-Admiral 
Haakwants
 Ship in any better Condition. In fine, we praise God for bringing us home in sa
ety. We have brought Prisoners with us, the Governour of the Castle 
Cormantine Francis Sullevin,
 and desire their High and Mightinesses to be pleased to pre∣scribe us an Order how to deal with him. We took 
15
 Ships in the 
West-Indies,
 of which the most part were burnt. We found only 
7
 Ships in 
Newfoundland,
 which we took on the 16th. and 17th, of 
June, 3
 of which were burnt, and 
3
 more were given back to the Enemies, to serve to tran∣sport home 
150
 of them that were our Prisoners, whom we released to be Conducted into Old or New 
England.
 We unmoor'd on the 19
h. from St. 
John's Bay
 in 
Newfoundland,
 bringing off with us an 
English
 Frigat of 
18
 Guns, which I took my self. I will stay near the Fleet till further. Or∣der, hoping to receive it quickly, that we may be

 able all of us together to Regulate our selves ac∣cording to it.




The particulars, and more remarkable Cir∣cumstances of 
de Ruiter
 s Voyage into 
Guiney
 and to the 
West-Indies,
 may be more fully seen in the following Relation.




A particular Account and Relat
on of 
de Ruiter
's Voyage into 
Guiney
 and the 
West-Indies,
 in a Letter to a Person of Note.


SIR,


I Find my self indispensably engaged to in∣form you of the principal Events of this Voyage, which was begun on the 1st. of 
Octo∣ber
 in the year 1664. At which time 
de Rui∣ter,
 having received the necessary Orders for that effect, from their High and Mightinesses, summoned on board all his Captains, and gave them notice to furnish themselves with all ne∣cessary Provisions for their Men; after which, the Fleet being composed of 12 Men of War, namely 6 of 
A
sterdam
 under the Command of 
de Ru
ter
 himself, and 6 others under the Command of Vice Admiral 
M
pp
l
n,
 unmoor'd from 
Cadiz,
 and past before an 
Engl sh
 Squadron of Men of War, that was riding before a little Town cal∣led 
Rot
.
 About Evening, turning about to the South-South-West-ward we pursued our way. On the 16th. 
de Ruiter
 ordered every Ship to provide two scaling Ladders ready to mount to the Assault with; and at the same time we were informed, that we were going towards an Isle called 
Goede-ree,
 which the 
English
 had surprised from the 
Hollanders
 some Months before. Upon which we all testified a great deal of Alacrity and Resolution to go upon that enterp i
e. We arrived there on the 22d. of the same Month, and sound there 9

 
English
 Ships, 
viz,
 7 Merchant men, 1 of the King's Frigats, and 1 small Yacht, that was employed to carry the Merchandizes and Ef∣fects of the 
English
 from one place to ano∣ther. At our arrival, the Fort and Castle had put up the 
English African
 Companies Colours. The 
English
 Ships perceiving we were coming to attack them presently yielded at discretion. After which Command was given to the Kings Frigat, to unmoor, and retire, which she im∣mediat
ly did. Then the other Ships Crews, gave Oath that they were freighted for the 
English
 Company. Upon which, the Merchan∣dizes and Effects were seized, and removed in∣to our Ships: They consisted of divers Stuffs, Muskets, Forked Irons, Knives, Cloths and several Bales of Cotton. The Ships were re∣leased, but the Effects were declared good prize, as belonging to the 
English
 Company. When those in the Fort and Castle saw what passed they sent out a Barge with a White Flag, to 
de Ru
ter
's side, and surrendred immediately, to save their lives and goods. Upon which the Troops on board our Squadron were sent on shore with Banners displaved, who took possession of the Fort and Castle and put up there the Princes Colours. The 
English
 Go∣vernour with his men were conducted into one of the Ships, and ordered to retire where he best pleas
d. We were extreamly surprized when we found in the Castle 9 pieces of Can∣non, and 4 Granado Mortars, and in the Fort 12 pieces, with a Garrison of 150 men, and sufficient store of Ammunition and Provision, and that yet notwithstanding all these advan∣tages they had surrendered without resistance. After the retreat of the 
English,
 we made a detachment of 10 Soldiers and 2 Seamen out of every Ship, making in all 136 men, with the Officers, whom we left in the Country to

 secure it; And then we weighed Anchor and sailed away for 
Sierra Liona,
 where we arrived the 4th. of 
December.
 We perceived in that place a horrible Comet having the body turn'd to the East-South-East-ward, and the tail to∣wards the North-North-West. We discover'd there a Lodgment which the 
English
 had made defended by 2 pieces of Brass Cannon, and 2 of Iron, which we took; after we had ruin∣ed the Lodgment. We found there a good quantity of Elephants Teeth, and Forked bars of Iron, a great many other things, and like∣wise a 
Dutch
 Man, and 2 Children that were Prisoners there, whom we set at liberty; and after having watered there, and supplied our selves with Limons, and other refreshments, Vice-Admiral 
de Ruiter
 fired the parting Gun, and sailed away, steering to the South-West-ward. On the 5th. of 
January
 1665, we came to an Anchor before 
Tacorary,
 and the Castle of 
Witsen,
 which the 
English
 had likewise seiz∣ed from us, and summoned them by a Letter to surrender: But upon their refusal some of our Ships approach'd, and fired upon the Ca∣stle, which did the same upon the 
Hollanders.
 At the 
ame time without delay, we Landed a∣gainst them all the Soldiers in our Fleet, who at first met with a great deal of Resistance from the 
Negroes,
 who killed and wounded ma∣ny of them, out they betaking themselves to flight soon after the descent, our men set fire to their Lodges. The 
English
 upon that de∣feat put up a White Flag and demanded qua∣ter; after which they yielded up the Castle, where we found 24 Men in Garrison, and 7 pieces of Cannon. A litle while after, disco∣vering an 
English
 Ship at Sea, 
de Ruiter
 Or∣dered her to be attackt, and after an hours fight, she was taken. She proved a Ship car∣ing 33 Guns, and 50 Men, called the 
Victory.


 The next day we blew up the Castle of 
VVit∣sen,
 and set sail again towards the Castle of 
Soma
 belonging to the 
Dutch West-India
 Com∣pany, which saluted our Vice-Admiral with some Guns. The 7th. of 
January
 1665, our Squadron Anchored in 6 Fathom Water before the Castle 
del Mina,
 where Mr. 
Val∣kenburg
 Commanded, who likewise saluted us with some Guns. We there unladed all the Booty we had made in the Isle of 
Goede-ree,
 of which that Garrison stood in Great need, having of a long time received no supply, nor having any hopes to receive any. On the 9th. of the same month, we discovered another Ship at Sea, which was attackt and brought the same day into the Fleet. She proved to be an 
English
 ship of 20 Guns, and 40 Men, call'd the St. 
Martha;
 which after we had unladen, we converted into a Fire-ship for the Service of the Fleet upon occasion. In that place we separated our selves for some days, as well to go and take in fresh Water, as to unlade our ships. On the 10th. we received Letters from the States, with orders to destroy all the 
Eng∣lish
 ships we could find on the Coasts of 
Gui∣ney
 and of the 
West-Indies.
 On the 6th. of 
February,
 we weighed Anchor, and set sail toward 
Cormantine,
 possessed by the 
English,
 and situa∣ted some miles from the Castle 
del Mina.
 Af∣ter noon, we past by a place belonging to the 
English
 called 
Cabo Corso,
 and near a 
Danish
 Castle, as far a as place called then 
Morea,
 but formerly 
Nassaw,
 of which the 
Dutch
 are in possession, whither after 
de Ruiter
 had sent a Letter, we continued our Course, and soon af∣ter past by the Fort 
Anamabo,
 and towards evening came to an Anchor between 
Adia
 and 
Cormantine
 which are two places possest by the 
English.
 There we found an 
English
 Ship which upon sight of us, made towards the shore, and

 all her men deserting her, retired into the Ca∣stle. The next day, 500 
Negroes,
 of the Ca∣stle 
Morea
 and 
del M
na,
 came on board Vice-Admiral 
de Ru
ter
 in their Canoes, well pro∣vided with Axes, Fire-Arms, and Colours af∣ter the 
Indian
-Mode. Upon which all our long Boats and Barges were manned out with Sol∣diers and Seamen, and Scaling Ladders were prepared for an Assault. Captain 
Vander Zaan
 Commanded the Seamen and Count 
Hoorn,
 the Soldiers. And so they Landed their Men in good order, to attack the Castle of 
Cor∣mantine.
 As soon as we were Landed the 
English
 blew up the Castle of 
Anamabo,
 which encoura∣ged us extreamly; But alas, those happy be∣ginings had not the same successes afterwards; For at our approach to 
Adia,
 the 
English
 on the one side, and the 
Negroes
 on the other, that in great Numbers appeared on the Coast, charged us so vigorously from their Lodges and Retrenchments, by continually firing upon us both with great and small shot, whilst on the other side, the Castle likewise thundred upon us with their Cannon that many of our 
Indi∣ans Canoes
 were sunk thereby, and we forced to retreat with loss back to our Ships: That day we made no other attack, but obliged our 
Negroes
 to retire on board with us, with de∣sign the next day to make a fresh Assault, as we did with more success. For in the Night some of the principal of the 
English Negroes
 came on board Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 promising him to let us Land without opposition. In answer to which welcome proffer we made them a present of a Tun of Brandy, and some glas∣ses such as the 
Negroes
 use; after which, they retired. 
De Ruiter
 observing the good dis∣position they were in towards us, Resolved to make his best advantage of it, and accordingly without losing time, ordered a second descent

 to be made. Our Whites inclusively with their Officers were 750 Men, and our Blacks 500. The 
Negroes
 that held intelligence with us put up the Princes Colours upon the Ruines of the Castle of 
Anamabo
 which had been blown up a little before, so that we Landed without any resistance from the 
Negroes,
 but yet not without a great deal of danger by reason of the Roughness of the Sea. About noon we began to come near the Castle of 
Cormantine,
 whilst some of our Ships getting in a line under the Castle as near it as possibly they could, play'd hotly upon it with their Guns, and battered it to ruin with much success. In the mean while our men marching up in a close body to the 
Negroes
 that held still for the 
English
 put them to the Rout, and forced them to Retire back towards their Commander named 
John Gabia,
 who having raised a Battery of 3 great Guns upon a hill, galled us extreamly; But our Troops despising that danger forced them at length to retire and leave their Cannon be∣hind them, and advanced just under the Ca∣stle. Our 
Negroes
 likewise fought with much bravery, set fire on the 
English Negroes
 Lod∣ges, and cut off the heads of as many of them as they could catch, and carried them away with them, leaving their Bodies in the Field of Battle, because we had promised them a fixt Reward for every Head; but several of our Negroes were likewise killed and wounded. As soon as they in the Castle per∣ceived what Progress we had made, they put up a white Flag, and demanded Quarter, so that we made our selves Masters of it with little Loss. It was defended with 32 Pieces of Cannon, and a Garrison of 52 Men. The General of the Ne∣groes, above-mentioned, having several times so∣licited the Governour to blow up the Castle, and being refused, was so enraged at it, that he cut

 two of his Childrens, and two of his Nephews Throats, and then stabbing himself several times into the Throat and Belly, he threw himself down from the Walls of the Castle, which not killing him out-right, he crept behind a Rock, and was there found dead. We gave Quarter to the 
En∣glish:
 After which, our Officers placed good Guards every where, and the better to prevent any Insolences that might happen from the Soldi∣ers, they forbad them all sorts of strong Drink. But the next Day, as our Barges drew near the Shore, to take in our Men, an infinite Number of 
Negroes
 flockt together, from all pa
ts about the Castle, and flew fiercely upon all that offered to stir out of it, cutting off the Heads of all that resisted them, without any further Ceremony; so that we lost more Men that way than we had done in the Assault. But our Men thereupon fir∣ing the Castle Guns upon them, killed and wound∣ed a great many Negroes, and put the rest to Flight; which so terrified them, that a little while after, the General of the Negroes appear∣ed before the Castle, with a white Flag, demand∣ing Peace, and free Commerce, which being granted them, they retired. And then all our Men, but what were to be left in Garrison, re∣turned again on Board the Fleet. One 
Samuel Smith,
 of 
Gravenweert,
 a native of 
Guelderland,
 and Merchant of 
Morea,
 was chosen Governour of the new-taken Castle. And then, in mark of our Victory, all the Guns were discharged both from the Castle and the Men of War. On the 12th of 
February
 we unmoored from thence, and on the 13th came to an Anchor before the Castle 
del Mina;
 where we were well received; so that after we had set all things in order there, put on Board the Chests of Gold, and taken in a Provision of fresh Water, we set sail the 27th of 
February,
 1665. tacking about to the South-ward. On the 8th of 
March
 we passed the 
Equi∣noctial

 Line,
 and on the third of 
April,
 in the Morning, the Wind being risen higher, we re∣passed it again. On the 6th of the same Month Captain 
Byland
 died▪ and the next Day his Body was committed to the Deep, in the Latitude of 1 degree and 4 minutes. On the 30th of 
April,
 about Noon, we arrived before the Island of the 
Barbados,
 where we found 40 
English,
 which we forced ashore, after some Hours firing upon them. We likewise fired so hotly upon the Castle, that we beat down the Walls, and forced the 
English
 to run away in Troops. However, the Seamen belonging to the 
English
 Ships, making at first some Resistance, we had some Men killed and wounded on our side; but when we made up towards them, to grapple them, we had like to have run aground, which obliged us to sheer off further from the Coast, and then we cast An∣chor; yet we continued to fire without Interrup∣tion, upon them, till we shattered them all to pieces. From thence we sailed away to 
Martini∣co,
 where we buried our dead Men: And after we had paid those last Honours to them, we set sail again, and took divers Prizes in the Islands of 
Montferrat, Nevis,
 and 
Guadaloupe;
 forcing them every where to flie under the Shelter of their Castles. Some we burnt, and some we sold at 
S. Martins
 and 
S. Christophers
 Islands, and the rest, that sailed well, we carried home with us. The 15th of 
June
 we arrived before 
Newfound∣land,
 where we took 8 Prizes more, seizing on their Merchandises and Effects, but burning the Ships. We found there abundance of Salt Cod, and some 
English
 Bread; which came very oppor∣tunely to us. And then unmooring, we set sail again. On the 9th of 
July
 we coasted along the Isles of 
Fero,
 and on the 23d we arrived in the Country of 
Bergen
 in 
Norway;
 where, by a Galliot that was cruising there to wait for the homeward-bound 
East-India
 Ships, we were in∣formed

 of the unfortunate Death of Admiral 
Op∣dam,
 blown up by a fatal Accident, and of the Defeat of the 
Dutch
 Fleet, by the shameful Flight and Cowardice of several Captains; upon which 
de Ruiter
 gave order to every Officer in his Squa∣dron, to make the best of their way back into their own Country, with all the sail they could. But the Calmness of the Weather, or contrary Winds, forced us to luff. In our way, from time to time, we spoke with some Barks, who inform∣ed us; That the 
English
 Fleet, being 80 Sail strong, was cruising before our Coasts; but we thank God, for having made us take Care to avoid them, fince we were in no condition to have re∣sisted them, altho' we would not have failed to do our utmost to have done it.


On the 6th of 
August,
 1665. we arrived with a contrary Wind, to the westward of 
Eems,
 be∣fore 
Delfzyl;
 where we lie expecting fresh Or∣ders.






A List of the Prizes taken, and of the Conquests made by Lieutenant Admiral 
de Ruiter
's Fleet, about the Coasts of 
Guiney,
 and elswhere.


Three Ships laden with Sugar, and two empty ones; five in the 
West-Indies,
 most of which were burnt, and three sent back again with two hundred and fifty 
English
 Prisoners, that were set at Li∣berty.


A Frigat of 18 Guns, taken in 
S. John's Bay.


Francis Stillevin,
 or 
Sullevin,
 General of 
Cor∣mantine,
 made Prisoner.


Two Castles in 
Guiney
 taken, and afterwards blown up.


Several Merchandises and Effects taken about Cape 
Verd,
 or in other Places, and among other things 16000 
l
 of Elephants Teeth,
 682 Marks of Gold, amounting very near to the Sum of 229152 Livers, besides what the Seamen plundered.






The News of 
de Ruiter
's being come home, was brought to the 
Texel
 in the Night between the 7th and 8th of 
August.
 And Pensionary 
de Wit
 writ to him the very same Night, as soon as ever he had received News of him, to desire to know of him by the same Courier, 
How many Ships, 
Dutch
 and others, were come with him to 
Delf∣zyl, &c.
 advertising him, That the States had a consi
erable Fleet in the 
Texel,
 of about 90 Sail of good Men of War, that would be ready to sail in few Days.
 This Letter was delivered to 
de Ruiter
 about the beginning of the Night, on the 9th, to which he immediately made answer, 
That he had 9 Men of War still in his Fleet that were fit to do service, only they were very foul, and want∣ed Sails, and to be new calkt. That the Men in them were in good Health, but so extremely fa∣tigued with so long a Voyage, that they would need some Days Refreshment on Shore. That, as for himself, and the rest, both of the General and Inferior Officers of the Fleet, they were in perfect Health, and still in a Condition to do their Country Service, 
&c.


The Election of a Successor to the Office of a Lieutenant-Admiral, vacant by the Death of Mr. 
Opdam,
 had a good while taken up the Coun∣cil of State, and many of the Members of the States of the Province of 
Holland
 had appeared about the middle of 
July,
 wholly inclined to confer it upon 
de Ruiter,
 even whilst he was yet abroad at Sea, so that at the News of his Arrival, without any longer Hesitation, he was on the 11th of 
Au∣gust
 chosen Lieutenant Admiral of 
Holland
 and 
West-friesland;
 to have in that Quality the chief Command of the whole Fleet, but yet under the Inspection of Mr. 
Huigens,
 Mr. 
de Wit,
 and Mr. 
Borcel,
 as Plenipotentiaries of the States; as appears by the following Resolution.




After Deliberation thereupon had, it is thought fit, That under the Super-intendence, Direction and Conduct of Mr. 
Huigens,
 Mr. Pensionary 
de Wit,
 and Mr. 
John Boreel,
 Deputies and Plenipo∣tentiaries of their High and Mightinesses in the States Fleet, 
Michael Adrian de Ruiter,
 Lieute∣nant-Admiral of 
Holland
 and 
West-friesland,
 shall command in chief during the approaching Expe∣dition; and that in this Quality he shall be ob∣liged to take the usual Oath, by vertue of the Resolution of the States General, on the 2d of this Month; having under him, for General Of∣ficers, 
Cornelius Evertsz,
 Lieutenant Admiral of 
Zealand,
 Lieutenant-Admiral 
Cornelius Tromp,
 Lieutenant-Admiral 
Meppel Tierk Hiddes,
 Lieu∣tenant-Admiral of 
West-friesland;
 the Vice Ad∣mirals, 
Van Nes, Vander Hulst, Bankert
 and 
Koenders;
 and the Rear-Admirals, 
Deliefde, Cornelius Evertsz
 the younger, and 
Bruinsveld.
 That if it shall happen by any unforeseen Acci∣dent, which God forbid, by Death or Sickness, that Lieutenant-Admir. 
de Ruiter
 shall be no longer able to perform his Office, Lieutenant-Admiral 
Tromp
 shall succeed him in the same Quality, and shall en∣joy the same Prerogatives, having the Super-inten∣dence and chief Government of the Fleet; and for that effect, as well the said Lieutenant-Admi∣ral 
de Ruiter,
 as the other General Officers shall give such good Order to the Ships depending of their respective Squadrons, that in case of any fatal Accident, as of Death, at the Hour of Bat∣tle, and when the two Fleets shall be engaged to∣gether, they may shew no manner of Consterna∣tion, or surprize, but continue still to behave themselves with Presence of Mind, and a con∣stant and firm Resolution, keeping silence till the Fleets come to be disingaged and rejoyn their Flag, or till some other favourable occasion; and then they shall give notice of it to the General that is to succeed. And the present Resolution of

 their High and Mightinesses shall be sent to the said Lieutenant-Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 with order to him to go immediately to the States Fleet, as∣sembled in the 
Texel,
 to joyn himself with their Plenipotentiaries, and to carry with him Lieute∣nant Admiral 
Meppel,
 and Vice-Admiral 
Van Nes,
 as likewise all other general Officers whom he shall judge fit to do Service in the next Expedition, provided it can be done without incommoding the Service of the Fleet, that is now riding at An∣chor at 
West Eems;
 with the Design however, and the Intention, that as well Lieutenant-Admi∣ral 
de R
iter,
 as the said Lieutenant-Admiral 
Meppel,
 Vice-Admiral 
Van Nes,
 and other Offi∣cers, shall submit to the Orders that shall be prescribed them by the Deputies of the States. And for that end, this Resolution of their High and Mightinesses, shall be sent to the said Depu∣ties, to serve them for an Instruction, whereof they are hereby ordered to cause an Extract to be delivered to every one of the General Officers of the Fleet. And the said Deputies are hereby au∣thorised, at the same time to take care that the present Resolution be executed in all its Parts, as far as 'tis possible, that the going out of the Fleet upon the approaching Expedition may in no wise be retarded; and the Dispatches resulting there-from, shall be sent away without delay, 
&c.


This Commission was immediately carried to 
de Ruiter,
 who thereupon went from 
Delfzyl
 to 
Grooningen,
 thence to 
Dockling,
 thence to 
Leeu∣warden,
 from thence he passed to 
Franeker,
 thence to 
Harlingen,
 and from thence he arrived on the 13th in the 
Texel.


In the mean while, the Deputies, the next Day, signified the said Resolution of their High and Mightinesses to all the General Officers of the Fleet in the 
Texel.
 Who all professed to be well satisfied with it, and unanimously promised to con∣form

 thereunto, except only Lieutenant-Admiral 
Tromp;
 who protested, That he pretended not to serve under the Command of Lieutenant-Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 and that he did not intend to go to Sea at all; since after he had taken so much Care and Pains to get the Fleet into a good Condition another was put up over his Head, to command above him. The Day following, as they were deliberat∣ing in his Presence about the Departure of the Fleet, he renewed his Complaints, tho' in very respectful, yet very resolute Terms; telling the Deputies, That he prayed them to be pleased to discharge him from his Employment, at least for that time, since he could not assist at that Expedition so much against his Heart, without doing extreme violence to himself. Adding, That in any other Occasions, he would never refuse to give all desirable Proofs of his Zeal, and stedfast Affection for the Service of his Country. The Deputies of the States hav∣ing conferred thereupon with the Deputies of the College of the Admiralty, represented to him, That his Honour was in that matter no way touch∣ed or offended, and therefore earnestly advised him to wave that needless and unseasonable Nicety, and to think only of doing his Duty. But he con∣tinuing still obstinately to urge a Dismission from his Employment, they at last answered him, That they had no Power to discharge him, without of∣fending against the Resolution taken by their High and Mightinesses, on the 11th of that Month; but that if he would needs persist in his Intention, he might solicit his Dismission himself, by a Letter to their High and Mightinesses. However, that up∣on such an occasion, to do him a Pleasure, they would joyn their own Instances to the States with his, by writing to them to back his Request; but that in the mean while he was obliged to stay for their Answer, or at least till their High and Migh∣tinesses should send particular Orders to their De∣puties, directing them how they should regulate

 themselves in such a Circumstance as that: And that tho' he should obtain his Discharge, yet he could not in Reason withdraw himself till after the Arrival of Lieutenant-Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 to the Fleet. After such an Answer, 
Tromp
 left the De∣puties, with a wavering Mind, whether he had best to write to the States or not.


In the mean time, the Deputies, without mind∣ing any of those private Disgusts and Differences, caused all imaginable Diligence to be used to get the Fleet into a Readiness speedily to unmoor, as being convinced by Experience, that a favourable, occa∣sion to sail out, being once neglected, was not ea∣sily to be met withal again, especially when they considered, they must be forced to stay for an East-Wind, to get out of the Harbours, and get the Fleet over the dangerous Places.


The States of 
Holland
 having been informed by a Letter from Mr. 
Witsen,
 ancient Burgo Master of 
Amsterdam,
 and from Mr. Pensionary 
de Wit,
 written from the 
Texel,
 That Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 appeared unwilling to serve at Sea under the Command of 
de Ruiter,
 signified their Thoughts thereupon to their Deputies, in the following Letter.




Noble, Magnificent, Knowing, Wise and Circumspect Lords.


WE hear, with much Displeasure and Surprize,
 that Lieutenant-Admiral 
Tromp,
 in conse∣quence of our Resolution, has taken occasion to conceive Jealousie at the Election of Lieutenant-Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 to command our Fleet in chief, making Difficulty to continue his Services, and refusing to obey him, and rather chusing not to go to Sea at all this approaching Expedition. Yet we are perswaded, that when he has seriously re∣flected upon an Affair of so great a consequence, in which he is so highly concerned to render Ser∣vice to the Publick, and to his Country, with∣out

 making any particular Reflections, disadvan∣tagious to his Reputation, he will resolve upon a wiser Conduct. But be it how it will, since the Service of our Country is now the concern to which we ought to sacrifice all sorts of particular Interest. We will, That you employ all possi∣ble Means and Ways to terminate all things, and that, without having any regard to the Person of the said Lieutenant-Admiral 
Tromp,
 whether he change his Mind, or persist imprudently to press a Dismission from his Employment, the Depar∣ture of the Fleet may not on that account be at all hindred, but rather the more hastily advanced, and put in Execution, without losing Time or Opportunity. However, we shall expect your Answer concerning the last Resolution that shall be taken by the said 
Tromp,
 that we may be able to regulate our Deliberations accordingly; hav∣ing in all other Respects a full confidence in your wise Conduct, and in the Care we doubt not but you will take to get our Fleet with all possi∣ble speed out to Sea. We recommend you to the Protection of God, 
&c.




And the Intention of the States was accordingly executed; but 
Tromp,
 whether he came to him∣self of his own accord, or were over-persuaded to it by his Friends, conformed to the Will and Plea∣sure of the States.


In the mean while there arose a great Commo∣motion among the Seamen of Lieutenant-Admiral 
Tromp
's Ship, about weighing Anchor, which they refused to do, but in the Prince of 
Orange
's Name: And their Insolence transported them so far, as to rebel against their Officers, who made a shift to appease them for a while, with gentle Words; but the Tumult began again soon after afresh, when the Cook came to serve them out their Victuals: For not being content with what was given them, they ran with their Porringers, to the Captain's

 Cabbin, making a horrid Noise, till at last the Of∣ficers, taking notice who were the Ringleaders of the Disorder, seized them, and put them in Hold, in order to have them punished according to their Deserts; and a Council of War being called to sit upon them, after having heard the Criminals, on the 11th of 
August,
 condemned two of the most faulty of them, to be hanged, to serve for an Ex∣ample to all the rest of the Seamen and Soldiers. For that effect, two Bills were put into a Dish, cover∣ed with a Napkin, whereof one had in it the figure of a Gallows, and the other was a Blank, and they being made to draw for their Lives, he that drew the Gal∣lows was hanged on the Main Yard, and the other was whipt, markt with the States Arms, and then turned ashore, as unworthy to serve any more.


3 Days after, being the 14th of the Month, a great part of the Fleet put out to Sea, and the Day after the rest followed them, to which the indefatigable Care of Mr. Pensionary 
de Wit
 did not a little con∣tribute, by the singular Pains he took to see all the Parts of the 
Texel
 sounded, through which they were to pass; where he found in some Places 4 Foot of Water more than the Sounders ever found before, which in all likelihood happened by their Carelesness, so that it was thought not im∣possible to get out at 28 Points of the Compass. The Fleet was then composed of 96 Sail of Men of War, and 22 Fireships and Advice Yachts, and was divided into 3 Squadrons.


We shall here, by the way, desire you to take notice, That the Commander 
Vander Hulst
 had been not long before made Vice-Admiral by the States of 
Holland,
 for the College of the Admi∣ralty of 
Amsterdam,
 in the Place of 
Tromp,
 who was raised to the Dignity of Lieutenant-Admiral of the 
Meuse,
 vacant by the Death of 
Kortenaar,
 and that 
Cornelius Evertzen
 had been named by the College of 
Zealand,
 to supply the Place of his Brother 
John Evertsz,
 in Quality of Lieutenant-Admiral,

 who was dispensed with from serving in this Expedition.


When the Fleet was at Sea, the States Pleni∣potentiaries, in conjunction with Lieutenant-Ad∣miral 
Tromp,
 and the other General Officers, made a Regulation, and establisht an Order, according to which, the Chiefs of Squadrons and other Cap∣tains were to act during a Fight. It was there sp
cified, what Squadron it was, that when they were right before the Wind, should keep to the Right or the Left of Lieutenant-Admiral 
Tromp
's Squadron; and in time of a Calm, which Squa∣dron should go before, which in the middle, and which behind; at what Signal, and in what order the Squadrons, if it were thought fit, should tack about; in what Order the Squadrons should make Sail in case their Fleet got the Weathergage of the Enemies, to keep that Advantage; that every Cap∣tain should keep a watchful Eye upon the Chief of his respective Squadron, without recoiling before the Enemy, observing him always, unless he be forced to do otherwise by extreme Necessity, upon default of which, he should be punished with Death; that each Lieutenant Admiral should pre∣sently divide his Squadron between his Vice and Real Admirals, to prevent all Surprise, and to be always in a posture to fight, if the Enemies should on a sudden present themselves to him; that eve∣ry Captain should take care to keep at a fit distance and to gain Sea-room enough, that their Ships might not fall foul on one another, nor be incom∣moded with one another's Guns. That each Lieu∣tenant-Admiral should establish an Order in his Squadron, according to which, the Fireships s
all be obliged to regulate themselves, and shall have always Frigats ready to save the Men, when any Ship should happen to be burnt or sunk; in what manner they were to govern themselves in case their Fleet should happen to have the Wea∣thergage of the Enemies, and they should come by

 the Lee, in order to preserve that Advantage: What Squadron, if the fleet made to the left-hand, should go before or behind the other Squadrons, which should have the Disadvantage of the Wind: What Order the Squadrons should observe, if the 
Dutch
 Fleet should make towards the right-hand, and the Enemy should be to the Leeward; at what Signal each particular Squadron, and at what Signal the main Body of the Fleet should attack that of the Enemies; or that every one should fall to board∣ing them: That every one should observe his Rank and keep near the Chief of his Squadron, whe∣ther there be any Enemy near or no, upon Pain of being fined 100 Livers, for the first Default, 200 Livers for the second, and of being cashiered from his Employment, for the third, whatsoever Excuse he could alledge to justifie himself: That the General Officers should every Day detach out some of the best Sailers and some Galliots, to go a scouting to discover the Enemy; and that as soon as they hear any thing new they shall give notice of it to the States Deputies, and to the Lieutenant-Ad∣miral: That if any of the Frigats, detached to go a scouting after the Enemies, should chance to make Prize, during their Course, of any Merchants Ships that should be declared good Prize; that then the Booty should be divided among the Ships of the Squadron from which the detachment was made; that if the said Frigats should happen to take a Man of War, they should not only remain Posses∣sors of her, and of her Guns, but should also have over and above that, the sum ordered by the Estates in that case, for a Reward: That besides, if any one should have received a dangerous Shot in his Ship, or by any other dismal Accident, find himself forced to quit the Enemy, for want of Help, he should be obliged to put up a Flag upon the Poop▪ which yet he should not do but at the last Extre∣mity. In fine, that none should offer to give Ch
ce to any of the Enemies Ships, ti
 Li
utenant Admi∣ral

 
Tromp
 should have given order for so doing, by firing a Signal-Gun, and that in such a Rencoun∣ter those Ships that should happen to be nearest the Enemies Ships should give them Chace: That upon the Discovery of one of the Enemies Ships, two of the 
Dutch
 should be detached after it, if two, three; and if three, four should be sent after them, and so proportionably for more, always taking care to detach those Ships against them that should be nearest to the Ships they should desire to give Chace to.


Lieutenant-Admiral 
Tromp
 was considered in that Regulation as the chief Commander of the Fleet, and all was done in his Name, because Lieu∣tenant-Admiral 
de Ruiter
 was not yet come thither. 
Tromp
 also established an Order concerning the general 
Rendezvous
 of the Fleet, in Case of Sepa∣ration by Tempest, or by the Darkness of the Night that should make them lose Sight of their Flag. And that Order was regulated according to Times, Opportunities, and the Winds that should happen to prevail.


Lieutenant-Admiral 
de Ruiter
 arrived in the 
Texel,
 the 16th of 
August,
 where there were left three Frigats, to conduct him to the Fleet, but by a contrary Wind he was detained till next day Morning, when he set sail accompanied with 
Van Nes,
 who had taken the Oath in Quality of Vice-Admiral of the 
Meuse,
 at the same time that 
de Ruiter
 was sworn in the 
Texel,
 before the Depu∣ties of the States General, in quality of Lieutenant Admiral of 
Holland
 and 
West-friesland,
 to com∣mand in Chief. He therefore went to the Mouth of the 
Spanish Hole,
 where he went on Board the Frigat, 
Schiedam,
 carrying 25 Guns and 81 Men, and the next Morning he arrived on Board the Ship called the 
Amity,
 then commanded by Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 where he was received by the De∣puties of the States with great Demonstrations of Kindness. 
Tromp
 likewise shewed a great deal of

 good Temper and Moderation towards him, by smothering in Silence a part of his Resentments, which already gave the Nation great Hopes they would shortly be perfectly reconciled.


Whilst things were thus passing on the Side of the 
Ʋnited Provinces,
 the 
English
 Fleet, under the Command of the Admirals, 
Mountague, Pen,
 and 
Allen,
 had made an Excursion towards the North, to cruise there against the Ships belonging to the 
Dutch East-India
 Company, that were expected coming homewards; but they having had time∣ly notice of it by some 
Dutch
 Galliots, happily retired into the Harbour of 
Bergen
 in 
Norway,
 to the Number of 10 Ships; and two more belong∣ing to the same Company went into 
Drontheim;
 and besides them, there were 60 Merchant-ships more richly laden, bound homewards to 
Holland.
 The Admirals of the 
English
 Fleet, upon that News, were desperately enraged they had let slip so rich a Booty out of their Chops, so that calling a Coun∣cil of War, they resolved to attack the 
Dutch
 in the Bay, whether they could get the Governour of 
Bergen
's consent or no, with Design and Hopes to take, or at least burn and destroy their Fleet there. They sent therefore to the said Governour, named 
Aleveld,
 to desire his Consent to their Enterprize, who being unprovided then with Guns and Ammu∣nition sufficient to resist them, held them off 3 Days with fair Words, telling them, He durst not let them attempt upon any Ships in that his Master's Port, without express Orders from his Majesty, to whom he would send to know his Pleasure about it, conjuring them, in the mean time, not to offer by any Hostility to violate the Liberty of his Master's Harbours. But after 3 Days, during which he had supplied himself with Guns, Powder and all other Necessaries from the 
Dutch
 Ships and elsewhere, having sent the 
English
 a flat Refusal, they detached away Captain 
Tyddeman
 with a Squadron of 14 Men of War with 3 Fireships and 2

 Advice Boats who entered boldly into the bay, with∣out sparing the 
Danes
 their Allies any more than the 
Hollanders
 their Enemies. The Circumstances of what passed in that occasion, are related in the following Letter written by the General Offi∣cers that Commanded the 
Dutch East-India
 Fleet.




SIR,


THE 
English
 having had advice, that we were arrived here with a Fleet of 10 ships from the 
East-Indies,
 were in an unconceivable vexa∣tion at it; so that the day before yesterday they came and posted themselves between the two Castles that defend the entrance of the Port, with a Squadron of 14 Men of War, 3 Fire-ships, and 4 Advice Yachts, making in all 21 sail, and fell upon our Fleet with so much fury, that we were forced to stand up in our own defence, and by the help of the Castles, and of some batteries we had raised on shore against them with Guns drawn out of our ships we repulsed them with so much success, that after a fight of about 3 hours and a half, they were forced to cut their Cables, and shamefully betake themselves to flight. We are told for certain, that whilst they were retreating 3 of their Ships sunk, whereof one carried an Ad∣mirals Flag. It appears by the marks of their defeat, that they were very severely handled, since 30 of their dead men were cast ashore by the Waves, who were strip'd by the Inhabi∣tants, and 6 of their ships were so battered, that they were forced to Anchor, at about 3 miles from hence, to patch themselves up again as well as they could, being able no longer to keep the Sea.


We had in this fight 25 men killed, and 70 wounded; and we lost the Merchant, Mr. 
Pe∣ter de Sandvlied,
 after he had shewn a great

 deal of Bravery. The Masts, Sails and Rig∣ging of our ships are extreamely endamaged, so that they will take us up several days time to repair them. We have reason to thank God for having so powerfully protected us. A Merchant ship of 
Lisbon,
 Commanded by the Master 
Ruth Maximilian,
 fought valiantly af∣ter the Example of our men, and so did General 
Alefelt,
 and the Governour 
Van Steignon,
 who after he had done all he could to divert the 
English
 from their design by fair words, with∣out any effect, have at last by the force of their Arms, and the powerfull Rhetorick of the Cannon of their Castles, maintained their rights, and the Protection they had granted to strangers, so that all things succeeded to the honour of the Victors. Three Months pay Extraordina∣ry was granted on this occasion both to the Sea∣men of our ships, as of those of the Merchants, by way of reward for their good Service, who were employed either on board our ships, or else on shore in managing the Batteries there erected for our defence; which is to be paid by all the ships which are here and we hope you will not take that proceeding ill from us, since it was put in practice only to raise the Courage of the men in that pressing occasion, and to in∣cite them the more vigorously to repulse a bold and potent Enemy who came with a greedy and eager Appetite, to seize upon so much riches, the loss of which would have been very heavi∣ly sensible to you. The bearer of these dis∣patches can inform you more fully of the other Circumstances of this Fight, because he was an Eye-Witness of all that passed in it. Up∣on the Advice we have had from several Persons, that past last 
Sunday
 near the Enemies Fleet, about 20 miles to the Westward of 
Schuitenes,
 we thought we had some reason to fear, they would attempt a second charge upon us; which

 makes us put in practice all things that may tend to secure our preservation; having for that effect, pray'd the Governour to Order the Barrier to be repaired that shuts up the Port, that so being shut up, we may be in safe shel∣ter from Fire-ships. We also have intreated him to repair the works and Batteries, and put them into a better condition, as likewise to cause some new works to be raised in convenient pla∣ces, to plant Cannon upon. And he has assu∣red us, he will take care to have all things done that may contribute to the security of the Ha∣vens of the King his Master; that we are at present busied in transporting to shore 20 peices of Cannon out of our ships and 10 more out of the Merchants ships, which we can very well spare by reason of the smallness of the Port, to be employed there in our defence; we will likewise endeavour to make a Fire-ship if we can perswade one of our Merchants to give us his ship for that use. All things being so Ordered, we hope under the Protection of God sufficiently to provide for the security of so rich a Booty as that intrusted with us, by vigorously repulsing the attacks of the 
English
 in which we implore the assistance and blessing of God; and we promise on our part to contri∣bute thereto with all that shall lie in our pow∣er, 
&c.




The 
English
 lost in that attack, 2 Captains, with one of 
Mountague
's Sons, and 3 men of War, whereof one stuck in the Rocks, out of which the 
Dutch
 took the Guns, to employ them in their own defence. And the Wooden Posts that formed the Barrier of the Haven were Re∣implaced in Order to secure the Fleet from the 
English
 Fire-ships. But they durst not venture upon another charge, but tackt about towards their main Fleet, quitting the Rocks of 
Norway
 to

 make the best of their way towards their own Country: And so by that means the 
Dutch
 ships that were pregnant with immense Riches, the ships alone that came from the 
East-Indies,
 being valu∣ed at above 12 Millions of Livers, or one Mil∣lion Sterling, were delivered from the disasters, that threatned them. When Admiral 
de Ruiter
 was arrived in the Fleet, as we have said, it was thought fit, by the Advice of all the rest of the General Officers, that the States Deputies and Lieutenant Admiral 
de Ruiter
 should remove out of the ship 
Amity,
 into the 
Delfland,
 called for∣merly, the 
Great Spaniard,
 and that each Squa∣dron of the Fleet should make a detachment of 7 Frigats, or bigger Men of War, with some Fire-ships, to form a 4th. Squadron for Admi∣ral 
de Ruiter,
 who had to Command it under him, 
Aart Van Nes,
 Vice-Admiral of the 
Meuse,
 and 
Frederick Staghouwer,
 Rear-Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of the North. They likewise regulated the placing of the Flags, or∣dering, that Admiral 
de Ruiter
's Squadron should bear it on their main mast; that of Lieutenant Admiral 
Cornelius Evertsz,
 on their mizzen-mast, the Squadron of Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 on the Poop, and that of Lieutenant Admiral 
Tierk Hiddes,
 on the Fore mast.


All the World begun already to conceive great Hopes of so formidable a Fleet, commanded by 2 of the greatest men of the Age, and directed by the Council of the wisest Deputies of the State.


Things being in that Condition, there Re∣mained nothing but to form some Noble Enter∣prize that might raise the Glory of the Chief∣tains, and the Courage of the Seamen that was pall'd by the ill success of the last fight. And accordingly the Deputies, and Admiral 
de Rui∣ter
 with the rest of the General Officers of the Fleet Resolved to sail towards the Coasts of 
England
 or 
Scotland,
 as thinking they might meet

 at some advantage with the 
English
 Fleet, as they were supposed to be coming back laden with the spoils of the 
Dutch East-India
 ships, or at least might succour these latter and rescue them out of the Enemies hands. That project seemed well contrived, but a contrary Wind hindred the exe∣cution of it, for growing more boisterous and turning quite opposite against them, it was im∣possible for the Fleet to steer to the North-ward; which at the same time favoured the retreat of the 
English.
 On the 25th. of the Month of 
August,
 the Advanc'd guard of the 
Dutch
 Fleet having pursued two 
English
 Advice Yachts, took them, and by their means were informed, that the 
English
 Fleet consisting of a∣bout 70 sail of Men of War, had been cruiz∣ing some days upon the Coast of 
Norway,
 to hunt after the 
East-India
 ships; but that af∣terwards pursuing their course on the 18th. to∣wards 
Hitland,
 they came to an Anchor in the bay of 
Breezond,
 having left upon the Coasts of 
Norway
 a Squadron of 20 ships under the Com∣mand of Captain 
Tyddeman;
 and that on the 23d. having unmoored from 
Hitland,
 they put out to Sea again. On the 25th. of the same Month, the Advanced guard of the 
Dutch
 Fleet discovered an 
English
 man of War of the white Squadron, so that they found by that, the two Fleets were pretty near one another, yet with∣out being able to see one another, or to disco∣ver what course each other steer'd. During these transactions, the 
Dutch
 resolved to sail with all possible diligence towards 
Bergen,
 in hopes to meet and maul the small 
English
 Squadron in those parts; and accordingly on the 29th. the 
Hol∣land
 Fleet arrived upon the Coast of 
Norway,
 and heard there by the report of some Galliots, that the 
English
 had attack the 
Dutch
 homeward bound 
East-India
 ships in the Port of 
Bergen,
 as likewise other 
Dutch
 Merchant ships that were

 retired thither, but that, after a fight of 3 hours and a half, they were forced to cut their Anchor Cables, and shamefully to flie away with con∣siderable loss and damage. So, that the 
Dutch
 Fleet had not only mist of the 
English
 Fleet, but arrived too late before 
Bergen,
 to attach 
Tyd∣deman.


In the mean time the States Deputies received a Letter from Captain 
Bitter
 that Commanded in chief the East-
India
 ships; who signified to them, that since the fight with the 
English,
 things there went very strangely: For that Mr. 
Ale∣felt
 or 
Aleveld,
 General of the 
Danish
 Troops in 
Norway,
 and Mr. 
Steignon,
 Governour of the Town and Castles of 
Bergen,
 who told the 
Dutch
 very roundly, that if they expected they should continue their care to protect them from the oppression of the 
English,
 they must pay them down on the nail the sum of 100000 Crowns to satisfie them and the rest of the Officers and Soldiers for the pains and hazard they had been at in their defence; and that when they should have received that money, they would be ready to sacrifice their Lives and Estates against all that should attempt upon the liberty of their Harbours adding, that for the love they had to the United Provinces, they would act freely with them and without any manner of dissimula∣tion; That the 
English
 from whom they had much more advantageous Offers, if they would accept them, were but two or three miles from 
Ber∣gen:
 And that the account they were to render to the King their Master about observing a Neu∣trality was not the least bar to them in that case; that therefore they expected the 
Dutch
 should immediately satisfie their demand in ready cash or upon their default, they knew where to fur∣nish themselves, and in two days time would ob∣lige them to make a serious reflection upon the premisses, 
&c.




Bitter
 added, that he had answered them that the 
Dutch
 Merchants there were not in a con∣dition out of their own Money to pay so con∣siderable a sum; that a recompence of such a value as that was the concern of the State a∣lone, and that no private Person ought to med∣dle with it. However he told his Masters that he had endeavoured to drill on the affair with them to what length he could, by paying them 3000 Crowns in hand, and that they were ma∣king a Collection of 8 or 10000 Crowns more amongst the Merchant men come from 
Spain,
 which sum was to be imployed in fortifying the Castle where a great many men were already at work for that effect, 
&c.


The States had named Lieutenant Colonel 
de Gent,
 the Colonels 
Dolman,
 and 
Maregnault
 the Lieutenant Colonel 
de Santen,
 and Serjeant Ma∣jor 
Wynbergen,
 to Command the Troops on board their Fleet. And before the Deputies had received 
Bitter
's Letter, they had sent the first of those Officers to the Governour of 
Bergen
 to compliment him in their Name, and to return him thanks for the Protection he had granted to the 
Dutch
 ships in his Port, and to desire him at the same time to continue it, and to order things so, that the Merchant Fleet there might speedily be dismist out of that Harbour, and sail out to secure themselves under the Admiral Flag of the States Grand Fleet. Mr. 
de Gent
 was accordingly re∣ceived by the Governour with great marks of respect: Upon which the Deputies having some reliance, writ to 
Bitter
 to use all the diligence he could to get the Ships out of that Port, as being perswaded the 
Danes
 would not offer to oppose their going; but withal assuring him, that if he feared they would make any difficulty to let them quietly depart, that they might expect all the assistance imaginable from the powerfull Fleet that was so near at hand, at their disposal. But

 alas the very noise alone of the arrival of that Fleet upon the Coasts of 
Norway,
 made Affairs there change face immediately, and after that the 
Dutch
 heard no more from the 
Danes
 of their demand of 100000 Crowns. On the contrary, they agreeably and obligingly consented to the departure of their Merchant ships, but yet they re∣fused to restore 41 pieces of Cannon that the 
Hollanders
 had drawn out of their East-
India,
 and other Merchant ships, to be imployed part∣ly in the Castle, and partly in Batteries rais∣ed on the shore, during the late fight with the 
English.
 For when the 
Dutch
 redemanded them, the 
Danes
 answered, that they had need of them themselves for their own defence against the 
Eng∣lish,
 whom they had incensed against them up∣on their account; so that with all the 
Dutch
 could do or say, they could never perswade them to part with them again.


After the 
East-India
 and other Merchant ships had joyned the Grand Fleet of men of War, they unmoor'd from the Bay of 
Bergen,
 at the beginning of 
September,
 and about 4 days after were saluted by so terrible a Tempest that they were almost all entirely scattered one from an∣other. And besides the loss of two Fire-Ships that were cast away, there were many Ships shrewdly endamaged. Two 
East-India
 Ships, 
viz.
 The 
Golden Phoenix,
 and the Fort of 
Hu∣ningen,
 and 4 men of War, 
viz.
 the 
West-Fries∣land,
 the 
Groningen,
 the 
De Zevenwolden,
 and the 
Hope,
 being separated from the Admiral's Flag, by the ill Weather, fell into the hands of the 
English
 near the Dogger-Sand. And some days after, the Ships, 
Huis te Swieten,
 the 
Cavaleer
 of 
Guelders
 the 
St. Paul of Zealand,
 and the 
St. Paul of Enkhuizen,
 together with 3 Merchant Ships, 2 Fire Ships, 
&c.
 were likewise taken, being drawn into the snare by the treachery of a Pilot of 
Bremen,
 who being askt, whether he could

 tell any news of the 
English?
 answered, that he had seen them pass by about 80 sail strong, and so councelling them to steer to the East-South-East, cruelly betrayed the 
Hollanders,
 by send∣ing them into their Enemies mouths. However the 
Dutch
 grand Fleet made a shift to get back about the 24 of 
September,
 and to come most part of them to an Anchor, in 
Goree,
 without coming to any Action, except it were Vice-Ad∣miral 
Van Nes,
 who fired some Guns upon some 
English
 Ships that would have taken from him two 
East-India
 Ships, but no fight ensued, because the 
English
 thought fit to sheer off, and leave them to pursue their voyage.


A little time after, the taking of those Ships, the 
English
 Fleet steer'd away homewards for their own Harbours, and on the 21st. at night the Earl of 
Sandwich
 came to an Anchor in 
Sol∣bay,
 with a Squadron of 18 men of War, two 
East-India
 Ships, and some other prizes taken from the 
Hollanders,
 as appears by the Letter he writ from thence to General 
Monk,
 whereof here follows the Copy.




May it please your Excellence,


I Hope my last, dated the 5th. of this month, was delivered you, by which I informed you of the taking of the Vice and Rear Admirals of the 
Dutch East-India
 Fleet, 4 of their men of War, and 3 or 4 other Merchant Ships. Since which on 
Saturday
 the 9th. Instant at night, we met 18 sail more most of which were taken, and a∣mongst them, a man of War of 70 Guns, another of 40, and some 
West-India
 Ships laden with Ammunition and Provisions for the Fleet. As for this last rencounter I cannot yet tell you all the Circumstances of it, because the Wind rising in the night, and the darkness redoubling, we were separated one from an other. But God be thank∣ed,

 that he was pleased to be so gracious as to conduct me back to Anchor here last Night with a Fleet of Eighteen Sail, having with me, the 
Royal Sovereign,
 2 
East-India
 Ships, and some other Men of War, taken from the 
Hollanders:
 We discover at present some Ships at Sea, making all the Sail they can to come in hither, so that I doubt not but God will grant them that Favour, supposing them to be some of our own; but yet I cannot discern any of the White and Blew Squadrons, except only that of the Rear-Admiral of the Blue Squadron. I have resolved to send the Great Ships with the Prizes, into the River of 
Chattam,
 on the first Opportu∣nity, and to leave the most part of the small Frigats at 
Hartly-Bay,
 and 
Harwich.
 We have made 1000 Prisoners on board our last Prizes. I recommend your Excellence to the Protection of God Almighty, 
&c.




Thus the 
English
 retired into their Harbours, laden with the Spoils of the 
Hollanders.
 In which Transaction, it seems something strange, the two Fleets should come so near one another with∣out fighting, since their Vanguards were sometimes near enough to have engaged; but it is thought the 
English
 intended nothing less than a Fight, when they saw so fair an Occasion to make a Rich Booty without it.


In the mean while, the 
Dutch
 used all imagina∣ble Industry, to assemble their Fleet before 
Goree,
 and to get them in readiness to go out once more in search after the 
English,
 and to engage them, if possible, to a Battle. But a horrible Tempest a∣rising on the 29th of 
September,
 so endamaged most of their Ships, that they were glad to retire again into their Ports. But however, 
de Ruiter,
 in spite of all those cross and mischievous Acci∣dents, unmoored on the 5th of 
October
 following, from before 
Goree,
 to go into the 
Texel,
 and joyn

 the other fresh Ships there, with Design after he had taken in a Supply of necessary Provisions, to sail out with them towards the Coasts of 
England.
 And on the 11th the 
Dutch
 Fleet, consisting of about 90 Sail of Men of War, weighed Anchor, with a Resolution, to go and attack the 
English,
 at 
Solbay,
 at 
Harwich,
 in the 
Thames,
 or in the 
Downs;
 for which effect, the States Deputies had taken care to detach away some Yachts and Galliots, to go out a scouting towards those Pla∣ces, and to get what Intelligence they could of the 
English,
 and to spie out the Number of their Ships. And one of those Yachts and a Galliot, being re∣turned, met the Grand Fleet on the 12th off of 
Schoowen,
 and reported, They had seen 23 
English
 Ships behind the Banks of 
Harwich,
 and that some 
French
 Fishermen had assured them, The 
English
 Fleet was not yet come out. Relying upon that Report, the 
Hollanders
 appeared on the 15th be∣tween 
Yarmouth
 and 
Laystoff,
 where they took a small Bark, and enquiring of the Prisoners taken in it, how all things stood, they answered, That they knew nothing but only that the great 
English
 Men of War had orders not to stir out, and that there were none at all on the Northern Coasts; that the last week before there died in 
London
 9000 People of the Plague, and that several other great Towns in the Kingdom were afflicted with the same pernicious Disease. The next Day, the Fleet ad∣vanced towards 
Solbay,
 where they found no Ships at all. In the mean while, all the Coast was in an alarm; and the People of 
Suffolk
 were up in Arms, and had fired the Beacons all-a-long the Sea-Coast, to give notice to the Inhabitants, that the Enemy was upon their Coast. On the same Day, 16 of the King's Ships having had notice of the Approach of the 
Holland
 Fleet, unmoored from 
Harwich,
 and retired into the 
Thames.
 On the 17th the 
Dutch
 were resolved to make sail towards 
Har∣wich,
 across the Banks, but were hindred by a

 contrary Wind; and therefore steered towards the 
Thames,
 where they saw 13 
English
 Men of War go in, which they could not possibly inter∣cept, because our Men were near 3 Miles off from the Body of the Grand Fleet. It was supposed, they were the Ships that were come from 
Harwich.
 The next night, the 
Dutch
 Fleet anchored at the Mouth of the River, and on the 18th they unmoor∣ed, and made off for the 
Downs,
 thinking to block up the Passage thither, and to surprize the 
English
 Ships they should find there. But that Project was broken either by contrary Winds, or Calms, if it had not been for which they might have taken 5 
English
 Men of War and 3 or 4 Privateers, who by that means had time to escape. However, the Fleet returned again to the 
Thames;
 and on the last Day of the Month, the Lords Deputies, with the Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 went on Board the Frigat 
Gornichem,
 and with 3 Galliots accompanying them, advanced a great way up the River, follow∣ed at a distance by 
de Ruiter
's and 
Tromp
's Squa∣drons. About a mile from thence they found the River very large and deep, and the next evening after they had taken a View of all things, they re∣turned to the Fleet. But all those Precautions were but needless, because they were founded only upon the Advice they had had, that an 
English
 Fleet, to the Number of about 60 Sail, of stout Men of War, was ready to sail out of the 
Thames,
 with intent to give Battle to the 
Hollanders,
 and chase them from the Coasts of 
England;
 which proved false, for they offered not to stir out.


In the mean time 
Winter
 was coming on, and Mortal Diseases began cruelly to rage in the Fleet; where 140 Seamen were already dead, 355 had been sent back sick into 
Holland,
 and there were reckoned 970 more to remain still in the Fleet. Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 had 34 Sick on board him, besides 33 more he had sent home before. On the 1st of 
November,
 all the General and In∣ferior

 Officers in the Fleet were summoned on Board the Admiral, to give him a more particular account what condition they were in, by whose Report it appeared, That some Captains who had all their Men healthy and sound, but on the 27th of the last Month, complained, that since that time they had had one with another 40 Men apiece sick on board them. And Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 was one of the most unfortunate in that Rencounter, having in two days time 50 Soldiers taken sick in his Ship alone. Vice-Admiral 
Ban∣kert
 reported likewise, That the Day before 20 of his Men had had the same Misfortune. So that every Captain complaining in that manner of the number of sick Men they had on Board their re∣spective Ships, the Deputies, and the Generals of the Fleet, judged thereupon, That it was impossi∣ble to remedy those Disasters, and that therefore it was best for them to retire home, and that so much the rather, because the 
English
 appeared not at Sea, and that the Tempestuous Weather, that coming on with the 
Winter,
 would not permit them to stay any longer there. Pursuant to which Resolu∣tion, 6 light Frigats, and 4 Galliots were detach∣ed away to go and cruise for 3 Days at the Mouth of the 
Thames,
 both to advertise the Ships that might have been sent from 
Holland
 to the Fleet, and to seek out the Ships that belonged to the Flag, to give them notice of the Departure of the Fleet. They thought likewise fit to order a Squadron of 18 Ships, whose Men were as yet all sound, to keep the Sea three Weeks longer; the Command of which was given to 
Sweers,
 who was made Rear-Admiral of the Admiralty of 
Amsterdam,
 up∣on the Death of 
de Wilde.
 He had Orders to cruise about the 
Dogger sand
 till the begin∣ning of 
December,
 and to do his best to go to meet the Ships bound homewards from the 
East-Indies,
 and that were expected back from 
Norway,
 in order to convoy them safe home; and at the same

 time, to have an Eye upon the 
English
 Merchant-Ships, coming out of the 
Sound,
 or from 
Ham∣borough,
 towards the 
Thames,
 or that should come out of the 
Thames,
 to go towards the North, commanding him to give them Chace, and to do all he could to burn them, sink them, 
&c.


The same Day, 
viz.
 the 1st of 
November,
 after∣noon, the Fleet set sail, and tackt about, and stood to the Eastward. Lieutenant Admiral 
Cornelius Evertsz
 led the Right Wing, Lieutenant Admiral 
de Ʋries
 the left, and the Squadrons of 
de Ruiter
 and 
Tromp
 composed the Main Battle. The next Day 
de Ruiter
 put up a White Flag upon his Miz∣zen Mast, and fired 3 Guns for a Signal to the Squa∣drons to separate. The Lieutenant Admirals, 
Tromp, Evertsz,
 and 
de Ʋries
 answered the Ad∣miral, according to the Order settled for that ef∣fect, each of them with 7 Guns, Each Vice-Admi∣ral with 5, and each Rear-Admiral with 3. And then Admiral 
de Ruiter
 replied to all those Admirals, again, at once, with 9 Guns; and so the several Squadrons of the Fleet quitted one another about Mid-way towards home; 
Tromp
 made towards 
Goree,
 and the 
Meuse,
 the 
Zealand
 Squadron to∣wards 
W
elingen,
 and 
de Ruiter
 sailed towards the 
Texel
 and the 
Ʋlie,
 whither also went Lieutenant Admiral 
Hiddes de Ʋries,
 with the 
Friesland
 Ships.


The Lords Deputies of the States having quitted 
de Ruiter,
 landed on the 4th of 
November
 in a Galliot at the 
Helder,
 and thence went to the 
Hague,
 where they made their Report to the States General of what had passed in that Expedition, for which they received the Thanks of their High and Mightinesses, as appears by the following Writing.


Mr. 
Huigens,
 Mr. Pensionary 
de Wit,
 and Mr. 
John Boreel,
 Deputies Plenipotentiaries of their High and Mightinesses in the States Fleet, have made a Summary Report of the things that passed in the

 last Expedition, upon which the States having delibe∣rated, and taken into Consideration the Care and Pains the said Plenipotentiaries have therein taken, as well as the Vigilance and good Conduct they have shewn by the tender Affection they have exprest for their Country, by acting Night an Day, as far as God, and the State of Affairs would permit them, with an inde∣fatigable Zeal for the Good of the State, their High and Mightinesses have consequently thankt them for it, and hereby declare themselves perfectly well sa∣tisfied with their Admin
strat
on.


The 
Dutch
 Fleet then did nothing that Expe∣dition, but cause some Alarms upon the Coast of 
En∣gland,
 and all the Honour they gained by it was only that of having offered Battle to the 
English
 Fleet, whilst they kept themselves within their Harbours, as being debarred by a raging and pestilent Distem∣per from accepting it, and having interrupted the Commerce of the 
English
 Merchants, by keeping the Mouth of the 
Thames
 blockt up for about 16 Days together. In the mean while, the Negotia∣tion for a Peace was broke off; for the 
French
 King, who had offered his Mediation, finding that the 
English
 had more Inclination to continue the War, than to treat with the 
Dutch,
 and having some By-ends of his own upon the 
Hollanders,
 tak∣ing a Pretence of Dissatisfaction against the 
En∣glish,
 because their Ships daily appeared near 
S. Ma∣lo's
 and the Coasts of 
Normandy,
 firing upon his Subjects, and committing several Attempts against them, contrary to the Treaties of Alliance and Confederacy he had with the King of 
England,
 recalled the Duke of 
Vernueil,
 the Count 
de Con∣ings,
 and Mr. 
Courtin,
 his Ambassadors from that Court, after having commanded them publickly to declare to the King of 
England,
 which they ac∣cordingly did on the 15th of 
October
 at 
Oxford;
 
That the King of 
France
 their Master, seeing all the Propositions that had been made to procure

 an Accommodation between the 2 contending Na∣tions of 
England
 and 
Holland
 were rejected by the 
English,
 his Majesty was resolved to assist the 
Hollanders,
 according to the Treaty of Alliance he was engaged in with them.
 To which the King of 
England
 answered coldly enough, 
That the
 French 
King knew his own Interest, and so did the King of
 England 
know his too.
 So that the 
French
 Ambassadours having demanded their Audience of Leave on the 10th of 
December,
 embarkt on the 23d of the same Month, at 
Dover,
 and arrived the next Day at 
S. Valery. Hollis
 likewise, the 
English
 Ambassadour in 
France,
 was also recalled, and having had his Audience of Leave, he made shew as if he would depart, but yet took the Li∣berty to stay 6 Months after, in the Kingdom, out of 
Paris,
 under Pretence of his Lady's being sick.


The 
French
 King having notified to the States, the recalling of his Ambassadours out of 
England,
 they sent Order to the Sieur 
de Goch,
 their Ambas∣sadour at the Court of 
England,
 to retire likewise immediately. For tho' Sir 
George Downing,
 Am∣bassadour to them from the King of 
England,
 were gone from 
Holland
 ever since the Month of 
Au∣gust,
 yet the States of the 
Ʋnited Provinces,
 in hopes to be able to pacifie, in an amicable manner, the Troubles that had newly kindled a War be∣tween the 2 Nations, had thitherto deferred the Departure of the Sieur 
de Goch,
 but at last he took his Audience of Leave at 
Oxford,
 and delivered at the same time to the King, the following Decla∣ration of the States; by which they represented to his Majesty the ardent Passion they had for Peace, and the means that had been proposed to procure it. The Sieur 
de Goch
 then departed, on the 26th of 
December
 towards 
Dover,
 where he embark'd upon one of the King's Ships, and on the 29th of the same Month he arrived at 
Flushing,
 from whence he speeded away to the 
Hague,
 to

 make his Report to their High and Mightinesses, of all that had past in his Negotiation.


The Letter or Declaration from the States, left by him with the King of 
England
 was in these Terms.




SIR,


THat we might give evident Proofs of our Desire and Inclination for Peace, we were willing after the Rupture, to defer even till this Day, to recal our Ambassadour from the Court of 
England.
 And tho' we had already by just and reasonable Of∣fers, satisfied all the Complaints put up to us by Sir 
George Downing,
 in a Time when we could hardly believe, that Matters would ever have come to an Extremity; yet we have done still more, by leaving our Ambassadour in 
England,
 after the tak∣ing from us not only several Places, but some whole Provinces belonging to the States in both Worlds, and the stopping the Ships of their Subjects in the Face of all Christendom, and that without any previous Declaration of War. By an effect also of an over-great Confidence, neither did we recal our Ambassa∣dour presently after your Majesty had recalled yours, in hopes you would at last be pleased to make some Reflection upon the Mischiefs a War would bring up∣on the two Nations. Your Majesty alone is Witness of the advantageous Propositions that have been made you, in order to attain a Good and Solid Peace. We have offered to conclude it as your Majesty should desire, either that each Party should restore what they had taken from each other, or else that if 
En∣gland
 should think that best for its Interests, each side should keep and remain in possession of their Conquests, and that with this Advantage for 
En∣gland,
 that those Propositions might have been ac∣cepted by your People at a Time when the 
United Provinces
 as yet were ignorant what had been taken from them in remote Countries. To which may be added, that it cannot be said, That we flattered

 our selves with the Hopes of receiving any other Fruit from thence, than a bare indemnification for the Losses the States have suffered, incomparably greater than those of 
England.
 Notwithstanding all this, your Majesty has not only refused to accept all these advantageous Conditions, which may con∣vince you of the sincere Desire the States have for a Peace. But further, were not pleased to be satis∣fied with those other Proposals so disadvantageous to the States, offered you by the Mediation of 
France,
 which they never consented to. Besides, your Ma∣jesty would never make, or order any one to make, the least Overture on your Side, of any Conditions upon which you pretended to enter into Negotiation with the States: And tho' you have been pleased to testifie to our Ambassadour, That you desired nothing so heartily as Peace, yet you would never determine to make choice of any means by which it might be attained, or explain your Mind clearly thereupon, either to him or to the other Mediators. We are per∣suaded, there is no Christian Prince in 
Europe
 who would not chuse rather at all times to prefer the Sweetness of a good Peace before the Mischiefs of a Cruel War, how just soever it may be; and we make thereupon the same Judgment of your Majesty's Sentiments, since you exercise the same Religion with us. But reflecting upon your Majesty's manner of dealing with our Ambassador, in contempt even of those advantageous Propositions made you by the 
French
 Ambassadours, tho' they were altogether contrary to the true Interests of our State, in that you would never vouchsafe to make any advan∣ces that might serve for a Ground for us to treat upon together, we thought then that our Ambas∣sadour could no longer stay in the Court of 
En∣gland,
 without Injury to the Reputation of the State; and therefore have thought fit to recal him, and that so much the rather, because by recalling yours, has been pleased to let us know you would not take it ill at our Hands. This shall not hinder, but that

 we shall ever retain a sincere desire to come to a good Accommodation, as soon as we shall have Opportu∣nity to do it, in conjunction with our Allies. In the mean while, we shall wait the time till it shall please God to inspire your Majesty with such Senti∣ments as may dispose you to declare what your will is, and what are the Conditions that may reconcile us, that we may stop and prevent the Effusion of so much Christian Blood, which is now spilt, and still ready to be spilt in this unhappy Quarrel. We can say, That we shall not be responsible for it, since both before and since the Rupture, we have done all we could imagine to be just and reasonable, and that could be expected from us, and that we are still actually in the same Mind, and yet without ever having been able hitherto to find out what your Ma∣jesty's Intention is upon that Subject. We will there∣fore wait till you have more Inclination for Peace; but yet it were to be wisht, you would be brought to those good Thoughts of your own accord, without staying till the Mischiefs and Disasters that are now ready to afflict Christendom, inspire them into you. We pray God to avert them, and to take, Sir, your Majesty's Sacred Person into his holy Protection.




 
 The Threats made by the 
French
 Ambassadours at 
Oxford,
 to the King of 
England,
 were soon followed by a Declaration of War from that Crown. For Mr. 
Van Beuningen,
 Ambassadour from the States at the Court of 
France,
 had a long time before powerfully sollicited them to declare, by vertue of the Treaty of Alliance, concluded in the Month of 
April,
 1662. with the 
Ʋnited Provin∣ces;
 urging them out of Hand to unite their For∣ces with those of the States against the King of 
Great Britain,
 the Violater of the Peace. Upon which the Most Christian King, being easily Per∣suaded that the best way for him to bend the King of 
England
 to a pliable Temper to him, and to make his Ends upon both Nations, was to declare

 War against the 
English
 in that Juncture, pub∣lished the following Declaration.




The 
French
 King's Declaration of War against 
England.


HIS Majesty being informed, there was some mis-understanding between 
England,
 and the United Provinces, gave order to his Ambas∣sadors in ordinary, to employ all imaginable care in his name, to endeavour to stifle all those troubles in their birth, and having with dis∣pleasure heard, that things were carried to that extremity as to come to a Rupture, his Ma∣jesty sent Extraordinary Ambassadors to the King of Great 
Britain,
 to endeavour by new Instances to pacifie those two powers, and in∣duce them to come to some Accommodations; but his mediation had not all the success that was to be wisht for. In the mean while, the States General of the United Provinces strong∣ly soliciting his Majesty to execute the Treaty of a defensive Alliance concluded the 7th. of 
April,
 1662, between the States and his said Majesty, the King finding himself thereupon ob∣liged to perform his Royal Word, and the Engagements into which he entred by an Au∣thentick League in a time when 
England
 and 
Holland
 were as yet in good understanding together, and out of all appearance of a Rup∣ture; his Majesty has declared, and does declare by these presents, signed with his own hand, that he is resolved to assist the said States General of the United Provinces, in pursuance of the said Treaty of a defensive League, and to joyn all his Forces to theirs, in Order to Act joyntly with them against the 
English
 as well by Sea as by Land. And for that ef∣fect his Majesty Commands expresly all his Subjects and Ships, to attack and fight the 
Eng∣lish,


 forbidding them on pain of death to have any Communication, 
 Commerce, or Intelligence with them. And for those ends, His Majesty has revoked, and does revoke all permissions, Pass-ports, Safe-guards, or safe-Conducts, which may have been granted by him, or by his Lieu∣tenants General, and other Officers, contrary to these presents; declaring them null, and of no effect, forbidding all to whom they shall come, to have any regard to them. And his Maje∣sty commands the Duke of 
Beaufort,
 Peer of 
France,
 Great Master, Chief, and Super-inten∣dent General of Marine Affairs, and of the Commerce of 
France;
 and likewise to the Mar∣shals of 
France,
 to the Governours and Lieute∣nant Generals of his Majesty, as well those of his Provinces, as of his Armies, to Camp Mar∣shals, Brigadeers, Colonels, Captains, and other Commanders of his Troops, as well Infantry as Cavalry, 
French,
 or Strangers, and to all o∣ther Officers to whom it appertains, to lend a hand to the Execution of these presents, e∣very one in his place, and his Jurisdiction. For such is the pleasure of his Majesty. Who likewise wills that these presents be published and fixed up in all his Towns, upon Sea, and elsewhere, in all the Ports and other places of his Kingdom, where it is necessary, that none may plead cause of Ignorance, and that to the Copy of them duly compared, the same credit be given as to the Original.




In the month of 
February
 following, the Uni∣ted Provinces concluded another strict Alliance with 
Denmark,
 in Consequence of which, orders were sent to 
Funen,
 into 
Holstein, Jutland,
 and 
Norway,
 to lay an Embargo upon all 
Danish
 Ships, and to forbid them to stir out of their Ports, that so by that means the 
Danish
 Fleet might be the more expeditiously equipt and Ar∣med out. The Articles of that Treaty were.






I. 
 
THat each party should absolutely desist from all pretensions they might have one upon the other.


II. 
That all manner of mis-understanding in
 Norway 
should be laid asleep and forgot.


III. 
That the States General should engage to pay to his
 Danish 
Majesty
 1500000 
Livers
 per an∣num, 
as long as the War against
 England 
should continue, of which the
 French 
should be obliged to pay
 300000 
Livers yearly for their part: For which sum, the King of
 Denmark 
should engage on his side, to maintain a Fleet at Sea of
 30 
Ships of War, of which some should be furnished with a sufficient number of Regular Troops, to be employed in the Service of the States, when they should need them.




That Treaty was a stroke of Thunder to the 
English,
 who were the more sensibly concerned at it, because they had not heard the least inkling of it, till they heard of its conclusion. For 
Dreyer
 the Secretary of the King of 
Denmark
's Embassy in 
Holland,
 was sent 
incognito
 by the Ministers of that Prince that were at the 
Hague
 Mr. 
Catisius,
 and Mr. 
Klingenberg,
 immediately after the Conclusion of the Treaty, to the King their Master, to present it to him and get his Ratification, after which the Secretary came back again with all expedition to the 
Hague.
 This politick silence was the cause, that the 
English
 Resident at the Court of 
Denmark
 had not time to advertise the Merchants of his Nation of it, so that all their effects were seized and confis∣cated throughout the whole extent of the King∣dom. It's true the 
Danes
 proceedings on that occasion had some appearance of Justice and E∣quity, because the 
English
 from the very time they made that Hostile attempt of which we have spoken, upon the Port of 
Bergen
 in 
Norway,
 had not only seized on the 
Danes
 Ships and Mer∣chandizes,

 but had likewise taken their men Pri∣soners, so that the Crown of 
Denmark
 in that Rencounter seemed to do no more than to use Reprisals, had it not afterwards appeared, that they had dealt perfidiously in that matter with the King of 
England,
 and secretly invited him to that Enterprize for which they afterwards de∣clared War against him.


In the mean time the United Provinces, in order to facilitate the Arming and manning out the Fleet, publish'd on the 1st. of 
February
 an Ordinance, forbidding all Merchant Ships, and Fishing vessels, to stir out of their Harbours, upon pain of Confiscation of their said Ships and Goods: They likewise forbad the great and small Fishery under the same penalties and the Ordi∣nance for forbidding the 
Greenland
 Fishery, was also renewed. But the States however, declared that their intention in all those prohibitions, was to find them subsistance all the year, without a∣ny alteration even after the Fleet should be gone out, 
&c.


About that time, 
Tromp
 signified to the States that he should be glad if they would please to change his Quality of Lieutenant Admiral of 
Holland
 and 
West-Friesland,
 or of the College of the Admiralty of the 
Meuse
 into that of Lieu∣tenant Admiral of the College of the Admiral∣ty of 
Amsterdam,
 which request the States granted upon Condition he got the consent of both those Admiralties thereunto: so that having ob∣tained it, on the 6th. of 
February,
 he was created Lieutenant Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of 
Amsterdam;
 and on the 24th. of the same month, Vice Admiral 
Aart Van Nes,
 succeeded him in qua∣lity of Lieutenant Admiral of the 
Meuse,
 and Cap∣tain 
John Van Nes
 was made Rear Admiral.


In the mean while the 
English
 being sensible of the great Force of so powerfull a League, made very great preparations for War on their

 side, and exerted as we may say the utmost of their efforts to make a vigorous resistance: But because money was wanting they were forced to borrow 1250000 
l.
 Sterling more at great Interest, and besides to help towards the defraying of the extraordinary charges of the War the two East-
India
 Ships, 
viz.
 the 
Phoenix,
 and the 
Fort of Huningen
 taken from the 
Hollanders
 were sold, which yielded the sum of 1600000
l.
 And because the 
French
 King had first declared War against 
England,
 the King of Great 
Britain
 who was no less Jealous of his honour than the Monsieur, publish∣ed likewise a Declaration against that Crown, in the following Terms.




The King of 
England's
 Declaration of War against 
France.


WHereas the 
French
 under pretence of a defensive League concluded with the States General of the United Provinces accuses us of having violated the Peace, though all 
Europe
 be well enough informed of the contrary; And upon that Ground, has declared War against us on the 26th. of 
January
 last, making himself thereby the Aggressor and Infractour of the Peace which we have always desired to preserve with the said States, on whose behalf the Ambassa∣dors of the most Christian King never offered any indemnification for the losses suffered by our Subjects, nor given any Guarrantees for the security of their Commerce for the future: We therefore trusting in the Almighty power of God, and in the justice of our cause, and being likewise assured of the Bravery and Fi∣delity of our Subjects, have thought fit for their Common security, to declare, that we are resolved to carry on the War vigorously, by employing all our Forces as well by Sea as by Land, against 
France,
 which has newly begun

 it with us, against all the Laws of Justice. And to that end, we Command our Royal Bro∣ther Lord High Admiral of 
England,
 and our Trusty and well beloved Cousin and Councel∣lor, 
George
 Duke of 
Albemarle,
 General of our Armies by Land, our Lords Lieutenants of Coun∣ties, Governours of Provinces, and all other in∣feriour Officers and Soldiers, under their Com∣mands as well by Sea as by Land, to oppose all the Enterprizes of the 
French
 King and his Subjects; And for the more effectual putting in execution all manner of Acts of Hostility against the said 
French
 King, his Ships, or Sub∣jects, we hereby most expresly forbid all our Subjects to hold any Correspondence with them upon pain of death, excepting those who shall be forced so to do; to get their Goods safe out of the Enemies Country. And whereas there are in our Kingdom, a great Number of the Subjects of 
France,
 and of the United Provin∣ces we hereby Declare, and give our Royal Word, that all Persons of the said Nations, which shall submit to our Obedience, without holding any intelligence with our Enemies, whatsoever they be, shall be defended and pro∣tected in their Goods and Persons. And more∣over, we declare, that all 
French
 or 
Dutch
 Subjects, who out of love to our Government or by reason of the Calamities they may be made to suffer in their own Country, shall retire into our Kingdom for refuge, shall be favoured with our protection, as well in their Goods as Persons, and especially those of the Reformed Religion, whose Interests we shall e∣ver dearly tender, 
&c.




In the mean while, the 
French
 being, as they are always, diligent in making their preparati∣ons, put out their Fleet to Sea at the very be∣ginning of 
April,
 consisting of 30 Men of War

 12 Galliots, and 10 Fire-ships, who were joined with 6 of the States ships under the Command of 
Gedeon Verburg,
 and Captain 
Ooms.
 The Duke of 
Beauford
 Admiral of 
France,
 had or∣ders from the King his Master, to enter the Chan∣nel, and join the 
Holland
 Fleet. And accord∣ingly appearing upon the Coasts of 
England,
 he put them in alarm, and made a descent in seve∣ral places, and carried off a few sheep, and some other small Booty, which was all the ser∣vice he did the 
Hollanders
 whom he never join∣ed, or the harm he did the 
English,
 whom he ne∣vea fought, save only that by sculking about, and keeping the Enemy in fears however that he would join the 
Dutch
 he caused the 
English
 to divide their Force and send a part after him where he was not to be found, and so gave op∣portunity to the 
Hollanders
 to batter and distress the other part, with their whole Force, and to obtain such an advantage over the 
English,
 as they could never do when their Forces were United. And the 
Hollanders
 paid dear for that advan∣tage too: for under pretence of their small ser∣vices in that War, the 
French
 cunningly wheed∣led them to build them a great Number of men of War, with which they afterwards scourged them at 
Palermo.


The 
English
 and 
Hollanders
 both, in so pres∣sing an occasion, had great need of Seamen, to perfect the Compliments of their ships; which obliged the 
English
 to consent to the Exchange of Prisoners, man for man, which they would never be perswaded to do before, by all the In∣stances and Sollicitations the 
Dutch
 could make for that effect. But because the Number of the 
Dutch
 Prisoners in 
England,
 was much greater than that of the 
English,
 in the United Provin∣ces, tho many of the former perisht by the Plague, Famine, and other Hardships they were made to suffer, they drew them out by Lot,

 which they that got were delivered, and those that met with Blanks remained in Captivity and Misery.


A little time after, 
viz.
 On the 1st. of May, War was likewise declared against the 
English
 by sound of Trumpet, at 
Bergen
 in 
Norway,
 by or∣der of the King of 
Denmark.


In the mean while the 
English,
 having used all the diligence imaginable to get their Navy E∣quipt, put it to Sea about the end of 
May,
 which consisted of 81 men of War, 21085 men, and 4460 Guns, and was divided into 3 Great Squadrons; the first of which being the Red one was Commanded by Prince 
Robert
 and Ge∣neral 
Monk.
 The White Squadron was Con∣ducted by Sir 
George Ayschew,
 and the Blew one by Sir 
Thomas Allen.


As soon as the 
Holland
 Fleet had advice, that the 
English
 Navy was at Sea, they weigh'd An∣chor on the 1st. of 
June,
 being then 96 sail strong of men of War, and carrying 4716 Guns, and 20642 men, and was Commanded in chief by Lieutenant Admiral 
de Ruiter.


And on the 11th. of 
June
 the two Fleets met, and fought that celebrated Battle of 4 days, the memory of which ought to be preserved to all posterity, as well for the unexampled Bravery of the 
English
 tho' overpowered by Numbers, be∣cause divided in Force, as for the dear bought advantage of the 
Hollanders
 in it, which yet was far from meriting the name of a Victory, tho' State policy required it should be bragged of and proclaimed Abroad as one no less than of the most Absolute sort. How the 
Dutch
 Re∣ported of that Famous Action, may be seen by the following Letters and Relations: whereof the first is





A Letter written to the College of the Admiralty of 
Amsterdam,
 by 
Hondius,
 Captain on board Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 and dated the 12th. of 
June
 New stile from 
Goree,
 whither the Ship 
Hollandia
 in which he was, was brought in after the fight.


ON the 11th. of 
June,
 at the break of day, being come to an Anchor to the North-West-ward, and at 9 or 10 miles distance from 
O∣stend,
 our Advanced guards that were detach'd to go out to discover the Enemy, came back to the Fleet, and brought us word, that the 
English
 Navy was to the Windward of us; and a little after, we saw 10 of their scout-Ships, who as soon as they had viewed us tack∣ed about, and steered back to the North-west-ward to rejoyn their Grand Fleets. The wind being turn'd to the South-West, and South-West and a Quarter to the West, begun to grow high, and the Sea to swell. In the mean time, all was ready for giving the 
English
 battle, and our Ships faced those of the Enemy that were to the Wind-ward. After noon, we perceived the Enemies Fleet consisting of about 70 men of War, making directly towards us. At that time, we were, as I have said, still at Anchor; and because the Wind was high and the Sea was somewhat rough, we thought the 
English
 had the Weather-gage, and would likewise come and cast Anchor, but they instead of that, af∣ter they had faced our Fleet a while, fell to rights upon us; which hapning whilst we were busy in unmooring, and had our Anchors yet but half up, we were forced to cut our Ca∣bles in all haste, because the Enemy was alrea∣dy come within Cannon shot of us. without losing time then we hoisted our Main-Sails and saluted the Vice Admiral of the White, who was on our right hand, with some Guns; and

 then the Enemy begun to fire likewise, they which were nearest us answering us each of them with a broad side. Our Fleet, but especially the Squadrons of the Lieutenant Admirals, 
E∣vertsz
 and 
de Ʋries,
 which according to the Order given were to have been to the Wind-ward, were fallen to Leeward, and were the hindermost of all the Fleet: But a little while after, upon a Signal we made to them to fol∣low us in their due rank, they advanced in good Order. The 
English
 Admiral putting up a Roy∣al Flag, attack'd us behind; but he was so vi∣gorously charged by the Ships that followed us, that he was forced to tack about to the North-ward, which made him with some of his fol∣lowers, fall into our Fleet, which caused a great deal of disorder in the 
English
 Fleet. A Fiery Bullet from the Enemies set fire to the Right side of our Gallery, which we had much ado to quench. The Vice Admiral of the Red, ob∣serving that the abovesaid Admiral that carri∣ed the Royal or Union Flag, whose Main mast was shot down, had tackt about, would fain have followed him; but being already very much shattered, it was impossible for him to do it. The Vice Admiral of the White having followed the motion we made to the South-ward, was about the distance of a Musket shot from us, who being attackt by 
Solomonsz
 and 
de Haan,
 was extreamly endamaged: For his main sail was shot to pieces, so that seeing him∣self in such a pitifull condition he fired some Guns without Bullet, to advertize his followers to come in to his Assistance; but they making as if they heard him not, betook themselves to flight, and left him in the danger. And then we thought we might conveniently grapple him in Order to board him; But Captain 
Solomonsz
 Ship falling foul just in that nick, upon ours, we were entangled for some time together, but

 however soon after we got free of one another with∣out damage. In the mean time the aforesaid 
English
 Vice-Admiral, making use of that op∣portunity, was fled away, in Company with some other 
English
 Ships; which being pursued by ours, were taken; And the Vice-Admiral of the White was forced to surrender himself to Cap∣tain 
Adriansz
 who had grappled him. During all the time of the fight, we vigorously charged the 
English
 Navy together with our whole Fleet, till at last our masts were shot close by the Board, and our Mizzen and Fore-Masts tumbled into the Sea; so that our Ship being quite disabled and out of a condition to make any more Resi∣stance, Admiral 
Tromp
 leapt into a Galliot, to go on board some other Ship, after he had re∣commended to his Officers, that they would take care to save the Hull of his Ship by carrying it into the first Harbour they met with, we were brought in hither to day by the 
Asperen
 Frigat, 
&c.




Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 having removed him∣self on Board the 
Ʋtrecht,
 writ also the following Letter in haste, to the States, dated the 14th of 
June.




High and Mighty Lords,


TIll at present by the protection of God, we are Masters of the Victory. Yesterday the 
Eng∣lish,
 to the Number of 
30
 men of War,
 betook themselves to flight, whom we pursued till the dusk of Night, and we have forced the Admiral of the White Squadron, who Commanded the 
Royal Charles
 to yield himself and Ship, which carries 
90
 Brass Guns. I was then on board Rear-Admiral 
Sweers;
 but after we had taken her, we burnt her. The Enemies Fleet is now coming up to us again, being Re-inforced with 
22
 men of War, great and small; 
12
 of our Ships that were scattered, are come in again to the Admiral, so that we are still 
70
 sail strong, and what is more considerable, God be thanked, is that they are all full of Courage. We flatter our selves

 with the hopes by the Protection of Heaven, to bring things to a happy issue. I beseech your High and Mightinesses to be pleased to excuse me for sending you no more particulars, because time is now so precious to us.




Admiral 
de Ruiter
 being on board the Ship cal∣led, the 7 
Provinces,
 writ also the following Let∣ter to the States dated the 14th. of 
June.




High and Mighty Lords,


SInce my last of the 10th. of this Month, we had a Calm all night, and on the 11th. in the morning, the Wind rising higher, turned to the South-West, which induced us to hasten to go and Anchor between 
Dunkirk,
 and the North of these Provinces. About 9 a Clock our Ad∣vanced guards gave us notice by the appointed signal, that they had discovered the Enemies Fleet. At 10 a Clock the mizzen-mast and Bolt-sprit of Colonel 
de Gent
's Ship being blown into the Sea by the violence of the Wind, we Ordered him to retire into the first secure Harbour. At 11 we discovered the 
English
 Fleet making to∣wards us whose Admiral carried on his Main-mast top the Union Flag of 
England,
 and the Red Flag on his Mizzen-mast top, and upon oc∣casion for a signal he sometimes put up a third upon his Poop, without any blew in it. The Lieutenant Admiral carried a White Flag on his Main-mast, without any blew. There were 3 Vice-Admirals, and Rear-Admirals that carried White and Blew Flags. The whole Number of the Ships that composed their Fleet was 70 sail great and small. We expected their charge at Anchor, because the Wind was so high and the Sea so rough that we could not possibly weigh; so that when the 
English
 came within Cannon shot of us, we cut our Cables, by which means we lost each of us an Anchor, and one or two Ca∣bles.

 About noon, the fight begun by the Squa∣dron of Admiral 
Tromp
 and 
Van Meppelen,
 who were the foremost advanced on my left hand. The 
English
 had the Weather-gage, and we were to Leeward, which gave us the more advantage to fire our lower tires of Guns: After we had fought in that manner about three hours, with almost equal loss on both sides, the 
English
 tackt about to the North-ward; and then the Vice-Admiral of the White, and two or three other 
English
 Ships were separated from the body of their Fleet, they being so much shattered, that they were not able to follow them; so that the Captains, 
Vander Zaan, Adriansz,
 and 
Van Amstel
 pursuing them close, took them. These are all the particulars I know. About that time Admiral 
Tromp
's Ship having lost her Masts, I found by the hoisting of his Flag on board a∣nother Ship, that he had been obliged to change his Ship. I perceived likewise, that a Ship of my Squadron, Commanded by Captain 
Otho Tres∣long
 in which were the Prince of 
Monaco,
 and the Count 
de Guiche,
 with their retinue as Vo∣lunteers, was all on fire caused by some stopples; upon which, those Lords fearing the fire might get to the powder-room, and blow up the Ship retired on Board my Son-in-Law 
John Gelders
 Ship, from whence they came on board me on the 12 in the morning.


The 
English
 having as we have said, tackt about to the North-ward, Admiral 
Evertsz
 and 
de Ʋries
 went on and charged them again, whilst we were repairing our damages. And the Ene∣mies finding themselves to the Wind-ward of some of our Ships, the 
English
 Admiral General followed by several of his Ships, and some of the General Officers of his Navy, came to an Anchor, thinking to rally his Squadrons, and to stop the holes of such of his Ships as had been pierced with Bullets. But when he saw us make

 a tack towards him, he cut his Cables and ad∣vanced towards us with much Resolution. We re∣ceived him as we ought, and having intercepted their Rear Admiral of the White, I sent up my Fire Ship to burn him; but they shoved her off with Oars and Iron Leavers as they did like∣wise another Fire-Ship of 
Zealand;
 however, near 200 of his Men, for fear of the flames, leapt into the Sea, and Admiral 
Evertsz
 kept close to him till the last shot he fired. In fine that 
Eng∣lish
 Rear-Admirals ship, called the 
Injury
 sunk, but we know not whether any of the rest of the men that staid on board her, were saved or no. She carried 54 Brass, and 20 Iron Guns, and 400 Men. The night parted the Fray, and we passed it in repairing our Ships, charging our Cartridges, and casting out all incumbrances.


On the 12th. at break of day, the 
English
 having the Weather-gage came powring upon us again. The fight was furious and bloody, and the two Fleets having broken through one another twice, at the third time, Admiral 
Tromp,
 and Vice Admiral 
Vander Hulst,
 and some other ships of their Squadron, fell into the main body of the 
English,
 where they fought most desperately. I seeing the danger they were in, put a Red Flag for a signal, to the whole 
Dutch
 Fleet to Ad∣vance and Fall upon the Enemy; which was put in Execution. Our Ships were extreamly endamaged by the stout resistance the 
English
 made. Captain 
Solomonsz
's Ship being fastned upon by an 
English
 Fire-ship, was blown up, but most of his men were saved; and the ships of Vice Admiral 
Vander Hulst,
 and Captain 
de Haan
 being both disabled were forced to retire into the next Harbour. In the mean while the two Fleets broke through one another twice more and the last time my main Top-mast and Admi∣rals Flag were shot down. Afternoon the Ene∣mies betook themselves to flight, and their De∣feat

 continued all night, they Retreating to∣wards the 
Thames.
 On the 13th. of the same month, being re-inforced with a Squadron, of 20 light Frigats, amongst which were 3 or 4 great ships, they renewed the fight, but the night parted us. The Admiral's Ship of the White, being ready to sink, we burnt her. Ad∣miral 
Ayschew
 and his men were saved by one of our Ships. This morning having called on board the Admirals Ship, all the Captains of the Fleet we have resolved to pursue the Victory, in hopes that God will bless our Arms with a Compleat one. I cannot yet be informed of the particulars of our Losses, any more than of those of the Enemies. But I know very well, that whilst we pursued them, we could scarcely count — or 40 of their Ships together before they receiv∣ed a Reinforcement, 
&c.




Ruth Maximilian,
 who was lately raised from the low degree of an ordinary Sailer, to that of a Captain, for his signal Bravery in the Action at 
Bergen
 in 
Norway,
 the year before, writ the fol∣lowing Letter to the College of the Admiralty of 
Rotterdam.




Noble and Potent Lords,


I Shall inform your Noble Mightinesses of the most Remarkable Circumstances that are come to my knowledge of the Battle, lately fought between the two Fleets. On the 11th. Instant, at noon, we were riding at an Anchor near 
Newport,
 when the Wind being grown high, and the Sea rough, the 
English
 Navy consisting of about 58 sail came from the West-ward, and fell upon us. It was Commanded in chief by Admiral 
Monk.
 Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
's Squadron was posted to the South-West-ward, that of Ad∣miral 
de Ruiter
 in the main Battle, and that of Lieutenant Admiral 
Evertsz
 extended towards

 the North-East. The Enemies begun their at∣tack upon Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
's Squa∣dron, who was obliged to cut his Anchor-Ca∣bles, and to bear the greatest brunt of their assailing Arms. His Masts being shot down were tumb∣led into the Sea by the violence of the Wind. 
Tromp
's Squadron thereupon begun to give way, and to make back towards the main Body of the 
Dutch
 Fleet, and then 
de Ruiter
 advanced to support them, accompanied with some other ships. 'Tis true? The 
Engl
sh
 had the ad∣vantage of the Wind, but it being violent, their Ships being by it heav'd all on one side had much ado to play their Guns with any suc∣cess, whereas we with our lower Tires fired up∣on them with no small effect. At the beginning of the night, we had already dispersed a part of their Fleet. In which their Vice Admiral of the White was taken by a Ship of the Ad∣miralty of 
Amsterdam,
 and the Rear Admiral of the same Squadron run in great danger of being burnt to Ashes by three Fire-ships, which yet wrought not the effect expected from them: For having carried their Flames no further than his Poop, they were quencht, and the Fire-ships repulsed; so that the ship escaped by favour of the night, tacking away to the Eastward; how∣ever a good part of her Seamen seeing her dan∣ger leapt into the Sea, choosing rather to perish in the Water than to be burnt. There is rea∣son to believe, that ship so shattered as she was sunk soon after, because she was never heard of since. During the obscurity of the Night, the dispersed ships of the Enemies got together a∣gain and we made a task to the South-Ward. On 
Saturday
 morning, we perceived the 
English
 behind us, and made up to them, but they without waiting for us, advanced to meet us with∣much Resolution and Courage. And then the two Fleets broke through one another tho' a∣cross

 the continual Fire of each others Guns. A Calm came on, and after that, the Wind turn∣ed to the South, of which the 
English
 had the advantage. Our Admiral having broke through the Enemies Fleet, got the Weather-gage of them, so that he prevailed with the greatest part of his Forces over the 
English
 Fleet, excepting only 
Tromp,
 who with 7 or 8 Ships of his Squadron was to Leeward. He had changed his Ship, and was then in that called, 
the Province of Ʋtrecht;
 he was very ill handled, as was al∣so his Vice Admiral, and had like to have been reduced to Ashes by an 
English
 Fire-ship. 
De Ruiter
 considering the danger in which 
Tromp
 was, resolved to dis-engage him, and for that effect, he ordered the greatest part of his Fleet to make a tack to the South-ward, whilst him∣self with his Rear fell upon the Enemies main body, making directly towards 
Tromp,
 to assist him: The 
English
 seeing him come, opened them∣selves, and the Admiral of the White advanced at the head of his Squadron, followed by two Fire-ships, to stop 
de Ruiter,
 who observing the motion the Enemies had newly made, tackt to the South-ward, to rejoin, if possible, the rest of his Fleet, which was tackt about to the North-ward, with the same intention, so that the 
Eng∣lish
 contented themselves with firing upon him at a distance with their Guns, without offer∣ing to follow him. But methinks committed then a strange fault. For it had been easy for them to have destroyed the few Ships 
de Ruiter
 had with him, and 
Tromp
's Squadron was able to make no more Resistance against them, where∣as in spite of their Cannonadings, the intended Junction was effected. The matter passed al∣most in the same manner, as it did the year be∣fore, for by the motion we made, two 
English
 ships were separated from the rest, whereof one was sunk, to which I my self, without bragging

 contributed the most, and the other was so shat∣tered by 
de Ruiter,
 that the Enemies finding her no longer able to keep the Sea, set fire to her. In the mean while, the two Fleets being got to∣gether again, the fight was renewed, and we engaged together three times more, firing per∣petually at one another till the dusk of the evening. And then the 
English
 losing Courage, did not think fit to charge us any more, but tackt a∣way to the East-ward, in the mean while we chaced them as far as the Calm Weather, and the approach of the night would permit us. On 
Sunday
 Morning, the Wind was fair, and the Wind turned to the East, and we pursued the 
English
 again till 4 a Clock in the after∣noon, the most part of which retreated towards the West-South-West, in pretty good order; And then they were reinforced, by Prince 
Ro∣bert
 s Squadron consisting of 20 Men of War, coming from the South-ward. In the mean time whilst we were chacing them Sir 
George Ayschew
's Ship Admiral of the White Squadron, call'd the 
Royal Prince,
 carrying 92 Guns, was stranded at the mouth of the 
Thames
 and yielded to Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 without firing so much as a Gun, which after we had taken out of her, the Admi∣ral and his men we burnt. On 
Monday
 the 14th. in the morning, the 
English
 having receiv∣ed a Reinforcement of a fresh Squadron, took new Courage, and came and attackt us again. 
De Ruiter
 thereupon having summoned all his Captains on board the Admiral Ship, Recom∣mended to them their duty and the honour of their Country, after which we renewed the fight again, and having the Weather-gage we resolved to break through the Enemies Fleet, and by that means, quickly to put them to the Rout. But the 
English
 Received us with much Resolution and Bravery, and it may be said, that there and then it was, that the Valour of

 all in General, and of every one in particular was seen to appear in its full Lustre. After the Fight, had been vigorously maintained till 4 a Clock, our Fleet was divided into two Parts: For 
de Ruiter,
 at the Head of one of them, made a Motion above the Enemies Fleet, whilst the other had order to keep below them, with Design to enclose them. We had scarce past by the half of the 
English
 Fleet, but we fell upon them, and broke through them, from the one end to the other, with so much Fury that they were presently put to the Rout. And then it was, there was a sad Spectacle to be seen of dead and wounded men, and a terrible har∣vest of Masts mown down, and of Sails, and all sorts of tackle tumbled into the Sea, as well on the one side as the other. About 6 in the Evening the Enemies betook themselves wholly to flight, and we gave them chace. Being advanced near Prince 
Robert,
 we boarded one of the Enemies Ships, called the 
Havertuin,
 carrying 56 Guns, which yielded in sight of Prince 
Robert,
 he not da∣ring to come to her Assistance, but contented himself with killing me one Seaman, and shoot∣ing of the Arm of another. And besides the ship I took the same evening there were 4 more ta∣ken in my sight. In the mean while the whole 
English
 Fleet was entirely dispersed, and every one of them sought to save themselves by a nim∣ble retreat! the Sea was covered with wander∣ing Vessels, the most of them steering Westward. Admiral 
Monk,
 and an 
English
 Rear Admiral lost their main Masts, so that I doubt not but they will fall to day into our hands; and so much the rather, that every one of them minding on∣ly their own preservation before that of any one else, they were seen to scamper about with pre∣cipitation without taking any care what destiny befell the rest. In fine, we have all the reason in the World, to thank God for the signal Vi∣ctory we have newly obtained, and for having

 so powerfully protected our Arms, to the destru∣ction of our Enemies, 
&c.




These Letters, how Authentick soever they were, met with no credit in 
England:
 And on the con∣trary, it was noised throughout all the Kingdom that they had defeated the Enemies Fleet, and chaced the 
Hollanders
 as far as into the very Ha∣vens of 
Zealand;
 Nay, that they had mist but little of taking Admiral 
de Ruiter
's Ship, (as indeed they had, had they minded their business, and 
Tromp
 too;) that the 
Dutch
 had lost in that fight, 40 Ships, and at least 6000 men; whereas the loss of the 
English
 was reduced to but 4 men of War, 3 Captains, some few Seamen or Sol∣diers killed, and about 300 wounded; that their Fleet was but very little endamaged, and would be fit to put to Sea again in 15 days at furthest, 
&c.
 The people of 
Brabant, Cologne,
 and 
Ham∣borough
 were credulous enough to believe all those false reports; But in a little time after; they found by experience the vanity of those 
English
 Boasts by the great number of the dead and woun∣ded of which all the Harbours of Great 
Britain
 were full. Their Great Ships were so miserably shattered, that the people were by publick pro∣hibition Restrained from going into the Ports, tho' out of meer curiosity. The 
Soveraign,
 the 
Royal Charles
 the 
Catharine,
 and several others were mown close to their very Hulls; The 
Rainbow
 who saved her self by flying towards the Coasts of 
Flanders
 after she had put her dead and woun∣ded men on shore at 
Ostend,
 retired by stealth tho' with much ado into 
Dover.
 Admiral 
Ayschew
 was made Prisoner; 
Barklay, Mings,
 and 
Herman
 killed. Prince 
Robert, Monk, Allen,
 and 
Smith
 ha∣ving had their ships most grievously shattered, sought shelter in the Ports of the 
Gunfleet, Nor∣bay, &c.
 Thus because each party claimed the Glory of that Action, and the Honour of the Vi∣ctory,

 and that the 
English
 proceeded so far as to publish a Relation Printed by Authority, of which the whole design was, to prepossess peoples minds with an opinion, that they had had the advantage. The States on their side, thought fit to undeceive the Publick, by an Authentick Relation, Autho∣rized by the pretended faithfull Report of all the General and Inferiour Officers in their Fleet. Which Pensioner 
de Wit,
 and 
Ʋrybergen, Vander Houlk, Kann
 and 
Gerlacius,
 the Deputies and Plenipo∣tentiaries of the States, and who were no less fruitfull in invention than any of the 
English
 Cour∣tiers, were appointed to draw it up: And as soon as it was publisht, they sent copies into all the Courts of 
Europe
 to let all Princes see, that the Bonfires, and other dissembling Rejoycings of the 
English
 tended only to the unjust usurping to themselves a Triumph; all the Glory of which if they might be believed, was due to the Arms of the States; such as it was, we could not dispense with our selves from inserting it here at length.




A Relation of what passed in the fight between the 
English
 Fleet, and that of the Ʋnited Pro∣vinces, which hapned on the 
11, 12, 13,
 and 14th of 
June 1666,
 drawn up after a serious Exami∣nation, and according to the faithfull Report both of the General and Inferiour Officers of the whole 
Holland
 Fleet on the 24th of the same month according to the order of the States General by the care of their Pensionary 
De Wit, Mr. Urybergen, Mr. Vander Houlk, Mr. Kann,
 and 
Mr. Ger∣lacius,
 Deputies and Plenipotentiaries of their High and Mightinesses, at present at 
Wielin∣gen,
 for the present Naval Expedition of the said States.


THe 
Holland
 Fleet having spent from the 1 of 
June
 to the 5th of the same month of the year 1666, in getting out of the 
Texel
 by reason of

 several cross Winds and Calms that hindred them, it was impossible for them because of contrary Winds, to pursue their designed Course, and to go towards the Coasts of 
England,
 according to the Orders they had received for that purpose, before the 8th. of the Month. On the 11th. in the morning, they with much ado got as far as 7 or 8 miles to the East-South-East-ward of the North 
Foreland,
 which is a part of 
England
 that extends between the Channel and the 
Thames
 whereby a South West wind that blew very fiercely they were forced to Anchor. The 
English
 Fleet being come some days before to Anchor in the 
Downs,
 unmoor'd from thence on the 11th. of 
June,
 probably upon the advice they had heard of the approach of the 
Dutch
 Fleet. And about noon, the two Fleets met. That of 
Holland
 was com∣posed of 83 men of War, or Frigats, besides Advice-Boats, Fire-ships, and other small Tenders on the Fleet. But it hapned, that about an hour before the Battle, one of the most considerable Ships of the 
Dutch
 Fleet, commanded by Colo∣nel 
de Gent
 having unfortunately lost her Fore-mast, and afterwards her mizzen mast by the vio∣lence of the Wind, 
de Ruiter
 Judging her in that condition uncapable to fight, sent her out of the Fleet in sight of the Enemies, to retire into 
Hol∣land:
 The said 
de Gent
 removed after that into the Ship of Captain 
Henry Gotskens.
 As for the 
English
 Fleet, they were 80 sail strong as they were counted by the 
Hollanders
 at the very time of fight. About 1 a Clock afternoon, they be∣gun to play their Guns. Some moments be∣fore, the 
Hollanders,
 had cut their Anchor-Ca∣bles to make the more haste, and to Accommodate themselves to the season, and the violence of the Waves which would not permit them to weigh: The two Fleets being then met, they both of them made a tack to the South ward, the Wind

 being then turned West-South-West. That mo∣tion was the cause that Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 and 
Van Meppelen,
 who were before placed in the Rear, found themselves in the Van, and were forced to bear the brunt of the most furious and terrible shock that hapned during the whole fight, which they did most valiantly. The fight being thus begun, the Squadron of Admiral 
de Ruiter
 and of Lieutenant Admiral 
Van Nes,
 followed by their other Officers, fell thundering upon the Enemies with an undauntedness, without Example. A lit∣tle while after, an 
English
 Frigat of the Blue Squa∣dron, carrying 50 Guns, sunk, after she had receiv∣ed a Farewell Broadside from 
de Ruiter.
 The Squadron of Lieutenant Admiral 
Cornelius Evertsz
 and 
Tierk Hiddes de Ʋries
 had all the difficulty in the World, to get to engage at first, because they were to Leeward, and at a pretty distance from the Enemies. In the mean while, the two Fleets char∣ged one another vigorously, making always the same motion, which lasted till 5 a Clock in the after∣noon; when the 
English
 tacked to the North-westward, as well to keep the Weather-gage, as to avoid the sand Banks of 
Flanders.
 That motion engaged the Squadron of Lieutenant Admiral 
E∣vertsz
 and 
Tierk Hiddes de Ʋries
 in a Bloody Fight, in which the undaunted Valour and Cou∣rage of those two Generals were seen to shine with equal Luster. The 
English
 being thus tackt about, the 
Dutch
 Fleet found means thereby to intercept some of their biggest Ships which were presently boarded and taken by 3 
Dutch
 Men of War, and afterwards carried into 
Holland.
 One of them called the 
Swiftsure
 carried 70 Guns, most of them Brass, Commanded by 
Barkley,
 Vice-Admiral of the White Squadron, who lost his life there after he had Signalized himself a∣gainst Captain 
Henry Adria
sz
's Ship carrying likewise 70 Guns; another called the 7 
Wonders,


 of 60 Guns, was taken by Captain 
Vander Zaan
's Frigat which carried 52 Guns; and the Third, called the Loyal 
George,
 of 44 Guns, fell into the hands of Captain 
Andrew Swart,
 whose Ship called the 
Deventer,
 carried 66 Guns: All those Captains belonged to the Admiralty of 
Amster∣dam.
 And on the contrary, in the first attack, there were two 
Dutch
 Ships burnt, 
viz.
 The 
Duiven∣voorde
 of 46 Guns, and Commanded by 
Otto Van Treslong;
 the second called, 
The Court of Zealand,
 had on board 58 Guns, and was Com∣manded by Captain 
Blok.
 We are informed assuredly, that these two Ships were unhappily burnt to Ashes by some stopples blown back on board by the force of the Wind, just at the time that their own Guns were discharging. The Prince of 
Monaco,
 and the Count 
de Guiche
 were Volunteers on board the first of these, who hap∣pily escaped the danger of the Flames, by Reti∣ring nimbly into the Ship, called the 
Little Hol∣land,
 Commanded by 
Cornelius Evertsz Van Gel∣der,
 Son-in-Law to Admiral 
Ruiter,
 who receiv'd them afterwards on board his own Ship. In the first attack, the Sails, Masts, and in General all the Tackle of Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
's Ship, were so endamaged, that another Ship falling foul on him in passing by, all his Masts were tumbled thereby into the Sea. Rear Admiral 
Van Nes
's Ship came off at a not much better rate, since almost at the same time his Mizzen-Mast was shot by the board. Upon which those two General Offi∣cers were forced to remove into other Ships for the security of their Persons. In which as soon as they had put up their Flags they were seen again to renew the Fight, and to Signalize themselves. Their unmasted Ships being carried out of the Fray, were towed away into 
Holland.
 The 
Eng∣lish
 Fleet having advanced above the 
Hollanders,
 their Chief Admiral followed by some Ships of

 his Squadron, cast Anchor; but a little while af∣ter, seeing 
de Ruiter
 coming towards him, at the head of the 
Dutch
 Fleet, he cut his Cables at his approach, so that they engaged again afresh, and the fight was furious and very bloody on that occasion, and yet, God be thanked, without the loss of any of the 
Dutch
 Ships; whereas about 7 or 8 a Clock in the evening, a great 
English
 Ship of the Blew Squadron carrying between 60 and 70 Guns, sunk within Musket shot of Admi∣ral 
de Ruiter.
 The two aforesaid 
English
 Ships sinking in the view of the Officers and Sea men of the whole 
Dutch
 Fleet, I think there is no rea∣son to doubt of it. It's true we are not sure whe∣ther any other 
English
 Ship perished that day, but at the beginning of the night, the Rear-Ad∣miral of the White, whose Ship was a first Rate, having been vigorously attackt by 
De Ruiter,
 and some other Ships of his Squadron, and being al∣ready very much shattered, 
de Ruiter
 sent out a Fire Ship from his Squadron, which fastned upon her and set her on fire, but the first Fire-Ship be∣ing put off, sunk, and the flames in the said Rear Admirals were quencht? Then another Fire-Ship of the 
Zealand
 Squadron was sent to burn her; and set the 
English
 Ship again in Flames, but that was likewise Repulsed, and the fire quencht. A third Fire-Ship under the Covert of Lieutenant Admiral 
Evertsz
's Guns was once more sent to Try to repair the ill success of the others, but was not a whit luckier than they, for fastning upon the 
English
 Rear Admiral, he set Fire to him indeed, but a moment after, that was quencht, and the Fire Ship was sunk with Cannon shot, so that according to the Testimony of all the 
Dutch
 Officers which were present, and were spe∣ctatours of that Glorious Action, the undaunted Bravery of that 
English
 Rear-Admiral cannot but be Admired, which was so much the more Remarka∣ble, because some of his men having saved them∣selves

 by swiming, and got on board a 
Dutch
 Ship, assured us, that near 300 of his men leapt into the Sea, at the approach of the two first Fire-ships, choosing rather to perish by Water than by Fire. The same Rear-Admiral performed like∣wise at the end of the fight, an Action Glorious to him, but fatal to us, by a Cannon shot, that took away the life of the Illustrious 
Cornelius Evertsz
 Lieutenant Admiral, whose good Conduct and great Courage had made him to be Admired not only in that fight, but in many other rencounters besides. The night then parted the Combatants, it being impossible for us to see, by reason of the darkness, or the thick smoak, whether the afore∣said Rear-Admiral, being shrewdly battered scap'd away and saved himself, or whether he sunk to the bottom of the Sea.


When the night was past, the 
English
 Fleet found it self on the 12th. of 
June
 at break of day, having the Weather-gage, about half a mile off of that of 
Holland,
 the Wind at West-South-West. The two Fleets made a motion, 
viz.
 The 
Hollanders
 towards the North-West, and the 
Eng∣lish
 toward the South, with design to follow one the other; But the 
English
 having the Ad∣vantage of the Wind, disputed their Enemies pas∣sage, and without waiting any longer, advanced to them, and fell upon them. The 
Hollanders,
 without changing their Course or their Countenance, stood firm in Luffing, so that the two Hostile Fleets broke through one another and began a most furious fight; yet there was not so much as one 
Dutch
 Ship that was so unfortunate as to be lost in it, according to the Testimony of all the Officers, both General and Inferiour of the 
Holland
 Fleet, given in to the said Deputies and Ple∣nipotentiaries of the States. The Fleets then ha∣ving broke in upon one another in that manner, their Guns made strange Havock: For the most part of the Ships of the two Fleets had their Masts,

 their Sails and Tackling either shot away, or shat∣tered to pieces. And as each party was endeavour∣ing with all speed to repair their damages, there hapned a Calm, which produced a Cessation of Arms, so that the two Fleets floated about in presence of one another, till about 11 a Clock before noon, and then the wind rising, they charged again, and renewed the Engagement more hotly than ever. The 
Hollanders
 had then the Weather-gage, 
De Ruiter
 having penetrated to the very center of the Enemies Fleet, heard a most horrid noise of both great Guns and Muskets which made him believe, that some of his Ships being surrounded by the Enemies, were making their last efforts, and were in danger of being lost without speedy as∣sistance, so that without any longer hesitation, he advanced with his Squadron, and falling upon that part of them, he forced a passage through the Storms of the Enemies shot and fire, and found Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 whose Flag was then hoisted in 
de Swart
's Ship, in the last ex∣tremity, but yet fighting with all imaginable in∣trepidity, as likewise did Vice Admiral 
Vander Hulst,
 and the Captains, 
Solomonsz, de Haan,
 and 
Van Amstel,
 their Ships being surrounded and battered on all sides by the 
English,
 were able to hold out no longer, and were at the point of being burnt or sunk, without the assistance of 
de Ruiter.
 At his approach, Captain 
Solo∣monsz
's Ship was already all on fire, which 'twas impossible to Quench. That Captain and a good part of his men had very much ado to save them∣selves on board another 
Dutch
 Ship. 
Solomonsz
 as soon as he was got out of that danger, went on board Captain 
Schey
's Ship, where after he had further Signalized his Bra∣very, and given great Proofs of his Courage, during the whole time of the fight, he died at last in the bed of Honour. Captain 
Swa
t
's Ship on board which was Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 as









 likewise the Ships of all the three other Captains abovenamed, were reduced into so pitifull a Con∣dition, by the loss of all their Masts, that Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
Tromp
 was again obliged to change Ship, and those which were Commanded by Vice-Admiral 
Vander Hulst,
 and the Captains 
de Haan Swart
 and 
Van Amstel,
 being quite disabled for fight, had Order to go out of the fight and seek shelter in the first Harbour they came to. In the same shock, Vice Admiral 
Vander Hulst
 was killed with a Cannon shot, being extreamly Re∣greted because of his great Merit, Experience, and Bravery. But God be thanked those losses were doubly Recompenced the same day by the great number of 
English
 Ships that were burnt or sunk according to the following Order, 
viz.
 1. A Ship of the Red Squadron carrying near 60 Guns was sunk in the Van guard of the 
English
 Fleet, about noon. 2. A Ship of the blew Squadron, carrying between 50 and 60 Guns, sunk at three in the afternoon, presently after 
de Ruiter
 had thundred at her in passing. 3. A Ship of the White Squadron carrying near 50 Guns, sunk a little after, by the side of Vice Admiral 
de Liefde,
 who shot her through and through in so many places that she rowled on one side, and was swallowed up by the Waves. 4. Another Ship of the White Squadron carrying 50 Guns, sunk half an hour after, in sight of 
de Ruiter
's Squadron, and of Captain 
Van Meeuwen
 who fol∣lowed her close, and gave her a Broadside in passing. And absolutely to convince the World, that the two abovesaid Ships of the White Squa∣dron were two different Ships, it is to be observ d that several Officers and other Sea-faring men saw both of them sink, that is to say, that the same persons that saw one perish, saw the other under∣go the same fare a little after; for we have so care∣fully distinguisht things in our Examination, that there is no reason to fear, we have mistaken a

 Ships for one. 5. The Ship called, the 
Golden Eagle,
 or the Arms of 
Groningen,
 taken the 
Au∣tumn
 before by the 
English
 when the 
Dutch
 Fleet was dispersed by a Tempest, was sunk by a broad side from Captain 
Marreveld.
 6. Another 
Eng∣lish
 Ship sunk in the midst of their own Fleet, after she had in vain signifyed her danger to her Companions, without receiving any assistance from them.


In the fight of the two first days, as like∣wise in that of the fourth, of which we shall speak more largely afterwards, it is certain, that 'tis not to be doubted, that some 
English
 Ships were burnt, which yet we could not be abso∣lutely assured of, because fire being set to several Fire-Ships at divers times, we cannot positively say whether the Ships they grapled were destroyed, or whether they escaped, except only two that we are sure were burnt to Ashes during the fight, because the Officers and Seamen that served on board the said Fire-Ships are now actually sol∣liciting for the reward allotted by the States for such Service, by producing good Certificates of their performance of it: Besides, that the 
Eng∣lish
 prisoners drawn out of the Waves, and sent into the respective Colleges of the Admiralty, are able to answer if carefully examined, and to tell out of what Ships they escaped. It is cer∣tain that by that means, it will be found, that a greater Number of 
English
 Ships than we know of, were burnt or sunk.


The fight of the 12th. of 
June
 was terrible and Bloody, especially afternoon, so that there were few Ships of either Fleet but sufficiently felt the effects of it by the loss of their Masts, Round-Tops, Top-Masts, Sails, and Rigging: A∣mongst others, the Top-mast and Admirals Flag of 
de Ruiter
's Ship was shot away, about 3 or 4 a Clock, which obliged him to give Order to Lieutenant Admiral 
Van Nes,
 till such time as

 he could repair it, to put the Admirals Flag on board his Ship, and to Command in Chief in his absence, according to the Orders before given: Which he did with so much Courage and Con∣duct, that after the two Fleets had broke through one another three times, as the 
Hollanders
 were ready to fall on the fourth time, the 
English
 tackt about and made with all the sail they could for their own Coasts. Their Fleet was then weak∣ned by the loss of 8 or 9 men of War. The 
Hollanders
 seeing them flie made all the sail they could, to pursue them; But their flight was fa∣voured by the obscurity of the night, and the Calms that then begun to come on, which obli∣ged the 
Hollanders
 to veer back towards their own Admiral again.


In the mean while, 
de Ruiter
 having Repaired his damages, put up the Admiral's Flag again, and re-assumed the chief Command of the Fleet on the 13th of 
June.
 But the 
English
 discovering at break of day, the mischiefs that the obscurity of the night had hidden from them, and seeing a good Number of their Ships much shattered, thought fit to burn them, to prevent the pursuit of their Enemies and prevent their falling into their hands. After which they did their best to get into the 
Thames.
 The Wind was at East, and then turning to the East-South-East, grew so weak that they were forced to crowd all the sail they could. It was impossible for the 
Hollanders,
 to know justly how many Ships the 
English
 had burnt. But the 
English
 in their publick News of the 17th of 
June,
 Printed at 
London
 by Authority, made loud claim to the Victory, and pretended they burnt but three by order of the Admiral, 
viz.
 the 
St. Paul,
 and two other lesser Ships. The 
English
 continuing thus their retreat all the day came at last so very near the Sand-banks that are at the mouth of the River, that 
Sir George Ayschew,
 Admiral of the White Squadron, who

 was in the 
Royal Prince
 carrying 90 Brass Guns, one of the most considerable Ships of the 
Eng∣lish
 Fleet, run a ground upon the bank called, the 
Galloper,
 which was a great misfortune for a Ge∣neral who had given signal proofs of his Courage all the whole time of the fight, and who was then retiring only by order of his Admiral: And 'tis a very astonishing thing that after he had fired several Guns to give notice to the rest of the Ships of the Fleet to advance to his assistance, yet no body would offer to come nigh him, but he was thus deserted and left exposed to danger even by the Ships of his own Squadron. Being in that pitiful condition, he saw himself just go∣ing to be burnt by the approach of two 
Dutch
 Fire-ships, if Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 who was then in the Ship of Rear Admiral 
Sweers,
 had not given a signal to Command the Fire-Ships to pro∣ceed no further, so much the rather because by putting up a Flag on board him, in the manner u∣sual on such occasions, he shewed marks of Sub∣mission, and demanded Quarter, upon which the Seamen of Rear-Admiral 
Sweers
 Ship, had Order from Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 to go on board Admiral 
Ayschew,
 which they did accordingly. And Admiral 
Ayschew,
 and some of his Officers were Conducted on board Rear Admiral 
Sweers,
 and the next day being put into a Galliot, he was conveyed to the 
Hague,
 by order of Admi∣ral 
de Ruiter.
 As for his Ship, the 
Prince Roy∣al,
 tho' she was afterwards got off of the Bank, yet because she was so extreamly shattered that 
de Ruiter
 thought her not in a condition to be a∣ble to follow the main body of the Fleet, he Com∣manded her to be burnt; which was immedi∣ately put in execution, after they had taken out the men. Near about the same time towards evening a Squadron of 22 
English
 Men of War appeared towards the West, under the Command of Prince 
Robert,
 who according to the advices we

 had of him, was detached away the Day before, to sail towards the Harbours of 
Plymouth
 and 
Ports∣mouth,
 in order to joyn some other Men of War, and to go meet the Duke of 
Beauford,
 Admiral of 
France,
 and to fight him. Three other great 
En∣glish
 Ships that were come out of the 
Thames
 like∣wise joyned him, which altogether made a Rein∣forcement of 25 Men of War. At the Sight and Approach of that Succour, the Squadron of 
Zea∣land
 and 
Friesland
 advanced to fight them; but Prince 
Robert
 avoided them, and tackt away to joyn the Body of the 
English
 Fleet, so that he joyned them accordingly about the Dusk of Night. And then the Enemies Fleet was composed of 60 Men of War, of which the most part were fresh and in good Con∣dition. The 
Dutch
 Fleet was still 64 Men of War strong, but having maintained already a Fight of 3 Days, both their Ships and Men had suffered very much, and their Forces were in a manner spent. As for the rest of the 
Dutch
 Fleet, there were three of them burnt or sunk, as has been already said; the rest were detached away, to conduct into 
Holland
 the Prises taken from the Enemies, or those of our Ships that were unmasted and disabled by them.


Things being in that State, and the 
Hollanders
 be∣ing still at the Eve of another bloody Battle, made a Motion in the Night, in order to avoid the Banks, and get more Sea-room. When it was Day, Admi∣ral 
de Ruiter
 fired several Guns to summon the Ge∣nerals and Captains of the 
Dutch
 Fleet on Board him, where he held a Council of War, and ex∣horted every one of them in particular, to have in Recommendation his own Honour, and the Glory of his Country. So that after he had given them the necessary Orders, the Fight begun again on the 14th of 
June,
 at 8 in the Morning, and was fought between the 
Foreland,
 and the Banks of 
Flanders,
 in the open Sea, about 8 miles from the Shore. The Wind was South South East, so that the 
Hollanders
 having the Weather-gage, came powring with the

 Three Squadrons of their Fleet upon the Enemies Navy, in three several Places, forcing a Passage through them, by which means some 
English
 Ships were separated from the rest. After which, 
de Ruiter
 caused a Motion to be made to the South-ward, with design to charge the Enemy again, who did the same on their Side; which was renewed three several times. Thus the two Fleets fought all the Day with much Obstinacy, the Victory all the while seeming equally balanced, and not to know for which side to declare. In the Time of this cruel Fight, a 
Dutch
 Ship commanded by Captain 
Ʋitten∣hou
,
 was burnt and sunk. And an 
English
 Fire-ship seeing the Ship of Vice-Admiral 
de Liefde
 un∣masted, was going to grapple him, but was repul∣sed by the said Vice-Admiral, and chancing to fall foul upon another 
Dutch
 Fireship, they were both reduced to Ashes. On the other side, one of the 
Dutch
 Fireships endeavoured also to fasten upon Prince 
Robert
's Ship, to burn her, but was grap∣pled her self by an 
English
 Fireship that kept by Prince 
Robert
's side, so that they were both burnt together with an 
English
 Ship that chanced unfor∣tunately to fall foul upon them, and all perish∣ed in the Flames. In the mean while, Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 with Rear Admiral 
Sweers
 Ship, which he was in, and some others of his Squadron, after he had maintained a long and furious Fight, found himself reduced into so pitiful a Condition, that he was forced to retire out of the Fray, to re∣fit and repair his Damages, with Design to return again, as soon as was possible to the Charge. 
De Ruiter,
 tho' weakened by the Retreat of several of the most considerable Ships of his Fleet, which had been already disabled, considering, that the Sun begun to decline, resolved to make a last Effort, to force the Victory to declare it self; and according∣ly gave the Signal to the 
Hollanders,
 to fail on on all sides upon the 
English
 Fleet. At which Signal the Lieutenant Admirals, 
van Meppelen
 and 
de Ʋries,


 as also the Vice-Admirals 
Bankert, Schram,
 and 
Koenders,
 and Rear-Admiral 
Bruinsveld
 broke in among the Enemies with all imaginable undaunted∣ness, and it happened, that Lieutenant-Admiral 
Van Nes
 and Vice-Admiral 
de Liefde,
 with the Rear-Admirals 
Van Nes,
 and 
Evertsz,
 followed by several other Ships, finding themselves below the 
English,
 and Admiral 
de Ruiter
 with the rest of the Fleet, above them, that part of the 
English
 Fleet that was between them, was so furiously attack'd, as was likewise their whole Navy in general, af∣terwards, that in less than half an Hours Fight, they were put in Confusion and begun to fly the se∣cond Time. On the one side were to be seen the 
White Squadron
 with 8 or 10 Men of War flying right before the Wind, and on the other, the Admirals of the 
Red
 and 
Blue
 making likewise full Sail, and doing what else they could, to advance their Re∣treat towards the 
English
 Coasts. In the mean while, the 
Dutch
 Ships at 
de Ruiter
's Signal, took all the 
English
 Ships they came near enough to Board. Rear-Admiral 
Bruinsveld,
 having with much Cou∣rage and Resolution grappled two of the Enemies Frigats, took them, but afterwards, whether it were for want of Order, or by the Fault of those that had the guarding of them, the 
English
 retook them again. Some time after, Captain 
Pauw
 hear∣ing of that Action, fell vigorously upon them again, and wrested them once more out of the Hands of the 
English.
 But one of those Frigats, called the 
Bull,
 was so shattered that she, no longer able to keep the Sea, soon after sunk. The other, called the 
Essex,
 carrying 58 Guns, and less endamaged, was carried into the 
Texel.
 A like Accident hap∣pened to another 
English
 Frigat, but she was reta∣ken by the Enemies. Vice-Admiral 
Koenders
 took likewise at the same time a Ship called the 
Nagel∣boom,
 that was taken from the 
Dutch
 the Year be∣fore, carrying 62 Guns, and sent her into the 
Texel
 Captain 
Ruth Maximilian,
 took also the Ship call'd

 the 
Couvertyn
 of 54 Guns, and sent her into 
Goree.
 Besides them, the 
Dutch
 Officers pretend to know of two 
English
 Ships more that were sunk the Day before, 
viz.
 one of the 
White Squadron,
 swallowed up by the Waves at 6 in the Evening, and a little while after the other met with the same Destiny; which makes us apt to think that several other 
En∣glish
 Ships might have the same Fortune, tho' the 
Dutch
 Officers know nothing of it, the Enemies being in so deplorable a Condition, and pursued by the 
Hollanders.
 It seems, that God, after he had so gloriously favoured the Arms of the Victours, was not pleased they should be utterly defeated by the Destruction of their whole Navy, which appeared as unavoidable: For the shattered Re∣mainder of them miraculously escaped by the Fa∣vour of a thick Fog, about 7 a Clock at Night. However, the 
Dutch
 Fleet being victorious and tri∣umphant, continued to chace them a long time after their being routed, and would have pursued them into their very Ports, if they had not been afraid their Ships would have lost themselves, and have been scattered. And therefore 
de Ruiter
 having fired some Guns for a Signal to advertise all the Ships of his Fleet to veer back towards their Admiral, and the whole 
Dutch
 Fleet thereupon assembling toge∣ther, they sailed away all Night leisurely, and with little Sail homewards.


The next Morning, which was the 
22
th of 
June,
 the 
English
 appearing no more at Sea, the 
Hollan∣ders
 gave over chacing them, and 
de Ruiter
 arrived the same Day, and anchored at 
Wielingen,
 which was the Rendezvous appointed them by the States, his Fleet then consisting of 60 Men of War. Nine 
Holland
 Men of War, besides that Commanded by Colonel 
de Gent,
 which were most endamaged, or who had Orders to guard home the Prises taken from the 
English,
 were already arrived at 
Goree:
 Ten more had been sent before at several Times up∣on the same Errand to the 
Texel,
 which was the

 Place of their Rendezvous. And the four others, as we have already related, were burnt or sunk in the Fight, making in all, with a light Frigat of the 
Meuse,
 that had served the Fleet as an Advice-Yacht, the number of 85 Men of War that com∣posed the Fleet, besides Fireships and Tenders, when it came out of the 
Texel:
 Whereas on the contra∣ry we hear, That the Remainder of the 
English
 Fleet retired in Disorder into the nearest Harbours, and the most of them into 
Harwich.
 To this let us add for conclusion, That the 
Ʋnited Provinces
 have all the reason in the World to thank God for blessing their Arms with so signal a Victory, since without counting in those Ships of the Enemies that were burnt or sunk, of which the 
Dutch
 Officers had no Knowledge, the 
English
 Fleet was weakened with the Loss of 23 Men of War taken or destroy∣ed by the 
Hollanders;
 among which, were an Ad∣miral and a Vice-Admiral: Whereas on the side of the 
Ʋnited Provinces,
 there are counted but 4 lost, neither did there remain any thing in the Hands of the 
English,
 after a Battle of 4 Days, that could shew the least Advantage they had gotten over the 
Hollanders
 that could diminish the Glory of the Vi∣ctory, that was so justly due to them.




This was the Relation publish'd by the States, of the memorable Battle of 4 Days, the Bloodiest and most terrible one certainly that ever was fought at Sea. But the unexpected speedy coming out of the 
English
 Fleet again in little above 6 Weeks after, with much greater Strength than before; and with several of those Ships said to have been lost, took off very much from the Credit of the abovesaid Re∣lation, how Authentick soever it had appeared before. However, that dear-bought Advantage which they called a Victory, was so much the greater on the 
Hollanders
 side; because their Allies, the 
French,
 were not there to share with them in it, but only decoying away a considerable part of the 
English
 Forces to hunt after them, where they were resolved

 not to be found, had left the 
Dutch
 the fair Oppor∣tunity, with their whole Force, to fall upon little more than half the 
English
 Royal Navy. For not∣withstanding all the fair Promises 
France
 had made, to joyn their Fleet to that of the States, and the mighty Hopes they had given them of their great Designs, they all vanisht into Smoak, the 
French
 having no other Design at the Bottom, as has been already hinted, and has since more visibly appeared, but to get their Ships built, to procure Men skilful in Naval Architecture, and to learn the way of Sea-Fight; which they effected first by striking in with the 
Dutch,
 and afterwards perfected by wheedling the King of 
England,
 which has proved since to the Smart of both Nations. In a Word, as to the Fighting Part, the 
French
 left the 
Dutch
 to cope alone with the Maritime Forces of 
England,
 as they did in a following War, the 
English
 to deal with those of 
Holland,
 tho' to hinder 
England
 from putting forth its full Strength, they were pleased to appear with their Fleet to be Spectators of the Fray in which they were sure to be Winners whosoever lost. But to return again to our direct Subject, it may be said, That under God the undaunted Cou∣rage and wise Conduct of Lieutenant Admiral 
de Ruiter
 had the greatest Share in what Advantage was gotten in that fierce Battle against the Potent and Warlike, who tho' outnumbred and overpowered, yet fought so obstinately, that they would in all pro∣bability have ravished the Victory from a less expert and valiant Chieftain than he. For he ranged his People in Battle with so much Judgment, and made them fight in such admirable Order, that in spite of the most desperate Efforts the Enemies could make to break his Squadrons, it was impossible for them to effect their Purpose. For that Great Man was observed with an indefatigable Care, to encourage his Captains and Seamen, and influence them to make his Fleet tack and wheel about with such nim∣ble and well-timed Motions, that at the least signal

 he was immediately obeyed, and thereby lost no opportunity to charge the Enemies where there was any prospect of advantage. But his Courage appeared in its Chiefest Lustre when he had occa∣sion to break into the heart of the Enemies Fleet to relieve any of his Ships and Commanders that were distressed and surrounded by them; so that by his presence and the good Order he gave e∣very where and in every thing, he from the ve∣ry beginning of the fight did all that could be done to trace out himself a way to Victory.


Neither was the bravery of Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 less Admirable than that of 
de Ruiter,
 con∣sidering his undaunted boldness in breaking in a∣mong the Enemies, and in exposing himself so much to the most imminent dangers, that he was several times forced to change his Ship. At the sight of his Flag the Enemies seldom failed soon to turn Tail and fly, looking upon him to be the scourge of their Arms. And because his Flag had been put up in several other Ships he was forced to remove into during the fight, the 
Eng∣lish
 askt, whether there were five or six 
Tromp
's in the 
Holland
 Fleet or no? For indeed, it may be said, he was in a manner every where, never recoiling, but being often enclosed in the midst of the Enemies Squadrons, enduring the greatest fire of their Guns by the terrible and frequent broad sides, they let flie at him. The rest of the Officers of the Fleet, both General and Inferiour, strove likewise with Emulation, which should give the most signal marks of their Courage in that fierce Engagement. However the gaining of that Bat∣tle cost the 
Hollanders
 the Blood and Lives of a great many brave men who died there in the Bed of Honour, 
viz. Cornelius Evertsz,
 Vice Admiral 
Van∣der Hulst,
 Rear Admiral 
Staghouwer,
 the Captains 
Otho Van Treslong, Solomonsz, Jansz, Ʋttenhout, Wouter, Wyngaarden, Adam Hourtuin, Simon Bink,
 and about 800 Seamen or Soldiers. The Num∣ber

 of the wounded amounted to 11 or 1200, a∣mongst whom was Captain 
Vikrot
 who died a little while after at 
Hoorne.
 But the loss of the 
English,
 was as we have said, related to be in∣comparably greater, there being reckoned to be a∣bout 6000 men killed, amongst whom were the Vice Admirals, 
Sir Wil. Barkley
 and Sir 
Christopher Mings,
 and several Captains. And about 3000 
English
 were made Prisoners, that were either saved out of the ships that were sunk, or else found on board those that were taken. Besides which, the 
Holland
 Accounts rec∣kon them to have lost 23 men of War, whereof 17 were said to be burnt, or sunk, and the other 6, 
viz. the Swiftsure, the Loyal George, the Le∣venwolden,
 and 
the Couvertyne
 were carried into 
Goree,
 and 
the Essex
 and 
the Nagelboom
 into the 
Texel.


Amongst other remarkable passages in that fight, the undaunted Resolution of Vice-Admiral 
Barkley
 was much admired, who having 40 men killed on board him, and being no longer a∣ble to make resistance, yet was so obstinately bent to fight, that he would take no quarter, and would have killed with his own hand 3 or 4 of his Enemies that had boarded his Ship; but at last being shot into the throat with a Mus∣ket Bullet, he retired into the Captains Cabbin, where laying himself down at his length on a Table, he was found in that posture dead by the Victors, all over besmear'd with the blood flowing out of his wounds. Rear Admiral 
Sweers,
 hav∣ing boarded Admiral 
Ayschew
's Ship, this Latter delivered to him the Keys of his and yielded himself up to the discretion of the Victour. The 
Hollanders
 took out of his Ship, 500 men, and a little while after the flames get∣ting to the Powder Room, it blew up about 11 a Clock at night. That Ship carried 92 Guns, of which those of the lowest Tire were of thirty six Pounds Bore, and there were 8 of 48. Her whole Compliment of Men was 620, and

 she was the same Ship that the King of 
Eng∣land
 embark'd in when he returned to be Re-esta∣blish'd in his Throne, in 1660. Vice Admiral 
Mings
 having received a Musket shot in his throat stood about half an hour holding his Finger upon the wound, to keep it closed, and to stop the blood, but a second Musket shot taking him in the neck he died, after having given most signal proofs of his Courage to the very last gasp. Admiral 
Ayschew
 was carried to the 
Chatellany
 at the 
Hague,
 on the 16th. of 
June,
 from whence he was Conducted to the Audience of their High and Mightinesses, and afterwards carried to 
Louvestein,
 under a good Guard of Horse, from whence he writ the following Letter to His 
British
 Ma∣jesty.




SIR,


YOur Majesty without doubt has heard of the Battle fought on the 11th. of this month be∣tween the two Fleets, off of 
Duinkerden,
 and the North 
Foreland.
 The Enemies riding at Anchor, cut their Cables at our approach. We charged them fortunately two or three times, but our Forces be∣ing much Inferiour to theirs, and our Fleet falling into a Consternation at the very beginning of the fight, we could not have all the success that was to be wisht for. And therefore the Squadron of Ships un∣der the Command of his H
ghness your Majesties Nephew, would have been a great help to us, if they had not unhappily been sent to the Westward. That day many of our Ships were extremely en∣damaged, in the Number of which was that of the Duke of 
Albemarl.
 Some 
Dutch
 Ships were re∣duced to Ashes, as well by our Fire-ships, as by their Powder taking Fire. The next day we re∣newed the fight with much Resolution and Courage. But on the 3d. day I was enclosed by the Enemies together with some other Ships of my Squadron, and being vigorously attackt was forced to my great

 regret, to yield, through want of power to resist a∣ny longer, I having 
150
 men killed on board me. I am as yet in perfect health, and was removed hi∣ther after I was made Prisoner. When I came on board a 
Dutch
 Rear Admiral, I heard that the Ship committed by your Majesty to my trust, was burnt. My Vice Admiral was also taken, and Sir 
William Barkley
 kill'd. As to what remains, the Silence and Secrecy that prevails here keeps me in Ignorance at present of the other particulars of the fight. The Reports that go abroad here, make our losses to amount to 
36
 men of War taken, burnt, or sunk, and 
4000
 Prisoners. God grant they may prove false. In the mean while, I beseech your Majesty, to take our misfortune with patience, and to have compassion of our Family.




Postscript.


I Have received all imaginable civilities as well from the Officers of the 
Dutch
 Fleet, as from the States General. I was much suprized when I arrived at 
Rottendam,
 to see the Streets so full of Seamen; for I could not Comprehend how so powerfull a Fleet and that was so well mann'd should leave so many Seamen still in the Country.






The States considering the great worth, and noble extraction of Sir 
William Barkley
 who was one of the Kings chief Favourites, and Bro∣ther-in-Law to the Duke of 
York,
 having mar∣ried a Daughter of the Lord Chancellour 
Hide
 about two months before, ordered his Body to be Embalm'd, and deposited at the 
Hague.
 And sent the following Letter to his 
British
 Majesty to inform him of it.




SIR,


WE always thought,
 the honours due to the great men were not incompatible with the duties of War, and that Virtue and Valour ought to

 be respected even in the persons of our Enemies. Which induced us to give some singular marks of it in relation to the Body of S r 
Willaim Barkley
 Vice Admiral of the White Squadron in your Ma∣jesties Fleet. He gave such great proofs of his bravery and undaunted Courage in the last fight, that we were willing to pay those best duties to his Il∣lustrious memory. For that effect we have Order'd his Body to be embalm'd, till such time as his near Relations, and those to whom his memory is dear can otherwise dispose of it, as they shall think best. In the mean while, we have caused it to be placed in the great Church, in a State suitable to his Birth, Valour, and the great Services he has ren∣der'd your Majesty, who may please to send such order concerning it as you shall think fit. And if it be your good pleasure to have it transported into 
England,
 we desire you would be pleased to grant the necessary Passports for the security of the Yacht we intend to give for his Transportation. But if on the contrary, your Majesty shall chuse rather to have him Inter'd in the place where he now is, you will be pleased to let us know your will, to which we shall always endeavour to conform our selves, as far as the present State of affairs will permit. We recommend your Majesties Sacred person to the protection of God, 
&c.




In the mean while, the States to thank God for the gaining of so great an advantage, and to pray him to bless their Arms in the rest of the Course of the War as he had done in those happy be∣ginnings, ordered a Thanksgiving-day, which was solemnly observed the last day of 
June,
 and fol∣lowed by publick Rejoicings and Bonfires, in which not only the people of the United Provinces had part, but likewise all the Countries in which their High and Mightinesses had any Ministers residing. All the Captains of the 
Danish
 Fleet fired all their Guns three times to the honour

 of the 
Hollanders,
 their Allies; And the Queen of 
Denmark,
 gave a splendid Feast to all the Lords and Ladies of the Court, at which the King was present. And the same Rejoicings were celebrated at 
Stockholm,
 at 
Ratisbonn,
 at 
Paris,
 at 
Madrid,
 at 
Genua,
 and at all the Courts of 
Eu∣rope
 where the States had any Ambassadors, which were continued three days together, with Feast∣ings, Fire-works and Vollies of small shot. The Town of 
Brussels
 was the only place that lookt upon all that with an evil Eye. For the 
Mobb
 getting together near the 
Dutch
 Resident 
Sasburg
's house, committed a thousand insolences, and be∣cause they were hindred from pulling down the Scaffolds set up for some Fire works, they were so Transported with Rage and Fury, that they fell upon the house of the Resident, crying out; 
Long live the King of
 Spain 
and the King of
 Eng∣land; and those Mutineers continued their in∣solences till the Marquess of 
Castel Rodrigo,
 Go∣vernour of the Low-Countries reduced them to their duty with a Body of Horse; after which he made excuses to the States, Testifying to them how sensibly displeased he was, that he was not able to prevent all those disorders.


On the 5th. of 
July,
 were performed the Fu∣nerals of Lieutenant Admiral 
Cornelius Evertsz,
 and Vice Admiral 
Vander Hulst,
 to whom great honours were paid. The latter of them was in∣terr'd in the Old Church at 
Amsterdam,
 where a Marble Tomb was erected with his Statue, at the publick charge, in Memory of his great A∣ctions. And his Epitaph was engraven on a Table of Black Marble in these Terms in 
Dutch.

Lieutenant-Admiral 
John Evertsz,
 whose Con∣duct had appear'd suspicious, and whom the States, to appease the incensed People, had order'd to quit his Employment for a time, would needs sollicite for a re-establishment after the death of his Bro∣ther; and for that effect he writ to the States of 
Zealand,
 representing to them, That he passionate∣ly wish'd he might be permitted to render his Ser∣vices to his Country as he had done before, in qua∣lity of Lieutenant-Admiral of that Province: That he ardently desir'd to sacrifice his Life for the Pub∣lick Interest, in so pressing an Occasion as that as

 his Father, four of his Brothers, and one of his Sons had done before him with so much Glory, who all had the Happiness to die in the Service of the State, with their Arms in their Hands, af∣ter they had signaliz'd themselves in many Battels. The States of 
Zealand
 making Reflection upon his consummate Experience in Sea-affairs, and the un∣daunted Courage and good Conduct he had shewn in several Battels, and even in the very last Years Fight, according to the unanimous Testimony of all the Officers of the Fleet, granted his Demands, as being perswaded, that at a time when they had lost so many great Men, this Gentleman might do good Services to his Country by succeeding them. And accordingly having propos'd it in the Assem∣bly of the States-General, they consented to it.


The States Fleet being got ready to put to Sea again, and being 60 sail strong of Men of War or Frigats, unmoor'd on the 5th of 
July
 from 
Wielin∣gen,
 under the Conduct of Admiral 
de Ruiter;
 and some regular Land-Troops, drawn out of the Garrisons, were privately march'd beforehand, to be embark'd on board some Transport-ships, which were design'd to make a Descent. And all the whole Fleet being thus advanced over against 
Schoonevelt,
 was reinforced with 5 Men of War and 7 Frigats, besides another Reinforcement they receiv d some days after, by the arrival of Lieutenant-Admiral 
Tromp,
 and some other general Officers, out of the 
Meuse
 or the 
Texel.
 The great diligence and expe∣dition that was used to get betimes to Sea, and to prevent the 
English,
 made them conceive great Hopes of Success; for they promised themselves to be able to surprize the Enemies, to enter into the River of 
Thames,
 or 
Harwich,
 to make some consi∣derable havock there, and destroy the Enemy's Fleet, or at least to make some Descent. But they were mightily surpriz'd when they saw those Peo∣ple whom they thought they had maul'd and wea∣ken'd beyond a recovery for that Year, appear of

 a sudden towards 
Diep Royal,
 with a Fleet of no less than 88 sail of Men of War or Frigats, 13 Fireships, 20 Advice-Yatchts, besides Transport-ships; so that the 
English
 Fleet, who had had Ad∣vice of the setting out of the 
Holland
 Fleet, knew so well how to secure themselves of all the Posts where any Descent could be made, by placing there both Horse and Foot, that they quite broke all the Designs of the 
Hollanders,
 who saw themselves thereby disabled to attempt any thing for want of good Sounders.


The 
Dutch
 Fleet was divided into three Squa∣drons, the first of which was under the immediate Conduct of Lieutenant-Admiral General 
de Ruiter;
 the second under the Lieutenant-Admirals 
Evertsz,
 and 
Tierke Hiddes de Ʋries;
 and the third was commanded by the Lieutenant-Admirals 
Tromp
 and 
Van Meppel;
 and in that order they kept the mouth of the 
Thames
 shut up till the first day of 
August;
 and then the 
English
 Fleet, being 90 sail strong, taking advantage of the Tide, came out of the River in sight of the 
Dutch
 Fleet, which gave place to them, because 
de Ruiter
 was afraid of run∣ning aground upon the Coasts of 
England,
 and so had done all he could to make his Fleet sheer off to a convenient distance from it, that he might give no Advantage to the Enemy so near their own Coasts. And as it hapned, 'twas a great Happiness for the 
Dutch
 Fleet they had done so; for the next day, the Wind rising high, was follow'd with a fu∣rious Tempest of Thunder, Lightning, and a great Rain; but, which lasted not very long, the next day, 
viz.
 the 4th of 
August,
 the two hostile Fleets anchor'd pretty near one-another, and passed all the Night in presence one of the other.


The 
English
 Navy commanded by General 
Monk
 was composed of 90 sail of Men of War, and 20 Fireships, and was likewise divided into three Squadrons, 
viz.
 the 
White
 Squadron, commanded by Sir 
Thomas Allen;
 the 
Red
 one, under the Con∣duct

 of General 
Monk;
 and the 
Blew
 one, comman∣ded by Sir 
Jeremy Smith.
 The fight begun about noon next day, and was so very disastrous to the 
Hol∣landers,
 that it render'd almost for ever ireconcilable the two greatest Men for Sea-affairs that ever the Ocean bore, or that ever the 
Ʋnited Provinces
 had to command their Fleets; I mean, 
de Ruiter
 and 
Tromp:
 Whether it were that that Misunder∣standing proceeded from the Jealousie 
Tromp
 had conceived, by reason of the 
States
 conferring upon 
de Ruiter
 the chief Command of the Fleet at his return from 
Guiney;
 or whether Providence, that presided over all Events, had a mind to conceal from us the true Cause of it, we know not; but yet methinks 'tis more probable to believe, that Envy, which is always the Enemy of the Vertue and Merit of Great Men, was minded that way spightfully to make a mortal thrust at the Reputation of 
Tromp;
 but that his Reputation was always so well and firm∣ly establish'd in the World, that nothing will ever be able to shake it, nor make the least impression upon it. Let us say then rather, that in the heat of the Fight, and being transported by his natu∣ral Eagerness and Intrepidity, he would needs give chase to the 
English
 Blew Squadron, and that was it that was all his Crime; for if 
de Ruiter
 and the Lieutenant-Admirals 
Evertsz
 and 
de Ʋries
 had gained any advantage over the 
English,
 I am per∣swaded, they never would have complain'd that 
Tromp
 had deserted them. In the mean while, by a sad reverse of Jadish and Unconstant Fortune, the 
Hollanders,
 who had gathered some Lawrels in the precedent Expedition, were forced in this last to yield to the 
English
 the so much contested Em∣pire of the Sea.


The better to satisfie the World of the princi∣pal Circumstances of that famous Fight, we shall insert here the Letters written by the general Offi∣cers of the Fleet, to the 
States,
 about it.






High and Mighty Lords,


SInce my last, of the 4th of this Month, before Noon, the 2 Fleets engaged in Fight, about ele∣ven of the Clock, the Wind at North, our Van∣guard, under the Conduct of Lieutenant-Admi∣ral 
Evertsz,
 begun the Attack, and engaged with the Enemies 
White
 Squadron: The main Battel, under my own Command, fought against the 
Red
 Squadron; but it was a great surprize to me, when I saw Lieutenant-Admiral 
Tromp,
 who command∣ed the Rear, instead of advancing with his Squa∣dron, to lag behind, which gave opportunity to the 
English
 to separate us, and get between him and I. I am also obliged to tell you, That I did not perceive he was in any Action with them till towards Evening, when he fought a very lit∣tle while against some Ships of the 
Blew
 Squa∣dron. However it was, my Ship being attackt by the 
Soveraign
 General, on the one side, and by the 
Naseby
 and several other Ships on the other, withstood the greatest shock of the Enemies, as likewise did my whole Squadron; but we recei∣ved them so vigorously that after an obstinate Fight of three hours, they were forced to quit us for some time. In that while General 
Monk
's Ship was so shatter'd, that he was forced to change his Ship, as we found by the removal of the Admiral's Flag; as was afterwards more par∣ticularly reported to us. We therefore took our advantage of the Respite and Release given us by the 
English,
 to repair our Losses and Damages; and having observed that our Vanguard went still further and further from my Squadron, following the advantage of the Weathergage which they had gotten, I fired some Guns, to command them to veer back towards the Admirals Flag, but that was not able to stop them. The 
English
 Admi∣ral having remarkt that, came pouring with his Squadron upon me and some other Ships belong∣ing

 to my Flag, which engaged me in a cruel fight, which yet I maintain'd vigorously, in hopes that either 
Tromp
 or 
Meppel
 would come in to my assist∣ance from behind, or else Lieutenant-Admiral 
Evertsz,
 who had the Vanguard, from before; but I afterwards found that I had but vainly flatter∣ed my self with that Hopes, so that my Ship ha∣ving had all her Sails and Rigging shot down by the board, I saw my self disabled to govern her any longer: and being thus reduced into a con∣dition not to be able to make any more resistance, by reason of the great number of killed and woun∣ded I had on board me, I was constrained with small sail to follow the body of my Squadron, which began to fly. As for Lieutenant-Admiral 
Tromp,
 who had the weathergage, it was easie for him to have veered back towards us, whereas it was impossible for us to move towards him; and I know not what obliged him not to do it. Seeing our selves thus deserted, we thought there was no other Remedy left for our preservation, but to tack away to the southward, and to fight retreat∣ing: Besides that, the Calm which began to come on would not suffer us quickly to get out of the Fight; and we being likewise glad to make but little sail away, as thinking that by favour of the Night the said Rear might joyn us, and that we might return all together to the Charge, and dispute the Victory with the Enemy. But after all, when the Day was come, we perceived none come near us but the main Body of the 
English
 Fleet, who began to play their Guns upon us in pursuing us: We answered them as well as we could, from behind; but the 
English
 having de∣tached out a Fireship to come and burn me to Ashes, I made my Barge advance, which was backt by some others, into which those brave 
French
 Volunteer Lords, 
de Lorrain, de Lavoy,
 and 
de Coaslin
 leapt with their Retinue, who went and forced the Fireship's Men to jump into the Sea,

 and save themselves by swimming, after they had set Fire to her, and so by that glorious Action pre∣served the Admiral Ship from Flames. In the mean while having discovered some of our Ships that were scattered from us in the Darkness of the Night, the 
English
 sent a Detachment of some Ships from their Fleet to give them Chace; which as soon as I perceived I summoned all the Officers on Board the Admiral Ship, 20 of which were commanded by Order of Vice-Admiral 
Bankert,
 to oppose the Design of the Enemies. As soon as the Account of the Ammunition and Provision, which the said Officers of the Fleet have need of, as also of the Losses and Damages they have suf∣fered, shall be drawn up, as they have represented it to me several times, I will take Care to send it to the Colleges of the Admiralties. I have also been informed in general, with much Regret, of the Death of some of our General Officers and Captains; namely, of Lieutenant Admiral 
John Evertsz,
 who having one of his Legs shot off, died a little after. Lieutenant Admiral 
Tierke Hiddes de Ʋries,
 has likewise a Leg shot off, and is in Danger of Death; his Ship lost us in the Night, and that of Vice-Admiral 
Bankert
 is sunk: Vice-Admiral 
Koenders
 is likewise killed, as also the Captains 
Ruth Maximilian, Jeupian Poel,
 and 
Henry Vroom.
 Captain 
Hugh van Nieuhof
 hav∣ing lost a Leg, and 
Cornelius Hogenhoek
 being wounded in the Belly are also in great Dan∣ger of losing their Lives. As for the Enemies Losses, I have yet no Knowledge of them, but by the Report of the abovesaid Officers, 2 
English
 Ships were sunk, and 2 burnt. However, it is certain, and we were Eye-Witnesses of it, that they were very roughly treated, and that most part of their Ships will be forced to retire soundly bat∣tered. I am peswaded your High and Mightinesses will be informed of it, even before you have re∣ceived this present, 
&c.






Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 coming next Day be∣fore 
Wielingen
 with his Squadron, writ to the States the Letter following.




High and mighty Lords,


YEsterday Morning,
 the Enemies Fleet being about 
90
 Sail strong, came up with us; the Wind was North-East mixt with a Calm, Lieutenant Admiral 
Evertsz
 having the Weather-gage, vigorously attack'd the 
English.
 I commanded the Rear, and that of the Enemies was commanded by Sir 
Jeremy Smith,
 carrying a Blue Flag, through which I opened my self a Passage with my Squadron, till I had gained the Weather-gage; so that the Enemies Rear being thereby separated from their Main Battle, we fought them till N
ght came on, and till at last we put them to the Rout; we chaced them all Night, without being able to hear any thing either of the Vanguard or of the Main Battle. The next morning, finding our selves neer the Galloper, we continued still for some time to pursue the Enemies, but seeing 'twas to no purpose, and that nothing was able to make them stop, we resolved to veer back towards Admiral 
de Ruiter.
 When the flying 
English
 saw that, they veered back towards us, and followed us with little Sail till the Dusk of Night. Then we discovered the main Body of the 
English
 Fleet to Leeward of us; who Luffed, to make up to joyn us; but we could hear nothing all the while neither of Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 nor of the other General Officers of our Fleet, till towards Even∣ing we discerned a Ship coming towards us, which ap∣peared to us to be that of Lieutenant Admiral 
Tierke Hiddes,
 but because she had neither Flag nor Top-mast, we took that for an unlucky presage. We are arrived this Day before 
Wielingen,
 with our Squa∣dron which is still in a good Condition, and wants nothing but Ammunition. If we were so happy as to be informed where Admiral 
de Ruiter
 is, we would use all diligence imaginable to go and joyn him. The Main Body of the Enemies Fleet luffs as much as


'tis possible, so that if no Assistance come in to us, we shall be forced to our great Regret to retire to 
Wielingen.




Lieutenant Admiral 
John Cornelius Meppel,
 who joyntly with 
Tromp
 had given Chace to the 
English Blue Squadron,
 came to an Anchor before 
Ter Veer,
 from whence he writ the following Letter to the College of the Admiralty of the 
North.




Noble and Potent Lords,


THis present is only to let your High and Migh∣tinesses know,
 That on 
Wednesday
 last, the States Fleet engaged in a Fight with the 
English,
 which was so cruel and bloody, that 'tis almost incre∣dible. All the afternoon I fought against the Vice-Admiral of the 
Blue Squadron,
 being backt by the Captains belonging to my own Flag, who seconded me with all imaginable Bravery, so that the abovesaid Vice-Admiral was forced to retire sorely battered. It was then calm Weather, which hindred us from advancing. I have above 
100
 Men killed or wounded on Board me, whom I will endeavour with all speed to send on Shore. My Main Mast has been shot through with 
7
 Cannon Balls, and my Ship is so pier∣ced with Shot too, that 'tis scarce to be believed; I was in Danger of Sinking, and my lower Tire of Guns was already under Water; but the great Diligence we employed in stopping up the Holes, has preserved us. I am sensibly concerned that things did not go, as it was to be wished. However, 
Tromp
 and I for∣ced the Enemies Squadron to betake themselves to Flight, which they continued to do the next Day as fast as they possibly could. And because we thought not fit to pursue them any longer, we tackt about to the Southward, to seek out 
de Ruiter,
 whom we have not been yet able to find, and we are much troubled, he was not seconded. But God knows the Bottom of the Affair, of which doubtless your High and Mighti∣nesses will afterwards be informed.






POSTSCRIPT.


Our Rear-Admiral 
de Haan
 is killed, with 
James Gerritsz Roemer,
 and 
15
 or 
16
 more were likewise killed or wounded. Vice-Admiral 
Schram
 and I are well. Captain 
Isbrand Clement
 has his Leg quasht to pieces; my two Lieutenants are mortally wounded. 
Tys Ryndertsz
 is well.






Seven Days after the Arrival of 
Tromp,
 Admiral 
de Ruiter
 writ the following Letter, as he rid at Anchor between 
Flushing
 and 
Zouteland.




High and mighty Lords,


SInce my last, written on the 5th of this Month, Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 has appeared in the Road with the Squadron under his command, and as far as I could observe as it was passing, it was very lit∣tle or nothing at all endamaged. He has reported to me, That on the 4th towards the Evening, he was in Acti∣on with the 
Blue Squadron,
 which he put to the Rout, after he had burnt one of their Ships carrying 
64
 Guns, whereof 
53
 were of Brass, and a Fireship which he also destroyed with the Flames. The Ship of the deceased Admiral 
Tierke Hiddes de Uries
 is also come, very much shattered, into the Road with the said Squadron of 
Tromp,
 so that of all the States Fleet we have lost only the Ship of Vice-Ad∣miral 
Bankert,
 and that of 
Ruird Hille∣brandt.
 Yesterday in the Evening we came to an anchor between 
Zouteland
 and 
Flushing,
 from whence we perceived the 
English
 Fleet before our Coasts con∣sisting of about 
80
 Sail great and small. I hourly expect the Deputies of your High and Mightinesses, to give Order about all things, 
&c.




Tho' the Loss of this Battle was very sensible to the 
Ʋnited Provinces,
 yet they pretended, the 
English
 had no reason to brag of having got any other Advantage over the 
Dutch
 Fleet than that of

 having divided their Squadrons; tho' 'tis true, they thought by that means the more easily to de∣stroy them one after another. Here follows an ex∣tract of the Letter sent by Prince 
Robert
 and Ge∣neral 
Monk,
 to 
White-Hall,
 after the Fight, by which it appears what their Design was. 
We flat∣tered our selves very much, that
 de Ruiter 
would fall into our Hands; but it was calm Weather, and our small Frigats were not such nimble Sail∣ers as theirs. They were before their own Coasts, and we were afraid of running upon the Sand Banks. In the mean while as we were holding a Council of War, we heard some firing of Guns towards the North-west, which made us presume that it was
 Tromp, 
with
 Smith, 
and therefore we resolved to make up towards him before he approached any nearer Home. But
 Tromp 
retired safely, and we follow∣ed him in the
 Royal Charles, 
till we came within
 6 
Fathoms depth of Water,
 &c.


Smith,
 who commanded the 
Blue Squadron,
 met with but a very ill Reception in 
England,
 because they were the first that begun to flie, and the Offi∣cers of the other 2 Squadrons made great Complaints against him.


In the mean while, the Deputies of the Ad∣miralties and the Plenipotentiaries of the States with the Pensioner 
de Wit,
 came on board Admi∣ral 
de Ruiter,
 as well to inform themselves of the particulars of the fight, as to give orders for put∣ting the Fleet to Sea again with all imaginable di∣ligence. In that time the Differences between the two Admirals 
de Ruiter
 and 
Tromp
 begun to break out. For 
de Ruiter
 complained by word of mouth to the Deputies and Plenipotentiaries, as he had done before by Letter, to the States, of the Con∣duct observed by 
Tromp,
 and openly charged him with all the disorder that had hapned in the Fleet, and with the ill success of the Battle. 
Tromp
 having understood all the shrewd passes 
de Ruiter
 had made at his Reputation, thought

 of nothing more than of Vindicating himself from so great and bloody an outrage, by charging 
de Ruiter,
 in return, with all the blame he imputed to him: And for that effect, he writ the follow∣ing Letter to the States General, and to the States of 
Holland.




High and Mightinesses.


I Find my self indispensably obliged to inform you of all the particulars of the last fight between your Fleet, and that of his 
British
 Ma∣jesty. On the 4th. of this Month, the 
English
 Na∣vy came up right to us, the wind at North-west mixt with a Calm. Our Fleet was to Lee-ward, Lieutenant Admiral 
Evertsz
 having the Van∣guard, advanced in good order by favour of the Wind. At that motion, the White Squadron, followed by the main body of the 
English
 Bat∣tle fell upon him, whilst 
de Ruiter
 who Com∣manded the main body of our Fleet, staid about two hours and an half below the Rear of which I had the Conduct, so that Lieutenant Admiral 
Evertsz
 was already so far advanced, that his Flag was hardly to be discerned, and the great distance there was between the Van and the Main Battle of our Fleet gave the 
English
 the greatest advantage in the world to separate one from the other. And Lieutenant Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 who remained immovable in his post, be∣gan then only to advance to follow 
Evertsz
 when the Van-guards of the two Hostile Fleets begun to Cannonade one another. In the mean while my Squadron that shut up the Rear was forced to remain in its post till 
de Ruiter
 was advanced, and then being impatient to engage, we endeavour'd to gain the Weather-gage, to be able to get up to the 
English,
 whilst a part of the ships of 
de Ruiter
's Squadron were still mingled among ours. As our Squadron was thus advancing in good order, the Rear Admiral

 of the Blue Squadron, followed by a Fire-ship came and fell upon one of our foremost ships, which our Rear-Admiral 
Vander Zaan
 seeing, he set the Enemies Fire-ship on fire with shot from his great guns. The Admiral of the Blue Squadron followed likewise by a Fire-ship came up with me and attackt me, Who was backed by the Captains 
de Haan
 and 
Van Amstel.
 We plaid our Guns at him and at the other 
English
 ships, whereof one being very much shattered, and I finding it was practicable to get the wea∣ther of her, we boarded her, being backt with a Fire-ship, and after we had battered her a long time with continual Broad sides, we fast∣ned our Fire-ship upon her, to burn her to Ashes. That ship was called the 
Resolution,
 and carried 64 Brass Guns, and 2 Iron ones, and having 140 men on board her, whereof 45, among whom were a Pilot and a Quarter Master, were saved by our men. Lieutenant Admiral 
Van Meppel,
 and Vice-Admiral 
Swers
 withstood at the same time a very furious Shock. This latter fought a long time against the Vice-Admiral of the 
Blue Squadron,
 who returned often to the Charge upon him with fresh Men; but he was so vigorously repulsed by the brave 
Van Meppel,
 that he was forced to quit him with Loss; However 
Van Meppel
's Ship was so miserably shattered, that she had above 5 Foot Water in her Hold. Our Squadron therefore be∣ing thus engaged in Fight, separated the 
English
 Rear-Guard from their Main Battle, so that we fought with it till about 5 a Clock in the After∣noon. And my Ship had then fired away 10300
l
 of Powder. The Vice-Admiral of the 
Blue
 which was behind, within Cannon-shot from us, did all he could to burn Captain 
de Haan,
 but the Fire-ship's Crew that were detached for that purpose, seeing our Boats ready to receive them, retired with haste, after they had received some Cannon-shot. We used our utmost Endeavour by towing to get

 up to him, but to no purpose. However, soon after the Wind beginning to freshen, and being turned to the 
South-west,
 we took the Advantage of it to return again to the Charge. And accord∣ingly I gave the Signal for our whole Squadron to fall all together at the same time upon the Enemy; and at the same time our other Ships, the Wind being changed, were endeavouring what they could, to get the Weather-gage. By the Favour of that fresh Gale, we came up with the Admiral of the 
Blue,
 whom we treated so roughly with our Guns, that he was at last disabled; and his Master's Cab∣bin being set on Fire, he fired some Guns to adver∣tise his Vice and Rear-Admirals to veer back to∣wards him to come to his Assistance; but the Ene∣mies fearing the Danger, instead of veering back towards him, shamefully betook themselves to Flight; And had it not been for the Calm which then came on, in all probability, not only that Ad∣miral, but the most part of the Ships of his Squa∣dron would have fallen into our Hands. Having gotten then such great Advantages over the most considerable of the Enemies Squadrons, we were, in the Judgment of all Men experienced in Marine Affairs, engaged to pursue the Victory, and with∣out committing an irreparable Blunder, we could not let them retire without giving them Chace; for supposing we had let the Enemies go off, and turned back to go to the Assistance of Lieutenant Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 besides that the Calm would not have permitted us, we should have been the Cause of the Routing of the Ships of 
de Ruiters,
 and 
Evertsz
's Squadrons, because they would have presumed we had given way, and had the Enemies at our Backs, so that by that means, we should not only have discouraged our own Ships, but have raised the Courage of our Enemies, who would not have failed in that case to pursue us. I leave it therefore to your High and Mightinesses, and to all brave Marine Officers that have long time fre∣quented

 the Sea, to judge, Whether if Lieute∣nant Admiral 
de Ruiter
 had timely cut off the Enemies Vanguard from their main Body, as we did their Rear, we should not have gained a signal Victory? I add, That that might have been exe∣cuted with so much the more Ease, because our Van-Guard was strong enough successfully to have fought that of the Enemies. I protest to your High and Mightinesses, That Partiality has had no share in what has been set forth, I being ready to maintain in the Face of the whole World, that 'tis all conformable to the Truth; and I declare be∣fore God, That I have done nothing that betrays my Intentions, which were for the Good of the Publick, and the Glory of my Country.


And now, High and Mightinesses, I cannot suf∣fer without Reparation, that without having any Regard to all the faithful Services I have done, Ad∣miral 
de Ruiter,
 out of a Principle of Hatred and Jealousie, should offer such a bloody Outrage to my Honour and Reputation, as to make me pass for a villainous and ill-intentioned Man, only because God did me the Favour to make me triumph over the Enemies with a small Force, when he with a Strength incomparably greater, met only with Shame and Disadvantage on his side. So then, if I have in this occasion, acted contrary to my Ho∣nour and Duty, I see my self uncapable for the future to render my Services to my Country. And besides, 'tis not now a Time to suffer any cowardly or villainous Persons in the great Employments at Sea, but it is rather necessary, to make Choice of Prudent and Valiant Captains that may be ready at all times to sacrifice their Estates and Lives for the Good of the State, which Advantages I can with∣out vanity say, I have hitherto possessed in such a manner, that I believe neither Lieutenant Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 nor any other Man living upon the Face of the Earth, is able to ravish them from me. But I apprehend with a sensible Regret, that many Dis∣orders

 will happen in the Fleet; and that the Officers and Seamen, when they come on Shore, will proceed to pernicious Extremities, which I pray God of his Clemency to avert, putting my g eatest Hopes in him, and in the wise Conduct of your High and Mightinesses, whom I recommend to his Holy Protection, and remain, 
&c.




The States of 
Holland
 fearing that Hatred be∣tween the two Admirals might be attended with fatal Consequences, committed that Business into the Hands of some Members of their Assembly, to be examined; and Pensionary 
de Wit,
 who had al∣ways entertain'd an irreconcilable Hatred for 
Tromp,
 for being well affected to the Interests of the illu∣strious House of 
Orange,
 proposed to the Assembly of the States of 
Holland,
 the Resolution of the Commissioners appointed for that purpose, 
viz. That in order to the preserving of Ʋnion and Peace in the Fleet,
 Tromp 
should be cited to come and ju∣stifie himself; That he agreed not with Admiral
 de Ruiter, 
in what he had advanced; That the Service of the State absolutely required, That one of those two Admirals should be put out of his Place; and that they could better be without
 Tromp, 
than
 de Rui∣ter, 
&c.


That Project was approved by the Nobles, and by the Towns of 
Dort, Delf, Leyden, Amsterdam, Gouda, Rotterdam, Gornichem, Schiedam, Schoon∣hoven,
 the 
Brill, Alkmaer, Hoorn, Edam, Meden∣blick
 and 
Purmerend.
 The Town of 
Harlem
 would have 
Tromp
 cited to be examined about the Letter he writ to 
de Ruiter.
 The Town of 
Enku
sen
 was of the Opinion, That Endeavours should be used, to reconcile them together again in a friendly man∣ner. 
Monikendam
 would have 
Tromp
 to present a Petition to beg his Acquittal, but the States at length took the following Resolution.




THE Pensionary has made Report to the Assembly of the Considerations the Deputies of their High and Mightinesses have made,
 in Pursuance of the Commission given them on the 18th instant, concern∣ing the Resolutions their said High and Mightinesses are to take, in order to stop and prevent the fatal Disorders that might happen in the Fleet, and to pro∣vide for the maintenance of that good Ʋnderstanding that ought to prevail among the Sea-Officers, and prin∣cipally upon the Examination that has been made of Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
's Letter to the States, from the Ship called the 
Holland,
 in the Road of 
Flushing,
 dated the 13th instant, in which he gives a particular Relation of what passed in the Fight against the 
English,
 and of the Conclusion he infers thence, as appears by these following Words:


And now, High and Mightinesses, I cannot suffer without Reparation, that in Contempt of all the faithful Services I have rendred Admiral
 de Rui∣ter, 
&c.


Ʋpon which having deliberated, we have judged, That the said Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 after such great Marks of the Hatred and Animosity he has conceived against Lieutenant Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 Commander in Chief of the States Fleet, could not be continued in his Employment joyntly with 
de Rui∣ter,
 without exposing the Fleet to an inevitable Ru∣ine, by the Disorder and Confusion that would pre∣dominate in the Command of it. Wherefore, for the preventing of such great Disasters, it has been re∣solved, and we will, That the Commission of Lieute∣nant Admiral of 
Holland
 and 
West-Friesland
 of the College of the Admiralty of 
Amsterdam,
 provision∣ally granted to the said 
Tromp,
 be Revoked and Re∣mitted by these Presents, and that in consequence of the same, his Employment vacant by his Dismis∣sion shall be filled up with another Officer of Merit: And that the whole may be done in good Order, the Matter shall be put in Execution by the Generality, and the said 
Tromp
 shall be summoned without De∣lay

 before their High and Mightinesses, and at his Arrival his Dismission shall be made Publick, as it ought to be.


Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 then coming to the 
Hague
 on the 23d of the Month,
 in Obedience to the abovesaid Resolution, presented himself next Day before the Assembly of the States; where Pensionary 
de Wit
 told him from their High and Mightinesses, That it was their Will and Pleasure to take from him the Commission of Lieutenant Ad∣miral of the College of the Admiralty of 
Amster∣dam,
 that had been granted him. 
Tromp
 made him answer, That he was ready to pay a willing Obedi∣ence to their High and Mightinesses, with many Thanks besides for the Honours they had done him. But because it was feared some Mutiny might hap∣pen in the Fleet by reason of the great Affection the Seamen bore to 
Tromp,
 the States forbad him to stir out of the 
Hague
 till further Order, and to go or write to the Fleet, upon pain of being accounted the Author of all the Mischiefs that might ensue. And in Truth there was some Danger of it, but the good Order that was given and the Prudence that was used in so Nice a Business as that, restrained the Malecontents within the Bounds of Obedience. The same Day the States of 
Holland
 advanced to the Office of Lieutenant Admiral, vacant by the Dis∣mission of 
Tromp,
 Mr. 
de Gent,
 Colonel of a Ma∣rine Regiment; 
Sweers
 likewise, who was Rear-Admiral before, was made Vice-Admiral of the same College in the Place of 
Vander Hulst, Verburg
 succeeded 
Sweers
 in the Place of Rear-Admiral, and Captain 
David Ʋlug
 was made Rear-Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of the North, in the room of 
de Horn,
 who was killed.


Mr. 
De Gent
 being informed of the Honours the States were doing him, would fain have excused ac∣cepting them, and among other Reasons he repre∣sented, That having frequented the Sea but a little

 while he thought himself not capable to Com∣mand a Squadron; but the States pressing him a∣gain to accept the place that was presented him, and 
Tromp
 with whom we had contracted an in∣timate Friendship, joyning his perswasions with the instances of the States, he was at last prevailed with to consent to it, and accordingly took the Oath in Quality of Lieutenant Admiral of 
Am∣sterdam,
 about the end of the month. Thus 
Tromp
 after he had given so many signal proofs of his Courage, was at length constrained to quit the Sea service.


Hectora qui solus, qui ferrum, ignemque, Jovemque Sustinuit toties, unam non sustinet iram, Invi∣ctumque virum vincit dolor.


The Count 
d' Estrades,
 Ambassador from the Court of 
France
 to the States, observing what had hapned to 
Tromp,
 thought it would be for the in∣terest of the King his Master, to wheedle him to pass into his Service, being perswaded, that Admiral, whilst his resentments were yet boiling hot, would easily be induced to accept the great advantages that he should offer him from the King his Master; and accordingly he made him an o∣verture to that effect, offering him an annual Pen∣sion of 50000 Livers; but 
Tromp,
 to his great surprize, bluntly answered him; That he had ra∣ther live all the rest of his days as a simple Bur∣gher, and continue faithful to his Country, than to betray it at the expence of his own honour, by taking service under a Foreign Prince, what migh∣ty offers soever were made him on that account.


In the mean while, they were busy at work in 
Zealand,
 in Arming out the Fleet with an indefa∣tigable care and diligence, whilst the 
English
 lu∣red on by the hopes of Booty, appeared before the 
Ʋlie
 with a Fleet of 60 sail of men of War. And that they might with the less incumbrance car∣ry

 on so desir'd an enterprize, they had sent all their sick and wounded men back into 
England;
 And 9 or 10 
Dutch
 Merchant ships outwards bound, either to the North, or 
France,
 were newly fallen into their hands. The 
English
 Fleet then approaching near the 
Dutch
 Coast, seemed at first to despair of being able to do all the mischief there they had before flattered themselves with the conceit of, by reason of the difficulties that presented themselves in their way; But being instructed con∣trary to their expectation, how to surmount them, by one 
Heemskerk,
 formerly a Captain in the ser∣vice of the United Provinces, but who was dis∣carded from it for his Cowardice, they were en∣couraged to such an attempt as might make the 
Zealanders
 feel the fatal effects of the loss of the Battle, by a malicious and mischievous enterprize that Traitour proposed to them.


The 
English
 Fleet being arrived on the 17th.
 of 
August
 near the 
Ʋlie,
 got advice by a fisher-man that fell into their hands, that the Isles of 
Ʋlie
 and 
Schelling
 were the most exposed of all those Maritim
 Countries, that there were some Maga∣zines belonging to the States, or the 
East-India
 Chamber, unprovided of any Garrison to defend them, and that there were in the Port a great Number of Merchant-ships richly laden. 'Tis true, those Merchant-ships, as well as those in the 
Texel
 had been advertis'd before hand by the Deputies, to retire in time into Harbours of security, but not being sensible at first, of the importance of those Advices, they unfortunately had ventured to stay behind. The 
English
 therefore together with 
Heemskerk,
 held a Council, and after they had projected their enterprize, resolved to put it in execution the next day at 8 in the morning. By favour of the Tide, and of a North-wind, 10 men of War, 5 fire-ships, and 7 Yachts sail∣ed in as far as below the 
Brandaris
 of the Isle of 
Schelling,
 whilst another Yacht slid into the

 
Ʋlie,
 where she told 160 Merchant-ships, and 2 men of War, their Convoys.


Sir Robert Holms,
 of whom we have already spo∣ken several times, was the Head of that enter∣prize. He considered, that if he attackt the Isles first, the Merchant ships would thereby gain time to provide for their security, and therefore detacht away 2 Frigats which entred into the 
Ton∣n
n,
 and followed them with the rest of his ships, but being stopt by a contrary wind, he was for∣ced to fall back again towards the 
Brandaris.
 Then after he had held a Council of War, he ordered the 
Pembroke
 Frigat followed by 5 fire-ships, to advance to go and attack the Merchant fleet. And accordingly Captain 
Brown,
 having fastned upon the ship of Captain 
Adelaar,
 one of the chief of the Convoys, reduced her to ashes. The Captain after he had made all the resistance possible, leaping at last into a Boat with sixteen 16 of his men, to save himself, both he and they were unhappily swallowed up by the Waves. The second Convoy ship was likewise burnt, but 
Tol,
 the Captain of her was more lucky than his Com∣panions, for he escaped in his Boat. The Mer∣chant ships cut their Anchor Cables at so horri∣ble a spectacle to flie as well as they could from the fury of the flames. In the mean while the men in the three 
English
 Fire-ships that still re∣mained advanc'd? Crying out! 
I am Heemskerk the Author of the enterprize;
 and set fire to some Merchant ships richly laden, and bound for 
Mus∣covy,
 which after their men had signaliz'd them∣selves to the utmost in their defence, were like∣wise burnt to ashes. After that, the 
English
 with 22 Boats went out of the 
Brandaris,
 and by fa∣vour of their Oars and the Tide together gave chace to the Merchant ships, that were flying, and all of them they could reach, they set on fire with flaming trusses of straw which they threw into them. However, because the 
English
 Seamen were

 Commanded under pain of death not to pillage, the Pilots and Masters of the 
Dutch
 ships found opportunity by that means to save their men and their Money in their Boats. Some of those un∣happy wretches that dwelt in the 
Ʋlie,
 fearing the 
English
 would come and plunder the Isle, had with-drawn their best effects from thence, and transported them on board the Merchant-ships, so that they had the cruel displeasure to see them destroyed by the flames. Three Privateers and one Merchant ship bound for 
Guiney
 well Arm'd and Provided with able Seamen made a very vi∣gorous resistance; for they repulsed the 
English,
 and sunk some of their Boats, so that under their shelter, several rich Merchants designed for 
Mus∣covy
 were preserved from the Enemies fire, who durst follow them no further for fear of running a∣ground.


Holms
 being informed by some Prisoners, that the 
Ʋlie
 likewise was in no condition to defend it self, detacht away two Frigats and some small Vessels, with orders to Land their men in the Fort: But a Tempest arising with a most ter∣rible rain that lasted all night, it was impossible for them to put their project in execution, because their powder, and other necessary materials to do execution withal were wetted, and their matches Quencht: And besides, the men that were Com∣manded out upon that design were so miserably Weather-beaten, that they were quite spent, so that 'tis certain if the 
Dutch
 had had so much presence of mind with them, as to have sent thi∣ther three Companies of Seamen that were hard by, the 
English
 Incendiaries would have been in great danger of being totally defeated, because their Boats being most of them staved to pieces by being tost against the shore, were then become most of them but the sport of the Waves. But their attempts had more success in the Isle of 
Schelling,
 for having landed 11 Companies of Re∣gular

 Troops near the 
Brandaris,
 without meet∣ing with the least resistance from the Inhabitants, the most part of which are Fishermen, and 
Men∣nonites,
 a sort of Sect that think all War unlaw∣ful, 5 Companies of Incendiaries advancing to the Windward, set on fire 350 houses, and amongst them, the Church of the reformed was also half burnt down, and it was one of the saddest spe∣ctacles in the World, to see the poor inhabitants of that place in the utmost desolation, and the af∣frighted women running cross the Country with their little Children in their Arms, seeking to save them both from the rage of the Incendiaries, and the fury of the flames. In fine the 
English
 pil∣laged what the fire had spared.


Holms
 would have carried on those strange succes∣ses further into the Country, and two other Villa∣ges in the same Isle were just ready to be treat∣ed after the same rate; but that being obliged to stay till 24 hours were past, before he could at∣tempt any thing more, and to wait for a favour∣able wind to execute his enterprize, and besides, finding that the inhabitants having begun to Re∣trench themselves at the East-ward of the Village, had raised two Batteries, and expected every mo∣ment some Cannon from 
Enkuisen,
 he thought it would be two hazardous to push his design any further, and that it would be much better to think of retreating, and so ordered all his men to return immediately on board, and on the 20th. of August he rejoined the 
English
 Grand Fleet, by order of Prince 
Robert
 and General 
Monk,
 who seeing that sickness begun to reign amongst their Men, made sail back towards the Coasts of 
England.


The States being sensibly concerned at the mis∣chief done by the 
English
 Incendiaries to those poor Islanders, watcht all opportunities to Return them a Rowland for their Oliver, and in little time after, met with a very favourable one to wreck part of their Revenge. For two 
Dutch


 men of War that were convoys, seconded by two others that had rid a good while at Anchor un∣der 
Gluckstadt,
 fell on the 27th. of 
August
 with a fair Wind, upon a Merchant Fleet of 17 
Eng∣lish
 ships that were at an Anchor near the 
New-Mill,
 and fired so terribly at them with their Guns, that not knowing where to shelter them∣selves, they cut their Anchor Cables, and fled to save themselves. But when they of 
Hamborough
 saw them approach towards their Town, they sounded an alarm; all the streets were in a mo∣ment filled with people, and it being just at the beginning of night, all the Town was on a sud∣den enlightned with a Million of Candles and Torches, and the Burghers were all in Arms. A∣bout 9 of the Clock, 4 Merchant ships, 
viz.
 3 
English,
 and one 
Hamburgher
 were on fire, this last hapning unluckily to ride too near the others, and if the wind had not chopt about to the North, it is certain, that all the rest that escaped, would have likewise been reduced to Ashes. Two days after that expedition, 
de Ruiter
 was sent for to come ashore, to speak with the Count 
d' Estrades
 the 
French
 Ambassador, the Marquess of 
Belle∣fonds,
 and the Deputies of their High and Migh∣tinesses, which were met there, to treat about the place where the 
French
 Fleet was to join that of 
Holland.
 For the Duke of 
Beauford,
 Admiral of 
France,
 had been a long time expected home, and they had received advice, that he was ready to quit the Coasts of 
Portugal
 whither he was gone some months before, in order to return to 
Rochel∣le.
 In the mean while, the most Christian King had Commanded the Count 
d' Estrades,
 to present the Order of 
St. Michael
 to 
de Ruiter,
 in acknow∣ledgment of the undaunted Courage and Singular Conduct he had shewn in the last Battle. But to return to what concerns the pretended Junction of the two Fleets, the Court of 
France
 after their usual manner, contented themselves with bubling

 off the 
Hollanders
 with fair promises and specious hopes that vanisht all but into smoak; for the Jun∣ction, as it was never intended, so it was never made.


The States Fleet being got ready, unmoor'd on the 5th. of 
September,
 consisting of 71 men of War or Frigats, and 27 fire-ships. Besides the New Of∣ficers abovementioned, Vice Admiral 
Bankert
 suc∣ceeded as Lieutenant Admiral in the room of 
John Evertsz;
 and Captain 
Matthysz
 was made Rear-Admiral of 
Zealand.
 The fleet was divided into 3 Squadrons; the first was Commanded by 
de Rui∣ter
 himself; the second by Lieutenant Admiral 
de Gent;
 and the third by Lieutenant Admiral 
Bankert.
 On the 8th of 
September,
 the 
Dutch
 fleet came to an Anchor between 
Dunkirk
 and 
New∣port,
 and upon some advice receiv'd from 
Paris,
 that the Duke of 
Beauford,
 Admiral of 
France
 had un∣moor'd from 
Rochelle:
 Nay, and that he was come al∣ready as far as the mouth of the Channel, in order to join 
de Ruiter,
 the States fleet weighed Anchor on the 11th. in the morning, and made sail towards 
Callis
 and 
Bullen:
 Where the Vice Admirals 
Sweers,
 and 
Evertsz,
 meeting with a great 
English
 ship, called the 
Loyal Charles,
 carrying 56 Guns, and 200 men, they took her. She had underwent a most terrible Tempest, in which she had lost her Fore-mast and Bolt-sprit, so that 
de Ruiter
 order∣ed her to be burnt. About noon, he heard, that the 
English
 fleet consisting of above 100 sail was following after that of 
Holland,
 whereupon 
de Rui∣ter
 presently put up a Red Flag as a signal to his fleet to fall all together at the same time up∣on the Enemies. But the 
English
 Admiral tacking about to the North ward, sheered away with all his Navy from the 
Dutch
 fleet, which chased them, and fired at their Rear, in the view of an infi∣nite Number of People that were got together on the Coasts of 
France,
 and were spectators of the da∣ring Courage of the 
Hollanders,
 and of the Re∣treat

 of the 
English,
 who, as was supposed, for want of Men, who in great Numbers had been swept away by Sickness, contented themselves only with making a Shew at Sea, but did not think fit to hazard an Engagement, and so made towards 
Ports∣mouth.
 And as for the Admiral of 
France,
 he ap∣peared not, and so 
de Ruiter
 being weary of wait∣ing so long for him in vain, had Orders from the States, to conduct the Fleet back again into their respective Ports, and only to detach a Squadron out of them of 25 Men of War, to cruise to the North∣ward, to look for the Ships that were expected com∣ing back from the 
East-Indies.


Four Days after, the States had News of the Burning of 
London
 by the most terrible Fire that ever was yet seen.
 For beginning on the 12/2 of 
Septem∣ber,
 it made such an Advance by favour of the Wind, that it was not extinguished till the 16/6th, that is to say, 5 Days after, when at last they were fain to smother it by blowing up some Houses, as the last Remedy that could be thought of. It seemed as if Fire had been fallen from Heaven to punish that proud City, and that God, the just Revenger of Crimes had determined to reduce it into Ashes, or at least to chastise it in such a manner, that it should for ever wear lasting Marks of his Punishment. For that dreadful Conflagration extended from the 
Tower
 to 
Temple-bar,
 and in all that space, there remained not a House standing all-a-long by the 
Thames,
 so that it may well be said, That by that Judgment the Inhabitants of that great City, and even of all 
England
 suffered Losses incomparably greater and more sensible than the 
English
 had lately caused to the Inhabitants of the Isles of 
Ʋlie
 and 
Schelling,
 which were esteemed at Twelve Millions of 
Livers,
 whereas those of the 
English
 amounted to One hundred Millions. And the Desolation was so great that Multitudes of People were seen to wan∣der about almost in deep Despair without any Home or other Place of Shelter to go to, and were reduced

 to the greatest Depth of Misery, and would have perished by Hunger, if the King had not ordered some Provision to be made for their Subsistance, other particulars as well known, and amply recited in other Writings obvious every where, we shall omit to insert here.


The Pensioner 
de Wit
 upon that Advice, as he was an implacable Enemy to the King of 
England,
 as well as to the House of 
Orange
 so nearly allied to that Royal Family, and had secretly blown up the Fire of that War, resolved to make his best Advantage of it, and presently writ to Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 to let him know, That so fatal and unforeseen an Acci∣dent as that, might possibly induce the States to change the Resolution they had before taken, to lay up their Fleet in their Ports, because it had been certified from good Hands, That 
Monk
 was returned to 
London,
 and therefore it was easie to presume, the 
English
 Fleet would not be so soon ready to unmoor. And the States accordingly by his Instigation writ to 
de Ruiter
 on the 26th of the same Month, that upon a piece of News of so great importance, they had resolved to keep their Fleet out still at Sea, till fur∣ther Order. 
De Ruiter
 obeyed their Order, but without any Success at that Time: For the 
English
 sailing out again on the 5th of 
October,
 made a Mo∣tion as if they would advance to attack 
de Ruiter,
 but as soon as they saw him move towards them to engage them, they sheered away again to avoid him. At that time the Duke of 
Beauford,
 Admiral of 
France
 sent 
de Ruiter
 Word, that it was impossible for him to come and joyn him, and therefore desi∣red him to excuse him for having put in with the 
French
 Fleet into 
Brest.
 So 
de Ruiter
 seeing there was no appearance of attempting any thing to ef∣fect, retired again about the middle of 
October
 with his Fleet, whereof a part put into 
Zealand,
 another into the 
Meuse,
 and the rest into the 
Texel.




A little time after, there were some happy steps made towards a Peace for the States, as we have already said, having written to the King of 
England
 about the Funeral of Sir 
William Barcley,
 that Prince was so sensibly touched with the oblig∣ing Deportment of the States in that matter, and with the Honours they had rendred to the Memory of a Person that was so dear to him, that he return∣ed them Thanks for it by the following Letter, dated the 11th of 
August.




High and Mighty Lords, and Right Dear Friends,


WE have seen by your Letter,
 dated the 10th of 
June,
 brought to us by a Trumpeter, a glorious Example of your Civilities, concerning the Honours you have been pleased to render to the Body of Sir 
Wil∣liam Barkley,
 who after having signalized himself, lost his Life for the Service of his Prince and Coun∣try: After his Death, he fell into your Hands by the Fortune of War, and the Honours you have ren∣dred to his glorious Memory were very pleasing to me; I shall always consider them as an effect of your ge∣nerous Good Will, and whenever the like occasions shall happen, we will endeavour on our part to answer them, by acknowledging Vertue and Merit even in the Person of our Enemies, to whom we shall give Proofs of our Tenderness, as far as the Occurrences of War shall permit us. And because the near Relations of the Deceased desire, his Body may be interred in the Tomb of his Ancestors, upon the Offer you have made us, to grant them that Favour, we have consented to it; and that the Vessel designed for his Transporta∣tion may not be attacked in its Passage by our Subjects, we have added to this inclosed, the necessary Passport. Besides, we assure you from the bottom of our Heart, That the Advantages our Arms have lately gained by the Blessing of God, shall not render us so haughty, as to make us forget the Damages the present War causes to the Reformation, and how great the Hopes

 are that our Enemies have conce
ved from our Trou∣bles and Dissentions: So that we are ready to put our hand to so pious a Work, as is that of pacifying them, upon the first Just and Reasonable Condition that shall be proposed to us on that Subject.




The States comprehending by the Expressions con∣tained in the King of 
England
's Letter, That that Prince seemed more inclinable to terminate the War, and to hearken to Propositions of Peace, than for∣merly, writ to him the following Letter, dated the 16th of 
September,
 by the Yacht ordered to trans∣port into 
England
 Vice-Admiral 
Barkley
's Body.




SIR,


BEing informed by your Majesty's Letter of the 4th of the last Month, that your Intention was, That Sir 
William Barkley
's Body should be trans∣ported into 
England,
 in order to be delivered into the Hands of his Relations, we accordingly send it, to satisfie the Offers we made your Majesty to that effect.


Moreover, we have with much Pleasure seen the good Disposition in which your Majesty is, menti∣oned towards the close of your Letter, which sig∣nifie the Inclination your Majesty would be pl
ased to have to put a stop to that Current of Mischiefs the War has lately brought upon the two Nations, with this Clause, 
As soon as your Majesty shall be invited to so holy a Work by reasonable Cond
t
ons.
 We therefore doubt not of the sincerity of the so often repeated Protestations newly made, signi∣fying your Inclination for a Peace: But we are not ignorant likewise, that you are perswaded there will be no Advance made towards Peace, so long as you shall make no Overture of the parti∣cular Conditions upon which you judge it might be concluded. However, we on our side have given all imaginable clear Explications of our sense thereupon by our Ambass
do
r, whom we ordered

 to stay in the Court of 
England
 expresly upon that account, tho' your Majesty had already recalled yours. Mr. 
Van Beuningen,
 our Minister extra∣ordinary at the 
French
 Court, renewed them in the last Place in presence of the Queen your Majesty's Mother, to Mr. 
Hollis
 your Embassador, without receiving any positive Answer thereto from your Majesty. We could not with Justice, according to what is practised in such Negotiations, have or∣dered our Minister in the Conference held at 
Paris
 with the said 
Hollis,
 to sollicit him to make the Overture of the Conditions upon which your Majesty pretended to make Peace, as we had done, or at least to have agreed beforehand, that your Majesty should give a final Answer, sincere, and without Reserve to the Advances we had made, and that in a prefixed Time: But however to give Proofs at the very first of the ardent Passion that induces us to labour to bring about so Christian a Work, we have passed over all those Formalities, making it our Glory to make the first Advances, and to go as far with them on our side as is possible, hoping that your Majesty acting in the same man∣ner, the so much desired Peace might be conclud∣ed without delay, and that by that means the effu∣sion of so much Christian Blood as was shed in the ensuing Battles might have been prevented. And since by the Letter of the 11th of 
December
 last Year, and afterwards in the Conference held at 
Paris,
 it was proposed to your Majesty's Choice to treat of Peace, either under condition, That both Parties should mutually restore all that each of them had taken from the other before or after the War, and thence to pass to the Examination of the Pretensions that were in question before the War; or that each Party should keep the Con∣quests they had made before or after the Rupture, with respect to the Time when the said Offer was signified to the Parties; and that in consequence of that, all the Pretensions concerning any Losses

 or Damages suffered, should be forgotten, and held for Null on both sides. It seems to us, That the Clause specified in the abovesaid Letter of your Majesty is already fully executed, and that thereby your Majesty has been several times invited to the Conclusion of so pious a Work. For we cannot persuade our selves, that as to what concerns the Offer of the abovesaid Conditions, there can be any proposed more advantageous, if Regard be had to Reason and to the Justice of the Cause, considering that all we possess, or that we have taken from your Majesty or your Subjects, is adjudged to be good Prize, and ought to be pre∣served according to the Laws of a just War, since we took up Arms only for our own Defence; whereas, on the contrary, all that has been taken from the 
Ʋnited Provinces,
 or their Subjects, which amounts to above 100 Ships, with their Mer∣chandises and Effects, as likewise the Fort of 
S. Andrew,
 the Isle of 
Boavista, New Holland,
 and 
Cabo Corso,
 all that was taken by Surprize un∣justly, and without any Declaration of War. And yet your Majesty slighting so advantageous a Proposition, never considered to explain your self openly, nor to determine upon the Choice either the one or the other of the proposed Condi∣tions, or so much as to relate the Reasons you had to reject them, or at least to make us a clear and sincere Overture of what other Conditions might have induced you to a Peace, to which we have often solicited you. On the contrary, your Ma∣jesty broke off the foresaid Conference, which was the greatest Hopes of those that ardently de∣sire Peace, and which was happily begun in the pre∣sence of the Queen your Majesty's Mother; you broke it off, we say, by the sudden recalling of your Ambassador, without shewing any manner of way your Approbation of it. Things being thus, we leave your Majesty to judge, what all those general Protestations of Affection and Passion of

 Peace can tend to so long as they shall not be fol∣lowed by particular Conditions which are to be the Foundation of it. And because Experience teaches us, That the Mediation of Foreign Power is not unprofitable but may contribute much to the Conclusion of so holy a Work, that Consideration induced us to determine to accept of the Mediati∣on of the King of 
Swedeland,
 in the Confidence we have, that that Prince being equitable, will have regard to the just and Advantageous Proposi∣tions we make, tho' that Prince having been put by your Majesty into the Number of your Allies, it seems obvious, that we might look upon him as suspicious, and a Party adverse to us, and conse∣quently as one interested in the Treaty. Besides that, your Majesty has declared, You could not enter into Negotiation without his Consent. The Kings of 
France
 and 
Denmark,
 who are in War as well as we, against your Majesty, have in like manner accepted the said Mediation of 
Swedeland.
 We made no Difficulty at the very first Offer made to us of it, to give our Consent to it in Writ∣ing, that it might be presented to your Majesty; but yet hitherto, whatever Instances have been made, it has been impossible for us to induce the Minister of the Crown of 
Swedeland
 residing here, to make us the same Declaration from your Majesty; namely, Whether you would please to accept of the said Mediation of 
Swedeland
 or no? as well in regard of our selves, as of the Kings of 
France
 and 
Denmark
 our Allies, which being once granted, we protest again once more, not only in general Terms, that we continue still in the vio∣lent Passion that incites us to the Conclusion of a solid Peace, but we make all the particular Advan∣ces besides that Right and Justice can exact of us. And because a general Declaration that com∣prehends no real express and reasonable Condition, either on the one side or the other is more capable to produce new Umbrages, and leave the Mind in

 suspense, than to promote a Treaty of Peace, we declare consequently, That we stand to the Propo∣sitions that were made on our part in the Confe∣rence held at the Court of 
France
 in the presence of the Queen, your Majesty's Mother, as has been already related.


In fine, we pray your Majesty to confirm the general Profession and Protestation you have made, That you desire nothing more than Peace, and to be pleased to joyn to it a particular Declaration, that may shew that you determine upon the Choice of one of the Conditions, which you may think convenient for that purpose; and in consequence of it, your Majesty is also prayed to be pleased to let the said Conference already begun to be conti∣nued, as well in respect of the Place, as to the Per∣sons. But if your Majesty should make any Scru∣ple to do it, and should have any Reasons not to consent to it, that then your Majesty would con∣sent that the Mediating Ministers of the Crown of 
Swedeland
 may make Choice of another Place, where not only our Plenipotentiaries, but likewise those of our Allies as well as those of your Ma∣jesty may be obliged to meet with all Diligence. And we shall take it for one of the greatest Testi∣monies of the sincerity of the Protestation your Majesty has so often repeated concerning Peace, if it stir up no Jealousie nor Disunion between us and our Allies, to obstruct it.


In fine, we will wait your Majesty's Declarati∣on in Writing, which being signified to us by the Minister of 
Sweden,
 by which the Mediation of that Prince, presented to all the Members of the League, as well to the aforesaid Kings of 
France
 and 
Denmark,
 as to us, shall be authorized. And we pray God to inspire your Majesty with such Sentiments for Peace as we have our selves, and such as may consequently move you to resolve to make Choice of the necessary means whereby to promote so great a Work; that so we may in a

 short time enjoy the Effects of a firm, solid, and inviolable Peace, to be concluded between your Majesty, and the Powers at present in War against 
England:
 And for our particular, we shall make most ardent Prayers to God for the Prosperity of your sacred Person, and for the Subjects of the two States.




The King of 
England
 made the following Reply to the States.




High and Mighty Lords,


WE received Yours of the 16th of the last Month,
 which was delivered us by one of your Trumpeters that accompanied the Body of the Deceased Sir 
William Barklay,
 in order to be committed into the Hands of his near Relations. We consider that Mark of your Civility with all possible Resentment, and we pray you to be per∣suaded, that we will do the same by you, as often as occasion shall serve.


As to the other Part of your Letter, concerning Peace, and the frank and free Answer we made you on the 14th of 
August,
 by inviting you to seek it, we cannot enough complain, That all the Ad∣vances we have made for that purpose, should end in no other effect, but to make us be charged with ill-grounded Reproaches that openly condemn the manner of Acting we have observed, tho all the World be informed to the contrary. Those are without doubt such Preliminaries, as are not very capable to facilitate it, and tis a thing altogether surprizing, that you should endeavour to persuade your own People, and all 
Europe
 at the same time, That we are the Aggressors and Authors of the fatal Consequences which have been enkindled between us: You unjustly accuse us of shutting our Ears to all the Proposals you make for an Accommoda∣tion, by refusing to inform you of our lawful Pre∣tensions: In fine, you pretend that we alone re∣ject

 it, whilst you and your Allies desire it, and passionately seek for it, whereas the Truth is, you your selves have to this very present Day refused to make the least step that was capable to advance it, and to extinguish the fatal Torch of War. This conduct so contrary to your pretended Intentions, obliges us for the Defending of our Honour, and the Justice of our Cause from such sensible Out∣rages, to declare before the Face of the whole World, how ill-grounded your Reproaches are: It forces us, I say, to renew once more the Advan∣ces we have made for the Re-establishment of Peace, ever since the very beginning of the War, and which yet you have always rejected. We protest to you then, that, if you think fit, for the Time to come, to charge your selves with all the Blame, which engages our Honour to provide for its Secu∣rity, then we may by the Assistance of Heaven, deliberate with Success about the means that shall be judged proper to pacifie our Troubles, and put a stop to the cruel Effusion of so much Protestant Blood. In the mean while we cannot forbear re∣lating the following Particulars, to undeceive the Publick.


1. That we have made several pressing Instances, but all to no purpose, to move you to make Repa∣ration for the Damages suffered by us and our Subjects, which you were engaged to do by the last Treaty, which was not violated on our part.


2. That the Commanders of your Fleet in the 
East-Indies
 prohibited our Ships under the Com∣mand of the Earl of 
Marlborough,
 the Entrance, of a Harbour, where there had been a long Time an 
English
 Manufactory settled, provided with a great Quantity of Merchandises designed for the lading back of the said Ships at their Return; all which Merchandises were soon after stopt by your Officers, under pretence, That you having declar∣ed War against the Princes with whom we pre∣tended

 to trade, it was no longer lawful for us to have any more Commerce with them. And about the same Time, that Imperious and Extravagant Declaration was published likewise in your Name, in 
Africa,
 by the Officer that commands there for you, with a Prohibition to all our Subjects to traffick with the Inhabitants of that Country; so that when we demanded Reparation for the Da∣mages suffered, shewing you an Authentick Copy of the Declaration lately published there in your Name, against the Glory and Interest of the Kings and Princes that have Commerce there, and that are not able without Resentment to endure so cruel an Outrage, you were pleased to disown that At∣tempt, and absolutely refused to give us any Satis∣faction.


3. We say, That as soon as ever your Ambassa∣dour complained of the Hostility lately committed by Captain 
Holms
 in taking of your Fort near 
Cape Verd,
 we assured him upon our Royal Word, That that Attempt was committed without our Knowledg and Participation; so that after having disavowed it, we summoned him up to appear here, and after having seriously examined the Affair, we declared, that the said 
Holms
 should be punished according to the Rigor of the Laws, if he were found guilty, with Intention to make Reparation for the Dama∣ges you had suffered. But that Protestation, how sincere soever it were, was not capable to satisfie you, tho' it ought to have done so however, ac∣cording to the Tenour of the Treaty: On the contrary, you persisted to reproach us with having authorized the Insult made by the said Captain; who being at length come back into 
England,
 we forbad him to present himself at Court, and what is more, we committed him presently to the 
Tow∣er
 of 
London,
 where he continued Prisoner till after the Rupture. And yet your Ambassadour never in all that Time advanced any thing against him, that was a sufficient Ground to bring him to

 his Trial; And what is more, 
Holms
 alledged, That before he attacked your Fort, he intercepted in his Way to 
Guiney,
 Orders by which your Officers were enjoyned to seize upon the Castle of 
Cor∣mantine,
 which they afterwards actually at∣tacked.


4. The Isle of 
Poleroon
 was not delivered into our Hands, according to the Conditions of the Trea∣ty, tho' we were engaged to great Expences, in Arming out two Fleets at two different Times, which we sent thither to go and take Possession of it; the Governours excusing themselves, by the Orders that had been signified to them, alledging they were not sufficient for their discharge.


5. We say, That 
de Ruiter
 had order to attack our Subjects, at the same Time when you caused Instances to be made to us, to stop the Departure of our Fleet designed for 
Guiney,
 under fair Ap∣pearances, That your Fleet should stay in their Ports in Expectation of coming to an Accommoda∣tion; at a Time, I say, when you were solliciting us to joyn our two Fleets together, to go and re∣duce the 
Corsairs
 of 
Algiers
 to their Duty, which we consented to with Pleasure. And yet 
de Ruiter
 separating himself from our Forces in the 
Medi∣terranean,
 without giving the least Notice of his Design, went to the Coasts of 
Guiney
 to commit all sorts of Hostility against our Subjects, and to seize upon the Country under our Obedience. All that passed before we had caused any of your Ships that were stoped, to be sold, or that we had attempted the least thing against your Subjects. These Five Points being proved, and being entirely conformable to the Truth, as we have shewn, and all these things having past before we thought of providing for our Security, by using the means an Offensive War engaged us to, we doubt not but you will pass in the World for the Aggressors, and that our Honour will for the future be safe from being aspersed with the Blame which ought wholly

 to be charged upon you. A War being thus kindled then, and God having blest our Arms with happy success, we find our selves so much the more inclined to Peace, and evidently to set forth the sensible outrages that are done us, by representing as if we were obstinately bent to continue the War by refusing to propose pro∣per means to procure a Peace.


As for the overture made to us by your Am∣bassador during the time he remained in this Court, we refer our selves to the answers we made to all the memorials he presented us, which give sufficient Testimony of the inclinations we have for Peace.


As to what passed in the particular Conferen∣ces we had together, it is easy for you to satis∣fy your selves about it by the faithful Report of a man of Honour in whom we have had an extream confidence, and we wish he would de∣clare himself, whether we have not always Te∣stified a great Aversion to War, and as much inclination for Peace as a Christian is obliged to have, not thinking it fit to commit particulars to writing, that we might not expose our selves to those Inconveniences which your manner of pro∣ceeding would have excited at that time.


As for what concerns the recalling of our En∣voy from the 
Hague,
 before your Ambassador was called from 
London,
 it is notorious, he was dri∣ven thence by the cruel Treatments used to him, for being dispoiled of all the privileges annext to his Character, his Domesticks being imprison∣ed, and notwithstanding all the Complaints made of it from us, and the promises made us, that the like should not happen any more, his secre∣tary being put also under an arrest, without a∣ny reasonable pretence, and guards being placed before his house, and nothing having been neg∣lected that was capable of stirring up the 
Rab∣ble
 to rise upon him, all those violences, I say,

 obliged him to provide for the security of his person by a handsom retreat.


'Tis true, the most Christian Kings Ambassa∣dors, after a stay of some months, and after we had accepted their Mediation, made us some par∣ticular propositions, but it is true likewise, that they afterwards disavow'd them, as they were ordered by you to do, and gave us to under∣stand, that you had absolutely disapproved them, in confidence that the sickness that reigned then in our Kingdom had so much weakned it, and reduced our people into so pitious a Condition, that it would be impossible for us to put out our Fleet to Sea again. The Ambassadors of the Court of 
France
 presented afterwards some other Memorials, assuring us from the King their Master, that he would engage to make you con∣sent to the project that had been proposed; and that as to what concerned the exorbitant and unreasonable demand we had made, it seemed improper to serve for the ground of a Treaty; adding, that your Ambassador might receive full power to treat of those propositions, or else of some others equally profitable to both Parties. And there their Mediation ended, so that they de∣parted, after having declared, that upon the re∣fusal of the abovesaid propositions, their Master would be obliged to assist you during the rest of the War. Things then having past in that manner, 'tis easy to Judge whether we are at pre∣sent in a State to make you any other proposals on our part.


As to what passed at 
Paris
 between our Am∣bassador Extraordinary, and Mr. 
Van Beu∣ningen,
 we think our selves obliged to relate it a little at length, to undeceive the pub∣lick, by informing them what pains was taken, to perswade them, that we were formally en∣tred into a Negotiation, that reasonable and advantageous proposals had been therein made us,

 but that we had rejected them, and that in fine by a Criminal obstinacy we had broken off the Negotiation. A sound Judgment may be made how things passed by what we are going to re∣late, that you may be disabused of the unfaith∣full Account that has been given of them, and of the false prejudices pretended to be drawn from thence.


We could do no less than to recall our Am∣bassador Extraordinary from the Court of 
France
 after the recalling of the Ambassadors of the most Christian King, and the Declaration of War that follow'd close after it. Our Ambassadour then having signified his Letters of Revocation, being very much indisposed, a great Lord of the Court that was much considered, came to visit him, and told him as a secret he intrusted to him, that the King his Master took all imagi∣nable pains to induce you to a Peace, that Mr. 
Van Beuningen
 your Envoy would be ready to make an overture of some propositions, that might be made for a ground for it. And therefore for that effect he prayed him to defer his Voyage, and to order it so as to meet the said Envoy at the Queen our Mothers Palace to treat there in her presence about the means of attaining to a Peace. Our Ambassador answered him? that having received his Audience of leave, he was devested of his Character, that he had no power to enter into a Negotiation, and that according to his orders he was obliged to depart as soon as ever his health would permit him. A few days after, the same Lord made him a second visit, in which he renewed his instances, and declared to him in his Masters Name, that if he persisted in his Resolution to depart, without hearing what they had to propose to him for promoting of a Peace, he would undoubtedly be charged with all the blood that was going to be spilt, for ha∣ving refused to lend an Ear to those expedients

 that might be capable to prevent so great mis∣chiefs. Upon such pressing Sollicitations, our Ambassador promised to meet them at the Queen our Mothers Palace, declaring however, that he had no power, but that if he did it, it would be out of Complaisance and Curiosity to hear what proposals they had to make. And accordingly he went thither at the appointed hour, as like∣wise did one of the Ministers of the most Chri∣stian King. Their Conversation having been em∣ployed some time in discoursing about the War, and your Envoy obstinately maintaining that we were the Aggressors, he proposed again the same Alternative that you now have newly proposed to us, to which he demanded a positive answer, namely, 
That reparation should be made on both sides for all the damages suffered since the be∣ginning of the War; or else, that each party should remain in possession of what they actually possessed.
 Our Ambassador shewed him the mistake in rea∣soning after such a manner, and how far we were from being the Aggressors; he also Represented to him the impossibility of determining upon the choice of either of those proposals, till it had been first examined, when the War begun! how? and by whom; without which it was impossi∣ble for him to understand the true Sense of that proposition. After that discourse, our Am∣bassador concluded that he had not power to treat, but an express order to be gone immediate∣ly. But that however they might dispatch a∣way an express to inform Us of those proposals, which was in his opinion, the only way to come to a Peace, to which he knew of his own cer∣tain knowledge, I was altogether inclined. That was the end of an enterview, which they would needs have to pass in the world for a Negotiati∣on, and of which all the blame, and ill success has been imputed to Us. And since you repeat the same thing in your Letter, as a considerable

 advance for Peace, we have likewise right to make you the same answer now which our Ambassa∣dor made them at that time, namely, that 'tis impossible for us to explain our selves clearly concerning those two propositions, till you have first explained the terms of them. In that view, we have accepted the Mediation of our dear Bro∣ther, the King of 
Swedeland,
 as we are ready to refer it to any other Prince, who shall not have declared himself a party against us, in hopes that by that means it may clearly appear, what conditions you desire a Peace should be conclu∣ded upon; tho' you are not ignorant we have particularized several things about that Subject, as also several of your own people have done that are well affected to Peace, and to the good of their Country, that are at present prosecu∣ted, because they suffered themselves to be too easily perswaded into a belief, that as to what concerns the abovesaid propositions, you would take a resolution to dispatch some body to Us, to treat about proper means to procure a Peace, and to prevent the inconveniences that have follow∣ed since.


As to the nomination of a Neuter place to treat of Peace with 
France
 and 
Denmark
 which are engaged in the present War, we say, that as we have no differences with the most Christian King, but only so far as he has concerned himself in your quarrel, we doubt not but we may Ac∣commodate our selves together by acknowledg∣ing our true interests, which permits us not to suffer a good Correspondence that has prevailed so long time together between us, and that Crown, should be destroyed by the obstinate refusal to agree to just and reasonable means to come to a Peace. As for the King of 
Denmark,
 who could not meddle in these disputes without vio∣lating the engagements he had equally both with you and Us, we cannot consent with re∣spect

 to that Crown, to the Nominati∣on of a Neuter place. Nay we are con∣strained to declare here that the enterprize made in the Haven of 
Bergen,
 would never have come into our thoughts, if that Prince had not in∣duced Us by his sollicitation to send our Fleet thither by the hopes he made us conceive of sha∣ring together in the spoil of your ships. How∣ever notwithstanding the sensible outrages we have received from him on all occasions that have pre∣sented themselves, we make no scruple to tell you, that as we accept the Mediation of our dear Brother, the King of 
Sweden,
 as well in regard to 
France,
 as to your selves, so when our particular differences shall be composed, we will accept your Mediation to procure a Peace with 
Denmark
 upon reasonable Conditions, and that with design to strengthen the Union that ought to Reign between the Protestant Princes.


That therefore you may have no more mat∣ter to entertain your people withal in the de∣ceitfull opinion, that we refuse to explain to you the conditions upon which we desire a Peace, and tho' that manner of proceeding be quite out of Common use; namely, to outrage and at∣tack in an open War your Allies and Neighbours, and then to demand of them afterwards what are their pretensions, instead of offering them a just Reparation for the damages they have suffered, notwithstanding the inconveniences that may fol∣low therefrom we will not omit to let you know at the same time, what we would not have and what we pretend. We desire not your State should suffer the least change, that the Soveraign∣ty by which you Reign over your people should be in any manner weakened or altered, and much less yet, that you should depend on any Prince neither do we pretend any other Empire over the Sea, but such as our predecessors have at all times incontestably possess'd.




We demand only, that you should inviola∣bly, and in every point observe the last Treaty that was concluded between us, and that the in∣jurious Declaration publisht by your Governours in the 
East-Indies
 and 
Africk,
 be suppress'd and disavow'd, as contrary to the honour of all So∣veraigns and the common right of Nations; and that besides such a Regulation of Commerce may be establisht in the 
West-Indies,
 that our Subjects may be secured from the insults and oppressions to which they have at other times seen themselves exposed.


And tho' we propose not a Reimbursment in money to satisfie the immense charges of the War, yet we demand a moderate Sum in consideration of the damages, and to indemnify us for the los∣ses we and our Subjects have suffered, such a one as shall be judged reasonable; and moreover that security be given, that the said Treaty shall be inviolably observed in all things as the Me∣diators shall find agreeable to Reason and Ju∣stice.


In fine, we expect that in order to the pro∣moting so pious and important a work as is that of the Peace to be made between us, and which is to confirm and preserve that of all Christen∣dom, you shall depute some person to come to us to Regulate the Preliminaries that may con∣tribute to bring the Treaty to perfection. This being done we doubt not but God will protect us, and that he will turn all things to good, which will appear principally by reciprocal Testimonies of tenderness, and on our part by the continuation of the good will we always have had for your State; but if for particular reasons, you reject this expedi∣ent, and that you obstinately persist against your true interests to refuse to accept the Peace that is put into your hands, I leave it to the pub∣lick to Judge, whether of us ought to be char∣ged, if the War continue, with the fatal Ca∣lamities

 and terrible misfortunes that will accom∣pany it, and whether we have not done on our side, all that our honour would permit us, to prevent them. I pray God so to dispose your Hearts as to make serious Reflections upon the true interest of Protestants, and to consider how much it will be exposed to the rage of its Ene∣mies if the War continue. We Recommend you, High and Mighty Lords, to his holy and happy protection, 
&c.




This Letter extremely surprized the States, they thinking it a very hard and sensible thing to the United Provinces, that the 
English
 should pretend to have all restored that had been taken from them, without being willing to restore any thing they had been taken from the 
Dutch.
 The States therefore in order once more to shew all the fair appearances of Justice on their side, and of the pretended sincere desire they had for Peace, caus∣ed remarks to be made upon the King of Great 
Britain
's Letter, tending to justify their Conduct, and to answer separately to the Five points that were there advanced, and sent them to the King joined with the following Letter.




The States Answer to the King of 
England
's Let∣ter of the 14th. of 
October 1666.


SIR,


WE have received your Majesty's Answer da∣ted from 
Whitehall
 the 4th. of 
October
 Old Stile, or on the 14th. of 
October
 last, to the Let∣ter we writ you dated on the 16th. of 
Septem∣ber;
 and tho' at the very beginning of your Let∣ter, your Majesty endeavours to justify your Arms against this State, we believe it to no pur∣pose to enter actually into any dispute about that Subject, because we are perswaded that if your Majesty would take the pains to peruse the wri∣tings

 that have formerly been delivered into the hands of your Ministers, and that have been like∣wise made publick, that you would be undoubted∣ly convinced, as well as all the World, of the Justice of our cause, and of the Motives that engaged us to our own defence.


As to the five points in the Conclusion of your Majesty's said answer, we are in a State to pro∣test by the faith of men of Honour, that we have not violated the last Treaty in any of its parts, and that we will engage for the future, inviola∣bly to observe the Peace, in case it be made, praying your Majesty moreover, to set your self at rest in that respect, and to be pleased to give order, that it be punctually observed on your part.


As to the second point, tho' your Majesty's Mi∣nisters and particularly Agent 
Selwyn,
 published upon the Coasts of 
Africk
 a Declaration without Contradiction, more imperious, and injurious, than that which ours could have invented, and much less have put in execution, as has been made amply to appear elsewhere, yet we have silence thereupon, and we have not been observed to make any noise about it in the World. How∣ever, to shew that we are ready to remove that obstacle we consent that the two abovesaid De∣clarations shall be both disannull'd and disavow'd as well on your Majesty's part, as on ours.


To the third, that we are no less inclin'd than your Majesty, to consent to a Regulation of Commerce, provided it be General and Recipro∣cal, being hardly able to conceive that your Ma∣jesty would refuse in 
Europe
 and elsewhere, what you pretend to be Equitably your due in the East-
Indies.


To the fourth, that tho' we are so far from being in a Condition to consent to a Re-imburs∣ment for the charges of the War, or the da∣mages suffered by your Majesty or your Subjects

 that on the contrary, we have right to pretend the restitutien of the Ships and effects of our good Subjects, stopt in the Harbors or upon the Ri∣vers of your Majesties Kingdom, or that were taken at Sea by surprize, upon the Coasts of 
England;
 as likewise of 
New-Holland, Cabo Corso,
 and o∣ther places taken in 
Africk,
 without publishing before hand any Declaration of War, and in the time when our said Ships entred into your Ma∣jesty's Ports, trusting in the publick faith of a Treaty of Peace, in confidence in the sincere De∣claration which you had caused to be several times reiterated to us by your Ministers that resided then at the 
Hague,
 namely, that we ought not to take any umbrage at your Majesty's Arming, nor in any manner to apprehend the meeting of any of your Majesty's Ships of War, adding that your Majesty should always abhor the Conduct of the usurper 
Cromwel
 towards us, and would never enterprize any thing against the Liberty of the State, and of its Subjects; but that if it should happen that your Majesty could receive no satisfaction upon the Complaints that should be made to us on your part, that as a Generous Prince you would Declare War against the State, before a∣ny Act of Hostility were Committed. However it be, we shall be always ready to stand to the Terms of the said Declaration, if any thing must be expected of us.


As to the fifth, which is that your Majesty would make a Difficulty to trust to our Word or Seal, tho' on our side we were ready to trust to your Majesty's, we shall readily agree to any other proposition to render it the more firm and inviolable by the Guarantie of other Princes or States that are Friends or Allies.


But since your Majesty testifies by your An∣swer above annexed, that you have some grounds to hope to induce us to a particular Treaty, to the exclusion of our Allies, we find our selves

 obliged to advertise you, that that cannot be, and consequently, it is absolutely necessary in Order to come to a good Peace, that your Majesty de∣termine to treat joyntly with us and our Con∣federates, and that you must needs dispose your self to consent that choice be made of a Neu∣ter place where the Plenipotentiaries as well of the Crowns of 
France
 and 
Denmark,
 as those of your Majesty may jointly with ours meet with all Liberty, without which all the pains that can be taken about it, will be to no purpose, because we are resolved to remain inseparably linkt to our Allies, and to hearken to no proposition that may tend to break our Union, directly or indirectly, and that with so much the more confidence be∣cause we are fully perswaded, our Allies will re∣main always unshaken in the same mind. We therefore make ardent prayers to God, to be pleased to incline your Majesty to a thing that is a Preliminary, without which 'tis impossible to come to a Peace; and we hope when affairs shall once be placed upon a good foot, we shall have new reasons to redouble our Zeal, and to put up prayers for the prosperity of your Majesty's reign.




However all hopes of being able to effect a Peace that year vanisht to nothing, and the Uni∣ted Provinces began to labour vigorously in refit∣ing and remanning out their Fleet. And for that end they resolved to keep their Seamen in pay all winter that they might have their full Com∣plements of men ready early in the Spring. For they thought it good Policy to make that last ef∣fort to oblige 
England
 to accept a Peace which they called just, by endeavouring to obtain by the force of Arms, or by subtilty of intrigue, what they could not effect by fair means.




The Ministers of the Crown of 
Sweden
 coming to the Court of 
England
 about the latter end of the Year 1666. used all the Diligence imaginable in qua∣lity of Mediatours, to compose the Differences among the Princes that were in War. The first Step they made in that Affair was, to prevail with the King of 
England,
 to consent to the naming of a Neuter Place, where the Plenipotentiaries of each Party might securely meet in order to treat of a Peace. After much Pains taken in it, they obliged the States to write the following Letter about that Subject to the King of 
England.
 The Respect due to that Prince, obliged the States to make that first Advance, whilst the Ministers of 
Swedeland
 on the other side endeavoured their utmost to perswade his Majesty to grant their Demand.




The States Letter to the King of 
England,
 con∣cerning the Nomination of a Neuter Place.


SIR,


WE exprest to your Majesty in ours of the 26th of 
November,
 the Reasons that hindred us from sending our Ministers to 
London
 to treat there of a Peace joyntly with the other Plenipotentiaries. And we doubt not but your Majesty, upon a serious Reflection thereon, will be of the same Mind with us. But that your Majesty may not think we neglect any thing on our side, that may contribute to any thing that may be capable to advance so important a Work, and to give you the clearest Evidences imaginable of the Sincerity of our Intentions upon this Subject, we were willing to assure your Majesty by these Pre∣sents, That the Instances we have made hitherto, to perswade you to name a Neuter Place, does not at all concern our particular Interests; Nay, and we protest, That if that Affair concerned us in parti∣cular, we would take Pride in passing by all Forma∣lities, by heartily consenting that our Differences might be terminated any where, wheresoever it should please

 your Majesty, not excepting 
England
 it self. But because by virtue of the Alliance in which we are en∣gaged with the Crowns of 
France
 and 
Denmark,
 it is impossible for us to act otherwise, we hope your Ma∣jesty, will think good, that the Negotiation of the Treaty may be begun and perfected elsewhere than in the Dominions of your Majesty. We have therefore thought fit, for the facilitating so Holy a Work, to pray your Majesty by this Letter to consider this Af∣fair as it is really at the Bottom, and at length to be pleased to let the Treaty be carried on in a Neuter-place, where the Plenipotentiaries of each Party may meet. And since we have sufficiently explained our selves thereupon, if your Majesty will but be per∣swaded of the sincerity of our Sentiments, there is all Appearance, we shall soon see the End of a Work that is the Subject of the greatest Hopes of our People, and of the Glory of the Princes interested there∣in. To which we pray God be pleased to in∣cline your Majesty; In confidence of which we shall make Wishes for the Prosperity of your Majesty's Reign, and the Preservation of your Majesty's Sacred Person.




This Letter being put into the Hands of Mr. 
Ap∣pelboom,
 Resident from the King of 
Swedeland,
 at the 
Hague;
 that Minister sent it away presently to 
London,
 to the Ambassadours of that Crown there, who delivered it to the King of 
England;
 who made the following Answer to the States.




The King of 
England
's Answer to the States last Letter.


High and Mighty Lords,


HAving received yours of the 13th of this Month, by the Hands of the Ambassadour Extraordina∣ry of the King of 
Sweden,
 by which you repeat your pressing Instances, to induce us to name a Place where the Plenipotentiaries of the Princes engaged in the

 present War may meet; and since you protest besides that if it were not upon their Consideration, you would make no Scruple to consent that the Congress might be in 
England;
 and on the other Side, the said Am∣bassadours, Mediatours, having confirmed to us the sincerity of the violent Inclination that moves you to seek for a Peace, by praying us most earnestly to be pleased to consent to your Demand as to the only means by which to be able to effect the Conclusion of so Chri∣stian a Work; therefore to give you real Marks of the Passion we have to enter into new Engagements of Peace and Ʋnion with you, for the Good and Repose of all Christendom, and principally of the Reforma∣tion, we not only consent that the Treaty shall be man∣naged in a Place whither the Ministers of your Allies may come with all Security, but further to lay the Foundations of a new and solid Confidence, and in order to prevent the Delaies and Obstacles which will undoubtedly arise by naming any other Place, we have resolved to send our Ambassadours to the 
Hague,
 where the Plenipotentiaries of your Allies either actu∣ally are or may be in a little time, to treat there all together about the so much desired Peace. And if you be speedy in sending us a Passport for the Security of our Ambassadours they shall go to the 
Hague
 before the end of 
February;
 assuring you, That it shall be none of our Fault if 
Christendom
 do not soon enjoy a Peace, as well as our own Subjects: To which we pray God to incline you, and to take you, High and mighty Lords, into his Holy Protection.




The 
Hague
 being thus chosen by the King of 
En∣gland,
 for the Negotiation of a Peace; the States, for particular Reasons approved not that Choice, but writ again about that Subject, to pray him to be pleased to name another Place; representing to him, That since his Majesty upon the Instances made to him to persuade him to consent to a Neuter Place, had had the Goodness to do them the Honour to will that the Peace should be treated on in their Country,

 they assured themselves, That his Majesty would make no Difficulty to send his Ministers to 
Ma∣stricht, Boisleduc, Breda,
 &c. However the other Allied Princes were not content neither with that last Choice; for the 
French
 King refused to accept of the 3 Places the 
Hollanders
 had last named, and would rather have 
Dover
 chosen for the Negotia∣tion. The Ambassadours of 
Swedeland
 perceiving that all those Nicities of 
France
 were not at all sea∣sonable at that time, laboured so hard with that Court, that at last 
Breda
 was accepted, whither all the Plenipotentiaries being come, in the Month of 
May,
 the first Conference began in the Castle the 4th of 
June
 1667.
 Whilst they were busie in Regu∣lating the Preliminaries of the Treaty, a Squadron of Men of War that was sent by the States of 
Zea∣land
 into 
America,
 under the Conduct of Comma∣dore 
Kryusen,
 made strange Depredations there. For on the 26th of 
February,
 they took a Castle, seated on the River of 
Surinam
 in 
Guiana,
 where there was a considerable 
English
 Colony; they con∣tented themselves with obliging them to submit to the Obedience of the 
Hollanders,
 and left them in Possession of their Goods and Estates; besides which, the 
Zealanders
 made several other Con∣quests. In the mean while the 
English,
 whether they were enfeebled by their great Losses by War, Fire and Plague, or whether that Court was blinded by false and treacherous Counsels, which latter was most probable, neglected to arm out their Fleet that Year, and appeared not at all in the 
Channel,
 but in small Squadrons and Convoys. But the 
Dutch
 Fleet to the Number of 60 Sail of Men of War,
 besides those of 
Zealand
 and 
Friesland,
 which had not yet joyn'd them, set sail the 11th of 
June
 under the Command of Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 accompanied with Mr. 
Cornelius de Wit,
 Deputy of the States, and Brother to the Great Pensionary of that Name: They steered their Course towards the River of 
London,
 with a Design not only to go and attack the

 
English
 in their Harbours, but likewise to make a Descent some where to ravage the Country. For that effect they held a Council of War to consult by what means they might run some light Frigats a con∣siderable way up the River, to go and burn the 
En∣glish
 Ships that were there. Lieutenant Admiral 
de Gent
 was chosen for that Expedition, for which they gave him the Command of a Squadron formed out of the Detachments made from the Grand Fleet. It was composed of 6 Men of War, 1 Advice-yacht, and 2 Fireships of the Admiralty of the 
Meuse;
 of 11 Men of War, 4 Advice-Yachts, and 2 Fireships of the Admiralty of 
Amsterdam,
 and 13 Galliots. The next Morning, being the 19th of 
June,
 Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
de Gent,
 and Mr. 
de Wit,
 Deputy of the States, went up the 
Thames
 at the Head of that Detachment, and by an Enterprise they went so much the boldlier upon, because they were well informed, They should meet with little Opposition, revenged the Mischief the 
English
 had done before in the Isles of 
Ʋlie,
 and 
Schelling;
 as appears by the Report the said Mr. 
de Wit
 made of that Action to the States,
 in the Letters he writ them on that subject; the substance of which imported, 
That on the 17th instant the 
Dutch
 Fleet coming to an An∣chor at the Mouth of the 
Thames,
 as they were con∣sulting with the general Officers of the Fleet, what Enterprise to go upon, having received Advice by a Pilot of a 
Norway
 Ship, coming from 
London,
 That 10 or 12 
English
 Frigats, carrying from 30 to 40 Guns apiece, together with about 20 Mer∣chant Ships, outwards bound to the 
Barbadoes,
 were riding at Anchor in the 
Hope,
 near 
Graves∣end,
 it was resolved they should go and attack them, and to endeavour to destroy or take them. And for that effect a Detachment was made from the Fleet, of 17 Light Frigats, 5 Advice-yachts, some Galliots, and some Boats. That on the 19th, about 4 in the Morning, the Wind being turned about to the South-West, they were forced to luff,

 and afterwards constrained by that contrary Wind to cast Anchor: 
 But that the Wind chopping about at length to the South-East, was more fa∣vourable to them; which made them resolve to unmoor, without any further Loss of Time, in Hopes to execute their Enterprise that same Even∣ing: But the Wind slackning, they were forced to stop a Mile and a half short of the 
Hope,
 which gave Time to the 
English
 Ships to escape away. However, to Day, 
continues he,
 about Noon, as the Tide begun to come in, we advanced as far as the Mouth of the River of 
Chattam.
 We pre∣sently gave Order to the Land-Troops and Marine Soldiers to make a Descent, and to attack the Fort of 
Sheerness;
 In the mean while we advanced with our Men of War, and anchored before the same Fort. At our Approach, one of the King's Fri∣gats with some other Vessels,
 and some Fireships that were there, betook themselves to Flight, and the Men in the Fort ran away likewise before our Troops got thither; so that after the Fort had been cannonaded about an Hour and an half, our Sea∣men scaled it to pull down from thence the 
English
 Banner. We found there 15 Pieces of Cannon, which we carried off to our Ships; and a great Magazine of Masts, Yards, and in general of all Necessaries for the Rigging of Ships, valued at near 400000 
Livers.
 We gave Order to all our Captains, to carry each of them on Board them a good quantity, and to set Fire to the rest. Because the most part of our Land-Troops were separated from us by the foul Weather, the Gene∣ral Officers thought not fit to engage themselves too far up the Country with so few People, or else they might have done a great deal of Mischief. We are however of Opinion, to keep the River of 
London
 blocked up, and to hinder the Passage of Ships there as much as 'tis possible for us. And for that effect, Lieutenant Admiral 
de Ruiter
 is to come up and joyn us with the Main Body of the Fleet.




All those happy Successes were further seconded by a much more mischievous Expedition, in which several 
English
 Men of War were burnt in the Ri∣ver of 
Rochester,
 as you may find by the following Letter.




High and Mighty Lords,


SInce my last of the 10th, by which I informed your High and Mightinesses of the taking of 
Sheerness,
 we have received fresh Marks of God's Protection, by several glorious. Advantages we have newly ob∣tained. After we had detached away some Advice-Yachts, and several Boats armed, to go and sound the Passage from hence to 
Chattam,
 we resolved to send up thither to Day Lieutenant Admiral 
de Gent
's Squadron; and accordingly by the Favour of a good North-East Wind, we unmoored from 
Sheerness
 at 
6
 in the Morning. About Noon we arrived near some 
English
 First-Rate Men of War, having on Board them very brave Guns, and being very well manned, who made a Shew at first as if they would make a brisk Defence; but as soon as we had burnt 
4
 or 
5
 of them, some of the others were deserted, so that we took them. I cannot at present give you a particu∣lar Account what Ships perished by the Flames; but I know very well, that the 
Royal Charles,
 carrying 
90
 Brass Guns, and another carrying a like Number, fell into our Hands. There are still 
4
 or 
5
 more a little above us, against which we have sent some of ours, and because there is a very great Consternation among the 
English,
 we doubt not but to take them. According to the Advices we have had of the Enemy, they have sunk 
16
 or 
18
 Ships, the most part Fire-ships, to block up the Passage of the River against us: But in spite of all these Precautions, our Ships are passed up, and we flatter our selves with the Hopes to bring along with us those which we shall have taken. We are in the Resolution to wait here your High and Mightinesses Orders, that we may be able to regulate what we are to do more; thanking God for having

 so powerfully protected our Arms to the Destruction of our Enemies, which makes us conceive new Hopes of Peace, to the Advantage of our Nation, or at least we can boast to have had the Glory to ruine their Forces in such a manner, that if the War continues, they will be no longer in a condition to hurt us, and we shall have no reason to fear them any more: Which we: passionately wish, and at the same time all sort of Prosperity to the State.




On the 23d of 
June
 Mr. 
de Wit
 sent some other Dispatches to the States, to inform them of several remarkable Circumstances, which were not before come to his Knowledge, and added thereto the sequel of so many happy Progresses. He informed them, that the Bed of the River was so narrow, that there could but one Ship pass along it abreast, and that the 
English
 fired so hotly from their Artillery, that none of the 
Hollanders
 durst advance to go near them any more: But that Captain 
Brakel,
 belong∣ing to the College of the Admiralty of 
Roterdam,
 offering himself to that Service, made appear, that nothing is impossible to a great Courage. For tho' he commanded but a sorry Frigat, ill manned and equipp'd, yet he undertook alone to go up and burn the 
English
 Men of War, so that being advanced with all imaginable Resolution, without firing a Gun, he endured all the Enemies greatest Fire. He was scarcely arrived within Musket shot of an 
En∣glish
 Man of War, but that he fired a Broad-side at her, and falling upon her at the same time, by the Favour of the Wind, grappled her and took her, with the Loss only of 3 Men. A 
Dutch
 Fireship grappled likewise another 
English
 Man of War of 52 Guns and burnt her. That Disaster struck such a Consternation into the Enemies, that a part of the 
Royal Charles
's Men fled away, and the rest jumped into the Water. We took with the Help of our Boats, without any Resistance, another 
English
 Ship, called 
Charles the Fi
th
 of 50 Guns, but being

 grappled by one of our Fire-Ships, she blew up in the night. The ship call'd the Fort of 
Hunningen
 being de∣serted by her men that fled away in Boats was taken: she carried 70 Brass Guns; but she was unfortunate∣ly burnt contrary to the Orders we had given. This loss was followed with that of another very considerable 
English
 Ship which we likewise de∣stroyed with the Flames. Yesterday we percei∣ved 3 more above us which we hope to destroy to day; the Water was so low that it was im∣possible for us to get up to them. However the North wind continuing to blow, and the rest of our Fire-Ships that were scattered from the Flag being veer'd back again towards the Admiral, we gave them orders to go up and burn them. And tho' it seemed, that 
Ʋpton Castle
 situated upon the River side, might have opposed that enterprize, because the passage being very narrow in that place, our men must have been forced to have endu∣red its fire, yet in spite of all those obstacles, the business was carried on with so much prudence, that we burnt them to day about 3 in the after∣noon. Those 3 Ships were the most considerable in all the 
English
 Navy, they were named 
the Loyal London, the Royal James,
 and 
the Loy∣al Oak.
 Mr. 
de Wit
 adds in the close, We have obtained, says he, all these Glorious advantages hitherto without the loss of above 150 men. We are at present resolved to go down the River, to join the Main Body of our Fleet. According to the advices we have, all the Kingdom is in A∣larm, and they are there Assembling a great Num∣ber of Troops; But all that is not able to inti∣midate us. However because most of our Fire-Ships have been spent, we pray the States to give Order that we may have more. All our Officers both General and Inferiour have Signaliz'd them∣selves, and given proofs of an unparallelled Bra∣very. Lieutenant Admiral 
Aylva
's Squadron, has joined the Admiral's Flag, so that the Fleet is Re∣inforced

 with a Considerable Number of Ships of War, and we have nothing more to do but to put up prayers for the continuation of the prosperities with which it has pleased God hitherto to bless the Arms of the State.


The Duke of 
York
 and General 
Monk
 were the melancholick Spectatours of the Expedition, and according to the report of some Prisoners, they had been but the day before on Board those 3 Ships that were last burnt. Retiring to 
Roche∣ster
 they were in an unconceivable vexation, to see the Finest and Richest Ships of all their Fleet destroyed so strangely, and they in no Conditi∣on to put a stop to those terrible Ravages of the 
Hollanders.
 There were several other Ships and Fire-Ships likewise lost, which the 
English
 them∣selves sunk in the River of 
Chattam,
 on purpose to stop the 
Hollanders
 passage, and besides them were lost 8 of the most considerable men of War in the whole 
English
 Fleet: Which made both Court and Country exclaim against those pernici∣ous Councellors that had advised the King to be amused so far with the hopes of a Peace, as to venture to treat without Sword in hand, and af∣ter so great a Victory as he had had the last time over the 
Dutch
 to be perswaded under pretence of saving Money, not to put his Fleet out, when it was so necessary for the obtaining an advanta∣geous Peace, and of preserving the Honour and Reputation the Nation had gotten at so dear an expence in two consecutive 
Dutch
 Wars, which now was by one of the greatest oversights ima∣ginable in Policy obscured and tarnisht all at one blast, and never since recovered it self altogether to its former Luster.


Those surprizing and heavy mischiefs much A∣larmed and imbittered the people. So that an insurrection was feared in 
Kent,
 and about 
Ro∣chester.
 Upon which the Duke of 
York,
 and Ge∣neral 
Monk
 apprehending least those glowing Sparks

 might if not timely quencht kindle into an Uni∣versal Conflragation that might endanger the Go∣vernment, thought it best to stifle them in time by sending with speed a good Body of Troops both Horse and Foot, down to the Coasts, as well to awe the Mutinous People as to oppose the 
Hollanders.
 However the whole Storm of the publick discontent fell afterwards upon Chancel∣lor 
Hyde,
 as being the reputed Author of those Counsels that were supposed to have caused all those ill successes, so that he was forced to flie into Exile, to avoid a worse destiny, from which the King his Master could not have protected him without exposing himself to the extreamest dan∣ger. In the mean while the Common Opinion a∣mong the People in 
Holland
 was, that these new attempts instead of disposing the States to a Peace would have kindled fiercer flames of War, and have made the two Nations irreconcilable; But experience quickly shew'd the contrary the Nego∣ation for Peace at 
Breda,
 was thereupon all on a sud∣den further advanced than it had been in many con∣ferences before.


On the 25th. of the Month, it was resolved in a Council of War held on board the Fleet, to detach away Lieutenant Admiral 
de Gent
 with a Squadron of 22 Sail of Men of War and Fire-Ships, towards the North, as well to endeavour to seize upon the Isle of 
Hitland,
 as to cruize for the Ships that were expected from the East-
Indies.
 But as for 
De Ruiter
 with the Rest of the Fleet, they went and Anchoured before the Isle of 
Sheppey,
 where they Land∣ed Four or Five hundred men, who advanced into the Country without Resistance, and brought off to the Fleet, a great quantity of Refreshments of all sorts.




The Count 
de Hoorn
 was afterwards sent with his Regiment on board the Fleet, and 
de Ruiter
 received orders, to remount the 
Thames,
 in order to attempt some further enterprize. For which effect, Lieutenant Admiral 
Bankert
 who was newly come to the Fleet with a Reinforcement of some Ships from 
Zealand,
 was Commanded with a Squa∣dron of 14 of the lightest Ships, and 2 Fire-Ships to advance near 
Gravesend,
 and do all the mischief he could. But that new enterprize had no suc∣cess, but only served to augment the consterna∣tion that was already among the inhabitants of 
London,
 because the 
English
 had sunk so many Ships to stop up the passage of the 
Thames,
 that it was impossible for the 
Dutch
 to make any advance; and besides the Batteries of Great Cannon that were raised all along on both sides the River fired so hotly upon the Ships that ventured within their reach, that 
Bankert
 was forced to retire, and veer back towards the Admiral.


The Fleet then having been Reinforced by the Troops brought by the Count 
de Hoorn,
 the Ge∣nerals thought fit to attack the Fort near 
Har∣wich,
 the principal Circumstances of which Acti∣on are Related in the Letter Mr. 
de Wit
 writ concerning it to the States, of which here follows the extract.


I
 Having represented to all the Officers of the fleet that it was fit the States Troops should be em∣ployed in some remarkable Expedition,
 and several Persons in the Fleet pretending they had particular knowledge of the Fort of 
Harwich,
 the General Of∣ficers thereupon resolved to detach 
1600
 Land-Soldiers and 
400
 Seamen, under the Conduct of Rear Admiral 
Vlug,
 and the Captains 
Swart
 and 
Luz,
 and that being divided into equal Companies at 
12
 in a Company, 
4
 of each Company should be chosen to throw Granado's, and the rest should car∣ry Scaling-Ladders, and Axes to cut down the Pa∣lisado's,

 if they met with any. Things being thus order'd, we caused Vice Admiral 
Evertsz
 to advance with 
14
 men of War, 
1
 Advice Yacht, and two fire-Ships, to attack the fort on one side, which Squadron was divided into two Parts. And Rear Admiral 
Van Nes
 had order to enter the Bay with 
6
 men of War, to approach nearer the fort, whilst Vice-Admiral 
Evertsz
 should vigorously attack it on another side. When the signal was gi∣ven the Troops were transported to shore in Boats and Galliots, with all imaginable speed. Observing, that Vice-Admiral 
Evertsz
 who was to attackt the fort before, kept at too great a distance from the Ramparts, and that Rear-Admiral 
Van Nes
 went not into the Haven, as had been projected, we Re∣solved, 
de Ruiter
 and I, to go up to them, and make them advance. But when we came there, we found it impossible for Vice-Admiral 
Evertsz
 to get any nearer, and upon the Report made to us by the Soldiers we sent to 
Van Nes,
 that there was no going in on that side, the Boom being cut, we re∣solved to send in some Boats to sound the passage, but the Tide going off, and a Calm coming on, it was impossible to execute any thing. 
Evertsz
 approach∣
ng as near the Ramparts as he could possibly, fired at the fort, but the shot he made had but very little effect, because it was almost out of his reach: Whereas the Castle fired vigorously on their side up∣on his men of War. When we saw nothing consi∣derable could be done on that side, 
de Ruiter
 and I took a Boat and went on shore to the Troops there, which we found there drawn up in order of Battle, and waiting till the men of War were got in: And after we had related to them the obstacles we met with, we resolved to make them advance and to attack the fort vigorously by Land, since 'twas im∣possible to do it by Water. The Generals thought fit to leave a body of foot under the Conduct of the Count 
de Hoorn,
 to guard a certain passage, as well to secure our Boats as preven
 the Enemies from fal∣ling

 upon us behind. When all things were ready we marcht our Troops towards the fort, and when we were come very nigh it the Seamen that carri∣ed the Scaling Ladders, had others to advance; in the mean while, the Enemy fired so terribly with their small arms both from the Fort, and from a Galliot that was in the Harbour, that our Officers, after they had examined more nearly the works of the Fort, finding there was no appearance of their being able to take it, resolved to Retire; which was done in good Order. The body of Foot that was posted to guard the passage was vigorous∣ly attackt by the Enemies Horse and Foot, but were received so briskly by them, that after a long and ob∣stinate fight, they were forced to retire with loss.


That attempt having thus failed, 
de Ruiter
 ad∣vanced higher up the River and made the Ships of his fleet bespread the whole breadth of it that they quite blockt up its passage. Rear-Admiral 
Vander Zaan
 was ordered to stay with 
8
 men of War, at the mouth of the Harbour of 
Harwich,
 to observe the Enemies Ships coming or going to and from the Northward, and Vice-Admiral 
Evertsz,
 and 
Star
 were sent towards the 
North-Foreland,
 to hinder the 
English
 from coming in on that side.


In the mean while this strange and indirect pro∣ceeding of the States Forces made a great change in the Negotiation for Peace that was managing at 
Breda.
 For the States Plenipotentiaries stuck not to say, 
That the advantages their Arms had newly obtained, might perhaps make their Masters alter their minds; That however they consented to conclude a Peace upon the conditions that had been presented, but that they could not answer for its Ratification. And that it was not to be imagi∣ned, the States and their Allies should stand to the offers that had been made, if God cont
nued to bless their Arms with new Conquests.
 The 
Dutch
 Aim∣ing by that Declaration, to oblige the 
English
 to

 make choice of one or the other of the proposi∣tions that had been made them, 
viz.
 That each party should either render back Reciprocally what they had taken or else keep on both sides what they had. And the King of 
England
's Plenipo∣tentiaries appeared likewise much more inclinable to Peace than they had done before, and the Differen∣ces as well with the States, as with the Kings of 
France
 and 
Denmark
 were at last terminated on the 10th. of 
July;
 save only that Mr. 
Coventry
 one of His 
Britannick
 Majesty's Plenipotentiaries was obliged to go back with all speed to 
London
 to get some points agreed to, which it was not in their power to decide.


The news of a Conclusion of the Peace was brought to the Fleet the 14th. of the same month, and yet because it was not fully ratified, such was then the insolence of the then 
Lovestenian
 Go∣vernment, for which they afterwards paid dear, that orders were sent for all that, next day to 
de Ruiter,
 to continue still to do all the mischief he could upon the 
English
 Coasts, because the Peace was not yet fully concluded. Upon that advice the Fleet was divided the same day into 2 Squadrons, whereof 1 under the Command of Lieutenant Admiral 
Van Nes,
 was ordered to block up the River of 
Thames,
 and the other un∣der the Command of 
de Ruiter
 in person Quitted the 
Thames
 to go a cruizing along the Channel to infest the several Ports of the Kingdom there.


On the 18th 
de Ruiter
's Squadron passed the Strait of 
Callis,
 and the next day advanced right a∣gainst the 
Singels
 without meeting any Ship. But the 
English Barbado's
 and 
Smirna
 Fleets which they had flattered themselves with the hopes of taking, were got safe into Port before they could reach them. Seeing then they had mist their desi∣red prey, they resolved next to attack 
Torbay,
 where there were 2 Merchant Ships. Which enterprize

 put all the Coasts of 
England
 so much the more in alarm, because 
de Ruiter
 having divided his Squa∣ron into several bodies, made them appear in se∣veral places at one time, which so perplext the 
English
 that they knew not which way to bend their Force to hinder a descent. On the 8th of 
August,
 having received a Reinforcement of 7 men of War, and 8 Fire-Ships, he sailed as far as 
Ply∣mouth,
 upon advice he had received that a good Number of 
English
 men of War were there as∣sembling. The next day towards evening, a Boat came out of 
Plymouth
 carrying a White Flag, which came directly to 
de Ruiter
 to tell him the News of a Peace. There were in it two 
Eng∣lish
 Colonels accompanied with two other Gentle∣men who came on board the Admiral, and told him that Peace was Concluded between 
England,
 and the United Provinces; after which they made him great protestations of Amity, praying him to order all Acts of Hostility to cease. They complained at the same time of the fight that had newly hapned on the 
Thames
 between Lieutenant Admiral 
Van Nes,
 and some of the King's Ships; and how that, contrary to the Peace, many of their Ships had been endamaged, and several Fire-Ships burnt to Ashes, 
&c.
 But 
de Ruiter
 without taking any notice of all those Compliments, thought not fit to discontinue his Enterprize as believing the States would not have failed to have informed him of so great a piece of News, if things had been really so as the 
English
 pretended.


Lieutenant Admiral 
Van Nes
 having received orders from the States, to remount the River of 
London
 and to go and attack the 
English
 men of War and Fire-Ships that were in the 
Hope,
 and to keep the 
English
 in a perpetual alarm, set sail accordingly with his Squadron, on the 2d. of 
Au∣gust
 and found there Admiral 
Spragg
 with 5 Fri∣gats, 17 Fire-Ships, and a great many small Ves∣sels. The principal Circumstances of the fight

 that hapned between them on that occasion, are Related in the following Letter written by Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
Van Meppelen,
 who led the Van∣guard.


UPon the advice we had, that 5 of the King's Frigats whereof the biggest carried 54 Guns, 16 or 18 Fire-Ships, and a good Number of small Vessels were riding a little below 
Graves∣end,
 we resolved to go and attack them. I led the Van, and Captain 
Naalhout
 was Commanded with 8 Fire-Ships, to go and begin the attack. I following him close with five men of War, and was backed by Lieutenant Admiral 
Van Nes.
 At our approach the Enemies hoist∣ed their Sails, and staid in their post till we came near their Fire-Ships that were at Anchor; we prest them so closely, that some of them in a fit of despair, cut their Anchor-Cables and retired towards the King's Frigats who likewise began to flie. Captain 
Naalhout
 fell upon them with so much Courage, that he forced them to veer back towards their Fire-Ships who enclosed them so round, and kept so close to them, that it was Difficult to come near any of them. Then a Calm coming on, the small 
English
 Vessels fi∣red so many shot at our Fire-Ships, that we were forced to quit some of them, after we had set fire to them, and there were two of them set on fire and burnt by the Guns of the 
English.
 But as soon as the Wind began to rise a little they all betook themselves to flight, and we cha∣ced them as far as under the very Fort of 
Gravesend
 which fired fiercely upon us, with its Cannon. We Anchored with our whole Squa∣dron in the same place from which we had chased them, and we lost in that Action 11 Fire-Ships, so that there was but one left us, and the 
English
 lost 7.




On the next day being the 3d. of 
August,
 we perceived the Enemies coming down the Ri∣ver, and making towards us. We therefore quitted our post, and as we were retiring, be∣cause the only Fire-Ship we had left, run a ground and that it was impossible to save it, we set it on fire towards Evening. The 
English
 were al∣ready got very near us with their Fire-Ships; we received them vigorously, and both sides conti∣nued firing at one another, till we cast Anchor, and then the 
English
 quitted us. The next day we advanced so fast, that by the good Conduct of Lieutenant Admiral 
Van Nes,
 we were out of danger of running a ground. However, the 
English
 left not off following us, in Hopes to burn the first of our Ships that should have run aground; But we gave them chace again about the dusk of the Evening.


On the 5th. of 
August
 in the morning, we descried 21 Sail making towards us with a fresh East-North-East Gale, which we easily discover∣ed to be the 
English
 come out of 
Harwich.
 They had 5 Frigats, 14 Fire-Ships, and 2 Galliots. Whereupon Lieutenant Admiral 
Van Nes
 held a Council, and it was resolved we should cast Anchor, and manfully to stand the Enemies shock, in spite of the danger we exposed our selves to of losing some Ships. As soon as they got near enough to us, the first motion they made, was to come and fall upon Captain 
Naalhout
 to en∣deavour to burn him; but he hastily weighing up his Anchor, vigorously Repulsed two Fire-Ships that were coming to grapple him, and e∣scaped as 'twere by Miralce. The Rear-Admiral of 
Zealand
 was very near being burnt, but he escaped the danger by Repulsing the Fire-Ship with his Guns.




The Number of Fire-Ships that were destroyed as well on the 
English
 as the 
Dutch
 side, was ve∣ry near equal. After that Rencounter Lieutenant Admiral 
Van Nes
 returned to his post to keep the River blockt up, as he had done before.


A Peace was at last Concluded the last day of 
July.
 And Admiral 
de Ruiter
 having received ad∣vice that the Ratifications were exchanged on both sides, the 25th. of the same month, and thereup∣on the Peace was accordingly Proclaimed, order∣ed all Acts of Hostility to cease. Such was the end of the Second War the United Provinces had with 
England;
 which was terminated indeed by a Peace, but such a one, alas that was but of small duration, since scarce had those two Powers laid down their Arms, but they were forced to take them up again, as will appear in the sequel of our History.








THE LIFE OF 
Cornelius Tromp,
 Lieutenant Admiral of 
Holland
 and of 
West-Friesland.
 The Fourth BOOK.


HOlland
 and its Allies began now to tast the Fruits of Peace; 
 and in Order to make it the more firm and durable, 
England, Swedeland,
 and the United Provinces entred into a strict Alliance together, at the beginning of the Year 1668. The States fore∣seeing, that 
France
 would not fail to conceive an Umbrage at it, and that Ambitious Crown being Jealous at all the precautions taken by those Po∣wers for their own security, might afterwards per∣haps endeavour to seek its Revenge upon some of them, thought it necessary to secure themselves from that danger, by Uniting themselves more strictly with 
England
 which they did by a Defen∣sive

 Alliance with Sir 
William Temple
 Ambassador from his 
Britannick
 Majesty at the 
Hague.
 The first good effect that Tripple-Alliance produced, was to put a stop to the rapid Course of the u∣surpations of 
France
 in the Low-Countries, by setting bounds to its Ambition.


For the 
French
 King knew so well how to make his advantage of the late War between 
England
 and 
Holland,
 which he had fomented for his own ends, that he took that opportunity, to surprize the weak 
Spaniards
 then under an infant King, and to wrest several important places from them in the Low-Countries, contrary to the Faith of the Treaties on foot between the two Crowns. But the Tri∣ple-Alliance forced him to lay down his Arms, so that on the 2d. of 
May,
 a Peace was Concluded between 
France
 and 
Spain
 at 
Aix la Chappelle.


After that, the 
French
 King being much dis∣gusted at the Conduct of the States, never left off to seek out occasion to shew his fierce Resent∣ment. The first step he thought fit to make to∣wards it, was to endeavour to break the Famous, and by him so much dreaded Tripple-Alliance, by di∣viding the Princes that were engag'd in it. The dis∣gracefull Ravages and Spoils the 
Hollanders
 had so unfairly committed on the 
English
 Coasts, but chief∣ly at 
Chattam,
 at a time of a Treaty of Peace, as likewise some new difficulties about Navigation and Commerce, furnisht him with a hopefull pre∣tence, enough to work withal upon the King of 
England;
 there wanted only a dextrous Person to be chosen that might be fit to perswade his 
Bri∣tannick
 Majesty. And as the 
French
 have always been successfull in employing the Ministery of Females in their most important Negotiations, because they are more insinuating, and flatter generally with a more powerfull and irresistible influence than men; so accordingly the Dutchess of 
Orleans,
 Sister to that Prince, was pitcht upon to pass to the Court of 
England,
 to manage that nice affair. She set out

 then in the month of 
June
 1670,
 accompanied with a great many 
French
 Lords, under pretence of making a visit to the King her Brother. The States were not long before they perceived what blow the 
French
 were designing at them. For they well enough foresaw that the Voyage of the Dutchess was intended only to break the Trip∣ple-League; And they had certain Advice, that the 
French
 King was preparing to march with a po∣werfull Army towards 
Dunkirk
 early in the Spring; besides all that, they made no Difficulty to say publickly at 
Stockholm,
 that if the 
French
 King should attack the United Provinces upon any other pre∣tence than that of the Triple League, that 
Swede∣land
 would not be obliged to assist them.


The 
French
 Court, without declaring themselves openly had already begun to Commit a sort of Hostility, by laying excessive imposts upon all 
Dutch
 Merchandizes imported into that Kingdom. The States having Complained of it several times with no effect, resolved at last to retaliate that u∣sage, by forbidding the importing any Brandy or 
French
 Manufactures into their Dominions, hoping by that means to oblige the most Christian King to alter his proceedings. And because the march of the 
French
 Army towards 
Dunkirk
 put them in some apprehension for the Low-Countries, the States resolved also to have a powerfull Fleet at Sea under the Command of Admiral 
de Ruiter
 both to secure their Commerce, and to observe the motions of the 
French.
 And besides they Solli∣cited 
England
 likewise to put a Fleet to Sea, to joyn with theirs, according to the obliga∣tions of the Tripple-League: But King 
Charles
 gave them already to understand, that he had quite different aims.




On the 8th. of 
June
 1671. 
 
de Ruiter
 sailed out of the 
Mense
 with some men of War, towards 
Ostend,
 near which place, his Fleet was to Rendesvouz. It consisted of 46 men of War, 10 Advice-Yachts, and 6 Fire-Ships. It carried 2379 Guns, 8090 Seamen, and 2768 Soldiers; and was divided into 3 Squadrons, the first under the immediate Com∣mand of 
de Ruiter,
 the second under that of Lieute∣nant Admiral 
Bankert,
 and the third under the Con∣duct of Lieutenant-Admiral 
de Gent.
 Whilst the Fleet was cruizing upon the Coasts of the 
Ne∣therlands,
 it was on the 20th. of 
August
 overta∣ken with a violent Tempest, by which several Ships were endamaged, and that of Admiral 
de Ruiter
 was one of the worst treated. Two days after, he went and Anchored near 
Westkappel,
 to Repair and Refit his shattered Ships; from whence he discovered a Yacht, called the 
Merlin,
 which carried the King of 
England
's Flag on her Main-Mast-Top. She was come out of the 
Meuse
 and going back for 
England,
 and as she passed throw the 
Dutch
 Fleet she saluted 
de Ruiter
 with some Guns, but he being busy in Refiting his Ship, could not make use of his Guns to answer his salute. Lieutenant-Admiral 
de Gent
 perceiving it, rendred the King's Yacht the Honours due to her with a salute of 7 Guns: And in the mean while Admiral 
de Ruiter
 having made hast to get his ready, saluted likewise with 9 Guns; but the 
English
 made him no return. At the same time setting Sail
, he summoned on board him all the General Officers and Captains of the fleet to inform him what damage they had suffered by the late ill Weather. And then it was that Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
de Gent
 told him, that after he had returned his salute to the Kings Yacht, the 
English
 Captain fired twice at him with Bullets, because he refused to strike his Flag; that there∣upon he sent his Captain on Board the Yacht to know of the Commander the reasons that o∣liged

 him to act in that manner, and that hear∣ing that Madam 
Temple
 was on board her, be∣cause he had had the honour to visit her at her lodging at the 
Hague,
 where she had treated him with great civilities, he was minded to go on board the Yacht himself to pay her his Respects; and that as he went in, he told the Captain ve∣ry civilly, That as for an affair of so great an im∣portance as that was, to strike his Flag to one of the King's Yachts, upon their own Coasts, truely with∣out an Express Order, he durst not do it, but that if his 
Britannick
 Majesty had reason to pre∣tend any such thing, the difference ought to be decided between his Majesty and the States; and that after that discourse, they parted good friends, Notwithstanding which, that Rencounter by the 
French
 was made the Subject of so much noise and blustring in 
England,
 that the States found they had reason to apprehend very mischievous Conse∣sequences from it.


The Campaign the most Christian King was to make near 
Dunkirk
 having ended in a bare re∣view of his Army; The States thought the 
Spanish
 low-Countries had nothing to fear that year, and therefore they resolved to call home their Fleet, to prevent the Tempests that begun alrea∣dy to reign. And accordingly Admiral 
de Ruiter
 had orders to retire on the 21st. of 
September
 and the 23d of the same month, the Fleet went into Port, to be Disarmed and laid up.


In the mean while the designs 
France
 had for∣med against the 
Netherlands,
 begun to break out, as likewise the intelligence the King of 
England
 had with that Crown; And the States were in∣formed from good hands, what Springs the 
French
 King had set on work to break the Triple League, and that to induce King 
Charles
 to break out or it, he promised to put into the field an Army of 100000 men, and to set out to Sea a Fleet of 40 Sail of men of War. But however the 
English
 on

 their side to lull asleep the States, gave them good words.


At the beginning of the Year 1672, 
 the busi∣ness about the 
Merlin
 Yacht was revived again. And Sir 
George Downing
 was sent to the 
Hague
 from his 
British
 Majesty, to make Complaint of it, and to demand Reparation; adding, that Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
de Gent
 ought to be punisht. And tho' the 19th. Article of the Treaty at 
Breda, That men of War, or Merchants Ships belonging to the Ʋnited Provinces, when they shall meet any of the King of
 England's 
Ships of War in the
 British 
Seas, shall be obliged to strike their Flag, and lower their main Topsails as was formerly practised
 Yer Sir 
George Downing
 would needs maintain, a∣gainst the Commissioners appointed to treat with him, that the business of the Flag was not to be taken from the Treaty of 
Breda,
 but from an Ancient right; and that the civilities they rend∣red one another, were all times to be Recipro∣cal, 
&c.
 Some days after, he delivered in a wri∣ting wherein it was asserted, 
That the Empire of the Sea belonged to the
 English: 
That not only every single Ship was obliged to strike their Flag, but even whole Fleets: That Lieutenant Admiral
 de Gent 
had failed in his Duty, and ought to be pu∣nished,
 &c. All the Reasons the States could al∣ledge, would not satisfie Sir 
George Downing,
 nor stop his hasty departure.


The States likewise employed all imaginable means to satisfy the 
French
 King, but that Prince had taken so strong a Resolution to make War, that nothing was able to divert him from it. Whereupon the States seeing plainly, that all those Preparati∣ons were making against the United Provinces, and that the 
Netherlands
 were going to be made the Theater of a terrible War, they begun to pro∣vide for themselves, by raising a Fund to defray the vast expences they were like to be engaged in. And

 after deliberations, the Prince of 
Orange
 was Cre∣ated Captain General of the Armies of the State the 24th of 
February,
 upon certain conditions not necessary to be inserted here. The States having enjoyed Peace by Land near 24 years, their Land-Forces were so accustomed to Idleness, that they were not like the same men; and too long a rest had effeminated the Spirits of the Soldiers, that there was no Reliance to be made upon their Service. Therefore Orders were given for new Levies and endeavours were used to make Alliances with the Neighbouring Princes for 
Auxiliary
 Troops. They used all diligence to fit out a Fleet of 48 Capital men of War, and 24 Fire-Ships, besides Galliots and other small Tenders; which Num∣ber was afterwards considerably Augmented.


In the mean while, the 
English
 put out a Fleet of 38 men of War, divided into three Squadrons; and the States Agent named 
de Clarges,
 having dis∣covered, that their design was to go and meet, and attack the 
Dutch Smirna
 Fleet, one of the richest they ever had yet, used his best Policy to disappoint the 
English;
 and for that effect dis∣patch'd away several Galliots from 
Callis,
 to go and give the 
Smirna
 men notice of it in the 
Spanish
 Seas; so that upon that Advice, they took their Precautions for their own defence. They were to the Number of 72 sail, including among them 6 men of War, that were their Convoy. When they were come as far as the middle of the Channel a Squadron of 9 
English
 Frigats,
 and 3 Yachts under the Command of Sir 
Robert Holms,
 came & attackt them.


On the 24th. of 
March.
 At the sight of the 
English,
 the Merchant Fleet threw themselves in∣to the form of a 
Crescent,
 and maintained the fight so vigorously for some hours, that Sir 
Robert Holms
 was forced to retire from them toward night but the next day having received a Reinforcement of 4 or 5 men of War more, he came up with them again, and charged them a fresh, but with no

 better luck then at the first time, and the whole 
Smirna
 Fleet had escaped, had not the 
English,
 upon the renewing the fight a third time, hap∣ned to take one of the Convoy Ships whose Cap∣tain was killed, which was the cause of the loss 4 Merchant Ships which were cut off from a Squadron that were put into some Disorder, such was the end of that fight; And that was all the advantage the 
English
 gained over them. But the main body of that Merchant Fleet, got in at length safe into the Ports of 
Holland.
 The Captains, 
de Nes
 and 
de Haas,
 who commanded there in chief, lost their lives there, and Captain 
du Bois
 had his Left hand shot off


The 
French
 King Declared War against the U∣nited Provinces the same day. The pretence of which Declaration was, 
That the displeasure his Majesty had received from the Conduct of the States General of the Ʋnited Provinces for some time past towards him, was come to such a height, that his Majesty could no longer dissemble his Re∣sentment, without prejudice to his Glory, and that a proceeding so very unsuitable to the great obliga∣tions the States had to his Majesty, and to other Kings his predecessors, had at last provoked him to take a Resolution to make War against them by Sea and Land,
 &c.


The motives that induced the Bishop of 
Munster
 and Elector of 
Cologne
 to joyn with 
France
 like∣wise in a War against the States, were not much better founded then those of the 
French
 King. The King of 
Swedeland
 being then but very young, had not experience enough to avoid suffer∣ing himself to be imposed upon by the promises of 
France,
 quitted likewise the Engagements he had with his Allies, in prejudice to the Tripple-League.


The United Provinces then seeing themselves thus without any second, and all alone engaged in a danger of a very fo
midable aspect, fell into Great extreamities. For the 
French
 King en∣tring

 their Country with a very Numerous and well disciplined Army, took Town after Town without Resistance; whilst the Bishop of 
Mun∣ster,
 and Elector of 
Cologne,
 attackt the States on another side, and finding the places open, were no less Victorious than their Great Allie. In fine, such was the rapidity of their progresses, that of seven Provinces, three were already fallen into the hands of the Enemies; And if the affairs of the United Provinces had succeeded so despe∣rately ill at Sea, as they had done at Land, it may be said, that in all humane appearance, they had been ir∣retrievably lost. For after such great losses, what could they expect but a Total Ruine? but be∣cause those Events do but indirectly concern our Subject, and that they have been already very largely and fully related by several Historians, we shall leave them to return to speak only of the Actions that hapned at Sea.


They had wrought with so much diligence in arming out the Fleet in 
Holland,
 that it was rea∣dy on the 9th. of 
May,
 to set sail. And the vigilence and care of Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 and Pensionary 
de Wit,
 contributed very much to that successfull advance. It set sail then under the Conduct of Admiral 
de Ruiter
 and 
Cornelius de Wit.
 Depu∣ty of the States, consisting of 67 sail, which Num∣ber was soon was soon after Augmented, by a Reinforcement of several Ships more. On the 14th. day of the same month, the two Fleets of 
England
 and 
France
 joined likewise near the Isle of 
Wight;
 And the same day the 
Dutch
 Fleet sailed towards the Coasts of Great 
Britain,
 where they Anchored till the 7th. of 
June
 being Com∣posed then of 91 men of War, 44 Fire-Ships, and 23 Advice-Yachts, making in all, 158 sail. Then weighing Anchor they arrived at break of day at 
Solbay.
 The Confederate Fleets that were above 100 sail strong of men of War, had as the 
Dutch
 Relations Represent things, several times

 already avoided Battle. But the 
Hollanders
 having dis∣covered themselves, presented them so unexpectedly and suddenly before the bay, that several of the Enemies Ships were forced to cut their Anchor-Cables to get out to range themselves timely in a Line of Battle.
 The two Royal Fleets were like∣wise divided into three Squadrons. The Duke of 
York,
 as Lord High Admiral of the Kingdom, had the Command of the main Battle, or of the Red Squadron; The Count 
d' Etrees
 Vice-Ad∣miral of 
France
 Commanded the Right Wing, or the White Squadron; and Admiral 
Mountague
 Earl of 
Sandwich,
 had the Conduct of the Left Wing, or Blue Squadron. Admiral 
de Ruiter
 dis∣posed himself to attack the Red Squadron; Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
Bankert
 the White, and Lieute∣nant Admiral 
de Gent
 the Blue one. 
De Ruiter
 advanced his Squadron, and came up and posted himself within Pistol shot Right against the Duke of 
York,
 and fired a broadside at him, which he returned again with the like. The two Admi∣rals continued thundring at one another, with continual discharges for about 2 hours, till they were both much shattered. But at last, the Duke of 
York
's Flag, with the main Top-Mast to which it was fastned, being shot down, he was forced to remove, and put up his Flag in another Ship, called the 
London.
 Lieutenant Admiral 
Van Nes,
 seconded by some other Ships, made right up to the Vice-Admiral of the Red; both of them kept with their head to the North in charging: But a Calm coming on, they could make no more mo∣tion with any advantage to themselves. Howe∣ver they continued firing at one another all the while without intermission. The 
Royal Catharine
 an 80 Gun Ship, Commanded by Captain 
Chich∣ly,
 falling near 
Van Nes
's Ship, he gave order to his men to seize and take her, 
ut a little time after 
Van Nes
 had quitted her to return to the fight, the 
Dutch
 that were put on board to keep

 her, begun to pillage, so that the 
English
 that were left in her, knew so well to make their ad∣vantage of that opportunity, that they retook her again, and carried her back into 
England.
 Captain 
Brakel
 did that day, without having receiv'd any or∣der for it, one of the Boldest and most Heroick Actions in the World. For at the very begin∣ning of the battle, whilst the Wind continued to blow still a soft Gale, coming out of 
de Ruiter
's Squadron, followed by a Fire ship, he tackt to the Northward, and fell upon the Earl of 
Sand∣wich,
 Admiral of the Blue Squadron: He made up to him without firing so much as one Gun, endu∣ring all the furious discharges of his Enemy, and of several other 
English
 Ships that were about him. And when he was got very near the 
Royal James
 he fired a whole broadside at her so effectually, that a moment after there was nothing to be heard from her but the lamentable cries of a great Number of poor wounded wretches not to speak of those that were killed with shot or splinters. But that which sets of the Glory of that Action with so much the more Lustre, is, that 
Brakel
's Ship, cal∣led the 
Grand Holland,
 carried not above 300 men, and 62 Guns, whereas the 
Royal James
 car∣ried above 104, and 1000 men so that this compa∣red to the other appeared but like a small Boat. Yet 
Brakel
 attackt her so vigorously, and fired so furiously for half an hour into the very heart of the Enemies Ship, that according to wheat Ad∣miral 
Mountague
 himself said, he would have yiel∣ded to 
Brakel,
 if he had born a Flag. Lieutenant Admiral 
de Gent
's Squadron had begun likewise to engage, and some of his Ships advanced like∣wise and fell upon Admiral 
Mountague;
 he ha∣ving already repulsed and sunk 3 Fire-Ships, found himself so overwhelmed by the 
Hollanders
 that he could not hold out any longer. To Disengage himself he caused 
Brakel
's Ship that h
ld him so fast Grapled, to be chopt off with Axes; and which

 had been before so ill treated, that she was n longer able to keep the Sea. Most of his Offi¦cers were killed, and he had scarce 100 sound men left, able to do Service. But to return to 
Moun∣tague
's Ship, a fourth Fire-ship falling upon him, Grapled him so fast, that his Ship was soon burnt to Ashes. The Seamen jumpt Pell-Mell into the Sea. And 
Mountague
 himself with two of his Sons being entred into a Boat in hopes to save them∣selves, she was in a trice filled so full of men, and overcharged, that she sunk; so that Admiral 
Mountague
 or the Earl of 
Sandwich,
 that had been so Famous, unfortunately perisht there with two of his Sons. His body was taken up among o∣ther Dead men, and carried to 
London,
 where it was interred with great Honour and Magnifi∣cence.


On the 
Hollanders
 side, Lieutenant Admiral 
de Gent,
 was not much more Fortunate than Admiral 
Mountague:
 For being extreamly Irritated against the 
English
 ever since the business of the 
Merlin
 Yacht, be∣cause they would needs have had him punisht by the States, he advanced and fell into the Blue Squadron with so much Fury and Undaunted Resolution, that he caused much Terrour and Disorder among them: but he had hardly fought half an hour, when he was taken off by a Cannon-Bullet. His Death was resented as a great loss to the United Provinces as well for the great Services he had rendred, as for those he might still have rendred them. Cap∣tain 
Panhuisen
 that Commanded under him on board his Ship, took his time to inform 
de Ruiter
 and 
de Wit,
 without any noise of his Death. He was ordered to make no words of it, and in the mean while, to act with his Ship what was most requisite for the Service of the State: But as he was worthily acquitting himself of his Employ he had the misfortune to have one of his Legs shot off.




Lieutenant Admiral 
Bankert
 of 
Zealand
 attackt so vigorously the White Squadron, Composed most of the 
French
 Nation, that the Count 
de Estrees
 who Commanded it, having, as 'tis thought, secret orders not to fight, tackt away to the South-ward, which motion separated the 
French
 from the 
English,
 whom they had a mind to leave in the Lurch; which separation 
Bankert
 taking advan∣tage of, pursued them close, firing continually at them, but the 
French
 would not be perswaded to make any stand to face them, but continued to retreat till the night came on, and then they begun downright to flie, and to make all the sail they could towards the Channel.


There were performed many brave actions on that memorable day as well by the 
English
 as the 
Dutch.
 A great 
English
 Ship of 70 Guns was burnt by a Fire-Ship, two more of the first Ra∣tes were sunk, and there were two more destroy∣ed. The 
English
 on their side, so cruely batter∣ed the Ship called the 
Jesus,
 Commanded by Cap∣tain 
Dyke
 that they sunk her. The Ship 
Stave∣ren,
 Commanded by Captain 
Elsevier,
 was after a vigorous resistance, taken and 9 or 10 Fire-Ships were spent to no effect. The night separated the Combatants, and the 
English
 besides Admiral 
Moun∣tague.
 are said to have lost 18 Captains, all men of Note, and above two thousand Seamen and Soldiers.


Mr 
Cornelius de Wit,
 who represented upon the Fleet, the Soveraignty of the States, gave in this occasion likewise Signal proofs of his Zeal, by the undaunted Resolution with which he exposed him∣self to all sorts of dangers, as appears by the fol∣lowing Extract of the Letter he writ on that Sub∣ject.


THe fight continued all day with a great deal of obstinacy and heat, insomuch that 
Mr. de Rui∣ter
 said he never was in so hot an Action in his Life.

 I cannot specify what Number of men, we had kil∣led on board our Ships, because they were instantly thrown over board as fast as they fell, but this I can tell, that of 
12
 Soldiers and a Sergeant, drawn out of 
Mr. Ritenburg
's Company to be my Halbardiers, and which were some of them about me, and the rest over the Masters Cabbin, there remain 
9
 A∣live, whereof one has both his Legs shot off, and two more are mortally wounded. I kept my self all the time before the Masters Cabbin, and when I was weary with standing, I sat down in a Chair, that I might be able attentively to observe all that passed, 
&c.
 
The next day the
 Hollanders 
would have renewed the fight, but the two Royal Fleets being again rejoined, kept to the Wind-ward of them without seeming to dare to approach them, which the
 Hollanders 
pretended to be an un∣doubted mark, that they had had the disadvanta∣ge the day before, since 'tis to be presumed said they, if it had been otherwise, they would have endeavoured to have made use of the ad∣vantage of the wind which was on their side, to have charged them again. But the
 English 
all
d∣ged, that there arose so great a Fog, that they could not do it.


The body of Lieutenant Admiral 
de Gent,
 who was killed in that Battle, was transported in a Galliot into 
Holland,
 and embalmed at the 
Hague,
 and thence was carried to 
Ʋtrecht,
 where it was enterr'd in the 
Dom
 Church, and a Stately monu∣ment was afterwards erected to his Memory, at the States charge.


The 
Dutch
 out of a very necessary policy in the then distressed condition of their affairs at Land, publisht, that they had obtained a signal Victory in that Battle over the Royal Fleets; which News being spread abroad on the 7th. of 
June
 at the 
Hague,
 contributed not a little to raise and re∣vive the drooping hopes and dying Courage of the People, who were extreamly dismayed at the

 rapid Progresses and terrible depredations of the E∣nemies Land-Armies on their Frontiers. For at the very beginning of 
June,
 no less than 3 Armies, 
viz.
 that of 
France,
 of the Elector of 
Cologne,
 and of the Bishop of 
Munster,
 entred their Country, and attackt them on every side at the same time. And 
Orsoy, Bunick, Wesel,
 and 
Rynburg,
 were all taken in four days without any Resistance. The 
French
 King adding Conquest to Conquest entred eve∣ry day further and further into the Country, and pusht on his ambitious designs with so much the greater Rapidity, because all gave way before him by an unparallelled fatality. And it may be said, that if the Confederate Fleets had been as suc∣cessfull, as their Land-Armies, the States had been lost without retrieve, and the United Pro∣vinces would have been forced to submit to the Yoke of those Foreign Powers that then attackt them with so much fury; but by reason that the 
French
 Fleet fought not at all, and that the 
English
 trusting on their assistance did not employ their full Naval strength, and that Admiral 
de Ruiter
 by his vigilance, had surprized them at a disadvantage, when they little dreamt of him, in that he hindred them thereby from gaining a Victory over him, that success was to him and the 
Dutch
 at that ticklish Juncture of Time, as advantageous as an Actual and Compleat Victo∣ry at any other season, by keeping up the hearts of the dispirited people, securing their Navigati∣on, and preserving their Coasts from the like In∣vasions and direfull desolation with which their Land-Frontiers were afflicted.


However the United Provinces were reduced into so lamentable a condition, that the States at length took a Resolution to send two Deputies at the same time, 
viz.
 one to the 
French
 King, and another to the King of great 
Britain,
 to en∣deavour to move those two Princes to come to some Accomodation with them. On the

 19th of 
June,
 two Deputies past through the Fleet, and made all the speed they could toward the Court of 
England,
 whilst others were dis∣patched away to go and address themselves to the 
French
 King, at the head of his Army; but alas! all those steps were made but in vain; For the two Kings, puffed up with so many past successes, and with the hopes of a Total Conquest, made such exorbitant demands, that there was no complying with them; so that the Deputies were fain to come back without doing any thing.


In the mean while the 
Mob
 beginning to rise, accused those who had the management of the Government, and principally the two 
de Wits,
 of being the Authors of all those disasters and charged them with Treason, and holding dangerous Correspondence with the Enemies of the State.
 Nay they further openly affirmed, that there was no possibility of Governing the State any longer, unless the party of the 
Louvesteins
 were pull'd down, and the perpetual Edict made in 1667 to the prejudice of the Illustrious house of 
Orange
 were annull'd and the dignity of the Stat∣holder restored to the present Prince, 
&c.
 So that in fine they prevailed so, that on the 3d. of 
July,
 that Prince was created Statholder,
 and Captain and Admiral General of the Armies both by Sea and Land of the United Provinces, which news caused an unspeakable joy among all the Of∣ficers, Seamen and Soldiers of the Fleet.


A few days after the Royal Confederate Fleets appeared before the 
Dutch
 Coast with design to make a descent near the 
Hague, Harlem,
 or the 
Texel:
 But that enterprize was diverted by a kind of Miracle. For on the very day singled out for that design, as the Enemy was expecting the coming in of the tide, to send in their Boats and small Ves∣sels Laden with Soldiers in order to Land them, it hapned to delay its advance 12 full hours later than Ordinary, contrary to its natural Order, to

 the great surprize and astonishment of all that were versed in Sea affairs, and that ever frequented that Element. That prodigy was lookt upon as one of the most sensible marks of the Protection of God that begun to declare it self for the States. That Retardation of the Tide was likewise fol∣lowed by a horrible Tempest, that forced the E∣nemies Fleets with terror to quit the 
Holland
 Coasts, and to retire homewards with great loss. For three of their men of War, and some o∣ther Victualling Ships were cast away or swallowed up by the Waves.


During these Transactions, 
de Ruiter
 kept with the 
Dutch
 fleet near the 
Holland
 Coasts to have an eye up∣on the Motions of the Enemies. On the 5th of 
Au∣gust,
 news came, that 14 East-
India
 Ships valued at near 14 Millions of Livers were happily arri∣ved at the mouth of the 
Eems
 before 
Delfzil.
 The Enemies had flattered themselves with the hopes of taking them, and thought it was impossible for them to miss of so rich a prize; which obliged them to post themselves near the 
Dogger-Sand
 to be the readier at hand to seize upon them. For they could not imagine, the Government could have time to advise them of the Rupture, because they were put to Sea at the time of the be∣ginning of the War, and that if they had re∣ceived any information of it, that could not have been till it was too late for them to take any precautionary measures to secure themselves. But yet by an instinct as 'twere of Providence, they stole from the vigilance of the Royal Fleets, and the 
Holland
 Fleet sailed towards the 
Eems
 to Con∣duct them into the Respective Harbours of their own Country, where they arrived on the 22d of the same month.


The States Fleet would have kept at Sea some∣thing longer, but because the summer season was almost past, and that Tempests would soon begin to raign, and that besides there was no more dan∣ger

 for that year of any descent by the Royal Fleets, or of any other important attempt, they retired home and entred into Port, on the 22d. of 
September,
 to be disarmed and laid up.


From that time forward things begun a little to change face, and 
Holland
 was secured by cut∣ting the ditches and sluces and overflowing all the Avenues to their Towns; and Provision was made likewise for the preservation of the pas∣sages of 
Gorkum, Schonhoven,
 and 
Minden;
 For 
Naerden,
 was then in the Power of the 
French.
 The march of the Auxiliary Troops sent by the Emperour and the Elector of 
Brandenburg
 to the assistance of the United Provinces contributed al∣so very much to stop the Conquests of 
France
 by the diversion they gave. For the most Chri∣stian King was forced to make great detachments to form an Army under the Command of the fa∣mous Marshal 
Turenne,
 to send to oppose them. The Prince of 
Orange
 on another side, advanced towards 
Charleroy
 with design to besiege it, but the great Frosts and Ill Weather that hapned all on a sudden, broke his measures, so that after he had taken and plundered 
Binch,
 that Prince reti∣red. However the Frosts that thus had crossed the designs of the Prince of 
Orange,
 favoured those of the 
French.
 For the Duke of 
Luxem∣burg
 having formed an Army out of detachments drawn out of 
Ʋtrecht
 and other Conquered places, prepared to make an invasion into the heart of 
Holland,
 by passing his Troops over the Ice. The Count of 
Koningsmark,
 who had the guard of the passes, not finding himself strong enough to Re∣sist him, deserted 
Bodgrave,
 and retired to 
Ley∣den. Luxemburg
 seeing the Weather was like to change to a Thaw, made his Troops advance with Extraordinary dispatch, and past the 
Rhine
 with very little resistance by reason of the consterna∣tion and disorder among them that guarded the 
assages, and marcht to 
Swammerdam,
 with a Re∣solution

 to go further if the Frost continued to fa∣vour his designs.


The Retrenchments made near 
Nieuwerburg,
 were unfortunately deserted in a most unseasona∣ble nick of time; which extreamly favoured the retreat of the 
French:
 For a Thaw hapning to follow, if that post had been preserved, the Duke of 
Luxemburg
's return had been cut off; who however, was constrained to retire with more haste than ever he made in.


'Tis not to be Exprest in what strange alarm and consternation all 
Holland
 then was.
 Howe∣ver, the States, without losing Courage for that, neglected not to give the necessary orders every where, causing the sluces to be opened, to let in the water round about all the places that were most exposed. The Duke of 
Luxemburg
 being come near 
Gondsche Sluis,
 where Count 
Konings∣mark
 was posted with his Troops, found there so much resistance, that he was forced to turn back again, carrying desolation every where along with him, and miserably Ravaging all the places through which he passed. It would be a difficult task to describe all the excessive cruelties he committed there; it is enough to say, that he carried them to such a height, that no future Ages will ever lose the Memory of his Barbarities. The Villages of 
Swammerdam
 and 
Bodgrave
 were burnt to Ashes.


At the same time, which was the last day of the Year, the Troops of 
Groningen
 returned him his change. For the Frost that had put by the Seige of 
Charleroy
 having lockt up the Marish waters round about the strong place of 
Koeverden,
 they took advantage of that opportunity and seized that important Fortress.


These were the principal Events of the Year 1672. and this was the deplorable condition into which the United Provinces were then reduced. But God being pleased afterwards to espouse their

 Interests delivered them from the unsupportable Yoke of Foreign powers, by such surprizing means, that they recovered all their places again in less time than they had lost them, as will appear in the sequel of this History.


At the beginning of the Year 1673. 
 A dete∣stable plot was discovered at 
Amsterdam,
 to burn the States men of War. The Author of it was one 
Fraser
 a 
Scotch-man,
 who as he confest him∣self, was incited to that bold and pernicious at∣tempt by great promises of reward from the Duke of 
York,
 who was ever an irreconcilable Enemy to the United Provinces. That unhappy Cri∣minal was therefore broke alive upon the Wheel, and exposed afterwards near 
Voolewyijk.


In order to put themselves into a condition to make the same vigorous resistance against the two Fleets of 
England
 and 
France
 which they did the last year, the States began with incredible dili∣gence to forward the preparations making to Arm out a powerfull Fleet. And for that effect, all the Deputies of the Colleges of Admiralty and the Commissioners of the Navy, had several Con∣ferences with the Prince of 
Orange,
 in which it was concluded, that the Fleet should be considera∣bly Augmented and Rendred more potent than it ever yet had been.
 In the mean while, the Of∣fice of Lieutenant Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of 
Amsterdam,
 being vacant by the death of Mr. 
de Gent
 who succeeded 
Cornelius Tromp
 when he was dismist from his Employment, His Highness, in Quality of Stat-holder, and Ad∣miral General, having a perfect knowledge of 
Tromp
's rare merit, and incomparable valour and Conduct, as well as of the singular Zeal and Af∣fection he had always shewn to the Illustrious House of 
Orange,
 represented to him of what im∣portance it was both to himself and the State in that pressing Juncture, to forget past things, and prest him to accept again of the Office of Lieu∣tenant

 Admiral of the College of 
Amsterdam,
 in order to recontinue his Services to his Country, in a time of such distress.


The Prince stirr'd so warmly in that Affair that he found means to reconcile him to 
de Rui∣ter,
 and thereby to prevent the disorder the in∣veterate hatred of those two Admirals might cause in the Fleet. Accordingly they embraced one a∣nother in the presence of His Highness, and mu∣tually promised to forget all that was pass'd, and to live thenceforward as brothers.


The Re-establishment of 
Tromp
 in his former Post at Sea caused an unexpressible joy to all the Seamen in the Fleet, and in General, to all the common people: Who seemed confident after the Reconciliation of those two great Men, that the United Provinces would be able to Triumph o∣ver the Naval Forces both of 
England
 and 
France,
 so much weight they imagined to be in the Con∣duct of that one man to turn the Scale of Victory on their side.


At that time, the States projected an attempt of very great importance, which was to dam up the mouth of the 
Thames,
 by sinking in it great many Ships extraordinarily loaden, and so to ren∣der it unpassable. And for that end they had prepared at 
Amsterdam
 8 ships fitted for that ex∣pedition, nay they were already sent to the 
Tex∣el,
 as thinking the success of that enterprize de∣pended solely on the speed used in it. In the mean while they laboured and wrought night and day to man out their Fleet that they might have their full Complement early in the spring. And if that project had succeeded, no doubt but 
England
 would have felt a long time its effect by the in∣terruption of its Commerce which would there∣by have been totally ruined, and that without any Battle, or Effusion of Blood.




On the 10th of 
May,
 the Fleet assembled at 
Schoonevelde,
 and were 80 sail strong, who the next day, without staying for the 
Zealand
 Squa∣dron, or the other ships that were not yet come to them, sailed out, and made towards the 
Thames.
 But a great Fog coming on, and the 
English
 ha∣ving had intelligence of their design, it was im∣possible for them to execute any thing, so that they were fain to tack about, and return back again to an Anchor at 
Schoonevelde,
 the ships that were wanting arrived daily to the Fleet, and in the mean while they employed themselves in Re∣gulating the division of the Squadrons, and the orders they were to observe. The whole Fleet was divided into three Spuadrons. Admiral 
de Ruiter
's was composed of 19 men of War in the line of Battle, 4 Frigats, 8 Fire-ships, 4 Ad∣vice Yachts, and 3 Galliots. The General Officers under him, were Lieutenant Admiral 
Van Nes,
 Vice-Admiral 
de Liefde,
 and Rear-Admiral 
Van Nes.
 Lieutenant Admiral 
Bankert
 s Squadron consisted of 18 men of War, 5 Frigats, 8 Fire-ships, 5 Ad∣vice-Yachts, and 2 Galliots; he had under him, Vice-Admiral 
Evertsz,
 Vice-Admiral 
Saar,
 and Rear-Admiral 
Ʋlug.
 Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
's Squadron consisted of 18 men of War, 5 Frigats, 9 Fire-ships, 5 Advice-Yachts, and 2 Galliots; ha∣ving under him, Vice-Admiral 
Sweers,
 Vice-Admi∣ral 
Schram,
 and Rear-Admiral 
de Haan.


After that division, it was ordered, that Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
Van Nes
 should command in chief Admiral 
Tromp
's Squadron during his absence, and that Vice-Admiral 
Evertsz
 should likewise Com∣mand that of Lieutenant Admiral 
Bankert
 till he should come to the Fleet himself.


The affairs of the Government, and the prepa∣rations that were to be made by Land so entirely took up the Princ
s care and time, that it was impossible for him to come down to take a re∣view of the Fleet. And therefore he was pleas∣ed

 to write the following Letter to 
de Ruiter
 to encourage the Captains▪ and Seamen, and to incite them all in General, and every one in particular to acquit themselves worthily of their duty in their respective stations.




Noble, Equitable, Valiant, Well-Beloved, Incom∣parable,


WE could have wisht,
 the affairs of the State would have permitted us to go in person to the Fleet to have the satisfaction to see in it so many of our Brave Countrymen that all Zealously La∣bour in defence of their Country. That considera∣ble fleet now equipping is one of the most powerfull means that can be employed for the preservation of the State; and there is reason to hope, that considera∣tion will inflame the Courage of those who have the honour to be chosen to have the Conduct of it. The Eyes and Hearts of all the Subjects of the Ʋnited Provinces, nay, and of all Christendom are now turned that way, and are attentively observing what motions, and what attempts it will make under the Valour and Conduct of those who Govern it. And what infamy will it not be then for them that shall be so cowardly as to fail in their duty in so important and glorious an occasion? But we expect no such ungratefull News, but rather on the contrary, that by your Prudence and Ʋndaunted Resolution, as well as by that of those about you, the Glory our Nation has lately gotten by Sea will be maintained with the Protection of God, by the fresh Zeal and Courage which you shall exert. This being so, they will have reason to rejoice, and we likewise with them, that they have been the Instruments to bring things to a happy end in so just a cause. We shall take care to recompense the Merit and Bravery of those that shall have given any signal proofs of it, and shall provide, that Great and Glorious Acti∣ons shall not be repaid with ingratitude, but rather with a proportionable Reward. I pray you to assure

 all those under your Flag, from the greatest to the least, of this, and at the same time, to let every one of them understand, that no Pardon is to be ex∣pected by them who shall not do their duty, and shall be guilty of Cowardice. That is both the true intention of the States, and Mine too, that those which shall deserve it, shall be punctually and speedi∣ly punisht according to the utmost rigor of the Or∣ders of the Commission, and of the Laws of the Country; so that the Cowards and all those who shall not behave themselves like brave Soldiers be∣fore the Enemy shall have nothing to fear more, than to enter the Harbours of the State; because it will be impossible for them to escape the rigour of Ju∣ctice, and the indignation of the people which will pursue them every where. We perswade our selves that none of them will fall into any such misfor∣tune, but that rather every one will strive to sig∣nalize himself with a commendable ardour in so pressing an occasion, in confidence, that God will make all succeed to the Good of our Country, and the immortal honour of all those that shall have faithfully served it. I pray God to take you into his holy protection, and all those that are with you 
&c.




To which Letter 
de Ruiter
 made the following An∣swer.




Most Serene Prince,


AFter I had sent away about noon, my last writing to your Highness, I receiv∣ed towards evening, yours, wherein your High∣ness is pleased to exhort us to do our duty for our dear Country. I am infinitely obliged for it to your Highness, and will not forget to mor∣row without fail, to inform the General and Inferiour Officers of the same, that we may all of us together behave our selves in such a man∣ner, that we may be able to answer for our Con∣duct

 before God, before your Highness, and before all Christendom. Your Highness may en∣tirely rely upon it, as I do in your Highnes∣ses word, 
That Lieutenant Admiral
 Tromp 
shall agree and live with me and the other Members of the Council of War, in the same confidence and union, as we live at present with the rest.
 For then I dare flatter my self with the hopes, that all our enterprizes under the protection of God, will have a happy issue, being with all imagi∣nable respect, 
&c.




The Prince answered 
de Ruiter
 again in the man∣ner following,




Noble, Equitable, Valiant, Well-Beloved, Incom∣parable,


YOurs of the 24th. instant was delivered to us;
 and we were glad to hear the things of which it makes mention. As to the opinion of Vice-Admiral 
Evertsz,
 which is, that the Vice-Admiral and Rear Admiral of 
Zealand
 ought to preceed in rank, those of the College of the Ad∣miralty of 
Amsterdam,
 we think fit, that with∣out prejudice to the right of any Person, things be left at present in the same order which has been observed for some time, according to which you may regulate your self. Moreover, we have very carefully recommended to Lieutenant Ad∣miral 
Tromp,
 to receive your orders with due respect and obedience, as the said Lieutenant Ad∣miral has promised to do. We are perswaded, he will worthily acquit himself of that duty, and all things will tend to a good and salutary end for the Service of the State, and the pre∣sent conjuncture. I recommend you to the protecti∣on of God, 
&c.




On the first of 
June,
 Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 invited Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 and all the rest of the

 General Officers of the Fleet with him, to dine on board him. And they made on that occasi∣on a thousand protestations one to the other of a sincere and tender friendship. The other Ge∣nerals, and all the Captains drunk healths to their Country, giving a thousand assurances of their zeal and inviolable adherence to its service; and they all swore, they were ready to spend the last drop of their blood for its Interest. So much good will gave great hopes of an assured Victory and an occasion to make proof of it soon pre∣sented, since about 4 a Clock in the afternoon, whilst they were yet at Table, the advanced-guards of the Fleet gave them notice, they had disco∣vered the Enemies Fleet.


And a little while after, their scouts appeared. But because 'twas late, the 
Dutch
 Fleet tackt a∣bout to the North West, and begun to dispose all things ready to come to an Engagement, the next day. The 
English
 Fleet had cast Anchor to the West-ward of the 
Dutch,
 and prepared likewise for fight, but a Calm coming on, the two Fleets could not come up with one another. The next day there arose a surly Wind with some Rain, which obliged both parties to remain at Anchor in presence of one another. On the 4th and 5th the Wind rose higher still, and became more violent. But at length on the 7th. which was the day of the monthly fast, and the same day on which the 
Dutch
 had attackt the Enemies in 
Solbay
 the last year, the two Fleets engaged.


Admiral 
de Ruiter
 held a Council of War as soon as it was day, where it was resolved to weigh their Anchors a-peak to be ready for fight. But no sooner were the Officers that had been at the Con∣sult, gone off from on board the Admiral, but the two Royal Fleets made a Motion, and having cast their Squadrons into the form of a Crescent, made up directly towards the 
Dutch.
 The Forces of those two Potent Fleets were ve∣ry

 unequal, according to the 
Dutch
 reports. For those of the Allies were said to consist of 140 sail, whereof 90 were Capital men of War, whereas the 
Dutch
 pretend to have had there but 52 Capital ships but ill manned and furnished, 12 Frigats, 14 Advice Yachts, and 25 Fire-ships, making in all 103 sail. There were several ships that were not yet come into the Fleet; for of the 
Zealand
 Squadron there were hardly 4; and of 
Friesland,
 and 
Groningen,
 there were none at all; and of those of 
Amsterdam
 and 
Rotterdam
 there were the ships of Vice-Admiral 
Sweers,
 of the Commander 
de Meuwen,
 of Captain 
Bra∣kel,
 and several others that were not yet come. Nay, they were forced for want of Seamen, to take the men out of 3 
Zealand
 Frigats, to man Lieutenant Admiral 
Bankert
's ship. In the mean while, the 
English
 and 
French
 Fleets, ha∣ving the Weather gage, came nearer and nearer to the 
Hollanders.
 Prince 
Robert
 who had the Command in chief of the two Royal Fleets, led the Vanguard, which was the Red Squadron. The Count 
d' Estree
 had the Conduct of the main Battle, or of the White Squadron; And Sir 
Edward Sprag,
 Admiral of the Blue, Commanded the Rear. The 
English
 being ill satisfied at the Conduct of the 
French
 in the last Battle, durst trust them no more, but fearing they would desert them a∣gain as they did before, thought fit to place them under their own Squadrons; so that Mr. 
d' As∣sedan,
 the 
French
 Rear Admiral, was placed under Prince 
Robert
's, Squadron and the Marquess 
de Grancy
 under that of Admiral 
Spragg.
 As to the Or∣der of the 
Dutch
 Fleet, 
Tromp
 led the Van, 
de Ruiter
 the main Battle, and 
Bankert
 the Rear.


Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 seeing the Enemies White Squadron advancing towards him, made a speech to his Officers, and represented to them, 
the necessity of there duty, and to fight like brave men; that for that effect, they needed but to

 follow his example: That for his own part he was spurred on by no other interest to give proofs of his Zeal to his afflicted Country, but that of the Love and Tenderness he had for it: That he had no other end in coming to Sea, but to labour to restore the shaking State of its af∣fairs, by delivering it from those Disasters and Calamities that were ready to overwhelm it, and which without a speedy and timely assi∣stance, threatned it with inevitable ruine. That he had much rather sacrifice his Life for it▪ than to Live to suffer its ancient Liberty to be op∣pressed, and the 
Dutch
 Nation forced to un∣dergo the unsupportable Yoke of a Foreign and Tyrannick power. We have, pursued he, a just God, and an Equitable Cause, upon which having an entire trust and confidence, I doubt not of a good and happy success, if you will but behave your selves like brave men.
 E∣very one of them at those words, promised him to do so; and as soon as prayers were done, 
Tromp
 turned to the Seamen of his ship, and cri∣ed to them, 
Children, the Enemy is near us, let every one of you now give proofs of his bravery, and satisfy the Engagements that brought us hither on board; And if you do it I'll assure you, that I will recompense you, and that all shall go well.
 After that discourse, the Seamen testified an unexpressible joy, throwing their Caps up into the Air, and crying out! 
Long live Tromp?
 with promise to spend to the last drop of their blood for the Ser∣vice of their Country.


About 2 a Clock in the afternoon, the Battle begun. The White Squadron engaged with that of Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp.
 It is not to be ex∣prest with what valour and undaunted Courage they fought; and notwithstanding the inequali∣ty of their Forces, thanks, under God, to the Cowardice, or rather perfidiousness of the 
French
 to the 
English,
 the advantage after having a long time

 wavered, was at last forced to declare in favour of the 
Hollanders,
 and was by them stiled a Victory. Tho' at the same time it be certain, that if the 
French
 had managed the War then only by Land, and left the 
English
 to their own sole but whole strength to attack the 
Dutch
 by Sea, they would have been so far from preten∣ding to Victory, that they would have inevitably been destroyed; such disadvantage is there some∣times in a confederate Force, tho' seemingly great∣er than an Enemies, when the Allies act not in full Concert, Union and Fidelity one with ano∣ther. The most part of the Circumstances of that Battle, as reported by the 
Dutch,
 are rela∣ted in the Letters written on that Subject to his Highness the Prince of 
Orange,
 and to the States General, by the two Admirals, 
de Ruiter
 and 
Tromp
 which we have here inserted.




High and Mightinesses,


WE engaged Yesterday about two in the af∣ternoon, in a Battle which lasted till night.
 In breaking in amongst the Enemies, our ship, 
the Golden Lion,
 was so roughly handled, that we were forced to remove to the ship, called 
the Prince on Horseback,
 whose Captain 
Van Ber∣gen
 was killed. I put up my Flag there, and then returned to the fight. We fought on board that ship, till about 7 a Clock when our Main Mast being shot over board into the Sea, we were forced to change ship again, and to go on board the 
Amsterdam,
 Commanded by Cap∣tain 
Vander Zaan.
 We engaged again afresh in the fight, till dark night parted us. The Ene∣mies ships that were the forwardest next the place where we were, had already begun to flie with all the sail they could. We are at present on board the ship 
Comet,
 Commanded by Cap∣tain 
Middeland,
 and we hope, that Almighty God, to whose protection we Commit your High

 and Mightinesses, will grant a Compleat Victory to our dear Country, 
&c.






Most Serene Prince,


MY last written to your Highness was dated the 6th. Instant. After noon, the air be∣gun to clear up a little, and towards evening we could see the Enemies again. During the night the ill weather was quite ap∣peased. On the 7th in the morning it was fair Weather, and the Wind was North-West. That day the Enemies Fleets begun to move. I fi∣red the usual signal to call a Council of War, where it was resolved to keep our Anchors a-peak, to be ready to be weighed up at the first approach of the Enemies. The Officers that had assisted at the Council of War were not yet gone away from on board me, when the Roy∣al Fleets advanced towards us in the form of a Crescent. The White Squadron that was turn∣ed towards the North, was the first that enga∣ged with Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 and both of them tackt to the North-East-ward. The Squadrons that were under mine, and Lieutenant Admiral 
Bankert
's Command, could not be so soon attackt by the Enemies. However to pre∣vent them from separating us, we made likewise to the North-East-ward till about two in the afternoon; and then we thought it time to tack about to the Southward, after we had given the sig∣nal for it, and sent notice to Lieutenant Admi∣ral 
Tromp,
 by an Advice-Yacht of that motion; and then I engaged with the Red Squadron, and 
Bankert
 with the Blue one. I was more for∣tunate in breaking in amongst the Enemies than 
Bankert,
 for his main Top-mast, being shot down he had much ado to advance, however he got a great way in, we broke quite through the E∣nemies, and we cut several of their ships from the main of their Fleet by getting the Weather-gage

 of them. We thought not fit to pursue them, but rather to make a motion towards the North, in Order to veer back towards Lieute∣nant Admiral 
Tromp.
 We joined him towards evening. When we charged the Enemies they tackt about to the South-ward, and we made the same motion, and fought till the night part∣ed us. After the Battle we went and anchored within two miles of 
West-Kappel.
 As for the particular passages of the whole time of the fight, it is impossible for us to give an exact relation of them, because we have not yet had time to be informed of them. But however it be, we presume, that, God be praised, the Victory is on the side of the States, and of his Highness. And in order to make it a Compleat one, we will put our selves in readiness to fight with all the vigour imaginable, hoping that God will bless our arms more and more. The fight was furious on both sides, and on our side some did better than others, according as the Wind was more or less favourable to them, and 'tis like the same hapned also amongst the Enemies. There were a great many ships endamaged on both sides. We have lost some Officers, 
viz.
 Vice Admiral 
Schram,
 Rear Admiral 
Ʋlug,
 as likewise the Captains, 
Van Bergen
 and 
Bakker;
 Captain 
Nassaw,
 is dangerously wounded. The Fire-ships of both Fleets were able to do but little exe∣cution, and yet a great many of them were ei∣ther burnt, or sunk. We have named Rear-Admiral 
de Haan
 to the Vice-Admiralship va∣cant by the death of 
Schram,
 under the Flagg of Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 and the Comman∣der 
Meuwen
 to the Rear-Admiral's place, who came to the fleet Yersterday in the time of the fight. He reported to us, that he had taken a Yacht coming from 
London,
 laden with refresh∣ments, and some Rich suits of Cloaths for the

 Count 
d' Estree.
 There is likewise come to us another frigat from 
Friesland,
 carrying 30 Guns, and 150 men. That there might arise no con∣fusion by removing the flag, I have ordered Rear Admiral 
Ʋlug
 to put it up in his ship till further order. The Captain of a 
French
 fire-ship whom we saved, Reports to us, that the 
English
 fleet consisted of 60 men of War, and 30 fire-ships, and that the 
French
 Squadron was composed of 30 men of War, the least of which carried 50 Guns, and of 10 or 12 fire-ships, and and that reckoning in the Advice-Yachts, the Confederate fleets were composed of 140 sail; That Prince 
Robert
 Commanded in chief; that the Count 
de Estree,
 had the Conduct of the White Squadron, and Sir 
Edward Spragg
 that of the Blue; and that the two fleets, 
English
 and 
French
 were mingled together. The Enemies are at present to the North-West and a quar∣ter West-ward, at about two miles distance from us, busy in repairing their damages.




Here follows 
Tromp
's Letter to the States.




High and Mighty Lords,


WE are now more particularly informed of what passed in the last Battle fought between the Naval Forces of 
England
 and 
France,
 and the fleet of the Ʋnited Provinces. We are perswaded that the Enemies have lost 
11
 or 
12
 Ships that were burnt or sunk, and several Fire-Ships. We have, God be thanked, lost not one Ship, except some fire-Ships, to about the Number of 
6,
 if I mis∣take not. The fleet is still in a very good condi∣tion, and if the Wind had not risen, 
de Ruiter
 and I were resolved to attack the Enemies again. But since God permitted us not to do that, we are now labouring with speed to repair our damaged Ships. I am returned again on board the 
Golden Lion
 which wants nothing but her main yard. I have writ into 
Zealand
 to have another speedily sent

 me. We have found on board the said Ship about 
100
 men killed or wounded; whose places we will endeavour to supply again out of other Ships. Rear-Admiral 
de Haan
 is likewise returned on board his Ship, which is now also in a good condition, he is named by way of Provision, to fill up the place va∣cant by the death of Vice Admiral 
Schram,
 in our Squadron; and the Commander 
de Meuwen,
 is to supply that of Rear Admiral 
de Haan,
 &c.




Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 gave likewise in this Battle, as he had done in all the precedent ones in which he was present, most signal proofs of his un∣daunted Courage. The very Number of ships he was forced to change, is enough to serve for his 
E∣logium
 in that behalf; for before the fight was over, he had already changed his ships three or four times, which were all so extreamly shat∣tered that they were quite disabled. Rear Admi∣ral 
de Haan
 behaved himself likewise very gal∣lantly, having been forced to shift his ship three times.


De Ruiter,
 and 
Tromp
 in that rencounter gave one another most noble and generous proofs of tenderness and affection. By the assistance 
de Ruiter
 gave to 
Tromp,
 he was delivered from the Eminent Peril under which he was ready to sink; for being engaged in the midst of two Squa∣drons of the Enemies, he endured a most Terri∣ble encounter without any hopes of ever being able to go through it. 
Tromp
 being sensible of his danger begun to despair of escaping it, unless 
de Ruiter
 would come speedily to his assistance, and he was already in an extream impatience to see him, and comforted up his discouraged Sea∣men with the hopes of seeing themselves soon de∣livered by that Great man. And as soon as 
Tromp
 saw 
de Ruiter
 appear, his joy was extream, so that he cried out! 
Courage, my lads, see there's the best of our friends that is advancing and co∣ming

 to our assistance, and I likewise will never de∣sert him neither so long as I live. De Ruiter
 ac∣companied with Lieutenant Admiral 
Bankert
 and his Squadron, broke then through the Ene∣mies Squadrons, and delivered him with as much zeal as fidelity, which promised hopefully that the Reconciliation of those two great men, would for the future continue firm and inviolable.


On the 12 of 
June,
 the fleet was sufficiently repaired, and in a condition to attack the Ene∣mies again; when 
de Ruiter
 presently called a Council of War, in which it was Resolved, that since there was no further Reinforcement to be expected from the Country, and that on the con∣trary, the 
English
 were to receive one, with the first Westerly Wind, it was better to prevent them, by attacking them first, unless they receiv∣ed Orders to the contrary from the States; That all things should be got ready for that effect a∣gainst the 14th. to endeavour by the protection of God, to chase them off the Sea. Accor∣dingly they Ordered the whole fleet to be di∣vided into three Squadrons. The first was com∣posed of 17 men of War, 2 frigats, 8 fire-ships, and 5 Advice-Yachts, under the Command of Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 Lieutenant Admiral 
Van Nes,
 Vice-Admiral 
de Liefde,
 and Rear Admiral 
Van Nes;
 the second was also composed of 17 men of War, 2 frigats, 8 fire-ships, and 6 Advice Yachts, un∣der the Conduct of Lieutenant Admiral 
Ban∣kert,
 Vice Admiral 
Evertsz,
 and Rear-Admiral 
Dik.
 Lastly the third was Commanded by Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 Vice Admiral 
Sweers,
 and Rear Admiral 
de Haan,
 and consisted likewise of 17 men of War, 3 Frigats, 8 Fire-ships, and 5 Advice Yachts.


The same day the resolution was taken to at∣tack the Enemies, the Deputies of the States, Mr. 
Boetsclaar
 and Mr. 
Reigersbergen
 came on board Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 and being informed of the

 design that was projected, they approved it. There∣fore the Signal was given to the whole Fleet, to set sail, and advance towards the Royal Fleets, whose Forces that before the first Fight, consisted of 140 Sail, were then reduced, as was reported among the 
Dutch,
 to 118, by the Losses they had suffered. The 
Dutch
 Fleet then weighed Anchor between 11 a Clock at Noon; and the 
English
 and 
French
 Fleet seeing them approach, got themselves like∣wise under Sail, and made shew as if they would have stood them, and been glad to engage them; but as soon as the 
Dutch
 begun to come near them, and play their Guns at them, the Enemies tackt away to the North-west-ward, and stood for the Coast of 
England,
 with all the Sail they could. The 
Dutch
 Fleet followed them close, but could not oblige them to make a stand, till about 4 in the Afternoon.


At that Time Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 who commanded the Van-guard, engaged with the 
Blue Squadron,
 commanded by Sir 
Edward Spragg; de Ruiter,
 on his side attacked the Main Battle, or 
Red Squadron,
 commanded by Prince 
Robert;
 and about 5 a Clock the two Chiefs of the Hostile Fleets were engaged in a very fierce Fight. A little while after, Lieutenant Admiral 
Bankert,
 who commanded the Rear, fell likewise upon the 
White Squadron,
 un∣der the Command of the Count 
d' Estree.
 The Fleets fought a great while, and the Fight was ve∣ry obstinate; but as the Royal Fleets had signified at the very first, that they had no mind to engage, they left off Fighting, and dextrously made use of the Advantage of the Wind, which they had, to retire towards the 
English
 Coasts. Lieutenant Ad∣miral 
Tromp
 was the first and the last in the Fight, and the Bravery with which he attacked Admiral 
Spragg,
 who likewise did Wonders, can never be sufficiently admired.




Among other remarkable things that happened in that last Engagement, Vice-Admiral 
Sweers,
 that commanded a part of 
Tromp
's Squadron, being in the Ship called the 
Elephant,
 a much better Sailer than the 
Golden Lion,
 in which 
Tromp
 was, going before him, went away so swiftly that the rest of the Ships of his Squadron could not follow him, by which means he found himself on a sudden en∣gaged with 
Spragg,
 and the Vice-Admiral of the 
English Blue Squadron,
 without any Ships near him to back him, but only 3 Frigats commanded by 
de Jong, Hartwich,
 and 
de Noirot;
 for the other Captains of his Squadron, instead of following him, as they were obliged to do, veered back again towards Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp; Sweers
 seeing himself so unexpectedly deserted, made all the Re∣sistance he could, but after he had born a very fierce Shock, he was so terribly shattered by the Ships of the 
Blue Squadron,
 that he was at last forced to quit the Line of Battle, and make off further to Sea, to repair his Damages, which Conduct of his was interpreted by 
Tromp
 to be a piece of Cow∣ardice, tho' the Truth was, 'twas pure Ne∣cessity that obliged 
Sweers
 to act in that man∣ner.


Admiral 
de Ruiter
 had engaged, as we have said, with Prince 
Robert
's Squadron, and their two Ships having grappled one another fought both very de∣sperately. 
Bankert
 likewise signalized himself, and fought with great Valour against the 
White Squa∣dron,
 which was very severely handled by him. Prince 
Robert
 was forced in that Fight to remove out of the 
Royal Charles,
 that was disabled, into the 
Old Soveraign,
 and then making the best of his way towards 
England,
 the two Royal Fleets fol∣lowed him in Disorder. In the mean while, the 
Dutch
 Fleet finding they had the Advantage, past that Night in the Place where the Battle was fought, with a Resolution to advance the next Day and pre∣sent a third Battle, to the two Royal Fleets, in

 case they would accept it; but when Day was come, they could see neither 
English
 nor 
French
 appear, but heard they were retired into the 
Thames:
 Which was a surprizing thing to the 
Dutch,
 to find that two such powerful Fleets as were the 
Eng∣lish
 and 
French,
 and so much superior to them in Force, should so shamefully fly from them. But the Cause of it was imputed to the treacherous Conduct of the 
French,
 and the Animosities of Prince 
Robert
 against them on that account, and the Hatred he and most of the 
English
 then in general bore to that leaguing with a Popish and Dangerous Power against a Protestant State, and other Jealou∣sies then reigning, concerning the pernicious in∣trigues then carrying on between the already per∣verted Duke of 
York
 and the 
French,
 against the 
English
 Religion and Constitution, which made the Officers and Seamen, very cold in prosecuting the then Quarrel against the 
Dutch
 in comparison of what they had been in the former Wars. However it was, when the 
Dutch
 saw the Enemies were re∣treated home, they retired likewise, and went and anchored at 
Schooneveld,
 from whence Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 writ the following Letter to the States.




High and Mighty Lords,


YEsterday at 11 a Clock,
 having weighed An∣chor with an East-Wind, the 
Holland
 Fleet made a Motion in order to approach the Enemies, who unmoored at the same time, and made away with full sail from us, to avoid a Fight. Scarcely had we joyn'd them, but our Squadron which had the Van, engaged with the Enemies 
Blue Squadron,
 which begun about 4 a Clock in the Afternoon. The Shock was fierce and obstinate, and was not discontinued but by the approach of the Night. A little while after I had begun the Attack, Lieu∣tenant Admiral General 
de Ruiter
 and Lieutenant Admiral 
Bankert
 engaged likewise, and fought

 vigorously. We chaced the Enemy as far as with∣in 5 Miles of 
Solbay.
 Night being come on, we tackt about, and steered towards 
Schooneveld,
 which is the Place of our General 
Rendezvous.
 It is not to be expressed how much Courage and Affection the whole Fleet testifies. We saw one great 
English
 Ship burnt and several more are ex∣tremely endamaged. As to what passed in other Squadrons, your High and Mightinesses will doubtless be soon informed of it, to which we referr our selves. I do not see we have lost any one Ship. We pray God Almighty to be pleased more and more to bless the Glorious Government of your High and Mightinesses, 
&c.




This second Battle cost the Enemies, according to their own Report, about 3000 Men that were killed or wounded. Two Days after that great Action, the Deputies of the States coming on Board, a Council of War was called, in order to take new Resolutions about what it were best to under∣take, that might be useful and advantageous to the State: Where the Conduct of Vice-Admiral 
Sweers
 in the last Battle was brought in Question, which caused great Disputes between 
Tromp
 and 
Sweers,
 and they were pusht on with so great a Transport of Heat and Animosity by 
Tromp,
 that it was to be feared, they would have been attended with very ill Consequences.


Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 upbraided 
Sweers
 to his Face, That he had not done his Duty, through a shameful Cowardice, which had made him turn his Back before the Enemies. And he alledged, That the said Vice-Admiral going foremost, with a part of his Squadron, had not attackt the Enemy as he ought; and further, that he had not maintained the Attack neither, when he was engaged any bet∣ter than he had begun, because he kept still so to the Windward, that the Captains that were under him were forced to quit him, and to veer back and

 joyn him the said 
Tromp,
 as all those Captains could faithfully testifie.


To that, Vice-Admiral 
Sweers
 answered in his Justification, That the Damages his Ship had suffer∣ed, as well as the great number of Men he had killed and wounded on Board him, sufficed to clear him from the Injustice and cruel Outrage done to his Reputation, since by that it might easily be seen he was hotly engaged with the Enemies at the Be∣ginning of the Fight; but that at last his Main-topmost being shot down, he was forced, much against his Will, to retire, in order to repair his Damages; That in such an occasion it was impossi∣ble for him to change his Ship, because that of Captain 
Jong
 was as much disabled as his own, and that besides the Frigats that seconded him were too small to put his Flag up in; And that he made Oath before God, that he was not guilty of the Crime imputed to him, but that he had performed as well as any Man in the Fleet.


And the Quarrel between these two Generals grew so hot, that they would have proceeded from Words to Blows, had it not been for the Respect they were obliged to have for the Deputies of the States, who were there present, and who, to pre∣vent the mischievous Consequences that might follow from those Differences, ordered 
Cornelius Evertsz, Van Nes,
 and 
John Dik,
 accompanied with 
Van Wouw,
 the Fiscal of the Fleet, to go on Board Vice-Admiral 
Sweers
 Ship, to examine the Damages he had suffered, and to report them to the Council of War. Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 fortified his Accusation with 14 Depositions which were receiv'd, and which all amounted only to this, 
viz. That they had seen Vice-Admiral
 Sweers 
to the Windward, a great way off from the rest, and knew not the Reason of it.


Vice-Admiral 
Sweers
 replied to all that, in the first Place, by a List of the Losses and Damages his Ship had suffered, authorized by the Attestation of

 the Commissioners appointed to examine them, who loudly declared, 
That if the Ship had been their own, they must have been constrained to act in the same manner as
 Sweers 
had done.
 In the second place he produced a list of his killed and woun∣ded men, which were to the Number of 32 of the latter, and 11 of the former, which was at∣tested by the Chirurgeons of his ship. The Prince of 
Orange
 taking that affair to heart, sent word to the Council of War, that he desired them, to put it off till some further time, that he might him∣self be fully informed of the whole truth of it. 
Tromp
 and 
Sweers
 professed themselves well sa∣tisfied with it, and promised to conform to his Highnesses orders, and that was the end of the dis∣pute between those two Generals.


On the 19th of the month upon advice, that the Royal fleets were retired into the 
Thames
 Rear Admiral 
de Haan
 was detacht away with a Squadron of 12 men of War, 2 fire-ships, and 4 Advice Yachts, with order to observe them. And he reported at his return, that he had heard from a pilot of 
Lubeck
 that came from 
London
 on the 16th, that the two Hostile fleets were riding near 
Sheerness
 to the Number of about 70 men of War, and that they were to go up the Ri∣ver as far as 
Tilbury Hope,
 to take on board 30000 men of Regular Troops in order to at∣tempt a descent upon the Coasts of 
Zealand,
 and that there were already 20 ships ready.


On the 27th. the two fleets of 
England
 and 
France
 put to Sea again, being 150 sail strong, 
viz.
 80 
English
 and 28 
French
 men of War. The 
Dutch
 fleet on the other side, were but 100 sail in all, in∣cluding the Reinforcements they had lately received; but however, in that dangerous Juncture, they re∣solved notwithstanding the inequality of their Forces to go and meet the Enemies, and give them Battle. And on th
 1st. of 
August,
 they met them, but the Enemi
s who intended nothing

 less than an Engagement endeavoured to avoid a fight. Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 whose Squa∣dron had the Van, fired several Guns at them to invite them to an Engagement, and presented them Battle, but that was not their design. The 
Hol∣landers
 observing the Enemies behaviour, presu∣med it to be a Stratagem they played to make shew as if they fled, only to draw the 
Dutch
 a∣way from the Coasts of 
Zealand,
 that they might have opportunity afterwards to execute their great design, which was a descent. And in effect, they were not deceived; for the next day towards evening, the Royal Fleets appeared before the 
Meuse,
 and a day after, before 
Scheveling.


At that motion of theirs, all 
Holland
 was in an alarm for fear the Enemies should enter into the heart of the Country to waste and destroy it, and therefore in order to oppose them, all the Companies of the Burghers of the 
Hague,
 and of 
Delft
 and all the peasants of the villages round about were Commanded to march with all haste towards the Coasts. Cannon was likewise sent down thither to furnish sufficient batteries of de∣fence. About 11 a Clock before noon, 6 or 7 light Frigats approacht so near the Coasts by fa∣vour of the Tide, that the 
Dutch
 on shore be∣gun to play their Cannon at them, which the 
English
 answered with the like, but without doing much mischief. After that the Enemies made off a∣gain into the main Sea, and shew'd themselves the same day in the afternoon, near 
Zandvoort
 and 
de Wikopzee,
 about three miles from the shore, and sending up 2 Frigats near to this last place, they bat∣tered it for some time with their Guns. The next day they appeared likewise before 
Egmond
 and 
Petten,
 and lastly before 
Helder,
 and the 
Texel.


The Prince of 
Orange
 hearing at the Army which was encampt at 
Ramsdonk
 that the Enemies Fleets hovered about the Coasts of 
Holland,
 came with

 all hast to the 
Hague
 where he arrived on the 4th. of the month very early in the morning. He had ordered his Regiment of Guards and some Horse, to follow him in order to relieve the Burg∣hers that had guarded the Coasts of 
Scheveling
 under the Conduct of the Duke of 
Holstein.
 The Prince of 
Waldee,
 likewise came to the 
Brill
 at the same time, to give the necessary orders there; and General 
Wirtz
 was sent to 
Walcheren
 to look after the preservation of that post.


The Prince of 
Orange
 after he had been at se∣veral conferences held concerning the affairs of the Land Army, went down to the Fleet to give likewise his orders there; and he no sooner en∣tred on board Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 but they sa∣luted him with 13 Guns in acknowledgment of the honour of his presence, after which he assisted at the Council of War, where it was resolved Battle should be given the Enemies as soon as it was possible, in hopes thereby to force them at least to quit the Coasts and Harbours of the U∣nited Provinces. Those Resolutions being taken his Highness represented to every one their du∣ty and what great necessity there was in so pres∣sing an occasion, to fight courageously for the Honour and Interest of their Country: That done, he left the Fleet, with the acclamations of the Seamen who cried out 
Long live the Prince,
 and returned back towards the 
Hague.


The 
Dutch
 Fleet without any further delay, weighed Anchor the very next day, and steered away directly towards the 
Texel,
 where the Roy∣al Fleets were; but by reason of contrary winds they could not get up with the Enemies Fleet till the 20th.
 The next day in the morning, the fight begun, which proved one of the most furious and bloody ones that ever was recorded in Hi∣story, and that ever was fought upon the Ocean. The 
Dutch
 having got the Weather gage in the night fell upon the Enemies about the break of

 day. Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp
 had the van-guard, 
de Ruiter
 Commanded the main Battle, and 
Ban∣kert,
 the Rear. About half an hour after 7, the Royal Fleets made a motion, to attack the 
Hol∣landers. De Ruiter
 upon that presently gave a signal, and made his Squadrons make another mo∣tion to preserve the advantage of the Weather-gage, and to prevent the Enemies attack by at∣tacking them first. By that motion, 
Bankert
's Squadron that had the Rear before came to have the Van; 
de Ru
ter
's Squadron was still in the main Battle, and 
Tromp
's in the Rear.


About half an hour after 8, 
Bankert
 fell upon the Count 
d' Estree
's Squadron, which had the Van of the Royal Fleets, 
de Ruiter
 attack'd Prince 
Ro∣bert
's Squadron, and 
Tromp
 the Blue one Com∣manded by Sir 
Edward Spragg.
 Then the fight was general,
 and the two contending Fleets were throughly engaged. However, the 
French,
 ex∣cepting only Rear Admiral 
Martel,
 who fought with all the bravery imaginable, shew'd by their Conduct, that their design was to husband and spare their forces, and according to the opinion of most knowing men, it was presumed, the Count 
d' Estree,
 tho' he made a shew of fighting brave∣ly for a time, had secret orders from his Master to act in that manner, so that about 11 a Clock they very fairly made a tack about to the East-ward, and stood off to the Wind-ward, where they remained malicious spectators of the rest of the fight.


Admiral 
de Ruiter
 being engaged with Prince 
Robert,
 those two Admiral's and their Squadrons fought most desperately. Lieutenant Admiral 
Bankert
 seeing the 
French
 were gone off, thought not fit to pursue them any longer, for fear of being drawn away too far off from the main of the 
Dutch
 Fleet, but veered back towards the main Battle, and went to the assistance of Ad∣miral 
de Ruiter.
 Prince 
Robert
 seeing the main

 force of the 
Hollanders
 falling upon him, and that the 
French
 had left him in the Lurch, and would not come in to his assistance to enable him to dispute the victory, and being almost over∣whelmed, he and his, by the furious firing of two entire 
Dutch
 Squadrons, thought it time to provide for his and their safety, by a prudent retreat, and so steered away to the West-ward with all the sail he could make, and quitted the fight, leaving the advantage and claim of Vi∣ctory to the 
Hollanders,
 and was pursued by 
de Ruiter, Van Nes
 and 
Bankert,
 till two a Clock in the afternoon.


In the mean while the 
English
 Blue Squadron, and that of Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 having made a tack to the North in fighting, were already gotten to such a distance from the main of their Fleets, that they were out of sight. Ad∣miral 
de Ruiter
 fearing 
Tromp
 might be in dan∣ger thought fit to go and seek him out, in or∣der to assist him. And accordingly he advan∣ced with his own and 
Bankert
's Squadron that way.


Prince 
Robert
 observing the motion made by 
de Ruiter,
 begun to be in as much fear for 
Spragg
 as 
de Ruiter
 was in for 
Tromp;
 And therefore without any further hesitation, he ordered his Squadron to make the same motion as his Enemy that he might follow him; the Count 
de Estree
 with his Squadron followed him; but yet neither of them thought good to come near the 
Hollan∣ders
 any more, for fear of being obliged to come to a fresh engagement with them, and therefore they prudently kept at a distance out of the reach of Cannon-shot.
 In the mean while, 
Tromp
 and 
Spragg
 fought a long time with such an obsti∣nacy and desperate fierceness as was incredible, and to see them in the heat of fight, one would have said, those two Admirals had sworn their Mutual and Common Destruction.




Vice-Admiral 
Sweers
 who Commanded a part of 
Tromp
's Squadron, was engaged with the foremost Ships of the Blue Squadron, Commanded by Vice Admiral 
Kempthorn
 and Rear Admiral the Earl of 
Os∣sory. Sweers
 attackt 
Kempthorn
 so vigorously that he was forced at last to give way, which put to the rout most of the Ships of the Blue Squadron who were pursued by the 
Hollanders;
 But the two chiefs of the contending Squadrons continu∣ed fighting for 7 hours together with so much obsti∣nacy, that the Cannon and small shot played per∣petually without any intermission from both the two Admirals upon one another.


There hapned a thing extreamly surprizing, and al∣most incredible to 
Tromp
 in that Battle, that shews the great happiness that attended him in all the fights he was present in; which is that the Combat had already lasted 6 hours before he had so much as one man killed or wounded,
 out of 500 he had on board him; which extraordinary luckiness was lookt upon as a manifest proof of the Protecti∣on of God; for most of the Bullets were seen to flie either over or cross his Ship without doing any harm, tho' those two Chiefs of Squa∣drons fought pretty near one another. But Sir 
Edward Spragg
 was at last so severely handled by 
Tromp
 that he had 400 men killed, and 300 woun∣ded according to the Earl of 
Ossory
's report af∣terwards to 
Tromp
 of that Action; so that see∣ing himself re
uced to so pitifull a condition, he quitted the fight, and about noon betook himself to flight. 
Tromp
 did all he could to stop him, and with Cannon-balls beat down all his sails and his Mizzen Mast as he was pursuing him.


Spragg
 being thus disabled, 15 or 16 ships of his Squadron, advanced and fell upon the 
Golden Lion
 in which 
Tromp
 was, to revenge their friend's Quarrel, and setting some fire-ships at her, had like to have burnt her, but 
Tromp
 repulsed them so dextrously that they could do him no harm.

 The Enemies seeing their Fire-Ships take no effect, environed him round; and st
ed at him on all sides with continual broadsides from all their guns that in a little time his Ship was quite disabled; she was so grievously battered and pierced through and through with shot.


Tromp
 then was forc
d to quit his Ship, th
 
Gol∣den Lion,
 and went on board the 
Comet,
 and kept himself always close to the 
Royal Prince,
 to have a watchfull eye upon 
Spragg
 who after he had likewise changed his Ship was r
turned again to the fight. He was remov'd into the 
St. George,
 and did his utmost, to defend the 
Prince Royal
 that was in danger of being taken or burnt by 
Tromp; 
empthorn
 veered back likewise with a part of the Blue Squadron towards 
Spragg,
 and so by that succour and the motion they ma
e, the 
Royal Prince
 was secured. In the mean while, the 
St. George
 was so roughly handled that 
Sprag
 was likewise for∣ced to quit her, as being altogether disabled. Ac∣cordingly for that effect, he leapt into a Boat to go on board the 
Royal Charles;
 but soon after a Cannon Ball was Levell d so unluckily at the Boat that she was ready to sink;
 
Spragg
 seeing the dan∣ger he was in, ordered his men to row hard, to try to get back to the 
St. George;
 but it was too late; for the Boat sunk in an instant. The 
Eng∣lish
 running to his assistance, found him dead, ha∣ving his head and shoulders above water, and his hands and arms so strongly grasping the side of the boat, that they had much ado to get them loose. Such was the end of one of the most valiant Admirals 
England
 ever had. It is reported, that when he took his leave of the K. of 
England,
 he promised him to bring him Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
Tromp
 alive or dead, or else to lose his own Life in the attempt, which last ac∣cordingly came to pass.




The 
English
 Blue Squadron and that of 
Tromp
 were engaged in a bloody and obstinate fight, and if Prince 
Robert
 had not come in speedily to the assistance of the Blue Squadron, it had been totally defeated, which the Prince well foreseeing advanced with all imaginable haste, and joyned the the Blue Squadron about four a Clock in the af∣ternoon, and 
de Ruiter
 and 
Bankert
's Squadron had done the same thing with 
Tromp
's. And 
Spragg
's Ship having lost her Main Masts was towed away out of the fight by a Frigat.


After 
de Ruiter, Van Nes,
 and 
Bankert
 had joyned with 
Tromp,
 they all fell afresh upon the Ene∣mies, who had the Weather-gage, which gave oc∣casion to another fierce and bloody fight, whilst the Count 
d' Estree
 with his Squadron keeping all the time to the wind-ward, contented himself af∣ter his former manner to be only a Spectatour of the Fray, without troubling himself at all to assist the over-matched 
English,
 who seeing themselves so basely deserted, and attackt at the same time by the whole Force of 
Holland,
 were after a most valiant and vigorous resistance, for∣ced at last to give way, and about 7 in the Even∣ing, they begun to retreat, and were pursued by the 
Hollanders
 till the beginning of the Night, who forced them a second time to Quit the Sea.


The 
Dutch
 lost in that fight,
 the two Vice-Admirals, 
de Liefde,
 and 
Sweers,
 and the very same Evening, the Rear-Admirals, 
Van Nes
 and 
de Haan
 were named provisionally to supply their places. They lost likewise the Captains, 
Van Gueldre, Sweerius, Visscher,
 and 
Jobsz Kiela,
 but that which is most remarkable, is, that so great an A∣ction as that, cost the 
Hollanders
 only 4 or 5 Fire-Ships, without the loss of so much as one Man of War. The 
Dutch
 Fleet being thus Vi∣ctorious, kept out still at Sea, excepting only the Ships of 
Tromp,
 Rear-Admiral 
de Haan,
 and of the Captains, 
Brakel,
 and 
de Jong,
 which were

 sent into Port to be repair'd. As to the Number of their Men killed and wounded, in the whole Squadron of 
Amsterdam,
 there were reported to be but 71 of the first and 120 of the last, and in the other Squadrons proportionably.


As for the Loss on the 
English
 side,
 there were more said to be killed in Admiral 
Spragg
's single Ship than the 
Dutch
 would own to have been in their whole Fleet. There were also reckoned in that Number 4 Captains, recommendable for their Bra∣very, and many other Persons of Note, who all lost their Lives in that Battle. Two of their big∣est Ships were said to be sunk, and 6 or 7 burnt, and 10 of their Fireships spent and lost in vain. Here follow the Letters written concerning that Action, by the 
Dutch
 Admirals, to the States.




High and Mighty Lords,


BY my last, dated the 20th instant towards Evening, I certified your High and Mighti∣nesses, That we had discovered the same Day the Royal Fleets, having the Weather-gage. At Night they steered to the East-south-eastward, as we thought fit to do to the West-north-westward; so that the Wind turning to the East, we found our selves Yesterday-Morning in sight of the Coasts of 
Holland,
 having the Weather-gage. I present∣ly gave the Signal for our Fleet to get into Order of Battle, with a Resolution to attack the Enemy. The Royal Fleets seeing us prepare for Fight, did the like on their side; so that about half an Hour after 7, the two Fleets engaged. I attackt Prince 
Robert, Bankert
 attackt the Count 
d' Estree,
 and 
Tromp
 Sir 
Edward Spragg.
 We broke reciprocally one through the other, having sometimes the Wea∣ther-gage, and sometimes losing it. The Allies Fleet made at first a great effort with 28 Fireships, which they had, whereof 8 or 10 were destroyed in part by our Boats, who forced them to set Fire to them themselves, and then to quit them; We

 likewise lost 4 or 5 of ours. A Captain of an 
En∣glish
 Fireship that was taken Prisoner, reported to us, That the Enemies 5 or 6 Days ago took one of our Ships, homewards bound from the 
East-In∣dies,
 which came away before the rest. The Fight lasted till the beginning of the Night, and ended not but with the Retreat of the Royal Fleets, who steered away towards the 
English
 Coast in a very shattered Condition. Admiral 
Spragg
's Ship was towed away by some Frigats, having lost all her Masts. One of their biggest Men of War is sunk, and we have lost none at all. As for the Officers of our Fleet, we have lost the two Vice-Admirals, 
de Liefde
 and 
Sweers,
 and the Captains, 
Van Guelder,
 my Son-in-Law, and 
Sweerius,
 besides several others wounded. Secretary 
Andringa
 is in the Number of these last. We hope to inform your High and Mightinesses more particularly of the Circumstances of this great action; and we thank God, that he has left us the Masters of the Sea; which will favour the coming in of those Ships into our Harbours that are expected home, 
&c.






Admiral 
Tromp
's Letter to the States.


High and Mighty Lords,


THO' the Royal Fleets of 
England
 and 
France
 had on the 20th instant the Weather-gage, yet the Wind next Morning chopping about to the East-south-east, we found our selves to the Wind-ward, and they to the Lee-ward. Our Fleet was about a Mile from the Country of 
Petren.
 We tackt about to the North, and the Enemies to the South; about 8 a Clock we likewise made the same Motion to follow them. The Fleet of the Allies was 150 Sail strong, great and small. Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
Bankert
 having the Van, attackt the 
White Squadron.
 Admiral 
de Ruiter
 attackt

 Prince 
Robert,
 who commanded the Main Battle, and we attackt the Rear, or the 
Blue Squadron,
 commanded by Sir 
Edward Spragg.
 Our Ships, that were the foremost advanced towards the South-East, begun to play their Guns, and so insensibly the main Fleet engaged. Being come up directly to Admiral 
Spragg,
 we cannonaded him so terribly, that his Main and Mizzen Masts were both shot down, and then we were disposing our selves either to Board him or Burn him; but the Ships of his Squadron that backt him, running in to his Aid, made so great a Resistance that our Ship was reduced into a pitiful Condition, and was so disabled that I was forced to quit her, to remove into the 
Comet,
 where I put up my Flag about 2 a Clock in the Afternoon. In the mean while the Enemies having made themselves Masters of the Weather-gage, our Men were so far from letting them keep any Advantage from thence, that they attackt them with so much the more Bravery and Courage, and reduced them into such a Con∣dition, that their Squadron was almost ruined by it. We beat them till 7 a Clock in the Afternoon, when we forced them to quit the Sea. I hope to go to Day on Board the 
Elephant,
 vacant by the Death of Vice-Admiral 
Sweers.
 I do not know, that this Fight has cost us the Loss of so much as one Ship. As for what passed in the Squadrons of Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 and Lieutenant Admiral 
Bankert,
 I am perswaded, that the Letters of those two Admirals have fully informed your High and Mightinesses, 
&c.




The Bodies of Vice-Admiral 
Sweers,
 and of the Captains, 
Van Guelder,
 and 
Sweerius
 were carried to 
Amsterdam
 to be buried there; but that of Vice-Admiral 
de Liefde
 was sent to 
Rotterdam.
 Those great Men were accordingly interred with all the Honours due to their high Merit; and their Coun∣try for which they lost their Lives, omitted nothing

 that might contribute to the immortalizing their worthy Memory, erecting to them most stately Tombs, whereon are engraven suitable Epitaphs, to publish their Heroick Actions to Posterity, which are to be seen in the above-mentioned Cities.


After that happy Advantage, which in that Jun∣cture was more worth than a much greater Victory, the 
Dutch
 Fleet continued at Sea till the 22d of 
September,
 and then because there was no Appea∣rance of any thing considerable likely to pass be∣tween them and the Royal Fleets, during the re∣mainder of that Year the States sent them Orders to retire home. And accordingly on the 28 of the same Month,
 the Generals presented themselves before the Assembly of the States General, and of the States of 
Holland,
 where they received publick Thanks for the Zeal and stedfast Affection they had shewn for the Service of their Country in the three last Battles lately fought. After which the States were pleased to reward every one of them in parti∣cular. They also ordered a certain Gratuity in Mo∣ny to be given to the Widows of those General Of∣ficers that were killed; and for that effect the fol∣lowing Resolution was taken by them, and publisht the 30th of 
September,
 1673.


AFter a due Deliberation, it has been thought sit, in pursuance of the Resolution taken by their High and Mightinesses on the 28th instant,
 and in Acknowledgement of the Services the Generals of the Fleet have rendred to their Country in the last Battles fought against the Enemies Fleets, There shall be gi∣ven to Lieutenant General Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 a Letter of Constitution of 
6000 Livers
 annual Rent; to the Lieutenant Admirals 
Van Nes
 and 
Tromp 4000 Livers
 each; to the Widows and Heirs of the Vice-Admirals 
de Liefde, Sweers
 and 
Schram
 an Annual Allowance of 
2000 Livers
 each; to the Rear Admirals, 
John van Nes
 and 
de Haan 1000 Livers
 each as likewise to the Widow and Heirs of Rear Admiral

 
Vlug,
 a like Letter of Constitution of 
100 Livers
 Annual Pension.


These three successive Advantages the 
Dutch
 Fleet had gotten over the 
English
 and 
French,
 quite ruined all the Conquests the 
French
 King had made by Land, with as much Rapidity as Success; for thereby the Coasts and Havens of the 
Ʋnited Provinces
 being freed from the Oppression of two powerful Fleets, that kept them as it were besieged, the 
Dutch
 had thereby time to take Breath, and to draw from thence the Troops that were posted there, and to employ them elsewhere. For the Prince of 
Orange
 seeing Fortune begun to declare her self for his Arms, marched the States Army, that was reinforced by some 
Spanish
 Troops, towards 
Na∣erden,
 in order to besiege it; and after the Redu∣ction of that Place, he joyned the Emperors Army under the Command of Count 
Montecuculi,
 and formed the Siege of 
Bonne,
 that was taken on the 14th of 
November.
 Which happy Successes, and the Arrival of the Imperialist, absolutely broke the Measures of 
France
 and its Allies, and forced them all at a spurt to quit the Conquests they had made with so much Rapidity, by disabling them to pre∣serve them, without leaving themselves without Troops sufficient to oppose to the Prince of 
Orange
 and Imperialists in the Field, which it was much more dangerous for them, to let their Enemies be Masters of, than it was prejudicial to quit their late Conquests, and the Pride they took in having got∣ten them.


Therefore on the 7th of 
October
 they quitted 
Woorden,
 on the 14th of 
November Bommel,
 and on the 23d of the same Month 
Ʋtrecht,
 and in ge∣neral all the Conquests they had made in the Pro∣vinces of 
Ʋtrecht, Guelders
 and 
Over-Yssel:
 But before their Retreat, they extorted immense Sums from the Inhabitants, and committed all the De∣predations Cruelty and Despair could incite them

 to. So many fortunate Successes happening in so short a time, not only freed the 
Ʋnited Provinces
 from the Disasters they were like to sink under, but put them into a condition to take some Revenge for them.


For that effect, the States, redoubling their Care and Diligence, begun to think of Manning and Arming out a powerful Fleet;
 and resolved it should consist of 90 Men of War, 24 Fireships, and 24 Galliots, 
&c.
 amounting in all to 162 Sail. Whilst they were making those vigorous Naval Preparati∣ons, the 
Spaniards,
 who had declared War against 
France,
 by vertue of their Treaty of Alliance with the States General of the 
Ʋnited Provinces,
 employed the Marquess 
de Fresno,
 their Embassa∣dour in the Court of 
England,
 to endeavour a se∣parate Peace between the King of 
Great Britain
 and the States.
 The Negotiation that had been set on foot for a General Peace, at 
Cologn,
 was just then like to be broken off by the exorbitant Demands made by 
France
 and its Allies, so that the States finding there was no trusting to any Hopes on that side of a General Peace, used all their Artifices to separate 
England
 from the other Allies, and for that purpose sent full Power to the Marquess 
de Fresno,
 to treat on that Subject with that Crown, who managed it so dextrously, that on the 19th of 
Fe∣bruary,
 1674. a Peace was effectually concluded at 
Westminster
 between the States and the King of 
England,
 to the Exclusion of 
France,
 and its Al∣lies.


That Peace caused an unexpressible Joy to the 
Ʋnited Provinces,
 and raised hopeful Expectations in all their People; and as the Union of 
England
 with 
France,
 formed together, had they acted una∣nimously, so formidable a Sea-power, that it seem∣ed at first to the 
Hollanders,
 to have been invinci∣ble, tho' the Event, and ill cemented Correspon∣dence of those two Nations shewed the contrary, so now the 
Ʋnited
 Provinces had reason to flatter

 themselves with the Hopes, 
 that they should be able with much more ease to reduce 
France
 to Reason, being alone, after they had divid
d 
England
 from it, which was the more powerful of the two at Sea, than they could expect before. Which At∣chievement was as terrible a Stroke to 
France,
 as it was a Glorious and Advantageous Omen to the 
Ʋnited Provinces.


That troublesome Thorn being pluck'd out of their Foot, the States reflecting upon the immense Charges they had been forced to be at for equip∣ping out a Fleet, numerous enough to encounter two such formidable Sea-powers as they had had before upon them, thought they might now well enough retrench some of them, now they had none but 
Fran
 to deal with. And therefore they ordered, that th
 Fleet for the Year 1674 should be com∣posed only of 66 Men of War, 18 Fireships, 12 Great Galliots, and as many smaller ones, and 24 Flutes, 
&c.
 making in all 150 Sail, and that 9000 Regular Troops should be embarked thereon, and that they should carry with them 6 Months Pro∣vision; that a part of that Fleet, under the Com∣mand of 
de Ruiter,
 should sail towards the 
Caribbe Islands
 belonging to the 
French,
 to destroy them, whilst the other part, under the Conduct of Lieu∣tenant Admiral 
Tromp
 should advance towards the 
French
 Coasts, in order to make some Descent and Diversion there. And the General Rendezvous of that Fleet was appointed to be at 
Wielingen.




A Relation of the Principal Adventures that hap∣pened at Sea in the Year 
1674.
 taken out of the Original Memoirs of Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp.


THE Fleet of the 
Ʋnited Provinces
 weighed Anchor on the 24th of 
May,
 and on the 26th arrived before 
Dunkirk,
 from whence they de∣parted on the 27th towards 
Dover,
 where the Mar∣quess

 
de Fresno,
 the King of 
Spain
's Embassadour at the Court of 
England,
 came on Board the Ad∣miral, to see it. They afterwards kept cruising along the Channel, and about 
Torbay,
 till the 7th of 
June;
 and during all that time kept the Coasts of 
France
 in a continual Alarm.


Lieutenant Admiral 
de Ruiter,
 in pursuance of the States Orders, separated from Lieutenant Ad∣miral 
Tromp
 on the 8th, with a Squadron of Men of War and some Troops, and sailed away for the 
West-Indies:
 And then the rest of the Fleet under 
Tromp
 unmoored from 
Torbay,
 and arrived the same Evening near the 
Goutstart.
 On the 19th and 20th they discovered the 
Isle of Ʋshant.
 At the approach of the Fleet, the 
French
 fired their Beacons all-a-long the Coast, and the Arrierbann of 
Britainy
 were most of them posted in and about 
Brest,
 which they had taken great Care to fortifie: And they had placed a great many Ships at the Mouth of the Harbour, upon which they had pla∣ced Cannon, and erected Batteries. The 
French
 being so strong upon their Guard on that side, the Generals of the 
Dutch
 Fleet, found it impossible to execute their Projects there, and unanimously re∣solved to move towards 
Belle-Isle,
 and there to wait for such of their Ships as were straggled from the Body of their Fleet, and then to sail all together towards the Mouth of the 
Loire.
 According to that Project, the Fleet unmoor'd, and on the 22d a small 
English
 Vessel, that was sent out a scouting, returned to the Fleet, and brought with her a 
French,
 Sounder of 
S. Lazar.
 On the 23d the Fleet went and anchored on the East of 
Belle-Isle.
 As soon as the Duke 
de Chaulnes,
 Governour of 
Britainy,
 had heard of the Arrival of the 
Hollanders,
 he hastily drew together 4000 Peasants, which the next Day were reinforced with 4000 more, and 400 Gentlemen on Horseback, who came from 
Landernau, Guanove,
 and 
S. Renans:
 and besides that, he dispatched a Courier to the

 Marquess of 
Coetlogon,
 with orders to throw him∣self into 
Belle-Isle,
 which he accordingly did with 600 Foot, and 80 Gentlemen.


On the 24th the 
Dutch
 Fleet anchored on the East-side of the Castle, in 13 Fathom Water. There came likewise to the Fleet a small 
English
 Ship, which reported, There were 8000 Men in Arms in the Island, which was also confirmed by the 
French
 Sounder that was taken. But it being found afterwards that their Number in reality was but 3000, the 
Dutch
 resolved upon a Descent. But first the Count 
de Horn
 sent a Trumpeter with a Summons to the Governour of the Isle; who re∣turned in the Afternoon with this Answer, 
That both he the said Governour, and all the Inhabitants, were resolved to defend themselves to the last Extre∣mity, in case the Island were attacked.


On the 26th Lieutenant Admiral 
Tromp,
 and the Count 
de Horn,
 took a Boat, and went and viewed in what Places it would be most proper to make a Descent; and when they came back to the Fleet, they ordered the Land-Troops to be in Readiness for the next Day, with a Design to make then an Attempt, in case the Wind proved favourable: And accordingly, on the 27th, at Break of Day, the Signal was given for it, upon which all the Gal∣liots, being filled with Soldiers, approached the Shore, in order to make a Descent, by Favour of the Fire made by the Guns of their Men of War. The 
Dutch,
 being landed, found much less Resi∣stance than they expected, tho' the 
French
 had made double Retrenchments, and posted in them nume∣rous Guards; and that besides there was a Hill in the way very steep and difficult of Ascent. As soon as the Troops were landed, they drew up in order of Battle, and advanced towards the Castle, and when they came within Musket-shot of it, because it was now Evening, they made a Halt. In the mean while, a Detachment that had been sent a∣scouting out of the Castle, no sooner heard of the

 Approach of the 
Dutch,
 but they turned back in all haste, and retired again into the Fortress. On the other side, a part of the Fleet approaching as near as could be to the Castle, fired furiously at it, which the 
French
 did their best to answer in the like kind. On the 28th the 
Dutch
 went and en∣campt at 
Soison,
 where they seized on all the Cattle of the Country, and sent them to the Fleet: The same Day the Admirals 
Bankert
 and 
Van Nes
 were commanded to move to the Westward of the Castle, where it was lowest. On the 29th a Bark belong∣ing to the Castle came out to the Fleet with a White Flag, and brought a Letter from 
de Lorgerie,
 to the 
Dutch
 Generals, to let them know that he wanted Refreshments, and that if they would give him leave for two or three Fishing Vessels they should catch Fish for him and them too; but Ad∣miral 
Tromp
 would by no means grant his Re∣quest.


On the 30th 
Tromp
 sent another Trumpeter to the Castle, To desire the Release of some 
Dutch
 Prisoners, in consideration that the Count 
de Horn
 had already released a great Number of theirs, both Men, Women and Children. Upon which De∣mand, the Governour sent back 17 Soldiers and Sea∣men, and one Drummer, who venturing to straggle too far from the Army were taken by the 
French;
 and because in so doing they had transgressed their Orders, two of them at their Return were hanged for an Example. The 
Dutch,
 after having staid two Days upon the Island, resolved at length to re∣imbark again, without attempting any thing more upon the Castle, because they thought it would cost too much Time formally to besiege it. They carried off with them only three Pieces of Cannon from the Island to the Fleet.


On the 2d of 
July
 they unmoored, and on the 3d came to an Anchor in the Bay of 
Bourgneuf,
 right against 
Narmourtiers,
 and employed the rest of the Day in making the necessary Preparations

 in order to a Descent the next Morning. In the mean while, Admiral 
Tromp
 took Boat and went and viewed where it might be most proper to at∣tempt it. The Enemies had made several Retrench∣ments upon the Shore, and had placed there their Musqueteers. On the 4th the Signal was given for Landing, and thereupon all the Troops getting into Boats for that purpose, approached the Shore, to which they were forced to climb up over Rocks, or wade through the Water as high as their middles.


The 
French
 at the first Approach of the 
Dutch,
 fired something briskly upon them, but as soon as they saw them advance, and march towards them with an undaunted Resolution, they deserted their Retrenchments, and retired a great way up into the Country. They likewise quitted the Castle of the Island, so that the 
Hollanders
 were all landed about 7 in the Evening, and put up the Prince's Colours upon the Castle, and upon the Mills. They found 17 Pieces of Cannon planted along the Shore, which were sent to the Fleet, and 12 Ships that had been forced to run aground. The 
Dutch,
 in land∣ing, had but 135 M
n killed and wounded, Offi∣cers and all. The Prisoners reported, there were 5000 Men ready to pass into the Island from the firm Land, and that 500 of them were already arrived.


Upon those Advices, the Count 
de Horn
 hastned the March of his Troops, with a Resolution to oppose their Passage, leaving Captain 
Brakel
 with 3 Companies of Seamen and 60 Musqueteers in the Castle, and Captain 
Hardenbrock,
 with Admiral 
Tromp
's Company of Seamen in the Abbey, to guard those Posts. The Army being arrived towards Evening to the Place by which the 
French
 were to pass, found they were all retired back into the firm Land, where there appeared a Body of the Ene∣mies Horse and Foot. But the Army wanting Wa∣ter, they were obliged to remove, and encamp an

 Hours March back from thence, leaving Mr. 
Zo∣mersdyk
 with 400 men to secure that Post.


On the 5th of 
July
 2 Brigantines built Galley∣wise, and well armed, that were sent from 
Rochelle,
 arrived at the Island, and not knowing the 
Dutch
 had made a Descent there, without any Fear, ap∣proached the Shore. Mr. 
de Zomersdyk
 at the Sight of them, posting himself with 60 Musketeers behind a Rising Ground, made a Shew with his Men as if they had been 
French,
 the better to amuse and decoy them; whilst, on the other side, the 
Dutch
 fell upon them so suddenly, that they were forced to yield.


That Island contains about 1000 Houses, and is not above 250 Paces distant from the main Land, so that the 
French
 on the one side, and the 
Hollanders
 on the other could mutually cannonade one another. For when the Tide is low, the space between 
Bouin
 and 
Beauvoir,
 which is in the main Land of 
Poitou,
 is so very dry, that as many Men as please may pass in a Rank from either of the Places to the other, which may be done two Hours after the going out of the Tide.


The 
French,
 to intimidate the 
Dutch,
 gave out a Report, That their King had sent Orders to all the Horse and Foot that were on the other Side, to pass over to oppose their Depredations, and force them to quit that Post; but for all their Bravado's their Countenance well shewed, they were more apprehensive of the 
Hollanders,
 than the 
Hollan∣ders
 were of all their false Alarms, since they re∣moved all the Straw and Boiling Vessels that be∣longed to their Salt-pits, to 
Bouin
 and 
Beauvoir,
 for Security. In the mean while Admiral 
Tromp
 commanded all his Ships to return again to their Flag; on the 7th he approached the Shore with his whole Fleet, and recommended to his General Offi∣cers strictly to forbid their Seamen, under Pain of Death not to amuse themselves with plundring ashore either Cattle, or any thing else.




On the 8th of the same Month, 2 Frigats and 8 Fireships came back to the Fleet, and reported, they had been at 
S. Martha's Island,
 where they had seen stranded a 
French
 Frigat of 40 Guns, which afterwards by some Fire accidentally falling into her Powder-room, was blown up. The same Day a Frigat with 9 other Vessels, were detached away towards 
S. Andrews,
 to take in Water for the whole Fleet. Two Brigantines and 2 Yachts were likewise sent to cruise about 
Brest,
 to destroy the 
French
 Fisher-ships, and to take them, if pos∣sible. On the 9th 2 Frigats, 2 Fireships, and 2 Galliots more, were sent away towards the Island of 
S. Martha,
 and the Mouth of the River of 
Bour∣deaux.


On the 10th the Captains, 
Dekker
 and 
Megang
 came back to the Fleet, and reported, That they had presented themselves before the Island 
Heys,
 but durst not attempt a Descent for want of Men enough to execute it: That, according to the Re∣port of an 
English
 Ship come from 
S. Martha
's, the Appearance of the 
Dutch
 Fleet had put all the Islan∣ders into a great Consternation; that they had sent over into that Island 10000 Men, but the most of them Peasants, gathered up in haste, and some Pieces of Cannon. On the 11th, 5 Days Provision for the Subsistance of the Army was sent on Shore.


On the 14th the Frigats that had been cruising on the Coasts of 
Britany,
 came back to the Fleet, with a 
French
 Ship, that 6 Weeks before was in company with 22 Merchant Ships, under the Con∣voy of some 
French
 Men of War, who had con∣ducted them from 
Marseilles
 to the 
Straits Mouth.
 She carried 10 Guns, and 30 Men; 17 of the other Merchant-Ships saved themselves by running in close to Shore upon the Approach of the 
Hollan∣de
s.
 The 
Dutch
 Brigantines were ordered there∣upon, to return to the Coasts of 
Britany,
 to en∣deavour to take those Ships. On the 20th some

 Ships that had been detacht to cruise before the Mouth of 
Bourdeaux
 River came in likewise, and reported, That they had been informed by 24 Sial of 
English
 and 
Hamburgers,
 That the 
French
 King's Ships were retired to 
Rochfort,
 where they were secured by 5 
Barriers;
 and that 2 Fireships were preparing at 
Rochelle.
 The same Evening 3 Days Provision more was sent to the Land-Army.


On the 22d the Brigantines returned to the Fleet, and reported, they had destroyed 3 of the Enemies Barks, and that 4 or 5 small Ships laden with Am∣munition, were near 
Boulin:
 Upon which, Cap∣tain 
Hidder
 was forthwith dispatched away with some Brigantines, to destroy them.
 The 
Hollan∣ders,
 after they ha
 for three Weeks together ra∣vaged 
hat Island, resolved at length to quit it, but they first blew up the Castle, filled up the Re∣trenchments, that had been made a long the Shore, and plundered the Inhabitants. All the Cattle which they found there in great Numbers, was al∣ready consumed in feeding their Men, but they car∣ried off Hostages with them to the Fleet, for 14000 Crowns Contribution.


The Prisoners reported, That the Duke 
de Chaul∣nes
 was encamped with 400 Gentlemen of the Arri∣erban, between 
Crouil
 and 
Lazare,
 at about 6 Hours or Leagues from 
Narmoutier;
 That the Duke 
de Retz
 with 1200 other Gentlemen, and 5000 Inhabitants, was between 
Bourgneuf,
 and 
Machou,
 about a League from 
Narmoutier.
 The Duke of 
Vionville
 had his Post at 
Boulin
 and 
Beau∣voir,
 and commanded a Body of 2000 Gentlemen of the Arrierban and 8000 Inhabitants. The Duke 
de Gadagne
 commanded at 
Rochelle,
 at 
Oleron,
 and at the Isle of 
Rhe,
 where the 
French
 had their main Forces. For, according to the common Report of the Prisoners, and of the Men belonging to some 
English
 and 
Hamburg
 Vessels, there were in the Isle of 
Rhe
 alone 10000 Foot and 1000 Horse; and that the Foot-Regiments of 
Gadagne, Neuville,

 Louvigny,
 a Marine Battalion, and several other detached Companies, and the Horse Regiments of 
Courcelle
 and 
Bellegarde
 were arrived there 6 Weeks before.


In 
Oleron
 there were likewise a great many Horse and Foot, and 3 Weeks before, there was also ar∣rived a Marine Battalion to meet 
Tromp.
 The 
Spanish
 Governour of 
S. Sebastian
 writ to the Count 
de Horn,
 that after he had carefully inform∣ed himself of the Number of Forces the Enemies had about 
Rochelle, Bourdeaux
 and 
Bayonne,
 he had found, they amounted at least to 8000 Foot and 6000 Horse, and the Marshals 
de Grammont,
 and 
d' Obret,
 and the Counts 
de la Scre,
 and 
de Lou∣vigny
 had the guarding of the Coast between 
Bour∣deaux
 and 
Bayonne.


The 
French
 Prisoners, taken by the 
Dutch,
 as∣sured them likewise, That the Misery to which the People of those Coasts were reduced, was inexpressible; for that their Houses were plunder∣ed, and their Lands ravaged every whit as cruelly by the 
French
 Horse, as if they had had an Ene∣mies Army in the Heart of their Country. After the Reimbarkment of their Troops, the 
Dutch
 Generals thought fit, because their Fleet begun to want Fresh Water, and that the Ships they had sent to 
S. Andrews
 on that Errand, were not yet come back, to send out 2 Men of War and 5 Gal∣liots more to fetch them some, with Orders to them to sell off the Prizes they had taken from the 
French.


After that Expedition the Fleet sailed away for 
Cadiz,
 and arrived there on the 26th. When they entred the Bay, they rendred the 
Spaniards
 the usu∣al Salute of 60 Guns. Among a great many Persons of Quality that came on Board the Admiral, the most remarkable was 
Don Nicholas de Corduba,
 General of the 
Spanish
 Gallies. And there it was they heard the News of the Victory, as it was cal∣led,

 which the Prince of 
Orange
 had then newly obtained at 
Seneffe
 over the great Prince of 
Conde.
 On the 29th 
Don Diego de Cavalliero
 came also on Board, to complement Admiral 
Tromp,
 and the Count 
de Horn.
 He was received with all the Ci∣vilities due to his Rank; and they drank together the Healths of the King of 
Spain,
 of the States General, and of his Highness the Prince of 
Orange;
 after which he returned to the Town. On the 31st Admiral 
Tromp,
 and all the General Officers of the Fleet, were received at 
Cadiz
 with all ima∣ginable Honours: For the Governour came on Foot, followed by his Coach, and conducted him to his Palace, where he was treated with much Magnificence; which was further exprest by the Discharge of all the Cannon; after which, he went to the 
Dutch
 Consuls, where he was likewise received with great Honour, and returned the same Evening on Board the Admiral-Ship.


On the 11th of the Month of 
August,
 the Count 
de Ho n, don Bernardo de Salinas
 and Mr. 
de Som∣mersdyk,
 went to 
Madrid,
 where they were re∣ceived by the Queen of 
Spain
 with great Marks of Friendship. The Subject of their Journey was to confer with the chief Ministers of that Crown, and to concert with them what was most adviseable for the Fleet to attempt against the Coast of 
Pro∣vence.
 On the 1st of 
September
 they returned again to 
Cadiz,
 and were received there with all the Honours that could be exprest. On the 5th there were publick Rejoycings, and Bonefires were made all over the Town, and a great Number of Candles put up in Lanthorns in every Ship in the Fleet, to celebrate the Victory obtained at 
Seneffe
 by the Prince of 
Orange,
 which in the Darkness of the Night made the most delightful Spectacle in the World. Several whole Rounds of Cannon both from the Castles and Fleet likewise discharged, which loudly proclaimed the Universal Joy concei∣ved at those early and hopeful Successes of the Prince.

 On the 6th, the 
Dutch Smirna
 Fleet arrived in the Grand Fleet; and on the 7th they weighed Anchor and past the 
Straits
 in the Night, with Design to advance higher into the 
Mediterranean;
 but the Approach of the 
Winter,
 and some contrary Or∣ders 
Tromp
 received, broke off the Designs that had been projected to be put in Execution there; which obliged 
Tromp
 to quit the 
Mediterranean
 on the 1st of 
November,
 from whence on the 4th of 
De∣cember
 he arrived at the 
Texel.


After that Expedition, the Fleet disarmed. The Reputation 
Tromp
 had gained in the World was then so great, that he was lookt upon to be the greatest Man at Sea of his Time. And the King of 
England
 himself had conceived so much Esteem for him,
 that he passionately desired to see him; and for that Effect gave Order to the Earls of 
Arlington
 and 
Ossory,
 who had been some while at the 
Hague,
 To desire him, on his part, to be pleased to pass the Seas, and to go and stay some Weeks at the Court of 
England.


Tromp
 accordingly disposed himself to answer the Honour done him by that Prince; and on the 12th of 
January
 set Sail with 3 Yachts that waited for him; at his Departure he was saluted with se∣veral Guns, as well from the 
Brill,
 as from the Yachts appointed for his Transportation. The Prince of 
Orange
 in Person accompanied him as far as the 
Brill,
 and gave him all the imaginable Marks of the high Esteem he had conceived of his great Merit. On the 16th of the Month he arrived at 
London.
 The Duke of 
York,
 Dukes of 
Monmouth
 and 
Buckingham,
 with all the Grandees of the Kingdom, went to meet him, and did him the greatest Honours imaginable. The Curiosity of the People of 
England
 was so great to see him, That the Streets were so thronged with People, that there was hardly any passing. And appearing once at the 
Royal Exchange,
 there presently crowded in such a Multitude of People, that the Change

 as spacious as it was, 
 was not able to contain them.


The King of 
England
 to Honour the Virtue and Worth of one of the Greatest men at Sea that ever 
Holland
 bred,
 tho' he had been his E∣nemy, and had gotten most of his Reputation in Sea-Battles fought between the 
English
 and 
Dutch
 Fleets, would needs however raise him to the qua∣lity of a Baron and make it Hereditary to his Family; so that in default of Heirs male, it should fall to his Brother 
Harpetsz Tromp
 Burger Ma∣ster of 
Delft,
 and after him to his issue male, and upon failure of them, to his third Brother 
A∣drian Tromp,
 a Captain of a Ship in the Service of the States General.


And accordingly Letters Patents were imme∣diately expedited for that effect by the Lord High Chancellour of the Kingdom; after which, 
Tromp
 took his leave of his Majesty who presented him at parting with his picture enricht with Diamonds; and so departed towards the end of 
February,
 and returned to 
Holland.


The 
French
 King finding himself deserted by his own Allies, the Electour of 
Cologne,
 and Bi∣shop of 
Munster,
 who after the Example of 
Eng∣land
 had made likewise a separate Peace with the United Provinces, used all his Artifices to pro∣cure some new Alliances by which he might at∣tain his end, which was to be able to Revenge himself upon those who had left him so unex∣pectedly in the Lurch. His Quick-scented Policy presently suggested to him, that if he could find means to kindle a War between the Potentates of the North, his work were done, and he would thereby give a powerfull diversion to the arms of those Princes that were come in to the assistance of the 
Hollanders.
 The Court of 
Swedeland
 seemed to him the most proper to be wrought upon to fa∣vour his enterprizes, because of the long Alliance that had been between that Crown and 
France.


 Mr. 
de Fenquieres,
 was therefore dispatcht away in quality of Ambassadour Extraordinary from the most Christian King to the Crown of 
Swedeland,
 and so prevailed by his sollicitations upon the cor∣rupt Ministers there, and the young experienced easy King, that he perswaded them to a Rupture, so that General 
Wrangel
 drawing together the 
Swedish
 Army in 
Pomerania,
 fell suddenly upon the Territories of the Electour of 
Brandenburg,
 and was so successfull at his first on-set, that he, soon gained the passes of 
Lokkowits, Zedenik
 and 
Bernaw,
 and made himself Master of 
Landsbergen,
 of the new and old 
Rupin,
 and of 
Kopenigh.
 Up∣on the news of which sudden Progress, the Electour of 
Brandenburg
 justly fearing the 
Swedes,
 if not timely and vigorously opposed, might push their successes much further, and at length strip him of all his Dominions, went in all haste to the 
Hague,
 where in the month of 
May,
 an Alliance was concluded between the King of 
Denmark,
 the Electour of 
Brandenburg,
 the Dukes of 
Brunswick,
 and 
Lunenburg,
 and the United Provinces, by which all those powers engaged themselves mutually to assist each other against the arms of 
France
 and 
Swedeland;
 and amongst other things it was stipula∣ted, that the States for their part, should Equip out 9 men of War to be sent into the 
Sound,
 into the Service of the Electour of 
Brandenburg.


On the 18th. of 
June
 following the States de∣clared open War against 
Swedeland,
 8 days after the 
Spaniards
 had publisht the like at 
Brussels.
 In the mean time, the 
Swedes
 taking advantage of the weakness of their Enemies, who expecting no∣thing less than to see a War kindled in the North, had left their Frontiers unprovided, entred into 
Havelland
 and seized upon the Towns of 
Nau∣wen, Brandenburg, Ravenau, Havelberg, &c.
 But the Electour of 
Brandenburg
 with a wonderfull diligence assembling his Forces, checkt his Ene∣mies in their full Career, and obliged them to

 quit 
Ravenau;
 and soon after engaging in a Bat∣tle with the 
Swedish
 Army, he defeated them, kil∣led them 2500 men, and forced them in fine to retire in Disorder into the Country of 
Meck∣lenburg.


The King of 
Denmark
 likewise at the same time Declared War against the 
Swedes,
 and thereupon immediately sent his Fleet after its Junction with the Ships of the 
Hollanders Quota,
 into the 
Bal∣tick,
 to cruize upon the Coasts of 
Pomerania;
 and drew up his Land-Army at 
Gadebusch,
 where the Elector of 
Brandenburg
 met him; and those two Princes having held a Council of War toge∣ther, to Consult upon what enterprizes they might most advantageously employ their Troops, after that, the King of 
Denmark
 advanced to 
Wismar,
 where he left 6 Regiments to block up that place, and then marcht away with the main of his Ar∣my towards 
Damgarten
 in 
Pomerania;
 on the o∣ther side, the Troops of 
Munster
 and 
Brandenburg
 entred the Country of 
Bremen,
 and General 
Swe∣rin
 with a body of 3000 
Brandenburgers
 seized the Isle of 
Wollyn,; Damgarten
 was also reduced under the obedience of the 
Danes,
 and a little while after 
Wismar
 also surrendred to the King of 
Denmark,
 who besieged it in person.


During these transactions, the young K. of 
Swede∣land
 after the Ceremony of his Coronation which had been lately performed at 
Ʋpsal,
 employed his utmost care and efforts for the fitting out a po∣werfull Fleet, with a Resolution to make some attempt upon the Isle of 
Zealand,
 but that Fleet was no sooner got to Sea, but it was so roughly handled by a horrible and sudden Tempest, that after the loss of several Ships, it was forced to re∣turn into Port. The 
Danish
 Fleet under the Com∣mand of Admiral 
Adelaar,
 after having a long time but in vain, waited for that of 
Swedeland,
 received orders likewise to return home; and so end∣ed the year 1675.




 
 The 
Swedish
 Armies were nothing more fortunate the following Campaign than they had been in the last. For being attackt almost on all sides at the same time, they had the displeasure to see those Enemies they had so rashly raised against themselves, make themselves Masters of a conside∣rable part of their Territories, and bid fair to carry all the rest. 'Tis true indeed, the 
Swedes
 seized upon 
Swingerschans
 in the month of 
Janua∣ry,
 and defeated the 
Munsterian
 Troops in the Dutchy of 
Bremen,
 but those happy beginnings were followed by perpetual losses one after the o∣ther; and so as they were the first that begun the War on that side, they were likewise the first that felt the disastrous effects of it, and that Re∣pented they had so unadvisedly engaged in it upon the delusive suggestions of a false and self-ended Allie.


Fortune which had followed the Arms of the Allies in all the attempts they had hitherto made by Land upon the 
Swedish
 Dominions, Declared herself likewise in their favour at Sea. For at the very beginning of the year, the States Gene∣ral of the United Provinces had resolved joyntly with the King of 
Denmark,
 to send early in the Spring, a Fleet of 40 sail of men of War into the 
Sound, viz.
 25 
Danish,
 and 15 
Dutch
 Ships, of which 
Tromp
 was to be the Commander in chief: And accordingly they ordered all imagi∣nable diligence to be used in fitting out that Fleet; which being effected, 
Tromp
 sailed out of the 
Texel
 on the 11th. of 
May,
 with the Ships designed for the North with which join∣ed several Merchant Ships, and on the 12th. he arrived in the Road of 
Copenhagen
 where the King of 
Denmark,
 in consideration of his Tran∣scendant worth, and high Reputation, was plea∣sed to honour him with the honour of Knight∣hood of the Order of the 
Elephant.




In the mean while, Admiral 
Niels Juel
 being entred the month before into the 
Baltick
 Sea with a Squadron of 12 men of War, and a Reinforce∣ment of 8 more, seized upon the Isle of 
Gothland.
 After which expedition, he received a further Re∣inforcement of 6 men of War 
Danish
 and 
Dutch;
 so that he had then a Fleet of 26 Capital men of War with which he cruized in the 
Baltick.
 At the beginning of 
June
 he descried the 
Swedish
 Fleet consisting of 44 men of War besides Ten∣ders, and small craft; and on the 4th of the same month at 6 in the evening the two Fleets en∣gaged between 
Schoonen,
 and 
Bornholm;
 and tho' the 
Swedes
 were superiour to the 
Danes
 in Number of Ships and men, yet they never durst attempt to board any of them, but con∣tented themselves only with firing at them at a respectfull distance. The 
Danes
 charged the E∣nemies Fleet with a great deal of Courage, and cut off 5 
Swedish
 ships from the main body of their Fleet; But a calm coming on, they could not possi∣bly pursue them, so that they were forced to con∣tent themselves only with plying them with con∣tinual Broadsides of their Guns, till night par∣ted the Fray for that day. The next day about 6 in the morning, the two Fleets prepared again for a second Battle.


The 
Swedes
 having the Weather-gage,
 advanced in good order against the 
Danish
 Fleet, and did their best to hinder them from gaining that ad∣vantage from them, so that the 
Danes
 were for∣ced to begin the attack, and the fight was very bloody. But when the 
Swedes
 found there was little appearance of getting the better of the 
Danes,
 they begun to recoil, which was the cause, that neither of the two Fleets were much dama∣ged. The 
Danes
 flattered themselves with the hopes of burning the 
Swedish
 Admiral with a fire-ship they let drive against one of her sides, un∣der the covert of a thick smoke; But the 
Swede


 fired so hotly upon the Fire-Ship with his Guns that he thereby saved himself from the flames, and then in his turn, fell fiercely upon the 
Danish
 Admiral, who made so vigorous a resistance, that the Admiral of 
Swedeland
 was glad to let him a∣lone and to retire with his Fleet near 
Bleking.
 The 
Danes
 having no express order to hazard a∣ny thing, because they were inferiour in Force to the 
Swedes,
 retired likewise, so that the fight ended before 10 in the morning, without any advantage to either of the parties worth brag∣ing of, saving only that the 
Danes
 took one of the Enemies Galliots carrying 10 Guns and 30 men, without losing any thing on their side.


The News of that fight being come to 
Copen∣hagen, Tromp
 sailed immediately with a Reinforce∣ment of 4 
Danish
 and 3 
Dutch
 Ships, and speedi∣ly arrived in the 
Danish
 Fleet. The next day after his coming he disposed all things for a third Battle which was fought on the 11th of the same month, and was incomparably more furious and bloody than the two preceeding ones; of which what the issue was may be seen by the fol∣lowing Letter written on that Subject, by Ad∣miral 
Tromp
 to the States.




High and Mighty Lords,


SInce my last of the 5th of this month, which I gave my self the honour to write to your High and Mightinesses, we had the happiness to sail out of this Road, favoured with a fresh Gale; and on the 7th we arrived at the Fleet which lay at Anchor between 
Stede
 and 
Valsterbon.
 On the 8th. the Wind East-South-East, we weigh'd Anchor, with the whole Fleet, and steer'd away to the Southward, continuing our Course till night came on, when we cast An∣chor at South-West and a quarter West of 
Stede.
 On the 9th. at break of day, with a South-West Wind, and after we were past 
Valsterbon,
 we disco∣vered

 the Enemies Fleet being about 50 sail strong, great and small, according to the report of our advanced guards. And because in the after∣noon the wind grew higher, and the Enemies had the advantage of it, they made use of it to slide away from us, so that we had much ado to follow them. The night following, we pursued them with full sail, but then changing their Course they stole out of our sight by favour of the darkness; which obliged us to send a de∣tachment of 7 light Frigats to go and hunt them out, and get some new discoveries of them. A∣bout noon, we descried them to the South-East-ward of our Fleet, upon which we presently gave the signal to all the Fleet to make all the sail they could to get up with them, and we followed them till the dusk of night. On the 11th of 
June
 before noon, we discovered them again to the South-ward of 
Oeland,
 and at 11 a Clock we got up so nigh to them, that they were forced to cast themselves into a line of Battle. About noon the wind was West-North-West, and we had the Weather-gage; and then the two Fleets engaged: And no sooner was the fight begun, but the Ship called the 
Three Crowns
 carrying 134 Guns, and Commanded by the 
Swedish
 Admiral, was overset, and blown up into the air in a little time after, by I know not what accident, since I had given her but very few broadsides. At that, all the whole Enemies Fleet made as if they would fly. I present∣ly gave the signal for attacking them on all sides, and falling upon them with our whole Fleet, which motion made them stop short, we then tackt to the South-ward, and I drew near them, and flankt the Enemies Admi∣ral's Ship that was the chief of a Squadron, car∣rying 96 Guns. I vigorously charged both that and the other Ships that seconded her. And af∣ter we had fired at one another reciprocally a∣bout

 an hour and an half, the 
Swedish
 Admi∣rals main-mast was at last shot down, and I forced him to strike his Flag, and to beg Quar∣ter, which I granted him because of his vigorous resistance, and the bravery he had shewed, and I sent my boat to fetch him off, but it was too late; For one of our Fire-Ships having grapled his Ship, not considering he had struck his Flag, and that I had given no signal at all for any to board her, she was burnt to Ashes; so that that fine Ship perisht with all her men, which were to the Number of 650 Seamen, excepting only 50 which were saved by a Boat, amongst whom was a Priest. That hapned about 6 in the af∣ternoon. The Enemies Fleet, after the fatal loss of two Admirals, seeing that Fortune fa∣voured us, and that the wavering Victory was ready to declare it self for the 
Danish
 Fleet, thought it time to make away into the Main Sea, so that all the Ships which composed it, confusedly betook themselves to flight, and stole away by the help of their sails from the pursuit of the Victours. They left behind them the 
Neptune,
 of 44 Guns, and 198 men, which was taken by Captain 
Van Zyl.
 There was like∣wise another taken as considerable as that. The Enemies did all they possibly could two several times to burn me, but their Fire-Ships were al∣ways Repulsed. Besides, 'tis a surprizing thing, and that proves, that Justice and the blessing of God follows the arms of all the Allies, that they lost not one Ship in so memorable an Action, and are hardly at all endamaged: The greatest da∣mages my Ship has suffered, consists in Sails and Rigging, and some shot received between wind and water. My first Captain, 
Ad an Akker∣stoot
 died in the bed of honour, and my second Captain, 
Teunisz Van Anten
 had his right arm shot off whilst he was signalizing himself. The Captain that Commanded the Land Troops

 has likewise lost an eye, and as to my men, I have had 100 killed and wounded. We have been in chace of the Enemies ever since the day before Yesterday, endeavouring to make the best advantage we can of their defeat. The day be∣fore Yesterday in the morning we saw one of their Ships stranded, and towards evening another of their biggest were staved against the Rocks of 
Westerwyk.
 We took from them a Frigat of 16, and a Yacht of 6 Guns. But I know not what passed in the Squadron of Admiral 
Niels Juel,
 of whom we have heard nothing since the Fight. Since the shattered remainder of the Enemies Fleet is retired into the first Ports they could find, to avoid our pursuit, and that not any of their Ships appear any longer at Sea, we have resolved to go to 
Stede,
 or 
Bogt Van Kuik,
 to confer with his 
Danish
 Majesty, and to take the orders that shall be judged agreeable to the present State of affairs. I pray God to be pleased more and more to bless your High and Mightinesses Government, and to Render your arms every where Triumphant.




The losses the 
Swedes
 suffered in that Battle amounted to 10 capital men of War, amongst which were 2 Admirals, 1 Frigat and 1 Yacht, be∣sides a great Number of men killed and wounded. It will be impertinent to relate here what caused the destruction of the first Admiral's Ship that pas∣sed for one of the finest that ever appeared yet in the Northern Seas. It carried 134 Brass Guns, and 1100 men. At the approach of the Allies Fleet, Admiral 
Kruits
 who was in her, Com∣manded the Guns to be placed on one side in their Carriages that he might be ready to fire a whole broadside; after which the gunners were ordered to pass to the other side, which they did; but they having forgot to make the Guns fast, the Ship turned on her other side, which made

 all the Guns flie out of their Port-holes, and fall on the other side, and so overset the Ship. And that disaster was soon followed with a greater, which was that the lighted matches fell into the Powder-Room, which some moments after blew up the Ship.


The 
Swedish
 Fleet having been chased almost as far as 
Stockholm
 by the 
Danes,
 Admiral 
Tromp
 sailed to the 
Sound
 with his Squadron, and came to an Anchour at 
Kongerbotcht.
 Great rejoycings were made at 
Copenhagen
 for the Victory lately obtained over the 
Swedes;
 after which the King of 
Denmark
 was resolved to push his Conquests still further. And for that effect sent Orders to Admiral 
Tromp
 to come with the Confederate Fleet to 
Vistad,
 to endeavour, if it were possi∣ble, to make a descent on that side, in 
Schonen,
 whilst he on the other, should enter it with his Land-Army. Admiral 
Tromp
 punctually executed those orders, by coming with all speed before that Harbour; where being arrived, he sent a Trumpeter in a Boat, to summon the Governour to surrender the place. But Mr. 
Veersen
 who Commanded there, made answer to 
Tromp,
 that the guard of that place was as much entrusted to him, as the Conduct of the Fleet was to 
Tromp,
 and that consequently he was resolved to defend it like a brave Soldier against all that should attack it.


After that answer, 
Tromp
 sent a detachment of 4 Frigats, and 3 Galliots, to advance near the Town, and to Cannonade it; but by reason of a Calm coming on, it was impossible for him to execute any thing that day, but he was forced to stay till the next day, when the Frigats approaching within Musket shot of the Ramparts begun to play, at them with their Guns. In the afternoon 
Tromp
 reinforced them with 4 frigats more, and they fired so furiously with all their Guns at the Ramparts, that no body durst appear any more upon them. After which a body of 3000 Seamen and Soldiers were Commanded to make a descent

 on both sides of the Town. The Burghers did all they could, to oppose them with a body of 700 Horse, and 150 Foot. But as soon as the 
Danes
 had Landed under shelter of the Great Guns that so hotly fired against all the shore, the 
Swedes
 were forced to retire with the loss of 151 men killed or wounded, and the 
Danes
 advanced near the Town.


About 6 at night, the Admiral ordered the Troops to be in readiness to attack the Town on both sides as soon as ever he should give the signal for it, but first he thought fit to Summon the Go∣vernour once more to surrender it; and the in∣habitants begun to shew themselves, and reported, that the 
Swedes
 had quitted it, but that they had min'd it before their Retreat. The 
Danes
 thereupon presently seized it, cleared it of the Mines, and refortified it with a Resolution to maintain it, and defend it stoutly in case the 
Swedes
 should return with an Army to attack them, and for that end, they drew out of the Fleet such a proportion of Guns and Ammunition as was thought necessary, and carried into the Town.


The King of 
Denmark
 having embarkt his Army consisting of 18000 Men, Horse and Foot, unmoor'd the 8th of 
July
 with a Fleet of 500 Ships, and came to an Anchor the next day before 
Raa
 up∣on the Coast of 
Schonen
 between 
Helsingburg
 and 
Landskroon,
 accompanied by the Prince his Bro∣ther, and the Generals of his Army. And up∣on advice that the 
Swedish
 Army was marched towards 
V
stad,
 he Cammanded his Army to make a descent and to Land all the Artillery, and all the Warlike Engines that followed them, and sent presently a detachment of some Regim
nts, to in∣vest 
Helsingburg,
 and besiege it. That place was reduced to his obedience without much resistance. But the Garrison retiring into the Castle defended themselves there for a while very stoutly; however, at length seeing there was but small hopes of any suc∣cour,

 they yielded at discretion on the 14th of the month.


The King of 
Denmark
 observing that the 
Swe∣dish
 King, tho' he was in Person at the head of his Army, was not in a condition to oppose his Ravages, and to oblige 
Tromp
 to quit 
Vistad,
 but that he was so far from that, as to be re∣tired to 
Christianstadt,
 resolved to pursue his Conquests still further, and so taking advantage of the opportunity fortune presented him, he de∣campt on the 15th with his Army from 
Helsing∣burg,
 and march'd directly to 
Landskroon,
 which he caused to be attackt with sword in hand, and reduced it. But the 
Danes
 with all the diligence they could use, were not able to prevent the 
Swedes
 from retiring into the Castle which was extreamly strong both by Situation and the Art∣full works about it. They defended themselves there like brave Soldiers, but were at last con∣strained to yield. On the next day being the 18th. his 
Danish
 Majesty marcht his Army to 
Chri∣stianstadt
 and summoned it to surrender, and up∣on refusal, took it by force of Arms. The 
Danish
 Arms made likewise a great progress in 
Norway
 and Victory followed them every where: For the For∣tress of 
Wennersburg
 was taken there by the Sieur 
de Guldenlieu,
 and a part of the Country of 
Daals∣land
 and of 
Westergothland
 was likewise put un∣der Contribution, 
&c.


Some time before, the 
Swedes
 had demolished the Fortress of 
Christianople.
 The King of 
Den∣mark
 considering, that place was of great impor∣tance to him, sent order to Admiral 
Tromp
 to go before it with the Fleet; 
Tromp
 accordingly arrived there on the 15th of 
September,
 and took it presently, repar'd the fortifications of it, and made it stronger than ever it had been before.


On another side, the Arms of the Elector of 
Brandenburg
 were no less Triumphant than those of the 
Danes.
 For he entred 
Pomerania


 with his Army, towards the end of 
June,
 with a Resolution to force the 
Swedes
 to raise the sieg of the Fort of 
Wolgast
 which was extremee hardly pressed by them. And being so successfull at the very first to make himself Master of the Fortress of 
Tribsee,
 he thereby broke the designs of the 
Swedes.
 The Fort 
Pennemunder
 was ta∣ken soon after, as likewise were the important For∣tresses of 
Staden
 and 
Anklam,
 the Pass of 
Lokkowits
 the Town of 
Demin, &c.
 After all these Expe∣ditions, the 
Dutch
 Fleet retired, and that of 
Den∣mark
 went to 
Copenhagen,
 where it was disarmed, excepting two Squadrons under the Command of the Admirals 
Bielke
 and 
Rotsteyn,
 who had or∣ders to cruize about in the 
Baltick
 Sea. Admi∣ral 
Jens Rotsteyn
 advancing with his Squadron to 
Karelshaven
 besieged by the 
Danes,
 Landed there some Guns and some Troops, to help to straiten the place the more, and to force it to surren∣der.


The 
Danish
 Admiral 
Wibe,
 who was substitu∣ted in the place of 
Marcus Rotsteyn,
 who was accused not to have done his duty before 
Gotten∣burg,
 undertook at the same time to burn the 
Swedish
 men of War that were at Anchor before 
Elsburg;
 but he succeeded not; however the 
Swe∣dish
 Admiral fled, to avoid the danger, and a∣nother ship whose head was shot off, sunk. The Vice Admirals ship had the same misfortune as the ther, the Ship called 
Kalmerstet
 lay drie for 3 days together, and a small Vessel, and a 
Swedish
 Fire-ship perisht likewise by the flames. The 
Swedes
 upon that attempt retired up nearer to 
Elsburg
 to Repare all their damages.


The King of 
Swedeland
 seeing there was no other means to put a stop to the conquest of the 
Danes,
 but by venturing a Battle, after he had received a Reinforcement of 5000 
Finlan∣ders
 and some of the Country Militia, took a Resolution to march in person towards the Ene∣mies

 with an Army of 18000 men. He ac∣cordingly marched to 
Helsingburg
 which he took without much resistance. The 
Danes
 were reti∣red into the Fort, and the King of 
Sweden
 flat∣tered himself with the hopes of forcing them to surrender, but they made so vigorous a resistance that he was forced to retire with loss. The King of 
Denmark
 hearing the King of 
Swedeland
 was upon his march, went and posted himself between 
Landskroon
 and 
Helsingburg,
 for fear otherwise if he should not cut of his passage, he should enter fur∣ther into the Country. The two Armies there∣fore by that means came and remained in sight of each other, each of them having their King at their head, and being separated from one ano∣ther only by a River. And a great frost coming on, the River that parted them was frozen, which gave occasion to a bloody battle that was fought the 14th of 
December,
 where the Courage of two great Princes shone forth in all the Acts of Va∣lour and Conduct, whilst each of them emu∣lously strove to out-do the other, exposing themselves to danger as much as the meanest of their Soldiers. The advantages in that fight were so equally poized, that both parties pretended to the Victory; In fine the Battle was so bloody and obstinate, that there were left on both sides above 9000 men dead in the field. The King of 
enmark
 considering the Important Services done him by Admiral 
Tromp,
 and the Glory he had Acquired in all the expeditions undertaken under his Auspicious Conduct, was pleased after he had Knighted him to honour him further with the quality of a Count, to express to him the great esteem he had for his Person, and thereby to link him the more firmly to his interests.


The Rigors of Winter which make themselves to be very sensibly felt towards the North, yet were not able to hinder the attempts those Kings continued to make, to get an advantage one o∣ver

 the other. 
 The 
Swedes
 who kept the field of Battle in the last action, tho' the Victory were contested them by the 
a
es,
 were minded to shew their Enemies, that it was not without justice, they claimed it; and for that purpose the King of 
Swedeland
 marcht with his 
rmy to 
Helsing∣burg
 to besiege it, and in effect forced it to sur∣render on the 9th of 
January.
 That unexpected expedition, and the fortunate successes that at∣tended it, fired the 
Danes
 with an Emulous Rage, and put them upon taking measures to stop the further progress of their Enemies; and their apprehension was so much the greater, because the Sea that parts 
Schonen
 from 
Zealand
 was frozen up by the hard weather that had conti∣nued ever since the beginning of 
February.


The King of 
Denmark
 considering, there was nothing could keep up the Reputation of his Arms better than a potent Fleet that might make him Master of the Northern Seas, thought fit to re∣new his instances to the States-General, to in∣duce them to send another considerable Reinforce∣ment of men of War again into the 
Baltick
 at the opening of the next Campaign; and the bet∣ter to succeed in what he proposed, he prayed 
Tromp
 to be pleased to go to 
Holland,
 and to make the demand for him in person to the States, as hoping he would more easily obtain it than another. 
Tromp
 therefore departed from 
Copen∣h
en
 on the 19th of 
February,
 but the Tem∣pests he met with by the way, were the cause that he arrived not at the 
Hague,
 till the 20th of 
March.


At that time the Prince of 
Orange
 marcht at the head of the Army to the Relief of St. 
Omers. Tromp
 followed his Highness in that expedetion, and news coming that Admiral 
Michael de Rui∣ter
 died on the 29th. of 
April
 the last year be∣ing 1676, of the wound in the Sea-fight he had with the 
French
 before 
Palermo
 in 
Sicily,
 and

 there being no man Judged more capable worthily to supply his place than 
Tromp,
 it was according∣ly conferred upon him about the latter end of 
March,
 and he was created Lieutenant Admiral General of the United Provinces, with permis∣sion however from the States, to continue during that one Campaign more in the King of 
Den∣mark
's Service. In the beginning of 
May,
 he was received in that quality in all the Colle∣ges of the several Admiralties, who all did him great honours.


The States having deliberated upon what was to be done in marine affairs, concluded at length to fit out 15 men of War to be sent to the as∣sistance of the King of 
Denmark,
 and named the General Officers to Command that Squadron, which were, 
William Bastiaansz
 as Admiral 
John Van Nes
 as Vice Admiral, and 
Philip Allemonde
 as Rear Admiral. They set sail on the 29th of 
June
 with Lieutenant Admiral General 
Tromp,
 and made the best of their way for 
Denmark.


In the mean while, the 
Swedes
 seized upon 
Karelshaven,
 and marcht to 
Christianstadt.
 The King thereupon without any hesitation, resolved to go in person into 
Schonen.
 His arrival broke the designs of the 
Swedes
 who went and posted themselves near 
Landskroon
 without daring to ha∣zard a Battle which the King of 
Denmark
 pre∣sented them. At Sea the 
Danish
 arms were Tri∣umphant; for upon Advice, that the 
Swedish
 Ad∣miral 
Erick Zeeklad
 was sailed out of 
Gottemburg
 with a Squadron of 9 men of War, 2 Advice-Yachts, 3 Fire-Ships, and 4 other Vessels, in or∣der to pass the 
Belt,
 and joyn the main Body of the 
Swedish
 Fleet that was hourly expected, Ad∣miral 
Niels Juel
 went out of 
Copenhagen
 on the 2d of 
June,
 to search after them, and if possible to hinder their junction, the winds that were con∣trary to the 
Swedes
 and hindred them from passing the 
Belt
 favoured his attempt, so that according

 to his wish he attackt them at 
Rostock
 with a Squadron of 11 men of War.


After two hours fight the 
Swedish
 Admiral, who was in a ship carrying 60 Guns and 300 men, was for∣ced to strike his Flag, and to yield at discretion. And the 
Danish
 Admirals second took the Ship called the 
Angel Gabriel
 carrying 50 Guns, and 260 men. The 
Danish
 Vice Admiral took the ship called 
Kalmar Kasteel
 carrying 74 Guns, and 400 men. Captain 
Dreyer
 took the 
Wrangle Paleis
 of 44 Guns, and 300 men, and Captain 
de Wit
 took the 
Meerman
 of 46 Guns and 300 men. One of their Fire Ships was burnt, and 2 of their Advice Yachts, were taken; so that of the whole 
Swedish
 Squadron, there were but very few ships escaped; whereas on the contrary, the 
Danes
 lost not one Ship, and they came off only with the loss of 70 or 80 men killed amongst which there was not one person of note.


Those happy Progresses animated the 
Danish
 K. to attempt the Conquest of some important Place; for which end he march'd his Army to 
Malmuyen,
 of which depends all the Country of 
Schonen,
 in order to besiege it.
 The 
Danish
 Army came before that Place on the 19th of 
June,
 but found there so vigorous a Resistance that they were forced to quit it on the 7th of 
July
 following. On the 11th of 
July
 the 
Swedish
 Fleet being 40 Sail strong, got to Sea, and in the Morning advanced with a favourable Wind directly to the 
Danish
 Fleet, which was much inferior to them in Force, and attack'd them vigo∣rously. The 
Danes,
 at their Approach, got into Order of Battle, and shewed a great deal of Cou∣rage and Resolution. Admiral 
Mark Rotsteyn
 had the Van, Admiral 
Juel
 commanded the main Battle, and Admiral 
Jens Rotsteyn
 the Rear. At the first Motion made by the two Fleets, the 
Swedes
 fell up∣on the 
Danes
 with a great deal of Bravery; but in the sequel of the Fight, the 
Danes
 soon shewed them, That they had more Experience than they in

 Sea-actions, and were more skilful in making their Motions, for having in a trice gotten from them the Weather-gage,
 they cut the 
Swedish
 Fleet in two. Admiral 
Juel
 signalized himself most notably, and valiantly bore the Shock of 6 of the Enemies Ships, in which Fray his Ship called 
Christian the first
 was so battered and disabled that he was forced to quit her, and go on Board another, called 
Fre∣derick the third.
 In the mean while the main Body of the 
Sweedish
 Fleet was put to so great a Rout, that they quitted the Fight, and left to the 
Danes
 a glorious Victory, and a great many of their Ships. For Vice-Admiral 
Bielke
 took the 
Mars,
 carrying 72 Guns; Rear-Admiral 
Floris Karstensz
 took the 
Julius Caesar
 of 60 Guns; Captain 
Van Vacht
 took the 
Flying Wolf
 of 56 Guns; Captain 
Dreyer
 took the 
Swedish Lion
 of 52 Guns. The 
Dragon,
 carry∣ing 64 Guns, was stranded; the 
Saturn
 was burnt; and the 
Jupiter,
 carrying 60 Guns, was sunk, 
&c.


Towards the End of that famous Fight, the Auxi∣liary Squadrons sent by the States to the Aid of the K. of 
Denmark
 appeared towards the 
Sound,
 under the Conduct of Lieutenant Admiral 
William Bastia∣ansz;
 and came very opportunely to help to com∣pleat the Ruine of the shattered Relicks of the 
Swe∣dish
 Fleet, for they cut off the Passage of 
Gotten∣burg
 from 3 of their Ships, that were retired near 
Malmuyen.
 Admiral 
Tromp,
 upon his Arrival, went immediately to 
Copenhagen,
 at whose Return a Council of War being held, it was resolved to send a Detachment to attack the said 
Swedish
 Ves∣sels, which carried each of them 70 Guns. And that Action was performed in the Sight of the King of 
Denmark.
 The Captains 
Tyloor
 and 
de Bois,
 that were commanded out upon that Exploit, got a great deal of Honour by it. The first of them advanced, and thrusting himself between two of those Ships, fired at both of them so terribly with his Guns that one of them sunk, and the other yielded; and the third was burnt by a 
Dutch
 Fire-ship.

 In a Word, the whole 
Swedish
 Fleet was re∣duced into a most pitiful Condition, and several of their General Officers fell into the Hands of the Victors.


That was the second Victory the 
Danes
 had gain∣ed over the 
Swedes
 by Sea that Year. A little while after their two Land-Armies likewise engaged again in a cruel Battle, which was fought on the 24th of 
Ju∣ly
 pretty near 
Landskroon.
 The 2 Kings of the 
North
 were both there likewise in Person again, each of them at the Head of his Army, and both Parties being encouraged by their Presence, fought with so much Valour and desperate Obstinacy, that it could not well be known to whom the Victory was due. That Battle cost both Parties the loss of 5000 Men that were left dead upon the Spot. After the Fight, the 
Swedes
 again kept the Field of Battle, and the 
Danes
 retired to 
Landskroon,
 to repare their Losses.


The Count 
de Guldenlieu,
 Governour or Vice-Roy of 
Norway,
 formed an Enterprize upon the important Place of 
Marstrand,
 where is a very commodious Port, in which a great Number of Ships may safely ride in any Weather. The Town stands in an Island of the same Name, which is en∣vironed on all sides with Rocks. There are in it two other considerable Places besides, 
viz. Karel∣stein
 and 
Gustaafsburg.
 This 
Marstrand
 then was attacked by the 
Danes
 on the 18th of 
July,
 with about 1600 Men, and after 2 Hours Assault was taken, the 
Swedes
 quitting it, after they had nail'd up the Cannon. They also set Fire to 
Gustaafs∣burg,
 and retired to 
Karelstein,
 to which last Place the 
Danes,
 after the taking of 
Marstrand,
 marched likewise: The 
Swedes
 that guarded it made a vigorous Resistance for a time, but at last were forced to surrender it on the 3d of 
August. Jem∣pterland,
 which had formerly been subject to the 
Danes,
 surrendred likewise to them, towards the l
tter end of the Month. All those happy Successes

 on the 
Danes
 side were followed by another bloody Battle fought between the two Armies, in which the 
Danes
 had the better, the 
Swedes
 leaving behind them about 1400 men Dead on the Spot.


After the last Sea-fight, in which the 
Danes
 had had the Victory, their Fleet being reinforced with a Squadron of 9 
Dutch
 Men of War, under the Command of Lieutenant Admiral 
William Bastia∣ansz,
 put to Sea again. Admiral 
Juel,
 who com∣manded it in chief, directed his Course towards the Country of 
Smaland,
 and the Isle of 
Enland,
 before which the Fleet anchored on the 11th of 
Au∣gust.
 Where being arrived, 2 Trumpeters were presently sent off, one to the Country of 
Smaland,
 and the other to the Isle of 
Enland,
 to summon the Inhabitants to come and agree with the 
Danes
 about Contributions; but they were so far from com∣plying with that Order, that they were so insolent as to abuse the Trumpeters, and sent them away very ill satisfied. 
Tromp
 who was on board the Ship called the 
Prince George,
 came to the fleet accompanied with Vice Admiral 
Bielke,
 and was so surprised at the strange answer and Treatment the Trumpeters met withal, as also at the order found on board the 
Swedish
 Ships there ta∣ken, importing that if they had had the Victory, they were to destroy all the Islands belonging to the King of 
Denmark
 with fire and sword, that he thought fit to send the Sieur 
Mullet
 with a detachment of 200 Soldiers and 100 Seamen, in∣to the Country of 
Smaland,
 and Vice Admiral 
Spaen
 with another party of men to the Isle of 
Enland,
 with orders to do all the mischief and spoil they possibly could there, till they had made the proud hearts of the inhabitants stoop to reason.


Those orders were followed with an effectual execution. For the Troops that entred 
Smaland
 burnt there some Lordships, some Villages, and the small Town of 
Munsternaar.
 Those sent in∣to

 the Isle of 
Enland
 put to the Sword 36 Pea∣sants they found in arms, burnt several Villages, and committed a thousand other spoils. Vice-Admiral 
Bielke
 advancing to the place where the 
Swedes
 used to build their Ships, set fire on all the materials serviceable either for building or rigging of ships; he likewise Commanded his men to pillage two Lordships and four Villages. In the mean while care was taken, to found the port of 
Kalmar,
 with a design to go in and attack the 
Swedish
 Ships there; but that was found impracticable because of several rocks there that lay conceal'd under water, and that the 
Swedes
 had likewise sunk several ships in the mouth of the Harbour to stop up its passage against any Enemy. All those obstacles made the 
Danes
 take a Resolution to attack the Enemies by Land. And accord∣ingly they begun with setting fire to a Country house about a Cannon shot off the Town of 
Kal∣mar.
 Those of the Town made what opposition they could against them by firing their great Guns at them, and sending some Troops against them, which the 
Danes
 beat back to the walls of the Town, and pursued so close, that 'tis certain if they had had men enough to have gone through with their attempt they might have entred the Town Pell-Mell with the Enemies, and have made themselves Masters of it, so great was the consternation they then were in; and besides the 
Danes
 having set fire to the Suburbs that consisted of 200 Houses, and 11 Mills, they might well enough have advanced into the Town, un∣der the covert of the thick smoak that arose from them.


On the 20th the Admirals 
Tromp
 and 
Juel
 took boat with 500 men, and advanced toward the Isle of 
Enland,
 with a Resolution to attack the Fort that stands there right against 
Kalmar,
 upon the Sea-shore, and which is flankt with 5 Regu∣lar Bastions. 
Tromp
 at his arrival sent a sum∣mons

 to the Governour to surrender, and upon his refusal, ordered his men to mount to the as∣sault. The Enemies seeing themselves fiercely attacked, made little resistance, but retired into a Wood that is by the side of the Fort, and so the 
Danes
 entred and took possession of it. That which made the 
Swedes
 defend themselves so ill, was partly their want of force, and partly their own Cowardice. For they hoped for some assist∣ance from 
Kalmar,
 which came not till after the taking of the Fort, and so they mist the benefit of it, because they had not the Courage or Patience to stay for it. Those succours being ignorant of the taking of the Fort, 
Tromp
 hastily Reimbarkt his Troops in the boats in order to go and meet them; but the 
Swedes
 seeing they were like to be attackt by the 
Danes
 thought it better to re∣turn back from whence they came, than to ex∣pose themselves to be beaten. However both parties in retiring fired several vollies of small shot one at the other, but without doing much harm excepting only to Vice-Admiral 
Spaen
 who unfortunately lost an eye. The Fort of 
Borch∣holm
 of which depended the preservation of the Isle of 
Enland,
 had in it a strong Garrison of 1200 men, and therefore the 
Danes
 thought not fit to attack it, but contented themselves with pillaging and spoiling the flat Country, from whence they carried off near 2000 head of great and small Cattle, which were sent to the Fleet.


And since fortune smiled so upon the 
Danes,
 and their Arms were every where Triumphant, the King of 
Denmark
 would not be content with the depredations his Troops committed in the E∣nemies Country, but would needs form a further and more important Enterprize upon the Isle of 
Rugen:
 For which effect, he sent for some thou∣sands of men of his Troops from 
Schonen,
 and sent orders to Admiral 
Tromp,
 and Lieutenant Admiral 
William Bastiaansz,
 to come to

 
Copenhagen
 with their Squadron; Admiral 
Mark Rotstein
 received the same order, and to bring with him a detachment of the biggest Ships of the 
Danish
 Fleet. On the 5th of 
September
 they parted from Admiral 
Juel,
 who seeing there was nothing more to do at 
Kalmar,
 nor in the Isle of 
Enland,
 weighed Anchor the next day, and passing by the Country of 
Smaland,
 he ravaged the Isles of 
Ʋkno,
 and 
Runo,
 where he put several of the inhabitants to the sword that attempted to make resistance. After that expedition, he went and attackt 24 of the King of 
Sweden
's Magazines near 
Westerwyk.
 Captain 
Bovenfield
 with a party of 150 Seamen, was commanded to go and burn them, who at the same time set fire to two Lordships and three Villages that were higher up the Country, in spite of the oppositi∣on the 
Swedes
 made with a body of Peasants that were got together.


After that, a Resolution was taken to attack 
Westerwyk,
 and burn it, for which execution choice was made of some of the lightest Fri∣gats in the Fleet, with which were sent a detach∣ment of 500 Soldiers, and as many Seamen under the Command of General 
Mullet
 and of Rear-Admiral 
Florisz Karstensz.
 On the 10th. of 
Sep∣tember,
 they presented themselves at the mouth of the Haven of 
Westerwyk,
 where they lodged two Frigats which fired hotly at the Bastion of 
Sparosund,
 whilst on the other side, the Generals advanced with their Boats into the Port to view in what place they might best make a descent; and after they had past by several Islets, they attackt two Retrenchments, which they took. On the 11th. at break of day, they forced open the Barrier or Boom of the Haven, and sent in their Fire-Ships and their other small Ships.


About 7 a Clock the 
Danes
 presented them∣selves before the Town, which appeared to them in the form of a Half-Moon, being adorned with

 many fair Houses and Stately Turrets. From the Sea-ward Captain 
Dreyer
 fired upon it with his Guns, which the 
Swedes
 answered from a bat∣tery of 12 pieces of Cannon they had erected on the shore. When night came on the 
Swedes
 threw their Cannon into the water, and Quitted that Post, and afterwards the Town; upon which the 
Danes
 next morning seized both the Town and Fort. That place belonged to Count 
Ko∣ningsmark.
 The 
Danes
 reduced it all to ashes, not sparing so much as the ships that were in the Harbour. After that great Expedition, the Fleet weigh'd Anchor, and sailed for 
Gothland
 after they had put all the Country every where in a∣larm, and carried terrour even as far as 
Stockholm
 the Capital City of the Kingdom.


Admiral 
Tromp
 as we have said, had received order, to go to 
Copenhagen,
 where he arrived on the 10 of 
September,
 together with both the 
Dutch
 Squadron, and the 
Danish
 one that was detacht from the main Fleet.


All things being ready then for a great Expe∣dition the King of 
Denmark
 had resolved upon, his Majesty put himself at the head of the Fleet followed by 
Tromp,
 by the other General Officers of the Fleet, and by 4000 men, being Regular Troops which were embarkt with them. On the 13th. of the month, they weighed Anchor, and on the 16th they came in sight of the Isle of 
Rugen,
 and the next day the great ships Anchored at the point of 
Wittaw,
 whilst the Galliots and other smaller Ves∣sels were sent towards the shore, between the 
Peninsule,
 or half Island 
Wittaw,
 and 
Jasmund,
 where they Landed their Troops with such Ex∣pedition that about 4 in the afternoon the best part of both their Horse and Foot were already on shore. The Commander 
Keller
 at the head of 30 men, and a Major at the head of 15 
Germans
 advanced the foremost of all; at their approach a body of the Enemies Cavalry of 100 men fell

 upon them and charged them, but after two dis∣charges they were fain to flie, not being able a∣ny longer to stand against the fierce firing that was made at them from the ships. The 
Danes
 lost not one man in that Rencounter and pre∣sently discharged their Cannon and small Arms for Joy they had had the happiness to Land with∣out any obstacle.


The same evening, 50 
Danish
 Horse were de∣tacht away towards 
Wittaw
 and 
Jasmund;
 but they found no body there but some Peasants, and two Horsemen whom they brought Prisoners to the Army. On the 18th the King himself and Prince 
George
 himself came likewise to Land, and seve∣ral Gentlemen of the Country, yielded themselves and demanded Protections. Four days after his Majesty departed in order to return to 
Copen∣hagen
 leaving the Command of his Army in chief to Marshal 
Goltsz.
 Admiral 
Tromp
 departed likewise with the 
Danish
 Envoy Mr. 
Buckwald,
 and Mr. 
Brand
 the Resident of 
Brandenburg,
 to go to the Electour of 
Brandenburg,
 who was then em∣ployed in the Siege of 
Stetin.
 They arrived there on the 22d. Upon whose application the Gene∣rous Electour presently detacht away a Bo∣dy of Horse with orders to go to the Fort 
Pennemunder,
 to be ready at a Call to back the 
Danes
 in their enterprize upon the Isle of 
Rugen.
 And by that means, the 
Danes
 were so well Re∣inforced that Count 
Koningsmark
 that Comman∣ded the 
Swedish
 Troops in that Isle, found him∣self not in any condition to oppose their de∣predations, and much less to give them Battle. However to do what he could, he Commanded the Gentlemen of the Country and all the In∣habitants to come in and joyn him, but Marshal 
Goltz
 having publisht contrary orders, there were very few that ventured to pay obedience to Count 
Koningsmark.




Neither were the 
Danish
 Troops Reinforced only by the 
Brandenburgers,
 but the King of 
Denmark
 himself came and joyned them with a good Body of Horse, so that the Army then was 8000 strong. Count 
Koningsmark
 therefore finding his forces much inferiour to those of the 
Danes,
 thought it better to Quit the field, than stay to be beaten out of it; and therefore retired to 
Straelsund,
 carrying off with him all he possibly could. Thus the 
Danes
 became Masters of the whole Isle, excepting only the Old and New Fort, the first of which they took soon after, but the latter of them having received a Reinforcement of fresh Troops from 
Straelsund,
 stoutly with∣stood all their attacks, and were the cause after∣wards that they were forced to Quit all the Conquests they had made there. All those hap∣py successes the 
Danes
 had in the Isle of 
Rugen,
 were followed by the taking of the Town of 
Stetin,
 which after a long and bloody Siege yiel∣ded at last to the Electour of 
Brandenburg
 on the 26th. of 
December.


 
 Count 
Koningsmark
 being desperately enraged at the Progresses of the 
Danes
 in the Isle of 
Ru∣gen,
 was extreamly impatient to find an oppor∣tunity to deliver it from their depredations, and to restore it to its rightfull Prince; And for that effect, having with wonderfull celerity embarked his Infantry, he went and Landed with his Ca∣valry at the New Fort, which the more easily de∣ceived the 
Danes,
 because they thought nothing more impracticable or less to be feared than so speedy a return of the 
Swedes.
 At his arrival he assemb∣led all the Troops he had with him to the Num∣ber of 5000 fighting men, and on the 18th. of the month, went and encamped in the open field with a Resolution to give Battle to the 
Danes.
 Major General 
Rumor
 who succeeded in the place of Marshal 
Goltz
 who was recalled by Vertue

 of avocatory Letters from 
Poland,
 
 had then the Command in chief of the 
Danish
 Forces, and be∣ing not a man of spirit to suffer the Bravado's of Count 
Koningsmark,
 he also appeared in the field with an Army of 7000 fighting men, so that the two parties engaged in a Fight, which was fatal to the 
Danes.
 For Major General 
Rumor
 hap∣ning to be killed at the very first onset, his death was followed with the defeat of his Army, and the Officers chusing rather to die with their swords in their hands, than to Offer to turn their backs, the 
Dani
h
 Army was entirely routed, with the loss of 400 men killed, and about 5000 Priso∣ners of War, who might all have been cut in pieces if the Clemency of the Victors had not prevailed over the obstinacy of the vanquished. That signal Victory revived the drooping Cou∣rage of the 
Swedes,
 and Re-established their af∣fairs upon so good a Foot, that the losses and da∣mages either of the Parties had suffered by the other that Campaign, were thereby in some Fort counterballanced.


The King of 
Denmark
 seeing there was no hopes of drawing any succours for that years Campaign from the United Provinces, gave Admiral 
Tromp
 per∣mission to return home, and conferred the chief Command of his Fleet upon Admiral 
Niels Juel,
 making him Admiral General. Admiral 
Tromp
 therefore prepared to be gone; and then the Elector of 
Brandenburg
 taking a Resolution to carry his Arms once more into the Isle of 
Ru∣gen,
 and to make a Conquest of it, whatever it cost him, and thinking Admiral 
Tromp
 might be of great use to him in that design, desired him to be pleased to accompany him in that expedi∣tion. He therefore took leave of his Majesty, after having received a very rich present from him, and all imaginable marks of Friendship and Gratitude, and went to 
VVolgast,
 where the E∣lector of 
Brandenburg
 most kindly and nobly re∣ceived him.




The Enterprize of Re-entring into the Isle of 
Rugen
 being then projected, the 
Danish
 Fleet, un∣der the Command of Admiral 
Juel,
 had order to advance. On the 22d of 
September,
 Major Gene∣ral 
Lewenhelm,
 who Commanded the 
Danish
 Land-Forces, took post at 
Wittaw.
 The 
Swedes,
 to the Number of 1000 men, offering to oppose their de∣cent, were repulsed with loss. His Electoral High∣ness having embarkt his Troops at 
Pennermund,
 came himself on board, Commanded to weigh Anchor on the 22d, and made toward the Isle of 
Rugen
 with a Fleet of 210 Ships, and 140 Barks, or small Vessels proper for Landing the Troops in; and thus the Fleet advanced, being ranged in very good order of Battle.


Marshal 
Dorfling
 Commanded the Troops un∣der the Elector; 
Tromp,
 who engaged in that expedition as a Volunteer, had the Command of the Fleet, and went in the Ship called the 
E∣lectoral Prince.
 In the afternoon a Calm coming on, they were forced to cast Anchor very near the Isle. In the mean while the 
Swedes
 kept fi∣ring at the Fleet from a Battery of 10 great Guns and yet in all that time killed but 2 Persons, which is very remarkable. On the 23d at break of day, Admiral 
Juel
 having left his own Fleet, came on board the Elector, to inform him, that the 
Danes
 had taken post the day before near 
Wittaw.


Upon that advice, the Elector gave order to his people, to weigh Anchor, that he might not give time to Count 
Koningsmark
 to attack the 
Danes
 before their Junctions, with his Troops. About noon the Calm begun again, so that to make the more haste, they were forced to tow the men of War forward with boats: when they drew near the shore, the Troops made use of Pikes and Shovels instead of Oars, to get to Land with the more haste; Nay some of them jumpt into the Sea, up to the neck in water, and waded to

 shore, because they would be there the foremost and the first, to give proofs of their Bravery. At the approach of the 
Danes,
 the 
Swedish
 Horse shewed themselves on the high grounds, and Count 
Koningsmark
 caused some pieces of Cannon to be advanced, resolved to fire briskly from them upon the 
Brandenburgers
 before they should re∣cover the disorder their Landing would necessari∣ly put them in: But seeing them so nimbly get into Battle array, and that they had already got Cannon with them ashore, he ordered his men to quit the Post where they were placed; so that the Electors whole Army consisting of 4000 men, made a descent without any opposition from the 
Swedes,
 and without having above two men killed and one wounded.


Marshal 
Dorfling,
 as soon as he was Landed, took with him all the Horse that were yet dis∣embarkt, and fell to pursuing the 
Swedes,
 and 200 Horse of them having charged 8 Batalions of the Enemies, their consternation was so ex∣tream, that they turned tail soon after. There were taken that day about 200 Prisoners. Count 
Koningsmark
 seeing his affairs going down the Wind, was minded to use Circumspection, and thought it high time to rally together the Re∣licks of his dispersed and dispirited Forces, and accordingly he assembled them together in one bo∣dy, and advanced with them towards the old Fort, with design to pass from thence to 
Straelsund,
 in case of necessity. But in the mean while General 
Dorfling,
 who followed him close at the heels, marcht with that diligence, that the next day he 
epresented himself before that place. The 
Swedes
 were extreamly surprized to see him there; and because he observed they were busy in embark∣ing themselves to get away to 
Straelsund, Dor∣fling
 ordered a Body of 500 men, under the Com∣mand of Major General 
Schoning,
 to advance a∣long the shore side, and put himself at the head of

 them with his drawn sword in his hand, to charge them. And whilst they attackt the 
Swedes
 on one side, a part of their Cavalry lighted from their Horses, and attackt them on another, so that the place was taken by assault. A great Number of 
Swedes
 were put to the Sword in the first heat of the attack, and 900 Foot, and 500 Horse were made Prisoners.


Count 
Koningsmark,
 after he had signalized him∣self, and done as much as man could do, leapt in∣to a Boat, and got away from the Victors: pre∣sently after some Regiments were Commanded to go and attack the New Fort; but when the Cannon begun to batter the Ramparts, the Gar∣rison that were 
Germans
 mutinied, and forced their Officers to set open the Gates to the 
Bran∣denburgers.
 Such was the destiny of a Fortress which the 
Danes
 had not been able to take, and which yet surrendred at last without any resist∣ance to the Arms of the Elector of 
Brandenburg.
 The Isle of 
Danholm
 being afterwards attackt by 2000 men, submitted likewise to the obedi∣ence of the Trumphant Arms of the same E∣lector. All those happy successes were followed by the supplemental addition of the Town of 
Strael∣sund,
 where Count 
Koningsmark
 was retreated with the shattered relicks of his Army, which consisted of 1600 Horse and 600 Musketeers, which yet after noble and stout resistance, made by the valour and Conduct of the said Count, worthy to have served a more fortunate cause, was taken. This last Conquest was so much glo∣rious for the Arms of his Electoral Highness, be∣cause that place was counted one of the impor∣tant ones of all 
Germany.


Admiral 
Tromp,
 after he had assisted at all the Conquests in the North, where he acquired a very great Reputation, Returned at length into his own Country, Honoured with the Glorious Titles of Baron, Knight and Count, conferred upon him

 by two Great Kings, in admiration of his in∣comparable Merit.


The Place ensued soon after, and some Family considerations, besides some particular and pri∣vate Discontents, obliged him at length to quit the Sea and the publick Service till the Year 1691. And then a Mighty War arising between 
France
 and 
England,
 the United Provinces, and most of the Princes of 
Europe,
 he was lookt upon as the most capable person to Command the States Fleet, to maintain and support the Glory the 
Hollanders
 have acquired by Sea since the ap∣pearance of their Renowned Republick in the World.


And indeed the present King of 
England, Wil∣liam
 III. had named him to Command the States Fleet as Admiral General for the Year 1691, and the people began already to flatter themselves with a thousand happy successes from the Joy and Good-Will the Seamen unanimously testified on that oc∣casion; but the 
French,
 who are Ingenious in fore∣seeing, thought it was necessary to use all sorts of means to prevent so great an Evil as seemed to threaten them on that side: they lookt upon 
Tromp
 to be the only man that could Traverse their designs, and make head against their grow∣ing Power at Sea, the Empire of which they pretend now to dispute against both 
England
 and 
Holland:
 so that if we may credit what has been reported, the Treacherous Intrigues of that Nation contributed to cure themselves of the Umbrage and Apprehension they had conceived of that Great man, by procuring him an unnatural Di∣stemper to cut him off on a sudden. We will enter into no particulars about it; but 'tis too well known, that Court omits nothing to get the ablest Generals amongst their Enemies dispatcht out of the World by one means or other, when they prove deaf to their Charms, and incorruptible, and faithful to their Country.




However it were, the Incomparable 
Tromp
 fell sick, whilst the preparations for the Equipment of the Fleet were carrying on with all diligence. All 
Europe
 had then their Eyes turned that way, and begun already to Count upon a famous Sea-Battle, in which the 
Hollanders
 were to carry a∣way the Victory; and 
Tromp,
 whose good For∣tune had all along accompanied Bravery and Wise Conduct during his life, in all the Battles he e∣ver fought, was lookt upon as the happy man that was shortly to revenge his Country for the loss of the Battle under the less fortunate Conduct of Admiral 
Evertsz,
 by reason the 
English
 Ad∣miral failed in his duty; But alas, Death at length, with his malevolent Scyth, cut down in an instant all those blooming hopes, and deprived 
Holland
 and the Allies of an Admiral that was to have establisht Navigation in its ancient Li∣berty, and to have Triumph'd over the formidable 
French
 Fleets, if God had not been pleased to take him away in the Prime of his years.


He died at 
Amsterdam,
 after a long lingring sickness on the 29th of 
May,
 about 8 a clock in the morning, generally regretted by all the World. He was the Son of the valiant Admiral, 
Martin Harpertsz Tromp,
 and of 
Dinah de Haas,
 born at 
Rotterdam.
 He married 
Margaret de Rhaap∣horst,
 Widow to the late Mr. 
Helmont;
 by whom he had no Children. His Body was car∣ried on the 6th of 
June,
 between 9 and 10 at night, along the Lord's new Channel, to a place called 
Amstel,
 where it was put into a Yatcht in order to be Transported to 
Delft,
 and there in∣terr'd in the stately Tomb of his Illustrious Fa∣ther.


The Solemnity of his interrment was perform∣ed in the following manner. First, the Company of Major 
Witsen
 marcht at the head of the Con∣voy, followed by favour of the light of abundance of Torches, I. By the bearer of the two An∣chors

 placed 
Saltire
 wise; II. After him follow∣ed the Admiral-Flagg; III. The Generals Staff; IIII. The 4 Quarters of his Arms, and Representing the Alliance of his House; V. The 3 Casks; VI. The entire Coat of his Arms; VII. The Ha∣bit of Armour; VIII. The order of Knight of the 
Elephant,
 reposing upon a Pillow of Black Vel∣vet; IX. The Sword; X. The Spurs. XI. The Gant∣lets; XII. The 3 Standards; After which follow'd the Admiral's Corps cover'd with his Arms; The 4 Corners of the Pall being held up by 4 Marine Cap∣tains, 
viz.
 Mr. 
Hans Hartwich,
 Mr. 
Abraham Taal∣man, James Willemsz Broeder,
 and 
Roemer Ʋlak,
 After them marcht the Deceased's near Kindred, and afterwards the Burgermasters, the Sheriffs, and Councellors of the Town.


Such was the end of the incomparable 
Cornelius Tromp,
 whose memory will be dear in all Ages to come, to all the Lovers of Virtue and Valour, of both which he has left an August Example to his Nation after his Death.




FINIS.
