THE
PREFACE.


HEalth
 and 
Liberty
 are without dis∣pute
the greatest natural Blessings
Mankind is capable of enjoying; I
say natural, because the contrary states are
purely accidental, and arise from Nature
debauched, depraved or enforced. Yet
these Blessings are seldom sufficiently valu∣ed
whilst enjoy'd; like the daily advan∣tages
of the Sun and Air, they seem scarce
regarded because so common, by those that
are in possession of them.


But as an 
Italian
 that passes a Winter
in 
Groenland,
 will soon be convinc'd
through his want of the kind Influences of
that glorious Planet, how much Misery he
endures, in comparison of those who dwell
in his Native Country, so he that knows by

Experience
 the trouble of a languishing
Sickness, or the loss of his 
Liberty,
 will
presently begin to have a right esteem of
that which formerly he scarce thought
worth his notice.


This 
Experience
 is either what a Man


learns by that which befalls himself, or by
making Observations on the condition of
other People: The first is the common guide
to the generality of Mankind, who are not
apt to look beyond themselves, unless with
St. 
Thomas
 they feel as well as see, they
will not believe. Thus in the instance of
bodily 
Health,
 we find those that have been
always accustom'd to it, have scarce any
Notion of the Misery of the contrary state,
and therefore are careless in shunning those
Excesses which might bring Diseases upon
them; the sad Examples seen every day
of miserable sick 
Debauchées,
 being not suf∣ficient
to deter others from lewdness. But
the second sort of Experience is the In∣structress
of wise Men: For the Prudent
will not fail to benefit themselves by the
Accidents that befall others, both in their

Health
 and 
Liberty,
 by avoiding the oc∣casions
of them: And this is one of the
great Advantages of Society, that not only
the Assistance, but even the Misfortunes of
others, may be of use to us.


Want of 
Liberty
 is a Disease in any So∣ciety
or Body Politick, like want of 
Health

in a particular Person; and as the best
way to understand the nature of any Distem∣per
aright, is to consider it in several Pa∣tients,
since the same Disease may proceed


from different causes, so the disorders in
Society are best perceived by observing
the Nature and Effects of them in our se∣veral
Neighbours: Wherefore 
Travel

seems as necessary to one who desires to be
useful to his Country, as practising upon o∣ther
Mens Distempers is to make an able
Physician: For although a Man may see
too frequently the Misery of such as are de∣priv'd
of Health without quitting his own
Country, yet (thanks to Providence) he
must go out of these Kingdoms who would
know experimentally the want of 
Publick
Liberty.
 He that Travels into a Climate
infected with this Disease (and he can find
sew that are not) does not only see, but
in some measure feel the Grievances occa∣sioned
by it in the several Inconveniencies
of living, in some proportion with the Na∣tives;
so as to relish better upon his re∣turn
(which we suppose depends upon his
choice) the freedom and ease of his own
home Constitution; and may make good use
of this 
Experience
 without having paid too
dear for it: But a Man cannot transmi∣grate
himself for a while into a distem∣per'd
Body as he may Travel into an En∣slaved
Country, with equal facility of get∣ting
rid of each of them again.


Thus 'tis a great, yet rare advantage to
learn rightly how to prize 
Health
 without
the expence of being Sick, but one may ea∣sily
and cheaply grow sensible of the true
value of 
Liberty
 by Travelling into such
Countries for a Season as do not enjoy it.


And this can be done by no Nation in the
World so commodiously as the 
English:

The affluence of their Fortunes and Easi∣ness
in their private Affairs are evident∣ly
greater than those of other People of

Europe;
 so that generally speaking, none
are in a condition to spend more freely,
or may propose to reap greater benefit by

Travel,
 and yet none have practised it
less.


In other Countries some Princes and Men
of the first quality may have Purses strong
enough to bear the expence, but few of the
midling sort venture upon it; and those
are commonly either Military Men, who
have other designs in view than the know∣ledge
of the World; or the Unfortunate,
who chuse it as a diversion or a refuge,
and who have their Heads too full of their
own Miseries, to be at leisure to make their
Observations on others. And besides, we
often see the like Arbitrary Practices at
home (they having been always train'd up
in Servitude) does so far vitiate their


Reason, as to put them out of a capacity of
judging aright: for 'tis not only possible,
but very usual, that People may be so sea∣son'd
to and hardned in 
Slavery,
 as not
only to have lost the very Taste of 
Liberty,

but even to love the contrary State: as
Men over-run with the 
Spleen
 take plea∣sure
in their Distemper.


But in 
England
 there are very many
Gentlemen, whose Estates will afford them
either to travel in Person, or to send a∣broad
such of their Sons for four or five Years
as have the most solid Judgments, in which
time they may acquire such Manners, and
make such Observations as shall render them
useful to their Country; and thereby ad∣vance
their private Fortunes, more than
what is saved by keeping them at home
would amount to.


The Method which has been generally fol∣low'd
by us in sending young Gentlemen to
Travel can hardly answer any of these
ends: on the contrary it has hitherto been
so mischievous, that 'tis well travelling has
been so little in fashion. We send them
abroad Children, and bring them home
great Boys, and the returns they make
for the Expences laid out by their Parents,
are suitable to their Age: That of the Lan∣guages
is the very best, but the most com∣mon


is an affected Foppishness, or a filthy
Disease. for which they sometimes exchange
their Religion: Besides, the Pageantry,
Luxury, and Licentiousness of the more
Arbitrary Courts have bribed them into
an Opinion of that very Form of Govern∣ment:
Like 
Ideots,
 who part with their
Bread for a glittering piece of Tinsel, they
prefer gilded 
Slavery
 to coarse domestick

Liberty,
 and exclaim against their old fashi∣on'd
Country-men, who will not reform
their Constitution according to the new
foreign Mode. But the Travelling recom∣mended
here is that of 
Men,
 who set out
so well stock'd with the Knowledge of their
own Country, as to be able to compare it
with others, whereby they may both supply
it where they find it wanting, and set a
true value on't where it excels: with this
help such Travellers could not fail of be∣coming
serviceable to the Publick, in con∣tributing
daily towards the bettering of
our Constitution, though without doubt it
be already one of the best in the World.


For it were as fond to imagine we need
not go abroad, and learn of others, because
we have perhaps better Laws and Customs
already then Forreigners, as it were not to
Trade abroad, because we dwell in one of
the plentifullest Parts of the World. But


as our Merchants bring every day from
barren Countries many useful things, which
our own good one does not produce; so if
the same care were taken to supply us
with exact Accounts of the Constitutions,
Manners, and Condition of other Nations,
we might without doubt find out many
things for our purpose, which now our meer
Ignorance keeps us from being sensible that
we want. The 
Athenians, Spartans,
 and

Romans
 did not think themselves too wise
to follow this Method, they were at great
Expence to procure the Laws of other Na∣tions,
thereby to improve their own: and
we know they throve by it, since few Govern∣ments
are so ill constituted, as not to have
some good Customs. We find admirable
Regulations in 
Denmark,
 and we read of
others among the Savage 
Americans
 fit
to serve for Models to the most civilized

Europeans.


But although the Constitution of our
Government were too perfect already to
receive any Improvement, yet the best
Methods conducing to the peaceable Con∣servation
of its present Form, are well
worth every 
English
 Man's enquiry; nei∣ther
are these so easily to be found in this
Age, which were judged so difficult, (if
not altogether impracticable) by the great∣est


of Politicians in his time.
 'Tis true,
the Wisdom of our Ancestors, or their good
Fortune, has hitherto made these our King∣doms
an Exception to his general Maxim;
yet we all know how many grievous Tem∣pests
(which as often threatned Shipwrack)
this Vessel of our Commonwealth has under∣gone.
The perpetual Contests between the
Kings and the People (whilst those endea∣vour'd
to acquire a greater Power than was
legally due, and these to preserve or re∣cover
their just Liberties) have been the
contending Billows that have kept it afloat;
so that all we pretended to by the late Re∣volution
(bought with so great Expence,
yet not too dearly paid for) was to be as
we were, and that every one should have
his own again; the effecting of which may
be called a piece of good Luck, and that's
the best can be said of it. But must fre∣quent
Blood-lettings be indispensibly ne∣cessary
to preserve our Constitution? Is
it not possible for us to render vain and
untrue that Sarcasm of Forreigners, who
object to us that our 
English
 Kings have
either too little Power, or too much, and
that therefore we must expect no settled or
lasting Peace? Shall we for ever retain
the ill Character they give us of the most
mutable and inconstant Nation of the World?


Which however we do not deserve, no more
than 
England
 does that of 
Regnum Dia∣bolorum,

so common in unconsidering For∣reigners
Mouths? Methinks a Method to
preserve our Commonwealth in its legal
State of Freedom, without the necessity of
a Civil War once or twice every Age,
were a benefit worth searching for, though
we went to the furthest Corners of the
World in quest of it.


Besides the Knowledge of the present
State of our Neighbour Nations (which is
best acquired by 
Travel
) is more incum∣bent
on the Gentlemen of 
England
 than any
others; since they make so considerable a
part of our Government in 
Parliament,

where foreign Business comes frequently un∣der
Consideration, and at present more then
ever.


'Tis none of the smallest Advantages
which his 
Majesty
 has procured us by his
accession to the Crown, that we make a
greater Figure in the World than former∣ly;
we have more foreign Alliances, are
become the Head of more than a Protestant
League, and have a right to intermeddle
in the Affairs of 
Europe,
 beyond what we
ever pretended to in any of the preceding
Reigns: For 'tis a true, though but a Me∣lancholy
Reflexion, that our late 
Kings



half undid us, and bred us up as narrow
spirited as they could, made us consider
our selves as proscribed from the World;
in every sence 
toto divisos orbe Britannos.

And indeed they had withdrawn us from
the World so long till the World had al∣most
overlooked us; we seldom were per∣mitted
to cast an Eye farther than 
France

or 
Holland,
 and then too we were careful∣ly
watched: But at present Matters are
otherwise; we have a 
Prince
 that has rai∣sed
us to our natural Station, the Eyes of
most part of the World are now upon us,
and take their Measures from our Coun∣cils:
We find every day occasion to inform
our selves of the Strength and Interests
of the several Princes of 
Europe.
 And
perhaps one great reason why we live up
no better to the mighty Post we are ad∣vanced
to, nor maintain our Character in
it with great Reputation, is because our
Education has been below it, and we
have been too much lock'd up at home,
when we should have been acquainting our
selves with the Affairs of the World
abroad.


We have lately bought the Experience
of this Truth too dear, not to be now sen∣sible
of it. 'Tis not very long ago since


nothing was more generally believed (e∣ven
by Men of the best Sence) then that
the Power of 
England
 was so unquestion∣ably
establish'd at Sea, that no Force
could possibly shake it, that the 
English

Valour and Manner of Fighting was so
far beyond all others, that nothing was
more desirable than a 
French
 War. Should
any one have been so regardless of his Re∣putation,
as at that time to have repre∣sented
the 
French
 an overmatch for the
united Forces of 
England
 and 
Holland;

or have said that we should live to see our
selves insulted on our own Coasts and our
Trade indanger'd by them, that we should
be in Apprehensions every Year of an Inva∣sion
and a 
French
 Conquest: such a venture∣some
Man must have expected to have pass'd
for a very Traveller, or at best for an ill∣natur'd
or unthinking Person, who little con∣sider'd
what the irresistible Force of an

English
 Arm was; But our late Experience
has reclaim'd us from these Mistakes; our
Fathers and Grandfathers told us indeed
these things when they were true, when
our 
Yeomanry
 and 
Commonalty
 were
evey day exercised in drawing the 
Long∣bow

and handling the 
Brown-bill,
 with
other Weapons then in use, wherein we ex∣cell'd


all the World; but we have liv'd up∣on
the Credit of those Times too long,
and superciliously neglected our formidable
Neighbour and Enemy, whilst he was im∣proving
his Strength, and we through the
Encouragement, and by design of our late

Rulers
 were enervating our own.


The 
Ecclesiasticks
 of most Religions, who
are allow'd to understand and prosecute
their own Interests best of any People,
though they be generally Persons whose
Function obliges them to a sedentary and
studious Course of Life, have not omitted
to draw such Advantages from 
Travel
 as
conduce to their Honour and Profit. These
Men, whose conversing with Books makes
them know more then others, have yet
found their Account in sending some of
the most judicious of their Members and
Fraternities to fetch home Knowledge and
Experience from the remotest parts of
the World. The Colledge 
De propaganda
fide
 was establish'd under pretence indeed
of serving Religion, but we know the Foun∣ders
of it are no farther slaves to Religion
than 'twill be serviceable to them, neither
was it so much through zeal for Conversi∣ons,
as to increase their Revenues, and
learn Forreign Policies in Church and State


Affairs. The 
Jesuits
 have brought seve∣ral
Maxims, as well as Sums, from as far
off as 
China
 and 
Japan,
 thereby impro∣ving
their Knowledgè, so as to outwit their
Friends at home, and by following their
Example in this. I am sure we can run no
hazard, at least of passing for Fools. These
Men (whose firm adherence to the most
exquisite Tyranny is manifest by their in∣defatigable
endeavours in behalf of the

French
 King's Interests, as formerly of the
House of 
Austria
's, whilst it was in its
heighth) have by these Arts ingrossed to
themselves the Education of the Youth in
all Popish Countries. The 
Lutheran

Priests (who have an entire dependance
on their Kings and Princes) are intrusted
with the like in those Countries which ob∣serve
the Confession of 
Ausburg.
 They also
send abroad some of their hopefullest young
Students, several of which may be met with
at 
Oxford, Cambridge,
 and 
Paris:
 The
use they make of 
Travel
 being not only to
improve their Knowledge in Sciences, but
to learn fit Methods to please their Sove∣raigns
at the expence of the Peoples Li∣berties.
Now in former Ages, whilst the

Ecclesiasticks
 were both ignorant and scan∣dalously
wicked, they were not esteemed by
the Laity, and consequently had not so


much power to do mischief: But since that
through a Reformation of Manners, and
Knowledge of the World, they have reco∣ver'd
credit, and that the restored Learn∣ing
of 
Europe
 is principally lodg'd among
them, they have gained a much greater
influence both on the Opinions and Pra∣ctices
of their Disciples, and promoted a

pernicious Doctrine
 with all the success
they themselves could desire. But the same

Travel
 will afford the best Antidote for
this Poyson, and teach a Gentleman, who
makes right use of it, by what steps 
Slave∣ry

has within these last 200 Years crept
upon 
Europe,
 most of the Protestant, as
well as Popish Countries having in a man∣ner
quite lost the precious Jewel 
Liberty.

This cannot be attributed to any more pro∣bable
cause than the enslaving the Spirits
of the People, as a preparative to that of
their Bodies; for since those Forreign
Princes think it their Interest that Sub∣jects
should obey without 
Reserve,
 and all

Priests,
 who depend upon the 
Prince,
 are
for their own sakes obliged to promote what
he esteems his Interest, 'tis plain, the E∣ducation
of Youth, on which is laid the
very Foundation Stones of the publick Li∣berty,
has been of late years committed to
the sole management of such as make it


their business to undermine it; and must
needs do so, unless they will be false to their
Fortunes, and make the Character of 
Priest

give place to that of true 
Patriot.


'Tis confest that in their Schools and
Universities, excellent Rules for attaining
Languages and Sciences are made use of
with greater success than any heretofore:
Those Youths especially, who have been
bred among the 
Jesuits,
 are justly remark∣ed
to excel others of equal Parts instructed
elsewhere: But still this is only a train∣ing
up in the knowledge of Words and Lan∣guages,
whereof there is seldom any occasi∣on,
as if the Pupils were intended to be
made School-masters; whilst the weightier
Matters of true Learning, whereof one has
occasion every hour; such as good Princi∣ples,
Morals, the improvement of Rea∣son,
the love of Justice, the value of Li∣berty,
the duty owing to ones Countrey and
the Laws, are either quite omitted, or
slightly passed over: Indeed they forget
not to recommend frequently to them what
they call the 
Queen of all Vertues,
 viz.

Submission
 to Superiors, and an entire

blind Obedience
 to Authority, without
instructing them in the due measures of it,
rather teaching them that 'tis without all
bounds: Thus the Spirits of Men are


from the beginning inured to Subjection,
and deprived of the right Notion of a ge∣nerous
and legal Freedom; which few a∣mong
them (so hardly are the prejudices
of Education shaken off) grow sensible of,
till they become of some Age and Maturity,
or have unlearn'd by good Company and
Travel those dangerous 
passive Doctrines

they suck'd in at the 
Schools
 and 
Univer∣sities:

But most have the Misfortune to
carry these slavish Opinions with them to
their Graves.


Had these Countries, whilst they were
free, committed the Government of their
Youth to 
Philosophers
 instead of 
Priests,

they had in all probability preserv'd them∣selves
from the Yoak of Bondage to this
day, whereas now they not only endure it,
but approve of it likewise.—
tantum rel∣ligio
potuit.


The 
Greeks
 and 
Romans
 instituted their

Academies
 to quite another purpose, the
whole Education of their Youth tended to
make them as useful to the Society they
lived in as possible. There they were
train'd up to Exercise and Labour, to ac∣custom
them to an active Life: No Vice
was more infamous than Sloth, nor any
Man more contemptible than him that was
too lazy to do all the Good he could; the



Lectures
 of their 
Philosophers
 served to
quicken them up to this. They recommend∣ed
above all things the Duty to their
Countrey, the preservation of the Laws
and the publick Liberty; subservient to
which they preach'd up Moral Virtues,
such as Fortitude, Temperance, Justice, a
contempt of Death, 
&c.
 Sometimes they
made use of 
pious Cheats,
 as 
Elisian

Fields, and an Assurance of Future Hap∣piness,
if they died in the Cause of their
Countrey; and even deceived their Hea∣rers
into Greatness: Hence proceeded all
those Noble 
Characters
 wherewith their
Histories are so stock'd: Hence it was
that their 
Philosophers
 were deservedly
look'd upon as Supports of the State, they
had their dependance wholly upon it; and
as they could have no Interest distinct
from it, they laid out themselves towards
the advancing and promoting the good of
it, insomuch that we find the very good
Fortune of their 
Commonwealths
 often
lasted no longer than they did. The ma∣nagers
of our modern Education have not
been quite so publick Spirited, for it has
been, as I have shewn, for the most part
in the hands of Men who have a distinct
Interest from the publick; therefore 'tis
not to be wondred at, if like the rest of


the World, they have been byassed by it,
and directed their principal Designs to∣wards
the advancing their own Fortunes.


Good 
Learning
 as well as 
Travel
 is a
great Antidote against the Plague of 
Ty∣ranny.

The Books that are left us of the

Ancients
 (from whence, as from Foun∣tains,
we draw all that we are now Ma∣sters
of) are full of Doctrines, Sentences,
and Examples exhorting to the Conserva∣tion
or Recovery of the publick 
Liberty,

which was once valued above Life. The

Hero
's there celebrated are for the most
part such as had destroyed or expelled 
Ty∣rants;

and though 
Brutus
 be generally de
claimed against by modern School-boys,
he was then esteemed the true Pattern and
Model of exact Vertue. Such was 
Cato
 of

Utica,
 with others of like stamp. The
more any person is conversant with good
Books, the more shall he find the practices
of these Great Men in this particular found∣ed
upon Reason, Justice, and Truth; and
unanimously approv'd of by most of the suc∣ceeding
Wise-men which the World has
produc'd.


But instead of Books which inform the
Judgment, those are commonly read in the
Schools abroad, wherein an Elegancy of

Latin
 and 
Greek
 Style is more sought af∣ter


than the matter contained in them:
So that such as treat a little boldly of pub∣lick

Liberty
 occur to the reading of few,
and those grown Men, rather through Chance
or their Curiosity, than the recommendati∣on
of their Instructors.


'Twas not to learn Forreign Languages
that the 
Graecian
 and 
Roman
 Youths went
for so long together to the 
Academies
 and

Lectures
 of their 
Philosophers.
 'Twas
not then, as now with us, when the Cha∣racter
of a Scholar is to be Skilled in
Words; when one who is well versed in
the dark Terms and Subtilties of the
Schools passes for a profound Philosopher,
by which we seem so far to have perverted
the Notion of Learning, that a Man may
be reputed a most extraordinary Scholar,
and at the same time be the most useless
Thing in the World; much less was it to
learn their own Mother Tongues, the

Greek
 and 
Latin,
 which we hunt after so
eagerly for many Years together, (not as
being the Vehicles of good Sence, but as if
they had some intrinsick Virtue.) 'Twas to
learn how and when to speak pertinently,
how to act like a Man to subdue the Pas∣sions,
to be publick Spirited, to despise
Death, Torments, and Reproach, Riches
and the Smiles of Princes, as well as their


Frowns, if they stood between them and
their Duty. This manner of Education
produced Men of another stamp than ap∣pears
now upon the Theatre of the World;
such as we are scarce worthy to mention,
and must never hope to imitate, till the
like manner of Institution grows again into
Reputation; which in Enslaved Countries
'tis never likely to do, as long as the 
Ec∣clesiasticks,

who have an opposite Interest,
keep not only the Education of Youth,
but the Consciences of old Men in their
Hands.


To serve by-ends, and because 
Priests

thought they should find their own account
in it, they calculated those unintelligible
Doctrines of 
Passive Obedience
 and 
Jus
Divinum;
 that the People ought to pay an
absolute Obedience to a limited Govern∣ment;
fall down and worship the work of
their own Hands, as if it dropt from Hea∣ven;
together with other as profitable Do∣ctrines,
which no doubt many are by this
time ashamed of, tho' they think it below
them to condescend so far as to confess them∣selves
to have been in the wrong. For this
Notion of 
Jus Divinum
 of Kings and Prin∣ces
was never known in these Northern
Parts of the World till these latter Ages of

Slavery:
 Even in the Eastern Countries,


though they adore their Kings as Gods,
yet they never fancied they received their
Right to Reign immediately from Hea∣ven.
The single Example in Scripture
so much insisted on, 
viz.
 the Reign of

Saul
 over the 
Jews,
 and 
Samuel
's De∣scription
of what a King would be, not
what he lawfully might be; proves ei∣ther
nothing at all, or the contrary to
what some would have it; for besides that
there are many Relations of Fact in the

Old Testament,
 not condemned there,
which it would not be only inconvenient, but
sinful for us to imitate: Whoever peruses
the whole Story of 
Saul
 and his Successor,
will therein find more substantial Argu∣ments
against the 
Jus Divinum
 and 
Non∣Resistance,

than for it: But we shall leave
this, both as being too large an Argument
for the compass of a Preface, and as being
already fully handled by more able Pens.


All 
Europe
 was in a manner a free Coun∣try
till very lately insomuch that the 
Eu∣ropaeans

were, and still are, distinguish'd
in the 
Eastern
 Parts of the World by the
name of 
Franks.
 In the beginning small
Territories, or Congregations of People,
chose valiant and wise Men to be their
Captains or Judges, and as often Deposed
them upon Mis-management. These Captains


(doing their Duty well and faithfully)
were the Originals of all our Kings and
Princes, which at first, and for a long
time were every where 
Elective.
 Accord∣ing
to their own Warlike Temper, or that
of the People which they govern'd, they
(upon the Score of Revenge, Ambition, or
being overthronged with Multitudes at
home) encroached upon their Neighbours;
till from petty Principalities their Coun∣tries
waxed to mighty Kingdoms. 
Spain

alone consisting of twelve or thirteen till
t'other day, and one part of our 
Island
 of
no less than 
seven:
 Each of these was at
first made through an Union of many petty

Lordships. Italy
 from several small 
Com∣monwealths

was at length swallowed up
by the 
Emperors, Popes, Kings
 of 
Spain,
Dukes
 of 
Florence,
 and other lesser 
Ty∣rants.

Yet 'tis to be remark'd that the
ancient State of 
Europe
 is best preserved
in 
Italy
 even to this day, notwithstanding
the Encroachments which have been there
made on the 
Peoples Liberties;
 of which
one Reason may be, that the 
Republicks,

which are more in number and quality in
that Spot of Ground than in all 
Europe
 be∣sides,
keep their 
Ecclesiasticks
 within
their due bounds, and make use of that
natural Wit which Providence and a hap∣py


Climate has given them, to curb those,
who if they had Power would curb all the
World.


Every one ought to know how great the
Rights of the 
People
 were very lately in
the 
Elective
 Kingdoms of 
Sweden
 and

Denmark;
 how 
Germany
 was freer than
any other part of 
Europe,
 till at length
'twas Lorded by 
Captains,
 which (in pro∣cess
of time grew 
Princes
 and 
Electors
)
and by 
Bishops
 with Temporal Authority,
who may thank 
Charles the Great
 (a very
bigotted Prince) for their double Sword of

Flesh
 and 
Spirit.


If it be objected, that Princes have ac∣quired
a Right to be absolute and arbitrary
where the Subjects have given up their

Liberties,
 there are some in the World
who venture to answer, That no People
in their right Wits, (that is) not guided
by Fear or Tumult, can be supposed to
confer an absolute Dominion, or to give
away the Freedom of themselves and their
Posterity for all Generations; that such a
Donation ought to be esteemed of no great∣er
validity than the Gift of an Estate by
a Child or a Mad-man from his lawful
Successor; that the People can no more
part with their legal 
Liberties,
 then Kings
can alienate their Crowns: That nothing


which even the Representative Body of
the People does, which shall afterwards
tend to the detriment of the Universality
can then be obligatory, because many things
good and profitable at the time of making
those Laws may be the quite contrary af∣terwards,
and as soon as any Law grows
apparently mischievous to the whole Body
that made it, or their Successors, it ought
by them to be repealed, and would certain∣ly
be so in Countries where frequent free

Assemblies
 of the 
States
 are in use. That
if these Assemblies be hindred, or cor∣rupted
by sinister Practices, the obliging
quality of such a Law determines of it
self through its own nature, it being sup∣posed
that the true Representatives of
the People would have annull'd it, had
they been permitted to meet and act free∣ly:
That the Acts of one general 
Parlia∣ment,

though a free one, are not perpetu∣ally
obliging, since that as well as particu∣lar
Persons is liable to mistakes; but the
Acts of an eternal Succession of 
Parlia∣ments,

who make, confirm, change, or re∣peal Laws at their pleasure.


These are hard Sayings in the Opinion
of many; but thus much we are sure of,
whoever goes about to destroy or diminish
the Right of the People in the disposal of


the 
Crown,
 at the same time subverts their

Majesty
's 
Title
 to it: 'Tis therefore season∣able
now or never to assert both; notwith∣standing
the prevarication of those who
dare act under and receive benefit by this
Revolution which they contributed nothing
to, but which the People through God's As∣sistance
procured for themselves; yet will
not dive into the Merits of the Cause,
nor own the Lawfulness of the Fact; but
either cautiously avoid the Argument, or
if it comes cross their way, mumble it as
tenderly as the 
Ass
 did the 
Thistle,
 which
caused the Philosopher to laugh, who
never did it in his Life but that once; so
this manner of Behaviour would move both
the Laughter and Indignation of all under∣standing
Persons, Lovers of their Coun∣tries

legal Liberties,
 for none are forced
to fall under greater Absurdities, or to
make more terrible Blunders in Divinity,
Politicks, and good Sence, than such as
would fain reconcile present 
Interest
 to
their old beloved 
Maxims—res est ridi∣cula
& nimis jocosa;
 Catull. But Hea∣ven
be praised, the Nation is almost freed
from the gross Error of that 
slavish Do∣ctrine,

in spite of the Endeavours of such
as would keep it alive, like hot Embers
cover'd over with Ashes, ready to be blown


up again into a flame upon the first occasi∣on.


In 
Russia
 and 
Muscovy
 the Government
is as Tyrannical as in any of the more 
Ea∣stern
Monarchies,
 the 
Priests
 there have
very much contributed both to make and
keep it so. To the end that the People
may be kept in the requisite Temper of O∣bedience,
none are permitted to Travel
upon pain of Death, except such as have
special License, which are exceeding few;
neither are any Gentlemen of those Coun∣tries
to be met with abroad, but publick
Ministers and their Retinue: The Cause
of this severe Prohibition is, least such
Travellers should see the Liberty of other
Nations, and be tempted to covet the like
for themselves at home, which might occa∣sion
Innovations in the State. The same
reason which induces Tyrants to prohibit
Travelling, should encourage the People of
free Countries to practice it, in order to
learn the Methods of preserving that which
once lost is very difficultly recover'd; for

Tyranny
 usually steals upon a State by
degrees, and is (as a wise Man said) like a

hectick Fever,
 which at first is easie to
be cured, but hardly can be known; after
'tis throughly known it becomes almost in∣curable.
Now 
travel
 best of all other Me∣thods


discovers (at least expence) the
Symptoms of this pernicious Disease, as
well as its dismal Effects when grown to a
head; and 'tis certainly of greater Impor∣tance
to understand how to preserve a
sound Constitution, than how to repair a
crazed one, though this also be a beneficial
piece of Knowledge.


In our own 
Universities,
 which are with∣out
controversie the best in the World,
whether we consider their Revenues, their
Buildings, or their Learning, there are
travelling Fellowships establish'd; which
in a Country where the 
Clergy
's Interest
is not distinct from that of the 
Laity,
 is so
far from being prejudicial to the legal Li∣berties
of the People, that it tends to the
Conservation of them; for such worthy Men
as are employ'd abroad, may bring home
generous Notions of Liberty, and make ad∣mirable
Remarks on the contrary State;
which being inculcated from the Pulpit,
and enforced by the learned Arguments of
able Divines, must needs overthrow those
servile Opinions, which of late have been
too much back'd by 
God's Authority,
 al∣most
to the ruin of a 
Free People.


I do not hereby mean to reflect on the
Order which generally has the govern∣ment
of our Youth; we have had the Ex∣perience


of many among them who have
given proof of a freer Education and use∣ful
Learning: And without question the
chief Posts of the Gown of both kinds were
never better fill'd than at present. I only
lament the ill Contrivance of their Con∣stitution,
for while Interest draws one way,
and Honesty another, when a Man may
make his Fortune by forgetting his Duty to
his Country, but shall always stick at 
Mark

while he serves it; 'tis scarcely to be ho∣ped
Men should hold out against such
Temptations, unless they be more gifted
with Honesty than the generality of Man∣kind
are. And since they continue still
upon the same bottom, it must be expect∣ed
the same, or other as mischievous Do∣ctrines
will every day be broach'd: where∣as
if they were once set upon the same foot
the Philosophers of old were, if Honesty
and the Duty to their Country were made
their private Interest, and the way to
thrive; we should soon see them shift
hands, and the Spirit of those 
Philoso∣phers

revive again in them.


The Constitution of our 
Universities,
 as
to Learning, seems as unfortunately regu∣lated
as it is to Politicks. We receive the
directions of our Studies there, from Sta∣tutes
made by those who understood


nothing of the Matter, who had a quite dif∣ferent
Notion and Taste of Learning from
what the World has at present: It seems
as ridiculous to take Patterns for the gen∣tile
Learning of this Age from the old fa∣shion'd
Learning of the Times wherein the
University Statutes were compiled, as it
would be for one who would appear well
dress'd at Court, to make his Cloaths after
the Mode in 
Henry
 the VIII's day: But
'tis of infinitely worse consequence; for the
Prejudices and wrong Notions, the stiffness
and positiveness in Opinion, the litigious∣ness
and wrangling, all which the old Phi∣losophy
breeds, besides the narrow Spirited∣ness,
and not enduring of Contradiction,
which are generally contracted by a Mo∣nastick
Life, require a great deal of time to
get rid of, and until they be filed off by
Conversation in the World abroad, a Man's
Learning does but render him more useless
and unfit for Society.


I dare appeal to common Experience,
whether those excellent Men that of late
Years have been preferred in our Church
(then which Set of Divines 
England
 scarce
ever knew a better) be not for the most
part such as have been very conversant
with the World; and if they have not all
travell'd out of this Kingdom, have at least


spent the best part of their days in this
Epitom of the World, the City of 
London,

where they have learnt Christian Liberty
as well as other Christian Vertues. The
great difference between these and others
of narrow 
Opiniastre
 Tempers caus'd by
their Monk-like Education is discernable
by every Body, and puts it out of all
doubt, that such who have seen most, of
what Profession soever they be, prove the
most honest and virtuous Men, and fittest
for Humane Society: these embrace better
Notions relating to the Publick, weigh O∣pinions
before they adhere to them, have a
larger Stock of Charity, a clearer Manner
of distinguishing between Just and Unjust,
understand better the Laws of our own
Land, as well as the Priviledges and Frail∣ties
of Human Nature; And all this in a de∣gree
far excelling the most zealous learn∣ed
religious Person who has been brought up
in his Cell, and is therefore what we call
a 
Bigot,
 stiff in an Opinion, meerly be∣cause
he has been used to it, and is asha∣med
to be thought capable of being de∣ceived.


Lawyers,
 whose manner of Breeding is
much abroad in the World, and who are
used to promiscuous Conversation, have
been observed in most places to be great


Favourers of 
Liberty,
 because their know∣ledge
of ancient Practice, and the just Title
which the People have to their Priviledges
(which they meet with every where in
their course of Reading) makes them less
scrupulous of committing what some Di∣vines
miscal a Sin in those that endeavour
to preserve or recover them; the Over∣sights
of some few Gentlemen of this honour∣able
Profession are therefore the less excu∣sable;
for I must confess, among other
things, that Motto, 
A Deo Rex, à Rege
Lex
—wherein the Divine Right of the
impious Will of a Tyrant is as strongly
asserted as could be in the compass of a
Ring, has occasioned frequent Reflections,
not much in favour of those that made use
of it.


Thus I have touch'd upon the Manner
of Education necessary to the beginning
and finishing a Gentleman, who is to be
useful to his Country, which I suppose ought
to be the principal end of it. And I can't
but believe, if in our Schools our Youth
were bred up to understand the Meaning
of the Authors they are made to read, as
well as the 
Syntax
 of the Words. If there
were as much care taken to inculcate the
good Maxims, and recommend the noble
Characters the old Historians are so full


of, as there is to hammer into their Heads
the true Grammar of them, and the fine∣ness
of the Phrase: If in our 
Universities

a proportionable Care were taken to fur∣nish
them with noble and generous Learn∣ing:
If after this they were duly informed
in the Laws and Affairs of their own
Country, trained up in good Conversation
and useful Knowledge at home, and then
sent abroad when their Heads began to be
well settled, when the heat of Youth was
worn off, and their Judgments ripe enough
to make Observation: I say, I cannot but
believe that with this manner of Instituti∣on
a very moderate Understanding might
do wonders, and the coming home fully
instructed in the Constitutions of other Go∣vernments,
would make a Man but the
more resolute to maintain his own.


For the advantage of a free Govern∣ment
above its contrary needs no other
help to make it appear, then only to be ex∣posed
to a considerate View with it: The
difference may be seen written in the very
Faces of the several People, as well as in
their manner of Living; and when we find
nothing but Misery in the fruitfullest Coun∣tries
subject to Arbitrary Power, but al∣ways
a Face of plenty and Chearfulness in
Countries naturally unfruitful, which have


preserv'd their Liberties, there is no fur∣ther
room left for Argument, and one can∣not
be long in determining which is most
eligible. This Observation is so obvious
that 'tis hard for any that Travels not to
make it; therefore 'tis a sufficient reason
why all our Gentry should go abroad. An

English
 Man should be shewn the Misery
of the enslaved Parts of the World, to
make him in Love with the Happiness of
his own Country; as the 
Spartans
 exposed
their drunken Servants to their Children,
to make them in love with Sobriety.


But the more polish'd and delicious
Countries of 
France, Spain,
 or 
Italy,
 are
not the places where this Observation may
be made to greatest advantage; the Man∣ner
of Living, Goodness of the Air and
Diet, the Magnificence of the Buildings,
Pleasantness of the Gardens, pompous E∣quipage
of some great Persons, dazzle the
Eyes of most Travellers, and cast a disguise
upon the Slavery of those Parts; and as
they render this Evil more supportable to
the Natives, so they almost quite hide it
from the view of a Cursory Traveller, a∣musing
him too much from considering the
Calamities which accompany so much Splen∣dour,
and so many Natural Blessings: or
from reflecting how much more happy the


Condition of the People would be with
better usage. But in the 
Northern King∣doms

and 
Provinces
 there appears little
or nothing to divert the Mind from con∣templating
Slavery in its own Colours,
without any of its Ornaments. And since,
for that reason, few of our Gentlemen find
temptation enough to Travel into those
Parts, and we have hardly any tolerable
Relation of them extant, though we have
frequent occasions of being concerned with
them, I thought it might be of use to pub∣lish
the following 
Account of Denmark,

which I took care to be informed of upon
the place with the greatest Exactness pos∣sible,
and have related fairly and impar∣tially,
which may save the Curious the la∣bour
and expence of that 
Voyage.


That 
Kingdom
 has often had the Mis∣fortune
to be govern'd by 
French Counsels.

At the time when Mr. 
Algernoon Sydney

was 
Ambassador
 at that Court, Monsieur

Terlon,
 the 
French
 Ambassador, had the
Confidence to tear out of the Book of

Motto
's in the King's Library, this Verse,
which Mr. 
Sydney
 (according to the li∣berty
allowed to all noble Strangers) had
written in it:

—manus haec inimica tyrannis


Ense petit placidam sub libertate quietem.—

though Monsieur 
Terlon
 understood not a
word of 
Latin,
 he was told by others the
Meaning of that Sentence, which he consi∣dered
as a 
Libel
 upon the 
French
 Govern∣ment,
and upon such as was then a setting
up in 
Denmark
 by 
French
 Assistance, or
Example.


To conclude; A considering 
English

Traveller will find by experience, that at
present nothing is so generally studied by
the 
Sovereign Princes
 of the World, as
the Arts of War, and the keeping of their
own Countries in the desired Subjection.
The Arts of Peace, whereby the Encrease
and Prosperity of their Subjects might be
promoted, being either intirely neglected
or faintly prosecuted; he will further be
convinced what great reason he has to bless
Providence for his being born, and con∣tinuing
yet a 
Freeman:
 He will find that
the securing this inestimable Blessing to
himself, and transmitting it to late Poste∣rity,
is a Duty he owes to his Country;
the right performance of which does in a
great measure depend upon a good Edu∣cation
of our Youth, and the Preserva∣tion


of our Constitution upon its true and
natural 
Basis,
 The 
Original Contract.

All other Foundations being false, non∣sensical,
and rotten; derogatory to the
present Government, and absolutely de∣structive
to the legal Liberties of the

English Nation.


Salus populi suprema lex esto.












AN
ACCOUNT
OF
Denmark,
AS
It was in the Year 1692.




CHAP. I.




Of the Territories belonging to the
King of 
Denmark,
 and their
Situation.




IF we consider the Extent of the
King of 
Denmark
's Dominions, he
may with Justice be reckoned a∣mong
the greatest Princes of 
Eu∣rope;

but if we have regard to the im∣portance
and value of them, he may be


put in Ballance with the King of 
Portu∣gal,

and possibly be found lighter.


His Stile is King of 
Denmark
 and 
Nor∣way,

of the 
Goths
 and 
Vandals,
 Duke of

Sleswick
 and 
Holstein, Stormar,
 and 
Dit∣marsh;

Earl in 
Oldenburg
 and 
Delmen∣horst;

all which Countries he actually
possesses either in whole or in part: so
that except that of the 
Goths
 and 
Van∣dals,

which Title both he and the King
of 
Sweden
 use, and which the Crown of

Denmark
 has retained ever since it was
Master of 
Sweden
 (as we in 
England
 do
that of 
France
) all the rest are substan∣tial
and not empty Titles.


My design is to acquaint you with
the present State of these Countries, and
to offer nothing but what I have either
Collected from sensible grave Persons, or
what my own Knowledge and Experience
has confirm'd to be Truth.


Since the late Wars between that fa∣mous
Captain 
Charles Gustavus
 of 
Swe∣den,

and 
Frederic
 the Third, which end∣ed
in a Peace 
Anno
 1660. 
Denmark
 has
been forced to sit down with the loss of
all its Territories which lay on the other
side of the 
Baltick
 Sea; 
Schonen, Halland,

and 
Bleking
 remaining to the 
Swedes,

notwithstanding frequent Struggles to re∣cover
them. These three (especially



Schonen
) were the best Provinces be∣longing
to 
Denmark,
 and therefore are
still looked upon with a very envious
Eye by the 
Danes:
 And for this very
reason 'tis reported, that the Windows of

Cronenburgh
 Castle, whose Prospect lay
towards 
Schonen,
 were wall'd up, that so
hateful an Object might not cause conti∣nual
heart-burnings.


Denmark
 therefore, as it is thus clipp'd,
is at present bounded on all sides with
the Sea, except one small Neck of Land,
where it joins to 
Holstein;
 the 
German

Ocean washes it on the West and North-west;
the entrance into the 
Baltick,

called the 
Categate
 on the North, and
North-East; the 
Baltick
 on the East;
and the River 
Eyder
 on the South; which
having its source very near the East Sea,
takes his course Westward, and falls in∣to
the Ocean at 
Toningen,
 a strong Town
of the Duke of 
Holstein Gottorp's:
 So
that if a Channel were made of about
three 
Danish
 Miles from that River to

Kiel,
 'twould be a perfect Island. I in∣clude
in this Account the Dutchy of 
Sles∣wick

as part of 
Denmark,
 but not the
Dutchy of 
Holstein;
 because the former
was a Fief of that Crown, the latter of
the Empire.


All 
Denmark
 therefore comprehending


its Islands, as I have thus bounded it, lyes
in length between the degrees of 54
gr.

45
min.
 and 58
gr.
 15
min.
 North Latitude,
the breadth not being proportionable;
and may at a large Computation be rec∣koned
to amount to the bigness of two
thirds of the Kingdom of 
Ireland.


Norway,
 which lies North from 
Den∣mark,

and is separated from it by that
Sea which is usually called the 
Categate,

is a vast and barren Countrey, full of
Mountains and Firr-trees; it reaches
from 59 to 71 degrees of North Lati∣tude;
but is very narrow in respect to
its length. It is bounded on the West
and North by the Ocean, on the East by

Sweden
 and the Territories belonging to
it; on the South by the Sea lying be∣tween
it and 
Denmark.
 The Sea is so
deep about it, that there is no Ancho∣rage
for Ships; and therefore its Coasts
are accounted the most dangerous of a∣ny
in 
Europe
 to run with in the Night,
or in a Storm; on which if you chance
to be driven, there is no scaping, the
Shoar being all along high Rocks, at the
very foot of which one may find 200
Fathom Water.


Holstein,
 which includes 
Ditmarsh
 and

Stormar,
 is bounded by the Dutchy of

Sleswick
 on the North, the Dutchy of



Saxe Lawenburg
 on the South-East, the
River 
Elbe
 on the South-West, the rest
of it is washed by the Ocean and 
Bal∣tick

Sea. It lies between the 54th and
55th degrees of North Latitude.


Oldenburg
 and 
Delmenhorst
 are two
Counties in 
Germany
 that lye together,
detached from all the rest of the King of

Denmark
's Countries; the two Rivers,

Elb
 and 
Weser,
 and the Dutchy of 
Bre∣men,

interposing between them and 
Hol∣stein.

They are bounded on the North-East
by the 
Weser,
 on the West by 
East-Friesland

and the County of 
Embden,
 on
the South by part of the Bishoprick of

Munster.
 They are a small Territory of
about 35 
English
 Miles in Diameter; the
middle of which is in the Latitude of 53
degrees and a half.


The rest of the King of 
Denmark
's
Territories not mentioned in the enume∣ration
of his Titles, are the Islands of

Feroe,
 and 
Iseland
 in the Northern O∣cean.
St. 
Thomas,
 one of the 
Caribbe
Islands
 in the 
West-Indies.
 A Fort up∣on
the Coast of 
Guinea,
 call'd 
Christians∣burg;

and another in the 
East-Indies,

call'd 
Tranquebar.
 He has likewise a Toll
at 
Elfleet
 upon the River 
Weser.


Thus much may serve in general
touching the Dominions of that King;


which have this great inconveniency,
that they are mightily disjoined and se∣parated
from each other; it being cer∣tain,
that a State which is confined by
many Principalities is weak, exposed to
many dangers, and requires a more than
ordinary Expence, as well as Prudence,
to preserve it entire: And it is to this
principally that the Conquests which the

Swedes
 have gained upon them may be ascribed.






CHAP. II.




Of 
Denmark
 in particular, and the
Island of 
Zealand.




THIS being the most considerable,
and in value four parts in five of
all the Territories belonging to the
Crown of 
Denmark,
 I shall give a more
particular account of it than of the rest.
Others, I know, have given us the Ge∣nealogies
and Succession of its Kings, an∣cient
Names, Inhabitants, Conquests, 
&c.

my business is only to inform how it
stands at this day, and to enter no fur∣ther
into the former History, or the Geo∣graphy
of the Countrey, than is necessa∣ry


to the understanding the present State of it.


Denmark
 then, properly so called, con∣sists
of many Islands in the 
Baltick
 Sea,
and of that part of the Continent which
is now called 
Jutland:
 The Dutchy of

Sleswick,
 which I reckoned in the former
Chapter as part of it, shall be treated of
by it self, because it is divided between
the King and the Duke of 
Holstein Got∣torp;

whereas these above-mentioned
are wholly the King's. 
Jutland
 is the
biggest and most fertile Countrey, but
the Islands are more considerable in re∣gard
of their Situation, especially 
Zea∣land;

because 
Copenhagen,
 the Chief Ci∣ty
of 
Denmark,
 is seated in it, and the
famous passage of the 
Sound
 is bordered
by its Shoar, where, on the narrowest
part the Town of 
Elsinor
 stands: where∣fore
I shall begin with a description of
them, and first of 
Zealand.


It is almost of a Circular Figure, and
contains about 180 
English
 Miles in Cir∣cumference;
I cannot commend its Fer∣tility,
there being no Bread corn grow∣ing
in any part of it except Rye, which
indeed is in good quantity, and whereof
most of their Bread is made. There are
few Meadows in it, and yet there is no
want of good Hay: Most of their Grass,


which is short and sweet, grows by the
sides of their Corn Fields, or in some
scattered spots of Marish Grounds. It
has no Rivers, nor above half a score
Brooks that are able to turn a Mill; to
supply this, there is a great number of
fine Lakes sufficiently stored with Fish.
The Air is but indifferent, especially in
and near 
Copenhagen;
 which is occasion∣ed
by the frequent Fogs and low Situa∣tion;
yet Colds of the Lungs are very
rare here; this I attribute to the pure∣ness
of their firing, which is Beech-wood,
the only sort of Timber trees which a∣bound
in this Island. About one fourth
part of it is Forest, lying open for the
King's Hunting and his Game, such as

Staggs, Wild-Boars, Roe-Bucks, &c.
 these
are such Sacred things that no Body dares
touch them, though they find them in
whole Herds destroying their Corn, to
the infinite yearly damage of the poor
Peasants.


The Face of the Land is pleasant in
many places, abounding with little Hills,
Woods and Lakes in a very agreeable di∣versity.
For Sea-Ports, that most ex∣cellent
one belonging to 
Copenhagen
 must
make amends for the want of them, not
only in this, but many other of the I∣slands;
there being few others, that I


know of, capable of harbouring a Vessel of 200 Tuns.


Neither is this a sensible want, because
there are no Commodities in this Island
for Exportation: In good years, that is,
wet ones (for the Soil being altogether
Sandy, requires frequent Rains, even thus
far North) there may be some overplus
of Rye; and I have been told, that about
forty years ago, ten or twelve 
Dutch
 Fly∣boats
found yearly their Lading at 
Kiog,

a pretty flourishing Town at that time,
within twenty 
English
 Miles of 
Copenha∣gen;

but of late they seem to be well sa∣tisfied
if the Product of the Isle main∣tains
in this sort of Grain the Inhabitants
of it: Not that the numbers of these are
increased, but Husbandry is not so much
encouraged now as when the Taxes of
the poor Countrey People were less fre∣quent
and grievous.


The Cattle here are generally small
and lean; kept within doors seven or
eight Months in the Year; where their
Feeding is partly Hay, partly Brewers
Grains, Roots, Weeds, and such Trash
as their Owners can provide for them.
In Summer time their Beef is sweet and
juicy; but Weather Mutton was a rare
thing till of late; nor is it common now,
they being not used to Geld their Sheep;


and therefore 'twas usually eaten while it was Lamb.


The feeding of the Commonalty gene∣rally
throughout all 
Denmark
 is very
mean; the Burgers and Citizens sustain∣ing
themselves with Rye-bread, Salt-flesh,
Stock-fish, Bacon, and very bad Cheese;
insomuch that the Inspectors of our Mar∣kets
in 
England,
 who use to destroy or
send to the Prisons all such Victuals as
are not judged wholsom, would (if they
found them no better provided than at

Copenhagen
) go near to empty the Mar∣kets,
and leave little to either Buyer or
Seller. The Peasants live on Roots,
white Meats, and Rye-bread; seldom
tasting fresh Fish, and scarce ever Flesh,
unless on some extraordinary Festivals, as
on St. 
Martin
's Eve, when each Family
in 
Denmark,
 without sail, makes merry
with a rosted Goose at Supper.


Here, and in all 
Denmark,
 are but two
Seasons of the Year, Winter and Sum∣mer;
those two other more agreeable
ones of Spring and 
Autumn
 not being
commonly known; the Spring never,
and the 
Autumn
 seldom; you immediate∣ly
leap from extremity of Heat to extre∣mity
of Cold; and so on the contrary,
when Winter is over, from Cold to Heat.
During the three Months of 
June, July,



and 
August,
 the Heat is much more in∣tense
than in 
England,
 and very sultry
in the Nights, but 'tis a gloomy Heat,
and People generally perceive some in∣terposition
of thick Vapours between
them and the Sun. In 
Copenhagen,
 du∣ring
these three Months, they are con∣stantly
troubled with the Plague of Flies,
which they endeavour to destroy by a
poysoned Water; upon the laying of
which in their Kitchins and Chambers,
I have seen whole Bushels of dead Flies
swept together in one Room.


The 
Baltick
 Sea near this City is very
ill stored with good Fish; neither did I
ever know any Sea-Town of that Con∣sequence
worse served with it: Whether
it be that the Sea wants its requisite salt∣ness,
(being rather to be esteemed brack∣ish
than salt) or that the People are not
industrious enough to take them; but I
rather believe the former.


The principal things of this Island,
and indeed of all 
Denmark,
 are the City
of 
Copenhagen,
 and the Passage of the

Sound.
 I will begin with the City, the
rather because when I have done with
that I have little more to say of any other
in the King of 
Denmark
's Dominions;
there being no other belonging to him
much better than our Town of St. 
Al∣bans.


Copenhagen
 is no ancient City, nor a
very large one; it approaches in bigness
nearest to 
Bristol
 of any of our 
English

Cities; but it increases in Buildings eve∣ry
day, notwithstanding the many dis∣couragements
it lyes under. The Forti∣fications
of it enclose a great deal more
Ground than is built upon; and many
small Buildings, which upon a further
increase of its Riches, will be pulled
down. Its Situation for Trade is one of
the best in the World, because of the ex∣cellency
of its Port; so that without doubt,
were 
Copenhagen
 a free City, it would be
the Mart and Staple of all the Traffick of
the 
Baltick.
 This Port is inclosed by the
Bulwarks of the Town, the entrance in∣to
it being so narrow, that but one Ship
can pass at a time; which entrance is e∣very
Night shut up with a strong Boom;
the Citadel on one side, and a good
Block-house well furnished with Cannon
on the other, Commands the Mouth of
it. Within this Haven rides the Navy
Royal, every Ship having his place as∣signed
to it; a wooden Gallery ranges
round the whole Inclosure where the
Fleet lies, laid over the Water in such
manner, that all the Ships may be view∣ed
near at hand as easily and commodi∣ously
as if they lay on dry Land. This


Harbour is capacious enough to hold
500 Sail, where neither Wind nor Ene∣mies
can do them the least mischief. The
Road without is very good and safe; be∣ing
fenced from the Sea by a large Sand
Bank, on the Points of which float al∣ways
a couple of Buoys to direct all
Ships that come in or go out. Here are
no Tides to fear; But always a sufficient
depth of Water: Sometimes indeed, ac∣cording
as the Winds blow in or out of
the 
Baltick,
 there sets a Current; but 'tis
not frequent, nor dangerous. To con∣clude,
this Port may justly be reckoned
in all respects one of the best in the
whole World.


The Town is strong, being situated in
a flat Marish Soil, not commanded by a∣ny
height; the Air is bad by reason of
the stink of the Channels which are cut
through it. The Works of it are only
of Earth and Sodds, yet raised accord∣ing
to the Rules of Modern Fortification,
and in tollerable good Repair. The
Buildings both in this City and elsewhere,
are generally very mean, being Cage∣work,
and having the Intervals between
the Timbers filled up with Brick. 'Tis
observable, that all the good Publick
Buildings in it, such as the 
Change, Arse∣nal,
Round-Steeple, &c.
 were built by


King 
Christian
 the Fourth, the present
King's Grandfather, and a very brave,
though not a Fortunate Prince; who did
more with less Revenues than all the
succeeding Princes; the Monarchy be∣ing
at that time neither Hereditary nor
Absolute. He used often to say, 
That
he knew the Purses of his Subjects would
be always open for his and the Kingdoms
just Occasions; and that he had rather
they were his Cash-keepers than a High∣Treasurer,
who might abuse him.
 Al∣though
the principal Decorations of this
Town are owing to him, yet he either
forgot or delay'd the Building of a Pa∣lace
for himself and his Successors, and
no Body has undertaken it since; though
certainly in no Kingdom is there greater
occasion; this King's House of Residence
being for Situation, Meanness, and Incon∣venience
the worst in the World; and as
singular for badness as the Port is for
goodness. Several of the Noblemen, as
his High Excellency 
Guldenlieu,
 the great
Admiral 
Juel,
 with others, being infinite∣ly
better lodged than the whole Royal
Family: Yet to make amends for this,
his Majesty has near him an excellent
Stable of Horses; and handsome large
Gardens, with a good Garden-House,
called 
Rosenburg,
 some distance from


the Palace, at the other end of the Town.






CHAP. III.




Of the 
Sound.




THIS Passage or Streight called
the 
Sound,
 or 
Ore-sound,
 which
has so great a Reputation in these Nor∣thern
Parts of the World, lies between
this Island of 
Zealand
 and the firm Land
of 
Schonen.
 On 
Denmark
 side, where it
is narrowest, stands the Town of 
Elsi∣nore,

and the strong Fortress of 
Cronen∣burg;

near which is a tollerable good
Road for Ships. On 
Sweden
 side is the
Town of 
Helsinburg
 with a demolished
Castle, whereof only one old Tower re∣mains,
sufficient to hold half a dozen
great Guns to repay the Salutes of Men
of War which pass through.


Betwixt these two do pass and repass
all Vessels that Trade into the 
Baltick;

so that next that of 
Gibraltar,
 one may
justly reckon this Streight the most
important and frequented of any in

Europe.
 The loss of 
Schonen,
 though it
was considerable in regard of the large∣ness


and fruitfulness of the Province, yet
it was more so in respect to the Domi∣nion
of this great Passage; for although
the 
Danes,
 by the Treaty of Peace, have
expresly retained their Title to it, and
receive Toll from all Ships that pass ex∣cept

Swedes,
 yet they do not esteem the
Security of that Title so firm as they
would wish; for being not Masters of the
Land on both sides, they may have the
Right, but not the Power to assert it
upon occasion, and seem only to enjoy
it at present according to their good Be∣haviour;
their stronger Neighbour the

Swede
 being able to make use of the first
Opportunity given him to their Preju∣dice.


This Toll, being very considerable,
and of late years occasioning many
Disputes which are not yet determined,
I thought it might not be amiss to set
down in this place, what I have learnt of
the Original and Nature of it, after ha∣ving
made as strict Enquiry as was possi∣ble
from the most ancient, and most un∣derstanding
Persons I could meet with.


The most rational Account then is,
That it was at first laid by the Consent
of the Traders into the 
Baltick,
 who
were willing to allow a small matter for
each Ship that passed, towards the main∣taining


of Lights on certain places of that
Coast, for the better direction of Sailers
in dark Nights: Hereupon this Passage of
the 
Sound
 became the most practised;
that other of the 
Great Belt
 being in a
little time quite neglected; as well be∣cause
of the great Conveniency of those
Lights to the Shipping that passed in and
out of the 
East-Sea,
 as because of an A∣greement
made that no Ships should pass
the other way, to the end that all might
pay their shares; it being unreasonable
that such Ships should have the benefit
of those Lights in dark or stormy Winter
Nights, who avoided paying towards the
maintaining of those Fires, by passing a∣nother
way. Besides, if this manner of
avoiding the Payment had been allowed,
the Revenue would have been so insigni∣ficant,
considering the small Sum which
each Ship was to pay, that the Lights
could not have been maintained by it;
and the 
Danes
 were not willing to be at
the Charge solely for the use and benefit
of their own Trading Ships, in regard
they were Masters of so few as made it
not worth their while; the 
Lubeckers,
Dantzickers,
 and Merchants of other

Hans-Towns,
 being the greatest Traders
at that time in the Northern Parts of 
Eu∣rope,



by which they arrived to a great
height of Power and Riches.


But there being no fixed Rule or Trea∣ty
whereby to be governed with regard
to the different Bulk of the Ships belong∣ing
to so many several Nations, the 
Danes

began in process of time to grow Arbi∣trary,
and exacted more or less Sums, ac∣cording
to the strength or weakness of
those they had to deal with, or accord∣ing
to their Friendship or Discontent
with those Princes and States to whom
the several Ships belonged: Therefore the
Emperor 
Charles
 the Fifth, to ascertain
this Toll, concluded a Treaty with the
King of 
Denmark,
 which was signed at

Spire
 on the 
Rhine,
 and was in behalf of
his Subjects of the Seventeen Provinces
of the 
Low Countries,
 who had great
Traffick in the 
Baltick;
 and agreed that
as a Toll-Custom in the 
Sound,
 every
Ship of 200 Tuns and under, should pay
two 
Rose Nobles
 at its Entrance or Return
from the 
Baltick,
 and every Ship above
200 Tuns three 
Rose Nobles.


This Agreement remained in force till
such time as the 
United Provinces
 shook
off the 
Spanish
 Yoak, and then the 
Danes

taking the advantage of those Wars, rai∣sed
their Toll to an extravagant height,
the troublesome Times not affording lei∣sure


to the 
Dutch
 to mind the redressing
of such a Mischief.


However, about the Year 1600. they
joined themselves with the City of 
Lu∣beck,

in opposition to such an exorbitant
Toll as was taken from both of them; so
that from thenceforth the 
Dutch
 paid
more or less, according as Fortune was
favourable or adverse to them, but gene∣rally
little.


Anno
 1647. the first Treaty was made
between 
Denmark
 and the 
United Pro∣vinces

(as Soveraigns) for this Toll; and
they were obliged to pay a certain Sum
for each Ship; this Treaty was to last
Forty years; after the expiration of
which, if in the mean time no new Trea∣ty
were made, that of 
Spire
 was to be
in force.


This Treaty of 1647. expired 1687.
and the 
Danes
 agreed to make an 
interim

Treaty, till such time as the many Dif∣ferences
between them and the 
Hollan∣ders

in this and other Matters could be
adjusted at leisure, and concluded in a
more lasting and solemn one.


This 
interim
 Treaty, which was but
for Four years, expired in the Year 1691.
so that no new Treaty being made and
finished during that time, it is evident


that only the ancient Treaty of 
Spire
 re∣mains
in force, and no other.


The 
English
 Treaties with 
Denmark

are grounded on those between the 
Dutch

and that Kingdom, and have reference
to them; with a Covenant that we shall
be treated 
tanquam gens amicissima;
 ex∣cepting
always 
Sweden,
 whose Ships pay
no Toll at all.


So that at present both the 
English

and 
Dutch
 have occasion for new Trea∣ties
with 
Denmark
 in this and other Af∣fairs
of Trade, unless it be agreed by all
Parties that the Treaty of 
Spire
 shall for
so much remain in vigour hereafter.


From this short History of the Origi∣nal
of this Imposition it appears, how
slightly grounded the King of 
Denmark
's
Title is to this Right of exacting the Toll
of the 
Sound;
 which from an easie Con∣tribution
which Merchants chose to pay
for their own Convenience, and whereof
the King of 
Denmark
 was only Treasu∣rer
or Trustee, to see it fairly laid out
for the common use, is grown to be a
heavy Imposition upon Trade, as well as
a kind of servile acknowledgment of his
Sovereignty of those Seas; and is pure∣ly
owing to his taking an Advantage
of the Difficulties of the 
Hollanders
 du∣ring
their Wars with 
Spain,
 and the


Connivance of King 
James
 the First in
prejudice of the 
English;
 who favoured
the 
Danes
 upon account of his Marriage
to a Daughter of that Crown; upon
whose two Examples all the lesser States
were forced to submit. Nor can it be
conceived how it could be otherwise
brought about; since it is very well
known, that the Passage of the 
Sound
 is
not the only one to the 
Baltick
 Sea, there
being two others called the 
Greater
 and

Lesser Belts;
 and that of the 
Greater
Belt
 so commodious and large, that du∣ring
the late Wars the whole 
Dutch
 Fleet
chose to pass through it, and continue in
it for four or five Months together; and
the 
Danish
 Strength at Sea never appeared
yet so formidable as to be able to oblige
the 
English
 and 
Dutch
 to choose, which
Passage it pleased: Besides, the breadth
of the 
Sound
 in the narrowest part is
four 
English
 Miles over; and every
where of a sufficient depth; so that
his Castles could not Command the
Channel when he was Master of both
sides; much less now that he has but one.
So that it is plain, this pretended Sove∣reignty
is very precarious, being partly
founded on a Breach of Trust, as well as
the Carelesness of some of the Princes
concerned in it, to the great Injury of


Trade: And the 
Spaniards
 may, with as
much right, lay claim to the Sovereignty
of the 
Streights
 of 
Gibralter,
 where there
is but one Passage; or the 
Swede,
 who is
now Master of one of the Castles on the

Sound,
 demand another Toll of all Ships,
since both are better able to support their
Claims.


For the further clearing of this Point,
and to shew how it agrees with the Ac∣count
I have already given, I have
thought fit to insert in this place the Co∣py
of a Letter from a very understand∣ing
Person, 
March
 31. 1691.




SIR,


THE Duties or Customs in the 
Sound

were of old times no more than a

Rose Noble
 for each Ship, Loading inclu∣ded;
but within these hundred Years, some
say since King 
James
 of 
Scotland
 came to
the Crown of 
England,
 and winked at it,
the Kings of 
Denmark
 having the Lands
on both sides the Passage, began to impose
Taxes on the Merchandize, and raise high∣er
those which were formerly on the Ships;
which the 
Lubeckers,
 who were then pow∣erful,
refused to pay.


Anno 1640.
 the King caused a Book of
Rates to be printed, whereof I have one,
according to which a Ship of 
100
 Lasts,


or 
200
 Tuns, (which is the same thing,) did
pay as followeth: For 
100
 Last of Salt to
the East 
300 Rix Dollars;
 for the Ship
and petty Charges on the Salt 
34 Rix
Dollars, 24 Stivers;
 and for 
100
 Last of
Rye from the East 
150 R. D.
 for Ship and
petty Charges, as above, 
34 R. D. 24 Sti∣vers.

So that the Charges of a Ship of
this Burden, with its Lading forward and
backward was 
519 Rix Dollars.


Hereupon the 
Hollanders
 made an Al∣liance
with the 
Swedes,
 who 
Anno 1643.

by the way of 
Germany
 invaded 
Den∣mark,

and the 
Dutch
 lent them Ships;
then the King Prints another Book of Rates
more favourable, demanding for 
100
 Last
of 
Spanish
 Salt 
100 Rix Dollars,
 for 
100

Last of Rye 
75 R. D.
 Ships Charges in
and out, as above, 
69 R. D.
 the whole a∣mounting
to 
244 R. D.
 But this was nei∣ther
done time enough, nor the Rates low∣ered
enough. The 
Hollanders,
 by their
Treaty with 
Denmark
 of 
1646.
 or there∣abouts,
brought them thus, The 
100
 Last
of Salt to 
50 Rix Dollars, 100
 Last of
Rye to 
50 R. D.
 Ships, and other petty
Charges, nothing: in all for each Ship 
100
Rix Dollars.
 And by reason of this un∣timely
heightning of their Customs it is,
that the Kings of 
Denmark
 have lost so
many Territories to the 
Swedes.


But to Answer your Demand more fully,
it was in those days, that is, about the
Year 
1640.
 that the Customs of the 
Ore∣Sound

yielded 
per Ann.
 from 
240000 Rix
Dollars
 to 
300000 R. D.
 But since 
1645.

they have not at any time render'd above

150000 R. D.
 nor ever so much, except
in time of War with the 
Swedes,
 when all
did pay without Exemption. During the
last War, I remember it yielded but

143000 Rix Dollars;
 but before that
War, and since (the 
Swedish
 Ships free∣ing
all Goods that are carried in them, and
the 
Swedish
 Goods in Forreign Ships being
also free by Treaty) it has not yielded a∣bove

80000 Rix Dollars per Annum;

and the last Year past it did not reach to
full 
70000 Rix Dollars.




The Court of 
Denmark
 is not to be
blamed therefore for being wonderful
jealous of any Infraction of this their pre∣tended
Sovereignty, as People are most
careful and suspicious in behalf of an
Estate wherein their Title is weak, it
being so much the Interest not only of the

English
 and 
Dutch,
 but also of the 
Swede,

to have it set right, both to encourage
Trade to his own Country, and to les∣sen
the Revenue of his Neighbour; nei∣ther
can it be said, that the 
English
 and



Dutch
 did ever intirely yield the Point;
for though they agreed to pay a small
Toll on Merchandize, yet no manner of
searching or stopping is to be allowed,
or has ever been. The 
Danes
 are now
obliged to take the Master of the Ves∣sel's
word for the quality and quantity of
the Lading; and thought it prudence
never to press this Point further, least we
should grow angry, and make too nar∣row
an Inspection both into their Origi∣nal
Right, and into their Ability to main∣tain
it: For whilst we and the 
Dutch
 are
content to pay this Toll, all the other
petty Princes and States do it without
Murmur, but if we once broke the Chain,
they would shake off their part of it like∣wise.






CHAP. IV.




Of the other Islands, and 
Jutland.




THE most considerable Islands next
to that of 
Zealand,
 are, 
Funen
 or

Fionia, Laland, Langland, Falstria,
Mune, Samsoe, Arroe, Bornholm,
 and

Amack;
 there are besides many other
small ones of less note.


Funen
 is second to 
Zealand,
 whether
its bigness or the goodness of its Soil be
considered; it has plenty of Corn, Hogs,
Lakes, and Woods; the chief Town of
it is 
Odensee,
 a well-seated, and former∣ly
a flourishing little City, but at pre∣sent
much fallen to decay. This Island
produces nothing for the Merchant to
export, except some few Horses, the In∣habitants
usually consuming their own
Commodities. This is a principal Go∣vernment,
called a 
Stifts Ampt.
 The
present Governour is Mr. 
Winterfelt.


Laland
 is a small, but plentiful Island,
producing all sorts of Corn in abun∣dance,
and particularly Wheat, where∣with
it supplies the City of 
Copenhagen,

and all other parts of 
Denmark,
 where
it is a rarity. The 
Hollanders
 buy
yearly, and ship off great quantities of
Corn from hence. This likewise is a

Stifts Ampt,
 having several of the lesser
Islands under its Jurisdiction. The Go∣vernour
of it is Mr. 
Geugh,
 who for∣merly
had a Publick Character, and re∣sided
a long time in 
England.


Falstria, Langland,
 and 
Mune
 are fer∣tile
Islands; the two first Export yearly
some Corn. 
Arroe
 and 
Alsen
 abound in

Annis-seeds,
 which are much used to sea∣son
their Meat, and mix with their


Bread. 
Bornholm, Samsoe,
 with the o∣ther
Islands, nourish Cattle, and afford
Corn for the use of the Inhabitants. But

Amack
 deserves to be particularly re∣membred;
this little Island joyns close
to the City of 
Copenhagen,
 from which
'tis only separated by a small Arm of
the Sea, which is passed over by a
Draw-bridge, and exceeds in fruitfulness
any spot of Ground in 
Denmark.
 This
Land was given many Years ago to
several Families of 
North Hollanders,

who were planted there to make But∣ter
and Cheese for the Court; the De∣scendants
of whom retain to this day
the Habit, Language, and Customs of
their Predecessors, together with their
Cleanliness and Industry; neither will
they mix with the 
Danes,
 but inter∣marry
with each other. They had for∣merly
extraordinary Priviledges granted
to them, whereof some continue to this
time, but others are retrenched; and
by degrees it is to be feared they
will be treated like the other Subjects.


This Island of 
Amaek,
 through the In∣dustry
of these laborious People, is as it
were the Kitchen-Garden of 
Copenhagen,

and supplies its Markets plentifully with
all sorts of Roots and Herbs; besides
Butter, Milk, great quantities of Corn,


and some Hay; whatever it produces be∣ing
the best in its kind that is to be found
in the whole Kingdom.


Jutland,
 part of the ancient 
Cimbrica
Chersonesus,
 is the biggest part of the
Kingdom of 
Denmark,
 and may amount
to about two thirds of the whole. It is
divided into four 
Stifts Ampts,
 or prin∣cipal
Governments. The present Go∣vernours
are, the Count 
de Frize,
 the
upper Mareschal 
Speckhan,
 Monsieur

Edmund Schele,
 now Envoy Extraordi∣nary
to his Majesty from the King of

Denmark, &c.


This is a plentiful Country, a∣bounding
more especially in Cattle;
it wants good Sea-Ports towards the
Ocean, notwithstanding which the 
Hol∣landers

transport yearly great quan∣tities
of lean Cows and Oxen from hence
to their more fertile Soil, where in a
short time they grow so prodigiously
fat, through better feeding, in the rich
Grounds of 
Holland,
 that a vast Profit
is made by this Traffick. The Horses
and Swine of this Country are excel∣lent,
and in great numbers. It affords
Corn in sufficient quantity for the use
of its own People. The Land is more
Fertile near the Sea-Coasts; the Inland
being full of Heaths, Lakes, and Woods.


In short, it is the best Country the
King of 
Denmark
 is Master of, and ap∣pears
to be least declining, because
most remote from 
Copenhagen.—
Procul à Jove, Procul à Fulmine.
 It be∣ing
observed, that in limited Monar∣chies
and Commonwealths, a Neighbour∣hood
to the Seat of the Government, is
advantageous to the Subjects, whilst the
distant Provinces are less thriving, and
more liable to Oppression: but in Arbi∣trary
and Tyrannical Kingdoms the
quite contrary happens.






CHAP. V.




Of the rest of the King of 
Den∣mark
's
Countries.




THE Dutchy of 
Sleswick
 is in ge∣neral
a very good Country; its
convenient Situation between two Seas,
the Ocean and the 
Baltick,
 rendring it
considerable for Trade, although the
natural Commodities, fit for Exportati∣on,
are in no great quantity. Some
Corn, Cattle, Horses, and Wood for
Firing it affords to its Neighbours, over
and above a sufficient store of each for
its own Inhabitants. It is divided be∣tween


the King and the Duke of 
Hol∣stein.

The principal Town which gives
Name to the Dutchy, belongs to the
Duke of 
Holstein,
 who resides near it
in his Palace of 
Gottorp,
 one of the
most delicious Seats that is to be seen
in all the Northern Parts of 
Eu∣rope;

nothing can be more Pleasant
and Romantick than the Situation of
this Castle. It stands in an Island, sur∣rounded
by a large Lake made by the
River 
Sley,
 whose rising Banks are cloth∣ed
with fine Woods, the Waters clear
and full of Fish, carry Vessels of small
Burden to and from the 
Baltick
 Sea, in∣to
which it empties it self. The Gar∣dens
are large, with great Cost and Art
cut out of the diclivity of a Hill on the
other side the Lake, and are as well dis∣sposed
and laid out with Fountains, Par∣terres,
Walks, and Water-works as many
of the most famous 
Villa
's in 
Italy.
 A
noble large Park, or rather Forest, full
of Deer, Wild-boars, and all sorts of
Game, joyns close to this Garden, cut
through with pleasant Walks and Ridings.


This Residence of the Duke of 
Hol∣stein

suffered much during the Misfor∣tunes
of its Master; many of the Im∣provements
being not only suffer'd to
run to ruine and decay, but industrious∣ly


and as some say, by order, pull'd
down and destroyed; which at present,
since the Re-establishment of the Duke,
are repairing and restoring to their for∣mer
Splendour. Among several other
things of value, none had better luck
than an admirable Library, being a
choice Collection of Books which many
Dukes of 
Holstein
 had of a long time
been gathering; this escaped, and in the
Year 1692. I saw it with the rest of the
Rarities of this place in a good Condi∣tion,
and tending to a better.


Holstein
 is divided among several of
the Branches of that Family, all whose
Descendants call themselves Dukes of

Holstein;
 and according to the 
German

Custom, (as well younger Brothers as
elder) assume the Title and Quality
of Princes: only the chief and estated
Men of these several Branches are di∣stinguished
by the Additional Title of
the Place of their Residence; as the
Duke of 
Holstein Ploen, Holstein Sun∣derburg,
Holstein, Norburg, &c.
 the 
Ca∣dets

of each, contenting themselves with
the bare Title of Princes, till they come
to be Proprietors of Land; whose De∣nomination
they may add to that of
Duke. But the King of 
Denmark,
 (who
is likewise Duke of 
Holstein
) and the


Duke of 
Holstein Gottorp,
 are possessed
of the greatest part of it, and both hold
it as a Fief of the Empire.


Here, as well as in 
Sleswick,
 the Ju∣risdictions
and Interests of these two
Princes are very much intermixed; so
that the People scarce know whose Sub∣jects
to reckon themselves, since they
often swear Allegiance, and pay Tribute
to both. In some Towns and Balliages
both the King and Duke elect the Year∣ly
Magistrates, and divide the Reve∣nue;
in others they do this by turns:
So that upon any Quarrel or Difference
between these two Princes, the poor
People are strangely divided, and in a
most miserable Condition; their Incli∣nation
leading them to the Duke's In∣terest,
who being the weaker, finds it
his Advantage to use them better; but
their fear causing them to appear for
the King as the stronger, though more
Arbitrary.


This Country is very fruitful and
pleasant; excellently well seated for
Trade, lying between the two Seas, and
having the advantage of the Neighbour∣hood
of the River 
Elbe,
 and of 
Ham∣burg;

which being a free City, and
consequently a rich one, imparts a large
share of its Blessings to the Territories


of those Princes which lie any thing
near it. This is apparent enough in
the visible Prosperity of such Lands and
People as are within a Day's Journey or
more of that City, above such as lie
remote from its Influence. The Inha∣bitants
of 
Holstein
 use to brag that it
resembles 
England
 in its variety of Hills,
Meadows, Woods, Rivers, and Corn∣fields;
as also that we are beholding to
them and their Neighbourhood for our
Original; the People of those Parts
called 
Angles,
 having planted, and at the
same time given the Name of 
Anglia
 to
our Island.


The 
Danes,
 when they travel abroad,
choose to call themselves 
Holsteiners,

thinking it more honourable to be born
within the Confines of the Empire, than
otherwise.


Stormar
 and 
Ditmarsh
 lie the nearest
to the River 
Elbe,
 and are for the most
part low and rich Countries, the Soil being
fat, and in most places resembling 
Hol∣land,

as well in its Fertility as manner
of Improvement. These Countries en∣joy
also the benfit of having 
Hamburg

and the River near them, with the ad∣ditional
Advantage of the Ocean; though
it sometimes proves too troublesome a
Neighbour, and overflows great part of


their lower Grounds, notwithstanding
the Banks and Digues that are raised to
keep it out.


'Tis to be noted as a great natural de∣fect,
that the King of 
Denmark
 has not
in all his Dominions one Navigable Ri∣ver
for Vessels of any considerable Bur∣den
(for I do not count the River 
Ey∣der

as such) unless we reckon the 
Elbe,

which is rather to be esteemed one of
the Confines and Boundaries of his
Territories, than any way belonging to
him; yet he has often, and does even
to this day, endeavour to set up and e∣stablish
a Toll at 
Glucstadt,
 being not
without hopes, that taking the advan∣tage
of the Necessity of the Empire, du∣ring
this expensive War, he may engage
it to consent to this Toll against all other
Considerations: But the Neighbouring
Princes, the 
English
 and 
Dutch,
 and a∣bove
all the City of 
Hamburg,
 will
hardly be brought over to comply with
an Innovation so prejudicial to their
Trade and Interests.


Oldenburg
 for the most part is a flat
Marish Country; much exposed to the In∣undations
of the Ocean; the Banks which
should keep it in its due Bounds, not be∣ing
maintained in good repair. It a∣bounds
in Cattle, and has a good Breed


of Horses, which are much sought after
for Coaches, by reason of their Colour,
which is a yellowish Cream Colour.
They are generally wall-ey'd, and ten∣der-hoof'd,
not able to last long, or en∣dure
hard labour. The Town of 
Olden∣burg

is but a very indifferent one, and
its Castle much out of Repair. Upon
the Death of the late Prince 
Anthony,
 this
County came to be annexed to the
Crown of 
Denmark.


Delmenhorst
 is a more rising Ground,
and pretty well wooded. Both these lye
together, and the Inhabitants are used the
more gently, by reason of their distance
from his other Territories.


Of 
Norway
 little can be said; but that
it is divided into two great Provinces,
the 
Southern
 and 
Northern;
 whereof one
small County, called 
Yempterland,
 for∣merly
belonging to the King of 
Denmark,

is now in the Possession of the 
Swedes.

His High Excellency 
Guldenlieu
 (which
is the Title usually given him by the

Danes
) is 
Vice-Roy,
 or as they call
him 
Stadt holder
 of the whole. It is
sub-divided into four 
Stifts Ampts,
 or
Principal Governments; 
Viz. Dronthem,
Bergen, Christiania,
 and 
Larwick.
 The
Governours are young 
Guldenlieu,
 natu∣ral
Son to the present King, and Mon∣sieur



Stocfleet
 late Envoy extraordinary
from 
Denmark
 to 
Sweden, &c..
 It is a ve∣ry
barren Country, affording neither
Corn nor Cattle sufficient for the sub∣sistance
of its Inhabitants, although they
be not numerous in proportion to its
vast extent. There are Silver Mines in
it, but whether the working of them
turns to account is a question. The Com∣modities
which it yields fit for Exportati∣on
are Timber of all kinds,
 especially
Firr, Stockfish, Masts for Ships, and I∣ron;
of these it has a tolerable store; most
of which the 
English
 and 
Dutch
 purchase
yearly with ready Money: And herein

Norway
 exceeds the other Dominions of
the King of 
Denmark,
 that it affords Com∣modities
for Exportation, which none of
the rest do in any quantity. The Inha∣bitants
are a hardy, laborious, and ho∣nest
sort of People; they are esteemed
by others, and esteem themselves much
superiour to the 
Danes,
 whom they call
upbraidingly 
Jutes.


Island
 and 
Feroe
 are miserable Islands
in the North Ocean; Corn will scarce
grow in either of them, but they have
good stocks of Cattle. No Trade is per∣mitted
them but with the 
Danes;
 the
Inhabitants are great Players at 
Chess.
 It
were worth some curious Mans enquiry


how such a studious and difficult Game
should get thus far Northward, and be∣come
so generally used.


The King of 
Denmark
's Factories in
the 
East
 and 
West-Indies,
 and in 
Guinea

are esteemed of very little worth and
consideration; yet I have seen several

East-India
 Ships return home to 
Copen∣hagen

well laden with the Merchandize
of those Countries; and there is an

East-India
 Company lately set up, where∣of
most of the Men of Quality are Mem∣bers
and Adventurers: But whether the
Lading of those Ships I mentioned were
the lawful Product of Trade, or acqui∣red
by other means, will in time be
worth the inquiry of those Kingdoms and
States whose Interest it is to preserve in
the 
Indians
 and 
Persians
 a good Opinion
of the honesty and fair dealing of the 
Eu∣ropeans.


And thus I have said as much as I
think requisite touching the Situation,
Extent, and Qualities of the Lands and
Dominions belonging to the King of

Denmark,
 which amounts in general to
this, that they are very large, disjoined,
and intermixt, producing but a mode∣rate
Plenty of Necessaries for the Inha∣bitants,
but few Commodities for the
Merchant, and no Manufactures, if we


except a little Iron. Whether these De∣fects
in Countries well situated and in∣different
fertile be altogether natural or
partly accidental, will better appear when
I treat of the Form of the Government,
and the present Condition, Customs, and
Manners of the Natives; but because
these last do in a manner depend upon,
and are influenced by the former, I shall
choose to begin with it.






CHAP. VI.




Of their Form of Government.




THE Ancient Form of Govern∣ment
here was the same which the

Goths
 and 
Vandals
 e∣stablished
in most,
 if
not all, Parts of 
Eu∣rope,

whither they
carried their Con∣quests,
and which in

England
 is retained
to this day for the
most part. 'Tis said
of the 
Romans,
 That
those Provinces which they Conquer'd
were amply recompenced, for the loss


of their Liberty, by being reduced from
their Barbarity to Civility; by the Intro∣duction
of Arts, Learning, Commerce,
and Politeness. I know not whether
this manner of Arguing hath not more
of Pomp than Truth in it; but with
much greater reason may it be said that
all 
Europe
 was beholding to these People
for introducing or restoring a Constituti∣on
of Government far excelling all others
that we know of in the World. 'Tis to
the ancient Inhabitants of these Countries,
with other neighbouring Provinces, that
we owe the Original of Parliaments, for∣merly
so common, but lost within this
last Age in all Kingdoms but those of 
Po∣land,
Great Britain,
 and 
Ireland.


Denmark
 therefore was till within these
Two and Thirty years governed by a
King chosen by the People of all sorts,
even the Boors had their Voices, which
King 
Waldemar
 the Third acknowledged
in that memorable answer of his to the
Popes 
Nuncio,
 who pretended to a great
power over him. 
Naturam habemus à
Deo, regnum à subditis, Divitias à paren∣tibus,
Religionem à Romana Ecclesia;
quam si nobis invides, renuntiamus per prae∣sentes.

The Estates of the Realm being
convened to that intent, were to Elect
for their Prince such a Person as to them


appeared Personable, Valiant, Just, Mer∣ciful,
Affable, a Maintainer of the Laws,
a Lover of the People, Prudent, and A∣dorned
with all other Vertues fit for Go∣vernment,
and requisite for the great
Trust reposed in him; yet with due re∣gard
had to the Family of the preceding
Kings. If within that Line they found
a Person thus qualified, or esteemed to
be so, they thought it but a piece of just
Gratitude to prefer him before any other
to this high Dignity, and were pleased
when they had reason to choose the Eld∣est
Son of their former King, rather than
any of the younger, as well because they
had regard to Priority of Birth, when all
other Vertues were equal, as because the
greatness of his Paternal Estate might
put him above the reach of Temptations
to be covetous or dishonest, and inable
him in some degree to support the Dig∣nity
of his Office. But if after such a
Choice they found themselves mistaken,
and that they had advanced a Cruel, Vi∣tious,
Tyrannical, Covetous, or Waste∣ful
Person, they frequently Deposed him,
oftentimes Banished, sometimes Destroy∣ed
him; and this either formally, by
making him Answer before the Repre∣sentative
Body of the People; or if by ill
Practices, such as making of Parties, le∣vying


of Soldiers, contracting of Alli∣ances
to support himself in opposition to
the Peoples Rights, he was grown too
powerful to be legally contended with,
they dispatched him without any more
Ceremony the best way they could, and
Elected presently a better Man in his
room; sometimes the next of Kin to
him, sometimes the Valiant Man that
had exposed himself so far as to under∣take
the Expulsion or the killing of the
Tyrant; at other times a private Person
of a good Reputation, who possibly least
dreamt of such an Advancement.


Frequent Meetings of the Estates was
a part of the very Fundamental Consti∣tution:
In those Meetings all Matters
relating to good Government were trans∣acted;
good Laws were enacted, all Af∣fairs
belonging to Peace or War, Allian∣ces,
disposal of great Offices, Contracts
of Marriages for the Royal Family, 
&c.

were debated. The imposing of Taxes,
or demanding of Benevolences was pure∣ly
accidental; no constant Tribute be∣ing
ever paid, nor any Money levied on
the People, unless either to maintain a
necessary War with the advice and con∣sent
of the Nation, or now and then
by way of Free-gift, to help to raise a
Daughters Portion: the King's ordinary


Revenue at that time consisting only in
the Rents of his Lands and Demesnes, in
his Herds of Cattle, Forests, Services
of Tenants in manuring and cultivating
his 
Grounds, &c.
 Customs upon Merchan∣dize
being an Imposition of late crept in∣to
this part of the World; so that he
lived like one of our Modern Noblemen,
upon the Revenues of his own Estate,
and eat not through the Sweat of his Sub∣jects
Brows.


His business was to see a due and im∣partial
Administration of Justice execu∣ted
according to the Laws; nay, often
to sit and do it himself; to be watchful
and vigilant for the welfare of his Peo∣ple,
to Command in Person their Ar∣mies
in time of War, to encourage In∣dustry,
Religion, Arts and Learning;
and it was his Interest, as well as Duty,
to keep fair with his Nobility and Gen∣try,
and to be careful of the Plenty and
Prosperity of his Commons.


This was the Ancient Form of Go∣vernment
in this Kingdom, which con∣tinued
with very little variation (except∣ing
that the Power of the Nobles encrea∣sed
too much) till about Two and Thirty
years ago, when at one instant the whole
Face of Affairs was changed: So that the
Kings have ever since been, and at pre∣sent


are, Absolute and Arbitrary; not
the least remnant of Liberty remaining
to the Subject; all Meetings of the E∣states
in Parliament intirely abolished,
nay, the very Name of Estates and Liber∣ty
quite forgotten, as if there never had
been any such thing; the very first and
principal Article in the present 
Danish

Law being, 
That the King has the Privi∣ledge
reserved to himself to explain the
Law, nay, to alter and change it as he
shall find good.


It is easie for any considering Person
to guess the Consequences of this, which
are, frequent and arbitrary Taxes, and
commonly very excessive ones, even in
Times of Peace; little regard being had
to the Occasion of them: So that the va∣lue
of Estates in most parts of the King∣dom
is fallen three Fourths. And it is
worse near the Capital City under the
Eye and Hand of the Government, than
in remoter Provinces: Poverty in the
Gentry, which necessarily causes extre∣mity
of Misery in the Peasants, Partiali∣ty
in the distribution of Justice when
Favourites are concerned; with many o∣ther
Mischiefs which shall be hereafter
more particularly mentioned; being the
constant Effects of Arbitrary Rule in this
and all other Countries wherein it has
prevailed.


And because it is astonishing to consi∣der
how a free and rich People (for so
they were formerly) should be perswa∣ded
intirely to part with their Liberties,
I thought it very proper to give an ac∣count
by what steps so great a Change
and Revolution was brought about: The
Particulars of which I have received not
only from Eye-witnesses, but also from
some of the principal Promoters and
Actors in it.






CHAP. VII.




The Manner how the Kingdom of

Denmark
 became Hereditary and
Absolute.




AFTER the Conclusion of the
Peace between the two Northern
Crowns 
Anno
 1660. some considerable
care and time was necessary to redress
the Disorders occasioned by so terrible a
War. 
Denmark
 had been most violently
shaken; and although the Fury of the
Tempest was over, the Agitation caused
by it still continued: The Army was not
yet disbanded, nor could be for want of
Money to discharge its Arrears; this


caused frequent Insolencies in the Soldi∣ers,
with a further Oppression of the
Burgers and poor Country People, who
had been in a manner already ruined by
the Miseries attending the War. The
Nobility, though Lords and Masters, were
full of Discontents, and the Clergy not
in the condition they wished.


To redress all which Grievances, and
reduce Affairs into some Order, by pro∣curing
Money for the Payment and Dis∣banding
of the Army, the King thought
fit to appoint a Meeting of the Three
Estates at 
Copenhagen, viz
 the Nobility,
Commonalty, and Clergy; which ac∣cordingly
followed about the beginning
of 
October:
 After some few days Sessi∣on
(during which the Nobility, accord∣ing
to their usual practice debated how
the Sums of Money requisite might with
greatest ease and conveniency be levied
upon the Commons, without the least,
intention of bearing any proportionable
share themselves.) Several Disputes a∣rose,
and many sharp Expressions passed
between them and the Commons; on the
one hand the Nobility were for main∣taining
their ancient Prerogative of pay∣ing
nothing by way of Tax, but only
by voluntary Contribution; and shew∣ed
themselves too stiff at a time when


the Country was exhausted, and most
of the remaining Riches lodged in their
hands: They seemed to make use of this
Occasion, not only to vindicate, but e∣ven
to widen and enlarge their Privi∣ledges
above the other two Estates, by
laying Impositions on them at pleasure,
which weight they themselves would not
touch with one of their Fingers any
further, than as they thought fitting. On
the other hand, the Clergy
 for their
late adherance to the interest of their
Country, and the Burgers for the vi∣gorous
Defence of their City, thought
they might justly pretend to new Merit,
and be considered at least as good Sub∣jects
in a State, which they themselves
had so valiantly defended. They re∣membred
the great Promises made them
when dangerous Enterprises were to be
taken in hand, and how successfully they
had executed them; thereby saving from
a Forreign Yoak, not only the City of

Copenhagen,
 but the whole Kingdom, the
Royal Family, nay those very Nobles
that now dealt so hardly with them:
They judged it therefore reasonable, that
the Sums of Money necessary should be
levied proportionably, and that the No∣bility
who enjoyed all the Lands, should
at least pay their share of the Taxes,


since they had suffered less in the com∣mon
Calamity, as well as done less to
prevent the progress of it.


This manner of arguing was very dis∣pleasing
to the Nobles, and begat much
Heat and many bitter Replies on both
sides: At length a principal Senator cal∣led

Otto Craeg,
 stood up, and in great
Anger told the President of the City,
That the Commons neither understood
nor considered the Priviledges of the No∣bility,
who at all times had been exemp∣ted
from Taxes, nor the true Conditi∣on
of themselves, who were no other
than Slaves; [the word in the 
Danish
 is

unfree
] so that their best way was to
keep within their own Bounds, and ac∣quiesce
in such Measures as ancient Pra∣ctice
had warranted, and which they
were resolved to maintain. This word

Slaves
 put all the Burgers and Clergy in
disorder, causing a loud Murmur in the
Hall; which 
Nanson
 the President of the
City of 
Copenhagen,
 and Speaker of the
House of Commons, perceiving, and
finding a fit occasion of putting in pra∣ctice
a Design before concerted (though
but weakly) between him and the Bi∣shop;
in great Choler rose out of his
Seat, and swore an Oath, 
That the
Commons were no Slaves, nor would from


thenceforth be called so by the Nobility,
which they should soon prove to their cost:

And thereupon breaking up the Assem∣bly
in disorder, and departing out of the
Hall, was followed by all the Clergy and
Burgers; the Nobles being left alone to
consult among themselves at their lei∣sure,
after a little while adjourned to a
private House near the Court. In the
mean time the Commons, being provo∣ked
to the highest degree, and resolving
to put their Threats in Execution, march∣ed
processionally by Couples, a Clergy∣man
and a Commoner, from the great
Hall or Parliament-House to the 
Brew∣ers-Hall,

which was the convenientest
place they could pitch upon to sit apart
from the Nobles, the Bishop of 
Copen∣hagen,

and the President of the City
leading them: It was there thought ne∣cessary
to consider speedily of the most
effectual Means to suppress the intolera∣ble
Pride of the Nobility, and how to
mend their own Condition: After many
Debates they concluded, That they
should immediately wait upon the King,
and offer him their Votes and Assistance
to be absolute Monarch of the Realm,
as also that the Crown should descend
by inheritance to his Family, which hi∣therto
had gone by Election. They


promised themselves the King would have
so great Obligations to them for this
piece of Service, that he would grant
and confirm such Priviledges, as should
put them above the degree of Slaves.
They knew he had hitherto been curbed
by the Nobility to a great Measure; and
now saw their own force, being able
(since they had Arms in their Hands,
and the concurrence of the Soldiers)
to perform what they undertook: At
the worst, they supposed they should
only change many Masters for one, and
could better bear hardships from a King
than from inferiour Persons: Or if their
Case were not better'd, at least they
thought it some comfort to have more
Company in it; besides the satisfaction
of Revenge on those that had hitherto
not only used them ill, but insulted over
them so lately. They knew the King,
and had seen him bear with an admira∣ble
Patience and Constancy all his Cala∣mities;
were perswaded that he was a
Valiant Prince, who had often exposed
his Person for the sake of the Publick,
and therefore thought they could never
do enough to shew their Gratitude;
which is the usual Temper of the People
upon any benefit received from their
Prince.


Scarce was this proposed but it was
agreed to; and nothing but the unsea∣sonableness
of the time, (it being now
near night) deferred the immediate Exe∣cution
of it; but all the necessary Mea∣sures
were taken against next Morn∣ing.
The Clergy had a further drift in
this Change of Government; for ha∣ving
been hitherto kept under by the
Nobility, they forecasted to have no o∣ther
Superior but the King, whose new
Authority they engaged to maintain by
the influence they had on the Consciences
of the People; expecting with reason
the like Favour and Protection from the
King, together with an encrease of their
Power; since he was in a great measure
obliged to them for his own; and the be∣nefits
were likely to be mutual for the
future, the one having the force, the o∣ther
the tye of Religion in their Possessi∣on.
Which Contract subsists to this ve∣ry
day, to the great advantage of both
sides.


The Court all this while was not ig∣norant
of what passed; there wanted no
Spies nor Messengers to give notice of
the Discontents of the Commons, 
Han∣nibal
Seestede,
 a cunning Man, was
prime Minister; and the Bishop or Su∣perintendent

Swan,
 with 
Nanson
 the


Speaker of the House of Commons, were
his Creatures: These had formerly in
secret laid with him the Design, which
was now upon the point of disclosing,
though their hopes were hardly raised
so high, as to promise themselves such
mighty Success. The whole Night pas∣sed
in Brigues and Messages, the Com∣mons
anger was to be kept up to the
requisite height, and the Resolution they
had taken the Night before not to be
suffer'd to cool, but persisted in betimes
next Morning. The Queen, a Woman
of Intrigue and high Spirit, wrought
strongly in it by all manner of ways,
whilst the King, either through doubt
of the Event, or sense of the Dishonesty
and Crime of the Action, in procuring
after such a manner the absolute Domi∣nion
of a free Country, could hardly be
brought to comply with it. He decla∣red
that indeed he should be pleased the
Soveraignty were entailed on his Fami∣ly,
provided it were done by Universal
Consent; but to become Absolute and
Arbitrary, was neither his desire, nor did
he think it for the benefit of the King∣dom;
that he was satisfied he should not
make ill use of such an unlimited Autho∣rity;
but no body knew what Successors
he might have; that it was therefore


dangerous both for them to give, and
for him to receive such a Power as might
be abused in future times to the utter ruin
of the Nation. But these Reflections,
whether they were real, or only preten∣ces,
whether caused by the Piety or
Weakness of the King, were soon over∣ruled
by the more Ambitious and Mas∣culine
Spirit of the Queen, who desired
him to sit still, and see how she and her
Emissaries would work for him; told
him, That the Plot was well laid, and
had begun to operate prosperously; that
he must not obstruct his own and his Fa∣milies
good Fortune; and in fine, so far
prevailed on him, that he seemed with
fear to consent to, and permit that which
most think he very much desired: Ha∣ving
however by this shew of unwilling∣ness,
left open to himself a door of Re∣conciliation
with his People, in case the
business did not succeed.


All this while the Nobles either had
none, or but small intimation of the De∣signs
of the Commons, they had been
used so long to slight and tyrannize over
them, that they were not now sensible
of any impending danger from thence,
contemning their Threats as well as their
Persons, and imagining they would have
repented next day, and complied with


all that should be demanded of them; but
the Plot was deeper laid than they sup∣posed;
for not only the prime Minister,
but some other Members of their own
Body, who had Employments depend∣ing
on the Court, were engaged in it.
This inadvertency, with the want of re∣quisite
Courage upon occasion, brought
upon them the Mischief on a sudden; so
that except two or three who were more
than ordinary doubtful of what might
happen, and slipt out of Town that
Night, the rest were altogether fearless
of danger, till the very instant that the
Evil was remediless.


Schack
 the Governour of the Town
had been gained by the Court to favour
the Design, which he performed effectu∣ally,
though not with so servile an inten∣tion
as others; for when the King, upon
the first news of the Resolution of the
Commons, did often openly promise that
he would in Gratitude and Recompence
declare them all Free as soon as it lay in
his power, by the Gift they were about
to make him; and the People were wil∣ling
to trust the King's goodness, and to
depend on the performance of this Pro∣mise,
encouraged thereunto by the Cler∣gy,
who alledged it a thing unbeseeming
and dishonourable to require any other


Security from the King than his bare
Word; yet 
Schack
 urged vehemently
that the Commons should insist to have
this Promise under the King's Hand, and
make themselves sure of the Reward for
so considerable a Present as they were go∣ing
to make, whilst they had so fair an
opportunity in their hands. But all his
Instances were in vain; they were in the
giving humour, and resolved to do it ge∣nerously,
trusting the King for the per∣formance
of his Word: A thing which
they have since often, though too late re∣pented
of.


Next Morning the Nobles met in the
Council-House, and the other two E∣states
in the 
Brewers-Hall;
 the Resolu∣tion
of the Commons could not be kept
so secret, but by this time some warm
rumours of it had reached the Nobility;
but scarce had they leisure to consider
what was fittest to be done on that occa∣sion,
when they were informed that the
Commons were marching towards them:
For the Bishop and the President had so
well performed their Parts, and urged
the necessity of speedily executing what
had been resolved the day before, that all
time was judged lost which was not em∣ployed
in putting it in practice; they
immediately agreed to go to the Coun∣cil-House,


and there propound to the
Nobility their design, desiring their Con∣currence
in such a necessary Work for
the welfare of the Kingdom. They
marched through the Streets with great
Gravity, and Silence, by Couples, as be∣fore,
whilst the Mobb by repeated Shouts
applauded what they were going to do.
And thus they came to the House where
the Nobles were assembled, who had
scarce warning sufficient to receive them.


The President 
Nanson
 made a short
Harangue, setting forth that they had
considered the state of the Nation, and
that they found the only Remedy for
the many Disorders which afflicted it,
was to make the Crown Hereditary, and
to give more Power to the King than hi∣therto
he had enjoyed; that this Resolu∣tion
was already taken by the Commons
and Clergy, in which if the Nobility
should think fitting to concur, they were
ready to accompany them to the King,
and make him a tender of an Hereditary
and Soveraign Dominion; if not, that
they were going themselves, and the
matter should be done without them:
That a speedy Resolution was necessary,
for they had already sent word to the
Court of their coming, and his Majesty
expected them in the Hall of his Palace;


therefore desired to be informed in few
words what they resolved to do.


The suddenness of such a Proposition,
and briskness in the manner of its delive∣ry,
caused a general astonishment in the
Nobles; one might have seen those who
but the day before carried it so proudly,
in an instant fall to an excess of Compla∣cency,
and betray their Fear by their
Speeches and Countenances, as they for∣merly
had done their Arrogance. The
Mischief no sooner appeared to them,
but they saw it was unavoidable; there
was no leisure allowed them to consult;
and to deny their compliance, or even to
delay it, was dangerous. To give up
at once their beloved Power, and submit
their Necks to a heavy Yoak, was an
intolerable Grievance: But they saw
they were no longer the Masters; the
Commons were armed, the Army and
Clergy against them; and they found
now too late, that that which the day
before they had considered only as the
Effort of an unconstant giddy Multitude,
was guided by wiser Heads, and suppor∣ted
by Encouragements from Court;
nay possibly by some of their own Body:
They suspected each other, and no Man
knew whether his next Neighbour was
not in the Plot against the Publick Liber∣ty.


It is easie to imagine what distract¦ed
thoughts afflicted them on a sudden;
they were altogether unprepared for
such a dismal stroke: But some Answer
must be given, and that speedily. Such
a one as they had a mind to give, they
durst not; for they were assembled in a
Fortified Town, remote from their se∣veral
Countries and Interests (where
they had governed like so many Princes)
in the power of those who could, and
certainly would be revenged in case they
proved refractory. The best way there∣fore
was to seem to approve of what they
could not hinder. They answer that the
Proposition made to them by the Com∣mons
was not displeasing, but the man∣ner
of it wanted the requisite Formalities;
that previous deliberation was necessary
to an Affair of so great moment; that
they could not but take it ill, a Resolu∣tion
of such Consequence should be con∣cluded
on by the Commons without the
least acquainting of the Nobility with it,
who were the Chief Estate of the Realm:
That they also aspired to the Honour of
bearing their part in bestowing such a
material Gift on the King and his Posteri∣ty,
but desired that the Matter might
be proceeded on with that gravity, and


solemnity, which the nature of it requi∣red.
That it was not fit such a weighty
Transaction should have the appearance
of a Tumult, and seemed forced rather
than a free Choice. The Conclusion of
all was, That they hoped the Commons
would a little defer the putting in Exe∣cution
their Design; and in the mean
time consult with them, till the Affair
were done orderly, and with unanimous
Approbation, as well as to mutual Ad∣vantage.


This was with great vehemency by
the President denied. He replied, These
were Shifts only to gain time, that the
Nobles might be in a Condition to fru∣strate
the Intention of the Commons;
that the Point was already agreed, and
the Resolution taken; that they came
not thither to consider, but to act; if
the Nobles would join with them, they
were ready; if not, they would do what
was to be done alone; and doubted not
but his Majesty would make his use of it.


During these Disputes the Nobility
had privily sent some of their Body to
Court to acquaint the King, that the
Commons were now at their House, and
had made them sudden Proposals, out of
form, but such as they should rather


concur with, than be averse to; that
they were ready to join with them in of∣fering
an Hereditary Crown to his Ma∣jesty,
and the Heirs Males of his Family
for ever; which they hoped his Ma∣jesty
would accept in good part: But
desired to proceed in the usual Methods,
which such weighty Affairs merited,

viz.
 by Conferences and Deliberations,
that it night appear rather an effect of
their just Sentiments of his Majesty's Va∣lour
and Conduct, than the sudden Mo∣tions
of a Tumultuous Assembly.


The King, with a great deal of mild∣ness,
as if he had been wholly uncon∣cerned
and passive in the Case, replied;
That he was obliged to them for their
Designs in favour of Him, and the Royal
Family; that he hoped what they were
about would tend to the benefit of the
Nation; but that a Crown intailed only
on the Heirs Males could not be so ac∣ceptable
to him, as if it were given with∣out
that Limitation; that the Govern∣ment
of Females had neither been a new
thing at home, nor unprosperous in
Neighbouring Countries: That they
might consider of it, and since it was
their Gift, he would not prescribe, but it
could not be accepted by him unless it
were more general.


In the mean time the Commons grew
impatient, the Answer given them was
not satisfactory, and the Nobles had
not yet resolved on an entire Compli∣ance,
nor were ready to accompany
them, because they had not yet an ac∣count
of the Success of their Members
sent to sound the Mind of the Court.
The Clergy and Burgers therefore, led
on by their Bishop and President, pro∣ceed
without them to the Palace, and
were met by the prime Minister, and
conducted by him to the Hall of Audi∣ence,
whither after some short time the
King came to them. The Bishop makes
a long Speech, setting forth the Praises
of his Majesty, and the Cause of their
waiting on him; concluding with an
offer, in the name of themselves, the
two most numerous, and if he pleased
most powerful Estates, of an Hereditary
and Absolute Dominion; together with
the assistance of their Hands and Purses,
in case any Body should go about to ob∣struct
so necessary and laudable a De∣sign
for the good of the Country. The
King told them in short, That he thank∣ed
them; and in case an Universal Con∣sent
established this good Desire of theirs,
he would accept the Present they made


him; but that the Concurrence of the
Nobles was necessary; which he doubt∣ed
not of in the least, when they had
time to make the offer with the necessa∣ry
Formalities: That he assured the
Commons of his Royal Protection, and
should not be unmindful of their Kind∣ness,
by easing them of their Grievances,
and by encouraging Subjects who had
behaved themselves so valiantly, and de∣served
so well from him. Concluding
with his Advice to them to continue their
Session till such time as Matters were
brought to perfection, and he could re∣ceive
their Gift with the Solemnity that
was fitting. And thereupon dismissed
them.


But the Nobles were all this while in
a grievous distraction; they saw the
Commons were gone to the King with∣out
them: Their Messengers brought
News back that their Proposition of en∣tailing
the Crown on the Heirs Males,
was not pleasing, because a greater Ad∣vantage
was in prospect; that this offer
was looked upon to proceed from Per∣sons
that would not have bestowed any
thing, if they could have helped it.
That it was thought they pretended to
merit in giving only a part, when it was


not in their power to hinder the taking
the whole. In this irresolution they
broke up; and since they were to meet
again at Noon upon another Solemn Oc∣casion,
they resolved at that time to
consider how to proceed in an Affair so
delicate.


Monsieur 
Schele
 a Senator, and prin∣cipal
Man of the Country, was that Af∣ternoon
to be buried in great Pomp; his
Body had lain some Months in State,
and according to the Custom, was to be
accompanied to its Interment by all the
Nobility then in Town; this being a Par∣liament
time was chosen for the Cere∣mony,
because the Nobles were all to∣gether,
and a magnificent Dinner was
prepared, as is usual on the like occasi∣ons:
In the height of their Entertain∣ment
an Officer comes into the Room,
and whispers some of the principal Men
that the City Gates were shut, and the
Keys carried to Court: For the King ha∣ving
been informed by the Governour,
that two or three had privily slipt out
of Town the Night before, and being
resolved that no more should Escape out
of the Net, till he had done his business,
had ordered the Governour that Morn∣ing
to lock the Gates, and to let no Per∣son


in or out without special Order.
The Governour sent one 
Bill,
 the Town
Major, to put this in Execution; who
as soon as he had done it, came to the
House where they were met, and sat
down at Table among the Senators.
This dismal News of the Officer was pre∣sently
whispered round the 
Company;

who immediately applied themselves to
him to know what the meaning was of
such an unusual Proceeding at the time of
a General Convention; They asked him
what destiny was appointed them, whe∣ther
they were there to be Massacred, or
what else was to be done with them?
The Town-Major calmly answered, That
he believed there was no Danger towards
them, that such violent Measures would
not be taken by so gracious a King;
though he had indeed given the Orders
himself for the shutting the Gates; and
that no Body was to stir out of Town
without leave; but that this needed not
disturb or hinder them from finishing the
Work of the Day, and pursuing the Pub∣lick,
as well as their Private Occasions.
There wanted no more than this Confir∣mation
from the Officer to overthrow all
the Resolution, and Consultations of the
Nobles; the dread of losing their Lives


took away all thoughts of their Liberty.
They immediately dispatched Messengers
both to the Court, and the Commons,
to give notice of their disposition to com∣ply
with what was formerly proposed;
assuring them likewise, that they were
ready to agree to all that should be asked
of them.


But the King, who had began and
played his Game so well hitherto, deter∣mined
to pursue it to the utmost, and
would not suffer the Gates to be opened,
till the whole Ceremony of the Inaugu∣ration
was concluded, and the Homage
done in due form, and therefore ordered
they should stay, till in the Face of the
People, and the Army, they had sworn
Fealty, and divested themselves of all
Right, as well as Power, to cause any
Disturbance, or Alteration for the future.


Three days time was requisite to pre∣pare
Matters for that fatal hour, where∣in
they were to make a formal Surrender
of their Liberty; the Scaffolds were rai∣sed
in the place before the Castle, and
adorned with Tapestry; Orders were
given for the Soldiery, and Burgers to
appear in Arms under their respective
Officers: And when all things were rea∣dy,
on the 27th of 
October
 in the Morn∣ing,


the King, Queen, and Royal Fami∣ly
mounted on a Theatre erected for that
purpose, and being placed in Chairs of
State under Canopies of Velvet, received
publickly the Homage of all the Sena∣tors,
Nobility, Clergy, and Commons;
which was performed kneeling. The
Oath, which they were obliged to take,
was in these words:


I A. B.
 do Promise, and Declare,
that I will be True, and Faith∣ful
to Your Majesty, as my most Gra∣cious
King and Lord, as also to Your
Royal Family; that I will Endea∣vour,
and Promote Your Majesties
Interest in all things, and to the best
of my Power defend you from all
Danger, and Harm; and that I
will faithfully serve Your Majesty as
a Man of Honour, and an Heredi∣tary
Subject ought to do. So help
me God, 
&c.


This Oath they were all obliged to
pronounce aloud, and some Men of Qua∣lity
that were sick, or pretended to be


so, were brought in Chairs. Among
others one 
Gersdorf,
 a Principal Sena∣tor,
who was the only Man that opened
his Mouth in the behalf of their Expi∣ring
Liberties, saying, That he hoped,
and trusted, that his Majesty designed
nothing but the Good of his People, and
not to govern them after the 
Turkish

manner; but wished his Majesties Suc∣cessors
might follow the Example, which
his Majesty would undoubtedly set them,
and make use of that unlimited Power
for the good, and not the harm of his
Subjects. Not one of the rest spoke a
word, or seemed to murmur in the least
at what was done; and it is observable,
that among so many Great Men, who
a few days before seemed to have Spi∣rits
suitable to their Birth and Qualities,
none had the Courage during those three
last days, either by Remonstrance, or a∣ny
other way, to oppose in any manner
what was doing. And I have heard ve∣ry
intelligent Persons, who were at that
time near the King, affirm, That had the
Nobles shewed ever so little Courage in
asserting their Priviledges, the King
would not have pursued his Point so far
as to desire an Arbitrary Dominion:
For he was in continual doubt, and dread


of the Event, and began to waver very
much in his Resolutions; so that their
Liberties seem purely lost for want of
some to appear for them.


From the Theatre, those that had done
Homage, went to the Council-House,
where the Nobles were called over by
Name; and ordered to Subscribe the a∣bove-mentioned
Declaration, which they
all did.


Thus this great Affair was finished,
and the Kingdom of 
Denmark
 in Four
Days time changed from an Estate little
differing from Aristocracy, to as abso∣lute
a Monarchy as any is at present in
the World. The Commons have since
experienced, that the little Finger of an
Absolute Prince can be heavier than the
Loins of many Nobles. Theonly com∣fort
they have left them being to see their
former Oppressors in almost as miserable
a Condition as themselves; whilst all the
Citizens of 
Copenhagen
 have by it obtain∣ed
the insignificant Priviledge of wearing
Swords: So that at this day not a Cob∣ler,
or Barber stirs abroad without a Til∣ter
at his side, let his Purse be never so
empty. The Clergy, who always make
sure Bargains, were the only Gainers in
this Point; and are still much encou∣raged


by the Court, as the Instruments
that first promoted, and now keep the
People in a due Temper of Slavery; the
Passive Obedience Principle riding Tri∣umphant
in this unhappy Kingdom.


It was but Justice, that the Court
should pay well the principal Contrivers
of this great Revolution; and therefore
notwithstanding the general want of Mo∣ney,

Hannibal Seestede
 had a Present of
200000 Crowns. 
Swan
 the Superinten∣dent,
or Bishop, was made Archbishop,
and had 30000 Crowns. The President
or Speaker 
Nanson,
 20000 Crowns. And
to the People remained the Glory of ha∣ving
forged their own Chains, and the
Advantage of Obeying without reserve.
A happiness which I suppose no 
English

Man will ever envy them.






CHAP. VIII.




The Condition, Customs, and Temper
of the People.




ALL these do so necessarily depend
upon, and are influenced by the
Nature and Change of Government, that


'tis easily imagined, the present Conditi∣on
of these People of all Ranks must be
most deplorable; at least it appears so
to an 
English
 Man, who sees it, possibly
more than to them that suffer it: For
Slavery, like a sickly Constitution,
grows in time so habitual, that it seems
no Burden nor Disease; it creates a kind
of laziness, and idle despondency, which
puts Men beyond hopes and fears: It
mortifies Ambition, Emulation, and o∣ther
troublesome, as well as active quali∣ties,
which Liberty and Freedom beget;
and instead of them affords only a dull
kind of Pleasure of being careless and in∣sensible.


In former Times, and even till the
late Alteration in the Government, the
Nobility or Gentry (for they are here
the same thing) lived in great Affluence
and Prosperity; their Country Seats
were large and magnificent, their Hospi∣tality
extraordinary, because their Plen∣ty
was so too; they lived for the most
part at home, and spent their Revenues
among their Neighbours and Tenants,
by whom they were considered, and re∣spected
as so many petty Princes. In
times of Convention of the Estates,
which ordinarily happened once a year,


they met their King with Retinues al∣most
as large as his; they frequently eat,
and drank at the same Table with him,
and in the debate of Publick Affairs, their
Suffrages were of greatest weight, and
usually carried the Point: For the Com∣mons
were willing in a great measure to
be directed by them, because they much
depended on them. In process of time
this Excess of Power, as you have heard,
made most of them grow insolent, which
was the chief occasion of their fall, to∣gether
with the loss of the Liberties of
the whole Country. So that now they
are sunk to a very low Condition, and
diminish daily both in Number and Cre∣dit;
their Estates scarce paying the Tax∣es
imposed on them: Which makes them
grind the Faces of their poor Tenants to
get an Overplus for their own Subsi∣stance.
Nay, I have been assured by
some Gentlemen of good Repute, who
formerly were Masters of great Estates,
that they have offered to make an ab∣solute
Surrender to the King of large
Possessions in the Island of 
Zealand,
 ra∣ther
than pay the Taxes; which offer,
though pressed with earnestness, would
by no means be accepted. And upon
my further enquiry into the Reason of it,


I have been informed, that Estates be∣longing
to those Gentlemen, who made
this offer, lying in other places, which
had the good Fortune to be taxed less
than the full value of the Income, were
liable to pay the Taxes of any other E∣state
appertaining to the same Person, in
case that other Estate were not able; so
that some have been seen with a great
deal of joy declaring that the King had
been so gracious as to take their Estates
from them.


Through these, and several other
means, many of the ancient Families are
fallen to decay; their Country Habitati∣ons,
which were like Palaces, being rui∣nous,
they are forced to live meanly,
and obscurely in some corner of them:
Unless it be their good Fortune to pro∣cure
an Employment, Civil or Military,
at Court, which is the thing they are
most Ambitious of; it being indeed ne∣cessary
to secure to their Families any to∣lerable
Subsistance, or to afford them
some shelter from the Exactions, and In∣justices
of the Collectors. The Civil
Employments are in no great number,
nor of great value; as they seldom are in
a poor Country governed by an Army;
so that few are provided for this way:


The greatest part patiently enduring
their Poverty at home; where, in a short
time, their Spirits, as well as their E∣states,
grow so mean, that you would
scarce believe them to be Gentlemen, ei∣ther
by Discourse or Garb.


Ancient Riches and Valour were the
only Title to Nobility formerly in this
Country; the Nobles and Gentry being,
as I said before, the same thing. None
took either their Degree, or Patents of
Honour from the King: But of late years
to supply the want of Riches, some few
Titles of 
Baron
 or 
Count,
 and nothing
higher, have been given to Favourites;
who enjoy not the same Priviledges by
those Titles, as our Lords in 
England
 do,
but content themselves with a few Airy
insignificant ones, which distingush them
from the Common People; there are not
many, even of this kind of Nobility, I
believe fifteen or twenty are the most;
these are such, who are most easie in their
Fortunes, and are obliged (that they may
preserve them) to keep in with the
Court by all manner of ways; as indeed
all are, who have a mind to live and eat
Bread.


'Tis only this kind of Nobility with
Titles, that have liberty to make a Will


or Testament, and thereby to dispose
of any Estate otherwise than as the Law
has already determined, that it shall fall
of course: Unless such Will be during
the Life of the Testator, approved of
and signed by the King; and then it shall
be of force, and valid.


'Tis almost needless to mention that
there is no buying, or selling of Land
here; for where an Estate is a Charge,
there will be few Buyers. Neither do
I remember any one Alienation of Lands
for Money, during all the time I stayed
in that Country, except some Estates,
which the Queen purchased; where she
paid after the rate of 16000 Crowns
for that which Thirty Years ago was
valued at 60000 Crowns. There were
indeed some Persons, who took Lands
from the King in lieu of Money, which
they had lent the Crown; and among
these I remember to have heard of two,
Monsieur 
Texera
 a rich Jew of 
Hamburg,

and Monsieur 
Marseilles,
 a 
Dutch
 Mer∣chant,
who was formerly established at

Copenhagen.
 These were forced to take
Lands, or Nothing, for their Debts,
which amounted to some Hundred Thou∣sands
of Crowns; yet did these Lands
yield them so little Income, by reason of


the Taxes imposed on them, though they
were vast Tracts of fertile Ground, that
they would willingly have parted with
them (as I was informed) for one fifth
part of their Principal.


However, in case it should happen
that one who has a mind to transplant
himself to another place, could find a
Purchaser for his Estate, the Law is,
That one third part of such Purchase-Money
shall accrue to the King; and in∣deed
if there were not such a severe Law
against Alienations, it is possible most of
the present Possessors would quit the
Country the first Opportunity.


The King assumes to himself the Pow∣er
of disposing of all Heirs and Heiresses
of any Consideration, as it is practised in

France:
 Not that there is any Law for it,
but upon pain of his Displeasure; which
here is too weighty to be born.


Military Employments are mightily
coveted by the Native Gentry, almost as
much as the Civil; and purely for the
same reason that the Priests Office was
among the 
Jews, viz.
 That they may eat
a piece of Bread. For it is a sure way
to find Soldiers (as long as there are
Men in a Kingdom) to imitate the

French
 King's practice in this particular,


make the Gentry poor, and render Traf∣fick
unprofitable or dishonourable, Men
of Birth must live, and one half of the
Nation, by giving up themselves to Sla∣very,
will contribute their Assistance af∣terwards
to put Chains upon the other.


Yet in 
Denmark
 the Natives are con∣sidered
much less than Strangers, and
are more out of the Road of Preferment,
whether it be that the Court can better
trust Strangers, whose Fortunes they
make, than the Posterity of such whose
Fortunes they have ruined: Or whether
they think their very Parts and Courage
to be diminished in proportion to their
Estates and Liberty, (which appears to
be plainly the case of their common Peo∣ple)
or for what other reason; certain it
is, that all sorts of Places, Civil and Mi∣litary,
are filled more by Forreigners
than Gentlemen of the Country: And in
their disposal of Offices it is remarkable,
that such as are of ordinary Birth and
Fortunes, are much sooner preferred than
those of contrary qualities: So that here
may be found several in the most profi∣table
and honourable Employments who
have formerly been Serving-men, and
such like; and these prove the best Exe∣cutors
of the Will and Pleasure of Arbi∣trary


Power, and therefore are caressed
accordingly. There is one further ad∣vantage
in the promotion of these kind of
Men; that after they are grown rich by
Extortion, and have sucked the Blood of
the Poor, when Clamours grow loud a∣gainst
them, the Court can with ease
squeeze these Leaches, laying all the
blame of its own Oppression at their
Doors; and this without the danger of
causing the discontent of any of the No∣bles,
upon the score of Kindred or Alliance.


The difficulty of procuring a comfor∣table
Subsistence, and the little security of
enjoying what shall be acquired through
Industry, is a great cause of Prodigality,
not only in the Gentry, whose Condition
is more easie, but also in the very Burgers
and Peasants: they are sensible that they
live but from Hand to Mouth, and there∣fore
as soon as they get a little Money
they spend it. They live 
to day
 as the
Poet advises, not knowing but what they
now have may be taken from them 
to¦morrow.

And therefore expensiveness in
Coaches, Retinue, Clothes, 
&c.
 is no where
more common, nor more extravagant in
proportion to their Income, than in this
Country. Parsimony is often, not only
a cause, but a sign of Riches; the more


a wealthy Man has, the more he endea∣vours
to acquire, and to encrease his
stock: But here the Courtier buys no
Land, but remits his Money to the Bank
of 
Amsterdam,
 or of 
Hamburgh;
 the Gen∣tleman
spends presently on himself and
his Pleasures all that he can get, for
fear he should have the Reputation of be∣ing
Rich, and his Money be taken from
him by Taxes, before he has eaten or
drank for it; the Merchant and Burger
do the like, and subsist purely upon
Credit; there being very few of this sort
in the King's Dominions that can be cal∣led
rich, or worth 100000 
Rix Dollars.

The Peasant or Boor, as soon as he gets
a 
Rix Dollar,
 lays it out in Brandy with
all haste, lest his Landlord, whose Slave
he is, should hear of it, and take it from
him. Thus—


Torva leaena lupum sequitur, lupus ipse ca∣pellam.


The Trading Towns and Villages,
(if we except 
Copenhagen,
 whose Scitu∣ation
and Haven make it thrive a lit∣tle
in spight of ill usage) are all fallen
to decay. Those Burroughs which for∣merly
lent good Sums of Money to the


Prince upon extraordinary Publick Oc∣casions,
and furnished the 
Hollanders

yearly with ten or twelve great Fly-boats
Lading of Corn, being now not in a con∣dition
to raise 100 
Rix Dollars,
 or to
Lade one small Ship of Rye; as may be
instanced in 
Kiog,
 once a flourisning lit∣tle
Seaport-Town, twenty Miles from

Copenhagen,
 which in King 
Christian
 the
Fourth's time raised for that King's
Service, in four and twenty hours time,
200000 
Rix Dollars;
 yet upon occasion
of the last Poll Tax, I heard that the
Collectors were forced to take from this
and other Towns (in lieu of Money) old
Feather beds, Bedsteads, Brass, Pewter,
Wooden Chairs, 
&c.
 which they vio∣lently
took from the Poor People, who
were unable to pay, leaving them desti∣tute
of all manner of Necessaries for the
use of Living.


Some Manufactures have been endea∣voured
to be introduced, not so much
with a design of benefiting the Pub∣lick,
as private Courtiers, and great
Men who were the Undertakers, and
expected to profit thereby: particular∣ly
that of Silks and Drinking glasses;
but in a little time all came to no∣thing;
it being a very sure Rule,


that Trade will not be forced in a place
where real Encouragements and Advan∣tages
are not to be found, and where
Property is not secured; the very Cre∣dit
of the Subject being as slender as his
Riches are uncertain.


If this be the Case of the Gentleman
and Burger, what can be expected to
be that of the poor Peasant or Boor? In

Zealand
 they are all as absolute Slaves
as the Negroes are in 
Barbadoes,
 but with
this difference, that their Fare is not so
good. Neither they, nor their Posteri∣ty,
to all Generations, can leave the Land
to which they belong; the Gentlemen
counting their Riches by their Stocks
of Boors, as here with us by our Stocks
of Cattel; and the more they have of
these, the richer they are. In case of
Purchase, they are sold as belonging to
the Free hold, just as Timber-Trees are
with us. There is no computing there
by numbers of Acres, but by numbers
of Boors, who, with all that belongs to
them, appertain to the Proprietor of the
Land. Yeomanry, which is the strength
of 
England,
 is a state not known or
heard of in 
Denmark;
 but these poor
Drudges, after they have laboured with
all their might to raise the King's Tax∣es,


must pay the Overplus of the Pro∣fit
of the Lands, and their own Toil,
to their Landlords, who are almost as
poor as themselves. If any of these
Wretches prove to be of a diligent and
improving Temper, who endeavours to
live a little better than his Fellows, and
to that end has repaired his Farm-house,
making it convenient, neat, or plea∣sant,
it is forty to one but he is pre∣sently
transplanted from thence to a
naked and uncomfortable Habitation, to
the end that his griping Landlord may
get more Rent, by placing another on
the Land that is thus improved: so that
in some years 'tis likely there will be
few or no Farm-Houses, when those al∣ready
built are fallen through Age or
Neglect.


Another Grievance is, the Quartering
and paying of the Soldiers.
 Those that
know what a vexatious thing it is (over
and above the Charge) to be constantly
plagued with insolent Inmates, who
Lord it where-ever they dwell, will soon
allow this to be a Mischief scarce sup∣portable.


And although this Country have a
tendency to be extreamly populous, the
Women being exceeding fruitful, which
is sufficiently proved by the vast Swarms
that in former Ages, from these Nor∣thern
parts, over-ran all 
Europe;
 yet
at present it is but competently Peopled;
vexation of Spirit, ill Diet, and Poverty,
being great Obstructions to Procreation.
Within Man's Memory the Peasants li∣ved
very happily; there was scarce any
Family of them that was not Owner of
a large piece of Plate or two, besides
Silver Spoons, Gold Rings, and other
odd Knacks, which they are fond of to
this day, (and whenever they have any
Money, will lay it out in such-like
things, because they dare not trust them∣selves
with the keeping of Money, the
inclination to spend it presently is so
general) but now it is a great rarity to
find in a Boor's House any thing made
of Silver; or indeed any other Utensil
of Value, unless it be Feather-Beds,
whereof there are better, and in greater
plenty than in any place I ever saw;
and which are made use of, not only to
lye upon, but also to cover with instead of
Blankets.


Among all the Hardships which are
imposed on these poor Peasants, that
which seemed to me one of the grea∣test,
was the Obligation they lye under
to furnish the King, Royal Family, and
all their Attendants, their Baggage and
Furniture, with Horses, and Travel∣ling
Waggons, whensoever he makes
any Progress (which he often does ei∣ther
to 
Jutland
 or 
Holstein
) or takes
any lesser Journey in 
Zealand;
 nay, al∣though
it be only to his Country-Hou∣ses
of 
Fredericksburg
 and 
Yagersburg.

In these Cases all the Peasants that lye
near the Road, or in that District, are
summoned to attend with their Horses
and Waggons at certain Stages, where
they are to relieve each other; and
this they often do, always at their own
Charges for Man's, and Horse-meat,
for two or three days together, no re∣gard
being had to the Season of Har∣vest,
(which is the usual travelling time)
or to any other Conveniency of these
poor Wretches. I have frequently seen
them with hundreds of Waggons in a
Company, attending the Arrival of
the Court, bewailing their sad Condi∣tion;
and as soon as the King came up,
and his Coaches, with those of the


other Persons of Quality, were fitted
with six or eight Boors Horses each,
(for they are little bigger than Calves)
then every Lacquey seizes on his Boor
and Waggon, for his own proper use;
at which time, unless his Pleasure be in
all things complied with, the poor trem∣bling
Peasant (who drives on, and takes
all patiently, without replying one word)
is so beaten and abused, that it has often
moved my Pity and Indignation to see it.
Neither is it only when the King himself
travels, that the Boors are put to this
trouble, but whenever he pleases to
give his Warrant to any Person of Qua∣lity,
or Officer, that has a Journey to
make, they are obliged to this Service and
Attendance.


Apoplexies and the Falling-Sickness
are the Epidemical Distempers here;
one shall hardly pass through the Streets
of 
Copenhagen,
 without seeing 
one
 or

two
 poor Creatures groveling on the
Ground in a Fit, and foaming at the
Mouth, with a Circle of Gazers and
Assistants about them: I know not what
to impute this to, unless to the ill
Diet of the 
Common sort,
 which is
generally Salt-meats, Stock-fish, and
such-like. Apoplexies among the better


sort, often proceed either from exces∣sive
Drinking, or from Discontent; it
being very usual here to have them die
of a 
Slacht,
 as they call it, which is an
Apoplexy, proceeding from Discontent
and Trouble of Mind. But by way of
amends for these ugly Distempers, there
are few or none that are troubled with
Coughs, Catarrhs, Consumptions, or such
like Diseases of the Lungs; so that in
the midst of Winter in the Churches,
which are very much frequented, there
is no noise to interrupt the Atten∣tion
due to the Preacher. I am per∣swaded
their warm Stoves, with the
Plenty and Pureness of their Firing,
(which is Beech-wood) contributes as
much to their freedom from these kinds
of Maladies, as the grosness and un∣wholsomness
of our Coals in 
London

does to our being so universally trou∣bled
with them; notwithstanding the
ingenious Sir 
William Petty
 be of ano∣ther
Opinion: for in all other respects
of Air and Situation, we have much the
advantage of them.


The Tables of the better sort are u∣sually
well furnished with Dishes, yet I
cannot commend the Cheer; because
the Flesh is generally lean, and (except
the Beef and Veal) ill tasted, especially
the tame Fowl, the fatning of which is
an Art not known by above two or
three, who have been taught it by an

English
 Poulterer, lately set up at 
Copen∣henhagen.

Wether Mutton is very scarce,
and seldom good. Wild Ducks hardly
to be eaten; and Plovers never. Here
are no wild Pheasants, Woodcocks, Rab∣bits,
or Fallow Deer. Red Deer there
are, but they are the King's Game, and
not to be bought for Money. The Hares
are good, and the Bacon is excellent.
Now and then you meet with a 
Cheureuil,

or small Roe Buck in the Market, but
it is generally lean. Sea-fish is scarce,
and not good, but the River-fish makes
amends, here being the best Carp, Perch,
and Craw-fish that are to be found any
where. One cannot expect extraordi∣nary
Fruits thus far North; yet the
Gentry do not want such as are very
tolerable, being extreamly addicted to
Gardning; and several of the Nobility
being so curious, as to have Melons,
Grapes, Peaches, and all sorts of Sallads


very early, and in great perfection. The
Butter is very good, but the Cheese
stark naught. In general, their way of
Cookery would hardly be pleasing to an

English
 Man.


They are much addicted to drink∣ing;
the Liquors that are most in
vogue with Persons of Condition, are
Rhenish Wine, Cherry Brandy, and all
sorts of French Wine. The Men are
fond of them, and the fair Sex does not
refuse them. The poor People, who
are able to indulge themselves, do it in
bad Beer, and 
Danish
 Brandy, which is
made of Barley.


The Gentlemen and Officers go very
fine in their Dress after the 
French
 mode;
but the Ladies Winter-dress is 
Danish,

very becoming, and convenient. The
Burgers, Servants, and even Peasants,
are neat and cleanly; they love change
of ordinary white Linnen, which is here
made cheap; the Women-kind employ∣ing
their leisure time in Spinning. All
these People have a degree of Vanity;
Pride and Poverty being often Compani∣ons
to each other.


Their Marriages are usually preceded
by Contracts, which will last sometimes
three, four, or more years, before they
proceed to a publick Wedding by the
Minister; though often the young Cou∣ple
grow better acquainted before these
Formalities are dispatched. The Gen∣try
give Portions with their Daughters;
but the Burgers and Peasants, if they
be able, give Cloaths, some Houshold∣stuff,
and a great Wedding Dinner, but
nothing else till they die.


Sumptuous Burials and Monuments
are much in request with the Nobility;
and it is usual to keep the Corps of a
Person of Quality in a Vault, or the
Chancel of some Church, for several
Years together, till a fit opportunity to
celebrate the Funeral. The poorer sort
are buried in great thick Chests; and
in the Towns, there are about a dozen
of common Mourners belonging to each
Parish, who are obliged to carry, and at∣tend
them to their Graves.


The Common People are mean spiri∣ted,
not Warlike in their Tempers, as
formerly; inclined to gross Cheating,
and to suspect that others have a de∣sign
to cheat them; therefore unwilling
to go out of a road they have been


accustomed to: insomuch that if you
offer them great profit for a thing which
they have not been used formerly to
sell, they will refuse to part with it,
as suspecting that you fee an advan∣tage
in such a Purchase, which as yet
is unknown to them, but which they
hope to find out. I remember one in∣stance:
Seeing great Flocks of Green
Geese in the Fields near the Town, I
sent to buy some, but they being ne∣ver
used to sell, or eat Geese, in that
Country, till they are big and old; it
was not possible to perswade any body
to part with one of them, though dou∣ble
the price of a big one were offer∣ed
for each. They asked what we de∣sired
to buy them for? What we would
do with them? 
&c.
 for they could not
be perswaded, any one would be so
foolish as to eat them whilst young,
or little; after a Week, an old Woman,
to whom Money had been offered for
a dozen, came and brought four to sell,
saying, 
That neither she, nor her Geese,
had thriven since she had refused to sell
them at a good price; for the Kite had
the night before kill'd eight of her stock,
and that now the remaining four were
at my service.
 Thus the Superstition of


this old Woman procured us the first
Green Geese that I believe were ever
eaten in 
Denmark;
 but after that they
had taken notice that we fatted, and
killed them for eating, they furnisht us
with them as often as desired. I would
not omit this silly Story, because it
gives a more lively Idea of the Tem∣per
of the Common People, than any
Description I could make. In their
Markets they will ask the same price
for stinking Meat, as for fresh; for lean,
as for fat, if it be of a kind. And the
sure way not to obtain, is to seem to
value, and to ask importunately, a
thing which otherwise they themselves
would desire should be done. This last
Remark is not peculiar to the Common
People only.


I do not see that they are good at
imitating the Inventions of other Coun∣tries;
and for inventing themselves, I
believe none here, since the famous 
Ty∣cho
Brahe,
 ever pretended to it. Few
or no Books are written, but what some
of the Clergy compose of Religion. Not
so much as a Song, or a Tune, was
made, during three Years that I stayed
there. Their Seasons of Jollity are ve∣ry
rare, and since the fatal 
Opera
 about


four years ago, wherein many hundred
Persons were burnt together in the old
Queen's House, they content themselves
with running at the Goose on 
Shrove-Tuesdays,

and taking their pleasure up∣on
Sledds in the Winter, well wrapped
up in Wooll or Furr. A Divertisement
much in request in this Court, and a∣mong
all kinds of People. Perhaps it
will be thought too nice here to remark,
That no body presumes to go in a Sledd,
till the King and Court has begun;
That the King passes over a new Bridge
the first. And that the Clocks of 
Copen∣hagen

strike the hours after the Court
Clock.


'Tis a difficult matter for Strangers
to find conveniences of Lodging or Eat∣ing
in 
Denmark;
 even in 
Copenhagen
 are
few or no Lodgings to be Lett in private
Houses; and in the Taverns one must
be content to Eat and Drink in a pub∣lick
Room, into which any other Com∣pany
may enter, and do the like at ano∣ther
Table; unless one pretends to higher
matters than ordinary.


The Language is very ungrateful, and
not unlike the 
Irish
 in its whining com∣plaining
Tone. The King, great Men,
Gentry, and many Burghers, make use
of the 
High-Dutch
 in their ordinary Dis∣course,
and of 
French
 to Strangers. I
have heard several in high Employment,
boast that they could not speak 
Danish.

Yet very many of the Monosyllables in
this Tongue are the same with the 
En∣glish;

and without doubt we owe the
Original of them to the 
Danes,
 and have
retained them ever since they were Ma∣sters
of our Country.








CHAP. IX.




Of the Revenue.




THE Revenue of the King of 
Den∣mark

arises from three Heads:
First, The Taxes and Impositions of his
own Subjects: Secondly, Customs paid
by Foreigners: Thirdly, Rents of his
own Estate, Crown Lands, and Confisca∣tions.
Each of these shall be treated of
apart.


The Taxes paid by his own Subjects,
are in some Cases fixed, and constant,
in others arbitrary. When I distinguish
between these two, it is not meant that
the King's Power is limited in any wise;
but only that he chooses, in some Taxes,
to follow Rules and Measures establi∣shed
by himself, in all others he varies
often.


Of the first sort are, First, The Cu∣stoms,
or Toll, for Import and Export:
Secondly, The Excise, commonly cal∣led
the 
Consumption;
 which is upon
Tobacco, Wine, Salt, Grain, 
&c.
 and
all Eatables and Drinkables brought into
any Town of the King of 
Denmark's

Dominions to be spent. These are the
great Taxes, and the last is severe e∣nough.
There are besides, of this kind,
smaller Taxes; as that 3
dly
 upon Marri∣ages,
where every couple Marrying, pay
so much for the Licence, according to
their quality; this is pretty high, and
comes in some Cases to a good number
of 
Rix Dollars
 for a Licence. 4
thly,
 A
Tax for marked Paper, whereon all
Bonds, and Contracts, Copies of Judicial
Proceedings, Grants, Passports, 
&c.
 must
be written, otherwise they are invalid.
And this is an uneasie Tax; there being
of this kind of Paper, which amounts
to several 
Rix Dollars
 a Sheet. Fisthly,
Taxes for Brewing, Grinding, and other
things, which shall be hereafter spoken
of. But these, and such like, are cer∣tain;
that is to say, every one knows
how much he is to pay, according to an
Ordonnance at present in force; which


however may be altered as the King
pleases.


Of the second sort are Impositions
upon Land; which is reckoned, not by
Acres, but Farms; 
viz.
 so much for e∣very
proportion of Land that will bear
the sowing of a Tun of hard Corn.
Wheat and Rye are called hard Corn,
and according to the Fertility of the
Land, Seasonableness of the Year, Abi∣lity
of the Landlord, each Farm is tax∣ed
higher or lower; but seldom too
low.


Secondly, Poll-money, which is
sometimes raised twice in a year, and is
imposed according to the Substance of
the Person taxed; which is guessed at,
not fixed, as in other places, where all
of a Rank pay equally.


Thirdly, Fortification-Tax, or Mo∣ney
raised for, or upon pretence of ma∣king
Fortifications for the Defence of the
Kingdom, 
&c.


Fourthly, Marriage-Tax, when a
Daughter of 
Denmark
 is to be dispo∣sed
of; whose Portion commonly is but
100000 Crowns: but under this Name,
occasion is taken to raise more.


Fifthly, Trade-money, wherein eve∣ry
Trades man is taxed for the liberty


of exercising his Trade, according to
the Gain which it is computed he makes
by it: and he is moreover obliged to
quarter Soldiers.


Sixthly, Ground-Rent for all Houses
in 
Copenhagen,
 or any other Towns in

Denmark;
 which are taxed by the King,
when he pleases, according to the good∣ness
of the House, the ability of the Pos∣sessor,
or the greatness of the Sum he
intends to levy at that time.


In 
Holstein
 and 
Sleswick
 the Lands are
taxed by Ploughs; each Plough paying
so much a Month.


To begin with those of the first sort,
whereof the Rates are known and fixed;
it would be convenient, in speaking of
the Customs and Excise, to transcribe
the whole Book of Rates, but I fear to
be too tedious; however not to be wan∣ting
in any thing material, and to give
a taste, whereby to guess at the rest;
and measure 
Hercules
 by his Foot, some
Particulars shall be set down, whereof
to make a right Judgment, a due re∣gard
must be had always, not only to
the Plenty and Scarcity of Money in a

ountry, but also to the goodness of a
Commodity. For instance, when I
speak of a fat Ox, it must not be ima∣gined


that we mean such as are usual in
our 
English
 Markets; but rather such as
we see come from 
Wales
 or 
Scotland.

And so of other things in the Consum∣ption
Tax. And a 
Rix Dollar,
 conside∣ring
the scarcity of Money, ought to be
computed to go further than three crowns
with us.

A 
Rix Dollar
 is something short of an

English
 Crown in value; a

 is more
than an 
English
 Penny. 48 
Stivers

make a 
Rix Dollar.
 One 
Lispound
 is the
same with that we call a Stone. One

Ship-pound
 is 20 
Lispound.
 A 
Danish
 Ell
is a third less than an 
English,
 or there∣abouts.


There are publick Mills appointed
and farmed to certain persons by the
King, where all the Inhabitants of 
Co∣penhagen

are bound to grind upon a Pe∣nalty,
and to pay the Sums above-men∣tioned
for grinding: it being not permit∣ted
to any private Person or Brewer to
grind his own Mault, nor Baker his own
Bread-corn.


I need say no more of the Tax for
Marriage Licences, or that for the use
of mark'd Paper in Bonds and Contracts,
than has been already mention'd.


Those of the second sort, 
viz.
 Land-Tax,
House-Tax, Poll-Money, and For∣tification-Money,
which are sometimes
laid high, and sometimes low, can have
no settled estimate made of them; how∣ever,
I shall endeavour to compute them
in the summing up the total of the Re∣venue,
according to what they have
yielded of late years, which was pretty


high; and according to the utmost they
can bear at present, or may probably for
the future.


Some years ago, since the last War
with 
Sweden,
 the King caused a Valuati∣on
and a Register to be made of all the
Houses in the Cities and Burroughs with∣in
his Dominions, as likewise an admea∣surement
of all Lands in the Country,
that he might the better proportion the
Taxes he should have occasion to levy.
These are now applotted and raised ac∣cording
to the very utmost of the Peo∣ples
Abilities; neither do I believe that
in case of a War or other exigency,
they could possibly bear a greater bur∣den;
for in the Country the Gentleman
and Peasant are in a manner ruined; in
the Cities and Burroughs, Houses pay
yearly for Ground-Tax four 
per Cent.
 of
the whole value that the Ground is rated
at, if it were to be purchased; and this
is estimated by Commissioners appoint∣ed
for that purpose, according to the
quantity of the Ground, or the conve∣niency
of the Station: moreover, for e∣very
hundred 
Rix Dollars
 which the
Ground of any House is rated at, the
Inhabitants are obliged to quarter one
Souldier. Thus a 
Rhenish-Wine
 Vintner


at 
Copenhagen,
 and he none of the rich∣est,
has the Ground of his House valued
at 900 
Rix Dollars,
 he consequently pays
36 
Rix Dollars
 yearly for Ground-tax, and
quarters nine Soldiers upon the account
of his House, and three more upon the
account of his Trade. The like propor∣tion
is observ'd towards all others, with
respect to their Houses and Trades.


Here is commonly one Poll-Tax at
least every year; or if it chance to miss
one year, it is usually doubled the next.
The lowest Assessment is according to
the following proportion, 
vi.z
 a Burgher
esteemed worth eight or ten thousand

Rix Dollars,
 pays for himself four 
Rix
Dollars,
 for his Wife four 
Rix Dollars,

for every Child two 
Rix Dollars,
 for
every Servant one 
Rix Dollar,
 for every
Horse one 
Rix Dollar.
 An ordinary Ale∣house-keeper
pays for himself one 
Rix
Dollar,
 for his Wife one 
Rix Dollar,
 for
every Child 24 
Stivers,
 for every Servant
16 
Stivers.


About two years ago there was a Poll-Tax
higher than ordinary; and at that
time this proportion was observed: One
of the Farmers of the Customs paid for
himself 24 
Rix Dollars,
 for his Wife
16 
Rix Dollars,
 for her Maid two 
Rix


Dollars,
 for every other Servant one 
Rix
Dollar.
 A Burger esteemed worth six
or eight thousand 
Rix Dollars
 paid for
himself six 
Rix Dollars,
 for his Wife four

Rix Dollars,
 for every Child two 
Rix
Dollars,
 for every Servant one 
Rix Dol∣lar;

and thus did others according to
their several Abilities.


The Fortification 
Schatt
 is a Tax with
a witness: in that which was levied in
the Year 91, these were the Rules for
payment. All the King's Servants paid

20 per Cent.
 of their yearly Salaries. All
the Officers of the Army, beginning with
Captains, and so upwards, 30 
per Cent.

of their Pay. (These used to be freed
from former Taxes of this kind.) The
Nobility and Gentry paid in proportion
to their Rank and Estate. The highest,
as Count 
Guldenlieu, &c.
 from seven hun∣dred
to one thousand 
Rix Dollars
 each.
Burgers were taxed according to their
supposed Abilities; the richer sort from
one hundred to four hundred 
Rix Dol∣lars,

each; the middle sort of Mer∣chants
worth six or eight thousand 
Rix
Dollars
 paid forty 
Rix Dollars;
 an A∣pothecary
sixty eight 
Rix Dollars;
 a
Vintner fifty five 
Rix Dollars;
 ordinary
Burgers eight or ten 
Rix Dollars
 each:


the poorer sort one or two 
Rix Dollars,

and so forth. This sort of Tax has been
accounted equal with another called the

Kriegs Sture,
 imposed at the beginning
of the War; and that amounted to near
seven hundred thousand 
Rix Dollars
 in
all. But 'tis most certain, the People
are not now able to pay it as they were
then, and consequently it will not be so
much by a great deal.


When the King's only Daughter was
about to be married to the present Ele∣ctor
of 
Saxony,
 a Marriage-Tax was in∣tended,
and had certainly been levied
in case the Marriage had gone forward:
but the one, as well as the other, is now
no more spoken of, though no Kingdom
in 
Europe
 can boast of a more deserving
Princess.


I suppose by this time an 
English
 Reader
has taken a Surfeit of this Account of
Taxes which the Subjects of 
Denmark

do pay; but it ought to be a great Sa∣tisfaction
to him to reflect, that through
the Happiness of our Constitution, and
the Prudence and Valour of our King,
the People of this Nation, though en∣joying
ten times more natural and ac∣quired
Advantages than the 
Danes,

which causes more than ten times their


affluence; do not for all that pay to∣wards
the carrying on the most neces∣sary
and just War, the third part in
proportion to what the King of 
Den∣mark's

Subjects do in time of a pro∣found
Peace: 
Pax servientibus gravior
est quam liberis bellum.
 Tacit. Lib. An.

The second Head from whence pro∣ceeds
a considerable Branch of this King's
Revenue, is the Customs or Toll paid by
Foreigners.


These pay something more for im∣ported
Goods than the Natives and Bur∣gers,
and more Anchorage-money in the
Ports. The 
Danes,
 from their own Ports
to their own Ports, paying four 
Stivers
per
 Last; from Foreign Ports ten 
Sti∣vers
per
 Last, whereas Foreign Ships
pay twelve 
Stivers.
 But that which is
most considerable to the King, is the
Toll paid by all Strangers (except the

Swedes
) that pass the 
Sound;
 and the Cu∣stoms
of 
Norway.


I have in another place given an
ample Account of the Original and Pro∣gress
of this Toll, together with the
Copy of a Letter which makes a Com∣putation
of the present Revenue arising
from thence; so that I shall not need


to repeat what I formerly said; only
in general, that it is much fallen from
what it was in the time of the last
War, when all that passed paid; it
came then to about 143000 
Rix Dol∣lars

yearly. In the Years 1690, and
1691, it amounted not to much more
than 65000 
Rix Dollars,
 at which rate
we may judge it likely to continue.
This belongs to the King's Privy Purse,
and comes not under the Management
of the Treasurer.


The Revenues of 
Norway
 arise chiefly
from the Tenths of Timber and Tar,
of Fish and Oil, and the Customs of
the same; which being bought and ex∣ported
by Foreign Merchants, the
Sums that come from thence into the
King's Coffers are principally owing
to them. It is true, there are Silver
Mines, and Iron, and one of Copper,
but these are of small value. The Ex∣cise,
and the other Taxes of the Na∣tives,
are the same with those of 
Den∣mark;

which these of 
Norway
 are bet∣ter
enabled to pay, because of their For∣reign
Trade; although this also is con∣siderably
diminished since their late
Quarrel with the 
Dutch;
 who there∣upon
gave over their Traffick with


them, and transferred it for some time
to 
Sweden.
 These Differences have in∣deed
been since adjusted, but it is a
hard matter to reduce Trade through∣ly
into the former Channel, when once
it has taken another course. The 
Danes

are of opinion, that neither the 
English

nor 
Dutch
 can possibly want the 
Norway

Trade for their Naval Stores: but if a
right use were made of our Plantations in
the 
West-Indies,
 they may chance to find
themselves mistaken.


It may not be amiss to mention in
this place, though it be something for∣reign
to the Matter in hand; that just
before the present War with 
France,
 the
Trading Ships belonging to all the King
of 
Denmark
's Dominions, were com∣puted
to amount to about four hun∣dred,
besides little Barks that bring
Wood, 
&c.
 because the number of them
had been lessened almost two thirds
within thirty years. But at present, since
the Trade of 
Europe
 has been in a man∣ner
carried on by the Neutral Princes,
it cannot otherwise be, but that the
number must be considerably increased
within these four years; though as yet
it comes not up to what it formerly
did.


To conclude with 
Norway,
 which is
divided into the Southern and Northern
Provinces. The whole Revenue from
the first of these amounts yearly to be∣tween
five and six hundred thousand 
Rix
Dollars;
 and from the last to between
two and three hundred thousand 
Rix
Dollars;
 and so the Total may be 
com∣munibus
annis
 800000 
Rix Dollars.


The exactest Computation that I have
known made of the 
English, Dutch
 and

French
 Trades to these Parts in Times of
Peace, ran thus: Of 
English
 there pas∣sed
the 
Sound
 yearly, from two hun∣dred
Vessels to three hundred; of 
Dutch

from one thousand to eleven hundred;
of 
French
 from ten to twelve; and the
like proportion to 
Norway.
 By which
it is easily judged, that the Friendship
and Trade of 
France
 ought to come
in no competition with that of 
England

and 
Holland;
 since the King of 
Den∣mark

owes so large a share of his best
Revenue to these last, and so little to the
other.


The third and least considerable
Branch of the Revenue arises from the
Rents of the Crown Lands, and confis∣cated
Estates. The latter are in the


King's hands, either upon account of for∣feiture
for Treason, and other Crimes,
or by reason of Debt and Non-pay∣ment
of Taxes; and it is to be suppo∣sed
these will encrease every day in pro∣portion
to the Poverty of the Country;
since, as I formerly said, many would
be glad, rather to surrender their Estates
to the King, than pay the Taxes imposed
on them.


But notwithstanding this Addition of
Lands, the King is so far from being
the richer, that he is the poorer for
it: for upon the King's becoming pos∣sessor
of any Man's Estate, immediate∣ly
the great pains and care ceases which
was formerly taken to improve it, and
make it yield as much as it could;
and it becomes almost desolate, either
through the negligence or little en∣couragement
of the Tenants: general∣ly
it turns to Forrest, and contributes
to his Diversion, though little to his
Purse; and the Houses run to decay.
So do the Royal Palaces, whereof there
are a great many on the Crown Lands,
few of them, except 
Fredericksburg,
 be∣ing
in a Condition to be dwelt in.
For which reason it is a hard matter
to make a just Calculation what year∣ly


Revenue these afford: and that which
they do yield goes for the most part
among the Courtiers, who have the
Government of the King's Houses, the
Supervisorships of his Parks, Forrests,
and Farms, with the Services of his
Boors, and Tenants. So that I believe
we should rather over, then under
reckon them, if we compute the clear
yearly profit of these to amount to
200000 
Rix Dollars.


I endeavoured to know from an ex∣act
and understanding Person there, how
much the running Cash of those King∣doms
might probably be: Whose An∣swer
was in these Words:
 It is very
difficult to make any rational Computa∣tion
of the running Cash of these King∣doms;
but certainly it is but very lit∣tle,
and not near the hundredth part of
that of 
England:
 for excepting a very
few, none have any Cash by them; the
Trading People, through whose hands it
runs, being generally Men of no Sub∣stance,
but indebted over Head and Ears
to their Creditors at 
Amsterdam
 and

Hamburg,
 it comes no sooner in, but it
is paid out. Moreover, the Cash of the
Nation runs yearly out, by what the Of∣ficers
of the Army, who are Foreigners,


can clear; for all that they transport
to other Countries: likewise by what di∣vers
of the Ministers of State can scrape
together; since it is observed, that few
or none of them purchase any Lands, but
place their Money in the Banks of 
Am∣sterdam

and 
Hamburg.
 Furthermore,
by what the over-ballance of Trade car∣ries
away; for this Country consumes more
of Foreign Commodities, than its own
Product can countervail. And all this
makes me believe, that there is but an
inconsiderable running Cash here; and
very much of that which runs among
the People is Brass-money, which is not
worth any ones while to Export: Be∣sides,
the very Silver Coin has a great
mixture of Brass in it.


From the whole I conclude, that
there is a moral Impossibility all these
Taxes and Impositions should continue.
The weight of them is already so great,
that the Natives have reason rather to
wish for, than defend their Country
from an Invader; because they have
little or no Property to lose, and may
probably thereby mend their Condition,
when there is scarce a possibility of
making it worse. There seems to be a
great sence of this in the Court, and


therefore an Army composed of For∣reigners
is depended on. Here follow
the Particulars of the Revenue.

It must be observed, that the Poll-Tax,
and the Fortification-Tax, are ne∣ver

that there must be deducted out of
that Sum about 400000 
Rix Dollars
 in
lieu of one of those Taxes; and then
the Sum total of the whole Revenue of
the King of 
Denmark
 will amount every
year to about two Millions two hundred
twenty two thousand 
Rix Dollars.








CHAP. X.




Of the Army, Fleet, and Fortresses.




HAving done with the Revenue, I
come in the next place to shew
how those Sums are expended: And it is
certain, that the levying of them is
not more grievous to the Subject than
the Reason for which they are levied,

viz.
 the Maintenance of a great stand∣ing
Army: so that the People are
Contributors to their own Misery; and
their Purses are drain'd in order to
their Slavery. Thus the King of 
France

makes the rich Towns he takes be at
the Charge of building Cittadels to keep
themselves in awe: and it is that Ma∣ster
of the Art of Reigning, as his Flat∣terers
call him, that has instructed the
Court of 
Denmark,
 as well as the other
Princes and States of 
Europe,
 the perni∣cious
Secret of making one part of the
People, both the Bridle and Scourge of


the other; which in time must needs end
in a general Desolation.


The King of 
Denmark
 has been but
too apt a Pupil to such a Master, and
has endeavoured even to exceed his
Original; which he finds to his cost at
this day, in raising more Men than his
Country can maintain. Souldiers are,
through I know not what mistaken Po∣licy,
esteemed the Riches of the Nor∣thern
Kings, and other 
German
 Princes;
for when they make an estimate of
each others Wealth, it is not by the
usual and ancient manner of Compu∣tation,
the Fertility or Extent of the
Territory, the Traffick, Industry, Num∣ber,
or Riches of the People; but by
so many Horse and Foot. For the sub∣sistance
of which they are forced, after
they have eaten up their own Sub∣jects,
to make use of a hundred cruel
and unjust Shifts, to the Ruin of their
Neighbours. And when they cannot
accomplish such a destructive Project
in the manner they wish, then they
are constrained to foment Quarrels be∣tween
more potent Princes, that they
may have the opportunity of selling to
one or other those Forces which them∣selves
cannot possibly maintain: so that


at present Soldiers are grown to be as
saleable Ware, as Sheep or Oxen, and
are as little concern'd when they are sold;
for provided the Officers be rendred con∣tent
by the Purchaser, in having liberty
to plunder the laborious and honest
Country People in their Marches, and a
fat Winter-quarter, with Permission to
defraud their own Men of their Pay:
the common Soldier goes with no more
sence than a Beast to the Slaughter; ha∣ving
no such Sentiment, as Love of Ho∣nour,
Country, Religion, Liberty, or
any thing more than meer fear of being
hanged for a Deserter.


But this mischievous Custom of
Princes esteeming Soldiers the only
true Riches, was first begun and esta∣blished
by the 
French
 King, and is
grown general by his Care to cultivate
this Opinion in the Minds of the 
Ger∣man

Princes, whose poor Countries he
foresees will be soon ruined by such a
practice. This he principally aims at,
and it has brought Matters to such a
pass, that War and Destruction are
grown absolutely necessary. For as all
Men that lay up Wealth never think
they have enough; so these that con∣sider
Soldiers as the only Riclies, never


cease enlarging their Number, till they
are necessitated for their Subsistance, ei∣ther
to come to Blows with their Neigh∣bours,
or to create Animosities between
other; wherein they have found the
knack of being employed, and recei∣ving
Pay without interessing themselves
in the Quarrel. Where this will end,
God Almighty knows, and can only
prevent the apparent Mischiefs threat∣ned
by it, 
viz.
 the universal Misery
and Depopulation of 
Europe.
 For since
this Practice is grown so general, none
of these Kings or Princes, though en∣dowed
with a more peaceable Spirit
and better Judgment than the rest,
dares lead the Dance, and disarm, for
fear of his Armed Neighbours, whose
Necessities make them wait only for
an opportunity to fall upon him that
is worst provided to make Resistance:
And this is none of the least Calamities
which the 
French
 Tyranny has forced
upon the World, having reduced all the
Princes and Commonwealths of it to this
hard choice; either to submit themselves
to an intolerable Foreign Yoak, or main∣tain
Vipers at home to gnaw their own
Bowels.


But the Consequences of these un∣just
Practices have been more pernici∣ous
to 
Denmark,
 than to the 
French

King that set the Example; the Toad
may emulate the Ox, and swell, but
he shall sooner burst, than equal him.
The one goes on in a course of pro∣sperous
Tyranny; but the other through
an ill Calculation of his own Strength,
which is no way proportionable to his
Ambition, never hitherto throve in any
of his Attempts upon his Neighbours.

Hamburg
 is yet a Free City, and the
Duke of 
Holstein
 restored to his Pos∣sessions;
whilst 
Schonen, Halland, Ble∣king,

and 
Yempterland
 remain in the
Possession of the 
Swedes;
 who in ta∣king
up Arms for their own Defence,
have had the Fortune to revenge the
Injury. And the 
Danes
 are constrained
to acquiesce in the Loss of those their
best Provinces, without any rational
hopes of ever recovering them.

The Remainder of the 90 thousand

Rix Dollars
 runs up for the other Offi∣cers,
Auditor, Quartermaster, Surgeon,
Powder, Shot, and other necessary Ex∣pences.


The Common Soldier receives but 17

Stivers
 a week; the rest goes for Bread,
Quarters, and Cloaths, which they have
once in three years from head to foot;
and in the midst of those three years,
Shooes, Stockins, Breeches, Shirt, and
Cravat. 'Tis permitted to the Common
Soldiers to work where they are quar∣tered;
but then during this permission,
their Officers receive all the benefit of
their pay.


The Foot, both Officers and Soldiers,
are for the most part Strangers of all
Countries, whom Choice or Fortune
brings thither; 
Germans, Poles, Cour∣landers, Dutch, Swedes, Scotch, Irish,

and now and then an 
English
 Seaman,
whom they make drunk after a long
Voyage, and inveigle him by fair
Promises, in that humour, to take some
of the King's Money. The Natives
are, through their dispirited temper,
thought very improper to make Soldi∣ers;
and besides, the Landlords, whose
Slaves they are, can hinder them from
entring into the King's Service, and can
remand them, if any should offer so to
do; as has been frequently practised by
them, to avoid Misery at home, and to
exchange one Slavery for another.


The Officers of the Horse receive no
more Pay in time of Peace, than those
of the Foot. The Troopers, who are
generally Natives, and none of the best
Soldiers, are maintained every one by
his Peasant, who is bound to give him
and his Horse, Meat, Drink, House-room,

&c
 besides to the value of six
shillings 
sterling
 a Month; half of which
Money goes to his Collonel towards his
mounting.


The Dragoons are in somewhat a
better condition, because they are not
obliged to keep Horses, but in time of
War; besides, in 
Holstein
 they have
larger Pay than in 
Denmark.


In 
Norway
 the Forces cost but little,
in comparison of what they do else∣where;
for besides the Pay of the Offi∣cers,
and the Clothing of the Soldiers,
not much Money is expended; each sin∣gle
Soldier having Free Quarter amongst
the Boors. It is to be noted, that the
Officers of this Army are, for the most
part, fourteen or eighteen Months in

There are in 
Copenhagen
 3000 Seamen
kept in constant Pay, who go not to Sea
unless in time of War, but have a cer∣tain
small allowance of Money, with a
constant weekly provision of Salt Flesh,
Stock-fish, Meal, Grout, 
&c.
 given them
out of the Publick Store-Houses, for the
maintenance of themselves, and Families.
They have moreover several Streets of
small Houses, like Baraques, built regu∣larly
for them, by King 
Christian
 the


Fourth, in one of the Out-skirts of 
Co∣penhagen

within the Works; where they
live Rent-free, and where they leave
their Wives and Children when they
go to Sea. Their business in time of
Peace is to work on the 
Holm;
 which
is a large Yard with Docks in it, to build
Shipping, over-against the King's Pa∣lace
in 
Copenhagen.
 Here they are em∣ployed
by turns in all laborious Works
belonging to Ships, Guns, Anchors,
Cables, drawing of Timber, 
&c.
 and
so painful is this Toil esteemed, that
Criminals of the highest kind are usual∣ly
condemned to work on this 
Holm
 for
a certain number of years, or during
life, according to the nature of the Of∣fence.
Once a year generaly, to find
exercise for these, some of the Men of
War are rigged and equipped with their
Guns, 
&c.
 and drawn out of Port to
fail up and down, between that and 
El∣signor,

for three or four Weeks, or lon∣ger,
according as the good Weather lasts.
The pay of these Mariners in Money is
but 8 
Rix Dollars
 yearly for each; and
as small as it is, it's so ill discharged, that
they mutined several times, of late years,
for want of it, and even besieged the
King in his Palace, till some signal Seve∣rity


towards the principal Mutiniers
quelled them. There is usually a year
and a halfs Arrears owing to them, and
often more; which is the better born,
because of their weekly Allowance in
Provision; although that be very scanty,
especially to such as have many Children
to feed.


The best Seamen belonging to the
King of 
Denmark
 are the 
Norwegians;

but most of these are in the Service of
the 
Dutch,
 and have their Families esta∣blished
in 
Holland;
 from whence it is
scarce likely they will ever return home,
unless the 
Dutch
 use them worse, or the

Danes
 better than hitherto they have
done; for the 
Danish
 Sea-provision is
generally very bad.


All the Officers of the Fleet are in
constant Pay, as well in time of Peace
as War, which makes them less given
to plunder, than those who make use of
the short time they are in Commission to
enrich themselves as fast as they can.

This Fleet was never set to Sea thus
equipped; but this is the Computation
the 
Danes
 make of their Sea-Forces; and
thus much they say in case of necessity
they are able to perform.


Some of the biggest of these Ships
draw more Water by five or six Foot at
the Stern than at the Head, which de∣notes
they are broken-backt; they are


all generally lower Masted than ours,
and seem more unweildy. I believe
them more proper for the 
Baltick
 than
the 
Ocean;
 if we except some few of the
Cruisers, and other Ships which Convoy
their Merchant-men to 
France, Spain

and 
Portugal.






Fortresses belonging to the King of
Denmark.


ON 
Bornholm,
 a Fertile Island in
the 
Baltick Sea,
 nearest to 
Sweden

of any of this King's Dominions, are two
Fastnesses; one an ancient Castle, the
other a Cittadel, according to the Mo∣dern
manner of Fortification, which
commands the best Road in the Island
called 
Roena.
It was finished in the
Year 1689. and has good Bastions and
Out-works.


Christian's Oye,
 about seven 
English

Miles North-west from 
Bornholm,
 being
a number of little Islands which enclose
a safe Harbour for thirty Sail; the lar∣gest
Isle, in form of a Cressent, is well
fortified.


In the Island 
Mûne
 at 
Stege,
 a small
Town, is an ancient Castle of little De∣fence,
where there is a Garison.


In 
Laland,
 all that looks like strength,
is the Town of 
Naxkew,
 and an old
Castle called 
Allholm;
 but they are of
no great Defence.


In 
Zealand,
 first, the Town of 
Copen∣hagen

is well fortified, but the Works are
only Earth. Secondly, The Castle of

Cronenberg
 near 
Elsignor,
 which is now
near finishing, and is faced with Brick.
It is an irregular, but good Fortification.
Thirdly, 
Corsoer,
 a small Earthen For∣tress
over against 
Funen.


In 
Funen,
 the Town of 
Nyburg
 is
pretty well fortified towards the Sea;
but towards the Land the Works are out
of repair.


In 
Holstein
 there is, first, 
Glucstadt,
 a
well fortified Town upon the River 
Elb,

which because of its Neighbourhood to

Hamburg
 is kept in a good condition.
Secondly, 
Cremp,
 a Town within three

English
 Miles of the former, near the
River 
Stoer,
 in no extraordinary repair.
Thirdly, 
Hitlar Scance
 on an Island,
twelve 
English
 Miles from 
Hamburg.

Fourthly, 
Rendsburg,
 on the Borders
between 
Holstein
 and 
Sleswick,
 and on


the River 
Eyder;
 this Place is now en∣larging,
the Bulwarks and Outwarks are
facing with Brick; it will be a Royal
Fortification, and is the most considera∣ble
Place the King of 
Denmark
 has, both
for Strength and Situation. Fifthly,

Christian
's 
Prize,
 or 
Frederick
's 
Ort,
 (for
it has two Names) situated at the en∣trance
of the Haven of the City of 
Kiel

on the 
Baltick.
 It is commanded by a
Hill one hundred and twelve Roods
North from it.


In 
Jutland,
 first 
Fredericia,
 a very
well fortified Town, being a Pass over
the 
Little Belt.
 Secondly, 
Hall,
 a small
Fortress on the North-side the Entrance
of the River that leads to 
Alburg.

Thirdly, at 
Flatstrand,
 twenty 
English

Miles South of the 
Scagen
 Point, is a
Schance and a small Fort for the Defence
of the Haven.


To the Souhward of the North Cape
of 
Lapland
 is a Fort of six Bastions,
called 
Wardhuys.
 And in 
Norway
 there
is, first, 
Drontheim,
 guarded to the Sea
by a strong Castle, called 
Monkholm,

(where Monsieur 
Griffenfelt
 is at present
kept close Prisoner) and to the Land by
a strong Cittadel. Secondly, 
Bergen,
 a
very strong Place towards the Sea, and


environed with high Mountains, which
make it inaccessible by Land; 'twas here
the 
Dutch East-India
 Ships sheltered
themselves, when the 
English
 Fleet, un∣der
the Command of the Earl of 
Sand∣wich,

attacked them unsuccessfully. The

Danes
 had passed their word, that they
would deliver them up; but some sea∣sonable
Presents which the 
Hollanders

made at Court, prevailed so far, as to
make them break it; which occasioned
the 
Hollanders
 Safety, and our Disgrace.
Fourthly, 
Christiania,
 the Capital of

Norway;
 it has a strong Cittadel. Fifth∣ly,

Larwick,
 a slight Fortification. Sixth∣ly,

Frederickstadt,
 a place which has
good Works, but built on a bad Founda∣tion.
Seventhly, 
Wingar Castle,
 a Pass on
the Borders of 
Norway.
 Eighthly, 
Fre∣derick's-hall,

a place well fortified, but
much commanded by a Hill one hun∣dred
Rood from it. Ninthly, a Fort at

Fleckero,
 near the Town of 
Christian∣sandt.


In the 
East-Indies
 the King has a small
Fortress called 
Tranquebar,
 on the Coast
of 
Coromandel:
 In 
Guiney
 another cal∣led

Christiansburg;
 and a third in the
Island of St. 
Thomas
 in the 
West-Indies,

which commands the only good Port in


all those Parts, wherein Ships take shel∣ter
during the Season of the Hurricanes.


One may easily judge that such an
Army and Fleet, which so many Fortres∣ses,
cannot be maintained as they ought,
without a very great Purse. The former
Chapter gives a just account of the Re∣venue;
and the Military Expences may
be guessed at by this: There is over and
above all these, the Charge of the Ci∣vil
List, the maintenance of the Court,
King's Children, Publick Ministers, 
&c.

Whether the Income bears proportion
to all these Expenses, and would be suf∣ficient
without the assistance of Foreign
Money, is left to the determination of
such as are skill'd in Calculating.








CHAP. XI.




Of the Court.




UNDER this Head I comprehend
the King, Queen, Royal Family,
Ministers of State, Knights of the Or∣der
of the 
Elephant,
 and of 
Dannebrug,

with other principal Officers belonging
to the Court.


The present King of 
Denmark, Chri∣stian



the Fifth, is but of a moderate sta∣ture,
rather lean than corpulent, yet
well proportioned, and strongly built;
his Complexion is Sanguin, he wears a
black Perriwig; the Lines of the lower
part of his Face are not unlike those of
King 
Charles
 the Second; his Constitu∣tion
has been very robust, capable to en∣dure,
and loving to undergo all manner
of fatigue; until that within these few
years, having had some fits of the Gout,
he thought it better to dispense with
Exercises which might disturb his Ease;
especially there being less need in time
of Peace of his taking such pains as he
easily could, and yet would do, were
there occasion. He began the six and for∣tieth
year of his Age the fifteenth of

April
 1692. His Habit is usually modest,
but gentile; he seldom appears at Court
times with either Hat or Gloves, though
always (after the 
German
 fashion)
with a good Sword girt close to his side.


As to his qualities, he is a Prince of
singular affability and good nature; tem∣perate
if you consider the humour of
that Countrey; being neither luxurious
in his Meat or Drink, and of late years
very seldom making any Debauch. His
Amours have not been many, and in


those he has continued very constant.
He is Religious as a Prince ought to be,
without doting on his Clergy, tho they
seem to adore him; in his own temper
a lover of Justice and Moderation; but
often over-ruled by those about him, to
whom he leaves the whole management
of Affairs; because he neither loves,
nor has a Genius for business. He speaks
little, unless to his Ministers, and imme∣diate
Servants; yet he gives all oppor∣tunity
and encouragement to others to
entertain him; as it were emboldening
them by a gracious Smile, and advan∣cing
towards them. He is Master of
three Languages besides his own, the

High
 and 
Low Dutch,
 and the 
French,

using them with great ease upon occasi∣on.
He was not bred up to any sort of
Learning, yet takes a particular delight
in 
Geography;
 and is never better plea∣sed
than when an exact Chart of any
Countrey, or Delineation of any For∣tress
is brought to him: his Genius for
the War inclining him to love Fortifica∣tion.
He is of a clear undoubted Per∣sonal
Courage, as has been often demon∣strated
in the late Wars with 
Sweden:

but eases himself of the greatest part of
the Conduct, which he leaves to his Ge∣nerals,


not relying on his own Judgment
either in occasions of Action or Negoti∣ations;
though 'tis probable the great∣ness
of his Courage in the one, and the
sincerity of his Intentions in the other,
would produce better effects, did he trust
himself more, and others less. In fine,
he is a very mild, and gracious Prince,
beloved rather than reverenced by his
People; who are sensible that the pre∣sent
Form of Government, concurring
with a King of a severe temper, would
be altogether intolerable. His Motto
under his Arms and Cypher is, 
Pietate
& Justitia;
 and his Subjects do really
believe the preservation of these to be
his true Inclinations; and that all hard∣ships
that fall upon them, have their
rise from the Ministry. Therefore they
complain of his permitting, rather than
his acting, and attribute all the Evils
they endure, to the easiness of his Tem∣per,
and unhappiness of their present
Constitution; which is not redressed by
any Advantages derived from his Edu∣cation.


The Queen, 
Charlotta Amelia,
 is a
Princess that deserves to be mentioned
with all honour, even tho she were not
of that high Quality. She is fair, and


well shap'd; her Complexion being a
mixture of Flegmatick and Sanguin;
and altho she be in the forty first year
of her Age, continues still handsome;
her Carriage is very engaging, affable,
and free; her great Accomplishments
secure to her the Hearts of her Subjects,
notwithstanding her differing from them
in Religion, and stop the mouths of the
bigotted 
Lutherans,
 which would be
apt enough to exclaim against her, did
not a most unreproachable Life set her
above Malice. They have made several
Attempts to wound the 
Calvinist
 Reli∣gion
through her sides; but she has hi∣therto
frustrated them all, and preserved
not only her self, but the little 
French

Protestand Church (lately founded in

Copenhagen
 by her Bounty, and subsisting
through her Protection) from all the
Assaults made against it by Persons in
Power. And this she does the more ef∣fectually,
through a prudent compliance
with the King in matters indifferent, go∣ing
frequently with him to the 
Lutheran

Service and Sermons: thereby not only
shewing the charitable and good Opini∣on
she has of the Publick established
Worship, but getting a greater freedom
of going every Afternoon to hear the



French
 Ministers in her own Church.
She is the common Refuge of distressed
People, who never fail of their account
in approaching her. Neither is Access
to her difficult; she often prevents those
that have need, and does good before
she be sought unto. In short, she is Sister
to the present 
Landgrave
 of 
Hesse Cassel;

worthy of such a Brother, and the illu∣strious
Stock from whence she proceeds.


The King of 
Denmark
 has five Chil∣dren;
four Princes and one Princess.
Prince 
Frederick
 the eldest, who is also
called the 
Prince Royal,
 is about twenty
years old; it were to be wished his E∣ducation
had been more conformable to
his quality; for his former Governor
being somewhat pedantick, had infused
a little stiffness and formality into the
Pupil, which People that judge by out∣ward
Appearances, are apt to miscon∣strue
Pride; but doubtless his Travels
have reformed that ill habit. Prince

Christian,
 the second Son, is about eigh∣teen
years of Age, of a more lively and
affable temper than his elder Brother,
as well as taller, and of a more robust
Constitution; much addicted to Hunt∣ing,
and riding the great Horse; he
longs for nothing more than to see and


shew himself to the World. Prince

Charles,
 the third Son, is about nine years
old, and Prince 
William,
 the Fourth, a∣bout
six. The former is a very forward
hopeful Youth; the latter does not yet
stir out of the Nursery, so that no Judg∣ment
can be made of him.


The Princess—is about six∣teen,
a very beautiful sweet tempered
and well-educated Lady; she was con∣tracted
to the present Elector of 
Saxony

her own Cosin Germain; but the Match
was afterwards broken off.


The King has besides these, two Natu∣ral
Sons by Mrs. 
Mote,
 a Citizen's Daugh∣ter
of 
Copenhagen,
 whom he had made
Countess of 
Samsoe
 (an Island which he
has given to her) the sends her more∣over,
as it is confidently reported 1000

Rix Dollars
 every 
Saturday
 Night. The
young Gentlemen, her Sons, are very
handsome and hopeful. The eldest is in
the Service of 
France,
 where he has a
Regiment of Horse, and is called young

Guldenlieu,
 to distinguish him from the
Elder, who is Viceroy of 
Norway;
 the
King gives him the Revenue of the Post-Office.
This Appellation of 
Guldenlieu

is appropriated to the Bastard Sons of
the Kings; I know not whether it be∣gan


with the present Viceroy of 
Norway,

or not; but it is likely to continue here∣after,
and a young 
Guldenlieu
 will be∣come
as necessary an Ornament to the
Court, as an Heir of the Crown.


The second of the King's Sons, by
the Countess of 
Samsoe,
 is designed for
the Sea; and to that end has been sent
several Voyages in a Man of War under
the Direction of a trusty Person, in or∣der
to fit him to be one day Admiral-General.


His high Excellency, Court 
Gulden∣lieu,

Viceroy of 
Norway,
 and Natural
Brother to the King, will be more pro∣perly
mentioned here, as one of the
Royal Family, than when we come to
speak of the Ministers; for tho he be one
of them, yet he cares not to embark
himself deep in the Publick Affairs,
having formerly, in some Occurrences,
burnt his Fingers; he thinks it wisdom
rather to enjoy his Divertisements, and
the favour of the King, which he now
firmly possesses. His Father, King 
Frede∣rick,

loved him so well, that he once
thought of making him King of 
Norway;

which has been remembred to his pre∣judice,
and obliges him to carry himself
with great care, under a Government so


Arbitrary as this is. He is about fifty six
years of Age, has been one of the hand∣somest,
and continues one of the finest
Gentlemen that 
Denmark
 has produced:
having to his Natural Accomplishments,
added all the advantages of Travel, and
Knowledge of the World. He is a Man of
Pleasure, and understands it in all its
Refinements; his Palace, his Gardens,
his Entertainment, manner of accost∣ing,

&c.
 excelling by many degrees any
thing that can be found elsewhere in
that Kingdom. He was formerly Am∣bassador
Extraordinary from King 
Fre∣derick

his Father to King 
Charles
 the Se∣cond,
who shewed such a particular
esteem for him, that he made him the
Partner of his Pleasures. And this is re∣turned
by so deep a sense of that King's
Kindness, that he scarce ever mentions
his Name without great concern. He
speaks a little 
English,
 and is very obli∣ging
to any Person that belongs to this
Countrey, in gratitude for the great
Civilities he received here.


The King of 
Denmark's
 Court, as to
Pomp and Magnificence, can hardly be
called a Royal one; the Luxury and
Extravagance of the more 
Southern

Courts of 
Europe
 having not reached


thus far 
North,
 no more than their
Riches. It is true indeed, since their good
correspondence with 
France,
 their Man∣ners
are somewhat refined above what
they formerly were; they affect 
French

Modes, 
French
 Servants, and 
French
 Of∣ficers
in the Army; whereof they have
one Lieutenant General, and one Ma∣jor
General, who have quitted 
France

for fighting Duels there. And this is
either really true, or at least the pretence
of such as seek Service in Foreign Coun∣tries
on purpose to do the business of

France,
 whose interest they always cul∣tivate
industriously, tho they seem never
so much in disgrace with their Prince.


In this Court no Ensigns of Majesty
appear; let the occasion be never so so∣lemn,
except such as are Military, all
those which a standing Army can afford,
such as Horse and Foot Guards, Tra∣bands,
which answer our Beef-eaters,
Kettle-Drums, and Trumpets, 
&c.
 are
there is perfection, and used every day
as much as in a Camp: but 
Badges
 of
Peace, 
viz.
 Sword of State, Heralds,
Maces, Chancellor's Purse, 
&c.
 are not
known.


The King sits down to Dinner with
his Queen, Children, Relations, prime


Ministers, and General Officers of the
Army, till the round Table be filled,
The Court Mareschal invites whom he
thinks fit to eat with the King, speaking
sometimes to one, sometimes to another,
till all have had their turns in that ho∣nour.
A Page in Livery says Grace be∣fore
and after Meat, for no Chaplain ap∣pears
either here, or in any other of the
Protestant Courts abroad, but in the
Pulpit. There is a plentiful Table; but
the Meat dressed after their own manner.
The King's particular Diet every day, is
a Loin of roasted Veal, and his Drink
Rhenish-Wine; whereof a silver Beaker∣full
stands at every one's Plate, which
generally serves for the whole Meal.
The Attendants are one or two Gentle∣men,
and the rest Livery Servants. No
Ceremony of the Knee is used to the
King. The Kettle Drums and Trum∣pets,
which are ranged in a large place
before the Palace, proclaim aloud the ve∣ry
Minute when he sits down to Table.

Sunday
 is his Fasting day, and by his Ex∣ample,
is so to many of the Courtiers.


Court times, wherein those that have
business, may most easily have Audience,
are an hour before Dinner constantly, and
sometimes before Supper. At such times


the King's Children, Domestick and Fo∣reign
Ministers, Officers of the Army,
and Houshold, appear in the Anti∣chamber
and Bedchamber: these com∣pose
the Court, and seldom amount to
above the number of twenty or thirty.
Few or no Gentlemen, that have not
Employments, are seen at Court, or
in 
Copenhagen,
 for Reasons formerly
given.


The Officers of the Houshold are,
The Marshal, who regulates the Affairs
of the Family, and gives the King no∣tice
when Dinner or Supper is ready.
The Comptroller of the Kitchen, who
places the Dishes of Meat upon the Ta∣ble,
and is likewise Master of the Ord∣nance.
The Master of the Horse, who
looks after the King's Stables, and Studs
of Mares, whereof the King has very
many, and very good, especially those
of one Breed particular to him, which
are light Iron-Grey, with black Heads,
Tails, and Mains. But one forms a
nearer Idea of the Grandeur and Reve∣nue
belonging to these several Offices, by
imagining them like the same in the Fa∣milies
of some of our 
English
 Noblemen,
rather than of those belonging to 
White∣hall.


The Master of the Ceremonies is obli∣ged
by his Employment to be a constant
Attender at Court.


But the principal Favourite of the
King is Monsieur 
Knute,
 a 
Mecklenburger,

and only Gentleman of the Bedchamber.
He has been bred up all along with the
King, as his Confident and Companion
in his Pleasures; is a civil well-natur'd
Gentleman, speaks no Language but his
own, and loves least of all the 
French;

meddles rarely with publick business,
yet when he undertakes any thing with
the King, seldom fails of Success. There
are several Grooms of the Bedchamber
subordinate to him. And the Queen has
many Gentlemen, Sons of Persons of
the best Quality, which are Attendants
upon her, and eight Maids of Honour.


The King's Ministers are, first, Mon∣sieur

de Guldenlieu,
 who has the prece∣dence
at the Council-Board, and in all
other Commissions where he is employ∣ed
with the rest; but business, as I inti∣mated
before, being not his Talent, or at
least not his Choice, it is rather out of
respect to his quality, than otherwise,
that he is reckoned among them.


Secondly, Count 
Raventlau,
 Great
Master of the Game, which is the Em∣ployment


of greatest Profit in the King's
Gift, after the Viceroyship of 
Norway:

he is a Native of 
Holstein,
 and is lookt
upon as Prime Minister; therefore all
Foreign Ministers address themselves to
him. He takes it not ill to be stiled so;
tho he seems upon some occasions mo∣destly
to decline it. He is very affable
civil, and of easy access; a Man of Plea∣sure,
and an admirer of the fair Sex, as
well as Monsieur 
de Galdenlieu:
 his
Parts and Learning are of a moderate
size; tho of late, through a more dili∣gent
application to business he be much
improved; so that he seems to fill worthi∣ly
enough the Post wherein his Master
has placed him. He is about Three and
forty years of Age, his Complexion fair,
and his Constitution robust; his Inclina∣tions
were but indifferent towards the

French
 (as being convinced that the
low Ebb of his Country's Prosperity,
and his Master's Honour, were in a great
measure owing to their Counsels and
Practices) till within this year or two,
that private Interest has reconciled him
to that Court: the benefit of the 
French

Traffick, during this War (wherein he is
deeply concerned, as well by several
Ships of his own, as by giving Pro∣tection


to others that manage that
Trade) has made him think that it is
his Master's Advantage, as well as his,
to keep firm Friendship with 
France.

On the other hand, the 
English
 obstruct∣ing
that Traffick, by taking and con∣fiscating
several Ships wherein he was
concerned, seem to have quite lost his
favour. Yet after all, 'tis believed, if he
could procure the same, or equivalent
Advantages for himself and his Master,
his Inclinations would more willingly
lead him to accept of them from 
Eng∣land

than 
France;
 but the unhappy Cir∣cumstances
of this present Conjuncture
do render that matter scarce possible.


Thirdly, Baron 
Juel,
 younger Brother
to the Admiral General, and a 
Dane
 by
Birth, about sixty years old; he is very
corpulent, and of a flegmatick Complexi∣on;
more easy in his Fortunes than any
about Court, which is in part owing to
his remarkable parcimonious temper.
The 
Danes
 look on him as one of the
cunningest men among them, who un∣der
the disguise of a seeming Simplici∣ty
covers a great deal of Craft. His
words are very few and smooth, and
his behaviour Civil. It is thought that
he sees with regret the Misery his Coun∣trey


is reduced to, as being one of the
Stock of old Nobility, who have suf∣fered
by the change of the Constitution:
yet his Advice cannot be wanted, where
there is such a scarcity of good Heads;
and therefore he is employed in all diffi∣cult
Affairs, which he manages with
great dexterity and success.


Fourthly, Monsieur 
Ehrenschild,
 a

German
 by birth, and formerly Secretary
to Monsieur 
Terlon
 the 
French
 Ambassa∣dor
at this Court, which makes him

French
 in his Inclinations to this day.
The King enobled him, and gave him
the Name of 
Ehrenschild,
 instead of that
of 
Beerman,
 by which he was formerly
known. He is about 65 years old, of a
weakly constitution, and therefore most
commonly resides at 
Hamburg,
 under
pretence that the Air is necessary for his
Health; but in reality to manage the
King's Affairs with that Town; where∣in
is constantly maintained a Faction,
which must have Life kept in it by the
Residence of a Minister of Quality.
Moreover, that City being conveniently
seated for the Correspondence with all

Germany,
 from whence a nearer inspe∣ction
may be made into the proceedings
of the neighbouring Princes, as well as


the management of the 
French
 Traffick
during this War; it is thought necessa∣ry
to keep an able Man there: this Mon∣sieur

Ehrenschild
 has been bred a Scholar
after the 
German
 way, and is well skill'd
in negotiating; wherein he has been
constantly employed since he first entered
into business. He is esteemed a Cunning
man, but has no great reputation of In∣tegrity;
he affects to find out difficul∣ties,
and is excellently skill'd in prolong∣ing
a business. The Foreign Ministers
call him by the Name of 
Fater difficul∣tatum,

and say that he has a peculiar
knack in finding 
nodum in scirpo.
 There∣fore
they care not for Treating with
him, because he values Argumentation,
and seeks Sophisms rather than Truth,
or the Decision of the Matter. You
can never bring him to say such a thing
is, thought it be as clear as the Sun; but

cela peut estre:
 thereby leaving always
a Hole open to creep out at. He hoards
up all his Money, or puts it in the Banks
of 
Hamburg
 and 
Amsterdam,
 having
small prospect of a future happy esta∣blishment
for his Family in 
Denmark.

And this is the common Maxim of all
the most intelligent Heads in that King∣dom,
as appears by their making few or
no Purchases.


Fifthly, Monsieur 
Plessen,
 a Gentle∣man
of 
Mecklenburg,
 and formerly the
Manager of Prince 
George
's Revenue in

Denmark.
 He is now the Ober-Rent
Master, or Comptroller of the Finances,
in the room of Monsieur 
Branat,
 lately
removed from that Employment. The
State of the Finances and Expences
were very much embroiled, and the
King some Millions of Crowns in Debt
when he undertook the difficult Task
of setting things right; which it is ge∣nerally
thought he will accomplish as far
as they are capable: and 'twas high
time to set seriously about redressing Af∣fairs,
for the King's Credit both at 
Ham∣burg,

and every where else, was in a
manner absolutely lost, through the ill
Payment of all Assignments. He is
about Six and forty years old, of a Me∣lancholy
Complexion, and weakly
Constitution; is esteemed to have a
good Judgment, and to understand the
World; tho his Distempers make him
sometimes particular in his Humour. He
speaks four or five Languages, and 
Eng∣lish

among the rest. His Inclinations
seem to be rather 
English
 than 
French;

as well on the account of his Dependance
on Prince 
George,
 as because he is con∣vinced


'tis more the Interest of his Ma∣ster
to be well with 
England
 and 
Holland,

than with 
France.
 He appears to be dis∣interessed,
and is very easy in his For∣tunes,
which consist most in ready Mo∣ney.
In short, he is a Man of Business,
and seems to be more dowright in his
manner of dealing than many of the rest.


These Five compose the King's whole
Privy Council. Four of them are con∣stantly
at Court, and the fifth at 
Ham∣burg;

by the weekly Advices of whom
the others do for the most part regulate
all their Deliberations.


The King in this Council determines
all Affairs; deliberates of Peace or War,
of Alliances, and other Treaties; of
Taxes, Fortifications, Trade, 
&c.
 with∣out
the intervention of any other Per∣son,
unless it be the Secretaries of State;
who are yet esteemed here rather as Mi∣nisterial
Officers and Assistants, than
principal Counsellors. There are four
of these Secretaries that are not Secreta∣ries
of State, in the sense that ours in

England
 are, that is to say, Prime Mini∣sters;
but carry the Pen, and have the
management of the business relating to
their several Provinces; the first is the
Secretary for the Affairs of 
Denmark,



and is at present Monsieur


The second for the Affairs of 
Norway,
 is
Monsieur 
Mote,
 Brother to the King's
Mistress the Countess of 
Samsoe.
 The
third for Foreign Affairs, is Monsieur

Jessen;
 and the fourth, who is Secretary
at War, is Monsieur 
Harboe.
 When any
thing which concerns the Province of
any of these is debated at Council, the
Secretary it belongs to is to be present;
but Monsieur 
Jessen
 never misses, because
there is always business relating to Fo∣reign
Affairs; and the usual times of
the sitting of the Council being after the
Posts come in, his Employment is to
read all the Letters, and to make Re∣marks
on them. This renders his Office
more considerable than that of the other
Secretaries, and makes him enter into
the Secrets of the Cabinet, which pass
for the most part through his sole ma∣nagement.
He has also liberty to speak
his Sentiments; and because he has been
bred a 
Latin
 Scholar, that, as well as
his Employment, entitles him to the
penning of all Treaties with Foreign
Ministers. Therefore he is constantly
one of the Commissioners appointed to
treat with them; and to whom they
are to have recourse almost as necessarily


as to the Prime Minister, who suffers
himself to be in a great measure guided
by this Secretary. He is about forty, of
a civil behaviour and humility, even to
affectation; speaks four or five Langua∣ges
very well, and very much; whereby
he sometimes gives advantages to those
that have business with him. He has
but a moderate reputation for Sincerity,
or Parts; yet so much used to the Road
of Publick Affairs, that he cannot be
wanted, because they have no fitter
Man to put in his place. He is Son-in-Law
to Monsieur 
Ehrenschild,
 by whom
he is much governed, and of the same
Inclinations as to 
France.
 This Affinity
is a great support to his Fortune, as long
as that old Gentleman lives; and his
diligence in his Employment, (if there
were nothing else) will secure to him
his Post and his Princes Favour; provi∣ded
always that he keep fair with the
Prime Minister, (as at present he does)
and act in concert with him.


The ordinary Diversions of the Court
are Progresses, which are made once a
year at least, to 
Sleswick,
 or 
Holstein,

either to make a review of some Troops,
or to see the Fortifications at 
Rendsburg;

besides smaller Journies to 
Laland,
 and


elsewhere, up and down the Countrey.
These are of no Expence to the Treasury,
because the travelling Wagons and Hor∣ses
are found by the Boors, who are also
to pay their Personal Attendance, and
be ready for all necessary Services. Du∣ring
five or six Weeks every Summer,
the Court removes to 
Jagersburg,
 a small
Hunting-House, situated upon a little
Lake within four 
English
 Miles of 
Co∣penhagen,

and not far from the Sea: and
for five or six Weeks more it resides at

Fredericksburg,
 the chief Countrey Pa∣lace
of the Kings of 
Denmark,
 about
twenty 
English
 Miles from 
Copenhagen,

began by 
Christian
 the Fourth, and finish∣ed
by this King's Father, 
Frederick
 the
Third: this is that House which the

Danes
 boast so much of, and tell won∣ders
of the quantity of Money it cost in
building. It is seated in the midst of a
Lake, the Foundations of it being laid
in the Water, which probably occasioned
the greatest part of the Expence; you
pass into it over several Draw Bridges.
This watry Situation is so moist and
cold a Countrey, cannot be approved
by the Critical in Seats, especially when
the rising Grounds about this Lake
(which are clothed with fine Woods)


afforded much better places both for
health and prospect: but it is the hu∣mour
of all this Kingdom, to build in
the midst of Lakes; which I suppose
was at first practised upon the score of
Security. This Palace, notwithstanding
the great cost they talk of, is far from
being magnificent, or well contrived;
for the Rooms are low, the Apartments
ill disposed, the fine Chappel much too
long in proportion to its breadth, and
has a Gallery over it, which has one of
the worst contrived Entrances that can
be imagined. In fine, it falls far short of
many of our Noblemens Countrey-Houses
in 
England;
 yet is esteemed by
the 
Danes
 as a 
None-such.
 There is in∣deed
a fine Park about it, well filled with
Red Deer; having large Ponds, high
Trees in great quantity, a good Bathing-House,
and other Countrey Embellish∣ments;
so that it is by far to be preferred
to all the rest of the King's Houses,
which except these two last mentioned,
are for the most part out of repair: that
of the Fortress of 
Cronenburg
 near 
Fl∣signor,

and of 
Coldingen
 in 
Jutland,
 with
others, being scarce habitable even du∣ring
one Fortnight in the Summer
Quarter.


At 
Fredericksburg
 the Court spends
most of its time in Stag-hunting, for
there are few Fallow-Deer in 
Denmark;

during which Sport the King allows
great freedom to his Domesticks and
Ministers, who commonly do all ac∣company
him whereever he goes; inso∣much
that he seems to lay aside all Ma∣jesty,
and the Formalities of it for that
Season; they eat and drink together,
the latter sometimes to Excess, after a
hard days hunting; when as soon as
Dinner is done, they adjourn to the
Wine-Cellar. About five or six in the
Afternoon the Hunting-Assizes are so∣lemnly
held in the great Court before
the Palace, the Stag is drawn into the
midst of it by the Huntsmen, who are
all cloathed in Red, having their great
Brass Hunting-horns about their Necks;
and 'tis there broken up with great Ce∣remony,
whilst the Hounds attend
with much Noise and Impatience. One
that is likeliest to give a good Gratuity
to the Huntsmen, is invited to take Es∣say,
and presented with the Deer's foot.
Then Proclamation is made, if any can
inform the King (who is both Supreme
Judge and Executioner) of any Trans∣gression
against the known Laws of


Hunting that day committed, let him
stand forth and accuse; the accused is
generally found guilty; and then two
of the Gentlemen lead him to the Stag,
and make him kneel down between the
Horns, turning down his Head with his
Buttocks up, and remove the Skirts of
his Coat, which might intercept the
blows; then comes his Majesty, and
with a small long Wand gives the Offen∣der
some Lashes on his Posteriors, whilst
in the mean time the Huntsmen with
their Brass Horns, and the Dogs with
their loud Openings, proclaim the
King's Justice, and the Criminal's Pu∣nishment.
The whole Scene affording
Diversion to the Queen, Ladies, and
other Spectators, who are always as∣sisting,
and stand in a Circle about the
Place of Execution. This is as often
repeated as there happen to be Delin∣quents;
who as soon as the Chastise∣ment
is over, rise up and make their
Obeisance,


—proudly boasting


Of their magnificent Rib-roasting.


After all is done, the Hounds are per∣mitted
to fall to, and eat the Deer.


At another season Swan-hunting is
the Royal Pastime; the wild Swans
haunt a certain small 
Island
 not far from

Copenhagen,
 and breed there; about the
time that the Young ones are near as big
as the Old, before their Feathers are
grown long enough to fly, the King with
the Queen, Ladies, and others of the
Court, go to the killing of them; the
Foreign Ministers are usually invited to
take part in this sport: every Person of
Condition has a Pinnace allotted to
him, and when they come near the
haunt, they surround the place, and in∣close
a great multitude of young Swans,
which they destroy with Guns till they
have killed some thousands. What is
killed by the whole Company is brought
to the Court, which challenges the Fea∣thers
and Down of these Birds, the
Flesh of them being good for nothing.


On 
Shrove-Tuesdays
 the King, Queen,
Royal Family, Home and Foreign Mi∣nisters,
and all the other Persons above∣mentioned,
that usually compose the
Court, cloath themselves in the habit
of the 
North-Holland
 Boors, with great
Trunk-hose, short Doublets, and large
blue Thrum-Caps; the Ladies in blue
Petticoats, and odd Head-dresses, 
&c.



Thus accoutred they get up in their
Wagons, a Man before and a Woman be∣hind,
which they drive themselves, and
go to a Countrey Village called 
Amak,

about three 
English
 miles from Town;
there they dance to Bagpipes, and
squeaking Fiddles, and have a Countrey
Dinner, which they eat out of Earthen
and Wooden Platters, with wooden
Spoons, 
&c.
 and having passed the day
in these Divertisements, where all are
equal, and little regard had to Majesty,
or other Quality: at Night they drive in
like manner home again; and are en∣tertained
at a Comedy and Magnificent
Supper by the Viceroy 
Guldenlieu,

spending the Remainder of the Night
in Dancing in the same Habits, which
they putnot off all that day.


Every Winter, as soon as the Snow is
firm enough to bear, the 
Danes
 take
great delight in going in Sleds. The
King and Court first giving the Exam∣ple,
and making several Tours about
the Town in great Pomp, with Kettle-Drums
and Trumpets; the Horses
which draw the Sleds being richly a∣dorned
with Trappings, and Harness
full of small Bells, to give warning to
such as stand in the way. After the


Court has been abroad, the Burgers and
others trot about the Streets all night,
wrapt up in their Fur Gowns, with
each his Female in the Sled with him;
and this they esteem a great and pleasant
Pastime.


In travelling to 
Fredericksburg, Yu∣gersburg,

and many other places from

Copenhagen,
 there are two Highways;
one the common Road, which is usu∣ally
bad; the other the King's High∣way,
very fair and even, peculiar to the
Court, and such as it has a mind to fa∣vour
in bestowing on them a Key to
open the several Gates that are upon it.


In this Chapter of the Court, it will
not be improper to take notice that
there are in 
Denmark
 two Orders of
Knighthood, 
viz.
 that of the 
Elephant,

and that of 
Dannebrug;
 the former is
very honourable, and the Companions
of it are of the highest Quality, or ex∣traordinary
Merit. Their Badge is an
Elephant with a Castle on its back, set
with Diamonds, and hung on a watered
Sky-coloured Ribband, worn as the

George
 is in 
England.
 The later is the
honorary Reward of inferior Gentle∣men
or Noblemen: their Badge is a
white Ribband with red Edges, worn


over the contrary shoulder with a small
Cross of Diamonds hung to it, and an
Embroidery on the Breast of their Coats
like a Star, in which is the Motto, 
Pi
∣tate
& Justitia.
 They say that the Order
of the 
Elephant
 was instituted about
Two hundred and ten years ago by King

Christian
 the First, at the Wedding of
his Son.




A List of the present Companions of it
follows.


The King Sovereign of the Order.


PRince Royal.


Prince 
Christian.


Prince 
Charles.


Prince 
George.


The King of 
Sweden.


Elector of 
Brandenburg.


Elector of 
Saxony.

Holstein.

 his Brother.

 Baden Durlach.


Duke of 
Ostfrize.


Duke of 
Saxe Cobourg.


Prince 
Frederick

Saxe.


Duke of 
Wirtemberg.


The Mareschal Count 
Wedell.


Count 
Reventlau.


Count 
Alefeldt.


General Admiral 
Juel.


Baron 
Juel.


Justin Hoeg 
under Viceroy of
 Norway.


Godtske van Buckvalt, 
a Gentleman of

Holstein.


Monsieur 
de Ginkle,
 Earl of 
Athlone.




They pretend that the Order of 
Dan∣nebrug

is more Ancient, and recount
many Fables of its Original, 
viz.
 That
one King 
Dan
 saw a white Cross with
red Edges, descend from Heaven, and
thereupon instituted the Order, and
gave it this compound Name, from 
Dan

and 
Brug,
 which signifies Painting.
The Knights of this Order are almost as
common here, as Baronets with us, and
therefore I omit their Names.


The following Ordonnance for Rank
and Precedency was published in 
Danish

and 
French, Anno
 1680. But most of the
Offices therein marked are now vacant.

CHAP. XII.




The Disposition and Inclinations of the
King of 
Denmark
 towards his
Neighbours.




THE Kingdoms and States which
border upon the King of 
Den∣mark,

are towards the North and North∣east,
the Territories belonging to 
Sweden;

towards the South, the Duke of 
Hol∣stein's



part of 
Sleswick
 and 
Holstein,
 the
City of 
Hamburg,
 and the Dutchy of

Bremen.
 Towards the West and South∣west,

England,
 and 
Scotland;
 which are
separated from them by the main Oce∣an.
Towards the South-east the Duke∣doms
of 
Saxe Lawenburg,
 of 
Mecklen∣burg

and of 
Lunenburg.
 The Dominions
of 
Brandenburgh,
 &c. lye also this way
not far distant from them.


Between the King of 
Denmark,
 and
most of these Neighbours, it may be
said in general, that there always is a
reciprocal Jealousy and Distrust, which
often breaks out into open Hostilities;
with those nearer more frequently, with
the remoter more seldom, according as
the occasions of quarrel or revenge do
happen.


The interposition of a vast Ocean has
hitherto kept the 
Danes
 in pretty good
terms with 
England
 and 
Scotland,
 and
the Trade they have with those King∣doms
is very considerable to them;
their Maritime Forces are in no measure
sufficient to cope with us and others con∣cern'd,
otherwise they have had a good
mind to challenge the sole right of the

Groenland
 Whale-fishing; as pretending
that Countrey to be a discovery of


theirs, and therefore to belong to them.


Since the present Wars with 
France,

and our strict Union with the 
Hollan∣ders,

they have shown themselves ex∣treme
jealous of our Greatness at Sea,
fearing lest we should ingross and com∣mand
the whole Trade of the World;
and therefore have favoured 
France
 on
all occasions, as much as they durst, fur∣nishing
it with Naval Stores, and other
Commodities which it wants. And for
this reason (notwithstanding their scar∣city
of Money) they will hardly be per∣suaded
either to lend or sell any more
Forces to the Confederates. Neither is
it to be doubted, but that as well to keep
the balance of the Sea Power even, as to
secure the liberty of their Commerce,
which brings them in great Gains, they
will leave no Stone unturned to do us a
Mischief, in order to humble us to such
a degree as may put them out of fears,
that we shall give law to the Ocean. To
this end they have entred into stricter
Alliances with 
Sweden
 of late, for a mu∣tual
Vindication of open Commerce,
than the natural Animosities between
those Northern Crowns did seem to ad∣mit
of; but the present apparent neces∣sity
of restraining within Bounds our


growing united Power at Sea, works
more prevalently with them both, than
the ancient hatred which they retain for
each other; and which may break out a∣gain,
as soon as they are out of fear of us.


For 
Sweden
 is the most powerful,
most dreaded, and nearest Neighbour of

Denmark;
 the Territories of that King
lye as it were at the Gates of 
Copenhagen,

the Capital City, and may be seen from
the very Bedchamber of this King, ever
since the 
Danes
 lost three of their best
Provinces on the other side the 
Baltick;

so that as well the Resentment of past
Injuries, as the dread of future Mis∣chiefs
from the greatness of 
Sweden
 on
the one side; the consciousness of be∣ing
violent possessors of anothers Right,
the certainty of their being hated and
envied for those Acquisitions, the fear of
losing them in case 
Denmark
 grow pow∣erful
on the other, are unsurmountable
Obstacles to any firm Friendship be∣tween
these two Crowns. The ancient
Quarrel, like a Wound ill healed, is but
skinned over, and festers at the bottom,
altho our equally disobliging them in the
interruption of their Traffick, has made
a greater step towards their mutual Re∣conciliation,
than was thought to be


practicable. But whenever we please to
caress the one at the expence of the o∣ther,
this seeming Knot will discover
the weakness of its contexture, and pro∣bably
dissolve of it self.


Neither is the Alliance by the King
of 
Sweden's
 having married the other's
Sister,
 of any moment towards a good
Correspondence, but rather the contra∣ry.
The King of 
Sweden,
 tho a very vir∣tuous
Prince, shews coldness and indif∣ference
enough (upon this account, as
it is thought) towards his Queen, who
is a very accomplished Princess; and ei∣ther
has, or thinks he has reason to avoid
a further Matrimonial Tye with the

Dane:
 therefore he chose rather to Con∣tract
his only Daughter with the young
Prince of 
Holstein Gottorp,
 whose E∣states
are in a manner wasted and ruin∣ed,
than with the Prince Royal of 
Den∣mark;

for having but one Son, in case
of whose death this Daughter would
be Heiress of his Crown, he thinks it
not prudence to leave it to so near a ha∣zard
and probability, that the 
Dane
 may
be one day Master of both Kingdoms.


Upon the Foundation of this mutual
Jealousy, are built the Friendships and
Enmities which each of them (but


especially 
Denmark
) have with most of
their other Neighbours, and the rest of
the 
German
 Princes. And upon this ac∣count
it is principally that the Animosity
is so great between this Crown and the
Princes of 
Lunenburg;
 with whom, on
the contrary, the 
Swede
 has always kept
a good Correspondence, that upon oc∣casion
of any Attack made on his Terri∣tories
in the Circle of 
Lower Saxony,
 or
in 
Pomerania,
 (which are looked upon
by the rest of the 
German
 Princes with
an evil Eye) he may secure to himself
the Assistance of that powerful Family
against the 
Dane
 or 
Brandenburger;

therefore the neighbourhood of the

Lunenburg
 Princes will always be grie∣vous
to, and suspected by 
Denmark,

which will obstruct by all means it can,
the Accessions either of Territories or
Honours to that Family. So that it is not
to be supposed that the 
Dane
 will quiet∣ly
sit down with the Duke of 
Zell's

thrusting himself into the possession of
the Dutchy of 
Saxe Lawenburg,
 which
borders immediately upon 
Holstein;
 nor
with the determination of the Imperial
Diet in favour of the Ninth Electorate
conferred on the Duke of 
Hannover.

On the other hand it is thought that the



Swede,
 in order to the further curbing of

Denmark,
 will uphold the 
Lunenburg
 Fa∣mily
in its Acquisitions; in the matter
of the Electorate openly and above∣board;
in the other of 
Saxe Lawenburg

secretly, because of the invalidity of
the Title of that Family to that Dutchy;
which seems to be no longer good than it
can be maintained by force or conni∣vance.


The Princes of 
Lunenburg
 have also
hitherto seconded the 
Swedes
 Intentions,
in being the Guardians of 
Hamburg,
 up∣on
which City the King of 
Denmark

casts a longing Look, and has made fre∣quent
Attempts. His pretensions to it
as part of his Dutchy of 
Holstein,
 are
none of the weakest, but his Arms and
Councils in order to the Reduction of it
under his Power, have been unsuccessful.
He encourages his new Town of 
Altena

(which is built close under its Walls)
as a Rival, and which one day may be
a curb to it. And in truth, this rich City
has great reason to be jealous of such a
Neighbour, whose chiefest Ambition is
to destroy its Liberty, and render him∣self
its Master. But the Duke of 
Zell

(whose Territories lye next) has al∣ways
some Forces posted near enough


to prevent the King of 
Denmark's
 De∣signs
upon it; therefore this City pays a
great deal of respect to those Princes,
whom it looks on as its best Protectors.
With the other 
German
 Princes it keeps
also as good a Correspondence as possi∣ble;
and they on their part shew an af∣fection
to the Liberty of that City, the
Reduction of which, under the Power
of the 
Danes,
 would be extremely in∣convenient
to them, as well upon the
score of the Trade of great part of 
Ger∣many,

whereof it is the Seat and Princi∣pal
Mart by its convenient Situation on
the River 
Elb;
 as upon the score of the
great Addition such a Conquest would
make to the Power of the 
Danes;
 who
are usually ill Neighbours when they
are weak, but would be insupportable
were their Force proportionable to their
Inclinations.


Nor would the 
Brandenburgers
 wish
that this City, or the Town of 
Lubeck,

should have any Master, but would en∣deavour
to their utmost to frustrate At∣tempts
upon them, and yet the Elector
of 
Brandenburg
 is esteemed the firmest
Ally the King of 
Denmark
 has; for their
common interest to prevent the Great∣ness
of the 
Swedes,
 (whereof they are


equally jealous and fearful) unites these
two Princes stronger than any tye of
Blood could do. The Ducal 
Prussia,
 and
that part of 
Pomerania
 which belongs
to 
Brandenburg,
 lies open to the 
Swedes;

and the least transport of Forces from

Sweden
 to 
Germany
 side of the 
Baltick

gives a terrible Alarm to all the Neigh∣bours.
They cannot forget the strange
Successes of 
Gustavus Adolphus,
 nor the
Encroachments of 
Sweden
 in the late
Wars; neither can they be otherwise
persuaded, but that there is always im∣pending
danger of the like Attempts
from the same Nation, abounding in
Soldiers, and ruled by a frugal, diligent,
and active young King. So that, as I
said before, their common danger makes
them strangely concur in this design of
keeping the 
Swede
 within his due Bounds,
altho in other matters some disagreement
may happen between them; as may be
more particularly instanced in the Affair
of St. 
Thomas
's Island, and in the 
Bran∣denburgers

endeavours to force the 
Dane

to a Restitution of the Duke of 
Holstein
Gotorp
 to his Countrey; which was so
happily accomplished by his Majesty of

Great Britain,
 the very first year of his
Exaltation to the Throne.


The Duke of 
Holstein
 
Gotorp
 (whom
I have purposely mentioned last of those
Princes that confine with 
Denmark,
 that
I may have an opportunity to speak
more amply concerning his Case) is
nearly related to the King of 
Denmark,

both by Consanguinity and Affinity.
They are of the same Family of 
Olden∣burg;

the Ancestor of the present Duke
refused the Kingdom of 
Denmark,
 in fa∣vour
of the Ancestor of the King;
whom he recommended to the Peoples
Election. This Duke is married to the
King's Sister, by whom he has Issue a
very hopeful Prince; his Territories
are intermixt both in 
Sleswick
 and 
Hol∣stein

with the King's, but much to his
disquiet and inconvenience; for Ambi∣tion
knows no bounds, especially when
joined with Power sufficient to oppress
a weak Opponent. The King thought
it for his Interest (and that is esteemed
reason enough with most Princes) to
be Master of the whole Countrey;
which the Duke being sensible of, and
convinced that the first convenient op∣portunity
would be taken to dispossess
him, to secure himself, cultivated as
strong a Friendship as he could with
the King of 
Sweden
 his Brother in-Law,


and one who upon many accounts was
bound to hinder the Greatness of the

Danes.
 Yet this Confederacy reached
no farther, nor was ever intended to be
made use of by the Duke otherwise than
as a Defensive Guard, the Reputation
whereof might possibly shelter him from
Oppression. For the Duke was of him∣self
much too weak to oppose the King,
and the Succours of the 
Swede
 too far
distant to frustrate a sudden Attempt,
to which he lay constantly exposed.
But in regard that at long run this Al∣liance
would stand him in greatest stead
(as he has found by Experience) it
was always most carefully cherished and
maintained on the Duke's part, and no
less on the King's, who did, and ever
will think it of great advantage to him
to uphold the Duke of 
Holstein
 in his
lawful Rights; and no less detrimental
to his Enemy; this Duke being the seve∣rest
Thorn in the Foot of the King of

Denmark,
 and the greatest Mortification
to him that can possibly be imagined;
who now of a near Kinsman and Bro∣ther,
by his ill usage has made an utter
Enemy, that (notwithstanding the
present Composure of Differences) can
neither trust him, nor be trusted by him.


For the better understanding of which
it will not be amiss in another Chapter
to give a short account of the Proceed∣ings
in that whole Matter.






CHAP. XIII.




The manner of dispossessing, and re∣storing
the Duke of 
Holstein Got∣torp.




THE Affairs between the King and
Duke being on the terms above∣mentioned,
that is to say, Ambition and
Reason of State guiding the Designs of
one Party, Fear and Weakness of the o∣ther,
Hatred and Distrust of both; there
seemed to be wanting nothing but a fair
Opportunity to put in practice what had
been long projected by the 
Danes,
 which
at length happened in the year 1675.


Among other Differences which re∣mained
to be adjusted between the King
and Duke, the Succession to the Coun∣ties
of 
Oldenburg
 and 
Lelmenhorst
 was
the greatest; this was at length left to
the determination of the Imperial Court;
but whilst it was under debate there,
several meetings between the Ministers


of 
Denmark
 and those of 
Gottorp
 were
appointed, in order to an amicable com∣posure
of this and all other Quarrels;
which Meetings were principally sought
after by the King, with all the seeming
desires of Amity, and Appearances of
Friendship imaginable, the better to lull
the Duke into Security, and a Persuasion
of the Sincerity of his Intentions. Some∣times
an Equivalent for the sole posses∣sion
of those Counties was proposed and
hearkened to, and the whole Matter
seemed to want nothing but fair drawing
up, and the Ratification. At other times
fresh Disputes arose touching the Taxes
of the Dukedoms of 
Sleswick
 and 
Hol∣stein,

whereof the King challenged the
greater part to himself, in proportion
to the share of Forces which he main∣tained
for Defence of the Countrey. On
the other side, the Duke insisted on it,
that the Taxes ought equally to be divi∣ded;
and if the King kept up more
Troops than were necessary, that did
not any way prejudice his right to an
equal share of the Revenues, especially
since the King's undertakings were ma∣naged
neither with any previous Com∣munication
with, or consent of the
Duke; nor were agreed unto by the


States of the Dukedom, both which by
ancient Treaties ought to have been
done. But this Ball was either kept up,
or let fall, according to the Circumstan∣ces
of Affairs abroad, which the 
Danes

had a watchful Eye upon, at the same
time that they treated with the Duke.


For the 
Swedes
 having taken the part
of 
France
 against the Empire, were at
this time engaged in a War with the E∣lector
of 
Brandenburg.
 And the 
Danes

who had long since resolved to break
with 
Sweden,
 thought no time so proper
as this to revenge their ancient Quarrel,
and to regain their lost Provinces. But
looking upon the Duke of 
Holstein
 as a
Friend to 
Sweden,
 and a main Obstacle
to their Intentions, they durst not march
their Army out of the Countrey, till
they had so ordered Matters as to ap∣prehend
no danger from him.


A deep Dissimulation was necessary
to the carrying on this Design upon the

Swedes
 and House of 
Gottorp;
 and was
made use of with so much Address, that
the 
Swedish
 Ambassador, who was then
residing at 
Copenhagen,
 and negotiating
a Marriage for the King his Master with
the Daughter of 
Denmark,
 was caressed
in an extraordinary manner, and treated


with the greatest Demonstrations of
Friendship possible: And at the same
time the Prime Minister of 
Denmark

wrote most obligingly to the Duke's
Resident then at 
Hamburg,
 That he
was ready to meet him half way, and
would join endeavours with him to ad∣just
all Differences, and establish a firm
Correspondence between their Masters,
which he said he desired above all things.
He added moreover, that when willing
Minds met together about the Compo∣sure
of Differences, a few hours would
put an end to that which had been trans∣acting
many years; and therefore con∣jured
him to meet him. The King also
did often declare himself to this purpose
to the Duke's Ministers, That he would
acknowledge, as a great Obligation con∣ferred
on him, the furthering an Accom∣modation
between him and the Duke.


'Tis the Custom of the King of 
Den∣mark

to make once a Year a Voyage into

Holstein,
 where he assembles and takes a
review of his Troops. This is done not
only upon the score of Diversion, and
to see that the Forces be in good Condi∣tion;
but also to use the neighbouring
Princes and 
Hamburgh
 to such a practice;
that when they see it performed several


years without any ill Consequence, or
Attempts upon them, they may take the
less Umbrage, and be less upon their
Guard, whenever he should have any
real Design. About this time the King
was beginning such a Journey, in order
to put his Projects in Execution; and
to lull the Duke into a deeper Secu∣rity,
writes to him very kind Letters,
desiring him not to be concerned at it,
since he had no other end in it than for∣merly
in the like Voyages, unless it
were to put a final determination to all
Differences between them to their mu∣tual
satisfaction. The Duke was so plea∣sed
by these Assurances under the King's
Hand, that he went in Person to meet
his Majesty, accompanied by his Brother
the Bishop of 
Lubeck,
 and many others
of the Nobility; and afterwards treated
him very splendidly at a House of his
upon the Road near his Residence of

Gottorp;
 the King then caressing him,
and desiring him earnestly to come and
see him at 
Rendsburg
 (a fortified Town
about fourteen 
English
 miles from
thence) near which the Rendezvous
of the Troops was appointed. Towards
the conclusion of this Feast several large
Healths were drank to the future good


Agreement, with so much appearing
Sincerity, that the good Duke thought
he had no reason to doubt the reality of
it; but ordered his Chief Minister to
wait upon the King and his Ministers at

Rendsburg;
 where they so far accommo∣dated
all Matters, that the whole Af∣fair
was supposed near its Conclusion.


Upon this the Duke sends three of
his chief Counsellors, impowered by a
special Commission, to treat and con∣clude
at 
Rendsburg;
 with whom three
of the King's Council met, and confer∣red.
The business of the Conference was
principally about the Exchange of other
Lands for the Counties of 
Oldenburg
 and

Delmenhorst;
 but in it the King's Com∣missioners
took occasion to renew the
Debate about the division of the Taxes,
whereof, as I have said before, the King
challenged the greater part: This did a
little surprize and displease the Duke's
Commissioners, who thought it forreign
to the matter in hand, and would not
hearken to Proposals of that nature.


At the very same time, and during
this Conference, the King's Prime Mi∣nister
wrote to the Duke's, That he
thought it necessary for both Princes,
that the Duke of 
Gottorp
 would please


to come to 
Rendsburg
 to the King, who
was ready to conclude a Treaty; because
the Presence of so near a Relation would
contribute more than any thing else to a
Friendly Composure of all these matters.
And the Duke, as well upon the account
of the former Invitation, as upon this
fresh one, withal to shew his forward∣ness
towards a Peace, resolves upon the
Visit; first sending a Gentleman to ac∣quaint
the King with his intention, and
desiring his permission to come and wait
upon him. The King's Answer was,
That he should be heartily welcome, and
his Chief Minister also, whom he desi∣red
to bring along with him. Thus the
Duke being fully persuaded that all was
meant honourably, on the 25
th.
 of 
June

began his Journey, accompanied by his
Minister and other Nobility, and arrived
at 
Rendsburg;
 where he was welcomed
by a discharge of all the Cannon of that
Fortress, and other demonstrations of
Joy.


The next day, being the 26th. of

June
 1675. a fatal one to that unfortu∣nate
Prince and his Family, an Express
arrives with Letters of the great De∣feat
given the 
Swedes
 by the 
Branden∣burgers

at 
Fehr Berlin:
 this was what


the 
Danes
 wished and waited for; but
could scarce promise themselves it should
succeed so fully according to their expe∣ctations,
or nick the time so justly as it
did. They thought Heaven it self con∣curred
with their Intentions; and not
to be wanting on their parts, immedi∣ately
give orders to shut the Town
Gates, to call a Council of War, to send
their Soldiers up and down, and seize
all the Duke's Towns and Fortresses.
These Orders were as suddenly execu∣ted:
the Duke's Troop of Guards were
disarmed, himself confined a Prisoner to
his Apartment; his Dinner, which he
thought to have eaten with the King,
was brought in to him by Officers and
Soldiers, who watched him so narrowly
that he could not stir; the poor Duke
exclaiming in the mean while, and com∣plaining
that he was ill used; that he
was a Sovereign Prince of the Empire,
independant of any other Power; that
he was a near Kinsman, a Brother-in-Law,
nay, an invited Guest of the Kings;
that all the Laws of Justice, of Blood,
of Friendship and Hospitality were viola∣ted
by this Action, wherein the King had
broken his Parol, and the Sanctuary of
his own House. But all this was in vain;


the Duke had no Remedy prescribed to
him, but Patience; the Blow which was
begun, must be followed, and more Evils
must succeed that which had already
happened.


For the Duke being thus seized, his
Ministers were presently sent for, and told,
That now there was an end of all Treat∣ing,
that the King was Master, and
would act as such: To which purpose he
would take possession of the Duke's whole
Country, and put Garrisons into all the
strong Places which he thought proper to
secure to himself, because he had an inten∣tion
to lead his Army elsewhere against
the 
Swedes;
 that the Inclinations of the
House of 
Gottorp
 were always malevolent
towards the King, and by him considered
as such; however if the Duke would
fairly and freely renounce his Right to
the Lands in question, the King might,
at the Duke's request, be prevailed upon
to give him an hundred and fifty thou∣sand

Rix Dollers
 at 
Copenhagen
 for it.


Notwithstanding the Extremity the
Duke was reduced to, he could not be
brought to consent to such a severe Con∣dition;
but offered, since Matters could
be no better, that the King without pre∣judice
to his Right, should have the Taxes


so much contested, in the manner he de∣sired;
that his Majesty should put one
half of the Garrison into the strong
Town of 
Tonningen,
 provided that all
therein did take the Oaths of Allegiance
to both Princes, till such time as the Exi∣gencies
of Affairs would permit the en∣tire
Restoration of it to its former Ma¦ster:
That if the King would dispose of
his Countrey solely, the Duke must yield
to force, but hoped his Right should be
reserved entire, and desired that his Re∣sidence
and Habitation of 
Gottorp,
 which
was neither by Nature nor Art strong e∣nough
to be formidable, might be left
free to him: Lastly, That the King would
grant him and his liberty to dispose of
themselves as they thought fit.


The 
Danes
 Answer was, That these
Offers and Demands were no other than
Trifles; That the King would proceed
to the Execution of his own Will and
Pleasure by Force and Arms; that neither
the Duke, nor any of his, should ever
be restored to their Liberty till he had
signed an Instrument there ready drawn
up, to order the Commander of 
Ton∣ningen

to Surrender it to the King;
which the Duke at last, through despair
of his Life, was forced to consent to;


and accordingly that Fortress, with all
its Cannon and Stores, was delivered
up to the Officer sent by the King for
that purpose.


Things being brought to this pass, the
Duke was removed to his own House at

Gottorp.
 His Dutchess, who had been
all this while at 
Copenhagen,
 and as it
was thought consented to all the Inju∣stices
acted against her Husband and Fa∣mily,
was restored to him; but he was
in effect a Prisoner still; for Guards
were placed at all the Avenues, every
day some new severe Conditions were
proposed to him, and Articles offered
him which he was forced to sign: one
of which was a Renunciation of his Su∣pream
and Independent Right over the
Dukedom of 
Sleswick.
 Being at last
quite tired with so many Violences, not
knowing where they might end, he be∣gan
to think of his Escape: so that one
day taking the Advantage of his Dutch∣esses
being sent for again by her Mother,
the Queen Dowager of 
Denmark,
 he
pretended to accompany her part of the
way; and by the means of some trusty
Servants, had re-lays of Horses placed
in convenient stations. After a few hours
travelling with her, he took his leave of


her, and pretending to hunt, set Spurs
to his Horse, and rid away as fast as he
could towards 
Hamburg.


The Allarm was presently given of
the Duke's flight, and many Horsemen
were dispatched after him, which he be∣ing
aware of, took not the direct Road,
but went about by 
Kiel;
 so that, after
a narrow escape, he arrived safely where
he designed. This mightily vexed the
King, who used all means to get him
out of that City, because 
Hamburg
 be∣ing
so populous a Town, the fame of
the Barbarity exercised against him flew
from thence all over 
Europe.
 But the
Duke had been taught by former Mis∣fortunes
not to trust his Enemy; and
as soon as he got to 
Hamburg,
 so∣lemnly
protested against the validity of
all that he had been constrained to a∣gree
to, whilst he was in Durance; yet
withal declared, That he was as ready
as ever to come to an amicable Com∣posure
of Differences with the King, to
prevent the ruin of his Subjects, and o∣ther
Mischiefs; provided the King would
redress some of the greatest Grievances.
This Proposition was so little regarded,
that instead of hearkning to it, the King
ordered the Fortress of 
Toningen
 to be


demolished, the Dukedom of 
Sleswick
 to
be sequestred, the Magistrates and Peo∣ple
to be absolved from their Allegi∣ance
to the Duke, and obliged to an Oath
of Fidelity to the King; all the Revenues
of the Duke to be brought into his
Treasury; Garisons to be continued in
the Duke's Forts and Mansion-house, and
unless the Duke came to accept of the
King's terms in relation to that Fief, that it
should for ever be annexed to the Crown
of 
Denmark.


For the more speedy publication of
these new Orders, Proclamations were
made and affixed to that effect in all
the Towns of the Dukedom. The Duke
on his part publishing others in oppositi∣on
to this Usurpation, together with a
Solemn Protestation against all that had
been done; concluding with a Com∣mand
to the States of the Dukedom,
and the rest of his Subjects, to conti∣nue
firm in their Loyalty and Obedience
to their Natural Prince.


But the King, who was resolved no
longer to keep any Measures with him,
nor to preserve that Countrey in any to∣lerable
condition which he knew not
how long he might enjoy, exacted vast
Contributions from the poor Subjects, to


the value of many Millions of Gold, and
to the ruin of as flourishing a Province as
any in the Circle of 
Lower Saxony;
 there∣by
disabling the Duke's Subjects from
contributing any thing towards the Sub∣sistence
of their Master; who continued
all this while at 
Hamburg
 in a state little
befitting his high Quality; whilst he
sent his Son abroad to raise the Compas∣sion,
and implore the Assistance of all
all the Neighbouring 
German
 Princes;
on which Errand I had the Fortune to
meet him at the Courts of 
Hannover
 and

Wolfembuttel.
 He made also strong Ap∣plication
to the Crown of 
England,
 as
Guarantee of the 
Northern
 Peace, and
caused a full Representation of his discon∣solate
Condition to be printed in 
English,

which contains at large most of the Par∣ticulars
above-mentioned; but all in
vain: the Duke continued a Sufferer not∣withstanding
his many Appeals to those
who ought to have interessed themselves
in his behalf: until such time as the King
of 
Sweden
 began in earnest to take his
Cause in hand. This King having at
last brought the Affairs of his own King∣dom
into such a Posture as permitted him
to resent the Injuries done to his near Re∣lation,
threatned the 
Dane
 with a War


in case he delayed Restitution; and to
this effect, in the Year 1689. set a Fleet
to Sea, with intention to second his
Threats by Blows; which he might the
better then do, because the chief Sup∣port
of the 
Danes
 in their Injustice, (the

French
 King) was at that time attacked
by the Forces of the Confederates; and

England,
 by the Accession of his present
Majesty to that Crown, was become a
principal Party in so just a War. So that

France
 was likely to have its Hands full
at home. Besides, his Majesty of 
Great
Brittain
 being become Guarantee of the

Northern
 Peace, thought himself obli∣ged
in honour to maintain it; and in or∣der
to that end, gave such Instructions
to his Envoy Extraordinary, then going
to the 
Danish
 Court, as might induce it
to comply with Justice, and prevent that
Effusion of Blood which was threatned.
These Remonstrances had their due
weight with the King of 
Denmark;
 who
at last yielded to the necessity of his Cir∣cumstances,
and to the Solicitations of the
Elector of 
Brandenburg,
 who pressed a∣mong
the rest the Restoration of the
Duke, and had sent his Ministers to the
Congress for the Accommodation, to
propose a Project to that end; not so


much out of kindness to the Family of

Gottorp,
 as for fear the 
Swedish
 Arms
should by any just occasion be brought
over the 
Baltick;
 the event of which
might be fatal to all the Neighbourhood,
and to the 
Brandenburgers
 in particular.
Thus the 
Danes,
 with reluctancy, con∣sented
at last to give up what they had
unjustly detained above thirteen years
from its right Owner, after having rai∣sed
vast Sums of Money from the Coun∣trey:
for the Duke's part of the Dutchy
of 
Sleswick
 only, had about 28000
Ploughs in it, each of which were taxed
to pay four Crowns a Month: besides
innumerable other Extortions, which
filled the Purses of the Ministers of

Denmark,
 who shared the Revenues a∣mong
them. The 
Swedish
 and 
Danish

Fleets had been about a Fortnight at
Sea, but no Action had happened be∣tween
them. After the Accommodati∣on
was published, and the Duke resto∣red,
(yet without any reparation of Da∣mages
past) the two Fleets returned to
their several Ports, and the Duke to his
Habitation of 
Gottorp,
 which he found
in a desolate Condition, compared to
what he left it in. The 
Dutch
 had a
principal Hand in the Conclusion of this


Agreement, by the means of 
Myn Heer
Heemskirk
 their Minister; and his Maje∣sty
of 
Great Britain
 a large share of the
Glory of redressing a Wrong, which
through so many years possession plead∣ed
a kind of Prescription to warrant it;
the very first half year of his Reign vin∣dicating
the Honour of the Crown of

England,
 which was engaged as Guar∣rantee;
and securing the Peace of the
North, in order to the procuring the
Assistance of one, or both of those
Princes, towards the humbling the
common Enemy. This he effectu∣ally
did; for the 
Danes
 immedi∣ately
afterwards, sent by Treaty se∣ven
thousand Soldiers, which are yet
in his Majesty's Pay; and the 
Swedes
 re∣main
at liberty to continue such of their
Troops in the 
Dutch
 Service as formerly
were stipulated for, and which (had a
War broken out) they might have been
forced to recall.








CHAP. XIV.




The Interests of 
Denmark
 in relation
to other Princes.




IN treating of the Interests of the
King of 
Denmark
 in relation to other
Princes or States which do not confine
upon his Dominions, and of his Affecti∣ons
towards them, it will not be necessa∣ry
to observe strictly the order and rank
which those Princes hold in the World,
I shall therefore take them as they come
indifferently.


With the Emperor
 the King of 
Den∣mark

is obliged to keep always a good
outward Correspondence, he being him∣self
a Prince of the Empire, as Duke of

Holstein;
 and the Emperour having it
often in his Power to do him several
Kindnesses or Dis-kindnesses. The King
has a great desire to establish a Toll at

Glucstadt
 upon the River 
Elb;
 and al∣though
the Emperour's consent would
not absolutely secure the business for him,
there being many other Princes, toge∣ther
with all those who are concerned in
the Trade of 
Hamburg
 that would ob∣struct
it: yet it would strike a great


stroke, and must always be a necessary
Preliminary. He keeps therefore very
fair with his Imperial Majesty, and when
pressed by the Ministers, sends (for valu∣able
considerations) some Troops to serve
in 
Hungary
 against the 
Turks;
 notwith∣standing
which he is inwardly troubled
at the Power of the House of 
Austria,

and the Increase of its Dominions; be∣ing
jealous, as most of the other 
German

Princes are, that the Greatness of that
Family may one day turn to the de∣triment
of the Liberty of 
Germany:
 and
therefore is not displeased at the Suc∣cesses
of the 
French,
 or of the 
Turks.

He has been heard to complain of the
neglect which the Imperial Court shows
of him, and its partiality for the 
Swedes;

this occasioned the Emperour's sending
a Minister lately to Reside at 
Copenhagen,

as well as at 
Stockholm;
 since which he
seems to be better satisfied. But at the
bottom it is to be supposed, that the

Dane
 is no true Friend of the Empe∣rour's;
because he thinks his Imperial
Majesty favours some Interests opposite
to his, in conniving at the 
Lunenburgers

forcible possession of the Dukedom of

Saxe-Lawenburg,
 and bestowing the Ele∣ctoral
Dignity on that Family; the con∣firmation


of which the King of 
Den∣mark

opposes with all his Power.


With 
Poland
 the King of 
Denmark

has at present little occasion either of
Friendship or Enmity; there being but
small Correspondence between them;
yet he will rather chuse to keep that
Crown his Friend, than otherwise; be∣cause
it may one day stand him in stead
against the 
Swedes:
 And for this reason
it is that the Elector of 
Brandenburg,

whose Interest in that particular is much
the same with 
Denmark
's, maintains a
good Correspondence, and Entertains
a constant Minister at 
Warsaw.
 Besides,
the Port of 
Dantzick
 is convenient for all
that Trade in the 
Baltick,
 and the 
Danes

bring Corn, as well as other Merchandize
from thence. They keep likewise good
Amity with the other 
Hans Towns.


The King is upon fair terms with the
Duke of 
Courland,
 who has permitted
him to raise Men in his Countrey, the
Commander of which, one 
Poteamer,
 is
Brother to that Duke's prime Minister;
and the Soldiers are the best able to live
hardily, and to endure Fatigue of any in
the World.


It is the Interest of 
Denmark
 to be
well with the 
Dutch
 above all other Prin∣ces


in 
Europe,
 because of the great Reve∣nue
it receives from their Traffick, and
the Toll which they pay in the 
Sound:

Because also in case of a quarrel with 
Swe∣den,

or any other extremity, the King of

Denmark
 is certain of the Assistance of
the 
Hollanders;
 which is always sufficient
and ready to protect him, as has been ex∣perienced
in the former Wars between
the 
Northern
 Crowns: for the 
Dutch
 will
never suffer the Balance of the 
North
 to
lean too much to one side, their Interest
in the Trade of the 
Baltick
 being so con∣siderable;
but will take care to assist
the weaker with proportionable Suc∣cours;
which the conveniency of their
Situation, and their Naval Force per∣mits
them to do with greater ease than
any other. Notwithstanding all which
Considerations, there are frequent Occa∣sions
of Quarrel between the 
Dutch

and 
Danes;
 and the Friendship which
the latter have for the former (espe∣cially
since this War with 
France,
 and
the Convention made with 
England
 for
the Interruption of all Commerce with
that Kingdom) is very weak and un∣stable;
for besides that an Absolute
Monarchy, for other Reasons, can ne∣ver
throughly love a Republick, the



Danes
 are envious at the great Trade of
the 
Dutch;
 and count it a Disparage∣ment
that Merchants, as they call them,
should have it in their Power to give
Law to a Crowned Head. However, at
the bottom, 
Denmark
 would not be plea∣sed
that 
Holland
 should sink under the
Force of its Enemies, but would use
its best Endeavours to prevent it, though
possibly not before Matters were reduced
to so great an Extremity, as it might
be beyond the Ability of the 
Danes
 to
afford a timely Remedy.


The King of 
Denmark
 loves the Alli∣ance
of 
France,
 and keeps a stricter
Correspondence with that Crown than
with any other; though it be most cer∣tain
that the Maxims which he has learnt
from thence, and the Practices which
followed those Maxims, have been the
principal Occasion of that Kingdom's
present ill condition. But the King of

France
 by fair Words, large Promises,
and a little Money seasonably bestowed,
has had the knack to amuse this Court,
and to make it act as he pleases; not∣withstanding
the many Affronts, the ill
Successes, and the universal Misery which
through his means have attended it.
The Emissaries of 
France
 are thick sown


here; nothing pleases that is not accord∣ing
to the 
French
 Pattern, either in Dress,
Military Discipline, or Politicks: and
it is certain that a fitter could not be
followed by any Arbitrary Prince, pro∣vided
a due regard were had to the
force and strength to perform in propor∣tion
to the Design undertaken. But the
want of this Consideration has been fa∣tal
to 
Denmark; France
 had told this
King, that Soldiers are the only true
Riches of Princes, and this has made him
raise more than he knows what to do
with, unless he disturb his Neighbours;
which generally he does for the Interests
of 
France,
 though at last it turns to his
loss. So that 
Denmark
 resembles in
this point a Monster that is all Head
and no Body, all Soldiers and no Subjects;
and whenever a General Peace
comes to be established in 
Europe,
 which
shall set open Foreign Trade, and conse∣quently
spoil all the Advantages that his
Country enjoys at present, I cannot see
what will become of the Publick Affairs
here; for the Soldiers when disbanded,
being most of them Strangers, will re∣turn
to their respective Homes; and the
Revenues of these Kingdoms must sink
extreamly through the want of People,


and their Poverty. It seems therefore no
less than madness for the least and poor∣est
Kingdom of 
Europe
 to think of emu∣lating
with Success the richest, greatest,
and the most populous, and to take its
Measures from thence; as if there were
no difference between King and King:
So have I heard that the little Republick
of St. 
Marino
 in 
Italy,
 which consists but
of one small Town with the Mountain it
stands upon, and is scarce taken notice of
by Travellers, takes occasion to write to
the Republick of 
Venice
 sometimes, and
to stile it 
Our Sister,
 with as much Gravi∣ty
and Pride, as if it equalled the other
in Power. But the vanity of these poor

Italians
 proceeds no farther than words,
which does them no harm.


But the true Reasons which renders it
the Interest of 
Denmark
 to keep well with

France
 (and they are no weak ones)
are first, because they look upon that
Crown as the sole Ballance against the
Grandeur of the Emperour, and the
House of 
Austria,
 whose Power, as I said
before, is looked on by all the Princes
of 
Germany
 with a very jealous Eye; the
late Addition of the Crown of 
Hungary

to it, with its other Conquests on that
side from the 
Turks,
 the probability of


the 
Spanish
 Dominions falling to some
active Branch of it, and the remembrance
what havock the Emperour 
Charles
 the
Fifth, and his Successor, made among
the 
German
 Princes, when possess'd of the
like Advantages, makes the 
Danes
 as
well as the others, reflect seriously upon
what may happen hereafter, should

France
 be reduced to too low an ebb:
A second reason is, because they know
no other Naval Force able to contest the
intire Dominion of the Seas with the

English
 and 
Dutch;
 and they are wil∣ling
to keep the dispute about that Do∣minion
undetermin'd between the 
French

and us, that no Laws may be laid upon
Traffick, but that they may reap their
share of the Trade of the World; which
they think would be but small, should
that Point be once finally decided to our
Advantage. A third Reason and the most
forcible is, the Subsidies which the King
of 
Denmark
 draws from time to time
from 
France:
 a little ready money among
a necessitous People, carrying irresistable
Charms with it; And this has been the
drift of the 
French
 Policy in advising that
King to a greater Charge than he was
able to bear, under pretence that they
consulted his Honour and Grandeur,


whereas they only consulted their own
ends; being sure, after they had rendred
him and his Countrey Poor, that they
could buy him when they pleased. Yet
whenever the 
French
 Treasure shall come
so far to be exhausted, that a fairer bid∣der
appears; this piece of Policy will not
only fail the 
French,
 but turn to their
disadvantage.


With the Kings of 
Spain
 and 
Portugal

the 
Dane
 is in a state of indifferency.
Their Dominions are so far asunder, and
the business so little which they have
with each other, that there happen few
or no occasions, either of a Quarrel or
Friendship between them. Yet the

Danes
 have some small Trade for Salt
and Wine with each of these Princes
Subjects; and during this War make
some benefit of their Neutrality, by tran∣sporting
in their Ships the Effects of

French, English,
 and 
Dutch
 from one
Port to another. They have indeed some
Pretensions on the 
Spaniard
 for Arrears
of Subsidies owing to them ever since
the 
Danes
 took the part of the Confede∣rates
against 
France
 in the former War;
but they despair of obtaining them, un∣less
some unforeseen Accident put them
in a way of getting that Debt, the Ac∣compts


of which have hardly ever been
adjusted between them.


With the late Elector of 
Saxony
 the
King of 
Denmark
 kept a very good corre∣spondence;
the Elector having married
one of the King's Sisters, that Affinity
produced as amicable effects as could
be desired; insomuch that it begat a
Resolution of a nearer Union of the two
Families in a Match between the present
Elector (then Prince) and the King's on∣ly
Daughter; this proceeded as far as
a formal Contract, and the usual Mar∣riage
presents were Solemnly exchanged
in order to Consummation; when on a
sudden the old Elector died last year,
as he was leading an Army towards the

Rhine
 against the 
French,
 for the com∣mon
cause of 
Europe;
 the Death of this
Prince, among other Alterations, pro∣duced
this, that his Successor the pre∣sent
Elector being thereby become at
his own disposal, and having been for∣merly
very much in love with another
Lady, who is the present Electress; re∣fused
to compleat his Marriage with the
Daughter of 
Denmark,
 and sent back the
Presents which were given at the time
of the Contract. This Action of his
highly disgusted the King, Queen, and


the whole 
Danish
 Court; however, there
was no Remedy but patience; the E∣lector
was too remote to fear any Ef∣fects
of the 
Danes
 displeasure, and re∣solved
to pursue his own Inclinations in
the choice of a Wife, let the World say
and do what it would. Accordingly he
presently courted and married where he
fancied; leaving the 
Danes
 to digest this
Affront as well as they could; which
they will scarce forget this great while.
So that it is to be supposed the anci∣ent
Knot between the King and the
Electoral Family of 
Saxe
 is hereby
very much loosened; yet not so far as
to proceed to any open Breach, the
Elector's Excuses for this Action having
been received and acccepted of as some
sort of satisfaction.


With the Bishop of 
Munster,
 the King

of 
Denmark
 lives in good Amity, by
reason of his Neighbourhood to the
Counties of 
Oldenburg
 and 
Delmenhorst;

and for the most part has a Minister
residing in that Court. The like Friend∣ship
is between him and the other Prin∣ces
of 
Germany;
 particularly with the

Landtgrave
 of 
Hesse Cassel,
 who is Bro∣ther
to his Queen, and extreamly be∣loved
by her.



The King of 
Denmark
 has one Bro∣ther,

viz.


Prince 
George,
 born 1653. and married
to her Royal Highness the Princess

Ann,
 Sister to her Majesty of 
England:

And four Sisters, 
viz.


Anna Sophia,
 the Widow of the late Ele∣ctor
of 
Saxony.


Frederica Emilia,
 the Wife of the Duke
of 
Holstein.


Guillimetta Ernestina,
 Widow of the Pa∣latine
of the 
Rhine.


Ulrica Eleonora Sabina, 
the Queen of

Sweden.






CHAP. XV.




Of the Laws, Courts of Justice, 
&c.




SOME Naturalists observe, that there
is no Plant or Insect, how venomous
or mean soever, but is good for something
towards the use of man if rightly appli∣ed:
in like manner it may be said, That
several useful Lessons may be learnt, con∣ducing
to the benefit of Mankind, from
this Account of 
Denmark,
 provided
things be taken by the right handle.


Hitherto we have indeed met with


many things in it to be avoided, and
little deserving imitation: but being now
to speak of the 
Danish
 Laws, I must needs
begin with this good Character of them
in general, That for justice, Brevity, and
perspicuity, they exceed all that I know
in the World. They are grounded upon
Equity, and are all contained in one
Quarto Volume, written in the Lan∣guage
of the Country, with so much
plainness, that no Man, who can write
and read, is so ignorant, but he may
presently understand his own Case, and
plead it too if he pleases, without the
Assistance of Counsel or Attorney.


Here is none of that 
Chicane
 to be
found which destroys and raises so ma∣ny
great Estates in 
England;
 a very
few Advocates do the business of all the
Litigious Persons in these Kingdoms.
Neither are their Fees arbitrary or ex∣orbitant;
no Suit of what importance
soever hangs in suspence longer than
one Year and a Month: since a Man
may go through all the Courts, and
have Execution done within that time,
unless he be wanting to himself.


It may be replied to this, That the
scarcity of Money may be the principal
occasion of few Law-Suits and Lawyers.


It is not denied, and perhaps a right
sence of this was the first cause of so
good a Regulation of Justice: for since
the King was resolved to empty the
Pockets of his Subjects, it was not for
his advantage to permit others to do it,
and share the Gains with him. How∣ever,
thus much may with certainty be
averred, That the like Regulation would
not only agree with, but consummate
the happiness of a rich Country; and
this Instance of 
Denmark
 makes it evi∣dent
that such a Regulation is practi∣cable.


But to return to our purpose. In

Denmark,
 in the ordinary Proceedings
between Man and Man, there are three
Courts, every one of which has power
to give a definitive Sentence, and must
either Acquit or Condemn. Yet there
lies an Appeal from the lower to the
higher; and if the inferior Judge has
wilfully varied from the positive Law,
the Party wronged has Damages given
him, both from the Judge and his Ad∣versary.
Here is no removal of Actions
from one Court to another, where the
Parties may begin all again; but by way
of ordinary procedure from the lower
to the higher. The three Courts are


these, first, In Cities and Towns the

Byfoghts
 Court, to which in the Coun∣try
does answer the 
Herredsfougds
 Court.
Secondly, From thence lyes an Appeal
to the 
Landstag
 or general head Court
for the Province. Thirdly, From thence
to the Court called the 
Highright
 in 
Co∣penhagen,

where the King himself some∣times
sits in Person, and it is always
composed of the prime Nobility of the
Kingdom. The Judges in the two for∣mer
Courts are constituted indeed by
the King's Letters Patents 
durante bene∣placito;

but are punishable for any mis∣demeanors
committed, and condem∣ned
to make Reparation to the Party
injured for any Injustice by them done.
The City of 
Copenhagen
 has this particu∣lar
Privilege, that the Sentences past in
the 
Byfoghts
 Court, instead of passing
through the Provincial Court, are tried
by the Burgomaster and Common Coun∣cil,
and so proceed to the highest Court;
which resembles so far our High Court
of 
Chancery,
 that if any matter happen
so fall in debate, for the decision of
which there is not a positive Article to
be found in the Law (which rarely hap∣pens)
it is there determined by the King,
or by the others present, who are as it


were the Keepers of the King's Consci∣ence:
and all this were very well, were
it not that the first Article of the Law re∣serves
to the King the Privilege of ex∣plaining
or altering it at his pleasure.


In Matters relating to the Revenue,
the Rent-Chamber in 
Denmark
 resem∣bles
our Court of 
Exchequer:
 which
has also a Paymaster General belonging
to it; and sometimes there is a Court
composed of some Members of this
Rent-Chamber, the Admiralty, and the
Colledge of Commerce; before which
lyes the Appeals of Merchants whose
Goodshappen to be seiz'd for not having
paid the King's Duties.


The Sentences passed in the inferiour
Courts are sometimes biassed and par∣tial;
but not often, for fear of the
highest Court, where great regard is
had to Justice; insomuch that I knew
a Judge, who very hardly escaped being
fined for a Sentence passed against
an 
English
 Merchant; which Sentence
was presently reversed.


Indeed, whilst Monsieur 
Griffinfeldt

and Monsieur 
Wibbe
 were Chancellors,
there were mutterings, that the 
High
Court
 Sentences were not altogether
up to the rigour of the Law; but this


is very rare now, unless when a Cour∣tier
or Favourite is interessed in such
a Sentence; in which case, or in matters
wherein the King is concerned, you are
to expect little Justice, especially if it
relate to Money.


The Salaries of the Judges are but
small; they are paid out of the 
Exche∣quer,

and do not consist in Fees. The

Byfogd
 may have about one hundred

Rix Dollars
 yearly; and he pays himself
out of the Fines of Delinquents. In the
Country the 
Herredfogds
 have each of
them the Rent that is due to the King
for a Farm that stands rated at ten Tuns
of Hard-corn; he has besides from the
Plaintiff and Defendant for the Sentence
he passes, ten 
Stivers
 from each. And
the 
Byfogd
 or Judge in Cities and Towns,
double as much. Moreover, the con∣testing
Parties are bound to pay the
Clerk so much a sheet for the Paper,
in which is set down at large the whole
proceeding, and the Allegations of each
Party, whether they be Verbal or by
Libel, and at the close of all the Sen∣tence
it self. At the 
Byfogds
 Court, and
the 
Landstag,
 the Judge inserts the Law,
and adds the Reasons upon which his
Judgment is founded; but in the 
High


Right
 no Reason is given at all, or but
very seldom. And that no Clerk may
have it in his power to pick any Man's
Pocket by filling up many Sheets of
Paper, there are Limits set, beyond
which no man is obliged to pay. Eve∣ry
one may plead his own Cause that
pleases; however, it is the King's Or∣der
that the Magistrates take care to
have one or more Advocates (such as
they approve of) who are to plead
for the Poor, and for such as cannot
plead for themselves: upon the whole
matter, the Charges of the Law are
very easie; since a complaint may go
through the three Courts for fifty 
Rix
Dollars,
 which is less then twelve pound
Sterling; unless the Sum in question be
very great, and more than ordinary E∣vidences
to be written on Sealed Paper.
These Laws are so equitable and expedi∣tious,
that they are extreamly com∣mended
by Merchants and Strangers,
who have occasion to have recourse to
them. Neither is the smalness of the
Expence any Encouragement to those
that love going to Law; for the Laws
themselves provide effectually against
this Mischief, and take away the very
Root of Litigiousness: being so plain


and clear, that a troublesome Person ne∣ver
finds his Account in promoting
vexatious Suits, but meets with all the
Disappoiutments one would wish him.


In Criminal Matters a great Severi∣ty
of Justice is practised. You never
hear of any Person guilty of the Crime
of Treason against the King; the Go∣vernment
has rivetted it self so fast up∣on
the Bottom it now stands, that no
Body offers to wag so much as the
Tongue against it. There are no Clip∣pers
or Coiners, no Robbers upon the
High-way, nor House-breakers; which
conveniency of Arbitrary Goverment,
among the multitude of Mischiefs at∣tending
it, I have likewise observed in

France;
 perhaps because those Princes,
who are entire Masters of their Sub∣jects
Purses at pleasure, take more
effectual care of them as of their own,
and therefore use such means that none
shall plunder or cheat their People, for
the same reason that Folks kill Ver∣min
in Dove-Houses, 
viz.
 that they
may make the greater profit themselves.
The most usual Capital Crimes are Man∣slaughter
and Stealing: Execution is done
upon Offenders by beheading them with
a Sword at one stroke very dexterously;


the Headsman, tho infamous by his
place, so that no Body will come into his
Company, yet is commonly rich, having
other advantagious Employments that
no Body else dares undertake, 
viz.
 the
emptying all the Necessary Houses, the
removing all dead Dogs and Horses out
of Houses and Stables, or from before
Doors; for no 
Danish
 Servant will upon
any terms set a hand to either of these
Works, and the Executioner has his own
Rates for these base Offices, which he
performs by his under Servant, called the

Racker.


The Advocates are not bred as with
us in 
England
 in Publick Societies, such
as Inns of Court or Chancery; neither
take they any degrees of Barrister, Ser∣jeant,
or the like; but may take up
the Calling as they please, according to
their Inclinations or Abilities.


There are besides the three ordinary
Courts before mentioned, Commission∣ers
of the Admiralty, which they call
the 
Admiralty-Court;
 wherein Affairs
relating to the Sea are determined, such
as Prizes, Wrecks, Disputes with Pri∣vateers,
and the like.


There is likewise a Chancellary, which
consists of a number of Clerks, who


write and issue all the King's Orders,
give out Citations, transcribe Papers,
make the 
Latin
 Projects of Treaties
with Foreign Courts, according to the
Directions they receive. In short, they
are as it were under-Secretaries, and
were formerly subject to the Govern∣ment
of one whom they called a Chan∣cellor;
but since Monsieur 
Wibbe
's death,
that Employment has not been filled:
neither does it resemble our Place of
Chancellor in 
England.
 The Clerks of
this Office have some small Salary from
the King, and have moreover so much
for every Citation to the High Court,
and so much for every Order they is∣sue,
which they divide among them.


In 
Copenhagen
 there is a Publick Of∣ficer
appointed, called the 
Polity Master,

whose business is to keep good Orders
in Affairs relating to the City; he is to
see that the Merchants sell warrantable
Merchandize, that they do not inter∣fere
in one anothers Trades; and to
compose Differences on that account a∣mong
them; that the Publick Buildings,
Draw-bridges, and Canals be kept in
repair; that the Streets be paved, cleans∣ed,
and free of the Incumbrances of Bulks
and other Inconveniencies. That no


prohibited Goods be brought in; that
there be always plenty of Bread-Corn,
and sold at a moderate Price; that the
requisite Assistance in case of Fire be at
hand. And indeed the Orders taken in
this matter are very good; for there
are select Companies appointed to
watch and extinguish the Fire, no others
daring to approach within a certain di∣stance,
lest under pretence of bringing
help, they take the occasion to plunder.
The Chimney-sweepers are bound to
keep a Register of all Chimneys they
sweep, that in case of any ill Accident,
those by whose neglect or covetous∣ness
it happens, may be answerable for
it.No Torches or Flambeaux are al∣lowed
to be carried in the Streets, by
reason of the great quantities of Firr,
Timber, and the constant high Winds
which are here; instead of which all
Persons, even the Court it self, make
use of large round Lanthorns, carried at
the end of long sticks. The 
Polity∣Master

regulates also the price of Tra∣velling
in their open Waggons, and pu∣nishes
such as exact more than the esta∣blished
rate, if they be complained of;
also such as travel in the King's parti∣cular
Highway without permission; and


such as make use of Guns and Fowling-Pieces,
and bring in Venison, Fowl, and
Hares by stealth, or in times when they
are prohibited to be killed. He takes care
also to prevent and suppress Riots and
Disturbances of the Soldiers, who are
not permitted to walk the Streets after
the Tattoo has gone about; and in ge∣neral
of all other matters relating to or∣der,
quiet, and decency.


Among other good Regulations in

Denmark,
 I look upon that of the 
A∣pothecaries

to be none of the least com∣mendable;
for no man is permitted to
exercise that Trade, unless he be ap∣pointed
by the Colledge of 
Physicians,

and confirmed by the King himself.
There are but two allowed to the Ci∣ty
of 
Copenhagen,
 and one to every o∣ther
considerable Town. Their Shops
and Drugs are carefully visited twice or
thrice a year by the Magistrates, ac∣companied
by the Doctors of Physick;
and such Drugs as are either naught or
old, are taken from them and flung a∣way.
The prices of all these Drugs
are fixed, so that any Child may be
sent to an 
Apothecaries
 Shop without
hazard of being imposed upon; and
nothing is sold that is not exceeding


good, and at very moderate Rates.
They sell all for ready Money, yet keep
exact Books of what they sell, to whom,
and by whose Prescription: so that
the great Mischief of accidental or wil∣ful
Poysoning, so frequent in other
Countries, is either quite avoided; or
if practiced, easily discovered and punished.


The Government in the Country is
managed, by dividing it into several Di∣stricts
or Governments, called 
Stifts
Ampts,
 whereof there are in all seven,
of these, four are in 
Jutland,
 the other
three in the Islands. Each of these is a∣gain
subdivided into three lesser Juris∣dictions,
called 
Ampts.
 The 
Stifts-Ampts-man,

or Governor of a County
is commonly one of the best Quality
and Fortune in that part of the Country;
and this Charge answers to that of
Lord Lieutenant of our Counties in

England,
 or rather of 
Intendant
 in

France.
 The 
Ampt-man,
 or under-Go∣vernor
of a Hundred, or Balliage, is
generally a Gentleman of lesser Fortune,
who resides in the principal Town of
his District, and takes care of all Mat∣ters
relating to the Publick: as conveni∣ent
quartering of Soldiers, providing for


their March, collecting the King's Re∣venues,
giving orders to the Peasants
when employed about Publick Works,
or when the King travels. All this
they do themselves, or by inferiour
Officers, like our Bailiffs and Constables.
These Employments are for the most
part given by the King during life, and
are the principal Rewards of such as
have well deserved: he that has served
long and faithfully as a Forreign Mini∣ster,
or in any other considerable Civil
Post, is usually promoted upon a vacan∣cy
to be 
Stifts-Ampt-man
 of his Province;
provided his Estate and Interest there be
some way correspondent. The Grooms
of the King's Bed chamber, and other
Officers of the Court, upon their Mar∣riage,
or retiring from Court, are gra∣tified
with an 
Ampt,
 and sent to live at
home; provided they have served long,
and be in any favour. The King pays
to each of these a yearly Salary out of
his Treasury; to a 
Stifts-Ampts man

a thousand Crowns a year, to an 
Ampt-man

four hundred Crowns. The prin∣cipal
Advantages they reap from these
Employments, are these: First, That
being more considered and favoured at
Court than others, they escape better


at the time of a Publick Tax, and
can often find means to ease the Bur∣then
off their own Lands by inhancing
it upon others; neither will the Court
willingly give ear to Complaints a∣gainst
them. Secondly, They are very
much honoured and feared at home,
and have the Privilege to domineer o∣ver
the Peasants, and other their inferi∣ours
without control, unless they do it
too grosly, and beyond measure.


Before I conclude this Chapter,
I think it very pertinent to take notice,
That in 
Denmark
 there are no Sediti∣ons,
Mutinies, or Libels against the
Government; but all the People either
are or appear to be Lovers of their
King, notwithstanding their ill Treat∣ment,
and the hardships they groan
under. And I suppose one principal
Reason of this to be the Equality of the
Taxes, and the manner of Taxing. It
is not to be imagined by those that see
it not, what a comfort it is to the Suf∣ferers
to be ill used alike; for Poverty
and Riches being only such in propor∣tion;
provided men be treated like
their Neighbours, they grumble not;
that which vexes the Oppressed in most
Countries, (especially the Common


People, who are more than ordinary
envious) is to see their County, their
Parish, or their House taxed more in
proportion than their Neighbours: and
they have reason to be discontented at
this, for it brings real Poverty upon
those that are over-taxed; it does not
diminish the general Stock of the Sub∣jects
Money, which would keep all
Commodities and Necessaries at equal
and moderate Rates; but picks parti∣cular
mens Pockets, whilst it leaves o∣thers
rich and able to profit by the Ne∣cessities
of the Poor.


'Tis a certain sign of an ill Go∣vernment
where there are abundance of
Laws; but 'tis no certain sign of a
good one, where there are but a
few, as is plain in the case of 
Den∣mark.

However, this Blessing of few
and good Laws, is like a Grain of
Consolation to sweeten a World of
Bitterness, and enables them to bear
their other Hardships with more Ease
and Patience.








CHAP. XVI.




The State of Religion, of the Clergy,
and Learning, 
&c.




WHEN the Corruptions of the

Roman
 Church grew so intole∣rable
to many Nations in 
Europe,
 that
an Universal Reformation became ne∣cessary,

Denmark,
 among the rest of the
Northern Countries (which had been
less managed and more abused by the
Priests than the Southern) shook off that
yoke, and instead of the 
Roman-Catho∣lick,

embraced the Doctrine and Opi∣nions
of 
Martin Luther.
 King 
Frederick

the First, about one hundred and fifty
years since, brought these in, and esta∣blished
them so generally in his Domi∣nions,
that at this day there is no o∣ther
Religion here professed than the

Lutheran,
 if we will except the little
Reformed 
French
 Church of 
Copenhagen,

set up by the Queen, and one Popish
Chappel at 
Glucstadt,
 permitted about
ten years ago to a few Popish Families
in those parts; which is the first that has
been since the Reformation. This great
Unity in belief in the North (for 
Swe∣den

has it as well as 
Denmark
) is owing


to the Sincerity of those Princes that
began the Reformation there: for it is
likely they did it upon a pure religious
account, and therefore went effectually
to work in the Conversion of all their
Subjects, using proper means for such
a purpose; whereas in 
England,
 and else∣where,
Reasons of State and other By∣ends,
had at least as great a share in it
as Conviction of Conscience; so that the
business was done by halves, through
the unsettledness of our Princes in their
Opinions, who encouraged or connived
at a dissenting Party, according as their
worldly Interests led them. The vast
convenience to any Prince of having all
his Subjects of one Opinion, is visible in

Denmark;
 where there are no Factions
nor Disputes about Religion, which usu∣ally
have a great influence on any Go∣vernment;
but all are of one Mind, as
to the way of Salvation, and as to the
Duty they owe their Soveraign. This
cuts off occasion of Rebellion and Mu∣tiny
from many, who otherwise would
desire it, and seem to have reason e∣nough,
because of the heavy pressures
they lye under. As long as the Priests
are entirely dependant upon the Crown,
and the People absolutely governed by


the Priests in Matters of Conscience, as
they are here, the Prince may be as Ar∣bitrary
as he pleases, without running a∣ny
risque from his Subjects: in due con∣sideration
of which benefit, the Clergy
are very much favoured, and have
full scope given them to be as bigotted
as they please; which indeed they are
to a very great degree, having no com∣mon
Charity for any that differ from
them in Opinion, except the Church of

England;
 and to that they are very kind,
often saying, That there is no Essential
Difference between it and theirs, and
wishing that therewere an union of them
projected and perfected: wherein their
Design is not so much to reduce our
Ecclesiasticks to the low estate theirs are
in, as to raise their own to the Splendor
and Revenues of ours; which are the
principal Vertues they admire in us.
They have cast off the Opinions of

Rome
 in the Supremacy of the Pope, and
other Points; but they would retain the
Grandeur belonging to that Church, and
applaud us for doing both so dexterously:
so that I am confident the business of
Consubstantiation would make no diffe∣rence,
did Princes think it worth their
while to promote this Union. On the


other side, the 
Calvinist
 is hated by them
as much as the 
Papist;
 and the reason they
give is, because he is against absolute
Monarchy, and has a resisting Principle.


Notwithstanding this Flattery of the
Court, they are not admitted into civil
Affairs, nor have any thing to do in the
Government: neither are they encou∣raged
to appear about Court, or on Pub∣lick
Occasions; the Pulpit is their Pro∣vince,
and it is left free to them. Here
they take a vast Liberty of Reprehend∣ing
not only Vices, but particular per∣sons
of the highest quality, which no
body takes notice of, as long as they
keep to their own Trade. The com∣mon
People admire them for this bold∣ness,
and the best Subsistence of the
Priests in Cities and Towns being vo∣luntary
Benevolence, they take care to
cultivate the good Opinion of the Mobb,
whom they keep likewise in awe by the
practice of Confession before they Ad∣minister
the Sacrament, which every one
that receives is obliged to undergo; and
this they retain of the 
Romish Church,
 as
well as Crucifixes, and other Ceremonies.


There are six Superintendants in 
Den∣mark,

who take it very kindly to be
called 
Bishops,
 and 
My Lord; viz.
 one
in 
Zealand,
 one in 
Funen,
 and four in



Jutland
 There are also four in 
Norway.

These have no Temporalities, keep no
Ecclesiastical Courts, have no Cathedrals,
with Prebends, Canons, Deans, Sub∣deans,

&c.
 But are only 
primi inter pa∣res;

having the Rank above the inferi∣our
Clergy of their Province, and the
inspection into their Doctrine and Man∣ners.
The Revenue of the Bishop of

Copenhagen
 is about Two thousand 
Rix
Dollars
 yearly; the other Bishops of

Denmark
 have about Fifteen hundred 
Rix
Dollars,
 and of 
Norway
 One thousand

Rix Dollars;
 they are allowed to have
two or three Parishes each; their Ha∣bit
is common with that of the other
Ministers, 
viz.
 A plaited black Gown,
with short Sleeves, a large stiff Ruff a∣bout
the Neck, and a Cap with Edges,
like our Masters of Art, except that
theirs is round, and the others square.


Most of them understand 
English,
 and
draw the very best of their Divinity, as
they confess themselves, out of 
English

Books. Many of them have studied in

Oxford,
 who are more valued than the
others; they are very constant Preachers,
and never read their Sermons, but pro∣nounce
them with a great deal of Acti∣on.
Holy-days and Fast-days are obser∣ved
as solemnly as Sundays; and in 
Co∣penhagen



the City Gates are close shut
during Sermon time, so that no body can
go in or out. The Commonalty are great
frequenters of the Churches, which are
kept much more decently, cleanly, and
better adorned than with us: so that
they look almost as gaudy as the Popish
Churches.


They are all great Lovers of Organs,
and have many very good ones, with
skilful Organists, who entertain the Con∣gregation
with Musick, during half an
hour, either before or after Service.


Denmark
 has formerly produced very
Learned Men, Such as the famous Ma∣thematician

Tycho-Brahe,
 the 
Bartholines

for Physick and Anatomy, 
Borichius,
 who
died lately, and bequeathed a considera∣ble
Legacy to the University of 
Copenha∣gen.

But at present Learning is there at a
very low Ebb; yet 
Latin
 is more com∣monly
spoken by the Clergy than with
us. The Books that come out in Print are
very few, and those only some dull Trea∣tises
of Controversy against the 
Papists

and 
Calvinists.
 The 
Belles Lettres,
 or Gen∣tile
Learning are very much strangers
here, and will hardly be introduced till a
greater affluence among the Gentry
makes way for them. It is said that Ne∣cessity
is the Mother of Invention; which


may be true in some degree, but I am sure
too much Necessity depresses the Spirits,
and destroys it quite; neither is there any
Invention here, or tolerable Imitation of
what is brought in to them by Strangers.


There is but one University, which is
at 
Copenhagen,
 and that mean enough in
all respects; neither the Building nor
Revenues being comparable to those of
the worst of our single Colledges. The
Students wear black Cloaks, and live
scattered about the Town, after the man∣ner
of those in 
Leyden.
 Some of the Pro∣fessors
live in the House. Every year on
the King's Birth day they have a kind of
Act; the King honours them with his
presence, and the 
Rector Magnificus
 ha∣rangues
him with a 
Latin
 Speech, full of
as fulsome Flattery, as if 
Louis le Grand

were the Monarch to be entertained,
and a fawning Jesuit the Orator. At cer∣tain
Periods there are a few 
Danish
 Verses
sung by the ordinary singing Boys to very
indifferent Musick; and so the Farce ends.


There was in this King's Father's time
an University at 
Sora,
 a Town very plea∣santly
situated about Forty miles from
the City, where the Lodgings and Con∣veniencies
for studying much exceeded
those of 
Copenhagen:
 But the King had
occasion for the Revennes; so that now


it is desolate, and in its stead only a small
Grammar-shool erected.


The Provisions for the Poor are very
inconsiderable; formerly there was a
pretty store of Hospitals scatter'd up and
down the Country, but at present the Re∣venues
of most of these are diverted to
other uses, and those not Publick ones.


To conclude; I never knew any Coun∣try
where the Minds of the People were
more of one 
calibre
 and pitch than here;
you shall meet with none of extraordina∣ry
Parts or Qualifications, or excellent in
particular Studies and Trades; you see no
Enthusiasts, Mad-men, Natural Fools, or
fanciful Folks; but a certain equality of
Understanding reigns among them: eve∣ry
one keeps the ordinary beaten road of
sense, which in this Country is neitherthe
fairest nor the foulest, without deviating
to the right or left; yet I will add this
one Remark to their praise, that the Com∣mon
People do generally write and read.






The CONCLUSION.


IT has been a great Mistake among us,
That the Popish Religion is the only
one, of all the Christian Sects, proper to
introduce and establish Slavery in a Na∣tion,
insomuch that Popery and Slavery


have been thought inseparable: not to
derogate from the merit of the Roman∣Catholick
Perswasion, which has been
the Darling of so many Monarchs upon
that account; I shall make bold to say
that other Religions, and particularly
the 
Lutheran,
 has succeeded as effectual∣ly
in this Design as ever Popery did.' Tis
confest indeed that Popery would cer∣tainly
introduce Slavery, but 'tis denied
that the last cannot come in without the
assistance of the former; and whoever
takes the pains to visit the Protestant
Countries abroad, who have lost their
Liberty even since they changed their
Religion for a better, will be convinced
that it is not Popery as such, but the Do∣ctrine
of a blind Obedience in what Re∣ligion
soever it be found, that is the de∣struction
of the Liberty, and consequent∣ly
of all the Happiness of any Nation.
Nay, I am Perswaded that many are sa∣tisfied
the late King 
James
's Attempts to
bring in Popery was the principal thing
which rescued our Liberties from being
entirely swallowed up; there seeming
in his Reign, through the Interest and
Dishonesty of some, the Dissoluteness,
Laziness, and Ignorance of others, to
have been (in many mens Opinions) a
general tendency towards Slavery, which


would scarcely have been vigorously e∣nough
opposed, had he left the business
of Religion untouched; and if once in∣troduced,
it had been maintained more
effectually than in the days of Popery;
I say more effectually, because the de∣pendance
which the Romish Clergy and
Monks have on the Church of 
Rome,

causes often a clashing of Interests, and
derogates from that intire Obedience the
Subjects owe to the Prince, which is
preached up by that Church, as often as
the Sovereign acts according to their di∣rection,
and down again whenever he
displeases them; whereof we have had
frequent Examples in this Kingdom of

England,
 where there have been Bishops
and Abbots in the days of Popery, as
zealous Assertors of the Liberties of the
People, as any Lay-men could be, whe∣ther
out of a true Principle, or not, I will
not determine; but Occasions have been
taken by them to raise Tumults and
Wars, and in the Scuffle the Liberties of
the People (of which both King and
Church-men strove who should be the
Masters) have escaped untouched: but
in 
Denmark,
 as well as other Protestant
Countries of the 
North,
 through the en∣tire
and sole dependance of the Clergy
upon the Prince, without the interfering


of the Authority of any Spiritual Supe∣rior,
such as that of the Pope among the
Romanists: through their Principles and
Doctrine, which are those of unlimited
Obedience; through the Authority they
have with the Common People, 
&c
 sla∣very
seems to be more absolutely esta∣blished
than it is in 
France;
 as in effect
it is more practised; for that King's Sub∣jects
are better treated; there is a Name
of a Parliament at 
Paris,
 and other great
Towns, tho they meet for no other end,
but to verify the King's Edicts; there
is a formal Demand made of a Benevo∣lence,
or 
Don Gratuit
 in some Provinces,
which probably they have not the pow∣er
to deny; there is an encouragement
of Trade, Manufactures, Learning, 
&c.

all tending to the good of the People.
Besides, we see by experience, that that
King often has great quarrels with the
Court of 
Rome,
 which whensoever his
power is reduced to a lower ebb, that
his Clergy are not over-awed by it, may
produce such Divisions and Disturban∣ces
as possibly some Sparks of the Peo∣ple's
Liberty may again proceed from
the collision of two such hard Rocks:
but in the Countries I have Spoken
of, there is no hope of any Such re∣source;
all is swallowed up in the


King; Temporals and Spirituals,
Soul, Body, Estate, and Conscience; the
Army and the Priests are two sure
Cards: the Prince that has one of them
on his side, can hardly fail; but he that
has both depending on him, need fear
nothing from his own Subjects, let him
use them never so ill.


Much has been spoken and written by
several Authors of the rigor of the 
Turk∣ish

Government, let us consider some par∣ticulars
of it by way of comparison.


The 
Turks
 are the Conquerors of the

Christians
 in the Countries they have
over-run, and have a sort of barbarous
Right to use them ill; yet they never
persecute them upon account of Con∣science;
they suffer them for the most
part to inhabit and cultivate their own
Lands without disturbance, paying on∣ly
a 
Caratch
 yearly for Tribute; which
as I have been informed by a Minister
of his Imperial Majesty's, amounted in

Hungary, Sclavonia, Servia,
 and 
Bosnia,

only to about ten 
Dollars
 for an ordi∣nary
Family in time of Peace, and du∣ring
a War nothing. It is true, the
Propriety of all Lands in 
Turky
 is in
the Grand Signior; but whether it be
not better to be only a Farmer at an easie
Rent, than to have the Name of a Pro∣prietor


prietor without a comfortable Subsi∣stence,
and in effect to be Master of No∣thing,
I leave the Reader to judge.


The forcing away Children from the
poor Christian Parents, is accounted a
great hardship, though it be for the
worldly Profit and Advancement of
those Children; bating the point of Re∣ligion,
it is a far less Mischief to deprive
Parents of their Sons and Daughters, in
order to maintain them well, than to
leave a heavy Charge upon their Hands,
after having taken away the possibility
of Nourishing and Educating them.


The Sun, Soil, Climate, and Situati∣on,
with other Natural Advantages of
the Grand Signior's Dominions, as to
Profit and Pleasure, are infinitely be∣yond
those of other Northern Countries
that we are acquainted with. In 
Turky

the Harbours are always open, except
some few places in the 
Black Sea;
 where∣as
here they are frozen up three or four
Months in the Year. There the Fruits,
Flesh, Corn and Herbs, have double the
Virtue and Nourishment they have
here; the Wine there is good and plen∣tiful,
and the very Water wholsome and
pleasant; here the first is scarce, and the
last very bad. In a word, in some Chri∣stian
Countries of 
Europe,
 there seems to


be most of the Mischiefs of a Turkish
Government in an infinitely worse Cli∣mate:
Besides, we are to consider, that
the 
Turks
 themselves, who are Lords and
Masters, live well and pleasantly, and it
is their conquered Slaves whom they use
in the manner above-mentioned.


If it be enquired, Whether Matters
are like to last at the same rate they are
now at in 
Denmark?
 Though nothing
be more fallacious than a Judgment
made of the future, I shall not omit
speaking a few words in answer.


Many reasons might persuade one to
think, that the Government upon the
bottom it stands cannot last long. As in
the first place, that natural Love of Li∣berty,
which resided formerly in the
Northern Nations more eminently than
in other Parts of the World. What can
be expected less from the Descendants of
the ancient 
Goths
 and 
Vandals,
 who pro∣pagated
and establish'd Liberty in so ma∣ny
other Countries, than to shake a hea∣vy
Yoak off themselves, which their Fore∣fathers
were not able to bear? especially
since this Yoak is so extraordinary grie∣vous,
that the Chains which the Neigh∣bouring
Countries wear, are but Orna∣mental
ones, if compared with theirs.


Secondly, The freshness and newness


of this Alteration of their Condition. It
being no more than thirty two years
since it happened; and many remaining
yet alive, who remember the days of Li∣berty,
and in their private Discourses
with their Friends and Children make
Comparison between the past and pre∣sent
times, and condole with them the
loss of so great a Blessing; it might seem
that the Opinion of the present Govern∣ment's
not being sufficiently rooted, nor
having gained Authority by length of
time to settle, should encourage those
that find themselves grieved, to think of
Methods tending to a Change.


Thirdly, The Neighbourhood of the

Swedes,
 who have still their Eye upon

Denmark,
 and long to be sole Monarchs of
the North, and Masters of the 
Baltick-Sea.

Now the Burden being so great as
it is, one would think the Natives, in
hopes of Ease, would rather wish for,
than defend their Countrey from an In∣vader;
because they have little or no Pro∣perty
to lose, and imagine there is scarce
a possibility of changing for the worse.


Fourthly, The numerousness of the
Royal Family. There being four Princes,
it will be rare if Concord be maintained
among them all, especially since the
younger are like to be but meanly provi∣ded


for: so that frequent Occasions may
be taken from Quarrels and Disputes
(which possibly in future times may
arise among them) of doing something
in favour of Liberty.


These Reasons might cause one to
make a Judgment, that the 
Danish
 Go∣vernment
could not long subsist as it is.
But on the other hand, there are no less
weighty ones which would induce to
believe the contrary: For, first, the an∣cient
Love of Liberty seems to be quite
extinct in the North; and in its place to
have succeeded the conveniencies of a
dull Obedience. A miserable Life which
jogs on at the same heavy rate, has a
mixture of Melancholy Ease with it,
which is preferred before those sudden
Accidents, and brisk Traverses of For∣tune
which Commotions would occasi∣on;
especially by a People naturally of
an unactive Body and heavy Spirit, de∣pressed
by their Misfortunes, which are
now group up with them, and become
their familiar Companions.


In the second place, the Newness of
the Alteration of the Government seems
to have little or no influence at present
upon the People: for the King has taken
such care by reducing Ancient and Rich
Families to a low Estate, by raising new


ones, by making all the People poor
in Spirit, as well as Purse; that thirty
two years has had an effect conducing
to his purpose, as much as three hun∣dred
could have done: Insomuch that
I verily believe, the 
Danes
 do now really
love Servitude; and like the 
Cappadoci∣ans

of old, could not make use of Liber∣ty
if it were offered them; but would
throw it away if they had it, and resume
their Chains. Possibly they would wish
them less weighty, but Chains they
could not live without. If there be one
or two among so many thousands who
are of contrary Sentiments, they dare
not so much as mutter them to their
own Children, nor would be heard
with patience if. they did.


Thirdly, The Unity of Religion,
and the Opinions, together with the
Authority of the Priests, seems to have
cut away the root of Sedition, from
whence Alterations might proceed.


Fourthly, A standing Army compo∣sed
for the most part of Foreigners, who
have no value for the Natives, nor any
concern for their welfare. The Court
seems to have had this in its eye, when
it raised and maintained such an Army,
but in process of time the Army is be∣come
the People; that is to say, the


only thing worth the King's Care and
Affection; and the People nothing, so
that no Designs, tending to a Revoluti∣on,
are to be feared from them.


Fifthly, The 
Swedes
 treat their own
Subjects at such a rate as gives the 
Danes

but little Prospect of benefit by a
Change; and besides, there is such a fix∣ed
hatred between these two Nations,
by reason of the Injuries they have so
often given and received, that it is
thought impossible that the 
Danes,
 who
have been for the most part the Aggres∣sors,
as well as the sufferers, can ever for∣give
them. Many judicious Persons do
think however, that the 
Swede
 would
find means to overcome these Difficul∣ties,
did not the Discontents he has rais'd
at home, make War dangerous to him,
and the interest of almost all the other
Princes of 
Europe
 concur in the Preser∣vation
of the 
Danes,
 under the Domina∣tion
of their own King, by obstructing
any further Accession of Power and Ter∣ritories
to the 
Swedes.
 And this is cer∣tainly
such a Bar as cannot be leaped o∣ver,
so that little of Alteration seems to
be expected in 
Denmark
 from hence.


Lastly, Those Jealousies which use to
reign in the Families of Princes, are not
so common nor fatal in 
Germany
 as else∣where:


The King of 
Denmark
 is a 
Ger∣man

Prince himself, and 'tis likely will
find such Means of preferring his young∣er
Sons, as may content them, either by
breeding them up to the War (which is
the most ordinary way) or by assigning
them Appanages in convenient Places
not liable to dispute; besides, it is no rare
thing in 
Germany
 to see Princes satisfied
with very moderate Revenues. So that
the commonness of the thing takes away
the Discontent which might arise in
high-born Spirits, by reason of the low∣ness
of their Fortunes; and if any Wars
be in 
Europe,
 thither they all run to get
Bread, and Reputation. What else
should we do for a Stock of Generals in
such Havock as the present Wars make
of them? therefore nothing of Intestine
Commotions seems to be reasonably ex∣pected
from hence, that shall alter the
Form of Government; and from all
these Reasons it may be concluded,
That the present State is fix'd and dura∣ble,
and that the People with great
difficulty may perhaps change their
Masters, but never their Condition.


FINIS.
