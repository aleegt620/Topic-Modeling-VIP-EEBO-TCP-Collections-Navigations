 GUIL. CAMDENO.




SUFFOLK


1. 
O
N the South of 
Norfolk,
 hath 
Cambridge
 on the West, di∣vided from 
Essex
 Southward by the River 
Stow,
 the 
German
 Ocean beating on the East; two Rivers, 
little Ouse
 and 
VVaveny,
 running severall wayes from the same Springs between 
Norfolk
 and it.


2. A Region large, harborous, of a rich soil except Eastward, fruitfull corne-fields, and good pastures, and meadows for fatting cattel, abound∣ing in cheese, and not without woods, and many Parks for Deer adjoyning to Noble Houses.


3. The politick or civil Distribution of this 
County
 is into 3 Parts, The 
Geldable,
 St. 
Edmunds
 Liberty, and St. 
Etheldreds.


3. Near 
Cambridg-shire
 is seated 
Ixning,
 of lesser fame now then heretofore, by reason of the vicinity of 
New-market,
 whither the Trade is carried. 
New-market Heath
 is a large and spa∣cious Plain, barren and sandy, but green; here men admire at 
Devils dike,
 as if the Devil had made it, whereas no doubt it was but a Trench made of old by the Inhabitants of this Country, against the Incursions of their Enemies.


5. Onward is St. 
Edmunds Bury,
 a famous Town, so called from 
Edmund,
 a most Christian King, whose body, after he was cruelly slain by the 
Danes,
 was here interred. It flourished much, which K. 
Canute
 had repaired, and new built the Church, offered his Crown to the holy Martyr, brought in 
Monks
 with their 
Abbot,
 and bestowed many Lands upon them, and among the rest, the Town it self. Of the Town and Mo∣nastery, while it stood, hear 
Lelands
 Testimony, an Eye-witness, 
Sol non vidit urbem situ elegantiorem, sic molli delicata pendet in clivo, & ridulus ad Ori∣entem defluit; aut Coenobium illustrius,
 &c.


6. Near unto 
Bury
 appears 
Rushbrook,
 the Seat of the noble Family of the 
Iermins:
 and not far off 
Ikesworth,
 and more on the North 
Fernham;
 and near it 
Lidgate,
 a Village not to be passed by in silence, being ennobled by the birth of 
Iohn Lidgate
 Monk, whose wit the Muses themselves framed and adorned, his 
English Poems
 are of such grace and elegancy. Thus of the Western part,


8. On the South, 
Stour,
 nigh the Fountain,


overflows, and makes 
Stour-mere,
 and then collecting his waters within banks, visits 
Clare,
 a noted Town, which shews you the ruines of an old Castle. Thence by 
long Melford
 rejoycing to see the fair Hospitall built there by Sr. 
VVilliam Cordall,
 he passeth on to 
Sudbury
 (Southbury) once the chief Town of this Shire, and yet will not easily yield priority to any other: for it is populous, and a rich clothing Town, governed by a Major yearly chosen out of seven Aldermen.


8. 
Edwardston
 is not far off, a Town of small note now, and after a few miles 
Stour
 is en∣creased by the access of the little river 
Breton,
 which, in no long course, washes two Towns of ancient Names; near the springs, 
Bretenham,
 now a little one, and having no face of a City; and somewhat Eastward, 
Ofton, i. e.
 the Town of 
Offa
 K. of 
Mercians;
 beneath which is 
Hadley,
 a Town of good note for clothing.


9. 
Stour
 having received 
Breton
 runs down with it, not far from 
Bentley,
 and after a few miles near 
Arwenton,
 the Seat of the illustrious Family of the 
Parkers,
 drowns himself in the Ocean, meeting with the river 
Orwell
 or 
Gipping.


10. 
Orwell
 floweth even out of the belly of this Country, from two Fountains, the one near 
VVulpet,
 a Market Town 
(Luporum fossa)
 the other at 
Gipping
 a poor Village. At 
Norton,
 by it, K. 
Henry
 8. sought for Golden Mines in vain, and the pits speak as much.


11. Along the same River are seen 
Stow,
 and 
Needham,
 two Market Towns, and 
Himingston



almost on the bank of it, where 
Baldwin le Pet∣ture
 held Lands by a strange merry Tenure, 
per saltum, sufflum, & pettum.


12. Nearer the mouth of it appears 
Ipswich
 (of old 
Gippewich,
) of an humble site, the eye, as it were, of this County, a commodious Haven, a great Market-Town of trade, a great multitude of Inhabitants, beautified with Fourteen Churches, and many fair and magnificent Buildings. The Corporation consists of Twelve Burgesses (called 
Portmen
) of which the chief are two 
Bailieffs
 chosen yearly, and as many Iustices out of Twenty-four others. Thus for the Southern part.


13. The Eastern Coasts upon the Sea, run∣ning toward the North. The River 
Deben
 riseth near 
Mendlesham
 a market Town, thence visiteth and gives name to 
Debenham,
 from the deep waies round about it: afterwards it runns by 
Vfford
 and 
Rendolesham
 on the other side, and so to 
VVoodbridge,
 delighted with the neatness of the Town; and then after a few miles is enter∣tained by the Ocean, at 
Badsway
 Haven.


14. Now the Shore advanceth a little East∣ward, at the mouth of the river 
Orns,
 which hath its rise near 
Framlingham
 Castle, and pre∣sently spreads it self as it were into a Lake, on 
he West side thereof. This is a very fair Castle, and well fortified, with thirteen Turrets in a great thick wall, and within are many conve∣nient handsome Lodgings. 
Orns
 having washed a little Town 
Parham,
 and then 
Glemham,
 gives


name to 
Oreford,
 and near it falls into the Sea,


15. 
Oreford
 was a large and populous Town, but now complains of the ungratefull Ocean, for withdrawing himself, and envying her the commodity of her Haven by little and little. In the time of King 
Henry,
 there is a story, how the Fishermen here caught in their nets a wilde creature, representing in all parts the shape of a man, with a long beard, and much rough hair on his breast; who, at last secretly escaped to the Sea, and was seen no more.


16. Not much higher, in a safe and pleasant Site, lies 
Alburg,
 between the Vally 
Slangden,
 where the Sea beats on the East, and the River on the West; a Station for Mariners and Fisher∣men not incommodious, nor unfrequented: Hard by, when the Harvest was spoiled all 
England
 over by unseasonable weather, in the Year 1555. Peale grew up miraculously, with∣out any earth, amongst the stones, in the beginning of Autumn, and abated the price of Corne, as the Inhabitants relate; Some conjecture, that Pulse by shipwracks is cast upon the shore, and so uses to grow without any miracle. But the like spontaneous Harvest we have observed to be on the shore of Kent every year.


17. Ten miles further, along the Sea-coast you come to 
Dunwich,
 where 
An.
 630. 
Felix
 the 
Burgundian
 fixt his Episcopall See, and his Successors a long time governed all the East of 
England;
 but now the violence of the waves


having carryed away the greatest part of it, the Bishops having many ages since removed their Chair thence; It sits in sadness, and al∣most in solitude. A little higher the River 
Blith
 emptieth it felf into the Sea, on whose bank is seated a small Town, 
Blithborow,
 which hath a Market by favour of 
Iohn
 Lord 
Clavering.


18. Here runns farther into the East, the Promontory 
Easton-ness,
 esteemed the most Ea∣stern point of all 
Britain;
 and is called by 
Ptolomy, Extensio.
 On the South of it lies 
Southwold
 in a plain open to the Sea; a Town frequented for the Havens sake, which the river 
Blith
 entring the sea, makes there; and when the Tide comes, so sur∣rounded with the waters, that it seemeth an Iland, and you would wonder it is not overflown. More inward you have 
VVingfield
 and 
Dunnington:
 and not far off 
Huntingfeild;
 and nearer it 
Heven∣ingham,
 the seat of a Noble Family that have their name thence: at a little distance is 
Hales∣worth,
 now the Seat of the 
Alingtons.


19. On the North; this Province, as we said, is divided from 
Norfolk
 by two small Rivers, 
Ouse
 and 
VVaveney;
 both which issuing out of a plashy place at 
Lophamford,
 their springs being very little distant, drive their shallow streams divers wayes. Upon 
Ouse,
 which runneth West, nothing offers it self on this side worthy of me∣mory: upon 
VVaveney,
 that runneth East, you shall see 
Hoxon
 first, enobled by the Martyrdome of 
K. Edmund.
 Near it, at 
Broom,
 hath long dwelt the noble Family of 
Cornwallis.
 Lower is 
Eay, i.e.


Isle,
 so called, because it is watered round about.


20. Thence 
Waveney
 runns down by 
Flixton
 (for 
Felixton,
 from the first Bp. 
Felix,
 as many other places were also named from him) and almost encompasseth 
Bungey.
 A little below neer the Bank, you shall see 
Mettingham.
 And now 
Waveney
 approaching to the Sea, and attempting in vain to go two wayes thither, one by the River 
Garienis,
 another by the Lake 
Luthing,
 makes a fair 
Peninsula,
 named by some 
Lovingland,
 by others, more truly, 
Luthingland,
 from that long and diffused Lake, which beginning at the shore of the Ocean reacheth to the river 
Garienis.


21. At the entrance of which 
Peninsula
 a little Town 
Lestroffe
 lies upon the Sea, at the end of it 
Gorlston.
 Inward upon 
Waveny
 is seated 
Somerly,
 and higher, where 
Garienis
 and 
Waveny
 mingle themselves 
Cnobersburg,
 which we now call 
Burgh-Castle,
 being onely ruined walls, enriched with 
Roman
 Coynes often found there.

GLOCESTER--SHIRE.


T
He primary Seat of the Old 
Dobuni,
 hath 
Monmouth
 and 
Hereford-shire
 on the West, 
Worcester-shire
 on the North, on the East, 
Oxford
 and 
Warwick-shire; Wilt-shire
 and 
Somerset-shire
 on the South: a Country pleasant and fertile, stretched forth from the Summer-rising of the Sun to winter∣setting.


2. The more Eastern part raising it self in Hills is known by the name of 
Cotswold;
 the midst is sunk and fallen into a most fruitfull Plain, and watered by the most noble River 
Severn,
 that gives a vital force and verdure unto the Felds: the more Western part beyond 
Severn
 is all shaded with Woods.


3. The Region, saith 
Malmesbury,
 is called from the principall Town, 
The Vale of Glocester;
 all the Land rich in Corn, and abounding in fruit: You may behold the High-wayes ap∣parrelled as it were were with Apple-trees and Pear-trees, not by the industry of Plantation, but by the very nature of the Soil. A Region, more than any other Province in 
England,
 plentifull in Vines, of a more delightfull taste, the wines being very gratefull to the palate,


and not much inferiour to your 
French
 wines in sweetness, &c. No marvel so many places in these parts retain the name of 
Vineyards,
 yielding wine heretofore; and it is rather to be imputed to the ill-husbandry of the Inhabitants, than the decay of Nature, that there is none pressed at this day.


4. The more Western part, on the other side 
Severn
 (possessed of old by the 
Silures
) even to the 
Wye
 (a River running betwixt 
Wales
 and 
England
) is full of deep woods, the 
Forrest of Dean,
 so called, either from a little Town of that name, or, as I conjecture, from 
Arden,
 signifying both among the 
Galls
 and 
Brittains, a wood:
 the Forrest is now, since the Iron∣works there, grown thinner than heretofore.


5. Here is 
Avone,
 of most ancient memory, mentioned by 
Antoninus,
 now called 
Aventon,
 a little Village, probably so called from 
Avon,
 which to the 
Britains
 signifies a River.


6. The river 
Severn
 (Brit. 
Huffron
) having gone a long journey in a narrower channel, where it first enters this Shire, receives the river 
Avon,
 and another little stream from the East, between which is seated 
Tewkesbury,
 so called from 
Theoc
 the Hermite here, a large and fair Town, having three Bridges, noted for clothing, and whose Mustard for biting is become Proverbial, being made up in balls.


7. Lower, on the bank of 
Severn,
 lies 
Deorhist,
 and suffers much damage by the


overflowing of the river, when it swells. Here in the midst of 
Severn is At
ey,
 now the 
Eight, i. e.
 Island, famous for the single Combate of 
Edmund
 the 
English
 King and 
Canute
 the 
Dane.


8. 
Severn
 goes on in a winding course, and dividing it self, to make an Island of the green and fertile meadowes, washes the City 
Glocester,
 which 
Antonine
 calls 
Glevum,
 the Britains 
Caer Glowi,
 i. e. 
The Fair City.
 It was built by the 
Romans,
 to awe the 
Silures,
 and a Colony was brought thither, named 
Colonia Glevum.
 The City is built along upon the river, and the other side is in part fortified by a very strong wall. The Streets are indeed very neat; and they were adorned with many Churches: The principall Church, or 
Colledge,
 was built by 
Aldred
 Archbishop of 
York,
 and had a Dean, with 6 Prebendaries: above the Quire, there is a semicircular vault, a 
Whispering-place,
 built with that artifice, that a very soft voice is conveyed between the walls, from one end to the other, to the admiration of the hearers.


9. 
Severn
 bidding farewell to 
Glocester,
 u∣niteth her divided forces, and fighteth often with a violent Tide, and bends her course to the Ocean, on the way visiting 
Barkley,
 a Town of good note, having a Major to govern it, and a Castle, honoured by the ancient Nobility of her Lords, the Barons of 
Barkley.


10. Near unto this, a little rivet 
Aven
 runs into the 
Severn
 Sea, at whose springs, scarce


eight miles off the shore, near the Village 
Al∣derley
 are bred stones in the shape of Cockles and Oysters, which, whether they were living creatures once, or are onely the sports of wanton nature, let the 
Physiologers
 enquire.


11. Now let us climb the Hills, and view 
Cotswold,
 so called from the hills (for 
wold
 signifies a Hill, and the 
Cotes
 or Folds of sheep, famous for their soft and fine wooll through all Nations. Under these hills are sheltred se∣veral places of especial mark.


12. 
Campden,
 or 
Camden,
 a Market Town of of note: 
Hales,
 once a most flourishing Monastry, famous for that 
Alexander of Hales,
 the 
Coryphoeus
 and chief of Schoolmen: 
Sudeley,
 a most elegant Castle (the stately House of the Illustrious Lord 
George,
 late Lord 
Chandos
 Baron of 
Sudeley:) VVinchcomb,
 an ancient populous Town (but very poor now, were it not for the Plantation of Tobacco) where 
Kenulph
 the 
Mercian
 King erected a fair Monastry, famed for the Reliques of 
Kenelm,
 a Childe traiterously made away by his Sister, and inserted into the Catalogue of Ma tyrs.


1r3. Near the Eastern bounds of this County is to be seen that celebrious 
Roman
 way, called the 
Fosse,
 which comes from 
Warwick-Shire,
 by 
Lemington,
 a Station of the 
Romans,
 (as the 
Roman
 Coyns there found seem to testifie) and then by 
Stow on the wold,
 exposed to the cold windes, and 
Northleach
 (washed by a rivulet of the same appellation) to 
Cirencester
 or 
Ciciter.


14. 
Ciciter,
 a Town of very great Antiquity, 
Corinum
 in 
Ptolomy,
 exactly 15 Miles from the 
Gloc,
 taking the name from the river 
Corinus,
 or 
Churne
 (which runns on the South of it, and affords opportunity of Mills) was a place of great dignity, as the 
Roman
 coyns, Marbles, and other Monuments often found there, do prove. The Fourth part scarce is now inha∣bited, the rest turned into Fields, and ruines of an old Religious House, built as they say by the 
Saxons.
 The Inhabitants are enriched by clothing, and thankfully remember the bounty of K. 
Richard
 the first, who gave them power over 7 adjacent Hundreds, to hear Causes, and receive Mulcts and other Emoluments thereby.


15. Among the Dukes of 
Glocester
 most me∣morable is 
Humphry
 brother to the renowned King 
Henry
 the fift; a man of high desert toward the Commonwealth of Learning:




FINIS.
