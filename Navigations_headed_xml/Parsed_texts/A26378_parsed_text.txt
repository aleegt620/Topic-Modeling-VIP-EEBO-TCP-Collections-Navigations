TO THE
Most Worthy and truly Honored
Joseph Williamson Esq.


SIR,


THE Liberty of De∣dications,
being the un∣doubted
Priviledge of
every Scribler, may save me
harmless in prefixing your
Name to the ensuing 
Re∣marks.

In which I do not so
much design your Patronage,
because I cannot fansie that
these Papers will be so much
taken notice of as to be que∣stion'd


for their Faults. But
my whole Design on this oc∣casion
is to tell the 
World,
 how
much I love your Person, and
honour your Worth.


I will not be so vain as to en∣deavour
to represent you to
the 
World,
 or to your 
Self,
 for
you are sufficiently known to

both;
 and your excellent Parts
& Integrity have not 
attracted

you more honor at 
home,
 then
they have 
acquired
 you 
a∣broad.

For I know your 
Re∣putation

is as happy in 
Fo∣reign
Countries
 for the even

Menage
 of Affairs, as in
your 
own.



But to attempt any thing
of your 
Panegyrick,
 were to
doe, what is done by all who
know you: & therefore I may
justly divert my 
Pen
 to ex∣press
my 
Resentments,
 that I
can make no Present agree∣able
to 
your Merit
 or my 
Af∣fection.

For which, I have no
other Apology, but either my
Unhappiness, or that this is
not the Age, when 
Temples,
Altars,
 and 
Statues,
 are e∣rected
to Worth and Virtue.
Nevertheless, I cannot be so
fashionably modest, as altoge∣ther
to 
Vilifie
 my Offering,
or so far wrong you, as to ima∣gine


it will be despised as utter∣ly

Ʋnprofitable;
 for it must
be a Present extreamly 
mean,

which so great an 
Ingenuity
 as
yours, will despise; and a Sub∣ject
strangely 
dry,
 from
whence so great a Discern∣ment
can gather Nothing.


I know, that little worthy a
Polite Judgement can be ga∣ther'd
from a Discourse of
People famous only for being
Barbarous; yet if Publick
Affairs can spare you minutes
enough to read over these

Remarks,
 you may perhaps
in them meet with so much

Order, Civility,
 and (accord∣ing


to their way) 
Religion,
 as
may somewhat refine that

Name.
 However, if what
I tender may be by you recei∣ved,
as it is sincerely intended,
for an Unfeigned Testimony
of my Respect and Affection,
I have accomplish'd my De∣sign,
which is without all Ar∣tifice,
to declare my self,


Your Humble, Faithful, and
Devoted Servant,
LANCELOT ADDISON.










THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.


IT being the manner of those who
Write, to acquaint the Reader
with the Design of the Book;
if I had any in Publishing this be∣sides
your Divertisement, it was
chiefly to make the 
Justice
 and

Religiousness
 of a People estee∣med

Barbarous, Rude,
 and 
Sa∣vage,

to reflect upon their Enor∣mities,
who would be reckon'd
for the only 
Illuminati
 of both.
And to shew that this 
Unlick'd,


Uncultivated People
 agree with
the 
wisest Nati
s,
 in making the
care of 
Religion
 and 
Justice
 to
suppress 
Vice
 and encourage 
Virtue,

as the only method to make a State
happy.


It was one of the 
Pedantick
 Va∣nities
of the 
Grecians
 to repute all

Barbarous
 but themselves; and al∣beit
there are some who have the
same Opinion of every thing that is
diverse from the Manners and Cu∣stoms
of their own Country, yet those
who acknowledge 
Humanity
 in all
its Habits, may in perusing the Re∣marks
made upon these 
Barbarians,

meet with something that may 
civi∣lize

the 
Title,
 and induce them to
think, that what is commonly call'd



Barbarous,
 is but a different Mode
of 
Civility.


As for the Truth of what is writ∣ten,
I have us'd an Industry as
probable to ensure me thereof, as the
nature of the Subject would give me
leave. Having first travel'd the
Country, and remark'd as much as
such an occasion would afford, and
then retain'd a 
Conversation
 with
such Persons, both 
Moors
 and 
Jews,

as I found best able to encrease and
amend my first Remarks. So that
they are not barely the Occasionals of
a 
Journey,
 nor scrap'd up from 
Ca∣sual
Discourses,
 but the result of
some Years 
Inspection
 into the Peo∣ple
of whom I write; and that I
might not dis-ingeniously impose up∣on


your Belief, I have not content∣ed
my self with a single Test, but
have rejected several Passages which
have not had a sufficient 
confirma∣tion.

It being not my intent to be
known for Writing things strange
and 
Romantick,
 but to be very

civil
 to the World, in putting no∣thing
upon them but what is Firm
and Solid.


As for the Dress wherein they ap∣pear
(though perhaps suitable enough
for the matter) I have been therein
so negligent as not greatly to regard
it, except in the Narrative to pre∣serve

coherence.
 For I conceived,
I was not to present you with the Cu∣stoms
of a Nation as 
I made them,

but as they were in 
themselves,



which could scarcely be done, but by
exposing them (thus) 
naked.


The Narrative of the late Re∣volutions,

&c.
 is that for which to
some I may seem the less accountable,
because I insinuate a want of Pub∣lick
Records among the Moors, out
of which it was to have been col∣lected.
But there was no such great
need of those Assistances in Penning
the Annals of our Age; and the
Narrative ascends no higher then
the Period of the 
Xeriffian
 Family,
and the Division of 
Kiram
's Ʋsur∣pation
of the Crown of 
Morocco,

which are very fresh in the minds of
the 
Moors.
 And yet for the clearer
Certainty herein, I have had the
assistance of some Ancient observing



Moors,
 who were Actors in the
late Revolves. But my best help
I had, was from an Aged, Inquisi∣tive,
noting Person, an 
Hebrew
Sabio,
 one 
Joseph Messias,
 who
for many Years had been Secretary
of 
Tituan,
 and with great dili∣gence
had observed 
Memoirs
 of
what a long time had happened in
that part of 
Barbary.
 In what
concerns the War between 
Gaylan

and 
Taffilet,
 I confess I am not ve∣ry
particular, because much thereof
related to 
Tanger;
 but what is
here wanting, may be supplyed in
the modern Story of that Ancient
City.


How far I have been from Tran∣scribing

Leo Afer,
 which some may


suspect, will easily appear by compa∣ring
what is contain'd in the Re∣marks
of 
West Barbary,
 with his
Description of 
Africa.


That I have not spoken more large∣ly
of their Colleges, needs no other
excuse, than that they now use none;
and the like may be answer'd for
my silence of their Libraries. And
how famous soever 
Mauritania Tin∣gitana

hath been in former Ages
for a Race of 
Literati,
 yet now there
is little hope to see a Restauration of
their Studies, if it be considered
what small regard the present 
Moors

bear to Learning: Which I under∣stood
from 
Cidi Abdella, Gaylan's

Secretary, a 
Spanish
 Renegado of a
bold Capacity; to whom, when I










was praising the Ancient Learning
of 
Fez, &c.
 he told me, That now
the 
Moors
 were not very fond of
Bookish Inclinations, being gene∣rally
addicted either to Military or
Mechanick Employments: and when
I read to him out of 
Don Diego
Savedra Taxardo
 (in the 66th of
his 
Empressas Politicas)
 how that
a Learned Age might have as little
Valour as Devotion: That all know∣ledge
was superfluous which taught
the People more than to 
Obey, en∣dure
Travel,
 and 
Conquer:
 That
great Discursists were apt to intrigue
Affairs, dispute the Princes Resolu∣tions,
and stir up the People: That
it was the best Obedience, which was
rather Credulous then Inquisitive:


That the 
Ottoman
 Empire, so much
enrich'd with the Spoils, and ele∣vated
with the Trophies of many
Nations, reckon it among their

Happinesses,
 not to have their Con∣sultations
lime-twigg'd with Quirks
and Sophisms of Philosophical Per∣sons,
and make Illiterature one of
their chief Engines of Empire:
That the City may be taken, while
the Mathematician is delinea
g
the Fortification: That Nations,
Provinces, Colonies, have grown
great by Industrious, and not Poring
Arts, 
&c.
 While I was thus reading
to the attentive discerning Renega∣do,
he broke out into a sort of Ex∣ultation,
and call'd 
Muley Mahu∣med

to witness, that he thought



Savedra
 (the Author I read) was
a 
Moor,
 or otherwise he could never
have so punctually described the

Humour,
 and 
Sentiments of the

Moors 
concerning Learning:
 ad∣ding
withal, that if they who in their
present Illiterature were so prone to
Sedition, that they would be much
more so, if they were heated with
Bookish Speculations, and had their
Black humour chaf'd and quicken'd
with Subtilizing Studies.


The next thing which may seem
herein omitted, is, that which would
have best pleased the 
Virtuosi,
 an
account of their Libraries, for which
I was once sollicited by a Letter
from a Stranger, in the Year 1664.
who design'd an Ʋniversal Cata∣logue


of Ancient and Modern Wri∣ters,
and their Books: And though
he possess'd me with great hopes of
finding great store of Books in 
Bar∣bary

for his purpose; yet upon En∣quiry,
I met with nothing but Dis∣appointment,
and that the 
Moors

are so far from having excellent Li∣braries,
that they wonder to see any
Book of Age or Volume in their
own Language. This I understood
from 
Cidi Hamet Cogez
 (former∣ly

Alcayd
 of 
Alcazàr)
 who when
in 
Tanger
 coming to see the Pub∣lick
Library that we had Founded
there, where I shewed him a MS.
in his own Character concerning
their Religion, he kiss'd, hugg'd,
laid it to his Brow, upon the Crown


of his Head, lifted it up to Hea∣ven,
and in every Circumstance ap∣pear'd
therewith so much transport∣ed,
that I could scarce rescue it out
of his Embraces.


The same MS. I shewed to a 
Ta∣lib

(who was one of 
Tafilets
 Em∣hérkin,
or Messengers of State, sent
to Compliment His Excellency the
Lord Ambassador, The Illustrious
Lord 
H. Howard
 at 
Tanger)
 who
esteem'd it so great a Rarity, that
he sollicited the Ambassador to beg or
buy it for him at any Rate. This
Manuscript is now in the Possession of
the Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury
 His
Grace. It is the first part of the

Mustadarif
 (or, as the 
Talib
 Ex∣pounded
it) The 
Clean Book.
 It


was compos'd by 
Alfachì Mahumed
Ebn Ahmed Alchab,
 and Copyed
into that fair Letter, wherein it is
now extant, by 
Ali Ebn Abd'∣aliráhman
ebn Mahumed,
 a Native
of 
Suz,
 who finished it in the second
Moneth 
Giamadi, Anno Hegirae,

1005.


But these Stories have betray'd
me to an unintended length, for
which I hope to make some amends
in what follows; in which I have
endeavour'd, like a merciful Exe∣cutioner,
not to protract your Pain.
















A BRIEF NARRATION
Of the late Revolutions in the
KINGDOMES
of Fez and Morocco.


THIS 
Narrative
 of the 
Revo∣lutions

of 
Barbary,
 shall not be
derived beyond the 
Annals
 of
our own 
Memory.
 For whose
clearer introduction, the contexture of
affaires invites us to step back to the
notorious 
change,
 which hapned about
the year 1508. Near which time the 
Ma∣rine
Familie
 approaching to its design'd
period and determination, it fortun'd
that a certain 
Alfachi,
 or 
Morish Priest,

in the Province of 
Dara,
 began to grow
into great reputation with the people,
by reason of his 
high pretentions
 to 
piety

and 
fervent zeal
 for their 
Law,
 illustra∣ted
by a stubborn rigidity of conversa∣tion


and 
outward sanctity
 of life. 
His
 first
name was 
Mahumet Ben Amet;
 but pre∣tending
to be descended from their 
Pro∣phet,

he caused himself to be called

Zeriffe:
 A 
Title
 which the Kindred of
that 
Impostor
 have appropriated to them∣selves,
and made the 
character
 of that
whole 
Family.
 The credit of his preten∣ded

Pedegree,
 was another 
Engine
 where∣with
he insinuated himself into the peo∣ples
likeing, which together with his
seeming severity, made him of no vulgar
esteem with a generation, who from time
to time have been fooled with such 
Moun∣tebanks
in Religion.


The great applause and approbation
his person met with from the 
Moores,

kindled in him no less an Ambition then
of making himself 
Lord
 of 
Mauritania
Tingitana;
 which must needs have proved
a very 
Hypocondriacal designe,
 had it not
been assisted with a favourable conjun∣cture
of affaires. For the 
Mauritanian
Princes
 had a long time weakned them∣selves
with 
civil discords;
 and the 
Por∣tugals

taking that advantageous occasion,
had farr advanced their 
Armes,
 and arri∣ved
at a considerable puissance in 
Barba∣ry,



and were still under a daylie success
of new atchievements: Besides, the 
Moors

desirous of 
Novelties,
 and sensible of op∣pressions,
both from their own and for∣reign

powers,
 were sufficiently inclina∣ble
to adhere to any, who appeared with
probability to deliver them from their
present 
Yoke.


This now 
Zeriffe,
 who wanted neither

Witt
 nor 
Ambition
 to conduct or enter∣prise
an innovation, found by the 
Starrs,

in whose 
Science
 his 
Legend
 makes him
very skilful, that the time was not yet
suitable for so great an 
undertaking.
 Re∣ligion
was his pretence, and nothing
could have been so fit beside to advance
him in the estimation of 
the many.


To facilitate his designs, he sent his
three Sons, 
Abdel, Abnet,
 and 
Mahumet
 in

Pilgrimage
 to 
Mecha
 and 
Medina,
 to visit
and worship the Sepulchre of their 
Great
Prophet.
 Much was the reverence and re∣putation
of 
Holiness,
 which they there∣by

uired among the superstitious

people,
 who could hardly be kept from
kissing their garments, and adoreing them
as 
Saints.
 His admired sons failed not in
their 
parts,
 but acted as much Devotion,


as high contemplative looks, deep sighes,
tragical gestures, and other passionate

Interjections
 of 
Holiness
 could express;

Alà, Alà
 was their doleful note, their su∣stenance
the peoples 
Almes.
 Their Fa∣ther
received them with content and joy,
and perceiving the favour and opinion of
the people toward him, to continue the
same as at the first, he resolved to make
use thereof, and thereupon sent 
Abnet

and 
Mahumet
 to the 
Court
 of 
Fez,
 where
they were kindly received by the too 
cre∣dulous
King,
 who made the elder, 
President

of the famous 
Colledge Amadorac,
 and the
younger, 
Tutor
 of his own Sons. 
Ad∣vanced

thus in favour at 
Court,
 and 
Grace

with the people, by the Councel of their
Father, they desired leave of the 
King
 to
display a 
Banner
 against the 
Christians;

induceing him to believe, that they would
easily draw the 
Portugal Moors
 to their
party; and by that means secure the

Provinces of Morocco. Muley Nazer
 the
Kings brother, resisted the p
tion,
warning the 
King
 not to arme this name
of 
Sanctity,
 which being once 
Victo∣rious,

might grow 
insolent,
 and forget∣ful
of 
Duty
 in minding a Kingdome.


He told him likewise that War makes men
awless, and that through 
popularity,
 ma∣ny
became ambitious and studious of 
In∣novation.

But the King intoxicated with
the Opinion of these 
Pilgrims Sanctity,

rejected his Brothers necessary cautions,
and gave them a 
Banner
 and 
Drum,
 with

Letters
 of 
Credence
 to the 
Princes
 and

Cities
 of 
Barbary,
 with twenty horse∣men
to attend them. Many Wonderful
successes awaited upon their 
actions,
 and
all things thrived so well under their
conduct, that at last the King of 
Fez,
 who
all along applauded his own Victories in
theirs, began to distast them. And seeing
they had poysoned the King of 
Morocco,

and made 
Amet Zeriff
 to be proclaimed
King in his stead, he mistrusted his own
safety, and began but too late to repent
his approveing of an 
armed hypocrisie.
Puft up
 with their 
successes
 they forgot
their 
obedience,
 and these 
Saints
 deny
the King the fifth part of their spoyles,
and only sent him six Horses and six Ca∣mels,
and those lean and ill shapen. The

King
 demands his dues, but they answer∣ed,
That seeing they were lawful succes∣sors
to 
Mahumet,
 they ought to pay no


man 
Tribute,
 and that they had more right
in 
Affrica
 then himself; but if he would
respect them as his 
Friends
 and 
Allies,

they were not froward to embrace him
under that quality; but if he expected
any more at their hands, they doubted
not, but as they had had power to 
offend

the 
Christians,
 they should not be desti∣tute
in defending of themselves; By
which it appeared, that they took up

Armes,
 not out of 
Love
 to their 
Country

and zeale for their Religion, but out of
a desire of Rule.


The sword by both sides was chosen
to umpire the contest, which awarded
for the 
Zeriffs.
 For upon the encounter
of both the Armies, the 
Fessan
 Forces af∣ter
a long and doubtful Battle were de∣feated;
and the 
Zeriffs
 so well impro∣ved
the victory, that in few moons they
became the uncontrouled 
Lords
 of the
Kingdoms of 
Fez
 and 
Morocco,
 in whose

Government
 their 
Family
 continued a
considerable summe of years. But not
with out destructive 
Hostilities
 among
themselves; the Descendents pulling
down each other by the like treacheries,
that advanced their Ancestors: 
The grea∣ter


thief stil leading the less to the Gallows.

Their Rebellions appeared under the
specious pretences of mending some
faults in Government, and one 
Cozin
 de∣posed
another, under the pleasing disguise
of setting up a gentler and more orderly

Dominion;
 forgetting that it is safer to
permit some inconveniences in the outer
buildings, then to pull the whole structure
down; There being corruptions which
may safelier be 
continued
 then 
removed.


But notwithstanding these 
Civil Wars,

the power still remained in the same 
Fa∣milie,

and the dissention of the branches
proceeded not so farr as to cut down the
tree. And yet about the year 1607. the

Zeriffian House
 seem'd neer an extirpa∣tion
by reason of 
Boféres
 and 
Sidans
 op∣posing

Muley Sheck
 their elder Brother
in his succession. But 
Muley Sheck
 and

Boféres
 dying in the warrs, 
Morocco
 was
left to 
Abdalla
 son of 
Muley Sheck,
 who
scarce warm'd the throne, till he was vio∣lently
pull'd thence by his Uncle 
Sidan,

and by an unintended kindness freed
from the troubles of a 
Crown.


This 
Muley Sidan
 once more joyned

Fez
 with 
Morocco,
 and in himself made


the 
Zeriffian Family
 to reigne over both.
But he was much infested both by Land
and Sea. For 
Abdela
 a Religious 
Hermit,

and 
Hean,
 one of like hypocrisie and zeal,
two opposite 
factions
 distressed him at
Land, and the 
Pyrates
 of 
Salla
 and 
Al∣gier

by Sea. But his great valour main∣tain'd
him against both. For by his own
Arms he pacifyed the tumults at Land,
and by the assistance of the English
Shipping, he destroyed the Pyrats of 
Sal∣la,

which so much disquieted the 
Ocean.

And this being done he sent to have the
like aid against those of 
Algier
 the Pest
of the 
Mediterranean.
 The tenor of his

Heroick letter
 sent to King 
CHARLES

of 
Great Britain
 on this occasion, I have
here annexed, with no other designe then
to manifest the great esteem, which that

Mahumedan Prince
 worthily retained of

CHARLES
 the first, our Victorious
Martyr.






The Letter of the
KING of MOROCCO
To the
KING of ENGLAND.


WHen these our Letters
shall be so happy as to
come to your Majesties sight, I wish
the Spirit of the Righteous God may
so direct your mind, that you may
joyfully embrace the Message I send;
presenting to you the means of exalt∣ing
the Majesty of God, and your own
reward amongst men. The Regal
power allotted to us makes us com∣mon
servants to our Creator; then of
those people whom we govern: so that
observing the duties we owe to God,


we deliver blessings to the world; in
providing for the publicke good of
our States, we magnifie the honour
of God; like the Celestial Bodies,
which though they have much vene∣ration,
yet serve only to the benefit
of the world. It is the Excellencie of
our Office, to be Instruments where∣by
happiness is delivered to the Na∣tions.
Pardon me Sir, this is not to
instruct, for I know I speake to one
of a more cleer and quick sight then
my self; but I speak this, because
God hath pleased to grant me a hap∣py
victory over some part of those Re∣bellious
Pyrates, that have so long
molested the peaceful trade of Europe;
and hath presented further occasion
to root out the Generation of those,


who have been so pernitious to the
good of our Nations: I mean, since
it hath pleased God to be so auspi∣cious
to our beginnings in the con∣quest
of Salla, that we might joyne
and proceed in hope of like success in
the War against 
Tunis, Algier,
 and
other places (Dens and Receptacles
for the inhumane villanies of those
who abhor Rule and Government.)
Herein whilest we interrupt the cor∣ruption
of malignant Spirits of the
world, we shal glorifie the great God,
and performe a duty that will shine
as glorious as the Sun and Moon,
which all the Earth may see and re∣verence:
a work that shall ascend
as sweet as the perfume of the preci∣ous
Odours, in the Nostrils of the


Lord. A work grateful and happy
unto men: a worke whose memory
shall be reverenced so long as there
be any that delight to heare the
Actions of Heroick and Magnani∣mous
Spirits; that shall last as long
as there be any remaining amongst
men, that love and honour the Piety
and Vertue of Noble minds. This
action I here willingly present to You,
whose Piety and Virtues equall the
Greatness of your Power: that We
who are Servants of the Great and
Mighty God, may Hand in Hand
Triumph in the Glory which this
Action presents unto us. Now because
the Islands which you Govern, have
been ever famous for the Ʋncon∣quered
strength of their Shipping, I


have sent this my trusty Servant and
Ambassador to Know, whether in your
Princely Wisdome You shall think fit
to assist me with such Forces by Sea,
as shall be answerable to those I pro∣vide
by Land: which if You please
to grant, I doubt not but the Lord
of Hosts will protect and assist those
that fight in so glorious a Cause. Nor
ought You to think this strange, that
I, who much reverence the Peace and
accord of Nations, should exhort to a
Warr. Your great Prophet Christ
Jesus was the Lyon of the Tribe of
Judah, as well as the Lord and Gi∣ver
of Peace: which may signifie un∣to
You, that he which is a lover and
maintainer of Peace, must alwaies
appear with the terror of his sword,


and wading through Seas of Blood,
must arrive at tranquillity. This
made JAMES your Father of
glorious memory, so happily renowned
amongst all Nations. It was the
Noble fame of your Princely Vertues,
which resounds to the utmost corners
of the Earth, that perswadeth me to
invite You to partake of that bles∣sing
wherein I boast my selfe most
happy. I wish God may heap the
riches of his Blessings on You, in∣crease
your happiness with your days,
and hereafter perpetuate the great∣ness
of your Name in all Ages.





The Traders into the 
Levant
 have rea∣son
to bewail, that the condition of his
Majesties affaires would not give him
leave to entertain this motion: which in
all probability can never be revived with
such promising circumstances, as it might
then have been enterprized; for those
Pyrats were then inconsiderable to what
they are now; for by the computation
of their encrease in Shipping and Skill in
Navigation, if not timely subdued, they in
short time may bid defiance to the Chri∣stian
in the Mid-land Seas. And albeit the
proposal was not embraced, yet it loud∣ly
spoke 
Sidan
 a Prince of Generous De∣signs,
and Noble Ambitions; and one
who aimed at the Advance and Security
of Trade, the Common interest of the
World.


Muley Sidan
 having reduced the af∣fairs
of State to a great degree of Quiet,
he finish'd both Life and Reign at once,
contrary to the example of the most of
his Predecessors, whereof few either
Reigned to the natural length of their
Life, or were suffered to live beyond the
violent shortness of their Reigne. Upon


his Death, 
Muley Abdelmeleck
 his eldest
Son, enter'd upon the fruition of his Fa∣thers
Atchievements. He was a person of
much flegm and indifferency, naturally
fitted for a tame and peaceable Empire,
into which he was happily inaugurated,
but not long continued, for in the se∣cond
year of his reigne he was unnatu∣rally
assasined by his second Brother

Luellud,
 whose ambition broke all
bonds of Nature and Politie to ascend a
Throne. But the infamous fratricide was
presently thrown from his usurped great∣ness:
for having by a powerful example
taught the nearest method to weare a
Crown, he was clandestinely Murder'd
by his youngest Brother 
Muley Hamet
Sheck,
 before he had accomplish'd the
period of twenty Months in his King∣dome.
And it is remarkable that 
Muley
Shek
 pretended to no vengeance of his
eldest Brothers death in that of his se∣cond;
but that he acted it only cut of an
itch to obtain the Government, seconded
with a suspition of his own safety; which
could not be great, while his Brother
might justly fear him as a Rival for the
Kingdome.




Muley Sheck
 being the last of the Bro∣thers,
and thereby without any to com∣petition
him, he studied to make both
his Government and Person gratious to
the people. In which artifice he was so
prosperous, that no Sultan in 
Barbary

had equal'd him in a confluence of hap∣piness.
The Skie of his Reigne was for
nineteen years serene: and there were
no prognosticks of alteration in his con∣dition,
till 
Laella,
 one of his Wives,
began to be exorbitant in her appetites,
and to meditate disloyalty to her Hus∣band's
Bed. She is reported to have been
a woman of a refined subtilty, and learn∣ed
in the most artful methods of steale∣ing
her pleasures. But at length she fell
excessively enamour'd of her own kins∣man,
one 
Cidi Kirum,
 whom the King
had adopted into his 
Grace
 and 
Conver∣sation.

This 
Kirum
 was of a popular in∣clination,
and skilful in feeding the hu∣mours
of the people. He had been at

Mecha
 in Devotion, and of course recei∣ved
for that 
visitation
 the title of 
Hadge,

granted to all that have performed the

Hage,
 or Pilgrimage to their Prophets
Tomb. By this, and a great shew of ex∣terior


Religion, he had with men of all
capacities purchased a significant repu∣tation.
And albeit he was a wel-wisher
to an Innovation, the common designe
of their pretended Piety, yet the present
face of affaires look'd very disagreeable
upon such an enterprise. For the King
so rul'd, that all had cause to love, and
none to feare him, and the courteousness
of his personal behaviour, had secured
him a large share in the worst of his Sub∣jects
bosoms; His custom being to punish
and spare none, who were convict offen∣dors
against their Law, the known Rule
both of their Religion and Politie. And
for the greater discouragement of
all commotions, the 
Zeriffian
 name
was grown sacred with the Moors,
through its long continuance: and they
concluded its prosperity a Divine ap∣probation
of its Right.


Kirum
 no doubt was still as coveteous
to enjoy the Crown, as 
Laella
 his Bed;
whose amours at last grew to that height
of impatience, that nothing could quiet
them, but the embraces of her Paramour
in a Regal State; which she plotted
with a feminine invention. The death of


the King her Husband was the only se∣cure

Recipe
 for her distemper, but alto∣gether
of an unsafe accomplishment, if
enterprised by open violence. Where∣fore
she is reported to have essayed his
Death by Sorcery's; in which wickedness
(Story tels us) that the Mahumetan Wo∣men
have alwaies been dexterous. But
not precisely to determine, by what way

Muley Hamet Sheck
 came to his Grave,
it is certain that his end was suddain
and unexpected, and that he shut up his
life before he had seen the twentieth
yeare of his Reign. His decease was
much lamented, and the more because it
came unsuspected. The Government
lineally descended upon his Son 
Muley
Labèsh,
 a child of three years old, whom
his dying Father bequeath'd to the pro∣tection
of 
Kirum El Hadge,
 and other
Grandees of the Kingdome, appointing
them to administer the affaires of State
in 
Labèsh
's name, till he was come to
the age of eleven years. In which time

Kirum
 was so balanc'd with his fellow
Regents, that he durst not attempt the
least alteration. But such was the crafty
conduct of his demeanor, that he had


made many of the 
Almocadens
 among the

Alàrbs
 to be his 
creatures
 and ready at
his Devotion, and of whose assistance
he might rely, when he saw it convenient
to time a Revolution: which he deferr'd
to the entrance of the second yeare of

Labèsh's
 reigne, being the thirteenth of
his age. At which time 
Kirum
 secretly
retired from Court, and was not heard
of, till he appear'd in the head of a nu∣merous
Army of 
Alàrbs,
 whom he had al∣lured
into Rebellion with the promises
of large Incoms, the baite disloyalty still
leaps at.


Labèsh
 quickly took the Alarm, and
with considerable Forces marcht toward

Kirum,
 if possible to end the Warr in the
place where it was begun. The Moors
highly extol the valour and conduct of
this young King, who forgetting the de∣lights
and toys of that age, devoted him∣self
to the severities of Military Disci∣pline,
constantly watching in the Camp,
or courageously fighting in the Battel.
For four years His fortunes and 
Kirum
's
had their vicissitudes, for so long they
fought with dubious presages of the
event; till Treachery at last is said to have


given 
Kirum
 that conquest which cou∣rage
could not; for 
Labèsh
 being invited
by 
Kirum
 to receive his Recantation,
met with a Barbarous death, where he
hoped to receive a Loyal subjection.
Others report that 
Kirum
 slew him with
his own hands in that fatal Battel, which
proved the finishing overthrow.


After the death of 
Labèsh, Kirum
 be∣came
too powerful for the resistance of
his scattered Forces, haveing none left
under whose conduct they might venture
their last Efforts; so that now all oppo∣sitions
being removed with the King,

Kirum
 made a quiet march to 
Morocco,

where the Citizens received him with
all the significations of subjection, in
whose imitation the adjoyning 
Cavílas

brought in the pledges of their Allegi∣ance
to 
Kirum:
 which they did not in∣termit,
till by a natural death he resign'd
the Kingdom to his Son 
Muley Boucar,

who after the short reigne of three
months was dethron'd by 
Taffalete,
 of
which Revolution more will be said in
the story of that prevailing 
Zeriff.


The Moors having for a long season
been torn and distracted with the unna∣tural


Murders of 
Sidans
 Sons, and wea∣ried
out with following those Wars,
which had no juster causes then private
interests and envious Annimosities, be∣gan
at last to provide for their own peace
and safety. The adored 
Zeriffian
 Fami∣ly
was extinct in 
Labèsh,
 whereby they
were quitted from obedience to that
Race. 
Kirum
 by several of the 
great ones

living distant from the Court, was look∣ed
upon as one, both by unjustness of
title, and meanness of Pedegree, unfit to
receive their Allegiance. In this shaken
and doubtful State of affairs, some stood
neuter in their judgements, but outward∣ly
complyed with the present Govern∣ment;
others resolved to stand upon
their Guard, chooseing rather to run the
hazards of War, then to enjoy the safety
of a dishonourable Peace.


Cidi Hamet-Ali-Haiáshi, Cidi Mahu∣met
Ben-el Hadge-Ben-Boucar,
 and the

Zeriff
 of 
Benzaruel
 were the 
Chiefs
 in
these new commotions, but all opposite
factions, and all 
Alarbs,
 and all great
Saints: The last of the three contented
himself with the protection of 
Ben Zaru∣el,

a large Cavíla almost impregnable


by nature, in whose Government his An∣cestors
for many years had lived in
peace. But after two months of stout re∣sistance
was subdued by 
Tafilete;
 who
took with him the Aged 
Zeriff,
 and di∣spersed
his Family, of which there per∣haps
will be an opportunity of speaking
more in another paragraph.


Haiáshi
 and 
Ben-Boucar,
 gifted with
greater ambitions, laboured to enlarge
the Curtains of their Territories, and
each seem'd to aime at no less then
the Empire of Mauritania Tingitana.
Their outward Sanctimony equald them
in the peoples affection and esteem, and if
they could have reconciled their Inter∣ests,
and joyned in the same designe, they
had shared that state, which both lost,
while each would have all or none: of
whose rise and fall these succeeding pe∣riods
will give you information.


Cidi Hamet Ali Haiáshi
 was an 
Alarb,

(or one of that sort of 
Moors,
 who live un∣der
Tents and in Mountains, without any
fixed habitations, as I shall shew in my
notices upon this Country,) who had the
learning of a 
Talib,
 and sanctity of a 
Ma∣rabout;

by which he was esteemed as an


Oracle among his Countrymen, who up∣on
all Emergent occasions repaired unto
him for advice and Instruction; which
they received as Infallible, and obey'd
as a Law. His Parentage according to
the 
Moresco Heraldry
 was not obscure;
for the Government of 
Abenimálec
 was
Hereditary to his Family, and legally
descended to his possession. Which 
Abeni∣málec

being a very large Cavíla, upon the
river of 
Mamora,
 was by 
Haiashi
 gover∣ned
with that politick carriage, which
made him reverenced of his own people,
and fear'd of his neighbours, as appear'd
in their ready abetting his enterpri∣ses.


The late suspected death of 
Muley
Sheck,
 together with the violent murther,
and dethroning of his Son, both 
Haiashi's

beloved Soveraigns, made 
Kirum,
 whom
he supposed to have been as well the se∣cret
contriver of the first, as he saw him
the open acter of the second villany, to
be odious to his thoughts, and unfit for
his obedience. Revenge, whose lawful∣ness
is an Article in the Moors Creed,
put 
Haiashi
 into Arms, with intent, if
not to depose 
Kirum
 from being King,


yet at least keep himself from becoming
his Subject. His first Musters consisted
ownly of the Levies of his own 
Cavíla,

to which were daily accessions of the
Neighboring 
Almócadens,
 which helpt
to adjust his Insurrection. His Forces
being soon increased above his hopes,
he order'd his March toward 
Fez,
 the
Metropolis of the Kingdom of that name.
This ancient City was now govern'd by

Ʋbahà, Kirums
 Creature; who upon
the advance of 
Haiáshi
's Forces, secret∣ly
stole away to 
Morocco,
 as not daring
to trust himself to his own valour, or
the fidelity of the Citizens. By the
flight of 
Ʋbahà, Fez
 being left Gover∣norless,
it became the easie Atchievement
of 
Haiáshi;
 under whose Command it
continued seven Years, and was a fair
addition to his Greatness and Safety,
being (as was said) the Metropolis of the
Kingdom.


Haiáshi
 by his Successes began to be
the envy of 
Ben-Boucar,
 who for some
Years after his Revolt from 
Morocco,
 con∣tented
himself with the solitary Domi∣nion
of 
Záwia,
 where he lived in a
House of that name, which for its Reli∣gious


Foundation, was become a Sanctu∣ary,
or Refuge for Offenders. The In∣habitants
of 
Záwia
 are reported to be
very numerous and Warlike, yet by rea∣son
of remoteness, they created 
Haiáshi

very small Disturbances; besides, 
Ben-Boucar

was unwilling to refer himself
to the uncertain Decision of the Sword,
which, in all probability, must have gi∣ven
the Victory to 
Haiáshi,
 by whose
Forces he was far exceeded. He there∣fore
betook himself to Stratagem, and
consults with 
Ali Ben Hamet, Almocaden
 of

Saphían,
 one whom 
Haiáshi
 had not yet
entirely subdued, by what method their
common Enemy might be removed. Now
the 
Moors,
 in removal of those they hate,
seem to know no other Policies, besides
an armed Violence, and secret Massacre.
The two Conspirators saw their inabili∣ty
to undertake the former, and there∣fore
resolved to put the latter in execu∣tion.


Ali Ben Hamet
 greedy of that sweet
bit Revenge, and to express it upon 
Hai∣áshi,

who had dispoiled him of his Right,
uudertook to be his Assasinate: which
he thus effected. 
Haiáshi
 being lodged


in his Tent near 
Azount,
 a Fountain he
greatly esteemed in the 
Cavíla
 of 
Atcleik,

about six Leagues North of 
Alcazàr,
 was
in the Night visited by 
Ali,
 accompany∣ed
with about 70 Horse, who came not
with any shew of Hostility, but with a
pretence of Friendship, declaring, That
his Errand was design'd to render him∣self

Haiáshies
 Subject, and to receive the
continuance of his 
Cavíla
 from his hand.
Under this Cloak 
Haiáshi
 received him
into his Tent, and thereby gave him the
opportunity of Murthering him, which
he effected with one Stab. The Mur∣therer
had his Accomplices ready to
make his Escape, which was the less dif∣ficult,
because 
Haiáshi
 had no Guards,
which he had declined either to save
Charges, or dissemble his confidence
in 
the Moors, who are best made faithful
by being trusted; but very vindictive,
when they find themselves suspected.


Ben-Boucar
 being ascertain'd by 
Ali

of 
Haiáshies
 treacherous Slaughter, in
the Twelfth Year of his Revolt, he in∣cèssantly
marcht to take Possession of his
Country, which he found ready at his
Devotion; either because the People


were unprovided for Opposition; or,
that they thought 
Ben-Boucar
's Superi∣ority
was less obnoxious to exception,
then any other they could elect. The

Almócadens,
 mindful of their accustom∣ed
method to preserve their Commands,
secretly one after another subscribed to

Ben-Boucar
's Regiment; onely 
Fez
 and

Alcazàr
 cost him some time and Blood in
their Reduction. But at last they yield∣ed
upon Articles, 
Arzila
 having first
shown them the way. 
Ben-Boucar
's next
March was to 
Tituan,
 govern'd by the
Ancient and Worthy Family of the 
Nar∣sis,

out of which he had received a Wife,
and by that Relation was welcome to the
Supremacie of that City.


Ben-Boucar
 having brought this part
of 
Barbary
 to his subjection, resolved
to return to 
Záwia:
 But before he left
the Country, he took from the Grandees
thereof, the best Assurances he was able
for their Obedience and Fidelity. Next,
he disposed the Towns of greatest Im∣portance,
to the Government of his Sons
and Favorites. To his eldest Son 
Abdal∣la

he entrusted the Rule of 
Salla,
 which
he had observed proner to Sedition then


the rest, and yet much addicted to Per∣sons
famed for Piety, for which 
Abdalla

was arrived at a Saintship. To his se∣cond
Son 
Mahumed,
 he committed the
care of 
Fez,
 to whom he saw the People
thereof have a peculiar Inclination. To
his third Son 
Hamet Zéer,
 or 
Hamet the
less,
 he gave the command of 
Shehàll,
 a
Mountain of rude Inhabitants, yet much
addicted to obey a fierce nature, where∣with

Hamet Zéer
 was furnished. 
Arzila

he left to 
Benzèir, a Thing of his own
framing:
 And 
Alcazar
 to 
Cidi Benzían.

After this Partition, he returned to his
Religious 
Záwia,
 where in great Peace
he enjoyed the fruits of his War, making
the easiness of his Yoak an argument
with the People to bear it.


But the memory of 
Haiáshi
's trea∣cherous
Death (compassed by 
Ben-Bou∣car)

was still fresh in the Brests of those
Sons, whose Fathers had their Fortunes
thereby depress'd; which 
Ben-Boucar,

as he could not but know, so he could
not but conclude, 
That the vindictive
Spirit of a
 Moor 
would take the first oc∣casion
of avenging.
 In prevention where∣of,
he took with him to 
Záwia
 such Sons


as he saw were likeliest to inherit their
Fathers hatred against him; not as Ho∣stages
of Peace, but as Pledges of his
Care, whom being as yet in their non-age,
he loved to Print with the Chara∣cters
of a peaceable acquiescence in his
Authority. Among these Youths, young

Gaylan
 was most considerable, and in∣deed
the only Person that he detained:
whose Story now succeeds, in which will
be supplyed what is here wanting of 
Ben-Boucar.


In 
Beniworfut,
 near to 
Arzila,
 lived
the Family of the 
Gaylans,
 which was
of that sort of 
Moors
 stiled 
Barabàrs,
 and
to which through flux of time, the Go∣vernment
of that 
Cavíla
 was become He∣reditary.
This House (though never low
or obscure) began to be signally advan∣ced
in 
Ali Gaylan
 the Father, which
proved but a Prophesie of its downfall
in 
El Hader
 the Son; whose Ambitio

lost what the others Humility had ob∣tained.

Ali
 was in great favor with 
Hai∣áshi,

and a chief Engine of his advance∣ment,
in which he was observed not
much to endeavor his own. But his great∣est
Renown sprang from his Zeal for the



Mahumetan Law,
 an Artifice which sel∣dom
failes, & a knack with which who∣soever
is gifted, cannot want Reverence
among the 
Moors. Arzila
 being much
moved with his Sanctity, invited him to
a residence among them, which they re∣warded
with considerable Rents, and
great Testimonies of respect.


This 
Ali Gaylan
 spent the last Scene
of his Life with great satisfaction to

Haiáshi
's prosperity, whom at his Death
he left without any threatning Progno∣sticks
of an alteration in his State: But
when he grew sensible of the near ap∣proaches
of his end, he called for his Be∣loved

El Hader,
 to whom he recom∣mended
the care of his Family, Govern∣ment
of his 
Cavlla,
 imitation of his
Conversation and Faith to 
Haiáshi. El
Hader
 was too young for the undertaking
all this when his Father dyed, which
caused the provident Parent to leave him
to the careful Tuition of 
Hamet Benzían,
Almocadèn
 of 
Beni-Haròs,
 with whom he
remained, till removed thence by 
Ben-Boucar,

after the reducement of 
Haiáshi.

About the xxiii of his Age, this 
El Hader
Ben Ali Gaylan,
 was married to the


Daughter of one 
Akadim,
 a principal
Man in 
Beniworfut,
 upon which Mar∣riage
he had license to return home; a
Concession that proved very fatal to

Ben-Boucar.
 For 
El Hader
 being got
to his own Territories, where he received
an affectionate wellcome; there hap∣pened
a Commotion in the populous 
Ca∣víla
's
of 
Saphean, Sháwia,
 and 
Homàr,

(all 
Alarbes)
 which denyed to pay 
Ben-Boucar

the accustomed Rights, & were so
far from an obedient tender thereof, that
they inhumanely murthered his two Bre∣thren,

Abdelhálac
 and 
Missínievi,
 whom
he sent to demand them.


The news of this Insurrection quickly
arrived 
El Hader,
 who thereupon, with
some of the best Horse of his 
Cavíla,
 in∣stantly
posted to 
Alcazar,
 where accord∣ing
to Intelligence he met with 
Ali Ben
Hamet, Haiáshi
's Murtherer, whom with
his own hand he killed, in revenge of the
Murther he had committed upon his Fa∣thers
Friend: In whose death, he pull'd
down one of 
Ben-Boucars
 best Support∣ers
in this Canton of his Dominion. Next
he speeded to 
Arzíla,
 forsaken by 
Ben-Boucars

Alcáyde, who upon the tydings


of 
Hamets
 death, and the 
Alárbes
 revolt,
durst not trust himself among a People
whom he saw zealously to favor his Ma∣sters
Enemy.


Upon this 
Gaylan
 appeared at 
Ar∣zíla,

which was very acceptable to his
Fathers old Admirers, who readily yield∣ed
him their utmost Assistances, and
were seconded with several of the adja∣cent

Cavíla
's. 
Ben-Boucar
 coming to
chastize the seditious 
Alárbes,
 and to a∣venge
his Brothers blood, which he spee∣dily
dispatc'd; his next care was to ren∣der

Gaylan
 sensible of his Deportment,
who, upon his advance, took sanctuary
in 
Arzíla,
 where he lay immured, till such
time as necessity forced 
Ben-Boucar
 to
withdraw his Levies. Upon every such
retreat, 
Gaylan
 was still at his wonted
disturbances, and yet upon every re∣turn
of the Enemy, he betook himself
to the protection of 
Arzila;
 Out of
which nothing could fetch him, but a
close, tedious, and expensive Siege, a
thing ill agreeing with the 
Moors
 Custom
and Provision.


Ben-Boucar,
 weary of that Fatigue, in
which for some Years he had been exer∣cised,


and whereof he saw no end, pro∣ferr'd

Gaylan
 this Accommodation: That
if he would pay him the accustomary
Tributes, and an acknowledgement of
superiority, he should peaceably possess
the Government of 
Arzila,
 and his own

Cavíla. Gaylan
 was not backward to ac∣cept
an Accommodation so favorable to
his present Condition and future De∣signs;
being at that time shut up in 
Ar∣zila,

and yet entertaining an ambition
of making himself Lord of the Coun∣trey.
This accommodation being rati∣fyed,

Ben-Boucar
 returned home, and

Gaylan
 was set at liberty to take his Di∣vertisements
in the Countrey, where his
plausible Fortune and Personage, Zeal
for their Law, and reservation of Car∣riage,
made the Grandees of the Coun∣trey
greatly affected with his Society.

Gaylan
 finding himself under so favorable
an Aspect, thought of Strengthning his
Intentions by contracting Alliances with
the best 
Casts:
 whereupon he took him
a second Wife, a Daughter of 
Cassian
Shot Almocadèm
 of the 
Cavila
 called 
An∣gera,

a Warlike Family, and descended
of the 
Andalusian
 Moors banished 
Spain.



His third Wife was the Daughter of 
Co∣gèr
Alcáyde
 of 
Alcazar,
 and a leading
Person in that part of the Countrey.
His fourth was a Virgin Daughter of

Múfadal,
 Governor of 
Tituan,
 which
made up the 
legal number
 of 
four,
 so ma∣ny
being allowed by their Prophet: up∣on
the death of his second Wife, to keep
up the account, he marryed the Daugh∣ter
of one 
Messimd,
 a popular Person in

Tituàn,
 and descended of a Saint.


By these Alliances he got an Interest
both in the Persons and Places of great∣est
moment in this part of the Countrey,
by which he was animated to break with

Ben-Boucar:
 a design of such nature,
that 
Gaylan
 durst not venture thereon
in any open Declaration, but advisedly
disguised it under a pretended Enter∣prise
against the Christians, Garrison'd
in several Towns on the 
Barbary
 Coast,
maintained by the Crowns of 
Portugal

and 
Spain.
 Which to effect the better,
he first shewed the 
Moors
 how their
Prophet, both by his 
Example
 and

Doctrine,
 had taught them to exercise
their Revenge against all Opposers of his

Law;
 and that whoever should dye in


its Defense or Propagation, were assu∣red
of Paradise; and then concluded,
how much it would redound to the ho∣nor
of that Generation, if they should
drive the Christians out of their Coun∣trey,
to 
which
 and their Religion they
were the 
common Enemy.


This Proposal was strangely moving
with People of all capacities, and the
report of 
Gaylans
 Intentions against the
Christians, induced many to be his Fol∣lowers,
who otherwise would have es∣chewed
his Company: But having drawn
in some by his Affinity, others with fair
Promises, and the generality with Re∣ligious
Pretences, he began a little to
pull aside the Vail, and shew the naked
Face of his Design. Having given some
Testimonies of his Zeal and Valour a∣gainst
the Christians, and enraged them
to an activity above what they had of late
expressed: He likewise laid before them
their necessity of Union, and that they
should combine under one Leader, the
better to carry on what they had begun.
He also set before them their unhappi∣ness
to be governed by one whom 
age

and 
distance
 render'd so unfit to relieve


them, in case of sudden necessity; and
withall magnifyed his Title to the Go∣vernment
of the Country, equal to 
Ben-Boucars.

The People found no reason
to dispute any part of 
Gaylans
 Harangue,
in which they could perceive he aimed at
nothing but their safety. Whereupon
the 
Alcáyde
 of 
Alcasar, El Hàders
 Fa∣ther-in-law,
was the first that declared
for his Government, who was seconded
with several other Grandees of the
Countrey, so that in short time all the

Cavíla
's which 
Ben-Boucar
 had taken
from 
Haiáshi,
 left him as they had done
their former Master, and adhered to

Gaylan.
 But 
Sálla
 and 
Tituàn
 utterly
dissented from the rest, and instead of
yielding a tame submission to 
Gaylans

Empire, they altogether resisted him.
This moved 
El Hader
 to advance his
Forces first against 
Tituàn,
 which he
found very stubborn: for 
Abdel Crim
Nacsis
 (the chief Governor thereof)
would be inclined to no thoughts of 
Pa∣cification

or 
Surrender,
 while he could
cherish any hopes of being relieved by
his near Relative 
Ben-Boucar.
 But at
length, despairing of any Succors, and


seeing the great spoils 
Gaylan
 was like to
make of their Vineyards, Gardens, and
Houses of Pleasure about the Town,
which the Inhabitants highly valued for
their profit and delight, he sought to
prevent him in that desolation, by a ma∣ture
and timely Address for Peace:
which was welcome News to 
Gaylan,
 be∣ing
very covetous to be Master of a place
so considerable for Strength, Riches,
and Traffick. The Articles were soon
concluded, 
Gaylan
 demanding no more
then their subjection, a constant Levy of
Soldiers to serve him on occasions of
greater moment; and that one of his
own Election should be equal in the Go∣vernment
with 
Nacsis.
 Upon this Paci∣fication
with 
Tituan, Gaylan
 march'd a∣gainst

Sálla,
 which was under the Rule
of that great Saint, 
Abdala Ben-Boucar,

who upon weak Temptations retired to
the Castle, leaving 
Gaylan
 the Signory of
the Town, wherein he placed some For∣ces
of his own, to secure the Inhabitants
from Apostacy. But not long after, 
Ab∣dala

being sore pressed for want of Pro∣visions,
and hopeless of being succored
by his Father, privily quitted the Castle,


having first of all sent away in an English
Frigat, his Wives to 
Phedálla.


The gaining of this Castle made 
Gay∣lan

sole Master of this North West Can∣ton
of 
Barbary,
 beyond which he was
never able to enlarge his Territories; al∣beit
he was strugling for more room, as
foreseeing that endeavors after more,
was the means to be secure of what he
had got already. He often tryed his va∣lor
upon the 
Xerif, Hamet Bocálla,
 chief
of 
Benzaruel,
 and 
Beni-Hálet,
 but his
Attempts still proved successless, for
those 
Cavila
's are almost inaccessible by
reason of their Mountainousness. 
Erif,
Botoía, Beniuphràsh, Benimisgíldah,
 and

Benijaacòb,
 being all large 
Cavíla
's which
for Generations had been govern'd by
the house of 
Arras,
 under the title of 
Al∣cayde,

never receiv'd any attempt of 
Gay∣lan
's
reducing them. And albeit he want∣ed
neither courage nor ambition to have
made himself Sultan of 
Barbary,
 yet his
Stars denyed him that Grandeur, and he
was never able to stretch his Arm beyond
the command of 22 
Cavíla
's, whose names
are hereunto annexed, with the number
of their usual levies of Men for the Wars.






The List of the Names of the Ca∣víla's,
with the number of their
Forces, which were under Gay∣lans
Government in the Year,
1666.


1. 
ANgerá
 under the command of

Cassian Shot, Gaylans
 Father-in-law,
is a large 
Cavíla,
 inhabited with

Barabàrs,
 and is able to raise 500 Foot,
and an equal number of Horse.


2. 
Wadròss,
 the nearest Neighbor to

Tanger,
 yields upon any urgent occasion
800 for the Wars, in equal number of
Horse and Foot.


3. 
Benidèr,
 about ten Leagues from

Tanger,
 can bring 500 Foot and a thou∣sand
Horse to the Field.


4. 
Minkél,
 a small 
Cavíla,
 not able to
leavy above 500 in all.


5. 
Hammihárshen
 is well Peopled, and
able to advance 1000 in all; the great∣est
part Foot.


6. 
Hamnizóuer
 commonly raiseth as
many.



7. 
Alkaróbe,
 being a large and well-inhabited

Cavíla,
 is able, upon a small
warning, to arm out 1500 Horse and
Foot in equal numbers; it is govern'd
by 
Mahumet Akadim,
 and 
Lassin Akadim

his Brother, who revolted from 
Gaylan

and sided with 
Tafilete.


8. 
Benióbras,
 of Horse and Foot
can raise a thousand; it is governed by

Ali Azús,
 who revolted from 
Gaylan
 to
the 
Xeriff.


9. 
Beniharòs
 is next adjoyning to the
former, and able to send 1200 to the
Field: This 
Cavíla
 is govern'd by 
Lasin
El Phut,
 who was the first that invited

Tafilete
 to advance against 
Gaylan,
 pro∣mising
him his assistance.


10. 
Beni Josèph
 is a 
Cavíla
 of two days
Journey, able to raise 3000 in all, but
very few Horse: It is very Mountainous,
and so fortified by Nature, that it has
often attempted to stand upon its own
defence. It is govern'd by 
Lazid Ali
Mahumed,
 who left 
Gaylan
 upou the ap∣proach
of 
Tafilete.


11. 
Sumátta
 is a small 
Cavíla,
 whose
usual levy is 500 of all sorts: It is go∣vern'd
by 
Talib Ali Elfiluz,
 who joyned
with 
Tafilete.



12. 
Beniworfùt,
 which advanc'd 600
Horse, and as many Foot: The Govern∣ment
hereof belongs to the House of

Gaylan,
 but since 
Tafilets
 Empire, the

Almocaden
 thereof is one 
Mahumed Den∣gith.


13. 
Arzila
 and 
Salli
 make one 
Cavila,

and when but easily charged, raise 500
Foot, and as many Horse; they are go∣verned
by an 
Alcayde.


14. 
Halixérif
 raiseth with 
Alcazar

1200 Foot in all: it belongs to the 
Al∣cayde

of 
Alcazar
 who in 
Gaylans
 time
was 
Mahumet Cozhez,
 but now 
Ali.


15. 
Kit
n,
 which being very small,
its Forces exceed not 200.


16. 
Benimadar
 yields about the same
number.


17. 
Beni Záid,
 which if the same with
that in 
Leo Afer,
 must yield more Sol∣diers
then 500, though that was the or∣dinary
levy exacted by 
Gaylan.


18. 
Al Couff
 is a small 
Cavila,
 lying
between 
Alcazar Ezzaguer,
 and 
Ceuta,

which usually sent in 200.




These are all, or the most of them

Barabars,
 who have fixed Habitations,


living in Neighborhood and a setled
Conversation; and of these consisted

Gaylans
 chief Forces: yet he had be∣sides
these four 
Cavíla
's of 
Alárbes,

namely, 
Delholòt, Sháwia, Beni-Guedàr,

and 
Saphián,
 which are reported to be
very numerous and Warlike, lying West
of 
Salla
 and 
Alcazar:
 But by reason of
their untractable nature, and floating
manner of living, they are not so cer∣tain
in their Musters, nor ready upon E∣mergencies.
These 
Gaylan
 could never
bring under a perfect subjection, but was
content they should pay some small Tri∣bute
in acknowledgement to his Supe∣riority.


The above mentioned 
Cavíla
's were
the total of 
Gaylans
 Dominions, beyond
which he could never make any Enlarge∣ment.
He was for the space of twelve
Years prosperous in his Government, and
the general success of his Enterprises,
raised him highly in the estimate of his
Followers: 
It being the Genius of this
People, to make the Prosperity of the Acti∣on,
an undoubted argument of its Justice,
and the voice of Heaven to approve it.


Gaylan
 from his Youth was trained up


in Arms: And for the Adventures he had
made upon 
Tanger,
 when 
Portugúes,
 was
called the 
Almocaden
 of those Fields.
But not to mention any thing of his pro∣ceedings
against the Christian (that be∣ing
no design of this Paper) we find him
constantly in War with the 
Moor. Ben-Boucar

was still Master of 
Fez,
 and rea∣dy
upon every frail Temptation to en∣ter

Gaylans
 Frontiers, which kept them
both in continual Hostility. The Peo∣ple
at length wearied out with the inces∣sant
Troubles occasioned by these Ri∣vals
for the Supremacy, were ready to
adhere to some third Party, able to set∣tle
the Government in such a single Per∣son,
as both by Title and Strength should
be above an ordinary Competitor:
Which unexpectedly came to pass in the
Sixteen hundred and sixty fifth of the
Crucifixion; for about the entrance of
that Year, 
Muley Reshid
 first appeared
with the Prognosticks of a Revolution,
of whom I here set down this short Ac∣count.


In the Province of 
Dara,
 in 
Numedia,

the Countrey of 
Mahumed Ben Amet,

Founder of the 
Xeriffian
 Empire, there


arose a 
Mulátto
 (one whose Father was
white, and Mother black) one 
Reshid
Ben Mahumed,
 a Native of the Town of

Taffilete,
 the place whether 
Mahumed

(the second Son of 
Mahumed Ben Amet)

the second of that Family (who was Em∣peror
of 
Morocco)
 had confined his eldest
Brother 
Amet,
 whom he had taken Pri∣soner.
This 
Reshid
 ripening in Years
and discretion, began to make himself
known to the World by the name of the

Xeriff
 of 
Tafilete:
 By which Title he
made himself descended of the 
Xeriffian

House, which so long had enjoyed the
Empire of 
Barbary,
 and of the Pro∣phet

Mahumet. [Xeriff]
 (as was said)
being a Name peculiar to that Deceiver.
And because a research into 
Moresco
 Ge∣neologies
shall have labour for the pains,
I shall enquire no further after 
Reshids

Pedigree, then to observe that his Fa∣ther
was one 
Muley Mahumed,
 a Prince
of great Authority in 
Numedia,
 who be∣sides
his four legal Wives, had several
Concubines; of one of which, being
a 
Negra,
 he begot this 
Reshid.
 His Fa∣ther
dying while he was a minor, he was
committed to the Tuition of his Elder


Brother 
Muley Hamet Ben-Mahumed.

This 
Reshid
 having accomplisht his Pu∣pillage,
began to look into his Conditi∣on,
and to enquire what was left him by
his deceased Father: For by the 
Mo∣resco

Institutes, the Sons of Concu∣bines
are equal Sharers in the Patrimo∣ny
with those of the lawful Wives. While

Reshid
 made himself the comparative of
his Brother, he was lost into an Emu∣lation,
that spurr'd him into the endea∣vours
of promoting his Fortunes. He
saw his own Condition, and that of Pub∣lick
Affairs, qualified for no other Pro∣posal
to effect his desired Advancement,
but what was to be obtained by the
Sword: Whereupon he consulted with
his own 
Genius,
 by what Artifice he might
soonest imbroil 
Barbary
 in a new War,
and communicated the Design with some
few 
Moors
 of his own Complexion. At
the first opening of his Adventure, his
Retinue exceeded not the number of
thirty, and those of an inferior Quality,
who yet, by reason of the contracted∣ness
of their Lots, were disposed to ex∣ecute
any Proposition that was probable
to enlarge them.



With this paucity of Adherents, 
Re∣shid

secretly withdrew from 
Tafilete
 to

Tessa,
 a place abounding with Inhabi∣tants,
but as poor as numerous. Here

Reshid
 received the Royal Title of 
Mu∣ley,

and was Proclaimed King of 
Tafilete.

And in acknowledgement and token of
his Royal Power, the People brought
him Presents, as the known Pledges of
their Loyal subjection. This new 
Sul∣tan

manifested a great disdain of that A∣varitious
humour, which had possessed
the minds of the 
Barbarian
 Princes,
much inveighing against the sordid De∣votion
of Sacrificing the Wealth of their
Subjects to themselves. He therefore by
a subtil contrariety refused to shrine up
more Money in his Coffers, then might
decently defray Expences, leaving at the
first that pleasing bait to be devoured by
his Proselytes, whereby he purchased a
great reinforcement of his Retinue. 
Tes∣sa,

which he elected for his first 
place
 of

Arms,
 swarm'd (as was said) with poor
Inhabitants, whose Labors were too lit∣tle
for their Sustenance, which might ren∣der
them the readier to take the Impres∣sion
of any Counsil that was likely to


better their Condition. And 
Muley Re∣shid

is conceived to have repaired to this
beggerly Colony, to meet with an easier
advance of Followers.


By rowling up and down, he had in
short time gathered so great a Bulk, as
threatned an Inundation wheresoever it
should spread it self. Attended with this
numerous Rabble, he addressed himself
to his Elder Brother 
Muley Hamet,

in a posture compounded of Hostility
and Friendship, of whom he demand∣ed
the Estate left him by his Father,
that he might be the better enabled to
perform something worthy of 
Their
House.
 The two Brothers began to wax
hot in the Conference; and it is said,
that the Language on both sides was so
exasperating, that they had like to have
forgot the distance of their Condition,
and to have closed up their Discourse
with an unmannerly Combate. Both
were so far transported with Anger, that
without the least overture of Reconcile∣ment,
they fell into declared Hostility,
and left their private Quarrel to the
publick determination of a War.


In which 
Muley Reshid
 was so fortu∣nate


as to slay his Brother, and thereby
was left without any to justle him in the
Government of 
Dara.
 This success did
so swell 
Reshid
's bosome, that less room
could not circumscribe him then a King∣dom.
The present Affairs of 
Barbary

were auspicious to his Enterprises: the
Countries being rent into petty Monar∣chies,
every 
Almocaden
 that was able,
having put himself into a defensive Po∣sture,
aiming to live independent in his
Government. This division much faci∣litated

Muley Reshid
's Designs: yet no∣thing
was more conducing to his success,
then his careful execution of Justice, the
want whereof had been a general pre∣tended
grievance; every detected Cri∣minal
had condign punishment accord∣ing
to demerit, whereby he became both
beloved and feared.


Together with his care for publick
Justice, he continued his seeming neg∣lect
of Riches; stil dividing among his

Partizans
 the estates of those whom their
own obstinacy made his spoils. But those,
who gently yeilded to his mercy, he ge∣nerously
protected both in their Goods
and Persons. This obliging carryage


gave wings to his 
Fame,
 and made him
where ever he came to be received with
acclamations; The common voice was

Illah Enzur Muley Reshid, i.e.
 God bless
Prince 
Reshid
 & the vulgar esteem'd him
sent on purpose to chastize 
oppressors.


Having made himself master of his
Brothers Territories, he advanced to∣wards

Erìf
 govern'd by the 
Alcayd
Arras,
 who was his Brothers confede∣rate,
and his Father-in-law, and who
in confidence of this relation (if we may
credit report) granted 
Muley Reshid
 a
peaceable admission into his Dominions;
wherein for some Moons he deported
himself as a Son. But being ascertained
of the 
Alcayds
 intention to contract a
Friendship with 
Tanger,
 and that he had
dispatch'd an envoy to the same purpose
he concluded that he now wanted no
reason to declare himself an enemy to
the 
Alcayd's
 proceedings, and under this
pretext arm'd against him. The 
Alcayd

seeing the 
Xériff
 attempting to dispoil
him of his Territories; and that con∣trary
to all 
Ingenuity
 and 
Laws
 of 
Ho∣spitality;

he began to usurp the Country
of his Entertainer, he thought it high


time to provide for his defence. There∣fore
with some 
Extemporary Forces
 he
repaired to the 
Maritim Bos
mma
 where
he reinforc'd a small Fort; not out of
any hopes to maintain it against the

Xériff,
 but thereby to have the advan∣tage
of surrendring it and himself upon
gentler Articles. 
Muley Reshid
 advised
of the 
Alcaids
 flight, addressed himself
to the pursuit, and overtook him at the
mentioned Fortress. Which in few daies
the 
Alcayd
 delivered up to be demo∣lish'd
by the 
Xeriff,
 and himself his pri∣soner.


This Victory, or rather surprisal of
the 
Alcayd
 was a fair accession to 
Re∣shids

power, having now subjected the
only Potentate, whom the rest of the
neighbouring Grandees had so often
Courted for a Confederate.


Having thus obtained the command of

Erìf
 and the rest of his 
Fatherinlaws

Country, it raised in him no less aspire∣ing
hopes then to become 
Sultan
 of

Mauritania Tingitana,
 at that time rent
into parties. To the accomplishing of
which design he saw the gaining of 
Fez

would contribute much to his esteem,


and give him admission into the heart of
the Kingdome. Upon this consideration
he resolutely march'd to trye his for∣tunes
with that ancient and famous Me∣tropolis.
This City was lately in the
Government and Possession of 
Cidi Ma∣humed,

second Son to 
Ben Boucar,
 who
was despoiled thereof, together with his
Life, by the cruelty of 
Bensállah, So∣heìr,

and 
Doríedi,
 said all to be 
Anda∣luzian

Moors, and who had the Govern∣ment
thereof divided among them, when

Reshid
 came against it. The news of
whose approach no sooner reach'd 
Fez.

but the Governors, whom guilt had made
cowardly, betook themselves to the
strongest holds of the City, depositing
the Keys into such Hands, as they thought
fittest to be entrusted with the protecti∣on
of the Gates. 
Reshid
 seeing that 
Fez

was likely to cost him dear, if he stayed
to take it by a formal Siege, thought of
having recourse to Stratagem; knowing
that he who aspires after nothing but
Conquest, ought not to binde him∣self
to the Laws of a fair Gamester.


Reshid
 had so long pressed the City by
impeding their Markets, that he might


reasonably imagine there was a want of
provision of Cattel; whereupon he re∣solved
to lodge some of his Forces near
the City Walls, and that himself, with
about sixteen more, would drive some
Cattel to the Gates of 
Fez,
 under the
disguise of Friends come to bring them
Provision. This he put in execution in
the Night, and coming with the Cattel
to the Gates, with a Voice counterfeit∣ing
haste and fear, they called to the
Guards for entrance, and desired that
they would take into their Protection
them and the booty brought for their
succour. Two were admitted to enter,
whereof the 
Xeriff
 is said to have been
one, who instantly slew the Centinel, and
thereby made way for the rest; who ha∣ving
seised the Keys, straight ascended a
small Turret over the Gate, and thence
gave the Signal to his Forces, lodged near
for the purpose to advance: And the
small Gun that was placed in the Gate,
he caused to be turned upon the City.
The Citizens being miserably confused
and affrighted at the suddenness of the
action, were not recovered of their Di∣stractions
till 
Reshid
 poured in his Army


amongst them; against whom being un∣able
to make any considerable oppositi∣on,
their last and only succour was a
timely submission, which they perform∣ed
with such humility, that 
Reshid
 had
no temptation to reject it. After they
were received into protection, the 
Fez∣ans

were not penurious in complaints a∣gainst
their Governors, imputing it to
their wilfull Pride, that the 
Xerif
 was
not received with such evidences of Ho∣nor,
as they had always born to that Ti∣tle.
But not staying at such useless Com∣plements,

Reshid
 in the first place took
into his possession the ancient Treasures
of the Kings of 
Fez.
 Next, he caused
the three Governors to be brought be∣fore
him, and having told them of their
great Oppressions of the People, he com∣manded
one of them to be burnt imme∣diately,
another to be dragg'd about the
Streets till he was dead; but the third he
committed to custody, and afterward is
said to have kill'd him with his own
hand: And then declared, 
That this was
the just recompence of all those who deal
unjustly with the People.


And having thus subjected the famous



Fez,
 his next Trophies he design'd up∣on

Ben-Boucar,
 whom without much re∣sistance
he took Prisoner, and brought
to 
Fez,
 and there granted him a liberal
Confinement, in token of that respect
which he bore his Piety and Age. After
this, he went against the 
Xerif
 of 
Ben∣zaruèl,

who proved a very resolute E∣nemy,
for with the strength of his own

Cavíla
 he found a Months work for all

Reshids
 Army, but at length was forced
to render himself Prisoner, and still re∣mains
in that Condition.


Reshid
 had now so far advanced his
Dominion in the Kingdom of 
Fez,
 that
he had none therein to oppose him but

El Hader Ben Ali Gaylan;
 who for his

military Skill, personal Valour,
 and ma∣ny
Years of 
Success
 and 
Settlement
 in his
Government, rendred 
Tafilete
 dubious
in his Councils how to proceed against
him. 
Tafraught,
 a prodigious ridge of
Mountains, so secured 
Gaylans
 Fronti∣ers,
that no part was left passable, but
what might easily be guarded. And there∣fore
to enter 
Gaylan
's Dominions by o∣pen
violence, 
Tafilete
 foresaw would cost
him the expense of more time then his


Affairs could spare: upon which refle∣ction,
he fell to his successful Art of ma∣king
a false Party in his Enemies Camp,
that he might obtain by 
intestine Trea∣chery,

what in this case he could not by
his own 
Force.
 To this end he secretly
enter'd into correspondence with 
Cidi
Lasin El Phut,
 Governor of 
Benittaròs,
(Gaylans
 chief Frontier 
Cavíla)
 who was
entrusted with the Avenue that let into

Gaylans
 Country. 
Lasin
 was not much
indisposed to a Revolt from 
Gaylan,
 be∣ing
one of those whom he had highly dis∣pleased
in not calling them to the ad∣jousting
of the last Peace with 
Tanger,

nor to partake of its Benefits (which
was very fatal to that juncture of 
Gay∣lan
's
Affairs) and because he saw the
growing power of 
Tafilete,
 and that al∣beit
for a while they might resist him, yet
in time he would eat through their 
Alps.

Upon these Temptations, or what other,
we may imagine operative upon the 
wa∣ry,
covetous, aspiring
 and 
revengeful
 na∣ture
of a 
Moor, Lasin
 contracted with

Tafilete, Reshid,
 or the 
Xeriff
 (which in
this Narrative do all express the same
Person) to advise him, when he should


attach the Passage, who to that end had
always a select Band in readiness. And
when by his own Example 
Lasin
 had
taught the Guards to be remiss, and had
got the advantage of 
Gaylans
 absence, he
gave 
Tafilete
 the Signal, who gain'd the
Passage, and with such suddenness set
upon the Reserves, that they were not
able to make any considerable resistance.


The news of this Disaster soon reacht

Alcazar,
 where 
Gaylan
 was entertaining
himself with his Relation 
Cogez,
 who
with some of his best Troops march'd to
the succour of his other Forces, which
otherwise had been totally destroyed.

Gaylan
 in this Encounter gave great te∣stimonies
of his Valour, and had, no
doubt, given the Enemy a brave repulse,
if his Infantry had not been wholly dis∣comfited
ere he could come to their re∣lief.
At last, finding himself oppressed
with number, he was forced to order the
Party that stuck to him to seek for their
safety, and himself, with about six more,
retreated to 
Arzila;
 from whence, as
one not well recover'd of the fright, he
acquainted that Excellent Person, Co∣lonel

H. Norwood,
 the Lieutenant Go∣vernor


of 
Tanger
 (with whom he was
then in League) with his Disgrace, in this
following Letter, Translated out of

Spanish.




The Superscription.
Al Ex
mo
 Senòr Don Enrique
Norwood.


Ex
t.
 Sir,


ALL Places are over-spread with the
Disasters and Events of our War.
The ill success at this time befaln me, hath
been by the Design of my Enemy, a 
Xerif

of 
Tafilete,
 who falling in with his Army,
surprised my careless out-guards, and broke
and rooted the whole Body. Upon notice
whereof, I got on Horse-back at 
Alcazar,

but found my People running away in so
great Disorder, that it exceeded my Power
to rally them till I came at 
Arzila.
 Whence
I am now necessitated to crave your Excel∣lencies
assistance, upon the account of that
Peace and Friendship so solemnly contract∣ed
betwixt us. I therefore desire, That you
would send me a Boat of good bigness, that


if I should be put to any strait, I might send
to you for succour, which I doubt not but
your Excellency will please to send me upon
Honorable Terms.


Also I desire your Excellency, that in case
any of my Guards, of what Quality soever,
do retire to your City with Cattle, or other∣wise,
that you would vouchsafe to favour
them with your Protection, and supply their
Necessities.


I crave your Excellencies Commands,
which I am ready to perform with great wil∣lingness.


The Bearers, your Mariners, promise to
return, by whom I intreat you to send a
larger Imbarcation.


May God keep your Excellency.

Arzila,
 
June 29.
S. V. 1666.




Assoon as the Lieutenant Governor
had perused the Letter, he resolved to
gratifie 
Gaylan
's desires, as being glad of
an opportunity to vindicate the 
honour

of the 
English Nation
 from some impu∣tations,
which 
Gaylan
 objected to the
Lieutenant Governor (when he was with


him at 
Arzila)
 and which was chiefly oc∣casioned
through some mistake between
the Great 
Tiveot
 and 
Gaylan,
 concerning
the time when the War should commence
in the Year 1663. For albeit the Earl
of 
Tiveot
 had sufficiently cleared the Ho∣nor
and Justice of that Action, yet 
Gay∣lan

seeming not so to apprehend it, the
Lieutenant Governor was glad of an oc∣casion
to let him know, That it was the
mind of his Master, the King of 
Great
Brittain,
 that all his Ministers should be
punctual in the observation of what they
stipulated in his Name. To which end,
in a generous and well-composed Let∣ter,
the Lieuteuant Governor condoled

Gaylan
's mis-fortune, assuring him of his
Friendship, and that he would exactly
comply with every Article of the Peace
concluded betwixt 
Tanger
 and his Ex∣cellency;
and that if any of his Vassals,
Allies, or Domestiques, should in any
Exigence make 
Tanger
 their Sanctuary,
they should find it no otherwise, and that
they should be treated according to their
Quality and Condition. This Letter
was sent by a Kinsman of the Lieutenant
Governors, who according to directions,


confirm'd 
Gaylan
 in the belief of meet∣ing
with all the succors that he could
reasonably expect from the lately con∣tracted
Friendship.


This Message, whose kindness was
doubled by its seasonableness and speed,
put new Spirits into 
Gaylan
's drooping
Concerns, and gave him Courage to
sound the temper of his revolted 
Caví∣la
's,
which he found well disposed to
his Service, albeit they were forced to
dissemble their Intentions till their Har∣vest
was secured, least otherwise they
should second the War with a Dearth▪
for so little is the Provision of the

Moors,
 that the loss or miscarriage of
one Crop, brings a Famine.


But while 
Gaylan
 was laboring to re∣tard,

Tafilete
 was improving his last Vi∣ctory:
and having possess'd himself of
the Passage into his Enemies Territo∣ries,
he quickly became Master of 
Alca∣zàr,

the chiefest of 
Gaylan
's Inland
Towns, which was deserted by 
Cidi Ha∣met
Cogèz,
 who for many Years had go∣vern'd
there by the Title of 
Alcayde.

The tydings of the 
Xerifs
 Successes no
sooner reach'd 
Tituan,
 but that Town


declared for him, and with their best
Solemnity Proclaimed him King. At the
same time the 
Shat
 of 
Angera,
 a prin∣cipal
Person in those parts, nearly re∣lated
to 
Gaylan
 by Blood and Marriage,
retired to the Woods in the Bay of that

Alcazàr,
 which stands upon the Midland
Sea; where he resolved to conceal him∣self,
whil'st he sent his Domestiques to

Ceuta,
 a 
Spanish
 Garrison, and 
Tanger,

to procure 
Seguròs
 for himself and Fa∣mily,
in case the 
Xerif
 should prove im∣placable,
and refuse to receive him un∣to
fair Quarters.


But the 
Shat
 of 
Angera
 tired with his
retreat, and cherishing some dull hopes
of 
Gaylan
's Recovery, sent in a Bille

to the Lieutenant Governor of 
Tanger

in 
Moresco,
 in which he seemed to insi∣nuate,
that he intended no submission
to the 
Xerif,
 which was Translated thus.


The Letter of 
Almócadem Casum Shat,

and his Sons 
Almócadem, Abdelcrìm,
 and

Almócadem Ali,
 to the Captain of 
Tan∣ger,

whom we honor much. Desiring that
he would do them the favour to send them
four Kintals of Powder, four hundred


Balls, and a Kintal of Lead, with fifty or
more Muskets: and that if the Captain
have any need of Wood or Barley, they will
repay him in that Commodity: This they
sollicit as 
Gaylan
's faithful Friends.


I have inserted this Letter for the sake
of its stile, being the first and only Ad∣dress
made in this manner to any of the
English Governors in 
Tanger.
 But how
hopeful soever the 
Shats
 Affairs might
appear at the date of this Letter, yet
very shortly after they seem'd to be in
a very languishing state, as was easily
to be collected by a large account there∣of
given to 
Cidi Hamet Algílo,
 who was
then in 
Tanger,
 and which is here trans∣lated
out of 
Arabique
 thus.


The Letter of 
Taliffo Hamet El Shat,

which is bid to salute 
Hamet Algílo,
 and
to give him an account of the Troubles that
have happened here; how that the same
Night that 
Taliffo Hamet El Shat
 left

Angera,
 he came into the Fields of 
Tan∣ger,

where he killed two Men, and took
away their Goods; and returning to the

Aldéa
 (or Village) he found not one Per∣son


at his House, neither Man nor Woman,
except 
Ali El Hag
 in the House of our Ʋn∣cle

Abdelcrim:
 all our Kinred were fled
to 
Ceuta.
 But coming to speak with the
People of 
Angera,
 they desired us for the
love of God to leave them, whereupon they
also fled to 
Ceuta:
 He that did this was

Ben-Halóo.
 I thereupon writ a Letter
to the King, to desire to have pity upon us.
I writ also to 
Almocadem Hamet Ben-Léefi,

and now write again for the Kings
Answer, and according to it I shall advise
both them and thee. Have thou patience,
and within two or three days the Answer
will be come. Moreover, I let thee know,
that we are guarding our Houses from fire
and mischief, having every Night twenty
upon the Guard. I endeavour to keep up
my Peoples courage. Know moreover, that
the King hath given to 
Abdelháder Alfif∣toah,

the Government of 
Angera,
 but the
People will not receive him, but have writ
to the King about it, though as yet they
have no answer. Lastly, I give thee to
understand, That the King hath burned
the Village of 
Benigerfut,
 and taken a∣way
their Goods.



So various was 
Gaylan
's Fortunes,
that while at one place he seem'd despe∣rate,
in another he was victorious, and
notwithstanding that at 
Angera Taffilete

was a Conquerour, as his letter inti∣mates,
at 
Arzila
 he was subdued; for
from thence 
Gaylan
 assured his Confe∣derates
that all his 
Cavílas
 were re∣turn'd
to their Obedience, that they had
massacred those 
Tafilete
 had left to keep
them in awe, and shut him in between
two rocky mountains; and that him∣self
was hastening thither to see his e∣nemy
and act his Catastrophe, and to
put a period to the war. At the same
time he gave out that 
Tituàn
 was peni∣tent
for their Revolt, and weary of the

Xerifs
 exactions, and were ready to joyn
with him to effect the utter overthrow
of that Imperious Invader.


Yet what face soever 
Gaylan
 put up∣on
his condition, it was certain that

Taffilete
 dayly advanced his conquest,
and at the same time when his ene∣my
thus confidently reported his di∣stress;
he was in a flourishing condition,
for the 
Xerif
 had then routed all 
Gay∣lan
's
fresh recruits, and in detestation


of him had taken up the bones of his Fa∣ther
and burn'd them, saying, 
That he
deserved no better, who was the root
of that bramble, which had so long ty∣rannically
rent and torn the poor.


He had also taken Prisoners some of

Gaylan's
 nearest relations, and sent them
to 
Fez,
 and committed great spoiles up∣on
their goods, whom he found absent
from their habitations, and had brought
a considerable wing within a league of

Arzila,
 where if he had stay'd to streigh∣ten
it, want of bread within a few moons
would have constrain'd them to surren∣der.


The Town of 
Tituàn
 was at this time
likewise so far from resuming 
Gaylan
's
Interest, that all things there seem'd set∣led
under the Authority and obedience
of 
Taffilete
 The notice of wich truth was
the subject of a letter sent to Colonel

Norwood
 (Lieutenant Governor of 
Tan∣ger)

whose Honorable proceedings
had render'd him so esteemed among
the Moors, that 
Taffilete
 thought him
a fit Person to be complemented; and
to that end order'd his 
Alcáyd
 of 
Tituàn

to make his address.






The Alcáydes letter from Tituán
to Colonel Norwood trans∣lated
out of Spanish.


Excellent Sir,


HIs Majestie the 
K. Muley Xerif
 my
master (whom God preserve many
years) hath sent me to this 
City
 with ex∣press
order to take Care of all Vessels of
Trade and Commerce, which shall come to
this place, & that they receive all security
& 
Royal dealing
 here, as is used in all pla∣ces
under the 
Rule
 and Government of the

King
 my 
Master.
 To this purpose he hath
granted me his 
Royal order
 to give Segu∣ros
in his Royal Name. Therefore all who
have any occasion to trafique here, may come
in safety, & be assured of good usage, both
in Goods and Persons, above all that
hath bin here formerly. This his Maje∣stie
hath commanded me to advise your

Honour,
 that you might not be ignorant
of the King's pleasure and kindness. And
if you send any to trade hither, they shall
finde no imposts, but such as are every
where usual. And if your Honour please,


we may with our 
mutual Seguros
 (or
letters of safe conduct) send men or Goods,
as occasion shall require. To this I desire
your speedy answer.




The 
Alcáyd
 from whom this came, was
a French man, 
Cidi Hadracháman Ben-Réshed,

one who had succeeded his Fa∣ther
in the Consulship of 
Tituàn,
 who
hoping to raise himself with the 
Xerif,

renounced his Christian Religion and
liberty for the 
Mahumedan Imposture
 and
servitude; and changed the gentle Name
of 
Antonie Cheysan,
 for this stubborn one

Hadracháman,
 and to encourage his 
Con∣version,

the King made him 
Alcayd de la
Mar,
 or Receiver of his 
Customes
 in the
Port of 
Tituàn,
 and also adopted him for
his Son, by the name of 
Ben-Reshed.


The Lieutenant Governour delai'd
not to answer the 
Alcáydes
 letter, as
importing Trade, the chief thing
which most concern'd the welfare of

Tanger,
 to whose advancement the
Lieutenant Governour alwayes decla∣red
a singular propensity. About the
same time 
Hamèt Ben-Isa Nacsis,
 & 
Hamèt
Ben-Abdelcrìm,
 Governours of 
Tituàn,

with other Grandees of the Country


and chief Ministers of the King sought
unto him in matters of Moment. Be∣twixt
whom and 
Gaylan
 he guided him∣self
so steddily, that the continuance of
his Friendship could not be suspected
by the one, nor want of disposition to
contract a new one by the other. 
Ta∣filete

could not so much esteem him
his enemy as 
Gaylan's Freind;
 and his fi∣delity
to a 
distressed Confederate
 removed
all suspicion of being otherwise to a

prosperous.
 And by this wise manage∣ment
he clear'd up those scruples, which
through some mishapprehensions of for∣mer
proceedings (of the Earle of 
Tiveot

above mentioned) had render'd the

Moors
 jealous of the 
English fidelity.
 But a
litle to return to 
Gaylan,
 who had by this
so long contemned the condition of his
affaires in a doubtful Style, that at length
an ambiguous intimation of his Enemies

disgrace
 was taken for a clear assertion
of his own. And however he labour'd
to beget or preserve his freinds hopes
of his Restauration, yet it could not
take with those who saw 
Taffilete

master of the whole Country, and all
places of importance replenisht with 
his


Creatures;
 and 
Gaylan
 shut up in 
Arzi∣la,

from whence he could create no
more disturbances than amounted to a
few 
plundering Sallies,
 which served on∣ly
to exasperate the adjoyning 
Cavilsas,

and totally to aliene and estrange them
from his Relief. And yet was this a
mischief which surpassed the 
Xerifs
 skill
and Power to Remedie, for 
Gaylan
 might
still have kept 
Arzila
 from him, as he
had done from 
Ben-Bowcar,
 if his ac∣complicies
had bin now as Trusty as
they were then; But he found the Scene
so far changed, that he had reason to

suspect
 those in whom he once 
confided.

He saw that the people of 
Arzila
 were
weary of their confinement, and the
more, because they could not foresee
any hope to be enlarged. And that
they could not but conclude, 
That
 their
sturdy resistance of 
Tafilete,
 contrary to
the example of all their Neighbours,
would, if protracted, render him impla∣cable.
All this 
Gaylan
 was able to read
in their 
carriage,
 wherein there appear∣ed
so great an alteration, that he clearly
perceived some mischief intended against
him, and fearing that they might appease



Tafilete
 with the Sacrifice of 
Gaylan:
 he
resolved upon a suddain removal, & ha∣ving
before dealt with the Pyrats of 
Al∣ger

for his 
Protection,
 when nither press'd
by the Enemy, nor want of Provision, he
unexpectedly shipt himself, goods and
the dearest Friends, upon two of the 
Al∣gerine
Corsaires,
 that were crusing be∣fore

Arzila;
 and presently sail'd to 
Al∣gèr,

where I leave him to be plagu'd by
that 
Medly of the worst of men,
 for his in∣gratitude
toward the Honorable 
Colo∣nel
Norwood,
 which would brand him to
man-kind, if that 
Judicious
 and 
Vigi∣lent
Governour
 would give an Account of
his 
last deportment,
 and oblige the world
with 
his Exact
 History of 
Tanger,
 since it
came into the possession of our dread
Soveraigne 
Charles
 the second whom
God Preserve.










Of West Barbary.


VVE finde a Common-wealth
compared to a ship, and the
Western part of Barbary hath
fulfilled the Allegory, not only in re∣spect
of 
the intestine
 Broyles, wherewith it
has bin so long toss'd; nor yet in regard
that the government thereof hath bin conti∣nually
floating from one faction to another.
But in this especially, that there remaines
no track, or impression, no Registers to ac∣quaint
us with what hath pass'd, except ru∣ines
and devastations, the Genuine memories
of a Desolating war. For to demand of a

Talib
 (one of the most learned sort among
the Moors) the Annals of remote vicissi∣tudes,
or an account of the Traverses that
bear a fresher date, were to baffle his obser∣vation,
and thereby affront his adored lite∣rature.


Now the likeliest reason, that can be ren∣der'd
of this ignorance, is the neglect of pre∣serving
Records of their Transactions, for


the Moores trust all to an Illiterate Tradi∣tion;
insomuch that the best Chronique can
be now compiled of their late changes, must
for the most part be collected from some a∣ged
Grandsires memory; a frail founda∣tion
to support an Historical credit.


As for the Ancient Model of the Mores∣co
Politie, it is so miserably convuls'd & sha∣ken
through manifold alterations caused by
prevailing Interests, that not many of its
first Maxims, nor much of its old Constitu∣tion,
are visible in the present state; And
this superseded my Curiosity in making re∣serches
into the Moors Politiques, further
than to be inform'd of the Methods us'd to
ascend to government by the aspiring facti∣ons
of the last Age, of which I have given
an Account in the foregoing Narrative.
And therefore without the solemnity of any
larger introduction; I shall give a faithful
Narration of the present customs of Barbary
in the succeeding Chapters.






CHAP. I.


The soile, productions, Commodities,
and Husbandry of the Coun∣trey.


LEo Afer
 delivers two Etymologies,
which are so agreable both to the
nature of the 
Language,
 and Glebe of the
Country, that they may seem to have
bin imposed by 
Adam,
 the Primitive No∣menclator.
For if we listen to the Moors
language, 
Barbary
 seems to be descended
from 
Barbar,
 which signifies an inarti∣culate
murmur and grumbling noise
without accent or harmony, for their
speech is harsh, being very guttural:
which is esteemed an argument of its
Antiquity. And indeed it hath gain'd
the vogue of no less antient a pedigree,
than to be bred of the old 
Punic
 and 
A∣rabian.


Another reason why this Country bears
the name of 
Barbary,
 may be taken from
the frame and disposition of the Earth,
which being full of wild and unkindly


Tumours, well challengeth the name of

Bar
 (a Word not known to the pre∣sent
Inhabitants) signifying a Desart,
and the duplicate of the Monosyllable

Bar-Bar
 implyeth that of old, 
Bar∣bary

was nothing but a great Solitude.
And for this derivation, 
Leo Afer
 tells
this Story: King 
Iphycus
 being driven
out of 
Aethiopia,
 fled into 
Aegypt,

where finding himself much pressed by
his Enemies, and dubious what course
to run for his safety, he asked his Ad∣herents
what they thought was the most
probable way to secure themselves;
whereupon they all, with an unexpect∣ed
consent answered 
Barbar,
 meaning
thereby that the hopefullest method of
Protection was to pass over 
Nilus
 into
the Desarts of 
Africa.
 And finding
this Etymologie to bear so fair a Pro∣portion
with the Complexion and Sur∣face
of the Land, I shall not scruple the
occasion of its Imposition.


But when we look from the outward
shape, to the Productions of the Coun∣trey,
we see the uncomeliness thereof
recompensed in the Fertility, which for∣bids
us to judge of Internal Dowries by


the outward Model: Providence usual∣ly
supplying the defects of the Body
with the abilities of the Mind, it being
the fate of many excellent Parts, like

Galba
's, to be ill lodged. The Anci∣ents
accounted Wood and Grain, the
more natural and useful Issues of a Coun∣trey,
as having a more immediate ten∣dency
to supply Mankind with the
greater Necessities of Lodging and Diet.
But in this Canton of 
Barbary,
 the
Woods are scarce and mean, and fitter
to warm the House then build it. For
ranging their Groves, I found them con∣sist
chiefly of Cork-Trees, which seem'd
to differ but little from the Scarlet-Oak,
excepting the indenture of their Leaves.
Their Fruit is a smaller kind of Acorn,
woody within: At the Root of these
Trees is usually found the 
Lentisco,

which is generally but a shrub, and of
little other service to the 
Moors
 then to
feed their Goats. The Juice whereof,
mingled with other Ingredients, is used
by the Potters to give a faint colour to
their Earthen-ware, which they find to
enhaunse the price, and advance the
sale.



The next remarkable sort of Wood is
the 
Alcaróbe,
 a Tree of great Curiosity,
and meriting a larger Note. The 
Alcaróbe

bears a Cod, in quantity▪ and likeness
much resembling the English Bean; the
inner substance thereof is sweet, and
lodgeth hard small Kernels. This Fruit
is eat by the 
Moors
 of inferior Condi∣tion,
and by all at the Feast 
Ashoràh:

but it is chiefly preserved for their Hor∣ses,
to whom it is both Physick and re∣past.
For as a 
Moor,
 well skill'd in that
Animal, told me, the Fruit of the 
Al∣caróbe

hath two excellent Properties, to
Drench, and make their Horses Fat.


Some have called the Fruit 
Locusta,

and supposed that it was the 
Baptists

Food in the Wilderness: But others con∣jecture
that St. 
Matthew
's 
, were
only the tops and extremities of Herbs
and Plants. And there are also some
judicious Criticks, who interpret the

Baptist
's Locusts to be a kind of Fly or
Grashopper, w
ch
 in warmer Climates are
very large and many, and were former∣ly
dryed and eaten by the Inhabitants.
But they were observed to yield but
small Nutriment, and ever thought fitter


for Medicine than Alimony. I was told
(but by a Travailer) that in 
Aegypt

these flyes come in such clouds, that
they darken the sky where they ap∣pear,
and that in a short space they con∣sume
the fruits of the Earth where they
are permitted to fall. To prevent which
mischief (he told me that) the people
observing the season of their coming,
prepare against them, and keeping them
from setling by discharging Gunns into
the aire where they are discover'd. That
these locusts and Grashoppers were ea∣ten
by the Barbarous Nations, may be
concluded from the Law that made them
forbidden meat to the Jews, 
Levit.
 11.
22.


But to leave the Moor to this sort of
flys, whereof he hath no scarcity, there
is a greater probability that the fruit
of the 
Alcaròbe
 is the same with the Pro∣digal's

Ceratia,
 or husks; for it doth ex∣cellently
accord with their description
set down by that great intelligence of
Divinity in his Note. 
B. S. Luke.
 XI.


In some parts of this Countrey there
is great plenty of white Mulberry trees,
nourished on purpose to feed the silk∣worm,


a creature that doth afford the
curious many delightful speculations;
but the Moor regards it only for its e∣molument.
The season of the worm be∣ing
passed, they feed their Cattel with
the residue of the Mulberry leaves.


The Towns of Commerce, and Con∣versation,
have pleasant Orchards of
Orange, Lemons and Limes, with Gar∣dens
yielding plenty and variety of sal∣lad.
And that which maketh their Gar∣dens
both profitable and delightful is,
that they are always fruitful and re∣tain
a refreshing verdure. And this they
effect by keeping the soyle constantly in
a temperate moisture: for the water-courses
are so providently contriv'd
that every Garden receiv's it in due pro∣portion,
and at a certain hour; which
running among the little trenches, af∣fords
a very equal and fertile irriga∣tion.


Besides the Sallad ordinary in other
Countreys, they have one sort rarely to
be met with in Europe, which they call
by a word, sounding spanish 
Tomátos.

This growes in the common fields, and
when ripe is pluckt and eaten with oyle▪


it is pleasant but apt to cloy. 
Barengé∣nas,

as in 
Spain,
 grow creeping like Cu∣cumers
upon the Ground; These are
boyled with Beef and Mutton, and of no
vulgar estimation among the Moors.


Some 
Cavílas
 (a division in the Coun∣trey
that much resembles that of Coun∣ties
in 
England)
 have large and fruitful
Vineyards, and the bloud of the Grape,
though it be utterly prohibited them by

Mahumed
 their Prophet, yet of late
through the licentiousness of the times,
it is liberally quaff'd by many of the
Moors. But that they might not herein
give offence to the weaker 
Musul-men,

nor betray any contempt of the law, they
are generally cautious in this liberty,
and use it, as we say, 
Ʋnder the Rose.


The Plants of this Country are very ob∣servable
for their variety and strange∣ness,
for many are to be found in 
Bar∣bary,

which cannot be met with in cold∣er
Climes. And some, which are usual
in other Countreys, are in this found to
differ much from their descriptions in
Common Herbals.
 This I learned from
a worthy Friend (well read in this part
of Nature) who had enterprised, and


would doubtless have finish'd, a Colle∣ction
of 
Barbary
 Simples, if his too early
immortality, and immature death had
not depriv'd the world of that profitable
endeavour.


The Grain in this, differs not from
that in other Countreys, excepting that
here are two sorts of Grain, scarce well
known in other parts of the world, The
one they call 
Pharoùk,
 which is of a les∣ser
size, hungry and course, much re∣sembling,
if not altogether the same,
with the Spanish 
Panizo,
 and it is only
the more beggarly Moors that use this
for bread. The other is known among
them by the name of 
Tourkiá,
 which is
a larger body than the former, and yields
good flower, whereof bread is made
for the Nobles of the Land. And as the
Barley and Beans are reapt in April,
the wheat in May and June, so is Sep∣tember
the usual season for gathering
the other kinds of bread-corn.


The rains are to the Moors, what the
Nilescope is said to be to the 
Aegyptians,

for according to their plenty or scarce∣ness,
they are able to foretell the dearth
and plenty of the year. But there is a


sort of Religionists among them, who
measure the products of the earth by the
sins of its Inhabitants, and who divine
of the successe of their tillage from the
Observation of their 
Ramadan
 (or
Lent) and the due celebrating of their
[Easter] 
Hìd Seguèr,
 or the little feast
that concludes it.


If the clouds are sparing in showers at

Seed-time,
 and Earing, the crop is lit∣tle
lean; and in their best Harvests,
they seldom reap more than will bring
about the year, so that the failure of
one Crop brings an inevitable dearth
upon the land. The Moors are very obser∣ving
of the 
Trade-rains,
 (for so they may
not improperly be termed, as never fal∣ling
but at such a time) The former Rain
is call'd by a word importing Blessing,
and the latter 
[Nas
n]
 or 
Holy-water,

of which names I could meet with no o∣ther
Rationale but Tradition.


There appeares but little industry in
the Moors husbandry, for their tillage
is so mean, that he that sees it may just∣ly
wonder, that the Land under such
small improvement should be so fruit∣ful.
In most parts they plough but with


two Oxen, carelesly tyed by the horns,
and in some 
Cavílas
 with a like number
of Asses, Mules, Camels, and a baser
breed of Horses. The plough turns up
no more mold, than sufficeth to bury
the seed: for (say they) if the fur∣rows
should be deep, and the drought
begin, er'e that the corn hath broken the
Earth, it would not be able to force a
passage through the stifned clods. They
use no labour to assist the 
Arbale
 by ma∣nuring
it, except that the Ordure of
their Towns is cast out, not so much to
enrich the Glebe, as to keep themselves
cleanly. But this painful part of hus∣bandry
is supplyed by the Anniversary
burning of the withered grass and stu∣ble,
which servs to help the soyle, and
destroy the Vermin, which otherwise,
especially the Scorpion, would render
the Countrey very dangerous for habi∣tation.


When the Moors have reapt their corn,
they tread it out with Oxen, Camels, &c,
& winnow it upon the place where it
grows, and then set the chaff on fire; In
which particulars they are an excellent
Comment upon the like, reflected upon


in 
Sacred Writ.
 Instead of Granaries,
they have Caves brick'd or wrought with
stone, call'd 
Matamóras,
 in which they
reposite their Corn, where it is preserv'd
from the Worm, and other Enemies.
The Straw they chop and keep for their
H
rses, for although there be abundance
of Herbage, yet no part thereof is cured
and preserved for a Winter store of Hay,
which I impute to the 
Moors
 sloth, ra∣ther
than the needlesness of such a Pro∣vision.


After I had taken this Survey of what
appeared upon the Earth by Nature, or
its Improver, Husbandry, I found suf∣ficient
Instigations, both by Curiosity
and Reason, to dive into its Entrals,
which I have been told are in many pla∣ces
as rich as the best Oars can make
them. And of this Truth there have
appeared large Specimens, about 
Tituan,
Alcazàr, Ghebèr, &c.
 And the reason
why the 
Moors
 pursue not so advantage∣ous
a Temptation, may be charg'd upon
their Ignorance, Idleness, or Fear; as
in another place I may have occasion to
demonstrate. The Commodities of this
Countrey bearing the name of 
Mercán∣til,



are chiefly Honey, Wax, Hides, Ma∣rokins
or Córdavans, Dates, Almonds;
course Twine, Mats of a curious Straw
and Workmanship, Mantles, Alheìcks,
and in some places great store of Salt-Peter.
As for the Fabulous abundance
of Gold reported to be found in 
Barba∣ry,

I leave its Legend to the Poets.






CHAP. II.


Of the Beasts in Barbary, tame
and wild.


THe Survey now passeth one Stair
higher, from Vegetable to Sensible
Creatures, whereof 
Barbary
 has no less
plenty, than of Grass to maintain them,
but looking into their Flocks and Herds,
I found the latter more numerous, yet
not to that quantity as report inform'd
me. And enquiring why the 
Moors
 were
more for the Stall, than the Fold; they
replyed, That Cows yielded them more
constant relief than Sheep, and were
more ready to furnish out both their Ta∣bles


and Purses. Their Horses are both
few and mean, and for the most part
much inferiour to those of other Nati∣ons,
which at first created my wonder,
because of the great repute the 
Barbary

Horses had obtain'd in most 
European

Countries. But they have a peculiar
Cast of Barbs able to maintain this Re∣nown,
which the 
Moors
 carefully pre∣serve,
never imploying them in low and
base Offices, but keep them only for the
Saddle and Military Service. And to the
great ease of their Horses, the 
Moors

have store of Camels for their sorest
Drudgeries. Now the Camel is a Crea∣ture
of strange Bulk and humour, whose
Diet is mean and incredibly little, for
they will Travel great Journeys under
heavy Loads, without further allowance
than the tops of Thistles, or any mean
Herbage. Nor are they less abstemious
in their Bevarage, than Meat; being so
patient of Thirst, that they will Travel
four days without touching Water, and
then at one Drinking take in as much as
will serve them as many Days more. The

Moor
 from Observation hath this gene∣ral
Rule concerning Camels; 
viz. That


those which when young drink much and
often, are of a degenerate Linage, and
will never prove serviceable.


There is a Presumption, that the Ca∣mels
engender backward, but 
Ali Mulùd,

an Ancient and Inquisitive 
Moor,
 would
often swear by the Hairs of his Chin (an
Oath that he had learn'd in the time of
his being a Slave in 
Spain)
 that he had
much enquired after the manner of the
Camels Copulation, but could meet
with no certain Information therein;
for (said he) these Creatures are strange∣ly
bashful in their Embraces, which
makes them very secret in the time of
their Amours; and to retire, if possible,
even from their Keepers Eye. At the
season of their Coition, both Sexes are
very furious, and like their 
Moresco
 Ma∣sters,
they never forget to revenge the
Injuries done them at that time. I was
told by an 
Alarb,
 who had no Tempta∣tion
to abuse my Credulity in such an
unconcerning Story, that the 
Mácho,
 or
Male Camel, generated with the Female
when she is asleep, and that the Female
brings forth in a kind of negligent slum∣ber.
But I leave the curious Inquisitors


of Nature to discover the frailties of this
Story, and pass on to remark the docile
gentleness of the Camel, which is evi∣dent
in their submission, kneeling to be
loaden and unloaden at their Drivers
pleasure. And we find it reported in the
History of Beasts, 
Jonson. Hist. Quadrup.

That Camels have been taught to dance
exact Measures, which is no more strange,
than the 
Ballétto di Caválli,
 that not long
since graced the Nuptials of a Duke of

Florence.


But intending no 
Zoography,
 I pass
from this and other Tame Quadrupeds,
to observe that 
Barbary
 hath all sorts
of Beasts that are called Wild: Lions,
Leopards, Wolves, Foxes, 
&c
 with
great plenty of Jackals, so much famed
for Catoring for the Lyon: They usu∣ally
hunt in Packs, opening with a shril
yelping noise, and are described to be
Mungrel Creatures, of an equivocal
Generation, deriving rapaciousness from
the Wolf their Sire, and cunning from
the Fox their Dam; they are very ra∣venous,
eating Carrion, digging up dead
Bodies, and will feed upon that which a
genuine Fox will not daign to tast.



Wild Boars are no rarity in this 
Dio∣cess,

which the 
Moors
 hunt and kill in a
Manly Pastime, they being no way sub∣servient
to the Trencher, because all
sorts of Swines Flesh is forbidden Meat
by their Law. But their Slaves, that are
Christians, have permission to dress and
eat them, and know from Experience
that they are very wholesom and strong
Food.


But I shall surcease to Travel further
among these inhospitable Salvages, with
whose descriptions Natural Histories are
so largely replenished, and therefore I
will shut up this Chapter with this gene∣ral
Remark, 
That
 Barbary 
hath variety
of all sorts of Beasts, Birds and Serpents;
the Land affording Habitations most suit∣able
to such unsociable Beings.








CHAP. III.


The Division of the Inhabitants,
different manner of living, their
Genius, their entertainment of
Foreign Ministers.


THe Family of 
Noah
 (saith the Jewish
Antiquary 
Flav. Joseph.)
 being
jealous of a second Deluge, durst not
descend to Cultivate the Plains, but
dwelt upon the tallest Mountains: till
at length, 
Sem
 ventured to Inhabit the
Valleys; where they lived in a Cluster,
and seemed suspicious of the Divine
Command, bidding them 
disperse and
over-spread the Earth:
 fearing that this
might be a Design to scatter them that
they might the more easily be destroyed,
for which reason they long time kept to∣gether
in a close Neighborhood. Out
of which story nothing is needful here
to be collected, but that Mountains have
ever proved the Refuges of the Distres∣sed,
and the People that Inhabited them


valued for their Antiquity above the rest
of the Land. Of which truth, 
Barba∣ry

yields a pregnant instance in the divi∣sion
of her Inhabitants, of which there
are two sorts known among them, by the
usual Names of 
Alárbes
 and 
Barabárs.


The 
Alárbes
 are usually by the 
Euro∣peans

stil'd Mountaineers, from the place
of their greatest residence. And these
think themselves the Elder Natives, and
therefore of the better House. They
are not altogether so Civiliz'd as the o∣ther,
but live more rudely and rovingly,
shifting from Mountain to Mountain ac∣cording
to their Exigences, never con∣fining
their rambling humors to any set∣led
Mansion. They live in Haimas or
Tents, made of a course brownish Cloth,
which the Women work and weave of the
Bark of Palmito's mingled with Goats
hair; and these Itinerary Habitations
they remove from one place to another,
in obedience to their fickle Humors and
cogent Necessities. Robbery is their
Master-piece and best Livelyhood; and
in this Estate they much glory, as coming
so near the condition of 
Muley Mahu∣méds

first Votaries. About an Age past


they were very numerous, but the late
Civil Wars have made great abatements
of their Musters.


The other sort of 
Moors
 are vulgarly
called 
Barabàrs,
 but by a Dialect 
Bré∣bers:

These have fixed Dwellings, and
live in Neighborhood; and finding Con∣versation
to be useful and safe, affording
Comfort and Profit, they are combin'd
into 
Aldéa
's, or Villages, where their
Cottages are so disposed, that there is
not any considerable disproportion a∣mong
them in respect of their distance
from the 
Giemma,
 or Church.


Over these 
Barabàrs
 are Subordinate
Governors or 
Almocadens,
 to whom
they pay a dutiful Observance. Their
Vocation is Tillage and Grazing; and
live much after the condition of the 
La∣baradóres

in 
Spain,
 the Paisants in

France,
 and the Boors in 
Flanders.
 The

Barabàrs
 of late are grown more nume∣rous
than the 
Alárbes,
 and for several
Years have inhabited both the Moun∣tains
and Campaigns. But albeit they
have taken the Hills from the 
Alárbes,

yet they have left them the reproach of
Robbery, though they themselves are no
Novices in that Mystery.



But notwithstanding their different
Mode of living, they unite in the gene∣ral
Character of Body and Humour: For
they are all of a large Stature, strong
Constitution, stately Carriage, and dif∣fering
in Complexion according to their
conversing with the Sun and Air. Those
whom for distinction I must call the
Gentry, are according to their Rules of
Chivalry well skill'd in managing of the
Horse, and dextrous at the Lance, for
they scorn all toyl that is not Military,
and account no Employment so noble as
that of a Souldier. They agree like∣wise
in Humour, for both are Jealous
and Revengeful. Their Jealousie is pal∣pable
in their Carriage towards their
Wives, whom they keep in great Subje∣ction
and Retirement, which makes A∣dultery
a Stranger to their Beds: Nor
can it reasonably be otherwise, seeing
that the Wife is fully assur'd that the ve∣ry
attempt to pilfer a Pleasure, if dis∣cover'd,
will cost her her Life. They
are likewise implacable in their hatred,
and impatient till they have avenged an
Injury; for they are taught by their Pro∣phet,

That Revenge is a Virtue.
 But


leaving these Passions to the justification
of the 
Moresco
 Law and Customs, the

Moors
 are guilty of a censorious Suspi∣cion
towards Strangers, which hath no
colour to be excused. This I first ob∣served
in their carriage toward 
Don Die∣go
de Palma,
 a Cavalier of the Habit of
St. 
James,
 who being sent to Comple∣ment

Gaylan
 from his 
Catholick Majesty,

and chanceing to smile at the 
Moors
 De∣portment,
as not answering the starch'd∣ness
of his own Nation; the 
Moors,
 who
were very circumspect in observing eve∣ry
tittle of the 
Don
's Deportment, were
so sagacious as to find in this casual Smile
a derision of their Courtship, which they
left not unrevenged in intrigueing his
Errand. Now it is observable, that the

Moors
 are very morose and abstemious
in point of Laughter, esteeming those
who are much thereunto addicted, to be
scornful and foolish.


And now having promised to give an
account of the 
Moresco
 manner of re∣ceiving
Publick Ministers, and finding
that they have no solemn & fixed Rites;
I conceive the description of their en∣tertaining
the 
Spanish
 Envoy, may serve


for a Specimen of their Carriage toward
all Persons of the like Character: which
take as follows.


The Envoy 
Don Diego Felippe de Pal∣ma,

having from 
Ceuta
 (a 
Spanish
 Gari∣son
on the 
Barbary
-coast) advised 
Cidi el
Hader Ben Ali Gaylan,
 that he was come
from the Crown of 
Spain
 on a Message
to his Excellency (that was 
Gaylans
 Ti∣tle)
and desired to know when and
where he should have permission and se∣curity
to deliver it: 
Gaylan
 returned
him answer, concerning the set Day and
Place for the 
Don
's Reception, which
was according to our stile, the tenth of

September,
 in the One thousand six hun∣dred
sixty third Year of Grace, and at a
place equally distant from 
Ceuta
 and 
Ti∣tuan:

where, to grace the 
Entrata, Gay∣lan

appointed a Parade of the best Horse
of his own 
Cavíla,
 and committed them
to the Conduct of his Brother 
Cidi Tobib
Ebn Ali,
 who march'd with them from

Arzíla
 to 
Tituàn,
 whither according to
appointment, 
Gaylans
 Father-in-law,

Almocadèm
 of the 
Cavíla
 of 
Angerà,
 had
sent his Sons with about sixty of their
Cousens, to joyn with 
Tobib,
 who with


many more went to receive the Envoy at
the prefixed time and place: Where the

Moors,
 having paid him their Greetings,
they all March'd in this order.


In the first Troop came the two Sons
of the 
Almocadèm
 of 
Angerà,
 with about
sixty of their Kindred, all bravely mount∣ed,
and according to their Gallantry,
richly accoutred: These in several Rings
exercis'd the Lance with laudable Agi∣lity,
the Musick of 
Tituàn
 still playing
before them.


In the next rank came 
Cidi Tobit,
 at∣tended
with about fifty Horse, maintain∣ing
a very slow march, as if they intend∣ed
to revie or deride the Spanish Gravi∣ty.
Next to them rode the Envoy, 
Don
Diego Felippe de Palma del Habito de San∣jago,

with a single Trumpet sounding be∣fore
him: Next came led six stately Hor∣ses
trapt in blew Cloth: after them four∣teen
Mules loaden with Trunks; and in
the last place rode the Governor of 
Ti∣tuàn,

with the 
Alárbes
 Musick tinkling
before him, and attended with a large &
well ordered Train. Vast multitudes
were flockt thither, having no other bu∣siness
but to gaze, being Strangers to such
a Procession.



In this order was 
Don Diego
 conduct∣ed
to his Lodgings in 
Tituàn,
 where he
courteously received the Christians that
came to give him the Parabien to 
Barba∣ry,

and declar'd a great readiness to
serve my Camrade and my self, whom he
knew had no other concern in those
Parts, but securely to travel and view
the Countrey. After two days refresh∣ment
at the 
Moors
 charge, the 
Don
 be∣gan
his march toward 
Arzíla,
 but first
caused the Horses to be richly trapt, and
led in State through the Streets of 
Titu∣àn;

which being done, they came into
a Plain a little out of the Town, where
the People made a spacious Circle, in
which the 
Moresco
 Cavalleres shewed
their active Horsemanship, and dexte∣rous
darting of the Lance; after which,
about fifty 
Negros
 and 
Alárbes
 began a
Dance, which they performed with plea∣sant
variety of Gesture, and strange A∣gility.


These Desports being finished, the
Envoy advanceth his Journey, and found
the ways crowded with Spectators, invi∣ted
thither by 
Gaylan
's Politick Friends,
who designed that the People might take


notice of the Honor done to 
Cidi El Ha∣der,

and that his Friendship was sought
by one of the greatest of Christian Mo∣narchs.
But there were many that came
not so much to be Spectators, as to reap
the fruit of a common Report, that the

Don
 would cast great store of Realito's
among the poorer 
Moors.
 But their hopes
were deceived in the rumour of the 
Spa∣niards

Bounty, who did not herein de∣generate
from the Nature of his Nation,
which has ever been noted for a back∣wardness
to such insignificant Profusi∣ons.
The Envoy being safely arrived at

Arzíla,
 he was lodged in an Apartment
of 
Gaylan
's Place (pardon the Word)
where I leave him to lodge, and eat, if
possible, worse then he did at home.


The business and design of this Em∣bassy,
met with diversity of Conjectures:
by some it was supposed that 
Don Diego

was sent to sollicit larger Priviledges for
the 
Spanish
 Garrisons on the 
Barbarian

Coast. Others concluded that the Duke
of 
Medina Celi,
 envious at the Earl of

Tiveot
's successes against the 
Moors,
 and
his Truce concluded with 
Gaylan,
 caused
this Messenger (a Creature of his own)


to be sent with Instructions, to interrupt
and disturb the new Correspondence
and Amity betwixt 
Tanger
 and 
El Hader.

But to find out the Riddle, I ploughed
with one of their own Heifers, having
employed a 
Moor
 versed in publick Af∣fairs,
(and recommended to me by that
great Lover of the English, 
Cidi Abdel∣erim
Nacsis,
 then chief Governor of 
Ti∣tuan)

who from the 
Spaniard
's inquisi∣tiveness
after the state and condition of

Tanger,
 the number of the Souldiers,
the quantity of the constant Guards, the
heighth and strength of the Walls, the
situation and number of the Guns ready
mounted, 
&c.
 with his Design in a 
Mo∣resco

habit to take a narrow view of the
whole place (which in 
Gaylan
's company
within few days after he performed) fil∣led
us with Jealousies that some mischief
was purposed against 
Tanger.
 And it is
very certain, That the fore-mentioned
Duke had an evil Eye upon the Immortal

Tiveot,
 for the Renowned Victories
which under the most Christian King he
atchieved against his Nations Interest in
the 
Low Countries,
 which aged Choler
he found highly inflam'd by the Victories


gain'd by that 
indefatigable Captain
 over
his 
Moresco
 Neighbors, which instigated
the Dukes spleen not so much against

Tanger,
 as its Restorer 
Tiveot,
 who be∣ing
at this time in 
England,
 took the ad∣vantage
of his absence to disgrace him
(if any such thing had been possible) with
his new Confederate 
Gaylan.
 And ac∣quiescing
in this account of the Embassy,
I pursue my Province in setting down the
exact account of the present Customs
of the 
Moors.






CHAP. IV.


The Moresco Compellations, Re∣verence
to Superiors, Complexi∣on
and Conversation of the
Women, pious manner of saluta∣tion
and Stile.


I Have not found any Nation so rude
and Barbarous, as to be utterly de∣void
of all 
Rites
 of Civility and Respect:


for some tokens of honor & kindness, some
terms of distance & familiarity are used
by the most uncultivated. And the Moors
though they are very sparing in Comple∣ments,
yet they use both words & gestures
of Respect. Towards all superiours they
indifferently use the Compellative 
Cidi,

which is as extensive as [Sir;] To wo∣men
of better quality they use 
Lala,
 sig∣nifying
as largely as 
Madam
 doth now
in 
England.
 And as to their outward
demonstrations of Respect, there is little
variation; for a grave inclination of the
body, with a putting the right hand first
to the heart, next to the forehead, and
then kissing the two foremost fingers laid
a cross the lips, is the exactest manner
of saluteing the Grandees; whose hand,
knee, or bottome of the Vest is kissed
by the Vulgar. Those that are familiar,
and of equal rank, at their first meeting
strike hands, but shake not, & then lift
them up & lay them to their breasts. And
their greetings are in the second person
singular, useing [Thou] to all from the
slave to the King: wherein they observe
the Eastern Custom. But in their addres∣ses
to their Prince no people can testify


more signal tokens of Humbleness & Pi∣ety,
for at the entrance into the Royal
presence, they bow their bodies to the
ground, saying, 
Sálam Allíg Allá En∣sorúck
Mulèy,
 Peace be to thee, God
preserve King 
Fuláno;
 & these words &
gestures are devoutly repeated at every
pace they advance toward the 
King.
 And
if any come with petitions they kisse, the
earth when they present them to his roy∣al
perusal. The like Reverences are dis∣charged
when they depart the 
Presence.

But I pass on to view the female Moors,
who if preserv'd from the injuries of the
Sun & weather, are generally well comple∣xion'd
full bodied, & of good symmetry.
Those that live in great Towns, together
with the wealthier sort in the Country,
are enclin'd to paleness, which may be
imputed to their sedentariness, or 
want
of motion;
 for they seldom stir abroad, ex∣cept
it be to visit the Sepulchers of
their deceased friends in devotion, to
pray for their felicity, and in the night
time to the Baths for health and cleanli∣ness.
As to their Friday-meetings I shall
speak of it in another Chapter. They
never step without the threshold but so


closely vail'd, that no part is visible but
an eye. In the state of Matrimony their
principal studie is to please their hus∣bands,
to whom they are taught by their

Alcoran
 to bear a dutiful observancy, and
to omit no art that may render them de∣lightful
to their conversation. Those hus∣bands
that are able, allow their wives 
Ne∣gra
's
or 
black-women,
 to doe all the ser∣vile
offices in the Family; but yet there is
no quality that sits idle; for the cheif of
the 
Moresco
 Dames imploy their time in
some thrifty huswifry. And this pre∣vents
that custom of 
expensive gossippings,

with which in some 
Nations
 so many
wives are debauched, and husbands 
beg∣gar'd.

And yet the married women want
not their 
friendly conversations,
 for they
visit one anothers houses in token of
good 
neighbourhood,
 but without the com∣pany
of their husbands; no male though
he be never so much a relative, can be ad∣mitted
into their society. And to prevent
it, she that makes the visit first, sends to
know whether the husband be at home
if the answer be negative, then without
further ceremony she goes straight to her
Gossips apartment, where she is enter∣tain'd


with a liberality that never injures
her husband; who if returning home in
the interim of the visit, is careful to give
no interruption, but upon notice quickly
departs the house; yet they give such
signals that he has bin there, as are easily
perceived by the 
Visitant,
 who thereupon
shortens the Visit, otherwise it common∣ly
lasts a whole day. But these being
offices that are seldome in their returns,
may justly be pardon'd in their length.


But foreseeing that I shall in another
place have occasion to speak again of the

Moresco
 women, I surcease to enlarge
the paragraph that here concerns them,
aud therefore proceed to view the 
pious
forms
 used by the Moors in their saluta∣tions
and Letters.


And indeed there is none that has had
any intimacy with the Moors in this
particular, but he might observe a great
appearance of Piety in all their custo∣mary
expressions. And this I learn'd
both from the discourse and practise of
those with whom I journy'd, who at
their setting out in the morning, would
with zeal and humility look up to hea∣ven,
and in a low voice say, 
Bismillah,



that is, in the name of God; which is al∣so
done at the beginning of any labour
or travail. By which they intend that
nothing ought to be enterprised, but in
the power and hope of the divine favour
and help. And when the work or jour∣ney
is finished they say, 
Ham der illah,

Thanks be unto God; in which words
they deny all ascriptions of success to
themselves. When they meet one ano∣ther
upon the road, &c. their greetings
at large is this thanksgiving, 
El ham dil∣lah
al salam tiqsi.
 i. e. God be praised
that I see thee well: but in passing by one
another the Salutation is usually this
prayer, if there be no more but one,

Salam alleq,
 if more than one, 
Salam al∣leq
cum,
 Peace be with thee, or you.
At the hearing of one another sneez,
they say, 
Era hanig allah, Dios tenga
V. M. en sumano.
 God be your keeper.
When one Moor goes to see another at
his house, the first that receives him saith,

Mar bába,
 or welcom, which if repeated
thrice, is an undoubted marke that they
are glad to see him; which kind re∣ception
he requites with saying,

Allah ellah miq
 i. e. God pay▪ you.


And the like air and genius of Devoti∣on
and Piety is observable in those let∣ters
that the Moors write in their own
language; a tast whereof you have in
these two ensuing, translated out of 
Mo∣resco.




In the name of God Gracious &
Merciful, whose Blessing be
upon our Lord Ma∣homed
& his Fa∣mily.
To the Mighty, honourable, Glo∣rious,
and most Excellent Lord
and Governour of Tanger the
Earle Tiveot.


GOd perpetuate your Excellencies Ho∣nour
and Glory, and vouchsafe your
perseverance in Grandeur and Felicity.
Happiness unto you with the odours of a
glorious Name, shall continually breath
out their fragrancies, and let God con∣tinue
and prosper both you and your estate


agreable to your wishes.


Furthermore, to advise us of your a∣bundant
love, and especially generosity,
there came to us the worthy Gentlemen
your servants in their 
Ship,
 with the
honourable Commanders of it, the Con∣sul
and the Captain, and they behaved
themselves amongst us 
like Men,
 touching
your Command which they observed, and
accomplished our desires according as we
expected in the going forth of our men,
they returning home to us in health and
safety, so that we now reenjoy their com∣pany
according to the best of our wishes.
And let God in our stead largly reward
and recompence you, who have so highly
obliged us herein.


Your Messengers staid with us for some
days, till we had performed some of their
desires, so that we sent along with them
two excellent horses and of the best sort
that hath been in our time, one whereof
was for our own Riding, and the other is of
the same breed; likewise forty good choise
beasts, both Bulls and Cows, and a flock
of about fourscore sheep, as a present to
your Excellency, which out of your Grace

nd favour, you would vouchsafe to ac∣cept


from us. For the deserts and Me∣rits
of your Honour, God alone can recom∣pence.


We gave also to your 
Legates
 two spe∣cial
horses and a few Cattle as the time
permitted, and they likewise bought some
horses as the time served, and then de∣parted
from us well contented. But we
are alwaies with you in that inviolable love
and friendship, which neither distance of
place, nor length of time shall ever dis∣solve.
And as for our Country 
Barbary
(blessed be God)
 all of it that is 
loyal

and in 
obedience
 to us, whether Moun∣taines,
Plaines, or Citiès, you have free
passage into in love and friendship, to
converse and trade as you please, and to
manage all your affaires. And this
will be of great advantage unto us, if it
please 
God
 we live, and the General take
the Castle of the Port Town, and thè Reb∣bels
return wholy to their obedience, and
then you shall not apologise for us, or ex∣cuse
us in any service we can doe you. But
we request you to excuse us at present, as to
the rest of your desires, being assured that
we cease not to encounter and fight those
enemies which have broken Covenant with


us, that so they may shortly (if God
please) return to their Allegiance.


And we intreat you to graunt our Ser∣vants,
the Inhabitants of the Port, your
best assistance in what ever they shall have
need of your help and supply. And what∣soever
of our 
Consorts
 shall come to you,
we beseech you not to be wanting in your
Care towards them.


But the most earnest and important bu∣siness
which concerns us to mention to you is,
for a great ship to lye at the 
Port
 betweeen
us and the enemy, on purpose to cut off all re∣lief
by shipping from the Enemie, and pray
let it be hastened with its fraught, pro∣vision
and all other necessaries. This is
our chief business which we entreat you
to accomplish, according to our desires.
And any of the Ships that shall come to
this Port, shall drive away whatsoever
Merchant ships they find there, and seise
their goods. For the only thing we are
wanting in, and in need of assistance, is this
business of the Merchants. Thus we have
given you the full of our desires in what
we have written. And let God accom∣plish
all your desires. Farewell,


Written 
the third day of the week be∣ing


the twenty fifth of the month 
Dul∣hevil

the last month of the 1073. year
of the 
Hegira.

Another Letter.


IN the name of God the Greatest of all
Great ones, whom we worship and serve
and none other.

 Cap∣tain
General of 
Tanger,

much.



We receiv'd the Servants of your Ex∣cellency

CHAP. V.


The Moresco Entertainment, fashi∣on
of Travelling, Hospitals,
Diet, Reverence to Corn, for∣bidden
Meats.


IN the Year of Salvation, 1663. 
Sept.

the sixth, at the going down of the
Sun, we came to an 
Aldéa
 called 
Angerà,

at the utmost Bounds of a Mountain of
that name; where we repair'd to the
House of 
Cidi Cassian Shat,
 whom we
found sitting at his Door, environ'd with
about twenty aged 
Moors
 of the Neigh∣borhood.
Alighting from our Horses,
we deliver'd our 
Segúra
 or Letters of
safe Conduct, to the Old Man; who
when he had perused, return'd them
with a grave Nod, the testimony of his
Approbation, and the signal of our Wel∣come.
This done, we were called to a
little upper Room, which we could not
enter till we had put off our Shoos at
the Threshold; not for Religion, but


Cleanliness, and not to prevent our un∣hallowing
of the Floor, but defiling the
Carpets wherewith it was curiously
spread. At the upper end of the Room
was laid a Velvit Cushion, as large as
those we use in our Pulpits, and it deno∣ted
the most Honourable part of the
Room. After we had reposed about an
hour, there was brought in a little oval
Table, about twenty Inches high, which
was covered with a long piece of narrow
Linnen; and this served for Diaper. For
the 
Moors,
 by their Law, are forbidden
such superfluous Utensils as Napkins,
Knives, Spoons, 
&c.
 Their Religion lay∣ing
down this general Maxim, 
That meer
Necessaries are to be provided for:
 which
caused a precise 
Moor
 to refuse to drink
out of my Dish, when he could sup Wa∣ter
enough out of the hollow of his
Hand. But this straitness has of late
Years begun to be enlarged, and the pro∣hibition
is interpreted to reach no far∣ther
then their Church-men, and chief
Ministers of Justice; so that those who
are able to provide handsome Furniture
for their Tables, have a Dispensation,
which they seem not prone to make use


of, if the humour of the rest may be de∣vined
by that of this Grandee: At whose
House the Table was adorned as before,
and for Supper there was placed upon
it an Earthen Pot full of Mutton, Beef,
Cabage, Raisins, Potato's, Berengénas,

&c.
 all boyled together, and extream∣ly
hot with Dimicuto and Garlick, which
is their immutable Sawce. This hodge∣podge
was in imitation of the 
Spanish
Olla Podrida,
 excepting that it wanted
Bacon, an Ingredient so indispensible
to the 
Spanish Olla,
 that there can be
none without it, which occasion'd this
Proverb, 
No Sermon without St.
 Austin,

nor
 Olla 
without Bacon: Ny Sermòn sin

Agostino, 
ny
 Olla 
sin locino.
 But to pro∣ceed
in our Bill of Fare: our next Course
was a single Pullet cloven down the Bel∣ly,
with the four Quarters spread out at
large, by a way of Cookery peculiar to
the 
Moors.
 And these two Dishes, with
store of good Bread, made up the Feast.
Our Drink was strong Wine newly
brought from the Press, which stood by
us in a great stone Jar, with a sort of
wooden Ladle in it, out of which we
drunk. Our posture was laying round


about the Table, according to the cu∣stom
of the Countrey. Our company was
the second Son of this Family, a debo∣nair
Gentile Person. Having supp'd,
and solaced our selves with muddy Be∣verage
and 
Moresco
 Music, we all compo∣sed
our selves to sleep: About twenty
were allotted to Lodge in this small
Chamber, whereof two were Christians,
three Jews, and the rest 
Moors:
 every
one made his Bed of what he wore, which
made our 
English
 Constitutions to wish
for the Morning, which no sooner ap∣peared
but we quitted our Lodging, lea∣ving
our Entertainer 
sans adieu,
 not tar∣rying
to return thanks for his Hospitali∣ty;
which could incur no displeasure, as
conforming to the stile of the Countrey.
And this Breviate of 
Cidi Cassian
's hospi∣table
House-keeping, is an Essay of the
rest, for the 
Moors
 have all one fashion of
living, and their Houses, Diet, and Ap∣parel
vary not, but in the matter.


Now that which makes Journying in

Barbary
 so full of Fatigue, is the want
of Houses of Publick Entertainment
(like the 
Venta
's and 
Posáda
's in 
Spain;

the 
Caborets
 and 
Hostelries
 in 
France;



and Inns in 
England)
 whereby the Tra∣vellers
are constrain'd to carry their Pro∣visions
with them. The 
Moors
 usual Vi∣aticum
are Raisins, parch'd Beans, Ony∣ons,
Garlick, and store of Bread. They
rely upon the Fountains for their Drink,
which are kept in great decency and
cleanlyness: at every Fountain there be∣ing
a Dish made of Cork, fastned with a
string, out of which Man and Beast drink
for refreshment. Many of these Foun∣tains
are provided with a large smooth
Stone, whereon the 
Moor,
 after he has
perform'd his preparative Washing, ce∣lebrates
his 
Salla,
 or Orisons. And the

Bigots
 that live near these Fountains, e∣very
day repair thither to pay their 
Bi∣gotage,

or Superstitious Devotions.


They usually shut up their Journey at
the going down of the Sun; and if there
be an 
Aldéa
 or Village at hand, they turn
thither for House-room, and lodge com∣monly
in a Cotage, as mean as that
wherein 
Ovid
's aged Couple entertain'd
the Pilgrim Gods. But if it be Summer,
or the Weather fair, then they repair to
some shady Tree, under whose prote∣
tion
they sleep and eat. If the place










be suspected for bad Neighbors, the Tra∣vellers
watch by turns, and do the like
in places that are troubled with wild
Beasts.


When I said that the 
Moors
 have no
Houses of Accommodation, it was with
exception of the 
Almamóra
's, or Cham∣bers
maintain'd by the Revenues of the
Church, built on purpose to receive
Strangers of any Perswasion. These
Houses afford nothing but room to Lodge
in; but if it happen that Travellers are
in want of meat, the Villagers are ready
to supply them. The 
Alfaqúi,
 or Priest
of the place, hath Inspection and Super∣intendency
of these Hospitals. The

Moors
 have likewise peculiar Places, re∣sembling
the Infirmatories or 
Lazaret∣to
's
in other Nations, for those that fall
sick in their Journeys, whom they treat
with a laudable Care, till they either re∣cover
or dye: And if the infirm dye, not
leaving wherewith to bury him, there is
care taken for his Funeral, and a 
Mu∣láto,

or some baser 
Moor,
 is appointed
to beg the Alms of the place to defray
the Expence of the Strangers Interment.
In these 
Almamóra
's, the Stranger is per∣mitted


to stay till the Weather and his
Health dispose him for his Journey: but
they repine at his abode, when it is not
urged by necessity.


In later Years, every Town of Tras∣fick
hath erected a sort of Inns, called

Alfandách,
 which affords nothing but
House-room for Man and Beast, the Mar∣ket
yielding Provision for both. Those
that farm these 
Fandáchs,
 cannot exact
above a Blankil a Night both for Man and
Beast, which is in sterling Money about
two pence. The Horses Lodging costing
equally with his Riders.


These 
Fandáchs
 were at first built by
the wealthier sort of 
Moors,
 who dying
in a pious humour, gave them to the 
Gi∣ámma

or Church, to hallow, say the 
Mo∣resco

Rabbies, the filthy lucre raised by
their employment. However, the 
Gi∣ámma

has its Revenues greatly augment∣ed
by such Donations. And whatever
was the Design of their Institution, we
find them of late under a great Degene∣racy,
being little better then Tipling
Shops, where the 
Moors
 Quaff the Fruit
of the Vine. But that which herein most
raised my Admiration, was to see the In∣comes


of these 
Fandáchs,
 appropriated
to the maintenance of the 
Alfaqúi
's or
Priests, and that that Holy Order, ha∣ving
the disposal of such Houses, should
not see them under a more regular admi∣nistration.


But to go from these Publick Houses
to view the 
Moors
 in their private Roofs,
I find them in their Caresses frugal, with∣out
Parsimoniousness, and placing no
Character of good House-keeping in a∣bundance
of Viands. They have two
dishes in singular esteem, the chief where∣of

nscussòn,
 which is made of Water
and Flower, or grated Bread, boyled
into a Consistence, into which they put
Butter, or any Kitchin-stuff: And this
they eat without Spoons; for when it is
ready, every one that is admitted to taste
it, dives into it with his hand, and dance∣ing
it in his Fist, till it be shap'd into a
Ball and cool'd, then casts it into his
Mouth. The other dish is known by the
name of 
Pillów,
 vulgarly pronounced

Pl
w,
 and it is the same with that which
I said has so near a resemblance with the
Spanish 
Olla Podrida.
 Besides these two
Dishes, the 
Moors
 of a better allay make


their Breakfasts of 
Bonuélo
's, or small
Loaves boyled in Oyl, which they eat
with Sugar, or Honey.


The Countrey 
Moors
 feed much on
Milk, which they are by their Law for∣bidden
to taste, if it has been touch'd
by a Dog. They have store of Cheese,
but very course and homely. And as for
their Butter, we may suspect their clean∣liness
in making it; for they Churn it
in a Sheep or Goat skin, dressed or fit∣ted
for that office, which they shake be∣tween
their Hands.


But not much delighted with their
Dary-house, I leave it to observe their
Reverence to Bread and Corn, which is
both great and general, for from the
Throne to the Plough, if any see a crum
of the one, or a grain of the other cast
out, or scatter'd, he stoops to take it
up, kisseth it, puts it to his Fore-head,
and looking up, saith, 
Dill an, It is from
God;
 and then gives it to the first Crea∣ture
that will eat it.








CHAP. VI.


Of the Moresco Giamma's, or
Churches: their Foundation,
Consecration, manner of Stru∣cture,
Subordination.


ALL Religions in their first model
and Constitution have had some
less intelligible Articles and things of
a remoter signification, mingled with
their easier Doctrin's, and more obvious
Institutions. And there has ever bin
found a Catholique agreement, not on∣ly
in the main Article of the Deity, but
also in some solemne manner of his wor∣ship.
Upon which consideration there
were ritual circumstances established,
for the more decent celebration of Re∣ligious
Ministers. In the number of
which 
ritual Circumstances,
 I esteem 
a
dedicate place, Separate Time, solemne
Actions, Prescript Forms,
 and above all a

distinct Order
 of 
Persons,
 by whom the
Exteriot Religion is to be officiated, and
to whom for the Power & Sacredness of
their Function there have ever bin de∣creed


convenient Observances and Re∣venues.
How determinate the 
Alchoran

is in these particulars, falls not within
the compass of these remarkes, but it is
evident to those that attentively read it,
that the Author thereof seems not in a∣ny
thing to be definitive. But what ever
the mind was of that Impostor concern∣ing
the mentioned Rites, we find his
Sectaries have in all their Dominions
made Provision for Solemnity in their
Worship. Being guided thereunto ei∣ther
by the more lasting and regular
Principles of Reason, or in imitation
of some people of an other Perswasion,
which they esteem'd Wise and Delibe∣rate.
Nor can 
Mahumed
 be blamed for
not leaving Decretals in the Rights of
worship, because their nature is of so
great an indifferency, that no Religion
doth acknowledge them to be determi∣ned
in every particular by any Law,
meriting, or usurping, the title Divine:
neither is there any thing in themselves
to make them originally necessary.


And therefore without enquiring in∣to
the Motives by which the Moors or o∣thers
have been induced to the usage of


the Accessories of Religion, I only ob∣serve
that the Moors are not therein de∣fective;
having Churches, Priests, Times,
Revenues, &c. appropriate to the Di∣vine
Adoration.


I shall begin with their Giámma's,
Moschs or Churches in which this Coun∣trey
abounds, and to which the Moors
perform a great Reverence and libera∣lity,
never suffering them to be pro∣fan'd,
nor to want a competent stock
to keep them in repaires. The manner
observ'd in the erection of a new Gi∣ámma
is orderly and laudable, which
is thus: When a considerable Number
of People have agreed and resolved to
settle together in neighborhood, they
seek out a piece of ground convenient
for their purpose, which by mutual con∣sent
is divided, every family being al∣lowed
sufficient Room, whereof to
rear an habitation. This done their
next care is to set apart a spot of Earth
for the foundation of their Giámma,
with great regard that it have no consi∣derable
inequality of distance from their
several habitations. After they have
thus fram'd their Designe, the Giámma


is first built, to which Holy work all a∣ges,
sexes, and qualities of persons con∣tribute
their labours Gratis, every one
valuing it for a peculiar felicity and ho∣nour
to have his hands and shoulders
wearied in such a sacred imployment.
The fabrick or Giámma being finish'd,
they dedicate it to no Patronage but the
Publique Worship, nor use any other
ceremony of consecration, but only
choose one that is able to read the 
Al∣coran,

whom they accompany to the new
Giámma, where some parcel of their
Law is read, and their Sallà's, or offices
perform'd, and from that time it is ac∣counted
a Holy place. And the Giámma
being thus raised to its full Stature, eve∣ry
family begins a Cotage for it self,
and when they are built, they seek for
an Alfaqui, or Priest, to Officiate in
their new Church, with whom they a∣gree
for a yearly Pension.


But we must restrain this custome of
building Churches to the 
Barabárs
 who
have fixed Mansions; for the 
Alárbs
 who
retain no place of constant habitation,
have for their Giámma a large Tent
standing exactly in the middle of their


dwelling-Tents, whither they resort at
Canonical hours to their Orisons, in
which they are comformable to the o∣ther
Moors.


The Giámma's doe all agree in the
fashion of structure; being all long and
generally narrow, not running into
Iles, nor branching into Chappels and
Quires. Their situation is East and
West, without any windows at all, nor
have their Giámma's doores but on the
North-side. 
[They are without the too
easie accommodations of seats, Pews, or ben∣ches:]

the floor of the Giámma is hand∣somely
matted, and so are the walls a∣bout
two foot high. If the roof be large
and weighty it is supported with pillars,
among which hang the lamps, which are
kept burning all the night.


Every Giámma has a turret, on whose
top is placed a Crescent, or half Moon
(a 
Mahumedan
 Cognizance) from this
Turret the 
Almudén,
 or Sexton, with a
loud voice invites the People to Prayers,
which supplies the forbidden use of
Bells. The Moors keep their Giámma's
in a very Reverend decency, never per∣mitting
any dilapidations. None are


vouchsafed to enter them but the Males
of their own Religion, which makes it
dangerous for Christians or Jews to
look within them; yet if this happens
they think not the Holy place to be
thereby any way desecrated. But this
signal respect to their Churches, renders
not their Devotions elsewhere perfor∣m'd,
to be invalid; yet if possible they
never faile to be at their Giámm's, attri∣buting
much to the Statary prayers made
in the Church.


In greater Towns there are many
Giámma's: in 
Tituàn
 fifteen, in 
Alcázar

more, in 
Arzíla,
 five, and in 
Fez
 seven
hundred. Among which there is a sub∣ordination,
for the 
Giámma Gheber,
 or

Great Giámma,
 being the 
Cathedral,
 or
Mother-Church, commands the rest, and
is the Cure of the 
Alcalib,
 or Chief-Priest.
To the 
Giamma Gheber
 all the
other Giámma's conforme in the houre
of publique offices, and though all the
rest are hung with Lamps, yet this has
one of a peculiar shape and quantity,
called Ettouria, or the Master-Lamp,
in testimony of the Chutche's Prelacy.








CHAP. VII.


Of the Moresco Priests, their edu∣cation,
Orders, Office, Reve∣rence
of the Priest, Revenue,
the Almudén, Penalties for
absence from the Giámma's.


THe Moors have at this day no
Schools of Science, like the Eu∣ropean
Universities and Colledges;
which may be a main reason of their
Growing stupidity and Barbarism; for
the want either of leisure, or lack of op∣portunity
to study Arts and Sciences,
because their whole time is spent in
gaining whereon to live, through a
deficiency whereof the politest Nations
will soon degenerate into ignorance
and rusticity. As for the Colledge call'd

Amarodóch
 in 
Fez
 (whose structure
cost King 
Aba Henen
 480000 Crowns,
and which has been so amply celebra∣ted
for the Concinnity of its building,
delightfulness of scituation, carved roof,


Mosaic Arches and brazen gates) it is
now wholly destitute of Students. And
if the Moors were not carefull to keep
up great store of Petty Schooles, they
would soon decay and fall into a total
illiterature. In these Petty Scholes the

Alfáqui,
 or Priest, takes in the first rudi∣ments
of his Learning, without any pos∣sibility
of climbing higher than to write
and read; and if a Youth be found to∣wardly
and capacious, and bearing a
good affection to the Priesthood, when
he has arriv'd to the first forme in the
School, he is removed thence, and placed
with one of the best learned 
Alfàqui's
 in
the Town, or 
Cavíla
 where the School is
kept. And this new Tutor instructs his
Pupil to read the 
Alcoran
 with perspicu∣ity,
and to understand the principal
points it containes: The Tutor likewise
informes him of all the Rites of the Gi∣ámma,
which being both few and easy,
are quickly obtain'd; and when the
Schollar is deem'd competent both for
age and Learning to be a Priest, then
his Institutor call's two or three 
Al∣fáquis

more to examine the Candidate,
who being found deserving, they grant


him Testimonials of his willingness and
abilities to be an 
Alfáqui:
 And this is
all the education and Orders, which I
could observe to be bestowed upon their
Priests. But it is very remarkable, that
among the Moors none are admitted to
this Holy Dignity, but such as are of a
competent age, and marryed; for the
former they render this reason, a No∣vice
ought not to be admitted to the
Priesthood; but I conceive that their jea∣lousie,
with which they are notoriously
gifted, is the fittest account can be gi∣ven
of the later.


The Moors suffer no Giámma to be
vacant, because they esteem an 
Alfáqui

to be altogether necessary to exteri∣or
Religion; and that Common Persons,
or the Laity, performing the solemn
offices of Religion, doth make them com∣mon.
For Holy Rites are no more to
be dispensed by all, than the secular
Laws; and though all men have common
Interest both in Religion & the Laws,
yet all cannot be Administers of either.
And upon this consideration, that in the
Combinations and Communions of men
Religion cannot subsist, without some


to guide, officiate, and prescribe the
ministeries thereof, the Moors are dili∣gent
to provide an 
Alfáqui
 for every Gi∣ámma,
that there may be no vacancy,
nor omission in the service.


To the 
Alfáqui
 the Lay-Moors pay a
signal Reverence, giving him the more
honourable hand, and place. They
plough his ground, dress his vineyard,
reap his Corn, &c. to the end that by no
secular cares he may be interrupted in
his Function; And by this I am guided
to look into the office of the 
Alfáqui,

which is first, to preserve the Giámma in
decency, and to provide that the stru∣cture
be not dilapsed, & that the Lamps
and matts be duely supplyed. But the
Priest never puts his hand to any ser∣vile
work, having those under him upon
whom all the drudgery is discharged.


The second part of the 
Alfáqui
's of∣fice
is, to inspect the Institution of the
children; to which purpose he hath u∣sually
under him, one that is fit for the
toyle, and reserves to himself no more
but the examination of the Childrens
proficiency, which he doth once a week;
and those whom he finds remiss, receive


his Correction, but the diligent, the
marks of his approbation. They have
no free Schools, but pay a weekly salary
to those whom the 
Alfáqui
 doth appoint
to teach, for none can be a School-Ma∣ster
without his Licence and approof.


His next care is to take notice who
absent themselves from the Giámma,
having power at his own discretion to
punish whomsoever he observes to be
therein delinquent. He is very vigilant
to assist the sick, whom dying he accom∣panies
to the Grave. If there happen a∣ny
disagreement among the Neighbours,
the 
Alfáqui
 mediates a reconcilement,
but if the Quarrel exceeds ill language,
and be concerning 
Meum
 and 
Tuum,
 he
is not permitted to intermeddle.


If the 
Alfáqui
 dislike his Cure, he hath
liberty of removall, being not confin'd
to any 
Parochial
 Giámma above a year,
and he seldome contracts for a longer
space. And for that time he is the Su∣perintendent
of the 
Mosch,
 out of whose
Rents he defraies all the Charges for
Reparations, &c. takeing the surplu∣sage
for himselfe.


And now the remarke passeth to the


Revenues of the Giámma, which chiefly
arise from the Donatives of the dead. In
some places the Incoms are very large,
in all comfortable; for the Moors ex∣ercise
a great benevolence to places de∣dicated
to Religion: whereby they re∣proach
many stiled Christians, who cast
aside the least sheaf for the Tenth, and
who are so far from enlarging the Church∣es
Patrimony, that they are ready to
devour the pitiful Remainder that she
still enjoyes.


Muley Mahumed,
 in his third Com∣mandment,
enjoynes his 
Musalmim
 Li∣berality,
and Alms-deeds, which pro∣ceeding
from goods honestly gotten are
according to the 
Alcoran
 meritorious of
Paradise. He likwise prefers private
Almes before the publick, and declares
the Devil to be an inplacable enemy a∣gainst
this expression of mercy. And in∣deed
there are many such pious do∣ctrines
in the 
Alcoran,
 but they are but
as so many good eares of corn in a good
field of Tares, or as so many single grains
lost in a heap of chaff: it having been
the subtilty of the old Serpent in all a∣ges,
to guild over his poysonous Pills,


and to blend Truth with falshood, that
the latter might be embrac'd for the sake
of the former. Besides it is an ancient
mistake to think, that Truth and falshood
are of too great a contrariety and di∣stance
to mingle and concorporate;
which makes many when they have found
some truth in Doctrine, to conclude no
falshood to be joyned with it. And those
truths which are dispersed up and down
in 
Mahumed
's Law, being evident to its
Professors, make them credulous of the
whole system. And though they are
zealous for all the precepts, yet for
none more than that which concernes
Alms-deeds; for they have their 
Asho∣ràh

which is an Anniversary Festival,
whereat they bestow a certain quanti∣ty
of their Substance upon the Poore.
But the greatest Bounties are towards
the Giámma, to which every one at his
death leaves a Portion of his estate, by
which method the Giámma has conside∣rable
endowments, which are under a
continual improvement, and made ca∣pable
of no manner of Alienation.


To every Giámma there belongs an 
Al∣mudèn,

or a kind of Sexton, whose of∣fice


is to call the people to Church at the
houres of prayer; which he doth from
the top of the Turret (mention'd a∣bove)
crying with a voice articulate
and loud, 
Illáh Ghebèr, God is the great;

and sometimes, 
Lailláh La Mahumèd Re∣súl
allá.
 There is but one God, and 
Ma∣humed

the Messenger of God. And these
words the 
Almudèn
 pronounceth at e∣very
corner of the Turret, beginning
at the East, and ending at the point that
looks toward 
Mecha;
 by which they si∣gnify,
that all the corners of the world
should look towards 
Mecha
 in worship∣ing
the Deity, that is be 
Mahumedans.


The next office of the 
Almudèn
 is, to
open the doores of the Giámma, to trim
the Lamps, and keep the matts in repair
and cleanliness. He also informes the

Alfáqui,
 who hath an inherent power
to punish those who can show no good
reason of their absence.


But the penalty is very tolerable, be∣ing
no more than five or six pounds of

Cuscussòw,
 which the offender brings to
the Giámma, where it is eaten by the
Priest and the Assembly. None are found
to offend therein through contempt, or


wilfulness, nor yet through the pursu∣ance
of their pleasures; for there is so
strict an observance of the Church-ser∣vice,
that the husband will leave the socie∣ty
of his wife to be there, if he hears the

Almudèn
 speaking the 
Invitatory.
 The last
branch of the 
Almuden
's office is to dis∣miss
the people, which he doth at the
end of the Salla, or Orisons, in the same
words that he called them together. And
now before I close up this chapter, I
cannot, speaking of their Ecclesiastique
penance, but observe that the Moors have
no such thing as excommunication, so
that they are for no crime debarr'd the
Giámma; but on the contrary the grea∣test
mulct inflicted by the Priest is for
their absence, above three times in twen∣ty
four hours, from that Holy Place.

A∣larbèe
Ashá,
 a little within night; The
last, 
Alhamsáh Magnib,
 which is in win∣ter
a little before day. At every assem∣bling
the Prayers are the same, except
that at the 
Allahiríc Luli
 they repeat the

La illa Ghehèr
 but thrice. The Moors
esteem the prayers made in the Giámma
to be of the greatest efficacy, and there∣fore
all endeavour to performe them
there, but those who cannot repair thi∣ther,
doe discharge this duty, where


the solemn houres find them


In their addresses to these Holy cele∣brations
the Moors use great tokens of
reverence, being very punctual in fitting
themselves for the Giámma. Their ge∣neral
preparative consists in washing;
which is such a necessary right, that
without its observation it is impossible
to be of their Religion. And it is no∣torious
to all acquainted with the 
Ma∣humedan

Institutes, that Washing is a
great part of that Law; nor need this
create any man's wonder, seeing that
all the 
Musalmim
 of the 
Alcoran
 use
washing in a mystic signification of in∣ternal
purity, and that the soul receives
the benefit of their corporeal Lavors.
None among them returne from natural
evacuations, but they wash the parts li∣able
to defilement, nor will any who is
a Virtuoso in the Ceremomies, eat with
unwasht handes: which at first I Inter∣preted
a mere Civil Cleanliness, because
they use no knives, &c. but tear their
viands in pieces with their fingers,
but upon farther scrutiny I perceiv'd it
to be reckon'd by the superstitiosi a∣mong
the Actions of Religion.



In places where they have hot Bathes
(which are in few places wanting) they
use them after concubinate, and all im∣provident
pollutions; but their greatest
exactness in washing, is at their going to
prayer. Then every part where nature
disburdens her excretions, is warily
cleansed, and the other parts also which
are more egregiously obnoxious to pollu∣tion.
If any Moor after he has washt
at home, in his way to the Giámma
chance but to belch, he dares not enter
the Holy r
of of untill he has us'd the lo∣tion.
And therefore in the foundation
of a Giámma, great care is taken that it
may stand near some spring, or recepta∣cle
of water, that those who come to
the Church, may be provided with that
element in case of any contingent de∣filement,
without the trouble of return∣ing
home to wash.


When they come to the door of the
Giámma, every one puts off his shooes at
the threshold, and then enters with a
slow pace, erect body, and eyes bash∣fully
looking towards Heaven: in this
posture they advance directly to the
southside of the Giámma, and they al∣ways


make their prayers toward that
point, because in all their devotions they
are commanded to make them toward

Mecha.
 While they are in the Giámma
none dare openly to yawne, Cough, walk,
discourse, spit, scratch his head or face,
but if any has need but to wipe his lipps,
he doth it unseen, covering his counte∣nance
with his 
Alheìc,
 which is a loose
garment generally worn by the Moors.


And by these Reverences in their
Carriage toward Holy places and Per∣formances,
they are taught to upbraid
the Christians, whose behaviours at sa∣cred
solemnities some of the Moors have
observ'd to be of a far different character.
And this I learned from a Moor who had
unluckily been in England to make the
animadversion, with whome when I dis∣cours'd
about this point, he told me
with anger and indignation in his looks,
that it was a shame to see women, Dogs,
and dirty shooes, brought into a place
sacred to God's worship, and that men
should walk and discourse in a 
Mosch,

as in a publick 
Borsa
 or 
Exchange,
 and
that they should have Chaires there to
sit in with as much lascivious ease, as at


home: which with other actions of the
like irreverence he zealously repeated to
reproach the Christian. And indeed I
was not furnisht with arguments to
(nor could in conscience) excuse any
considerable part of his Animadversion:
only I told him; That as for the exclu∣sion
of Women from the publick offices
of the 
Mosch,
 it was a doctrine of the 
Al∣coran,

grounded upou conceits of imper∣fection
peculiar to that sex, which are
not so far to be own'd, as for them to ex∣clude
the females from the meanes of
their chiefest felicity. Besides this ex∣communion
of women, was an Article of
Interest and Policy, and which 
Mahu∣med

adopted into his Religion on pur∣pose
to complease the Jew, who at this
day begins his publick Prayer with a
thanksgiving to God, 
que no le hizo mu∣ger,

that he did not make him a woman,
a creature not allowed to serve him in
the Synagogue, & that seeing we wanted
reasons which moved the Moors to this
practice, we could incurr no scandal by
its rejection. As for his objecting our
bringing Dogs into the Church, I told him
it was an uncomely and irreverend per∣mission


& wholly abhorr'd by knowing.
Christians; that there was a Provision
made against it, and that it had been his
ill hap to look into a Church, where the
Sanction in that particular met with a
remiss execution. Next, as to our ha∣ving
seates in the 
Mosch
 (for I was to
speak in his own dialect) and to sit at
some parts of Divine service, Custom
and innocent convenience were all
that any one could pretend to hollow
it. But as for walking in the Church
in time of Divine Service, or therein
at any time to discourse of secular con∣cernments,
that it was only the pra∣ctise
of profane and ill disciplin'd
minds, the miscarriage of the rude,
contrary to the Rule, and a certain ar∣gument
of a relaxed Discipline and neg∣ligent
Superintendent.

Pudet haec opprobria—.

But I return to the 
Giámma,
 whither the

Alfáqui
 comes not till a considerable
number of the People are assembled;
who in the Priests absence spend their
time in a devout repetition of the 
Sal∣lah,



a Word that signifies the whole
Form of their Prayers. And when the

Alfáqui
 is come, he advanceth straight to
the South-side of the 
Mosch,
 and the
People fall orderly into ranks behind
him. Upon this the Priest begins the
Prayer in a Voice moderately elevated,
which the People humbly repeat after
him. At the pronouncing of 
Illah El
Gheber,
 that is, 
God is the great,
 they
all use an Elevation both of Hands and
Eyes to Heaven: at the name of 
Mecha,

they all kiss the Ground; but when they
mention 
Muley Mahumed,
 and the Mer∣cies
he procures them, they fall prostrate,
and upon the sudden, in a kind of Ra∣pture,
reassume an erect. When the
Priest hath repeated 
la illah Mahumed
Resul Allah
 four times, the 
Almuden
 dis∣misseth
the People. And when they
leave the 
Giamma,
 the 
Alfáqui
 goes first,
as a token of his Prelacy above the Peo∣ple.
Their 
Salláh
 or Service is very
short, for if it took up any considerable
time, the frequency of its return would
take up most of their leisure, and there∣by
be a sensible impediment to their
Temporal Vocations.



In the closure of this Chapter, I
thought to have spoken something of the

Moresco
 Musick in the 
Mosch,
 but this I
found to be a delightful piece of Devo∣tion,
wherein they seem to be very igno∣rant.
I have been told, that in former
time they had in every 
Giámma
 some
Lay-persons, that understood the 
Ca∣dences

of the 
Alcoran,
 and which could
sing it in its Original Metre, which must
needs be very harsh Harmony, if any at
all, in regard of the incapacity that is
in the 
Alcoran
 Language to fall into Syl∣labical
Measures and Tuneable Propor∣tions.
Besides, the 
Moors
 have very
harsh and sawing Voices, as they will
have cause to observe who have had their
Ears grated with their Amorous Son∣nets,
in which all are wont to express
their sweetest and best moving Accents.








CHAP. IX.


Of the Moresco Church Govern∣ment.
The Alcalib, or High-Priest.
The Instruction of the
VVomen. Forms of Prayer.
Charms composed by the Mara∣bitós
or Marabouts. Sabbaoth,
its Institution, Celebration.


SOme have laid it down for a great
Reach in 
Muley Mahumed,
 that he
reserv'd the Church-Government to
himself and his Successors: Which is still
visible in the Grand 
Seignior
 and the

Sophi;
 for albeit the one hath a 
Mufti,

and the other a 
Mustard-Dini
 to inspect
the Ecclesiastick Affairs, and to be as
the Oracular Interpreters of the 
Mahu∣medan

Law, yet their Election is incom∣municably
in themselves. And albeit
that these Principal Church-men are had
in so great esteem with their Princes,
that their Decisions are scarce ever con∣tradicted


by them, yet when their De∣terminations
are not consistent with the
Interest of the Publick, these great O∣racles
are dismist, and others introduc'd,
who are not so scrupulous in their Sen∣tences.
By which it is evident, that the

Mahumedan
 Princes are in effect the
Heads of the Church, and chief Expo∣sitors
of Religion. But not much of
this can be observed in the 
Moors
 Church-Government,
who have in every 
Cavíla

(or County) an 
Alcalib,
 or High-Priest,
in whose nomination the secular Power
doth not at all interpose, for he is cho∣sen
out of, and by the 
Alfaqùis,
 over
whom he is invested with a Power, where∣by
he is enabled to Depose, or otherwise
Chastise the Offending Clergy. Imme∣diately
upon this Arch-Priests Election,
he is possess'd of the 
Giámma Gheber,
 or
Great Church: Wherein upon every
Friday he Expounds some Text of the

Alchoran,
 unto which Exercise he always
goes accompanyed with the chief Per∣sonages
of the Neighborhood. And being
enter'd the Church, he immediatly as∣cends
the 
Albambár
 (which is a Bench a∣bout
five steps from the Ground) with a


tall Staff in his Hand, wherewith he of∣ten
beats upon the Bench to express his
Zeal, and to awaken the People to a
more signal attention to what he then
delivers. This Discourse, Homily, Ex∣position,
or Sermon, exceeds not an hour
and a quarter in length, and is deliver'd
exactly by heart. And when it is end∣ed,
the 
Almuden
 dissolves the Congrega∣tion,
and the 
Alcalib
 returns to his House
accompanyed with the chief of the place,
and in his passage he receives the custom∣ary
Tokens of respect from the People.
And whatever some Cursory Review of
this Countrey tell us of the other Priests
making Sermons to the People, yet ha∣ving
with some diligence made enquiry
into this particular, I found that the Of∣fice
of Preaching was peculiar to the 
Al∣calib,

or Chief-Priest, and that no Ser∣mons
were celebrated at any other
Church, but at the 
Giámma Gheber
 (that
which I may English the Cathedral.)
This eminent Church-man is seldom seen
in Publick, but at this Exercise; for to
make himself the more Reverenced he
affects retirement, spending his hours in
the study of the 
Alchoran,
 and in resol∣ving


such Cases as the Layity present
him, who esteem his Resolutions infalli∣ble.
And this, with a careful Inspection
into the deportment of the Inferior
Clergy, doth constitute the Office and
Government of the 
Alcalib.
 As for his
Revenues, they are suitable to his con∣dition:
and as to his Life, it is austere
and reserv'd, he affecting a peculiar Gra∣vity
in all his carriage. Every 
Alcalib

has his distinct Diocess, out of which
he has no power, so that the 
Alcalib
 of

Beni-Arós
 hath nothing to do in 
Minkél,

for every one is absolute in his own 
Ca∣víla.


At the publick Instructions of the 
Gi∣ámma,

none are present but the Males,
for the Women, as I said, are denyed
admission into the Assembly, yet are not
wholy destitute of the means of being
taught Religion: for upon every Friday
they repair to the House of the 
Alfaquí,

where his Wife is bound to Instruct
them: But her Lectures usually concern
good Houswifry, and how they should
demean themselves to their Husbands, in
Obedience and Submission, and to live
in Peace with their Fellow-wives. All


the while the Women are at the Priests
House, he is not to return home, nor
stir out of the 
Giámma,
 but hath his
Meat brought him thither. But for what
reason the Priest should be under this re∣straint,
I leave any one to imagine, who
has heard of the 
Moresco
 Jealousie. But
now in case the Priest has no Wife, who
seldom wants four; or that by any In∣disposition
she is not able to perform this
Office, then it is discharged by some
aged Matron of the place: and for a fur∣ther
supplement of the Womens being
debarr'd of the 
Giámma,
 their Husbands
repeat unto them such Lessons as they
have heard there. And this is all that
on this account I could observe of the

Moors
 Women.


Muley Mahumed
 styled Prayer the Key
of Paradise, and the Pillar of Religion,
that he might the better recommend its
practice to his Converts, who generally
maintain so careful a performance of this
Duty, that no secular business can detain
them from, nor any thing divert them at
their Devotion. I once endeavor'd to
collect their Prayers into an Order, the
better to take a distinct view of this Pil∣lar


of their Religion, but I found them
reduced to no certain Form extracted
out of the 
Alcoran,
 but were a Collecti∣on
of some incoherent Sentences mag∣nifying
the Power and Mercy of God.
Their first Prayer, or rather their Creed,
is that which the 
Almuden
 Proclaims with
a loud voice, when he calls the People to
the 
Mosch;
 as there is but one God, and

Mahumed
 his Messenger: and this admits
of no variation. The second Prayer is
the first Chapter of the 
Alcoran,
 where∣in
there is some difference according to
Translations (in which the 
Alcoran
 hath
been very unhappy) but those which I
have seen in 
Latin, Spanish,
 and 
French,

agree in this Traduction of the Cha∣pter.


In the Name of God, Gracious and Mer∣ciful,
King of the Day of Judgment: thou
art He whom we adore: it is from Thee
that we require help: guide us in the right
way, in the way of those with whom Thou
art pleased, against whom Thou art not
angry, and we shall not go astray.
 This
Prayer is repeated with the former, af∣ter
the same manner as the Papists re∣peat
their 
Pater noster
 with the 
Ave Ma∣ria:



For the 
Moors
 have their 
Tesserae
Precariae,
 or their Beads, wherewith
they number their Prayers. And the
whole 
Corona
 or 
Rosary
 consists of nine∣ty
eight, which the 
Devoti,
 or Religi∣ously
affected, carry always about them.
They have a Custom to repeat often to∣gether
the first Words of the Prayer,
which they conclude to be a great act of
Charity, as supplying by this Repetition
the defaults of such as are remiss in this
duty.


In the Name of God, Merciful and Gra∣cious,

is the Proeme of every Chapter in
the 
Alcoran,
 and were the first Words
that 
Mahumed
 is said to have spoken
when he came out of his 
Epileptick
 Fits,
which he made the People believe were
Trances. And with the same Words
the 
Mahumedan
 Doctors begin all their
Discourses, and the Letters written in

Moresco
 Language, if the Pen-men are
precise, are likewise introduced in the
same Form. There is a Learned Man,
that tells of a Prayer among the 
Mahu∣medans,

which is called, 
The Prayer of
Jesus the Son of Mary,
 ending thus, 
And
let not such an one bear rule over me, that


will have no pity upon me, for thy mercy
sake, O thou most merciful.
 But having
diligently enquired, I could not find
that the present 
Moors
 have any such Le∣tany
in their Uses. There are few who
are able to read, that want Manuals of
Private Devotions, which are composed
by the 
Morabito
's or 
Morabouts,
 and are
indeed rather to be termed Charms, then
Prayers. Now these 
Morabito
's or 
Mo∣rabouts,

are a sort of 
Alárbes
 which are
skilled, or so pretend to be, in the Law
of 
Mahumed,
 severe in their Conversa∣tion,
bearing a great ostentation of San∣ctity,
pretending to Prophesie, or Pre∣dictions.
They compose all sorts of
Charms, to which the 
Moor
 is so addict∣ed,
that he has one for every occasion:
I have seen a whole Book thereof, con∣taining
some for the Child-bearing Wo∣men,
to facilitate their Travel; some
for the Passenger, to guide him in the
way; some for the Soldier; and one
for the Horse, which is much in the Ser∣vice
of the Saddle: This they hang un∣der
the Beasts Neck, and believe that it
keeps him from being blind, or dim∣sighted.
They have likewise Spells to


keep their Cattel healthy, and make
them fruitfnl, all compos'd by the 
Mo∣rabouts

and Priests; the latter, of late,
being much given to this sort of Compo∣sures.


And now from these short Notices of
the 
Giámma
 and its Appendages, I pass
to speak of the 
Moresco
 Sabbaoth. That
the fifth day of the Week, is the Weekly
Festival of the 
Mahumedans,
 to distin∣guish
them from the 
Jew,
 who keeps the
sixth according to our account, and from
the Christian who observes the se∣venth,
is known unto every one that
knows any thing of this subject. About
the Institution of this Sabbaoth, varie∣ty
of Opinions may be met with: For
some derive its Original from the vene∣ration

Mahumed
 bore to the New Moon,
which is said to have appeared on Fri∣day,
the same day he began his Impo∣sture;
and in memory of so happy an
abodement, he set apart this for Solemn
Worship. There is another Conjecture
which fetcheth its Institution from some
Heathen Rites paid on this day to 
Ve∣nus,

whose name Friday bears. But
there is little ground of this Opinion,


further then it may well suit with the
Genius of 
Mahumedism,
 to have a day
Sacred to the Goddess of Carnality. But
that Opinion herein seems best to agree
with the Chronicles of 
Mahumed,
 which
makes his escape from the Conspiracy
of the Nobles of 
Mecha,
 to have been
the occasion of this Sabbaoth, from
which deliverance the 
Mahumedan Hegi∣ra

had its Original and Name. And in
this 
Mahumed
 undoubtedly imitated the
Ancient Christians, who took their 
Ae∣ra
's
from some notable Persecutions.
But whatever was the Original of this
Sabbaoth, I observ'd that it has no great
marks of Reverence above other days:
for on it the 
Moors
 go to Plough, hold
their Markets, open Shops, and omit
little of their Ordinaries, so that I must
retract my calling of it a Sabbaoth.


They indeed on this day have an Ex∣position
at the 
Giámma Gheber,
 and on
it they put on their whitest 
Alheics,
 dress
their Locks, and are seen in their best
Accoutrements. The Women likewise
on this day visit the Sepulchres, and
and strew the Graves of their deceased
Friends with green Boughes and Herbs.


And this is all that I have been able to
remark upon this subject.






CHAP. X.


Of the Moresco Judicatory, chief
Minister of Justice, Rule and
manner of Process, Testimony
upon Oath, Recovery of Debts,
Punishment of forgers of Wri∣tings.


THe 
Moors
 have no Judicatories, or
Publick Houses where they assem∣ble
about Judicial Controversies; nei∣ther
have they any Mercenary Advo∣cates,
or profess'd Lawyers, but all is
decided by an 
Alcaddée,
 who is appoint∣ed
by the Supreme Ruler to be the Mi∣nister
of Justice in the 
Cavíla,
 and Town
where he lives. Now every 
Cavíla
 hath
a peculiar 
Alcaddée,
 from whom they
cannot Appeal to any other but 
Alcaddé
Gheber,
 or the chief of these Justices,


who is appointed to receive such Ap∣peals,
and is in constant attendance up∣on
the King, or chief Governor. But
it is not permitted to use these Appeals,
except in Causes which are supposed to
be too difficult for the Decision of the
Local 
Alcaddées;
 and when the matter
is of that Importance that the Parties
are unwilling to acquiesce in the solita∣ry
Sentence of one single 
Alcaddée.


These Justitiaries take no state of re∣tirement,
nor do they weary out the
poor Clients with tedious Attendances,
but to signifie the facility of access, and
their readiness to relieve and succor the
Oppressed, these 
Alcaddées
 sit in the
Gates of the City, or some open and
Publick place, to hear and determine all
Cases that are brought before them.
And albeit that this manner of doing Ju∣stice
be conformable to the Custom of
the greatest and best Antiquity, as also
very significative of open & clear deal∣ing;
yet the 
Moor
 renders another rea∣son
thereof, and that it is to avoid all
Suspicion and Jealousie of corrupt Car∣riage
in the 
Alcaddée
 with the Female
Plaintiffs that sollicit him for Divorces.



Every one of these Local 
Alcaddées

has two Assessors, who in abstruser
Pleas assist him with their Counsels: But
the chief Employment of these Sides∣men,
is to Copy out the Sentences of
the 
Alcaddée,
 and to draw up all the
Contracts that come to be confirm'd by
him; for there is no bargain esteem'd
Legal and Authentick, till it be certifi∣ed
under the Hand and Seal of the To∣pical

Alcaddée.


The 
Moors,
 as all other 
Mahumedans,

acknowledge the 
Alcoran
 to be the Im∣mutable
Rule both of Civil Justice and
Religion, and therefore according to
the Letter and Interpretation thereof,
the 
Alcaddée
 frames all his Definitions
and Judgements. Here's no Intreaguing
the Plea with Resolutions, Cases, Pre∣sidents,
Reports, Moth-eaten Statutes,

&c.
 But every thing is determin'd ac∣cording
to the fresh Circumstances of
the Fact, and the Proof of what is al∣ledg'd.
The Testimony of two Men,
if they are of known sobriety, is suffi∣cient
to make good the Allegation; but
there must be twelve to ratifie it, if their
Conversation be suspected: for the



Moors
 believe, that amongst twelve Men
as much honesty may be met with, as will
equal what can be found in any two. If
any 
Alfaquí
 or Priest be introduced to
give evidence to the depending Contest▪
his bare Affirmative or Negative deposi∣tion
is of validity to put a period to the
Dispute, and the 
Alcaddée
 supersedes all
Enquiry, when the Priest hath declared
the state of the Cause. And in this, as
in all other Instances, they give a Reve∣rend
Estimation to their Priests, whose
Presence secures the Civil Disquisitions
a great Veneration with the Many.


In taking the Testimony of a Moore
upon Oath, the Servant of the 
Alcaddée

carries the Deponent to the 
Giámma
 or

Mosch,
 where in the presence of the 
Al∣caddée

he swears by that holy place, that
he will declare all what he knowes con∣cerning
the matter, to which he is to
give Evidence. But oaths are never ad∣ministred
to any in another man
's
 Case,
but such as are suspected Persons, and
they are usually numbred among the
Rogues, and faithless, who have no
Credit without them; Besides it is ne∣ver
permitted for a man to swear in his


own Case, but for want of Witnesses,
or when the Accusation is of that na∣ture,
that the Impeached cannot other∣wise
Receive Purgation. As for the
Christian, and Jew, they are suffer'd to
give Testimony according to the Rites
and Customs of their own Religions, but
the Moors, are not forward to put them
upon this Tryal, as doubting that fear
of Punishment, should tempt them
to perjury, and those who are thereun∣to
accessory (according to the 
Moresco

Principle) are involv'd in the Guilt.


In Pleas of Debt, it is required that
the Reality of the Debt be first manifest,
which being done before the 
Alcaddée,
 he
signifies it to the 
Almocadèm
 of the 
Ca∣víla

where the Debtor lives, who upon
his Signification, commandes a present
payment to be made; but if the Debtor
refuse or be unable, to give the Cre∣ditor
Satisfaction, the 
Almocadém
 Re∣mits
him to the 
Alháb's,
 or Prison (which
is alwaies near the 
Almocadéms
 house)
where he stayes till bayled thence by
sufficient Sureties, or Personally payes
the debt.


And to secure their Courts of Justice


from interfering, or clashing oue with
another, the 
Alcaddée
 of one 
Cavíla

may not intermeddle with any thing
that is transacted in an other, but eve∣ry
one moves orderly in his own Sphere,
and confines his proceedings within
the Punctual Limits of his Assigned Ju∣risdiction.
And that herein there might
be no Collusion, Covin, or Imposture,
every 
Alcaddée
 has his Privy Seal, where∣with
he firmes the contract, or other
things that pass under his hand. And the
Seal is usually engraven with the name of
the 
Alcaddée,
 and Place of his Office. And
yet notwithstanding this care to prevent,
they have the Villany of forging deeds,
which is done by some skill'd in the 
Al∣caddé
's
office. But upon detection he that
produces the forged Paper is immediatly
imprison'd, and remaines without hope
of enlargement, till he declares the For∣ger,
and after that the 
Alcaddée
 puts up∣on
him a pecuniary Mulct; but he deall's
much more severly with the Principal in
his Forgery, who for the first Convi∣ction
receives a sharp repremend from
the 
Alcaddée,
 and after that the 
Almo∣cadém

is order'd to burn his house; but


if he be found to repeat his offence, the
Forger dyes without mercy; which just
rigor secures them from the mischiefs of
counterfit writings to the prejudice of
anothers Right. So that this is a Villa∣ny
through the whole world condignly
punished; and by our own Laws, a se∣cond
forgery of Deeds concerning ano∣thers
Land after a former Conviction,
is Felony.






CHAP. XI.


The Moresco punishments of For∣nication,
Adultery, Thievery,
Retaliation, Murder, Bribery,
Ʋsury, Alcadée's Revenue, Opi∣nion
of the Jews.


IN the 
Moresco
 Catalogue of Crimes,
Adultery and Fornication, are found
in the first Comma, whose difference in
the Moors Opinion may be collected
from their Penalties. For Adultery, it


is allways Capital, insomuch that with∣out
regard of any Eminence or Quality,
the Convict thereof is certainly ston'd
to Death, which is done with most
notorious Circumstances. For first the
day of Execution is published, then the
Criminal is brought to the 
Calvary,

where bury'd up to the navel in a 
Mat
Móra,
 or a pit digged for that purpose,
every one present casts one stone, and
no more, at him, saying, this is for thy
filthy transgression of the Law; but if
the Adulterous be Persons of Condi∣tion,
their Friends have Licence to dis∣patch
them privily, to prevent the o∣pen
reproach to their family.


In the punishing Fornication they
are less Rigorous, as finding the mis∣chief
thereof not to be of so large a de∣rivation,
as that of Adultery. And if
the Persons convict of this Unchastity
are in the state of 
Coelibate,
 they are on∣ly
Chastis'd with Scourges: but if either
be married, or under matrimonial con∣tract,
Death is the certain penance. But
the Moors are no less solemn in whip∣ping
the Fornicator, than in Stoning
the Adulterer. For on Friday, after


the Arch-Priest has ended his Lecture,
the Offender, if a man, is placed at the
great door of the Giàmma 
Guebèr,
 or Ca∣thedral
Church, naked down to the mid∣dle,
and in the presence of the Congre∣gation
receives an hundred stripes on his
back from an Officer appointed for that
Purpose, who has a certain number of

Blankéles
 (or 
Moresco
 twopences,) for his
Service; the Moors as they passe by the
chastised, use these deprecatory words,

Allah Iffecni min had El ham.
 i. e. God de∣liver
me from this wicked fellow. The
woman who hath been partner in the
filthiness, suffers her punishment in the
night, when she is whipt through the
streets, but with more severity than the
man, because the Moors suppose the Fe∣male
to be of a predominant allure∣ment
in such unclean commixtures.


The Moors who live in a Roaving
condition are much addicted to Thieve∣ry,
against which the 
Alcaddée
 proceeds
by these steps of punishment; for the
first Theft the Convict is publickly
whipt in the 
Alsóuck
 or Market; for the
second, he looseth his hand; for the
third theft he may truly be said to dye



without mercy.
 For the Moors observe

Caligula
's Severity in making the Of∣fender
exquisitely sensible of his death,
which they inflict. Against the day of
the Theif
's
 Execution, the Youth of the
Place are advertis'd to prepare their
Instruments of blood, which are little
dry Canes, made in the fashion of darts,
accurately sharp pointed, these they
hurle at the naked body of the Malefa∣ctor,
till his whole skin be struck ther∣with
full of holes, and when they find
him sinking under the torture, they
dragg and hang him up by the heels up∣on
a gate, or the like, where he breaths
out his last in torments, and being dead
he is loathsomly exposed to the birds of
prey.


In bodily injuries they observe the
law of Retaliation, as an Eye for an Eye,
a tooth for a tooth, &c. but it is in the
power of the maimed party to Receive
a pecuniary reparation, or without any
satisfaction to remit the wrong; but this
is not permitted til the matter hath been
tryed before the 
Alcaddée,
 and the hurt
party publickly declared, that he is wil∣ling
either freely to forgive the injury,


or to accept so much money in full Re∣paire.


And however the Municipal Laws of
some Countreys put a vast difference
between murder and man-slaughter,
as appeares in their defin'd punish∣ments,
yet in 
Barbary
 all homicide, or
killing of a man by a man, is Capitall.


And the Moors have herein two con∣cessions.
The one is to Licence the next
kindred of the slain, to take money for
his blood of him that spilt it. The o∣ther
to permit the Relations of the mur∣dered
to kill the murderer, without a∣ny
judicial proceedure, if he be not al∣ready
in safe custody; which is no more
then a pursuance of that Position, Re∣venge
is no sinne. Of this there happen∣ed
a famous Instance, not many months
before I left 
Barbary,
 an account where∣of,
as it was given me by my old freind

Cidi Alli Mulud Ben Ali,
 take as follows.


A Moor of 
Targa
 not far from 
Tituàn

having his Brother treacherously mur∣der'd
by one of the Voisinage, under∣took
to pursue the fugitive murderer,
with designe to avenge his Relations
blood, and coming to 
Alcazer Gheber,



he was inform'd that the Person he sought
for had some days before been there,
and that he had put on a Pilgrims habit,
with full resolution to pay a holy jour∣ny
to 
Mechà;
 upon which the Pursuer
put on the like habit, and in prosecu∣tion
of his design purposed to per∣forme
the same pilgrimage; bnt being
come to 
Morocco,
 he overtook & lodg'd
with the murderer in the Pilgrims hos∣pital,
where early the next morning he
slew him; whereupon being apprehen∣ded
and examin'd upon the fresh cir∣cumstances
of the fact, he produced a
Certificate under the hand of the 
Alcad∣dée

of the place where he liv'd, that his
Brother was slain, and that he had un∣dertaken
to avenge his death, the mur∣derer
being fled, and likewise answered
them, that that was the Homicide whom
he had killed, whereupon he was set at
liberty, and the Corps left to his dis∣posal,
to which giving a decent Inter∣ment,
he returned home to receive the
praises of his Gallantry.


But to return to the 
Alcaddée,
 whom I
shall here only observe in his Revenue,
and office; as to the former it is very


considerable, for he signs not a paper
without a Fee; and as to the latter, it is
very honourable, and careful, for all ci∣vil
affaires pass through his hands, and
he dayly sitts attending on all qualities
of persons without varying his respect
to any. If he be corrupt in his Charge,
the 
Alcaddée Gueber,
 upon mature convi∣ction
turns him out of Office, which is
his extremest penalty.


But indeed the Ministers of Justice
have no opportunity to be Collusive, as
being free from the great allurement of
dealing falsly, for Bribery is not known
amongst them. Usury which (I promi∣sed
to intimate in this Chapter) is tota∣ly
forbidden by their Law, for 
Mahumed

hath made it an irremissable sinne, and
the Userer in as bad a condition as the
Divell, leaving him neither will, nor
hope to be saved.


Yet notwithstanding the severity of
the Law, and the supposition of this
Crime, the Moors have a Custom
which much favours it; for he that bor∣rows
mony of another wherewith to
trafique and gain, gives the lender an e∣qual
share of the Profits, and in case the


borrower lose the whole Principal, he
is obliged to make it good to him that
lends it, but if only part be lost, the re∣mainder
is employ'd to regain it. And
it is usual with the lender to forbear the
Borrower, till he perceives him fraudu∣lent,
Careless, or Unfortunate.


And because the sinne of Usury is so
notorious among the Jews, the Moors
believe that for it they are oppressed of
God, and live Exiles from their own 
Ca∣naan.

But it is easy to observe a sort
of Antipathie between these people, not∣withstanding
that they are conjoyned
in neighbourhood, commerce, & in very
many rites both civil and Religious. But
the contempt is reciprocal, for if the
Moor by way of Proverb say, 
As deceit∣ful
as a Jew,
 the 
Jew
 repayes, as 
uvbe∣lieving
as a Moor.
 And this enmity I
remarked in a 
Barabár
 of my Acquain∣tance,
who observing the Jews very much
frequent my lodging, he very roundly
reprov'd that Conversation, and angri∣ly
told me, That the Jews were born
to cheat both the Moor and the Chri∣stian,
that he was assured that they were
not descended of 
Adam,
 but that they


were breed of the bone of a dead beast,
and when he conjectured my incredulity
of his ridiculous Story, by my smiling
thereat, he told me in angry zeal, that
he would pledge his head for the truth
of his Assertion; whereupon I demand∣ing
what he conceived of those Jews who
turned Moors, he answer'd, that there
was such efficacy in their religion, that it
made all those good who embraced it.






CHAP. XII.


The Moresco opinion of Marriage,
manner of woeing, marriage-So∣lemnity,
carrying home the
Bride, Offering wedding-feast.


THat marriage is honorable among
all men, if it were not a truth dropt
from an inspired Pen, might be proved
by Induction, and the oecumenical con∣sent
of all Nations, which pretend to
any setled Rites in Religion or Policy.
As for 
Mahumed,
 he had matrimony in so
peculiar an estimation, that he made it
the second of his eight Precepts, and


enjoyn'd every Subject of his Law to
marry in the Vigor of his Age, making
the predominant end thereof, the Pro∣pagation
and maintenance of his Sect.
He likewise told them that chast celibate
was impossible, and that those who pre∣tended
to live therin, were justly to be
suspected for unclean conversation. And
hence perhaps it comes to pass, that
the Moors (who are the Puritans in
Mahumetism,) are so generally observant
of this commandment; for few among
them are found to live out of the state of
Wedlock, if they are able to purchase
a wife. But many are not very prone
to take all the liberty in marrying indul∣ged
them by their Prophet; for albeit
he permits them plurality of wives, yet
there are several families that for many
ages have confin'd themselves to one: &
I have met with those who abhor that
filthy position father'd upon 
Muhumed,
That the more they are spiritual, the more
liberty and abilities they have to be car∣nal.


Unto the persons that are to be mar∣ried
there is no conversation permitted
till the Knot be tyed, so that both par∣ties


take one the other upon trust, and
the man perchance never sees the wo∣man
till they be brought to the bride-chamber;
A custom that would be ve∣ry
hardly disgested by the Utopians,
who think it very unreasonable that a
man should take a wife with less scru∣tiny
than he doth his horse, and that he
should bring one to be the perpetual
partner of his life, with less informa∣tion
than he doth a horse to his stable,
which he may part with the next day.


But the Contriver of the New 
Atlan∣tis

findes all these inconveniences avoi∣dable
by the custom of 
Bensalem:
 where
(saith he) neare every Town there
is a couple of Pooles (which they call

Adam
 and 
Eves
 Pooles;) in these it is
permitted to one of the Friends of the
man, another of the woman, to see them
severally both naked. And the Moors
have a custom not much differing from
this of 
Bensalem,
 for upon the design of
marriage two of the man's Female
friends, who have lived long enough in
wedlock to understand its 
Perquisites,

are appointed to view the intended
Bride, and to give the Suitor an account


of her bodily accomplishments, and de∣fects,
which is exactly entered in the
Contract, and if any infirmity be con∣cealed
for which the husband afterward
disliks her, he may put her away; and
this makes them very cautious to omit
nothing in the search or report; But
there is no such examination passed up∣on
the man, because he is dayly expo∣sed
to a free Censure.


If this Inquisition be pass'd with sa∣tisfaction,
then they proceed to frame
the Articles of Marriage, which is al∣waies
done by the nearest Freinds or
Relations of the Parties to be contract∣ed.
And when they have finished them,
they are brought to the 
Alcaddée
 to be
confirm'd under his hand and Seal; for
unless the bargain be thus ratified, the
woman in case of her husband's death,
or her own divorce, cannot recover the
Portion that was promised her, or ra∣ther
the price that was to be pay'd for
her by the man; For I suppose that
few are ignorant of the 
Moresco
 Custom
of buying their wives; When the Paper
containing the Bargain has passed the

Alcaddée,
 it is carried to the 
Alfaquì,
 who


having perused and declared his ap∣probation
of its Contents, he bids
the Man take home the Woman when he
pleaseth to be his Wife; and this is all
that is done by the Priest in this, ac∣cording
to their Estimate.


And after this short dispatch of Woo∣ing,
Contract, and Marriage, the Bride-Grooms
next consultation is with his
own convenience in order to fetch
home his Bride: in which the warm
Clime suffers him not to be tedious. But
herein he is obliged to observe the ap∣pointed
Times; for neither all Weeks
in the Year, nor all Days in the Week,
nor all hours in the Day, are free for
this Solemnity. For the taking home
the Bride is altogether prohibited du∣ring
their 
Ramadàn,
 or Lent: The like,
Prohibition reacheth unto the Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays of every Week,
and on the Canonical or Regular Days,
the Afternoon and Evening are the ac∣customary
Hours. At the time when
Marriage is Celebrated, they use all pos∣sible
significations of Joy and Hospita∣lity;
and it is the Custom for the Friends
of the Marryed to contribute something


to grace their Nuptials. Therefore if
the Marryed Pair live both in the same
Town, then at their set time the Bride∣groom
goes attended with his nearest
Kindred, who coming to the Lodgings
of the Bride are not suffer'd to go in,
but wait at the Door till the 
Negra
's,
which the Husband hath bought or bor∣rowed
for that day, bring the Bride
from her Chamber under a Canopy of

Alhéicks,
 and place her in an 
Almaria,

or close Chair (much resembling a Tub)
which they cover with Scarfs and Ri∣bons.
And in this manner she is born
through the Streets by Christians that
are Captives, and for want of these by

Negra
's, or by a meaner sort of 
Whites.

When they begin their March from the
Brides House to the Bridegrooms, the
Musick, Colours, and Drums pass in the
first rank; next to them go some anci∣ent
Women, who have been a long space
Marryed, all closely veil'd: immediate
next after the 
Almaria,
 or Bride-Chair,
march those who carry the Clothes and
Presents of the Bride, which have been
made her by her Friends, who follow
immediatly after in a regular disposi∣tion.


When they are come to the Bride∣grooms,
the Chair being lighted, the

Negra
's take out the Bride, and under
a Canopy of 
Alheicks
 conduct her to
her Apartment, where she is received
by some aged Matrons, who instruct her
in the important Offices of a good Wife,
and the rules of that Relation, but they
are wary of betraying any discouraging
Severity, and therefore intermit their
Documents by tasting the good Cheer
provided for their Entertainment. While
the Bride is thus caressing the Matrons,
and receiving their Maternal Councels,
the Bridegroom entertains his Com∣rades,
Feasting them with the best 
Cus∣cussone,

and brisk Wines, if their over
scrupulousness debar them not the
chearfulness of that Beverage. But the
Bridegroom is not licensed for that time
to drink freely of any strong Liquor,
for Reasons not worth the mention∣ing.


In the interim of this Entertainment,
the Batchellors make a kinde of Offer∣ing
to their Wedded Companion; in
which they observe this Method: The
Bridegroom placeth himself upon a lit∣tle


low Seat, behind him stand two 
Ne∣gro
's
bending his Head moderatly back;
then come the Batchelors, who cover the
Bridegrooms Fore-head and Brow with

Metacales
 (or single Coins of Gold)
and 
Blankéles,
 according to their Af∣fection
and Ability: and as they lay
them on, the 
Negro
's stroke them off in∣to
a Basin set for that purpose in the
Bridegrooms Lap, who all the while
shuts his Eyes. The 
Negro
's likewise
call every one by name who Offer, say∣ing

Fulano
 (or such an one) lays on so
much, God enlarge his Life and Riches.
And this continues till all the Batchelors
have been at the 
Corban.
 About eight
of the Clock the Company breaks up,
with resolution to reassemble the next
Morn; and when they are gone, the
Bridegroom visits the Bride, whom he
undresses with his own Hands, first ta∣king
off her Ornaments, then untying
her Drawers, and in every point pre∣pares
her for his Bed; none being ad∣mitted
to assist, or to be present at this
Office. And this they say he doth, in
signification that she is wholly and only
at his disposal.



Some 
Conocido
's or intimate Asso∣ciates
of the Bridegroom, stay behind
the rest of the Company to congratu∣late
the first Pleasures of his Marriage.
For about Mid-night he leaves his Bride
to manifest unto his select Companions
the evidences of her Virginity, by Tradi∣tional
Arguments authentick with the

Moors.
 This good News they all cele∣brate
with increase of Jollity; and now
they venture to warm the Bridegroom
with his own Fires, and endeavour to
return him to his Bride crown'd with
his own Vine. But if she yield not
these Testimonies of Virginity, it is in
his power to put her to death, or other∣wise
to dispose of her as he pleaseth.
For they esteem that the most unpardon∣able
sort of Cozenage, which takes a
Mans self and his Money for that which
is impossible to be made good. And
those Women are accounted egregiously
impudent, who conscious of their own
Failures dare put themselves upon this
adventure.


But if for this Injury he returns her
to her Friends, she meets with that ri∣gour
at their hands, which she might


easilier have undergone from her Hus∣band;
for all her Cozens think them∣selves
dishonored in the Debauchery of
their Kins-woman, which they imagine
cannot be expiated but either by death,
or some more durable Purgatory. And
by reason of this just Severity, the 
Mo∣resco

Damsels are very cautious of their
Behaviour, and scarce in half an Age
hath any one been convict of this Delin∣quency;
however, the Man is circum∣spect
not to omit the Ordeal.


When the Bridegroom and Bride have
refreshed themselves apart with their
choice Companions, all are dismist till
the next day; when the Festival is re∣assumed,
and lasts a considerable time;
the Wedding Feast of the poorest conti∣nuing
a Week. And for this time the
new Marryed Man has a priviledge to be
absent from the 
Mosch
 without fear of
mulct. Some Grandees are not seen a∣broad,
from the day of their Wedding
till they can shew the Pledge thereof in
their Arms. But these are bound to
have a Dispensation from the 
Alfachi

for their absence from the 
Mosch,
 and
to observe the Times of Prayer in their
Chambers.








CHAP. XIII.


Of the Moresco Polygamy, Concu∣binage,
Divorce, for what reasons,
in what cases it is allowed.


THat the 
Muley Mahumed
 might the
better complease the loose humors
of his first Sectaries, he made his Reli∣gion
to contain many carnal indulgen∣ces,
denying nothing to Believers of his
Doctrin, that had any sensible comply∣ance
with their brutal affections. And
of this we meet with an Example in his
concession of Polygamie and concubi∣nage;
for first he granted to every Pro∣fessor
of his Religion the liberty of mar∣rying
four wives; he likewise taught
that they might take as many Concu∣bines
as they were able to maintain, but
in this also the more illuminated Moors
confine themselves to one of their own
Perswasion, esteeming Concubinate with
Infidels (under which name all are com∣prized


that profess not 
Mahumatism)

to be an unexorable uncleanness. As
for Polygamy it is looked upon as a Di∣vine
Institute, and when any object a∣gainst
it, the Moors vindicate it by the
frequent examples and universal cus∣tomes
thereof, in the Patriarchs and
worthies of the Hebrew world. And
I could meet with none who asserted Plu∣rality
of wives upon politick conside∣rations,
as that it was coveinent for the
propagation of the Empire, encrease of
people, and enlargement of their Re∣ligion:
but that it proceeded from God,
was used by the Holiest of his Servants,
and the oeconomy of the Old Law.


When the inconvenience of these Plu∣ralitie
is objected, and that their Oeco∣nomicks
cannot but be much disorder'd
by reason of the inquietudes, and strifes
that will inevitably arise among so many
female corrivals for one man's affection;
they tell you that this is a disease whose
remedy is of a very easy procurement,
by reason of that absolute Dominion,
which the husband hath over his wives,
whom, if they prove disagreeing, he con∣fines
to their several apartments, with∣out


allowing them any further conversa∣tion
among themselves, then that their
society at meales affords them. And if
this will not cure the unpeaceable hu∣mour,
then Divorce proves an infalli∣ble
Receit; of which give me leave to
give this briefe account.


When the woman findes herself aggrie∣ved
by her husband, or any of her fellow-wives,
her only reparation and succour
is to seek a divorce. And in this case she
has liberty to address her self to the 
Al∣caddee,

who has the sole power of dissolv∣ing,
as well as of tying, the knot of ma∣trimony.
And when the woman has de∣clard
her condition, and spread before
the 
Alcaddee
 the reasons upon which she
grounds her desire of Divorce, the 
Al∣caddee

presently sends for the husband, &
examines him concerning the verity of
the complaint brought against him by his
wife, if he deny it, then the matter is
decided by the voice of the Neighbours,
but if the husband have a willingness to
be quit of his wife, then he needs but
confess that whereof he is accused, and
the 
Alcaddee
 teares in pieces the Bill of
their marriage which he had Confirm'd,


declares the Marriage void, and certifies
the Divorce under his Seal; and from
hence forward they are both at liberty
for new nuptials. From which the wo∣man
is bound to abstain till it be appa∣rent
that she is not impregnate by her last
husband, who is still obliged, to provide
for the issue that she shall bring into the
world five months after the Divorce.
But if she cannot tarry so long, then the

Alcabla,
 or Midwife, has her in Exa∣mination,
who is bound to return a just
& true report upon pain of being stoned
to death. The Moors call the Divorce
and widdows by the same word, and en∣joyn
them the same Laws of second mar∣riage.


The chief causes of Divorce on the
womans part or either disquiet and fro∣ward
carriage to the Family, especially
when she will not live in amicable socie∣ty
with the Sharers of the same Bed: or
when she is unpleasing to her conjugal
embraces, or when she will not indure
his familiarity with his women slaves.
But if she be found guilty of adultery,
the injurie is too great for Divorce to re∣pair
and in this Case she is solely left to


the pleasure of her husband, who has
Absolute power both to be her Judge
and Executioner. And albeit the Moors
are not sparing in the revenge of their
kinreds death, yet they applaud the
husband who kils their kinswomen,
whom he has certainly found treache∣rous
to his Bed.


The occasions of Divorce on the hus∣bands
side are his refusal of paying his
wife marital Due; or, some other sort
of unkind deportment. But after all
the wives complaints, the husband is at
liberty to retain or put her away; and
he may at any time divorce his wife in
case he will make good the marriage
Contract.


It is usually said, that the wives seek
for Divorce when their husbands deal
unnaturally with them; and albeit this
is said to be done with a great deale of
modesty, the crime being signified by
the turning up of a Shooe, yet in 
Barba∣ry

examples of this kind are very unu∣sual,
for the Moors abhorre the villany,
believing that it is not in man's Nature
to be so preposterous; and that it
was at first the malitious invention of


some vile and impudent Strumpet.


The Children which are begot before
Divorce, follow not the woman, but are
left to the husbands charge. And it is
observable that the 
Moresco
 women sel∣dome
prove unfruitful, for in a town of
above twelve hundred married women,
it was reckon'd for a great rarity that
there was one dyed barren. But the
wife, different from the Jewish custom,
suffers no dishonour for her Sterility,
and if the husband takes a second wife
who proves also childless, the husband
beares the imputation. 
Mahumed
 in the
fourth Chap. of his 
Alcoran
 adviseth the
husband whose wife is barren, to swear
by her belly, and asserts it a means to
make her Conceive. A devotion which
as I have been told is still in use among
the 
Alárbes,
 but quite worne out of
fashion with the other Moors.


In the nursing of Children the mother
abhors that unnatural pride of suckling
them with other brests, while her own
are sufficient for that affectionate ser∣vice.
And to shew that there is some∣thing
more than common kindness in
this particular, the Empress her self is


obliged for the first seven days to give
her child suck.


And now before I dismiss this re∣mark,
I cannot but acquaint you with
all the material ceremonies, of the se∣cond,
third, and fourth marriages. E∣very
former wife upon the introduction
of another, lives seven days deprived of
all manner of society with her husband,
who for that time devotes himself en∣tirely
to his last Bride; whom on the
seventh day after marriage he solemnly
brings into the acquaintance and fellow∣ship
of his other wives, whose brows the
last married is bound to kiss, and tells
them that they are not to be angry that
their Holy Law hath entitled her to a
share in his affection as large as any of
theirs. The husband likwise exhorts
them all to reciprocal kindnesses, as∣suring
them that without fraud, or any
partiality, he intends to divide himself
among them.


Now that which seemes most nearly
to concern the wives, and proves the
greatest and most incentive of their
wrath is their husbands liberty of taking
as many Concubines as he lists; which for


the most part are Blacks, the Moors
doting much on that Spanish saying 
la
Negra tiene, turmentina en ella.
 But
those that keep Concubine slaves, are
not permitted to associate with them in
the night, and if any of them bear, their
Patrons Children, she thereupon re∣ceives
her liberty, and the Child is co∣heir
with those begot in Wedlock.






CHAP. XIV.


Of the Moresco admission of Rene∣negados,
Circumcision, Imposition
of Names, Sur-names.


EVery Religion have had still some
Rites appropriated to the admission
of such as undertook its profession; and
by which they were characterized and
distinguished. Concerning this the Au∣thor
of 
Mahumatism
 was much distract∣ed,
not knowing what inaugurating ce∣remony
to Ordain. His two assessors

Sergius
 the Monk, and 
Abdalla
 the Jew,
divided him with their opinions, while
each pleaded for the character of his


forsaken Faith. But the wary Impostor
(labouring to keep up the credit of his
pretensions, in being sent, to be the re∣conciler
of the Jewish and Christian Re∣ligion,
and to compose a Law compre∣hending
both) to comply with 
Sergius,

who stood stifly for Baptism, he or∣dain'd
daily washings to all those who be∣came

Mahumetans,
 & ascribed thereunto
no less efficacy than the cleansing of the
Soule. And that he might not disgust

Abdalla
 the Jew, he made Circumcision
admissive of Proselytes into his Law. But
did not institute it under any notion of
absolute Necessity, and indispensibly re∣quired
of all who undertook the Profes∣sion
of his Religion, but made the want
of it no impediment of future happiness.
And therefore in the admittance of a Re∣negado,
or the denyer of his first Reli∣gion,
circumcision is not exacted of the
Moors, for feare that the undergoing
of such a painful Sacrament should de∣ter
the Proselyte. But when any desires
to be of their perswasion, they carry the
new 
Musulman
 on horseback, in a kinde of
triumph through the streets, & proclaims
that such an one being turn'd Moor,


desires the assistance of their Prayers
that he may not Apostatise.


But their male children are initiated by
circumcision, and because the child may
die before it can be circumcised, there∣fore
the lack of this Write in such a case
is concluded to be no hindrance of its
enjoyment of Paradise. When the child
is seven days old, the Moors give it a
name, and the Father of it makes a feast.
But the imposition of the Name is done
in the publick assembly; for the Father
at the evening-Sallah carries to the
Church several dishes of Cuscussow, of
which he sets one apart for the Priest,
and the rest to be eaten up by the peo∣ple.
And when the Prayers are ended,
the congregation demand of the Father
what he will call his Child, and if the
Name he gives it be not satisfactory to
the People, they decide it by lots what
he shall be called, for every man here
has a Vote in the Nameing of his Neigh∣bour's
Child. And when they have a∣greed
the point, all pray that the child
may Live, prove Rich and Valiant, and
understand the 
Alcoran;
 then they eate
up the Cuscussow and depart. It is ob∣servable


that the Priest neither at the
Nameing, nor circumcision of the child
has any apppropriate office, of which I
could finde no other reason, unless the
Moors estimate of these Ceremonies,
which they never reckon among the es∣sentials
of Religion.


There are some who have asserted,
that there is an inevitable time of circum∣cision
among all the Mahumetans; But
if they had lived in 
Barbary,
 they might
have lessen'd the proposition, for the
Moors circumcise their children when
they please, being by Law not bound up
to any particular day or hour. But
it is generally grown into fashion, to
circumcise at the Animadversary Feast
called 
Mulud,
 kept in December in me∣mory
of 
Muley Mahumed.
 And few or
none defer the circumcision of their
Males at the first 
Mulud
 after their nati∣vity.
Now there is no person set apart
for this office, but the child is circum∣cised
by any that has a gentle and nim∣ble
hand, to whom the parent gives a
bountiful reward.


When the Sonnes arrive to a due ma∣turity,
they are disposed of to Vocations,


among which the Sword is reckon'd the
most honourable, as a Priviledge of Pri∣mogeniture
belongs to the first born.
The rest betake themselves to such Cal∣lings
as best agree with their inclinati∣ons
and Fathers fortunes. Many of
the wealthier sort put their Sonnes to
to be 
Talbyes,
 that in case they be re∣duced
to want, they be in capacity to
be received unto the Priesthood and be
maintain'd by the Church.


The Moors have no surnames, which
want they supply by adding to the
Child's name, either the name of some
remarkable time when it chanced to be
born, as the 
Ramadan, Mulud, Ashora,

and the like; or the name of the Fa∣ther
by prefixing 
Ben,
 as 
Hader Ben Ab∣dalla:

being the same with 
Thomas Fits
Williams, &c.
 and the higher they de∣rive
the pedegree by reckoning up their
Ancestors, it is accounted the most ho∣nourable.
And in this they follow the
ancient custom, for to add to a man's
proper name, the proper name of
his Father by putting [Son] before
it, was of old in stead of that, which we
now call surnames: and in some parts


this is not yet worn quite out of use.
Whether the names now given by the
Moors, are significative of any Virtues
desired or foretold by those that impose
them, to be in the Children, hath not
yet fal'n under my comprehension.


Curiosity tempting me in pursuance
of this Note, to enquire into their child-births;
I found that therein they obser∣ved
a decency conformable to the best
civilized People. For the pregnant
Wife perceiving the approach of her
pangs, call's for the 
Alcabla,
 or Mo∣ther,
the same with our Midwife, to as∣sist
her travailes, who never leaves her
till the seventh day after her delivery,
for so long she keeps her bed, and tar∣ries
forty dayes before she associates
with her husband. Who if he be scru∣pulous
will not embrace his Wife from
the time she appeares impregnate, till
the last minute of the forty days after
her delivery be accomplished.








CHAP. XV.


Of the Moresco Funeral Rites,
Testaments, Mourning for the
Dead, Esteem of Interment,
Sepulchres, Places of Burial,
&c.


THe 
Moors
 are very careful that no∣thing
be wanting or disorderly in
the Rites of Burial, wherein the survi∣ving
Relations signifie great Sentiments
of humanity and affection toward the
deceased: whom when they understand
that they are sick, they delay not to vi∣sit,
on purpose to admonish them of their
Faults, and to exhort them to look for∣ward
to the great Pleasures of Paradise.
The Priest never omits this good Office
of assisting the sick; and I have been
told, that there are certain 
Azaora
's or
parcels of the 
Alcoran,
 appointed to be
read on this occasion to the Infirm, who
if he die not while those 
Azaora
's are
thrice read over, it is an 
Omen
 of his


Recovery; but if the Agony be obser∣ved
to increase in the time of Reading,
they conclude that the Patient will not
escape: which when the sick Man ob∣serves,
and sees that in all probability
his Distemper will terminate in Death,
he begins an exact disposal of his Estate,
whereof in the first place some part is be∣queath'd
to the Parochial Church where
he lives, and some small Legacies to the

Alfachí
 and 
Almudén,
 and the rest he
leaves to be divided by the 
Alcaddée
 a∣mong
his Wives and Children: in which
Distribution, a Son hath twice as much
as a Daughter, and the Wives can claim
no more then is set down in their Con∣tract
of Marriage.


In signification of their love to the
Dead, the near Kinred of both Sexes
use Tokens very expressive of Sorrow:
the Men testifie their Griefs by putting
on their courser 
Alheícks,
 and not wear∣ing
any thing that is very white about
them, which at other times is a chief part
of their bravery: for they account white
to be no less a token of chearfulness
then Innocency, and therefore account
the wearing thereof very improper


for such sorrowful occasions. The Men
likewise (that are of near Alliance to the
Dead) cut not their Beards, but declare
their pensiveness; they suffer a great
neglect in all those Accoutrements, in
which at other times they are very cu∣rious;
and by a peculiar Fansie they
have some Hairs hanging over their Eyes
in token of a careless Sorrow. But this
is done chiefly for such as come to un∣timely
ends.


The Women are very loud and dolor∣ous
in their Lamentations of the de∣parted,
and they intermit not to howl
over the Corps while it is in the House,
which is not long, for as foon as the
Breath is expired, the dead Body is
washt with Sope and warm Water, by
those of the same Sex with the departed.
Then the Body is wrapt in white Linnen
and laid in a Coffin (though a Coffin is
but the lot of a few) on the right side,
with the Face toward 
Mecha,
 in which
posture it is also buryed. When the
Corps is carryed out to Burial, the
Priest goes next unto it, who coming to
the Grave or Sepulchre, prays that the
Sins of the Defunct may be remitted, and


that he may have a Portion in the pro∣mised
Delights. Returning home from
the Buryal, they have a Feast to comfort
those of the Family who are not permit∣ted
to dress any thing while the Corps
are in the House: and this consolatory
Feast is great or small, according to the
condition of the Dead.


They account it a great unhappiness
for one of their Faith to want a decent
Interment; and therefore if any dye
without an Estate sufficient to discharge
his Funeral Expences, they supply it by
a Neighborly Contribution. Those that
are more Wealthy and Honorable have
Sepulchres, which vary both in Materi∣als
and Fashion: For some are built of
rough Stone, others of course Marble,
but the most of Brick: Some in form of
a half Moon, others open upon Pillars;
and some round and close, and to be
enter'd by a Door. But the Vulgar lye
in common Graves, cover'd with green
Turf and Boughs. At the Feet and
Head of those that are thus Buryed, they
fix large Stones, in which are writ the
Name of the Interr'd, with the Year of
his Age and 
Hegira.
 As for Epitaphs,


they are quite worn out of request, yet
they were in great estimation of old, as
may be gather'd from that Collection
which 
John Leo
 made thereof, and pre∣sented
it to a Brother of a King of

Fez.


Upon every Friday the Women repair
to the Graves of their deceased Friends,
whose deaths they bewail with a very
loud and bitter Lamentation, recount∣ing
the great Satisfaction and Pleasure
which they once enjoy'd in their Socie∣ty.
And because they believe that on
every Friday the Soul returns to the
Body, they spread the Graves with sweet
Flowers and green Boughs on purpose to
refresh it, and to adorn the Grave. But
there are some 
Moors
 which hold this
Rite for a Mystery in their Religion,
and therefore pretend not to give any
account of its usage. They have one
thing in Buryal, observed no where else,
which is not to bury another in the same
Grave where one has been Interr'd be∣fore,
and therefore they use certain
Marks to secure them from mistakes.


It has been often told me, That the

Moresco
 Women in their Weekly La∣mentations


of the dead, use to ask them
what reason they had to dye, seeing that
they enjoyed loving Friends, wanting
none of the Comforts of this Life, 
&c.

But I found this was an idle Story, and a

Moor
 assured me that they had no such
Custom, and that it could be the Calum∣ny
of none but a deceitful Jew.


Neither is that other Story of more
credit, which makes the 
Moors
 reserve a
vacant Place in the Grave, to give the
dead Carcass room to rise up and kneel
before two pretty Angels, who come to
confess the 
Departed
 concerning the
great Points of the Law; namely, pay∣ing
of Tythes, giving of Alms, and ob∣serving
of 
Rámadon:
 for upon mature
Enquiry, I was assur'd that the 
Moors

had no such Article in their Creed.


The places of Burial that belong to
great Towns, are in the Fields: but in
the Country they are generally by the
High-ways, which may be to put Pas∣sengers
in mind of their Mortality. The
Ground which is set apart for this Im∣ployment,
is usually the Donative of
some devout Person, or purchased with
Legacies bequeath'd for that purpose.


And that there might be no fraud pra∣ctised
in this Particular, both 
Alfachí

and 
Alcáddee
 keep Registers of all such
Donations, which are transmitted to
Posterity. When the Ground is once
devoted to this service, the 
Moors
 call
it 
Blessed
 and 
Holy,
 and accounted its a∣lienation
an unpardonable Wickedness.
Neither the Christians, nor any of an∣other
Religion, are permitted to tread
within these Burial Places, unless they
be their Slaves, whom they admit to any
thing capable of service, and use as sore∣ly
as their Dogs. These Slaves always
wait upon the Women to the Sepulchres,
but for no other intent then to carry
their Flowers and Boughs, and to assist
them therewith to dress the Graves.


There is no 
Aldéa
 or Village that has
a Church, but it hath also a peculiar
Burying Place, given or bought as hath
been already mentioned.








CHAP. XVI.


Of the Moresco Ramadàn, its in∣stitution,
moveableness, man∣ner
of Celebration.


SOme have imagin'd that for twelve
Years after the promulgation of the

Mahumetan
 Law, the Sectaries thereof
kept the same Fasts with the Jews: but

Mahuméd
 being displeas'd with that re∣fractory
People, and scorning to bor∣row
any of their Institutions, command∣ed
his Proselytes to abandon their Fasts,
and appointed in their room the Moon

Ramadan,
 to be kept in an 
Anniversary
Abstinence.
 But others date this Lent
from the second Year of 
Mahumeds
 Pro∣phesie,
and that it fell out in the Month

September,
 at which time the 
Alcoran
 is
said to have been sent from Heaven. But
it is not likely that the Fast was in me∣mory
thereof, because so great a Bles∣sing
(in the 
Mahumedans
 Estimation) de∣served
to be kept in mind by a far dif∣ferent
Memorial, great Mercies having


never been Celebrated with Penances
and Corporeal Humiliations, but rather
with Festival Expressions of Joy, and
Actions significative of Exaltation.


The 
Ramadàn
 is moveable, and de∣pends
on the appearance of the New
Moon, which, if through the Cloudi∣ness
of the Weather they cannot dis∣cern,
they tarry till it may be presumed
by the course of Nature that it is Chan∣ged.
And those who are less Learned
in the 
Lunar
 Mutations, continue the
Fast for thirty days, being assured that
in that Period the Moon must fulfil her
course.


A Winter 
Ramadàn
 is very welcome
to the 
Moors,
 because their Labors are
not then so pressive, and better then to
be endured, by reason of the coldness of
the Season: and the Fast is not so affli∣ctive,
because the Days are short, and
the Nights long to Revel in.


Though this be the severest Precept
in the 
Mahumedan
 Law, yet it is not
without all capacities of Indulgence, for
therein is had special Regard to the
wayfaring and infirm, who have Licence
to eat in the day time, with this Caution,


That at the end of their Journey, and
upon their recovery from Sickness, they
perform the full account of their Lent.
As for the rest, they are enjoyned no
more then a diurnal Abstinence, having
the Night at liberty for all Fruitions
they can procure, Wine onely excepted,
which by those who at other times libe∣rally
drink it, is for this Moon totally
renounced. The breach of this First they
punish with Stoning to death, and there
is no necessity can Priviledge any (ex∣cept
Travellers and ins
 Persons) to
eat or drink till the Evening Star wit∣nesseth
that the Day is shut in.


They make great Provision for this

Ramadàn,
 wherewith they furnish out
their Necturnal Festivals; and for this
end, use a great Frugality before for
some days.


They place a great Sanctity in this Fast,
which yet to a Scrupulist scarce would
seem to deserve that name, for the Day
is usually past away in a loytering Slee∣piness,
and the Night in Junketing: the
one is at best but a drowzy Lent, and the
other a Luxurious Carnival. Yet there
is a devouter sort of 
Bygots,
 who spend


the Day in the Church and Devotion,
and are very reserved in their Nightly
Caresses, living for the whole Moon se∣perate
from Women, where they super∣erogate,
their Law no where exacting
this Severity▪ for such was the Carnal
Temper of their Prophet, that he thought
it an Impossibility to live a whole day
Continent. Both Sexes are bound to
begin this Fast at the twelfth Year of
their Age, and it is placed among the
Articles necessarily requisite to the Con∣stitution
of a perfect 
Mahumetan.


The last day of the Moon, the 
Moors

spend in doleful Lamentations of their
deceased Relations, and with their
Yearly Commemoratives end the Fast.






CHAP. XVII.


The Moresco Feasts.


AT the end of their Lent, 
Mahumed

instituted a Festival Solemnity, as
hath been imagined in imitation of the
Christians 
Ester.
 The 
Turks
 call it



Bairam;
 the 
Moors, El Ed Geer,
 or the
Little Feast: Little, not in respect of
its duration, but Expence; for it lasts
three days, which equals it in length
with any of the rest.


On the first day thereof they spread
the Floor of their 
Giámma
's with co∣loured
Leather, and then entertain each
other with Honey, sweet Butter, and
Wafers. And according to the per∣formance
of this Festival, they Divine,
as the 
Egyptians
 by their 
Nilescope,
 the
Blessings and Plenty of the descending
Year.


About two Moneths after, the 
Moors

have another Festival, by them called,

El Ed Gueber,
 or the Great Feast, in
respect of the Expences and Charges
thereof. This Festival still commenceth
with a Sermon, which the 
Alcalib
 or chief
Priest makes concerning its Institution,
with amplification of its Praises. Re∣turning
home from the Sermon, the

Moors
 fall to killing such Sheep as they
have made choice of for their Entertain∣ment
at this Solemnity, and there is not
the meanest Fortune, but now has his
Sheep which is killed, by cutting the


Throat thereof, with their Faces to∣wards

Mecha,
 and Swearing by 
Alquiblá.

This done, every Family takes the Heart
and Appurtenances, and immediatly
dress it with Saffron, red and black Pep∣per;
then, with store of Bread, they
bring it to their Parish Church (where
every Quality knows his station) and eat
it in Communion. Returning from this
Ecclesiastick Ordinary, they pass the
second and third Day in Eating and
Drinking. This is also called the Mut∣ton
Feast.


The next to this is their 
Ashorah,

which lasts but one Day, and call'd a
Feast of Fruits, nothing being then eat∣en
but Dates, Figs, purched Corn, and
all such natural Cates as their Substances
can procure. This Festival is not held
in 
Giámma
's, but every Father of a Fa∣mily
treats his Houshold under his own
Roof. And the rich on this day give a
Portion of their Estates to the Poor,
who on the Morning of the Festival go
from one 
Giámma
 to another, and re∣ceive
the Yearly Alms, which are pro∣portionably
divided amongst them. None
cast into this Treasury who have not a


certain sum of Money in Possession;
and he that has less then ten 
Metacáles

(which something exceeds our Five shil∣ling
Pieces) is exempt from this 
Corban.


At the receipt of these Alms, the Poor
pray that God would increase the Givers
store, and enable them to bestow more
the next 
Ashoráh,
 telling them, That
this fulfilling of the Law, is the best as∣surance
of rendring their Petitions suc∣cessful.


Anseràh
 is another 
Moresco
 Festival,
which lasts but a day; and with the 
An∣daluzian
Moors
 bears the Name of Saint

John Baptist
's, or the Feast of the Chri∣stians.
On this Festival, those who live
within ten Leagues of the Sea come thi∣ther
to wash themselves; and those who
cannot, by reason of distance, repair to
that great Monopoly of Waters, take
Salt and throw it into the Fountains at
home, and Bath themselves in that coun∣terfeit
Ocean. This is exactly at Mid∣summer,
and held in Commemoration of
that great Blessing of Water. The Vi∣ands
of this Feast exceed not their ordi∣nary
Provisions, only they eat them with
greater alacrity.




Mulud
 is the Yearly Feast for Circum∣cision,
and continueth three days; on
the first whereof, they make a 
Gátcha,

or Hodge-podge of Flower, Water,
Butter and Honey, and carry great
quantities thereof to the Church, whi∣ther
they invite one another, saying,

Come, let us go to the
 Allamdillah, 
or to
the Feast that is made to
 Mahumed 
for
Gods sake:
 And when they have eaten of
this homely Dish in the Church, they
leave store thereof to be devoured by the
Poor, and spend the two following days
in good Neighborhood and plentiful
Collations. This is their chiefest Feast,
because at it their Males are Circumci∣sed,
and may seem to have a reference
to the old 
Whitsuntide
 among the Chri∣stians.
But I forbear to swell these Re∣marks
with such Conjectural References,
which if I should enterprise, I might
make all 
Mahumeds
 Institutions yield
some probable Resemblances of those
ancient Customs & Ordinances in usage
among Jews and Christians; and shew,
that this great Deceiver has confused
both the Testaments into his 
Alcoran,
 la∣boring
thereby to have his first Pretensi∣ons


made creditable, That he came to
reconcile Jew and Christian unto the o∣bedience
of one and the same Law.


These 
Moresco
 Festivals seem not so
much Commemorative of received Mer∣cies,
as relaxatives of Corporeal Labors,
from which they are observed to have
no other Divertisements. For Cards
and Dice are utterly abhorr'd by the
better Families, not only as forbidden
by the Law, under the Infamous terms
of Diabolical Inventions, but as obser∣ved
to be occasions of many nocive Pas∣sions,
engendring Debates, and Incen∣tives
to Avarice: Besides, they are look'd
upon as Effeminate and Trivial Enter∣tainments,
fit onely for Sea-men, and
Women; the former being much vers'd
in this Idleness, though no such Asper∣sion
can be cast on the latter.








CHAP. XVIII.


Of the Moresco Pastimes, Mu∣sick,
Dancing, &c.


WHen the 
Moresco
 Gentry are dis∣posed
to Sports, the Wild Boar
fits them with a Manly Exercise, and af∣fords
them both Pastime and Improve∣ment;
and when in the failure of some
Circumstance they are debarr'd this kind
of Recreation, they supply it with their
Lances in Lusory Skirmishes on Horse∣back,
wherein their Dexterity cannot
be too much admired.


But they are naturally uninclin'd to
Sports, being very Saturnine, and loving
the Extremes, either to sit still, or to
be in robustious Motions. They spend
much of their Time in a sort of drowzy
Conference, but the sum of their Do∣mestick
Entertainments, are their Wo∣men
and their Chess-boards: All com∣municating
in the former, but the latter
is only the serious Pastime of the 
Vir∣tuoso
's.



They use Vocal and Instrumental Mu∣sick,
but in both are very serious and
plain, devoid of Levity or Flourish.
Their usual Instruments are the 
Rabèb

and 
Ahlùd;
 the former resembles our
Violin, but strung only with one great
Cord of Hair; the other a Getar. In

Fez
 they have Lutes, and those who will
teach them well. The 
Alárbs
 have an
Instrument call'd 
Zauphèn,
 like the bot∣tom
of a Kettle, on which they Tinckle
with a stick. The 
Tituanezes
 have a
less Organ, and also use a sort of Tabor
and Pipe when they march in the Field.
So most Towns have their peculiar sorts
of Musick. The singing part is per∣form'd
by 
Negra
's, not for any peculiar
Excellency they are happy in, but be∣cause
singing at publick Dances is look'd
upon as Slavish.


In their Dances they permit no mix∣ture
of Men with the marryed Women,
which is granted to the Virgins, who up∣on
some Solemnities Dance with the
Batchelors; but so closely Veild, that
not any part about them is seen naked.
They act the Tune with their Hands and
Head, and abhor as loose and lascivious,


Jigs, or high Dancing. Every Town and

Cavíla
 have their own Dances, which
are known by several Names. The 
Fes∣sians

have a Dance called 
Estitati,
 which
is used in 
Sally, Mekenèz, Alcazàr,
 &c.
Those of the City of 
Morocco
 have one
named 
Sholakebèr;
 and in the 
Cavíla
's
of 
Minchèl, Bemi-Wadres,
 &c. there is
a Dance stiled 
Ismmaháh.
 It seldom
happens that those of one Town know
the Dances of another, therefore thofe
who use this Divertisement, only know
the Name and Mode of the Dance where
they live.


Their set Times are their Weddings
and Yearly Festivals, the Marryed dan∣cing
on the Day, the Single in the Night.






CHAP. XVIII.


A Miscellaneous Chapter of the
temper of the Air, Diseases,
Medicine, Poysons, Education
of Children, Apparel, &c.


BEfore I shut up these Tumultuary
Remarks, I cannot but adde some


Miscellaneous Notes, occasionally col∣lected
from Discourse and Observation,
of whose Credit I have not many Argu∣ments
to render me dubious. The first
Notice concerns the Temperature of the
Air in this Part of 
Barbary,
 wherein
there is some Variation according to the
Site of the Places. At 
Fez,
 the Air in
Summer is more temperate then at 
Mo∣rocco.

The Inhabitants of the latter for
several Hours cannot endure the Heat a∣broad,
and therefore for that time keep
close within: But the People of the for∣mer
are by no such Excess constrain'd
to intermit their Labours. Albeit, as I
have observed in other Countrys, much
herein is to be imputed to Humor and
Custom.


The Inland Country is hotter in Sum∣mer,
and colder in Winter then the Ma∣ritine,
which may easily be conceived,
by considering what Neighborhood the
one hath with the Sea, the other with
the Mountains, which from 
December

to the latter end of 
February
 are co∣vered
with Snow; at the Resolution of
which, such Rivers are caused, that
in some places the Channels will yield


Water the whole Summer ensuing.


The Inhabitants live long, and are
generally Healthy; the Diseases, when
they happen, are Fluxes, after the Sea∣son
of Fruits; and Calentures, when
they immoderately Travel in the Sun.
And what seems herein remarkable, the
Winter (which Season consist of great
Rains) is most mortal amongst them.


The 
Lues Venerea,
 or Foul Disease
(which the 
Moors
 call 
Bubès)
 is incident
to those who accompany with variety of
Women: and though this may seem to
confine that Distemper to those 
Moors,

who live after a more rude and roving
manner, yet it is no stranger to those of
a more refin'd and setled Life, the Gran∣dees
of late having herein exceeded the
Paisants.


As to the Plague, they observe no set
time of its return, the tenth and fifteenth
Year of its coming being worn out of
Remarks; and in this last Century it
has hapned very seldom, but in no parts
it doth rage more furi usly then in 
Bar∣bary:

and when they are visited, the
Inhabitants take little or no care to a∣void
it, holding it to be inevitable.



In cure of Sicknesses, they use very
plain Medicines, and whatever be the
Disease, Cauterizing is first practised,
which they do with no more Art or Cu∣riosity,
then with a Knife red hot to gash
and cut the place where the Pain lies. To
cure the Head-ach, they take the Root

Tauz Argent
 and Rosemary, burning
them in an Earthen Pot, over which the
Diseased holds his Head for the Fume;
then binding the same in a Cloth about
the Head, present ease is given. This

Tauz Argent
 is a Root, much Celebrated
for an excellent and lasting Perfume:
there is great store thereof about 
Sally,

which is white within, without duskish
and streaked. The 
Moors
 use it in Air∣ing
and Perfuming their Rooms, but the
scent is much less durable then has been
reported.


The People, when sick, cure them∣selves
with Herbs, in whose Virtues the
common People have a traditional know∣ledge.
By this they supply the want of
Apothecaries and Physitians, of which
Profession none are found, except a few
Mountebank ignorant Jews.


The 
Moors
 have an Herb called 
la Ha∣lis,



which mingled with Honey, they
make up into Balls as big as Pistol Bul∣lets,
and of these they swallow five or six
at a time, which they find to procure
Appetite, further Digestion, and to
make Frolick, Amorous and Witty. 
O∣pium

is much used by all sorts, rather for
Dyet then Physick; and a 
Moor
 will
sooner buy a Pill of 
Opium,
 then a Cake
of Bread, if his stock be too little to buy
both. And in many places they are so
accustomed to this Stupefactive, that the
want thereof proves fatal.


In former Times the People were so
exquisite in mingling Poysons, that they
had some would kill by smell: Of late
they are acquainted only with two
kinds, which they call 
Rahásh
 and 
Ze∣him.

The former is either white or pale,
and more quick in dispatching the Per∣son
who takes it. But 
Zehim
 (signify∣ing
any thing that is coutrary to the Pa∣lat
or liking) is cured with incessant
Spitting. As for that Poyson which once
they had the Art to communicate in Let∣ters,
to kill those who read them, they
are thereof at present totally Igno∣rant.




Muley Mahumed
 having out of Politick
Ends prohibited Printing, made thereby
Writing of a more singular use and e∣steem;
and the 
Moors
 of old were noted
to be very excellent at the Pen, but now
in this, as in all other Learning, they are
much deficient of what they were for∣merly,
for there are not many that ar∣rive
to a higher Proficieney in Letters,
then barely to Write and Read: To
which end they have little Schools,
where the Children are taught after this
manner. The 
Moors
 having (as I said)
no Printed Books, when their Children
are sent to School, they take with them
pieces of Boards, or Slats, on which the
School-Master writes so many Letters of
the Alphabet; and when the Child has
learn'd their Names and Figures, the
Master writes them a certain number
more, and so proceeds till the Alphabet
be ended: and then goes on to write
some Periods of the 
Alcoran
 (for they
teach no other Book) and continue this
Method till the whole 
Alcoran
 be wrote
over, which usually lasts four Years.
When the Child has thus spelt it over, he
begins to get it by heart, which costs


eight Years at the least; then the Child,
if his Father be able, is taught a little
Orthography. When the Child is come
to certain Periods of the 
Alcoran,
 the
Father is obliged to make him a Congra∣tulatory
Present: and when he has
learn'd the whole 
Alcoran,
 he is brought
home to his Fathers House in Procession
on Horse-back. As he Rides along, he
holds a Table written with 
Mahumeds

Law, whereon he continually fixeth his
Eye, thereby signifying, That the Ho∣nor
conferr'd upon him was for the care∣ful
Reading of the 
Alcoran;
 and when
the Youth, accompanyed with the 
Al∣faqùi,

School-master, and School-fellows,
hath visited all the Churches, they come
to his Fathers House, where they are en∣tertain'd,
and the Master rewarded for
the care shewn in the Proficiency of his
Scholar.
