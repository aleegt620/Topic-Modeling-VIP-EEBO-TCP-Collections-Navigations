And this is the ordre of this boke / & the
thynges that ben spoken of.


ANd as to men desyryng / to haue
a very knowl

states of thynges / & those ben two. One
is fro the begynnȳge of the worlde vnto
Cryste / the whiche is called the state of
Diuiacion. The seconde is from Cryst
to the ende of the worlde / the whiche is
called the state of Reconsiliacōn. ¶The
seconde thynge is the diuysyon of tymes
and those ben thre. One is afore the la∣we
of Moyses / & an other is vnder the
lawe of Moyses / an other is vnder y

 la∣we
of grace after crist dyed. ¶The thyr¦de
is / the gouernynge of kyngdomes.
And as for that ye must knowe / that all
though there were foure pryncypal kyng¦domes
that is to saye. Of Babylon / of
Perfecs / of Grekis / & Romayns. Neuer

heles / as to y

 cours of the worlde / & the
ordre of holy scrypture / the fyrst gouer∣

was vnder faders / from Adam
vnto Moyses. The seconde / vnder Iug{is}
from Moyses vnto Saul. The thyrde / vnder
kynges / from Saul vnto Zoroba¦bel.
The fourth vn
 bysshops / from Zo¦robabel
vnto Cryst. ¶The fourth is y

dyuersyte of lawes / & those were fyue.
The fyrst was / the lawe of nature / and
that was comyn to all men. The secon∣de
is / the lawe or the custome of Genty¦les

 vnder kynge Nyno began
the people to worshyp fals goddes. The

lawe of Iewes / when Circumcisyon de¦uyded
the Iewes from other peple. The
fourth is / vnder Cryst / rose the lawe of
crysten men / whan fayth & grace of the
sacramentes / enformed the lyfe of men.
The fyfthe vnder Machomete / rose the
lawe of Sarrasyns & Turkes. ¶The
fyfth is / the noblenesse / or vnnoblenesse
in dedes. ¶And as to these / it is to kno∣we
that .vij. persones ben redde of / who∣me
the dedes many tymes are hadde in
mynde in hystoryes. That is to wyte / of
a prynce in his reame / of a knyght in ba¦

of a Iuge in his place / of a bysshop
in the clergy / of a polytyk man in the pe¦ple
/ of an husbonde man in y

wryten many tymes / the laudes of good
men / & the pnnysshementes of the cur∣syd
men. ¶The sixthe is the true coun∣tynge
of the yeres. And as to that / it is
to be knowe / that there were .viij. maner
of nombrynge / or coūtynge of the yeres.
Thre after the Hebrewes. Thre after y

one now after the crysten men. The she

at Marche / the whiche they vse in

from May begȳnynge whan they
wente from Egypt. they vse in theyr cro¦nycles

nombreth ther yeres thre manere of wy¦se.
Fyrst to the glory & Ioye of ther victo¦ry
/ counteth ther yeres from the destruc∣cyon
of Troy The fyrste / the seconde / the
thyrde / the fourth &. ¶Thenne af∣ter
the chyualry beganne at the hylle of
Olympus / they notefyed the yeres after
the same Olympiadū. And what Olym¦piades
is / ye shall knowe after in the bo¦ke.
The thyrde / whan they began to ha¦ue
lordshyp of all the worlde / they note∣fyed
ther yeres these maner of wyse. In
the yere of the regne of Grekys the .iiij.

of Machabeorr. ¶Theme after the Ro¦mayns
gouernynge the worlde / counted

¶The last of all Crysten men coun¦teth
ther yeres from the Incarnacyon of
Crist. And bycause we ben Crysten men


we vse moost to nombre / from the begȳ
nynge of the worlde / vnto Cryste was
borne. And fro Cryste was borne / vnto
our tyme. And this ordre is obserued &

Noe.




THis Noe was a ryghtwys man
and founde grace ayenst god

Whan Noe was fyue hondred yere of
aege / he had goten Cham. Sem. 
. I
∣phet.
That tyme by the cōmaundemen¦te
of god / he began to make a shyppe.
And he made it parfyt in an hondred ye¦re.
And the hondred yere complete 
 our
lorde god appered agayne to hym 
 cō∣maunded
hym / that he with his wyf &
his children / & the wyues of them shol∣de
entre the shyppe with all maner of
beestes / & all maner of foules also &c.
And anone the flood came and stode a∣boue
all hylles. 
v. cubytes (Vide plura¦gen̄.
vijus.) ¶After the flood a grete dron¦kenesse
betyde vnto Noe. And thorugh
occasyon of that dronkenesse be blessed
his two sones. Sem & Iaphet
 for the
faders honour that they had to hym &
for the honest shame / that they couered
mekely ther faders memb
es / whan he
was slepynge. And his sone Cham for
his scornynge and his vnreuerence he
cursyd. ¶And here after saynt Austyn
is made 
 the fyrste mencyon of bounda∣ge
/ and of noblynesse contrary to it. For
Noe sayd / y
•
 Cham sholde be seruaunt
in bondage to Sem & Iaphet / for his
vnreuerence. Neuertheles ye shall not


trowe / that all that descended of Cham
were vnnoble men & of no power. For
they began fyrst to be myghty men of y
•

erthe. As it is open of Nemroth & y
•
 kyn¦ge
of Canaan & Asco
. Nor all of Sem
& Iaphet were vertuous & noble & mygh¦ty
men / whan almoost eueryche one fell
in to y

 cryme of ydolatry / & were oft ty∣mes
oppressyd of other men. But this
blessynge & this cursynge hath a respect
to vertue & vyce / for y
•
 whiche a man is
called truely a noble man or an vnnoble
man. For he y
•
 is vertuous is a noble mā
& he y
•
 is vnuertuous is not noble. The
same maner of wyse / tho y
•
 foloweth the
fayth of Abrahā / rather were called his
childern than the Iewes / the whiche car¦nally
descended from hym. Neuertheles
they had a spirytuall preuylege of god / for
y

 & his blessynge. And
of these .iij. sones of Noe he beynge alyue

And they had on them thre prynces

many kyngdomes. And the moost

For whan mankynde grewe 

& men were prompte & redy to do 
.
it was very necessary to withstande the
greate malyce of the

good men. Therof a man is cal¦led
a gentylman / or a noble man as be¦fore

¶The seconde was y

 dyuers worshyp

of the people. For no man worshype


thenne / but as his naturall reason gaf.
And they knewe not ryghtwysly what
they sholde worshyp / all though they ly¦ued

were so dull of wytte / y

 they co

 comyn peple. Wherfore it was
expedyent for ther peas to be kepte / that
they sholde haue prynces of noble byrth

Albyon.










¶Afore that I wyll speke of Brute / it
shall be shewed / how the londe of Eng∣londe
was fyrst named Albion / and by
what encheson it was so named.


OF the noble londe of Si
ie / there
was a ryall kynge & myghty & a
man of grete renōmee / that called was
Dyoclesyan / that well & worthely hym
gouerned & ruled thrugh his noble chy∣ualry.
So that he conquered all the lon∣des
about hym / so that almoost all the
kynges of the worlde to hym were at∣tendaunt.
¶It befell thus / y
•
 this Dyo∣clesyan
spowsed a gentyll damoysell y
•

was wonder fayre / that was his emys
doughter Labana. And she loued hȳ as
reason wolde / so that he gate vpon her

xxxiij. doughters / of the whiche y
•
 eldest
was called Albine. And these damoysels
whan they came vnto aege became soo
fayre y
•
 it was wonder / wherof Dyocle∣syan
anone lete make a sompnynge / &
cōmaunded by his letters y
•
 all the kyn∣ges
that helde of hym sholde come at a
certayne daye / as in his letters were con¦teyned
to make a feest ryall. At whiche
daye thyther they came / & brought with
them Admyralles prynces & dukes / and
noble chyualry. The feest was ryally a∣rayed
/ and there they lyued in Ioye and
myrthe ynough / that it was wonder to
wyte. And it befell thus / that Dyoclesy∣an
thought to marye his doughters a∣monge
all tho kynges that were at that
solempnyte. ¶And so they spake & dy∣de
/ that Albine his eldest doughter & all
her systers rychely were maryed vnto
.xxxiij. kynges / that were lordes of gre∣te
honour and of power at this solemp∣nyte.
And whan the solempnyte was do¦ne
/ euery kynge toke his wyf and ladde
them in ther owne countree & there ma
de them quenes. ¶And it befell thus af¦terwarde
that this dame Albene beca∣me
so stoute & so sterne / that she tolde ly¦tyll
pryce of her lorde / and of hym had
scorne & despyte / and wolde not do his
wyll / but she wolde haue her owne wyll
in dyuers maters. And all her other sy∣sters
euerychone bare them soo euyll a∣yenst
ther lordes that it was wonder to
wyte. And for as moche y
•
 them thought
that ther husbondes were not of so hy∣ghe
parentage come as ther fader. But
those kinges that were ther lordes / wold
haue chastysed them with fayre manere
vpon all loue & frendshyp / y
•
 they sholde
amende ther selfwylled cōdycyons: But
al was for nought / for they dyde ther ow¦ne
wyll in all thynge that them lyked. &
had of power. Wherfore those .xxxiii. kȳ¦ges
vpon a tyme / and oft tyme. bete ther
wyues. For they wende. that they wolde
amende theyr tatches. and ther wycked∣nesse.
But of suche condycyons they we∣re
/ that for fayre speche and warnynge / the dyde
all the wors / and for betynges
eftsones moche the wors. Wherfore the
kynge that had wedded Albyne. wrote y
•

tatches and condycyons of hsi wyfe Al∣bine
/ and the lettre sente to Dyoclesyan
his fader. And whan the other kȳges her
de. that Albines lorde had sent a letter to
Dioclesian. anone they sente letters sea¦led
with ther seales. the condycyons and
tatches of ther wyues. Whan the kynge
Dioclesian sawe & herde so many playn¦tes
of his doughters. he was sore asha∣myd
/ and became wonder angrye and
wrothe towarde his doughters. and thou
ghte. how he thenne myghte amende it
that they so mysdyde. And anone sente
his letters vnto the .xxxiii. kynges. that
they sholde come to hym / and brynge w
t
 
theym theyr wyues euery chone att a cer¦teyne
daye. For he wolde there chastyse
theym of theyr wyckednesse / yf he my∣ghte
in ony manere wyse. Soo the kyn∣ges
came all atte that tyme and daye y
•

tho was sette betwene hym and the kin¦ges.
Dyoclesyan resceyued theym with
moche honoure / and made a solempne
feest to all that were vnderneth his lord∣shyp.


And the thyrde daye after that so∣lempnyte
/ the kynge Dyoclesyan sente
after his .xxxiij. doughters that they shol¦de
come & speke with hym in his cham∣bre.
And whan they were come / he spa∣ke
to them of ther wyckednesse & of ther
cruelte / & spyteuously them repreued &
blamed / and to them he sayd. That yf
they wolde not be chastysed / they sholde
his loue lese for euer more. And whan y
•

ladyes herde all this / they became abas∣shed
& gretely ashamed. And to ther fa∣der
they sayd / that they wolde make all
am
ndes / & so they departed out of ther
faders chambre. And dame Albine that
was the eldest syster ladde theym all to
her chambre / and tho made to voyde all
that were therin so that no persone was
amonge them but she and her systers to
gyder. ¶Tho sayd Albine. My fayr sy∣sters
/ well we knowe that the kyng our
fader vs hath reproued shamed and dis∣pysed
/ for by cause to make vs obedy∣ent
vnto our husbondes. But certes that
shall I neuer whyles that I lyue / syth y
•

I am come of a more hygher kyng{is} blo¦de
than myn husbonde. And whan she
had thus sayd / all her systers sayd the
same. And tho sayd Albine. Well I wo∣te
fayre systers that our husbondes ha∣ue
complayned vnto our fader vpon vs
wherfore he hath vs thus foule reproued
& dispysed / wherfore systers my coūsell
is / that this nyght whan our husbondes
ben a bedde / all we with one assente for
to kytte ther throtes / & thenne we may
be in peas of them. And better we mow
do this thynge vnder our faders power
than ouer where elles. And anone all the
ladyes consented and graunted to this
counsell. And whan nyght was comen / the
lordes and ladyes wente to bedde / And
anone as ther lordes were a slepe / they
kytte all theyr husbondes throtes / and
so they slewe them all. Whan that
Dyoclesyan theyr fader herde of this
thynge / he became furyously wrothe a∣gaynst
his doughters / and anone wolde
them all haue brente. But all y
•
 barons
& lordes of Sirrie counseyled not so for
to do suche streytnesse to his owne dou∣ghters
/ but oonly sholde voyde the londe
of them for euer more / so that they neuer
sholde come ayen / and so he dyde. And
Dyoclesyan that was ther fader anone
cōmaūded them to go in to shyppe and
delyuerd to them vytaylles for half are
re. And whan this was done all the sy∣sters
wente in to the shyppe and saylled
forth in the see / & betoke all ther frendes
to Apolin that was ther god. And so lon¦ge
they saylled in the see tyll at 
 last
they came and arryued in an 
 that
was all wyldernesse. And whan 

Albion was come to that londe & 

systers. This Albine wente fr
ste forth
out of the shyppe and sayd to her 

systers. For as moche sayd she as I am
the eldest syster of all this company 

fyrst this londe hath taken and 

moche as myn name is Alb
 

that this londe be called Alb
 

myn owne name. And anoue all 

sters graunted to her with a good 

Tho wente out all the systers of 

pe & tooke the londe Albron as 

ster called it. And there they wente 

downe / and founde neyther men 

man ne childe / but wylde beest
 of 

uerse kyndes. And whan the 

were dyspended & they fayled they 

de them with herbes and 
 in the
season of the yere and so they lyued as
they best myght. And after 
 they to∣ke
flesshe of dyuerse beestes and became
wonder fatte. And so they desyred man∣nes
company & mannes kynde y
•
 them
fayled. And for bere they wered wonder
courageous of kynde / so that they desy∣red
more mannes company than ony o∣ther
solace and myrthe. Whan the de∣uyll
that perceyued / wen
e by dyuerse
countrees and toke a body of the ay
 &
lykynge natures shad of men / & came


in to the londe of Albion / & laye by tho

wȳmen & shadde tho natures vpon them
& they conceyued / & after brought forth
gyaūtes. Of the whiche one was called
Gogmagog / & an other Longherigam
And so they were named by dyuers na∣mes
/ & in this maner they came forth &
were borne horryble gyaūtes in Albion
And they dwelled in caues & in hylles
at ther wyll. And had the londe of Al∣bion
as them lyked / vnto the tyme that
Brute arryued & came to Totnes / that
was in the yle of Albion. And there this
Brute conquered and scomfyted the gy∣auntes
aboue sayd.






¶Explicit prima pars.


¶Here begynneth now how Brute was
goten / & how he slewe fyrst his moder &
after his fader. And how he conquered
Albion that after he named Brytayne
after his owne name that now is callid
Englonde after the name of Engyst of
Sa
onte. ¶This Brute came in to
Brytayne about the .xviij. yere of Hely.


BE it knowen that in the noble cy¦te
of grete Troy / there was a no¦ble
knyght & a man of grete power that
was called Eneas. And whan the cyte
of Troy was loste & destroyed thorugh
them of Grece. This Eneas with all
his meyne fledde thens & came to Lom¦bardy.
That tho was lorde & gouernour
of y
•
 londe a kynge that was called La∣tyne.
And an other kyng there was that
was called Turocelyne / that strongely
warred vpon this kyng Latyne / that of∣tentymes
dyde hym moche harme. And
whan this kynge Latyne herde y
•
 Ene∣as
was come / he receyued hym with mo¦che
honour / & hym with helde for as mo¦che
as he had herde of hym / & wyst well
that he was a noble knyght & a worthy
of his body & of his dedes. This Ene∣as
helped kynge Latyne in his warre / 
And shortely for to telle / so well and so
worthely he dyde that he slewe Turoce∣lyne
/ and dyscomfyted hym and all his
people. And whan all this was done / kynge
Latyne gaaf all that londe that
was Turocelynes / to this noble man
Eneas in maryage w
t
 Lauyne his dou∣ghter
/ the moost fayrest creature that o∣ny
man wyst. And so they lyued togy∣der
in Ioye and myrthe all the dayes of
ther lyf tyme. ¶And after Ascanius so∣ne
to Eneas wedded a wyf / & vpon her
he gate a sone that was called Siluey∣ne.
And this Silueyne whan he coude
some reason of man / vnwetynge his fa∣der
and ayenst his wyll aqueynted hym
with a damoysell that was cosyn to La∣uyne
/ that was kynge Latynes dough∣ter
the quene that was Eneas wyf / and
brought the damoysell with childe. And
whan Ascanius his fader it wyst / ano∣ne
lete enquyre of the wysest maysters &
of the grettest clerkes / what childe the
damoysell sholde brynge forth / & they
answered and sayd / that she sholde bryn¦ge
forthe a sone that sholde kylle bothe
his fader & also his moder. And so he dy
de. For his moder deyed in berynge of
hym. And whan this childe was borne / his
fader lete calle hym Brute. And the
maysters sayd that he sholde do moche
harme and sorowe in many dyuers pla¦ces
/ and after he sholde come to greate
honour and worshyp. This kyng Asca∣nius
deyed whan god wolde / and Sil∣ueyne
his sone receyued the londe / and
made hym wonderly well beloued a∣monge
his people. And so whan Brute
that was Silueynes sone was .xv. yere
olde / he wente vpon a daye with his fa∣der
for to playe & solace. And as Brute
sholde haue shot vnto an herte / his aro∣we
myshapped & glaced / and so there
Brute slewe his fader.






¶How Brute was dryuen out of the lon¦de
/ & how he helde hym in Grece.



ANd whan this myschaslce was
befall / all the people of the lon∣de
made sorowe ynough & were sore an
angred And for encheson therof they dro¦ue
Brute out of the londe / & wolde not
suffre hym amonge them. And whan he
sawe that he myght not there abyde / he
wente from thens in to Grece / & there
he founde .vij. thousande men that we∣re
of the lygnage and kynrede of Troy
that were come of grete blood as the sto¦ry
telleth / as of men & wymmen & chil∣dern
/ the whiche were all holde in thral
dome & bondage of the kynge Pandras
of Grece / for the dethe of Achilles that
was betrayed & slayne at Troy. This
Brute was a wonder fayre man and a
stronge & a huge of his aege & of gladde
chere & semblaunt / and also worthy of
body / and was wel beloued amonge his
people. This kynge Pandras herde spe¦ke
of his goodnes & his condicyons / &
anone made hym dwelle with hym / soo
that Brute became wonder preuy & mo
che beloued with the kynge / so that lon∣ge
tyme Brute dwelled with the kynge
So at the last they of Troy and Brute
spake togyders of kynrede & of lygna∣ge
& of acquayntaunce / and there play∣ned
them vnto Brute of ther sorowe &
of ther bondage / and of many other sha¦mes
that the kynge Pandras had them
done. And vnto Brute they sayd vpon a
tyme. Ye be a lorde of our lygnage & a
stronge man & a myghty / ye be our capy¦tayne
& lorde / and gouernour / and we
wyll become your men / & your cōmaun∣dementes
do in all maner of thynges / &
brynge vs out of this wretchednesse and
bondage / and we wyll fyghte with the
kynge for trouthe with the grace of the
grete god / we shall hym ouercome / & we
shall make you kynge of the londe / and
to you do homage / and of you we shall
holde euer more. Brute had tho grete py
te of theyr bondage y
•
 they were brought
in. And pryuely wente theym from the
kynges courte / and tho them that were
of Troy / went & put them in to woodes
& in to mountaynes & them there helde
And sente vnto kynge Pandras / that he
sholde gyue them leue sauely for to wen¦de
out of the londe / for they wolde noo
lenger dwelle in his bondage. The kyn¦ge
Pandras wexed tho sore anoyed / and
tho swore that he sholde slee them euery∣chone
/ & ordeyned a grete power & wen∣te
towarde them all for to fyght. But
Brute & his men manly them defended
and fyersly fought & slewe all the kyn∣ges
men that none of them escaped and
toke the kynge & helde hym in person / &
ordeyned coūsell bytwene them 

they myght done. And some sayd 

he sholde be put to deth / and some 

that he sholde be exiled out of the londe
And some sayd / that he sholde be 

te. And tho spake a wyse 
yght that
was called Mempris and sayd to 

te & to all tho of Troy. Yf kynge 

dras wolde yelde hym & haue his lyf. I
counseyll that he gyue vnto Brute that
is our duke & our souerayne his dough∣ter
Gennogen to a wyf / & in 

with her an hondred shyppes well 

de / and all his tresoure of golde 

of come and of wyne and as mocke as
we nede to haue of 00 thynge and other
And thenne go we out of this londe 

ordeyne vs a londe elles where. For we
ne none of our kynrede that come after
vs shall neuer haue peas in this londe
amonge theym of Grece. For we haue
slayne soo many of ther 
u
ghtes and
of other frendes that euermore wa

and contake sholde be amonge vs. Bru¦te
tho and all his folke consented well
to that counseyll. And this thynge they
tolde to kynge Pandras. And he for to
haue his lyf graunted as moche as they
axed / and anone gaf vnto Brute Gen∣nogen
his doughter to wyf and an bon¦dred
shyppes w
t
 asmoche as them neded
of all vytaylles / as afore was ordeyned


Brute tho toke his wyf & all his men / 
that forsoke the londe of Grece & went
them vnto the see & had wynde & weder
at ther wyll / and came the thyrde daye
in to an Ile that was called Lorgres.
This Brute anone sente of his men a
londe for to espye the maner of the coū∣tree.
And they foūde an olde cyte all wa¦sted
& forlet / that nas therin nother man
ne woman / ne no thynge dwellynge / &
in the myddell of this cyte they foun∣de
an olde temple of a fayre lady y
t
 was
called Dyana the goddesse. And they ca¦me
ayen vnto Brute & tolde hym what
they had seen & founde. And they coun∣selled
hym to go & do sacrefyce vnto da¦me
Dyana / for she was wonte to yeue
answere of what thynge that euer men
prayed her / and namely vnto them that
her honoured with sacrefyce. Brute wen¦te
vnto that ymage and sayd. Dyana
noble goddesse that all thynge haste in
thy myght and power / wyndes / waters.
wodes / feldes / and all thynge of the
worlde / and all manere of beestes that
therin ben. To you I make my prayer / that
ye me counseyll and telle / where / and
in what place. I shall haue a coue∣nable
dwellynge for me and for my peo¦ple
/ and there I shall make in honour
of you a well fayre temple and a noble / wherin
ye shall alwaye be honoured / Whan
he had done his prayer. Dyana
answered in this maner Brute sayd she
go euen forth thy waye ouer the see in
to Fraunce towarde the west / and there
ye shall fynde an yle that is called Al∣byon
/ and that yle is becompassed all w
t
 
the see / and no man may come therin
but it be by shyppes / and in that londe
were wonte to dwelle gyaūtes / but now
it is not so / but all wyldernes. And that
londe is destenyed and ordeyned for you
and for your people.






¶How Corin became Brutes man / &
how kynge Goffar was dyscomfyted.


THenne whan Brute had this an¦swere
of Dyana y
•
 goddes. Ano¦ne
he lete the ancres wynde vp & sayled
in to the hyghe see. And whan he & his
men had saylled .xx. dayes & moo / they
foūde fast besyde a cost of the see a thou¦sande
men of the lygnage & kynrede of
Troy. And ther souerayne & ther may∣ster
of all was called Corin. And whan
Brute wyst whens they were / he tho to∣ke
them with moche Ioye in to his shyp¦pes
/ and ladde theym forth with hym.
This Corin there became Brutes man
& to hym dyde homage. And so longe
they saylled forth in the see tyll they ca∣me
vnto Gascoyne. And anone they ar¦ryued
in the hauen of Lyegers / & there
they dwelled .viij. dayes them for to rest.
& ther saylles to amende there y
•
 it was
nede. Tydynges soone came to kynge
Goffer that was lorde of that londe
how that moche people of straūge londe
were arryued in to his londe in the ha∣uen
of Lyegers wherfore he was sore an¦gred
& anoyed / that they came and arry∣ued
in his londe withoute his lycence &
his leue. And anone ordened hym a gre∣te
power for to dryue out Brute & to de∣stroye
hym & all his people. But it was
so that kyng Goffar was dyscomfyted
& all his people. And hymself fledde in¦to
Fraūce / there for helpe & socour. And
in that tyme regned in Fraunce .xij. kyn¦ges
/ and an .xi. of them assembled a gre∣te
power for to helpe Goffar & for to
fyght ayenst Brute. This Goffar dwel¦led
with them of Fraunce half a yere &
more. And in the meane tyme whan
Goffar was in Fraunce. Brute and his
company destroyed all the londe of Gas¦coyne
/ and lete take all the tresour that
kynge Goffar had / & there lete brynge
it all in to his shyppes. And this Brute
founde in that londe a fayry place and
couenable / & there Brute made a fayre
castell and a stronge. ¶Whan that this
was done / kynge Goffar came from


Fraūce & .xi. kynges with hym & brough¦te

self & of Turin his cosyn / and of Corin
that well & manly hym defended / and
fought so tyll that lytell tyme they had
slayne of the F
nshmen two thousande
& mo. Anone all y
•
 were a lyue fledde a∣waye.
And in this batayll Turin Bru∣tes
cosyn was slayne. And Brute lete en
tere hym worthely whan he had space &
leyser in the castell that he had made / &
tho lete calle that same castell Toures / for
by cause of the name of Turin that
there was entered. And yet vnto this
daye there is a noble cyte that is called
Toures. And kynge Goffar wyst that
Turin was deed he came agayne with
his men / & after yaue a stronge katayll
vnto Brute. But Brute & his men we∣re
so wery for fyghtynge / y
t
 they myght
no lenger endure / but to megre hym and
all his. And thenne Brute yede in to his
castell with his men / and made the ga∣tes
faste for to saue them / and for to ca∣ke
coūsell amonge them what were best
for to do. Brute and Corin gaf counsell
and ordeyned pryuely / that Corin sholde
go out and busshe hym in a wood tyl on
the morne / so y
•
 in the mornynge whan
that Brute sholde fyght with his enne∣myes
/ thenne Corin sholde come with
his folke in the one syde / and slee and
do all the harme that he myght. And in
a mornynge in the dawnynge of the day
Brute wente out of the castell / and fyer¦sely
faught with his enmyes / and they
manly deffended them. But within a
lytell tyme Brute and his folke slewe
.viij. hondred of kynge Goffars men.
thenne came Corin with the busshement
and smote to grounde he & his compa∣ny
all those that wolde stonde or abyde.
so that the kynge Goffar & his compa∣ny
were dyscomfyted / & fast they began
to flee. And Brute and Corin with ther
company fyersely them pursewed / & sle∣we
mo of them in the fleynge than they
dyde in the batayll. And in this manere
Brute had the victory. And neuertheles
Brute made moche sorowe for his cosyn
Turin that there was slayne / and other
also that he had lost of his men. That
is to saye .vij. hondred and .xv. The whi¦che
nobly he entered in the same castell
of Toures / there where he had entered
Turin his cosyn.






¶How Brute arryued at Totnesse in
the Yle thenne called Albion and of the
batayll that was betwixt Corin Gog¦magog.


SO whan all this was done Bru¦te
wolde no lenger there dwelle / for
to fyght / nor for to lese no moo of
his people. For kynge Goffars people
myght euery daye encreace moo & moo.
And Brutes lessened. And therfore he
toke all his men and wente vnto the see
and hadde wynde and weder atte theyr
wyll. And the fyfth daye after they arry¦ued
in an hauen at Totnesse / and came
in to the yle of Albion. And there ney∣ther
man nor woman as the storytelle

they founde but Gyauntes. And they
dwelled in hylles & in caues. And Bru∣te
sawe the londe was fayre and at his
lykynge. And was good also for hym
and for all his people / as Dyana the
goddesse had hym be
yght. And therfo∣re
was Brute wonder gladde / and lete
assembled vpon a daye all his folke / to
make a solempne sacrefyce and a grete
feest in honour and reuerence of Dya∣na
the goddesse / of the whiche he hadde
counseyll fyrst for to come in to this lon¦de.
And thenne whan that they hadde
ther solempnyce done / as they vppon a
daye sate at ther meete / there came in vp¦on
them .xxx. gyaūtes & slewe of Brutes


men .xxx. Brute and his men anone
sterte vp and faught with the gyauntes
and slewe them euerychone / excepte one
that was called Gogmagog. And he
was mayster of all the Gyauntes. And
he was stronger and hygher than ony of
the other. And Brute kepte hym for by¦cause
that he sholde wrestyll with Corin
that was Brutes man. For he was gre∣ter
and hygher than ony of Brutes men
from the gyrdelstede vpwarde. ¶Gog∣magog
and Corin vndertoke there for
to wrestyll. And so togyders they wente / and
wrestlyd a longe tyme / but at the
last Gogmagog Helde Corin soo fast
that he brake two rybbes of his syde / Wherfore
Corin was sore angry. And
there he toke Gogmagog betwixt his
armes and cast hym downe vpon a ro∣che
/ so that Gogmagog brake all to pe∣ces
/and so he deyed an euyll dethe. And
therfore y
e
 place is called vnto this daye
the saut of Gogmagog. ¶And thenne
after Brute yaue all that countree vnto
Corin. And there Corin called it after
his name Cornewayle. And his men be
called Cornewaylles / and so sholde men
of that countree be called for euermore / And
in that coūtree dwelled Corin and
his men. And they made townes and
houses / and enhabyted the londe by ther
owne wyll.






¶How Brute buylded London / and cal¦led
this londe Brytayne / and Scotlon∣de
Albyne. / and Walys Camber.




¶London.




BRute & his men wente forth / and
lawe abowte in dyuers places / where
that they myghte fynde a good
place and couenable / that they myghte
make a cyte for hym and for his folke.
And so at the laste they came by a fayre
Ryuer that is called Tamys / and the∣re
Brute began to buylde a fayre cyte / and
lete calle it newe Troy / in mynde
and remembraunce of the grete Troy / from
the whiche place all ther lygnage
was comen. And this Brute lete felle
downe woodes / and lete eere and sowe
londes / and also lete mawe downe me∣dowes
for sustenaunce of hym and of
all his people. And thenne he departed
the londe to theym / so that eueryche of
theym had a parte / and a certayne place
for to dwelle in. And thenne Brute lete
calle all this londe Brytayne after his
owne name / and his folke he lete calle
Brytons. And this Brute had goten on
his wyf Gennogen thre sones / that we∣re
worthy of dedes. The fyrste was cal∣led
Lotrin / the seconde Albanak / & the


thyrde Cambar. And Brute bare crow∣ne
in the cyte of Troy .xx. yere after y

 ty¦me
that the cyte was made. And there he
made the lawe
 y
•
 the Brytons holde / &
this Brute was wonderly well beloued
among all men. And Brutes sones also
loued wonderly wel togyder. And whan
Brute had sought all y
•
 londe in length
& also in brede he foūde a londe y
•
 Ioy∣ned
to Brytayne / that was in the northe
and that londe Brute yaue to Albanak
his sone. And lete calle it Albanie after
his name / that now is called Scotlonde
And Brute foūde an other coūtree to∣warde
the west / & yaue that to Cambar
his other sone / and lete calle it Cambar
after his name / & now is called Walys.
And whan Brute had regned .xx. yere
as before is sayd / thenne he deyed in the
cyte of newe Troy.






¶How Lotrin that was Brutes sone
entred with moche honour / & gouerned
the londe well & worthely.


AFter Brute regned Lotrin his
sone / that was the seconde kyng
in Brytayne. The whiche began to reg¦ne
the seconde yere of Samuell. And
this Lotrin was crowned kyng with mo¦che
solempnyte & glory of all the londe
of Brytayne. And after whan he was
crowned kynge. Albanak and Cambar
his two brethern went agayn in to ther
owne coūtree and there they lyued with
moche honour & worshyp. And Lotrin
ther brother regned / & was kynge & go∣uerned
it well and wysely / for he was a
good man & wonderly well beloued of
all his londe. And it befell so that Alba¦nak
dwelled in his owne londe with mo¦che
honour & worshyp. And thenne ca∣me
kynge Humbar of Hunlonde with a
grete power & aryued in Albyne / & wol¦de
haue conquered the londe / & began to
warre vpon kynge Albanak / and hym
slewe in batall. Whan Albanak was
slayne / the people of that londe fledde
vnto Lotrin & tolde hym for he was kyn¦ge
of Brytayne / how that his brother
was slayne / & prayed hym of his helpe
and of his socour for to auenge his bro∣thers
deth. Lotrin there anone lete assem¦ble
all the Brytons of Kente / of Douer
in to Derewent of Northfolke & South¦folke
/ of Keftefen / and Lyndessey. And
whan they were assembled they spedde
them faste towarde ther enemyes for to
yeue them batayll. And Lotrin had sent
to Cambar his brother that he sholde co¦me
vnto hym with all the power that he
myght make hym for to helpe / & so he
dyde with a good wyll. And so they ca∣me
togyders / & toke ther ware p
ely
for to go and seke Humbar where they
myght hym fynde. And so it befell that
this Humbar was besyde a water that
was a grete ryuer with his folke 

for to dysporte. And there came Lotrin
& Cambar his brother with all ther peo¦ple
sodaynly or that ony of that other
wyst. And whan Humbar sawe them co¦me
he was sore adiadde / for as moche
as his men wyste it not afore / and also
they were vnarmed. And anone Hum¦bar
for drede lepte in to the water and
drowned hymself and so he deyed and
his men were all slayne so that no
e of
them escaped. And therfore is that wa∣ter
called Humbar / and euer more shall
be / for by cause that this kynge Hum∣bar
therin was drowned. ¶And after
that Lotrin wente to his shyppes & to∣ke
there golde and syluer as moche as
he founde vnto hymself. And all that o∣ther
pylfre he gaaf vnto other folke of
the hoste. And they founde in one of the
shyppes a fayr damoysell that was kyn¦ge
Humbars doughter / & she was called
Estrylde. And whan Lotrin sawe her / he
toke her with hym for her fayrnessse / And
for her he was ou
er taken in lone.
& wolde haue wedded her. This tydyn∣ges
came to Corin / and anone thought


to auenge hym vpon Lotrin. For as mo¦che
as Lotrin had made couenaūt for to
spowse Corins doughter / that was cal∣led
Guentolin. And Corin in hast wen¦te
vnto hym vnto newe Troy / & thus
he sayd to Lotrin. Now certes sayd he / ye
rewarde me full euyll / for all the pay¦nes
that I haue suffred & had many ty∣mes
for Brute your fader. And therfore
syth it is so I wyl auenge me now vpon
you. And he drewe his fawcon on hygh
and wolde haue slayne this Lotrin the
kynge. But the damoysell wente bytwe¦ne
tho and made them to be accorded in
this manere. That Lotrin sholde wed∣de
or spowse Guentolin that was Co∣rins
doughter / & so Lotrin dyd. And ne∣theles
whan that he had spowsed Guen¦tolin
Corins doughter / pryuely he came
to Estrylde / & brought her with childe / &
gate vpon her a doughter / the whiche
was called Abram. And it befell so that
anone after Corin deyed / & after whan
he was deed. Lotrin forsoke Guentolin
that was his wyf / and made Estrylde
quene. And there Guentolin that was
his wyf wente from thens all in greate
yre & wrathe vnto Cornewayle / & there
seased all the londe in to her owne hon∣de
/ for as moche as she was her faders
heyre she vndertoke feautes and homa∣ges
of all the men of the londe. And af∣terwarde
assembled a grete hoste and a
grete power of men / for to be auenged
vpon Lotrin that was her lorde / and to
hym came & yaue hym a stronge batayl
and there was Lotrin her husbonde slay¦ne
and his men dyscomfyted / in the .v.
yere of his regne. Guentolin lete take
Estrylde and Abram her doughter / and
bounde them bothe honde & foot / & cast
them bothe in to a water / & so they we∣re
drowned. Wherfore that water was
euer more after called Abram / after the
name of the damoysell that was Estryl¦des
doughter. And Englysshe men call
that water Seuerne / & Walshmen call
it Abram vnto this daye to. And whan
this was done Guentolin lete crowne
her quene of all the londe / & gouerned
the londe full well & wysely vnto the ty¦me
y
•
 Madan her sone that Lotrin had
goten vpon her was of .xx. yere of age / y
•

he myght be kynge / & so the quene reg∣ned
.xv. yere. And thenne lete she crowne
her sone kynge / and he regned & gouer∣ned
the londe well & worthely. And she
wente in to Cornewayle / and there she
dwelled all her lyues tyme.

¶Of kynge Leyr sone to Bladud / and
of the answere of his yongest doughter / that
gracyously was maryed to the kyn¦ge
of Fraunce.


AFter kyng Bladud regned Leyr
his sone. And this Leyr made y
•

towne of Leycetre / & lete calle the towne
after his name / & he gouerned y
•
 towne
well & nobly. This kyng Leyr had thre
doughters. The fyrst was called Gono¦rill.
The seconde Rigan. And the thyrd
Cordeill / and the yongest doughter was
fayrest & best of condicyons. The kyng
ther fader became an olde man / & wolde
y
•
 his doughters were maryed or y
•
 he dy¦ed.
But fyrst he thought to assaye which
of them loued hym moost & best. For she
y
•
 loued hym best sholde best be maryed
And he axed of the fyrst doughter how
well she loued hym. And she answered &
sayd / better than her owne lyf. Now cer¦tes
sayd her fader / that is a grete loue / Thenne
he axed the seconde doughter / how
moche she loued hym And she sayd
more & passynge all the creatures of the
worlde. Per ma foy sayde her fader I
may no more axe. And sho axed he of y
•

thyrde doughter / how moche she loued
hym. Certes fader sayd she / my systers
haue tolde you glosynge wordes / but I
shall tell you the truth / for I loue you
as I ought 
 loue my fader. And for to

ynge you more in certayne how I loue
you. I shall tell you. As moche as ye be
which / so shall ye he loued. The kynge
her fader wende y
•
 she had scorned hym / &
became wonder worthe / & swore by he¦uen
& erthe she sholde neuer haue good
of hym / but his doughters y
•
 loued hym
so moche sholde be well auaunced & ma¦ryed.
And the fyrst doughter he maryed
to Mangles kynge of Scotlonde. And
the seconde he maryed to Hanemos erle
of Cornewayle. And they ordened & spa¦ke
bytwene them y
•
 they sholde departe
the reame bytwene theym two after the
dethe of kynge Leyr ther fader / so that
Cordeill his yongest doughter sholde no
thynge haue of his londe. But this Cor¦deill
was wonder fayre & of good condi¦cyons
and maners. That the kynge of
Fraunce Agampe herde of her fame / &
sente to the kynge Leyr her fader for to
haue her vnto his wyf / and prayed hym
therof. And kynge Leyr her fader sent

hym worde y
•
 he had departed his londe
& yeuen it all vnto his two doughters be¦fore
sayd / & he sayd he had no more lon¦de
wherwith her to marye. And whan
Agampe the kyng of Fraūce herde this
answere / he scute anone ayen to Leyr
and sayd. That he axed no thynge with
her but oonly her clothynge & her body.
And anone kyng Leyr sente her ouer see
to the kynge of Fraunce. And he recey∣ued
her with moche worshyp / and with
solempnyte he spowsed her / and made
her quene of Fraunce.






¶How kynge Leyr was dryuen oute of
his londe thorugh his folke. And how
Cordeill his yongest doughter halpe hȳ
in his nede.


THus it befell afterwarde / that
the two eldest 
 wolde
not abyde tyll Leyr her fader was deed.


but warred vppon hym whyles that he
was on lyue / & dyde hym moche sorowe
& shame / wherfore they toke from hym
holy the reame / & bytwene them had or¦deyned
/ y
•
 one of them sholde haue kyng
Leyr to soiourne all his lyfe tyme with
.lx. knyghtes & squyres / that he myght
worshypfully ryde & go whether that he
wolde / & in to what countree that hym
lyked to playe & to solace. So that Mau¦gles
kynge of Scotlonde hadde kynge
Leyr with hym in the maner as is abo∣ue
sayd. And or the other half yere were
passed. Gonorill y
t
 was his eldest dough¦ter
& quene of Scotlonde / was so anoy∣ed
of hym & of his people / that anone
she & her lorde spake togyder / wherfore
his knyghtes half & his squyres fro hȳ
were gone / & no moo lefth with hym but
oonly .xxx. And whan this was doue / Leyr
began to make moche sorowe for
by cause that his state was empeyred.
And men had of hym more scorne & de∣spyte
than euer they had before. Wherfo¦re
he wyst not what to done. And at the
last thought that he wolde go in to Cor¦newayll
to Rigan his other doughter.
And whan he was come / the erle & his
wyf that was Leyrs doughter hym wel∣comed
/ & with hym made moche Ioye / And
there he dwelled with .xxx. knygh∣tes
& squyres. And he had not dwelled
scarsly .xij. monethes there / y
•
 his dough∣ter
of hȳ was wery & his company. And
her lorde & she of hym had grete scorne
& despyte / so that from .xxx. knyghtes
they brought vnto .x. And afterwarde
had he but fyue / & so they lefte hym no
moo. Thenne made he sorowe ynough.
and sayd sore wepynge. Alas that euer I
came in to this londe & sayd. Yet had it
be better to haue dwelled with my fyrst
doughter. And anone he wente thens to
his fyrste doughter ayen / but anone as
she sawe hym come / she swore by god &
by his holy name / and by as moche as
she myght / that he sholde haue no moo
with hym but one kynght / yf he wolde
there abyde. Then began Leyr to wepe,
and made moche sorowe / and sayd tho.
Alas / now haue I to longe lyued / that
this sorowe and myscheyf is to me now
fallen. For now I am poore / that some∣tyme
was ryche. But now haue I noo
frende ne kynne that to me wyll do ony
good. But whan I was ryche all men
me honoured & worshyped / and now eue¦ry
man hath of me scorne and despyte.
And now I well wote that Cordeyll my
yongest doughter sayd me trouth / whan
she sayd. As moche as I had soo moche
sholde I be loued. And all the whyle y
•

I had good / so longe was I loued and
honoured for my ryches. But m
 two
doughters glosed me tho
 now of me
they sette lytell pryce. And soth tolde me
Cordeill / but I wolde not byleue it ne vn¦derstonde.
& therfore I lete her go fro me
as a thynge that I sette lytell pryce of
& now wote I neuer what for to do f
th
my two doughters haue me thus decey¦ued
/ that I so moche loued & now must
I nedes seke her that is in an other 

/ that lyghtely I lete her go from me
without ony rewarde of yeftes. And she
sayd / that she loued me as moche as she
ought to loue her fader by all maner of
reason. And tho I sholde haue ared 
er
no more. And those that me otherwyse
behoteth thorugh ther fals speche
 now
haue me desceyued. In this maner Leyr
longe tyme began to make his moone
And at the last he shope hym to the se

and passed ouer in to Fraunce and ared
and aspyed where the quene myght be
founde. And men tolde hym where she
was. And whan he came to the cyte that
she was in pryuely he sent his squy
e vn¦to
the quene / for to telle her that her fa∣der
was come to her for grete nede. And
whan the squyre came to the quene / he
tolde her euery deale of her systers from
the begynnynge vnto the ende. Cordeill
the quene anone tooke golde and syluer


plente / & tohe it to the squyre in coūsell
that he sholde go & bere it to her fader / &
that he sholde go in to certayne cyte / &
hym aray & wasshe / & thenne come aye

to her. And brynge with hym an honest
company of knyghtes .xl. at the lest with
ther meyne. And thenne he sholde sende
to her lorde the kyng / & feyne that he we
re come for to spehe with his doughter / &
hym for to see & so he dyde. And whan
the kynge & the quene herde that they ca¦me
/ with moche honour they hym recey∣ued.
And the kynge of Fraunce tho lete
sende thorugh all his reame / & cōmaun∣ded
that all men sholde be as entendant
to kynge Leyr the quenes fader in all
maner of thynges as if were vnto hym∣self.
Whan kynge Leyr had dwelled the¦re
a moneth & more he tolde to the hyn¦ge
and to the quene his doughter / how
his two eldest doughters hadde hym ser¦ued.
Agampe anone lete ordeyne a grete
hoste of Frenshmen and sente in to Bry
cayne with Leyr the quenes fader for to
conquere his londe ayen & his kyngdom
And Cordeill also came with her fader
in to Brytayne / for to haue the reame
after her faders dethe. And anone they
wente to shyppe & passed the see and ca∣me
in to Brytayne and fought with the
felons / and them scomfyted and slewe / And
tho had he his londe ayen / & after
lyued thre yere & helde his reame in peas
and afterwarde deyed. And so Cordeill
his doughter thenne lete entre hym with
moche honour at Leycestre.

neuer they rested tyll they had her taken
and put her vnto deth. And tho Morgan
& Conedag seased all the londe / & de∣parted

Morgan wolde haue all the londe from
beyonde Humbre that Conedag helde / But
he came agaynst hym with a grete
power / so that Morgan durst not abyde
but fledde awaye in to Walys. And Co¦nedag
pursued hym / and toke hym and
slewe hym. And tho came Conedag a∣gayne
and seased all the londe in to his

¶And by cause the matere conteyneth

knowen / what tyme of the worlde the
kynges folowen regned. Therfore they
shall be togyder / tyll it be comen vnto
Guentolen kynge of Brytayne / now

¶How Reynolde that was Conedag

sone regned after his fader / & in his ty∣me
it rayned blood thre dayes in toke∣nynge
of grete deth.


ANd after this Conedag regned
Reynolde his sone / y
t
 was a wy∣se
knyght & an hardy & 
urteys / y
t
 well
& nobly gouerned the londe / & wonder
well made hym beloued of all maner of
folke. And in his tyme rayned blood y

lasted thre dayes. As god wolde & soone
after ther came a grete dethe of people / For
hostes withoute nombre of people
fought / tyll that almyghty god therof
toke mercy & pyte & tho gan it cesse. And
this Reynolde regned .xxij. yere & deyed
and lyeth at Yorke.






¶How Gorbodian regned in yeas that
was Reynoldes sone.


AFter this Reynold that was Co∣nedags
sone / regned Gorbodi∣an
y
•
 was this Reynoldes sone .xv. yere / and
thenne he deyed & lyeth at Yorke.






¶How Gorbodian had .ij. sones & how
that one slewe y
e
 other for to haue y
•
 be
y¦tage
/ & how Ydoyne ther moder slew
 y
•

other / whefore the londe was destroyed.


SO whan this Gorbodian was
deed / his two sones that he had / 
became stoute & proude / and euer war∣red
togyder for the londe. And that one
was called Ferres / and that other Por∣res.
And this Ferres wolde haue all the
londe / but that other wolde not suffre
hym. This Ferres had a felonous herte
& thought thrugh treason to slee his bro¦ther.
But pryuely he wente in to Fraun¦ce
/ and there abode with the kynge Sy∣warde
tyll vpon a tyme whan be came


ayen / & fought with his brother Ferres / But
ful euyll it happed tho / for he was
slayne fyrst. Whan Ydoyne ther moder
wyst that Pours was deed / she made
grete sorowe / for by cause that she loued
hym more than y

 other. And thoughte
hym for to slee pryuely. And pryuely she
came to her sone vpon a nyght w

 two
knyues & therwith kytte his throte / and
the body in to smale peces. Who herde
euer suche a cursyd moder / that slewe w
t

her owne hondes her owne sone. And
longe tyme after lasted the repreef & sha¦me
to the moder / that for by cause of y
t

one sone she murdred the other / and so
lost them bothe.






¶How foure kynges curtously helde
all Brytayne / and what were ther na∣mes
ye shall here after.


AS the two brethern were deed / they
lefte not behynde them no∣ther
sone ne doughter / ne none other of
the kynrede that myght haue the heryta¦ge.
And for as moche as y
•
 strongest men
droue & scomfyted the feblest & toke all
ther londes / so y
t
 in euery countree they
had grete warre & stryf vnder them / but
amonge all other thynges / there were a∣monge
them in the coūtree / y
t
 ouercame
all y
t
 other / & thrugh ther myght & stren∣gthe
they toke all the londes / & euery of
them toke a certayne countree / & in his
coūtree lete calle hȳ kyng / & one of them
was called Scater / & he was kynge of
Scotlonde / & y
t
 other was called Dawa
her / & he was kynge of Loegers / & of all
the londe y
t
 was Lotrins / that was But¦tes
sone / the thyrde was called Rudac / &
he was kynge of Walys / & the fourth
was called Cloten / & was called kynge
of Cornewayle. But this Cloten sholde
haue had all the londe by reason / for by
cause that there was no man that wyst
none so ryght an heyre as he was. But
they that were strongest lette lytell by
them that were of lesse estate / & therfore
this Cloten had no more londe amonge
them but Cornewaylle.






¶Of kynge Donebant that was Clo∣tens
sone wanne the londe.


THis Cloten had a sone that was
called Donebant / that after the
deth of his fader became an hardy man
and a fayr & a curteys / so that he passed
all the other kynges of fayrenesse & of
worthynesse / & anone as he was knyght
he wyst well y
t
 whan his fader lyued / he
was moost ryghtful heyre of all the lon¦de
/ and sholde haue had by reason. But
the other kynges that were of a moche
more strenghte than he was / toke from
hym his londe. And afterwarde this
Donebant ordened hym a grete power / &
conquered fyrst all y
•
 londe of Loegers
& after he wolde haue conquered all the
londe of Scotlonde & Walys. And Sca¦ter
came with his men & yaue hym ba∣tayll.
And Rudac came ayen with his
Walysshmen for to helpe hym. But so

it befell that Rudac was slayne / & also
Scater in playne batayll. And so Do∣nebant
had the vyctory / & conquered all
the londe / & well mayntened it in peas
and in quyete / that neuer before it was
so well mayntened.






¶How Donebant was the fyrst kynge
that euer bare crowne of golde in Bry∣tayne.


THis Donebant lete make hym a
crowne of golde / & wered y
•
 crow¦ne
vpon his heed as neuer kyng dyde be¦fore
/ & he ordened a statute / y
•
 & a man
had done neuer so moche harme & myzt
come in to the Temple / there sholde no
man hym mysdo / but go there in sauete
& in peas / and after go in to what lon∣de
or coūtree that hym pleased without
ony harme / and yf ony man sette ony


honde vpon hym / he thenne sholde lese
his lyf. And this Donebant made the
towne of Malmesbury / and the towne
also of the Vyse. And whan he had reg∣ned
well & worthely .xi. yere / thenne he
deyed & lyeth at newe Troy.






¶How Brenne and Belin departed by
twene them the londe after the dethe of
Donebant ther fader. And of the war∣re
betwixt them.


ANd after y
t
 this Donebant was
deed / his sones y
•
 he had depar∣ted
the londe bytwene them / as ther fad{er}
had ordeyned / so that Belin his eldest
sone had all y
•
 londe of Brytayne from
Humber Southwarde. And his brother
Brenne had all the lond from Humber
vnto Scotlonde. ¶But for as moche y
t

Belin had the better parte. Brenne ther¦fore
wexed wroth / and wolde haue had
more of the londe / & Belin his brother
wolde graunte hym no more / wherfore
cōtake & warre arose amonge them two
But Brenne the yonger brother had no
myght ne strength ayenst Belin / & ther¦fore
Brenne thrugh coūsell of his folke
wente from thens in to Norweye to the
kyng Olsynges / & prayed hym of helpe
& socour for to conquere all the londe vp¦on
Belin his brother / vpon y
t
 couenaūt
that he wolde haue his doughter to wyf
& the kynge Olsynges hym graunted / And
Belin anone as his brod{er} was gone
to Norweye he seased in to his honde all
the londe of Northumberlonde / & toke
all the castelles & lete them he arrayed &
kepte the costes of the see / that Brenne
sholde not arryue in no syde / but that he
were taken. ¶The kynge Olsynges le¦te
assemble a grete hoste / and delyuered
his doughter to Brenne & all the people
that he had assembled. And this damoy¦sell
Samie had longe tyme loued a kyn¦ge
that was called Gutlagh / & to hym
she tolde all her counsell / how y
t
 Brenne
sholde her haue / and her lede with hym
for euer more / and so he sholde lese her
but that she myght forsake Brene. And
whan Gutlagh had herde this tydyn∣ges
/ he lay for to aspye Brenne with as
many shyppes as he myght haue. Soo
the two fletes mette togyder / & longe ty∣me
they faught / soo that Brennes men
tourned ayen & were dyscomfyted. And
kynge Gutlagh toke Samie & put her
in to his shyppe. And Brenne shame∣fully
fledde thens as a man dyscomfy∣ted.
And this kynge Gutlagh wolde ha¦ue
gone in to his owne coūtree / but the∣re
came vpon hym suche a grete tempest
that fyue dayes lasted / so that thorugh
that tempest he was dryuen in to Bry∣tayne
with thre shyppes & no moo and
tho that kepte the costes of the see toke
Gutlagh & Samie & all his folke and
them presented to Belin. And Belin
put them in pryson.






¶How Belin droue out of his londe kȳ¦ge
Gutlach of Denmark & Samie.


IT was not longe after y
t
 Brenne
came agayne with a grete nauy / and
sente to his brother Belin / that be
sholde yelde ayen his londe to his wyse
and his folke / and his castelles also. O
elles
he wolde destroye his londe. ¶Be∣lin
dradde noo thynge his malyce and
wolde no thynge do after that he hadde
sayd. Wherfore Brenne came with his
folke and fought with Belin. And then
Brenne was dyscomfyted and his fol∣ke
slayne / and hymself fledde with .xij.
men in to Fraunce. And this Belin that
was Brennes brother wente thenne to
Yorke / and toke counseyll what he shol∣de
do with kynge Gutlagh. For kynge
Gutlagh profered to become his man / and
for to holde his londe of hym / yel∣dynge
yerely. M.li. of syluer for euermo¦re
/ & for surenesse of this couenaūt to be
kep
e. Gutlagh sholde brynge hȳ good


hostage / & to hȳ sholde do homage & his
folke / & yet he sholde swere vpon a boke
y
t
 it sholde neuer be broke ne fayled. Be¦lin
tho by coūseyll of his folke graūted
hym his arynge / & so Gutlagh became
his man. And Belin vndertoke of hym
his homage by an othe & by wrytynge y
e

same couenaūtes. And vpon these coue∣naūtes
kynge Gutlagh toke Samie &
his folke & went thens / & torned ayen to
Denmark. Euer more after were the co¦uenauntes
holden & the treuage payed / tyll
the tyme that Honelus was kyng of
Denmark & also of this londe thorugh
his wyf Gildeburh that he had spoused
for she was ryghte heyre of this londe.
¶This Belin dwelled tho in peas / &
worshypfully hym helde amonge his ba¦rons
& he made foure ryall wayes / one
from the eest in to the weest / & that was
called Watlynge strete / & an other from
the north vnto the south / & that is called
Ikelme strete. And two other wayes he
made in bossynge thrugh out the londe
that one is called Fosse / & y
t
 other Fosse
dyke. And he mayntened well the good
lawes y
t
 Donebant his fad{er} had made.
& ordened in his tyme / as before is sayd






¶How acordement was made bytwene
Brenne and Belin thorugh Cornewen¦ther
moder.


BRenne that was Belins brother
had longe tyme dwelled in Fraū¦ce
/ & there had conquered a greate lord∣shyp
thrugh maryage. For he was duke
of Bourgoyne thorugh the doughter of
the duke Fewyn y
t
 he had spoused y
t
 was
ryght heyre of y
e
 londe. And this Bren∣ne
ordened a grete power of his folke / &
also of Fraūce / & came in to this londe
for to fygh with Belin his brother. And
Belin came ayenst hym with a grete po¦wer
of Brytons / & wolde tho haue ye∣
en
hym batayll. But ther moder Cor∣
ewen
that tho lyued 
had
 herde y
•
 that
one brother wolde haue destroyed that
other / & went bytwene her sones & the

made acorde with moche payne So that
at the last tho two brethern with moche
blysse wente togyder in to new Troy / that
now is called London / & there they
dwelled a yere. And after they toke ther
coūseyll for to go & conquere all Fraūce.
& so they dyde / and brente townes & de∣stroyed
the londe bothe in lengthe & in
brede. And the kynge of Fraunce yaue
them batayl with his power / but he was
ouercome / & yaue truage vnto Belin &
to his brother. And after y
t

¶Here begynneth the sixte aege durynge to the ende of the worlde.






THat daye our lorde Ihesu Cryste
was borne / a welle of oyle beyon¦de Tybre by Rome 
sprange & ranne al
daye. The golden ymage fell the which
Romulus had made / & put it in his pa∣lays
sayenge. This ymage shal not fay¦le
vnto a mayde bere a childe. ¶Whan
Herode disposid hym to slee the children
of Israel / he was cōmaūded by the letter
of themperour to come to Rome to an∣swere
to the accusacyon of his childern
Alexiū. & Aristoboli. And ther were thre
Herodes gretly spoken of for ther yll de¦des.
The fyrst was called Ascolonita / &
vnder this man was borne Cryst / & the
childern of Israel were slayne. The se∣conde
was called Antipas sone to y
e
 fyr¦ste
Herode / vnder whom Iohn Baptyst
heeded / & Cryst suffred deth. And y
e
 thyr¦de
was called Agrippa sone to Aristobo¦li
/ sone to the fyrste Herode / the whiche
slewe Iames & prysoned Peter. The fyr¦ste
Herode whan he sawe his sones A∣lexiū
& Aristoboli thrugh the pretens of
his letter by the Emperour sende / stryue
for y
e
 successyon of his kyngdom / he di∣sposid
& made Antipater that was his
fyrste begoten sone to be before them / &
whan they were talkynge of the deth of
ther fad{er} he cast them awaye / & they wen¦te
to themperour to cōplayne of y
E
 wron¦ge
of ther fad{er}. And in y
e
 meane tyme the
thre kynges of Coleyne came by Herode
vnto Ierusalem / & whan they came not
ayen by hȳ / he thought y
t
 they were asha¦med
for to come ayen by hym for bycau¦se
y
t
 they were disceyued / & y
t
 they foūde
not the childe as he demed / therfore in
the meane season he cessed to slee y
e
 chil∣dern
of Israell / & so wente vnto Rome
for the cytacion of themperour. And he
toke his waye by y
e
 cyte of Tarsū / whe¦re
he brente the shyppes in y
e
 whiche the
thre kyng{is} of Coleyne sholde haue sayl¦led
in to ther owne coūtree. Then after
a yere & certen dayes / this Herode came
from Rome ayen / accorded w
t
 his sones


And for the confyrmacōn of his kyng∣dome
he was made moche bolder / and
then he slewe all the childern of Beth∣leem
y
t
 were of two yere of aege & vnder
that had space of one nyght of aege / &
amonge these was there one of his ow∣ne
childern. And Aristoboli & Alexiū we¦re
had in suspeccion / in so moche as they
promysed a barbour a grete rewarde y
t

he sholde take & kytte ther faders thro∣te
whan that he dyde hym shaue. And
whan this Herode herde this he was gre¦ued
& there he slewe both his sones. And
Herode Agrippa his sone he ordeyned to
be kyng. Wherfore Antipater his oldest
sone was about to poyson his fader / the
whiche Herode Agrippa vnderstode / &
prysoned there his brother / that whiche
the Emperour herde & sayd that he had
leuer be an hogge of Herodes / than for
to be one of his sones / for his hogges he
spareth / and his sones he sleeth. ¶And
whan that Herode was .lxx. yere of aege
he was stryken with a grete syknesse in
his hondes & in his feet & in his mem∣bres
/ that no leche myght come to hym
for stenche / & so he deyed. ¶So Antipa∣ter
his sone in pryson herde telle of this
and Ioyed gretely / and there fore that
cause he was slayne. Thenne stroue Ar¦chelaus
& Herodes for the successyon of
the fyrst Herode. The Emperour there
thrugh counseyll of the Senatours / the
half of the Iury & Idumea gaaf to Ar∣chelaus
vnder name of Tetrarche. And
the other parte he deuyded in two. Ga∣lylee
he gaaf to Herode Antippa. And
Ituriam and Traconidem he gaaf to
Philyppe Herodes brother. ¶And that
same yere Cryste came from Egypte / And
Archelaus was accused many ty∣mes
of the Iewes / and was exyled in to
Vyennam in to Fraūce. And in that pla¦ce
were sette foure Tetrarchees / to the
repreuynge of the vnstablynesse of the Ie¦wes.
¶And that same yere Octauyan
the Emperour deyed.

about this tyme. ¶Valeri{us} Grace{us} was

this childe of his moders name & his bel¦syre

of his lefull wyf had goten a childe

this lefull goten childe as they proce∣ded
in aege exceded this bastarde Pyla∣tus
he was full of euuye / & slewe his bro¦ther
the lefull goten childe. Wherfore


forth with his fader sente hym to Rome
for pledge for his trybute y
t
 he payed to
Rome / entendynge he wolde neuer rede∣me
hym. In the whiche tyme the kyng{is}
sone of Fraūce was pledge for his trybu¦te
/ the whiche exceded hym in strengthe
& chyualry also he slewe hym. Therfor
the Romayns sente Pylate as a profyta¦ble
man for the comyn wele to the yle of

slewe euery Iuge that came to them
And he y

of the Iury vnder hym. And this ty∣me
Pylate gadred moche moneye / & He
rode not knowynge / he wente to Rome
that he myght receyue of the Emperour
that Herode had gyuen hym. Wherfore
Herode & Pylate were enmyes togyder / vnto
the passyon of our lorde / whan y
t

Pylate sende Ihesus vnto Herode clo∣thed
in a whyte clothe / thenne they were
made frendes. ¶Ouidius Naso in Pon¦to

of his exyle. ¶Tyberius this tyme
was Emperour at Rome / & he regned
xxiij. yere / & he lyued in the yere that our

This man was in all his werkes

trusted in Cryste / & worshyped hym for

cruell ayenst people / but it was a grete
reason of pyte / that he was euer gracy∣ous
to his subgettes & poore men. And
he had peas all his dayes / & all the peo∣ple
that sayd ayenst crysten folke with
oute ony mercy he destroyed / & he exyled
Pylate for euer. Thenne he decessed & a

they made it after the Resurreccyon of

Mathia was chose bytwene the daye of
the Ascencyon & Wytsondaye in the pla¦ce
of Iudas Scaryot the traytour / of the
whiche Iudas in a history is redde thus.
¶There was a certen man in Ierusalē

 childe was bor¦ne
& called Iudas / his fader & his mod{er}
abhorred as well to slee ther childe / as to
nourysshe a traytour to the kynge & all
his people / thefore they put hym in to a
panyer / or a lepe in to y
e
 see / & he flowed
to the yle of Scaryoth / where y
e
 lady of
y
t
 place had no childe by her husbonde / &
she feyned her to be wich childe / but
she fayled. And after in a lytell season
the same lady & quene conceyued a chil∣de
of her husbonde / & whan y
t
 he was of
aege. Iudas many tymes angred hym &
caused hym to wepe / the whiche the que∣ne
sawe / & bete Iudas many tymes / &
after she knowledged y
t
 Iudas was not
the kynges sone ne hers / wherfore Iu∣das
slewe the kynges sone / & he dradde
the payne of the lawe / & fledde w

 certen
exiles to Ierusalem. And whan he came
there / he gate hym in to Pylates courte
that was Iuge. And by cause y
t
 oo cursyd
man draweth to an other / therfore he


drewe to Pylate & stode gretly in his fa∣uour.
And vpon a certen daye whan Py¦late
loked out of his palays in to an or∣charde
of a mānes y

 was called Ruben
y
t
 was very fader to Iudas. Pylate desy∣red
to haue apples / & Iudas went to ga¦dre
apples / & Ruben ranne to Iudas for

this Iudas smote his fad{er} on the heed w

a stone & slewe hȳ / & Iudas 
fled
 awaye
secretly after y

Ruben dyed sodenly. Then Pylate gat
to Iudas all the goodes y

Ciborea Rubens wyf / y

 was moder to
Iudas. And he dealed not curtesly with
her as a man sholde w

t
 she was maryed ayenst

And how fals he was to Cryst / it ne¦deth
not to reherce. ¶And y

noster. Thenne after he came to An¦tiochiam
& there he abode .vij. yere te∣chynge
the way of trouth. And Spmon
Magus he confounded awaye. That
season he preched to the people that we∣re
circsscysed / the whiche were in Ponto
of Galati. Capadocia. Asia. Bithinia.
Thenne herde he that Symon Magus
deluded the Romayns / thrugh the loue
of the fayth / he came to Rome in the
fourth yere of Claudius the Emperour
And there he preached the worde of god / &
shewed the falshede of Symon Mag{us}
and tourned many a man to the fayth / Thenne
he sende his precher by dyuerse
prouynces / by whome crysten relygyon
was myghtely encreased. ¶He ordeyned
the feest of Lenton afore Eester / & Ad∣uent
/ & the Emerynge dayes to be fasted
of all crysten people / in to the myrrour
of the fyrste & seconde comynge of oure
lorde Ihesu. ¶Thenne whan he had be

and .viij. dayes / he was slayne of Nero
(Ei{us} pl̄a o{per}a vide ac

) ¶Ga¦ius
this tyme was Emperour at Rome
& regned .iij. yere & .x. monethes. This
Gai{us} was fyrst bicyous in lyurnge / for
two of his owne systers he mysused / &
on one of them he gate a doughter / whi¦che
childe he sette betwixt y

 knees of Iu¦pyter
in the temple / & feyned afterwar∣de
y

 Iupyter had goten her. Wherfore
he dyde crye thrugh the coūtree that all
men sholde worshyp her as a goddesse / This
man also made an ymage lyke
hymself / & sente it to one Patronie Pre∣sydent
at Ierusalem vnder y

 he sholde compell
the Iewes to do worshyp therto. And fo¦re
these enormytees & many other / our

in his owne Palays.






¶Of kynge Gynder that was Kymba¦lyns
sone / that wolde not paye the trua∣ge
to Rome for the londe that Cassybo¦lon
had graunted / and how he was slay¦ne
of a Romayne.


ANd after y
•
 deth of this Kymba∣lyn
regned Gynder his sone a
good man & a worthy / & was of so hygh
herte y
•
 he wolde not pay to Rome y
•
 try¦bute
that kynge Cassybolon had graū∣ted
vnto Iulius Cezar. Wherfore them
perour y
•
 was tho / that was called Clau¦dius
Cezar was sore anoyed. And ordey¦ned
a grete power of Romayns / & ca∣me
in to this londe for to conquere the
trybute thrugh strength / & for to haue it
on the kynge. But this kynge Gynder
and Arinager his broder assembled and



 a grete hoste 
 of Brotons
& yaue batayll to the Emperour Claw¦dius
/ & slewe of y
•
 Romayns grete plen∣te.
The Emperour had afterwarde one
that was called Hamon y
•
 sawe the peo¦ple
there were fast slayne / & pryuely cast
awaye his owne armes / & toke y
•
 armes
of a deed Bryton / and armed hym with
his armour / & came in to the bataylle to
the kyuge & sayd in this maner. Syr be
of a good herte for goddes loue / for the
Romayns that ben your enmyes anone
shall be slayne & dyscomfyted euerycho∣ne.
And the kynge gaaf no kepe to his
wordes / ne to his speche / for by cause of
the armes that he had vpon hym / and de
myd that he had ben a Bryton. But the
traytour euer helde hym next the kynge
And pryuely vnder the sholder of his ar¦mes
he smote the kynge / wherfore the
kynge deyed & felle downe to the erthe / ¶
Whan Armager sawe his brother so
deed / he caste awaye his armes and toke
to hym his brothers armes / & came in
to the batayll amonges the brytons and
hadde them hetfly for to fyght / and fast¦laye
a downe the Romayns. And for the
armes they wende it had be kyng Gyn¦der
that afore was slayne / y
•
 they wyst
not. Thenne began the Brytons fyersly
for to fyght / & slewe the Romayns. So
at the laste the Emperour forsoke the
felde / and fledde as fast as they myght
with his folke in to Wynchestre. And
the fals traytour Hamon that had slay∣ne
the kynge / fast anone beganne for to
slee with al the hast that he myght. And
Armager the kynges brother pursued
hym full fyersely with a fyers herte / &
droue hym vnto a water & there he to∣ke
hym. And anone smote of bothe hon¦de
and feet & heed / and he
ed the body
all to pyeces / and thenne lete cast hym
in to the water. Wherfore y
•
 water was
called Hamons hauen. And after there
was made a fayre towne that yet ston∣deth
/ that is called Southampton. And
after Armager wente to Wynchestre for
to seke Claudius Cezar the Emperour
of Rome. And there Armager hym to∣ke.
And Claudius themperour thorugh
counseyll of the Romayns that were w
t
 
hym lefte a lyue / made peas with Arma¦ger
in this maner as ye shal here. That
is to saye. How that Claudius the Em∣perour
sholde yeue vnto Armager Gen¦nen
his fayre doughter for to haue vnto
his wyf. Soo that this londe from that
tyme forwarde sholde be in the Empe∣rours
power of Rome / vpon suche coue∣naunt
/ that neuer afterwarde no Em∣perour
of Rome sholde take none other
trybute of this londe / but oonly frauce.
And they were accorded. And vpon this
couenaunt Claudius Cezar sente to Ro¦me
for his doughter Gennen. And as
she was come Claudius Cezar yaf her
vnto Armager to wyf. And Armager
spowsed her at London with moche so∣lempnyte
and mythe. And thenne was
Armager crowned and made kynge of
Brytayne.






¶Of kynge Armager in whose tyme
saynt Peter preched in Antioche with o∣ther
apostles in dyuers coūtrees.


THis Armager regned well and
worthely / and gouerned the lon∣de
ryght worshypfully. ¶And Claudi∣us
Cezar in remembraunce of this ac∣corde
/ and for reuerence and honoure of
his doughter / made in this londe a fay∣re
towne and a castell / and lete calle the
towne after his name Claucestren / the
whiche now is called Gloucestre. And
thenne whan all this was done the Em¦perour
toke his leue / and then̄e wente to
Rome ayen. And Armager thenne was
kynge / and gouerned the londe wel and
worthely all his lyues tyme. And this
Armager gate a sone on his wyte whi∣che
was called Westmer. And whyle that
this Armager regned / saynt Peter pre∣ched


in Anthioche. And there he made a
noble chirche. In the whiche he sate fyr∣ste
in his chayre. And there he dwelled
.vij. yere. And after he wente to Rome / and
was made pope / tyll that Nero the
Emperour lete martyr hym. And then
preched openly all the apostles in dyuer∣se
londes the ryght fayth. ¶And whan
Armager hadde regned .xxiiij. yere / he
deyed / and lyeth at the auncyente cyte
of London.






¶How kynge Westmer gaf to Beryn∣ger
an ylonde forlet. And there this Be¦rynger
made the towne of Berwyke.


ANd after this Armager regned
his sone Westmer / that was a
good man & a worthy of body / & well
gouerned the londe. It befell so y
t
 tydyn∣ges
came to hym vpon a daye / that the
kynge Roderyk of Gascoyne was co∣me
in to this londe with an hughe hoste
of people / & was dwellynge in Stanys
more. And whan kynge Westmer herde
those tydynges / he lete assemble an huge
hoste of Brytons / & came to the kynge
Roderyk & yaue hym batayll. And kyn∣ge
Westmer slewe kynge Roderyk with
his owne hondes in playne bataylle.
And whan kynge Roderyks men sawe
that ther lorde was slayne / they yelded
them all to kynge Westmer / & became
his men for euer more. And he gaf them
a coūtree that was forleten wherin they
myght dwelle. And thyther they wente
& dwelled there all theyr lyues tyme / &
.ix. hondred men there were of theym &
no moo lefte at that batayll. Theyr go¦uernour
& prynce was called Berynger
And anone he began a towne that they
myght therin dwelle & haue resorte / and
lete calle the towne Berwyk vpon Twe¦de.
And there they enhabyted & became
ryche. But they had no wȳmen amon∣ge
them / & the Brytons wolde not yeue
theyr doughters to the straūgers. Wher∣fore
they wente ouer see in to Irlonde / &
brought with them wȳmen / & there
they them spowsed. But the men coude
not vnderstonde theyr langage ne y
•
 spe¦che
of these wȳmen / & therfore they spa∣ke
togyder as Scottes. And afterwarde
thrugh chaūgynge ther langage / in all
Fraūce they were called thenne Scottes
& soo sholde the folkes of that countree
be called for euer more.






¶How kynge Westmer lete arere a sto∣ne
in the entrynge of Westmerlonde / there
that he slewe Roderyk / and there
he began fyrst housynge.


ANd after this batayll that is a∣boue
sayd whan Roderyk was
deed / kynge Westmer in remembraūce
of his victory lete arere there besyde the
waye a grete stone on hygh / & yet it ston¦deth
/ & euer more shall stonde. And he le
te graue in the stone letters y
t
 thus sayd
The kynge Westmer of Brytayne sle∣we
in this place Roderyk his enemye / ¶
And this Westmer was the fyrst that
buylded hous & towne in Westmerlon∣de
/ & at that stone begynneth Westmer∣londe
/ that Westmer lete calle after his
owne name. And whan Westmer had so
done / he dwelled all his lyf tyme in that
coūtree of Westmerlonde / for he loued y
t

coūtree more than ony other coūtree / &
whan he had regned .xxv. yere / he deyed
and lyeth at Karleyll.






¶Of kynge Coill that was Westmers
sone that helde his londe in peas all his
lyues tyme.


AFter this / his sone kynge Coill
regned / a good man and a wor∣thy
/ and of good condycyons / and well
gouerned his londe. And of all men he
hadde loue and peas. And in his tyme
was neuer contake / debate / nor warre in
Brytayne. And he regned & was kynge


in 
 all his lyues tyme. And whan
he had regned .xi. yere he deyed & lyeth

CLaudius was Emperour at Ro∣me
next after Gai

.xiiij. yere & .viij. dayes. This man
came in to grete Brytayne now called

And after grete bataylles ther was
bytwene the Emperour Claudius & Ar¦mager
kyng of Brytayne. And after ac¦cordement
made / y

 this armager sholde
wedde Claudius doughter / & after they

CLetus a martyr was pope .xi. yere
This Cletus was a Romayn / &
gretly he loued pylgrymages to sayntes

of mannes soule to visyte the place that
saynt Peter was in / than for to fast two
yere. He cursyd all tho men lettynge su∣che
pylgrymages / or counsellers contra∣ry
therto. At the last he was martryd by
Damician the Emperour. ¶Titus so∣ne
to Vespasianus was Emperour this
tyme and regned thre yere. And he abo∣de
styll at Ierusalem after the eleccyon
of his fader and destroyed the cyte. And
slewe there as the storye sayth with ba∣tayll
and hungre .xi. hondred thousan∣de
Iewes. And a hondred thousande he
toke and solde .xxx. for a peny. By cau∣se
they solde Cryste for .xxx. pens / and
brought thens all thynge that was pre∣cyous
/ and put them in his hous at Ro∣me
/ whiche was called Templū pacis / But
now is that place falle downe for
the moost party / and all these grete Ie∣welles
ben dystrybuted to certayne chir∣ches
in Rome. ¶This Titus was so
full of vertue that all men loued hym / soo
ferforth / that they called hym the
moost delectable of men. He was full ly¦berall
to all men / in soo moche that he
sayd often tymes / that there sholde noo
man go from an Emperour with an he¦uy
herte / but he sholde somwhat haue of
his petycyon. He wolde be sory that daye
in the whiche he had graunted no man


no benefyte. ¶Whan that he was deed.
euery man that was in Rome wept for
hym / as that they had loste theyr fader.
¶Domician brother to Titus regned
after hym .xxiiij. yere and .v. monethes
Fyrst he was easy / and afterwarde full
vnresonable. For moche of the Senate
was destroyed by his malyce / and also
moche of his kynrede. He began the se∣conde
persecucōn after Nero ayenst cry∣sten
men / in the whiche persecucyon Io¦han
the Euangelyst was exiled in to Pa¦thius
after the Emperour had put hym
in to a tonne of oyle brennynge & hurte
hym not. So this man was not the fo∣lower
of his fader Vespasian / ne his bro¦ther
Titus / but rather lyke Nero & his

he was slayne in his owne palays
at Rome in the .xxvij. yere of his aege / ¶

Linus and Cletus sholde be popes a∣fore
hym / leest that thrugh that ensam∣ple
prelates sholde ordeyne vnder them
who some euer they wolde. This man
made the lyfe of martyrs to be wryten

He ordeyned that a childe sholde be con∣fermed

was martred vnder Traian. ¶Nerua
was Emperour after Domician oo ye∣re

to be kepte sholde be broken / By
the whiche meane saynt Iohan the
Euangelyst was losed out of his exyle / &
suffred to come ayen to Ephase. This
man dyde an other thynge ryght comen¦dable
that he assyned so wyse a man as
Traian was to gouerne the people af∣ter
hym. ¶Nota. ¶Traian{us} His∣panicus
was Emperour .xix. yere. This
Traianus many man sayd. He was the
best amonge all the Emperours / but in
one thynge alone he was vicyous. In so
moche as he for the loue of the fals god¦des
was abowte to destroye the crysten
fayth. Iugynge in hymselfe so moost to
please god. Some men saye not by hym
self but by other he pursewed the crysten
fayth / and in the ende of his lyf he dyde
but fewe to deth. And all his louynge I
sette at nought. But at saynt Gregory
meued with pyte wepynge / and prayed
vnto our lorde for hym / that he wolde ha¦ue
mercy vpon hym / & by his prayer ha∣ue
hym out of helle / in to whiche place
he was dampned. And now yf that he
be saued or not / a grete alteracyon is a∣monge

Cronycles / it is no parte of our charge
to determyn. But all the eest parte of the
worlde. Babylon. Selencia / the vtter
partes of the Ynde. Germayne the se∣conde
after Alexander he helde vnder.
In all these thynges so pyteous and so
mekely he guyded hym to euery man as
a kyng. He was gentyll / and to no man
vngentyll / the whiche is redde of fewe / All
his dayes he lyued / that men sayd
he was the moost worthy man in all his
Empyre. And thought & sayd euer mo∣re

THis kyng Lucie had none heyre

grete harme & sorowe to the lon∣de.
For after this kynge Lucies deth / no∣ne
of the grete lordes of the londe wolde
suffre an other to be kynge / but lyued in
warre & debate amonges themself .l. ye¦re
without kynge. But it befell after∣warde
y
t
 a grete prynce came from Ro∣me
in to this londe that was called Se¦uerie
/ not for to warre / but for to saue y
e

ryght of Rome. But neuertheles he had
not dwelled half a yere in this londe but
that y

 Brytons slewe hym. And whan
they of Rome wyst that Seueri was so
slayne / they sente an other grete lorde in

was a stronge man & a myghty of body
& dwelled in this londe longe tyme and
dyde moche sorowe to the Brytons. So
that after for pure malyce / they chose a
kynge amonge theym that was called
Astelepades. And assembled a grete host
of Brytons / & wente to London to seke
Allec / and there they foūde hym & slewe
hym & al his felowes. And one that was
called Walon deffended hym fyersly / &
fought longe with the Brytons / but at

toke hym and bonde his hondes &
feet and cast hym in to a water. Wher∣fore
y
t
 water was called euer more Wal¦broke.
¶Tho regned Astelepades in
peas / tyll one of his Exles that was cal∣led
Coill made a fayr towne ayenst the
kynges wyll / & lete calle the towne Col∣chestre
after his owne name. Wherfore
the kynge was full wroth & thought to
destroy hym. And began to warre vpon
hym and brought grete power of men &
yaaf the Erle batayll. And the Erle de∣fended
hym fyersly with his power and
slewe the kynge hymself in that batayll
And tho was Coill crowned and made


kynge of this londe. This Coill regned

the kynge Coill for to chalenge the try∣bute
that was wonte to be payed to Ro∣me.
And the kynge answered well & wy¦sely
& sayd / y
t
 he wolde paye to Rome al
that ryght & reason wolde w

And so they accorded tho with good wyl
and without ony contake. And so bothe
they dwelled togyder in loue. ¶Kynge

And truly dyde vnto them of Rome all

mysbyleue that he myght there fynde / And
tho was he made Emperour and
was a good man and gouerned hym so
well that all londes to hym were atten¦daunt
for to be vnder his gouernaunce
¶And this deuyll and tyraun Marence
that tyme was in the londe of Grece &
herde these tydynges and sodeynly beca¦me
wood / and sodeynly he deyed and so
he ended his lyf. ¶Whan Constantyne
wente from this londe vnto Rome / he
tooke with hym his moder Eleyne / for
the moche wysedome that she coude / &
thre other grete lordes that be moost lo∣ued
/ that one was called Hoell an an o∣ther
was called Taberne / & the thyrde
Morhin. And toke all his londe to kepe
vnto the Erle of Comewayle that was
called Octauian. And so anone as this
Octauian wyste that his lorde dwelled
at Rome. Incontynent he seased all the
londe in to his honde / and therwith dy∣de
all his wyll amonge hyghe & lowe / &
they helde hym for kyng. ¶Whan these
tydynges came to Constantyne the Em¦perour


/ he was wonder wrothe towarde
the erle Octauian. And sente Taberne
with .xij. M. men for to destroye the erle
for his falsenesse. And they arryued at
Portesmouth. ¶And whan Octauian
wyst that he assembled a grete power of
Brytons & dyscomfyted Taberne / and
Taberne fledde thens in to Scotlonde.
& ordeyned there a grete power / and ca∣me
ayen in to this londe an other tyme
to yeue batayll to Octauyan. ¶Whan
Octauian herde that / he assembled a
grete power & came ayen towarde Ta∣berne
as moche as he myght / soo that
those two hostes mette togyders vppon
Stanesmore / and strongely smote togy∣der
& tho was Octauian dyscomfyted / and

ledde thens vnto Norwaye. And
& aberne seassed all y
•
 londe in his hon∣de
/ townes & castelles / and as moche as
they ther had. And syn Octauian came
ayen from Norway with a grete power
& seased all the londe in his honde & dro¦ue
out all the Romayns / & was tho ma¦de
kynge & regned.






¶How Marimian that was the Em∣perours
cosyn of Rome spowsed Octa∣uians
doughter / & was made kynge of
this londe.


THis Octauian gouerned the lon¦de
well & nobly but he had none
hey
 
aue a doughter that was a yonge
childe that he loued as moche as his lyf
And for as moche as he wexed syke and
was in poynt of deth / & myght no len∣ger
regne / he wolde haue made one of
his neuewes to haue be kynge / the whi∣che
was a noble knyght & a stronge man
that was called Conan Meriedok / and
he sholde haue kepte the kynges dough∣ter
& haue maryed her whan tyme had
ben. But the lordes of the londe wolde
not suffre it / but yaaf her coūseyll to be
maryed to some hyghe man of grete ho∣nour
/ & thenne myght she haue all her
lust / & the coūsell of the Emperour Con¦stantyne
her lorde. And at this coūseyll
they accorded / & those tho Cador of Cor¦newaylle
for to go to the Emperour for
to do this message. And he toke y
e
 waye
& went to Rome / & tolde the Emperour
this tydynges well and wysely. And the
Emperour sent in to this londe with hȳ
his owne cosyn y
•
 was his vncles sone a
noble knyght & a stronge / that was cal∣led
Maximian. And he spowsed Octa∣uians
doughter / & was crowned kynge
of this londe.






¶How Maximian y
t
 was themperours
cosyn / conquereed the londe of Armory∣cam
/ & yaaf it to Conan Meriedok.


THis kynge Maximian became
so ryall that he thought to con∣quere
the londe of Armorycam / for the
grete rychesse y
t
 he herde telle y
t
 was in
that londe / so y
•
 he ne lefte man y
t
 was
of worthynes / knyght / squyre / ne none
other man / that he ne toke with hym to
the grete damage to all the londe. For
he lefte at home behynde hym no man
to kepe the londe / but toke them with hȳ
fro this londe .xxx. thousande knyghtes
that were doughty mennes bodyes / and
wente ouer to the londe of Armorycam
and there slewe the kynge that was cal∣led
Imball / and conquered all the londe
And whan he had so done / he called Co¦nan
& sayd. For as moche as kyng Oc∣tauian
made you kynge of Brytayne / and
thrugh me ye were lette & dystrou∣bled
that ye were not kynge. I gyue you
this londe of Armorycam / & you therof
make kynge. And for as moche as ye
be a Bryton. I wyll that this londe ha∣ue
the same name / & nomore be called
Armorycam / but be called Brytayne.
And the londe from whens we be comen
shall be called moche Brytayne. And
soo shall men knowe that one Brytay∣tayne
fro that other. Conan Meridok


thanked hym greetly / & so was he made
kynge of lytell Brytayn. And whan all
this was done. Maximiam wente from
thens vnto Rome / & tho was made Em¦perour
after Constantyne. And Conan
dwelled styll in lytell Brytayn w
t
 moche
honour / & there lete ordeyne .ij. thousan¦de
ploughmen of y
e
 londe for to culture
the londe to harowe it / & for to sowe it / &
feffed them rychely after y
t
 they were.
And for asmoche as kyng Conan & no∣ne
of his knyghtes / ne none of his other
people wolde not take wyues of y
e
 nacion
of Fraūce / he tho sente in to grete Bry∣tayne
to the Erle of Cornewayle y
•
 men
called Dionothe / y
•
 he sholde chese tho∣rugh
out all this londe .xi.M. of may∣dens.
That is to saye .viij.M. for the
meane people / and .iij.M. for the gre∣test
lordes that sholde them spouse. And
whan Dionoth vnderstode this / he ma∣de
a cōmaundement thorughout all the
londe of Brytayn. And as many as the
nombre came to he assemblid togyder of
maydens / for there was no man y
•
 durst
withstande his cōmaundements / for as
moche that all the londe was take hym
to warde & kepe / to doo all thynge that
hȳ good lyked. ¶And whan these may∣dens
were assembled / he lete them come
afore hym at London. And lete ordeyne
for them shyppes hastely / and as moche
as them neded to that vyage. And toke
his owne doughter that was called vr∣sula
/ that was the fayrest creature that
ony man wyst. And he wolde haue sent
her to kynge Conan / that sholde haue
spoused her and made her quene of the
londe But she had made pryuely to god
a vowe of chastyte / that her fader not
wyst / ne none other man elles that was
lyuynge vpon erthe.






¶How Vrsula and .xi. thousande may¦dens
that were in her company wente
towarde lytell Brytayne / and all they
were martred at Coleyne.


THis Vrsula chose vnto her com∣pany
.xi. thousande maydens / y
•

of all other she was lady & maystresse / And
all they wente to shyppe at one ty∣me
in the water y
•
 is called Tamyse / &
cōmaunded her kynne & her frendes to
almyghty god / & saylled towarde lytell
Brytayn. But whan they were come in
to the hyghe see / a stronge tempest arose
as it was goddes wyll / & Vrsula with
her shyppes & her company were dryue
to Hundlonde thrugh tempest and arry¦ued
in the hauen of the cyte of Coleyne
And the kyng of the londe that was cal¦led
Gowan / was tho in the cyte. And
whan he wyst the tydynges that so ma
ny fayre maydens were there arryued.
He toke Elga his brother & other of his
housholde with hym & went to the shyp¦pes
to se
 y
•
 fayre company. And whan
he sawe them so fayre / he and his com∣pany
wolde haue ouerlayne them & sa∣ke
fro them ther maydenhode. But Vr∣sula
that good mayde / coūseylled / pray∣ed
/ warned / & taught theym that were
her felowes y
•
 they sholde defende them
with all theyr myght / and rather suffre
deth than suffre ther body to be defor / led.
So that all tho maydens became so
stedfast in god / that they defended them
thrugh his grace / so that none of them
hadde power to do them shame. Wher∣fore
the kynge Gowan was sore ano
ed
that he for wrathe slewe them eueryo¦ne
anone ryght / & so were all tho may∣dens
martred for the loue of god / and
lyeth at Coleyne.






¶How kynge Gowan came for to de∣stroy
this londe / and how a man of gre¦te
power that was called Gracian def∣fended
the londe.


AS all this was done kynge Go¦wan
that was a Sarrasyn cal∣led
his brother Elga and sayd to hym / that
he sholde goo conquere the londe


that all those fayr maydens were borne
in. And he ordened tho a grete power of
Pehites / of Denmarke / of Orkenay / &
of Norway And they came in to this lon¦de
/ & brente townes & slewe folke / & cast
a downe chirches & houses / and robbed
all the londe in length & brede / & put to
deth all tho that wolde not forsake the
ryght byleue & crystendome / for as mo∣che
as there was no souerayne y
•
 myght
them helpe. For the kynge Maximian
had take with hym all the worthy men
whan he wente to conquere lytell Bry∣tayne
And in the same tyme that ye here
now telle was Saynt Albon martryd
thrugh the wood tyraūt Dyoclesian / in
the same place where is now an abbaye
made of saynt Albon whyles y
•
 he was
a paynym. But he conuerted hȳ to god
thrugh the predicacōn of a clerke & a wy¦se
man y
•
 was called Ancyble / that was
herbourghed a nyght in his hous. And
this was after thyncarnacyon of Ihesu
Cryst .ij. hondred .xxvi. yere. And men
shall vnderstonde y
•
 saynt Albon suffred
his martyrdom before y
•
 saynt Edmon∣de
was martryd / & therfore is saynt Al∣bon
called the fyrst martyr of Englond
¶This Gowans brother & his folke
that were sarrasyns wente thrugh y
•
 lon¦de
& destroyed all thynge that they foū∣de
/ & no thynge they spared. Whan these
tydynges came to Rome how y
•
 kynge
Gowan had begon for to destroye this
londe / the Emperour of Rome sente a
stronge man & of grete power y
•
 was cal¦led
Gracian with .xxiiij.M. well fygh∣tynge
men / for to caste out those sarra∣syns
of this londe. And all they arryued
at Portesmouth. ¶Maximian myght
not come hȳself / for as moche as he was
chosen Emperour after the deth of Con¦stantyne
that was saynt Eleynes sone.
whan this Gracian was arryued w
t
 his
hoste / he lete aspye pryucly where kynge
Gowan myght be founde. And he sette
vpon them sodenly as they laye in theyr
beddes / and dyscomfyted hym & slewe
them in ther beddes euerychone / that no¦ne
of them scaped / sauf Gowan that
fledde in to his owne coūtree w
t
 moche
sorowe & grete payne. ¶So oneafter it
befelle that Maximian was slayne at
Rome thrugh treason. And whan Gra¦cian
wyst that tydynges he lete crowne
hym kynge of this londe.






¶How Gracian made hȳ kynge whan
Maximian was slayne / & afterwarde y
•

Brytons slewe hȳ for his wyckednesse.


THis Gracian whan he began to
regne / he became so wycked & so
sterne / and so moche sorowe dyde to the
Brytons y
•
 they slewe hȳ amonge them
¶Tho whan kynge Gowan vndersto¦de
y
•
 Gracian was slayne & done to deth
he assembled a grete power & came ayen
in to this londe. And yf he had fyrst do∣ne
harme tho dyde he moche more. For
tho destroyed he all this londe / & the cry¦sten
people y
•
 were in moche Brytayne / so
that no man was so hardy for to na¦me
god / & he that so dyde anone he was
put to strange deth. ¶But the bysshop
of London that was tho y
•
 was called
Gosselim scaped / & went thens to them
of Rome to seke socour / to helpe to de∣stroy
the sarrasyns y
•
 had destroyed this
londe. And y
•
 Romayns sayd / that they
had ben so often enoyed for ther sendyn¦ge
people in Brytayne / all for to hel¦pe
the Brytons / & they wolde nomore so
do / and so the Bysshop Gosselin went
thens without ony secour or helpe. And
tho wente he to the kynge of lytell Bry¦tayne
y
•
 was called Aldroye / & this was
the thyrde kynge after Gowan Merye∣dok
/ as before is sayd. ¶The bysshop
prayed this Aldroye of helpe & socoure / &
the kynge had pyte in his herte whan
he herde how the bysshop fledde / & how
that the crysten men were soo slayne in
grete Brytayne thrugh y
•
 paynyms and


sarrasyns / he graūted hym Constantyn
his broder hym for to helpe with power
of folke. And then dyde arraye hors / ar∣mour
& shyppes / & all thynges y
•
 neded
to y
•
 vyage. And whan all thynge was re¦dy
/ he called the bysshop / & to hym sayd
I take you here Constantyne my broder
vpon this couenaūt. That yf god gyue
hym grace the paynems & the sarrasyns
to destroye / y
•
 ye then make hym kynge.
And the bysshop graūted w
t
 good wyll.
¶Constantyne & the bysshop toke leue
of the kynge Aldroye & betoke hym to
god / & toke ther men .xij. thousande and
wente to ther shyppes / & saylled towar¦de
grete Brytayne & arryued att Tot∣nesse.
¶Whan the Brytons herde these
tydyng{is} y
•
 to them came socour / they we¦re
strongely holpen / & ordeyned them an¦huge
nombre of people & came to them
and receyued them with moche honour.
¶Gowan anone as he wyst of these ty¦dynges
/ he assembled all the Sarrasyns
& came ayenst them & yaue them batay¦le.
And Constantyne slewe hȳ with his
owne hondes. And all those other Sar∣rasyns
were dyscomfyted & slayne y
•
 no∣ne
of them escaped / but those that were
conuerted vnto almyghty god.






¶How Constantyne y
t
 was the kynges
brother of lytell Brytayne was crowned
kynge of grete Brytayune / for his grete
vertue & his grete worthynesse.


ANone after the batayll they wen¦te
to London & crowned there
Constantyne & made hym kyng of this
londe. And the bysshop Gosselyn sette y
•

crowne on his heed & anoynted hym / as
it befalleth for a kynge to be. And tho
began crystendome ayen in this londe / And
anone this kynge Constantyne as
he was crowned. anone after he spowsid
his wyf thrugh coūseyll of the Brytons
And he begate thre sones on her. The
fyrste was called Constance / & y
•
 other
Aurilambros / & the thyrde Vter. This
Constance the elder brother / whan he ca
ma to aege / he made hym a monke att
Wyncestre. This Constantyne ther fad{er}
thrugh treason was slayne. ¶For it be∣fell
on a tyme / that a Pehite came to hȳ
vpon a daye in message as it were. And
sayd that he wolde speke with foe kyng
pryuely in coūseyll. The kyng lete voy∣de
his chambre of the men y
•
 were there
within / & there abode noo moo but the
kynge & the Pehite. And he made a coū
tenaunce as though he wolde haue spo∣ken
with the kynge in his eere. And the∣re
he slewe hym with a longe knyf. And
after that he went meruaylously out of
the chambre in to an other chamre so
at the laste no man wyst where he was
become. ¶Whan the kynges men west
that theyr lorde was so deed they made
then so moche sorowe that they wyst not
what to do. For as moche as his two so¦nes
Aurilambros and Vter were so yon¦ge
/ that they myght not be kynge / and
the thyrde was a monke as is sayd be∣fore.
But Vortiger that was Erle of
Westsex thought pryuely in his herte
thrugh queyntaunce for to be kyng hym
selfe. And wente to Wynchestre where
that Constance was monke / and sayd
vnto hym. Constance sayd he your fa∣der
is deed & your two brethern that ben
with Gosselyn the bysshopp of London
to nourysshe be so yonge / that none of
them may be bynge. Wherfore I coūsell
you / that ye forsake your habyte and co∣me
with me. And I shall make suche a
meane vnto the Brytons that ye shall
be made kynge.






¶Of Constance that was kynge Con∣stantynes
sone / that was a monke atte
Wynchestre / and how he was made kyn¦ge
after his faders dethe thorugh coun∣seyll
of Vortiger that was erle of West∣sex
/ for as moche as Aurilambros and
Vter his two brethern were but yonge
of aege. And Vortiger lete slee hym for
to be kynge hymself.



THis Vortiger coūselled this Con¦stance
so moche / tyll he forsoke
his abbot & wente with hym. And ano∣ne
after he was crowned kynge by thas∣sent
of the Brytons. This kynge Con∣stance
whan he was crowned & made
kynge / he wyst ne knewe but lytell of y
•

worlde ne coude nothyng what knyght∣hode
axed. And he made Vortiger his
chyef mayster & coūseyller / & gaaf hym
all his power / for to ordeyne & do as mo¦che
as to the reame aperteyned. So that
hymself nothynge entremedled / but oon¦ly
bare the name of kynge. Whan Vor∣tiger
sawe that he had all the londe in
his warde & gouernall / he thought a pre¦uy
treason to slee Constance the kynge / that
he myght hymself be crowned and
made kynge & regne. And lete sende af∣ter
an hondred knyghtes of Pehites / the
worthyest of all the londe / & them helde
with hym for to dwelle / as to be kepers
of his body / as he wolde go thorugh the
londe to ordeyne thynges that appertey¦ned
to a kyng. And this Vortiger honou¦red
so moche the hondred knyghtes & so
moche yaue them of golde & syluer / and
so ryche Iewelles / robes / horses / & other
thynges plentee / wherfore they helde hȳ
more lorde than they dyd the kyng. And
Vortiger tolde them / yf he myght be kȳ¦ge
/ ye as it were thrugh treason / he wol∣de
make them rychest of the londe. Soo
at the last thrugh grete gyftes y
•
 he had
gyuen largely / they cryed thrugh y
•
 cour¦te
that Vortiger were better worthy to
be kyng than Constance. Wherfore Vor¦tiger
made semblaunt as he hadde ben
wroth. And he departed thens from the
court / & sayd he must go elles where for
thynges that he hadde to do. And so the
traytour sayd for by cause that they shol¦de
slee hym / that is to saye Constance.
¶Whad this Vortiger was gone / it be∣fell
soone after / that tho hondred knygh¦tes
of Pehites brake the doores of y
•
 kyn¦ges
chambre and there they hym slewe / and
smote of his heed & bare it to Vorti¦ger
there that he dwelled. And so whan
Vortiger sawe that heed / he wepte full
tenderly with his eyen / and neuertheles
he was somdeale gladde in his herte of
his deth. ¶And anone this Vortiger to¦ke
those hondred knyghtes of Pehites / &
badde his seruauntes bynde theyr hon¦des
behynde them / & ladde them to Lon¦don
/ and there they were dampned vnto
deth as fals traytours. And anone after
all the Brytons of the londe by the co∣myn
assente crowned Vortiger & made
hym kynge of the londe.

grete nauy of straungers were arryued
in y
•
 coūtree of Kent / he wyst not whens
they were ne wherfore they were come
in to this londe. ¶The kyng sent ano∣ne
a messager thyder / that some of them
sholde come & speke with hym / for to
wyte what folke they were & what they
axed / & in to what countree they wolde / ¶
There were two brethern maysters &
prynces of that stronge company / that
one was called Engist & y
t
 other Horne.
Engist wente to the kynge & tolde hym
the cause wherfore they were come in to
this londe & sayd. Syr we ben of a coū∣tre
y
t
 is called Saxonie / that is the londe
of Germayne / wherin is so moche so∣rowe
/ y
•
 of the people ben so many that


the londe may not them susteyne. And
the maysters and prynces that haue the
londe to gouerne and rule. They made
to come before them men and wymmen
that boldest ben amonge theym for to
fyght / and that best may trauayll in to
dyuerse londes. And so they sholde them
yeue horse & harneys / armour / and all
thynge that them nedeth And after they
shall saye to them / that they go in to an¦other
countree where that they mowe ly¦ue
/ as theyr Auncetrees dyde them befo¦re.
And therfore syr kynge / yf ye haue
ought to do with our company / we ben
comen in to your londe / and with good
wyll you wolde serue and your londe ke¦pe
helpe and defende from your enmyes
yf that ye nede. ¶Whan Vortiger her∣de
these tydynges / he sayd gladly he wol¦de
theym withholde / vppon suche coue∣naunt
/ yf they myght delyuer his londe
of his enmyes / he wolde yeue theym re∣sonable
londes where they sholde dwelle
for euer more. ¶Engist thanked hym
goodly / and in this maner he and his
company a .xi. thousande sholde dwelle
with the kynge Vortiger. And moche
they dyde thrugh theyr boldenesse / they
delyuered his londe of his enmyes clene
¶Tho prayed Engist the kynge of so
moche londe that he myght make to hȳ
a cyte and for his meyne. ¶The kynge
answered / it was not to do without the
counseyll of Brytons. ¶Engist prayed
hym eftsones of as moche place as he
myght compace w
t
 a thonge of a skynne
wherupon he myghte make a Maneer
for hym to dwelle on. And the kynge hȳ
graunted freely. ¶Tho toke Engist a
bulles skynne / and kytte it as smale as
he myght all in to 
o thonge all a roun∣de.
And therwith compaced he as moche
londe as he myght thenne make vpon a
fayre castell. And so whan this castell
was made / he lete calle it Thongcastell
for as moche as the place was marked
with a thonge.






¶Of Ronowen that was Engistes
doughter / and how the kynge Vortiger
spowsed her for her beaute.


SO whan this castell was made / &
full well arayed. Engist pryue¦ly
dyde sende by letter in to the countree
where he came fro / after an hōdred shyp¦pes
fylled with men that were stronge &
& also well fyghtynge in all bataylles / And
that they sholde also brynge with
them Ronowen his doughter / that was
the fayrest creature that a man myght
see. ¶And whan those people were co∣me
that he had sente after / he toke them
in to the castell with moche Ioye. And
hymself vpon a daye wente vnto y
•
 kyn¦ge
/ & prayed hym there worthely that he
wolde come & see his newe maneer that
he had made in the place y
•
 he had com∣passed
with the thonge of the skynne
¶The kynge anone graūted hym free∣ly.
And with hym wente thyder / & was
well apayed with the castell & with the
fayre werke / and togyder they ete & dran¦ke
with moche Ioye. And whan nyght
came that the kynge Vortiger sholde go
in to his chambre to take there his nygh¦tes
reste. Ronowen that was Engistes
doughter came with a cuppe of golde in
her honde / and kneled before the kynge
and sayd to hym (Wassaylle) And the
kynge knewe not what it was for to
meane ne what he sholde answere there
vpon / for as moche as hymself / ne none
of all his Brytons coude noo engl
sshe
speke ne vnderstonde it / but he spake in
the same langage that Brytons done
yet. Neuertheles a latiner tolde it to the
kynge the full vnderstandynge therof / (Wasshayll)
and that other sholde dryn¦ke
(hayll) And that was the fyrst tyme
that (wasshayll) and (drynkhayll) ca∣me
vp in this londe. And from y
•
 tyme
vnto this tyme / it is well vsed in this
londe. ¶The kynge Vortiger sawe the
fayrnesse of Ronowen / & his armes lay¦de


about her necke / & thryes swetely kys∣sed
her / & anone ryght he was enamou∣red
vpon her y
•
 he desyred to haue her to
wyf / & asked of Engist her fader. And
Engyst graunted hym vpon this coue∣naunt
/ y
•
 the kynge sholde yeue hym all
the coūtree of Kent / that he there myght
dwelle in & his people. The kyng hym
graūted pryuely with a good wyll. And
anone he spowsed the damoysell / & that
was moche confusyon to hymself. And
therfore all the Brytons became so wro¦the
/ for by cause he spowsed a woman
of mysbyleue. Wherfore they wente all
from hym / and no thynge to hym toke / ne
halpe hym in thynge that he had to
done.






¶How Vortimer that was Vortigers so¦ne
was made kynge / & Engist dryuen
out. And how Vortimer was slayne.


THis Engist wente in to Kente &
seased all y
•
 londe in to his hon∣de
for hym & for his men / & became with
in a lytill whyle of so grete power / & so
moche people had / y
t
 men wyst not in ly¦tell
tyme whiche were the kyng{is} men &
whiche were Engistes men. Wherfore
all the Brytons had of hym drede / and
sayd amonges theym. But yf y
•
 they ne
toke other coūseyll bytwene them / all y
•

londe sholde be bytrayed thrugh Engist
& his people. ¶Vortiger the kynge had
begoten on his fyrst wyf thre sones. The
fyrst was called Vortimer. The seconde
Catagien / & the thyrde Passent. ¶The
Brytons euerychone by one assent cho∣se
Vortimer to be theyr lorde & soueray∣ne
/ & coūseyler in euery batayll / & crow∣ned
hym & made hym kynge / & wolde
not suffre Vortiger no lenger to regne / for
cause of the alyaūce betwixt Engist
and hym. ¶The Brytons ordeyned a
grete hoste to dryue out Engist and his
company of the londe / & yaue hym thre
bataylles. The fyrst was in Kente there
he was lorde / the seconde 
 at Te
or¦de
/ and the thyrde in a shyre a this half
Colchestre in a more. And in this batay¦le
theym mette Catagien & Home En∣gistes
brother / so that eche of theym sle∣we
other. But for as moche as the coū∣tree
was yeuen longe before to Horne
thrugh Vortiger / tho he spowsed his co∣syn
/ there he made a fayre castell that
is called Horncastell after his owne na∣me.
And Vortimer was soo anoyed for
his brothers deth / that anone he lete fell
downe the castell to the groūde. And af∣ter
he ne lefte nyght ne daye tyll he had
dryuen out Engist and his people of the
londe. And thenne Ronowen his dough¦ter
made sorowe ynough. And quentely
spake to them that were next the kynge
Vortimer and pryuyest with hym. And
so moche she gaue hym of gyftes / that
he was enpoysened / and deyed at Lon∣don
the fourth yere of his regne / & there
he lyeth.






¶How the Brytons chose an other ty∣me
Vortiger to be theyr kynge / and En¦gist
came in to this londe / and how they
fought togyders.


AFter Vortimers deth / the Bry∣tonr
by theyr comyn assente eft
soones made Vortiger theyr kyng vpon
this couenaūt / y
•
 he sholdde neuer after
suffre Engist ne none of his eft sones to
come in to this londe. And whan all this
was done. Ronowen the quene pryuely
sente by letter to Engist y
•
 she had enpoy
sened Vortimer / & y
•
 Vortiger her lorde
bare ayen y
•
 crowne & regned. And that
he sholde come ayen into this londe wel
arayed with moche people for to auen∣ge
hym vppon the Brytons / and for to
wȳne this londe ayen. ¶And whan En¦gist
herde these tydynges / he made gre∣te
Ioye. And appareylled hym hastely
with .xv. thousande men / y
•
 were dughty
in euery batayll / & came in to this lon∣de.


¶And whan Vortiger herde tell that
Engist was come ayen with a grete po¦wer
in to this londe / he assembled his
Brytons / & tho wente ayenst Engist for
to ye
e hȳ batayll & his folke. But En∣gist
dradde hym sore of the Brytons / for
they had dryuen hym before & discomfy¦ted
hym w
t
 strength. Wherfore this En∣gist
prayed hȳ of a loue daye / & sayd he
was not comen in to this londe for to
fyght / but for to haue his londe ayen yf
he myght accorde with the Brytons / &
of them to haue loue & grace. The kyn¦ge
Vortiger thrugh coūseyll of his Bry¦tons
graūted hym a loue day. And thus
it was ordeyned thrugh the Brytons / y
•

the same daye sholde be holden fast besy¦de
Salisbury vpon a hylle. And Engist
sholde come thyder with foure hondred
knyghtes without moo. And the kynge
with as many of the wysest men of his
londe. And at that daye the kynge came
with his counseyll as it was ordeyned / But
Engist had warned his knyghtes
pryuely / & them cōmaunded that euery
one of them sholde put a longe knyf in
his hose. And whan he sayd Fayre syres
now is tyme to speke of loue & peas eue¦ry
man. Anone sholde drawe out his kny¦ue
& slee a Bryton. And so they slewe a
M .lxi. knyghtes / & with moche sorowe
many of them escaped. And the kynge
Vortiger there hymself tho was taken / &
ladde to Thongcastell & put in pry∣son.
And some of Engistes men wolde
that the kynge had be 
ente all quycke
And Vortiger tho for to haue his lyfe / graūted
them as moche as they wolde
axe / & yaue vp all the londe / townes / ca∣stelles
/ cytees / & borughs to Engyst and
to his folke. And all the Brytons fledde
thens in to Walys / and there they helde
them styll. And Engist wente thorugh
the londe and seased all the londe / with
fra
chyses. And in euery place lete cast
a do
ne chirches & houses of Religyon
And wasted and destroyed crystendome
thrughout all this londe. And lete chaū∣ge
the name of this londe called Brytay¦ne
/ that noo man of his were so hardy
after that tyme to calle this londe Bry∣tayne
/ but calle it Engist londe. And
thenne he departed all the londe to his
men / and there made .vij. kynges for to
strength y
•
 londe that the Brytons shol∣de
neuer after come therin. ¶The fyr¦ste
kyngdome was Kent / there that En∣gist
hymself regned / and was lorde and
mayster ouer all the other. ¶The other
kynge had Southsex that now is called
Chichestre. ¶The thyrde kynge hadde
Westsex. ¶The fourth hadde Eestsere
¶The fyfth had Estangill / that now
is calld Nortfolke. Southfolke. Merche
merik / that is to saye / therldome of Ni∣choll.
¶The sixth had Leycheter shyre.
Northampton shyre. Herforde / & Hun∣tyngdon.
¶The seuenth had Orenfor∣de.
Glouchestre. Wynchestre. Werwyke.
and Derby shyre.






¶How that Vortiger went in to Walys
and beganne there a castell that wolde
not stande without morter tempred with
blood.


AS Engist had departed all the
lond in this maner bytwene his
men / & delyuered Vortiger out of pryson
& sufffed hym freely to go whyther that
he wolde. And he toke his waye & went
in to Walys there y
•
 his Brytons dwel∣led
/ for as moche as y
•
 londe was stronge
& wycked to wynne. And Engist neuer
came there ne neuer knewe it before that
londe. ¶Vortiger helde hym there with
his Brytons / and a
d counseyll what
hym was best to do. And they yaue hym
counseyll to make a stronge castell that
he myght hymself there in kepe and de¦fende
yf nede where. Masons in hast tho
were fette / & began to werke vpon the
hylle of Breigh / but certes thus it befell
that all the werke y
•
 the masons made


a daye / downe it felle the nyght / & they
wyst not what it myght be. Therof the
kynge was sore anoyed of that chaūce &
wyst not what to do. Wherfore he lete
sende after the wysest clerkes & also ler∣ned
men than were thorugh out Walys
that myght be founde / for they sholde
telle wherfore the foūdament so fayled
vnder the werke / & that they sholde hym
tell what was best for to do. And whan
these wyse men longe tyme had studyed
they sayd to the kyng / that he sholde do
seke a childe borne of a woman that ne∣uer
had with man to do. And that chil∣de
sholde be slayne / and tempre with his
blood the morter of the werke. And soo
sholde the werke euer endure withouten
ende.






¶How the kynge lete seke Merlyn tho∣rugh
out all Walys / for to speke w
t
 hym


AS the kynge herde this / he cō∣maunded
his messagers anone
to go thrugh out Walys to seke y
•
 childe
yf they myght hym fynde / & that they
sholde hym brynge forth with them vn∣to
hym. And in recorde & in wytnesse of
this kynge he had take them his letters
that they ne were distroubled of no man
ne lette. And tho the messengers wente
thens / & spedde so fast y
•
 they came in to
a towne that was called Carmardyne / And
as they passed forth ther waye they
foūde two children of .xxilij. yere of aege
chidynge togyder w
t
 hasty wordes. And
one of them sayd to that other. Donebat
sayd he ye do all wronge to chyde or stry¦ue
with me for ye haue no wytte ne no
reason as I haue. Certes Merlyn sayd
he / of your wytte ne your reason I ma∣ke
no force. For men telle comynly that
ye haue nothynge of god almyghty syth
ye had neuer fader / but euery man kno∣weth
who was your moder. ¶The mes¦sengers
of y
•
 kynge Vortiger whan they
herde the stryue betwixt the two gromes
they axed of them that stode besyde them
whens that Merlyn was borne / & also
whome hym nourysshed. And the folke
them tolde / that a grete gentyll woman
hym bare in Carmardyne that was cal¦led
Adhan. But neuer myght no man
wyte who was his fader. ¶Whan the
kynges messengers herde these tydynges
they went anone to hym y
•
 was Wardey
ne of y
•
 towne & tolde hȳ the kyng{is} wyll
& shewed hȳ his letter wherfore they we¦re
come thyder. ¶Merlyn & his moder
were fetched before y
•
 Wardeyne of the
towne. And he cōmaunded them y
•
 they
sholde go to the kynge as it was ordey∣ned
by his messengers. ¶Merlyn & his
moder wente thens & came vnto y
•
 kyng
& there they were receyued w
t
 moche ho¦nour.
And the kynge axed of y
•
 lady yf
that childe were her sone & whome hym
begate. The lady answered full tender∣ly
wepynge & sayd. She neuer had com¦pany
of worldly man. But syr sayd she
As I was a yonge mayden in my faders
chambre / & other of grete lygnage were
in my company / that oftentymes went
to playe & solace. I be lefte alone in my
chambre / & wolde not go forth for bren¦nynge
of the sonne. And on a tyme there
came a fayre bacheler & entred in my
chambre there y
•
 I was alone. But how
he came in to me / & where. I wyst it ne∣uer
/ ne yet knowe I not. For y
•
 doores we¦re
fast barred & with me he dyde 

of loue. For I ne had myght ne power / hym
to defende from me. And often he
came vnto me in the forsayd maner / so
that he begate this childe. But neuer
myght I wyte what he was.






¶Of the answere of Merlyn wherfore
the kyng axed why his castel myght not
stonde that he had begonne ne pro

SO whan Merlyn had herde all
that his moder had sayd. He spa¦ke
to the kynge in this 
. ¶



how I was begoten / axe ye no more. For
it falleth not to you / ne to none other to
wyte. But telle me the cause wherfore I
am to you brought and wherfore ye ha∣ue
sente after me. ¶Truely sayd y
•
 kyn¦ge
/ my wyse counseyllers haue done me
to vnderstonde / that the morter of a wer¦ke
that I haue begonne / behoueth to be
tempred with your blood / or the funda∣ment
shall fayle for euer more. ¶Syre
sayd Merlyn. Wyll ye slee me for my
blood to tempre with your mortere. Ye
sayd the kynge / or elles my castell shall
neuer stande as my counseyllers doo me
to vnderstonde. Tho answered Merlyn
to the kynge. Syr he sayd / lete them co∣me
before me those wyse counseyllers / &
I woll preue that they sayen not well
ne truly. And whan the wyse men were
comen. Merlyn axed yf his blood were
the cause to make this werke to stonde
and endure. All tho wyse men were abas¦shed
& coude not answere. Merlyn tho
sayd to the kynge. Syr I shall tell you
the cause wherfore your werke thus fay∣leth
and may not stande. There is vn∣der
the mountayne there that ye haue
buylded your toure a grete ponde of wa¦ter
/ and in the botome of the ponde vn∣der
the water there ben two dragons / &
that one is whyte / and that other reede / that
fyght togyder ayenst your werke / Do
ye myne depe tyll your men come to
the ponde / and cause your men to take
awaye the water all out / and thenne ye
shall see the dragons as I haue you tol∣lde
/ that togyder fyght ayenst your wer∣ke
/ and this is the cause wherfore your
fundament fayleth. The kynge anone
lete dygge vnder tyll that men came to
the ponde / and lete do awaye the water / and
there they founde two dragons as
Merlyn had tolde them y
•
 egerly fought
togyder. The whyte dragon egerly as∣sayled
the reede / and layde on hym soo
strongely that he myght not endure / but
withdrewe hym and rested in the same
ca
e. And whan he had a whyle rested
hym / he wente before and assayled the
reede dragon angrely / and helde hym so
sore that he myght not ayenst hym endu¦re
/ but withdrewe hym and rested. And
after came ayen the whyte dragon and
strongely fought with the reede dragon.
and bote hym euyll and hym ouercame.
that he fledde from thens and nomore
came agayne.






¶Of the sygnyfycacyon of those two
dragons that were in the botome of the
ponde that fought togyder.


THis kyng Vortiger and his men
that sawe this batayll had gre∣te
meruayle / and prayed Merlyn to tell
hym what it myght betoken. Syr quod
Merlyn I shall telle you. The reede dra¦gon
betokeneth yourself / and the whyte
betokeneth the folke of Saxon that fyr∣ste
ye toke and helde in your londe that
fyght ayenst you / and you haue dryuen
and enchaced. ¶But Brytons of your
lygnage ouercame them & droue them
awaye And sythen at the comynge ayen
of the Saxons they recouered this lon∣de
and helde it for euer more. And droue
out the Brytons and dyde with this lon¦de
all theyr wyll / and destroyed crysten∣dome
thrugh out this londe. Ye had fyr∣ste
grete Ioye with theyr comynge / but
now it is corned to you grete damage &
sorowe. For tho two brethern of Con∣stance
that was kynge the whiche ye le∣te
slee shall come before a quinzeme pas¦sed
with a grete power from lytell Bry¦tayne
/ & shall auenge the deth of theyr
brother. And they shall brenne you fyrst
with sorowe / and after they shall slee a
grete parte of Saxons / and shall dryue
out all the remenaunt of the londe. And
therfore abyde ye here no lenger to ma∣ke
castell nor other werke. But anone
go elles where your lyues all for to saue
To god I you betake / trouthe I haue


sayd to you of thynges that shall befall
¶And vnderstande ye well that Auri∣lambros
shall be kynge. But he shall be
enpoysoned / & lytell tyme shall he regne






¶Of kynge Aurilambros how that he
pursewed Vortiger & Engist / and how
they deyed.


MErlyn and his moder departed
from the kynge / and torned a∣gayne
to Carmardyn. And soone after
tydynges came to the Brytons that Au¦rilambros
and Vter his brother were ar¦ryued
at Totuesse with a greate hoste / And
anone y
•
 Brytons assembled them
and wente to receyue Aurilambros and
Vter with grete noblesse. And had them
vnto London / and crowned Aurilam∣bros
and made hym kynge / and dyde
vnto hym homage. And anone he axed
where Vortiger that was kynge myght
be founde / for he wolde be auenged on
his brothers dethe / and after he wolde
warre vppon paynems. And they tolde
hym that Vortiger was in Walys / and
so they ladde hym thytherwarde. ¶Vor¦tiger
wyst well that tho brethern came
hym to conquere / and fledde thens in to
a castell that was called Gerneth that
stode vppon an hyghe mountayrie / and
there hym helde. Aurilambros and Vter
his brother and theyr folke had besye∣ged
the castell full longe tyme / for the
castell was stronge and well arrayed.
¶So at the laste they casted wylde fyre
and brent houses and men and all theyr
araye / and as moche as was within the
castell. So that Vortiger was brente a∣monge
all other / and soo he deyed with
moche sorowe. ¶Tho was Engist in
Kente and regned there / and herde this
tydynges / and anone fledde and wolde
haue gone in to Scotlonde for to haue
had socoure. But Aurilambros and his
men mette with hym in the north coun∣tree
and yaue hym batayll. And Engist
and his men defended whyles that they
myght. But he and his folke were dys∣comfyted
and slayne. And Octa his so∣ne
fledde vnto Yorke. And Aurilambros
hym folowed egrely. And Octa a lytell
whyle withstode hym. But afterwarde
he put hym to his mercy. And Aurilam¦bros
receyued hym / and to hym and to
his men gaaf the countree of Galeway
in Scotlonde / and there they dwelled / ¶
The kynge Aurilambros wente tho∣rugh
out the londe / and put awaye the
name of Engistlonde / that Engist af∣ter
his name had called it before. Tho
lete he it calle agayne grete Brytayne / and
lete make ayen chirches / houses of
relygyon / castelles / cytees / and borughs▪
and townes that the Saxons hadde de∣stroyed.
And came to London / and lete
make the walles of the cyte / whiche En¦gist
and his folke hadde caste downe / ¶
The Brytons ladde hym vnto the
mount of Ambriam that somtyme was
an hous of relygyon / that tho was de∣stroyed
thrugh the paynems. ¶Wherof
a knyght that was called Ambri some
tyme was founder of that house. And
therfore the same hylle was called the
mounte of Ambrian. And after it was
called Ambresbury. And shall be so for
euer more.






¶How Aurilambros dyde redresse the
londe of greate Brytayne / that whiche
was dstroyed thorugh the Saxons be∣fore
sayd.


HOw the kynge Aurilambros le∣te
amende and redresse the house
of Ambresbury / and there in put mon∣kes.
But now there ben Nonnes a ly∣tell
fro the place that was called Sa∣lysbury
/ are that the Saxons slewe the
Brytons / where Engist and they sholde
haue made a loue daye. In the whiche
tyme were slayne a thousande knygh∣tes
.lxi. thrugh treason of Engist. The


kynge therof had grete pyte & thought
to make in mynde of them a monumēt
of stone y

 myght endure to the worldes
ende. And of this thynge they toke ther
coūseyll what therof was best for to do / ¶
Tho spake to the kynge the bysshop
of London y

 was called Ternekyn y
•
 he
sholde requyre after Merlyn. For he cou¦de
best tell how this thynge myght best
be made. And Merlyn after was sought
and foūde & came to y
•
 kynge. And the
kynge tolde hym his wyll of the monu∣ment
y
t
 he wolde haue made. Merlyn an¦swered
to the kynge & sayd. There ben
grete stones in Irlonde / & longe vpon the
hylle of Kyan y

 men called Gyauntes
karoll. And yf they were in this place as
they ben there / they wolde endure for e∣uer
more in remēbraūce of those knygh∣tes
that here be entyred. ¶Per may foy
sayd the kyng As harde stone ben in my

but in all your londe ben none suche
For gyauntes sette them for grete good
of themself. For at euery tyme that they
were woūde or in ony maner hurte / they
wysshe the stones with hote water / and
thenne they wysshe them therwith & a∣none
they were hoole.






¶How the Brytons wente for to seke
the grete stones in Irlonde.


ASsoone as the Brytons had her¦de
of this thynge / they yede and
swore amonge them they wolde go seke
those stones. And toke w

 them Vter the
kynges brod{er} to be chyef capitayne & .v.
thousande men / & Merlyn coūselled thē

whan the kynge of Irlonde y

called Guillomer herde telle that straū¦gers
were arryued in his londe / he assem¦bled
a grete power & fought ayenst them
But he & his folke were dyscomfyted / ¶
The Brytons wente before tyll they
came to the mount of Kyan / & clȳmed
vp vnto the mount. But whan they sa∣we
the stones & the maner how they sto¦de
/ they had grete meruaylle & sayd by∣twene
themselfe / that noo man sholde
them remeue for no strength ne engyne
so grete they were & so longr. But Mer¦lyn
thrugh his crafte he remeued them
& brought them in to theyr shyppes and
came ayen in to this londe. And Merlyn
sette the stones there that the kyng wol∣de
haue them. And sette them in the sa∣me
maner that they stode in Irlonde / And
whan the kynge sawe that it was
made he thanked Merlyn / and rychely
hym rewarded at his owne wyll. And
that place lete calle it Stonhenge for
euer more.






¶How Passent that was Vortigers so∣ne
and the kynge Guillomer came in
to this londe / and how a traytour that
was called Cappa enpoyseneu the kyn∣ge
Aurilambros.


ANd men shall vnderstande that
Passent that was Vortigers so∣ne
lyued the same tyme / and came in to
this londe w
t
 a grete power / & arryued
in the north coūtree & wolde be auenged
of his faders deth Vortiger / & strongely
trusted vppon the company that he had
brought w
t
 hym out of y

 londe of Ger∣mayne
/ & had conquered all the North
coūtree vnto Yorke. ¶And whan kyng
Aurilambros herde this / he assembled a
grete power of Brytons & wente for to
fyght with Passent / & he dyscomfyted
Passent & all his people. But Passent
escaped thens with some of his men / &
fledde thens in to Irlonde and came to
kynge Guillomer & prayed hym of hel∣pe
& socour. The kynge graunted hym
with good wyll & sayd / that he wolde
helpe hym / vpon that couenaūt that I
my selfe muste go with you with all my
power in to Brytayne. And I wolde 

aduenge vpon the Brytons the rather / 


for they came in to my londe & toke the
stones with strength y
•
 is called Gyaū∣tes
karoll. ¶The kynge Guillomer le
te ordeyne his shyppes & wente to the see
with .xv. thousande men / & arryued in
Walys & began to robbe / & moche soro∣we
he dyde. ¶It befell so that kynge
Aurilambros laye syke at Wynchestre / &
myght not helpe hymself. So that he
sente in his name Vter his brother with
a power to helpe Walys. And thyther∣warde
he wente as moche as he myght.
¶The kynge of Irlonde and Passent
herde telle that Aurilambros was syke / &
to hym there came a Sarrasyn that
was called Cappa & sayd. Syre dwelle
ye here all in peas with your hoste / & I
behyght you thorugh my quayntesye y
•

I shall slee the kynge Aurilambros that
is syke. Thenne sayd Passent / yf ye do
so I shall you rychely auaūce. The tray¦tour
Cappa put vpon hym an habyte of
religyon / & lete shaue hym a brode crow¦ne
& came vnto the kynges courte / and
sayd that he wolde helpe the kynge of
his malady. Tho sayd y
e
 traytour Cap¦pa
vnto the kynge. Syr be of good com¦forte.
For I shall yeue you suche a medy¦cyne
that ye shall swete anone ryght &
lyste to slepe & haue good reste. And the
traytour yaaf hym suche poyson to sle∣pe
anone ryght / and deyed in his slepyn¦ge.
And the traytour sayd that he wolde
go out in to the felde tyll he were awa∣ked
/ & so escaped he awaye. For no man
had to hym suspeccyon / for by cause of
his habyte that he was clothed in / and
also for his brode shauen crowne. But
whan the kynges men wyst that he was
deed / they became wonder sory / and fast
soughte the traytour / but they myghte
not fynde hym. For that Cappa torned
ayen vnto the hoste from whens that he
came.






¶Whan Aurilambros deyed a sterre in
the morne was seen with a clere lyght / &
at the bought of the beeme was seen she
heed of an horryble dragon.


SO whan the kyng Aurilambros
was deed & enpoysoned at Wyn¦chestre.
On the morne after he was deed
about the tyme of Pryme there was se∣ne
a sterre grete & clere / & the beeme of
that sterre was bryghter than the sonne
And at the bought of the beeme apperid
a dragons heed / & out of his mouth ca∣me
two huge lyghtes / y
t
 were as bryght
as ony fyre brennynge / & that one beeme
towarde Fraunce and streyght ouer the
see thytherwarde. And out of that bee∣me
came .vij. beemes full clere & longe
as it were the lyght fyre. ¶This sterre
was seen of many a man / but none of
them wyste what it betokened. ¶Vter
that was the kynges brother that was
in Walys with his hoste of Brytons / sawe
that sterre & the grete lyght that it
yaue / they wondred therof gretly what
it myght betoken And lete calle Merlyn
and prayed hym for to telle what that it
myght betoken.






¶Of the betokenynge of the sterre.


MErlyn sawe that sterre / & behel∣de
it longe tyme. And sythen he
quoke & wept tenderly. And sayd. Alas
alas y
t
 so noble a kyng & worthy is deed
And I do you to vnderstande that Auri¦lambros
your brother is poysoned / & y
•
 I
see well in this sterre. And yourself is be¦tokened
the heed of the dragon y

 is seen
at the bought of the beeme / that is your
self y
t
 shall be kynge & regne. And by the
beeme that stondeth towarde the Eest is
vnderstonde y
t
 ye shall gete a sone that
shall conquere all Fraunce / & all the lon¦des
y
t
 belongeth to the crowne of Fraū∣ce
/ that shall be a worthyer kynge & of
more hononr than euer were ony of his
auncetours. ¶And by the beeme y

 stret∣ched
towarde Irlonde is betokened that


ye shal gete a doughter that shal be que∣ne
of Irlonde. ¶And the .vij. beemes be∣token
that ye shall haue .vij. sones. And
euery one of them shall be kynge / & reg¦ne
with moche honour. And abyde ye
no lenger here / but go & yeue batayll to
your enmyes / and fyght with them bol∣dely
for ye shall ouercome them & haue
the victory. ¶Vter thanked hertely Mer¦lyn
/ and toke his men & wente towarde
his enmyes / & they fought togyder mor¦tally
/ & so he dyscomfyted his enmyes &
them destroyed. And hymself slewe Pas¦sent
that was Vortigers sone. And his
Brytons slewe Guillomer y
t
 was kyng
of Irlonde & all his men. ¶And Vter
anone after that batayll toke his waye
towarde Wynchestre / for to do entyere
Aurilambros kynge that was his bro∣ther.
But tho was the body bor
 vnto
Stonhenge with moche houour / that he
had done make in remembraūce of the
Brytons that there were slayne thrugh
treason of Engist / that same daye that
they sholde haue ben accorded. And in
the same place they entyered Aurilam∣bros
the seconde yere of his regne with
all the worshyp that myght belonge to
suche a kynge. On whoos soule god ha∣ue
mercy. Amen.






¶Of Vter Pendragon / and wherfore
he was called so ye shall here. And how
he was ouertake with the loue of Igrey
ne that was the Erle of Cornewaylles
wyf.


AFter the dethe of Aurilambros
Vter his brother was crowned / and
regned well & worthely. And in re∣membraunce
of the dragon that he was
lykened to / he lete make two dragons
thrugh counseyll of his Brytons. And
made that one for to be borne before hȳ
whan he wente in to batayll / and that
other for to abyde at Wynchestre in the
bysshops chirche. And for that cause he
was called euer after Vter Pendragon / ¶
And Octa that was Engistes sone
cōmended Vter but lytell that was ma∣de
newe kynge. And ayenst hym began
to meue warre. And ordeyned a grete po¦wer
of his frendes & of his kynne / and
of Ossa his brother / and had taken all
the londe from Humbre vnto Yorke / But
those of Yorke helde strongely a∣gaynst
them / and wolde not suffre them
to come in to the cyte / neyther to yelde
the cyte to them. And he besyeged y
•
 tow¦ne
anone ryght / & yaue therto a stronge
assawee. But they of the cyte them kep∣te
well & strongely. ¶And whan Vter
herde therof / he came thyther with a gre¦te
stronge power for to helpe & rescowe
the towne & put awaye the syege / and ya¦ue
a stronge batayll. And Octa and his
company them defended as well as they
myght. But at the laste they were d
s∣comfyted
and the moost partye of them
slayne. And Octa and Ossa were taken
& put in pryson at London. ¶And Vter
hymself dwelled a whyle at Yorke / and
after he wente to London. And 
 the
Eester after he wolde bere crowne and
holde a solempne feest. And lete somone
all his Erles & Barons / that they shol∣de
come to that feest. And all those that
had wyues sholde brynge them also to
that feest. And all the seygnoury came
at the kynges commaundement as they
were cōmaunded. ¶The feest was ry∣chely
arayed & holden. And all worthely
sette to meete after y
•
 they were of astate
Soo that the Erle Gorloys of Corne∣waylle
and Igreyne his wyf sate next
vnto the kynge. And whan the kynge sa¦we
the faytnesse of that lady & the beau¦te
that she had. He was anone rauysshed
for her beaute / and often he made to her
nyce countenaunce in lokynge and lau∣ghynge.
So at the laste the Erle percey¦ued
the preuy lokynge & laughynge and
the loue bytwene them. And rose vp frō
the table in wrathe / & toke his wyf / and


called to hym his knyghtes and wente
thens in wrath / without takynge leue of
the kynge. ¶The kynge anone sent af¦ter
hym that he sholde come agayne &
go not thens in dyspyte of hym. And the
erle wolde not come agayne in no ma∣ner
of wyse. ¶Wherfore the kynge was
wroth / and in wrath hym defyed as his
deedly enmye. And the erle wente thens
in to Cornewaylle with his wyf in the
castall of Tyntagyll. ¶And the kynge
lete ordeyne a grete hoste and came in to
Cornewaylle / for to destroye the erle yf
that he myght. But he had put hym in
suche a castell that was stronge & well
arayed called Tyntagyll / & wolde not
yelde hym to the kynge. ¶And the kyn¦ge
anone besyeged the castell / and there
dwelled .xv. dayes that neuer myght spe¦de
/ & 
uer he thought vppon Igreyne / &
vpon her layde so moche loue / that he
wyst not what to do. ¶So at the laste
he called to hym a knyght that was cal¦led
Vlfin that was preuy with hym and
tolde hym all his coūseyll / & axed of hȳ
what was best for to done. ¶Syr sayd
he / sende after Merlyn anone / for he can
telle you the best counseyll of ony man
lyuynge. Merlyn anone was sente after
& came to the kynge. And the kynge tol¦de
hym all his coūseyll & his wyll. Syr
sayd Merlyn. I shal do so moche thrugh
crafte that I can / that I shall make you
come to nyght in the castell of Tynta∣gyll
/ & shall haue all your wyll of that
lady.






¶How Vter begate on Igreyne / that
was the Erles wyf of Cornewaylle Ar∣thur
kynge.


MErlyn thrugh craft that he cou∣de
chaunged the kynges fygure
in to the lykenes of the erle / and Vlfin
Garlois his Chambrelayne in to the fy¦gure
of Iordan that was the erles cham
brelayne / so that eche of them was trans¦fygured
in to others lykenes And whan
Merlyn had so done / he sayd to the kyn¦ge.
Syr sayd he / now ye may go sodeyn¦ly
to the castell of Tyntagyll & axe en∣tree
there & haue your wyll. The kyng
toke prpuely all the hoste to gouerne and
lede to a knyght that he moche loued / &
toke his waye towarde the castell / and
with hym toke Vlfin his chambrelayne
and Merlyn / & whan they came thyder
the porter demid it had ben his owne lor¦de.
And whan tyme came for to god to
bedde / the kynge wente to bedde with
Igreyne the erles wyf & dyde with her
all his wyll. And begate vpon her a so∣ne
that was called Arthur. And vppon
the morowe the kynge toke his leue of
the lady & wente ayen to his hoste. And
the same nyght that the kynge laye by
Igre
ne in bedde that was y
•
 erles wyf
the kynges men gaaf a grete assawie
vnto the castell. And the erle & his men
manly them defended. But at the laste
it befell so / that in the same assawie the
erle hymself was slayne & the castell ta¦ken.
¶And the kynge anone torned a∣gayne
to Tyntagyll & spowsed I grey∣ne
with moche honour & made her que∣ne.
¶And soone after tyme came that
she sholde be delyuered & bare a childe a
sone that was called Arthur. And after
ga
e on her a doughter that was called
Amya. And whan she came to aege / a
noble Baron that was lorde of Lyons
wedded her. ¶Whan Vter longe tyme
had regned / there came vpon hym a gre¦te
sykenesse as it were a sorowe. ¶And
in the meane tyme those that had to ke∣pe
Octa that was Engistes sone and
Ossa has brother / that then were in pry∣son
/ they lete them go for grete yeftes y
•

they them yaue & went with them. And
whan tho two brethern were escaped &
were in to theyr owne countree agayne / Thenne
they ordeyned them a grete po¦wer
of folke / and began for to warre a∣yen
vppon the kynge.








¶How kynge Vter chose Aloth to kepe
the londe of Brytayne / whyle that he
was syke / for as moche as he myght not
lo
 
 syknesse.


ANd for as moche as kynge Vter
was syke & myght not helpe hȳ
self / he ordeyned Aloth sone of Eleyne
that tho was chosen for to be wardeyne
& chyeftayne of all his folke. And so he
anone & all his Brytons assembled a gre¦te
hoste & yaue batayll to Octa & to his
folke / but Octa at the last was dyscom∣fyted.
¶It befell thus afterwarde / that
these Brytons had dedignacōn of Aloth
& wolde not be to hym attendaūe. Wher¦fore
the kynge was anoyed wonder sore
& lete put hym in a lytere in the hoste a∣monges
his folke. And they ladde hym
to Vereloyne that tho was a fayre cyte / there
y
•
 saynt Albon was martred. And
after was the cyte destroyed with pay∣nems
thrugh warre. And thyther they
had sente Octa and Ossa & ther people
And entered in to the towne / & lete ma∣ke
sure y
•
 yates / & there they helde them
And the kynge came & them besyeged / &
made a stronge assawee / but they that
were within manly theym deffended / ¶
The kynge lete ordeyne his ginnes
& his engynes for to breke the walles / &
the walles were so stronge that no man
myght them mysdo. ¶Octa & his peo∣ple
had grete despyte / that a kynge lyen¦ge
in a lytere had theym besyeged. And
they toke counseyll amonge them for to
stande vp in the morowe erly and come
out and yeue batayll to the kynge / and
so they dyde. And in that batayll were
bothe Octa and Ossa slayne / & all the
other y
•
 escaped a lyue fledde in to Scot∣lnde
/ & made Colegrin theyr chyeftay¦ne.
And the Saxons y
•
 were a lyue & esca¦ped
fro the batayll / brought ayen a gre∣te
strength / & amonge them they sayd / that
yf kynge Vter were deed they spol∣de
well conquere the londe / & thought to
enpoysen the kynge / & ordeyned men for
to do this dede / & yaue them of yeft{is} gre¦te
plente this thynge to do. And they or∣deyned
them thyderwarde there 
 y

 kyn¦ge
was dwellynge / and clothed them in
poore wede y

 better all for to spede theyr
fals purpose. But netheles all theyr fal∣senes
& subtylte they myght neuer come
to nygh the kynge. But so at y

 last they
aspyed y

 the kynge dranke no other ly∣cour
but oonly water of a clere well that
was nyghe besyde / & the fals traytours
vpon a daye pryuely wente to y

 well &
put therin poyson / so y

 all y

 water was
enpoysened. And anone after as the kyn¦ge
had dronke of that water / he began to
swelle / & soone after he deyed / & as ma∣ny
as dranke of y

 water deyed also. And
anone as this was aspyed folke of the
towne lete stoppe the welle for euermore
¶Whan the kynge was deed his folke
bare hym to Stonhenge with grete so∣lempnyte
of bysshop & barons that we∣re

his brother. And after torned ayen
tho euerychone & sente after his sone &
they made hym kynge of the londe with
moche reuerence after his faders de

¶How kyng Arthur y
•
 was the sone of
Vter was crowned after his fads deth &
how he draue Colegrin & the Sarons &
Cheldr
k of Almayne out of this londe.


AS Arthur was made kynge of
the londe / he was but yonge of
aege of .xv. yere / but he was fayre and
bolde & doughty of body. And to meke
folke he was good & curteys / and large
of spendynge / & made hym well beloued
amonge all them there y
•
 it was nede / &
whan he began to regne be swore truely
that the Saxons neuer sholde haue re
 ne
peas tyll that he hadde dryurn them
out of the londe. And assembled a grea∣te
hoste and fought with Colegrin) the


whiche after the tyme that Octa was
deed the Saxons mayntened. And this
Colegrin was dyscomfyted & fledde vn∣to
Yorke & toke the towne / & there hym
helde. And the kynge besyeged hȳ there
but he myght no thynge spede for the cy¦te
was so stronge. And they within the
towne kept y
•
 cyte well & orpedly. ¶And
in the mene tyme Colegrin lete the tow¦ne
to Bladulf & fledde hymself to Chel¦drik
y
•
 was kynge of Almayne / for to ha¦ue
of hym socour. And the kynge assem¦bled
a grete power & came & arryued in
Scotlonde with .xv. hondred shyppes.
And whan Arthur wyst of these tydyn∣ges
y
•
 he had not power & strength ynou∣ghe
to fyght ayenst Cheldrik / he lete be
the syege & wente to London / and sente
anone his letters to the kynge of lytell
Brytayne y
t
 was called Howell his ne∣uewe
his systers sone / that he sholde co∣me

And he assembled a grete hoste & arry∣ued
at Southampton. And what kyng
Arthur if wyst he was gladde ynough &
wente ayenst them / & them receyued w
t
 
moche honour. So that those two host{is}
mette & assembled them / and toke theyr
waye euen vnto Nicholl that Cheldrik
had besyeged / but it was not taken. And
they came vpon cheldrik & his people or
they wyst where that they were / & them
egrely assaylled. ¶The kyng Cheldrik
and his men defended hym manly by
theyr power. But kynge Arthur & his
men slewe so many Saxons / that neuer
was seen suche slaughter / and Cheldrik
and his men that were left alyue fledde
awaye. And kynge Arthur them purse∣wed
& droue them out in to a wood that
that they myght no ferder passe. ¶Chil¦drik
& his men sawe well that they we¦re
brought in to moche dysease / & them
yelded to kynge Arthur in this maner
wyse. That he sholde take theyr horses
& theyr armour / and all that they had / and
they muste oonly goo on foot in to
theyr shyppes. And so they wolde go ho¦me
in to theyr owne londe / & neuer co∣me
ayen in to this londe. ¶And vpon
assuraunce of this thynge they

of his men graūted this thynge / &
receyued the hostages / & therupon the o∣ther
wente to theyr shyppes. And whan
they were in the hygh see y

 wynde chaū¦ged
as the deuyll it wolde / & they forned
theyr nauy & came ayen in to this londe
& arryued at Totnesse / and wente out
of the shyppes & toke the londe / and de∣ne
robbed it / and moche people slewe / &
tooke all the armour that they myght

came vnto Bathe. But the men of the
towne shytte faste theyr yates / and wol¦de
not suffre theym to come within the
towne. And they deffended them well &
orpedly ayenst them.






¶How Arthur yaue bataylle vnto the
Saxons whan they came agayne in to
this londe / & had besyeged the towne of
Bathe and them ouercame.


ANone as Arthur herde this ty∣dynges
he lete hange the hosta∣ges
/ & lefte Howell of Brytayne his ne∣uewe
/ for to kepe the marche towarde
Scotlonde with half his people / & hym
self wente to helpe & rescowe the towne
of Bathe. Whan he came thyther he ya∣ue
a stronge batayll to Cheldrik & slewe
almoost all the people y

 he had. For no
man myght hym withstonde ne endure
vnder y
e
 stroke of his swerde. And there
bothe were slayne Colegrin & Bladult
his brother / & Cheldrik fledde thens &
wolde haue gone to his shyppes. ¶But
whan Arthur it wyst / he toke .x. thou∣sande
knyghtes to Cador y
•
 was erle of
Cornewaylle for to lette & stoppe his to
mynge. And Arthur hymself wente to∣warde
y

 marche of Scotlonde. For me∣sengers
tolde hym that the Scottes had


besyeged Howell of Brytayne there that
he laye syke / & therfore he hasted hym
thytherwarde. ¶And Cador pursewed
after Cheldrik / & toke hym er he myght
come to his shyppes & slewe Cheldrik &
his people. And whan Cador had done
this vyage / he hasted hym ayen towar∣de
Arthur as fast as he myght / & foun∣de
hym in Scotlonde there that he had
rescowed Howell of Brytayne / but the
Scottes were ferre within Nounref / &
there they helde them a whyle. But Ar∣thur
them pursewed. & they fledde thens
in to Limoigne / that were in that coun∣tree
.lx. Iles / & grete plente of byrdes / &
grete plente of Egles that were wonte to
crye & fyght togyders / and make grete
nose whan folke came to robbe that lon¦de
/ & warne as moche as they myght / &
so they dyde. For the Scottes were to gre¦te
rauenours / that they tooke all that
they myght fynde in the londe of Li∣moigne
without ony sparynge / & there
with tharged ayen the folke in to Scot∣londe
for to wende.






¶How kynge Arthur axed of Merlyn
the aduentures of .vi. of the laste kynges
that were to regne in Englonde / & how
the londe sholde ende.


SYr sayd Merlyn. In the yere of

And the londe shall be without a go∣uernour

ANd after this shall come a dra∣gon

¶And in y

And at y

These two owles shall do grete har∣me

And he shall be called thorugh out

Alas the sorowe / for he shall deye of his

bynde theyr tayles togyder. ¶Thenne
shall come a lyon out of Irlonde / that
shall falle in company with them. And
thenne shall tremble the londe that shal
be called Englonde as an aspyn leyf / And

¶After the moldwarpe shall flee & the
dragon. The lyon and the wulfe shall
them dryue awaye / and the londe shall
be without them. And the mold warpe
shall haue no maner power / sauf oonly
a shyppe wherto he may wende. ¶And
after that he shal go to londe where the
see is withdrawe. And after that he shal
yeue the thyrde parte of his londe / fu

to haue the fourth parte in peas and in
rest. And after he shall lyue in sorowe
all his lyf tyme. ¶And in his tyme the
hote bathes shal become colde. And af∣ter
y

 shall the moldwarpe deye auentu∣rously
& sodeynly. Alas for sorowe / for
he shall be drowned in a flood of the see
His seed shall become faderles in straū∣ge
londe for euer more. And then shall y

londe be departed in to thre partes / that


in to say / to the wulf / to the dragon / & to
the lyon. And so shall it be for euer mroe
And thenne shall this londe be called
the londe of Conquest. And so shall the
ryght heyres of Englonde ende.






¶How Arthur ouercame Guillomer
that was kynge of Irlonde. And how
the Scottes became his men.


THenne what Guillomer that
was kynge of Irlonde herde ty∣dynges
y

 kynge Arthur was entred at
Glastenbury / he ordeyned a grete po∣wer
of Irysshmen & came to the see with
his Irysshe people / & so came in to Scot¦londe
ouer the see & arryued fast there
by y

 kynge Arthur was with his hoste / And
anone as he wyst therof / he wente
towarde hym & yaue hym bataylle & o∣uercame
hym anone ryght. And Guil∣lomer
fledde with his men agayne in to
Irlonde. And what this was done & dys¦comfyted
hym Arthur torned hym ayen
there that he was / in to the place there
that he had lefte the Scottes and wolde
haue them all slayne. But the byssho∣pes
/ abbottes / & other folke of the coun∣tree
& ladyes open heeded came before
kynge Arthur & cryed hym mercy & say
de. Syre gentyll kynge & myghty / haue
mercy & pyte vpon vs. And as yourself
be of the ryght lawe to holde & maynte∣ne
Crystendome. For full greate dysho∣nour
it sholde be to slee hym y

payne. For y
o
 Saxons haue many tymes
passed through our londe. But y

done vs sorowe & dysease. For our castel∣les
they haue taken / & our beestes slayne

that crys hym mercy. For ynough ye ha∣ue
done to vs & haue vs ouercome. And
for the loue of god y

 ye wyl suffre vs for
to lyue / & haue mercy on crysten people
that byleue in Cryste as ye do. ¶Whan
kynge Arthur herde this sorowe / he had
pyte of them & yaue them lyf & lymme
without ony more harme. And they fell
downe to his feet & thanked hym / & be∣came
his lyege men / & he tooke of them
homage. ¶And after that kyng Arthur
torned ayen with his hoste & came vnto
Yorke / and made there his bydynge du∣rynge
that vyage. And tho gaue he all
Logrys to Aloth y

 had spowsed his sy∣ster

was Gawyn his cosyn but of yonge ae∣ge.
And to all his other men that hym
had serued in his warre / he gaue ryche

theyr good seruyce.






¶How kynge Arthur spowsed Gūnor
that was Gūnors cosyn Erle of Corne¦wayle
/ and after he conquered of Guil∣lomer

ANd whan Arthur had brought
his londe in peas & reste and in
good state / & all was well in euery coū∣tree.
Tho toke he & wedded a wyf y
t
 was
called Gūnor & made her quene / a fayr
lady & a gentyll y
•
 Cador the erle of Cor¦newayle
had nourysshed in his chambre
that was his cosyn. But neuer they had
children togyder. And neuertheles kyng
Arthur loued her wonder well & deyely.
And anone as Wynter was passed / he

& sayd y
t
 he wolde go in to Irlonde
for to conquere the londe. And he caryed
not longe y

 he ne passed ouer into Irlon¦de.
¶And Guillomer the kynge lete as¦semble

comfyted & yelded hym to the kynge &
became his man / & to hym dyde fewte / and

Gutlonde & Islonde / & toke homa∣ge
of the folke & of the londe / and there
dwelled .xij. yere in peas & regned with

so curteys & large & honorable / that
the Emperours courte of Rome / ne no∣ne
other thrugh out all the worlde was
not accounted to kynge Arthurs / that
ony man wyst of / ne none so well pray∣sed.
And therfore the best kynght{is} of all
maner landes came vnto hym there for
to dwelle. And he theym receyued with
good wyll and reuerence. ¶And all the
knyghtes were so good that no man kne¦we
the werste. And therfore kynge Ar∣thur
made a roūde table that whan they
sholde sytte on ther meete / all sholde be
ylyke hyghe & euenly serued at the table
that none of them sholde make auaunt
that one of them were hygher thanne

table Brytons & Frenshmen. Normans
and Flemynges. Burgoyns Mausers &
Lotherins / & of al the londes a this half

/ and of the grete Corne waylle / of
Walys & of Irlonde / and of Scotlonde
And shortly to tell / of all the londes y

kynge Arthurs courte.






¶How kynge Arthur yede in to Fraū∣ce
& conquered y

 londe of Froll y

SYth it befell that thrugh coūsell
of his barons & lordes / kyng Ar∣thur
wolde go conquere all Fraūce that
tho was called Galle thrugh Romay∣nes
that tho helde that londe in theyr
power & in theyr gouernaunce. And the
Romayns had taken that londe to a no¦ble
knyzt & a worthy of body that was
called Froll. And whan he wyst that Ar∣thur
came / he ordeyned an hoste of a gre¦te
power & fought with the kynge. And
he & his folke were dyscomfyted & fled{is}
vnto Parys & entred y
•
 cyte / & closed the
yates & there helde them. ¶Whan Ar∣thur
wyst that Froll was gone to Parys
be pursued after & came thyder / & hym
besyeged. But the cyte was so stronge &
well arayed / & tho y
t
 were therin deffen∣ded
theym well & manly. ¶Kynge Ar∣thur
dwelled there more than a moneth.
& there was so moche people in the cyte
that they dyspended all theyr dytayle y
•

they had within. And so grete hungre be
came amonge them / y
t
 they deyed won∣derly
thycke within the cyte for hungre.
And came vnto Froll & prayed hym to
be accorded with kynge Arthur for to ha¦ue
peas / & they wolde yelde theym vnto
hym & the cyte also. ¶Froll sawe that
he myght no lenger holde the towne a∣yenst
theyr wyll / & trusted gretly vppon
his owne strength & sente to kynge Ar∣thur
that he sholde come fyght with hȳ
body for body / & so sholde they departe
Fraūce bytwene them two. ¶Kynge Ar¦thur
anone graūted it. And wolde not y
•

none of his people vndertoke the batay¦le
for hym. ¶And vpon the morne both
came well arayed without Par
s theret
that they sholde fyght. And anone they
smote togyders so fyersly & so well they
fought on bothe sydes y
•
 no man demed
the better of them / & so it befell y
•
 Froll
yaue Arthur suche a stroke that he kne∣led
to the grounde wolde be nolde he / And
as Froll woūded kynge Arthur in
the forhede y
•
 the blood fell downe by his

yen & his face. Arthur anone sterte vp
hertely whan he felte hȳ hurte as a man
that semed almoost wood. And he toke
taburne his good swerde / & drewe it vp
on hyghe and yaaf Froll suche a stroke
that therwith he claue his heed downe
to the sholders so that his helme myght
not be his warraunt / & so he fell downe
deed in the place. And thenne tho of the


cyte made greate sorowe for Froll. And
euerychone yelded them to kyng Arthur
and the towne also & became his men / &
dyde to hym homage & feaute. And he
receyued them & toke of them goodly ho¦stages.
And kyng Arthur after that wen¦te
forth with his hoste & conquered Au∣gien
& Angiers. Gascoyne. Pehito. Na∣uerne
and Bourgoyne. Berry. Lotherne
Turin and Peithers / and all the other
londes of Fraunce he conquered all ho∣ly.
Whan he had conquered & taken by
homages and feautees / he torned ayen
to Parys and there he dwelled longe ty∣me
/ & ordeyned peas longe tyme ouer al
the countree / and thorugh all Fraunce / ¶
And whan peas was made ouer all / thorugh
his noble kynghthode that he
hadde / and also for his owne worthynes
And no man were he neuer soo greate a
lorde durste not meue warre ayenst hym
nother to aryse for to make the londe of
Fraunce inquyete. And in peas he dwel∣led
there .ix. yere / and dyde many greate
wondres / & repreued many proude men
& euyll tyrauntes theym chastysed after
theyr demerytes.






¶How kynge Arthur auaunced all his
men that had trauaylled in his seruyce.


ANd afterwarde it befell thus at
Eester there that he helde a fest

And to Dorell his cosyn he yaue Boley¦ne.

fayre Eleyne that was cosyn vnto
Howell of lytell Brytayne. And hadde
brought her vpon an hylle that is called
the moūt of saynt Bernarde. And there
was no man in that coūtree so bolde ne
so hardy that durst fyght with hym / ne
come nye the place there that the gyaūt
dwelled that was called Dinabus. And
moche sorowe he dyde▪ in the countree / ¶
Whan kyng Arthur herde this tydyn¦ges
/ he called to hym Kay and Bed
were
& cōmaunded them to go pryuely & es∣pye
where the gyaunt myght be founde
And they came to the ry
age there that
men sholde go to the moūt / that was al
enclosed about with water & yet is / and
euer shall be. And they sawe a brennyn∣ge
fyre vppon the hylle. And there was
also an other hylle nye that / & there was
vpon that an other fyre brennynge. Kay
and Bedwere came to the next hylle / &
founde a wydowe open heeded syttynge
besydes a tombe sore wepynge / & grete
sorowe made. And oft she sayd Eleyne
eleyne. And Kay & Bedwere axed what
she was / & wherfore she made so moche
sorowe / and who laye in that tombe / ¶
O sayd she what sorowe & mysauen∣ture
fayre lordes seke ye here. For yf the
Gyaūt may you here fynde he wyll you
slee anone. ¶Be stylle good wyf sayd
they therof dysmaye you not / but tell vs
the south why that thou makest so mo∣che
sorowe & wepynge. ¶Syrs sayd she
For a damoysell that I nourysshed with
my breest that was called Eleyne / that
was nece to Howell of Brytayne. And
here lyeth the body in this tombe that to
me was taken to nourysshe. And so the∣re
came a deuyll a Gyaunt & rauysshed
her & me also / and ladde vs bothe with
hym awaye. And he wolde haue forlay∣ne
that mayde that was so yonge & ten∣dre
of aege / but she myght it not suffre
so grete & so huge as the Gyaunt was.
And for certayne yf he come now as he
is wont to do / he wyll you both now slee
& therfore go ye hens. Thenne bespake
these two messengers & sayd to her / wher¦fore
go ye not from hens. ¶Certes sayd
she whan that Eleyne was deed the Gy¦aunt
made me to abyde and haunt his


wyll / & I must nedes it suffre. And god
it wote I do it not wich my wyll / for I
had leuer to be deed than with hym to
deale / so moche payne & sorowe I haue
whan he me forlyeth. ¶Whan Kay and
Bedwere had herde all y
•
 this woman
them tolde / they torned ayen & came to
kynge Arthur & tolde hym all that they
had seen and herde. ¶Arthur anone to¦ke
them bothe with hym & wente pryue¦ly
by nyght that none of his hoste wyst
& came on the morowe erly to the Gy∣aunt
& faught with hym strongely / and
at the last hym slewe. And Arthur bad∣de
Bedwere smyte of his heed / & bryn∣ge
it to the hoste to shewe it for a won∣der

they came ayen to the hoste / they tolde
wherfore they had ben out / & shewed to
them the heed / & euery man was gladde
& Ioyefull of the worthy dede that kyn∣ge
Arthur had done that was theyr lor∣de.
And Howell was full sorowfull for
his nece that was so lost. And afterwar∣de
whan he had space / he lete make a
fayre chappell of our lady ouer Eleyn

tombe.






¶How kynge Arthur yaue bataylle to
the Emperour / in y
•
 whiche batayll the
Emperour hymself was slayne.


ARthur & his people herde tydyn¦ges
y
t
 the Emperour had assem¦bled
a grete power / as well of sarrasyns
as of paynems & crysten men. Wherof y
e

nombre was .lxxx. thousande hors men
 w
t
 foot men. ¶Arthur & his people orde¦ned
fast forth in theyr waye towarde the
Emperour & passed Normandy & Fraūce
vnto Burgoyne / & wolde haue gone vn¦to
the hoste. For men tolde hym that the
Emperours hoste wolde come to Lucie.
¶The Emperour & his hoste in the be¦gynnynge
of August teweued from Ro¦me
/ & came forth ryght the waye to war¦de
y
•
 hoste. ¶Tho came kynge Arthurs
spyes & sayd / yf that Arthur wolde he
sholde fynde the Emperour there faste
by / but they sayd / that the Emperour
had so grete power with hym of kynges
of the londe of Paynems / & also crysten
people that it were but foly to kynge Ar¦thur
to mete with them For the spyes 
ol¦de
/ that the Emperour had fyue or sixe
men ayenst one of his. ¶Kynge Arthur
was bolde & hardy / and for no thynge
hym nysmayed & sayd. Goo we boldely
in goddes name ayenst the Romayns / that
with them lede Sarrasyns & Pay∣nems
/ that no maner trust they haue in
god / but oonly vpontheyr strength. Go
we now & seke them sharpely in the na¦me
of almyghty god / & slee we the Pay∣nems
and Crysten men that ben ayenst
vs w
t
 them / for to destroye Crysten men
And god shall vs helpe them to ouerco∣me.
For we haue the ryght opynyon &
therfore haue we truste in god. And do
we so that the enmyes that be to crysten¦dome
& to god may be destroyed & ouer∣come
/ & that men may recorde the war∣thynesse
of knyghthode. ¶Whan kyng
Arthur hadde thus sayd / they cryed all
with an hygh voys. ¶God that is fad{er}
almyghty worshypped be thy name w
t

out ende. Amen. And graunt vs grace
well for to do / & to destroye our enmyes
that ben ayenst crystendome. In the na∣me
of the fader / the sone / and the holy
ghost. Amen. And god yeue hyen neuer
grace ne worshyp in the worlde / ne mer∣cy
of hym to haue / that this daye shall
faynte well for to smyte & egrely. And
so they rode softly / & ordeyned his wyn∣ges
well & wysely. ¶The Emperour
herde tell that kynge Arthur & his folke
were redy appareylled for to fyght with
hym & how they were camynge. He 

ordeyne his wynges in the best wyse that
he cowde. And more trusted vppon his
strength than in god almyghty / & that
was seen afterwarde. For whan the 

hostes mette / the Emperour lost 



of his folke ayenst one of Arthur. And
so many were slayne / what on that one
party & on that other / that it was grete
pyte to wyte & to beholde. ¶In this ba¦tayll
were slayne thrugh kyng Arthurs
fyne kynges of the Paynems & of other
wonder moche people / & kynge Arthurs
men fought so well / that the Romayns
and paynems had no more strengthe to
withstonde them / than .xx. shepe ayenst
fyue wulues. ¶And so it befelle that in
this batayll in the shoure / that was won¦der
harde & longe durynge in that one sy¦de
& in that other / the Emperour amon¦ge
them there was slayne / but ther was
noo man that wyste for very sothe who
hym slewe.






¶How kynge Arthur lete entyere his
knyghtes y
t
 he had lost there in batayll / &
how he sente the Emperours body to
Rome that there was slayne in batayll.


SO whan y
•
 Romayns wyst that
the Emperour was deed / they
forsoke the felde & y
•
 paynems also. And
kynge Arthur after them chaced tyll it
was nyght / & so many of them slewe y
t

it was wonder to telle. And tho torned
kynge Arthur ayen whan it was nyght
& thanked god of his victorye. And on
the morowe he lete loke & serche all the
felde for his knyghtes that he there lost.
That is to saye. Borell erle of Maunt.
Bedwere / & Kay / and Lyegiers erle of
Boleyne. Vortiger erle of Baac. Aloth
erle of Wynchestre. Cuisall erle of Che∣stre
/ and after Holden erle of Flaundres
These were the grete lordes that kynge
Arthur last in that batayll / with other
worthy knyghtes them amonge. And so∣me
he lete entere in abbayes by the coū∣tree
/ some he lete to be borne in to theyr
owne coūtre. ¶And the Emperours bo∣dy
he l
te take & put vpon a beyr & sent
it to Rome. And sayd to the Romayns / that
for Brytayne & Fraunce whichehe
helde / other truage wolde he none paye.
¶And yf they axed hym ony other trua¦ges
/ ryght suche truage he wolde theym
paye. ¶The kynge lete bere Kay to Ke∣nen
his owne castell / & there hym ente∣red.
And Leygier was borne to Boleyne
there he was lorde. And Holden was bor¦ne
to Flaundres / there he was entered / And
all the other he lete entere with mo¦che
honour in abbayes & in houses of re¦lygyon
in the coūtre that they were slay¦ne.
¶And Arthur hymself soiourned y
•

same yere in Bourgoyne with his hoste
& thought the same yere folowynge to
passe the mount Ioye / and haue gone to
Rome also to haue taken the cyte & ha∣ue
put the Romayns in subgeccyon / but
the wycked tyraunt Mordred hym lette∣as
after ye shall here.






¶How the traytour Mordred / to whom
kynge Arthur toke his londe to kepe &
his castelles / helde them ayenst hym.


AS Arthur had takē to Mordred
his reame to kepe / & gone ayenst
the Emperour of Rome / & was passed
the see. Mordred anone toke homages &
fea
tees of all theym that were in this
londe / & wolde haue had this londe to
his owne vse / & toke castelles about / and
lete them be arayed. And after this fal∣senesse
he dyde an other grete wronge / for
ayenst the lawe of crystente he tooke
his owne emys wyf as a traytour shol¦de
/ & ordeyned hym a grete hoste ayenst
Arthurs comynge / to holde the londe a∣yenst
hym with strength for euer more / &
to slee kynge Arthur yf he myght / &
sente by the see & by londe / & lete assem∣ble
paynems & crysten peple. And he sen¦te
to Saxons & to Danys for to helpe
hȳ. And also Mordred sent to Cheldrik
to sende men to hym out of Saxon that
was a worthy duke / & promysed hym yf
that he broght with hym moche people
he wolde graunte hym Inherytaūce for


euer / all the londe fro Humbre to Scot∣londe
/ & all the londe that Engist had
of Vortigers yefte / whan that he spow∣sed
his doughter. ¶And Cheldrik came
with a grete strength and power of peo∣ple
/ and Mordred hadde assembled also
on his half / that they had .xl. thousan∣de
of stronge knyghtes whan that they
had nede.






¶How Arthur enchaced Mordred the
traytour & how he was slayne / & also
kynge Arthur wounded to the deth.


AS this tydynges came to kynge
Arthur there y
t
 he was in Bour¦goyne
/ he was full sore anoyed / & toke
all Fraunce to Howell for to kepe with
half deale of his men. And prayed hym
that he wolde it kepe tyll he came ayen.
For hymself wolde passe in to Brytay∣ne
/ & auenge hym vpon mordred y
t
 was
his traytour. And forth with Arthur
wente his waye & came to Wytsande / and
made his men to go in to shyppe &
wolde haue arryued at Sandwyche / and
brought with hym a grete hoste of F
en¦she
en
also with his owne londe men / But
or that he myght come to londe w
t
 
his peple that were come out of his shyp¦pes.
Mordred was come with all his po∣wer
/ & yaue a stronge batayll / soo that
kynge Arthur loste many a man are
that he myght come to londe. For there
was Gawayne his neuewe slayne / and
Anguysshell that helde Scotlonde / and
many other wherof kynge Arthur was
full sory. But after they were come to
londe Mordred myght not ayenst them
endure. But anone was dyscomfyted &
fledde thens the same nyght with his
men / and vpon the morne came to Lon¦don.
But tho of the cyte wolde not suf∣fre
hym to come in. And from thens he
fledde to Wynchestre / and there he hym
helde with his people that came with hȳ
¶Kynge Arthur lete take the body of
Gawayne his cosyn / & the body of An∣guysshell
/ & lete that one be borne in to
Scotlonde / and the other to Douer and
buryed. Anone after kynge Arthur toke
his waye for to destroye Mordred / & he
fledde thens in to Cornewayle. ¶And
the quene Gunnor that was kynge Ar∣thurs
wyf that tho soiourned at Yorke / herde
that Mordred was fledde thens &
that he myght not endure ayenst kynge
Arthur / she was sore aferde & had grete
doubte / and wyste not what was best of
all for to done. For she vnderstode well
that her lorde kynge Arthur wolde ne∣uer
of her / for to haue mercy for the gre¦te
shame that she had done vnto hym / And
toke her waye pryuely with foure
men without moo / and came to Karly∣on
/ and there she dwelled all ther lyue / and
neuer after was seen amonges the
folke her lyf durynge. ¶Kynge Arthur
wyst that Mordred was fledde in to Cor¦newayle
/ and lete sende after his men
in to Scotlande and Northumberlonde
vnto Humbre / and lete assemble folke
without nombre / & came fro thens in to
Cornewayle to seke and pursewe after
Mordred. ¶And Mordred had assem∣bled
to hym all the folke of Cornewayle
& had people without nombre / and wyst
that Arthur was comynge / and had le∣uer
to deye & take his chaunce / than lon¦ger
flee and abode / and yaue an harde
batayll to kynge Arthur & to his people
so that moche people was slayne / what
of one syde & what of that other / that no
man wyst who had y
•
 better party. But
so it befell at the last that Mordred was
slayne & all his folke / and the good chy¦ualry
that kynge Arthur had gadred &
nourysshed of dyuerse londes / and also
the noble knyghtes of the rounde table / that
so moche were praysed thorugh out
all the worlde were there slayne / & kyn∣ge
Arthur hymself was wounded vnto
deth. But he lete hȳ to be borne to 


un to be heeled of his woundes. And


yet the Brytons supposen that he lyued
in an other londe / & that he shall come
yet & conquere all Brytayne. & But cer¦tes
this is the prophecye of Merlyn. He
sayd that his deth shall be doubtous / &
sayd soth. For therof yet men haue doub¦te
/ and shall haue for euer more as men
saye. For men wote not whyther that he
is on lyue or deed. ¶Arthur was borne
at Auioun the .xxij. yere of his regne / af∣ter
the Incarnacyon of our lorde Ihesu
Cryste .v.C.xlvi. yere.






¶How kynge Arthur delyuered the tra¦me
vnto Constantyne the sone of Ca∣dor
his neuewe.


AS kynge Arthur wyste that he
myght no lenger regne / he lete
come before hym Constantyne that was
Cadors sone erle of Cornewayle his co∣syn
& to hȳ betoke all his reame / & to hȳ
sayd / & badde hȳ therof to be kyng tyll
y
t
 he came ayen / for as moche as he had
none heyre of his body begoten. And gre¦te
damage was it
 that so noble a kyng
& so doughty as he was / had no childe
of his body begoten. But all thynge y
•

god woll haue done must be done / who∣se
name be blessyd without ende.






¶How kynge Constantyne was vexed
of Mordred two sones.


THis Constantyne was a noble
knyght & a worthy of body. And
th
 two sones that Mordred had bego∣ten
had grete enuy of Constantyne that
tho was crowned kyng. And so it befell
that they meued warre ayenst hȳ. And
assembled a grete hoste of them y
t
 were
before with Mordred / & had ben dryuen
awaye / & that dyde moche sorowe & an
guysshe thrughout all that londe. That
one brother ordeyned / & purposed hym
towarde the auncyent cyte of London / for
to take the cyte. And that other wen¦te
to Wynchestre. But Constantyne ca∣me
to London and slewe hym that was
there. And after he went to Wynchestre
and slewe hym that was there also. So
that bothe his enmyes were deed. ¶And
whan Constantyne had regned well &
worthely foure yere / he deyed and lyeth
at London.






¶Of the kynges Adelbright and of
Edell.


AFter kynge Constantynes deth
there were two kynges in Bry∣tayne
/ that one was called Adelbright y
•

was a danoys. And he helde the coūtree
of Northfolke & Southfolke. That o∣ther
hyght Edell & was a Bryton / & he
helde Nicholl. Lindeser / & all the londe
vnto Humbre. These two kynges faste
warred togyder / but after accorded they
were & loued togyder / as they had ben
borne of oo body. ¶The kynge Edell
had a syster that was called Ore
enne.
And he gaf her thrugh grete frendshyp
to kynge Adelbright to wyf. And he be∣gate
vpon her a doughter y
t
 was called
Argentyll. And in the thyrde yere after
came vpon hym a strange syknesse that
nedes he must deye. And he sente to kyn¦ge
Edell his broder in lawe that he shol¦de
come & speke with hym / & he came to
hym with a good wyll. ¶Tho prayed
he the kynge and coniured hym also in
the name of god / that after whan he we¦re
deed / he sholde take his doughter Ar∣gentyll
& the londe / & that he kepte her
well / and nourysshe her in his chambre.
And whan she were of aege / she sholde
be maryed to y
•
 strōgest & worthyest man
that he myght fynde / & thenne he sholde
yelde vp her londe ayen ¶Edell it graū¦ted
& by othe confermed his prayer. And
whan Adelbright was deed & enteryd / Edell
toke the damoysell Argentyll / &
nourysshed her in his chambre / & she be∣came
as fayre as ony myght be.








¶How kynge Edell maryed that da∣moysell
to a knaue of his kechyne.


THis kynge Edell that was vncle
to Argentyll / bethought how y
•

he myght fallely haue the londe fro his
nece for euer more / & falsely ayenst his
othe thought to dysceyue Y
•
 damoysell / &
to marye her to a knaue of his kechyn y
t

was called Curan / & he became the wor∣chyest
& strongest man of body y
t
 ony mā
wyst in ony londe y
•
 tho lyued / & to hym
he thought her shamfully haue maryed
for to haue had her londe afterwarde / but
he was clene disceyued. For this Cu¦ran
was Hauelockis sone y
t
 was kyng of
Kyrkelane in Denmark / & this Curan
conquered his wyues londe afterwarde
& slewe kyng Edell y
t
 was his wyues vn¦cle
& had al her londe / as in an other pla¦ce
it telleth more openly / & he regned but
thre yere / for Saxons & Danes hȳ slewe
& that was grete harme to all Brytay∣ne
& Brytons bare hym to Stonehenge
and entyred hym honourably.






¶Of kyng Conan y
t
 was Curans cosyn.


AFter this Curan regned his co∣syn
Conan that was a wonder
proude knyght. And regned & coude ha∣ue
noo maner of loue / but euer he was
medlynge with his people. And toke his
vncle with warre / & slewe his two chil∣dern.
¶The Saxons warred ayenst hȳ
oftentymes / but he them ouercame / & so
he was in peas all his lyf tyme. And he
regned .xiiij. yere / and after he deyed &
lyeth at London.






¶Of kynge Cortyf and of Gurmonde
that came thorugh the paynems in to
Brytayne.


AFter this Conan regned his co∣syn
Cortyf y
t
 was beha
ed of al
his peple & no thynge beloued. And this
Cortyf lost all Brytayne thrugh warre
And in his tyme fell y
•
 grete myscheyf in
Brytayne y
•
 crystendom was destroyed / &
all the Brytons were dryuen out of y
•

londe & the londe lost without ony reco∣uer.
But afterwarde lefte the londe to
the Saxons as ye afterwarde shall he∣re.
For in that tyme there was a paynem
that was called Gurmonde / that was
the kynges sone Daufrices of the par∣nems
folke / that hadde the reame after
his fader / & was kynge / sauf he be
ua∣ue
& yaue it to his broder. And sa
d that
he nolde neuer be kynge but yf that he
myght gete and conquere a reame in a
straūge countree. For he was bolde and
stronge of body. And of hȳ prophecyed
Merlyn & sayd
 that he sholde be a wul

of the see. And he lete assemble 

without nombre / & lete appareylle shyp¦pes
/ and wente by many londes & toke
homages and fea
tees of many. And
so he wente by the see & conquered ma
ny
dyuerse londes. Soo that he came in
to Irlonde / & conquered that londe that
oftentymes warred vpon Brytons and
Brytons vpon them / & oft wonne & oft
lost & yaue hostages to Brytons. And so
they sente to Gurmonde there that be
was in Irlonde
 that he sholde come in
to Brytayne and helpe them ayenst the
Brytons / to helpe them to delyuer that
londe of them / & they wolde hym holde
gladly for theyr lorde. For he was a pay¦nem

& they were paynems
 & the Bry∣tons
were crystened. Well ought he them
for to helpe so as they were all of one la¦we.
Whan Gurmonde herde this pray∣er
he hasted hym as moche as he myght
and arryued in Scotlonde / and came in
to Northumberlonde there that the Sax¦ons
were dwellynge / & they confermed
the couenauntes bytwene them that we∣re
made by othes & by hostages / f
r to
bere hym true fay / & holde hym for lor∣de
/ and paye to hym truage by the yere / ¶
Tho began the Saxons and the Af∣fricans


to destroye robbe & brenne tow∣nes
/ & destroye all thynge in asmoche as
they myght / & spared neyther man wo∣man
ne childe / lerned ne lewde / but all
they slewe / & cast downe townes castels
& chirches / & so put they all the londe in
grete destruccyon. And as soone as they
myght flee / they fled{is} thens as wel poore
as ryche / bysshops / abbottes / chanons / &
all other grete & small / some in to lytell
Brytayne / & some in to Cornewayle / al
tho that shyppes myght haue.






¶How the kynge Gurmonde droue
kynge Cortyf to Chechestre / & slewe the
Brytons / and thrugh crafte & engyne
gate the same towne.


COrtyf the kynge fledde thens in
to Chechestre y
t
 tho was stronge / &
the
e helde hȳ .xx. dayes / & this Gur∣monde
came & it besyeged. But the cyte
was so stronge y
t
 he myght not gete it by
no manere of wyse w
t
 engyne that they
myght do. Tho bethought they vpon a
subtylte for to brenne the towne. They
made engynes w
t
 glewe of nettes / & to∣ke
pecys of thonder & of fyre & bonde it
to sparowes feet / & than lete them flee / &
they anone flewe & lodged them in y
•

towne there y
t
 theyr nestis were / & in stac∣kes
& euesynges of houses / & y
•
 fyre be∣gan
to kyndle & brente all the towne / And
whan y
•
 Brytons sawe that in eue∣ry
syde they hyed them out & fought / but
anone they were slane & dyscomfyted / And
whyle the batayll dured the kynge
pryuely hydde hym & stale awaye in to
Walys / & men wyst neuer were he beca∣me
/ & so was y
e
 towne of Chechestre ta∣ken
& destroyed. And after Gurmonde
wente & destroyed townes & cytes that
neuer were after made ayen / as it is seen
yet in many places of this londe.






¶How this londe was called Englonde
for the name of Engist / & how many
kynges were made after in this londe.


SO whan Gurmonde had destoy¦de
all the londe thrugh out / he ya¦ue
the londe to y
•
 Saxons / & anone they
toke it w
t
 good wyll / for the Saxons lon¦ge
tyme had desyred it. For asmoche as
they were of Engyst{is} kynrede that fyrst
had all y
•
 londe of Brytayne & lete them
be called Englysshmen / for by cause of
Engistes name / & y
•
 londe they lete call
Englonde in theyr langage / & the folke
ben called Englyshmen / for asmoche as
in his tyme it was called Engist{is} londe
whan he had conquered it of Vortiger / that
spoused his doughter. But fro y
e
 ty¦me
that Brute came fyrst in to Englon¦de
/ this londe was called Brytayne / & y
•

folke Brytons. But syth the tyme y
t
 this
Gurmonde conquered it eftsones / & ya¦ue
it vnto the Saxons / they anone ryght
chaūged y
•
 name as before is sayd. And
whan this was done. Gurmonde pas∣sed
ouer in to Fraūce / & there conquered
many londes / & destroyed all crysten pe∣ple
there that he came. And the Saxons
dwelled in this londe & began fast to en¦habyte
it at her owne wyl. And they wol¦de
haue made newe kyng{is} & lordes / but
they myght neuer assent to haue oonly
oo kynge for to be to them attendaunt / &
therfore they made many kynges in
dyuerse shyres / as it was in Engistes ty¦me.
The fyrst kyngdome was Kente / &
that other Southsexe / and the thyrde
Westsex / the fourth Eestsex / & the fyfth
Northumberlonde / & the sixth Estangle
that is to saye Northfolke & Southfolk
and the seuenth Mercheryche / & that is
the Erldome of Nicholl. Huntyngdon.
Herforde. Gloucetre. Wynchestre. Wer∣wyke
& Derby / and so departed all En¦glonde
in to .vij. partyes. ¶And after
that it befell that tho kyng{is} warred oft¦tymes
togyder. And euer he y
t
 was stron¦gest
toke hym that was feblest / and so it
was longe tyme that they had no kyng


crowned amonge theym / ne no crysten
man was tho amonge them / ne crysten∣dome
nother. But were paynems tyll y
•

saynt Gregory was pope of Rome / that
had seen childern of the nacyon of En∣glonde
in the cyte of Rome / that were
wonder fayre creatures / & had grete wyl
& desyre theym to beholde. And axed of
the marchauntes whens they were / & of
what nacyon. And men tolde hym that
they were of Englonde / and Englysshe
they were called / but they & all the peple
of Englonde were paynems / & byleued
not vpon god. ¶Alas sayd saynt Gre∣gory
/ well mowe they be called Englys∣she
/ for they haue the vysages of angels
& therfore well ought they to be cryste∣ned.
And for this cause saynt Gregory
sente there saynt Austyn in to Englon∣de
and .xl. good men with hym that were
of good lyf & holy men to preche & teche
& to conuerte the Englysshe people and
them to torne to god / & that was in the
.vi. yere that saynt Gregory had be po∣pe
of Rome / that is to saye / after thyn∣carnacōn
of our lorde Ihesu Cryst .v.C.lxxxv.
yeres as the Cronycle telleth.






¶How saynt Austyn baptysed & conuer¦ted
kynge Adelbryght & the bysshoppes
that he made his felowes.


AS saynt Austyn came fyrste in
to Englonde / he arryuen in the
Yle of Tenet / & so passed forth & came
vnto Caunterbury and there soiourned.
And kynge Adelbryght of Kente y
t
 was
of the lygnage of Engist goodly recey∣ued
saynt Austyn & his felowes w
t
 mo∣che
honour / & them foūde all that them
neded. And more ouer he yaue them a
fayre place / that now is called the ab∣bay
of saynt Austyn / in whiche place he
lyeth hymself shryned. ¶This kynge
Adelbryght was a good man and with
good wyll herde saynt Austyn
 predyca∣cyons
/ & yaue hym leue to preche thrugh
out all his londe before sayd of Kent / to
torne and conuerte to hym all the peo∣ple
that he myght. ¶It betelle so after
thorugh goddes grace / that in lytell ty∣me
the kynge hymself was conuerted to
god / & all his people of his londe were
baptysed. And in the meane whyle the
peple torned them to god. ¶Saynt Au∣styn
came to Rochestre / and there he pre¦ched
the worde of god. And y
•
 paynems
therfore hym scorned / & caste vpon hym
reygh taylles / soo that all his mantell
was hanged full of these reygh tayles / And
for more despyte / they caste vppon
hym the guttes of reyghes and other fys¦she.
Wherfore the good man sa
 Au∣styn
was sore anoyed and greued. And
prayed to god that all tho children of
that cyte that sholde be borne afterwar¦de
/ that is for to saye / in the cyte of Ro∣chestre
/ myght haue taylles and so they
hadde. And whan the kynge herde of
this vengeaunce that was falle thrugh
saynt Austyns prayer. He lete make an
house in the honour of almyghty god / wherin
wymmen sholde be delyuered
of theyr childern a
 the brydges ende / In
the whiche hous yet wymmen of the
cyte ben delyuered of childe. ¶Whan
that saynt Gregorye hadde herde telle
how the Englysshe people were torned
to god & conuerted / he sente vnto saynt
Austyn his pallyon by a bysshop / that
was called Paulin and made hym P
∣mate
and Archebysshop of Englonde / And
sente worde that he sholde ordeyne
& make bysshops in the londe. And ano∣ne
Austyn had the pallyon of the dygny¦te
of the Archebysshop. He made two
bysshops of his felowes that came with
hym fro Rome / & one was called Melli∣te
& he dwelled at London / & that other
was called Iustin that helde the dygny∣te
at Rochestre. And this bysshop Melli¦te
tho wente to preche in to Es
sex & cry∣stened
the kyng of the coūtre that was
called Sicwith / that was kynge Adel∣bryghtes


cosyn his systers sone. This
Iustin wente to preche in Southsex and
torned moche of the people to god. And
saynt Austyn hymselfe preched thorugh
out Englonde.






¶How saynt Austyn wente in to Wa∣les
there the Brytons were / & how they
wolde not be obedyent to the Archebys∣shop
of Caunterbury.


SO whan all Englonde was cry¦stened
& torned to god / saynt Au¦styn
went in to that londe there that the
Brytons were for to kepe them frō En∣glysshmen
/ that is to saye in to Walys
And there he fonde monkes & abbayes
& .vij. bysshops. For the Brytons alwaye
destroyed the crysten people y
•
 saynt Au∣styn
had conuerted. And he sayd to the
bysshops y
t
 he was a Legate of Rome &
Prymate of all Englonde / & that they
sholde by all reason to hym be obedyent
& they sayd they nolde / but to the Arche¦bysshop
of Carlyon they wolde. They
wolde neuer for no maner thynge be o∣bedyent
to the Englysshmen. For y
•
 En¦glysshmen
they sayd ben our aduersa∣ryes
& our enmyes / & haue dryuen vs out
of our countree / & we ben crysten men &
euer haue be. And the Englysshmen ha¦ue
euer be paynems / but now of late y
t

they ben conuerted. ¶Saynt Austyn of
them myght haue none answere other
wyse / but sayd pertly that they wolde ne¦uer
them meke to hym / ne to the pope of
Rome. And saynt Austyn torned ayen
tho to kynge Adelbryght that was kyn∣ge
of Kente / & tolde hym that his folke
wolde not be to no man obedyent / but to
y
•
 Archebysshop op Carlyon. And whan
the kynge herde this / he was sore anoyd
& sayd that he wolde them destroye / and
sente to Elfryde kynge of Northumber∣londe
that was his frende / that he shol∣de
come to hym with all the power that
he myght & y
t
 he wolde mete hȳ at Ley∣cette
/ and fro thens they wolde go in to
Walys / & there destroye the Archebys∣shop
of Carlyon / and all tho that had
refused saynt Austyn.






¶How kynge Adelbryght & the kynge
Elfryde slewe Brecinall y
t
 was a kyng
of Brytons y
t
 helde y
e
 coūtree of Leycetre


IT befelle so y
t
 there was a kynge
of Brytons y
t
 helde the coūtree of
Leycetre & all the coūtree about / his na∣me
was Brecinall. And this Bryton her¦de
telle y
t
 tho two Englysshe kyng{is} wol¦de
mete there at Leycetre for to go in to
Walys. He lete ordeyne all the power y
t

he had for to go fyght w
t
 these two kyn¦ges
/ but lytell it auayled hȳ / for his fol∣ke
y
t
 he had were slayne & hȳself fledde / &
loste his londes for euer more. ¶And
thele two kynges Adelbryght & Elfryde
dwelled a whyle at Leycetre / & departed
the londe amonge them / & toke homag{is}
& feautees of the folke of the countree.
And after they wente towarde Walys / &
tho of Walys herde telle of the scom∣fyture
y

 Brecinall had at Leycetre / & we¦re
wonder sore adrad of tho two kyng{is}.
& toke & chose amonges them good men
and holy of heremytes / monkes & pr

wente bare foot & wulwarde for to ha∣ue
mercy of these two kynges. But tho
kyng{is} were so sterne & so wycked y
t
 they
wolde neuer speke to them but them sle∣we
euerychone. Alas for sorowe / for they
ne spared them no more than the wulf
doth y

 shepe / but smote of theyr heedes
euerychone / & so they were all martred
y
t
 tho them came / that is to vnderstande
.v.C. & .xl. After they went fro thens to
Bangor for to slee al those y
t
 they myght
there fynde of y

 Brytons. And whan y
•

Brytons herde that / they assembled & or¦deyned
all ther power for to fyght with
them. Tho was there a baron in Walys
that was called Bledrik of Cornewale


that somtyme was lorde of Deuenshy∣re
but the kynge Adelbright had dryuen
hym out in to Walys / & after there he
yaue them batayll. And at that batayll
was kynge Adelbright slayne / & Elfry∣de
sore woūded & forsoke the felde / & the
moost partye of his people slayne. And
Elfryde fledde in to Northumberlonde
that was his owne londe. ¶And after
the people of Leycetre shyre made with
strength Cadewan that was Brecinals
sone kynge of Leycetre / & he after reg∣ned
nobly & with grete honour.






¶How Cadewan kynge of Leycetre &
Elfryde kyng of Northumberlonde we¦re
frendes / & of the debate y
t
 after was
bytwene Edwyn & Cadwalyn that we∣re
bothe theyr sones.


ANd after that this batayll was
done y
t
 Brytons assembled them
& wente thens & came to Leycetre / & ma¦de
there Cadewan y
t
 was Brecinals so∣ne
kynge of Leycetre & of all the coūtree
And he toke homages & feauters of all
the folke of the coūtree. And after that
he assembled a grete hoste / & sayd he wol¦de

Northumberlonde after his faders deth
as his fader had holde all his lyf tyme.
¶And Cadewan had an other sone cal¦led

 and
these loued as brethern. And the loue la∣sted

called Bryens / so y
t
 they assembled a gre¦te
hoste in bothe partyes. And at the last
it befell that Cadwalin was dyscomfy∣ted
/ & Edwyn hym pursued & droue hȳ
fro place to place / so at the last he fledde
in to Irlond. And the other destroyed &
pylled his londe / & cast downe castels &
brente his maners / & departed all Cad∣walins

longe tyme after came Cadwalin ayen
fro Irlonde with a stronge power / & in
playne batayll slewe Edwyn & all his

¶How kyng Os walde was slayne tho∣rugh
kyng Cadwalin & Peanda & how
Oswy that was saynt Oswaldes brod{er}
regned after hym & slewe Peanda.


AS Edwyn was slayne. Offris
his sone vndertoke the warre a∣yenst
Cadwalin his came so y
t
 this Of¦fris
deyed durynge y

 warre. And after
y

 deth of this Offris tho regned a gentyl
crysten man y

 moche loued god almygh¦ty
y
t
 had all the londe of Northumberlon
by herytage / that was called Os walde / &
he was kynge of all y

 londe. But for
as moche as he was frende to Edwyn / &
helde a grete parte of y
•
 londe of Cad¦walin.
This same Cadwalin warred
vpon hym & droue hym towarde Scot∣londe.
And whan Cadwalin sawe y
t
 he
wolde not abyde. Cadwalin wolde noo
lenger hym pursue / but toke some of 
is
folke to Peanda his brod{er} in lawe & pray¦ed
hym to pursue after Oswalde / tyll y
•

he werr taken & slayne / & Cadwalin tor¦ned
home ayen. ¶Whan Os walde 
er∣de
these tydyng{is} y

 Cadwalin turned ho¦me
ayen / he wolde no lenger flee but a∣bode
Peanda & yaue hym batayll
 and
Peanda was dyscomfyted & fledde / & ca¦me
ayen to Cadwalin & sayd / y
t
 he wol∣de


de neuer holde oo foot of londe of hym / but
yf so were that he wolde auenge hȳ
of Oswalde. ¶Cadwalin lete assemble
a grete hoste for to fyght with Oswald
so that he & Peanda came to Northum∣berlonde
& yaue batayll vnto Oswalde
And in the same batayll was Oswalde
slayne & his heed smyte
 of / & after he
was entered at the abbay of Berdenay
in whiche place god had wrought for hȳ
many a fayre myracle / both there & elles
where. ¶And anone Oswy his brother
seased all the londe in to his honde that
was this Oswaldes. And the folke of
Northumberlonde loued hym wonderly
well / & helde hym for theyr lorde. But
he had men of his kȳne worthy ynough
that wolde haue departed the londe / and
they warred togyder wel. And for as mo¦che
as they were not stronge ynoughe / they
came to Peanda & prayed hym of
helpe & socour. And behyght hȳ of that
londe largely vpon this couenaūt / that
he wolde them gouerne & helpe / & coun∣seyll.
¶Peanda herde theyr prayer / and
so spake with Cadwalin / that he sholde
ordeyne a grete hoste / & faste ordeyne hȳ
in to Northumberlonde for to fyght with
Oswy. And Oswy was a meke man / &
moche loued peas & charyte / & prayed
Peanda of loue & pens / & profred hym
of golde and syluer grete plente. ¶And
this Peanda was so proude that he nol∣de
graunt hym peas for no maner thyn¦ge
/ but for all thynge he wolde with hȳ
fyght. Soo at the last there was sette a
daye of batayll. And Oswy euer trusted
vpon god / and Peanda trusted to moche
vpon pryde & vpon his hoste that he had
And togyder they smote egrely / but Pe∣anda
was anone dyscomfyted & slayne
And this was after the Incarnacyon of
our lorde Ihesu Cryste .v.C.lv. yere.
And this Oswy regned .xxviij. yere. And
a kynge that was called Oswyne / that
was Peandaes cosyn warred vpon hym
and togyder fought / but Oswy had the
victory of Oswyne. And Oswyne was
dyscomfyted & slayne / and lyeth at Tyn¦nemouth.






¶How kyng Cadwaldre that was Cad¦walins
sone regned after his fader / and
was the last kynge of Brytons.


AFter the deth of Cadwalin reg∣ned
his sone Cadwaldre well &
nobly. And his moder was the syster of
Peanda. And whan he had regned .xij.
yere / he felle in to a grete syknenesse / &
then̄e was there a grete dyscorde bytwe∣ne
the lordes of the londe / that euery of
them warred vppon other. And yet in y
•

tyme there fell so grete derth & scarsyte
of corne & other vitaylles in this londe / y
t

a man myght go .iij. or .iiij. dayes fro
towne to towne y
t
 he sholde not fynde to
bye for golde ne syluer brede. wyne. ne no¦ne
other vitayle wherwith a man myght
lyue. But oonly the people lyued by rot{is}
of herbes / for other lyuyng had they no∣ne
/ so moche was it faylled all abowte / fysshes / wylde
beestes / & all other thyn∣ge
so that yet to this mysauenture / there
fell so grete mortalyce & pestylente amō¦ge
the people by the corrupcion of y

 ayre
that the lyuynge people suffysed not to
burye the deed bodyes. For they deyed so
sodenly / both grete & smale / lorde & ser∣uaūt / in
etynge goynge & spekynge / they
fell downe & deyed / so y
t
 neuer was her∣de
of more sodeyne deth amonge the peo¦ple.
For he y
t
 wente for to burye the deed
body / with the same deed body was bu∣ryed.
And so they that myght flee / fledde
& forsoke theyr londes & houses / as well
for the grete hungre / derth & scarsyte of
corne & other vitayll / as for y
•
 grete mor¦talyte
& pestylence in the londe / & wente
in to other londes for to saue theyr lyues
& lefte the londe all deserte & wast / so y
t

there was no man for to trauayle & tyl∣the
the londe. So that the londe was ba¦rayne
of corne & all other fruytes for de∣
a

of tyllyers / and this mysauenture
dured .xi. yere and more / that noo man
myght ere ne sowe.






¶How Cadwaldre wente oute of this
londe in to lytell Brytayne.


CAdwaldre sawe grete hūgre mor∣talyte
& pestylence / and the londe
all poore / & faylynge cornes & other vy∣taylles
/ and his folke perysshed / & sawe
also y

 moost partye of his londe all wa∣sted
& voyde of people. He appareylled
hym & his folke that were lefte a lyue / &
passed ouer in to lytell Brytayne with
a lytell nauy vnto kynge Alayne that
he moche loued / that was his cosyn / and
that his fader had moche loued in his ty¦me.
And as they sayled in the see / he ma¦de
moche lamentacyon / & so dyde all tho
that were with hym and sayd (Dedisti¦nos
dn̄e tan
 oues esca{rum}. et in gentibus
dispersisti nos)


ANd thenne began Cadwaldre to
complayne hym to his folke py∣tously
& sayd. Alas sayd he. to vs wret∣ches
& caytyues is sorowe for our grete
synnes / the whiche we wolde not amen∣de
vs whyle we had space / & now repen¦taunce
is comen vpon vs thrugh mysa∣uenture
/ whiche chaced vs out of our rea

s

/ neyther Danys / myght not exyle
vs. ¶But what auaylleth it now to vs
that before tyme / ofte tymes haue goten
many other londes / syth it is not y

 wyll
of god that we abyde and dwelle in our

myght not vs ne our lygnage exyle fro / and
out of our reame. He wolde that we
amende vs of our folyes / & that we see
our propre defawtess. And therfore hath
shewed to vs wrath / and woll chastyse
vs of our mysdedes. Syth that he doeth
vs without batayl / or strength of our en¦myes
/ by greate companyes wretchedly
to leue our reame & propre londe. ¶Tor¦ne
agayne ye Romayns / torne agayne
ye Scottes / torne agayne ye Saxons / tor¦ne
agayne ye Fraūsoys. Now sheweth
to you Brytayne all deserte / the whiche
your power myght neuer make deserte / ne

lamentacyon that the kynge Cadwal∣dre
made to his folke / they arryued in ly¦tell
Brytayne / and came to kynge Aley
ne before sayd. ¶And the kynge recey∣ued
hym with grete Ioye / & made hym
to be serued wonder nobly. And there a∣bode
they longe tyme after. ¶The En¦glysshe
people that were left a lyue and
were escaped the grete hungre & morta∣lyte
/ lyued in the best wyse y
•
 they myght
And moche people sprange & came of
them. ¶And they sente in to Saron
e
where that they were borne to theyr fron¦des
for men / wymmen / and childern to
restore the cytees with people & to w∣nes
that were all voyde of people / & for
to labour / traueylle / and tylthe the erthe
¶Whan the Saxons berde these trdyn¦ges
/ they came in to the londe wonder
thycke in grete companyes / and herbe∣rowed
themself in the coū
er all about
where that they wolde / for they founde
no man them for to lette ne withstonde.
And so they wexed & multeplyed gretly.
And vsed the maners and customes of
the coū
re wherof they were come. And
they vsed also the lawes and the langa∣ges
and speche of theyr owne londe that
they came fro. And also they chaunged
all the names of cytees / townes / castel∣les
/ and brughs / and yaue them names


and called them as they now ben called
And they helde the Countees. Barona∣ges
& lordshyps in manere as the Bry∣tons
before tyme had compassed them / And
amonge other greate companyes
that came from Germayne in to this
londe / came y
•
 noble quene that was cal¦led
Sexburga with men & wȳmen with¦out
nombre. And arryued in the coūtree
of Northumberlonde / & toke the londe
from Albion vnto Cornewaylle for her
& for her folke. For there was none that
myght them lette / for all was desolate &
vayde of people / but it were a fewe poore
Brytons that were lefte on mountayns
& woodes vntyll that tyme. ¶And fro
that tyme forth loste the Brytons this
reame for all theyr dayes. And the Eu∣glysshe
people began to regne / & depar∣ted
the londe bytwene them. And they
made many kynges aboute by dyuerse
partyes of the londe as here ben diuyded
The fyrst of Westsexe / the seconde Mer¦cheurtche
/ the thyrde Estangle / the four∣the
kente / the fyfth Southsex. All those
regned in this londe after y
•
 Cadwaldre
was passed out of this londe / & dwelled
in lytell Brytayne with kynge Alayne
his cosyn & true frende. And whan he
had longe dwelled there / and had kno∣w
ge
that the mortalyte & pestylence
was ouerpassed and that the londe was
repleaysshed ayen w
t
 people / he thought
to tome ayen in to his londe. And prayed
kynge Aleyne his cosyn of socour & hel∣pe
that he myght be restored ayen to his
owne propre reame and fyrfst dygnyte / And
kynge Aleyne graunted hym his
askynge. ¶Thenne dyde he appareylle
hym to take his waye and vyage in to
this londe. And prayed god almyghty de¦noutely
that he wolde make to hym de∣monstracyon
/ yf his prayer to this londe
were to hym pleasaūt or none / for ayenst
the wyll of god almyghty he wolde noo
thynge do. ¶Whan he had thus deuou∣tely
made his prayer / a boys fro heuen
to hym sayd. And badde hym leue that
Iourney awaye in to Englonde / & that
he sholde go to the pope of Rome / for it
was not the wyll of almyghty god that
the Brytons sholde regne more in Bry∣tayne
/ ne neuer recouer it vnto the tyme
of the prophecye that Merlyn sayd befo¦re
be fulfylletd. And that sholde neuer
be vnto the tyme were come / that the re∣lyques
of his body shall be brought fro
Rome and translated in to Brytayne / And
whan the relykes of other sayntes
that haue ben hydde for the persecucion
of the paynem folke shall be founde and
and opely shewed / thenne shal they reco¦uer
theyr londe ayen / the whiche they ha¦ue
so longe tyme lost thrugh theyr deser¦tes.
¶Whan Cadwaldre had herde this
answere / he meruaylled gretly and tol∣de
it to kynge Aleyne. ¶Thenne kynge
Aleyne dyde sende for the clergye of his
londe / and made them to brynge the sto¦ryes
& prophecyes that Me
lyn and Sy¦byll
had sayd in theyr prophecyes. And
whan he knewe that the prophecye that
festom had prophecyed of the Egle. and
other prophecyes accorded to the dy
yn
answere that Cadwaldre had herde. He
counseylled hym / and ryght faythfully
desyred hym to leue his people & his na¦uy
/ and submytte hym to the dyspolicy∣on
of god / and do all that the aungell
had cōmaunded hym. ¶Thenne Cad∣waldre
called Ynor his sone / and Yuori
his cosyn that was his systers sone / and
sayd to them. Taketh sayd he my folke
& my nauy that is here all redy / and pas¦se
in to Walys & be ye lordes of Brytons
that no dyshonour come to them by in∣terrupcyon
of the Paynem folke for de∣faute
of lordes. ¶And then he hymself
lefte his reame of Brytayne and his fol¦ke
for euer more / and toke his waye vn∣to
the pope of Rome Sergius / the whi∣che
worshypped hym moche / and soo he
was confessyd / and toke penaunce for
his synnes. And he had not longe dwel∣led


there that he ne deyed / the .xij. Ka∣lendis
in May / the yere of grace .v.C.lxxix.






¶How kyng Offa was souerayne abo¦ue
all the kynges of Englonde / & how
euery kynge warred vpon other.


IT befell so that all the kynges in
that tyme that were in the londe.
as they of Westsex. Marchenrych. Estan¦gle
/ of Kente / & of Southsex / & of other
c
stes / eche warred vpon other. And he
that was moost myghty toke the londe
of hym that was moost feblest. ¶But
there was a kynge amonge them that
was called Offa / y
t
 was saynt Oswal∣des
brother. This Offa conquered all
the kynges of the londe / & regned aboue
them all. ¶And so grete was the warre
in euery countree bytwene kynges / that
no man myght wyte how the londe wen¦te.
¶But abbotes / pryours / and men of
Relygyon wrote the lyues and dedes of
kynges / and how longe euery of them
regned & in what countree / and in what

¶How the kynge of Northumberlonde
Osbryght forlaye the wyf of Buerne
Bocarde thrugh strength / & after this
Buerne conquered the kynge with po∣wer
and strength.


ANd thus it befell in the same ty∣me
/ that there was a kynge in
Northumberlonde that was called Os∣bryght
/ and soiourned at Yorke. ¶And
this kynge wente hym vppon a daye in
to a wood hym for to dysporte. And as
he came ayen / he wente pryuely in to a
good mannes house / that was called
Buerne / and the good man of that pla¦ce
was gone that tyme to the set. ¶For
oftentymes there he was wonte to spye
theues and robbers / that oftentymes we¦re
wonte to come in to the londe / to rob∣be
/ brenne / and slee. The lady that was
Buernes wyf was a wonder fayre wo∣man.
¶And the kynge came vnto her
whan that her husbonde was absente / And
she trusted none harme vnto the
kynge / and welcomed hym with moche
honour / and worthely hym serued in all
thynge. ¶Whan the kynge had eten / he
toke the lady by the hande and ladde
her in to a chambre and sayd. He wolde
speke with her a counseyll. And all the
folke he made voyde fro the chambre / 
saue oonly the lady and he. But the la∣dy
wyst not wherfore he it dyde tyll that
he had done all his wyll. And whan he
had done this dede / he tormed agayne to
Yorke. And the lady he lefte there sort
wepynge for the dede that the kynge to
her hadde done. ¶And whan her lorde
was come home and sawe her wepe and
suche sorowe and mornynge make / he
axed of her what she hadde done / and
why she made suche sorowe. ¶S
re she
sayd / subtylly and falsely the kyng Os∣bryght
hath do me shame and vylanye
ayenst my wyll. And tolde hym all the
truthe how the kynge had forlayne her
with sh
ngth / wherfore she sayd she had
leuer to be deed than to lyue. ¶Fayre lo∣ue
be styll sayd he / for ayenst strengthe
feblenesse is lytell worthe / and therfore
of me shalt thou neuer the lesse be loued
and namely for thou haste tolde me the
truthe. And yf almyghty god graunt to
me my lyf I shall the auenge. ¶This
Buerne was a grete man and a myghty
lorde / and was well beloued & grete fren∣des


had. And lete sende for the grettest
lordes of the loude / & to them made his
complaynt of the despyte that the kyn∣ge
to hym had done and sayd / he wolde
be auenged how so euer it were. And all
his frendes coūseylled hym that he shol¦de
goo vnto Yorke there that the kynge
was hym to defye. And Buerne tooke
his mayne & came to the kynge. Whan
the kynge hym sawe / he called hym cur∣tously
Buerne by name. And Buerne
hym answered & to hȳ sayd. Syt I you
defye / and yelde vp feautees homages &
londes / & as moche as I haue holden of
you / and fro this tyme forwarde I wyll
neuer of the no thynge holde. And so he
departed fro the kynge without more
speche or ony abydynge / and toke leue of
his frendes & wente in to Denmarke / and
playned to the kynge Godern / and
tolde hym of the despyte of y
t
 the kynge
Osbryght to hym had done of his wyf.
and prayed hym of socour & helpe hym
for to auenge ¶Whan kyng Godern of
Denmark and the danys had herde the
complaynt of this Buerne / & the prayer
that he badde / they were ryght wonder
gladde in theyr hertes / for as moche as
they myght fynde a cause for to go in to
Englonde for to warre vpon Englesshe¦men
/ and for to auenge Buerne of the
despyte that the kynge Osbryght hadde
done vnto his wyf. And for as moche as
Buerne was sybbe vnto the kynge of
Denmark / anone they lete ordeyne a
grete hoste of men & lete ordeyne theym
shyppes / and as moche as theym neded
for to haue to that vyage. And whan all
the hoste was redy / the kynge made his
two brethern chyef capytayns / that we∣re
noble knyghtes of body and also bol¦de.
That one was called Hunga / & that
other Hubba.






¶How the Danys toke Yorke / and sle∣we
the kynge Osbryght / and soone af∣ter
slewe kynge Elle.


AS all was redy the two bredern
toke leue of the kynge Gode
n.
& wente towarde the see for to passe ouer
in to Englonde as faste as they myght
spede. Now is Buerne so wel comforted
& fast hyed hȳ w
t
 the Danys y
t
 they ben
arryued in the North coūtree / & comen
thrugh out Holdernes / & destroyed all y
•

coūtree / & brenned townes / & robbed fol∣ke
/ & slewe all that they myght take tyll
that they came vnto Yorke. And whan
kynge Osbryght sawe them come / he to¦ke
all his people that he had with hym
and came out of the cyte & faught with
them / but noo foyson he ne had ayenst
them / & moche of the people that there
was were slayne on bothe partyes. And
kyng Osbryght hymself there was slay¦ne
/ & the cyte anone was take & the Da¦nys
went in. ¶And there was also an o∣ther
kynge in Northumberlonde / that
Buernes frendes had chose & helde hym
for kynge / a man that was called Elle / 
for as moche as they wolde not to kyng
Osbryght he attendaūt / for the despyte
that he had done vnto Buerne theyr to
syn. ¶It befell thus that the kyng Elle
was gone in to the wood hym for to dyf∣porte
/ & of venyson some he had taken.
And as he sate in the wood at meete / to
a knyght he sayd. We haue well spedde
& moche venyson taken. ¶And w
t
 that
worde came in a man & to hym sayd / yf
ye so moche of venyson haue wonne / an
hondred tymes somoche more ther ayen¦ste
haue ye lost. For all this coūtree the
Danys haue goten / & taken the cyte of
Yorke / & ayenst you shall it holde / that
neuer ye shall come therin / & for so mo¦che
they haue slayne kynge Osbryght / ¶
Whan kynge Elle herde these wor∣des
/ he lete assemble all the folke of the
coūtree / & ordeyned all the power that
he myght haue. And wolde haue goten
the towne of Yorke with strength. But
the Danys came out anone & yaue hym
a stronge batayll. And slewe the kynge


Elle and the moost parte of the people
that he had brought with hym. ¶And
the same place there they were slayne / shall
euer more be called Elle crofte / &
that place is a lytell from Yorke. ¶And
tho rested the Danys neuer tyll y
•
 they
hadde conquered all Northumberlonde.
And in that coūtree they made Wardey¦nes
/ and wente further in to the londe / and
toke Notyngham. And there they
abode all the wynter & dyde all the soro¦we
that they myght. ¶And after whan
Somer tyme came they remeued from
Notyngham and came in to Nicholl &
Lyndesey / and to Holonde. For no man
myght them withstande / soo moche po∣wer
& strength they had.






¶How saynt Edmonde the kynge was
martyred.


ANd soo ferre hadde the Danys
passed from countree to coūtree.
and euer more brennynge and robbyn∣ge
and destroyenge all that they myght
tyll they came vnto Tethforde. ¶And
in that countree they founde a Crysten
kynge / that moche loued god and his
werkes that was called Edmonde. And
he was a kyng of Northfolke & South
folke. ¶This saynt Edmonde kyng or
deyned as moche folke as he myght / &
fought with the Danys / but he and his
folke were dyscomfyted / and the kynge
hymself dryuen vnto the castell of Fra∣melynham.
And the Danys hym purse
wed / and came vnto the same castell / And
whan kynge Edmonde sawe that
the castell myght not them withstande / he
came ayenst theym / with whome the
Danys fyrst dyd speke. And anone they
axed of hȳ where kynge Edmonde was
¶Now forsoth sayd he whan I was in
the castell / there was the kynge / & whan
I wente out of the castell he wente out
also / & whether he shall escape or depe / at
goddes wyll muste it all be. ¶Whan
saynt Edmonde hadde named god / by
that worde wyste they well all y
t
 it was
hymself. And anone Hubba & hungar
toke hym & sayd / that he sholde god for∣sake
& all crysten lawes / as many other
had done hym before. ¶And saynt Ed∣monde
sayd that he wolde neuer but ra¦ther
he wolde suffre deth for goddes lo∣ue
& his lawes to. ¶Tho toke they kyn¦ge
Edmonge & bonde hym vnto a tree / &
made theyr archers to shote at hym w
t
 
arowes / tyll that his body stycked as ful
of arowes as an orchen is full of pre
 / kes.
But for all the payne that they hȳ¦dyde
he wolde neuer god forsake. And
in the same payne & torment he deyed / &
betoke his soule vnto almyghty god / ¶
And whan they sawe that he was de¦de
/ they smote of his heed. And of this
maner as ye haue herde was saynt Ed¦monde
martred.






¶How Hubba & Hungar toke the tow∣ne
of Redynge.


SO whan Saynt Edmonde was
martyred. Hungar & Hubba yede
thens with all the Danys vnto Redyng
And as they wente thytherwarde they
brente townes & cytees / & slewe all cry∣sten
peple that wolde not forsake: god / &
cast downe chirches & came to Redynge
& toke the towne & there helde them tyll
that the kynge Edelf of Westsex came
thyther with all his power for to take y

townes. Tho came out the Danys for
to yeue batayll to Edelf / & at that ba∣tayll
was slayne an erle of the Danys
that was called Sidiak. Vpon the mo∣rowe
came kynge Eldred and his bro∣ther
Alured with a stronge power and a
grete hoste. And the kynge Edelf came
agayne that had foughten the daye be∣fore
to that bataylle. And the Danyo
tho came out for to fyght with theym / And
the bataylle was wonder stronge / for
many a man was there slayne / and


the Danys that daye had the vyctorye / And
the kynge Eldred & his broder Alu¦trd

a kynge of Denmarke y
t
 was called Ra¦fin

daye after the Danys & the Englysshe
men fought an other tyme at Rafynge
& there were the Englysshmen dyscom∣fyted
/ & from thens a dane that was cal¦led
Roynt wente to redynge w

¶Nota Machomitum.


¶Machomite the duke of Sarrasyns
& Turkes was this tyme. And he was y
•

dysceyuer of all the worlde / a false pro∣phete
/ the messenger of the deuyll. The
forgooer of Antecryst / the fulfyller of he¦rerye
/ & of all fals men the meruayllest.
Of whon the dominacion thus began / ¶
There was a certayne famous clerke
at Rome / & coude not spede in his ma∣ters
that he desyred to haue spedde in.
Thenne he receded from Rome ouer y
•

see / & procured many a man to haue go∣ne
with hym. Amonge whome was this
Machomyte a grete man of wytte. And
this clerke promysed hym to make hym
duke of the countree yf he wolde be gy∣ded
after hym. ¶There he nourysshed
a douue / & put all the corne y
•
 the douue
ete in Machomyt{is} eere / & so this douue
had neuer no mette but in his eere. The
forsayd clerke on a daye called the peo∣ple
& meued them to chese suche a pryn∣ce
as y
•
 holy ghost wolde shewe to them
in lykenesse of douue. And anone this
clerke secretly lete flee this douue / y
•
 whi¦che
after his olde custome that he was
wonte to / fell anone to y
•
 sholder of Ma¦chomyte
& put his bylle in his eere. And
the people sawe this / anone he was cho∣sen
duke of that people of Corosame / he
sayd that he was the very prophete of
god. Thenne he made a boke of his la∣we
that was called Alkaron. But he dy¦de
it by Informacōn of thre of his may∣sters.
To whome the deuyll mynystred
the auctoryte and the connynge. ¶The
fyrst mayster was a Iewe a grete Astro∣nomyer
& a Nygromancer. The secon∣de
was Iohn̄ de Anthiochia. The thyr∣de
was Sergius an heretyke. And these
thre made an vngracyous lawe and an
vnhappy. ¶And what some euer was
harde of byleue and noyous to do / they
lefte that out of the lawe / and they put
that thynge in the lawe / the whiche the
worldly men were prone and redy to do.
That is to saye. Glotony / lechery / rapy¦ne
/ & suche other. And also this Macho¦myte
ordeyned that a man sholde haue
as many wyues as he myght occupye &
fynde / and refuse them twyes or thryes / or
foure tymes / and take them agayne / And
many meruayllous & fals thynges
he made in his lawe / the whiche were to
longe to reherce here. But they be play∣ne
in his boke of Alkaron. And euer he
wrote in his boke / that our lorde spake
to Machomyte his prophete / sayenge on
this wyse / or on this. ¶Thus by his fal¦se
meanes he dysceyued the people. And
whan his maysters & he had made this
that was so delectable. He wrote it in a
bo
 with letters of golde. And also he
nourysshed a myghty camell secretly in
a pryue place / and aloonly with the ho
¦des
of Machomyte was alwaye fedde / 


And there 
pryuely
 he tyed this boke of
the lawe that he had made about the ca¦mels
necke / and put this camel forth on
a tyme in to the felde afore daye. And
this camell Ioyed in his lybertee / for he
was neuer lose afore. And he wolde suf∣fre
no man to come & touche hym. And
so there was a grete fame of suche a ca∣mell
/ and all the people ranne to see hȳ
Amonge whom was this Machomyte.
But whan the camell sawe hym y
•
 had
fedde hym alwaye. Anone he ranne vn∣to
hym. And he had taught this camell
afore tyme to falle downe on his knees
and lycke his hondes. And so he dyde a∣fore
all that people. The people thenne
cryed and sayd / that there was a very en¦sample
that he was the true prophete of
god. ¶Thenne they prayed Machomy∣te
to open that holy boke with his holy
hondes / the whiche was sente from he∣uen
euermore to be kepte. In the whiche
boke is shewed how the people shal wor¦shyp
god. ¶And Machomyte sayd / this
boke was wryten with aungels honde / So
by these fals meanes / he torned to
his lawe all the londe of Perse / and all
the Erst Imperyall agaynst Heraclium
the Emperour. And he occupyed vnto
the ende of Alexandre and Egypte. Li∣bia.
Arabia and Siria. Thenne after
he enfected all Affrycam. And but the
grace of god withstode hym / he had en∣fected
all Spayne and Fraunce. And
many other thynges he dyde / whiche we¦re
to moche to wryte in this boke.


COnstantyne the thyrde / the sone
of Heraclij was Emperour .xxvij.

& a cursyd man / and an heretyke
Fals / subtyll / and odyous to crysten men
Ne he gaaf no place to pope Mertyne / And
he reysed a grete hoste agaynst the
Lombardes. And there he lost the felde / and
fledde vnto Rome. And honourably
was receyued of the pope Vit
llianus / &
other of the cyte. And he rewarded not
them lyke after theyr merytes as a pryn¦ce
sholde haue done. But vsed forth ty∣rannye
and heresye. Wherfor at the last
he was slayne of his owne knyghtes in
a bath / the whiche wolde no lenger suf∣fre
his tyrannye. And soo he wretchedly
lyued / and deyed vnhappely. ¶Marti∣nus
the fyrst was pope after Theodor

certayne daye at the awter / there purse∣wed
hym to slee hym a man that was
called Spatarius of Olymphe. And
whan he wolde haue smyten hym / he
was blynde sodaynly. This same man
called a Synodi in the cyte of Rome / and
dampned Syrum. Alexandrū Ser∣gium.

Wherfore Constantyne the Emperour
expled hym / and he deyed a saynt. ¶Eu¦geni{us}

euer in labour other in prayer or in syn∣gynge

may Iuge by reason that he was neuer
at Rome / all though some saye he went
to Rome that he myght see that his bo∣kes
accorded with the doctryne of the ho¦ly

was blynde / and wente to preche / & had
a seruaunte that was not good / & made
hym to preche to a myghty multytude

that he wente to Rome thryes / and foū∣de

wolde recouer his Empyre agayne.
Wherfore the people of that coūtree / for

/ and toke on hym the dygnytee of
the pope. And with a grete sclaundre to
the chirche was pope a lytell tyme. But
the faythfull men put hym out / and put
out his eyen. And this was the fyfth In
famed pope / amonge so many herde to∣fore.
So the holy ghost that holy apos∣tles
sete kepte in all honour & holynesse
¶Intynyte martyrs were made this ty¦me
by Constantyne the Emperour / for
he was suche an heretyke. And men tro∣we
that there was neuer Emperour / ne
no pagon that slewe so many martyrs.
And in his tyme the chirche was trow∣bled
full sore / & very precyously bought
the worshyppynge of the ymages of the
holy sayntes / for the grete shedynge of
blood of martyrs. And certaynly that
cursyd Emperour was not vnpunys∣shed.
For whan that he deyed / he cryed
with an horryble voys and sayd. I am
taken to a fyre / that is vnable for to be
destroyed. And so he yelded vp the ghost
to euerlastynge payne. ¶The Empyre
of Rome was dyuyded about this tyme
For Stephanus the pope translated
Ytaly and other vnto Karolus a yonge
man. And Constantyne helde the londe
of Grece with other londes ouer the see
with a grete labour and many rebellyn∣ge.
¶This tyme Karolus magnus was
a noble yonge man. And he began for
to regne vpon Fraunce / and was the so∣ne
of Pippinus / and his moder was cal¦led
Berta. ¶Stephanus the thyrde
was pope after Paulus thre yere. And
he amended all the errours of Constan∣tyne.
And he degraded all those the whi¦che
Constantyne ordeyned in a generall
Synodus.

man / and he toke awaye a cer∣tayne
crowne of a chirche and put it vp
on his heed. And anone he was corrup∣ted
with an axes and sore dyseased. And
he had a cursed wyf / the whiche regned

with a fayned rancour put out his eyest

she was aboute for to haue be wedded.
And whan the Grekes perceyued that

kynge of Fraunce. ¶Nychoferus
was Emperour after Constantyne. He
was a very nygon / and was exalted to
his Empyre by the Grekes. But he pro¦fyted
not / for in his tyme all the

the Romayns put them vnder Karolus
magnus. ¶Ierusalem about this ty∣me
was recouered by Karolus / with all

were defectyne vnto the Romayns
And the Grekes stroue euer more with

wordes than with strengthe / and more
with crafte than with batayll. For they
hadde so grete enuye at the Romayns / that
they wolde not obeye the chirche of
Rome. For certaynly whan that the po∣pes
wolde wryte vnto them / for to obeye
the chirche of Rome / they wrote agayne

¶Sergius the seconde was pope af∣ter
Gregorius two yere. This man was
called fyrst (os porci) in Englysshe / hog

¶Of kynge Alured / & how the Danys
in his tyme prayed hym of mercy that
they myght go out of the londe.






AFter the deth of this Eldred reg
ned his broder Alured that Dol¦fines
was called. ¶Tho wente the Da¦nys
& assembled them / & wente forth to
seke Alured that tho was kynge newe
made of Southsex / & there they founde
hym att Wylton with a lytell people / And
neuerthelesse he faught with them / but
at the last he fledde thens from the
felde / & wente in to Westser & ordeyned
so moche people of his owne reame / &
also of other tyll y
•
 he had a stronge hoste
so that the Danys had no power ayenst
hym to withstande. And he came to Lon¦don
with his hoste / & there were the Da¦nys
soiourned. And there he wolde haue
foughten with them. But the Danys
durste not with hym fyght / but prayed
hym of peas / & y
•
 they myght go ayen
in to theyr owne coūtree / & neuer to co∣me
in to Englonde ayen / that is to saye
ony harme for to do. And vpon this co∣uenaūt
they sholde gyue hym to pledge
good hostages / & suche as the Englyssh
men wolde axe.






¶How Hubba & Hungar were slayne
at Chyppenham / and how the Danys
brought theyr kynge to our kynge.



ANd the same daye that the Da∣nys
departed from London / soo
fast they rode both nyght & daye / & ne∣uer
toke rest of goynge tyll y
t
 they came
vnto Excestre / & toke tho the towne / &
there helde them. ¶Whan kyng Alured
herde these tydynges / anone he lete take
the hostages / & wente from thens vnto
Excestre w
t
 all the power that he had / And
whan the Danys herde telle of his
comynge / they wente from thens vnto
Westsex / & came vnto Chyppenham / &
there they dyde moche harme in the coū¦tree
/ they robbed folke / & brought theym
in pryson. The kynge Alured them pur¦sewed
/ & came vpon them ryght soone &
fyersely theym assayled. And there were
slayne both Hubba & Hungar his brod{er} / and
Buerne Bocarde. And in this ba∣tayll
were moche folke slayne in that o∣ne
parte & in that other. But the gree
of that felde bode with the Danys / for
as moche as the kynge came with fewe
folke. ¶The kynge hasted hym as mo∣che
as he myght for to go agayne. And
whan the Danys foūde Hubbacs body
lyeng deed they buryed it / & layd vpon it
a grete logge / & lete calle it Hubeslowe / and
soo it is called vnto this daye. And
that place is in Deuenshyre. The Ba∣rons
of Somerset. Wyltshyre and Dor
set herde tell how that theyr kynge was
dyscomfyted / & ordeyned all the power
that they myght haue / and came to the
kynge there he was / and thanked god
that they hym yet founde alyue / for they
had wende that the Danys hadde hym
slayne. Tho tooke they a counseyll the
kynge & his barons / that wolde go and
seke the Danys with them for to fyght.
And so they rode all that nyght theym
for to seke / & came on the morowe about
Pryme to Abyndon there y
•
 the Danys
were. The kynge Alured & his barons
tho assembled & there assaylled the Da∣nys
egrely / & there yaue them a stronge
batayll. And the Danys put them a lon¦ge
tyme that no man wyst whether par¦te
more people were slayne. But thus it
befell as god wolde that the kynge Alu¦red
had the vyctory with moche honour
For the Danys were so dryuen that they
ne wyst whyther for to torne. And .xv.
dayes the kynge them pursewed at his
wyll / that gladly & fayne they were for
to speke of peas and accorde / and tooke
hym good hostage / & sayd they wolde
neuer more vpon hym warre ne no deba¦te
arere. ¶And more ouer they behyght
vnto the kynge Alured / that they wolde
go & brynge theyr owne kynge vnto hȳ
and that theyr kynge & they all sholde
be baptysed. And vpon this condycyon
kynge Alured graūte them lyf & lymme
And sayd vnto theym / that they sholde
gone theyr kynge for to seke / & at a cer∣tayne
daye to come ayen that to theym
was sette. And so they wente forth faste
& came ayen at a daye that to them was
assygned. And all the Danys brought
theyr kynge with them. ¶The kynge
Alured anone lete them be baptysed / &
theyr names chaunged. And so the kyn∣ge
of Denmark was called Athelstone
And .xxx. of his felowes names were
chaunged also / and the other were bap∣tysed
to the ryght byleue. ¶And all this
was done at Westmestre. And after that
kynge Alured helde with hym kyng A∣thelstone
and all his Danys .xij. dayes
at soiourne with moche solempnyte / &
yaue them grete yeftes. And after that
they were baptysed & so departed. Tho
was kynge Alured all at ease / whan he
had his enmyes ouercomen / & that they
were torned to the ryght byleue of god
almyghty.






¶How the Danys y

ANd thus it befelle afterwarde / that
the Danys of Northum∣berlonde


that were paynems came with
a grete strength & an huge hoste of Fraū¦ce
/ that is to vnderstande / with them y

sholde come to them / & whan those two
host{is} were come & assembled / anone they
yede to destroye all the crysten people of
Englonde from place to place / & dyde
moche sorowe. ¶It befelle thus as al∣myghty
god wolde an harde chaūce in

y
t
 was wonte to abate the Danys deyed
in the meane tyme. This kyng Alured

& of good lernynge / thorugh whiche
bokes many a man may hym amende / that

aboue all the kynges of Scotlonde &

Edwardes fader. And whan Edgars

moder & enteryd / he herde speke of
the fayrnesse of Estrylde / that was Ox∣garus
doughter a baron of Deuenshyre
that was so fayr a woman / that al men
dyde speke of her. He called one of his
knyghtes that he moche loued & trusted
vpon & tolde hym. God sayd he to the
noble baron Orgarus of Deuenshyre / and
see yf that his doughter be so fayre
as men speke of / & yf it be soth I wyll
haue her vnto my wyf. ¶This knyght
that was called Edelwolde went forth

came there that y

 lady was. And whan
he sawe her so fayre / he thought to haue
her hymself to wyf. And therof spake to
Orgarus her fader. And her fader was
an olde man & had no moo childern but
oonly her / & sawe that Edelwolde was
a fayre yonge knyght & worthy & ryche
and was well beloued with the kynge / &
thought his doughter sholde well be
maryed & besette vpon hym / and graū∣ted
hym his doughter yf the good lorde
the kynge wolde consente therto. ¶And
thenne this Edelwolde came ayen vnto
the kynge & tolde hym / that she was fay
re ynough vpon to see / but she was won
der lothly. ¶Tho answered the kynge
and sayd that he toke but lytell charge.
Syr sayd Edelwolde / she is her faders
heyre / & I am not ryche of londes / and
yf ye wolde consente & graunte that I
myght her haue / thenne sholde I be ry∣che

man & an amerous.






¶How that kynge Edgar wedded Es∣trylde
after the deth of Edelwolde.


THus it befell that all men in kyn¦ge
Edgars courte thenne spake
and sayd / that Edelwolde was rychely
auaunced / thorugh the forsayd marya∣ge
of his wyf. And yet they sayd / he was
auaunced an hondred folde more. For
he had spowsed the moost fayrest creatu¦re
that euer was seen. And the kyng her
de speke so moche of her beaute / that he
thought he wolde haue hym dysceyued / &
begyled. And thought pryuely in his
herte / that he wolde go in to Deuenshy
re / as it were for to hunte for the harte &
for the hynde & other wylde beestes / and
thenne he sholde see there the lady or he
departed thens. And this lady was dwel¦lynge
at a manere place besydest the fo∣rest

at that manere he was herborowed
all nyght. And whan tyme came that
the kynge sholde suppe / & the sonne sho∣ne

after his godsone. And Edelwolde ma∣de
her to come before the kynge. And ne
uerthelesse yf it other wyse myght haue
be she sholde not haue come in his syght
by his wyll. ¶The lady welcomed the
kynge and swetely hym kyssed. And he
tooke 
 by the honde / and tho nexte by
hym her sate / and so souped they togy∣der.
¶And there was a custome and an
vsage in this londe that tyme. That so
whan one dranke to an other / the dryn∣ket
sholde saye Wassayll. And that o∣ther
sholde answere / and saye Drynke
hayll. And this dyde the kynge and the
lady / and also kyste many tymes. And
after supper whan tyme was for to god
to bedde / the kynge wente to bedde / thyn
kynge hertely on the fayrnesse of that la¦dy
/ and thenne was ouercome for her lo¦ue
/ that hym thought that he sholde
deye / but yf he hadde his wyll on her
/ ¶Vppon the morowe the kynge aroos
/ and in the forest wente hym for to dys∣porte
with hartes and hyndes and all
other wylde beestes. And of the hartes
grete plente he sente to that lady. And
thryes he wente for to solace and to spe∣ke
with that lady the whyles he dwelled
there in that countree. ¶And after that
the kynge remeued thens / and thought
hym how he myght best delyuer Edel∣wolde
fro his wyf as he had hym fyrst
desceyued. And the kynge anone after
viij. dayes ordeyned a parlyamēt at Sa

of Northumberlonde sholde best be
kepte that the Danys came not there

came vnto the kyng{is} parlyament
And the kynge sente hym vnto Yorke / for
to be keper of that countree. ¶And
thus it befell / that men that knewe hym
not slewe hym by the waye. ¶And ano∣ne
as the kynge herde tell that he was
deed / he lete sende after the lady Estryl∣de
that she sholde come vnto the cyte of
London / and there be wedded to the kyn¦ge
with grete solempnyte and worshyp.
And helde a solempne feest. And he wa∣re

quene an other. ¶And saynt Dunstane
on the morowe came vnto the kynge in

Dunstane axed the kynge who she was
And the kynge answered & sayd / that

¶It befell thus vppon a daye that the

¶Of Kynge Knoght that was a Dane


ANd after the dethe of Eldred
Knoght that was a Dane began
to regne. But Edmonde Irensyde that
was kynge Eldredes sone by his fyrste
wyf / ordeyned a grete power of men / &
began for to warre on kynge Knoght / And
soo he dyde many tymes & often / And
the warre was so stronge & harde / that
wonder it was to wyte. ¶And the
quene Emme that dwelled tho at West∣mestre
/ had grete drede of her two sones
of the warre Alured and Edwarde / lest
they sholde be defoyled & mysdone tho∣rugh
this warre. Wherfore she sente
theym ouer the see in to Normandy to
the duke Richarde theyr vncle. And the∣re
they dwelled in saufte & peas longe
tyme. ¶This Edmonde Irensyde and
Knoght the Dane warred strongely to∣gyde
.
But at the laste they were accor∣ded
in this manere / that they sholde de∣parte
the reame betwixt them both / and
so they dyde / & after they became good
frendes. And soo well loued togyder as
they had ben brethern goten of one fa∣der
& of one moder borne.






¶How kyng Edmonde Irensyde tray∣toursly
was slayne thorugh a traytour / that
was called Edrith of Stratton.


ANd after tho regned kyng Iren¦syde
& Knoght the Dane. But thus it
befell afterwarde / that in the same yere
that they were accorded & so moche lo∣ued
togyder. Wherfore a fals traytoure
had enuytee to the loue that was betwix
them and frendshyp / whoos name was
Edrith of Stratton / that was a grete
lorde / that was Edmondes Irensydes
man / & of hym helde all the londe that
he had. And neuertheles he thought his
lorde to betraye & make Knoght kynge
of the londe / to the entente rychely to be
auaunced / & with hym be well beloued / Wherfore
he prayed his lorde Edmond
Irensyde vppon a daye with hym for to
et
. And the kynge hym curteysly graū∣ted
& to hym came at his prayer. And at
the meete the kynge ryally was serued
with dyuers meet{is} & drynkes. And whan
the nyght came that he sholde goo vnto
bedde. The kynge toke his owne meyne
& wente vnto the chambre there that he
sholde take his nyghtes reste. And as he
loked hym about / he sawe a fayre yma∣ge
& well made / and in semblaunt as it
were an Archer with a boowe / & in the
boowe a fyne arowe. ¶Kynge Edmon¦de
wente tho nere for to beholde it better
what it myght be. And anone y
•
 arowe
smote hym thrugh the body & there sle∣we
the kynge. For that engyne was ma∣de
for to slee his owne lorde traytoursly
¶And so whan kynge Edmonde was
thus deed & slayne / he had regned but .x.
yere. And his people for hym made mo∣che
sorowe. And his body they bare vnto
Glastenbury & there they hym entyred.
¶And this fals traytour Edrith anone
wente vnto the quene / that was kynge
Edmondes wyfe / that wyst not of her
lordes deth. Anone he toke from her two
sones that were fayre & yonge / that her
lorde had vpon her goten / that one was
called Edwarde / & that other Edwyne.
& ladde theym with hym to London / &
toke them vnto kynge Knoght / that he
sholde do wish them what his wyll we∣re.


And tolde hym how subtylly he 
had

slayne kynge Edmonde / for by cause &
loue of hym / so that kynge knoght all
Englonde in his power hooly myght
haue. ¶O thou fals traytour / hast thou
my true brother that was soo true thus
slayne for me / the man I moost loued
in the worlde. Now by my heed I shall
for thy trauell the well rewarde as thou
hast deserued / & anone lete hym be take
& bounde honde & foot in manere of a
traytour / & lete cast hym there in to Ta¦myse
/ & in this maner the fals traytour
ended his lyf. The kynge toke the two
childern & put them vnto the abbot of
Westmestre to warde & to kepe tyll y
t
 he
wyst what was best with them to do.






¶How kynge knoght sente kynge Ed∣mondes
sones both in to Denmarke to
be slayne / & how they were saued.


SO it befell soone after that kyn¦ge
knoght had all y
e
 londe in his
honde / & spowsed the quene Emme tho∣rugh
consente of his baronage. For she
was a fayre woman / the whiche was El¦dredes
wyf and the dukes syster of Nor∣mandy
/ & they lyued togyder with mo∣che
loue as reason wolde. The kynge
axed vpon a daye counseyll of the quene
what was best to do w
t
 the sones y
t
 were
Edmonde Irensydes. Syr sayd she. they
ben the ryght heyres of the londe / & yf
they lyue they wyll do moche sorowe w
t
 
warre / & therfore lete sende them in to
a strange londe a ferre to some man that
may them defoyle & destroy. The kyng
anone lete call a dane y
t
 was called Wal¦gar
/ & cōmaūded hȳ y
t
 he sholde lede tho
two childern in Denmark / & so to do &
ordeyne for them / y
•
 he sholde neuer here
more of theym. Syr sayd this Walgar / gladly
your cōmaūdement shall be done
& anone tho two childern he toke & 
lad

them in to Denmark. And for as moche
as he sawe that the childern were 
wond

fayre & also meke / he had of them grete
pyte & ruche / & wolde them not slee / but

lad
 them to the kyng of Hungry for to
nourysshe / for this Walgar was well be∣knowen
with the kynge & well beloued.
Anone the kyng axed whens the 
childn

were / & Walgar tolde hym & sayd / that
they were the ryght heyres of Englond
& therfore men wolde destroye theym / And
therfore syr vnto you they be come
mercy & helpe for to seke. And forsothe
yf they may lyue / your men they shall
become / and of you they shall holde all
theyr londe. The kynge of Hungry re∣ceyued
them with moche honour / & lete
them worthely be kepte. ¶And thus it
befell afterwarde y
t
 Edwyne the yonger
brother deyed / & Edwarde the elder bro¦ther
lyued / a fayre man & a stronge & a
large of body & gentyll / and curters of
condycyons / so that all men hym loued
And this Edwarde in the Cronycles
is called amonge the Englysshmen Ed¦warde
the outlawe. ¶And whan as he
was made knyght / the kynges dough∣ter
of Hungry hym moche loued for his
goodnes and his fayrnes / that she hym
called her derlynge. The kyng that was
her fader perceyued well the loue that
was betwixt them two / and had no hey∣re
but only that doughter / and the kyn∣ge
vowchesauf his doughter to no man
so well / as he dyde to hym that she lo∣ued
so well & he her / and yaue her vnto
hym with a good wyll / & Edwarde her
spowsed with moche honour. The kyn∣ge
of Hungry sente after all his barona∣ge
/ and made a solempne feest & a ryche
weddynge. And made all men to vnder¦stande
/ that this Edwarde sholde be
kynge of that londe after the decesse of
hym. And of that tydyng{is} they were all
full gladde. This Edwarde begate vp∣pon
his lady a sone that was called Ed¦gar
Helynge / & afterwarde a doughter
that was called Margarete y
t
 afterwar∣de
was quene of Scotlonde. And by the


kyng of Scotlond that was called Man¦colin
she had a doughter that was called
Maud y
t
 was quene afterwarde of Eng∣lond
/ thrugh kynge Henry that was the
fyrst sone of y
e
 conquerour that her wed¦ded.
And he begate on her a doughter y
t

was called Maude that afterwarde was
Empresse of Almayn. And of this Mau¦de
came y
e
 kynge of Englonde that vn∣to
this daye is called Henry y
•
 Empresse
sone. And yet had this Edwarde an o∣ther
doughter by his wyf that was cal∣led
Crystyan & she was a Nonne.






¶How kynge Knoght that was a prou¦de
man conquered No
andy / & how he
became afterwarde meke & mylde.


NOw haue ye herde of Edmonde
Irensydes sones y
t
 kyng Knoght
wend they had ben slayne as he had cō∣maūded
Walgar before. And this kyng
Knoght had in his honde all the reame
of Englonde & Denmarke. And after
that they wente vnto Norwaye that lon¦do
for to conquere. But the kynge of the
londe that was called Elaf came w
t
 his
people / & wende his londe to haue well
kepte & defended / & so there he faught
with hym / tyll at the last he was slayne
in that batayll. And tho this Knoght to¦ke
all the londe in to his honde. And
whan he had conquered Norwaye / & ta∣ken
feaute & homages there / he came a∣yen
in to Englonde / & helde hymself so
grete a lorde / that hym thoughte in all
the worlde his pere noo man was. And
he came so proude and hauteyne that it
was grete wonder. ¶And so it befell vp¦on
a daye as he had herde masse at West¦mestre
/ & wolde haue gone in to his pa∣lays
/ the wawes of the Tamyse so swyf¦tely
ayenst hym came that almoost they
touched his feet. Tho sayd the kyng w
t

a proude herte. I cōmaunde the water
to torne ayen / or elles I shall make the / The
wawes for his cōmaūdement wol∣de
not spare / but flowed euer in heyght
more & more. The kyng was so proude
of hert that he wolde not flee the water
& bete it with a rodde that he had in his
honde / & cōmaunded the water that it
sholde go no ferder. But for all his cō∣maūdement
the water wolde not cesse / but
euer wexed more & more on hygh / so
that the kynge was all wete & stode de∣pe
in the water. And whan he sawe that
he had abyden there to longe / & the wa∣ter
wolde noo thynge do his cōmaunde∣ment
/ tho soone he withdrewe hym / and
tho stode he vpon a stone and helde his
hondes on hyghe & sayd these wordes he¦rynge
all the people. ¶This god that
maketh the see thus aryse / is kynge of
all kyng{is} / & of all myghtes moost. And
I am a caytyf & a man deedly / and he
may neuer deye / & all thynge doth his cō¦maundement

To that god I praye / that he be my
warraunt. For I knowlege me a caytyf
feble / and of no power. And therfore I
wyll go vnto Rome without ony longe
lettynge / and my wyckednesse for to pu∣nysshe
and me to amende. For of god I
clayme my londe for to holde / & of none
other. And anone made redy his heyre / and
hymself wente to Rome without o∣ny
lettynge. And by the waye dyde ma∣ny
almesse dedes / and whan he came to
Rome also. And whan he had be there / for
his synnes do penaūce / he came ayen
in to Englonde / & became a good man
and an holy. And lyued and left all ma¦nere
of pryde and stoutenes / and lyued
an holy lyf after / & made two abbayes
of saynt Benet / one in Englonde and
an other in Normandye / for as moche
as he loued saynt Benet more specyally
than other sayntes. And moche he loued
also saynt Edmonde y

 kynge. And oft
he yaue grete yeftes to the house / wher∣fore
it was made ryche. And whan he
had regned .xx. yere he deyed / and lyeth
at Wynchestre.








¶Anno dm̄ .M.xviij.


BEnedictus the .ix. was pope after
Iohannes / & he was a grete le∣

therfore he was dampned / and
he aperyd to a certayne man 
vnd
 a mer¦uaylous
fygure & an horryble. His heed
& his take was lylae an asse / that other
part of his body lyke a beer. And he say∣de
to this man to whom he aperyd. Be
not aferde / for I was a man as ye now
be / but I apeyre now / for I lyued vnhap¦pely
in olde tyme lyke a beest whan I
was pope. In this mannes tyme there
was grete dyuysyon & sclaunder to the
chirche / for he was put out & in two ty∣mes.
¶And here Tholome

his sone was made Empe∣rour
by the cōmaūdement of god ayenst

they were accorded. And he toke Coro∣dis
doughter to his wyf.






¶Of kynge Harold that leuer had go
on foot than ryde on hors.


THis Knoght of whome we haue
spoken of before / had two sones
by his wyf Emme / & y
t
 one was called
Hardiknoght / & that other Harold. And
he was so lyght of foot y
•
 men called hȳ
moost comynly Harold Hare foot. And
this Harold had no thynge the condicy∣ons
& the maners of kyng Knoght that
was his fader. For he sette but lytell pry¦ce
of chyualrye / ne noo curteysy / nother
worshyp / but oonly by his owne wyll / And
he became so wycked that he exyled
his moder Emme. And she wente out of
the londe in to Flaūdres / & there dwelled
 w
t
 the erle / wherfore after there was ne∣uer
good loue betwixt hym & his broder
For his broder hated hȳ deedly / & whan
he had regned two yere & a lytell more / he
deyed & lyeth at Westmestre.






¶Of kynge Hardiknoght that was Ha¦roldes
brother.


AFter this Harold Harefoot reg∣ned
his brother Hardiknoght
 a
noble knyght & a worthy man & moche
loued chyualry / & all maner of goodnes
And whan this Hardiknoght had red∣ned
a lytell whyle / he lete vncouere his
brother Harold & smote of his heed that
was his broder at Westmestre
 & lete cast
the heed in to a gonge / & the body in to
Tamyse. And after came fysshers & to¦ke
the body with theyr nettes by nyght
/ & bare hym to saynt Clementes ch
che
& there hym buryed. And in this maner
auenged hym Hardiknoght of his brod{er}
for in none other maner he myght be a∣uenged.
This kynge Hardiknoght was
so large a yeuer of meete & drynke / that
his tables were sette euery daye thre ty∣mes
full with ryall meetes & drynkes for
his owne meyne / and for all that came
vnto his courte / to be rychely serued of
ryall meetts. ¶And this kynge Hardi∣knoght
sente after Emme his moder / &
made her to come ayen in to Englon∣de
/ for she was dryuen out of Englonde
whyle that Harold Harefoot regned / 
thrugh counseyll of the erle Godewin / that
tho was the grettest lorde of Eng∣londe
next the kynge / & moost myght do
thrugh out all Englonde what he wolde
his cōmaundement / for as moche as he
had spowsed the doughter of the good
kynge Knoght / that was a Dane
 whi∣che
doughter he hadde by his fyrst wyf / ¶
And whanne this quene was dryuen


out of Englonde / & come to the Erle of
Flaūdres / that was called Baldewyne
her cosyn / he foūde her there all thynge
that her neded / vnto the tyme y
t
 she wen¦te
ayen in to Englonde / that the kynge
Hardiknoght had sent for her that was
her some & made her come ayen with mo¦che
honour. This kynge Hardiknoght
whan he had regned fyue yere he deyed
and lyeth at Westmestre.






¶Of the vylany that the Danys dyde
to the Englysshmen. Wherfore fro that
tyme after was no Dane made kynge
of this londe.


ANd after the deth of this kynge
Hardsknoght / for as moche as
he had noo thynge of his body begoten / The
erles & barons assembled / & made
a coūsell / that neuer more after no man
y
t
 was a Dane / though he were neuer so
grete a man amonges them / he sholde
neuer be kynge of Englonde for the des∣pyte
y
t
 the Danes had done to Englyssh¦men.
For euermore before & yf it were so
that the Englysshmen & y
•
 Danys hap∣ned
for to mete vpon a brydge / the En∣glysshmen
sholde not be so hardy to me∣
e
ne styre a foot / but stande styll tyll y
e

Dane were passed forth. And more ouer
yf y
t
 Englysshmen had not bowed dow¦ne
theyr heedes to do reuerence vnto the
Danys / they sholde haue ben beten & de¦foylled.
And suche maner despytes & vy¦lany
dyde the Danys to our Englysshe¦men.
Wherfore they were dryuen out of
y
•
 londe after tyme y
•
 kyng Hardiknoght
was deed / for they had no lorde y
t
 theym
myght mayntene. ¶And in this maner
auoyded the Danys Englonde / y
t
 neuer
they came ayen. ¶The erles & barons
by theyr comyn assente & by theyr coūse∣les
sent vnto Normandy for to seke tho∣se
two brethern. Alured & Edwarde that
were dwellynge with the duke Richarde
that was theyr came / in entente for to
crowne Alured the elder brother / & hym
make kynge of Englonde. And of this
thynge to make an ende / the erles & 
a∣rons
made theyr othe. But y
•
 erle Gode¦win
of Westsex falsely & traytoursely
thought to slee these two brethern anone
as they sholde come in to Englonde / in
entent / to make his sone Harold kynge
the whiche sone he had begote vpon his
wyfe / the whiche was kynge Knoghtes
doughter that was a Dane. And so this
Godewin pryuely hȳ went vnto South
hampton for to mete there the two bre∣thern
whan y
t
 they sholde come vnto lon¦de.
¶And thus it befell the messengers
that wente in to Normandy / foūde not
but oonly Alured y
t
 was the elder brother
For Edwarde his brother was gone in
to Hungary for to speke with his cosyn
Edwarde the outlawe / y
t
 was Edmon∣des
sone with the Irensyde. The messen¦gers
tolde & sayd Alured / how that the
erles & barons of Englonde sente after
hym / & that he boldely sholde come in to
Englonde & receyue the reame. For kyn¦ge
Hardiknoght was deed / & all the Da¦nes
dryuen out of the londe.






¶How Godewin the fals traytour to∣ke
Alured vppon Gyldesdowne whan
that he came from Normandy to be kyn¦ge
of Englonde / & how he caused hym
to be martyred in the yle of Ely.


AS Alured herde these tydynges
he thanked god. And in to shyp∣pe
went with all the hast that he myght
and passed the see / & arryued at South∣hampton
there Godewin the fals tray∣tour
was. And whan this traytour sawe
that he was come / he welcomed hym &
receyued hym with moche Ioye & sayd / that
he wolde lede hym to London there
that all the barons of Englonde hym a∣bode
to make hym kynge. And so they
wente on theyr waye towarde London / And
whan they came on Gyldesdowne


tho sayd the traytour Godwin vnto Alu¦red.
Take kepe about you bothe on the
lyfte syde & ryght syde / & of all ye shall
be kynge / & of suche an hondred more / Now
forsothe sayd Alured. I behyght
you & yf I be kynge. I shall ordeyne &
make suche lawes / wherfore god & man
shall be well pleased. Now had the tray∣tour
cōmaunded all his men that were
 w
t
 hym. that whan they were come vpon
Gildesdowne / that they sholde slee all y
t

were in Aluredes company / that came
with hym fro Normandy / & after that
take Alured & lede hym in to the yle of
Ely / & after put out bothe his eyen of
his heed / & afterwarde brynge hym to
deth / & so they dyde. For they slewe all y
e

company that there were / the nombre of
.xij. gentylmen that were come w
t
 hym
fro Normandy / & after toke they Alured
& in the yle of Ely they put out his eyen
& rent his wombe & toke the chyef of his
bowels / & put a stake in the grounde / &
an ende of the bowels therto fastened / &
with nedyls eylesse of yren they pryched
the good childe / and so made hym to go
about the stake tyll that all his bowels
were drawen out of his body / & so deyed
Alured there thorugh treason of the erle
Godewin. ¶Whan the lordes of Eng∣londe
had herde & wyst how Alured that
sholde haue be theyr kynge was put to
deth thrugh the fals traytour Godewin
they were wonder wroth. And swore by∣twene
god & them / that he sholde deye a
more wors dethe / than dyde Edrith of
Stratton / that 
had
 betrayed his lorde
Edmonde Irensyde / & they wolde haue
put hȳ to deth / but y
e
 theyf traytour 
fled

thens in to Denmark / & there helde hȳ
foure yere & more / & lost all his londe in
Englonde.


SIluester the thyrde was pope af∣ter
Benedictus. This Siluester
was chose / and Benedictus was 
pul∣syd.
And afterwarde was he expulsyd / &
Benedictus was put vp ayen. And after
he was put out / and Gregorius was ma¦de
pope. And he was but a symple let∣tred
man / & therfore he chose an other
man for to be consecrate with hym. And
whan many men were dyspleased with
this gydynge of two popes / the thyrde
was brought in / the whiche sholde occu∣pye
the place of bothe tho two. And soo
they stroue amonge themself. But Hen∣ry
the Emperour came thenne to Rome
& deposyd them all / and made Clement
the seconde pope / whome he made ano∣ne
to crowne hym. And he sayd to the
Romayns / they sholde neuer ch
se pope
without his assent. And so fyue beynge
popes / the sixte was put in. But many
men saye / this Gregorus was an holy
man. ¶Dama
ius the seconde was af∣ter
Clement .xx. dayes. This man was
an vsurper of the popeheed / and soo he
deyed sodenly. And anone the Romayns
asked to haue a pope / & that the Almay¦nes
sholde haue none. For they were soo
harde herted / that they myght not encly¦ne
to the entente of the Emperour / the
whiche sayd. There sholde be no pope
chosen but yf he wolde be of counseyll of
the eleccyon. But for all that they putt
in this holy man Leo & after he bad of
that conscyence / & refused. And anone
he was chosen by the comyn assent this
Leo put Cryste in the fourme of a Las

in his owne bedde / & in the morowe he
founde no thynge there.






¶Of saynt Edwarde the Confessour
that was Aluredes brother how he was
kynge of Englonde.


ANd whan this was done / all the
barons of Englonde sent an o∣ther
tyme in to Normandy / for that Ed¦warde
sholde come in to Englonde 

moche honour. ¶And this Edwarde in
his childehode loued almyghty god and
hym dradde. And in honeste & clennesse


had ladde his lyf / & hated synne as deth
And whan he was crowned & anoynted
with a ryall power / he forgate not his
good maners & condycyons that he fyrst
vsed. And forgate not al good customes
for no manere honour / ne for ryches / ne
no manere hyghnes. But euer more and
more yaue hym to goodnesse / and loued
god and holy chirche passynge all other
manere thynge. And poore men also he
loued / & them helde as they had ben his
owne brethern. And to them oft he yaue
grete almesse with full good wyll.






¶Of the fyrst specyal loue that god she¦wed
to saynt Edwarde lyuynge.


IT befell on a daye / as he wente
from the chirche of Westmynstre.
& had herde masse of saynt Iohan the
Euangelyst / for as moche as he loued
saynt Iohn Euangelyst more specyally
after god & our lady than he dyde ony o∣ther
saynt. And so there came to hym a
pylgryme / & prayed hym for the loue of
god & our lady & saynt Iohn the Euan∣gelyst
some good hym for to yeue. And y
e

kynge pryuely toke his rynge of his fyn¦ger / that
no man perceyued it & yaue it
to the pylgryme / & he it receyued & went
thens. ¶This kynge Edward
 made
alle the good lawes of Englonde / that
yet ben moost vsed & holden. And was
so mercyable and so full of pyte / that no
man myght be more.






¶How the erle Godewin came ayen in
to Englonde & had ayen all his londe / and
afterwarde saynt Edwarde wedded
his doughter.


AS the Erle Godewin that was
dwellynge in Denmarke 
had

moche herde of the goodnesse of kynge
Edwarde / & that he was so full of mer∣cy
& of pyte. He thoughte that he wolde
go ayen in to Englonde / for to seke & to
haue grace of the good kynge Edwar∣de
that so mercyfull was / that he myght
haue ayen his londe in peas. And aray∣ed
hym as moche as he myght & put hȳ
towarde the see & came in to Englonde
to London there that the kyng was that
tyme & all the lordes of Englonde / and
helde a parlyament. Godewin sente to
hym that were his frendes / & were the
moost grettest lordes of the londe / & pray
to them to beseche the kynges grace for
hym / & that he wolde his peas & his lon¦de
graunte hym. The lordes ledde hym
before the kynge to seke his grace. And
anone as the kyng hym sawe / he apeled
hym of treason / & of the deth of Alured
his brother / and these wordes vnto hym
sayd. Traytour Godewin sayd the kyn¦ge
I the appele / that thou hast betrayed
& slayne my brother Alured. Certes syr
sayd Godewin. sauynge your grace and
your peas & your lordshyp. I hym neuer
betrayed / ne yet hym slewe. And therfo∣re
I put me in rewarde of y
e
 courte. Now
fayr lordes sayd the kynge. Ye that ben
my lyeges / erles and barons of the londe
that here be assembled / full well ye her∣de
myn appele / and the answere also of
Godewin / and therfore I woll that ye
awarde & dooth ryght. The erles & ba∣rons
tho gadred them all togyder for to
do this awarde by themself / and so they
spake dyuersely amonge them. For some
sayd / there was neuer alyaūce by homa∣ge
seriment seruyce / ne by lordshypp by∣twene
Godewin and Alured / for which
thynge they myght hym drawe. And a

the laste they deuysed and demed / that
he sholde put hym in the kynges mercy
all togyder. Tho spake the erle Leuerik
of Couentree a good man to god and to
all the worlde / and tolde his reason in
this maner & sayd. The erle Godewin
is the best frended man of Englonde af¦ter
the kynge / & well it myght not be a∣gayne
sayd / that without coūsell of Go¦dewin
Alured was neuer putt to dethe / 


Wherfore I awarde as towchynge my
parte / that hymself & his sone & euery of
vs .xij. erles that ben his frendes go befo¦re
the kynge / charged with as moche gol¦de
& syluer as we may bere betwixt our
hondes / prayenge the kynge to forgeue
his euyll wyll to the erle Godewin / & re¦ceyue
his homage / & his londe yelde a∣yen.
And they accorded vnto that a war∣de
/ and came in this maner as is aboue
sayd / euery of them with golde & syluer
as moche as they myghte bere bytwene
her hondes before the kynge / & there say¦de
the fourme & the maner of theyr acor¦de
& of theyr awarde. The kyng wolde
not theym agaynsaye / but as moche as
they ordeyned / he graūted & confermed.
And so was the erle Godewin accorded
with the kynge / & so he had ayen all his
londe. And afterwarde he bare hym soo
well & soo wysely / that the kynge loued
hym worder moche / & with hym he was
ful preuy. And within a lytell tyme they
loued soo moche / that there the kynge
spowsed Godewins doughter / & made
her quene. And neuerthelesse though the
kynge had a wyfe / yet he lyued euer in
chastyte & clennesse of body without ony
flesshly dede doynge with his wyf. And
the quene also in her halfe ladde an ho∣ly
lyf two yere / & deyed. And afterwar∣de
the kynge lyued all his lyfe withoute
ony wyf. ¶The kyng yaue the erledom
of Oxenforde to Harolde that was Go¦dewins
sone / & made hym erle. And soo
well they were beloued / bothe the fader
& he / and so pryue with the kynge / both
the fader & the sone / that they myght do
by ryght what thynge that they wolde / For
ayenst ryght wolde he no thynge do
for no maner man / so good and true he
was of conscyence. And therfore our lor∣de
Ihesu Cryste grete specyll loue vnto
hym shewed.






¶How kynge Edwarde sawe Swyne
kynge of Denmark drowned in the see
in the tyme of the Sacrament as he sto¦de
& herde masse.


IT befelle vppon Wytsondaye as
kynge Edwarde herde his masse
in the grete chirche of Westmestre ryght
at the leuacyon of Ihesu Crystys body / &
as all men were gadred in to the chir∣che

the sacrynge / the kynge his hondes lyft

gretely ganne wonder. And after masse / they
axed why the kynges laughter was
Fayre lorde sayd kynge Edwarde. I sa∣we
Swyne the yonger that was kynge

hym & all his folke drowned in the see.
and alle this I sawe in the leuacyon of
Crystis body bytwene the preestes bon∣de
/ and I had therfore so grete Ioye that
I myghte not my laughter withholde / 
¶And the erle Leueryk besyde hym sto¦de
at the leuacyon / and openly sawe the
fourme of brede torne in the lyknesse of
a yonge childe / & toke vp his ryght hon∣de
and blessyd the kynge & after the erle

the kynge for to make hym see that holy
syght. And tho sayd the kynge. ¶Sy

¶How the rynge that sayne Edwarde

bod
 gyuen to a poore pylgryme for the
loue of god & sayne Iohan Euangelyst
came ayen to kynge Edwarde.


THis noble man sayne Edwarde
regned .xiij. yere. And thus it be∣fell
vpon a tyme are he deyed / that two
men of Englonde were gone in to holy


londe / & had done theyr pylgrymage / &
were goynge ayen in to theyr owne coū∣tree
where they came fro. And as they
wente in the waye / they mette a pylgry∣me
that curteysly them saluwed / & axed
of them in what londe & in what coūtree
they were borne. And they sayd in Eng¦londe.
Tho axed he who was kynge of
Englonde. And they answered & sayd.
the good kynge Edwarde. ¶Fayre fren¦des
sayd tho the pylgryme / whan that
ye come in to your coūtree ayen. I praye
you that ye wyll go vnto kynge Edwar¦de
/ & oftentymes grete hym in myn na∣me
/ and oftentymes hym thanke of his
grete curteysye / that he to me hath done
& namely for the rynge that he yaue me
whan he had herde masse at Westmes∣tre
for saynt Iohans loue Euangelyst
And toke the rynge / & toke it to the pyl∣grymes
& sayd. I praye you go and bere
this rynge / & take it vnto kyng Edwar¦de
/ & telle hym that I sende if hym / & a
full ryche yefte I wyll hym yeue. For vp¦on
the .xij. daye he shall come vnto me / &
euer more dwelle in blysse without ony
ende. ¶Syr sayd the pylgrymes / what
man be ye / and in what coūtree is your
dwellynge. ¶Fayre frendes sayd he. I
am Iohn the Euangelyst / & I am dwel¦lynge
with almyghty god / & your kyng
Edwarde is my frende / & I loue hym in
specyall for by cause that he hath euer∣more
lyued in clennesse & is a clene may¦de
/ & I praye you my message fulfyll as
I haue you sayd. Whan y
t
 saynt Iohn y
•

Euangelyst had them thus charged / so∣denly
he voyded out of theyr syght{is} both
The pylgrymes tho thanked almyghty
god & went forth theyr waye. And whan
they had gone two or thre myle / they be∣gan
to waxe very & sette them adowne
for to rest them / & so they felle on slepe / And
whan they 
had
 slepte well / one of
them awoke & lyfte vp his heed & loked
about / & sayd to his felowe. Aryse vp &
walke we in our waye. What sayd that
one felowe vnto that other / where be we
now. Certes sayd that other / it semeth
me that this is not the same coūtree the∣re
we layde vs downe in for to rest & sle¦pe.
For we were from Ierusalem but thre
myle. They toke vp theyr hondes & bles¦syd
them / & wente forth in theyr waye / And
as they went in theyr waye / they sa¦we
sheperdes goynge with theyr shepe y
•

spake none other langage but englysshe
¶Good frendes sayd one of the pylgry¦mes
/ what coūtree is this / & who is lor∣de
therof. ¶And one of the sheperdes
answered & sayd / this coūtree is the coū¦tree
of Kente in Englonde / of the whi∣che
the good kyng Edwarde is lorde of.
The pylgrymes thanked tho almyghty
god & saynt Iohn Euangelyst / & wente
forth in theyr waye & came to Caunter∣bury
/ & fro thens vnto London / & there
they foūde the kyng. And tolde hym all
from the begynnynge vnto the endynge
asmoche as saynt Iohn had them char∣ged
/ & of all thyng{is} how they had sped
by the waye. And toke the rynge to kyn¦ge
Edwarde / & he toke it / & thanked al∣myghty
god & saynt Iohn Euangelyst
And tho made hym redy euery daye fro
daye to daye to departe out of this lyf / whan
god wolde for hym sende.






¶How saynt Edwarde deyed the
Twelfth daye.


ANd after it befell thus on Cryst

he became full syke / and in the morowe
endured with moche payne the masse

reste hym. But in his halle amonge his
barons and his knyghtes myght he not
come theym for to comforte and solace / as
he was wonte for to do at that wor∣thy
feest. Wherfore all theyr myrth and


comfort amonge al that were in the hal∣le
was tonned in to care & sorowe / bycau¦se
they dradde for to lese the good lorde
the kyng. ¶And vpon saynt Iohn daye
Euangelyst that came next / the kyng re¦ceyued

¶How Stephen of Langton came ayen

SO whan the fourme of accorde∣ment
thus was ordeyned. It was

And foure bysshops about sayd toke y

that other parte of the endentures / they
bare with theym to shewe to the kynge / 
¶Whan the kynge sawe the fourme &
vnderstode he helde hȳ full well apayed
of all maner thynges as they had ordey¦ned / 
sauynge as touchynge / restytucyon
of the goodes for to make ayen. To that
thynge he wolde not accorde / & so he sente
ayen to the foure bysshops / that
they sholde do out & put awaye that 

poynt of restytucyon. But they answe∣red
/ that they wolde not doo one worde
out. ¶Tho sente the kynge to the Ar∣chebysshop
by the foure bysshops that he
sholde come to Caunterbury for to spe∣ke
with hym there / and sente vnto hym

 vnder pledges. That is
to sayet / his 

at his owne wyll
And thus in this maner tharchebysshop
Stephen came to Coūterbury. Whan y

Archebysshop was come / the kyng came
to Ch
haz. For he wolde no nyghe Caū¦terbury
at that tyme. But he sent by his
Tresorer bysshop of Wyncestre y

 he shol¦de
do out of the endentures y

 clause of / restytucyon / for
to make of the goodes / 
¶And tharchebysshop made his othe y

he wolde not neuer do out 
o worde ther∣of
/ ne yet it chaūge of that the bysshops
had spoken & ordeyned. And tho the
chebysshop yede ayen to R

ony more doynge. ¶Kynge Iohn was
tho wrother than euer he was before / &
lete make a comyn crye thorugh out all

rentes / & went ouer the see / that they
sholde come ayen in to Englonde at a

cōmaunded to euery Shyref thrugh out

dradde soo moche his menace / that
he forsoke alle the abbaye & wente

came to the pope / that the kyng
hat done so moche malyce / then he was
towarde the kynge full wroth. And sen∣te
two Legates vnto the kynge / that one

¶How Pandulf delyuered a clerke that
had falsyd & coū
tyd the kyng{is} mo∣neye
before the kynge hymself.


ANd anone the commaunded the
kyng the Syrefs & Bayly
s of
Northampton / that were in the kynges
presence / that they sholde kynge forth
all the prysoners / that they myght be do¦ne
to deth before Pandulf / for by caus

the kynge wened that they wolde haue
gaynsayd theyr dedes / for cause of the
deth all thynge that they had spoken a∣fore.
¶Whan the prysoners were come
before the kynge / the kynge cōmaunded
some to be hanged / & some to be drawen
and some to drawe out theyr eyen out of
theyr heed. And amonge all other / there
was a clerke that had fullyd the kynges
moneye. And the kynge cōmaūded that
he sholde le hanged and drawed. And
whan Pandulf herde this commaunde∣ment
of the kynge / he sterte hȳ vp ryght
quyckly / & anone axed a booke & a can∣delb
/ and wolde haue cursyd the kynge / &
all theym that wolde sette vppon the
clerke ony honde. And Pandulf hymself
wente for to seke a crosse. And the kyng
folowed hym / & delyuered hym the cler∣ke
by the hotde that he sholde doo with
hym what he wolde. And thus was the
clerke delyuered & wente them. ¶And
Pandulf and Duraunt his felowe wen¦te
fro the kynge / & came agayne to the
pope of Rome. And tolde hym that kyn¦ge
Iohan wolde not amended be. But
euer abode so accursyd. ¶And neuerthe∣les
the pope graunted that yere 

out all Englonde / that 
 myght



 chirches / and

 body / & gyue it to
syke men whiche were lykly to passe out
of this worlde. And also y
•
 men myght
crysten childern ouer all y

 londe. ¶And
whan the pope wyste and sawe that the
kynge wolde not be vnder the rule of ho¦ly
chirche for no maner thynge. The po¦pe
thenne sente to the kynge of Fraunce
in remyssyon of his synnes / that he shol¦de
take with hym all the power that he
myght / & go in to Englonde for to de∣stroye
the kynge Iohn. ¶Whan these
tydynges came to kynge Iohn / thenne
was he sore anoyed / & sore dradde lest he
sholde lese his reame / & hymself be done
to the deth. ¶Thenne sent he to the po¦pe
messengers & sayd. He wolde be Iusti∣fyed
/ and come to amendement in all
thynges / & wolde make satysfaccyon to
all maner of men after the popes ordy∣naunce.
¶Thenne sente the pope ayen
in to Englonde Pandulf & other messen¦gers
/ and came to Caunterbury to the
kynge & there abode. And the .viij. daye
of May / the kynge made an othe for to
stande to the popes ordynaunce / before
Pandulf y
•
 Legate in all maner of thyn¦ges
in whiche he was accursyd. And that
he sholde make full restytucyon to all
men of holy chirche & of relygyon / and
of the goodes that he had taken of them
ayenst theyr wyll. And all the grete lor∣des
of Englonde swore vppon the boke
& by theyr holydom / that yf the kynge
wolde not holde his othe / they sayd that
they wolde by strength make hym holde
it. ¶Thenne put the kynge hym to the
courte of Rome / and theme gaaf he vp
the reame of Englonde and of Irlonde
for hym and for his heyres for euer mo∣
e
that sholde come after hym / 
 that
kynge Iohn and his 
eytes sholde take
the two reames of the popes hondes / 
And sholde euery yere paye ferme vnto
the courte of Rome a thousande marke
of syluer. And tho toke the kynge the
crowne of his heed and sette it vpon his

of all the grete lordes of Englon¦de.
Here I resygne vp the crowne and the
realme of Englonde in to the pope In∣nocenci{us}
hondes the thyrde / and put me
hooly in his mercy & in his ordynaunce
¶Tho receyued Pandulf the crowne

as fore seasynge / takynge of two real∣mes

cōfermed all maner thyng / by his real∣tre

¶How the clerkes that were 

came agayne / and how kyng Iohn was
assoylled.


SO when this chartre was made
and ensealed / the kynge receyued
agayne his crowne of Pandulfus hon∣de.
And sente anone vnto the Archebys∣shop
Stephen / and to all his after cler∣kes
and lewde men / that he had exiled
out of this londe / that they sholde come
ayen in to Englonde / and haue agayn
theyr londes and also theyr rentes. And
that he wolde make reflytucyon of the
goodes that he 
had
 taken of theyrs a∣yenst
theyr wyll. ¶The kynge hymself
tho and Pandulf / and erles and 

went vnto Wynchestre ayenst the Arche¦bysshop
Stephen. ¶And whan he was
come. the kynge wente ayenst hym and
fell adowne to his feet / and thus to hym
sayd. Fayre syre ye be welcome. And I
crye you mercy by cause that I haue tres¦passed
ayenst you. ¶The Archebysshop
toke hym vp tho in his armes / and kys∣syd
hym curteysly oftentymes / and after
ledde hym to the doore of saynt Swy∣thunes
chirche by the honde / and assoyl∣led
hym of the sentence / and hym 
∣syled
to god & to holy chirche. And that
was on Saynt Margaretes daye. And
the Archebysshop anone went 





she asked. The Legate wente thenne a∣gayn
to the pope after Cryst

the kynge sence ouer see to Iulyan that
was kynge Rychardes wyf / for to haue
a relace of that she axed of hym. ¶And
so it befell / that Iulyan deyed anone af¦ter
Eester. And in soo moche the kynge
was quyte of that thynge that she ared
¶But thenne at the feest of saynt Iohn
that came next after / thorugh the popes
cōmaundement / the enterdytynge was
fyrst releasyd thrughout all Englonde / the
seuenth daye of Iulij. And vii. 

was the londe enterdyted. And on y
•
 mor¦nynge
men ronge and sayd masse tho∣rugh
out all London and soo after tho¦rugh
out all Englonde. ¶And the next
yere after there began a grete debate by∣twene
kynge Iohan and the lordes of
Englonde / for by cause that be wolde
not graūe the lawes and holde the

saynt Edwarde 
had
 ordeyned and
had ben vsed and holden vnto that to

de
holde noo lawe / but dyde alle thynge
that hym lyked / and dyshertysed many
men without consente of lordes and

 londe. And wolde 
 the
good erle Rodulf of Ch

 for by 
se
that he vndertoke hȳ of his wycked¦nesse
/ and for cause that he dyde so mo∣che
shame and vylany to god and to ho¦ly
ch

his owne brothers wyf / and laye also
by many other 
 greate lord

doughters. For be spared noo woman
that hym lyked for to haue. Wherfore
all the lordes of the londe were wroche
and 
 the cyte of London. To c
sse
this debate the Archebtysshop and lo
des
of the londe assembled before the feest of
saynt Iohn Baptyst in a medowe bely¦de
the towne of Stanys that is called





 for the kyn¦ge
hymselfe soone after dyde ayenst the poyntes
of the same chartre that he had
made. Wherfore the moost parte of the
lordes of the londes assembled and began
to warre vppon hym ayen / and 
nned
his towers / & robbed his folke / and dy∣de
all the sorowe that they myght / & ma¦de
them as stronge as they myght with
all the power they had / and thought to
dryue hym out of Englonde / and make
Lowys the kyng{is} sone of Fraunce kyng
of Englonde. ¶And kynge Iohn̄ sente
tho ouer see / and ordeyned so moche peo¦ple
of Normans / & of Pycardes / and of
Flemynges / soo that the londe myght
not susteyne them / but with moche soro∣we.
¶And amonge all this people / the∣re
was a man of Normandye that was
called Fawkis of Brent / and this Nor∣man
& his company spared nother chu∣ches
ne houses of relygyon / but they
brente & robbed it / and bare awaye alle
that they myght take so that the londe
was all destroyed / what of ony syde and
of other. ¶The barons and lordes of
Englonde ordeyned amonge theym the
beste spehers and wysest men / and sente
them ouer the see to kynge Phylypp of
Fraunce & prayed hym / that he wolde
sende Lowys his sone in to Englonde
to be kynge of Englonde / & to receyue
the crowne.






¶How Lowys the kynges some of Fraū¦ce
came in to Englonde with a stronge
power of peple / to be kyng of Englonde


A None as kynge Philyp of Fraū¦ce
herde these tydynges / he ma∣de

that were in presence of Lowys / made
vnto hym homage / and became his men






was sette before hym vppon the table / And
the monke sayd / that the loof was
worth but an half peny. O sayd the kyn¦ge
tho. Here is grete chepe of brede. Now
sayd he cho / and I may lyue ony whyle
suche a loof shall be worth .xx. shelynges
or half a yere be gone. And so whan he
sayd this worde / moche he thought / and
often he syghed / and toke and ete of the
brede / and sayd by god / the worde that
I haue spoken / it shall be soth. ¶The
monke that stode before the kynge was
for this worde full sory in his herte / and
thought / rather be wolde hymselfe suf∣fre
deth / and thought yf he myght ordey¦ne
therfore some manere remedye. And
anone the monke wente vnto his abbot
and was shryuen of hym / and tolde the
abbot all that the kynge had sayd. And
prayed his abbot for to assoyle hym / for
he wolde yeue the kynge such a drynke
that all Englonde sholde be glady there
of and Ioyfull. Tho yede the monke in
to a gardeyne / and founde a greate tode
therin / and toke her vp and put her in a
cuppe / & prycked the tode thorugh wich
a broche many tymes tyll that the ve∣nym
came out of euery syde in the cuppe
And tho toke the cuppe & fylled it with
good ale / and brought it before the kyn¦ge
knelynge sayenge. Syr sayd he Wash
sayll / for neuer the dayes of all your lyf
dronke ye of so good a cuppe. ¶Begyn
monke sayd the kynge. And the monke
dranke a grete draught / & toke the kyn∣ge
the cuppe / and the kynge dranke al∣so
a grete draught / and sette downe the
cuppe. The monke anone ryght wente
in to 
 and there deyed anone / on

 soule god haue mercy Amen.
And fyne monk{is} synge for his soule spe¦cyally
/ and shall whyle that the abbay

standeth. The kynge rose vp anone full
euyll at ease and comaunded to remeue
the table / & axed after the monke. And
men tolde hym that he was deed for his
wombe was broken in sondre. ¶Whan
the kynge herde this / he comaunded for
to trusse / but it was for nought / for his
bely began to swelle for the drynke that
he had dronke / and within two da
 he
deyed on the morowe after saynt Luli

had
 many fayre chidern of
his body begoten / that is to saye. Henry

hym / and all tho that were contrary to
his opynyon the pope assoylled. And the
same sentence Girgori{us} the .ii. renewed
And this same man put Henry his ow∣ne
sone into pryson / and there murdred

¶Of kyng Henry the thyrde that was
crowned at Gloucetre.


ANd after this kynge Iohn reg∣ned
his sone Henry / & was crow¦ned
at Gloucetre whan he was .ix. yere
olde / on seynt Symondes daye & Iude
of Swalo the Legate of Rome thrugh
coūseyll of all the grete lordes that helde
with kynge Iohan his fader / that is to
saye / the erle Radulf of Chestre. Willy∣am
erle Marshall erle of Penbroke. Wil¦lyam
the Brener erle of Feriers. Serle
the manly baron. And all other grete lor¦des
of Englonde helde with Lowys the
kynges sone of Fraūce. And anone after
whan kynge Henry was crowned. Swa¦lo
the Legate helde his coūseyll at Bry∣stowe
at saynt Martyns feest. And there
were .xi. bysshops of Englonde & of Wa¦lys
/ & of other prelates of holy chirche a
grete nombre / and erles & barons / & ma¦ny
knyghtes of Englonde. And all tho
that were at that coūseyll / swore feawte
vnto Henry the kynge that was kynge
Iohns sone. ¶And anone after the Le∣gate
enterdyted Walys / for cause that
they helde with the barons of Englon∣de.
Also all tho that holpe / or yaue ony
coūseyll to meue warre ayenst the newe
kynge Henry he accursyd them. And at
the begynnynge / he put in the sentence
the kyng{is} sone of Fraunce Lowys. And
neuertheles the same Lowys wolde not
spare for all that. But wente & toke the
castell of Barcamstede / and also the ca∣stell
of Hertforde. And from that daye
afterwarde / the barons dyde there somo
che harme thrughout all Englonde. and
pryncypalle the Frensshe men that were
with kynge Lowys. Wherfore the grete
lordes / and all the comyn people of En∣glonde
/ lete them dresse / for to dryue Lo∣wys
& his company out of Englonde / but
some of the barons & Frensshe men
were gone to the cyte of Nicholl / & toke
the towne & helde it to kyng Lowys pro∣fyte.
But chyther came kynge Henryes
men with a grete power / that is to saye
the erle Radulf of Chestre / & Wyllyam
erle Marshall / & Wyllyam the Brener
erle of Feriers / & many other lordes w
t
 
them / & yaue batayll vnto Lowys men.
And there was slayne the erle of Per∣chees
/ and Lowys men were fowle dys∣comfyted.
And there was taken Serle
erle of Wynchestre / and Humfroy de
Boune erle of Hertforde / & Robert the
sone of Walter / & many other that be∣gan
warre ayenst the kynge / there they
were taken & ledde vnto kynge Henry / that
was kynge Iohans sone. ¶And
whan y
e
 tydynges came to Lowys of the
dyscomfyture / y
•
 was the kynges sone of
Fraūce. He remeued fro thens & wente
vnto London / and lete shytte the yates
fast of the cyte. And anone after the kyn¦ge
sent to the Burgeys of London / that
they sholde yelde them vnto hym / & the
cyte also. And he wolde theym graunte
all theyr fraunchyses that euer they we∣re
wonte to haue before. And wolde con∣ferme
them by his greate newe chartre
vnder his brode seale. ¶And in the sa∣me
tyme a greate lorde that wat called
Eustace the monke came out of Fraun¦ce
with a grete company of Lordes / and
wolde haue come in to Englonde / for to
haue holpen Lowys the kynges sone of
Fraunce. But Hubert of Brugh / & the
fyue portes with .viij. shyppes tho mette
with them in the hyghe see / & assaylled
theym egrely / and ouercame them with
strength / & smote of Eustace the mon∣kes
heed. And toke also .x. grete lordes of
Fraunce & put theym in to pryson. And
slewe almoost all the men that came w
t
 
theym / and anone drowned the shyppes
in the see.






¶How Lowys torned ayen in to Fraū∣ce
/ and of the confermacyon of kynge
Iohans chartre.



SO whan Lowys herde these ty∣dynages
/ he dradde sore to be deed
& lost. And let ordeyne / & speke bytwe∣ne
y

 kynge & Lowys by the Legate Swa¦lo.
And thorugh the Archebysshopp of
Caūterbury / & thrugh other grete lordes
that all the prysoners on that one halfe
& that other sholde be delyuerd & go quy¦te.
And Lowys hymself sholde haue for
his costes a thousande pounde of syluer.
& sholde go out of Englonde / and come
neuer more therin agayne. And in this
maner was the accorde made bytwene
kynge Henry and Lowys. And tho was
Lowys assoylled of y
•
 popes Legate / that
was called Swalo of the sentence that
he was in / & the Barons of Englonde
also. And after this kyng Henry & Swa¦lo
the Legate & Lowys went to Merton
& there was y
•
 peas confermed / & bytwe¦ne
them ordeyned And after Lowys wen¦te

¶Howe the Englysshmen stoppyd the

THis tyme the Scottes hadde as∣sembled
all theyr power & came
into Englonde / and slewe & robbyd all
that they myght take / and also brente &


dystroyed all the north countre thrughe

so y

but oonly vnto ther harmes. And they a¦bode
in the parke: xv. dayes / & vytaylles
faylled them in euery syde. so y

 they we¦re
greatly peyred of bodyes / & syth that
Brute came fyste into Brytayne vnto

 whiche ordeined

consentyd not therto / for he hadd
p

 they myght go awaye into their

. ¶And this same Morty¦mer
coūseylled somoch Thomas of bro¦therton
y

 y

 forsayd Thomas
sholde not assemble at that tyme vnto y

Scottes. And he assentyd. but he wyste
not the doynge bytwene y

 Scottes & the
forsayd Mort

was Marshall of Englonde / as to hyz¦perteyned
euer y

 vaūtwarde. he sent has¦tely
to y

 they sholde not fyght w

& with his folke yf he had go to fyghte

dysceyued & wist no thynge of y

And thus was y

 kynge pryncypally dis¦ceyued.
And whan it was nyght Morty¦mer
/ y

 nyght dystrobled y

 noo
thynge myght be doon. And in y

 meane
while y

¶And so was the kyng falsly betrayed
y

 wenyd y
•
 all the traytours of his londe
had ben broughte to an ende as it was
sayd before. ¶Now here you lordes how
traytoursly kynge Edwarde was dyscei¦ued.
& howe meruayllously & boldly the
Scottes dyd of werre / For Iamys dou∣glas
with two hundred men of armys
rode thrugh out all y

 same nyght y

 Scottes escaped
towarde theyr owne coūtree as is aboue
sayd / tyll y

 they came to y

a nother tyme a Douglas a Douglas / wherfore
y

& moche other folke / were wonder sore a¦frayed
/ But blyssyd be almyghty god y

kynge was not taken / and in greate pe¦ryll
was tho the reame of Englonde. &
that nyght the moone shone full clere / and
bryght. And for all the kynges men
the Scottes scapyd harmeles. ¶And on
the morowe whan the kynge wyste that
the Scottes were escapyd into theyr ow¦ne
countrey he was wonder sory / & fulle
hertely wepte with his yonge eyen / and
yet wyst he notte who hadde hym done
that treason. But that fals treason was
full welle I knowen a good while after
as the storye makyth mencyon / ¶Tho
kynge Edward came ayen vnto Yorke
full sorowfull / And his host departyd / &
euery man went into his owne countre
with full heuy chere and mornynge sem¦blaunt
/ And the Henaundes toke theyr
leue and went into theyr owne countree
And the kynge for theyr trauaylle / huge¦ly
rewarded thē / ¶And for bycause of
y

 vyage / y

 kynge had dyspended moche


of his tresoure and wastyd. And in that
tyme were seen two moones in y

 fyrma¦ment
/ y

 one was clere / & that other was

¶And a grete debate was y

of y

 kȳge was
therof nothynge gylty / wherfore he was
in peryll of lyf & lȳme: ¶And so he assē¦bled
all his retenewe & went & spake w

Brotherton erle of Marchall / and
syr Edmonde wodstok / that were the kȳ¦gys
vncles / and alsoo men of Londone
made theyr othe hym for to mayntene in
that same quarell. And theyr cause was
this / that the kynge sholde holde his hou¦se

the quene Isabell sholde delyuer onte of

& hauteyn / y

 he wold lese & forsake the

 his 
elds
 had euer before / & for y

cause he let hym cal erle of marche. And
none of y
e
 comyns of Englonde durste
calle hym by othere name / for he was
callyd so by y

 kyngys crye. that men
sholde calle hym erle of Marche. & Mor¦tymer
bare hym so hauteyne & so proude
that wonder it was for to wyte. & alsoo
dysguysed hym with wonder ryche clo∣thes
oute of all manere of reason / both
of shapynge & of werynge. wherof the
Englysshmen had grete wonder / howe
and in what manere he myght contriue
or fynde suche manere pryde. And they
sayd amonge them comynly / y

 his pry∣de
sholde nott longe endure. ¶And the
same tyme syr Geffray Mortymer the
yonge / That was Mortymers sone. lete
calle hym kynge of foly / and so it befell
afterwarde in dede / for he was so fulle
of pryde and of wretchydnesse / that he
helde a rounde table in walys / to all mē
that theder came / & counterfeted the do¦ynge
and the manere of kynge Arthurs
table / but openly he fayled / for the noble
kynge Arthur was the moost noble lor∣de
of renomme / that was in all y

 world
in his tyme & yet came neuer none suche
after / For al y

 noble knyghtes in all cris¦tēdom
of dedys of armys assayed / dwel¦lyd
with kynge Arthur / and helde hym
for ther lorde and souerayne / And that
was well seen / for he oconquerde in a ba∣tayll
a Romayn that was callyd Froll.
and gate of hym the reame of Fraunce / and
slewe hym with his owne houndes / and
also he faught with a gyaunte that
was callyd Dynabus / & slewe hym that

ayenst Arthur / for to fyght with
hym so moche people of Romayns and
Pehites & sarrasyns / y

 noo man cowde
nombre them / & he dyscomfyted them al
as the story tellyth. ¶And in that same

hym there all that nyght / but lytyll¦hede
he toke of reste. and sayde vnto his

 we ben now lodged bytwene our

is no bote but deth. wherfore yf we aby¦de
styll all this nyght. I wene it shal tor¦ne
vs to moche harme. For the power of
Scotlonde may euery wexe and encre

and we may not so do. And we ben but
lytyll people as ayenst theym. Wherfore
I pray you for the loue of almyghty god
make we vs bolde and hardy / and that
we may myghtely take the Scottes this
nyghte / and boldly werre vppon theym.
and lete vs pursue theyme this nyghte.
And yf they be traueylled thorughe vs.
and see our hardynesse. other Scottes y

se them so traueylled and wery: the sorer
woll they be adradde with vs too fyghte
and fyersly thenne shall we fyght wyth

the grace of god / all the worlde shal
speke of the doughtynes of our chyual∣ry.
¶And syres vnderstondeth well that
alle the companye that came wyth syre
Robert Bailloll / graunted well vnto y

counsell / & were therof ryght glad. and
anone pursued vppon the Scottes. that
they became wonder wery. And Baillol
& his company sore folowed them / & dy¦de
them moche harme & sorowe / thrugh
the r
assente. so that they myght not for
feblynesse them helpe / and for lytyl peo∣ple.
¶But tho sayd the Scottes amon∣ge
them / what is now befall that so ly∣tyll
a people as Bailloll hath in wyng
dooth vs so moche traueyll and sorowe / Now
certes it semyth vs that he werketh
by grace / for he is wonder gracyous in
his quarell and we certes shall be dede
or that we may come to him. vs for too

¶And among al other thynges Bail¦loll
and his people passed the water of
Erne so that Robert Swynerton the so¦ne
was fyers and angrye / & went forth
and they sawe people of armes full wel
arayed. and forth they went vnto them
and with them faught. and slewe & toke

at that assawte they wende it had be the

for to haue slayne kynge Henry the fyft
& all his brethern by a fals trayne soda¦ynly
or they hadde be ware. But god al¦myghty
helde his holy honde ouer them
and saued them frome these peryllous

receyued of the Frensshmen a Myllyon

all thre Iuged vnto the dethe / and this
was the Iugement y

 they sholde be lad¦de
thrugh Hampton & withoute North

charged hym to delyuer the towne. And
the Capytayne sayd that he wolde dely¦uer

¶And they that were within the

and hadde hym go & putte out all y

And than our kynge beholdynge and

after his owne name. And thenne Sax∣ons

Or it is called Anglia of a quene that

how the Pyctes were dystroyed & fayled
¶Gir p̄. ca: vii. Brytayne was somty∣me
occupyed with Saxons / & peas was
made and stablysshed with the Pyctes / thenne
the Scottes that came with the
Pyctes sawe that the Pyctes were nobler

they were lasse in nombre than the Scot¦tes
Thenne the Scottes hauynge therof
enuye torned to theyr naturall treason y

they haue ofte vsed for in treason they
passe other men and ben traytours as it

drewe vp nayles that helde vp holowe bē¦ches

sodaynly fyll in ouer the hammes
into a wonderfull pytfalle. Thenne the
Scottes fell on the Pyctes and slew thē
and lefte none alyue. And so of two ma∣nere
people the better warryours were ho¦ly
destroyed. But the other that been the
Scottes which ben traytours all vnlyke
to the Pyctes toke prouffyte by that fals
treason / for they toke all that londe and
holde it yet vnto thys tyme and calle it.
Scotlonde after hir owne name / In kȳg

¶Of the meruaylles and wondres of
Irlonde. ca .xxviii.


MAny men tellen that in y
•
 north
syde of Irlonde is the londe of ly¦fe.
In that ylond noman may deye but
whan they ben olde and vexed with gre∣te
fekenes / they ben born out into y
•
 nex¦te
lond and deye ther. There is an other
ylonde in Irlōde that no woman therin
may bere a chylde / but yet she may con¦ceyue.
Also ther is an ylonde in whiche
no dede body maye roten. In vltonia y
•

is Vlster is an ylonde in a lake wonderly


departed in tweyne In that one parte is
grete dysturbaunce and dyscomforth of
fendes and in that other partye gretely
kynge & comforth of holy angels Ther
is also saynt patryks purgatory y
t
 was
shewed at his prayer to cōferme his pre¦chynge
and his lore whan he preched to
mysbyleued men of sorowe and payne
that euyll men sholde suffre for her euyl
werkes And of Ioy & of blysse that go∣de
men shall resceyue for her holy dedes
he telleth that who that suffreth the pay¦nes
of purgatory / yf it be enioyned hym
for penaūce he shall neuer suffre the pay¦nes
of hell / but he deye fynally without
repentaunce of synne / as the ensample.
is sette more full at this chapytre ende.
¶Treuisa. But truly noman maye be
saued but yf he be very repentaūt what
someuer penaunce he do / and euery mā
that is very repentaunt at his lyues ende
shall be sekerly saued / though he ueuer
here of saynt Patryks purgatorye. The¦re
is an ylonde in cōnacte Sale / that is
in the se of Conaccia halowed by saynt
Brandon that hath no myse / there dede
bodyes ben not buryed but ben kept out
of the erthe and roten not. In Mamoni¦a
is a well / who that wassheth hym w
t
 
that water of that welle he shall waxe / hore
on his heed. There is an other wel
in Vltonia who sōeuer is wasshen ther∣in
he shall neuer wexe hore afterwarde / There
is a welle in Mounstre or Ma∣monia
/ yf ony man touche that welle a
none shall falle grete rayne in all y
•
 pro∣uynce
/ and that rayne shall neuer cesse∣tyll
a preste that is a clene mayden syn∣ge
a masse in a chapelle that is faste by
and blesse the water / and with mylke of
a cowe that is of one heer bespryngr the
welle / and so reconcyle the welle in this
straūge manere. At Glyndalcan about
thee 
 of saynt Keyyn wythes be∣tyth
apples as it were apple trees & ben
more belsome than sa
ry. That holy / saynt

ough forth these apples by pia
yers for to hele his chylde that was seke
There is a lake in Vlster & moche fyssh
therin / whiche is .xxx. myle in lengthe &
xv. in brede. The Ryuer Ban tennethe
out of that lake into the north Occean
and men saye that this lake beganne in
this maner. There were men in that coū¦tree
that were of euyll lyuynge / coeūtes
cū brutis. And there was a well in that
londe in grete reuerence of olde tyme / &
alway couered / yf it were lefte vncoue∣red
the welle wolde ryse and drowne all
the londe. And so it happed that a wo∣man
wente to that well for to fetche wa¦ter
and hyed her fast to her chylde that
wepte in the cradell / and left the well vn¦couered
/ thenne the well sprange so fa

that it drowned the woman & her chyld
and made all the countre a lake and a
fysshe ponde. For to preue that this is to
the it is a grete argument / that whanne
the weder is clere / fysshers of that water
se in the grounde vnder the water roūde
toures and hygh shapen as steples and
chirches of that londe. In the north syde
of Irlonde in the countre of Ossyryens
euery .vii. yere at the prayer of an holy
Abbot / tweyne that ben wedded a man
and a woman muste nedes be eryled and
forshapen into lyknes of wolues & aby∣de
out .vii. yere. And at ende of .vii yere.
yf they lyue they come home a gayne and
take agayne theyr owne shappe / & then
shall other tweyne go forth in theyr ste∣de
and so forshapen for other .vii. yere.
Ther is a lake in this londe yf a poole
of tree pyght and stycked therin y
•
 parte
of the shafte or poole that is in the erthe
shall torne into yron and that parte y
•
 a
bydeth in the water shall come into sto∣ne
/ and the parte y
•
 abydeth aboue shall
be tree in his owne kynde. Also ther is a
lake y
•
 tornethe basell into asshe & asshe
into hasell yf it be done therein. Also in
Ikonde been thre samon lrpes there as
samons lepe ayemst a tothe a longe spe∣res
lenthe. Also in Leginia is a pounde


there be seen colmans byrdes / the herdes
ben called certelles and come homely to
mannes honde but yf men do hem wrō¦ge
or harme. they gone away and come
notte agayne / & the water there shall be
bytter and stynke / and he that dydde the
wronge shall not after without wretche
& myschyef but yf he do amendes ¶R.
As touchynge Patryks purgatorye. Ye
shall vnderstonde that the seconde saynt
Patryk that was abbot & not bysshoppe
whyle he prechyd in Irlonde laboured &
studyed for to torne thylke wycked men
that lyued as bestes out of her euyll lyfe
for drede of paynes of helle / and for too
conferme hem to good lyfe / & they sayd
they wolde not 
orne but some of theym
myght know somwhat of the grete pay¦nes
and also of y
•
 blysse that he spake of
Thenne saynt Patryk prayed to god al
myghty therfore / & our lorde Ihesu crist
appyered to saynt Patryk and toke hȳ
a staffe and ladde hym into a wylde pla¦ce
and shewed hym there a rounde pytte
that was derke within and sayd / that yf
a man were very repentaunt and stable
in byleue and wente into this pytte and
walkede therin a daye and a nyght / he
sholde se the sorowes and the paynes of
euyll men / and the Ioy and blysse of go¦od
men. Thenne cryste vanysshed oute
of patryks syght / and saynt Patryk are
red and buylded there a chirche and put
therin chanons reguler & closed the pyt
about with a walle / and is nowe in the

•
 chyr¦che
and faste shytte with a stronge doore
for no man sholde nycely go in without

many men torned and were conuerted

Noman is enioyned for to go into

as men of this nacyon ben more
angry than other men & more hasty for
to take wretche whyles they ben alyue / so
sayntes & halowes of this londe ben
more wretchefull than sayntes of othere
londes. Clerkes of this londe ben chaste
and sayen many prayers & done greate
abstynence a daye / & drynketh all nyght
so is aco
ed for a myracle / that lechery
regneth not there as wyne regneth / and


ben chosen out of abbayes into the cler∣gye
/ and doone as monkes sholde / what

other. So good men amonge theym
choughe they ben but fewe been good at
the best / prelates of that countre ben full
slowe in correccyon of trespas / and besy
in contemplacyon and not in prechynge
of goddes worde. Therfore it is that all
