A translation by Abraham Hartwell of: Lopes, Duarte. Relatione del reame di Congo.
Signatures: [fleuron]⁴ (-[fleuron]4, +2*2) *⁴ 2*²  (-2*2) A-2E⁴.
A2 is an additional title page: A reporte of the kingdome of Congo, a region of Africa.
2*2 cancels [fleuron]4; verso, line 2 up, has "glykerōteron". Variant: [fleuron]4 uncancelled, with reading "glyketrōteron".
The engraved maps are signed "Willia[m] Rogers". The map of the Congo comes in two states: (1) lacking or (2) including the arms of Alvarus, first king of the Congo, in upper right. Copies having the map in state 1 should have an additional woodcut, numbered 9, showing the coat of arms, inserted following S3; this is omitted in collation above.
