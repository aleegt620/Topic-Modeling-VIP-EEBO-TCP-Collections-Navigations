removall of all suspition and prevention of fraud herein, it is agreed, That all Ships, Waggons, Wares and men, belonging to either Confederate, shall in their passage, have Letters of safe conduct, commonly called Passe-ports, and Certificates signed by the Go∣vernour, or chief Magistrate of the Province or City, from whence they come; Of which Letters and Cer∣tificates such forms shall be observed as shall be mu∣tually concluded upon, within the space of 4 months, next after the date hereof. And wheresoever any the Merchandize, goods, vessels, or men belonging to ei∣ther, their People and Subjects, shall be met with either in open Sea, or in any Channel, Haven, Road, Land, or any other place by the Ships of War, publick or private, or by any the People, Subjects and Inha∣bitants of the other, or shall happen to be in one place with them, they producing their Letters of safe Con∣duct and Certificates aforesad, shall have nothing fur∣ther exacted of them, no search made, either of Goods, Vessels or Men, much lesse shall they receive any da∣mage, injury or molestation; but shall be suffered to passe on with freedome to pursue their occasions. And if any People and Subjects of either shall do, or commit any thing contrary to the proper sense of this present Article, either Confederate shall take care that severe punishment be inflicted on the Offenders, and cause full and speedy satisfaction to be made to the parties wronged, for all Costs and Damages.


XIII. In case it shall hereafter happen, that du∣ring this Amity and Confederation, any of the Peo∣ple or subjects of either, shall act or attempt any thing against the same or any part thereof, either by Land, Sea, or other waters, this Amity, Confederation and Allyance, shall not be thereupon interrupted or bro∣ken

of, but shall remain and continue still in full force and virtue. Onely in such case the particular persons which have offended, shall be punished, and no o∣thers; And that Justice shall be done and satisfaction made to all persons injured, within 12 months after Demand thereof. And in case the Persons so offen∣ding as aforesaid shall not appear and submit them∣selves to Justice, and make satisfaction within the said Term, the said Persons shall be declared enemies to both States, and their estates, goods and effects whatsoever, shall be confiscated & employed to a due and full satisfaction for the wrong by them done. And their persons shall be lyable to further punishment when they shall come within the power of either State, as the quality of their offence shall deserve. And that speedy restitution and satisfaction be made for the losse and dammage which either part hath sustained from the other, during the War betwixt 
England
 and the United Provinces.


XIV. This present Treaty and Confederation shall in nothing derogate from any preeminence, right or Dominion of either Confederate within any his own Seas, Channels or Waters, but that they have and retain the same, in as full and ample manner as they have had, or as of right belongs to them.


XV. It being the primary intent of this League and Amity, that each Confederate their People and Subjects might enjoy such Navigation and Com∣merce, as is described in the foregoing Articles, with∣in the 
Balticke, Sound, Northern, Western,
 and 
British Seas, Mediterranean
 and 
Channel,
 and other the Seas in 
Europe;
 Therefore all sincere endeavor shall be used on both sides by common advise, aid and assistance, that the aforesaid mutuall Liberty of Navigation and

commerce, be established, promoted, and as occasion is, defended against all the Disturbers thereof, who shall go about to interrupt, prohibit, hinder or re∣strain and limit the same to their own will and plea∣sure, in prejudice of the said Confederates. And ei∣ther part shall with all willingnesse or readiness, pro∣mote the good and prevent the hurt each of other; Saving the Treaties which either Nation hath made with other Kingdoms, Commonwealths & Nations. And neither Confederate shall hereafter make any League or Agreement in prejudice of this present, with any other People or Nation without the privi∣ty and consent of the other, or if any such Agreement be hereafter made, the same shall be reputed null and voyd, and give place to this present Treaty. But as for the manner of giving aid and assistance each to o∣ther for the defence of this League and of the Liberty of Commerce and Navigation, a more particular a∣greement, as need shall require, shall be made there∣upon accommodated to the Circumstances of time and other affairs.


XVI. For what concerns other Commodities, which Ships of War may enjoy, and the Laws by which they shall regulate themselves when they ar∣rive in each others Ports and Harbors: and for what concerns commerce to be exercised in 
America;
 as also the advantages of the 
Herring,
 and other Fisheries, the erecting Staples for Trade, and other Things and Conditions which shall be found requisite for the better clearing of the foregoing Articles, Resolution shall be had therein according to what shall be agreed upon in a distinct and peculiar Treaty or Contract.


XVII. Whatever is agreed on in the foregoing Articles shall be in force and vertue from this present

time, and be truly observed on both sides by all such as are within each others Allegiance. And for the further Confirmation thereof, shall be subscribed, signed and ratified by the Protector of the Common∣wealth of 
England, Scotland
 and 
Ireland,
 and the Do∣minions thereto belonging, in the name of his High∣ness and the said Commonwealth, and by her Majesty of 
Sweden,
 under the handwriting and Seals of their said Highnesse and Majesty, within four months next ensuing the Date of these Presents.

Tunnis
 Road, 
April
 9. 1655.


AFter the 
Turks
 in 
Tunnis
 had given us an unsatis∣fied answer, we sailed to them again, and arrived

at 
Porta Ferina
 the 3 of 
April;
 when we came there the Officers met, and we sought to the Lord by Prayer, after which the Officers met in Counsel, and that day it was unanimously resolved by the Generalls and Captains, to set upon the Turks Ships there the next day, and to burn them. On the 4 of 
April
 we caused the Turks to flie before us, their Castle of 
Porta Ferina
 we battered, their strong Town and houses of stone we did beat about their ears: By break of day the whole fleet weighed anchor; The 
Newcastle
 Frigot went first in, after her the 
Kent,
 the 
Taunton,
 the 
Fore∣fight,
 the 
Amity, Princesse-Maria, Pearl, Mearmaid,
 and 
Merlin
 followed, and came to anchor neer the Turks 9 Ships who lay close to the Castle and Forts by it: Then came in the 
Andrew
 our Vice-Admirall, and the 
Plimouth,
 after them the 
George, Worcester, Ʋnicorn, Bridgwater,
 and 
Successe,
 these all anchored just against the Body of the Castle within musket shot, and began to play our broad sides of Guns at the Castle, which we plyed very thick for 4 or 5 hours; In the mean while our other Frigots sent their boats aboard the Ships to endeavor the firing of them, which by the blessing of God was done by 11 a clock; we had hot work of it, for their Ships lay within Pistoll shot of the shore, and all the Coast was lined with Musketeirs, and about 60 pieces of Ordnance mounted upon the Castle. The most men slain were in the Boats going aboard their Ships, which was by small shot, 30 is the most to be slain in the whole Fleet, and about 80 wounded; which considering the strength of the Place, and the many advantages the Turks had upon us, was but a small number. We are now in 
Tunnis
 Road, and Generall 
Blake
 hath sent once more a shore, but what will be done we know not.



April
 10. 1655. The Turks in 
Argier
 do consent to deliver up all the English that they have slaves, to Generall 
Blake,
 and declare that they desire a Confir∣mation of the Peace with 
England,
 and that the Lord Protector will send a Councill to them, to make a firm Peace with them for ever. And it is believed that 
Tripilo
 will do the like.

To our Venerable Brethren, The Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, Clergi-men, Religious, and all the Faithfull ones of Christ belonging to the Catholick Church.


ALEXANDER VII. 
POPE.


VEnerable Brethern, beloved Sons, greeting, and Apostolicall Benediction.


While from the height of our Apostolick Dignity we look round a∣bout us, and sollicitously survey the State of Things

throughout the World, as subjected to our Care and Charge, the Affairs of Christendom appear to be in a very sad and lamentable condition; for strangers make spoil of the Portion of the Lord, and his heri∣tage, casting out those that are indeed his Children. Those Nations, which out of our Fatherly love and tendernesse, we had a desire to take into our bosom, that is to say, into the bosom of true Religion, and most affectionately to embrace them, even they en∣deavor to rend and tear this very bosome in pieces; and making their way from the remotest parts of sea and land, have invaded the Flock of Christ. Yea and Catholick Princes disagreeing bend their Forces a∣gainst themselves, and (which is a Judgement that God threatned heretofore against our Enemies, and them that rise up against us) they devour one ano∣ther, and are made drunk with their own Blood, as it were with new wine. Whilst in time past, we were silently bewayling these things with our self, it see∣med good to him, who works things great and in∣comprehensible without number, to call us, unwil∣ling and trembling, to the Goverment of the Church; and to lay this immense burthen upon us, enough to make the strongest shoulders to shrink. What our sorrow hath been, we have testified by those publick prayers, which we enjoyned in all parts, as soon as we were advanced to the Supremacie; as also by those Letters which we sent to our most dear Sons, not onely to the Illustrious 
Ferdinand
 of 
Hungary
 and 
Bohemia
 King, and Roman Emperor Elect, but also to the 2 Kings, and which with griefe of heart we wrote a second time, when we perceived our most deadly Enemy designing ruine and destruction to all 
Europe,
 by distressing the most renowned Republick,

to the end that we might turn them from mutuall discords, against so dangerous an Adversary; and now also we send againe, admonishing them, that whilst their Armies are at a stand, during this winter season, they would use their utmost endeavor to settle Peace. Let all these things bear witnesse for us, that seeing there remains no hope to mittigate so great and sore evills, save onely in common concord, it is the main care that takes up our Mind night and day, to insinuate it into the hearts and affections of all men. But because this is not to be effected by humane strength and earthly wisdome, but ought to be ex∣pected from him as his gift, upon whom rests the discipline of our Peace, who takes away the Spirit of Princes, and rebuketh the Sea, and it is Still; there∣fore doe you 
(Venerable Brethren, and Beloved Sons)
 strive as much as in you lies, not onely by your en∣deavour, study, Counsel, duties, and Authority, but also rent your hearts in prayer, in tears, in fastings, and Alms deeds, take ye the Censor of Incense, that is, the prayer of the Saints; and stand ye in the gap be∣twixt the Fire, and the people that are ready to be consumed. You who are set to be watchmen upon the walls of 
Hierusalem,
 cry aloud night and day, and be ye the Appeasers of divine wrath and vengeance. Empty out the Cup of Fury and destruction, the Cup of anguish and of tribulation without mixture, with which we have been drunken. We for our part, to whom Christ thought not his sheep safely commit∣ted, till we were again and the third time admonished in 
Peter
 touching the greatnesse of his Love, to whom alone it is given to enter the Sanctuary, and to present the prayers of the people to God before the Altar, conceive it our duty with all diligence

to labour, that the Lord may not be angry, and say, 
I sought a man to make up the Breach, and to plead with me for the earth, that I might not destroy it, and I found him not, therefore have I powred out mine indignation upon them.
 For this is the property of divine vengeance, that he who is the most high, is then most easie to be entreated, and returns to gentlenesse and mercy, that is, to his own nature, when he draweth the sword with his mighty Arm and strong hand, to the end that he may strike. Let your Feet be the Feet of those that bring the glad Tidings of the Gospell of Peace, that the Bowes and Arrows may be broken in pieces, and that God may command the winds, and cause Peace and Tranquility; which by your assistance especially we desire to obtain, and doe most affectionately confer upon you our Apostoli∣call Benediction.

NATALIS RONDININƲS.






A Letter concerning the manner of the Queen of 
Swedens
 renouncing her Religion, and imbracing the Popish, written by an eye-witnesse, 


at 
Inspruck
 in 
Tiroll, 
October 26. 1655.


I Shall acquaint you with the manner of the en∣trance of the Queen of 
Sweden
 into this City. The Archduke of 
Tirol
 having many months since been advertised of the Queens intention, to passe through this City, resolved to give her an extraordinary noble entertainment. To this end he sent Letters to all the

Gentry and Nobility in this Country, and to his Friends in the parts adjacent, to wait upon him in their bravery at his Court on Saturday last. In the evening the Archduke having intelligence that the Queen would lodge within 9 mile of this City, took Post with his brother the Archbishop, and a dozen Gentlemen, and onely kist her hands, bidding her welcom into his Dominions, and returned back hi∣ther the same night. The next day, being Sunday, about 4 in the afternoon, 12 of the Archdukes Trum∣petters, and most of the aforesaid Nobility and Gen∣try rode before him, the Archdutchess, which is the Duke of 
Florence
 his Sister, being carried after him in a rich Sedan, the rest of the Gentry about and behind her; then followed his Guard on Horsback, being 50 Firelocks, his ordirnary Guard with Halberts stan∣ding on each side of the way: and in this equipage he met the Queen about a mile from the City; about 20 yeards before he came at her he light off his horse, and she out of her Sedan, and saluted one another; and so in the former manner, with Trumpets, Drums, and other loud Musick very fine, she entred the City.


The next day I saw her at dinner onely with the Archduke, his Lady, and Brother, which was very magnificent: I made account to have seen her at supper, but she supped privately; yet being at the Court, I was told, That the Queen the next day would make open profession of the Catholick Faith in the Franciscans or Archdukes Chappell, which not onely I, but all her Protestant Servants much admired at, and would not believe; but it proved true: For on the Wednesday between a 11 and 12 of clock, she was led to the aforesaid Church

by the Archduke, attended by the company afore∣said, and seated upon a Canopy on the left hand be∣fore the High Alter; below her, a little toward her right hand, was the Archduke, and his Lady, and Brother; and over against them the Spanish Ambas∣sador in a Chair by himselfe; all the Quire being hung with Crimson Velvet, and the ground covered with red Serge: Then Mr. 
Holstenius,
 who was sent as the Popes Nuntio, stood at the right side of the Al∣tar, and said, That Pope 
Alexander
 the VII, having understood that 
Christina
 Queen of 
Sweden,
 being en∣lightned by the Holy Ghost, had intent to put her self into the bosom of the Church, had sent his Letters to testifie his Approbation of her desires, and to receive her with his Apostolicall Benediction, therefore he was there to know, whether it were true or not; up∣on which she made answer, that it was so. Then he gave the Popes Letter to a Priest that stood by, who red it aloud to the effect abovesaid; the Letter being read, Mr. 
Holstenius
 desired that in Testimony of the truth, she would make Profession of the said Catholick Apostolick, and Roman Faith, and swear to keep it upon the Holy Evangelists, before the Archduke and the Spanish Ambassodor, which she did, and kissed the Book. Then was a Chair for 
Holstenius
 to sit in, and a Cushion laid at his Feet, upon which the Queen kneeled, and he making the sign of the Crosse over her head, and embracing her shoulders, said, That he did receive her into the Catholick Church, and by virtue of Order from the Holy Father, Pope 
Alexander
 the VII, and from power given by Christ, whose Vicar he was, he did absolve her from all her sins that she had committed, In the Name of the Father, 
&c.
 Then were certain short Prayers said (or rather sung) in

Latine for her; after which, High Masse was sung, and then a Priest made a Sermon in Dutch, his Text was out of the 
Psalms. Hear O my Daughter, incline also thine ear, forget also thy people and thy Fathers house; so shall the King have pleasure in thy Beauty.
 Then was 
Te Deum
 sung with most excellene Voices; and fifty peeces of Ordnance discharged, and so she retur∣ned home as she came.

Sect.
 1. I Doe firmly admit and embrace Apostoli∣call and Ecclesiasticall Traditions, and the other Observances and Constitutions of the Church. Also I admit the holy Scriptures according to that

sence which our holy Mother the Church, to whom it belongs to judge of the true sence and interpreta∣tion of holy Scriptures, hath held, and doth hold: neither will I ever take and interpret it but according to the unanimous consent of the Fathers.


Sect.
 2. I doe professe also that there be truly and properly seven Sacraments of the new Law instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ, and necessary to the salva∣tion of mankind, though all be not necessary for every man; that is to say, Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Penance, Extream unction, Order, and Matrimony; and that they confer grace: and of these Baptism, Confirmation and Order cannot be reiterated without Sacriledge: Also the received and approved Rites of the Catholick Church used in the solemn administration of all the aforesaid Sacra∣ments, I receive and admit.


Sect.
 3. All and every the things which are de∣fined and declared in the holy Councill of 
Trent
 concerning Originall sinne and Justification I em∣brace.


Sect.
 4. I professe also that in the Masse there is offred unto God a true, proper, and propitiatory Sa∣crifice for the quick and dead: and that in the most holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, there is truly, re∣ally, and substantially, the Body and Blood, together with the Soul and Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and there is made a conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the Body, and of the whole sub∣stance of the wine into the Blood, which conversion the Catholick Church calls Transubstantiation: I confesse also that under either sole species, all and whole Christ, and a true Sacrament is received.


Sect.
 5. I doe hold there is a Purgatory, and that

Souls therein detained, are holpen by the suffrages of the faithfull. Also, that the Saints reigning with Christ, are to be worshipped and prayed unto, and that they offer prayers to God for us, and that their Relicks are to be worshipped: I most firmly avouch that the Images of Christ, and of the mother of God, always a Virgin, and of other Saints also, are to be had and retained, and that due honor and veneration is to be given them. Also I affirm that the power of Indulgences was left by Christ in the Church, and that the use of them is most wholsome to Christian people.


Sect.
 6. I acknowledge the holy Catholick and Apostolick Roman Church Mother and Mistresse of all Churches, and I promise and swear true obedience to the Bishop of 
Rome,
 successor to St. 
Peter
 Prince of the Apostles, and Vicar of Jesus Christ: I doe like∣wise undoubtedly receive and professe all other things delivered, defined, and declared by the sacred Canons and Councills oecumenicall and particularly by the holy Councill of 
Trent;
 and withall I do con∣demn, reject, and anathematize all things that are contrary thereunto, and all Heresies whatsoever the Church hath condemned, rejected, & anathematized. And I do promise, vow and swear, that I will be care∣full to hold and confesse constantly (with Gods help) this true Catholick Faith, out of which no man can be saved, which at this present I do willingly profess and truly holds; and also as far as I am able, that by those who are under me, or over whom by reason of my charge, I shall have care it be held taught and professed.

A brief Description of the Island of 
Jamaica,
 and a Relation of possessing the Town of St. 
Jago de la Viga,
 with the Routing the Ene∣mies from their Forts and Ordnance, and ta∣king the said Island, 
May 10. 1655.


COncerning 
Jamica
 or 
Jamaica,
 we find these fol∣lowing passages heretofore. In the Navigation of 
Christopher Columbus, cap.
 98. 
Tandem Admirans devenit ad Insulam, quam Insulam Jamicam, &c.
 The Admirall at length came to an Island which the In∣habitants call 
Jamica:
 This Island is as fruitfull as any place near the Sea coasts or within the Land.


In 
Peter Martyr, dec.
 3. 
l.
 9. 
Est his Australior Jamai∣ca, &c. Jamaica
 is a little more Southerly then 
Cuba
 and 
Hispaniola;
 it is a pleasant and fruitfull Island, most happy in the fertility of soil, and it hath but one Mountain, and is most fit for sowing.


And 
Dec.
 1. 
l.
 3. 
Hanc insulam Siciliam longiorem latioremque praedicat:
 It is said that this Island is greater then 
Sicily.


Bartholomeo de las Casas,
 who was a Bishop in those parts, in his Book of the Cruelties of the Spaniards in the Indies, writes thus: The Spaniards went over the Isle of St. 
John
 and to the end of 
Jamaica,
 which were like Gardens for Bees, 1509. setting before them the same end which they had in 
Hispaniola,
 and committing the like robberies and crimes, adjoyning thereunto many great and notable cruelties, killing,





map of the Caribbean, including Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and many smaller islands, and some of the surrounding coastlines (tip of Florida, north coast of South America, and a bit of the east coast of southernmost North America)




burning, rosting, and casting them to the dogs; fur∣thermore, afterwards oppressing and vexing them in their Mineralls and travell, unto the rooting out of those poor innocents, which were in these two Isles by supputation 600000 souls, yea I believe they were then a million.


And Dr. 
Heylin
 in his Description of the American Islands, saith of 
Jamaica,
 It is in length from East to West about 50 leagues, and in breadth 20, the whole compasse estimated at 150. The middle of it under the 18 Degree of Northern latitude: of a rich Soil, abundantly provided of all things necessary, well stocked with cattell, and no lesse plentifully stored with most sorts of fruits, which either industry or na∣ture have supplyed it with; great store of Cotton∣wool, and such a bundance of Jaccu (a Root where∣of the Savages once made their bread) that it was deemed the Granary of the neighboring Islands.


The Island 
Jamaica
 belongeth properly to the Duke of 
Veragus,
 who is lineally descended from 
Christopher Columbus,
 the Discoverer of the Indies, and not to the Duke of 
Medina,
 as was by some con∣ceived.


The chief Ports of this Island are (1) 
Caguaya
 which serves to the Town of St. 
Jago de la Vega,
 or St. 
James
 of the Plains, from whence it is about two leagues distant.


The second Port of any note on that Southside, is 
Esquyvel,
 which is about three leagues distant from the former towards the West, which though the Chan∣nell be, as of the former, difficult to find, is within a commodious Haven; and in respect of an Arm of

the Sea which affords the Commodity of building of Shipping; within it is of singular commodity to the Island. This Arm of the Sea extends it selfe a full league within the Land, where it admits into it a small fresh Brook, called 
Ell Rio de la Puente,
 which arising within two leagues of the Town of St. 
Jago,
 and passing pleasantly through the 
Savanas,
 is recei∣ved by the Arm before described, which is called 
Guavayera.
 The Land between the Town of St. 
Jago
 and this place, is for the most part open, and 
Savana
 land, well stored with cattell and horses. From thence to 
Maccario,
 which is about six leagues distant the Coast, is good and fit for Anchoring; but affords no Port or Harbour nearer then 
Panda Botellio,
 which is a round Mountain, about a league to the West of which, a River called 
Mantinesse
 discharges it selfe into the Sea: This River arises about a league, or a league and halfe with the land, and abounds in fish, and is well stored with cattell, upon the neighbour∣ing 
Hatos,
 and 
Savanas
 of 
Tama
 and 
Guatibacoa.
 Thence passing along this Coast, the next place of goodnesse of Land, or conveniency of Anchoring. And about eight leagues distant from 
Peccaria,
 is 
Punta de la Gostus,
 which is in the Hato of 
Perada,
 which is one of the best and largest pieces of 
Savana
 of the whole Island, it being four leagues in length and more.


From 
Pereda
 to 
Elconde,
 another little Port is five leagues, between which two places falls into the Sea the great River 
Caphana,
 which arising in the Moun∣tains, passes through 
Savanas
 of the same name, well stored with cattell; and leaving the open land about a league from the Sea, runs through wooddy and manguey, or mountainous grounds, and is from the

very 
Savana,
 of depth sufficient for most ordinary Ships, but narrow, as being over grown by the Man∣groves, for want of use or clearing; yet contains in the narrowest about sixty or seventy foot of breadth. At the mouth this River receives into it certain large Brooks of fresh water; but of no other consideration then for fishing onely, whereof it affords a plentifull commodity. The mouth of this River, by reason of the smalnesse of its fall, is barred with the sands, so that unlesse at some times of considerable flouds, it hath not depth above four foot upon the Bar, but without is Anchoring good enough in the open Road, but harbour none at all.


Next about two leagues distant, is 
El Eaido,
 which is a 
Hata,
 having some small 
Savanas,
 but very great plenty of cattell abiding in the Woods, which the Spaniards call 
Ganadus Siniarones,
 or wild cattell, as being not marked, nor belonging to any certaine proprietor, other then the chief Lord and owner of the 
Hato.
 In this 
Hato
 is a small Port called 
Puto del Conde,
 of no great value or consideration.


Thence to 
Punto Negrillio,
 is no other Port or Har∣bour whatsoever; but passing by land, is a 
Hato
 cal∣led 
Cabnico,
 large and well stored with cattell, both wild and tame.


Thence next is called the 
Savana
 of the Sea, which reaches to the Cape 
Negrillio.
 From the 
Puerto de Cuguaya
 towards the East, is the 
Hato de Loguany,
 which is at the East side of the Port it selfe, and pre∣sents to the Harbour a large and well stored 
Savana,
 with an Arm of the Port extending to it, commodi∣ous for the building of Shipping, there being store both of Cedars and other sort of Timber convenient for that purpose.




Next Eastward Land to this of 
Lyguany,
 is 
Lezania,
 a narrow tract of plantable land between the sea and the mountain, containing some small Savanas, but no habitation, nor any Cattell but wild, and is about two leagues in length.


Then is the 
Hato Ayala
 full of tame cattle, and hath much commodity of planting, or erecting of Sugar Engenios of water, by reason of two convenient Ri∣vers which it hath running through, is fit for that purpose; but is dangerously open to the incursion of Pirats, who there have too much commodity of landing in two small Cores or Bighs of Land, the one of which is called 
los Anaones,
 towards the West of this 
Hato,
 and to the East 
la Cruz del Padre.




Severall sorts of Wood in this Country.




1. 
Grandillio,
 of a reddish black colour, and heavy as Ebony, used much in these parts for bedsteads.


2. 
Cedar,
 the best in all the Indies, usefull for all purposes, as Oake in 
England.


3. 
Cawobena,
 a Tree of six fathome about, a fine red, excellent good for beds, tables, or buildings.


4. 
Cittano,
 of a yellow colour, a fathome about, excellent for dying, called in English, yellow Fu∣stick.


5. 
Brasil,
 and 
Brasiletto,
 excellent for dying, sold in these parts at one pound seventeen shillings and six pence 
per
 hundred.


6. 
Guaicum,
 good for bedsteads, bowls and chairs, and Physicians uses, three foot over, sold at 
Cartha∣gena
 for two shillings 
per
 pound.










The Country affords severall Fruits.




1. Pepper smelling like Cloves, the North side of the Island is full of it, wild, good for Chocolatto, sold here at six pence 
per
 pound. The Leaf distilled, makes excellent good water, much esteemed by the Spaniards at 
Carthagena.


2. Pyne, the best that ever was eat, in season al∣most all the year long, sold at six pence 
per
 piece.


3. Nispero, esteemed the best fruit in the Indies by the Spaniards, in season in 
July
 and 
August.


4. Mamesappole, tastes like Marmalet, in season part of 
June, July,
 and 
August.


5. Avocatas, a wholsome pleasant fruit; in sea∣son in 
August,
 sold for eight pence 
per
 piece.


6. Cocao, in great plenty, of which they make Chocolatto, sold ordinarily for three shillings 
per
 bushell.


7. Catrao, a very sweet luscious fruit, green of colour, and much like a Mulberry in shape and bignesse.


8. Limes, Limons, Oranges, Guavers, Bonana's, Plantan's, Papaas, Melons of all sorts, and very good Cucumbers, Gourds, 
&c.
 and the largest Potatoes ever eye beheld.


9. Tobacco, which at 
Carthagena
 bears the best Rate there.


10. Indico.










The substance of divers Letters from the Generalls and Commissioners in the West-Indies to his Highnes, to the effect following.




Aug: 8. 1655.


WE left 
Barbadoes
 the last of 
March,
 and came to St. 
Christophers,
 where we found a Regiment formed, which we received into our company, not staying to anchor. Thence passing forward, we came in sight of 
Sancta Luz, Porto Rico,
 and some other I∣lands, and on ther 3 of 
April
 arived before 
Sancto Do∣mingo,
 part of our forces landing within six miles of the Town, without any opposition, but the main of the Army landed near 40 miles beyond it, contrary to what was intended; which fell out in respect of the absence of the Pilot, who being sent out to dis∣cover, returned not in time. This occasioned a very long march for the Army through Woods and nar∣row Lanes, and all without any guide; which with the heate of the weather, and want of water, put the Army into some weaknesse and distemper, and made them very unfit for service. The Souldiers likewise stragled from their Colours to gather Oranges, Lem∣mons, Pines, 
&c.
 the extraordinary eating whereof put many of them into the Flux, and Feavers. In this condition we advanced near the Town, where our forelorn, being surprised by an Ambush, and their Leader Adjurant Generall 
Jackson
 running away, were put to a retreat by 300 men; and there Major Generall 
Heans
 keeping his ground, was slain. This Ambuscado was afterwards routed by some of the Sea-men, who came up to relieve the Forlorn. 
Iack∣son
 was cashiered for cowardize, and had his sword broken over his head.




After this, the Army retreating for some refresh∣ment, it was thought most convenient by the Officers, and most for the service, to leave that Iland (the Ar∣my being weakned by their aforesaid long march) and to attempt the Iland of 
Iamaica:
 And having shipped the Army, we arived there uppon the 10 of 
May,
 and took the Town of 
St. Iago de la Vega,
 having beat the Enemy from their Forts and Ordnance, who were got together in a body, consisting of about 3000 men. And from this place nothing did divert our first atrempt, but that it had not a name in the world; for we find the Country equall, if not supe∣riour to 
Hispaniola,
 and in four miles march here, we saw more Cattle and Plantations then in fourty in 
Hispaniola,
 and a better aire; and the scituation there∣of much more advantagious to all purposes. We are now getting horses, whereof there are great a∣bundance in the Island to make Troopers and Dra∣goons, to pursue the Enemy, who are fled unto the Woods, and endeavour to get away into the Island of 
Cuba,
 twenty leagues from this; for prevention whereof we have laid some Frigots in the way. The Fleet got safe into the Harbor, which is indeed a very safe and gallant one for riding in all winds. We find here Ebony in great plenty, store of large Cattle, and Timber in abundance for shipping, and some ships on the stocks in building; the Ground very Fertile, and full of brave Plains and Rivers. There is like∣wise great store of Salt-Peter, which some men among us, who are Powder men of 
London,
 doe affirme, may be had as good and as plentifully, as in any place in the world, and in three years time they will under∣take to serve 
England
 with it, woods and Rivers for carriage being easie here, with choice places to erect

Mills. We want onely workme, some of our men are already beginning to Plant.


We lost in 
Hispaniola
 between two and three hun∣dred men by sicknesse and Skirmishes with the ene∣my, and killed in the Woods by the Cow-killers, as they were stragling to gather fruit. The Town where our Army is, is a well built Town of Stone and Brick, above two miles about, and is able to Quarter 20000 men.






Septemb: 23. 1655.


Came the following Intelligence touching Gen: 
Pen,
 Gen: 
Venables,
 and our affairs in the West-Indies.


GEnerall 
Pen
 arrived at the 
Spit
-head near 
Ports∣mouth
 from 
Jamaica,
 with part of the Fleet, the 31 of the last month, having left a very good Squa∣dron behind him in those Seas, and being come as far as the 
Havana
 in the Island of 
Cuba,
 the Ship 
Paragon
 fell on fire by negligence, and so perished in the Sea, blowing up many of the men that were in her. The said Gen: 
Pen
 is not yet come to 
London,
 but hath sent hither Letters which he brought from Gen: 
Venables.
 There are 20 sail returned, and 13 left behind: And that notwithstanding some discouragements at first in that part of the world, yet now our men are well accommodated, and doubt not but to bring good ad∣vantage to the Commonwealth by their Expedition.






The Letter from Gen: 
Venables
 to a person of Honour.


Honourable Sir,


SInce my last of the sixth of this instant, we have taken some prisoners of the enemy; the rest con∣tinue in the Mountains, wanting houses, bread, 
&c.


willing to submit, if not overawed by a few amongst them, yet we hope to make them good Subjects, most of them being 
Portugais,
 and shall endeavour to gaine them by our civility. That which we most want for the present, is bread and Bandry, there being not much 
Casava
 in the Country, and of that the enemies steal a share, but we shall be planting more of that, and hope our Friends will give us a supply assoon as may be. There be some considerations and expedi∣ents which will be sent into 
England,
 not yet fully re∣solved upon; and I am not able now to enlarge, ha∣ving quite spent my spirits; but this Island 
Jamaica,
 for Commodities, Aire, 
&c.
 and in scituation for other purposes, exceedeth 
Hispaniola,
 in the judge∣ment of,


Sir,
 
your very obliged Servant,
 ROB: VENABLES.






Here followeth another Letter from the Fleet in 
Jamaica
 Harbour, concerning our Affairs in the West-Indies.


June 25. 1656.


IN the last to you dated the 12 of 
March,
 by the conveyance of the 
Grantham,
 we intimated the de∣parture of some Frigats for the Maine, which since returned with Intelligence onely of 7 ships in the Harbour of 
Carthagene.
 A few dayes after, A Council of War was called, and it was thought expedient to move upon some designe for the advantage of the Commonwealth rather than lie still in Harbour. In order to which, eleven of the best sailing Frigats in the Fleet were chosen out for the effecting of our purpose (the Admiral himself to command in chief.)

The Port we were bound for, proved to be 
Rio de la Hache,
 a Town about 30 Leagues to the Eastward of 
Sancta Martha.
 We landed 500 Seamen a mile West∣ward of the Town, where they saluted us from the Fort standing to the Eastward with three great shot, but did no execution; whereupon we marched boldly forward, and by the advantage of some houses near adjoyning, we got thither, and played our small shot into the Fort so fast, that they soon deserted their great Gunns, and begged for Quarter, which was presently granted; the Fort was 19 foot high, with a Brest-work on the top, and 4 brasse Guns mounted: The Inhabitants had sent away all their Goods by their Negroes upon their first espiall of us, which was 5 hours before we landed. We stayed there 3 or 4 days, and sent severall Parties up into the Country in quest of the Enemy, but took none save one Frier, and some Spanish women and Ne∣groes. In the mean time, severall came down with Flags of Truce, and gave us notice, that the Gover∣nour of the place would come and compound for them▪ but they failed at the prefixed time; where∣fore Orders were given for carrying aboard the Spa∣nish prisoners (women excepted) and the Town to be immediately fired, and our Forces drawn off.


After all matters were dispatched here, we set sail to 
Sancta Martha
 to review our former spoiles. We drew out the same party, and went on shore, no Ene∣my opposing, most persons of Quality being fled to 
Carthagene
 for security. We soon left the place after we had watered; and espying a Saile at Sea, in few hours we came up with her, and found her to be a Spanish Prize laden with Oyle, Olives, Wine, Stuffs, to a good value.




Then we moved towards 
Carthagene
 to shew our selves; we lay there one day, and then 8 of the Fleet departed for 
Jamaica,
 leaving three of us behind in our former station, 6 leagues Eastward of 
Carthagene.
 In their way they chased another Ship laden with Cocoes, and took her, and have sent the Fruit to the Lord Protector: it is good to make Chocolette, which is a great Drink in these Countries.


We that were behind after the rest of the Fleet, two Evenings together near Sun-set, made another Saile; but night approaching, we lost sight of her, and the next day saw her at Anchor under 
Carthagene
 wall. We attempted to bring our Ships near her; but they discovering our intents, haled her ashore, cutting their Cables; so that we being Ships of great burthen, had not depth of Water, besides the danger of the Forts. We gave the Town a strong Alarm, coming within shot, but they fired no Guns. So we left our chase, and with the advantage of a Westerly wind (which is not usuall here) we got up as high as 
Sancta Martha,
 and so stood over for 
Jamaica,
 leaving the other two Ships behind, where they chased another Vessell into the shore, which suffered shipwrack there, laden with Tobacco, Hides, and Cocoes.


Severall Gentlemen from the Governour of 
Mevis
 have been here to view this Island of 
Jamaica,
 in or∣der to their Transplanting, who approve of the Ground very well, and are upon their Return with three of the States ships, to fetch the Governor, and their Families, and Estates.

battle between sailing ships






The Letter of Capt: 
Stayner,
 Commander of the Speaker Frigat, to Gen. 
Blake,
 and Gen. 
Montagu.


Right Honorable,


AFter my service presented to your Honors, these are to acquaint you, that upon the 8 instant at night it blew hard Westerly, by means whereof we

with our Squadrons (onely the 
Providence
 was gone to water) weighed out of the Bay of 
Cadiz
 and plyed to Sea; in the evening we espied eight Sail some five or six leagues to the Westwards of 
Cadiz,
 we using the best means we could to meet with them the next day, which we did. It being little wind at N.E it was nine of the clock before we came up with them, but having a fresh gale in the night, all but we and the 
Bridgwater
 were to the Leeward, and could not come to us. But when we came to the Fleet, it proved to be the Spanish Fleet come from the West-Indies, which were four of the King of 
Spains,
 three Mer∣chant-men, and one Prize which they had taken by way of the Western Islands being a Portugall, which were eight in all: We engaged the Fleet, but being within four leagues of 
Cadiz,
 could not stay for our ships, but we, the 
Bridgwater,
 and 
Plymouth,
 engaged them, and had a sharp dispute some of us; but the Admirall being the smallest ship, we sleighted her, for we conceived there was some Pollicy used in the Flag, by which means their Admiral and the 
Portugall
 Prize got into 
Cadiz;
 the Vice-Admirall and one more we sunk, and burnt two: We took one, the Captain of her, which we have on board, saith she hath in her two Millions of silver; the Vice-Admi∣rall had as much, I doe believe. The 
Plimouth
 chased another, who ran ashore between S. 
Peters
 and 
Cape Degar,
 but it seems by the prisoners information she had no silver in her; the ship we took was as good as all the Fleet besides: the other that Captain 
Harman
 hath taken is very rich, but little silver in her. Both the Prize and our ship are sorely wounded both in Mast and Hull. The Commanders advise me not to take the silver out of her, I doe intend to take further

advice about it; there is no News, onely the Fleet I believe will follow us. The Gallies came out be∣cause of the riches and disability of our ships: we will come towards you except your Honours send further orders, for we are in no capacity to stay here. I shall leave two or three of the best sayling ships off the Cape, and I and the rest will come to 
Lisbone,
 where I hope to find your Honours. There is the 
Nova Spaniola
 Fleet at the 
Havana,
 but when they will come home is not known. This is all, onely there is losse of men in some ships, the number I know not. I am,


Your Honors most humble Servant,
 Ric: Stayner.


From on board the
 Speaker, 
in haste,
 
Sept. 9. 1656.






The Letter of Gen. 
Blake,
 and Gen. 
Montagu
 to his Highnesse the Lord Protector.


May it please your Highnesse.


BEing out of water, and our Victualls almost spent, and having not heard from your Highnesse, since the receipt of your commands by the Griffin, we found it requisite to saile for this place, with the grea∣test part of the Fleet, as well to recruite our wants, as to be in a way of further order. Accordingly we arrived here on the 11 instant, and the 17 following in the night received the enclosed Account from the Commander of the Squadron left before 
Cadiz,
 which we humbly present to your Highnesse; ho∣ping we shall be shortly able to informe your High∣nesse more particularly thereof, having sent out what Frigots we could, as well to reinforce the Guard

before 
Cadiz,
 as to secure the Prizes hither to us. In the mean time, the Providences that have come to our knowledge concurring to bring these ships into our hands, doe very much convince us it is of God in more than an ordinary manner; and we trust it will by the same good hand be sanctified unto us. We humbly take leave and remain,


Your Highnes very faithful and obedient Servants,
 Robert Blake. E: Mountagu.


From on board the
 Naseby 
in the Bay of
 Wyers, 
Sept. 19. 1656.






An Account touching the great Destruction befallen the 
Spaniards
 in the West-Indies.


THE eldest son of the Marquesse of 
Badex
 (who was taken prisoner by our Fleet in the Spanish Vice-Admirall, as they came with their Silver from the West-Indies) being examined, saith upon his Examination: That above five months since, pre∣sently after his Father and Family departed out of 
Lima
 in 
Peru,
 there hapned a fearfull Earthquake and most miraculous Raine of fire from heaven in 
Peru,
 insomnch that the whole City of 
Lima
 is swallowed up and destroyed, and also the City of 
Calao;
 in which places there perished above twelve thousand Spaniards, and (to see the great distinguishing hand of God) not above one hundred Indians with them. In that City also, 
viz. Lima,
 the King of 
Spain
 hath lost by the Earthquake, one hundred Millions of Silver ready wrought up. Moreover, the famous

Mines and Mountains of 
Potosi
 (out of which they digged their Silver) are destroyed in a wonderfull manner, so that there is no more of Hills to be seen, but all plaine, nor is there any further possibility of having Gold or Silver in 
Peru.
 Some of the Spanish themselves doe acknowledge, that this desolation and destruction hath befaln the Spaniards for the Cruelties by them acted upon the poor Indians, they not sparing even those Indians among them who professed the Roman Catholick Religion, insomuch that the miserable Creatures being beyond measure oppressed, and grieved with their sufferings, cryed to Heaven for vengeance against them. Never was there a more terible visible hand of God in judgment upon any people since the time of 
Sodome
 and 
Gomor∣rah.
 Great is the Lord, marvellous are his doings, and to be had in reverence of all the Nations round about.






Here followeth the Narrative of the great Successe given by God to a few of our Ships against the King of 
Spains
 West-India Fleet.


SEven Ships in the service of the King of 
Spain
 (being four of the Kings own Fleet, and three Merchants) coming from the West Indies, most of them richly laden with Gold Silver, Pearl, and other Commodities, 
viz.
 The Admirall, 
Don Marquesse Del porto
 Generall; The vice Admirall a Gallion, 
Don Francisco De Esquevel
 Commander; The Rere Admirall a Gallion, 
Don Francisco Del Hayo
 Comman∣der, a ship commanded by Captaine 
John Rhodrignes Caldron,
 a ship Commanded by Capt. 
John De la Tour,


another small man of war, and a Vessell of Advice from the 
Vice Roy
 of 
Mexico
 to 
Spain:
 They did in fifty eight days proceed so far as within a few leagues of 
Cadiz,
 without making Land or touching at any place during the voyage, having in their way betwixt the Western Islands and 
Massagam
 in 
Affrick,
 seized upon a small 
Portugall
 as Prize, by whom receiving a false information, that the 
Spaniards
 had beaten the 
English
 Fleet from off their Coast, a month before; they sayled with much confidence towards 
Cadiz
 as not expecting opposition.


The greatest part of the 
English
 Fleet, were at this time gone to the Bay of 
Wyers
 in 
Portugall
 (where they arrived the eleventh of 
September
 last) to recruit their wants, and to be in a way of further Orders, the Generalls leaving behind them a Squadron of six or seven Ships (to have an eye upon 
Cadiz
) under the command of Captain 
Stayner,
 Captain of the 
Speaker
 Frigot: which Squadron on the eight of 
September
 last, plying to Sea, being forced thither by a strong Westerly winde, did at the evening of the day Discover the said Spanish Fleet, five or six Leagues to the Westward of 
Cadiz;
 And the ap∣proach of the night denying opportunity of present action, they endeavoured to fall in with them the next day, which accordingly they did about nine of the clock in the morning (they seeming to the Spa∣niards to be Fisher-boats) But there being a fresh Gale that night, all but three of the Squadron were to the Leeward, and could not presently come in, and finding it to be the Spanish Fleet come from the Indies, the 
Speaker,
 the 
Bridgwater,
 and the 
Plymouth
 Frigots (not thinking it adviseable to stay for the rest of the squadron, they being within 4 leagues of 
Cadiz
)

engaged with the Fleet, and a sharp dispute there was betwixt them: The Admirall being a small ship, and it being conceived that the placing of the Flag upon her, might be in pollicy to divert them from attending the Ships of better value, they sligh∣ted her, and suffered her (with the 
Portugall
 Prize) to go into 
Cadiz
 Bay, where (its said) she was run on shore and sunk, being reported to have in her Six hun∣dred thousand pieces of Eight: The Vice Admirall (being reported to have Six hundred thousand pieces of Eight; besides in Jewells and Plate, upon the ac∣compt of the Marquesse of 
Badex,
 to the value of five hundred thousand pieces of Eight) having fought six hours, was taken by our Ships, and after set on fire by the Spaniards themselves, and so burnt down, and snnk, in her were destroyed one hundred and ten men, the principallest of whom was the Marquesse of 
Badex,
 who with his wife and eldest daughter were burnt: The Rear Admirall was taken and remains in our possession: The ship under the command of Captain 
John Rodrignes Caldron,
 which was said to have in her Sugar, Tobacco and Plate, to the value of Six hundred thousand pieces of Eight, was taken, and in the bringing off was by an accidentall fire burnt and sunk: The ship under the command of 
De La Tour,
 twelve thousand West India Hides, and some quantities of Sugar, is taken and in our posses∣sion: The small Man of War (having in her the like lading with the last mentioned) and the Advice Vessell being of no force or lading, are said to escape into 
Gibralter.


The value of what is taken and possessed, is not justly known; but by the Calculation of the Spani∣ards there are taken and lost about Nine Millions of

pieces of Eight: besides the said Ships and their La∣ding, there are many prisoners taken, three hundred and fifty being found in the Rear Admiral, and about Ninety saved out of the Vice Admirall, amongst whom there are the Eldest Son, a younger son, and two daughters of the said Marquess of 
Badex,
 as also 
Don Diego De Villa Alva,
 the Governour of the 
Havana,
 and severall others of quality, and Merchants.


And all this was done without the losse of one Vessell of the 
English,
 so it pleased the wisdome of God, to chuse to effect so great a work, by a little force: As also by suffering the Enemy to be foolish∣ly ensnared into a presumptious confidence, by an Enemies information, on which they so relyed, that they neglected the haling of a Vessell which came from St. 
Lucaz,
 and might have informed them of the truth.


By this 
Narrative
 we see that the Lord whose right hand hath been heret ofore so glorious in power, for the help of his poor people in these Nations, in the time of their saddest dangers, when their Enemies at home expected to have satisfied their Lusts in their ruine, hath again appeared on their behalfe in this day of their need by blowing with his winds, and causing the Sea to cover their Enemies abroad, so that they have sunk as Lead into the mighty waters, which gives abundant cause to say, 
who is like unto the Lord,
 for he hath triumphed Gloriously; and as the Eminency of this Mercy, in weakning the com∣mon Enemy of Religion (the King of 
Spain,
 with whom this Commonwealth is engaged in a just and necessary war) and in encouraging and strengthning the hands of his Servants, in a vigorous prosecution of that engagement, is much heightned by the freenes of
