THE PUBLISHERS TO THE READER.


T
Hat nothing is at once brought forth and perfe∣cted, is an observation we may make, as from other things, so in a more espe∣cial manner from 
Arts
 and 
Sciences:
 but not to speak of all, which yet have had, in Succession of time, their Accessions to perfection; we shall in∣stance only in these of 
Astronomy
 and 
Geography.
 And certain it is, should we either seriously compare the Works of the 
Antients,
 with the more accurate ob∣servations and additions of our modern 
Astronomers;
 what just cause would ap∣pear, for that correction and alteration which is now made? And should we com∣pare

 the 
Geographical Tables
 or 
Charts
 of the 
Antients,
 with the more perfect disco∣veries of our later times; what defects and errours shall we there discover? We hope therefore you will not think strange, because we have so much dissented in our 
Globes, Maps,
 &c. from those that now only are accounted excellent: for as we cannot consent to copy those errours and abuses which the 
Dutch
 would impose upon the whole world, so we cannot al∣together pass by our 
English Map-makers
 without censuring them for reasons which we might, and the less curious may by their own Works themselves perceive. But as we well know no Art is at once perfected, so we well know there are abroad in the world many Books and Instruments con∣ducing to the improvement of the 
Ma∣thematicks,
 whereof some are superstuous, others burdensome. The consideration whereof was prevalent enough to have clouded this under the opace darkness of 
Latencie,
 had it not been drawn upon the 
Horizon
 of publick view, by two ir∣resistable 
Magnets.


The time and season of its undertaking was to us too disadvantagious to the ren∣dring a Work of this Nature so compleat,

 and in such good order as was requisite; being necessarily forced and confined to our daily Employment, so that we could never have Effected it, had not Mr. 
Ley∣bourn,
 knowing our occasions, willing∣ly assented to Calculate and Methodize all the 
Problems
 for us; which Favour we cannot but thankfully acknowledge and confess. As for the Subject of this 
Trea∣tise,
 it being 
Astronomy
 and 
Geogra∣phy,
 needs no Commendation where there are noble Men, or noble Mindes.


All therefore we shall say of 
Astronomy
 is, that, 'tis of such important conse∣quence, that without the knowledge and science thereof, how great incertainty in times and seasons, what distracting confusion in humane affairs must we neces∣sarily be involved in? And for 
Geo∣graphy,
 all that need to be spoken of it is, that 'tis so noble a Study, and of such grand importance, as Kings and Princes have made it their highest concern to un∣derstand. Wherefore that the one might be the more easily apprehended, and the other most truly represented to our view and fan∣cie, the 
Antients,
 with the consent of suc∣ceeding Ages, have with much pains and industry, not only invented, but also com∣mended

 to Posterity the 
Sphere
 or 
Globe,
 which also have had their Corrections and Admendments. And here we must say something of those 
New Globes
 lately set forth by our selves.


True it is, we might boast of the help and assistance of the ablest 
Mathematiti∣ans,
 not only in 
England
 and 
Holland,
 but in other parts also; yet sure we are, that after many years experience, not on∣ly in the making and projecting of 
Globes, Maps,
 &c. but also in examining and comparing of the Descriptions, Discove∣ries, Drafts, Journals, Observations, and Writings, as well of 
Antient
 as 
Modern Geographers, Astronomers, Seamen,
 and others, wherein we have spared no pains or cost, that we might deliver the delinea∣tions of the Earth from the 
Ataxie
 and confusion of former 
Globes
 and 
Maps.
 We say, although 'tis impossible we should e∣mit and set them forth in that exactness and perfection they ought, and we could wish; yet doubtless we have and shall ex∣pose both 
Globes, Spheres, Maps,
 &c. more accurate and compleat than some tristing Toys, as well Forrain as Native; which have been sold at great rates by o∣thers, and that with much Ostentation and

 Boasting; to the abuse of some Gentlemen, perhaps better stored with Money, than Knowledge or Judgement in such things. As for the excellencie of the 
Globe
 or 
Sphere,
 all we shall say is, that they have the 
Priority
 in Nature of all other Instru∣ments, as most fit and convenient to the Ʋnderstanding and Fancie; not to speak any thing of them as they analogically represent the Heavens and the Earth in proper genuine Figures: for, that the Hea∣vens are round, is not doubted by any; and for the form of the Earth, the Opi∣nion of its rotundity is now generally known and received.


Our only Request therefore is, that if (in so great a Circumference as we have run) some Lines be not truly drawn from the 
Centre,
 that they may not draw an 
Ob∣lique Censure
 from the Reader, but rather thy Animadversion and Pardon for

What a 
Sphere
 is.


A
 
Sphere (omitting the Geome∣trical denomination) in rela∣tion to my present purpose, I define to be,
 An Analogical representation of the Heavens and of the Earth, made of se∣veral Circles so fitted together, as thereby the better to express and represent to the Fancie the Systeme or Hypothesis of the Visible World. 
Of which there are chiefly three sorts invented;
 viz. 
the
 Ptolomean, Coperni∣can, 
and
 Tychonian.




A Description of the 
Ptolomean
 Sphere.


This Systeme (which was so called from 
Ptolomy
 the Prince of Astronomers, being indeed the very Founder of that Art and Science) supposeth the Earth to be fixed in the Centre immoveable, and that all the Celestial Bodies do move round that in their Diurnal and Annual revolutions. This Sphere

 or Systeme of the World the Ancients divided in∣to two Parts or Regions; 
Elemental,
 and 
Celestial.
 The first consisteth of four Parts: 1. The Earth. 2. The Water. Which together maketh one per∣fect Body. And above these, are the other two E∣lements, 
viz.
 3. the Air; and above that, 4. the Fire. The second consisteth of many parts, 
viz.
 1. The 
Moon.
 2. 
Mercury.
 3. 
Venus.
 4. The 
Sun.
 5. 
Mars.
 6. 
Jupiter.
 7. 
Saturn.
 8. The Orb or Sphere of the 
Starry Heaven:
 all which Orbs or Circles are imagined to be carried about upon the 
Axis
 of the World, by the rapture of the 
Primum Mobile,
 as is represented by this Figure.




Of the several Motions of the Planets.


Besides the Diurnal motion by which the Planets are carried round about from East to West in 24 hours by the rapture of the 
Primum Mobile
 upon the Poles of the World, they have also a free and proper motion of their own, from West to East, according to the succession of the Signes up∣on the Poles of the Ecliptick, each of them in a several manner and space of time: 
viz.
 The 
Moon,
 which is the lowest of the Planets, makes her Re∣volution in 29 days and 8 hours. The next is 
Mercury,
 who is never far distant from the 
Sun,
 and finisheth his motion in 88 days. Then 
Venus,
 which in her preceding the 
Sun
 is called 
Lucifer,
 but in her following the 
Sun
 is called 
The Evening Star,
 finisheth her revolution in 225 days. Next the 
Sun,
 who performeth his revolution in the space of a year, 
viz.
 365 days, and about 6 hours. The next is 
Mars,
 who finisheth his course in one

 year, and 321 days. Then 
Jupiter,
 who maketh his revolution in 11 years, 10 months, and 16 days. Lastly, 
Saturn
 the highest of all the Planets, and therefore goeth the greatest circuit, finisheth his periodical course in 29 years, 5 months, 15 days. Now all these Orbs in our large 
Ptolomean
 Spheres are placed upon the Poles of the Ecliptick, the better to correspond with their real places, and de∣monstrate their true motions in the Heavens.






Fol. 2.


small insert between pages with illustration of the Ptolemaic system


Ptolomean Sphere












A description of the 
Copernican
 Sphere.


This Hypothesis is now known to the world by this name from 
Copernicus
 a 
Borussian,
 and Canon of the Cathedral Church of 
Worms,
 who seriously addressing himself to the illustration of Astronomy, revived the long-neglected Systeme of the World excogitated by 
Pythagoras,
 a Figure whereof is here inserted




Of the Motion of the Planets.


In this Systeme the rest of the Planets are mo∣
ed round the 
Sun,
 which is the Centre of the whole Universe, from whence he may the more equally communicate and distribute both light and heat to the rest of the opacous Planetary Bodies encircling him. The first next the 
Sun
 is 
Mercu∣ry,
 who finishes his Circuit about the 
Sun
 in 88 days. The next is 
Venus,
 who moveth round the 
Sun
 in 225 days. Next is the 
Earth,
 which is sup∣posed to move with a double Motion: one about its own Centre, upon the Pole of the Equinoxial, from West to East, in 24 hours; whereby all its

 parts are alternately enlightned, and Day & Night successively enjoyed: the other Motion is made upon the Poles of the Zodiack or Ecliptick, in the space of a year; whereby all places by course enjoy Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. The 
Earth
 is encompassed with a Circle which doth not include the 
Sun,
 representing the Orb of the 
Moon,
 who in 29 days and a half finisheth her pe∣riod round the 
Earth.
 The next is 
Mars,
 who is moved above the 
Earth
 and 
Moon,
 and ends his course round the 
Sun
 in the space of one year and 320 days, or thereabouts; and appears far greater when he is in Opposition of the 
Sun,
 than he doth at other times; at which time he is five times nearer the 
Earth,
 than he is in his greatest remo∣tion. The next is 
Jupiter,
 who with his four companions moveth above 
Mars,
 and is about 12 years encompassing his period round the 
Sun.
 The seventh is 
Saturn,
 who with his Ring and 
Moons
 is about 30 years in finishing his revolution round the 
Sun.
 And lastly, the Sphere of the 
Fixed Stars,
 which with their several distances encircle all the Planetary Orbs immoveable, and to us incommen∣surable.


I shall not now need plead for the truth of this Systeme, nor speak much of its excellencie: onely this, That hereby is taken away that incredible daily motion of the Planets, and vast Orb of the fixed Stars; which are, if the Antients Supputa∣tion should be true, many hundred times swifter than the Shot out of any Gun: for the motion of the 
Sun
 in one hour must be 785715 English miles, and in one minute 13095 miles more; and the fi∣xed Stars must move in an hour 135 13686 Eng∣lish

 miles, and in one minute 225228 miles. And also hereby is annihilated all those Epicycles which the old Astronomers blindly tyed to the motion of the 
Sun;
 and all those Eccentricks, Differents, and Equants, with the Circles of Inclination, Devia∣tion, and Reflexion. This Hypothesis, without any absurdity or perplexity of fictitious Orbs, or impertinent motions, exactly solves all the variety of appearances in the Heavens.






Fol. 3.


small insert between pages with illustration of the Copernican system


pernican Sphere












A description of the 
Tyohonian
 Sphere.


This Hypothesis derives its name from that No∣ble 
Dane, Tycho Brahe
 who with an Heroical Bra∣very enterprised no less than the Instauration of the whole Science of Astronomy from its very Fun∣damentals; laying such solid Foundations, as that he came very neer the height of his noble hopes of building the whole Theory of Astronomy anew: but being prevented by death, he could not accom∣plish his noble Designe. He, I say, excogitated this Hypothesis; which all those that cannot al∣low of the 
Pholomaick,
 nor adhere to the 
Coperni∣can,
 may accept and approve of: wherein he makes the 
Earth
 the Centre to the 
Sun, Moon
 and 
Stars,
 which also have their motion round the 
Earth;
 but the rest of the Planets to move round the 
Sun
 as their Centre: 
Saturn
 in opposition to the 
Sun
 to be neerer to the 
Earth
 than 
Venus
 in her 
Apogae∣um,
 and 
Mars
 in opposition is neerer to the 
Earth
 than the 
Sun
 it self; as may be seen by the Fi∣gure.


But for a further illustration, or satisfaction to the more Curious, I shall commend them to a sight of

 those New Spheres lately set forth by the Publishers of this Book, being more exactly and accurately made and contrived than those formerly done, and will be procured at a more reasonable rate; and in operation may be applied to Practical uses, as the Globe is.








What a 
Globe
 is.


A Globe is an Artificial representation of the 
Starry-Heaven,
 or the 
Earth
 and 
Water,
 un∣der the form and figure of Roundness which they are supposed to have; shewing, in a just proportion and distance, every particular Constellation in the 
Heavens,
 and each several Region or Country on the 
Earth.




Of the 
Poles.


A Globe hath two Poles: the one is called the 
Arctick,
 or North-Pole; the other the 
Antarctick,
 or South-Pole; representing the Poles of the World.






Of the 
Axis.


From the Centre of the Globe is imagined a line thorow both Poles, which is called the 
Axis
 of the world, and is represented by the two Wyers in the Poles of the Globe.








Of the
 Brazen Meridian.


Every Globe is hung by the 
Axis
 at both the Poles in a Brazen Meridian, which is divided into 360 Degrees, or four times 90 equal parts. The reason why this Circle is thus divided into four Nineties, is because the Elevation of the Pole, or Latitude of the place, cannot be above 90 de∣grees.






small insert between pages with illustration of a globe










Of the
 Hour-circle, 
and
 Index.


Upon every Meridian is fitted a small Brass-cir∣cle, whose centre is the Pole of the Globe, and is divided into 24 equal parts, representing the hours of the Day and Night; which in the revolution of the Globe is pointed to with an Index, which is fitted on the 
Axis
 of the the Globe.






Of the
 Quadrant 
of
 Altitude.


There is also another appendant relating to the Meridian, called 
The Quadrant of Altitude;
 which is a thin Brass-plate divided into 90 equal parts or degrees, and fitted with a Nut and a Screw, to move to any degree upon the Meridian.






Of the 
Horizon.


Besides the body of the Globe, there is also an∣nexed a certain Frame of wood, which is called the 
Horizon;
 in the upper Plane whereof are several Circles delineated. The first or inner Circle is

 divided into equal Parts or Signes; every Signe having its name, nature and character placed to it; and every Signe subdivided into 30 equal parts cal∣led 
Degrees,
 and numbered with 10 20 30. Next to the Circle of Signes is a Kalendar or Al∣manack according to the Old Stile used by us here in 
England,
 called the 
Julian;
 which is divided into the 12 Months of the year, 
viz. January, Fe∣bruary,
 &c. to 
December;
 every Month being sub∣divided into its number of days: whereunto is annexed the Festival days. Next is a Kalendar of the New Stile, now used in many forreign places, instituted by Pope 
Gregory
 the 13; in which the Months begin 10 days sooner than they do in the other. The last is a Circle of the Winds, divided into 32 equal parts, called 
Points of the Compass,
 according to the number of Winds which are ob∣served by our modern Navigators; by which they designe forth the Quarters of the Heavens, and the Coasts and Bearings of Countries.








Of the
 Coelestial Globe.


THe 
Starry Heaven,
 that glorious Canopie em∣broidered with those sparkling Diamonds which hang upon the duskie cheeks of the Night, as a rich Jewel in an 
Aethiops
 ear, is represented unto us by the Celestial Globe, because upon its convexity are artificially placed all the Stars and other appearances, in that order and place as they are naturally situate in the concavity of that Orb or Heaven.






Of the Lines, Circles, 
&c.
 upon the 
Coelestial Globe.




And first, 
Of the
 Aequinoxial.


This is a great Line encircling the Globe, equal∣ly distant from both the Poles, and is divided into 360 equal parts or degrees: it is the same Line with the AEquator upon the Terrestrial Globe; one∣ly that remains fixed and unmoveable, this varia∣ble or at least must be imagined to move in the Heavens.






Fol. 5


small insert between pages with illustration of the Tychonic system


Tyconian Sphere










Of the
 Motion 
of the
 Aequinoxial.


For one of these two must needs be granted; either the Motion of the Eighth Sphere, or Starry Orb, from West to East upon the Poles and 
Axis
 of the Ecliptick; or else the progress of the Equino∣xial points into the precedent Signes. Now that the first is not to be admitted, appears manifestly, because that the Fixed Stars have not at all chan∣ged their situation in respect of Latitude: There∣fore the other must needs be granted, 
viz.
 the Mo∣tion of the Equinoxial. Hence it comes to pass, that the Stars being fixed in their own Orb, move not, but are by the precession of the Equinox left behinde the Equinoxial Colure; and so alter their Longitudes. For the first Star of 
Aries,
 which in the time of 
Meton
 the 
Athenian
 (who lived about

 431 years before Christ's time) was in the very 
Vernal
 Intersection; in the year 1572, when 
Ty∣cho
 observed it, was found to be in 27 
deg.
 37 
min.
 of 
Aries;
 and will, according to his Opinion, fi∣nish its revolution in 25412 years.






Of the 
Ecliptick.


The Equinoxial is crossed or cut in two oppo∣site points by an oblique Circle, called the 
Ecliptick;
 which divides the Globe into two equal parts, cal∣led 
Hemispheres;
 the one the Northern, the other the Southern. This Circle is divided into 12 e∣qual parts, which are called the 12 
Signes;
 every part being marked with the Figure, Character, and Name of the Signe belonging to it: and each of these Signes is divided into 30 equal parts called 
Degrees.
 Under this Circle the 
Sun
 and the rest of the Planets finish their several Courses. It is called 
Via Solis,
 because the 
Sun
 always goes under it in its annual course: but the rest of the Planets have all of them their latitudes and deviations from this Line; by reason of which their digressi∣ons and extravagancies, the Ancients assigned the Ecliptick 12 degrees of Latitude: but modern A∣stronomers, by reason of the evagations of 
Mars
 and 
Venus,
 have added to each side two degrees more; so that the whole Latitude is confined to 16 degrees: which bredth is also called by some the 
Zodiack.






Of the 
Poles
 of the 
Ecliptick.


As all the Meridians described upon the Globe

 meet in the Poles of the World; so all the Circles of Longitude being drawn thorow the 12 Signes, meet in the Poles of the Ecliptick; each Pole of the Ecliptick being distant from its correspondent Pole of the World 23 
deg.
 30 
min.
 the one is cal∣led the 
North-pole,
 the other the 
South,
 according to their position next the North or South-poles of the world.






Of the 
Colures.


The Colures are two great Circles cutting one another at Right-angles in the Poles of the World, the one passing by the beginning of 
Aries
 and 
Li∣bra,
 two Equinoxial-signes, and is therefore called the 
Equinoxial-Colure;
 the other passing thorow 
Cancer
 and 
Capricorn,
 two Solstitial-signes, and is therefore called the 
Solstitial Colure.
 This passeth thorow the Poles of the World, and also of the Ecliptick; but the other passeth thorow the Poles of the World onely. The Colures divide the E∣cliptick into four equal parts; 
viz.
 into 
Aries, Can∣cer, Libra,
 and 
Capricorn;
 which are called the 
Cardinal points:
 for according to the 
Suns
 ap∣proach unto any of them, the Season of the year is altered into 
Spring, Summer, Autumn,
 and 
Win∣ter.






Of the 
Tropicks.


Parallel to the Equinoxial, there are two small Circles, which are called the 
Tropicks,
 and are 23 
deg.
 and a half distant from the Equinoxial, and are the bounds of the Ecliptick. That on the

 North-side of the Ecliptick is called 
The Tropick of Cancer,
 where the Sun hath the greatest North-declination, and makes our longest day and shortest night; which is about the 11 or 12 of 
June.
 The other, on the South-side of the Equinoxial, is called 
The Tropick of Capricorn;
 in which point the Sun hath its greatest Southern declination, ma∣king our shortest day; and longest night; which is about the 11 or 12 of 
December.






Of the 
Arctick
 and 
Antarctick
 Circles.


Twenty three degrees and a half from either Pole, are described two small Circles: that neer the North-pole is called 
The Arctick Circle,
 the other in the South is called 
The Antarctick Circle.






Of the 
Number
 of the 
Stars.


Encircling the Terrestrial Orb at unmeasurable distance, sparkle the innumerable Lights or Stars in the immense Expansion of the Firmament. And although the Number of them for multitude seems innumerable, yet the greatest and more visible may be numbered and named. The Number that A∣stronomers have at present taken notice of, is a∣bout 1400; which we have inserted in our New Celestial Globe, according to their Right Ascensi∣ons and Declinations, and are sufficient for any use or purpose whatsoever.






Of the 
Magnitudes
 of the 
Stars.


For the better distinction of the bigness of the

 Stars, they are divided into 6 degrees of Magni∣tude. The biggest and brightest are called 
Stars of the first Magnitude;
 those next inferiour in bigness and brightness are called 
Stars of the se∣cond Magnitude:
 and so the Stars gradually de∣crease to the sixth Magnitude, which is the smal∣lest, except some few, which are called 
occult,
 or 
nebulose.
 And these several Magnitudes are ex∣pressed on the Globe in several shapes, as may be seen in a small Table placed for that purpose on our Celestial Globe.






Of the 
Images
 or 
Constellations
 described upon the Coelestial Globe.


Astronomers desirous to bring the Stars into Order and Method, have reduced many Stars into one Constellation, the better to tell where to seek them; and being found, how to express them. The number of Constellations now drawn upon the Globe are 64: 
viz.


In the Northern Hemisphere,

To these is lately added, by Sir 
Charles Scarbo∣rough,
 a Constellation called 
Cor Caroli Regis,
 figu∣red with a Crowned Heart; being a very conside∣rable and notable Star of the second Magnitude, and unformed, lying between 
Ʋrsa major
 and 
Co∣ma Berenices:
 and 'tis well worthy the observation and notice of the more Curious.






Of the
 Via Lactea, 
or
 Milkie way.


This is a broad White Circle that is seen in the Heavens, and is described between two tracts of small pricks running through several Constellati∣ons

 round the Globe. It is caused by a great number of little Stars constipated in that part of Heaven so small and thick, that we can perceive nothing but a confused light. About the Southern Pole are also discovered two white spots, seeming to be onely two white Clouds, being a pale assem∣bly of very small Stars, as in the 
Galaxy
 or Milkie way; which are more clearly discovered by the 
Te∣lescope,
 otherwise inconspicuous to our eyes.










An Explanation of several words of Art.




And first, 
Of
 Azimuths.


AZimuths,
 or Vertical Circle
, are great Circles passing through the 
Zenith
 and 
Nadir:
 and as the Meridians cut the Equinoxial at Right-an∣gles, so the Azimuths cut the Horizon at Right-angles; and are numbered by degrees from the East to the West-point, towards the North and South in the Horizon.






Almicanters.


These are Circles parallel to the Horizon, whose Poles are in the 
Zenith
 and 
Nadir;
 and are called 
Circles of Altitude,
 because when the 
Sun, Moon,
 or any 
Star
 is in any number of degrees above the Horizon, it is said to have so many degrees of Al∣titude. And these Almicanters, or Circles of Alti∣tude,

 are numbered upon the Vertical Circle, from the Horizon upwards towards the Zenith.






Amplitude.


The 
Amplitude
 is an Arch of the Horizon, or the number of degrees contained between the true East and West-points in the Horizon, and the ri∣sing or setting points of the 
Sun, Moon,
 or 
Stars.






Ascension


Is the rising point of any Star, or any part or point of the Equinoxial above the Horizon.






Right Ascension.


The Right Ascension of the 
Sun, Moon,
 or 
Star,
 is the number of degrees upon the Equinoxial com∣prehended between the first point of 
Aries
 and the Arch of another Meridian passing through the cen∣tre of the 
Sun, Moon,
 or 
Star
 which is upon the Meridian at the time proposed.






Oblique Ascension.


Oblique Ascension is the Arch or number of de∣grees of the Equinoxial, which riseth with the 
Sun, Moon,
 or any 
Star
 in an Oblique Sphere.






Oblique Descension.


Oblique Descension is the Arch or number of the degrees of the Equinoxial which setteth with the 
Sun, Moon,
 or 
Star.








Ascensional difference


Is the number of degrees after the substraction of the 
Oblique Ascension
 from the 
Right Ascention;
 or the difference between the Ascension of any point of the Ecliptick in a Right Sphere, and the Ascension of the same point in an Oblique Sphere.






Apogaeum


Signifies that point of the Heavens where the 
Sun
 or any other Planet is farthest from the centre of the Earth.






Perigaeum


Is that point of the Heavens wherein the 
Sun
 or any Planet is neerest the centre of the Earth.






A
 Circle


Considered as it hath some ground in the na∣ture of the Heavens or the Earth, at least by Ap∣plication, is by Astronomers and Geographers di∣vided into 360 parts or degrees: not because this division hath any ground in Nature more than an∣other, but because this number is most commodi∣ous for the distinction of Circles, and fittest for Calculation, because no number suffers more parts or divisions than this.








Of the 
Compass
 of the Earth.


Now because the whole Circumference of a Cir∣cle is 360 degrees, therefore the Compass of the Earth, according to this supposition, must be 21600 miles. But this opinion seems to be taken (or ra∣ther mistaken) from 
Ptolomy,
 who allows 500 
Sta∣diums
 in a deg. and to every 
Stadium
 600 feet: so that it being proved that 5 
Aegyptian
 or 
Alexan∣drian
 feet are longer than 6 of the 
Italian,
 and the 
Romane
 or 
Italian
 is longer than our 
English;
 it is evident that there is no sufficient ground for this opinion, and therefore ought to be better consi∣dered of.






A
 Constellation.


A 
Constellation
 or 
Asterism
 is a certain number of 
Stars
 gathered together into one form, repre∣senting some living creature, or other thing, where∣by they are particularly known.






Complement


Is here usually taken for the remainder of the number of degrees and minutes that any part of a Circle wants of 90 degrees. As, suppose the Lati∣tude of a 
Star
 be 50 degrees, that being substra∣cted from 90 degrees, or the fourth part of a Cir∣cle, called a Quadrant, there remains 40 degrees for the Complement thereof.








Of a 
Degree.


'Tis a common Opinion, that 5 of our 
English
 Feet make a Geometrical Pace; 1000 of those Paces make an 
Italian
 or 
English
 Mile; and 60 of those Miles in any great Circle upon the Spherical surface of the Earth or Sea, make a Degree.


So that a degree of the Heavens contains upon the surface of the Earth, according to the Opi∣nion of the Ancients,



60 
English
 Miles.

Italian
 Miles.


20 
French
 Leagues.


20

 Leagues.


15 
Germane

17½

But according to several Experiments made, the quantity of a Degree is thus variously found to be; by

Declination


Is the number of degrees that the 
Sun
 or any Star is distant from the 
Equinoxial
 towards either Pole; and hath a double denomination, 
viz. North
 or

 
South-declination,
 according as the 
Sun
 or Star is on the North or South-side of the 
Equinoxial.






Of
 Eclipses.


An Eclipse is a privation or want of light in an opacous or dark Body which is beheld or aspected by a luminous Body: and these Eclipses are of two sorts.






Of the 
Eclipse
 of the 
Sun.


The Eclipse of the 
Sun
 is nothing else but the interposition of the 
Moon
 between our sight and the 
Sun.
 For the 
Moon
 being of a dark, solid, and opacous body, coming between the 
Sun
 and the 
Earth,
 doth thereby hide more or less of the 
Sun
's bright-shining body from our sight, so that the 
Earth
 (improperly the 
Sun
) is Eclipsed. This Eclipse cannot be universal (as the 
Moon
's Eclipse is) but may appear in one Country a greater E∣clipse, in another lesser, and in other-some no E∣clipse at all. For seeing the 
Sun
 far exceedeth the 
Earth
 in bigness, and the 
Earth
 far exceedeth the 
Moon;
 therefore the Cone of the 
Earth
's sha∣dow cannot take away or hide the whole body of the 
Sun
 from all parts of the 
Earth,
 but one part onely shall observe the same to be total, or of a like quantity.






Of the 
Eclipse
 of the 
Moon.


The 
Moon
 having no light but what she recei∣veth of the 
Sun,
 can never be Eclipsed but at the

 Full: yet not at every Full, but when she is dia∣metrically opposite to the 
Sun,
 and the 
Earth
 in the midst between them both. For the 
Earth
 being a solid and opacous Body, casteth its shadow to that point which is opposite to the Sun. So that Conjunction and Opposition onely makes an E∣clipse; which so happens, when the centre of the 
Earth
 and the centres of both the Sun and Moon shall be in the same line: which can onely be, where the 
Moon
's Eccentrick cutteth the 
Sun
's in that line which is called the Ecliptick. This in∣tersection, which can be but in two places, is cal∣led the 
Nodes,
 or Dragon's head and tayl. Nor does this intersection keep one certain place, but moving, make a Circle of 18 years. So that Eclipses being Periodical, an Eclipse of the 
Moon
 happening now, shall 18 years hence come to pass in the same Signe again.






Horizon


Is taken from the boundary or termination of the light; and is twofold: Natural, and Astronomi∣cal. The Natural 
Horizon
 is that apparent Circle which divides the visible part of Heaven from the invisible; extending it self in a straight line from the superficies of the Earth every way round about the place you stand upon, dividing the Heavens in∣to two unequal parts; which is designed out by the sight, and is sometimes greater or lesser, accor∣ding to the condition of the place.


The Astronomical 
Horizon
 is that great Circle that divides that part of Heaven which is above is, from that part which is under us, exactly into

 two equal parts, always certain and the same, pas∣sing thorow the Centre of the 
Earth,
 whose Poles are the 
Zenith
 and 
Nadir.
 In this Circle, the 
Azi∣muths
 or Vertical Circles are numbered: and by this Circle our days and nights are measured. This Circle is represented by the upper Plane of the Wooden Horizon.






Of the
 Sun's Longitude.


The Longitude of the 
Sun
 is an Arch of the E∣cliptick comprehended between the Circle of Lon∣gitude passing thorow the first point of 
Aries,
 and another Circle of Longitude passing thorow the Centre of the 
Sun.






Of the 
Longitude
 of a 
Star
 or 
Planet.


The Longitude of a Star or Planet is properly an Arch of the Ecliptick comprehended between the Semicircle of Longitude passing thorow the beginning of the Signe the Star or Planet is in, and the Semicircle of Longitude passing thorow the Centre of the Star or Planet.






Of the 
Latitude
 of the 
Moon, Star
 or 
Planet.


The Latitude of the Moon, Star or Planet, is their distance from the neerest point of the Ecli∣ptick either North or South, or an Arch of a Semi∣circle of Longitude comprehended between the E∣cliptick and the Star or point enquired after.








Magnetical Meridian


Is an 
Azimuth
 that passeth by the points of the Needle touched with the Loadstone, or that which passeth through the Poles of the Magnetical Vari∣ation.






Magnetical Azimuth 
of the
 Sun


Is an Arch of the Horizon contained between the 
Magnetical Meridian
 and the 
Azimuth
 of the 
Sun.






Azimuth 
of the
 Sun


Is an Arch of the Horizon comprehended be∣tween the 
Azimuth
 passing thorow the Centre of the Sun, and the true Meridian.








Of the several Positions of the Globe or Sphere.


WHereas in the resolving Problemes (of what kinde soever) upon the Globes, some there are which may be performed the Globe being in any position or situation, having no need of 
Recti∣fication;
 as in 
Astronomy,
 the Longitude, Place, or Declination of the 
Sun;
 the Longitude, Latitude, Declination and Distances of 
Stars
 upon the 
Cele∣stial Globe.
 In 
Geography,
 the Longitude, Lati∣tude, and Distance of places by the 
Terrestrial

 Globe.
 Also several Problems may be resolved by the help of some one single Circle, either such as is described upon the Globe it self, or is otherwise appendant unto it. As in 
Geography,
 the diffe∣rence of Longitude between Country and Coun∣try by the 
Equinoxial
 or 
Hour Circle;
 the Latitude and difference of Latitude of Places, by the 
Meri∣dian.
 In 
Astronomy,
 the Declination of the 
Sun
 or 
Stars,
 by the 
Meridian;
 the distance of 
Stars
 in the Heavens, or of 
Places
 upon the Earth or Sea, by the 
Quadrant
 of 
Altitude.
 The day of the Month, Sun's place and declination upon the 
Hori∣zon;
 with divers other the like Conclusions.


But for the resolving of most Problems, it will be requisite to have the Globe placed or fitted ac∣cording to some assigned Position or Elevation, such as the tenour of the Question shall require. And, besides the Globe it self, and the Circles de∣scribed upon it, such also as are appendant unto it must come in use; as the General Meridian, Hori∣zon, Quadrant of Altitude, Hour-circle, and Circle of Position, must be accordingly rectified.


Now there are but Three Positions in which the Globe can be said to be rectified; of which, two are particular, and the third more general. For,




Of a Direct Sphere.


I. The Globe may be so placed in the Frame of the Horizon, that both the Poles thereof may rest upon (or he directly in) the North and South points of the Horizontal Circle, neither Pole ha∣ving any Elevation, the Zenith-point being in the Equinoxial Circle, and the Axis of the world di∣rectly

 in the plain of the Horizon; and so the peo∣ple living under that Circle have no Latitude, the Pole having no Elevation.


The Globe or Sphere being in this position, is said to be in a 
Direct
 position, the Zenith being directly in the Equinoxial Circle, and the Poles of the world directly in the North and South points of the Horizon: and this 
direct
 position of the Sphere is particular to those who live under the Equinoxial, who have one benefit and priviledge above all the inhabitants of the world besides, for that they can see both the Poles, and behold all the Stars (in both Hemispheres) to rise, culminate, and set.






Of a
 Parallel Sphere.


II. The Globe may be so placed in the Frame of the Horizon, that one of the Poles shall be in the 
Zenith,
 and the other in the 
Nadir
-points; that is, either Pole shall be 90 
deg.
 (or one quarter of a Circle) distant from the Horizon on either side thereof; and in this position will the Equinoxial Circle be in the Horizon, and the Axis of the world will cut both the Equinoxial and the Hori∣zon at Right-angles: one Pole having 90 degrees of Elevation, and the other as much of Depres∣sion.


The Globe or Sphere being in this position, is said to be 
Parallel;
 because the Equinoxial, and all the Circles of Declination, (which now are Circles of Altitude also) and the Axis of the world it self, do lie all of them Parallel to the Horizon. And those people (if any be) that inhabit these parts of

 the world, see onely those Stars that are between the Equinoxial and the Elevated Pole; that is, if the South-Pole be elevated, they see the Southern; and if the North-Pole be elevated, they see the Northern Constellations onely. And those people have but one day and one night in the whole year, and those most miserable cold, not to be imagined: for the Sun, at his highest, never ex∣tendeth to 24 degrees of Altitude; which is no more than it is with us in 
London
 at Noon upon the 14 or 15 of 
February.
 And this position of the Sphere is particular to these inhabitants one∣ly.






Of an
 Oblique Sphere.


III. The third (and most usual) position of the Sphere or Globe is more general; for it hath rela∣tion to all people living between the Equinoxial and either of the Poles: and according as the Poles of the Globe are elevated or depressed, ac∣cordingly are the people said to be situate: Thus, if the Globe be placed in the Frame of the Hori∣zon so that the Pole be elevated 10 degrees above the Horizon; then is the Globe elevated or fitted to resolve such Questions or Problems Astrono∣mical as relate to those people who (have the Pole elevated, or) do live in the Latitude of 10 de∣grees.


This position of the Globe or Sphere is called 
Oblique,
 because the Axis of the World, the Equi∣noxial, and all the rest of the Parallels of Decli∣nation, are cut by the Horizon at Oblique Angles; whereas in the two former positions they cut one

 the other at Right Angles. Now the people which live in these middle Latitudes, (I mean be∣tween the 
Arctick
 and 
Antarctick
 Circles) which (yet to our knowledge) is the most habitable part of the world, do see Stars both of the Nor∣thern and Southern Hemispheres; but yet they see not all the Stars in either Hemisphere: for in any Oblique Latitude, the inhabitants see, and may observe all such Stars that are of the contrary Hemisphere to them, whose declinations are lesser than the complement of their Latitude; and all those Stars of the contrary hemisphere, whose de∣clination is greater than the complement of their Latitude they never see, for they never ascend a∣bove their Horizon: and on the contrary, those Stars of their own Hemisphere whose declinations exceed the complement of their Latitude, do ne∣ver set, but are continually above their Horizon.






Fol. 27.

Of
 Time


Time is the measure of all our motions, and is divided by the two greater Lights of Heaven, into 
Hours, Days, Weeks, Months,
 and 
Years.






Of a 
Year.


A 
Year,
 though it might have been as truly said of any other Star or Planet, is now made proper to the 
Sun
 or 
Moon,
 whose Revolution in the E∣cliptick is the general definition of this part of Time; so that every Month, in the stricter sence, should be taken for a Lunar Year.








Of a
 Lunar Year.


The 
Lunar Year
 is that space of time wherein the 
Moon
 measureth the Zodiack Twelve times, or maketh Twelve Conjunctions with the 
Sun;
 which she finisheth in the space of 354 days, 8 hours, and some odde minutes, 11 days or there∣abouts before the 
Sun.






Of the
 Sun's Year.


The 
Sun's Year
 is the Revolution of his motion in the Ecliptick, which if it be accounted in the Zodiack, was called 
Annus Temporalis,
 because it distinguished the four Times or Seasons of the year. 'Tis otherwise called 
Annus Tropicus,
 because the Astronomers of old reckoned this Year from the Tropicks. But if the Revolution of the 
Sun
 be accounted from any Fixed Star to the same again, the Year is then called 
Annus Sydereus.


The precise quantity of this Year is determined of all to be 365 days: but the surplus of hours and minutes hath very much and vainly exercised the most Curious.


Julius Caesar
 looking upon it as a matter no way below his great consideration, after consultation with several Mathematicians, alotted 365 days and 6 hours for this Revolution, reserving every year the 6 odde hours to make a day for the 
Bis∣sextile
 or Leap-year, being every fourth in order; so that the three first years should consist of 365 days, and the fourth of 366; which by infallible experience is found too much. For the motion of

 the 
Sun
 through the Zodiack, from one fixed point to the same again, according to more exact Computation, is determined to consist of 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, and 4 seconds; which falls short of 6 hours by 10 minutes and 56 seconds in every year; which must of necessity breed a difference of so many minutes and seconds every year betwixt the Year which the 
Sun
 de∣scribes in the Zodiack, and that which is reckoned upon in the Kalendar.


Hence it comes to pass, that the Vernal Equi∣nox, which in the Emperour's time fell out to be upon the 24 of 
March,
 now falls about the 11 of 
March,
 twelve days backward, and more; so that if it be let alone, it will get back to the first of 
March,
 and so to 
February,
 till 
Easter
 falls to be upon 
Christmas day,
 which ought also to anticipate the 25 of 
December
 in our common 
Julian
 year, and be celebrated about thirteen days sooner.


Therefore the Pontificians do, according to the 
Gregorian
 Emendation, precede us by ten days in their account, which is called 
The New Stile.
 But why they went no higher than the 
Nicene
 Council in the Correction of the Year, and so fell short in the true time, the reason I must leave to them to give.






Of
 Civil 
and
 Natural days.


The 
Civil day
 is that space of time containing just 24 hours, reckoned from 12 of the clock on one day, to 12 of the clock the next day; in which space of time the Equinoxial makes a diurnal re∣volution upon the Poles of the world.




The 
Natural day
 is that space of Time wherein the 
Sun
 moveth from the Meridian of any place to the same Meridian again.






Of an 
Hour.


An 
Hour
 is the twenty fourth part of a day and a night; or the space of time that 15 degrees of the Equator takes up in the passing through the Me∣ridian. For the whole Equator, which contains 360 degrees, passeth through the Meridian in 24 hours, which are Mathematically divided into mi∣nutes, seconds, thirds, 
&c.






Of the 
Zenith.


The 
Zenith
 (or 
Senith
 in the Arabick) is the Pole of the Horizon, an imaginary point just over our heads, 
viz.
 the Vertical point, or highest top∣point of the Heaven from our Horizon, and equi∣distant from it round about 90 degrees.






Nadir.


The 
Nadir,
 or 
Nathir,
 a foot-point perpendicu∣larly imagined from our feet down through the Centre of the Earth, is that point in Heaven which is directly under our feet.












Geographical Definitions.
 A Description of the 
Circles, Lines,
 &c. Drawn upon the Superficies of the Terrestrial GLOBE.




Of the 
Equator.


THe 
Equator,
 or the Line under the Equi∣noxial, is a great Circle encompassing the very middle of the Globe between the two Poles, dividing it into two equal parts from North to South; and is divided, as the Equinoxial, into 360 equal parts or degrees; and is called 
The Equator,
 either because it is equally distant from the Poles of the World, or rather because when the 
Sun
 comes to this Line, which is twice in a year, 
viz.
 in the beginning of 
Aries,
 which with us is about the 10 and 11 of 
March;
 and again in 
Libra,
 which is about the 13 and 14 of 
September,
 he makes equality of days and nights throughout the world.






Of the 
Meridians.


The 
Meridians
 are Circles passing through the Poles of the Globe, and cut the Equator at Right

 Angles: infinite in number, because all places from East to West have several Meridians; but the number of Meridians delineated upon our Globes are 24. The first or chief Meridian, which is as it were the Land-mark of the whole Earth in our new Globes, begins at the Island of S. 
Mi∣chael,
 one of the Isles of the 
Azores;
 from whence is reckoned the beginning of Longitude, and is the onely Circle passing through the Poles of the Globe, which is divided into twice 90 degrees, numbred from the Equator towards both the Poles. The lesser Meridians are those black Cir∣cles which pass through the Poles of the Globe, succeeding the great Meridian at 10 and 10 deg. in most Globes, but in ours at 15 and 15 degrees difference, and are numbred in the Equator with 15 30 &c. to 360, round the Globe.






Of the 
Parallels.


The 
Parallels
 are Circles running East and West round about the Globe like as the Equator; onely the Equator is a great Circle, and these are every one less than the other, diminishing gradually, un∣til they terminate and end in the Pole. As the Meridians are infinite, so are the Parallels, and are delineated through every tenth degree of the first Meridian, numbred from the Equator to either of the Poles with 10 20 to 90.






Of the 
Lines
 under the 
Ecliptick, Tropicks,
 and 
Polar Circles.


Crossing the Equator obliquely in the middle, is the Ecliptick: the utmost extent of it towards

 the North, noteth ou
 the Tropick of 
Cancer;
 to∣wards the South, the Tropick of 
Capricorn;
 each of them distant from the Equator 23 degrees and a half. Parallel to the Tropicks, and at the same distance from the Poles as they are from the Equa∣tor, are drawn the 
Arctick
 and 
Antarctick
 Circles, offering themselves to sight by their Names, and distinctions of Bredth and Colour; being, as the Tropicks are, represented by more full Lines than the Parallels are.






ADVETISEMENT.


AS for the Land, Seas, Islands, Rivers, Rumbs, with other Geographical Definitions rela∣ting to the Terrestrial Globe; I shall refer you to my following Description of Universal Maps and Charts; wherein is fully and methodically explai∣ned the whole Rudiments of Geography; being very necessary for the better illustration and un∣derstanding of the Terrestrial Globe.










Having thus given you a brief Account of the several Positions of the Globe or Sphere, and of the Explanations of the Lines, Circles, 
&c.
 it will be convenient now to shew you the Uses thereof, in the Solution of Problems of divers kindes: in the performance whereof, I shall be both brief and plain.


And whereas I formerly said, that divers Pro∣blems may be resolved upon either Globe, it being in any position whatsoever (which will plainly appear hereafter) yet it will be more convenien
 to have the Globe fitted and accommodated with all its necessary Appendants before you make use of it. And therefore my first business shall be, to shew how to fix and set the parts of the Globe to∣gether, fit for use in any assigned Latitude or par
 of the World: and this I call 
Rectifying of th
 Globe.






How to Rectifie the 
GLOBES,
 fitting them for Use In any LATITUDE or place of the World.


BEing provided of a pair of Globes, the Me∣ridian, Horizon and Hour-circle truly turned and divided; also the Ball truly hung, and the Meridian and Horizon (in all positions) cutting each other at Right Angles, the Papers truly joy∣ned in their Pasting, 
&c.
 all which are to be per∣formed by the Work-man, (though the Buyer ought also to have inspection thereinto) you may proceed to Rectifie them in this manner.


1. Put the Brass-Meridian into the two Notches that are in the North and South-parts of the Ho∣rizon; the Graduated or divided part thereof to∣wards the East-point, and the blank or plain side of the Meridian towards the West-point of the Horizon; and let the Meridian rest in the Notch which is in the foot or bottom of the Horizon.


2. Place the Hour-wheel about the Pole, so that the Hour-lines of 12 and 12 do lie directly over the East or Graduated side of the Meridian, and that the point of the Axis do pass directly through the Centre of the Hour-circle; so shall the two Twelves, one of them represent 12 at

 Noon, and the other 12 at Midnight; and the two Sixes, the one 6 in the Morning, and the o∣ther 6 at Night. Then put the little Index or Pointer upon the Axis, so that it may move as you turn the Globe about, and so is your Hour-wheel Rectified.


4. Elevate the Pole of your Globe (whether the North or South-pole) according to the Latitude of that part of the world you are in: as for Example, for 
London,
 whose Latitude is 51 deg. 30 min. North; the Meridian being in the Notches of the Horizon, and also in that in the foot of the Frame, as is before directed, Move the Meridian up or down in the Notches, till you finde 51 deg. 30 min. of the Meridian justly to touch the upper part of the North-part of the Horizon: for then is your Globe set exactly to the Latitude of 51 deg. 30 m.


4. For the Rectifying of the Quadrant of Alti∣tude, this also must have respect to the Latitude: Wherefore, the Latitude being 51 deg. 30 min. count 51 deg. 30 min. upon the South-part of the Meridian, from the Equinoxial-circle towards the North (or elevated) Pole; and put on the Nut which is at the end of the Quadrant, so that the edge of the divisions of the Quadrant may lie di∣rectly under the degrees of the Latitude, 
viz.
 under 51 deg. 30 min. and then screw the Nut fast; and so is the Quadrant of Altitude Rectified also.




These are the four principal things that almost in all Cases must be Rectified: for the Circle of position, that seldome comes in use but in Dialling and Astrologie; and so it is not fit to cumber the Globe with it at other times: but when there is occasion for it, you must re∣ctifie it as followeth.


5. The two ends of the diameter of this Circle are to be placed in the North and South-points of the Horizon; and it is to move up and down be∣tween the Meridian and the Horizon, and there to be fixed or held at any acquired place. And this is all the Rectifying that this Circle requires, and is (as I said before) but seldome to be used; and therefore they are not usually made or sold with the Globes.

 begins and ends.


 
THe Twilight beginneth when the
 Sun 
is
 18 
deg. below the Horizon before its Rising, and it endeth when the Sun comes to be
 18 
deg. below the Horizon after its Setting.


 The Globe Rectified, and the 
Sun
 in 29 deg. of 
Taurus,
 finde the opposite point there∣unto, which is the 29 deg. of 
Scorpio,
 and bring that point, as also the Quadrant of Altitude, both of them on the West-side of the Meridian; and then move both the body of the Globe, and the Qua∣drant of Altitude also, till the 29 deg. of 
Scorpio
 lie directly under 18 deg. of the Quadrant of Al∣titude: which done, keep them both together, and then see how many hours the Index is removed from 12, which you shall finde to be 1 hour and 8 minutes. So that 
Twilight
 begins at 8 min. af∣ter 1 in the morning. And this being taken from 4 ho. 11 min. the time of the 
Sun
's Rising that day, there will remain 3 ho. 3 min. which is the length or continuance of the 
Twilight.
 Also if you double the time of the beginning of 
Twilight
 1 ho. 8 min. you shall have the length of dark night, which will be but 2 ho. 16 min.


In like manner, if you would know when the 
Twilight
 endeth after 
Sun
-setting, you must bring the 29 deg. of 
Scorpio
 (the point opposite to the 
Sun
) on the East-side of the Meridian, making it and 18 deg. of the Quadrant of Altitude to meet, then the Index will shew 10 hours 52 min. and

 till that time of night doth 
Twilight

 at all, but all that time continual day for all that space of time the 
Sun
 never descendeth so much as 18 deg. under the Horizon, in the La∣titude of 51 deg. 30 min.






PROB. XII. 
 What 
Altitude
 the 
Sun
 shall have at 
6
 of the Clock in the morning or evening.


 
THe Altitude of the
 Sun, 
or of a Star,
 &c. 
is an Arch of an
 Azimuth 
or Vertical Circle, passing through the
 Zenith 
and
 Nadir 
points and the body of the
 Sun 
or Star, counted from the Horizon to the
 Sun 
or Star: and all such
 Azimuths 
or Vertical Circles are represented by the Quadrant of Altitude.


¶ 
Note,
 that this Problem is onely in use when the 
Sun
 is in the six Northern signes: for the 
Sun
 is never above the Horizon at six, when he is in Southern signes.




 Bring the 29 deg. of 
Taurus
 to the Meridian, and set the Index of the Hour-circle to 12; then turn the Globe about Eastward, till the Index of the Hour-circle come just to 6 a clock: then holding the Globe there, lay the Quadrant of Altitude just over the 29 deg. of 
Taurus,
 and there you shall finde it to cut 15 deg. 30 min. of the Quadrant. And such 
Altitude
 shall the 
Sun
 have at 6 of the clock in the morning, and the same at 6 at night.

 this Problem is of Use onely when the 
Sun
 is in Northern signes.


 Bring the 29 of 
Taurus
 to the Meri∣dian, and set the Index of the Hour-wheel to 12; then move the Globe till the Index lie upon 6; and holding the Globe there, lay the Quadrant of Al∣titude just over 29 deg.

This Table hath the like use for the making of 
Cylinders, Quadrants,
 and other Instruments that give the 
Azimuth
 by the height of the 
Sun,
 as the preceding Table hath for the 
Hour,
 and may be so applied.








The Latitude (51 deg. 30 min.) the 
Sun
's place in the Ecliptick, (29 deg. 0 min. of 
Taurus
) and his Altitude (12 deg.) being given: To finde


PROB. XVIII. 
The
 Sun
's
 Azimuth 
at any time.


 THe Globe being Rectified, 
&c.
 and the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 fixed, and brought to the 
Horizon;
 Turn 29 deg. of 
Taurus
 toward the East, if in the morning; or towards the West, if in the evening, till it come to lie just under deg. of the 
Quadrant of Altitude;
 and then note at what degree in the 
Horizon
 the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 resteth; which will be at 16 deg. 8 min. from the East if in the morning, or 16 deg. 8 min. from the West if in the afternoon Northward, which is the 
Azimuth
 from the East or West to∣wards the North. And this 
Azimuth,
 if reckon∣ed by the Points of the Compass upon the 
Hori∣zon,
 will be E. by N. 4 deg. 53 min. Northward, if in the morning; or W. by N. 4 deg. 53 min. Northward, if in the evening, when the 
Sun
 is in 29 deg. of 
Taurus,
 and hath 12 deg. of 
Altitude.
 Now if you count the degrees of the 
Horizon
 be∣tween the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 and the North∣part of the 
Meridian,
 you shall finde them to be 73 deg. 52 min. which is the 
Azimuth
 from the

 North: And if you count them from the South-part of the 
Meridian,
 you shall finde them to be 106 deg. 8 min. which is the 
Azimuth
 from the South.

) will appear to be S. E. by S. if in the morning, or S. W. by S. if in the evening.






PROB. XIX. 
 The Hour of the day.


 BRing 29 deg. of

 to the Me∣ridian, and set the Index to 12
 clock: Then, if it be in the forenoon, set the 
Qua∣drant of Altitude
 on the East-side of the 
Meridian▪
 but on the West-side, if it be in the afternoon. And turn the Globe about, till the 29 deg. of 
Taur
s
 meet with 12 deg. of the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 and then shall the Index of the Hour-circle poin
 at 5 a clock and 36 min. if it be in the morning or at 24 min. after 6 of the clock, if it be at nigh

PROB. XX. 
 To finde the Difference of 
Latitude,
 or, to know how many degrees the 
Pole
 must be Elevated or Depressed, to make the 
Lon∣gest day
 in any 
Latitude
 an Hour longer, or the 
Shortest
 an Hour shorter than it is in your 
Latitude.


LEt it be required to finde in what Latitude the 
Longest day
 shall be an hour longer than it is at 
London.




 Rectifie the Globe to the Meridian of 
London,
 the Index of the Hour-circle to 12, and the Solstitial Colure to the Meridian; so shall the number of hours contained between the Brass-Meridian and the Horizon, upon the Tropick of 
Cancer,
 be half the length of the 
Longest day
 at 
London,
 namely, 123 deg. which in time is 8 ho. and 13 minutes for the 
Semidecimal Arch
 of the 
Artificial day
 at 
London.
 At this intersection of the Tropick of 
Cancer
 with the Horizon, make a small mark upon the Tropick, and move the Globe Westward, till the Equinoxial Circle hath passed 7 deg. 30 min. or one half hour of time from the Meridian; and then observe where the Tropick of 
Cancer
 intersects with the Horizon a∣gain, and there upon the Tropick make another small mark. Then bring the Solstitial Colure back again to the Meridian, and there fix the Ball of the Globe; and move the Brass-Meridian in the Horizon upwards, till your second prick which you made upon the Tropick do just touch the Ho∣rizon; then will the Globe stand at that Latitude in which the 
Longest day
 will be an hour longer than the 
Longest day
 at 
London
 is; and that Lati∣tude will be found be to be 56 deg. 27 min.


But if you would know in what Latitude the 
Longest day
 shall be one hour shorter than at 
Lon∣don,
 then having made a mark upon the Tropick at the termination of the 
Longest day
 there, move the Globe Eastward, till 7 deg. 30 min. have pas∣sed the Meridian; and where the Tropick and Ho∣rizon intersect, make there a mark upon the Tro∣pick, and bring the Solstitial Colure to the Meridi∣an, and fix the body of the Globe there: then de∣press

 the Meridian in the Horizon, till your second mark do touch the Horizon; then will the Globe rest at that Latitude wherein the 
Longest day
 will be one hour shorter than the 
Longest day
 at 
London
 is; which Latitude will be found to be 35 deg. 58 min.






PROB. XXI. 
 How much must the 
Sun
's Declination in∣crease or decrease, to make the Day Arti∣ficial one hour longer or shorter than it was at the time proposed.


SUppose in Latitude 51 deg. 30 min. the 
Sun
 to have 10 degrees of North-Declination, and I would know how much the Declination must in∣crease Northward, to make the day one hour longer than it is.


 Elevate the Globe to the Latitude of 
London,
 51 deg. 30 min. and bring the Equino∣xial Colure to the Meridian, and bring the 
Sun
's place, or the parallel of 10 deg. his Declination, to the Horizon; and upon the Horizon make a small mark, to which bring the Equinoxial Colure, and at this intersection make a mark upon the Colure. Then (if the days lengthen, move the Globe East∣ward, or Westward if they shorten) till 7 deg. 30 min. of the Equinoxial have passed the Meri∣dian; and then, again, where the former Colure intersects with the Horizon, make another mark, upon the Colure. This done, bring the Colure to the Meridian again, and see what number of de∣grees

 of the Meridian (or degrees of the Colure it self) are contained between the two pricks; which you shall finde to be 4 deg. and 40 min. And so much must the Declination increase Northward, to make the day lengthen one hour, at that time of the year.






PROB. XXII. 
 To finde what number of days are contain∣ed between the days of Lengthening or shortning one hour, at any time of the year.


LEt the time be as in the last Example, where the 
Sun
 hath 10 deg. of North-declination; which will be about the 5 of 
April.


 Having made two pricks in the Co∣lure, as in the last Example, Bring the first prick to the Horizon, where you shall finde it to stand a∣gainst the 5 of 
April.
 Then move the Globe till the other prick touch the Horizon; which it will do about the 19 of 
April,
 at which time the day will be one hour longer than it was upon the 5 of 
April:
 between which two days, there are con∣tained 13 compleat days, and parts of both the two other days. So that you may conclude, that in 14 days time (at that season of the year) the days do lengthen one hour, and shorten as much when the 
Sun
 is in opposite signes.








PROB. XXIII. 
 To finde the length of the Longest or Shor∣test day in any Latitude.


 
THe Longest Artificial day in any Lati∣tude, is made by the
 Sun
's passing tho∣row the Tropick of
 Cancer 
in all places that have North-Latitude, or thorow the Tropick of
 Capricorn 
to all that have South-Latitude.


 To finde the length of the Longest day at 
London,
 in Latitude 51 deg. 30 min. elevate the Globe thereto, and bring the Solstitial Colure to the Meridian, and the Hour-Index to 12. Then, count the number of hours upon the Tro∣pick of 
Cancer,
 that are contained thereupon be∣tween the intersection thereof with the Horizon, on the East-side, and its intersection on the West-side; which you will finde to be 16 hours, and almost half an hour, 
viz.
 26 min. for the length of the Longest day. And the number of hours con∣tained between the East and West intersections of the Tropick of 
Capricorn
 and the Horizon, is the length of the Shortest day, which at 
London
 will be found to be 7 hours, and somewhat above half an hour, 
viz.
 34 min.


Half the length of the Day is the time of the 
Sun
's 
Setting,
 and half the length of the Night is the time of the 
Sun
's 
Rising.








PROB. XXIV. 
 Of the Reason of the Inequality of Days Natural, and Days Civil.


 A 
Natural day is that space of time in which the
 Sun 
moveth from the Meri∣dian of some one place or Country, to the same Meridi∣an again. These days are not always of an equal length, but are longer at some times of the year than at other times, but at all times they are longer than the Civil day is. A Civil day being that space of time containing just
 24 
hours, reckoned from
 12 
a clock one day, unto
 12 
of the clock the next day; in which time the Equinoxial maketh one entire Revolu∣tion about the
 Axis 
of the world. The difference between these two sorts of Days is but small; and there is a double cause for this small inequalitie.


1. 
Because the
 Sun
's apparent motion differs from his true motion, as being slower when he is in his
 A∣pogaeum, 
than in his
 Perigaeum; 
he moving scarce
 58 
min. in a day when he is in the one, and above
 61 
min. when he is in the other; and so increaseth in Right Ascension.


2. 
The difference of Right Ascensions in several e∣equal parts of the Ecliptick: for when the
 Sun 
is neer either of the Tropicks, the Ascensional Differen∣ces are greater than when the
 Sun 
is about the Equi∣noxial: for about
 Aries 
or
 Libra, 
the Right Ascension of
 10 
deg. is but
 9 
deg.
 10 
min. whereas the Right Ascension of
 10 
deg. of
 Cancer 
or
 Capricorn 
is
 10 
deg. and
 53 
min.


Now this difference being so small, in one days

 time it is not perceptible by the Globe; wherefore if you would finde this difference, it would be requisite to take some number of days, as
 10, 20, 
or
 30, 
and in them it will be apparent. And to effect it by the Globe, do thus.


 First, finde the place of the 
Sun,
 both at the beginning and ending of those days you would compute the difference of 2. Finde the 
Right Ascensions
 answerable to each place in the Ecliptick, as also the difference of 
Right Ascensions
 answerable to the motion of the 
Sun
 in each re∣spective number of days. 3. Compare the dif∣ference of the 
Right Ascensions
 together, by substra∣cting the lesser from the greater; and the diffe∣rence converted into time, shall be the number of minutes that the one number of days exceedeth the other.




EXAMPLE.


Let it be required to finde what difference there is in the length of the first 20 days of 
December,
 and the first 20 days of 
March.

Here by this Synopsis you may perceive that the difference of these 20 days taken at several times of the year is 4 deg. 2 min. which converted in∣to time is 16 minutes, that is, a quarter of an hour

 and one minute; and so much longer are the first 20 days in 
December,
 than the first 20 days of 
March.


And by this means you shall finde that the Month of 
January
 is longer than the Month of 
June
 (both Months consisting of 31 days) by 1 deg. 20 min. which is onely 4 1/
 min. in time.

¶ All the fore-mentioned Problems may be performed upon either Globe; the 
Horizon, Meridian, Quadrant
 of 
Altitude, Hour-circle,
 and most of the Circles upon the Globes themselves, being in both Globes the same. But it is most proper to use the Terrestrial Globe for Geographical and Nautical Pro∣blems; and the Celestial Globe for such as concern Astronomy: and these following are chiefly such, and therefore best to be wrought by the Celestial Globe.










PROB. XXV. 
 To finde the 
Longitude
 and 
Latitude
 of any Star.


 
THe
 Longitude 
of a Star is an Arch of the Ecliptick, contained between the beginning of
 Aries, 
and the intersection of an arch of a great Circle, which passeth through both the Poles of the Ecliptick, and also through the bo∣dy of that Star.


The
 Latitude 
of a Star is that part of an arch of a great Circle which passeth through both the Poles of the Ecliptick, and through the bodie of the Star, and is contained between the Ecliptick-line and that Star.


 For the 
Longitude,
 skrew the 
Qua∣drant
 of 
Altitude
 over that Pole of the Ecliptick which is neerest to the Star whose 
Longitude
 you seek. Then laying the Quadrant just over the centre of the Star,
 look what degrees of the Ecli∣ptick, (counting them from the beginning of 
Aries
) and those degrees are the degrees of the Star's 
Longitude.
 So the 
Qua∣drant
 of 
Altitude
 skrewed over the North-pole of the Ecliptick, and laid upon the bright Star 
Capella,
 the Quadrant shall cut 77 deg. 16 min. of the Ecliptick-Circle, counted from the beginning of 
Aries;
 and that is that Star's 
Longitude.




For the 
Latitude,
 the 
Quadrant
 fitted as before, and laid over the centre of 
Capella,
 the Star shall out 22 deg. 50 min. of the 
Quadrant
 of 
Altitude,
 and such is the 
Latitude
 of that Star, North, for that it lies on the North-side of the Ecliptick-Line.






PROB. XXV. 
 To finde the 
Right Ascension
 and 
Declina∣tion
 of a Star.


 
THe
 Right Ascension 
of a Star is that Arch of the Equinoxial which is con∣tained between the beginning of
 Aries 
and that point which comes to the Meridian with that Star.


The
 Declination 
of a Star is an Arch of the Me∣ridian contained between the Equinoxial and any Star.


 For the 
Right Ascension,
 (the Globe being rectified) bring 
Capella
 to the Meridian, and then shall you finde 73 deg. 7 min. of the Equi∣noxial contained between the beginning of 
Aries
 and the Meridian; and that is the 
Right Ascension
 of 
Capella.


For the 
Declination,
 bring 
Capella
 to the Meri∣dian, so shall you finde 45 deg. 37 min. of the Meridian contained between the Equinoxial and 
Capella;
 and that is the 
Declination
 of that Star▪ And in this manner you may finde the 
Longitude, Latitude, Right Ascension,
 and 
Declination
 of any other Star upon the Celestial Globe: As in this following Table of the principal Fixed Stars of the first Magnitude, you shall finde

PROB. XXVI. 
 To finde the distance of two Stars.


 1. 
IF the two Stars be both of them under the same Meridian,
 Bring them un∣der the General (or Brass) Meridian, and see what degrees of the Meridian are contained be∣tween them, for that is their distance.


2. 
If they lie not under the same Meridian, but have the same declination, or lie in the same Parallel,
 Bring one of them to the Meridian, and see what degrees of the Equinoctial are cut thereby: then bring the other Star to the Meridian, and count what degrees of the Equinoctial are contained

 between the Meridian and the degrees before found, for that is the distance of those two Stars.


3. 
If the two Stars do neither lie under the same Meridian, nor in the same Parallel,
 Then lay the Quadrant of Altitude (it being loose) to both the Stars, and the degrees of the Quadrant con∣tained between the two Stars is their distance. And if the Quadrant be too short, you may use the Circle of Position, or take their distance with a pair of Calope-Compasses, and measure their distance upon the Equinoctial, or any other great Circle.


Thus


The Right Shoulder of 
Auriga,
 and the Right Shoulder of 
Orion,
 being under the same Meridi∣an, their distance will be found to be 37 deg. 38 min.


Also


Arcturus
 and the Lions Neck, being neer in the same Parallel, their distance will be found to be 57 degrees.


Likewise


Lyra
 the Harp, and 
Marchad
 in the Wing of 
Pegasus,
 will be found to be distant 63 degrees.






PROB. XXVII. 
 To know what Stars will be upon the Meridian at any hour of the Night.


 THe 
Sun
 being in 29 deg. of 
Taurus
 what 
Stars
 will be upon the Meri∣dian at 10 a clock and 12 min. at Night, bring

 29 deg. of 
Scorpio
 (which is the opposite Signe to 
Taurus
) to the Meridian, and set the Index of the Hour-Circle to 12. then turn the Globe a∣bout Westward till the Index point at 12 min. after 10 a clock, and there hold the Globe; and all those 
Stars
 which lie under the Brass Meridian are then upon the Meridian, of which 
Arcturus
 is the Chief.






PROB. XXVIII. 
 To know what day in the year any Star shall be upon the Meridian at 
12
 a clock at Night.


 BRing the 
Star
 to the Meridian, and mark what degree of the Ecliptick is just under the Meridian at the same time: Then finde that degree of the Ecliptick in the 
Horizon,
 and note what day of the year standeth against it, for that day of the year will that 
Star
 be up∣on the South-part of the Meridian at 12 at night: and when the Sun is in the opposite Point of the Ecliptick, the same 
Star
 will be upon the North∣part of the Meridian at 12 at noon.








PROB. XXIX. 
 The 
Sun
's Place, and the Altitude of a known Star given, To finde the hour of the Night.


THe 
Sun
 being in 21 deg. of 
Capricorn,
 the Al∣titude of the 
Great Dog
 14 deg. I demand the hour of the Night.


 The Globe Rectified, 
&c.
 bring 21 deg. of 
Capricorn
 to the Meridian, and the Index to 12 a clock. Then move the Globe and Qua∣drant of Altitude so together, that the 
Great Dog
 meet with 14 deg. of the Quadrant; and then shall the Index point at 8 of the clock and 22 mi∣nutes; which is the true hour of the Night.

 THe Quadrant of Altitude being fixed in the 
Zenith,
 move it and the Globe, till the degrees of Altitude given do meet with the centre of the Star; then shall the

 end of the Quadrant of Altitude shew you upon the Horizon the 
Azimuth
 in which the Star then is. And thus, if you bring the Quadrant of Al∣titude on the East-side of the Globe, moving it and the Globe both, till the centre of 
Aldebaran
 do meet just with 42 deg. of the Quadrant, you shall then finde the Quadrant of Altl
ude to rest at 33 deg. of the Horizon, counted from the East; or at 57 deg. if you count them from the South: and that is the 
Azimuth
 of 
Aldebaran
 when he hath 42 deg. of Altitude; and that is neer the S. E. by E. point of the Compass.

 The 
Semidiurnal Arch,
 and the time that 
Aldebaran
 (or any other Star) continues above the 
Horizon.


 BRing 
Aldebaran
 to the Meridian, and set the Hour-circle to 12. Then turn the Globe Westward, till 
Aldebaran
 touch the Horizon: then shall the Hour-Index point at 7 ho. 27 min. And so long time is 
Aldebaran
 a∣bove the Horizon, before he comes to the Meri∣dian; and continues so many hours and minutes above the Horizon, after he hath past the Meridi∣an, and sets in the West. And those 7 ho. and 27 min. is the 
Semidiurnal Arch
 of that Star; which doubled, is 14 ho. 54 min. And so long doth that Star continue above the Horizon after the time of his rising.

 to the Meridian, and set the Hour-Index to 12. Then turn the Globe about till 
Aldebaran
 be under the Meridian, and then you shall finde the Index to point at 42 min. after 8 of the clock, at which time 
Aldebaran
 will be upon the Meridian that night.

PROB. XXXVI. 
 At what hour (at any time of the year) 
Al∣debaran
 (or any other Star) riseth or setteth.


 LEt the time be 
January
 1. By the last before-going, you found that 
Aldebaran
 came to the Meridian at 8 ho. 42 min. And by the last but one, you found his Semidiur∣nal Arch to be 7 ho. 27 min. This being taken from 8 ho. 42 min. the time of his being South,

 leaveth 1 hour 15 minutes, the time of its Rising: so that upon the first of 
January Aldebaran
 did rise at 15 min. after 1 in the afternoon. Again, if you add his Semidiurnal Arch 7 hours 27 min. to the time of its being South 8 hours 42 min. the sum will be 16 hours 9 min. from which take 12 hours, and the remainer will be 4 hours 9 min. So that 
Aldebaran
 will set at 9 min. after 4 of the Clock the next morning. And in like manner you may finde, that

 and the Hour-Index to 12. and the Quadrant of 
Altitude
 to the West-point of the 
Horizon:
 then turn the Globe Eastward, till the Centre of the 
Star
 be just under the edge of the Quadrant; then shall the Index point at 5 hours and 40 min. So that when 
Aldebaran
 is due East or West, he will be 5 hours 40 min. of time short of, or gone beyond the 
Meridian.




And when the Centre of 
Aldebaran
 is just under the Edge of the Quadrant of 
Altitude,
 you shall finde it to touch 20 deg. 21 min. And such is the

 over the Centre of the Star, and you shall finde it to lie under 12 deg. 18 min. of the Quadrant: and such is the 
Alti∣tude
 of 
Aldebaran.
 At the same time look what degrees of the

 THis is no other than the last. For having brought the Star to the 
Me∣ridian,
 and the Index to 12, move the Globe till it come to the designed hour. Then the 
Qua∣drant of Altitude
 being laid over the Star, shall at the same time shew you both the 
Altitude
 and 
Azimuth
 thereof as before. This needeth no Example.






PROB. XL. 
 Having the 
Azimuth
 of a Star, to finde at what horary distance that Star is from the

 that Star then hath.


 BRing the

 the 
Index
 to 12, and the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 to the 
Given Azimuth;
 then turn the Globe about till the Centre of the 
Star
 lie just under the 
Quadrant of Altitude;
 the 
Index
 at

 that time shall give the 
horary distance,
 and Qua∣drant the 
Altitude
 of the 
Star.


Example: Aldebaran
 being seen upon 80 de∣grees of 
Azimuth
 from the North-Westward, that is, neer upon the W. by N. Point of the Compass; the 
Star
 brought to the Meridian, and the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 to 80 degrees, and the 
Hour-Index
 to 12. If you bring the 
Star
 to the 
Quadrant of Altitude,
 you shall finde the 
Index
 to point at 6 hours, which is the 
Stars ho∣rary distance
 from the 
Meridian.
 And the 
Qua∣drant of Altitude
 will shew 12 deg. 18 min. the 
Altitude
 of 
Aldebaran
 at that time.








PROB. XLI.
 Concerning the Poetical Rising and Setting of the fixed Stars 
viz.


The



Cosmical


Acronical


Heliacal


 Rising and Setting.


And how to finde either of them by the Globes.




1.
 Of the 
Cosmical
 Rising and Setting.


 A Star is said to 
Rise Cosmically,
 wh
 it Riseth with the 
Sun,
 or with that degree of the Ecliptick in which the 
Sun
 then is And the 
Cosmical Setting
 is, when a Star settet
 in the Morning, or goeth down under the West-
Horizon
 in the Morning at such time as the 
Sun
 is Rising in the East.


 Upon the 27 of 
May,
 the 
Sun
 the
 being in 17 degrees of 
Gemini,
 I would know what Stars do then Rise and Set 
Cosmically.
 Re∣ctifie the Globe to your 
Latitude,
 and bring the 11 degree of 
Aquarius
 to the East-part of the 
Horizon:
 then look what Stars are about the edge of the Eastern Semi-circle of the 
Horizon,
 for a
 those Stars do that day Rise 
Cosmically.
 An
 those Stars which touch or are neer the Rim o


 the West Semi-circle of the 
Horizon
 do Set at that time 
Cosmically.
 So shall you finde


May
 27 {
Aldebaran
 or the 
Bulls eye,
 with divers other smal∣ler Stars,} Rising, and {The right leg of 
Serpentari∣us
 and seve∣ral other smaller Stars} Setting 
Cosmi∣cally.






2.
 Of the 
Acronical
 Rising and Setting of the Stars.


 A Star is said to Rise 
Acronically
 when it Riseth in the East-
Horizon,
 at such time as the 
Sun
 goes down or Sets in the West-
Horizon;
 and the 
Acronical
 Setting is when a Star goeth down under the 
Horizon
 with the 
Sun.


 Upon the 18 of 
October,
 in the 
La∣titude
 of 51 deg. 30 min. the 
Sun
 then being in 5 deg. of 
Scorpio,
 I would know what Stars do on that day Rise and Set 
Acronically.
 Rectifie the Globe to the 
Latitude,
 bringing the place of the 
Sun
 5 deg. of 
Scorpio
 to the West-part of the 
Horizon,
 then shall all those Stars which you see on the Verge of the East-side of the 
Horizon,
 be Ri∣sing 
Acronically.
 And all those that are about the Verge of the Western part of the 
Horizon
 are then Setting 
Acronically.
 And so upon the fore∣mentioned day, you shall finde


A Star in the 
Whales Tail,
 and several other smal∣ler Stars} Rising, and {The 
Tail
 of the 
Lyon,
 the South Ballance, and several other smaller Stars} Setting 
Acronically.








3.
 Of the 
Heliacal
 Rising and Setting of the Stars.


 A Star is said to 
Rise Heliacally,
 when having been some time combust, (or hid under the 
Sun-beams
) begins now to appear, it being at greater distance from the 
Sun.
 And a Star is said to 
Set Heliacally,
 which hath some small time before been seen, but now, by the neer approach of the 
Sun,
 becomes 
cumbust
 and hidden under his 
Beams.
 Now to know when a Star begins to become 
cumbust,
 & when to be freed from his 
cumbustment
 of the 
Sun-beams,
 no certain Rule can be given: for the 
Magnitude of the Star,
 the 
difference of the Climate,
 the 
cloudi∣ness
 or 
serenity
 of the 
Air
 may much alter. But the Opinion of the Ancient Astronomers was, that





 


 


 


deg.


 






A Star of the


1


Magnitude
 may be seen when the Sun is but


12


below the Horizon.






2


13

14






4


15






5


16






6


17






And those which are only Nebulous, cannot be seen till the 
Sun
 be 18 deg. under the 
Horizon.


 Rectifie the Globe to the 
Latitude,
 and the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 in the 
Zenith;
 then bring the given Star (suppose 
Regulus,
 or the

 
Lions Heart
) to the East-side of the Horizon, and the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 to the West-side; then 
Regulus
 being a Star of the First Magnitude (by the former Rule of the Ancients) may be seen when the 
Sun
 is but 12 deg. below the Ho∣rizon: wherefore see what degree of the Ecliptick do
h cut the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 in 12 degrees, which you shall finde to be 9 deg. of 
Pisces,
 the opposite degree to which is 9 deg. of 
Virgo;
 to which Signe and degree when the 
Sun
 cometh, (which will be about the 23 of 
August,
) then will 
Regulus,
 the Lions heart, 
Rise Heliacally:
 Then for the 
Heliacal Setting,
 bring the 
Star
 to the West-side of the Horizon, and turn the 
Qua∣drant of Altitude
 to the East-side, and see what degree of the Ecliptick is elevated upon the 
Qua∣drant,
 as the Magnitude of the 
Star
 you deal with doth require. For when the 
Sun
 comes to the opposite degree of the Ecliptick, that 
Star
 shall Set 
Heliacally.
 So





 


shall Rise 
Heliacal∣ly
 upon


and Set 
Heliacal∣ly

TRIGONOMETRICAL PROBLEMS. 




INTRODƲCTION.


SPherical Triangles
 are best represented by the 
Circles
 upon, and those appendant to, the 
Globes;
 with whose 
nature, affections,
 and 
uses,
 the 
Practitioner
 ought throughly to be acquainted, before he enter upon the 
Solution
 of such 
Triangles
 by the 
Canons
 or 
Tables,
 either of 
Natural
 or 
Artificial Sines
 and 
Tangents,
 or by other 
Instruments,
 as 
Projections, Planispheres,
 or the like; the 
Globe
 being the Original from whence all these do proceed. For by the true understanding of the Uses of the 
Globes,
 it will not be difficult to 
Project
 the Sphere 
in Plano
 upon any Circle, as I have in some measure taught how to do upon the Plain of the 
Meridian,
 in my 
Geometrical Exercises,
 and shall here farther illu∣strate by the Circles upon the 
Globe
 it self; upon which the 
Sides
 and 
Angles
 of all 
Spherical Tri∣angles,
 are most Naturally 
represented,
 and most Expeditiously 
measured.
 But before I come to the Practice hereof, give me leave to premise such general and necessary 
Definitions
 and 
Af∣fections,
 as do in any case belong to 
Spherical Triangles.
 And (1) Of such 
Lines
 or (rather) 
Arches of Circles,
 of which 
Spherical Triangles
 are 
framed
 and 
measured.
 (2) Of the 
Kindes, Parts


 and 
Affections
 of such 
Triangles
 so constituted: how the things given or required in them are represented upon the 
Globe;
 with the V
riety of 
Questions,
 that the solution of every 
Spherical Triangle
 will afford. With (3) The solution of several 
Problems
 for Practice.




Of the Definitions and Affections of 
Triangles.


1. ALl Triangles do consist of six parts, 
viz.
 of three 
Sides,
 and as many 
Angles.


2. The three sides of a Spherical Triangle do consist of three 
Arches
 of 
Great Circles
 of the 
Sphere
 or 
Globe,
 each 
A b
 being less than a 
Se∣mi-circle,
 or 180 deg.


3. A 
Great Circle
 of the Globe, is that which divideth the 
Globe
 into two equal parts; such are the 
Meridians, Equinoctial, Ecliptick,
 the 
Colures,
 &c.


4. The three 
Angles
 of a Spherical Triangle, are measured by three 
Arches
 of 
great Circles
 de∣scribed upon the three 
angular
 Points of the Triangle; and are either Right, Acute, or Obtuse.


5. A 
Right-angled Spherical Triangle,
 is that which hath either One, or more 
Right Angles,
 which contains 90 deg. An 
Ac e
-angled 
Sphe∣rical Triangle
 is that whose three Angles be all of them acute; that is, each of them less than 90 degrees.


6. An 
Obtuse Angle
 is that 
Spherical Triangle
 whose Angles are all obtuse, each exceeding 90 deg. or else mixt, some 
Obtuse
 and some 
Acute.


7. The Complement of a Side or Angle to a Quadrant or 90 deg. is so much as that Side or Angle wants of 90 degrees.


8. The Complement of a Side or Angle to a Semi-circle or 180 deg. is so much as that Side or Angle wants of 180 degrees.


9. All 
Spherical Triangles
 which have not 
One
 or more 
Right Angles,
 are called 
Oblique
 an∣gled Spherical Triangles.


Hence it followeth, That


1. If two 
Great Circles
 of the 
Sphere
 shall pass by each others 
Poles,
 those two Circles shall intersect each other at 
Right Angles.
 But


2. If two 
Great Circles
 of the 
Sphere
 do in∣tersect each other, and do not pass through each others 
Poles,
 those two Circles shall intersect each at other 
Oblique Angles.
 Thus



The General 
Meridian
 and the 
Horizon,


The 
Colures
 and the 
Eq inoctial


The 
Azimuth
 or Vertical Circles & the 
Ho∣rizon,


The 
Circle of Latitude
 and the 
Ecliptick,


 do intersect each other at 
Right Angles.


But



The 
Colures
 and the 
Horizon


The 
Vertical Circles
 and 
Equinoctial


The 
Circles of Longitude




Horizon,
 and the


Equinoctial




 do intersect each other at 
Oblique Angles.


And the Angles made by these oblique inter∣sections, are on the one side of the intersection 
Acute,
 and on the other side 
Obtuse.
 So


3. Two Arches of Great Circles intersecting each other, shall make on both sides the intersecti∣on,

 either two 
Right Angles
 or two 
Oblique Angles,
 the one 
Acute,
 the other 
Obtuse;
 of which, both of them being taken together, shall be equal to 
two Right Angles,
 or 180 degrees. Thus, in the 
Latitude
 of 51 deg. 30 min.





 


 


d. m.


 






The 
Meridian


intersecting with the 
Horizon
 doth make an 
Angle
 of


90.00


on the one side of the intersection,






The 
Ecliptick


62.00






The 
Equinoctial


38.30






 


 


d. m.


 






The 
Meridian


and an 
Angle
 of


90.00


on the other side of the intersection.






The 
Ecliptick


118.00






The 
Equinoctial


141.00




 And both the 
Angles
 on either side together, are equal to two 
Right Angles,
 or 180 degrees. But here note, That these Angles do Vary in every 
Latitude,
 and are not always the same.


4. If a 
Spherical Triangle
 have three 
Right Angles,
 the three sides of that 
Triangle
 shall be all 
Quadrants,
 each containing 90 deg. So (in a Parallel Sphere)


The 
Brass Meridian
 cutting the 
Horizon
 in the 
North
 and 
South
-points of the 
Horizon
 at Right Angles, and the 
Equinoctial Colure
 in the 
East
 and 
West
-points of the 
Horizon
 at Right Angles, and the 
Meridian
 and 
Colure
 intersecting each other in the 
Poles
 of the 
World,
 at Right Angles also: do constitute a 
Spherical Triangle
 with three 
Right Angles;
 and the three sides of this 
Triangle,
 (for this Reason) shall be all of them 
Quadrants:
 for upon the 
Meridian,
 between the 
Equinoctial
 (which is also the 
Horizon
 in a 
Parallel Sphere
) and the 
Pole,
 is contained 90 degrees: also upon the 
Colure
 between the 
Equinoctial
 and the 
Pole


 is also 90 degrees, and between the 
East
 and 
North
 or 
South
-points of the 
Horizon
 is also contained 90 degrees: So that the three 
Angles
 being 
Right Angles,
 the three 
Sides
 are also three 
Quadrants.


5. If a 
Spherical Triangle
 hath two 
Right Angles,
 the 
Sides
 opposite to those 
Angles
 shall be 
Quadrants;
 and the third side shall be the 
mea∣sure
 of the other 
Angle.
 Such Triangles as these do seldom come in Practice, for few or no 
Que∣stions
 can arise out of them; but of 
Right angled Spherical Triangles,
 those that have 
One Right,
 and 
Two Acute Angles,
 most 
Questions
 are re∣solvable by.


6. An 
Acute angled Spherical Triangle,
 hath all its sides less than 
Quadrants,
 or 90 degrees.


7. An 
Obtuse angled Triangle,
 having all its 
Angles Obtuse,
 hath all its Sid
s 
more
 than 
Qua∣drants:
 If mixt, the 
Side
 or 
Sides
 opposite to the 
Obtuse
 Angle or Angles shall be 
Greater,
 and the 
Side
 or Sides opposite to the 
Acute Angle
 or Angles shall be 
Less
 than 
Quadrants.


8. The 
Sides
 of Spherical Triangles, are of the same 
affeciion
 or 
kinde
 with their 
opposite An∣gles.


9. In 
Right-angled Spherical Triangles,
 the Side which is opposite to the 
Right Angle,
 I call the 
Hypotenuse;
 and the other two Sides which contain the 
Right Angle,
 I call the 
Sides
 or 
Legs.


10. In 
Oblique angled Spherical Triangles,
 I call the Sides Sides, and the Angles Angles, with∣out any other distinction.


11. In the Solution of 
Right-angled Spheri∣cal Triangles,
 there are usually 16 
Cases,
 which will all be reduced to 
Five;
 for that by the Globe

 three things are at once found. And in Oblique Angled Spherical Triangles, there are usual 12 Cases, which by the Globe will be reduced to 6; the Globe answering two at one Position.


Thus much of the 
Definitions
 and 
Affections
 of 
Spherical Triangles.






Of the Solution of 
Spherical Triangles
 upon the 
Globe.


IN the following Scheme or Figure of the 
Sphere
 or 
Globe,
 it being in an 
Oblique
 Position, 
viz.
 Elevated to the Latitude of 
London,
 51 deg. 30 min. you have upon the Superficies thereof di∣vers 
Spherical Lines
 and 
Circles,
 by the inter∣sections whereof, are constituted divers 
Spherical Triangles;
 some whereof are 
Right-angled,
 and others 
Oblique-angled:
 Of which I shall make use only of 
Two;
 one for the 
Five Cases
 of 
Right-angled Triangles,
 the other for the 
Six Cases
 of 
Oblique-angled Triangles.


The Triangle which I shall make use of for the 
Five Cases
 of 
Right-angled Triangles,
 shall be the Triangle P. O. ☉, Right-angled at O.




In which 
Right angled Spherical Triangle
 P. O. ☉.




The Side


P. ☉. being an Arch of the 
Brass Meridian,
 we suppose to be the Latitude of 
Lon∣don,
 51 deg. 30 min.


☉.O. being an Arch of the 
Horizon,
 we sup∣pose to be the 
Amplitude
 of the Sun's Rising or Setting, from the North-part of the 
Meridian
 56 deg. 40 min.


P.☉. being the Arch of another 
Meridian,
 or 
Hour-Circle,
 (which the 
Equinoctial Colure
 will best supply or represent) we suppose to be the 
Sun
's 
distance from the Pole,
 or the Complement of his 
Decli∣nation,
 70 deg. 00 min.






The Angle.


☉.P.O. is the 
hour from midnight,
 whose measure is to be reckoned upon the 
E∣quinoctial,
 between the 
Equinoctial Colure
 and the 
Brass Meridian,
 and will be 62 deg. 45 min. or in time 4 hours 11 min.


P.☉.O. is the 
Angle of the Sun
's 
Position
 at the time of the Question, whose measure is the Arch of a Great Circle, comprehen∣ded between the Complement of the side ☉. O. on the 
Horizon,
 and the Complement of the Side ☉. P. on the 
Equinoctial Colure;
 both those Sides be∣ing continued to Quadrants, on the contrary Side of the 
Brass Meridian,
 and will contain 56 deg. 39 min.


P.O.☉. is the 
Right Angle,
 whose measure is the deg. of the Quadrant of 
Altitude
 contained between the 
East
 or 
West
-points of the 
Horizon
 and the 
Zenith,
 which is 90 deg.






The several parts of the 
Triangle
 being thus declared, let us now proceed to the several 
Cases
 which arise out of this, and every 
Right-angled Spherical Triangle.








Of Right-angled Spherical Tri∣angles.




CASE I.
 The two 
Sides
 (or 
Legs
) P. O. 
51
 deg. 
30
 min. and ☉. O. 
56
 deg. 
40
 min. being given to finde the 
Hypotenuse
 P.☉. and the 
Angles
 ☉. P. O. and. P. ☉. O.


SEeing that the Side P. O. is an Acrh of the 
Brass Meridian,
 and contains 51 deg. 30 min. count thereupon from the 
Pole,
 51 deg. 30 min. and bring those degrees to the 
Horizon.
 Then the Side ☉. O. being an Arch of the 
Horizon,
 and contains 56 deg. 40 min. count upon the 
Horizon,
 from the 
Meridian,
 56 deg. 40 min. and turn the 
Globe
 about till the 
Equinoctial Colure
 do touch those degrees of the 
Horizon,
 so shall you have the true Triangle perfectly described upon the 
Globe
 it self: For from the 
Pole
 to the 
Hori∣zon,
 upon the 
Meridian,
 is equal to P. O. From the 
Horizon
 to the 
Pole,
 upon the 
Colure
 is equal to P. ☉. And from the 
Colure
 to the 
Meridian,
 upon the 
Horizon
 is equal to ☉. O. Now (1.) P. O. being 51 deg. 30 min. and O. ☉. 56 deg. 40 min. the degrees of the 
Colure
 counted from the 
Pole
 to the 
Horizon,
 will be found 70 degrees;

 for the 
Hypotenuse
 P. ☉. which was required. (2.) For the Angle ☉. P. O. count the degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 which are contained between the 
Colure
 and the 
Brass Meridian,
 and you shall finde them to be 62 deg. 45 min. or 4 hours 11 min. for the quantity of the Angle ☉. P. O. (3.) For the Angle P. ☉. O. count the Complement of ☉. P. 20 degrees upon the 
Equinoctial Colure,
 on the other Side of the 
Meridian
 (so shall that Point be distant from the Point ☉. 90 deg.) Al∣so, count the Complement of the Side ☉. O. 
viz.
 33 deg. 20 m. upon the 
Horizon,
 on the other Side of the 
Meridian,
 (which Point will be 90 deg. distant from the Point ☉. upon the 
Horizon
) So shall the distance between these two Points, (measured by the Quadrant of 
Altitude,
 or by Compasses) contain, 56 deg. 39 min. for the An∣gle P. ☉. O.


Or, This Angle P. ☉. O. may be otherwise found in the same manner as you found the An∣gle ☉. P. O. (but then you must alter the Posi∣tion of the 
Globe
) For, if you Elevate the 
Globe
 to 56 deg. 40 min. the Side ☉. O. and bring the 
Equinoctial Colure
 to 51 deg. 30 min. of the 
Ho∣rizon,
 which is the Side P. O. (for so have you turned the Triangle upside-down) then will the degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 intercepted between the 
Equinoctial Colure
 and the 
Brass Meridian,
 be 56 deg. 39 min. as before, and equal to the Angle P. ☉. O.


Or this is the usual Way taught by others, where∣by by the 
Globe
 must be often Rectified upon eve∣ry small occasion. But I embrace the first way,

 as being both 
Exact
 and 
Natural:
 but having declared both ways, I leave every one at liber∣ty to use that which he best liketh.


So by this one 
Data
 you have resolved three 
Problems
 of the Sphere: for you have found



3


1. The Side P. ☉. the Complement of the Suns D
clination 70 degrees.


2. The Angle ☉. P. O. the hour from Mid∣night 4 hours 11 minutes.


3. The Angle P. ☉. O. the Angle of the Suns position 56 degrees 39 minutes.








CASE. II.
 The 
Hypotenuse
 P. ☉. 
70
 degrees, and the 
Side
 (or 
Leg
) P. O. 
51
 deg. 
30
 min. being given; to finde the other 
Leg,
 O.☉. and the 
Angles
 ☉. P. O. and O. ☉.P.


THis 
Case
 differeth little from the former: for P. O. being an Arch of the 
Meridian,
 and containing 51 deg. 30 min. the 
Meridian
 being set thereto in the 
Horizon,
 turn the 
Globe
 about till 70 deg. of the 
Equinoctial Colure
 do touch the 
Horizon.
 So shall you finde the degrees of the 
Horizon
 intercepted between the 
Colure
 and the 
Meridian
 to be 56 deg. 40 min. for the Side ☉. O. The Angles at P. and ☉. are to be found in all respects by their measures, as in the former 
Case.


And by this one 
Data,
 you have resolved three

 other 
Problems
 of the 
Sphere,
 for by it you have found



6.


1. ☉. O. The Sun's 
Amplitude
 from the 
North,
 56 deg. 40 min.


2. ☉. P. O. The hour from midnight 62 d g. 45 min. or 4 h. 11 min.


3. P. ☉. O. The Angle of the Sun's posi∣tion, 56 deg. 39 min.



And if instead of Leg P. O. there had been given the Leg ☉. O. you might have then found [by bringing 70 degrees of the 
Equinoctial Colure,
 to meet with 56 deg. 40 min. of the 
Ho∣rizon
]




4. P. O. The Latitude 51 deg. 30 min.


5. ☉. P. O. The hour from midnight.


6. P. ☉. O. The Angle of the Sun's posi∣tion 56 deg. 39 min.








CASE III.
 The 
Hypotenuse
 P. ☉. 
70
 deg. and the 
An∣gle
 P. 
62
 deg. 
45
 min. at being given, to finde the two 
Legs
 P. O. and ☉. O. and the 
Angle
 P. ☉. O.


COunt the Angle P. 62 deg. 45 min. upon the 
Equinoctial
 from the 
Colure,
 and bring that point to the 
Brass Meridian,
 and there keep the 
Globe
 fast in the 
Meridian;
 then move the 
Brass Meridian
 upwards or downwards in the 
Hori∣zon,
 till 70. deg. of the 
Equinoctial Colure
 do

 justly touch the 
Horizon,
 then shall the 
Brass Me∣ridian
 rest in the 
Horizon;
 at 51 deg. 30 min. for the Side P. O. and the degrees of the 
Horizon
 intercepted between the 
Equinoctial Colure
 and the 
Meridian
 will be 56 deg. 40 min. for the Side ☉. O. and the distance between 33 deg. 20 min. of the 
Horizon,
 and 20 degrees of the 
E∣quinoctial Colure
 shall be 56 deg. 30 min. for the Angle P. ☉. O.


So that by this single 
Data
 there are also three other 
Problems
 resolved, 
viz.
 there is found



6.


1. The P. O. the 
Latitude
 51 deg. 30 min.


2. The Side ☉. O. the 
Amplitude
 from the 
North
 56 deg. 40 min.


3. The Angle P. ☉. O. the Angle of the 
Sun
's position.



And if instead of the Angle at P. the An∣gle at ☉. had been given you might then have found [by counting 20 deg. upon the 
Equinoctial Colure,
 and to that point apply 56 deg. 39 min. of the 
Quadrant of Altitude,
 (or a pair of Compasses opened to that distance.) then turn the 
Meridian
 in the 
Horizon,
 and the 
Globe
 about his 
Axis,
 till 70 deg. of the 
Colure
 and 00 deg. of the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 do touch the 
Ho∣rizon
 on either side of the 
Meridian:
 for then will the 
Meridian
 rest in the 
Hori∣zon,
 at 51 deg. 30 min.]




4. The Side ☉. O. the 
Amplitude
 from the 
North
 56 deg. 40 min.


5. The Side P. O. the 
Latitude
 51 d. 30 m.


6. The Angl
 ☉. P. O. the hour from mid∣night 62 deg. 45 min.










CASE IV.
 One 
Leg
 ☉. O. 
56
 deg. 
40
 min. and one 
An∣gle
 P. ☉. O. 
56
 deg. 
39.
 min. being given; to finde the Side P. O. the 
Hypotenuse
 P. ☉. and the 
Angle
 ☉. P. O.


COunt upon the 
Horizon
 from the 
Brass Me∣ridian
 56 deg. 40 min. the given Side (or Leg) ☉. O. also from the 
Brass Meridian,
 on the contrary side thereof, count 33 deg. 20 min. the Complement of ☉. O. to which degrees ap∣ply 00 deg. of the Quadrant of 
Altitude.
 Then move the 
Brass Meridian
 up and down in the 
Ho∣rizon,
 till the 
Equinoctial Colure
 cuts 56 deg. 40 min. and 56 deg. 39 min. of the Quadrant of 
Altitude
 do intersect the 
Colure.
 So will the 
Brass Meridian
 rest in the 
Horizon
 at 51 deg. 30 min. For the Side P. O. the 
Horizon
 will cut the 
Equinoctial Colure
 in 70 deg. For the 
Hypotenuse
 P. ☉. and the degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 inter∣cepted between the 
Equinoctial Colure
 and the 
Brass Meridian,
 will be 62 deg. 45 min. for the quantity of the Angle ☉. P. O. which was re∣quired.


And by this 
Data,
 there are three 
Problems
 re∣solved: for there is found



1


1. The Side P. O. the 
Latitude
 51 d. 30 m.


2. The Angle ☉. P, O. the hour from Mid∣night 62 deg. 45 min.


3. The Side P. ☉. the 
Sun
's distance from the 
Pole
 79 deg.





But if the 
Given Leg
 had been ☉. O. and the 
Given Angle
 ☉. P. O. [by counting the 
Angle
 P. upon the 
Equinoctial,
 and bringing that point to the 
Meridian,
 and moving the 
Meridian
 up and down in the 
Horizon,
 till the 
Equinoctial Colure
 did touch 56 deg. 40 min. of the 
Hori∣zon
] you should then have found




4. The 
Hypotenuse
 P. ☉. the 
Sun
's distance from the 
Pole
 70 deg.


5. The Side P. O. the 
Latitude
 51 d. 30 m.


6. The Angle P. ☉. O. the Angle of the 
Sun
's position 56 deg. 39 min.



Also, if the 
Hypotenuse
 P. ☉. and the 
Angle
 ☉. P. O. had been given [by counting the Angle ☉. P. O. upon the 
Equinocti∣al,
 and bringing if to the 
Meridian,
 and moving the 
Meridian
 in the 
Horizon,
 till 70 deg. of the 
Equinoctial Colure
 did touch the 
Horizon
] you might then find




7. The Side ☉. O. the 
Sun
's 
Amplitude
 from the 
North
 56 deg. 40 min.


8. The Side ☉. P. the 
Sun
's distance from the 
Pole
 70 deg.


9. The Angle P. ☉. O. the Angle of the 
Sun
's position 56 deg. 39 min.



And again, if the given Side (or Leg) had been P. O. and the Angle O. ☉. P. [by setting the 
Brass Meridian
 to 51 d. 30 m. in the 
Horizon,
 and turning the Body of the 
Globe
 about till the 
Equinoctial Colure
 and the 
Horizon
 do make an Angle of 56 deg. 39. min.] you might then find




10. The 
Hypotenuse
 P. ☉. the 
Sun
's distance from the 
Pole
 70 deg.




11. The Side ☉.O. the 
Sun
's 
Amplitude
 from the 
North
 56 deg. 40 min.


12. The Angle ☉. P. O. the hour from mid∣night 62 deg. 45 min.








CASE V.
 The two 
Acute Angles
 ☉. P. O. 
62
 deg. 
45
 min, and P. ☉. O. 
56
 deg. 
39
 min. being given, to finde the 
Side
 P. O. P. ☉. and ☉. O.


COunt the quantity of the Angle ☉. P. O. 62 deg. 45 min. upon the 
Equinoctial,
 from the 
Equinoctial Colure,
 bringing those degrees to the 
Meridian,
 and there fix the 
Globe;
 then move the 
Meridian
 upward or downward in the 
Hori∣zon,
 till the intersection of the 
Equinoctial
 with the 
Horizon
 do make an Angle of 56 deg. 39 min. So shall the Side P. O. be found to be 51 deg. 30 min. the 
Leg
 ☉. P. 56. deg. 40 min. and the 
Hypotenuse
 P. ☉. 70 deg.


And from this 
Data,
 three 
Problems
 are re∣solved: for you have found



3.


1. The Side P. O. the 
Latitude
 51 d. 30 m.


2. The Side ☉. P. the 
Amplitude
 from the 
North
 56 deg. 40 min.


3. The 
Hypotenuse
 P. ☉. the 
Sun
's distance from the 
Pole
 70 deg.




This last 
Case
 may best be resolved by chang∣ing of the 
Angles
 into 
Sides,
 as shall be hereafter taught.




These are the 
Five Cases
 of 
Right-angled Spherical Triangles:
 And here you see that in this one 
Right-angled Spherical Triangle,
 by the seve∣ral 
Parts given
 in these 
Five Cases,
 there are 30 
Spherical Problems
 resolved: Namely, 3 by the 
First Case,
 6 by the 
Second Case,
 6 by the 
Third Case,
 12 by the 
Fourth Case,
 and 3 by the 
Fifth Case.
 And so many are resolvable in every 
Right-angled Spherical Triangle.








Of Oblique-angled Spherical Tri∣angles.


THe 
Triangle
 which I shall make use of for the resolving of the 
Six Cases
 of 
Oblique-angled Spherical Triangles,
 shall be the Oblique Triangle Z. P. E. Obtuse angled at Z.


In which Triangle



The Side


Z. P. being an Arch of the 
Brass Meridian,
 we will suppose to be the 
Complement of the Latitude
 of 
London,
 containing 38 deg. 30 min.


P. E. being an Arch of a 
Meridian
 (or 
Hour-Circle
) we will suppose to be the 
Sun
's 
distance from the Pole,
 or the 
Complement of the Sun's Declination
 Northward 70 deg.


Z. E. being an Arch of an 
Azimuth
 (or 
Ver∣tical Circle
) let be the Complement of the 
Sun
's, or a 
Star
's 
Altitude,
 and to con∣tain 47 deg. 12 min.








The Angle


Z. P. E. is the 
hour from Noon,
 whose 
measure
 is to be reckoned upon the 
Equinoctial,
 between the 
Equinoctial Colure
 and the 
Brass Meridian,
 and will be found to be 45 deg. or 
3 ho. in time.


E. Z. P. is the 
Sun
's 
Azimuth
 from the 
North
-part of the 
Meridian,
 and is to be 
measu∣red
 upon the 
Horizon
 between the North-part of the 
Brass Meridian,
 and the 
Qua∣drant of Altitude,
 and will be found to be 15 deg. 25 min.


Z. E. P. is the 
Angle of the Sun
's 
Position
 at the time of the Question, and may be measured either by turning of the 
Qua∣drant of Altitude
 to the contrary side of the 
Meridian,
 and counting thereupon the Complement of the side E. Z. 42 deg. 48 min. and the Complement of the side Z. P. 20 deg. upon the 
Colure;
 and the distance of these two Points shall be the 
measure
 of the Angle Z. E. P. which will be found to contain 36 deg. 52 min. Or you may turn the 
Triangle,
 and place Z. E. in the place where before Z. P. was placed, and then may that Angle be mea∣sured upon the 
Equinoctial
 between the 
Colure
 and the 
Brass Meridian,
 as the An∣gle Z. P. E. was.






The several 
Sides
 and 
Angles
 of this 
Triangle
 being discovered, I will now come to shew the several 
Cases
 which will arise out of this, and every 
Oblique Spherical Triangle:
 But first let me shew you




How to express the 
Triangle
 upon the 
Globe.


Elevate the 
Pole
 of the 
Globe
 to the Comple∣ment of any of the Sides of the 
Triangle,
 as in this 
Example,
 to 51 deg. 30 min. (which i
 the Complement of the Side Z. P.) then count the Side Z. P. 38 deg. 30 min. from the 
Pole,
 and thereto screw the 
Quadrant of Altitude.
 This done, count the Side E. P. 70 deg. upon the 
E∣quinoctial Colure
 from the 
Pole,
 and the Side Z. E. upon the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 from the 
Zenith
 downward, and so move the 
Globe
 and 
Quadrant of Altitude
 together, till the numbers counted upon both of them concur in one Point; and so shall you have your 
Triangle
 exactly delineated upon the 
Globe;
 which being done, I proceed to the 
Six Cases
 of 
Oblique-angled Spherical Tri∣angles,
 and to shew the 
Variety
 of 
Problems
 that will naturally arise out of the solving of every such 
Oblique Triangle.








CASE I.
 The 
Side
 Z. P. 
38
 deg. 
30
 min. The 
Side
 E. P. 
70
 deg. and the 
Side
 Z. E. 
47
 deg. 
12
 min. being given, to finde the 
Angles,


ELevate the 
Globe
 to the 51 deg. 30 min. the Complement of Z. P. and count the Side Z. P. the Complement of the 
Latitude
 38 deg. 30 min. from P. to Z. and there fasten the 
Quadrant of Altitude.
 Then count the Side E. P. the Com∣plement of the 
Sun
's declination 70 deg. upon the 
Colure
 from the 
Pole
 downwards: Also count the Complement of the 
Sun
's 
Altitude
 47 deg. 12 min. The Side Z. E. upon the 
Qua∣drant of Altitude
 downwards; and move the 
Globe
 and 
Quadrant
 together till 70 deg. of the 
Colure,
 and 47 deg. 12 min. of the 
Quadrant
 do meet: So is your 
Triangle
 represented upon the 
Globe.


Now to finde the several 
Angles.
 (1.) For the 
Angle
 at Z. count the number of degrees of the 
Horizon,
 which are contained between the North-part of the 
Meridian,
 and the 
Quadrant of Alti∣tude;
 and you shall finde them to be 115 deg. 35 min. and that is the quantity of the Angle E. Z. P. and is the 
Sun
's 
Azimuth
 from the North-part of the 
Meridian.
 (2.) For the 
Angle
 Z.P.E. count the number of degrees of the 
Equinoctial,
 which are contained between the South-part of the 
Meridian
 and the 
Colure;
 which you will finde to be 45 deg. and that is the quantity of the An∣gle

 Z. P. E. which is the hour from Noon, name∣ly 9 in the Morning, or 3 in the Afternoon- (3.) For the 
Angle
 Z. E. P. (either change the 
Triangle
 by elevating the 
Globe
 anew, or) count 42 deg. 48 min. the Complement of Z. E. upon the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 (it being brought to the other side of the 
Meridian
) and also count the 20 deg. the Complement of E. P. upon the 
Colure
 (on the other side of the 
Meridian
) the distance between these two points, measured by Compasses or otherwise, will be found to contain 36 deg. 52 min. equal to the Angle Z. E. P. which is the Angle of the 
Sun
's or 
Stars
 position at the time of the Question.


And thus by this one 
Data,
 you have resolved three 
Problems:
 For you have found



3.


1. The Angle E. Z. P. the 
Sun
's 
Azimuth
 115 deg. 35 min.


2. The Angle Z. P. E. the hour 45 deg. or 9, or 3 a clock.


3. The Angle Z. E. P. the 
Sun
's Angle of position 36 deg. 52. min.










CASE II.
 The two 
Sides
 E.Z. 
47
 deg. 
12
 min. Z.P. 
38
 deg. 
30
 min. and the 
Angle
 comprehen∣ded between them being given, to finde the other parts of the Triangle,


COunt P. Z. 38 deg. 30 min. (the 
Globe
 be∣ing elevated to the Complement thereof) upon the 
Meridian,
 from P. to Z. and there fix the 
Quadrant of Altitude:
 Then from the North-part of the 
Meridian
 upon the 
Horizon,
 count the quantity of the Angle E. Z. P. 115 deg. 35 min. and thereto bring the 
Quadrant of Altitude:
 Then count the other given Side E. Z. 47 deg. 12 min. upon the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 down∣wards; and turn the 
Globe
 about till the 
Equi∣noctial Colure
 cut the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 in 47 deg. 12 min. So is your 
Triangle
 delineated up∣on the 
Globe.


Now to finde the several Parts. (1.) The degrees of the 
Colure
 contained between the 
Pole
 and the 
Quadrant
 being 70, is the Side E. P. (2.) The degrees of the 
Horizon
 between the 
Meridian
 and 
Quadrant,
 being 115 deg. 35 min. is the Angle E. Z. P, And (3.) The distance be∣tween the Complement of E. Z. upon the 
Qua∣drant of Altitude,
 and the Complement of E P. up∣on the 
Colure
 (they being both continued to 
Qua∣drants,
 on the other Side of the 
Meridian
) will be found 36 degrees 52 minutes, which is the Angle Z. E. P.




Thus by this 
Data
 you have found



9.


1. E. P. The Complement of the 
Sun
's 
De∣clination.


2. E. Z. P. The 
Sun
's 
Azimuth
 from the North.


3. Z. E. P. The Angle of the 
Suns
 or 
Stars Position.




But if the 
Sides
 Z. P. P.E. and 
Angle
 Z. P. E. had been given, there would then have been found




4. P. E. Z. The 
Angle
 of 
Position.


5. E. Z. The Com
ment of the 
Sun
's 
Al∣titude.


6. E. Z. P. The 
Azimuth
 from the North.



Or if the 
Sides
 Z. E. P. E. and 
Angle
 Z. E. P. had been given, there would then be found




7. E. Z. P. The 
Sun
's 
Azimuth
 from the North.


8. Z. P. The Complement of the 
Lati∣tude.


9. Z. P. E. The 
Hour
 from Noon.










CASE III.
 The two 
Angles
 E. Z. P. 
154
 deg. 
25
 min. and Z.P.E. 
45
 deg. with the 
Side
 Z.P. 
38
 deg. 
30
 min. comprehended between them, given, to finde the other parts of the 
Triangle,


COunt 38 deg. 30 min. the Side Z. P. upon the 
Meridian
 from the 
Pole,
 and thereto screw the 
Quadrant of Altitude;
 then count 45 deg. the Angle Z. P. E. upon the 
Equinoctial,
 (be∣ginning at the 
Colure
) and bring those 45 deg. to the South-part of the 
Brass Meridian.
 Again, count 115 deg. 35 min. the Angle E. Z. P. upon the 
Horizon,
 from the North-part of the 
Meri∣dian,
 and thereto bring the 
Quadrant of Altitude.
 And so have you represented your 
Triangle
 upon the 
Globe.


Now to finde the other Sides, and Angle. (1.) The degrees contained between the 
Pole
 and the 
Colure
 upon the 
Quadrant;
 namely, 47 deg. 12 min. will be the Side Z. E. (2.) And the degrees between the 
Pole
 and the 
Quadrant
 upon the 
Colure,
 viz. 70, will be the Side E. P. (3.) And the distance between the Complements of the Sides E. Z. and E. P. being continued to Qua∣drants on the other Side of the 
Meridian;
 name∣ly, 36 deg. 52 min. will be the Angle Z. E. P.




And by this 
Data,
 you have found



9.


1. Z. E. The Complement of the 
Sun
's 
Al∣titude.


2. E. P. The distance of the 
Sun from the Pole.


3. Z. E. P. The Angle of the 
Sun
's 
Posi∣tion.




But if the 
Side
 E. P. and the 
Angle
 Z. E. P. and Z. P. O. had been given, there would have been found.




4. E. Z. The Complement of the 
Sun
 or 
Stars Altitude.


5. E. Z. P. The 
Sun
's or 
Stars Azimuth
 from the North.


6. Z. P. The Complement of the 
Latitude.
 And if the 
Side
 Z. E. and the 
Angles
 P. Z. E. and P. E. Z. had been given, you might then finde


7. Z. P. The Complement of the 
Latitude.


8. Z. P. E. The 
Hour
 from Noon.


9. P. E. The Complement of the 
Sun
's or 
Stars Declination.










CASE IV.
 The two 
Sides
 Z. P. 
38
 deg. 
30
 min. and E. P. 
70
 deg. with the 
Angle
 Z. E. P. 
36
 deg. 
52
 min. being given, to finde the other 
Side
 and 
Angles.


TO resolve this 
Case,
 you may (if you please) revert the 
Triangle,
 by elevating the 
Globe
 to 20 deg. the Complement of the given Side P. E. then counting 70 deg. the Side E. P. upon the 
Meridian
 from the 
Pole,
 there screw the 
Qua∣drant of Altitude.
 Then upon the 
Horizon,
 count 36 deg. 52 min. the given Angle 
E.
 and to them bring the 
Quadrant of Altitude.
 So have you fixed the Angle Z. E. P. Then turn the 
Globe
 about, till 38 deg. 30 min. the other given Side P. Z. do touch the 
Quadrant,
 which it will do in 47 deg. 12 min. for the Side E. Z. And for the Angle P. the degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 between the 
Meridian
 and the 
Colure,
 viz. 45, is the An∣gle at P. and for the Angle at Z. it may be found by reverting of the Triangle again, or by the Complements of the Sides extended on the other side of the 
Meridian,
 as hath been before taught. Lastly, for the Side E. Z. you have it upon the 
Quadrant
 47 deg. 12 min.


The 
Triangle
 being thus delineated, you have found (1.) the Side E. Z. 47 deg. 12 min. (2.) the Angle P. 45 deg. (3.) the Angle E. Z. P. 154 deg. 25 min.




¶ I thought good in this place to insert this man∣ner of Change, not only for variety, but because in this and the next 
Case
 the 
Triangle
 may be more readily delineated upon the 
Globe.


And in this one 
Data
 you have found



18


1. E. Z. The Complem. of the 
Sun
's 
Altitude.


2. Z. P. E. The 
hour
 from Noon.


3. E. Z. P. The 
Azimuth
 of the 
Sun
 or a 
Star
 from the North.



But if the 
Sides
 Z. P. and E. P. and the 
Angle
 E. Z. P. had been given, you would then have found




4. E. Z. The Complement of the 
Suns
 or 
Stars Altitude.


5. Z. E. P. The Angle of the 
Suns
 or 
Stars Position.


6. Z P. E. The 
hour
 from Noon.



And if there had been given E. P. E. Z. and E.Z.P. then would have been found




7. Z P. The Complement of the 
Latitude.


8. Z. P. E. The 
hour
 from Noon.


9. Z. E. P. The 
Angle of Position.




In like manner, if P.E. E.Z. and Z.P.E. had been given, you would have found




10. Z. P. The Complement of the 
Latitude.


11. E. Z. P. The 
Azimuth
 from the North.


12. Z. E. P. The Angle of 
Position.




Again, if there had been given E.Z. Z.P. and Z. P. E. you might then finde




13. P. E. The 
Sun
's 
distance
 from the 
Pole.


14. Z.E.P. The 
Angle
 of 
Position.


15. E. Z. P. The 
Azimuth
 from the North.





Lastly, If E. Z. and Z. P. and the 
Angle
 Z. E. P. had been given, there would have been found




16. P. E. The Complement of the 
Suns
 or 
Stars declination.


17. Z. P. E. The 
hour
 from Noon.


18. E. Z. P. The 
Azimuth
 from the North.








CASE V.
 The two 
Angles
 E. Z. P. 
115
 deg. 
35
 min. Z. P. E. 
45
 deg. with the 
Side
 P. E. 
70
 deg. being given, to finde the rest of the 
Triangle,


ELevate the 
Globe
 to 20 deg. the Complement of the Side E. P. Then count the given Side E. P. 70 deg. upon the 
Meridian,
 from P. to Z. and there six the Quadrant. Then the gi∣ven Angle E. P. Z. being 45 deg. count 45 deg. upon the 
Equinoctial
 from the 
Colure,
 and bring that point under the 
Meridian:
 So have you constituted the Side E. P. and the Angle E. P Z. Now for the Angle E. Z. P. you must either re∣vert the Triangle again, or finde it by the Com∣plements of the Sides Z. E. and Z P. extended to Quadrants on the other side of the 
Meridian,
 which you shall finde to be 115 deg. 35 min.


The 
Triangle
 thus constituted, (1.) For the Side Z. P. the degrees of the 
Colure
 between the 
Pole
 and the 
Quadrant
 being 38 deg. 30 min. is that Side. (2.) The degrees of the 
Quadrant of Altitude,
 between the 
Zenith
 and the 
Colure,


 being 47 deg. 12 min. is the Side E. Z. (3.) The degrees of the 
Horizon
 between the 
Meridian
 and the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 being 36 deg. 52 min. is the quantity of the Angle Z. E. P.


By which single 
Data,
 you have found



18


1. Z. P. The Complement of the 
Latitude.


2. E. Z. The Complement of the 
Altitude.


3. Z. E. P. The 
Angle
 of 
Position.




But if the 
Angles
 E. Z. P. Z. P. E. and the 
Side
 Z. E. had been given, then might you finde




4. Z. P. The Complement of the 
Latitude.


5. P. E. The 
Sun
's 
distance from the Pole.


6. Z. E. P. The 
Angle
 of 
Position.




Or had there been given Z. P. E. Z. E. P. and the 
Side
 E. P. you might from thence finde




7. Z. P. The Complement of the 
Latitude.


8. E. P. The Complement of the 
Sun
 or 
Stars declination.


9. E. Z. P. The 
Sun
's 
Azimuth
 from the North.



And if the 
Ang

 Z. P. E. Z. E. P. with the 
Side
 Z. P. had been given, then would have been found




10. Z. E. The Complement of the 
Sun
's 
Altitude.


11. P. E. The 
Sun
's 
distance
 from the 
Pole.


12. E. Z. P. The 
Sun
's 
Azimuth
 from the North.



But if the 
Angles
 Z. E. P. E. Z. P. and

 the 
Side

13. Z. E. The 
Suns distance
 from the 
Zenith.


14. P. E. The 
Suns distance
 from the 
Pole.


15. Z. P. E. The 
hour
 from Noon.



And lastly, had there been given the 
An∣gles
 Z. E. P. E. Z. P. and the 
Side
 P. F. then might be found




16. Z. E. The Complement of the 
Suns
 or 
Stars Altitude.


17. Z. P. The Complement of the 
Latitude.


18. Z. P. E. The 
hour
 from Noon.








CASE VI.
 The three 
Angles
 E. Z. P. 
115
 deg. 
35
 min. the 
Angle
 E. P. Z. 
45
 deg. and the 
An∣gle
 Z. E. P. 
36
 deg. 
52
 min. being given, to finde the three 
Sides.


THis 
Case
 may best be resolved by turning the 
Angles
 of the 
Triangle
 into 
Sides,
 as shall be taught by and by: and so by this 
Data,
 you may finde



1. Z. E. The Complement of the 
Suns Alti∣tude.


2. Z. P. The Complement of the 
Latitude.


3. E. P. The Complement of the 
Suns declina∣tion.




And thus have you out of this one 
Oblique Sphe∣rical Triangle,
 by the variety that these 
Six Cases
 afford, no less than 
Threescore Problems


 resolved, 
viz.
 3 in the 
First Case,
 9 in the 
Second Case,
 9 in the 
Third Case,
 18 in the 
Fourth Case,
 18 in the 
Fifth Case,
 and 3 in the 
Sixth Case;
 in all 60. And so many 
Varieties
 or 
Changes
 are there in every 
Oblique-angled Spherical Triangle.
 — And besides these 
Va∣rieties,
 this 
Triangle
 Z E P. is not peculiar on∣ly to the appellations that I have here given them, but to other purposes also. For,


This 
Oblique-angled Triangle
 is not capable only of resolving the forementioned 
Astronomical Questions,
 but may be applied to 
Geographical
 or 
Nautical Questions
 also. For,



1. The 
Side
 Z P, may represent the Complement of the 
Latitude
 of that 
Town
 or 
Citie
 whose 
Zenith
-point is Z.


2. The 
Side
 E Z, may represent the 
distance
 between those two 
Cities
 or 
Towns.


3. The 
Side
 P E will be the Complement of the 
Latitude
 of that 
City
 or 
Town
 at E.


4. The 
Angle
 E P Z, is the 
difference of Longitude
 between the two 
places
 E and Z.


5. The 
Angle
 P Z E, the 
Point
 of the 
Compass
 leading from Z to E.


6. The 
Angle
 P E Z, the 
Point
 of the 
Compass
 leading from E to Z.




And in this 
Triangle
 the same things being gi∣ven, they may be 
varied
 as before, and afford as many 
Questions
 in 
Geography
 or 
Navigation
 as in 
Astronomy:
 Namely 60.


Moreover, In the same 
Triangle,
 if you imagine

 the 
Side
 P Z to be 23 deg. 30 min. the 
distance
 of the 
Pole
 of the 
World,
 from the 
Pole
 of the 
Ecliptick:
 Then will



1. The 
Side
 Z P, be the 
distance
 of the 
Pole
 of the 
World
 from the 
Pole
 of the 
Ecliptick.


2. The 
Side
 P E will be the 
Complement
 of the 
declination
 of a 
Star
 at E.


3. The 
Side
 Z E, will be the 
Northern Latitude
 of the 
Star
 at E.


4. The 
Angle
 E P Z. will be the 
Complement
 of the 
Stars Right Ascension.


5. The 
Angle
 P Z E, is the quantitie of the 
Stars Longitude.


6. The 
Angle
 P E Z, is the 
Angle
 of the 
Stars Position.




And this way it will afford 60 Varieties more, as is before intimated.










Theorem.


The Sides of any 
Spherical Triangle,
 may be turned into 
Angles; & contra,
 the Complement of the Greatest Side, or Greatest Angle (to a Semicircle) be∣ing taken for the Greatest Side, or Grea∣test Angle.




Demonstration.


LEt A B C, be a 
Spherical Triangle
 Obtuse-angled at B. And let



D E be the Measure of the Angle A


H I be the Measure of the Angle C


G F be the Measure of the Angle B


 
viz.
 of its Comple∣ment, F B G, it being the Angle of the 
Triangle.


Now,



K L is equal to D E


L M is equal to F G


K M is equal to H I




Because



K D and L E are Quadrants, and their Common Complement is L D


L G and F M are Quadrants, and their Common Complement is L F


K I and M H are Quadrants, and their Common Complement is K H.




Therefore,


The 
Sides
 of the 
Triangle
 K L M, are equal to the 
Angles
 of the 
Triangle
 A B C, taking for the 
Greatest Angle
 A B C, the Complement thereof F B G.




It may also be 
demonstrated,
 That the 
Sides
 of the 
Triangle
 A B C, are equal to the 
Angles
 of the 
Triangle
 K L M, by the converse of the for∣mer. 
For




The side A B is e∣qual to O P the mea∣sure of the Angle M L K.


The side B C is e∣qual to F H the mea∣sure of the Angle L M K.


The side A C is e∣qual to D I the mea∣sure of the Angle D K I.


 of the Complement of the Obtuse Angle D K I.


For,



A D and C I are Quadrants, & their Common Complement is C D


A P and O B are Quadrants, & their Common Complement is A O


B F and C H are Quadrants, & their Common Complement is C F.




Therefore, 
The
 Sides 
may be turned into
 Angles, 
and the contrary;
 which was to be demonstra∣ted. And by this Conversion, may the 5th Case of 
Right,
 and the 6th Case of 
Oblique Spherical Triangles
 be resolved.








How a 
Perpendicular
 is to be let fall in any Oblique Spherical Triangle, thereby dividing it into two Right-angled Tri∣angles.


THis 
Problem
 is not of any Use in the Soluti∣on of 
Triangles
 by the 
Globe,
 as is evident

 by what hath been already delivered concerning the Solving of them: But for that in 
Trigono∣metrical Calculations,
 there is a necessity for so doing, and the doing of it no less difficult to conceive or imagine; and seeing how naturally, and lively it is represented upon the 
Globe,
 I will therefore here insert it. And it is grounded upon the First 
Theorem
 at the beginning of this Tract of 
Trigonometry. Viz.


If two
 Great Circles 
of the
 Sphere 
shall pass through each others
 Poles, 
those two
 Circles 
shall cut each the other at
 Right Angles.


In the 
Oblique-angled Triangle
 Z E P, before made use of, let there be given, (1.) the 
Side
 P Z. (2.) The 
Side
 E Z, and (3.) The 
An∣gle
 E P Z. and let it be required to finde the 
Side
 P E. This 
Problem
 is done by the 
Globes,
 by the 4th 
Case,
 as you may there see, without the help of any 
Perpendicular;
 but in 
Calculation
 it is wholly necessary, and therefore may well de∣serve the place of a 
Problem
 here.


The 
Triangle
 being described upon the 
Globe,
 let it be required to let fall a 
Perpendicular
 from the 
Angle
 Z, upon the 
Side
 E P: The Measure of the 
Given Angle
 P, being upon the 
Equinoctial,
 see upon the 
Globe
 where the 
Side
 P E (being extended) cuts the 
Equinoctial,
 and from that Point count 90 degrees upon the 
Equinoctial,
 and that Point shall be the 
Pole
 of the 
Circle
 (P E.) (
For the Poles of all Great Circles are a Quadrant, or
 90 
degrees distant from their Peripheries:
) wherefore the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 being fixed

 in Z, bring it to this Point found in the 
Equi∣noctial,
 and then will it cut the 
Side
 E P in the Point where the 
Perpendicular
 must fall, which will be at K, 29 degrees 21 minutes distant from P.






CONCLUSION.


IN the foregoing 
Precepts,
 I have made use on∣ly of two 
Triangles
 for the Solution of the 
Five Cases
 of 
Right,
 and the 
Six Cases
 of 
Oblique-angled Spherical Triangles;
 namely, of the 
Tri∣angle
 P ☉ ☉ for 
Right-angled,
 and Z E P for 
Oblique-angled.
 Yet in the Figure of the 
Globe
 by the intersection of the several 
Circles
 thereof, there are divers other 
Triangles
 (both 
Right
 and 
Oblique
) constituted, all which the foregoing 
Rules
 and 
Cases
 will sufficiently 
Solve.
 A few of the Principal I will mark in the 
Globe
 by nu∣merical 
Figures,
 for distinction, and give you an account of what 
Circles
 they are composed, and what 
Questions
 of the 
Globe
 are 
Resolvable
 there∣by.


The 
Triangle
 that I have made use of for 
Right-angled Triangles,
 viz. P ☉ O, I have mar∣ked with the Figure 1. And the 
Oblique Tri∣angle

Thus have you an account of 
Four
 other 
Right-angled Spherical Triangles,
 with the 
Affections
 or 
Natures
 of their Respective 
Sides
 and 
Angles;
 out of each of which, by the Varieties that will arise from the 
Five Cases,
 may be deduced 30 
Problems,
 and in all the 
Four Triangles
 120 
Prob∣lems,
 all which may be performed according to the Directions of the 
Five Cases
 of 
Right-angled Spherical Triangles;
 the Exercising whereof I leave to the Practitioner. — There are divers o∣ther 
Triangles
 may be found both 
Right
 and 
Ob∣lique-angled,
 but these as the principal I com∣mend to the 
Practice
 of the young 
Tyro.










HOROLOGIOGRAPHICAL Problems. 




INTRODƲCTION.
 Of the distinction of Plains, upon which 
Dials
 are to be made.


ALl Plains upon which 
Dials
 are made, in any 
Latitude
 or part of the World, do either lie 1. 
Parallel
 to the 
Horizon,
 or 2. are 
Perpendicular
 to the 
Horizon,
 or 3. do cut the 
Horizon
 at 
Oblique Angles:
 and of these sorts of Plains there are several 
Varieties,
 excepting the first.


1. A Plain that lieth 
Parallel
 to the 
Horizon,
 is said to be an 
Horizontal
 Plain; and of this kinde there is no Variety.


2. Of Plains that are 
Perpendicular
 to the 
Ho∣rizon
 there are Two Varieties: For,


First, If the Plain which is 
Perpendicular
 to the 
Horizon,
 do stand directly in the 
Azimuth,
 or 
Vertical-Circle,
 of 
East
 and 
West,
 the two Faces thereof beholding one the 
South,
 and the other the 
North
 — Or if the 
Perpendicular
 Plain do stand in the 
Meridian
 of the Place, that is, in the 
Azimuth
 of 
North
 and 
South,
 and so the two Faces thereof do behold the 
East
 and 
West
 —

Fig. 5.


depiction of the geometric construction of a direct west reclining dial as described on page 151






Fig. 6.


depiction of the geometric construction of a north or south reclining plane as described on page 155








 Such Plains are called 
direct Vertical
 Plains, be∣cause they have a direct respect to the four Car∣dinal Points of Heaven, 
viz.
 the 
East, West, North,
 and 
South.
 But


Secondly, If any such 
Perpendicular
 Plain do stand in any other 
Azimuth
 or 
Vertical-Circle
 be∣tween the 
South
 and the 
East,
 or the 
North
 and the 
West,
 so that one Face beholdeth the 
South-East,
 and its opposite the 
North-West;
 then these Plains are called 
Vertical Plains declining
 from the 
North
 or 
South,
 towards either the 
East
 or 
West.


3. Of Plains that cut the 
Horizon
 at 
Oblique Angles,
 and yet do lie directly in the prime 
Ver∣tical Circle,
 or 
Azimuth
 of 
East
 or 
West,
 there are six 
Varieties.
 For


First, A plain beholding the 
South,
 may fall back, (or Recline) from the 
Zenith,
 just into the 
Pole,
 and then will the Plain lie 
Parallel
 to the 
Axis
 of the World, and such a Plain is called a 
Polar Plain.


Secondly, It may so fall back (or Recline) from the 
Zenith,
 that it may fall between the 
Zenith
 and the 
Pole,
 or between the 
Pole
 and the 
Horizon;
 and these three sorts are called 
South Reclining Plains.


Reclining



equal to


less than


more than


 the 
Pole
 or 
Co-Latitude
 of the Place.


Thirdly, A Plain beholding the 
North,
 may fall back (or Recline) from the 
Zenith
 equal to the 
Equinoctial,
 and so the Plain will lie 
parallel
 to

 the 
Equinoctial Circle,
 and is therefore called an 
Equinoctial Plain.


Fourthly, It may so fall back (or Recline) that it shall rest between the 
Zenith
 and the 
E∣quinoctial,
 or between the 
Equinoctial
 and the 
Ho∣rizon;
 and these three sorts are called 
North-re∣clining Plains.


Reclining



equal to


less than


more than


 the 
Equinoctial,
 or 
Latitude
 of the Place.


Fifthly, Of Plains that cut the 
Horizon
 at 
Ob∣lique Angles,
 and do lie directly in the 
Meridian
 or 
Azimuth
 of 
North
 and 
South,
 there is only one Variety: for all such Plains will fall between the 
Zenith,
 and the 
East
 or 
West
-points of the 
Hori∣zon;
 and so are called 
East
 or 
West Recliners.


Sixthly, Of Plains that cut the 
Horizon
 at 
Oblique Angles,
 and do not lie in the prime 
Ver∣tical-Circle
 or 
Azimuth
 of 
East
 and 
West,
 but in some other intermediate 
Azimuth
 or 
Vertical-Circle
 between the 
South
 and the 
East
 or 
West;
 there are also of those six Varieties: — And of these, those that behold the 
South,
 are called 
South-Recliners,
 declining 
East
 or 
West:
 — And those that behold the 
North,
 are called 
North-Recliners,
 declining either 
East
 or 
West.




Now of these six sorts, all Plains besides the forementioned must necessarily be one of these following: For,


1. The South Re∣clining Plain, by reason of its De∣clination, may so chance as to fall



Just into the 
Pole-point,
 and so is called a 
Polar declining Plain.


Between the 
Zenith
 and the 
Pole.


Between the 
Pole
 and the 
Hori∣zon.




And these are called 
South Declining Plains.


Reclining



equal to


less than


more than


 the Pole.


2. The North Re∣clining Plain, by reason of its De∣clination, may so chance as to fall



Just at the Intersection of the 
Meridian
 with the 
Equinoctial.


Between the 
Zenith
 and 
Equinoctial.


Between the 
Horizon
 and the 
Equi∣noctial.




And these are called 
North Declining Plains.


Reclining



equal to


less than


more than


 the Equinoctial.


Seventhly, All Plains that do Decline and Re∣cline also, have their opposite Faces, and those are called 
North
 or 
South Declining Inclining Plains;
 and the same 
Dial
 that serves for a 
South Decli∣ning Reclining Plain,
 will serve also for a 
North Declining Inclining Plain.




And 
Dials
 upon any of these Variety of Plains may be made by the 
Globes,
 as I shall come now to shew.






PROB. I.
 To make an 
Horizontal Dial
 in a∣ny Latitude.




I.
 The Operation by the 
Globe.


ELevate the 
Globe
 to the 
Latitude
 of the place for which you would make your 
Dial,
 (sup∣pose for 
London,
 in the 
Latitude
 of 51 deg. 30 min.) Then bring the 
Vernal Equinoctial Colure
 (which is the first point of 
Aries
 also) to the 
Meridian,
 and (if you will) the 
Index
 of the 
Hour-Circle
 to 12. This done,


1. Turn the 
Globe
 about 
Westward,
 till the 
Hour-Index
 points at 1 a clock, or rather [till 15 degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 come to be just under the 
Meridian,
] and there keeping the 
Globe,
 look upon the 
Horizon
 how many degrees thereof are cut by the 
Equinoctial Colure;
 which you shall

 finde to be 11 deg. 50 min. which set down in a little Table, as you see here is done; for this 11 deg. 50 min. is the distance that the 
hour-lines
 of 11 and 1 a clock are distant from the 
Meridian
 up∣on the Dial Plain.


2. Turn the 
Globe
 more 
West∣ward,


 till 30 degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 comes to the 
Meridian,
 and then see what degrees of the 
Horizo n
 are cut by the 
Equinoctial Colure;
 which you will finde to be 24 deg. 20 min. which note down in a Table as before, for that is the 
hour-distance
 of 10 and 2 a clock from the 
Meridian.


3. Turn the 
Globe
 still more 
Westward,
 till 45 degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 come to the 
Meri∣dian,
 and then shall the 
Equinoctial Colure
 cut 38 deg. 3 min. of the 
Horizon
 counted from the 
Meridian,
 which is the distance of 9 and 3 a clock.


Do thus with the othe r hours of 8 and 4, of 7 and 5, and so shall the 
Colure
 cut 90 degrees at 6 a clock, or when 90 degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 comes to the 
Meridian.
 And this being done, your 
Dial
 is so far made as the 
Globe
 can assist you. Now for






II.
 The Geometrical Construction of this 
Dial.


FIG. I.


1. Upon the Plain on which you designe to draw your 
Dial,
 draw a Right line A B, repre∣senting the 
Meridian
 of your 
Globe,
 and the Hour-line of 12 of the clock.


2. Assigne towards one end of this Line a point as C, representing the Centre of your 
Dial,
 and through that Point draw another Line at Right angles to A B, which shall be the Hour-line of 6 a clock, as the Line H K; and upon the Point C, describe a Semicircle D E F, according to the Radius of some Line of 
Chords.
 Then


1. Laying your little Table (before made) be∣fore you, you find 
Latit.
 51 deg. 30 min. Take 51 deg. 30 min. from your Line of 
Chords,
 and set that distance upon the 
Semicircle
 from E to G, and draw the Line C G for the Stile or Cock of your 
Dial.


2. Then seeing that 11 and 1 a clock are di∣stant from the 
Meridian
 11 deg. 50 min. take 11 deg. 50 min. from your 
Chord,
 and set it up∣on the 
Semicircle
 from E to 11, and from E to 1, and draw the Lines C 11, and C 1, for the Hour∣lines of 11 and 1.


3. The distance of 10 and 2 a clock being 24 deg. 20 min. take 24 deg. 20 min. out of your Line of 
Chords,
 and set it upon the 
Semicircle
 from E to 10, and from E to 2, and draw the Lines C 10, and C 2, for the Hour-lines of 10 and 2.


4. Do thus with the rest of the Hour-lines of 9 and 3, 8 and 4, — 7 and 5. So have you all the Hour-lines between 6 in the morning and 6 at night; and for the Hour-lines of 4 and 5 in the morning, and of 7 and 8 at night, draw the same Hour-lines before 6 through the Centre, as in the Figure, and they shall be the true Hour-lines: And so is your 
Dial
 finished.


The 
Stile
 must stand upright upon 12 of the clock, not inclining on either side.

 and that is the Hour-distance of 11 and 1 a clock from 12.


3. Turn the 
Globe
 more 
We∣sterly,
 till 30 degrees of the 
Colure
 be under the 
Meridian,
 then shall the 
Colure
 cut upon the

 19 deg. 45 min. which is the distance of 10 and 2 a clock from 12.


4. Turn the 
Globe
 still 
Westerly,
 till 45 deg. 60 deg. and 75 deg. come under the 
Meridian;
 and so shall you finde that the 
Colure
 will cut the 
Horizon
 in 31 deg. 54 min. for 9 and 3 a clock, and the rest, as in this Table. And so is the Globular work of your 
Dial
 finished.








II.
 The Geometrical Construction of this 
Dial.


FIG. II.


1. Draw a Right Line L M upon your Plain for the 
Meridian,
 and 
Hour-line
 of 12; and ano∣ther 
Perpendicular
 thereto, as N P for the 
Hour-line
 of 6 and 6; and where these Lines cross (as at O,) is the Centre of your 
Dial.


2. Upon O, as a Centre, with the Radius of a Line of 
Chords,
 describe a Semicircle N Q P, and then taking 38 deg. 30 min. (which is the Complement of the 
Latitude
 of the place) out of the Line of 
Chords,
 set it from Q to R, and draw the Line O R for the Cock or Stile of your 
Dial.


3. Laying your Table before you against 11 and 1 of the clock, you finde 9 deg. 28 min. Take therefore 9 deg. 28 min. out of your 
Chord,
 and set that distance upon the Semicircle from Q to 11 and from Q to 1, and draw the Lines O 11 and O 1, for the Hour-lines of 11 and 1.


4. Also take 19 deg. 45 min. and set them from Q to 10, and from Q to 2, and draw O 10, and O 2, for the hours of 10 and 2.


5. Do the like for the hours of 9 and 3, 8 and 4, 7 and 5, and your 
Dial
 is finished.


The 
Stile
 must stand over 12, and must point downwards towards the 
South-Pole.










PROB. III.
 To make a Vertical direct North-
Dial.


THe 
North Vertical Dial,
 is the same with the 
South,
 only the 
Stile
 must point upwards towards the 
North-Pole,
 and the hours about Mid∣night, as 9, 10, 11, 12: 1, 2, and 3 must be left out, and 4 and 5 in the Morning; and 7 and 8 at Night must be drawn through the Centre: So is your 
North-Dial
 also finished.






PROB. IV. 
To make a direct
 Vertical East 
or
 West Dial.




I.
 The Operation by the 
Globe.


THe 
Globe
 rectified to the 
Latitude,
 the 
Index
 to 12, the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 in the 
Ze∣nith:
 If you turn the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 so about till the graduated edge thereof do behold the direct 
East
 or 
West
-points of the 
Horizon,
 you shall finde that it will lie in the very Plain of the 
Meridian-Circle,
 and so the 
Pole
 will have no elevation over it; for turning the 
Globe
 about, the 
Equinoctial Colure
 will not cut the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 in any particular degree, but it will

 cut all the degrees thereof at the same time; wherefore the Hour-lines of these Plains will make no 
Angles
 at the 
Pole,
 and therefore must be parallel one to the other, which the 
Globe
 evi∣dently demonstrates, but will not conveniently give the parallel distance of each from other, they being neerer or farther off of each other ac∣cording as the 
Stile
 is proportioned to the Plain, which I shall now come to shew in






II.
 The Geometrical Construction of these 
Dials.


FIG. III.


Let the Plain upon which you would make an 
East
 or 
West Dial,
 be A B C D.


1. Upon D (or any where towards the lower part of the Line B D, for an 
East Dial,
 or of A C for a 
West
) with 60 degrees of your 
Chord,
 de∣scribe an Arch F G, upon which set the Comple∣ment of the 
Latitude
 of the place, 
viz.
 38 deg. 30 min. from F to G, and draw the Line D G E for the 
Equinoctial.


2. Towards the upper part of this Line, as at P, assume any point, and through it draw the Line 6 P 6 perpendicular to the 
Equinoctial,
 for the Hour-line of Six. — Also, towards the lower part of the same Line, assume another point, as L, and through it draw the Line 11 L 11 for the Hour-line of Eleven.


3. With 60 degrees of your 
Chords,
 upon the point L, describe a small Arch of a Circle, as H K, and upon it (always) set 15 degrees (or

 one hours distance) from H to K, and draw the Line L K M, cutting the Hour-line of Six in M.


4. Upon M as a Centre, with 60 degrees of your 
Chord,
 describe an Arch of a Circle N O, which divide into five equal parts in the points ☉ ☉ ☉ ☉.


5. Lay a Ruler upon M, and each of these points ☉ ☉ ☉ ☉, and the Ruler will cut the 
E∣quinoctial-line
 E D in the points * * * *, through which points, if you draw Right Lines parallel to the Hour-line of 6, they shall be the Hour-lines of 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the clock, the Hour-lines of 6 and 11 being drawn before.


6. For the Hour-lines of 4 and 5 in the Mor∣ning, before 6, they retain the same distance from 6, as do the hours of 7 and 8; and thus is your 
Dial
 finished.


The 
Stile
 must stand upon the Hour-line of 6, and be elevated so high as is the length of the Line M P, and may either be a pin of Wyre, or a plate of Brass or Iron.


The 
West-Dyal
 is the same with the 
East,
 on∣ly changing the names of the hours.


For



4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 in the morning, in the 
East-Dyal;




Must be changed to



8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 in the afternoon, in the 
West-Dyal:




Which is all the difference.

THe

 being R
ctified to the

 of the place, the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 in the 
Zenith,
 the 
Index
 of the Hour-Circle at 12, and the 
Equinoctial Colure
 brought under the

1. Count the Declination of the Plain upon the

 from the 
East

West
-points thereof (according as the Plain declines) towards the 
South:
 namely, 30 degrees; and to that point of the 
Horizon
 bring the 
Quadrant of Altitude,
 and there keep it.


2. Turn the 
Globe
 about till the 
Index
 of the Hour-wheel cuts 11 of the clock, or rather (as I said before) till 15 degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 have passed the 
Meridian,
 and then shall you finde the 
Equinoctial Colure
 to cut the 
Quadrant of Al∣titude
 at 9 deg. 50 min. if you count the degrees from the 
Zenith point
 downwards.


3. Turn the

 the

 will cut such degrees of the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 as are expressed in this Table, if you count them from the 
Zenith
 downwards, as is before directed.


This done;

Quadrant of Altitude
 to the o∣ther side of the 
Meridian,
 and set it to 30 degrees, the Plains declination, counted from the 
East
 or 
West
-points 
Northward,
 as you did before towards the 
South,
 which will be in the just opposite point of the 
Horizon
 to which it was before; and also, bring the 
Equinoctial Colure
 under the 
Meridian.
 Then,


6. Turn the 
Globe
 about (the contrary way to what you did before) till 15 degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 be past the 
Meridian,
 and then shall you finde the 
Equinoctial Colure
 to cut at 12 deg. 23 min. of the

 you shall finde the 
Equinoctial Colure
 to cut the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 at such degrees as are expressed in this Table.




The Hour-distances upon the Plain being thus attained, there are two other requisites in all upright declining 
Dyals
 also to be found by the 
Globe,
 before the 
Dyal
 can be finished. Namely,



1. The distance of the 
Substile
 from the 
Meri∣dian.


2. The height of the 
Pole
 above the 
Plain,
 or the height of the 
Stile
 above the 
Substile.




To finde both which,


Bring the 
Equinoctial Colure
 to the Plains de∣clination 30 degrees counted upon the 
Horizon
 from the 
South-Eastward;
 and the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 to 30 degrees counted in the 
Horizon
 from the 
East-Northward:
 So shall the 
Quadrant
 cut the 
Colure
 at 
Right Angles.
 And


The number of degrees of the 
Quadrant
 con∣tained between this 
Intersection
 and the 
Zenith
 (which here is 21 deg. 41 min.) is the distance of the 
Substile
 from the 
Meridian.
 And the de∣grees of the 
Colure
 contained between this 
Inter∣section
 and the 
Pole
 (which here is 32 deg. 37 min.) is the height of the 
Pole
 above the Plain.






II.
 The Geometrical Construction.


FIG. IV.


1. Draw a Line C D for the 
Meridian
 and Hour-line of 12, and at 
Right Angles
 thereunto

 draw another Line, as A B, for the 
Horizontal-line,
 crossing the former in the point C, the Centre of the 
Dyal.


2. Upon the point C, describe the 
Semicircle
 A G B.


3. Take 21 deg. 41 min. from your 
Chord,
 and (because the Plain declines 
Eastward
) set it from G to E; also, take from your 
Chord
 32 deg. 37 min. (which is the height of the 
Pole
 above the Plain) and set it from E to F, and draw the Line C E for the 
Substile,
 and C F for the 
Stile
 of the 
Dyal.


4. Having recourse to the Tables of Hour-di∣stances, take 9 deg. 50 min. and set it from G to 11; also take 18 deg. 14 min. and set it from G to 10, and so the rest in that Table. — Also out of the other Table take 12 deg. 23 min. and set them from G to 1, 
&c.


5. From the Centre C draw Lines through the several points 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11; and also through 1, 2, 3, and 4, they shall be the true Hour-lines; and so have you finished this 
Dyal.


And in the making of this 
Dyal,
 you have made four 
Dyals;
 as I have intimated at large in my 
Art of Dyalling,
 Part 1. Chap. 7. For,


If you hold the Paper upon which the 
South-East declining Dyal
 is drawn, against the light, then shall you discover the 
Stile
 to stand on the 
Right hand
 of the 
Plain,
 whereas it now stands on the 
Left hand;
 so the same 
Hour-lines, Sub∣stile, Stile
 and all, being drawn on the back-side of the Paper, and those that are the 
Forenoon-hours
 in the 
East-decliner
 numbred as the 
After∣noon-hours
 in the 
West-decliner,
 that is, call 11, 1,

 and 10, 2, and 9, 3, 
&c.
 as in the Tables; so shall the 
South-Dyal
 declining 
East
 30 degrees, become a 
South-Dyal
 declining 
Westward
 30 de∣grees.


And if you turn the 
South-East-Dyal
 upside-down, so that the 
Stile
 may point upwards to∣wards the 
North-Pole,
 (and leave out the hours about 12, as 9, 10, 11, and 1, 2, and 3, which in 
North-Dyals
 represent 9, 10, and 11 at night, and 1, 2, and 3 in the morning; all which time (in those middle 
Latitudes
) the 
Sun
 is under the 
Horizon
) it will become a 
North-Dyal
 de∣clining 
Eastward
 30 degrees.


Also if you turn the 
South
 declining 
West Dyal
 upside-down, and leave out the hours about 
Midnight,
 as 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, and 3, it will then become a 
North-Dyal
 declining 
Westward
 30 degrees.


Now for such 
South
 or 
North Dyals
 as do de∣decline far towards the 
East
 or 
West,
 as 60, 70, 80, or 85 degrees, there you shall finde that the hour-distances will fall so neer together, that they will be of no competent distance one from another, except they be extended very far from the Centre; and therefore the old way hath been (in such Cases) to draw the 
Dyal
 upon the Floor of a Room, extending the 
Substile, Stile,
 and 
Hour-lines
 till they appear of a competent distance from each other, and then according to the bigness of your 
Dyal-plain,
 to cut off the 
Hour-lines, Stile,
 and 
Substile,
 and so transfer them from the Floor to the 
Plain
 upon which the 
Dyal
 is to be made: but this way being too Mechanical for an Artist to exercise, I have in my

 foresaid 
Art of Dyalling
 shewed a more artificial way of performing this work 
Geometrically,
 by which (although the 
Dyal
 should decline 80 or 88 degrees) upon a quarter of a sheet of paper you may draw your 
Dyal,
 and have the 
Stile
 of a competent height, and all the Hour-lines at a convenient distance one from another. And so let this suffice to be said in this place concerning 
Ʋp∣right declining Dyals;
 for I intend not here to teach the 
Art of Dyalling,
 but shew the 
Ʋse
 of the 
Globes.








PROB. VI. 
Of direct
 South Reclining Dyals.


TO finde the distances of the Hour-lines up∣on these Plains by the 
Globes,
 this is the na∣tural way.




The Operation by the 
Globe.


Having set the 
Globe
 to the 
Latitude,
 the 
In∣dex
 of the 
Hour-circle
 to 12, the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 to the 
Reclination,
 with the end there∣of in the 
East
 o
 
West
 points of the 
H
rizon,
 and brought the 
Equinoctial Colure
 to the 
Meridian,
 — Turn the 
Globe
 
bout, till the 1 hour, or 15 degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 hath passed the 
Meridi∣an,
 and then see what degrees of the 
Quadrant

 of Altitude
 are cut by the 
Equinoctial Colure;
 for those degrees counted from the upper part of the 
Quadrant
 downwards, are the degrees of the first hours distance (as of XI or I of the clock) from the 
Meridian,
 and so for all the rest of the Hour-distances.


This I say is the natural way; but the more artificial and better way, will be to refer such 
Reclining Plains
 to a 
New Latitude
 where they may become 
Horizontal Plains;
 and that may be easily effected, as I shall presently shew.


I formerly said, that a 
South-Plain
 may so recline, that the Reclination thereof may be either



Less than


Equal to


More than


 the Complement of the known 
Latitude.


Now to refer any of these Plains to a new 
Latitude
 where they may become 
Horizontal Plains,
 observe,


1. If the Reclination of the Plain be less than the Complement of the known 
Latitude,
 Substract the Plains Reclination from the Complement of the 
Latitude,
 and the Remain∣er shall be a 
New Latitude,
 where the 
Reclining Plain
 shall be an 
Horizontal Plain;
 and, in this Case, the 
South-Pole
 (in 
North-Latitudes
) is always elevated.


2. If the Reclination be equal to the Com∣plement of the known 
Latitude,
 then the 
New

 Latitude
 is no 
Latitude;
 for the Plain lies in the very 
Axis
 of the World, and hath neither 
Pole
 e∣levated above it.


3. If the Reclination of the Plain be More (or Greater) than the Complement of the known 
Latitude,
 Substract the Complement of the known 
Latitude
 from the Plains Reclination, and the Remainer shall be the 
New Latitude;
 and in this Case, the 
North-Pole
 (in 
North-La∣titudes
) is always elevated.

 LEt a 
South-Plain
 in the 
Latitude
 of 51 deg. 30 min. 
North,
 recline 20 de∣grees: Now because 20 de∣grees is less than 38 deg. 30 min. the Complement of the known 
Latitude,
 substract 20 degrees from 38 deg. 30 min. and there will remain 18 deg. 30 min. which will be the 
New Latitude.
 Wherefore i
 you Rectifie the 
Globe
 to 18 deg. 30 min. of 
Latitude,
 and make an 
Horizontal Dyal
 as is before taught in all respects, that 
Dyal
 shall serve for a 
South Dyal
 reclining 20 degrees in the 
Latitude
 o
 51 deg. 30 min. the Hour-distances being such as are expressed in this Table, and the heigh
 of the 
Stile
 above the 12 a clock-line (or 
Substile
) to be equal to the 
New Latitude,
 namely, 18 deg. 30 min.








II.
 Of a 
South Plain
 Reclining equal to the Complement of the 
Latitude.


Thus if a 
South Plain
 in the 
Latitude
 of 51 deg. 30 min. shall recline 38 deg. 30 min. equal to the Complement of the 
Latitude,
 the 
New La∣titude
 (as is said before) shall be no 
Latitude,
 and so neither 
Pole
 have any Elevation; where∣fore the 
Dyal
 is to be made in all respects as an 
East
 or 
West-Dyal
 is made, only that Hour-line which in the 
East
 or 
West-Dyal
 is the six a clock hour-line, must in these 
Dyals
 be the Hour-line of 12, 
&c.






III.
 Of a 
South Plain
 Reclining more than the Complement of the 
Latitude.


Suppose a 
South Plain
 in the 
Latitude
 of 51 deg. 30 min. should recline from the 
Zenith
 60 degrees; forasmuch as 60 degrees is more than 38 deg. 30 min. the Complement of the known 
Latitude,
 substract 38 deg. 30 min. from 60 degrees, and the remainer 21 deg. 30 min. will be the 
New Latitude.

 Wherefore, if you make an

 for the

South-Dyal
 Reclining from the 
Zenith
 60 degrees in the 
Latitude
 of 51 deg. 30 min. And the 
Stile
 of this 
Dyal
 must be e∣levated above the 
Substile
 (or Hour-line of 12) 21 deg. 30 min. equal to the 
New Latitude,
 and must point upwards towards the 
North-Pole,
 as must the 
Stiles
 of all 
South-Plains
 which recline more than the Complement of the 
Latitude.










PROB. VII.
 Of North Reclining Dyals.


THe Natural way of finding of the Hour-distances for 
North Reclining Dyals
 is thus.




The Operation by the 
Globe.


Rectifie the 
Globe
 to the 
Latitude,
 set the 
Qua∣drant of Altitude
 to the 
Reclination,
 and the end of it to the 
East
 or 
West
-points of the 
Horizon,
 the 
Index
 of the Hour-circle to 12, and the 
Equi∣noctial

 Colure
 to the 
Meridian
 — Then turn the 
Globe
 about till 15 degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 have passed the 
Meridian,
 and then see what de∣grees of the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 are cut by the 
Equinoctial Colure;
 for those degrees (counted from the upper end of the 
Quadrant of Altitude
) are the first hours distance from 12, as of 11 and 1 of the clock: and so of all the rest of the hours.


This is the natural way; but the better way will be to refer these 
North Reclining Plains
 to a 
New Latitude,
 as before you did the 
South-Recliners.


Of these 
North Reclining Plains,
 there are 
Three Varieties,
 as there were of the 
South-Re∣cliners:
 for the Reclination may be either



Less than


Equal to


More than


 the 
Latitude
 of the Place.


And to refer these to a 
New Latitude
 where they will be 
Horizontal Plains,
 you must observe,


1. If the Reclination of the Plain be less than the 
Latitude,
 add the Complement of the 
Lati∣tude
 to the Plains Reclination, and the sum shall be the 
New Latitude,
 and the 
North-Pole
 (in 
North-Latitudes
) shall be always elevated.


2. If the Reclination be equal to the 
Lati∣tude,
 add the Complement of the 
Latitude
 and the Reclination together, and the sum shall be the 
New Latitude,
 which in this Case will always be 90 degrees.


3. If the Reclination be more than the 
Lati∣tude,


 add the Complement of the Reclination of the Plain, and the 
Latitude
 together, the sum of them shall be the 
New Latitude,
 and the 
North-Pole
 shall always be elevated.






Examples of these three Varieties.




I.
 Of a 
North-Plain
 Reclining less than the 
Latitude.


LEt a 
North-Plain
 in the 
Latitude
 of 51 deg. 30 min. recline from the 
Zenith
 20 degrees; add 20 degrees (the Reclination) to 51 deg. 30 min. (the 
Latitude
) the sum will be 71 deg. 30 min. which is the 
New Latitude.

 to 71 deg. 30 min. of 
Latitude,
 and make an 
Hori∣zontal Dyal
 as is before taught, you shall finde the Hour-distances to be such as are expressed in this Table. And the 
Stile
 must be elevated above the 
Substile
 (or Hour∣line of 12) equal to the 
New Latitude;
 and so shall this 
Horizontal Dyal,
 made for the 
Latitude
 of 71 deg. 30 min. serve for a 
North-Dyal
 Recli∣ning 20 degrees in the 
Latitude
 of 51 deg. 30 min.








II.
 Of a 
North-Plain
 Reclining equal to the 
Latitude.


Let a 
North Plain
 in the 
Latitude
 of 
London
 51 deg. 30 min. recline from the 
Zenith
 51 deg. 30 min. this added to the Complement of the 
Latitude, viz.
 38 deg. 30 min. the sum will be 90. so that 90 degrees is the 
New Latitude.
 Where∣fore, rectifie the 
Globe
 to 90 degrees of 
Latitude,
 so shall the 
Pole
 be in the 
Zenith,
 and the 
Equi∣noctial
 in the 
Horizon:
 then turn the 
Globe
 about till 15 degrees of the 
Equinoctial Colure
 have pas∣sed the 
Meridian,
 and it will rest at 15 degrees of the 
Horizon,
 which is the first Hours distance from 12. for in these Plains the degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 and the degrees of the 
Horizon
 being the same, there is no more in the making of this 
Dyal,
 than to divide a Circle into 24 equal parts, and (being the 
New Latitude
 is 90 degrees) e∣rect a Wyre perpendicularly in the Centre, and the 
Dyal
 is finished.






III.
 Of a 
North-Plain
 Reclining more than the 
Latitude.


Suppose that in the 
Latitude
 of 51 deg. 30 min. a 
North-Plain
 should recline from the 
Ze∣nith
 60 degrees, add 51 deg. 30 min. (the 
La∣titude
) to 30 degrees (the Complement of the Reclination) the sum will be 81 deg. 30 min. for the 
New Latitude.

 for that 
La∣titude,
 and you shall finde the Hour-distances to be such as are expressed in this Table; and such an 
Horizontal Dyal
 for the 
Latitude
 of 81 deg. 30 min. shall serve for a 
North-Dyal
 reclining 60 deg. in the 
Latitude
 of 51 deg. 30 min. The 
Stile
 must be elevated above the 12 a clock hour-line equal to the 
New Latitude,
 namely, 81 deg. 30 min.










PROB. VIII. 
Of
 East 
or
 West 
direct Recliners.


SUch Plains as lie in the 
Meridian
 or 
Azimuth
 of 
North
 and 
South,
 and do recline from the 
Zenith
 towards the 
East
 or 
West
-points of the 
Horizon,
 are called 
East
 or 
West-Recliners;
 and the Natural way of finding of the Hour-distances upon these Plains by the 
Globes,
 is thus.




I.
 The Operation by the 
Globe.


The 
Globe
 rectified to the 
Latitude
 of the place, the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 in the 
Zenith,
 the 
E∣quinoctial

 Colure
 brought to the 
Meridian,
 the 
In∣dex
 of the Hour-wheel to 12, and the 
Semicircle
 of 
Position
 fixed to the 
Meridian
 in the 
North
 and 
South
-points of the 
Horizon,
 elevate the 
Semi∣circle
 of 
Position
 to the Complement of the 
Plains Reclination,
 counted upon the 
Quadrant of Alti∣tude
 from the 
Horizon;
 then move the 
Globe
 a∣bout, till the 
Equinoctial Colure
 hath passed 15 degrees of the 
Equinoctial,
 and then the degrees of the 
Semicircle
 of 
Position,
 cut by the 
Equinocti∣al Colure
 (counted from the 
Meridian
) shall be the degrees that the first Hour-line of 11 or 1 shall be distant from the 
Meridian,
 or Hour-line of 12. — Also turn the 
Globe
 about till the 
E∣quinoctial Colure
 hath passed 30 degrees of the 
Equinoctial Circle,
 and the degrees cut by the 
Co∣lure
 upon the 
Semicircle
 of 
Position
 shall be the degrees that the second Hour-line shall be distant from 12, 
&c.


This is the natural way of making of these 
Dyals
 by the 
Globe;
 but (to retain our former method) we will refer these 
East
 or 
West recli∣ning Dyals
 to a 
New Latitude,
 where they shall be upright declining Plains; which to perform, is easie: For,


In all 
East
 or 
West-Recliners,
 the 
New Latitude
 is always the Complement of the known 
Lati∣tude,
 and the 
New Declination
 is always the Com∣plement of the 
Reclination;
 so that an 
East
 or 
West-Plain
 in the 
Latitude
 of 51 deg. 30 min. reclining 40 degrees will be an upright 
North-Plain
 declining 
East
 or 
West
 50 degrees in the 
Latitude
 of 38 deg. 30 min. for 38 deg. 30 min. is the 
New Latitude,
 it being the Complement of

 the known 
Latitude,
 and 50 degrees is the 
New Declination,
 it being the Complement of the Plains Reclination in the known 
Latitude;
 wherefore, if (according to the directions given you in the 
Fifth Problem
) you make an upright 
Dyal,
 declining 50 degrees for the 
Latitude
 of 38 deg. 30 min. you shall finde all the Hour-distances to be such as are expressed in this Table.

 or

 above the 
Plain
 or 
Substile,
 to be 30 deg. 12 min. which declining 
Dy∣al
 in this 
New Latitude,
 shall be an 
East
 of 
West reclining Dyal
 in the known 
Latitude.


But in the placing of the 
Dyal
 upon the 
Recli∣ning Plain,
 there is this difference: For whereas in all Upright declining Plains, the 
Meridian
 or Hour-line of 12 is per∣pendicular to the 
Horizon,
 in all 
East
 or 
West-Recli∣ners
 the 
Meridian
 (or Hour-line of 12) must lie parallel to the 
Horizon.
 And here note also, that all 
East-Recliners
 in the known 
Latitude,
 are 
North-East-decliners
 in

 the 
New Latitude,
 and all 
West-Recliners
 are 
North-West-decliners.
 All which may be seen in






FIG. V.


And note farther, that upon all 
East
 and 
West-Recliners
 (how far soever) in 
North-Latitudes,
 the 
North-Pole
 is always elevated; and upon the 
East
 and 
West-Incliners
 opposite to them, the 
South Pole.


Thus have you the manner of making of all sorts of direct Reclining or Inclining 
Dyals
 by the 
Globes
 two several ways; namely, by the Na∣tural way, as they lie in respect of the 
Horizon,
 where they are to be placed Obliquely: And also a more artificial way, by referring them to 
New Latitudes
 and 
New Declinations,
 where they may become 
Horizontal
 or 
Ʋpright declining Plains.
 And now let us proceed to








PROB. IX.
 Of Declining, Reclining, or Incli∣ning Plains.


SUch Plains as do not directly behold the 
East, West, North,
 or 
South
-points of the 
Horizon,
 nor do stand perpendicular thereunto, but fall back from the 
Zenith,
 these Plains are called 
North
 or 
South-Recliners.
 For the making of these kindes of 
Dyals
 by the 
Globes,
 the natural way followeth.






I.
 The Operation by the 
Globe.


For our 
Example,
 Let us suppose a Plain in the 
Latitude
 of 51 deg. 30 min. to 
decline
 from the 
North
-part of the 
Meridian
 towards the 
West
 72 degrees, and also to 
Recline
 from the 
Zenith
 26 deg. 34 min.


1. Elevate your 
Globe
 to the 
Latitude
 of the place 51 deg, 30 min. the 
Quadrant of Alti∣tude
 in the 
Zenith,
 the 
Hour-circle
 to 12, and the 
Equinoctial Colure
 to the 
Meridian.


2. The 
Declination
 being 72 degrees 
Westward,
 count upon the 
Horizon
 20 degrees (the Comple∣ment thereof, from the 
South
-part of the 
Meri∣dian Westward,
 and from the 
North
-part of the 
Meridian Eastward;
 and to these two Points in the 
Horizon,
 bring the two extreme ends of your 
Circle of Position,
 (or which is far better, a nar∣row Plate of thin Brass, containing a compleat 
Semicircle
 at least, divided into degrees as the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 is, beginning the divisions at the middle, and numbering them both ways towards the ends) and there fix it. Then bring the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 to 20 degrees in the 
Horizon,
 counted from the 
East Southward.
— Now (because the Plain Reclines 26 deg. 34 min.) count those degrees upon the 
Quadrant
 downwards, from the 
Pole,
 and to that Point bring down the thin Plate of Brass, representing your Plain, and there fix it; for now is your 
Globe
 prepared for the making of your 
Dyal.
 And,






I.
 For the Hour-distances:


If you turn the 
Globe
 about 
Eastward,
 till 15 degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 have passed the 
Me∣ridian,
 you shall finde upon the Plain intercepted between the 
Colure
 and the 
Meridian
 26 deg. 3 min. which is the first Hours distance from 12 upon your Plain. Again, turn the 
Globe
 about still 
Eastward,
 and you shall finde 44 deg. 30 min. intercepted, which is the second Hours di∣stance upon the Plain.


Also, if you turn about the 
Globe Westward
 till 15 degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 have passed the 
Meridian,
 there will be cut by the 
Colure
 upon the Plain 28 deg. 4 min. which is the first Hours distance on the other side of the 
Meridian.
 And so do with all the rest, and you shall finde them as in this following Table.

 Now (besides these Hour-distances) there must be Four other things found before we come to the 
Geo∣metrical Construction
 of this 
Dyal;
 and those are


1. 
The Arch of the Plain (or the distance) between the Meridian and Horizon;
 and that may be found thus.— Take with your Compasses (or with a thin Plate of Brass or Horn divided) the distance upon the Plain, from the Inter∣section of the Plain with the 
Horizon,
 to the Intersection of the Plain with the 
Meridian;
 and those degrees, namely 36, are the distance re∣quired.


2. 
The Arch of the Meridian between the Plain and the Zenith.
 The which may be thus found. For the degrees of the 
Meridian
 intercepted be∣tween the Plain and the 
Zenith,
 viz. 58 deg. 17 min. is this Arch.


3. 
The height of the
 Pole 
or
 Stile 
above the
 Plain.— And to finde this, You must continue

 your 
Quadrant of Altitude
 from the 
Zenith
 below the 
Horizon,
 so much as is the Reclination of the Plain 26 deg. 34 min. And mark that Point, for it is the 
Pole
 of the 
Reclining Plain.
 Then a thin Plate of Brass, (for the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 will be (for the most part) too short) divided, be∣ing extended from the 
North-Pole
 towards the 
South-Pole
) and passing through the Pole of the Plain, (which is the Point before found) mark where the Plate cutteth the Plain; and the num∣ber of degrees of the Plate that are contained between the 
Pole
 and the Plain, which will be here found 31 deg. 28 min. is the height of the 
Pole
 or 
Stile
 above the 
Plain
 or 
Substile.


4. 
The distance of the
 Substile 
from the
 Meri∣dian.— And that is, the number of degrees of the Plate representing the 
Plain,
 which are con∣tained between the Plate which came from the 
Pole
 of the World to the 
Pole
 of the Plain, and the Intersection of the Plain with the 
Meridian,
 which in this 
Example
 will be found to be 82 deg. 4 min.








II.
 The Geometrical Construction of this 
Dyal.


FIG. VI.


1. Upon the Plain upon which you intend to describe your 
Dyal,
 draw an 
Horizontal-line
 thereupon, as A B; and another perpendicular thereunto D G, for the 
Vertical line
 of your Plain, cutting the former A B in the point G, which point C make the Centre of your 
Dyal.


2. Upon the Centre C, with 60 degrees of a

 Line of 
Chords
 describe a Circle, as A F B G. then take 36 degrees 
(the distance of the Meridian from the Horizon,)
 and set it from A to 12 down∣wards, and from B to 12 upwards, and draw the Line 12 C 12 for the Hour-line of XII.


3. Take 82 deg. 4 min. 
(the distance of the Substile from the Meridian)
 and set them from 12 upwards to G on the left hand, and down∣wards from 12 to G on the right hand, drawing the Line G C G through the Centre, for the 
Sub∣stilar-line
 of both the 
Dyals:
 — And 
the height of the
 Pole 
or
 Stile 
above the
 Plain being 31 deg. 28 min. set those degrees from G to H, both above and below, and draw the Line H C H quite through the Centre, for the 
Axis
 or 
Stiles
 of both 
Dyals.


4. Laying your Table of 
Hour-distances
 be∣fore you, and there finding the first Hours distance from 12 is 26 deg. 3 min. set that distance up∣on the Circle from 12 upwards to 1, and from 12 (on the other side) downwards to 11, and draw the Lines C 1, and C 11, for the Hour-lines of 11 and 1 a clock, which will both be but one streight line.


Do thus with all the hours in the Table till you come to the 
Substile,
 and then, (begin∣ning at the bottom of the Table)


5. Take 28 deg. 4 min. and set them from 12 on the Right hand downwards to 11, and from 12 on the Left hand upwards to 1, and draw the Line C 11 in the 
North
 Reclining Plain, for the 
Sun
 will never shine upon the 
South
 In∣clining

 Plain at 1, otherwise you should have drawn it through the Centre as you did before. Do the like with all the rest of the hours, draw∣ing such through the Centre as you finde occasion for; which the sight of the Figure will inform you how to do, better than many Words.


Lastly, Erect your 
Stile
 perpendicular to your 
Substile,
 making an 
Angle
 therewith equal to the elevation thereof; namely, 31 deg. 28 min. and your 
Dyals
 are finished. — And in the making of these, you have made two others also, 
viz. A North Declining
 72 degrees 
Eastward,
 and 
Incli∣ning
 26 deg. 34 min. and a 
South Declining West∣ward
 72 degrees, and 
Inclining
 as the other; all which is done (and may easily be apprehended by any person) as is discovered in the 4th 
Pro∣blem
 of this Book for 
Ʋpright declining Plains.


Thus have you the manner of making all man∣ner of plain 
Sun-Dyals
 by the 
Globes,
 not only by the 
Natural
 way, as they are 
Naturally
 repre∣sented upon the 
Globe;
 but by an 
Artificial
 way also, by referring them to 
New Latitudes,
 in which they shall become 
Horizontal Dyals,
 or at least 
Ʋpright Decliners.
 It resteth now that I should say something concerning the inserting of 
Tro∣picks, Parallels, Italian, Babylonish,
 and 
Jewish Hours,
 as also 
Almicanters, Azimuths,
 and such o∣ther 
Spherical Lines
 and 
Arches
 as are oftentimes inserted upon 
Dyal-Plains
 for the delight and cu∣riosity of the Ingenious: but these, with some other things concerning the 
Gnomonicks,
 I shall refer to another Treatise by it self.












ASTROLOGICAL Problems. 




INTRODƲCTION.


AStrologie
 consisteth principally of two parts, 
viz.
 the one 
Mathematical,
 as is the 
Astronomical part;
 the other 
Judicia∣ry,
 as is the 
Astrological part.


The 
Mathematical part
 teacheth how in a 
Scheme
 or 
Figure
 (as they call it) to represent the 
Face
 of the Heavens 
in Plano,
 for any hour of the day or night, at all times of the year, and in all parts of the world.


The 
Astrological part
 teacheth how (from the sight of the said position of the 
Scheme
 or 
Fi∣gure
 of the Heavens at the time of its erection) to give a determinate 
Judgement
 of what was demanded upon that 
Erection
 of the 
Scheme
 or 
Figure:
 as of 
Annual Revolutions, Elections,
 the 
Nativity
 of a Person.


The principal Authors that have given their Opinions concerning the dividing of the Hea∣vens into 12 
Mansions
 or 
Houses,
 are, 1 
Ptolomy,
 2 
Alcabitius,
 3 
Campanus,
 and 4 
Regiomontanus:
 Which last way, is now generally received and practised among the 
Astrologers
 of these times, and by them termed the 
Rational way of Regio∣montanus.




Now, because (as I said before) that the E∣rection of a 
Figure
 of the Heavens is the 
Ma∣thematical
 or 
Astronomical part
 of 
Astrologie,
 I shall therefore shew how by the 
Globes
 to Erect a 
Figure
 of the Heavens according to the various ways of the Four forementioned 
Authors,
 and that for the same 
Latitude
 and 
Time.






PROB. I.
 How to Erect a 
Figure
 of the Hea∣vens in the 
Latitude
 of 
London 51
 deg. 
30
 min. 
N.
 for the 10th day of 
March,
 at 
49
 min. after 
9
 in the 
Forenoon;
 at which time the 
Sun
 enters into the first scru∣ple of 
Aries
 this Year 
1675.




I.
 According to the (esteemed) 
Ratio∣nal
 way of 
Regiomontanus.


 THe Heavens are divided into XII 
Houses
 or 
Mansions,
 by 12 
Semicir∣cle
 of 
Position;
 for which purpose, to some 
Globes,
 there is made one of 
Brass,
 which is fixed in the In∣tersections of the 
Meridian
 and 
Horizon,
 by the 
E∣levation
 or 
Depression
 whereof the Heavens may be divided into parts or houses through each de∣gree of the 
Ecliptick.




 Of these XII 
Houses
 or 
Man∣sions
 of Heaven, 
Four
 are called 
Cardinal,
 as (1.) the 
Horoscope,
 or 
Ascendent,
 or 
Cuspis
 of the 
First House.
 (2.) The 
Medium Coeli,
 or Angle of the 
South,
 or 
Cuspis
 of the 
Tenth House.
 (3.) The 
Descendent,
 or 
Angle
 of the 
West,
 or the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Seventh House.
 (4.) The 
Imum Coeli,
 or the 
Angle
 of the 
North,
 or the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Fourth house.


 
Regiomontanus
 divides the Hea∣vens into XII 
Houses
 according to his way, by the 
Circle
 of 
Positions
 passing through every 30th degree of the 
Equinoctial,
 and cutting the 
Eclip∣tick
 at several points, which are the 
Cuspises
 of the several 
Houses:
 — So that when the 
Globe
 is set to the 
Latitude,
 and the Hour-wheel 
Recti∣fied
 and brought to the Given hour, you have the 
Cuspises
 of the Four 
Cardinal houses
 given: For, The degree of the 
E∣cliptick
 cut by the



East-side of the 
Horizon,


South-part of the 
Meridian,


West-side of the 
Horizon,


North-part of the 
Meridian,




Gives the 
Cus∣pis
 of the



First


Tenth


Seventh


Fourth


 House.


The 
Cuspises
 of the other 8 Houses are found by the motion of the 
Circle
 of 
Position,
 as shall be shewed by and by.


 The 
Houses
 are 
denominated
 by 1, 2, 3, 4, 
&c.
 to 12, from the 
Ascendent
 down∣wards to the 
Imum Coeli,
 up again to the 
Descen∣dant,


 and again by 
Medium Coeli
 down to the 
As∣cendant.
 As in the following 
Scheme.




A 
Figure
 of the XII HOUSES.


an illustration of the 12 astrological houses




Let this suffice for 
Difinition,
 and now we will come to the 
Practice
 by the 
Globes.


 FIrst, to the day proposed, the 10th of 
March,
 finde (by the first 
Astrono∣mical Problem
) the Suns place in the 
Ecliptick
 at noon, which you shall finde to be in 0 deg. 5 min. of 
Aries.


Secondly, Set the 
Globe
 to the 
Latitude
 51 deg. 30 min.


Thirdly, Bring the 
Suns place
 at 
Noon
 (0 deg.

 5 min. of 
Aries
) to the 
Meridian.


Fourthly, Turn the 
Globe
 about till the 
Hour-Index
 point to the 
hour given,
 viz. to 49 min. af∣ter 9 in the 
Morning.


Lastly, The 
Globe
 being in this 
Position,
 fix it.


The 
Globe
 being fixed in this 
Position,
 you shall finde that the 
East-semicircle
 of the 
Horizon
 doth cut the 
Ecliptick
 in 0 deg. 29 min. of 
Cancer,
 which is the 
Signe
 then 
Ascending,
 and must be placed upon the 
Cuspis
 of the 
first House.


Then cast your eye upon the Intersection of the 
South
-part of the 
Meridian
 and the 
Ecliptick,
 and there you shall finde the 
Ecliptick
 cut by the 
Meridian
 in 25 deg. of 
Aquarius,
 and that point of the 
Ecliptick
 is then in the 
Medium Coeli,
 and must be set upon the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Tenth House.


Also you shall finde that the 
West-semicircle
 of the 
Horizon
 cuts the 
Ecliptick
 in 00 deg. 29 min. of 
Capricorn;
 which point is then 
Descending,
 and must be placed upon the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Seventh House.


Lastly, You shall finde that the 
North
-part of the 
Meridian
 doth cut the 
Ecliptick
 in the 25th deg. of 
Leo,
 which point is then upon the 
Imum Coeli,
 and must be placed upon the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Fourth House.


Thus have you found the Points of the 
Eclip∣tick
 which do occupie the 
Cuspises
 of the 
Four Cardinal Houses:
 Now for the other 
Eight Houses.


Let the 
Globe
 still rest in its former 
Position,
 and then,




First, Bring the 
Circle of Position
 to its place on the 
East-side
 of the 
Horizon;
 and being there fixed, raise it upwards towards the 
Meridian,
 till 30 deg. of the 
Equinoctial
 be intercepted between the 
Horizon
 and the 
Circle of Position;
 and then you shall finde that the 
Circle of Position
 will in∣tersect the 
Ecliptick
 in 20 deg. of 
Taurus;
 which degrees must be set upon the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Twelfth House.


Secondly, Move the 
Circle of Position
 yet 
igher towards the 
Meridian,
 till 30 deg. more of the 
Equinoctial
 be intercepted between it and the 
Horizon,
 (in all 60 deg.) and when it so doth, you shall finde the 
Circle of Position
 will cut the 
Ecliptick
 in 36 deg. of 
Pisces;
 which point must be set upon the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Eleventh House.


The 
Meridian
 gives the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Tenth House
 in 25 deg. of 
Aquarius,
 as before.


Thirdly, Move the 
Semicircle of Position
 from the 
East-side
 of the 
Horizon
 to the 
West-side,
 and move it downwards from the 
Meridian,
 till 30 deg. of the 
Equinoctial
 be intercepted between the 
Meridian
 and 
Circle of Position,
 and then you shall finde that the 
Circle of Position
 will intersect the 
Ecliptick
 in 7 deg. of 
Aquarius;
 which point must be set upon the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Ninth House.


Fourthly, Move the 
Circle of Position
 yet lower by 30 deg. 
i. e.
 60 deg. from the 
Meridian
 downwards, and then you shall finde the 
Position-Circle
 to cut the 
Ecliptick
 in 21 deg. of 
Capricorn;
 which point must be set upon the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Eighth House.




The 
Descendant
 or 
Cuspis
 of the 
Seventh House
 is the Intersection of the 
West-side
 of the 
Horizon
 and 
Ecliptick,
 which is in 00 deg 29 min. of 
Capricorn,
 as before.


And thus have you found the 
Cuspises
 of the 
Four Houses
 above the 
Horizon,
 beside the 
Ascen∣dant
 and the 
Medium Coeli;
 viz. of the 12, 11 9 and 8 houses. Now the 
Cuspises
 of the Four other Houses under the 
Earth
 have the same de∣grees of the opposite Signes upon them: For,





20 deg. of 
Taurus


being upon the 
Cuspis
 of the


12


house






26 deg. of 
Pisces


11






7 deg. of 
Aquarius


9






21 deg. of 
Capricorn


8










20 deg. of 
Scorpio


will be on the 
Cusp
 of the


6


house.






26 deg. of 
Virgo


5






7 deg. of 
Leo


3






21 deg. of 
Leo


2






For the Six Signes 
Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo,
 are opposite to 
Libra, Scorpio, Sagitt. Capric. Aquar. Pisces.


And this is the manner how (by the 
Globe
) to erect a 
Figure
 according to the (reputed) 
Ra∣tional way
 of 
Regiomontanus.


Now if you would insert the places of the 
Planets
 into your 
Figure,
 (for it is them that

 the 
Astrologer
 principally giveth 
Judgement
 by) your best way will be to have recourse to some good 
Ephemeris
 (if you cannot 
Calculate
 them from 
Astronomical Tables
) and so may you finde the places of the se∣veral 
Planets
 at the time for which this 
Fi∣gure
 was 
Erected
 (viz. 
March
 10. 1675. 49 min. after 9 in the forenoon) to be as followeth. 
Viz.

 or

 you may place them in their Correspon∣dent places in your 
Figure,
 as is here done, and so is your 
Figure
 ready to give your Judgement upon.

II.
 To Erect a 
Figure
 of the Heavens for the forementioned time, 
Anno 1675, March 10
 day at 
49
 min. past 
9
 in the Morning. According to 
Campanus.


 THe 
Cuspises
 of the Four 
Cardinal Houses
 according to 
Campanus,
 viz. the 
Ascendent, Mid-heaven, Descendent,
 and 
Imum Coeli,
 are the same as they were according to 
Re∣giomontanus:


 But, as 
Regiomontanus
 divided the 
Houses
 by the 
Circle of Positions
 passing through each 30th degree of the 
Equinoctial,
 and inter∣secting the 
Ecliptick
 in the 
Cuspises
 of the several 
Houses; Campanus
 divides the 12 
Houses
 of Hea∣ven by the 
Position-Circles
 passing through each 30th degree of the 
prime Vertical Circle,
 (or 
A∣zimuth
 of 
East
 and 
West
) and so intersecting the 
Ecliptick
 in the 
Cuspises
 of the several 
Houses.
 So that to Erect a 
Figure
 according to 
Campanus
 way, you must do as followeth. 
Viz.


 You must first set the 
Globe
 to the 
La∣titude,
 bring the 
Suns place at noon
 for the day gi∣ven to the 
Meridian,
 and the 
Hour-index
 to 12, and the 
Circle of Position
 to the 
East-side
 of the 
Horizon;
 then turn the 
Globe
 about till the 
Index
 point at the 
given hour,
 and then fix the 
Globe.
 Thus far as in the former way of 
Regiomontanus;
 and the 
Cuspises
 of the 
First, Fourth, Seventh,
 and 
Tenth Houses
 will be the same as in his way. But now to proceed according to 
Campanus.


The 
Globe
 seated and fixed in this 
Position,
 bring the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 to the 
Zenith,
 and there fix it; and bring the lower part of the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 to the 
East
-point of the 
Horizon,
 and there keeping of it fixed:


1. Elevate the 
Circle of Position,
 till it cut 30 deg. of the 
Quadrant of Altitude,
 and then see what degrees of the 
Ecliptick
 are cut by the 
Po∣sition-Circle,
 which you shall finde to be 22 deg. of 
Aries;
 which point must be set upon the 
Cus∣pis
 of the 
Twelfth House.


2. Move the 
Circle of Position
 yet 30 deg. higher upon the 
Quadrant of Altitude,
 namely,

 to 60 deg. from the 
Horizon,
 and then see what degree of the 
Ecliptick
 is cut thereby, and you shall finde that the 
Position-circle
 cuts the 
Ecliptick
 in 12 deg. of 
Pisces,
 which must be set upon the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Eleventh House.


The 
Meridian
 cuts the 
Ecliptick
 in 25 deg. of 
Aquarius,
 which is the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Tenth House,
 or 
Mid-heaven,
 as before.


3. Remove the 
Circle of Position,
 and also the 
Quadrant of Altitude,
 from the 
East
 to the 
West-side
 of the 
Horizon,
 and there move him from the 
Meridian downwards,
 till 30 deg. of the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 be intercepted between the 
Zenith
 and the 
Circle of Position,
 and then see where the 
Po∣sition-circle
 cuts the 
Ecliptick,
 which will be in 12 deg. of 
Aquarius;
 and those degrees must be set upon the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Ninth House.


4. Let down the 
Circle of Position
 30 deg. more upon the 
Quadrant of Altitude,
 that is, 60 deg. distant from the 
Zenith,
 and then look what degrees of the 
Ecliptick
 are cut by the 
Position-Circle,
 which you will finde to be 28 deg. of 
Capricorn;
 which degrees must be set upon the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Eighth House.


The 
Cuspis
 of the 
Seventh House
 is 00 deg. 29 min. of 
Capricorn,
 being the Intersection of the 
West-side
 of the 
Horizon
 with the 
Eclip∣tick,
 as before.


And by this Artifice you have obtained the de∣grees belonging to the 1, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 8

 houses above the 
Horizon,
 according to the way prescribed by 
Campanus:
 Now the other 
Six
 Houses under the 
Horizon,
 viz. the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, are easily found, they being the opposite Points of the 
Ecliptick
 to the 
Six
 above the 
Ho∣rizon.
 So,

 To Erect a 
Figure
 of Heaven for the forementioned time, 
viz. March 10. 1675,
 at 
49
 min. af∣ter 
9
 in the Forenoon. According to 
Alcabitius.


Defini∣tion.] ALcabitius
 would have the XII 
Houses
 of Heaven to be divided by 
Domify∣ing Circles,
 or 
Circles of Position
 drawn from the 
Poles
 of the 
World
 through every 30th deg. of the 
Equator,
 beginning at the point of the 
E∣cliptick Ascending;
 and so counting 30 deg. upon

 the 
Equinoctial
 from thence, shall be the 
Cuspises
 of the several Houses. — Wherefore, to Erect a 
Figure
 according to this mode, do as followeth.


 You must 
Rectifie the Globe
 to the 
Latitude,
 bring the 
Suns place
 at noon to the 
Meridian,
 the 
Index
 of the 
Hour-wheel
 to 12 at noon, and turn the 
Globe
 about to the hour given, and then fix it; so shall the 
Ascendent
 be the same as in the two former ways, 
viz.
 00 deg. 29 min. of 
Cancer.


Then look what 
Meridian
 passeth through the 
Ascendent,
 and count 30 deg. more upon the 
E∣quinoctial;
 and that 
Meridian
 where it passeth through the 
Ecliptick
 shall be the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Twelfth House,
 and 30 deg. forwarder that 
Me∣ridian
 shall cut the 
Ecliptick
 in the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Eleventh House,
 and so onward till you come to the 
Cuspis
 o
 the 
Descendent.
 And thus,


If from that 
Meridian
 which passeth through 00 deg. 29 min. of the 
Ecliptick
 you count 30 deg. more upon the 
Equinoctial,
 you shall finde that

 then entering

 in the Meridian of 
Lon∣don.
 According to the way prescribed by 
Pto∣lomy.


Defini∣tion.] PTolomy
 adviseth that the 
Heavens
 should be divided into 12 
Houses
 or 
Mansions,
 by 
Domifying Circles
 drawn through the 
Poles
 of the 
Ecliptick,
 and through every 30th deg. thereof from the 
Ascendant
 down∣wards, round about. — Wherefore to Erect a 
Figure
 of the Heavens according to this way of 
Ptolomy,
 do thus.


 Rectifie the 
Globe
 and 
Hour-circle
 as before, and you shall have the same 
Ascendant,
 viz. 00 deg. 29 min. of 
Cancer
 to 
Ascend,
 which is the 
Cuspis
 of the 
First House;
 then 30 deg. for∣warder, downwards, will be 00 deg. 29 min. of 
Leo,
 for the 
Cuspis
 of the 
Second House,
 &c.

Star
 or 
Planet
 is, you have heretofore defined; and in the last 
Problem
 you are taught how to 
Erect
 a 
Figure
 of the 
Heavens Four
 several ways. Now if you would see (upon the 
Globe
 it self) in what 
House
 any of the 
Planets
 are, without Erecting a 
Figure,
 you were best to make 
Marks,
 or set 
Cha∣racters
 of those 
Planets, Comets,
 or the like, upon the 
Globe,
 before you delineate your 
Figure
 upon Paper; which to effect, do thus.






I.
 By the 
Longitude
 and 
Latitude
 given.


If the 
Latitude
 of the 
Star, Planet,
 or 
Comet
 be



Northward


Southward


 Elevate the



North-pole


South-pole


 of the 
Globe
 to 66
d.
 30
m.


then will the 
Pole
 of the 
Ecliptick
 be in the 
Ze∣nith,
 and the 
Ecliptick circle
 will lie in the very Plain of the 
Horizon;
 in which Position of the 
Globe,
 screw the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 in the 
Ze∣nith,
 over the 
Pole
 of the 
Ecliptick.
 — This done, bring the point of 
Longitude
 of the 
Planet in the Ecliptick
 to the 
Quadrant of Altitude,
 and count the 
Latitude
 of the 
Planet
 upon the 
Qua∣drant,
 and under the degree of 
Latitude
 shall be the 
point
 upon the 
Globe
 in which the 
Planet
 or 
Star
 in the Heavens is.


And so the 
Longitude
 of the 
Seven Planets
 be∣ing as it is expressed in the following 
Table,
 such 
Longitude
 and 
Latitude
 they had at the time of the 
Erection
 of the former 
Figure, March
 10. 1675, at 49 min. after 9 in the Forenoon. Now, if you finde their respective Points upon the 
Globe
 (as I have now shewed you how to do) you may then, not only see in what 
House
 each of them shall be, but also what 
Fixed Stars
 are there, and what 
Fixed Stars
 are in the oth
r 
Houses
 also.

II. 
By the
 Right Ascension 
and
 Declina∣tion 
given.


Suppose a 
Star, Planet,
 or 
Comet
 to have 147 deg. 43 min. of 
Right Ascension,
 and 33 deg. 33 min. of 
North Declination,
 as the Star 
Regu∣lus,
 or the 
Lions Heart
 hath, and you would finde its place upon the 
Globe;


Count 147 deg. 43 min. the Stars 
Right As∣cension
 upon the 
Equinoctial
 from the beginning of 
Aries,
 and bring that point of the 
Equinoctial
 to the 
General Meridian;
 and keeping the 
Globe
 there, count 33 deg. 33 min. the Stars 
Declination
 up∣on the 
Meridian
 upwards, (because the Stars 
De∣clination
 is 
Northward
) and that point shall be the place of 
Regulus
 upon the 
Globe.
 And thus may any part, or point, in the 
Heavens
 be found upon the 
Globe,
 if either the 
Longitude
 and 
Lati∣tude,
 or the 
Right Ascension
 and 
Declination
 of that point be first known.










PROB. III.
 To know in what 
House,
 or under what 
Circle
 of 
Position,
 any 
Star, Planet,
 or point of the 
Ecliptick
 is.


REctifie the 
Globe
 to the 
Latitude,
 the 
Qua∣drant of Altitude
 to the 
Zenith,
 the place of the 
Sun
 in the 
Ecliptick
 to the 
Meridian,
 and the 
Hour-circle
 to 12; then turn the 
Globe
 about to the hour given, and bring the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 to the 
East
 or 
West
 points of the 
Horizon,
 and there fix the 
Globe:
 Then move the 
Circle of Position
 upwards, till it touch the 
Star, Planet,
 or other Points of the 
Ecliptick,
 which you desire to know the 
Circle of Position
 of, then shall the 
Posi∣tion-circle
 cross the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 in the number of that 
Circle of Position
 in which that 
Star, Planet,
 or other Point of the 
Ecliptick
 is.


Thus, If at the time of the Erection of the former 
Figure
 it were required to know in what 
Circle of Position
 (or house) the 
Pleiades
 or 
Se∣ven Stars
 was; Rectifie the 
Globe
 as before, and bring the 
Position-circle
 to the 
Pleiades,
 then shall the 
Circle of Position
 cut the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 in 42 deg. and under that 
Circle of Position
 is the 
Pleiades
 or 
Seven Stars
 at that time, and so con∣sequently in the XIIth House.


I might here shew how to finde the place of the 
Thing
 which 
Astrologers
 call the 
Part of For∣tune.


 Also how (as they call it) to 
Direct a Figure,
 and to finde out 
Revolutions,
 &c. But forasmuch as these things are not so 
Mathema∣tical
 as to require a 
Globe,
 or other 
Mathemati∣cal Instruments,
 either to 
Demonstrate
 them by, or to ease the 
Operation;
 I shall refer them that have occasion for such 
things,
 to the 
A∣rithmetical working
 of them by the Pen, as most convenient, and reserve the 
Globes
 for other purposes.






PROB. IV.
 Of the 
Planetary hours,
 how to finde the 
Length
 thereof, and what 
Planet
 at is that 
Reigneth
 any common 
hour
 of the 
day
 or 
night.


 A 
Planetary hour
 for the day, is the 12th part of the 
Artificial day
 counted from the time of the 
Suns Rising
 to its 
Setting;
 and a 
Planetary hour
 for the night, is the 12th part of the 
Artificial night
 counted from the time of the 
Sun Setting
 to the time of its next 
Rising:
 So that the 
Planetary hours
 are not of the same length all the year long, as the 
Common hours
 of 60 min. are, but are some times of the year 
longer,
 and sometimes 
shorter.
 — For, when the 
Artificial day
 is above 12 hours long, (as it is all the time that the 
Sun
 is in the 
Six Northern Signes
) then doth a 
Planetary hour


 contain more than 60 min. — And when the 
Artificial day
 is less than 12 hours long, (as it is all the time that the 
Sun
 is in the 
Six Southern Signes
) then doth the 
Planetary hour
 contain less than 60 min. — But when the 
Sun
 is in the 
Equinoctial,
 and the 
Artificial day
 and 
night
 are equal (each containing just 12 hours) then the 
Common hour
 and the 
Planetary hour
 are the same, either of them containing just 60 min.


 The 
Planetary hours
 take their denominations from the 
Planetary names
 of the 
days
 of the 
week,
 as





Sunday


hath for its 
Planetary name


Sol.






Monday


Luna.






Tuesday


Mars.






Wednesday


Mercury.






Thursday


Jupiter.






Friday


Venus.






Saturday


Saturn.






So that upon whatsoever 
day
 of the 
week
 you would know what 
Planetary hour
 it is, the first 
Planetary hour
 of that 
day
 or 
night
 is called by the 
Planetary name
 of that 
day
 of the 
week;
 as, if it be 
Monday,
 then 
Luna
 governs the 
first Planetary hour
 that 
day
 and 
night;
 if 
Sunday, Sol;
 if 
Wednesday, Mercury,
 &c.




I.
 To finde the 
length
 of a 
Planetary hour
 at any time.


 For the day proposed, (after you

 have rectified the 
Globe
 to the 
Latitude,
 &c.) bring the 
Suns place
 in the 
Ecliptick
 for that day to the 
East-side
 of the 
Horizon,
 and see what de∣gree of the 
Equinoctial
 is cut by the 
Horizon;
 then bring the 
Suns place
 to the 
Meridian,
 and then again see what degree of the 
Equinoctial
 is then cut by the 
Horizon:
 the difference of those degrees being divided by Six, because there are 6 
Planetary hours
 between Sun-Rising and our 12 at noon (which is always the 
Sixth Planetary hour
) and that Quotient shall be the number of mi∣nutes contained in a 
Planetary hour
 all that day. Thus for 
Example,
 on 
Tuesday
 the 27 of 
July
 1675, the 
Suns place
 will be found to be in 14 deg. of 
Leo;
 bring 14 deg. of 
Leo
 to the 
East-part
 of the 
Horizon,
 and you shall finde that 115 deg. of the 
Equinoctial
 are (at that time) cut by the 
Horizon;
 which degrees note down, or mark upon the 
Globe.
 — Then bring 14 deg. of 
Leo
 to the 
Meridian,
 and then you shall finde 226 deg. of the 
Equinoctial
 cut by the 
Horizon;
 so that if you take with your Compasses, or count the number of degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 con∣tained between 115 deg. and 226 deg. you shall finde them to be 111 deg. [or if you substract 115 from 226, which is easiest, the difference will be 111 also] and so many degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 do pass the 
Meridian
 in 
Six Planetary hours:
 Wherefore divide 111 by 6, and in the Quotient you shall finde 18 deg. 30 min. to pass th
 
Equinoctial
 in 
One Planetary hour;
 and so counting 15 deg. for 1 hour, and 1 deg. for 4 min. of time, you shall finde the 
length
 of the 
Planetary hour
 to contain 
One Common hour
 and

 14 min. more, which is one hour and a quarter wanting one minute. — And the length of a 
Planetary hour
 for the 
night
 will contain only 46 min. which is less than 
One Common hour
 by a quarter wanting one minute.






II.
 To finde what 
Planetary hour
 of the 
day
 or 
night
 it is.


On the forementioned day, 
Tuesday
 the 27 of 
July
 1675, Let it be required to know what 
Planet
 ruleth that day at 5 of the clock in the afternoon. The length of the 
Planetary hour
 for that day is 1 hour 14 min. Wherefore, the 
Globe
 being Rectified, bring the 
Index
 of the Hour-circle to 5 a clock, and then count the num∣ber of degrees which were cut by the 
Horizon
 in the last operation, and the degrees of the 
Equi∣noctial
 now at the 
Horizon,
 and you shall finde them to be 187 deg. which reduced into minutes of time (by multiplying them by 4) gives 748, which 748 min. being divided by 74, the number of minutes contained in one 
Planetary hour,
 the Quotient will be 10 hours and 8 min. shewing that there are 10 
Planetary hours
 past, since the Sun-Rising, and that there are 8 min. of the E∣leventh hour past also.








III.
 To finde what 
Planet governeth
 that 
hour
 of the 
day.


For the effecting hereof, the 
Globe
 standeth you in no stead at all; wherefore observe the 
Ta∣ble
 following and its 
Ʋse.

The use of the aforesaid Table.


Having by former 
Rule
 found what 
Planetary hour
 it is, if you would know what 
Planet
 it is that 
Reigneth
 that 
hour,
 in the 
head
 of this 
Table
 seek the day of the 
week
 (in this 
Example Tues∣day
) and the 
Planetary hour
 of the 
day
 (in this 
Example
 10 hours in the Forenoon:) in the same 
Column,
 and right against it in the 
first Column
 on the 
left hand,
 you shall finde 
Venus,
 which shews that at 5 of the clock in the afternoon that day 
Venus
 governeth, and hath governed 8 min. of her 
hour.


Also in the same 
Table
 you shall finde against 10 under 
Tuesday
 in the 
last Column
 towards the 
right hand,
 the word 
Mars,
 shewing that 
Mars
 governeth the 10th 
Planetary hour
 for the 
night,
 and hath governed 8 min. of his 
hour.










POSTSCRIPT.


FOrasmuch as the two first 
Sections
 of the fore∣going 
Problem
 are for the more part performed by 
Arithmetical computation,
 and not 
Globular Operation;
 I have (for that it may be satisfa∣ctory to some persons) added a 
Table,
 whereby, if you know but at what hour the 
Sun riseth
 at any time of the 
year,
 you may know readily the length of the 
Planetary hour,
 and also at any 
Common hour
 of the day or night, what 
Planetary hour
 it is, and also what 
Planet ruleth
 that hour.








A TABLE, Shewing the length of The PLANETARY HOUR For any hour of the Day or Night At any time of the Year, 
&c.

The 
Table
 described.


EAch Page of the 
Table
 consisteth of 7 
Co∣lumns:
 in the first 
Column
 of each Page, to∣wards the 
left hand,
 is placed the time of the 
Suns Rising,
 and in the 
Six
 subsequent 
Columns
 are placed the beginnings and continuances of of the 
Planetary hours.
 — The first of the four Pages contain the Six 
Planetary hours
 for the 
Day,
 viz. I, II, III, IV, V, and VI, from 
Sun-rising
 to 
Noon.
 — The second Page contains the other Six 
Planetary hours
 for the 
Day,
 viz. VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII, from 
Noon
 to 
Sun setting.
 — The third Page contains the first Six 
Planetary hours
 for the 
Night,
 viz. the I, II, III, IV, V, and VI, from 
Sun-setting
 till 
Midnight.
 — And the fourth Page contains the other Six 
Planetary hours
 for the 
Night,
 viz. the VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII, from 
Midnight
 till 
Sun-rising
 the next Morning. Thus much for the 
Description.
 Now followeth






The Ʋse of the 
Table.


LEt it be required to finde what 
Planet Ruleth
 upon 
Friday
 the 27 of 
March,
 at 10 of the clock in the Forenoon.


First, You must finde the time of the 
Suns Rising
 for the day proposed, by the 
Astronomical Problem
 for that purpose; which you shall finde to be at 22 min. after 5 in the Morning.




Secondly, Finde this 5 hours and 22 min. in the 
first Column
 towards the 
left hand,
 and look along that 
line
 towards the 
right hand,
 and you shall finde under the first 
Planetary hour
 6 hou. 28 min. which is the time of the 
first Planetary hour;
 under the 
second,
 7 hou. 35 min. for the 
third
 8 hou. 41 min. 
&c.
 Now, because 10 of the clock is the time that I require the 
Planetary hour,
 I continue looking along that 
line,
 till I finde 10 of the clock, and I finde 10 hou. 54 min. to stand under the 
fifth Planetary hour;
 which shews that it is the 
fifth Planetary hour,
 and that that 
hour
 did begin at 47 min. after 9 of the clock, and will continue till 54 min. after 10 of the clock.


Now to know what 
Planet
 it is that 
Ruleth
 at that time, repair to the foregoing 
Table,
 and finde 
Friday
 in the head thereof, and the 
Common hour
 of the day given (in our Example 10.) un∣der 
Friday;
 and right against 10 towards the 
left hand,
 you shall finde 
Luna,
 which sheweth that 
Luna Rules,
 and will continue 
Ruling
 till 54 min. after 10 of the clock.


The like is to be understood of all the rest: and if it be the 
Night-hour,
 in the little 
Table
 you must finde the name of the 
Ruling Planet
 on the 
right hand
 of the 
Table.


Note, That if you cannot finde the very exact time of 
Sun-rising
 in the 
Table,
 you must make use of that which is neerest to it, which will be sufficient for this purpose.
















GEOGRAPHY AND NAVIGATION Made easie: OR, A plain Description and Use of the Terrestrial GLOBE. 




INTRODƲCTION.


THe 
Terrestrial
 or 
Earthly Globe
 is an artifi∣cial Representation of the Earth and Water under that form and figure of roundness which they are known to have describing the Scituations, and measuring the distances of all their parts.


The Land drawn out upon a 
Globe,
 is bounded and distinguished from the Water with an irre∣gular line which runs turning and winding into Creeks and Angles like as the shoar which it re∣presents: that side which is left uncoloured, is the limits of the water; the other side of the Line which encircles the Colours, is the bounds of the Land, which is either Continent or Island.


A 
Continent
 is a great quantity of Land not environed or separated by the Sea, in which ma∣ny Kingdoms and Countries are contained; as

 
Europe, Asia,
 &c. An 
Island
 is a part of the Earth clasp'd in the embraces of the Sea, and hoopt as it were with a watery Girdle, as 
Great Britain
 and 
Ireland.
 These again are subdivi∣ded into 
Peninsula's, Isthmus's, Promontories, Capes, &c.
 A 
Peninsula
 or 
Pene-Insula
 is a part of Land which being almost environed and incompassed round with water, is joyned to the firm Land by some little 
Isthmus,
 as 
Africa
 is joyned to 
Asia,
 or 
Morea
 to 
Greece.
 An 
Isthmus
 is a little narrow neck of Land betwixt two Seas, joyning a 
Peninsula
 to the 
Continent;
 as that of 
Darien
 in 
A∣merica,
 or 
Corinth
 in 
Greece.
 A 
Promontorie
 is 
Mons
 in 
Mari prominens,
 a high Hill or Mountain lying out as an Elbow of land into the Sea, the utmost end of which is called a 
Cape;
 as the 
Cape
 of 
Good Hope,
 and 
Cape Verde.

Terrestrial Globe,

 Terrestrial Globe.








Of Water and its Parts.


THe Earth (as was said defore) is encom∣passed about with the Water, which is ei∣ther 
Ocean, Seas, Straits, Creeks, Lakes,
 or 
Ri∣vers.


The 
Ocean
 is a general Collection or Rendez∣vouz of all waters.


The 
Sea
 is a part of the 
Ocean,
 and is either Exterior, lying open to the shore, as the 
British
 or 
Arabian
 Seas; or Interior, lying within the Land, to which you must pass through some 
Strait,
 as the 
Mediterranean
 or 
Baltick
 Seas.


A 
Strait
 is a narrow Part or Arm of the 
O∣cean,
 lying betwixt two shores, and opening a way into the 
Sea,
 as the 
Straits
 of 
Gibralter,
 the 
Hellespont,
 &c.


A 
Creek
 is a small narrow part of the 
Sea
 that goeth up but a little way into the Land, other∣wise called a 
Bay,
 a 
Station
 or 
Road
 for Ships.


A 
Lake
 is that which continually retains and keeps water in it, as the 
Lake Nicurgua
 in 
America,
 and 
Zaire
 in 
Africa.


A 
River
 is a small Branch of the 
Sea
 flowing into the Land, courting the Banks while their Arms display to embrace her silver Waves.






Of the Names of the 
Ocean.


FIrst of all, according to the four Quarters it had four Names; from the 
East
 it was cal∣led the 
Eastern-Ocean,
 from the 
West
 the 
Western,
 from the 
North
 the 
Northern,
 and from the 
South


 the 
Southern.
 But besides these more general Names, it hath other particular appellations, ac∣cording to the Regions or Countries it boundeth upon, and the Nature of the Sea: 
viz.
 as it lies extended toward the 
East,
 it is called the 
Chinean
 Sea, from the adjacent Country of 
China;
 so the 
Archipelago
 of St. 
Lazarus,
 from the multitude of Islands. Toward the 
South,
 'tis called 
Oceanus In∣dicus,
 or the 
Indian
 Sea, because upon it lies the 
Indians.
 The Golph of 
Bengala,
 from 
Bengala
 a City in the 
Indies.
 Where it touches the Coast of 
Persia,
 it is called 
Mare Perficum:
 so also 
Mare Arabicum,
 from 
Arabia;
 so towards the 
West,
 is the 
Aethiopian
 Sea. Then the 
Atlantick
 Ocean, from 
Atlas
 a Mountain or Promontory in 
Africa;
 by the 
Spaniards
 called 
Mar del zur,
 as also 
Mare Pacificum;
 and on the other side of 
America
 is called by them 
Mar del Nort.
 Where it touches upon 
Spain,
 it was called 
Oceanus Cantabricus,
 now the Bay of 
Biscay.
 The Sea between 
England
 and 
France
 is called the 
Chanel;
 between 
Eng∣land
 and 
Ireland,
 the 
Irish
 Sea, by some St. 
George
's Chanel: between 
England
 and 
Holland,
 it is called by some the 
German
 Ocean, by others the 
Brittish
 Seas; 
Vulgò,
 the Narrow Seas: be∣yond 
Scotland
 it is called 
Marc Caledonium;
 higher towards the 
North,
 it is called the 
Hyper∣borean
 or 
Frozen
 Sea; more 
Eastward
 upon the Coast of 
Tartaria,
 the 
Tartarian
 Sea, 
&c.
 And this shall suffice concerning the 
Ocean,
 or Exterior 
Seas.








The Names of the 
Inland Seas.


THe 
Baltick
 Sea, of old 
Sinus Codanus,
 by some called the 
East-Sea,
 by the Inhabi∣tants the 
Belt,
 lying between 
Denmark
 and 
Swe∣den,
 the entrance whereof is called the 
Sound.


Secondy, The 
Euxine
 Sea, or the 
Black
 Sea, by some 
Mare Caucasium, Scythicum, Sarmaticum, Colchicum;
 by the 
Turks, Caradinizi:
 to which joyns 
Meotis Palus,
 now 
Mar de Zabacken.


The third, is the 
Caspian
 or 
Hircanian
 Sea; by the 
Turks, Mar de Sala;
 by the 
Persians,
 the Sea of 
Backu;
 by the 
Moscovites, Chwalenskei Ma∣re.
 The length is from 
North
 to 
South,
 and the breadth from 
East
 to 
West,
 contrary to all the Antient 
Geographers;
 which is certainly discover∣ed, not only by the exact observation of 
Olearius,
 but also by his curious enquiries of the true Scitu∣ation of its Maritime places acccording to the Longitude and Latitude of the 
Persians,
 as also by the 
Astronomical Calculations
 of Mr. 
Graves,
 &c.


The fourth, is the 
Arabian Golph, Mare Ery∣thaeum,
 or 
Rubrum, Vulgò
 the Red-sea; by others 
Mare Rasso,
 and 
Mar de Mecca.


The fifth, is the 
Persian
 Golph, or the Golph 
de Elcatife.


The sixth, is 
Mare Mediterraneum;
 by the 
Eng∣lish,
 the 
Straits;
 by the 
Spaniards, Mar de Le∣vant:
 the beginning or entrance of it is called the 
Straits
 of 
Gibralter,
 rather 
Gibraltarec, olim Gaditanus.
 This Sea hath many names, as it tou∣cheth upon several Countries; the particular ac∣count

 whereof I shall refer to 
Geographical
 de∣scription of 
Maps,
 &c. The length of it is by our 
New Globes
 not 37 deg. of the 
Equinoctial
 from 
Tanger
 to 
Scanderone:
 by other 
Globes
 and 
Maps
 it is more than 42 deg. of the 
Equinoctial.
 And this shall suffice for a Description of the Water, and its Parts.


Now that all Places, Cities, Towns, Seas, Ri∣vers, Lakes, 
&c.
 may be readily found out upon the 
Globe,
 all 
Geographers
 do or should place them according to their 
Longitude
 and 
Latitude:
 the use of which in the absolute sense, is to make out the position of any place in respect of the whole 
Globe,
 or to shew the Scituation and di∣stance of one place from & in respect of any other.






An Advertisement concerning 
Longitude.


To say the truth, by reason of the variety of
 Me∣ridians, 
the
 Longitudes 
are grown to such an un∣certainty and confused pass, that 'tis not every mans work to set them down. This indeed I have ob∣served, that many
 Geographers, 
or rather discribers of particular places, tell us that such a place is so many degrees of
 Longitude; 
but from what
 Meri∣dian, 
others must guess. Some particularly profess to follow
 Mercator: 
but what are most men the wi∣ser for this? for
 Mercator
's
 Meridian 
was not al∣ways the same; sometimes through the
 Canary 
I∣slands, sometimes through the
 Azores. 
Others again will tell you their
 Meridian 
shall pass through the
 Azores; 
but whether from that of St.
 Michael, 
or that of
 Corvo, 
is not set down; and yet
 6 
deg.

 of difference. I shall therefore take this course: First, set down the several
 Meridians 
observed. Se∣condly, the difference of
 Longitude 
betwixt these
 Meridians. 
Lastly, which of these I have fixt upon.


1. The 
Great Meridian
 by 
Ptolomy
 and most of the antient and Greek 
Geographers
 was made to pass through 
Junonca
 one of the Fortunate, now thought to be the 
Canary
 Islands.


2. By the 
Arabian
 and 
Nubian Geographers
 through the utmost point of the 
Western
 shore neer 
Hercules
 Pillars.


3. 
Ortelius
 in his sheet-
Europe
 makes 
London
 to lie in 28 deg. of 
Longitude;
 but in the Sheet∣maps of 
France
 and 
Belgia
 it lies in but 21 deg. so that his first 
Meridian
 to me is yet unknown. The 
Spaniards
 since the Conquest of the 
West-In∣dies,
 contrary to all other, account their 
Longitude
 from 
East
 to 
West,
 beginning at 
Toledo.


4. Our Modern 
Geographers,
 as 
Mercator, Cambden, Speed
 and others, removed it into the 
Azores;
 some placing it at St. 
Michaels,
 others at 
Corvo.


5. 
Blaew
 the Dutch 
Geographer
 begins his 
Longitudes
 from 
Tenerif
 one of the 
Canary
 I∣slands; but upon his 
Great Map,
 the 
Great Meridi∣an
 passeth through 
Tercera
-Isle, one of the 
Azores;
 which the rest of their 
Common Map
-makers, 
De Wit, Visher,
 &c. as well as many of our 
English,
 are bound to follow through ignorance, transcri∣bing as well his Errours as his Copies for the best.


6. 
Sanson
 the French 
Geographer,
 for some

 Reasons (best known to himself) begins his 
Longitudes
 at 
Ferro
 one of the 
Canary
-Islands; and therefore 
Blome
 his Translator is bound to follow it, though possibly he cannot tell so much, and yet the Kingdoms great pretender to 
Geo∣graphy.


7. The English 
Hydrographer
 tells us, that with a great deal of Reason and Consideration he placed his first 
Meridian
 at 
Graciosa
 one of the Islands of the 
Azores;
 but it is delineated upon his 
Globes
 and 
Maps
 through 
Tercera,
 almost 2 deg. more 
Eastward:
 a small mistake, that ano∣ther must come after him to tell himself what 
Meridian
 he went by.


Secondly, The differences of these several 
Meridians
 I finde are thus stated.


From 
Ptolomies Meridian
 to the 
Arabian Meri∣dian
 was by 
Abalfeda
 in his Introduction to his 
Geography
 accounted to be 10 deg. of the 
Equa∣tor; Briet
 saith but 8 deg.

Great Meridian;
 and is either 
North

PROB. III.
 The 
Longitude
 and 
Latitude
 of any place being known, to finde the true Scituati∣on of it, though not expressed upon the 
Globe.


 BRing the degree of the 
Equator
 that answereth to the 
Longitude
 of the place to the 
Meridian,
 and then reckon the 
Lati∣tude
 of the place upon the degrees of the 
Meri∣dian
 towards either 
Pole
 according as it is either 
North
 or 
South Latitude;
 and right under that de∣gree and minute upon the 
Meridian,
 is the true Scituation of the place enquired after.






PROB. IV.
 To finde what time or hour of the 
Day
 or 
Night
 it is in any part of the Earth.


 BY reason of the earths diurnal moti∣on round the 
Sun
 in 24 hours, the 
Sun
 enlightning but one half of it at the same time, it comes to pass that when it is Morning in one place, it is Noon in a second, Night in a third, and Midnight in a fourth, according to their se∣veral Scituations in respect of 
East
 and 
West
 one from the other. This difference of time is known by the number of degrees contained in

 the 
Equator
 between any two places proposed converted into hours and minutes, reckoning 15 deg. to an hour, 
&c.
 but more readily by the 
Globe
 thus:


 Suppose at 
London,
 at 12 of the clock at Noon, you would know what a clock it is at 
Mexico
 in the 
West-Indies;
 bring 
London
 to the 
Meridian,
 and set the 
Index
 of the Hour-cir∣cle to 12. then turn the 
Globe Eastward,
 because 
London
 is 
East
 of 
Mexico,
 till you bring 
Mexico
 to the 
Meridian;
 then see what hour the 
Index
 points at, for that is the hour then at 
Mexico.
 Thus you will finde,

when it is 12 a clock at 
Lon∣don,
 it is at

And thus by knowing what difference of time there is between place and place at 12 a clock, the like difference is to be understood of all other hours.








PROB. V.
 To finde the distance of any two places up∣on the 
Globe
 one from another.


 LAy the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 upon both the places required; then count the number of degrees of the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 contained between the two places: which being found, multiply them by 60, gives the di∣stance in English Miles. Thus you will finde

If you finde (as you needs must) that the proportion of Miles upon these new 
Globes
 do very much differ from those distances set down by other Authors, you are desired not to think much; for the 
Longitudes
 are not yet exactly agreed on: the perfection is not one mans, nor one ages work, and must be waited for. Where you finde the places upon this 
Globe
 to agree with others, you have cause to suspect they have lain upon the

 lees of time, not as yet inquired into: where you finde them to disagree, you may conclude that they have been brought to a truer correction and amendment.






PROB. VI.
 To finde the 
Position,
 or what Point of the 
Compass
 any two places are Scituate one from another.


 THe Position is an 
Angle
 which is made by the meeting of the 
Meridian
 of one place, with the 
Vertical Circle
 of another.


 To finde this out, you are to ele∣vate the 
Pole
 to the 
Latitude
 of one of the places, suppose 
London;
 then bring it to the 
Meridian,
 and it will fall out to be directly in the 
Zenith,
 for the Elevation is always equal to the 
Latitude;
 then fasten the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 to the 
Ze∣nith,
 and turn it about till it fall upon the other place, suppose the Isle of 
Tenerif,
 and the end of the 
Quadrant
 where it toucheth the 
Horizon
 will shew that the Isle 
Tenerif
 beareth from 
London
 S S W: so also the bearing of 
Barbadoes
 from the 
Lizard
 to be S W, half a point 
Westerly;
 and the opposite point N E, half a point 
Easterly,
 the bearing of the 
Lizard
 from the 
Barbadoes.








PROB. VII.
 To know at any time in what place of the Earth the 
Sun
 is in their 
Zenith.


This must be to such Inhabitants of the Earth only that inhabit in the 
Torrid Zone
 between the 
Tropicks.


 BRing the place you are in, suppose 
London,
 to the 
Meridian,
 and the 
Index
 to the hour 12; then consider the time of the day, which suppose to be half an hour after 5 in the afternoon, the 
Sun
 having then 10 deg. of 
North
-Declination: then because it is after∣noon, turn the body of the 
Globe Eastward,
 till the 
Index
 hath passed 5 hours and ½, from 12, that will be to 7 a clock and ½, and there stay the 
Globe;
 then see what place or Country is under the 
Meridian
 that cuts 10 deg. of 
North
 Declina∣tion, and you will finde 
Nombre di dios
 upon the 
Isthmus
 of 
Panama
 in the 
West-Indies.
 But if it were required the same day at half an hour after 6 in the Morning, then you should have turned the 
Globe Westward
 till the 
Index
 had passed 6 hours and ½: and then under the 
Meridian,
 and upon the parallel of 10 deg. 
North
-Declination, you will finde it neer 4 or 5 little Islands close by the 
West-side
 of 
Mallacca
 in the 
East-Indies,
 where the 
Sun
 will be in 
Zenith
 at that time.


Having found in what place of the Earth the

 
Sun
 is in the 
Zenith,
 elevate the 
Globe
 to the 
La∣titude
 of the place either 
North
 or 
South;
 then bring that place to the 
Meridian,
 so shall all pla∣ces cut by the 
Horizon
 have the 
Sun
 in their 
Ho∣rizon;
 those to the 
Westward
 shall have the 
Sun-rising
 in their 
Horizon;
 those to the 
Eastward
 shall have the 
Sun-setting.
 In those Coun∣tries that are above the 
Horizon
 it is day-light, and in those but 18 deg. below the 
Horizon,
 it is twilight; but in those Countries further below the 
Horizon,
 it is at that time midnight.






PROB. VIII.
 The difference of 
Longitude
 being known, to finde what degree of the 
Ecliptick
 culminates at any other place at any time proposed.


March
 the 10th at 10 of the clock before noon here at 
London,
 I would know what degree of the 
Ecliptick
 culminates then at 
Jerusalem.


 ELevate the 
Globe
 to the 
Latitude
 of your place, 
viz.
 51 deg. 30 min. then bring the 
Suns place
 for that day, 
viz.
 ♈ 0 deg. to the 
Meridian,
 and the 
Index
 to 12. then turn the 
Globe Eastward
 till the 
Index
 point at the given hour, 
viz.
 10 of the clock, and you will finde the 28 deg. of ♒ then culminating here at 
London.
 Next turn about the 
Globe West∣ward
 until 33 deg. 30 min. of the 
Equator
 be

 passed through the 
Meridian,
 or till the 
Index
 of the Hour-circle be moved 2 hours 35 min. which is the difference of 
Longitude
 given, and then you will finde the 
Meridian
 cut the 
Ecliptick
 at almost 4 deg. of ♈: so that I say, ♈ 4 deg. is the point of the 
Ecliptick
 that is then culmina∣ting at 
Jerusalem.






PROB. IX.
 To finde out the several 
Positions
 of the Inhabitants of the Earth, the distincti∣on of Shadows, the different Habitati∣ons, 
&c.


THe 
Longitude
 and 
Latitude
 of a place once resolved on, the 
Position
 of the 
Sphere
 you cannot miss of; for if the place you try for have no 
Latitude,
 it must of necessity lie under the 
Equator;
 and therefore in a 
Right Position:
 if it have less or more 
Latitude,
 the 
Position
 is Ob∣lique; if the place have 90 deg. of 
Latitude,
 the 
Position
 is Parallel: the Reasons were told before, and may evidently be discerned upon the 
Globe.


For the Climes and Parallels, and consequent∣ly the length of the longest day, the fore-know∣ledge of the 
Latitude
 leadeth you directly; for they who are under the 
Equator,
 have their day always 12 hours, and their night 12 hours long. Now as each Country declines from the 
Equa∣tor
 towards either of the 
Poles,
 so the daies vary their length in Summer, and the nights theirs in

 Winter: according therefore to the different lengthening of their daies, the Antients did di∣stinguish the Earth into several portions or parts, which they called Climates and Parallels: every Clime contains two Parallels; so that where the longest daies are half an hour longer than at the 
Equator,
 the first Climate begins; and where they are encreased an hour longer than at the 
E∣quator,
 the second Climate begins, which by the 20th 
Problem
 you will finde to be at 8 deg. 34 min. for the first, and at 16 deg. 43 min. where the second begins; and so for any of the rest.


The 
Tropicks
 and 
Polar circles
 divide the Sur∣face of the 
Globe
 into 5 parts o
 spaces, which are called 
Zones,
 whereof one is contained within the 
Arctick-circle,
 another compassed by the 
An∣tartick-circle,
 and are called the 
Frigid Zones;
 The other two lying between the 
Arctick-circle
 and 
Tropick
 of 
Cancer,
 and between the 
Antar∣ctick-circle,
 and the 
Tropick
 of 
Capricorn,
 are called the 
Temperate Zones;
 and the other lying between the two 
Tropicks,
 is called the 
Torrid
 or 
Mid-zone.


Knowing these, you may easily conclude upon the distinction of Shadows: for those of the 
Frigid Zones
 are termed 
Periscii,
 because there their Shadows have a Circular motion. Those of the 
Temperate Zone
 are called 
Heteroscii,
 because their 
Meridian
-shadows bend toward either 
Pole;
 towards the 
North
 to those that dwell within the 
Tropick
 of 
Cancer,
 and the 
Arctick-circle;
 towards the 
South
 to those that dwell within the 
Tropick
 of 
Capricorn
 and the 
Antarctick-circle.
 The In∣habitants of the 
Torrid Zone
 were called 
Amphris∣cii,


 because the Noon-shadows according to the time of the year do sometimes fall towards the 
North
 when the 
Sun
 is in the 
Southern
 signes, and sometimes towards the 
South
 when the 
Sun
 is in the 
Northern
 signes.




To finde out the other distinction of Habi∣tation, 
viz. Antaeci, Periaeci, Antipodes.


LEt 
London
 be the place; bring it to the 
Me∣ridian,
 where you finde it to be 51 deg. 30 min. elevated above the 
Equator,
 account so many degrees of 
Southern Latitude
 below the 
E∣quator,
 and you meet with the 
Antaeci
 (if any be.) Remove 
London
 from the 
Meridian
 180 deg. and you shall finde your 
Periaeci
 under the 
Meridian
 where 
London
 was before, and your 
Antipodes
 is in the place where their 
Antaeci
 stood before.














NAUTICAL Problems. 
INTRODƲCTION.




INTRODƲCTION.


THere be four things upon which the pra∣ctice of 
Navigation
 is principally groun∣ded, 
viz.
 1. 
Longitude,
 2. 
Latitude,
 3. 
Course,
 4. 
Distance.


As for the 
Longitude,
 though it may be found by the other, yet hitherto there hath not been published any general Rule true and practicable, whereby the 
Longitudes
 of places may be imme∣diately and ordinarily found out of themselves.


The 
Latitudes
 of places may be immediately found out by observation of 
Sun
 or 
Stars,
 as shall be shewed hereafter.


The third thing to be considered in the Art of 
Navigation,
 is the Course or Line by which the Ship must go, which dependeth upon the Winds; the designation of these, upon the cer∣tain knowledge of one principal, which consi∣dering the Scituations of the Earth, ought to be 
North
 or 
South,
 which now is found by the Needle touched with the Loadstone, being thereby en∣dued with such a 
Magnetical Virtue,
 that if left

 to its liberty 'twill seat it self in a situation 
North
 or 
South.
 The 
North
 and 
South-wind
 thus as∣sured by the motion of the Needle, the Mariner supposeth his Ship to be upon some 
Horizon
 or other, the 
Center
 whereof is the Ship; so that crossing this 
North
 and 
South-line
 at 
Right Angles,
 sheweth the 
East
 and 
West;
 so you have the 4 Cardinal Winds cross each of these, and you have the 8 Whole Winds, another division makes 16, which again divided, makes 32 in all: And these Lines which a Ship following the direction of the 
Magnetical Needle
 describes upon the Sur∣face of the Water, were by the 
Portugals
 called 
Rumbs,
 and is still continued. These 
Rumbs
 are re∣presented upon the 
Globe
 by those 
Helispherical
 or 
Spiral Lines
 that you see divided into 32 parts, with a Flower-de-luce always pointing to the 
North.


The finding of the 
Rumb
 and 
Distance
 of a Ship in any place from whence she hath depar∣ted, is the last of the four things propounded as necessary in this Art of 
Navigation;
 which how to perform, shall be also shewed in the following 
Problems:
 But first of the 
Latitude.

Equinoctial;
 which taken from 90 deg. leaves the 
Latitude North.
 But if the sum of the 
Declination
 and 
Altitude
 exceed 90 deg. take 90 therefrom, the remainer is the

 add the 
Altitude
 and 
Declination
 together, their sum is the height of the 
Equinoctial;
 which taken from 90 deg. leaves the 
Latitude South.
 — But if the sum be above 90 deg. take 90 deg. there-from, the remainer is the

If the 
Meridian Altitude
 be observed under the 
Pole,
 within the bounds of the 
Polar Circles,
 in such Case the 
Suns Declination
 must be taken from 90 deg. and what remains is his distance from the 
Pole;
 which being added to the 
Me∣ridian Altitude,
 the sum is the 
Latitude
 of the place.


¶ Note here, that whatsoever is said concerning finding of the 
Latitude
 by the 
Suns Declinati∣on
 and 
Meridian Altitude,
 the same is to be performed by the 
Meridian Altitude
 of any known 
Star:
 and the manner how to effect it, will best be seen by the 
Globe.






II.
 By the 
Meridian Latitude
 of a known 
Star.


Suppose that being at Sea I should observe 
Al∣gol
 to be upon the 
South side
 of the 
Meridian,
 and to have 
Altitude
 62 deg. and I would know in what 
Latitude
 I then was.




Arithmetically.


The 
Declination
 of 
Algol
 is 39 deg. 39 min. 
North,
 the Complement whereof is 50 deg. 21 min. his distance from the 
Pole;
 add this distance

 and his 
Altitude
 62 deg. together, the sum is 112 deg. 21 min. which taken from 180 deg. leaves 67 deg. 39 min. for the 
Latitude
 of the place 
North.






By the 
Globe.


Bring 
Algol
 to the 
Meridian,
 and from the Centre of the 
Star,
 downwards, count his 
Altitude
 62 deg. and mark that point upon the 
Meridian:
 then bring that point to the 
South-part
 of the 
Horizon,
 and you shall finde the 
North-pole
 to be elevated 67 deg. 39 min. which is the 
Latitude
 you are then in. In like manner, if you should observe

III.
 By observing of two 
Stars,
 one being upon the 
Meridian,
 and the other 
Rising
 or 
Setting.


Bring the 
Star
 which you see upon the 
Meri∣dian
 unto the 
Meridian,
 and there holding the 
Globe
 fast, move the 
Meridian
 in the 
Horizon,
 till you see the other 
Star
 on the 
East
 or 
West,


 Rising or Setting, as you observed it, and then shall the 
Globe
 stand at the 
Latitude
 you are in.


So if you should see 
Regulus
 upon the 
Meri∣dian,
 and 
Lyra
 rising towards the 
East,
 the 
Lati∣tude
 would be found 37 deg. 50 min.






IV.
 By the 
Altitude
 of two known 
Stars,
 being both of them upon the same 
Azi∣muth
 or point of the 
Compass.


Lay the 
Quadrant of Altitude,
 or rather your thin 
Brass Semicircle
 to both the 
Stars,
 at the proper degrees of 
Altitude,
 as you observed them to be in the Heavens; (for the difference of their 
Altitudes
 is equal to their distance.) Then turn the 
Globe
 about in the 
Horizon,
 till the 
Qua∣drant
 or thin 
Plate
 of Brass do touch the 
Hori∣zon
 in that 
Azimuth
 (or point of the 
Compass
) on which you observed the 
Stars
 to be, so shall the 
Globe
 rest at the 
Latitude
 you are in.


So 
Capella
 and 
Scheder, Capella
 being 20 deg. high, and 
Scheder
 66 deg. h gh, and both of them upon the 
North-East
-point of the 
Compass,
 you will finde your self to be by this observa∣tion in the 
Latitude
 of 40 deg. 0 min. 
North-Latitude.








V.
 By the 
Altitude, Azimuth,
 and 
De∣clination
 of the 
Sun,
 or of a known 
Star.


Suppose a fixed 
Star,
 as that in the Right Knee of 
Hercules,
 having 47 deg. 9 min. of 
De∣clination,
 should be observed at Sea to have 122 deg. of 
Azimuth
 from the 
North-part
 of the 
Me∣ridian,
 and to be 60 deg. high; and from hence the 
Latitude
 were required:


Elevate the 
Globe
 to the 
Stars Altitude
 60 deg. and from the 
Pole
 count the Complement there∣of 30 deg. to which screw the 
Quadrant of Al∣titude:
 also count 122 deg. upon the 
Horizon
 from the 
North-part
 of the 
Meridian,
 and to those degrees bring the 
Quadrant of Altitude,
 and there keep it; then turn the 
Globe
 about, till 47 deg. 9 min. the 
Stars Declination
 (coun∣ted upon the 
Equinoctial Colure
 from the 
Equi∣noctial
) do cut the 
Quadrant of Altitude,
 and those degrees will cut the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 in 71 deg. 13 min. and that is the 
Latitude
 in which you then are.






VI. 
By the
 Suns, 
or a
 Stars Declination 
and
 Amplitude.


Let the 
Sun
 or a 
Star
 have 10 deg. of 
North Declination,
 and let the 
Amplitude
 thereof at its Rising or Setting be observed to be 57 deg. from the 
North.


Elevate the 
Globe
 to 33 deg. (the Comple∣ment

 of the 
Amplitude
) and count the 
Ampli∣tude
 it self 57 deg. upon the 
Meridian
 from the 
Pole
 forward, and thereto screw the 
Quadrant of Altitude,
 and bring the other end thereof to the 
East
 or 
West-points
 of the 
Horizon;
 then count 80 deg. (the Complement of the 
Stars
 or 
Suns Declination
) from the 
Pole
 upon the 
Equinoctial Colure,
 and bring those degrees to the 
Quadrant of Altitude;
 so shall 80 deg. of the 
Colure
 cut 71 deg. 24 min. of the 
Quadrant,
 and that is the 
Latitude
 you are then in.






VII.
 By the 
Suns
 Ascensional difference, and 
Amplitude.


If the 
Ascensional difference
 be 27 deg. 7 min. and the 
Amplitude
 33 deg. 20 min. and the 
La∣titude
 were required;


Elevate the 
Globe
 to 27 deg. 7 min. the 
Ascen∣sional difference,
 and from the 
Pole
 count the Complement thereof 62 deg. 53 min. and there∣to screw the 
Quadrant of Altitude;
 then bring the 
Equinoctial Colure
 to the 
Meridian,
 and count upon the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 upwards, the Complement of the 
Amplitude
 57 deg. 40 min. which degrees bring to the 
Equinoctial,
 and then shall the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 cut upon the 
Horizon
 51 deg. 30 min. counted from the 
East
 or 
West,
 which is the 
Latitude
 of the place.


And if you count the degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 comprehended between the 
Meridian
 and the 
Quadrant of Altitude,
 you shall finde them to be 20 deg. 5 min. which is the 
Suns Northerly De∣clination
 at that time.








VIII.
 By the 
Suns
 or a 
Stars Declinati∣on,
 and the time that he is upon the 
East
 or 
West-points
 of the 
Compass.


Let the 
Sun
 or a 
Stars Declination
 be 15 deg. 
North,
 and let the time that the 
Sun
 is upon the 
East
 or 
West-points
 of the 
Compass,
 be 59 deg. 45 min. which in time is 3 hours 56 min. and hence let the 
Latitude
 be required.


Elevate the 
Globe
 to 15 deg. the 
Declination,
 and screw the 
Quadrant of Altitude
 to 75 deg. the 
Zenith-point;
 then count 59 deg. 45 min. or 3 hours 56 min. (the hour) upon the 
Hori∣zon
 from the 
South, Eastward
 or 
Westward;
 and thereto bring the 
Quadrant of Altitude:
 Then look what degrees or the 
Quadrant
 are cut by the 
Equinoctial,
 and you shall finde 28 deg. coun∣ted from the 
Zenith,
 and that is the 
Latitude
 sought.


And thus have you several ways both by the 
Sun
 and 
Stars
 to finde the 
Latitude
 at any time. I will now proceed to some other 
Problems
 for finding the 
Rumb
 and distance, which as was said is the last of the four things neces∣sary in the Art of 
Navigation.








PROB. II.
 Any two places given, to finde their 
Rumb.


 THose Lines which a Ship following the direction of the 
Magnetical Needle
 describeth on the surface of the Sea, are called

 
Rumbs,
 and are (as was said) described upon the 
Terrestrial Globe
 by certain 
Spiral Lines;
 for the better understanding whereof, I shall premise these few Propositions:


First, The 
Needle
 touched with the 
Load-stone
 pointeth out the common Intersection of the 
Ho∣rizon
 and 
Meridian;
 the one end respecting the 
North,
 the other the 
South,
 as aforesaid.


Secondly, A Circle drawn through the 
Vertex
 of any place that is distant from the 
Equator,
 can∣not cut divers 
Meridians
 at equal 
Angles.


Thirdly, A great Circle drawn through the 
Vertical-point
 of any place, and inclining to the 
Meridian,
 maketh greater 
Angles
 with all other 
Meridians,
 than with that from whence it was drawn.


Fourthly, If we sayl upon any point of the Compass except 
North
 or 
South,
 we often change our 
Horizon
 and 
Meridian.


Fifthly, The same 
Rumb
 cutteth all 
Meridians
 of all places at equal 
Angles,
 and respecteth the same Quarters of the World in every 
Horizon.


Sixthly, The potions of the same 
Rumb
 inter∣cepted between any two Parallels whose differ∣ence of 
Latitude
 is the same, are also equal to each other: therefore an equal Segment of the same 
Rumb
 equally changeth the difference of 
Latitude
 in all places; so that in an equal space pass
d in one and the same 
Rumb,
 one of the 
Poles
 is equally elevated, and the other depressed.


Seventhly, 
Rumbs
 though never so far continu∣ed, do not pass through the 
Poles,
 but winde a∣bout the 
Poles
 until they loose themselves.


Hence you may understand if your Ship be di∣rected

 under the 
North
 or 
South-Rumb,
 your course will be always under the same 
Meridian;
 if under the 
East
 or 
West-Rumb,
 you will either describe the 
Equator,
 or a Circle parallel to it: If your 
Vertical point
 be under the 
Equator,
 your Ship will describe an 
Arch
 or 
Segment
 of the 
E∣quator;
 but if your 
Zenith
 or 
Vertical point
 be distant from the 
Equator
 either 
North
 or 
South,
 your course will then describe a Parallel as far di∣stant from the 
Equator,
 as the 
Latitude
 of the place is whence you first set forwards: But if your Voyage be to be made under the 
Rumb
 which inclineth to the 
Meridian,
 your course will then be neither in a greater or lesser Circle, but your Ship will describe a kinde of a crooked 
spiral Line.


 Finde the two places upon the 
Globe,
 and when you have found them, see what one 
Rumb-line
 passeth through both of them, and that is the 
Rumb
 or point of bearing of those two pla∣ces one from the other. So 
C. del Gade
 on the Coast of 
Zanguebar
 and 
C. Cormorin
 are both of them found upon the 
W S W
 and 
E N E Rumb,
 and that is their Point of bearing, or 
Rumb
 re∣quired.


If you can finde no one 
Rumb
 that passeth through both your places, then you must look what 
Rumb-line
 upon the 
Globe
 runneth most parallel to both the given places, and conclude that to be the point or 
Rumb
 of those two places bearing one from another. — So if the two places were 
Seirra Liona
 in 
Africa,
 and the Island S. 
Hellena,
 if you look upon the 
Globe
 you shall finde no one 
Rumb-line
 to pass through both the

 places, but that 
Rumb
 to which the places lie most parallel, is the 
N N W
 and 
S S E Rumb;
 and so 
Sierra Liona
 beareth from S. 
Hellena N N W,
 and on the contrary S. 
Hellena
 is scituate from 
Sierra Liona S S E,
 which is the 
Rumb
 required.






PROB. III.
 Having the distance sailed, and the 
Rumb
 you have sailed upon given, to finde the difference of the two places both in 
Longitude
 and 
Latitude.


HAving found the 
Rumb
 upon which you made your course, make a small mark thereupon, for the place you departed from: then from the 
Equi∣noctial
 take the number of miles or leagues you have sailed upon that 
Rumb
 (allowing 20 leagues for a deg.) and set that distance upon the 
Rumb
 from the former point made; and at the termina∣tion of your number of miles or leagues, make a second mark upon the 
Rumb:
 then bringing the place, or point, you departed from to the 
Meridi∣an,
 you shall there finde the 
Latitude
 of that place or point, and the 
Meridian
 cutting the 
Equinoctial
 will shew you the 
Longitude
 of that place or point. — Do so by bringing the second point or place to the 
Meridian,
 and there shall you finde the 
Latitude,
 and upon the 
Equinoctial
 the 
Longitude
 of that place or point. Now if you substract the lesser 
Latitude
 from the greater, you have the dif∣ference of 
Latitude;
 and the lesser 
Longitude
 sub∣stracted from the greater, gives the difference of 
Longitude.








PROB. IV.
 The 
Latitude
 of two places, and the 
Rumb
 that the two places bear each from other given, to finde the difference of 
Longi∣tude
 of those two places, and also their distance upon the 
Rumb.


 FIrst, finde the 
Rumb
 upon the 
Globe,
 and turn the 
Globe
 about till that 
Rumb
 doth cut the 
Meridian
 in the 
Latitude
 of the first place from whence you departed, and there make a mark or point upon the 
Rumb,
 and at the same time see also what degrees of the 
E∣quinoctial
 are cut by the 
Meridian;
 for that is the 
Longitude
 of the first point.


Secondly, Turn the 
Globe
 about, till the same 
Rumb
 does cut the 
Meridian
 in the 
Latitude
 of the second place, and there make another mark upon the 
Rumb;
 and also see what degrees of the 
Equinoctial
 are cut by the 
Meridian,
 which degrees are the 
Longitude
 of the second point or place: and the lesser 
Longitude
 being substracted from the greater, gives the difference of 
Longitude
 of the two places or points.


Then for the distance upon the 
Rumb,
 the di∣stance between the two points before made, being measured upon the 
Equinoctial,
 and reduced to miles or leagues, shall give the distance upon the 
Rumb.




¶ Here note, that the distance upon the 
Rumb
 being intirely taken and applied to the 
Equi∣noctial,
 will give the distance in the Arch of a great Circle, and not really in the 
Rumb,
 for the distance upon the 
Rumb
 will be always greater than the great Circular distance: wherefore the better way will be, to take in a pair of Compasses one, two, three (or some small number of) degrees of the 
Equi∣noctial,
 and run that distance over upon the 
Rumb-line
 from point to point; and the num∣ber of all those returns of the Compasses (reduced to miles or leagues) shall be the neer distance of the two places upon the 
Rumb.






FINIS.
