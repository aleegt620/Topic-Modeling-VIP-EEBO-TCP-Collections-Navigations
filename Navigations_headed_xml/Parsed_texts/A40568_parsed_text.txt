THat the World may be assured, that the late King
 James 
it now landed in
 Ireland, 
I shall not only give a particular Account of his Arrival there, but also of his Journey from the Court of
 France, 
to the Port of
 Brest, 
and like
ise of his Voyage thence to
 Ireland, 
and of the Ships, Men, Money, and Arms, which the
 French 
King hath sent along with him for his Assistance.


The 25th of the last Month, 
New Stile,
 the late King 
James
 went from St. 
Germains
 to 
Peris,
 and there heard Mass in the Metro∣politan Church of that City, where he was received by the Arch-bishop at the head of the Chapter, and received the Sacrament at the hands of the 
Abbe Perfait,
 Canon of the said Church. He afterwards dined with the Count 
de Lauz
,
 on whom that Morn∣ing before he went to Mass, he conferr'd the Honour of the Order of the Ga
e
. Af∣
er Dinner he went to the Palace of 
Orleans,
 
o visit and take leave of Madamoiselle of 
Orleans,
 Madam the Great Dutches of 
Tus∣cany,
 and Madam of 
Guise.
 In the Eve
∣ing he went to the Court at 
Versailles,
 to take leave of the 
French
 King, and return'd that Night to his late Queen at St. 
Germains en Lay.


The 27th the 
French
 King went to St. 
G
¦mains,
 to take leave of the late King of 
Eng∣land.


The 28th. early in the Morning, all thing
 being ready for the late King's Journey to 
Brest,
 he took leave of his late Queen and the Child, all present being in Tears at his departure, the late King not excepted. 
e travelled in a Calash, accompanied by the Marshal Duke 
de Luxembourg,

French
 Horse, and preceded and accompanied by divers 
English, Scotch
 and

 O

Orleans,
 where he was lodged in the House of the Sieur 
de Creit,
 Intendant of the Province, who met him a League and a half with his Coaches; the Citizens were in Arms, and complimen

March,
 after ha∣ving heard Mass, he continued his Journey, and arrived that Night at

 by the Marquess 
Rasilly,

The 2d, after having heard Mass, he went and lodg'd that Night at

 and after∣wards continued his way towards 
Nantes
 and

 where he was magnifi∣cently received and treated by the Duke

Brest,
 accompanied by the Persons aforesaid, as also by the Marshal 
d' Estrees,
 who met and recei∣ved him at 
Lanveoc,
 three Leagues off of 
Brest,
 with a Frigat and a Galiot, and most of the Boa
 
longing to the Ships. He 
as saluted as 
e p
ssed 
long by 
ll 
h
 Gu
 of the Castle and Ships. The Coun
 
d
 Beth
ne,
 Chief of the Squadron, and the Sieur 
de C
∣seau,
 Intendant of the Sea, received him at his landing; where he was also received by the Bish
 of 
on,
 clo
ed Po
ically at the head of 
e C

hrough 
 double Fi

Berwick,
 the Marshal 
d' Estrees,
 and the General Sea-Officers, with those General Land-Officers which the 
French
 King sent to accompany him to 
Ireland.


The 6th he went to se
 the Ship
, and went on board the St. 
Michael,
 commanded by the Sieur 
Gabaret,
 Chief of the Squadron, as also on board another Man of War, commanded by the Sieur 
an
 
so Chief of a Sq
adron, and in the Evening he visited the Magazins of the Sea-Anchal. There 
 ready in that Port Fourteen 
French
 Men of War, Three Fireships, and Seven Frigats, to Convoy the late King, as also a sufficient number of Ten∣ders, and Vessels of Burden; to transport Land-Forces, Arms and Ammunition.


On the 7th, the Wind coming fair, the late King 
barque 
 board the Str 
Michael,
 where he no
 done entered the Cabin but the Wind turn'd Northerly, he lay on board all 
 and the Wind continuing contrary, he 
 the 8th 
 
our, land th
re remain'd till 
he 
; the Wind presenting fair al second 
, about Noon that day, he went on board 
 same Ship, and about 4 weighed Anchor, 
nd 
 for fall. About 12 at Night, being just got out of the Bay of 
Brest,
 the Wind 
opped about Southerly, and oblig'd them to come to 
 Anchor, wher
 they remain'd till 
 next 
, and t
 re
h'd into the Harbour.


On the 14th the Wind presented fair a third time, but being Easterly, and hearing some 
English
 and 
D
tch
 Men of War were approaching, they deferr'd putting to Sea. That Night they 
ceived advice, that there were neither 
English
 nor 
Dutch
 near them, and that the Coa
 was clear; nevertheless they deferr'd setting sail till 
Thursday,
 being the 17, 
New Stile,
 when the Wind being turn'd South-West, fair for 
Ireland,
 and against the ap∣proach of any Ships from the 
Do
,
 they put to Sea a third time, the Wind proved wave∣ring, and so retarded their passage, that it was the 
 of this Month before they made sight of 
Ireland.


Being that day come near the Bay of 
King∣sale,
 the Wind chopp'd contrary, and oppos'd their Approach or Entrance for above thirty hours, so that they were all that time forced to keep out at Sea, during which time they put forth 
English
 Colours; then the Wind turn'd favourable, and they advanc'd within the Bay, havin
 taken dow

English
