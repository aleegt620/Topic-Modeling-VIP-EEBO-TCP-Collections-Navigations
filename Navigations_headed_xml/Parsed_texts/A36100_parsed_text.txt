A DISCOURSE Of the Dukedom of Modena.


A
NTIquITY was so ignorant, as to divide the whole World into two parts onely, 
viz. ASIA
 and 
EƲ∣ROPE;
 comprehending 
Africa
 under 
ASIA,
 as 
Eratosthenes
 an Author of as great esteem as anti∣quity; some under 
EƲROPE,
 as 
Isocrates
 in his Panegyrique, and others mentioned in 
Salust, Lucan,
 and S. 
Austin de civitate Dei:
 but the most celebrated Division was into three parts; 
EƲROPE, ASIA,
 and 
AFRICA
 or 
Libya;
 and this

was approv'd both by ancient and modern Authors. So that it appears, Cosmography was unacquainted with any other Division of the Universe, till that the knowing 
Genouese,
 about two Centuries ago, did furnish it with a Fourth, by his discovery of 
AMERICA,
 the most usual, but improper name: for 
Columbus,
 after his ineffectual addresses to the States of 
Genoua, Anno
 1486, and to 
Henry the
 7
th
 of 
England,
 and their absolute refusal; he spun out six years in patient attendance at the Court of 
Ca∣stile,
 where at last he was furnished out with three Vessels more proper for Discovery than Conquest. And thus he first found it out, and led the way to the rest. But 
Americus Vesputius
 the 
Florentine,
 a man old in years, but young in courage, employed therein by 
Emanuel
 King of 
Portugal,
 surveyed a great part of the Continent by the light he had from 
Columbus
 the first Discoverer; yet the 
Floren∣tine
 prov'd the Godfather, and call'd it 
AMERICA,
 to perpetuate his own Name, and eternize his Me∣mory. 
John Cabot
 a 
Venetian,
 in behalf of 
Henry
 the 7
th
, discovered all the North-east coast thereof, and touched many places 
Americus
 ne'r saw. And although these three 
Italians
 were by three several Monarchs employed to finde out this Fourth part of the World, it is so vast a Continent, that the Southern part is to this day altogether unknown; and usually in our Planispheres and Maps call'd 
Terra Australis incognita.


EƲROPE
 as to its Magnitude, (in the opinion of Cosmographers, who run all in the same current

or stream) is inferiour to the other three; though to none of them, if you consider the moderate and wholesome Temperature of the Air, together with the prodigious fertility of its Soyl; the two once-famous 
Romane
 and 
Greek
 Monarchies; the Study and Improvement of Arts both Liberal and Mecha∣nical; the Affluence of all things that conduce ei∣ther to the Support or Pleasure of Man; or above all, the Purity and Sincerity of the Christian Reli∣gion universally profess'd in all the Dominions thereof; besides the well-regulated Government of their Realms, their Kings being Absolute Mo∣narchs, but not Arbitrary Tyrants; and the men happie Subjects, not miserable Slaves; which keeps us from that Tyranny, Slavery, Injustice, frequent Bribery, Beggery and Barbarism, which like an In∣undation hath overflown all the 
Asiatick, African,
 and 
American
 parts, when they groan'd under the Yoke of their Idolatrous and Sanguinary Princes and Governours. 
Par nihil Europe, nihil est se∣cundum.


ITALY is is a Region, that, among many other advantageous Elogies, is on all hands held to be the 
Eden
 of 
Europe,
 the Garden or Paradise of this North-west part of the World. This 
Peninsula
 or Demi-Island, formerly the absolute and redoubted Empress of the major part of the then-known habi∣table World, yet may compare, as now it is, nay exceed the most of the other Kingdoms of 
Asia, A∣frica,
 or 
America.
 'Tis situate in a most Tempe∣rate Clime; and for the amoenity of its Cities, the

commodiousness for Commerce and Negotiations, the deliciousness of its Fountains and Aqueducts, the fertility of its well-cultivated Fields, insomuch that in some places they have three Harvests in one year; the Uniformity and Stateliness of Fabriques, and the rare Architecture and rich Furniture and Ornaments of its Temples, and many other Delica∣cies to gratifie the 
gusto
 as to Fruits and rare Wines, with other Varieties too numerous to be crowded into the narrow confines of our intended Dis∣course.


And in this Paradise or Garden of 
Europe
 there is a small 
Terroir,
 or pleasant spot of ground, known by the name of 
MODENA;
 where we will take the 
fresco
 for some time, and give you our Senti∣ments upon a strict Survey of what shall occur as observable during this our 
Promenade;
 and there∣upon make some Remarques, which will prove the most useful Materials, and most conducive to the compliment of this our present Essay.


MODENA
 is the Modern appellation; but it is better known to the Ancients by the name of 
Mu∣tina;
 as 
Livie, Cicero, Pliny,
 &c. Some read it 
Motina;
 as 
Antoninus
 and 
Dio: Strabo
 and 
Ptole∣my
 
 commonly 
Modena, à movendo
 (saith 
Merula
 in his Cosmography) 
ut quidam insulse con∣jiciunt, eo quòd Diluvio quondam tota fuerit sub∣mersa, qua de re dignus Autore suo Versiculus.


Mutina submersa fuit olim gurgitis unda.




Call'd 
Modena
 (a foolish conceit) because it was once drowned with a Deluge. The more probable Conjecture is, that it was nam'd 
à movendo,
 be∣cause it is at this day somewhat removed from the situation of the ancient Citie, which the 
Longobards
 did totally ruinate and demolish.


The City of 
Mutina,
 now 
MODENA,
 was first erected by the 
Etrurians
 or 
Tusci,
 now cal'd 
Toscans
 a people of 
Italy;
 and they waging War with the 
Galli Boii,
 were expelled thence by them, who after that possessed it; and they being profligate by the Vi∣ctorious Arm of the 
Romane
 Conquerors, it was by them made a Colony, together with 
Parma,
 in the 570 or 571 year after the Building of 
Rome,
 as 
Livie
 and other Historians affirm, (
Quintus Fabius Labio
 and 
Marcus Claudius
 being at that time Consuls) who in several places make very honourable men∣tion of it; an infallible testimony that it was both rich and potent: which truth is more at large con∣firm'd by the various Inscriptions and ancient Mar∣bles that are yet everywhere extant, and expos'd to the view of all Travellers.


This Citie was sufficiently illustrated and made famous in those times, for the first Battel between 
Antonie
 and 
C. Octavianus Caesar,
 who was then but

a Stripling or 
Tyro
 in War, and not above Eighteen years, and yet made Head of a new League against 
Antonius,
 whom the Senate lookt upon with an ill eye, as a common and dangerous Enemy. This happened in the year 711, when 
Antonius
 besieg'd 
C. Brutus
 in this Citie; but by the assistance of 
Cae∣sar Octavianus
 he gain'd the Victory. The mana∣ging of the whole War was left to 
Hirtius
 and 
Pan∣sa,
 at that time Consuls. The fortune of the day was so well managed on both sides, that 
Antonie
 lost the Field, and the Consuls their Lives; 
Caesar Octavianus
 remaining absolute Commander of a puissant and numerous Army, into whose favour he by his dexterity so cunningly insinuated him∣self, and made so good improvement of his Talent, and such advantage of the opportunity, that this prov'd the Basis and Foundation of his future Grandeur. But afterwards, when the said 
C. Octa∣vianus, M. Antonius,
 and 
M. Aemilius Lepidus
 en∣tred into the Society of the 
Triumvirate,
 there∣upon the Citie had very course usage, and was ex∣pos'd to very great Slaughter, by 
Constantine
 the Great, because that it favoured 
Maxentius:
 but the Victory being once obtain'd, it was restor'd, and the Christians became possessed of it; it was dignified with an Episcopal Seat, and 
Geminianus
 a Learned man made Bishop thereof. After this, it was reduced to ashes by the Inundation of the 
Goths
 and 
Lombards,
 a furious and barbarous people, as S. 
Ambrose
 relates the Story, affirming that he saw 
Modena
 with the rest of the adjacent places upon

the 
Via Aemilia,
 suffer a total devastation. But these Barbarians were afterwards expulsed by the Empe∣rour 
Charles
 the Great, who established his son 
Pe∣pin
 King of 
Italy;
 and then the Citizens of 
Modena,
 whose names were engraven on the gates, quitting their sad but secure Retirements, whither they con∣fin'd themselves during the distractions and tur∣moils that 
Italy
 then labour'd under, took counsel how to rebuild this Citie: and in process of time they erected it in that form as now it appears in. They being now their own Masters, free from the Vassalage of an insulting Enemy, and solely at their own disposal, and having the Jurisdiction within themselves, they onely retain'd the 
Romane
 name; but yet were not so much at rest, but they had se∣veral Skirmishes with their Neighbours, especially the people of 
Bologna,
 about the Limits and Bounds of their Country.


During the Distractions and Troubles of 
Italy
 between the Emperour and the Popes, 
Guido
 the Popes Legate, and then Bishop thereof, consign'd it over to 
Azo
 one of the House of 
Este,
 Lord of 
Fer∣rara, Anno
 1304, the Pope consenting to it, upon the annual payment of the Tribute of 10000 Crowns. Since which time it hath been for the most part in the power of that House; 
Bersius
 Marquess of 
Ferrara
 being created Duke of 
Mutina
 by the Emperour 
Frederick
 the third. 
Anno
 1312, she had the Family of the 
Mirandulae
 her Masters, by the Authority of the Emperour, 
anno
 1319. the 
Bonacelsii
 Tyrants of 
Mantua
 being compelled

thereunto by the help and assistance of the 
Guelphi. Anno
 1331, the 
Pii
 governed her, at first under the name of Captains, afterwards of Princes. Further∣more, 
anno
 1336, the 
Atestini
 or Family 
d'Esteé
 succeeded them, who were Marquesses of 
Ferrara,
 by the Popes leave and permission; and they go∣verned it till the year 1510, when Pope 
Julius
 11 took the Citie, and gave it to 
Maximilian
 1, Em∣perour, by whom it was afterwards, 
anno
 1514, hy∣pothequ'd to Pope 
Leo
 the tenth, for 10000 Crowns. Lastly, in the year 1527, when 
Clement
 the Pope was besieg'd by the lmperialists, it was retaken by the Victorious Arms of the 
Atestini,
 or Family of 
Esté,
 by whom it was increased with Buildings, Walls, and fenced with Ditches; and grew up by degrees to the present splendour, state and gran∣deur.


Thus far the ancient Authors, particularly 
Livy;
 and the modern also, as 
Blondus Corius, Platina, Sabellicus, Volaterranus,
 and 
Leandro;
 besides what we finde in the Annals of the Citie, and 
Bologna
 likewise.


MODENA
 is marshalled by 
Pliny
 in the eighth Region of 
Italy,
 and call'd by 
Ptolemy
 a Citie of 
Gallia Togata;
 being washed by the Rivulet or Brook 
Formigo.
 It was heretofore situated some∣what higher towards the Mountains than now it is at present, as appears by the ruines of some antiqua∣ted edifices standing somewhat distant from the an∣cient 
Modena,
 as 
Leandro
 intimates more at large.




The Citie is noble and splendid, of an orbicular form, seated in a Plain not far from the 
Apennines,
 which are called the Back, or rather Back-bone of 
Italy,
 because, like the 
Spina
 in the body, they divide 
Italy
 into two parts or sides, West or North. It is beautified with a Cathedral Church, the doors whereof are worthy admiration for many things, but particularly for the famous Marble-statues of 
Adam
 and 
Eve.
 It flourisheth with the dignity of an Episcopacie, which is subject to the Archbishop of 
Bologna;
 and is also adorn'd with an Academy, in which 
Azo
 the Civilian taught the Imperial Law. It is a pleasant Soyl, abounding with Fruits and Grains of all sorts, and the best Wine, called 
Vinum Tribianum.
 This Citie was greatly ampli∣fied by 
Alphonso
 the second, Duke of 
Esté.
 'Tis populous, and the inhabitants are noble and inge∣nuous, and better natur'd than most of 
Italy;
 they being quick in their resolutions, easie to be pacified when injur'd, debonnair and courteous in their en∣tertainment and treating of strangers. Though they are ill and foolishly treated by some over∣censorious 
Italians,
 whe injuriously nickname it 
Modena lapazza,
 Foolish 
Modena;
 it being a ma∣licious and undeserv'd reflection upon that people. The females are of a meek and patient temper, nei∣ther too amorous, nor too coy; too courtly, nor too peevish; as they are in other places, for the generality: They are very much applauded also by Mr. 
Warcup,
 in his History of 
Venice,
 where he enumerates the several Cities of 
Italy
 in Verse,

translated out of the 
Italian;
 and concludes thus:


Foligno
's candi'd streets most pleasant are,


The Ladies in 
Fano
 so smoothe and fair,


That said they are from heaven sent to be:


But 
Modena
 more happie is than she.


Modena
 hath been the Nursery of many famous and learned men; some whereof are taken notice of by 
Nicolaus Leorinus Silesius,
 a learned and ele∣gant Poet, in his Catalogue of Learned men that flourished in his Age.


Ʋrbs Venetum Bembos loquitur Balbos{que} Poetas,


Naugerios{que} suos;


Mantua Virgilii, Capilupos numine plenos


Castilios{que} Duces;


At Molsas Mutina & Sadoletos jactat alumnos,


Cortesios{que} suas, &c.


Modena
 has produced these eminent persons:


Hercules Rangonus. James Sadolet
 a man of ex∣quisite Learning, 
Gregory Cortesius
 of the Order of 
Benedictines, Thomas Badias
 of the Fraternity of 
Praedicants,
 who were elected Cardinals by Pope 
Paul
 the third. She is also ennobled by 
Charles Si∣gonius
 a most learned man, and an eminent Histo∣rian. She is the Mistress of 
Ʋgo Rangonus
 Praesul of 
Reggio,
 of 
Francis Maria Molza, John Francis∣cus Furnius.
 It hath bred up some that were very

much renown'd in War; as 
Nicolas
 and 
Gerard Rangonus, Hannibal
 and 
Guido
 both sons of 
Nico∣las.
 There are many Noble Families in the Do∣minions of the Duke; as the 
Pii,
 the 
Mirandulani, Bonacelsii,
 &c. of which we shall speak more at large in the conclusion. But above all, the Family 
d'Esté
 who are now Lords of it; the Citie being very much ennobled and enriched by the constant residence of the Duke. Nor is she without her Ci∣tadel, wherein according to credible report there are stor'd up Arms for Forty thousand men at least: a very considerable business!


The next thing that falls under our consideration and description, is the Citie of 
Reggio
 in this Duke∣dome of 
Modena. Aemilia dein via pergenti, de∣xtra Seciae ripa omissa Regium Lepidi occurrit, ripae Crustuli laevae adpositum,
 saith 
Merula
 in his Cosmo∣graphy. As to its name, 'tis called by 
Tully
 in his Epistle to 
Cassius
 and others 
Regium Lepidi:
 by 
Tacitus, Regium Lepidum:
 by 
Strabo,
 l. 5. 
. by 
Ptolemy,
 
. by 
Antoninus, Regium
 onely, and at this day, 'tis commonly known by the name of 
Reggio.
 In this place here∣tofore there was 
Forum Lepidi,
 as 
Festus
 observes. The inhabitants are called 
Regienses,
 from 
Lepidus
 in 
Pliny;
 as also 
Regini, à Regio Julio.


Nor hath Heaven been more propitious to this Citie, or Fortune more favourable than to 
Modena:
 for it hath run almost the same ris{que} and tasted of the same misery and misfortune. It was at first made a

Romane
 Colony, as well as 
Modena; M. Aemilius Lepidus
 who gave it a name, 
T. Ebusius Carus,
 and 
L. Quinctius Crispinus,
 being then 
Triumviri.
 It was destroyed by the 
Goths,
 when they made incursions into, and embarassed all 
Italy,
 under 
Alarico
 their King: the Citizens were constrained, by reason of the fury of an enraged and barbarous enemy, to a∣bandon it, and flee to more secure retirements and places, till the 
Lombards
 were conquer'd and bea∣ten out of 
Italy
 by 
Charles
 the Great, about the year 800; at what time by degrees the Citizens returned to their desolate Citie, and began to restore, re∣pair, and immure it with a strong Wall. It was go∣verned by it self for some time in liberty, after the manner of the other Cities in 
Italy;
 and this free∣dom and liberty continued till the year 1286, and then it came under the Dominion of Earls and Princes; and 'twas first under the command of the Earls of 
Canosse,
 then those of 
Esté,
 the 
Caesars,
 the Kings of 
France;
 then it was subject to the Papal Sea, and had also the 
Foliani, Scaligers, Gonzagae,
 and 
Ottobuoni
 for its Lords. So 
Blondus, Antoninus, Platina,
 and 
Sabellicus.
 So far 
Morula. Heylin
 saith, When they were under the command of the Earls of 
Canosse,
 they grew weary of that Yoke, and recovered their Liberty; which being unable to maintain in those bustling times, they gave them∣selves to 
Obizo
 the father of 
Azo, anno
 1292. and after that, in the year 1326, to the Sea of 
Rome.
 Passing thorow many hands, it was at last sold for 60000 Ducats to the 
Visconti
 Lords of 
Milain, an.


1370; and in the end recovered by the House of 
Esté, anno
 1409, and gave the Title of a Duke to 
Borsius
 Marquess of 
Ferrara,
 whom 
Frederick
 the 3. made Duke of 
Modena
 and 
Reggio, anno
 1452. The Successours of 
Borsius
 held the Estate toge∣ther, till the death of 
Alphonso
 the first Duke, who dying without lawful issue, 
anno
 1592, left his E∣state to 
Caesar d'Esté
 his Nephew by a natural son, called 
Alphonso
 also; between whom and Pope 
Cle∣ment
 the 8, a War was threatned for the whole; but at last comprimised upon these Conditions: 
That the Church of
 Rome 
should have
 Ferrara, 
with all the Lands and Territories appertaining to it, as an Estate anciently held of that Sea: And that
 Modena 
and
 Reggio 
being Imperial Feifs, should remain to
 Cae∣sar, 
but to be held in Fee of the Papal Throne: Duke
 Caesar 
to have leave to carry away all his moveables, to sell such of his Lands as were not of the an∣cient Demain of the Dukedome; and to have one half of the Ordnance and Artillery.
 By which A∣greement, the Cities of 
Modena
 and 
Reggio
 became a new-erected State, distinct and independent of any other, each Citie being well Fortified, Gariso∣ned, and furnished with Ordnance for defence there∣of. But what they yield unto the Prince in the way of Revenue, and what Force he is able to raise out of his Estate, I cannot positively determine: but by the Tribute formerly paid unto the Popes for the Citie of 
Mutina,
 (now 
Modena
) and the rich Territories of both Towns, and the great Reve∣nues of the Dukes of 
Ferrara;
 I conceive they

cannot yeeld less than 100000 Crowns of yearly Income. Thus far 
Heylin
 in his 
Cosmography.


Reggio
 (saith 
Merula
) 
Ʋrbs est lauta, nobilis, fre∣quens; solo sita valde fertili; loco pulchro, amoeno, plane{que} regio, unde illi quorundam judicio nomen.
 This Citie is built on the 
Via Aemilia,
 and named 
Regium Lepidi
 by 
Strabo, Cicero, Cornelius Tacitus,
 and other Authors. By whom it was built, is not certainly known; though 'tis reported by some to be erected by the 
Toscans,
 who being expulsed, as 
Livy
 and 
Polybius
 affirm, the 
Gauls
 or 
French
 pos∣sessed it; and afterwards it was made a Colony by 
M. Aemilius Lepidus,
 one of the 
Triumviri; T. E∣butius Carus,
 and 
L. Quinctius Crispinus,
 being the other two, as is before mentioned. Some contend that 
Marius Lepidus
 one of the said 
Triumvirate,
 who divided the 
Romane
 Empire, was its Founder; others that it was built long before his time, but by him made a Colony.


'Tis a noble, splendid, and well-peopled Citie, a∣bounding with all things: it hath fair and spacious streets, with sumptuous structures; as the magnifi∣cent Church of S. 
Prospero
 Bishop of this Citie, where his corpse is devoutly kept; having a very plentiful Revenue, and being adorn'd with excel∣lent Portraictures, but particularly with some Pie∣ces drawn by the famous 
Correggio,
 worthy of e∣ternal Fame. In the walls of the Orchard of the 
R. R. P. P. de Servi,
 was not long since discovered an Image of the holy Virgin, held in great esteem there for its Miracles, with uncommon and super∣stitious

(I had almost said idolatrous) venera∣tion.


Reggio
 abounds with all necessaries for the use of man; the Soil is extraordinary fertil of all manner of Grain, and all sorts of Fruits. White Wines it hath good store, and a sort of Wine call'd 
Vinum Hel∣volum,
 of its colour, being between a red and white. 'Tis very much fam'd and taken notice of, for the rare art of making Spurs, the best in 
Italy;
 and other Mechanical pieces in Ivory, politely and exactly done according to art.


The 
Reggians
 are a people very courteous and affable, of a good mein and presence, of present wit, and quick apprehension, vivacious and spright∣ly, and to be moulded and brought to any great or august employment. The Women, as those of 
Modena,
 are very milde, and the finest in all 
Italy.


It is adorn d with a Bishoprick subject to the same Archbishop as 
Modena;
 and hath brought forth many famous men, who have rendred it very illu∣strious; as 
D. Maximus
 one of its Bishops, 
Guido Sagaranus, Philip Casolus, James Columbus, Charles Ruinus, Francis Belius, Julius Scarlatinus,
 famous Lawyers: 
Sebastianus Carradus,
 profoundly learned in the Greek and Latine Tongues; and 
Bartholo∣mew Crottus,
 a great Poet of his time. It contains many noble Families; as the 
Signori Canossae, Man∣fredi, Fogliani,
 and 
Sessi,
 who possess great Lord∣ships there, and have very noble and large Castles for their Apartments or Mannor-houses.




Now I have given you an account-of these two capital Cities of the great Dukedome of 
Modena:
 I will cast my eye with a retrospect upon some o∣ther famous Castles, Towns and Places within their Territories, and acquaint you with some passages and rarities that may merit the observation, and gratifie the curiosity of the diligent and industri∣ous Enquirer, that will make it his business to pry into them.


On the left side of the River 
Po,
 saith my Author, there stands the 
Arx Stellata,
 a Castle fabriqued by 
Nicolas
 3. of the House of 
Esté,
 who was Marquess of 
Ferrara:
 but the greatest part of it was in pro∣cess of time overthrown by the Legions of Pope 
Julius
 the 11, and the 
Venetians.
 And upon the Bank of the River 
Po
 is seen a new-built Town call'd 
Rovero,
 a neat and large place.


Towards the South of 
Modena,
 under the 
Apen∣nines,
 stand 
Formagine, Spezzano;
 and ten miles off, 
Sassulo,
 a Noble and civil place, with a sum∣ptuous Castle of the Family of the 
Pii,
 watred by the River 
Secchia,
 where is also a fair Church dedi∣cated to the blessed Virgin.


About half a mile short of 
Sassulo,
 is the Temple of the Saint 
Maria Sassutina,
 so called from the Castle 
Sassulo
 situated at the very foot of the 
Apen∣nine
 hills or mountains on the left side of the banks of 
Secchia.


Upon these Mountains stand many other Villages and Hamlets, and are plainly visible in the Eastern part of 
Modena.




These Castles were formerly subject to several Lords, and particularly to them of 
Monte,
 who were very powerful at that time in these Countries, and possessed all the Places in the 
Graffignana,
 which confines on 
Bologna;
 and among the rest, 
Sestola
 and 
Fanano.
 Westward, the 
Alps
 of 
San Pellegrine
 appear to the view; and the Castle 
Acquario,
 fa∣mous for its Baths, and their Medicinal waters; and from thence 'tis probably conjectur'd it takes its denomination. Then turning to the South, runs the 
Tyrrhene
 Sea, somewhat near 
Bologna.
 On the banks of the River 
Panaro
 stand 
Vetro
 and 
Spilim∣berto,
 formerly call'd 
Spinum Lamberti,
 two Castles belonging to the 
Signori Rangoni.
 Four miles di∣stant from thence you finde 
Vignola,
 a Town dig∣nified with a Marquisate, subject to the 
Signori Buoncompagni,
 which borders upon the 
Bolognian
 Territories.


Towards the North is situated the most Noble Castle, or rather Imperial Citie, call'd 
Carpi;
 which may deservedly come in competition with many Ci∣ties, if you consider the populousness or ingenuity of the People, and the superfluity of all necessaries. It is honoured with the title of a Principality, and was for many years enjoyed by the 
Signori Pii;
 but at this day it is under the Duke of Modena.


Then there is to be seen the ample, noble, and o∣pulent Monastery of S. 
Benedict Podolironus,
 built by 
Boniface
 the father of Countess 
Mathilde,
 and enlarged by the said Countess, whose Sepulchre is there likewise. And 
Guardistallo,
 famous for two

Councils held there, one under Pope 
Ʋrban
 the 8, and the other under 
Paschal
 the 11: witness 
Pla∣tina
 in the History of their Lives, and 
Blondus
 in his fourteenth Book of 
Historical Relations.


On the Banks of the River 
Po,
 somewhat farther, 
Brescello
 fronts you, call'd 
Brixillum
 by 
Pliny,
 in his third Book; and 
Plutarch,
 in the Life of 
Otho
 the Emperour: by 
Ptolemy,
 
 and by 
Taci∣tus, Suetonius, Antoninus,
 and 
Paulus Diaconus.
 It was formerly a Citie, saith 
Leander,
 and taken by 
Anthare
 King of the 
Lombards,
 who dismantled and levell'd the walls with the ground, according to 
Paulus Diaconus
 in his Continuation of 
Eutro∣pius,
 l. 28. and 
Blondus
 in the 8 Book of his Hi∣story.


On the left hand of the banks of the River 
Len∣za
 stands 
Tanedo,
 nam'd by 
Livy
 in many places, and 
Pliny
 (who affirms that there was a man there 120 years old) 
Tannetum;
 by 
Polybius, Tanetus;
 by 
Pto∣lemy,
 
 and hence it is that 
Pliny
 calls the people 
Tanetani.
 It was subverted by 
Cese
 King of the 
Lombards,
 saith 
Paulus Diaconus;
 was re∣stored, and reduced to the form that now it ap∣pears in, being at present a Village or Hamlet.


In the Eastern part of 
Modena
 is a Chanel, upon which you may pass by Boat 8 miles at length, till you arrive at 
Finale:
 then going on the River 
Panaro,
 where the Chanel disembarques it self into that River, is seen 
Buon Porto,
 and 
San Felice,
 much commended for generous Wines. Along the 
Aemi∣lian
 way, three miles from 
Modena,
 runs the River

Panaro,
 near which are the confines of the 
Modo∣nesi
 and 
Bolognesi,
 where 
Claudius
 the Consul co∣ping with his enemies, took 15000 Prisoners, and 700 
Ligurians.
 Nay farther, in this very place 
Ro∣tari
 King of the 
Lombards
 routed the 
Romane
 Ar∣my, with the slaughter of 7000 Souldiers. Here also the Forces of the 
Modonesi
 being discomfited by the 
Bolognesi, Euzo
 King of 
Sardegna,
 the son of 
Erderick
 the second, was taken Prisoner. On the other side of 
Panaro
 is 
Novantola,
 with a Monaste∣ry famous both for its antiquity as well as stateliness, founded by 
Anselmo,
 nearly related to 
Astolfo
 King of the 
Lombards,
 who was a redoubted Captain in their Army.


Near the 
Aemilian
 way, between 
Bologna
 and 
Novantola,
 stands 
Santa Agata,
 a Castle erected by 
Barbarossa
 the Emperour; and 
Crevalcuore,
 former∣ly known by the name of 
Allegracuore,
 where the Army of 
Bernabo Visconte
 Lord of 
Milain
 was de∣feated and put to the Rout.


Next you go to 
San Giovanni,
 a Country very plentiful of Wheat and other Grain. On the left side of 
Via Aemilia
 stand 
Castiglione
 and 
Castel∣franco,
 15 miles off of 
Bologna;
 where some few years past there was raised a most impregnable Fort by Pope 
Ʋrban
 the 8, and from him called 
Ʋrbano.
 Neer this Fort is the 
Foro di Galli,
 where 
Hirsius
 and 
Pansa,
 two 
Romane
 Consuls, were engaged with 
M. Antonius;
 who obtained a glorious Victory, but withal their mortal wounds, whereof they both di∣ed upon the place, as is prementioned. Then there

appear 
Purmanio, Bazanio,
 and 
Crepellano,
 three pleasant Castles seated on those hillocks that are at the foot of the 
Apennines.


On the left hand of the 
Aemilian
 way, five miles from 
Bologna,
 are the Rivers 
Lavinio
 and 
Ghiron∣don,
 which meeting together with mutual embra∣ces, joyntly environ 
Forcelli
 in a triangular form, being distant from 
Via Aemilia
 one mile; where 
Octavianus, M. Antonius,
 and 
Marius Lepidus,
 sha∣red the Monarchy between them. This 
Forcelli
 is now a 
Peninsula,
 though it may be perceived to have been an Islet formerly. Afterwards these two Rivers disgorge themselves into the 
Po.


Near 
Bologna
 there is seen a Stone-bridge of great length, which bestrides the River from one side to the other; from whence 'tis but a small and easie mile to 
Bologna.


Now we come to the places contiguous and ad∣jacent to 
Reggio;
 near which there appear certain Hills that erect their lofty crest so pleasantly, as does create delight in all Passengers; no less beautified and adorned with several fair Towns and Villages, than delicious Wines and Fruit-trees. Towards 
Parma
 you may take a view of a Castle (strength∣ned by its site) where 
Mathilde
 the Countess pre∣serv'd Pope 
Gregory
 the seventh from the snares and ambushes prepared for him by the Emperour 
Henry
 the fourth, an enemy to the Church of 
Rome;
 but afterwards he (being a tender-conscienc'd 
Re∣ligioso
) repented of this imaginary and suppo∣sititious

Crime, and was led a Royal dance by his Confessor bare-foot and bare-headed in the midst of Winter, through Ice and Snow, from this place to the said Pope, to implore a Pardon for this his 
Pec∣cadillo,
 and obtained it with a courteous reception. A remarkable Instance, and notorious Precedent of the Tyranny, Haughtiness, and Vain-glory of his Ironical, nick-nam'd Holiness, who dares presume so proudly and imperiously to insult over, nay buf∣foon a puissant Potentate, making him foot it bare in the depth of a hard Winter; to the Idolatrous Citie of his residence; and thereby run the ris{que} of losing his life, to gain a fruitless and insignificant Pardon. But this he must do, or forfeit all his 
Rega∣lia,
 and be daily menaced with that silly Scar-crow, the Thunder of Excommunication. Thus Monar∣chy grows consumptive, hangs the head, droops, and dwindles away to nothing, and so expires; 
King
 is a meer empty name, or the more glorious 
synonyma
 of Vassals, and 
Prince
 the more splendid name of Slave. Thus the Scepter warps to the Crosier, the Emperours Hat vails to the Bishops Mitre, and the 
single
 does obeysance to the 
triple
 Crown. Thus Regal Authority, whose tender neck was ever un∣accustomed to the burden of a tame condescention, puts on the heavie Yoke of Pontifical rigorous im∣position. Thus here you see the great most Chri∣stian Ring crouch to Antichrist, or being Crown-fallen as well as Crest-fallen. Thus Majestie it self inclines the reverend head, stoops low with a reve∣rential bow to kiss that vulgarly-ador'd Pantofle,

which frequently proves but the gaudy covering of a Gowty toe.


At this day, the most Noble Family of the 
Canossae
 are Lords of this Castle, and the rest that encircle it; and a small distance from this, stand the Castles and other places that belong to the 
Signori Man∣fredi.


Keeping the way on the Mountains, you come to 
Graffignana,
 where 
Castelnuovo
 is to be seen, which in times of yore was the Birth-place of many Illustrious persons; and in this our modern age, of 
Giulio Ʋr∣bano;
 Doctor and Apostolick Prothonotary, who liv'd in great repute and esteem among Princes Po∣pishly inclin'd, and was highly applauded by the Fry of the Septuagint of Cardinals, that pay homage to, and revere the pretended and triple-Crown'd Suc∣cessor of the Fisherman; who did a long time offici∣ate as Vicar-general, in lieu of the Miter'd Cardinal 
Linga Carnaro
 Bishop of 
Padua;
 and in that qua∣lity died, 
anno
 1592. (May the same mortality and good fortune, in God's due time, attend the whole Conclave, that's my Litany.) His brother 
Ʋrban
 was Captain of the 
Venetian Militia,
 and 
Filippo Ʋrbano
 their Nephew.


In your return to the 
Aemilian
 way, occurs the Castle of 
Scandiano,
 dignified with the Title of a Marquisate, subject to the 
Signori Feni,
 noble and renown'd 
Vicentines.
 On the left hand lies the Ca∣stle 
Roldo,
 belonging to the House of the 
Sessi,
 a Feudatory of the Emperour; with 
San Martino, Gonzaga
 the most splendid Village belonging to the

Gonzagae
 Princes of 
Mantua,
 and 
Muvilara.


Between 
Modena
 and 
Reggio, Correggio
 appears, not far from the River 
Lenza;
 a noble Castle, well govern'd, and as well peopled: it was called a citie of the Empire, and appertains to the most Illustrious Family of the 
Correggii:
 and where the River 
Lecchia
 dichotomizeth the 
Via Aemilia,
 stands a very strong Castle call'd 
Ruberia,
 or 
Rubiera,
 by the Learned 
Herberia,
 erected as some conjecture by the 
Boiardi,
 and as others imagine by the 
Ru∣brii
 of 
Parma;
 which had serveral Masters till the year 1523, and then it fell into the hands of the Dukes of 
Ferrara,
 and was made famous by the birth of 
Antonius Codrus,
 a most polite 
Grecian,
 and expert Latinist, being a man of great Learning and vast Parts. This Castle is strongly fortified with a well-made Bulwark or Rampart, and surrounded with many Hills, which adde much grace and beau∣ty to its situation, and renders the prospect very delightful. From hence you pass into a spacious and good Road, very commodious for all Travel∣lers that steer their course that way, and designe to arrive at the capital Citie 
Modena,
 of which we have already given you a large and exact descri∣ption.


In this Tract there are four 
Apennine
 hills, and as many Cities which are indebted to the Countess 
Mathilde
 for their foundation, 
viz. Bibianello, Ca∣stelvitreo, Monte Zano,
 and 
Monte Luzco;
 all un∣der the command and jurisdiction of the Earls of 
Canossae.




Having given you a court and true account of the Government, Riches, Force, Religion, Manners and Qualifications of the People of this ancient and illustrious Dukedom, as also the nature and quality of the Soyl and Climate; I shall by way of Corol∣lary close all with a short relation of the Original, Antiquity, and Genealogie of the Dukes of the House of 
Esté,
 and bring them down by descent to the most Illustrious person who at present is the undoubted and lawful Prince of the Dukedom of 
Modena.


The Princes of the House of 
Esté
 have been so considerable, and so much taken notice of both in Peace and War, that 
John Baptista Pigna
 hath with much industry and learning composed eight Books of the original, noble exploits and transactions of this Princely Family in 
Italy
 and other countries.


As to their original he saith, that 
Ateste,
 Com∣mander of the 
Heneti
 (now 
Venetians
) after the sacking and destruction of 
Troy,
 was driven into these parts with a considerable Navie, and built the Citie 
Atestia
 or 
Ateste,
 of his own name; and he called the whole Tract of ground 
Venetia:
 but the 
Latine
 degenerating by degrees from its puri∣ty, the Citie lost the primitive e name of 
Atestia,
 and sensibly shrunk into that of 
Esté.
 This 
Atestes
 descended from the 
Atii,
 of the 
Poblilian
 Tribe in 
Rome,
 who because they did espouse the Quarrel of the 
Caesars,
 did obtain so much grace and favour as to be Lords not onely of their own Country,

but also of all the Territories of 
Venice.
 And here the 
Atestini
 (for so they were call'd of old) began to b e in reputation: and these Princes do produce their Chronologie of 1200 years, to mani∣fest and testifie their Grandeur in a continued Series down to this present Age.


Thus the 
Atii
 became Masters of a great part of 
Venice
 when 
Ateste
 was their capital Citie of Resi∣dence: and the 
Romane
 Caesars being then accusto∣med to create a Magistracie consisting of eleven of the chief Citizens, and sometimes a greater number, (who were also called 
Decuriones,
 because at the first institution ten onely were requir'd) 
Atius
 the son of 
C.
 of the last Race, and the first Author of the Family of the 
Atestini,
 did exercise this Magi∣stracie there. And this the Inscription of an old Stone doth sufficiently prove, which to this day is preserv'd by these Princes. This 
C. Atius
 had two sons; 
Aurelius,
 and 
Flavius.


Ateste
 being thus built, and the Metropolis of 
Venetia,
 was called afterwards 
Esté,
 and had four Gates oppos'd to the four quarters of the heaven; the 
Black,
 the 
White,
 the 
Triumphal,
 and the 
Capi∣toline
 Gate, in the 
Romilian
 Tribe, saith the Author. It was founded by the 
Atii,
 ruin'd by 
Acarinus,
 and restor'd by 
Aldoardus;
 and then 'twas made an Earldome, afterwards created a Marquisate, and enlarged; besieged by the 
Paduans,
 taken by 
Eze∣linus,
 recovered by 
Azo,
 burnt by 
Ezelinus,
 possess'd by those of 
Padoa,
 and then restor'd to 
Azo,
 and afterwards to 
Albertus.




Thus you have in short a brief Narrative of the ancient 
Atii,
 the original of the 
Atestini,
 or 
Esten∣ses,
 as our Modern Authors write them; which is the most known name; and they are usually call'd the Dukes of 
Esté.


The Family 
d'Esté,
 at present Dukes of 
Modena,
 which are accounted in the number of the 7 Great Princes of 
Italy,
 according to the ancient Division, which are, the Pope, King of 
Spain,
 Duke of 
Savoy, Toscany, Modena, Parma
 and 
Montoa;
 they derive their Pedegree from 
Allo
 Marquess of 
Esté
 who took upon him the Surname (which the Family is known by to this day) of the Citie 
Esté;
 and still appertains to them 
de jure.
 He married 
Alda
 daughter to the Emperour 
Otho
 the first; which happened 
an.
 1000. and he had with her for Dower 
Modena
 and 
Reggio. Theobaldo d'Esté, Otho
's Grandchilde, was seized of 
Ferrara
 in the year 1055, from Pope 
John
 the 12: but they were disseiz'd and absolutely dispossest of it by 
Clement
 the 8, 
anno
 1598, after the decease of 
Alfonso
 the second, for want of lawful Issue male: yet 
Caesar d'Esté
 was then in being, who was son of 
Alfonso
 by 
Laura Ferraress;
 and he of∣fered to clear it by manifest proof, that his father was lawfully married to his mother, and he the le∣gitimate Heir. But the Pope was too hard for him, being surely possest of that which he so greedily thirsted after. And that Family still lays claim to it by a legal pretension. B ut the holy Father (and he you know is infallible) will prove him to be a natural son.




Yet maugre all this opposition, the Duke is still in possession of the Dukedoms of 
Modena
 and 
Reg∣gio,
 the Principalities of 
Carpi
 and 
Correggio,
 the Earldom of 
Roli,
 and the Lordships of 
Sassevil, Gar∣fagna,
 and 
Frignano,
 by the late Treaty of 
Pisa.
 Here was indeed a dispute between him and the Pa∣pal Crown about the Valleys of 
Comachio;
 but this was not so hot, b ut it cool'd at length, and was de∣cided upon these Conditions: The Prince being to receive 400000 Crowns for them; which were ac∣cordingly paid, and 40000 more for damages, and some other advantageous terms. These Lands which we have before specified, together with those which he possesseth in the Dukedome of 
Ferrara,
 yield him annually full 500000 Crowns. All his Domi∣nions are contiguous, and joining close one to the other; which renders him more considerable; and his strength and force consists in the number of his people. 
Carfagnana
 alone (being a Province be∣longing to him) is reported to have fourscore and odde places well wall'd about, besides several other Strong-holds. He is able upon urgent occasions to lead into the Field 20000 of the Infantry, and 1000 of the Cavalry well arm'd and accoutred. And farther, he can without any inconveniencie whatso∣ever maintain and keep half of that number. His His Country, tis true, and cannot be denied, lies o∣pen to several bordering Princes; not for want of good places and well-fortified Castles, for he hath many seated at a very convenient distance; but the reason is, because his 
Terroir
 or Land lies level, and upon even ground.




The Princes of 
Modena
 follow the general Ma∣ximes of their Neighbours, 
viz.
 to keep a good cor∣respondence with 
Venice,
 which was always repu∣ted the Protectress of 
Italian
 Libertie: but since the loss of 
Ferrara,
 they kept close to the 
Spaniard,
 till their Interest of late wrought a change upon their inclinations. For Duke 
Francis
 was in the late 
Italian
 Wars made General of the French; and 
Mazarine
's Neece married to Prince 
Almerigo
 his son, who hath left a young son to succeed him. All things at present are managed by the advice of Car∣dinal 
d'Esté,
 Protector of the French Interest at 
Rome,
 and the sole Promoter of the late Union of his House to the French Crown. He is Uncle to the now Duke of 
Modena;
 a very active and stir∣ring person, and hath made the world speak honou∣rably of him, for his actions both in Peace and War. He is extraordinarily well skill'd in the art of con∣cealing his resentments, and understands the old Motto: 
Qui nescit dissimulare,
 &c. At 
Rome
 he keeps his Palace with more pomp and splendour than any of the Cardinalate: and though 'tis very much frequented by the Nobility, and a numerous train of people, yet they are all constantly and well paid. He is a Zealot in the French Cause; by whose friendship his Family is enriched and well moneyed, by reason of the late Generalship, as also the Coun∣try: for the Souldiers took up their Winter-quar∣ters in 
Modena;
 which occasioned a great resort of the chief Officers, as well as inferiour persons; and this did help the poor Populace to pay the Gabels,

with which they are heavily burthen'd. At present there is one of the Name and Relation, 
Carlo d'Esté;
 a Knight of the Order of the Fleece, who attended on the Empress.


The Duke of 
Modena
 hath this advantage be∣yond most 
Italian
 Princes, that some of his Subjects have 
Feifs
 of the Empire. There are many great Families; as, the rich Earls 
di San Paolo,
 the 
Benti∣vogli, Rangoni, Buoncompagni;
 the Marquesses 
Spi∣limberto, Peppoli, Gualengo, di Vignola,
 and 
Gualteri;
 the Earls 
Caprari, San Martino, di Molsa, di Mal∣visia, Montecuculi, Tassoni, Ferrareze, di Conoscia,
 and some others. But all Princes and Republicks in 
Italy,
 the 
Venetian
 solely excepted, do homage, or pay Tribute to the Pope or Emperour; and the Duke of 
Modena
 among the rest does Homage to the Emperour for his whole State. 
Ranuccio
 the Duke of 
Parma
 was married to the sister of the late Duke, she being his second Wife, his former dying without Issue.


The present Duke of 
Modena, Francis
 the second, is very young; so that we have nothing to mention of his Person: and if he were of years, we must say of him, as of other Princes of 
Italy,
 They are extremely reserv'd, live very retiredly, cautiously receiving Forreigners; so that strangers rarely have admission into their Courts, or free access to their Persons for any continuance. They live a kinde of recluse and private life, affording no matter of obser∣vation to the inquisitive that visit forraign Coun∣tries.




JOSEPHA-MARIA 
d'Esté
 (at present the Il∣lustrious Dutchess of 
York
) is Sister to the above∣mentioned 
Francis
 Duke of 
Modena,
 and daughter of 
Laura Martinozza
 the now Dutchess Dowager, by whom she was accompanied to 
Dover,
 where her Nuptials were solemnly celebrated, being Married by the Reverend Dr. 
Crew,
 Bishop of 
Oxford,
 to the most Illustrious Prince, his Royal Highness JAMES Duke of 
York,
 whom God preserve.


To conclude all: The Arms of the House of 
Esté,
 (the present Duke of 
Modena
 being of that Noble and Illustrious Family) is a Coat for its strangeness much taken notice of, and is thus Bla∣zon'd.


The Arms are 
Palewise,
 of three Pieces. First, 
Partie per Fess
 in the 
Chief, Or:
 an 
Eagle displayed, Sables; membred, langued, and crowned, Gules;
 and in 
base Azure, three Flowers de Lis
 within a 
Bordure indented, Or,
 and 
Gules.
 Secondly, 
Gules two Keys in Saltier,
 the one 
Or,
 the other 
Argent,
 charged in 
Fess
 with an 
Escutcheon of pretence, Azure,
 suppor∣ting an 
Eagle
 of the third 
membred,
 and 
crowned
 of the second: over all, in 
Chief,
 a Papal Crown 
Or,
 garnished with sundry Gems 
Azure
 and 
Purple.
 Thirdly: The third as the first, 
counterplaced.


Now this Coat, upon the failer of the House of 
Ferrara,
 belongs to the Family 
d'Esté,
 since Dukes of 
Modena
 and 
Reggio.


FINIS.
