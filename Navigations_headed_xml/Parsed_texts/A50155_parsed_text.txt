Esther IV. 14.


If thou altogether hold thy peace at this time, Thou and thy Fathers House shall be destroyed.




TIS well known, that the late 
Me∣thods
 of this weekly and ancient LECTURE, have been, to insist first on the Affairs of a sincere CONVERSION, and then on the Duties of a pious CONVERSATION. Having dis∣patched the 
former,
 we are now entertaining

 you with our our Discourses and Directions on the latter. And you must Indulge me this Digression, that the fresh News of our 
Distress
 and 
Danger
 which within this four and twenty Hours arrived unto us, have diverted my Thoughts to 
That
 which you may behold this Text pointing at.


I could not 
altogether hold my peace at this time,
 without obse ving, that we have as ma∣ny 
Duties
 as we have 
Objects
 to be concerned with. But as one of the 
Objects
 which we often have before us, is, 
The People of God placed in very terrible Distress, and Danger;
 thus among the 
Duties
 then expected from us, none of the least Remarkable and Considerable is, 
The venturing of our All, in the service of that holy People.
 Such was the 
Object,
 and such the 
Duty
 which our Text refers unto. The peo∣ple of God, had their 
All
 now just 
going
 to be 
gone,
 and a great person is here called upon to venture 
All,
 for the service of this People that were thus Expiring.


The words now read, are a message sent by a Renowned 
Mordecai,
 to the Empress of the World. The whole Book of 
Esther
 is a commentary upon one Verse in the seven∣teenth of 
Exodus;
 and that part of it which we are now upon, claims a particular share of the Exposition. But we must Praeface our Discourse upon it, with a 
few,
 and but a few,

 Remarks upon the blessed 
Mordecai,
 that we may 
feel
 whereabouts we are. Know then that 
Mordecai
 was a Famous, an Aged, and an Holy Jew. He had been carried into Cap∣tivity, with 
Jeconiah,
 above seventy years be∣fore. And he 
Returned
 to, and 
Resided
 at 
Je∣rusalem,
 till the work of the 
Temple
 received its unhappy interruption: but then he 
Retired
 that he might serve his People in the Court of 
Ahashuerus
 (who was also called 
Artax∣erxes
) there: A very laudable Example! 'twas the effect and effort of a most noble generosi∣ty, in a worthy Man, when his opportunities to 
Do good
 were shut up at home, thus to ex∣pose himself unto all the Temptations of a 
Princes Court,
 that he might there be service, able to the People of God.


But our 
Mordecai
 gives a great affront un∣to one 
Haman,
 a Minion in the Court of 
Per∣sia.
 That 
Haman
 by his Brigues, had obtain∣ed from the Persian Emperour, a Commission and Priviledg to require a more than common Reverence from the Courtiers then about the Palace. But this good man found it against his Conscience to take such a notice of such a Miscreant. The scruple arose in him, either from 
This;
 That 
Haman
 was an 
Amalekite
 he was among the Children of that 
Agog,
 wh
 
Samuel
 slew; and so of a Generation both 
accursed
 by God, and no less justly that

 greatly 
Abhorred
 by 
Israel;
 or which I rather Think, from 
This,
 That it was a 
Divine
 and 
Sacred
 Respect, which 
Haman
 did now require. Such was the respect which the haughty and impious Kings of 
Persia,
 would sometimes arrogate unto themselves; and they would sometimes impart the same unto their Para∣sites and Favourites. Had it been a meer civil respect which was here demanded, it would have been very 
superfluous
 and well nigh 
ridiculous
 to have given express com∣mand unto all 
the Kings Servants that were in the Court
 concerning it; good manners were doubtless enough used there. Now that a godly 
Jew
 should refuse to render such an Honour to a sorry 
Potsheard of the Earth,
 is not at to be wondred at, when we call to mind, That even the prudent, but pagan 
Grecians
 did refuse it, in their Address to the 
Persian
 Monarchs; and the 
Athenians
 put one 
Timocrates
 to death, for adoring of 
Darius
 in such a manner. Such a check was given to the pride of 
Haman!
 Now the bloody Re∣venge of this Hellish Monster prompted him to pursue no meaner a satisfaction for this in∣dignity, than the utter 
Desolation
 and 
Extirpa∣tion,
 of the whole Nation which 
Mordecai
 was of: one Lark will not fill the belly of such a 
Vulture.
 Besides he saw the whole Nation was of such 
Principles
 and 
Perswasions
 in Re∣ligion,

 as gave a reproof to his wicked practi∣ces; an intolerable Nation was it that would know no God, but the Lord 
Jehovah,
 and with whom 
Creature-Worship
 was now grown into Detestation: and therefore he procures an order for the total Destruction of all the Jews, to be executed, according to the advice which he sought of the 
Divel
 for it, about this time of the year; and I suppose 
Anno mundi
 3485.


Perhaps, the 
Jews
 were before this, grown a little too secure and careless: it might fill them with many promises of none but 
Good Times
 for them, when they saw one of their own Religion sitting on the Throne. More∣over, The 
Jews
 had every where offended the God of Heaven, by neglecting of His Ordi∣nances for the sake of their own Secular Ac∣commodations. But we now all of the sud∣den see them that were the 
only people of God in the world,
 involved in most Awakening and Horrible Calamities; and they have a pros∣pect of Nothing but a Speedy, a present 
Ru∣ine
 before their Eyes. 'Twas by something bigger than a 
Wonder,
 that the People of God were now preserved!


A Strange Providence had exalted a Kins∣woman of 
Mordecai's,
 whose Name was 
Esther,
 to be the Queen of the Persian Empire; and she must be the Instrument of the preservation.

 In order hereunto, we find in our Context, a very solemn Message of her Uncle to her; in which we may Contemplate,


First, a 
Duty.
 The Duty pressed is, To 
venture All for the Rescue of them that were the Afflicted People of God.
 The Thing Enjoined upon 
Esther
 was, 
Go in unto the King, and make Supplication for thy people.
 This was the only step that could be taken for saving the People of God: but it was one very desperate and perillous. There was a cursed and a crabbed 
Law
 among them, which made it capital for any uncalled person to come into the 
presence
 of the King, unless it should please His pow∣erful and Soveraign Majesty to Extend His 
Golden Scepter,
 as a Token of a Pardon for that presumption. Wherefore now to push into the presence of the King, was to rush more evidently upon the point of a 
Sharp Sword,
 than of a 
Golden Scepter;
 it was to hazard the Loss of 
All;
 not only a 
Crown,
 but a 
Life
 too must be ventured in it. And the late Carriages of the Emperour unto 
Est∣her,
 could not but increase her Suspicions and Jealousies that his Affections began to be A∣lienated from her; whi
h made the Under∣taking yet more Dubious, Dangerous, and Formidable. However, still this was the Charge of the good 
Mordecai, If All must be ventured, then venture All; when the People of

 God are perishing, All that we have, is too little to be ventured for their Help.


Secondly, A 
Reason
 The Reason is, like a good 
Sawce
 made up of 
Sowre
 and 
Sweet.
 It is made up of 
Discords,
 and there is a no∣table 
Musick
 in it.


First, We have 
Necessity
 for this venture mentioned. Says 
Mordecai
 to his Neece, 
Think not that thou shalt escape.
 He speaks to her, as to a Passenger Embark'd in the same Vessel. Says he, 
Don't think that you shall not share with, and fare like, the rest of the people of God, that are now ready to be swallowed up
 It was more probable, that the 
Queen
 would suffer for being a 
Jew,
 than that the 
Jew
 should escape for being a 
Queen.
 Being a 
Queen,
 has been found not enough to put a person beyond the Reach of Malice and En∣vy; as the 
Queen
 of 
Dioclesian,
 and the 
Queen
 of 
Navarre,
 besides nearer instances, have as∣sured us. A Lively venture for the People of God, was once, it seems, the only way to de∣fend a 
Royal
 person from every fatal mischief.


But Secondly, We have 
Encouragement
 for this Venture tendered Says 
Mordecai
 with a Magnanimous Faith. 
If thou altogether hold thy peace at this time, there shall Enlargement and Deliverance arise from another place.
 Here was that 
Faith,
 by which, as the Apostle notes, the Believers of old, 
Escaped the Edge of the Sword.




From another place.
 There are Jewish Rab∣bins who look upon 
Place,
 here to be the Name of God. It has been admired, that the Name of GOD, is no where to be seen in the Book of 
Esther;
 and the Jews have a profane and foolish Custome thereupon. But indeed, as the Greeks would write 
.


, upon their Books, much more may we see 
God
 in every verse, 
God
 in every line of this Memorable Book. If the Name of 
Makom,
 or, 
Place
 be here put upon our God, it is not without a cause: For, 
All things are in God;
 He is Immense and Boundless in His Being; we cannot so well say, 
That God is in the World,
 as, 
That the World is in Him;
 and whether it be proper or no, to say, That God is even in the 
Imaginary Space
 beyond the 
utmost Selvidge
 of the World, this I am sure of, That the 
Utmost Selvedge
 of the World does not limit and confine this infi∣nite God, and the 
Heaven of Heavens cannot Contain Him.
 'Tis therefore suggested here, That when the People of God can have no 
place
 of Safety, but are in every 
place
 obnox∣ious to dreadful Persecutions, yet then, in their 
GOD
 they will have a 
place
 to repair unto. 'Tis possible, That this Glorious PLACE may keep the worst of all their E∣nemies from coming at them?


But what is the Duty 
then
 incumbent upon

 
our selves.
 You have heard it in the 
Text
 and you shall again hear it, in our 
Doctrine,
 thereupon; which is briefly 
This.


That every Christian should Readily and Chearfully 
Venture
 his All to to serve the people of God, when a 
Time of Distress and Danger
 cal∣leth for it.


It had been both 
presumptuous
 and 
Injurious
 to have Exhorted 
Estther
 unto doing so, if it had not been a Duty altogether indispensable. The Blessed God, for most wise and great 
Ends,
 permits 
Times of Distress and Danger
 to come upon His people. That 
His Attributes
 may be Magnified, and that both His and Their 
Adversaries
 may be prepared for the Vengeance, which belongs unto them, There∣fore 'tis that the most High brings His Peo∣ple sometimes into most amazing Exigencies; 'tis for these causes, that they not rarely fall into such 
Times of Distress and Danger,
 that like them in the Days of 
Esther,
 they Ly 
mourning and weeping and wailing in Sackcloth and Ashes,
 before the Lord; and they see themselves no where but upon the prodigious

 praecipices of Rumes hardly to be avoided.


In 
such
 a condition of Affairs (which is too much 
our own
 Condition) something must be done; 
Attempts
 must be made for the Relief and Rescue, of the 
People
 so likely to be cut off. Tho' it becomes us to, 
Stand still, and see the Salvation of God,
 I do not know that we are to 
sit still,
 without the use of Means under our Discouragements. But these 
Attempts
 can't be made without 
Ventures
 in them. 'Tis as possible they may miscarry, as that they may be successful. However, we must yet 
venture
 hard, and 
Venture
 far, yea, and Venture 
All,
 to serve the People of God, in their 
Distress
 and 
Danger. If at THIS TIME thou altogether
 forbear, and refrain, the doing of what may be serviceable to the Di∣stressed People of God, behold with an Holy Terror, the Doom upon that Omission, 
Thou and thy House shall be destroyed.


We have two 
Questions
 before us, to be a little Reflected on.


First, 
What,
 And


Secondly, 
Why,
 we must 
Venture
 for the Distressed People of God.


The first of our Questions, is,


What Ventures are we to make for the People of God, when Distress or Danger calls?


I must make 
short work
 of it, and in 
One Word
 comprise what is to be said. I say then,




We are to Venture every Thing in the world, but a precious and immortal Soul.
 So did 
Esther
 our Pattern. There is no Jewel, but that one of a never dying 
Soul,
 too valuable to be ventured, when God and His People is to be served. The first Lesson, the A. B. C. of Christianity, is that in 
Mat.
 16.24. 
Let a man Deny himself.
 We are so to 
Deny
 out selves, as to 
Venture
 our selves, and 
All
 that we 
Are,
 and All that we 
Have,
 to serve the 
People of the Saints of the Most High.
 But because you Look to see some particulars in the 
Bill of Charges
 which the Distress & Danger of Gods People, may put upon you, Let me say;


First, We must venture our 
Quiet,
 for the People of God. It was the Speech of a Gallant Man, in 2 Sam. 11.11. 
The Ark and Israel and Judah abide in Tents, and my Lord Joab, and the Servants of my Lord are Encamped in the open fields; shall
 I 
then go into my house, to Eat and to Drink—I will not do this thing,
 Well said, thou brave 
Hero!
 May we in like manner scorn to Consult the Delights and Pleasures of our own Repose, when the Ser∣vice of God and His People shall call us forth. Many 
Pains,
 many 
Toyls,
 and all the uncom∣fortable Fatigues of 
Business,
 must be Encoun∣tred, without Reluctancies, when the People of God are to be served; and we should for∣sake

 our soft Beds, our full 
Tables,
 and our Fine 
Houses,
 for the sake thereof. We should engage in the Service of our Genera∣tion, tho' there should be two 
Hankerchiefs
 which we are thereby necessitated unto the continual wearing of; One to wipe off the 
Sweat
 of Labour and another to wipe off the 
Dirt
 of Reproach. We may not, for the Love of 
Ease,
 decline the doing of what is to be done for the Interest of God, and of His People.


Again, We must venture our 
Estate
 for the People of God. It is Recorded for the ever∣lasting Reputation of those well-disposed men, in 2 Cor. 8.2 
Their deep Poverty, a∣bounded unto the Riches of Liberali?y,
 or 
Sim∣plicity,
 as it may be rendred. Many persons can do nothing in a way of Service for the People of God, because they say, 
They are poor.
 Nay, but our extreamest 
Poverty
 should not hinder our 
Liberality,
 When God and His People are to be served with what we have: Whatever 
Simplicity
 the Wity and Crafty and Gripple Hold-fasts of the World, may imagine in it. We should not grumble at a∣ny 
Expences
 which the Service of God and His People is to be maintained with; and tho' we have no more than 
Two Mites
 to give, we should part with more than 
One
 of them, rather than his Interest should meet

 with any prejudice.


Furthermore, we must venture our 
Ho∣nour
 for the People of God. It was an Act for which 
Moses
 is for ever 
Honourable,
 in Heb 11.24, 25. 
He Refused to be called, The Son of
 Pharaohs Daughter, 
choosing rather to suffer Affliction, with the People of God:
 Tho' we may arise to never so much Grandeur, Dig∣nity, and Preferment, by overlooking the Service of God and His People, we should think 
Little
 of the 
Grandeur,
 and rather trample upon such Dignity and Preferment. Tho' our Titles may be, 
Reverend,
 or 
Wor∣shipful,
 or 
Honourable,
 and perhaps 
Rightly
 so too; nevertheless we should think it no 
Hu∣miliation
 to us, that the People of God must be served by us. We are swoln with the 
vainest Air,
 if we count our selves too Bigg to do what is bespoke for the Interest of those that we should be 
Benefactors
 unto, if we would not unworthily pretend to be 
Superi∣ours
 over them.


Moreover, we must venture our 
Friends
 for the people of God. The Lord General of 
Israel
 had a dear and a kind 
Brother,
 to whom nevertheless he said, as in 2 
Sam.
 10, 11, 12. 
Be of good Courage, let us play the men for our People: and the Lord do that which seemeth Him good.
 Tho it be a 
Brother,
 yea, and somewhat nearer than a 
Brother
 that we must

 part withal, for the Service of God and His People, yet we must be willing to take our leave of such Rela ions. It was a very com∣mendable Bravery in that Father, who having had 
six
 lovely and loving 
Sons
 kill'd in the Service of the Public, brought out a 
seventh,
 even the Staff of his old 
Age,
 unto the Press-Masters, and said 
Here I have one Son more; take him too; this cause is worth them all.
 Sup∣pose we have a 
Benjamin
 with us, which we dote so much upon, that our Gray hairs do with 
sad hearts
 tremble at his departure from us: yet 
Benjamin
 too mu t go, if the service of our 
Joseph,
 our Jesus have occasion for him. There are many persons, who have brought very bitter, woful, doleful Miseries upon their 
Children,
 by detaining them from the Service of Gods People, when some hazard has ap∣peared in it. Let us count the very best of our 
Friends,
 never better bestowed, than in such a 
Service
 as may be reputed a 
Friendship
 to the Interest of God.


All that I have hitherto asked for, is but a 
Small Venture;
 there is 
One
 more that we are to make.


Finally then, We are to venture our very LIVES for the People of God, when they can't be brought out of 
Distress
 and 
Danger
 without the venture of our 
Lives.
 'Tis what we are summoned unto in 1 
John
 3.

 16. 
We ought to lay down our Lives for the Brethren.
 If an Heathen 
Pylades
 and 
Orestes
 could not think their 
Lives
 too large a price for each others 
Peace,
 what 
Life
 should be too much to be Sacrificed for the 
Peace
 of a People which God counts 
His own?
 The Apostle 
Paul
 tells us, 
For a good man one would even dare to Dy
 and hee saw it when an 
A∣quila
 and 
Priscilla
 were so ready to Dy for 
him.
 If a 
good Person
 be so valuable, What can then bee too much for a 
Good People
 of the Lord? When 
Adron,
 when 
David,
 beheld a Destroying Evil breaking in upon the People of God, they carried their 
Lives
 to keep it off. We are to do what we can for such a People, tho it be with 
The Jeopardy of our Lives.
 If we have a call to 
Ride into the very Bowels of the Earth,
 for the Service of the Public, we should as 
He
 of old, with all Spur and Speed be there. The Service of God and His People should make us to say, as the Martyr once, 
If every Hair of my Head were a Man, they should all be Sacrificed in this Glorious cause.


These are 
Ventures
 that we should none of us be Backward unto. But our Second Que∣stion then Enquires.


Why are such Ventures to be made for the People of God, when a Pressing Time cal∣leth for them.




Briefly, We ow our 
All
 unto the 
People
 of God. A 
Minister
 of God said once unto another, Philem. 19. 
Thou owest unto me, even thine own self.
 How much more may the 
People
 of God say this unto us all, 
Thou owest us thy self and thy All;
 The People of God may call for our 
All
 And


First, The 
Order
 of God Empowers the 
People
 of God, to call for it. We are 
His
 by 
Creation. He has made us and not we our selves.
 We are 
His
 by 
Redemption.
 He has 
Bought us and not for our selves.
 Our God says unto us, as in 1 
Cor.
 6.19. 
Ye are not your own.
 That which He has done for us, ob∣liges us to say unto 
Him
 devoutly what the Prince of old foolishly said unto another, I 
am thine, and all that
 I 
have.
 Shall I not add, That we are 
His
 by 
Profession
 too? I pray, which of you dare to say, I 
have some∣thing that God is not the Owner of?
 We 
Pro∣fess
 that all we can Style 
our own,
 shall be, 
For Him and not for another;
 otherwise we ly in our dayly Protestations. We have our 
All
 from God. It is, 
In Him that we Live and Move and have our Being.
 And shall not our 
All
 be 
For
 Him too? Well, The God of Hea∣ven has made His People, the Receivers of His 
Rents,
 His 
Dues.
 They have a 
Letter of Atturney
 for it; and you shall see me produce it, before I stirr. It is in 
Matth.
 25.40. 
Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as you have done it unto

 the least of these my Brethren,
 (Blessed Lord, Condescendest thou to Style thy poor People so? and shall we count any thing too dear to be Ventured for them!) 
Ye have done it unto me.


Secondly, The 
Design
 of God likewise Em∣powers them to call for it. All Things are Ordained and Intended by our Good God, for the use of His People; He says in 1 
Cor.
 3.21. 
All is yours.
 And shall we defraud them as to any part of that 
All?
 What is it that God allowes us our 
Life
 and all the Refreshments and Enjoyments of it for? Tis not that 
we
 may have a Tast of a few Sensual Delights; God has not that Regard unto our 
Sensuality.
 No, Tis that the People of God may be the bet∣ter for it; therefore tis that we are made 
Stew∣ards
 of our little 
All.
 Why, the whole World stands on this very Ground, 
That the People of God may be Provided for;
 if there were none of 
them
 to be Served the Eternal God, would with swift Lightenings and Hot Thunder∣bolts, immediately set fire to the Universe. How comes the Greatest 
King
 to set upon a Chair of State? It is affirmed of 
Cyrus,
 a Pu∣issant Emperour, in 
Isa.
 45.4 
For Jacob my Servants sake, and for Israel mine Elect,
 I 
have called thee.
 Much more ought we 
Little Folks
 to imagine, that when we have arrived unto any thing of the World, the Almighty God

 says unto us, 
Tis for the Sake and the Service of my Israel, that
 I 
have Blessed thee.
 Shall I utter a word beyond any that has yet passed from me? We are then to be Sensible of what we read about our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, in 
Eph.
 1.22. 
God hath put all things under His Feet:
 What for? It followes, 
And gave Him to be Head over all things to the Church
 What a thing is here? It seems that our Lord Jesus is made 
Heir of all things,
 and has the Government of the whole World put into His Hands, (in part) that so the People of God may thereby be Served & Saved forever more, And what shall you and I, Little Creatures, then think of all the 
Advantages
 which God has put into 
our
 Hands! Whom, I pray, 
Whom
 are they to be Serviceable to?


Thirdly, The 
Glory
 of God, gives them a Concernment in our 
All.
 'Tis the Name worn by the People of God in Isa. 46.13. 
Is∣rael, my Glory.
 The Lord our God has more 
glory
 from His People, than from all the Vi∣sible World besides. Indeed all the Sincere and Active Returns of 
glory
 which from the face of the Earth go up unto Him, are a∣mong such as these. The Great God is greatly 
Glorify'd
 by the prosperity of His People, 
They
 Know Him, 
They
 Love Him, 
They
 Praise Him, while 
Prosperity
 gives them 
Opportunity
 so to do; and as 'tis said in Psal,

 102.16. 
When the Lord shall build up Zion, He shall appear in His Glory.
 The 
Glory
 of God is promoted, when the 
Zion
 of God is Defended, Enlarged, Served. And what should we Dedicate and Consecrate our 
All
 unto, but the 
Glory
 of Him that is 
God over All?
 'Tis said, 
Eat and Drink unto the Glory of God;
 every Bit of 
Meat,
 every Drop of 
Drink,
 that we have; and whatever is reck∣oned in our 
All,
 may be devoted unto the 
Glory
 of God. If 
so,
 it must go to the 
Service
 of His People too.


Lastly, The 
Wrong
 we have done to the People of God, Enables them to Demand our 
All.
 What is it that brings 
Distress
 or 
Danger
 upon the People of God? It is, 
Our Sin.
 We, by our 
Sins
 have had an Hand in all the Inconveniencies, which put the People of God upon calling for our Help? How shall we then repair this Wrong, but by pro∣fering our 
All,
 to bring them out of their Distressed Plight? Hence came that carriage of 
David,
 in 2 Sam 24.17. 
He said,
 
 
have sinned; but these Sheep, what have they done? Let thy Hand, I pray thee, be against m.
 Even so should an holy Ingenuity prompt us to think with our selves; 
'Tis we th
 
 sin∣ned, and for our Sins, there are Storms 
 
es now threatning the People of God; O let them all be spared, and let my All go towards the Redeem∣ing

 of them.
 This was that which poured Oyl into the Flame of that 
Zeal
 which 
Paul
 was once inspired with; He could say, I 
was once Injurious!
 and this made him with a scarce imitable Diligence and Faithfulness, now lay out His 
All,
 to serve the People of God, who had heretofore been worse for his Misdemeanours.


But the Improvement of these things re∣mains. And it shall be in these Deductions.




Deduction I.


Hence, a 
private Spirit,
 especially at a Time of much 
Distress
 and 
Danger
 with the People of God, is an evil much to be Rebuked. For us to see the People of God gasping, bleed∣ing, dying under Difficulties, and yet, 
At this Time altogether to hold our peace!
 O 'tis a most unaccountable 
Baseness;
 and the mouth of our God hath stigmatized it with the charact∣ers of most horrible 
Woes;
 as in Amos 6.6. 
Wo to them, that are not grieved for the Affil
∣ction of Joseph!
 I lay down these two Asserti∣ons.


First, At 
All
 Times we should 
Employ
 our 
All
 for the People of God It should be our Ambition to be as the Blessed 
Bradford
 was, 
Always doing of Good with Tongues, or Pen, or Purse, or some other way.
 Most amiable was the Meditation, which 
David
 was treating himself withal, in 2 Sam. 7:2. 
He sits down

 in his House,
 and thinks. 
What shall I do for the House of my God?
 That Enquiry, 
What Service may
 I 
do for the Church of God?
 should often be Rolled in our Minds; and it will be so, if we do not too much countenance a 
Spiritual Barrenness
 in our Lives. The Church of God, is well worth our 
Serving;
 next un∣to the 
Man
 Christ Jesus, it is the Noblest Creature that ever was formed by the power∣ful and Curious Hand of the 
Great God that formed all things.
 There is not an 
Angel
 in Heaven, but what would g adly wait upon the smallest and poorest Member in the 
Church-Mystical;
 even so, the 
Little Ones have their Angels.
 Yea, our Mighty 
Saviour
 Himself, counted the very 
Blood of God,
 and 
Life of God
 a fit Ransome for the Salvation of of the Church; and shall not we then reck∣on the Church and People of God a fit sub∣ject for the best of our sorry Services? But I pass on to say,


Secondly, In Times of much 
Distress
 and 
Danger
 with the People of God, we are then especially to 
Venture
 our All on their behalf. We are 
at this Time
 to speak yea, and Act for them, Let the 
Venture
 Look never so big and black upon us.


Indeed, This is not the Spirit of every man; Too, too many are of a 
private,
 Selfish, Nar∣row Spirit, and are scandalously 
Little
 in their

 Inclinations. 'Tis pitty but some 
Odious Com∣parison
 should be excogitated for them. Will they 
Venture All?
 No, they study for nothing but to 
Save One:
 And if God have Raised up some Extraordinary Person, to 
Venture
 His 
All,
 for the Deliverance of His Afflicted Countrey, perhaps all the Thanks that they give him is, 
Who bid him do it?
 Will they 
Venture
 All? No, They 
Refuse
 All, or at least they 
Begrutch
 All, that should go from them, for the publick Weal. They Complain of 
All,
 and Murmur at 
All,
 tho' it be a wretch∣ed 
Little,
 which they are Compell'd unto, for the 
common Safety.
 Will they 
Venture
 All? No, They use all their Wits and all their Thoughts to Contrive, how to 
Do no∣thing at all;
 and tho' they can spend many 
Pounds
 in a year upon a pernicious 
Lust,
 yet a Summe not capable of so High a Deno∣mination exacted by a Reasonable 
Tax,
 is with them an 
Oppression
 which (because they are far from 
Wise) does make them Mad.
 What would they be at? They would not care tho' the 
Houses
 of their Neighbours were Burnt, if their own 
Apples
 might be Roasted at the Flame. What would they have? They subordinate their 
All,
 to this mighty Thing, that they may sleep like the 
Toad,
 (I have now found a comparison for them!) with Claws full of the Dust which

 is in the Belly of the Earth. There is this Detestable 
Neutrality
 in multitudes of men; that 
Let
 the People of God sink, or swim, 'tis all one to them, 
Modo hic sit bene,
 (as he said) if their own Earthly Pleasures be not thereby Abated.


Alas, For this 
Private Spirit!
 It is 
this
 that has a more Dismal Aspect upon our 
own
 Land, than all the other things that Bode ill unto us. We read in 2 
Tim.
 3.1, 2. 
In tho last Days Perillous Times shall come; for men shall be lovers of their own selves.
 I krow a Countrey in the World, that can afford many 
Effectual Expositors
 upon that memorable Text. God grant that the 
last Dayes
 of 
New-England
 may not now be Running; tis 
too
 Evident, that we have most 
Perillous Times,
 and, I wish it were not 
as
 Evident, that men are too gene∣rally 
Lovers of their own selves.


To Sharpen the Rebukes that are due to such an 
Evel Spirit.




Consider. 1.


By a 
Private Spirit
 no man proves a 
Real Gainer
 in the end. Men think to 
Save
 by such a 
Self Consultation;
 but they 
Loose
 Egre∣giously and very Miserably: as tis said in 
Math
 16.24. 
Whosoever will save his Life shall loose it.
 The men of a 
Private Spirit
 are loosers, even in 
this
 World. The allwise God has uncountable wayes to Deprive and Be∣reave

 men of those very things, which a 
Pri∣vate Spirit
 was resolved upon the Retaining of. The men of 
Succoth
 and 
Penuel,
 would do no∣thing for Supporting the Army that was go∣ing against the 
Midianites.
 No, said they 
Let such and such Towns bear all the Charges, if they will:
 But you forget not the Destruction that soon overtook them for it. The Citizens of 
Constantinople
 were so Coveteous, that they would not maintain a Watch on the Walls of their City when it was besieged; the 
be∣seigers
 by that Def ct soon became the 
Pos∣sessors
 of their wealth and found Vast-Coffers of it, hoarded up. This 
Private Spirit
 renders men Obnoxious to the te rible 
Displeasure
 of an Holy and an Angry God; and what Se∣curity can they have against the Desolating strokes of 
That?
 When 'twas Judged that some of the Provinces in 
Israel
 were break∣ing off from the Rest, and setting up for them∣selves, and intending no more to bear the Name of 
The united Colonies;
 What said the man of God unto them, in 
Numb.
 32 23. 
Be∣hold, yee have Sinned against the Lord; and be sure your Sin will find you out.
 It was a Note in a great Song, 
Judg.
 5.23. 
Curse yee
 Me¦roz, 
said the Angel of the Lord, Curse ye bitter∣ly the Inhabitants thereof.
 Why, what had they done, that the 
Bitter
 waters of Jealousy and Consumption must in this large Quantity

 be got ready for them? How many 
Men
 had they kill'd? and how many 
Towns
 had they burn'd? Alas, There is nothing of all th
, their Fault was this, 
Because they came not un∣to the Help of the Lord, against the Mighty.
 If all the 
Angels
 in the Heaven, can make a 
pri∣vate
 Spirit prove a 
cursed
 One, and inflict a 
Blast
 upon those whom 'tis prevailing in, it shall be done!


Yea, and they shall in the 
other
 World be Losers too. Who are those that shall perish for ever? Why, They are the Men that can't 
Venture.
 We find, in 
Rev.
 21.8. 
The Fear∣ful,
 to be the 
First
 in the Roll of them that shall go into the 
Lake which burns with Fire and Brimstone;
 they that were for bringing up the 
Rear
 in all 
Services
 here, must Lead the 
Van
 in the 
Sufferings
 of the Pit below. Our 
Everlasting Recompences
 will be very much ad∣justed, by the Regards which we had for the Flocks of the Lord Jesus here. 'Tis an awful Scripture, in Isa. 60.12. 
The Nation and Kingdom, that will not serve thee
 (the peo∣ple of God) 
shall perish.
 If a 
Nation,
 a 
Kingdom,
 How much more must the 
Unser∣viceable Person
 Look to be 
served
 so?






Consider

A 
private Spirit,
 is very far from a 
Christi∣an Spirit.
 It was the great Rule of the Pri∣mitive Christianity, in 1 Cor. 10.24. 
Let no

 man seek his own, but every man Anothers Wealth.
 It was the Spirit of 
Christ,
 in 2 Cor. 
 9 
Tho' he was Rich, yet for your sakes, He became Poor.
 But of what Spirit then are 
they,
 that cannot part with any 
Riches
 for the Benefit of their Neighbourhood? It was the Spirit of 
Paul,
 in Rom. 9.3. 
I could wish that my self were Accursed from Christ, for my Brethren.
 What Spirit are they then of, that cannot bear to see themselves a jot the 
poorer
 or the 
Meaner
 for their 
Brethren?
 In the Primitive 
Jerusal
m,
 they had, 
All things in Common.
 And a Readiness to 
Communicate
 is but agreeable to all the Children of that First Christian Church, which was, 
The Mo∣ther of us all.
 Are we Members of that 
Bo∣dy,
 which the People of God make up, or no? If we 
are,
 we shall be, 
Concerned for the whole.
 A Good Man will say, as he in Ps. 1
2.8. 
For my Brethren and Companions sakes, I will now say, peace be within thee.
 When he Looks upon the People of God, he thinks, 
These are my Brethren, they and
 I 
have the same Father;
 He also thinks, 
These are my Compani∣ons,
 I 
hope to dwell with them throughout Eter∣nal Ages.
 Hereupon, he can do any thing for them, and feels his Heart within him knit unto them, as 
Davids
 was to 
Jonathan.
 This is indeed the Mark, the Sign, which a true Child of God may be known withal;

 as in 1 John 3.14. 
We know that we have passed from Death unto Life, because we Lo
 the Brethren.
 We are yet in a state of 
De
,
 if we count any thing too much for the Ser∣vice of God and of His People.








Deduction. II.


How
 Sinful, 
How
 Woful, 
How
 Wicked then are They, that will not forego, what is worse then 
Nothing,
 to Serve the people of God! If we are to Venture 
All,
 what are they who will not Forego 
Sin,
 which is worse than 
No∣thing
 that the people of God may not thereby be Ruined? If we are to Venture a 
Life,
 Surely, we are much more to give up a 
Lust,
 when the Service of Gods people call us there∣unto. We are then, to do, as in Math. 5.29. 
Pluck out a Right eye,
 and 
Cut off a Right Hand
 which has been Anathematiz'd by the word of God. Let this word reach all the Lewd and Wild Sinners, which it belongs unto. To 
you
 be 
this
 now declared; The 
best Ser∣vice
 that you can do for the People of God, is, 
To Forsake your Wicked wayes, and your Unjust Thoughts, and Return unto the Lord.
 Most Ob∣durate, Wretched, Bloody Sinners are you, if you had rather see this 
Whole People
 destroy∣ed, than that a Mortification should befal one of your 
Delicate
 and 
Beloved
 Sins. I am to tell you, That this is the Language of your

 Impenitency, and 
Blush you not?
 When the Roman Emperour uppraided his General 
Ter∣rentius,
 for the Loosing of a Battel, he reply'd 
Sir, I must tell you, that it is you that lost the Day for us, by your open Fighting against the God of Heaven as you do.
 This may duely be cast in the Teeth of all the 
Bad Livers
 in this Place. You that Live without the fear of God, You that Live after a Prayerless and Careless and Profane rate, not haveing the 
Fear of God before your Eyes:
 You are those that every Day do the things, 
For which the Wrath of God comes.
 This people of God is now in such 
Distress
 and 
Danger
 as it never saw before; and I ask not your leave to tell you, 
That you are the Authors of it all.
 Tis 
You,
 that bring whole Armyes of 
Indians
 and 
Gallic
 Blood Hounds in upon us; tis 
you
 that clog all our 
Councels
 with such Delay and Slowness, as terrifies us in our most Ratio∣nal Expectations. You are perhaps the most Querimonious, and Outragious of all People, in your 
Discontents,
 Why, but 
your
 unsub∣dued Sins are those which breed all our 
Dis∣contents.
 These, 
They
 are the 
Accursed Things,
 which make you the 
Achans
 of the whole Congregation. You often ask, 
What Newes?
 and long to hear of, 
All Peace.
 But 
I
 say, 
What Peace as long as your Notorious and allow∣ed Abominations are Continued?
 Let 
Them
 go,

 and All will be 
Peace
 in a Little while.


I use the m
re freedome in this Repre∣hension, as being able to back it, with a great Authority. The Honourable 
General Chart
 of this Colony, have newly Published a very Serious and Solemn 
Proclamation,
 warn∣ing all 
Offendors
 against the Lawes of Sobrie∣ty, to mend their manners, and all 
Officers
 to Prosecute such offendors, as the principal Troublers of their Countrey; and, Adver∣tising us, that if a 
Reformation
 be not Endea∣voured, the Righteous God will 
Punish us yet seven Times for our Iniqu ties.
 O Happy, thrice and four times Happy 
New-England
 that is under the Protection of such a Government. Well, Now take this 
Warning,
 ye Sinners in 
Zion;
 be 
Warned
 into a true Repentance. To Slight such a 
Warning
 from the meanest person in the World, were a Dangerous Un∣reproveableness; but when such a 
Warnsng
 is given by a 
Father,
 it has a particular Stamp of God upon it, and 
Wo
 to those that shall be Disobedient thereunto. It is related concer∣ning the Sons of 
Eli, They hearkened not to the Voice of their Father, because the Lord would slay them.


Behold the 
Fathers
 of this Country, have been Warning all 
Bad-livers,
 That if 
They
 don't Repent, 
We
 must perish: if you now show your selves Refractory in your 
provo∣king

 Evils,
 what will the Issue be, but this, 
They hearkened not unto the voice of their Fathers because God would make a terrible Slaughter of Them, and of all their unhappy Neighbours?
 The Word of our God unto us all, is, that in Jer. 18.11. 
Behold,
 I 
frame evil against you, and devise a Device against you; Return Ye Now every one from his Evil Way.
 O that this Counsel of God might be Acceptable to us. I would a little alter the Terms of my Text, and say, 
If thou altogether hold thy Sin, at this Time, thou shalt be destroyed for it.






Deduction III.


But how lamentable then is the Condition of 
Them,
 that venture their All, 
against
 the People of God! Such 
Fools
 there are in the World; malicious and prodigious 
Fools
 in∣deed! Such an One was that Fool-hardy Monarch, the King of 
Egypt,
 that would Venture His 
All,
 into the very bottom of the Red-sea, rather than leave the people of God unpursued. How many are there, that will venture their very 
All,
 for the Disturbing and Oppressing of them, concerning whom the God of Heaven said, Long ago, 
Touch them not; Do them no Harm!
 But what get they by this Bargain, this 
Phrensy?
 It was the Speech of God, in Zech. 12.2. 
Behold,
 I 
will make Jerusalem a Cup of Trembling.


 Truly, Every Drop of 
Blood,
 yea; or of 
Tear
 Squeezed from the Abused people of God, proves a 
Cup of Trembling,
 that is, a 
Cup of Poi∣son,
 to the procurers of it; It makes them at Length to Vomit, their very Bowels up. To hurt the people of God, what is it, but, A 
Pushing hard against a great Stone?
 it gives Rubs and Wounds and an horrible Death to the Invaders. All the 
Four Monarchies
 of the World, have Tumbled into Confusion, for their Enmity, to that 
People,
 who are yet to make the 
Fifth.
 To seek the Harm of this people, is to make an Impotent Assault and Batt'ry upon the Omnipotent God Himself: but, 
Wo did ever harden himself against God and prosper?
 Poor, Unworthy, Unthankful 
New-England,
 has long had Experience of such Dis∣appointments befalling of its 
Venturesome
 Ene∣mies. It was noted about the 
Piccardines
 of old, that Reforming people of God, 
If a man be Weary of his Life, let him become an Enemy to the
 Piccardines. This has been the Fate at∣tending those whome the people of God, (and 
This
 people) have been an Ey-sore unto. The great God has taken them in hand and made them find the Risque of their very 
Lives
 in their 
Serpentine Enmity.






Deduction. IV.


For a close; 
May such a Public Spirit then be Awakened in us All for the people of God, in the

 Distress and Danger which is now upon us.


The last Evening fill'd us with new Alarms of an Attack from 
New France
 upon this poor land; which was before involved in Cala∣mities that astonish'd us. I ask your pardon, that the 
Sudden
 Impression of those Newes upon me, has been so 
violent,
 as to force my (tis possible, 
Too Rash
) Thoughts thus to a∣nother Theme than that which I had been preparing for you. But, as the most of those places which the Devastations of the last year fell upon, were the more Pagan Skirts of 
New-England,
 where no 
Minister
 of God was coun∣tenanced; and 
that
 very place which is just now Assaulted and Consumed, has had upon it the Infamy of a most Heathenish Disre∣spect unto a 
Ministry;
 so, on the other side, I cannot speak in any Assembly, where a 
Preacher
 of the Gospel may hope for a more Candid and Courteous Acceptance, than in the Numerous Auditory now before me.


Wherefore, I take leave to 
mind
 you, of what, I suppose every man can 
Tell
 me; That is, That we may all sit and Sigh this Day, th
 clause in Neh. 9.37. 
We are in great Distress.
 And, as the Orator once could say, 
Non est civis Romanus, qui in hac Tem∣pestate Ridere potest;
 He is no 
Roman,
 that can be merry at such a Time as this. Thus may I truly say, 
He is no New-Englander
 (not

 worthy of the Name) 
who at such a Time as this, will not Venture his All, for this Af∣flicted people of God.
 God forbid, that the Des∣cription of the 
New-Englandmen,
 should at any Time, and much more at 
This,
 be 
That
 in Phil. 2.21. 
All seek their own.
 We have at this Time, a great Service to be done for their Majesties: 
K. 
William,
 and 
Q. 
Mary,
 whome God grant long to Reign; and this, not 
only
 by Securing their Interest in 
this
 large Territory, and Consequently in all 
America,
 but 
also
 by making a brisk Salley forth upon the 
French
 Territories, which must else be a Perpetual obstacle to the Thriving of these Plantations. The Service of their Majesties in the 
former
 of these was the cause of the Re∣volutions here almost a year a goe; we are now invited unto their Service in the 
latter
 of them, notwithstanding that the Dissensions that have been sown among us by the 
Reliques
 of our late Oppressors have so much enfee∣bled us. But that which will make my Ap∣plication unto you at this time, yet more Pungent, is, 
That we are undone if we do not now venture our All.




Consider
 1.


We are Precipitated into such 
Destress
 and 
Danger,
 as we have never seen before; No∣thing so 
Exquisite
 has hitherto befallen us. Our cause indeed is That, in Math. 3.10.

 
The Ax is laid unto the Roots of the Trees.
 The 
Knife
 of our God ha's been heretofore cut∣ting and Pruning of us, but either 
Ill
 Fruit, or 
No
 Fruit is the 
Best Fruit
 which we have hitherto yielded unto that glorious Hus∣band-man. Wherefore He is now come forth against us, with an 
Ax,
 a French 
ax,
 accom∣panied with 
Indian Hatchets;
 and our very 
Root
 is like to receive the strokes thereof. Tis wonderful if the Sentence upon the Bar∣ren Fig-tree, be not pass'd upon us, 
Cut them down!
 with an eye to the Execution of that Sentence upon the Jewes, we find mentioned, in Isai. 66 6. 
A Voice from the City, a Voice from the Temple, a Voice of the Lord.
 Even so, at this Time, there is a 
Voice
 coming from al∣most every side of us; there is a 
Voice
 from the 
North,
 a 
Voice
 from the 
East,
 a 
Voice
 from the 
West;
 a 
Voice,
 as Loud as that in the Hea∣vens, which gave Terrour to all this Land a few Months ago. What says this 
Voice,
 but this, 
They are going to be Cut down for ever.
 This is the 
Voice
 of the Combinations, which our Adversaries have made against us; this is the 
Voice
 of the strange Distractions and Di∣visions which the 
Quarrel-some
 among our selves do infest us withall; and this is the 
Voice
 of all our Fears. 
Every thing looks Black.
 For my own part, I freely confess, what issue my own Thoughts are come unto: Tis, That if

 the Blessed God intend that the Divel shall keep 
America
 during the Happy 
Chiliad
 which His Church is now very 
quickly
 Entring into, (I say, very 
quickly,
 for tis now past Questi∣on with me, 
That the Second Wo is past;
 and the 
Third
 you know then 
Cometh quickly
) then our Lord Jesus will within a few Months break up House among us, and we go for our Lodging either to 
Heaven
 or to 
Europe
 in a very little while. But if our God will wrest 
America
 out of the Hands of its old Land-Lord, 
Satan,
 and give these 
utmost ends of the Earth
 to our Lord Jesus, than our present conflicts will shortly be blown over, and something better than, 
A Golden Age,
 will arrive to this place, and this perhaps before all of our 
First Planters
 are fallen a sleep. Now, Tis a dismal 
Uncertainty
 and 
Ambigui∣ty
 that we see ourselves placed in. Briefly, such is our case, 
That something must be done out of hand.
 And indeed, our 
All is at the Stake;
 we are beset with a Thousand Per∣plexities and Entanglements. The Question which we have now before us, in short is This, 
Whether we will venture All, with an Hope to Preserve All,
 or 
Whether we will keep All, with an Assurance to Loose All, by doing so.






Consider
 2.


Tis a Precious 
People
 of God, which the

 present Exigencies press us to the Serving of. The people which has a 
Little while possessed
 this Land may say before the Lord, as they in Isa. 63.19. Lord 
We are thine.
 A Venture of your 
All,
 is bespoke for a people that are in 
Covenant
 with God, and under a Comfortable 
Relation
 to Him. Tis for 
a Peo∣ple
 that the God of Heaven has heretofore miraculously appeared for: A 
People
 which have proportionably more of God among them than any part of mankind beside. 
A People
 who 
concur
 in, and 
Suffer
 for, that Protestation, 
The Lord is our King, our Lord, our Law-giver.
 Who would not Serve such at People? It was an Expression used once by a most hearty Servant of 
New-England,
 (the Honourable 
William Stoughton
) to a very gerat Assembly, 
God Sifted Three Nations, that He might bring choice Grain into this Wilderness.
 The 
Product
 of that 
choice Grain,
 is that which now calls for our Ad∣ventures. If 
New-England
 miscarry, there will then fall some Thousands of People that 
Love the Lord Jesus Christ in Sincerity,
 and that are affectionately 
Acknowledging of Him in all their ways.
 But if Things go well with 
New-England,
 there will Myriads of Praises be continually going up from hence unto the 
God of our Fathers.
 Our God will be 
Praised
 here, for our Deliverances, yea,

 shall I say it? He will be 
Praised
 for it in the Third Heaven too. as it was said, in Rev. 18.20. 
Rejoyce over her, thou Heaven.
 If 
Heaven
 will 
Rejoice
 at the 
Destruction
 of 
Antichrist,
 it will also 
Rejoice
 at the 
Deli∣verance
 of 
New-England,
 which tho it be in the same Latitude with 
Italy,
 is yet a∣mong the Sincerest of its 
Antipodes.
 In the Day when poor 
New-England
 shall be deli∣vered from its present Extremities, Then, 
Rejoyce over her, thou Heaven.
 Doubtless, There will Tidings be carried unto 
Heaven
 of it; and it may be 
particularly
 notify'd un∣to those good old men that went from hence to those Blessed Regions. Our Predecessors which are gone to the 
Spirits of just men made perfect,
 may hear what a Deliverance God has wrought for their poor Children here; and 
Heaven
 will then Ring with Tri∣umphant Praises to the great Saviour of 
New-England,
 who can withold his 
All
 from the Service of 
such
 a People? Me thinks, I should say as the Martyr once, 
A loss, That
 I 
have but one Life to loose!
 Tis 
Immanuels Land
 that we Venture for. The Almost only 
Garden
 which our Lord Jesus has in the vast continent of 
America,
 has the wild Boars of the Wilderness trying to get into it; and That is it which now calls for our Venture of our 
All.




The Psalmist could say, in Psal. 122.
. 
Because of the House of the Lord our God, I will seek thy Good.
 Why, There is among us, 
The House of the Lord our God.
 And this is indeed the Real Cause, of our having been so ma∣ligned, hated, vexed, as we have been. The 
Devils
 are stark mad, that the 
House of the Lord our God,
 is come into these Remote cor∣ners of the World; and they fume, they fret prodigiously, That some of their old Vassals and Bondslaves here, begin to 
pray
 unto the Almighty God. Hence, 'tis, that we were not only of late got into the clutches of Ru∣lers, 
That swore by the Living God, they would Ruine our Churches;
 but upon our Deliverance from 
Them,
 there is now falling upon us an Armed Force, which arm at our total Extir∣pation. The Controversy between Us and 
Them
 is now brought unto that Narrow, in Exod. 32.26. 
Who is on the Lords side?
 Even so, 
Who is for Jesus, against Satan,
 and, 
who is for the true Christian, Protestant Religion, a∣gainst Popery and Paganism?
 You must now venture for one of those. Take your choice my dear Country, men; but there is no room to be 
Indifferent.






Consider
 3.


How 
Much
 is ventured by how 
Many,
 A∣gainst the People of God? This was That which the Psalmist was not a little quickned

 with; in Psal. 119.139. 
My zeal hath consu∣med me, because my Enemies have forgotten thy words.
 Look upon our 
Enemies;
 they endure all sorts of Travel and Hardship; they ven∣ture their 
All,
 that they may do a misehief to us; and shall 
we
 venture 
Nothing
 on the other side? If an 
Haman
 can disburse, above 
eigh∣teen hundred thousand pounds,
 if 
I
 miscount it not, that he might bring an horrid Rout up∣on the People of God; and shall an 
Esther
 now, 
altogether hold her peace?
 Or shall we hug our 
Dust
 so fast as to let go none of it for the Deliverance of this people? There are 
Tumultuous
 and 
Obstreperous
 persons (such 
Ha∣man
 signifies in English) who stick at no∣thing for the 
mischief
 of this people; & shall we stick at any thing for their 
Service?
 Men will Expose themselves to 
Beggary,
 to 
Discre∣dit,
 to untimely 
Death,
 and to Eternal 
Dam∣nation,
 that they may compass their 
Mischie∣vous Devices;
 very shameful will be our Crime, if we 
out-do them
 not in Studies for the Good of our 
Israel.


I have no more now to do, but only to make you these five proposals.








The first Proposal.


Let us be 
One and All,
 that we may the more chearfully and Readily 
Venture our All.
 Alas, 
For the Divisions of New-England, we have great Searchings of Heart!




The Great 
Austin
 would sometimes address his Hearers in such pathetical Terms as those, 
per tromendum Dei Judicium vos Adjuro'
 Thus would I say; and tho' I have no Commission from them for it, yet I would speak it in the Name of all the 
Sensible
 persons in the Land; 
O our Brethren, We Adjure you by the Tremen∣dous Judgments of God,
 that you immediately Abate and Compose all your Differences. E∣very Globule of the Blood shed by the 
French
 among the Contentious 
Albanians
 t'other day, makes a loud cry unto us; and methinks, I hear that cry like the 
Groans of Deadly wound∣ed Men,
 passing over the Woods unto us, 
O do not quarrel any more; but unite immediate∣ly against your more united Enemies.
 May this people become, Like a 
Bundle of Arrows
 bound a little too fast and close, for the strongest Arm to break us; and may our God say of 
New-England,
 as in Cant. 6.9. My 
Dove, my Undefiled, is but One.
 What a sickly, yea, what a 
Rotten
 Body have we, if our Flesh Rankle and Fester for a meer scratch of a 
Pin?
 We have been giving our little 
scratches
 to one another, while we have been mana∣ging the Debates, that the unsettlement of our Government has furnished us withal; but what? Shall they turn into 
Gangrenes
 with us? It is an awful Intimation and Admoni∣tion, in Job. 19.29. 
Wrath brings the punish∣ments

 of the Sword.
 Are we not now Lan∣guishing under the 
Fulfilments
 of that word? we have had 
wrath
 among us; all our Af∣fairs have been Enflamed by 
wrath
 one against another; and because of this, 
Behold, a Sword, a Sword is furbished for the Slaughter.
 Have done then, with all this 
wrath.
 Methinks, the 
Bell
 Rings very loud, that calls upon us, to put out all our 
Fires!
 When the poor 
Spa∣nards at Lima
 t'other day, felt the beginnings of an hideous 
Earthquake
 round about them, one of the first things in their agonies was, 
To make Reconciliations.
 May our 
Heart quake
 at this Day, put us upon doing so. Let us, in short, sacrifice all but 
Conscience,
 to 
peace
 a∣mong our selves Even, the 
Law
 it self, not∣withstanding the Exact Regard which ought to be had unto it, I say, the Law it self in some 
Circumstances
 and 
Punctilio's,
 gives way to the 
publick safety,
 which is the 
supream Law
 of all It was against 
Law,
 for 
Esther
 to ven¦ture upon what she did: but it could not be avoided, or Omitted. How much more, must our 
Will,
 and 
Humour,
 and 
Passion
 give way to the 
Good of the whole?
 My Brethren, The 
Canaanite
 and the 
Perizzite,
 is coming into the Land; and therefore I accost you in those words of 
Abraham,
 Gen. 13.8. 
Let there be no strife,
 I 
pray thee, between Me, and Thee; for we are Brethren.








The Second Proposal.


Let 
Mordecai
 have the Dispose of 
Us
 & our 
All.
 Our God has blessed this People with 
Prudent, Patient, Pious
 RULERS, to whom there belongs that Character of 
Mordecai
 in Esther 10.3. 
Seeking the Welfare of his Brethren and speaking peace to all his Seed.
 It is pu
ely thro' our 
Fault,
 if the Rest of 
His
 Character be not 
Theirs
 also, 
Accepted of the Multitude of his Brethren.
 Let 
These
 be so acknowledged, Obeyed, as they ought to be. The 
Disrespect
 cast upon 
Government,
 has been the thing that has made naked those parts of the Country which most of our Disasters have Light upon and those 
Troublesome
 and 
Implacable
 persons that seek to Enfeeble the Authority into an incapacity of Action at such a time as this, are to be stigmatized as 
Men far from seek¦ing the Welfare of the Children of Is∣rael.
 Nor can any thing be more Ill-boding to 
Ʋs
 & our 
All,
 than the cursed 
Murmurings,
 which the Almighty God hears in our Tents from Day to Day. Instead of 
praying
 to God for the 
Direction
 of our Government, at this Extraordinary time, we spend our time in 
Fretting
 and 
Railing
 at them; 
Nothing they do can please.


And tho' I believe there is not such a well intending nor a better deserving Government in this world, than that which 
New-England


 now sits under the shadow of, nevertheless, what is the whole business of many people, but a 
making
 (I cannot say, finding) faults in their administrations: 'tis not at all admira∣ble to me, I tell you truly, I do not at all ad∣mire at it; that the Fiery Scorpions of 
Cana∣da,
 are now stinging of a Congregation thus Distempered.


But I pray, Are we not 
all
 in a 
Storm?
 And have not our own Votes placed at the 
Helm,
 those worthy persons, that are in this Juncture at it? What? would Every man think to 
Steer
 the Vessel? I can tell you, That you would soon bee weary of it. No∣thing but a measure of 
Grace,
 which I doubt 
you
 are not furnish'd with, would Enable you to undergo the Fatigues of so great a Slavery. Pray, mind the Business of your own Station; Pull the 
Ropes,
 Ply the 
Oars,
 and the 
Sails,
 as you are Commanded; but leave the 
Helm,
 where tis managed by those that can have no other Interest, but what is 
yours.


I know not whether we have never been too like 
Issachar,
 for any other Quality; but I would we were like 
Issachar
 for that in 1 Chron. 12.22. 
they had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do;
 and 
All their Brethren
 were at their com∣mandment. It the 
Members
 fall out

 with the 
Vitals,
 the old 
Romans
 story tells you, the unhappy issue of it.






The Third Proposal.


Let our 
All
 in this World, be very 
Little
 in our opi∣nion of it. 
The World, The World,
 it is truly a most 
Bewitching
 thing; and the 
Love
 of it, will be a 
Root of all Evil
 to us But, is not the 
Spell
 over, is not the 
Charm
 broken yet? Methinks, the 
Enchantment
 should be Dissolved by the other 
Devils,
 that are coming to take 
This
 away. May we become Like 
Strangers
 in the World? We shall be as ready to dispose well of our 
All,
 as the Psalmist was, who could say, in Psal 39 6, 12, 
They are disquieted in vain, who heap up Riches, and know not who shall gather them.
 Why, how came 
Rich∣es
 to be so Little regarded with him? It follows, 
I am a Stranger with thee, and a Sojourner.
 When we Look upon our Earthly 
All,
 think we, 
I shall quickly be gone from it All,
 and think, I 
can do well enough without it All;
 this will encline us to make Right Ventures of our 
All.
 The 
Dutch
 have a saying, which ought to find a Room with us, 
He that hath Lost his Mony, hath Lost Nothing; He that hath lost his Credit, has lost Half; but he only that hath lost his Soul, hath lost All.
 O make sure of a bet∣ter, an Higher, a Nobler 
All,
 than what our 
Earth
 af∣fords; We shall then be Like those, of whom 'twas said in Heb 10 34. 
Ye took joyfully the spoiling of your Goods, knowing in your selves, that you in Heaven have a better and an Enduring Substance.
 If we venture all 
our Goods,
 yet still we shall have 
Heaven
 Left: 
Heaven
 is, 
The good part which cannot be taken away.
 Make sure of 
Heaven,
 and you may stand upon the Ruines of the World, with such Expressions as the Minister of 
Nola
 had, when he was Rifled of 
All
 he had; 
Lord,
 I 
am not concerned about these things, for thou knowest
 (said he, pointing to the Heavens) 
that my All is there!
 Souls get into Christ, and the 
Romish Eagles
 will do us no Hurt;

 when we are gathered into the shadow of His Blessed and 
Saving Wings






The Fourth Proposal.


Let us not Lose our 
Time,
 that we may not Lose our 
All,
 when we venture 
All
 We may say, with a speci∣
 
gard unto 
This Time,
 as in Eph. 5 15. 
Redeem the 
 because the Days are Evil.
 Every thing loudly calls upon us, 
Make haste.
 It was a wonder, that 
All
 was 
 Lost; when, as in Judg. 5.16, 17. Some 
Abode a∣
ng the Sheep-folde,
 and others were intent upon 
Tra∣ding
 and 
Shipping,
 tho' the 
Canaanites
 were upon their Backs. Common prudence now calls for 
Expedition;
 & all things concur in that Advice unto us, 
Be up and be doing.
 Shall we be drawing 
Circles
 in the Earth, when the City is just falling into the Hands of its Enemies. O That every Town in the Country, were so Nimble, in offering the 
Service
 of their 
Quota,
 for the work of 
this Day,
 as they ought to be!






The Last Proposal.


Finally, 
Venture
 to 
speak
 for the People of God Let us make 
Esthers
 Venture in our Prayers; and resolve, as in Isa 62 1 
For Zions sake,
 I 
will not hold my peace.
 Indeed we run something of a 
Venture
 in it, if our pray∣ers become so Frequent, and so Fervent, as that the Omnipotent God should be put upon saying, 
Let me A∣lone!
 For then, if God have determined the Consuming of this place, He will first 
kill
 them that He shall find so 
standing in the Gap.
 But O 
that
 I 
may Dy standing there!
 perhaps, it may Cost some of us our 
Lives,
 that God may, 
Make a way for his Anger;
 but it will cost us our 
Souls,
 if by our Negligence, we 
Leave
 a way for that 
Anger.
 Come then, Betake your selves to zea∣lous 
Prayers
 in every place, Those of you that never yet made one Hearty 
Prayer,
 for 
Goos
 sake; now Be∣gin. 
Craesus
 had a Dumb Son, who tho' he never spoke before; yet seeing a man go to kill his Father, his Agonies made him speak and shriek, 
O don't kill my

 Father!
 poor people, if it could never hitherto be said of you, 
Behold they pray!
 yet I beseech you, 
Be Now
 found upon your knees, and beg, 
Lord, Let not all be lost.
 Even the Pagan 
Mohawks
 upon the late Ca∣lamities at 
Albany,
 have that Sentence in their Propo∣sitions, 
We must now look up to the Heavens!
 O the
 let us 
Christians
 be Looking there. May the 
Wheel of Prayer
 be set a going in all parts of the land; may our publick Lectures, and our 
private Meetings
 in all places be turned into 
Days of Prayer.
 A successful Battel once Commenced with that Watch-word, 
Now for the Fruit of prayer! Now for the Fruit of prayer!
 Why let us be plowing and planting every Day for such 
Fruit.
 Even those who can do 
little
 or 
nothing
 else but pray, may do much by their prayers. We find 
Esther and her Maidens
 at it. The 
Devout Women
 may this way obtain the Favour of the Almighty for us. 
Melancthon
 hoped the 
Reformation
 would be carried on, 
Because godly Women would meet and pray for that Mercy.
 Our 
preservation
 may in like manner be promoted Yea, and 
Serious Children
 too, may make us all beholden to them. God spared 
Ninive,
 because of the 
Children
 in it; You 
Children
 that shall pray, and cry, and call, as well as you can unto the Lord, may have a great Influence upon the sparing of 
New-England.


Let me conclude my SERMON, as the Martyr his Letter, 
pray, pray, pray,
 Never more need than 
NOW.










BY The 
GOVERNOUR
 and GENERAL COURT 
the COLONY of the
 Massachusetts Bay; 
In New-England.


IT having been a thing too sensible and obvious to escape the Observation of all who are not wholly strangers in our 
Israel;
 that this poor Land has laboured under a long 
Series
 of Afflictions and Calamities, whereby we have suffered successively in our precious and pleasant Things, and have seen the anger of the righteous God against us, expressed in Characters, which ought to be as terrible as they must needs be visible unto us; it having also, both by the 
Testimonies
 of those, that after the most humble and exact Enquiries into the mind of God, have discovered the same unto us, and by their own general and repeated Confessi∣ons, become undeniable; that a corrup∣tion

 of Manners attended with inexcusa∣ble 
Degeneracies
 and 
Apostasies,
 found in too many of this People, is the cause of that Controversie, which the God of our Fathers has, for many years maintaini
 with us: It being likewise at this da
 such a 
Probation time
 with all 
New-En¦gland
 as this Countrey has never before seen from the first foundation of it, and the judgments of that Holy God, who hath beheld how incorrigible we have hi∣therto been under all His Dispensations, now arriving to such an extremity. That the 
Ax is laid to the Root of the Trees,
 and we are in imminent danger of perish∣ing, if a speedy 
REFORMATION
 of our 
Provoking Evils
 prevent it not:


This COURT have therefore thought it needful to praeface their other Endea∣vours for the Publick Welfare, with a very solemn Admonition unto this whole People, that they every where give De∣monstrations of a thorough 
Repentance,
 without which we have little reason to hope for any good succese in our Affairs.


Wherefore it is Ordered, that the Laws

 of this Colony against 
Vice,
 and all sorts of 
Debauchery
 and 
Prophaneness
 (which 
Laws
 have too much lost their edg by the late Interruption of the Government) be now faithfully and vigorously put in Execution; Particularly the 
LAWS
 a∣gainst 
Blasphemy, Cursing, Prophane Swear∣ing Lying, unlawful Gaming, Sabbath break∣ing, Idleness, Drunkenness, Ʋncleanness,
 and all the Enticements and Nurseries of such 
Impieties.
 Together with all other the wholsome 
Laws
 and 
Orders
 agreeable to the present Circumstances of the Coun∣trey; by the Execution whereof, we may approve our selves 
a peculiar People, zea∣lous of good works.


And as all Persons are hereby warned to avoid those 
Vices
 which these 
Laws
 are designed for the Prevention and Cha∣stisement of (the 
Lovers
 of, and 
Plea∣ders
 for, such Iniquities, being among the principal 
Troublers
 of their Countrey) So all inferiour 
Officers
 are enjoyn'd to perform their Duty in finding and bring∣ing out Offenders against the aforesaid 
Laws,
 and withal to give notice to such

 Offenders that they must expect the Ju∣stice of an 
Exemplary Punishment.


And that no attempt towards 
Refor∣mation,
 may want that Assistance which all good men will be willing to give the¦reunto, 'tis hoped that the Ministers of God will to the publick Reading of this 
Proclamation,
 adjoyn their own fervent Labours, not only for the Rebukeing and Suppressing of those 
Provoking Evils,
 which are marked for common Hatred: but also to witness against the more 
Spiritual Sins,
 which fall not so much under the cognizance of Hu∣mane 
Laws,
 namely, such as 
Ʋnbelief, Worldliness, Heresy, Pride, Wrath, Strife, Envy,
 and the 
Neglect
 of commu∣nion with God, in both Natural and In∣stituted 
Worship,
 and the 
Contempt
 of the 
everlasting Gospel,
 with a shameful want of due 
Family-Instruction,
 which are the 
Roots of Bitterness
 in the midst of us.


Moreover, after the Example of 
Pious Rulers
 commended in Sacred Writ; the 
Churches
 every where are hereby advised to give utmost Encouragement unto the

 Faithful and Watchful 
Pastors
 of their Souls; to seek (where they 
lack
) a full Settlement and Enjoyment of such 
Offi∣cers,
 as the Lord Jesus Christ has appoint∣ed for their Edification; to reflect seri∣ously and frequently on their 
Covenants,
 to sharpen their 
Discipline
 against those that 
walk disorderly;
 and immediately to compose their 
Differences
 and 
Conten∣tions
 (if 
such
 there be) whereby any of them may be distempered and enfeeb∣led, that so they may become 
Terrible as an Army with Banners.


Furthermore it is Expected that the several 
Towns
 within this Jurisdiction do speedily furnish themselves with all fit means for the good 
Education of Youth,
 and take special care to avoid 
Factions
 & 
Quarrels
 in their other 
Town Affairs;
 and all Plantations are strictly forbidden to continue without the Advantages of ha∣ving the 
Word
 of God constantly preacht unto them, or without a Sincere and Active Industry, to obtain the Presence of the Lord Christ in all His blessed 
Or∣dinances.




And Finally, this whole People are hereby advertised, that if these 
Essayes
 for an universal Reformation, shall be obstru∣cted (as those in the dayes of the Reform∣ing 
Josiah
 were) by Mens being 
settled on their Lees,
 and 
hating to be Reformed,
 they can reasonably look for no other issue than this, that the jealous God 
will punish them yet seven times more for their iniquities:
 But, that if the God of Hea∣ven shall grant unto them the Grace to 
Remember whence they are fallen, and Re∣pent and do the first Works,
 it will give a greater Prospect of 
Prosperity,
 than can arise from the best 
Counsels,
 and biggest 
Armies.


The Work of 
Reformation
 thus 
endea∣voured,
 is now 
recommended
 unto the bles∣sing of the Almighty, with whom alone it is, to Recover a Backsliding people; perswading our selves, that the Event thereof would be 
Salvation nigh unto us, and Glory dwelling in our Land.
