MATTERS CON∣CERNING THE PALATI∣NATE, WITH THE DEFEAT of Monsieur 
Tilley
 in the Palatinate, and the Duke of Memorancy in 
France.


T
Here are two sorts of men in the world, compared to tame and wilde beasts, and these are flatte∣rers and detractors, and that wor∣thily: For what vice may he pre∣dominant in a Prince, or Com∣mon wealth, which a flatterer can∣not guild ouer with the faire appearance and colours of vertue: and what businesse can present it selfe on the stage of this world, but a detractor will calum∣niate and desire it; which is more apparant at this in∣stant in the combustions of 
Europe,
 then euer was heard of in many ages: for how many be there that sooth vp the humour of some kings (besides the Ie∣suites, whose profession is blinde ignorance, and su∣perstitious zeale, euen to set forward impietie) to stand vpon termes of soueraigntie and imperious∣nesse, as is great reason in Monarchies, though the subiects be slaughtered, the countrey deuasted, the people mangled, the peace dilacerated, the Churches abandoned, religion defaced, and God blasphemed: and how many be there that discredit the cause of

 distressed Princes, and the thriuing of religious busi∣nesses, although the finger of God doth point it out that fairer daies shall follow stormy weather, which is most apparant concerning the 
Bohemian
 affaires, and the 
Palatinates
 recouery, wherein both flatterer and detractor step on the stage of this world to act their Scenes with deceitfull hurts and malitious in∣tents. The flatterer carryed away with outward showes of the Papacy, and 
Catholicke
 Princes, will not apprehend, that there can be any determination of their greatnesse, but cry out with 
Nabuchadnezer
 to worship the golden image of their Monarchy. The detractor shaking his head, and biting his lip at any successe shall happen, and deriding the busi∣nesse, as if the Gyants attempted to fight against hea∣uen. Thus haue they magnified the house of 
Austria
 and the proceedings of the Empire: thus haue they discredited the King of 
Bohemias
 attempts, and set strange characters on his actions.


But as in all disputations there is a Moderator: so would I might now meete with such men, as will stand Neuters, and neither preuaricate iudgement, nor ouerthrow veritie: and if the higher matters are too transcendent for their capacitie, yet let them giue way to true relations, and honest reports, without scornes, or cachinations: but because I shall neuer haue my expectation satisfied in this kind in regard of the multiplicy of humours in a common wealth, I leaue them all to bee deceiued themselues, or deceiue others, and onely apply my selfe in this discourse to such men, who out of ciuill honestie entertaine good newes with ioy, and welcome bad

 with commiseration and pittie, making this vse of both, that God is the manifester of his owne iudge∣ments and mercy to all the world. And so to the bu∣sinesse in hand, and to tell you what hath hapned of late in the 
Palatinate,
 since the King of 
Bohemia
 came there, and chanced in other places as the cause hath thriued, and men haue had their mindes stirred vp with good affections.


Know then, that the fifteenth of our Aprill, and the fiue and twentieth 
Stilo nouo,
 1622. there came letters from 
Stuchgaret,
 that a thousand horse, and foure thousand foote of Duke 
Weymers
 of 
Saxony
 arriued at 
Laffen
 ouer the Neckar, who brought word that the next day there will be also 3000. at 
Rottenburg
 for the Marquesse of 
Baden,
 who cōmeth in person to set forward the 
Bohemian
 cause. But the same day there was a mixture with as bad newes: for they will haue it that Generall 
Tilley
 came to neather 
Gemunds
 a prety great towne, and as hee serued the peasants in the villages, so he vsed the peo∣ple in this place, killing all the souldiers, slaughtring most part of the Burghers, torturing the preachers, and sparing neither Captaine nor officers, nay the very schollers were subiect to his fury, so that it see∣med he was either blinde with ignorant zeale, or mad with intemperate rage.


A little before 
Leopaldus
 had sent downe a 1000. souldiers into his countrey, who had passage euen by permission of the people and some towne garri∣sond with 
Mansfields
 men to march ouer the bridge toward 
Haggenaw,
 and I must confesse, that though

 
Leopaldus
 hath beene much disappointed in his ex∣spectation for diuers troopes out of 
Italie,
 and mo∣ney from 
Spaine,
 yet came their souldiers dayly from 
Austria,
 and certaine companies of 
Swiss
 are ready to marshall a prety army in 
Alsatia,
 had not the the garrison of 
Haggenaw
 made a fearefull salley vp∣on some scattered troopes, killed diuers souldiers, and brought eight Captains of horse into the towne, which when the rest vnderstood, whom 
Mansfield
 had placed in the villages, and loath to be behinde their fellowes in glorious exploytes and profitable booty, they likewise drew to a head of three thou∣sand, and approched a village in which were fifteen-hundred of 
Leopaldus
 men, whom they not onely frighted with an alarum, but discomfited with a great slaughter, taking some prisoners, and many armes: but you must know in these disasters it is farre better here then with Monsieur 
Tilley,
 because the souldiers haue an ordinary ransome, and vpon surprisals, there is an ordinary deliuery, wherein and whereby Count 
Mansfield
 hath gotten such a reputation for the faire sparings of all people that submit, or yeeld him con∣tribution, that the better sort commended his di∣scretion and military customes, and inferiors pray for his successe and augmentation of honour, especially clap their hands for ioy, when they heare him cry out for the Cospell, and the King of 
Bohemia.
 Yea I will be bold to say that these warres haue made more true hearted Protestants, then all the flatteries of Peace, and wantonnesse of prosperitie could euer doe.




Much about this time (and here I pray you par∣don me for precedencie of Dayes, or Actions; for I would be loth to tye you or my selfe to such sear∣ches: it is sufficient, that you shall receiue the Re∣lations fully, honestly, and truely, as they chaunced) And so I say, much about this time Count 
Mans∣field
 came to 
Germishem
 with three Regiments, whi∣ther also repaired Monsieur 
Rauillau,
 to treat with him about matter of great importance, especially a Truce: but hee now answered, that hee could not determine of any thing, vntill the King of 
Bohemia
 were setled, who should dispose of Businesse at his owne pleasure.


Vpon the necke of this, as wee say, there came as∣surance of the Marquesse of 
Badens
 preparation to the Warre: who sent word, that his Armie was in a readinesse, but hee would willingly haue a Campe at 
Durmishem,
 as being able to keepe the Field him∣selfe, hauing leuied Souldiers, and trayned Bands, to the number of ten thousand, besides Waggons and Munition, Carriages and Pioners, with all other Furniture belonging to a great Captaine: Nay, his Customes were so Religious, that in the middest of his Troupes hee obserued the Sabboth, and com∣manded both Prayer and Fasting for one Meale in the same, whensoeuer hee determined any Attempt, or set himselfe a-worke for befitting Enterprises. To this you may adde the Arriuall of Palatine 
Lodo∣wick Phillips
 at 
Germersteme,
 and many Friends in o∣ther places, as true fore-runners of the King of 
Bo∣hemia's
 comming indeed.




Monsieur 
Tilley
 all this while ranged vp and downe, and sometimes shewed his Horse in the Fields before 
Ladenberg,
 and sometimes came with his Foot to giue Alarums to 
Heydelberg,
 and some∣times terrified the Townes with diuers Outrages, and at all times watched opportunitie, to be reuen∣ged on Count 
Mansfield,
 or at least to take him at aduantage in some Expedition, that hee might ac∣knowledge hee had a Souldier to his Aduersarie, and as great a deseruer of Renowne as himselfe: In which courses hee continued, to the affrighting both of Townes, Villages, People, and the whole Armie, till the King of 
Bohemia
 came indeede; by whose occasion, the second Battaile, which is promised you, chanced, as you shall heare here∣after; though for my part I could bee contented with the Title of a Skirmish. The denomination of Battaile carryes too much terror with it, and too much curiositie of distinction, as beeing the highest part of Militarie Discipline: in which, many circumstances are to bee considered, as mu∣tuall Agreement, a Day appointed, the Trenches cast open, the maine Forces vnobscured, the Troopes orderly marshalled, the Cannon placed, and in a word, a preparation made to Death and Slaughter, as you see a Feast appointed to entertaine some great Prince.


Now came the time, the long-wished time of the arriuall of the King into the Palatinate, about which there is some disparitie of reports. For some will haue his Armie to meet him after his Conuoy

 from the Duke of 
Bulloigne:
 Some say, hee tooke Waggon, for the ease and accommodating his Per∣son; and some say, hee out-stripped the Armie, and came onely with three Post-horse to 
Gernshem,
 from whence, hee spent three seuerall dayes in visiting 
Mainhem, Franckendale,
 and 
Heydelberg:
 in all which places, according to the common acclamations in welcomming their Princes, as their Ioy exceeded, their Ceremonies augmented; and the Prince saw plainly, it was no common custome of the peoples welcomming their Princes, whosoeuer they be, but a heartie desire to shew their loue and obedience vnto him, who had ventured his life to come amongst them, and would neuer desist, till they were recom∣penced for their losses.


But it was too soone to begin so effectually, and so there passed at this time a reciprocal thankfulnesse and ceremonie betweene them: yet in my conscience it lacked some feruency, because the ignorant people imputed some vnkindnesse vnto him, in regard that by his forsaking of them, they were compelled to for∣sake their houses, and inheritances, to leaue them to a strangers vsurpation. But this aspersion was quickly wiped away with a gentle hand of obseruation, and a present entertaining of new ioy, especially that they now hoped, that these strange Harpies which deuou∣red their plentie, should eyther bee expulsed by the valour of 
Zetes
 and 
Culines,
 or enforced to a compo∣sition, which might deliuer euery one his portion a∣gaine: which although it seemed now a little dimini∣shed, yet they well hoped, time and good husbandry

 would reduce to her pristinate fulnesse and hand∣somenesse: To which they were the rather induced, because the Marquesse of 
Baden
 hath much augmen∣ted Count 
Mansfields
 Army, by vniting their For∣ces together, and visiting King 
Frederick,
 who can∣not be saluted otherwise, nor receiue any Character, then the King of 
Bohemia.


When these Princes were thus solemnly met, and that a Councell of Warre had resolued on some things worthy their presence, and so great an Army; Monsieur 
Rauille
 was discharged, and sent home without an answer: For they were resolued to haue no Peace, but to make way to new fortunes by sharpe Swords.


In the meane while that these things passed in the Palatinate, 
Bauaria
 suspecting the worst, had ray∣sed more Forces of his owne, and had more sent him by the Emperour: so that there departed from 
Vppenhem
 ouer the Bridge eleuen Troupes of Horse into the Lantgraue of 
Darmstadts
 Countrey, to ioyne with 
Tilley
 at 
Simpen.


And thus nothing was expected, but Mischiefe, and Reuenge on all sides: For no body durst looke out of 
Laudenberg,
 by reason of the Horsemen of 
Heydelberg,
 which watched them continually; nor was there now any thing thought vpon, but watch∣ing one another, to take aduantage for their owne ends and purposes.


And in this manner stood the Businesse of the Pa∣latinate at this houre; and so must rest a while, till you heare the newes of 
Silesia.




The Duke of 
Saxony
 somewhat troubled, that 
Lu∣satia
 was denyed him by the Emperour, remained rather discontented then pleased, and so gaue way to the Princes of 
Silesia
 to cal a Diet because of the vp∣rores. For the souldiers had mustred themselues to assault 
Glatz:
 but were repulsed by the yong Earle of 
Thorn,
 who slue many of them, and made them retire with great losse, whereupon to preuent the worst, he entertained 150. souldiers more, who came from 
Wittingham,
 by which occasion they are so strength∣ned and hartned, that they haue protested to defend themselues to the last man. In like manner the other Protestants are much incensed against the Bishops, and euery where there is crying out vpon the Catho∣lickes tyranny, and wicked Iesuites: whereupon the Bishop of 
News
 will take from them of 
Cuntele
 the vse of their Churches, prohibite their assemblies, de∣ny the reading of the Scriptures, and as ill as 
Iulian
 the Apostate, debarre the intercourse of Christians: now 
Cuntele
 is three mile distant from 
Meuse,
 and was euer a priuiledged place, whither they of the religion resort, and were prowd againe to be reputed Protestants. For although in these places there was some disparity betweene the Caluinists and Luthe∣rans, which bred some scandall to the professors: yet were they all glad of the generall title of Protestants, as you see at this houre, the Papists generally reioyce at the name of Catholicke: from the Bishops exam∣ple many Priests and officialls performed the like, but the people vnaccustomed to such indignities, from murmuring fell to opposition, and so stood vp∣on a guard of defence, and began some slender oppo∣sitions

 in many places, resorting to the Princes and Lords of the Prouince both in towne and villages, desiring them to let them haue the freedome of their soules, how euer the Emperour or Duke of 
Saxony
 vnder him would seeme to command their bodyes, and obedience to extraordinary contributions: vpon this there is great mustring of souldiers round about and the Emperour sent a new messenger to the Duke of 
Saxony
 to bee carefull of the gouernment. For he knew the losse of 
Bohemia
 depended vpon the abso∣lute reuolt of 
Silesia:
 But the truth is, they were affrayde of the Marquesse of 
Ieggendorff
 euerie where, who for all the Parliament of 
Hunga∣rie,
 and the great assembly there to rectifie the disorders of the Common-wealth, grew strong with new forces, and was reputed twen∣tie thousand, and feared to come against them presently: For the countrey grew mutinous, and euery man suspected one another, considering the Emperour was reputed weake, and would glad∣ly haue a peace, if hee knew which way to obtayne it with his honour: to which I am the rather induced, because new Souldiers must haue money and good entertainment, and the old were worne out with many and diuers difficul∣ties; especially slaughter, hunger and sickenesse; besides the Countreys lay wasted where they quartered, and the Inhabitants did not husband nor till their grounds as they were woont in former times: and this was the generall cause almost throughout all 
Germanie,
 at which the people euery where were very much mooued, be∣cause

 troubles arose not for Religion or the Gospels sake as the maine poynt of the same: but for ambitious titles, and matters of State and gouernement, of which there is neither time nor occasion to dispute heere: and thus much for the remoter places.


Now wee may draw neere home, and come to that you desire, the second Skirmish I pro∣mised you, which was against Monsieur 
Tilley
 in the 
Palatinate,
 and concerning which there are diuers reports: but this Letter is come from 
Crutsnach,
 wherein the Spaniards lie in Garrison, and therefore I am perswaded they would make the best of a businesse against them, and bee as sparing as they could to discredit their owne affayres, and so they tell the tale in this manner.


Although the Report of the King of 
Bohe∣mias
 comming into the 
Palatinate
 was quickely divulged, and made knowne to all the Garri∣sons, especially 
Openhem
 and 
Crutsnach,
 where the Spaniards lay, and had laine euer since their comming into the Countrey: so that now they were very well fortified and intrenched: yet as they had beene quiet all this Winter, they were now likewise neuer startled by the rumour, so that it was then supposed, that they had some priuate or secret directions so to doe, or knew there was some capitulation about their remouing and rendition of the place: notwith∣standing 
Bauaria
 would not bee so answered, but as the Emperour had giuen him the Countrey, he would maintaine the Title, and also iustifie the

 possession: but as you heard in many places, there came interpositions, and no doubt would prooue him an intruder. Besides, when it was obiected vnto him, that although the Emperour as exasperated a∣gainst the Prince 
Fredericke,
 had done this for the present, and made his indignation an example of reuenge: yet either it could not last, or time would worke a reconciliation: but as for him, it must needs be a perpetuall cause of displeasure, and their poste∣rity in the remembrance would hunt one another in∣to the fields of slaughter and warre. To this 
Bauaria
 replyed, let hereafter times looke to themselues, hee would not goe about to preuent destiny, he had now for himselfe his limitation, & therefore regarded no more, then the present, his owne glory, and the Em∣perors dignitie, which in his failing now must needs be made a scorne to all nations: whereupon he pro∣ceeded (as you haue diuers times heard) and was in∣deed the onely supportation which his Imperiall Maiestie trusted vnto, as affecting the reuolt of 
Prague,
 opposing the enemies of 
Bohemia
 and 
Mora∣uia,
 repulsing the souldiers which had begun in 
Au∣stria,
 and now maintaining an army in the 
Palatinate,
 of which hee made Monsieur 
Tilley
 Generall, who had no question deserued well of fame and report for many sundry actions, wherein both himselfe and his Master had attained the reputation of good soul∣diers.


In this course did they continue all this winter, repining at nothing more then the proceedings of Count 
Mansfield,
 who was now the onely barre and hindrance of their fortunes, wherefore they watched

 all opportunities to oppose him, but hee grew too strong for them, and as I may say too prowd: for he left them in scorne to a hard winter, and made way for his owne glory, euen through the Pallaces of Bi∣shops, and countreys of Catholickes, which neither 
Bauaria
 nor 
Tilley
 could preuent. Yea, when hee had done what he listed, he came backe againe amongst them with greater fury and more impetuous vio∣lence, like the Ramme, which fighting with his ad∣uersary, retireth by little and little, but not for feare or dastardlinesse, but to returne with greater courage and force: thus in the meane time comes the King of 
Bohemia,
 as I sayd, into the 
Palatinate
 a∣gaine, and found 
Bauaria
 and 
Tilley
 springing with the spring to new vigour and lustre, insomuch that at two seuerall times 
Tilley
 had surprised some part of his carriages, and slaine some few of the reare of his army: yea he continued with that brauery, that hee did shew himselfe most when the King was strongest especially after the King of 
Bohemia
 was come into the Palatinate: for then he bestirred himselfe indeed, and not onely spoyled the villages, but threatned 
Heydelberg,
 who had many alarums by his meanes, and many reports of her besieging: not thus conten∣ted, he braued the campe himselfe, and came out in fury to set vpon the King in an audacious manner, and so a skirmish began, which a little rebated his fury, but yet not eclipsed his glory.


Here gentle Reader I know not what to say vnto thee, because rumour is spred into streames con∣cerning this matter: but in regard my Letter comes from 
Crutsnach,
 from the Spaniards, and

 that all Letters tend to one purpose, that there was such a defeat, I will follow my Copie, let other men please themselues as they list, and so they tell the tale thus.


The King after hee had ioyned his force that 
Mansfield
 had sent vnto him with Sir 
Horatio Vere,
 hauing occasion to remooue his army, was pursued, or if you will, attended vpon by Monsieur 
Tilley,
 who marched along with all his forces to ouerlooke the proceedings, which was orderly performed, vn∣till the King came to a bridge, where for the time he made a stand, as indeede not thinking it conue∣nient to passe ouer, considering 
Tilley
 was so neere, and in a valley beside him.


Tilley
 againe coniecturing that he made this stay for feare of him, came the bolder forward, and pres∣sed so fast toward him, that hee was compelled to breake through a battaile of his owne pikes with his horse, which must needs disorder his foot, and which was iudiciously discouered by the King: insomuch that being well prepared, hee tooke the aduantage, sending some horse to entertaine these, who came so forward, and aduancing with the rest against the dis∣ranked pikes that could not so easily be brought in∣to forme and fashion againe, and so without dwel∣ling long on the businesse, because they continued not long in the skirmish, 
Tilleyes
 battle was ouer∣throwne, and he himselfe had much adoe to escape: then followed a strange slaughter: for there were pe∣rished and taken prisoners betweene 5. or 6. thou∣sand men, but most of them slaine, and last of all it ended with spoyle, for the souldiers tooke away their

 armes, and stripped their bodyes, leauing them na∣ked to the fowles of the ayre. Thus is 
Tilley
 escaped, and therefore we can say no more of him: yet onely Count 
Mansfield
 is now a subiect to talke of, and no question will run in some violent course of glory, if the Emperour doe not speedily send more forces, and raise a greater army: for in my conscience this victory hath elated him more then all his former proceedings in the Bishopricke of 
Spires
 or 
Leopal∣dus
 countrey: to which I haue a faire way of beleefe, in regard that heretofore 
Mansfield
 was willing to hearken to a parley, and entertained the Emperours messages, and Letters about a peace: but now he gaue it out, it was onely to winne time, and to com∣passe his endes, which were to serue the King of 
Bohemia,
 and his comming into the Palatinate, by whom he would be both directed, and commanded, and without whose permission he would not so much as consent to a truce or cessation of armes.


At last (as you haue heard) the Palatine comes vnto him, and is welcommed in euery place and applauded of all the people, so that it is doubted, hee will stand vpon the higher termes, because hee hath the stronger force: as for the Spanish Garri∣sons, they are firme and well prouided, yet I see no reason for their continuance, except 
Baua∣ria
 bee supplyed, and a new order taken to re∣nue the warre: For whether warre or peace, I am resolued, that Prince 
Frederick
 will not suffer vs thus to remaine in his countrey, and be as thorns in his sides.




To this effect was the Letter from 
Crutsnach,
 writ∣ten by one of the Garrison, and therefore I am per∣swaded it was impartiall, and according to the Busi∣nesse: so that there is hope for the generall Cause to thriue, and the particular Businesse of the Palatinate to cheare vs with a new recouerie. And thus much for those Affaires.


Heere is also another Letter come secretly from 
Paris,
 concerning the Kings Forces in 
Languedock,
 which I suppose is very conuenient to be published, according to the probabilitie of the matter, and the fearefulnesse of the Time. It is not my purpose to dispute of the Actions of Princes, but to lament the poore estate of Protestants. It cannot bee hid from the eares of the World, that is not hid from the eyes of the People; and so, as rumour hath told vs of the distresses of the Protestants of 
France,
 good thoughts haue instructed vs to wish the pacification of their Troubles, and pray for the diuersion of the Kings anger against them, with the cessation of the Warre. But it will not be: And therefore, for my part, I referre the Businesse to God, who can cure the wounds of his Church, and comfort the hearts of his People, which haue of late, especially in 
France,
 been more sadded then euer before; in regard there is a Booke published in 
Paris
 of Monsieur 
Subizes
 defeat going to 
Rochel,
 whom the King followed in person, and slew many of his company: this Relation filled their soules with griefe, and their eyes with teares; and in such a manner the sorrow for the same en∣creased, that they would not admit of recouerie, and ioy, although they presently heard, that Monsieur

 Duke 
de Rohan, Subizes
 Brother, being in the field for the Protestants in 
Languedock,
 had giuen Duke 
Me∣morancy,
 the Admirall of 
France,
 a great Ouerthrow, which is thus confirmed.


After the Iesuites had preuayled with the 
French
 King to goe against 
Rochel,
 and prosecute the Busi∣nesse of 
Montalbon,
 the Souldiers were mustered in euery place, and the Generall of the Armie proclay∣med nothing but Warre and Destruction; yet was there Oppositions against them: and the Protestants of 
Prouince
 and 
Languedock
 well hoped, that Mon∣sieur 
Desguiers
 would take their Cause in hand, and defend their Religion; which whether he will or no, is yet doubtfull, and so hangs in suspence.


But Monsieur 
de Rohan
 would not tarry for his re∣solution, and raysed such Forces as he could, to sup∣ply 
Mountabon,
 and defend the Countrey: against whom was sent Duke 
Memorancy,
 as Generall of the Kings Army, with other Lords and Gentlemen of qualitie; who came forward with a goodly Army, and too goodly (if it had pleased God otherwise) because it was against their Brethren. But Kings command, and subiects must obey: 
Mountmorancy
 comes forward apace, and 
Mountaban
 was afraid of a new obsession: but it proued otherwise. For 
Rohan
 was couragious, and presumed on the Cause, though it were against his Prince: so in plaine termes (as they say) they fell to a Battaile; in which, all things were ordered belonging to Martiall Discipline, but that the Lord of Battailes did disorder the Businesse. For comming to blowes, and ioyning with furie, 
Memorancy
 gaue way, and 
Rohan
 tooke the aduan∣tage:

 yet the fight continued long, and till the maine Rout was too too apparant, there seemed no diffe∣rence. But at last, as no extremitie can last, the Vic∣torie fell to the Protestants, and the Admirall was taken prisoner, with two Brothers of his Bloud; but one of them died of his wounds, and many other were slaine out-right: The Letter sayes fiue thou∣sand, the Rumor more, but the Religious heart sayes there were too many of these, considering the Busi∣nesse was betweene Friends and Kindred, Countrey∣men and of one Nation, Christians and Neighbors, and not betweene Strangers and Enemies to the Kingdome.


This is that wee receiue from forraine Parts, and this is that wee hearken after in our owne Countrey: euery one wishing well to the King of 
Bohemia's
 proceedings, euery one praying truely for the afflic∣ted Churches abroad; yea, cursing the Iesuites for such a Doctrine, that bellowes out nothing but Warre and Death, Slaughter and Reuenge, Cruel∣tie and Spoyle, when yet the Sauiour of the World bad 
Peter
 put vp his Sword, and feed his Flocke; rode with 
Hosanna
 and 
Palmes
 to 
Ierusalem,
 and not with Armies and Triumph; submitted to Scornes and Buffetting, and did not reuenge himselfe: And yet these men dare seduce the Princes of the World, and blaspheme the God of Heauen, who laughes them to scorne for the present, and will in time to come cast them in a Bed of Affliction with the Whore of 
Babylon.


FINIS.
