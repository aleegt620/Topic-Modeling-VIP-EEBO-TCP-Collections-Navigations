TO THE Right Reverend Father in GOD, GILBERT, By Divine Providence Lord Bishop of 
SARƲM,
 and Chancellor of the most Noble Order of the GARTER.


May it please your Lordship,


WHatever your Thoughts may be of all that can be called mine in this Work, I am certain you will approve of the design I had in

 making it publick; which was to sa∣tisfie the World, That there has al∣ways been a considerable visible Church upon Earth, that never be∣lieved the 
Doctrines of the Pope's Supremacy, Purgatory, Transub∣stantiation, Adoration of Images, Auricular Confession,
 &c. To which good End, if this Treatise should any ways contribute (as I am persuaded it must) I am then secure, that for that Reason alone you will pardon any Mi∣stakes I may have made in putting it together; as also the Presumption of inviting you to read it, by prefixing your great Name to it; a thing I should never have ventured to have done, had I not found by experience your Lordship's Candor and Goodness to be equal, to the known exactness of

 your Judgment. I beg your Lordship's Blessing, and am,


My LORD,


Your Lordship's most humble and most obliged Servant, MICHAEL GEDDES.

Preface
 to a 
Missal,
















A Short History OF THE Church of 
MALABAR:
 From the time of its being first Dis∣covered by the 
Portuguezes,
 in the Year 
1501.
 until the Celebration of the following Synod in the Year 
1599.


THE Country of 
Malabar
 begins at 
Cana∣nor,
 a Town in the Northern 
Latitude
 of 11 degrees and 20 minutes, and ends at Cape 
Comorim,
 in the Northern 
Latitude
 of 7 degrees and ⅔ds.


It contains divers Kingdoms, as 
Cochim, Tra∣vancor, Gundaca, Pimenta, Margate,
 &c. and a∣bounds with Ports, as 
Calecut, Cale, Cochim, Cou∣lam,
 &c. Most of its Princes and Nations are 
Heathens,
 and extreamly superstitious in the Wor∣ship

 of 
Pagods,
 of which there are several a∣mong them of incredible Riches.


The 
Serra
 or 
Gate,
 as the Natives call it, is a Ridge of Mountains running 200 Leagues from North to South, the South end whereof is inha∣bited by Christians, who call themselves the 
Chri∣stians of St. Thomas,
 upon the account of their ha∣ving first been converted to the Christian Faith by the Apostle of that Name. They have al∣ways, or at least for 1300 years, been under the Patriarch of 
Babylon,
 who, as their 
Meterane
 or Arch-Bishop died, took care to send them ano∣ther, who resided still among them, and was had in great Reverence both by Christians and Infidels. As for the Doctrines and Customs of this Church, I shall referr the Reader to the Ac∣counts he will meet with of them in the follow∣ing History.


The first news of this ancient, but remote Church, was brought to 
Europe
 by 
Pedral∣vares Cabral,
 who putting into 
Cranganor
 in the year 1501. and meeting there with several of those Christians, he perswaded two of them, who were Brothers, to come along with him to 
Por∣tugal,
 where the eldest, whose Name was 
Mat∣thias,
 died at 
Lisbon;
 and the other, whose Name was 
Joseph,
 went first to 
Rome,
 and from thence to 
Venice,
 where, upon his information, a Tract was publish'd in 
Latin
 of the State of the Church of 
Malabar,
 and is printed at the end of 
Fascicu∣lus Temporum.




The year following the Christians of 
St. Tho∣mas
 hearing of 
Don Vasco da Gama
 being at 
Co∣chim,
 with a considerable Fleet of Ships, sent some of their Body to let him know, that under∣standing that he was a Subject of a Christian King, they beg'd the favour of him to take them under his Masters Protection, that so they might be de∣fended against the Oppressions and Injuries which were done them daily by 
Infidel
 Princes, and for a lasting Testimony of their having put them∣selves under the King of 
Portugal,
 they sent his Majesty a Rod tipp'd at both ends with Silver, with three little Bells at the head of it, which had been the Sceptre of their Christian Kings, for such they are reported to have had formerly, tho' upon no very good grounds, so far as I can per∣ceive.


The Admiral 
Vasco da Gama,
 not being in a condition at that time, to do any more for them, gave them a great many good words, promising them, in his Masters name, the favour and pro∣tection they had desired, and which he was sen∣sible they stood in great need of.


In the year 1505 two Christians, who were fa∣mous for their great skill in casting great Guns, and whom, for that reason, 
Don Vasco da Gama
 had taken along with him to the 
Indies,
 ran o∣ver to the 
Samorim,
 and were the first that in∣troduc'd the use of Artillery among the 
Malabars:
 For the 
Venetians
 foreseeing that their great 
In∣dian
 Trade would be utterly ruin'd, by the new Passage that was discover'd to the 
Indies
 by the

 
Cape of Good Hope,
 if the 
Portugueze
 shou'd once get any footing in those parts, are said to have sent those two Engineers, who were their natural born Subjects, into the 
Portugueze
 service, on purpose to go over to the 
Indians,
 to teach them the use of Great Guns, and other Fire-arms, that they might be the better able to oppose the 
Portu∣guezes.


But after this forementioned Complement of the Admiral, we hear no more of these Christians, till about the Year 1545, the 
Portuguezes
 being all that while too busie in making new Conquests, and the Friars, who were sent thither, too much employed in building and providing commodi∣ous Seats for their Convents, to attend to any fo∣reign Business, of what nature soever.


This 40 Years neglect of a Christianity, which was just under their Noses, puts me in mind of what a Minister of State said of the 
Portugueze
 Zeal in the 
Indies.


Vana es Senor (
speaking to
 Philip IV.) la Opinion que entre Nationes tudas tienen Portuguezes de Religiosos por las con∣versiones Orientales: Aquilas conquistas las Emprendio la codi∣cia, no la Religion, las conversiones se

 Hizieron por obra divina y charidad de personas religiosas par∣ticulares, el commun y direction de la co∣rona attendio a de∣predar Reynos y Ci∣dades, alli avia mas dilatados conversio∣nes a donde avia mas que hartar la co∣dicia, y alla eran hombres obstinados, donde no avia que robar, 
concluding:
 y cessa Religion quan∣do no se sique la co∣dicia, y que no en∣tran en el cielo to∣dos los, que dizen se∣nor abrid nos.




It is a vain conceit, if it please your Majesty, (
speaking to
 Philip 
IV.
) that the World has enter∣tain'd of the Zeal of the 
Portuguezes
 upon accoun
 of the Conversions that have been made by them in the 
Indies,
 for it was Cove∣tousness and not Zeal tha
 engaged them to make al

 those Conquests. The Con∣versions that have been made there were perform∣ed by the Divine Power, and the Charity of a few particular Friars, the Go∣vernment and Crown ha∣ving no other aim therein, but the robbing of King∣doms and Cities; and there were still the great∣est Conversions where there was most to gratify their Covetousness. But where there was nothing to be had, there the People were Obdurate, and not to be wrought upon. And so we see their Zeal expired quickly in all places, where it was not animated by Covetousness, and how they who had nothing else to say but, 
Lord open un∣to us,
 were not thought sit to enter into Heaven.


Manuel de Faria
 also in the Third Tome of his 
Asia Portuguesa,
 after having reckoned up the Errors (as he calls them) of the Christians of St. 
Thomas,
 makes the following Reflection

 upon his Countrymen's having been so long in reducing them to the 
Roman
 Church.


Gran lastima es oir que uviesse esto in frente de los Portu∣gueses en la India a los cien annos de su assistancia en ella; y lo que es mas a los mesmos oios de pre∣lados en Goa. La verdad es que destos eran los Mercadores que Christo hallo en el Templo y echo del açote.


It is a shameful thing 
(saith he)
 that this Church should continue an Hundred Years in the Neighbourhood of the 
Portuguezes
 without be∣ing reduced to the 
Ro∣man
 Faith, and which makes it still the worse, under the Eye of the Bi∣shops of 
Goa;
 but the truth is, those Merchants whom Christ whipp'd out of the Temple, were such as these.


Tho' after all, the 
Portuguezes
 Negligence in this matter was nothing so scandalous as the Vio∣lences they afterwards made use of in the re∣ducing of them.


In the Year 1544. the Cross and other 
Reliques
 of St. 
Thomas,
 which have since made such a Noise in the World, were found at 
Meliapor,
 the 
Legend
 whereof in short is, 
That the
 Portuguezes 
as they were pulling down an old Chappel in order to re∣build it, met with a vast Stone some Foot under∣ground, which having lifted up with great ease, they found all the Earth under it stain'd deep with Blood, that appear'd very fresh, and thereon a Cross excel∣lently

 well cut, after the fashion of that of the Mi∣litary Order of
 Aviz 
in
 Portugal, 
and over it a Dove or Peacock
 (for the learned are not agreed which 'twas) 
and above that a bloody Dagger. There was also an Inscription on the Stone, but in Letters that no Body knew what to make of. There was a Cross of the same Saint, and found much after the same manner by the
 Portuguezes 
in
 Me∣liapor 
in the Year
 1522. 
with this Inscription: 
At the time when
 Thomas 
founded this Temple, the King of
 Meliapor 
made him a Grant of the Customs of all the Merchandizes that were brought into that Port, which Duty was the Tenth part of the Goods. 
With this Cross were also found the Bones of St.
 Thomas, 
which were reckoned by all the World before to have been lodged at
 Edessa. 
There was also found an ancient Record of St.
 Thomas
's having converted the King of
 Me∣liapor (who it's like was the Prince that gave him the forementioned Grant) 
by drawing a great piece of Timber ashore, which the King and St.
 Thomas 
both pretended a right to, after all the King's Elephants, and all the Wit of Man were not able so much as to wag it. A Prophecy of St.
 Thomas 
was also found in the same Treasure, de∣claring that whenever the Sea shou'd come up to
 Meliapor, 
which was then Twelve Leagues from it, a Nation shou'd come from the West, which shou'd preach the very same Faith that he had preached.


And to put all this 
Indian
 Treasure together, for it is pity any of it should be lost, the Bones of the Three Kings were found in the same

 Grave with those of the Apostle, which were known to be theirs, by an ancient 
MS.
 which gave the following account of them. 
The King of
 Nubia 
and
 Arabia 
was
 Melchior, Baltasar 
was King of
 Goli 
and
 Saba, Gaspar 
was King of
 Tur∣si, Insula, 
and
 Grisola 
or
 Malabar, 
where the Bo∣dy of St.
 Thomas 
lieth, by whom they were all three consecrated Bishops, and were afterwards mar∣tyr'd with him.
 I leave the Examination of the truth of this 
MS.
 to the City of 
Cologne,
 whose concern it is.


Among other things there was a Copper plate found, with the following Donation engraved upon it: 
This is the Testimony of Alms, by which Paradise is acquired, and which all the following Kings, who shall distribute the said Alms, shall certainly obtain: Whereas they that shall refuse to give them, shall be Six Thousand Years with Worms in Hell.
 This Imprecation is literally used by the ancient Kings of 
Spain
 in most of their cha∣ritable Donations; but whether the 
Spanish
 Kings had it from the 
Indian,
 or the 
Indian
 from the 
Spaniard,
 is not certainly known.


In the Year 1645. 
Dom Joan Dalbuquerque
 the first Arch-Bishop of 
Goa,
 being ashamed, it's like, of their talking so much in 
Europe,
 and doing so little in 
India
 in the matters of Reli∣gion, sends one 
Vincent,
 a 
Franciscan
 Friar, of which Order the Arch-Bishop himself was, to 
Cranganor,
 to try what he could do towards the reducing of those Christians to the obedience of the 
Roman
 Church. The Labours of this

 single Friar are so strangely magnified by the 
Portuguezes,
 that it looks as if it were done on purpose to excuse their not employing of more Hands in a Work, which here in 
Europe
 they pretended was their chief Business in the 
In∣dies.
 For he is said not only to have preached daily in their Churches, which were built af∣ter the fashion of the 
Pagod
 Temples, but also to have built several Churches among them af∣ter the 
Latin
 way; and at last, by the order of the Vice-Roy and Archbishop, upon his having in∣form'd them of the small success that his preach∣ing had had among them, to have erected a College at 
Cranganor
 in the Year 1546. in order to the instructing of their Sons in the Learning and Usages of the 
Latin
 Church.


By the way, It is somewhat strange how Fri∣ar 
Vincent,
 who is not said to have had the gift of Tongues, no more than the Jesuite 
Xavier,
 who himself complained, That for want of it he was forc'd to prattle more like a Child, than preach like an Apostle among the 
Infidels,
 shou'd commence so powerful a Preacher among the 
Malabars,
 the very first Year of his being in the 
Indies;
 a Year being a very short time for a Man to make himself so far Master of a strange Language, as to be able to Preach therein to any purpose.


But tho' the Christians of St. 
Thomas
 did not deny to send their Sons to this College, several of whom, after their having been taught 
Latin,
 were Ordained Priests, according to the 
Roman


 Rites: Yet this had little or no effect as to the reducing of that Church to the Papal Obedience, to which they still continued so averse, that they treated those Natives with the same disregard that they did the other 
Latin
 Priests.


Thus matters continued with the Church of 
Malabar
 till the Year 1587. when the Jesuits i∣magining the reason why this Christianity was so little benefitted by having several of their Sons bred in the College at 
Cranganor,
 was their not being taught 
Chaldee
 or 
Syriack,
 which is the Language all their Offices are in, did thereup∣on erect a new College, which was built at the sole charge of 
Antonio Guedes Morales,
 at a place called 
Chanota,
 or 
Vaipicotta,
 a Village inha∣bited by those Christians, and which is about a League from 
Cranganor.


But notwithstanding the Jesuits, by educa∣ting several of the 
Malabars
 in the 
Chaldee
 Tongue, and instructing them thorowly in the 
Latin
 Faith, did qualify them to serve the 
Roman
 Church in her Pretensions. Yet all this signified very little, none that had been educated by them daring so much as to mutter the least Word against any of their ancient Doctrines, or in favour of the 
Roman,
 or to alter any thing in their Offices, or forbear praying for the Bishop of 
Babylon
 as their Patriarch, in the 
Mass.


Wherefore the 
Portuguezes
 finding that these Christians were not by any thing that Friars could say or do to them, to be perswaded out of their ancient Faith, or to forsake their pre∣sent

 Bishop to submit themselves to the Pope, a∣gainst whom they were so possessed, that they cou'd not endure so much as to hear him na∣med, resolved, at last, to try other methods with them, that is, to try what Violence would do, the Method to which Popery, where-ever it is, owes both its Propagation and Establishment.


And that they did not betake themselves to this course sooner, we are not to imagine was in the least owing to their temper, or to any disposition that was in them, to try first what fair and gentle means would do; for they must know nothing of the 
Spirit of Popery,
 that can imagine it to be capable of any such thing, but it was owing purely to the circumstances of their Affairs; for that before their Government had spread it self, and taken a good root in those Parts, it would not have been safe for them to have made use of those rude and boisterous Me∣thods for the reduction of these Christians, which we shall see they did afterwards, when they had in a manner gotten that whole Countrey into their own Power: In pursuance of the fore∣mentioned Resolution, the 
Portuguezes
 determi∣ned to have their Bishop, to whose presence a∣mong them they attributed their constancy in their ancient Faith, seized in order to send him to 
Rome,
 which was executed accordingly.


Their Bishop at that time (for they had but one of that Order among them) was one 
Mar Joseph,
 who, according to ancient Custom, had been sent 
er by 
Mar Audixa,
 Patriarch of

 
Babylon.
 He is acknowledged by the 
Portuguezes
 to have reformed divers Abuses in that Church, and to have put things in a much better order than he found them in. 
Mar Joseph
 being brought Prisoner from 
Cochim
 to 
Goa,
 was Em∣barked upon the first Ships that went to 
Portu∣gal,
 with an intent of sending him to 
Rome;
 but being arrived at 
Lisbon,
 he, by his Address and appearances of an extraordinary Sanctity, did so far insinuate himself into the favour and good opinion of 
Dona Caterina,
 who was Queen Regent at that time, and of the Infanta 
Dona Maria,
 that he was sent back by the next Ships to 
Goa,
 with the Queen Regents Letters, order∣ing him to be permitted to live quietly in his Bishoprick, he having promised the Cardinal Infante 
Don Anrique,
 who was at that time 
In∣quisitor-General,
 and the Pope's Legate 
à latere
 to the Crown of 
Portugal,
 to do all that was in his power towards the reducing of his Diocess to the 
Roman
 obedience.


In the Year 1552, one 
Tum Siud,
 or 
Simon Sa∣lacan,
 a Monk of the Order of St. 
Pachomius,
 who pretended to have been chose Patriarch of 
Mosul,
 or 
Seleucia Parthorum,
 or 
Babylon,
 for they are all the same by the whole Clergy of 
Persia
 and 
Assyria,
 came to 
Rome
 and submitted himself to the Pope; by whom, according to some, he was consecrated a Bishop, tho' others will have it, that he had only his Eastern Consecra∣tion confirmed, and afterwards received the 
Pa∣triarchal Pallium.
 He presented Letters and a

 Confession of Faith to the 
Pope,
 which he pre∣tended were sent by all the Eastern Bishops: In the Letters the 
Pope
's Supremacy was exalted as hig
, as if they had been writ by a Parasite Canonist; which Letters, together with the Con∣fession of Faith, were done into Latin and Prin∣ted by 
Masius:
 He gave out also, that he was attended by Seventy Persons of note as far as 
Jerusalem,
 and from thence only by Three, where∣of one died by the way, and another remained sick in the Journey; and the third, whose name was 
Calafi,
 came with him to 
Rome. Tum Siud,
 after he was dismissed at 
Rome,
 instead of re∣turning to 
Babylon,
 went and lived in an ob∣scure place called 
Charamet
 or 
Amed,
 where in a short time he was put to death by the 
Maho∣metans;
 and, as it is said, at the instigation of the 
Christians
 of those Parts, who, to the great discredit of the pretensions he had made at 
Rome,
 would never own him nor his Authority. But this ill Success did not hinder another Monk of the same Order, whose name was 
Abd Jesu
 or 
Hebed,
 who had writ several Books in defence of 
Nestorianism,
 from coming to 
Rome
 with the same pretensions, in the Year 1562; and he could ne∣ver have come in a better time, by reason of the Council of 
Trent
 being then sitting, to which he was sent with great Solemnity to represent nothing less than all the 
Chaldaean
 Bishops, having before at 
Rome
 in their Name, made the sub∣mission of that whole Church to the 
Pope:
 This method of making a noise with 
Mock-Prelates,


 had been made great use of by some former 
Popes.
 So 
Eugenius
 the IV. maintained his tot∣tering reputation against the Council of 
Basil,
 by an appearance of 
Graecians
 and 
Armenians
 in the Council of 
Florence:
 And 
Paul
 the III. gra∣ced his Translation of the Council from 
Trent
 to 
Bolongia,
 which was so stoutly opposed by the Emperor and 
Spanish
 Bishops, by sending one 
Ste∣phen
 to 
Bolognia
 with the splendid Title of the 
Armenian Patriarch.


This Humor was carried on by one 
Elias,
 who likewise pretended to be chose Patriarch of 
Ba∣bylon;
 he sent several 
Nuncio's
 to the Pope with the Submission of the 
Babylonish
 Church, and a Confession of Faith; but these 
Nuncio's
 spoiled their business by over-acting their Parts; for it having been discovered, that the better to sup∣port their Pretence of the 
Chaldaean
 Church agreeing with the Church of 
Rome
 in all things, they had tore several Pages out of their Church-Offices, they were dismissed with disgrace.


However this did not discourage 
Elias
 (as in∣deed what will a hungry Monk?) from sending one 
Adam Camara,
 his pretended Arch-Deacon, to 
Rome,
 three Years after that misfortune; who, together with his Patriarch's Letter, delivered to the Pope a Book of his own composing, con∣cerning the Reconciliation of the 
Chaldaean
 Church to the 
Roman,
 which he desired might be dili∣gently examined. In his Letter he told 
Paul
 V. 
That let Hereticks do what they will, he for his part was resolved never to go against the Holy Precepts of

 the Apostles and Orthodox Fathers, who had all af∣firmed the
 See 
of great
 Rome 
to be the Head of all other
 Sees, 
but would always confess that the
 Roman 
Church was the Mother of all the other Churches in the World, and that all that did not own her to be so, were accursed.
 It's observable, that this 
Elias
 had a stretch of Courtship beyond his begging Predecessors; which was his assuring the Pope, That all their Clergy anciently had their Orders immediately from 
Rome,
 and that that Custom continued, till several that were going to 
Rome
 on that Errand were murdered by the way; which having several times happened, the Pope when he came to hear of it, did of his free Grace say, 
Let us ordain them a Patriarch; and not only so, but permit them to chuse him, that so they may not perish thus by the way:
 And thus, said good 
Elias,
 we received all the Authority we pretend to from 
Rome,
 and not from our selves, as they pretend to do; (and the greater Wretches they) who trample upon the Canons of the Apostles, and the Laws of the Fathers. It is from this blind Story that the 
Roman
 Doctors have endea∣voured to persuade the World, that all the 
Ba∣bylonish
 Bishops do own, that they derived their Power of Ordination from the 
Western
 Fathers, meaning the Bishops of 
Rome,
 no doubt.


Now what crude Stuff is this, that those hun∣gry. Monks served up to the Pope, and was as greedily swallowed at 
Rome,
 there being not the least Colour of Truth in any part of the Story. For as to the ancient Custom that is so confident∣ly

 affirmed, it is plainly contradicted by the 33d 
Arabick
 Canon of the Council of 
Nice,
 which tho' not the genuine Canons of that Council, are yet very ancient. The Canon runs thus:

Canon 33.
 Let the See of 
Seleucia,
 which is one of the 
Eastern
 Cities, be honoured likewise, and have the Title of 
Catholicon,
 and let the Prelate thereof, ordain Arch-Bishops as the o∣ther Patriarchs do, that so the 
Eastern
 Chri∣stians who live under Heathens, may not be wronged by waiting the Patriarch of 
Antioch
's leisure, or by going to him, but may have a way opened to them to supply their own Necessities; neither will any injury be done to the Patriarch of 
Antioch
 thereby, seeing he has consented to its being thus, upon the Synod's having desired it of him.


From which Canon it is plain, That the Church of 
Seleucia
 or 
Babylon
 was anciently subject to the Patriarch of 
Antioch,
 who of all the Patriarchs was their nighest Neighbour. So that if the 
Chal∣daean
 Bishops do own that they derived all their Authority from the 
Western
 Fathers, as is pre∣tended they do, they must mean by the 
Western
 Fathers, the Bishops of 
Antioch.


And as to its being said, That the 
Chaldaean
 Bi∣shops do to this day own that they had their Or∣dinations from the 
Western
 Fathers, meaning the Bishops of 
Rome,
 the falshood of that Pretence appears evidently, not only from what has been

 said, but from the whole Tenor of the following Synod, and of all the late Reports of the 
Por∣tuguezes
 concerning that Church: As it does like∣wise, That all those Patriarchs of 
Babylon,
 who came to 
Rome,
 notwithstanding the great Noise they made in this Part of the World, were mere Impostors, never owned by the Churches they pre∣tended to be Patriarchs of. Father 
Simon
 speak∣ing of this in the 93 Page of his 
Histoire Critique,
 confesseth their magnifying the Pope's Power as they did, to have been a piece of gross Flattery, but withal, will have it to have been Pardonable in such poor Wretches, who would not other∣wise have been suffered to have approached the Pope, to whom they came into 
Europe
 on purpose to make their Court; for, as he observes upon the same occasion, few or none of the Oriental Prelates ever applied themselves to the Pope, but for the promoting of some particular Interest, which was one reason why the reunions they pre∣tended to make did not last long. But tho' for some time these 
mock Prelates
 being supported by the Pope, made a shift to keep the face of a Church at 
Charamet,
 none of them ever daring to go to 
Mosul,
 yet after a little time the true 
Chal∣daean
 Prelates obliged them to leave 
Charamet;
 from whence they retired to 
Zeinalback,
 a yet remoter Place on the borders of 
Persia,
 where from little, in a short time, they dwindled to nothing.


The Prelates of 
Babylon
 we see were anciently stiled Bishops of 
Seleucia,
 a City not far from

 
Ctesiphon;
 from whence it was that 
Simon,
 who suffered Martyrdom under 
Sapor
 is stiled Bishop of 
Seleucia
 and 
Ctesiphon,
 of which City we meet with this following Account in 
Strabo.
 Babylon 
was anciently the Metropolis of
 Assyria, 
which now
 Seleucia 
of
 Tigris 
is, near to which is a great Village called
 Ctesiphon, 
where the Kings of
 Parthia 
used to spend the Winter to spare
 Seleucia, 
that it might not be continually oppressed with Soldiers and
 Scythi∣ans: 
but notwithstanding this Change of the Metro∣polis, as the Country all about is still called
 Babylon, 
so the Natives, tho' Born in the very City of
 Seleucia, 
are still called
 Babylonians 
from the Region, and not
 Seleucians.


In the 
Bibliotheca Patrum,
 there is a Treatise of Paradise translated out of 
Syriack
 into 
Latine,
 by 
Masius,
 writ by one 
Moses Bar Cepha,
 who is stiled Bishop in 
Bethraman
 and 
Bethleno,
 and 
Cu∣rator of the Ecclesiastical Affairs of the Mozul
 or 
Seleucia Parthorum.
 This 
Moses
 flourished in the Tenth Century.


But it is time to leave these 
Sham Prelates,
 who run so fast to 
Rome
 of their own accord, and re∣turn to the true ones, who were forc'd to go thi∣ther much against their Wills.


After the Christians of the 
Serra
 had heard of their Arch-Bishop's being sent a Prisoner to 
Por∣tugal,
 despairing of ever seeing him again, they sent secretly to 
Mar Simeon,
 Patriarch of 
Baby∣lon,
 desiring him to order them a new Arch-Bi∣shop, who straightways sent them one 
Mar Abra∣ham,
 who having gotten into the 
Serra
 in a dis∣guise,

 notwithstanding the great care the 
Portu∣guezes
 had taken to have intercepted him, he was received by the whole Church as their Bi∣shop, with great joy. But he had not been long there, before he had the news of 
Mar Joseph
's being returned to 
Goa,
 where having presented the Letters he had brought along with him, he was permitted to go back to his Bishoprick.


The Arch-Bishop of 
Goa
 who had writ to 
Portugal,
 that they should by no means ever suf∣fer 
Mar Joseph
 to return to the 
Indies,
 was not without strong jealousies of his having prevari∣cated in all that he had promised; and what did very much confirm him therein, was, that 
Mar Jo∣seph
 when he desired him to take some Friars a∣long with him to preach the 
Roman
 Doctrines in his Bishoprick, did not only deny to do it, but furthermore pretended, that it was reveal'd to him the Night before, that it was no ways convenient. The Arch-Bishop being netled at this pretence, told him with great heat, That he had better Revelation from the Scriptures of his not being the Pastor whom God would have to feed his Sheep, but a Wolf in Sheep's cloathing, of whom our Saviour had said, 
That they were to be known by their Fruits,
 and that their 
Highnesses
 would quickly be sensible how much they had been imposed upon by him.


Notwithstanding all this, he was permitted to go to his Bishoprick, tho' for no other reason, its like, but to give birth to a Schism, by which means the 
Portuguezes
 hoped to be able to com∣pass

 their ends upon that Church the easier, 
Divide & impera,
 being a piece of Policy that is well understood, and has been much practi∣sed by the 
Roman
 Church. And if this was their drift in sending him back to his Diocess, they were not out in their Policy, for 
Mar Joseph
 was not sooner in the 
Serra,
 than the whole Bi∣shoprick was divided, some adhering to 
Mar A∣braham,
 and others to 
Mar Joseph,
 as their true Prelate.


But 
Mar Joseph
 finding 
Mar Abraham
's Party to be much the more numerous, by reason of the Communication he had had with the 
La∣tins,
 did thereupon betake himself to the course that all distressed People, who preferr their own Interest to that of the Publick, take, and com∣plains to the 
Portuguezes
 of 
Mar Abraham,
 not only as an Usurper, but as a most bitter Enemy to the 
Roman
 Church.


The 
Viceroy,
 who was glad of this occasion, straightways dispatch'd an Order to the Governour of 
Cochim,
 to have 
Mar Abraham
 apprehended, and to send him Prisoner to 
Goa,
 in order to send him to 
Rome,
 which was executed accor∣dingly. But the Ship whereon 
Mar Abraham
 was Embarked, being forced by stress of Weather into 
Mazambique,
 a Port belonging to the 
Portu∣guezes
 in the Southern Coasts of 
Africk,
 he made a shift to escape, and by the way of 
Melindo
 and 
Ormus,
 to get to the Patriarch of 
Babylon,
 from whom having received new Briefs to Fortifie his Title, he resolved to return to his Bishoprick;

 but having afterwards considered better on the matter, and being sensible, that if he went thi∣ther without the 
Pope
's Order, that the 
Portuguezes
 would quickly make the Serra too hot for him, he altered his Mind, and resolved to try his For∣tune at 
Rome,
 and to take a Journey thither over Land; being come to 
Rome,
 after having abju∣red his ancient Faith, and reconciled himself to the Church, and promised to reduce that of 
Ma∣labar
 to its obedience, he obtained of 
Pius
 the Fourth, all such 
Briefs
 as were any ways neces∣sary, having also the Title of 
Arch-Bishop,
 which he and his Predecessors had enjoyed, given him therein.


But being at 
Venice,
 in his way home, the Di∣vines there discovering, as it is said, both from the Nature of the Opinions that he had abjured, and from his own Confession, that he had never been lawfully Ordained, did oblige him to re∣ceive all 
Orders,
 from the 
first tonsure
 to the 
Priesthood.
 He was ordained 
Priest
 by the Bi∣shop of 
St. Salvador
 and Consecrated a 
Bishop
 by the Patriarch of 
Venice.


This 
Venetian
 Consecration, if it is not a down∣right 
Naggs-Head
 Story, is a Scurvy reflection upon the 
Pope
's Infallibility, who herein was not only deceived in a 
matter of Fact,
 in giving 
Briefs
 to one, as an Arch-Bishop, who really was not at all in 
Holy Orders,
 but he must also have been deceived in a 
matter of Doctrine,
 in being Igno∣rant, that some of the Opinions which had been Abjured before him by 
Mar Abraham,
 were of

 such a nature as to incapacitate him for 
Orders.


While 
Mar Abraham
 was in this Voyage, 
Mar Joseph
 finding himself in the quiet Possession of his whole Bishoprick, did not forbear to profess and teach the Doctrines he had abjured in 
Portu∣gal.
 The Bishop of 
Cochim,
 who was his next Neighbour, having heard thereof, acquainted the Arch-Bishop of 
Goa
 therewith, and he 
Don Anrique,
 the Cardinal Infante, who at that time Governed 
Portugal
 in the Minority of his Nephew 
Don Sebastian,
 and the Cardinal informed the Pope of the whole matter.


These repeated Tyrannies of the 
Portuguezes
 in the 
Indies,
 of dragging ancient Bishops thus out of their own Country and Diocess, and tumbling them so about the World, I cannot but reckon among those violent Injustices for which 
Manuel de Faria
 in the very last words of his 
Asia Portu∣guesa,
 tells us, God has punished them so visibly. The observation is so remarkable, and to this day so litterally true, as I have been told by several intelligent 
Portuguezes,
 that I shall set it down in the Author's own words. 
Ponderacion muy notable ay en esto, y es, que dequanta persona passaran a la India ya como Governadores, ya como Capitanes, ya como Mercadores, aunque esto ultimo siempre fue de todos: y de quantos destos alcançaran groessissimas haziendas, no se¦ve oy in el Reyno de Portugal ninguna casa o Mayo razgo que se fundasse con ellas, o lo me∣nos que sea cosa de importancia: ni tam poco ay en la India alguna casa grande desta calidad:

 aunque tambien aya avido allá Portugueses q iuntaron mucho y uvo algunos de a million, y de dos milliones y de a tres, y a un de a quatro, ye'l no luzirse a nadie considerablemente tanta hazien∣da como tantos iuntaron, se hade entendar, que fue, y es, y sera pero por una de dos razones, o por ambas, la primera porq' permetiendo Dios este viaie solo para dilatar su nombre, y verdedero culto, estos navigantes trataron por la mayor parte de lo material de la sacrilega codicia, co∣metiendo muchas maldades, para hartarse, en vez de tractar de la religion: y otra porq' lo mas desto fue ganado por medios injustos de ti∣ranias, robos, y toda suerte de insolencia, como consta de muchos lugares destas Historias.
 
It is remarkable, that among all the Persons who have gone to the 
Indies,
 whether as Governours, Captains, or Merchants, of which sort most of them were in truth, there has not been one that has raised a Fa∣mily of any consideration out of the Goods they have got in those Parts, either there or in 
Portugal,
 tho' there have been several of them that have got there, one, two, three, or four Millions. Now, that no∣thing that's considerable of all these vast Treasures, should any where appear, must be for one or both of these two Reasons, first, that whereas God permitted the Discovery of this Voyage, only for the propogation of his Name, and true Worship 
(but not by such barbarous Methods as the forementioned I dare say)
 these Travellers have, for the most part, pursued the ends of a Sacrilegious Covetousness, committing many Injustices to fill their Coffers, instead of having

 any regard to Religion; the other is, because the most of those Riches were gained by the unjust means of Tyrannies, Robberies, and all sort of Insolencies, of which you have many Instances in the foregoing Hi∣story.


Pius
 V. upon this Issued forth a 
Brief,
 bear∣ing date the 15th. of 
January
 1567. directing it to 
Dom Jorge,
 Arch-Bishop of 
Goa,
 and com∣manding him to use all diligence to have 
Mar Joseph
 forthwith Apprehended and sent to 
Rome,
 in pursuance whereof he was seized, and sent Prisoner to 
Portugal,
 upon the first Ships that went, whence he was carried to 
Rome,
 where he died.


Neither were the Violences they made use of to Convert 
Infidels,
 any whit inferior to those they exercised upon the poor 
Chaldaean
 Christians, by which they came to provoke the 
Infidel
 Princes to that degree, that they had like to have lost all that they had in the 
Indies
 by it. For the 
Hidal∣caon
 who Besieged 
Goa
 in the Year 1570. both in his Letters to the Viceroy 
Don Luis d' Ataide,
 and in the Speech he made to his Captains, when he first communicated to them his design of dri∣ving the 
Portuguezes
 out of the 
Indies,
 gave those Violences for the chief cause of his War. Those Letters and Speech being too long to be here Inserted, I shall only set down so much of them as relates directly to this matter.


In his first Letter to the 
Viceroy,
 after having complained of some other Grievances, he tells him, 
That he was certainly informed that at
 Ormus,

 Dio, Chaul, 
and all the other
 Portugueze 
Ports, his Subjects Ships were all strictly searched, and all the Boys and Girls that were found Aboard, of what∣soever Quality,
 Abyssnes 
or
 Mahometans, 
were forcibly carried ashoar, and there detained from their Parents or Masters. This,
 saith he, 
is a matter that I cannot but be extreamly offended with; neither can I judge otherwise of your permitting such Violences, but that you have a mind to break with me, for if you had not I cannot be perswaded that your People durst presume to commit such Insolencies:
 He goes on. 
Let it suffice that no difference can happen be∣tween us, but what gives me great displeasure, and that I am both a Brother and an Allie of the King of
 Portugal, 
and do esteem you as my particular Friend, to put a stop to this matter, that so my Subjects may have no further cause to complain thereof. Besides, I am confident the King of
 Portugal 
will not thank any, that shall be instrumental in making a Breach between me and him, by compelling my Subjects thus against their Wills to turn Christians, a practice,
 saith he, 
that's abominable in the sight of all the World; nay, I am confident that
 Jesus Christ 
himself, the God whom you adore, cannot be well pleased with such Service as this: Force and Compulsion in all such Cases, being what God, Kings, and all the People of the World do abominate. The work of turning People from one Religion to another, if it be not done by the Divine Inspiration, and the immediate Will of God can ne∣ver be sincere, neither can
 Converts 
have any in∣ward respect for a Religion, which they are com∣pelled to Profess. I do thetefore intreat you to see

 that this matter be speedily redressed, but especially that of taking Peoples Children from them by violence, which is a thing I stand amazed at, and am in duty bound to see remedied.


In his second Letter he thanks the 
Viceroy
 for an Order he had sent to 
Ormus,
 and the other 
Portugueze
 Ports, prohibiting all such Violences, but at the same time tells him, 
That his Order was not in the least regarded; for that the
 Portuguezes 
notwithstanding it, went on still in their former Courses,
 to which he tells him, 
If there were not a speedy and effectual stop put, it must necessarily be∣get a War betwixt him and the
 Portuguezes; adding, 
That as he knew that neither God, nor wise Kings, took any delight in Discords, so he was certain that there was no Religion in the World, that justified the forcing of People from one Religion to ano∣ther.


And in his Speech to his Captains he tells them, 
The
 Portuguezes 
at first came among us, under the notion of Merchants, promising to help us to several Goods that we wanted, but that afterwards by making of trifling Presents to some weak Princes and other Arts, they had obtained leave to build Store-Houses for their Wares upon the Coast; but that instead of Ware-Houses, they had built Fortresses, by which means they had strengthned themselves so in
 India, 
both by Sea and Land, that it was more than time for the Natives to look about them, and to join to∣gether to extirpate such cruel Tyrants and Ravagers of so many Kingdoms, and Enemies to the general quiet and commerce of the World; and that for one

 thing especially, which was what no patience was able to endure, their compelling the
 Indians 
in all places, where they had Power, to change their Religion.


In this Affair the 
Christian
 and 
Mahometan,
 of which Sect this 
Hidalcaon
 was, seem to have changed Parts, the 
Mahometan
 writing therein like a 
Christian,
 and the 
Christians
 behaving them∣selves like 
Mahometans.


Pudet haec opprobria nobis


Vel dici potuisse.


About this time the 
Dominican Friars,
 under pretence of building a Convent, built a Fortress at 
Solor,
 into which, as soon as it was finished, the 
Viceroy
 put a strong Garrison: There were perpetual Bickerings betwixt this Garrison and the Natives, in most of which, some of the 
Friars,
 as they were Converting those 
Infidels,
 with Swords in their hands, suffered Martyrdom.


We read of a famous 
Portugueze Missionary
 about this time, it was one 
Fernando Vinagre,
 who, tho' a Secular Priest, Commanded the Squadron that was sent to the assistance of the King of 
Ti∣dore;
 in which occasion he is said to have be∣haved himself both like a great Captain, and a great Apostle, and to have appeared one day in 
Armour,
 and another in a 
Surplice,
 and to have Baptized several in his Armour, with his 
Surplice
 over it. In these 
a la Dragoon
 Conversions, he was seconded by his Admiral 
Antonio Galvam,
 who with the assistance of Captain 
Francisco de

 Castro,
 is said to have Converted five Kings in the Island of 
Mazacar;
 and tho' he was really no other than a 
St. Ruth,
 yet he is said by the 
Portugueze
 Historians to be another 
St. Paul,
 in Governing all that came under his Power both with his Sword and with his Voice, 
A Sword and Voice,
 say they, 
worthy of a glorious Eternity.
 It was this 
Antonio
 that first discovered the King of 
Portugal
's special Title to the 
Clove,
 which, for having five Points, he said, had the King of 
Portugal
's Arms, which are the five Wounds of Christ stamp'd upon it.


The same Author tells us, and approves of what an 
Indian
 said of the 
Portuguezes,
 when in the height of their Triumphs: 
Let them alone,
 said the 
Indian, for they will quickly come to lose that as Covetous Merchants, which they have gained as admirable Soldiers; they now Conquer
 Asia, 
but it will not be long before
 Asia 
will Conquer them.


The Emperor of 
Persia
 is reported by the same Author to have made the same Prediction, who being told by the 
Portugueze
 Ambassador, when he asked him how many of the Governours of the 
Indies
 Heads his Master had chopped off, that he had not taken off one, replied, 
If that is true, it is not possible the
 Portuguezes 
should hold the
 Indies 
long.


About this time the 
Portuguezes
 were driven out of the Island of 
Ito
 by the 
Natives.
 They were stirred up to do it by a Speech made by one 
Gemulio,
 a considerable 
Native,
 wherein he told the 
Portuguezes
 in a full Assembly of them, 
That if they Preached to others that there was a God

 in Heaven, who observed all that was done on Earth, and would certainly Reward all Good, and Punish all Evil-Deeds, without believing it themselves, or without practising what they believed, they were cer∣tainly guilty of the Abomination, which such a God must detest above all others:
 He likewise told them, 
They were Strangers come from the very Skirts of the World, and will you,
 saith he, 
who are the Off∣spring of the Shades, which the Sun leaves when it goes down, presume to Tyrannize over us, who enter∣tained you so kindly, and have been so long a San∣ctuary to you? If these be the Customs of your Coun∣try, you must know they are what we Abominate; return, return therefore to your native darkness, or your ancient Habitations, where the want of Light will hide your Actions, and do you not come hither to commit them in the very apple of the Eye of the Sun, as it riseth out of his brightest Cradle. You preach
 Christ Crucified 
to us, and at the same time Crucifie those you have perswaded to believe in him. You will make others to be
 Christians, 
without ap∣pearing to be such your selves. You must know we are not ignorant of what you have done to the King of
 Xael, 
and how you rewarded his great kindness and Civility to you, with Violences and Outrages, and his Subjects good turns with dishonouring their Wives: We know likewise how you have used the Queen of
 Aram, 
whom, after she had lost both her Kingdom and Husband to secure you, you have dishonourably thrown off, as one who could be of no further use to you. Be gone therefore immediately out of this Island, and hereafter don't you presume to

 set your Foot, or so much as cast your Eye upon it.
 The Historian who relates this, tho' a 
Portugueze,
 makes this reflection upon it, 
Thus we lose Places by our Insolencies, which we gained by our Valour.


When 
Mar Abraham
 returned to 
Goa
 over Land, by the way of 
Ormus,
 and found 
Mar Joseph
 Shipped off for 
Portugal,
 thereupon he flattered himself with the hopes of meeting with nothing to molest him in the Possession of his Bishoprick; but he quickly found himself decei∣ved, for having presented the Pope's 
Briefs,
 and other Papers he brought along with him to the Arch-Bishop, the 
Portuguezes
 not having the same reason to permit him to return to the 
Serra,
 as they had when they permitted 
Mar Joseph,
 which, as I have observed, was done on purpose to give rise to a Schism, he was told, that before they would put him in Possession of his Bishoprick, they must first have both the 
Briefs
 and his 
Infor∣mations
 strictly examined, that so they might be satisfied he had not imposed upon his 
Holiness.


Wherefore, tho' resolved whatever came on't, never to let 
Mar Abraham
 go out of their hands, yet that they might not seem to refuse to pay a due respect to the 
Pope's Briefs;
 the Arch-Bishop and others, after having examined all his Papers, found several flaws in them, which were declared to be sufficient to justifie their detaining of him: This is no more than what the 
Canonists
 can do, and do daily in the clearest cases, it being impos∣sible to have any Matrimonial or other cause drawn up, or worded so accurately, that the 
Canonists,


 and especially if the Pope desire it, will not find several Nullities in. Upon the publication of the nullity of the 
Pope
's 
Briefs,
 as having been obtained by misinformation, poor 
Mar Abraham,
 instead of being sent back in Triumph to his Bishoprick, as he expected, was, after all the Pains he had been at, confined to the 
Dominican
 Convent at 
Goa,
 there to remain till such time as the 
Pope
's Answer came to the 
Arch-Bishop
's In∣formation of his Case.


Mar Abraham,
 being sensible that to be con∣fined till that came, was the same thing as to be condemned to be a Prisoner for Life, resolved, let what would be the Issue, to try to make his escape, which, after several unsuccessful Attempts, he did, at last, upon an 
Holy Thursday
 at Night, while the 
Friars
 were all imployed in the Chapel, and having gotten over to the Continent, he posted away to 
Malabar,
 where he was received with great Joy and Festivity by all the Christians, who having two of their Arch-Bishops Prisoners among the 
Portuguezes,
 despaired of ever seeing another 
Babylonish
 Bishop among them.


The 
Viceroy
 and 
Arch-Bishop
 were much trou∣bled at 
Mar Abraham
's having made his escape thus, and writ straightways to the Bishop of 
Cochim,
 and all the Governours upon the Coast of 
Mala∣bar,
 to have him apprehended if he was above Ground; but 
Mar Abraham
 knowing how it would be, took care to keep himself, as far as he could, out of their reach, never adventuring to visit any of the Churches that were in the Neigh∣bourhood

 of 
Cochim,
 or of any other 
Portugueze
 Garrison.


But tho' after this 
Mar Abraham
 is said, in all his Letters to the 
Portuguezes
 to have still profes∣sed himself a 
Romanist,
 and not only so, but to have re-ordained all that had been ordained by him formerly; yet it is certain, that in all things else he acted quite otherwise in his Diocess, where he continued not only to preach his old 
Doctrines,
 but in his Prayers still named the Bi∣shop of 
Babylon
 as his Patriarch.


Gregory
 XIII. being informed of this by the 
Arch-Bishop
 of 
Goa,
 and other Prelates of the 
Indies,
 issued forth a 
Brief,
 bearing date the 28th. of 
November,
 1578. directing it to 
Mar Abraham,
 and commanding him therein to re∣pair to the next Provincial Council that should be Assembled at 
Goa,
 to assist at it, and to ob∣serve all the Decrees that should be made therein, relating to his Bishoprick, and that he might not excuse his not obeying this 
Brief,
 by pretending that he could not do it with safety; the 
Pope
 like∣wise sent him 
Letters of safe Conduct,
 to go and come without being any ways molested.


In pursuance whereof 
Dom Vicente da Fonseca,
 a 
Friar,
 of the Order of 
St. Dominick,
 and 
Arch-Bishop of Goa,
 having called a Provincial Council, which was the third of 
Goa,
 ordered the forementioned 
Brief
 to be intimated to 
Mar Abraham,
 and together with the 
Pope
's, his own, and the Viceroy's 
Letters of safe Conduct,
 to be sent to him.




Mar Abraham,
 having well considered the matter, and perceiving how difficult it would be for him to escape being Dragoon'd by the 
Portuguezes,
 whose power increased daily in those Parts, if he should disobey this Summons, deter∣mined, whatever came on it, to repair to the Council, at which he assisted, and was obliged once more to Abjure, and make a profession of the 
Roman
 Faith, promising withal, to see all the Decrees made in that 
Synod,
 in relation to his Bishoprick, punctually executed, and to send in all the Heretick Books in his Diocess to be burn∣ed or amended; and having confessed, that in 
the Ordination of Priests
 there was no Wine in the Cup, which he delivered into their hands, toge∣ther with the Host, he was commanded to Or∣dain all that he had Ordained before over-again.


Now if this, of there being no Wine in the Cup, which was delivered into the hands of those who were Ordained 
Priests,
 was the only ground whereon the 
Romanists
 founded the in∣validity of the 
Chaldaean
 Orders, as it is the only thing they have been pleased to instance in, what a stretch was this to invalidate the Orders of a whole Church by? But for 
Canonists
 and 
School∣men
 by Subtilties invented on purpose to support a late Error, or to serve a present turn, to wound Christianity in its very Vitals, is a practice too common to be wondred at. I am sure the Church of 
Rome
 has much more reason to apprehend that the Sacrilege of denying the Cup to the Laity

 in the Sacrament, may make her Communion im∣perfect and ineffectual, than that this alone should make Ordinations so.


But after all this stir, the Doctrine of the deli∣vering the Bread and Cup into the hands of those who are to be ordained Priests, being es∣sential to Orders, is so far from being true, that it is owned to be a Novelty by all the Modern Learned Divines of the Church of 
Rome,
 and is moreover contradicted by her daily Practice, who, as all the World knows, allows the 
Greek Orders
 to be good, in the Collation whereof she knows, the Bread and Cup is not put into the hands of those who are ordained Priests.


It is true, the Council of 
Florence,
 in her In∣structions to the 
Armenians,
 seems to have doted into the same Error with this of the 
Portuguezes,
 in making that new Ceremony essential to 
Orders.
 But let that be as it will, it is certain that both the present practice of the 
Roman
 Church, and all her truly Learned 
Sons,
 the Modern 
Schoolmen
 not excepted, do condemn it as an Error; for which I shall only quote two of her most emi∣nent Schoolmen, and one of her ablest Criticks.


Cardinal 
Lugo,
 in his 2 Disp. 
de Sacramentis,
 saith as followeth, 
Aliunde autem habemus, non porrectionem panis & vini determinatè requiri ex divinâ institutione, cum Graeci absque illâ porrecti∣one ordinentur; ergo fatendum est Christum solum voluisse pro materiâ aliquod signum proportionatum hoc vel illud.




And 
Becanus,
 in the third part of his Scho∣lastical Divinity, 
Chap.
 26. of the Sacrament of Order, has as follows: 
Concilium Florentinum in instructione Armenorum solum meminit materiae acci∣dentalis, quae ab Ecclesiâ fuit instituta,
 which was the delivering of the Bread and Cup, 
non autem substantialis, quam Christus praescripsit,
 which is the imposition of hands, 
Quia haec ex Scripturis & antiquis Patribus erat satis cognita, non autem illa. Addo, si hoc argumentum valeret, posse optimè retor∣queri ita, Antiqua concilia non assignant aliam ma∣teriam nisi impositionem manuum, ergo,
 &c. He con∣cludes thus, 
Nota antiqua concilia assignâsse mate∣riam à Christo institutam, Florentinum verò mate∣am assignâsse, quam Ecclesia introduxit,
 that is the 
Latin
 only. By this one may see, that the Church of 
Rome
 is not so uniform a Body as she pretends to be, being thus inconsistent with her self in a thing of so high a nature, as that, 
of what is,
 and 
what is not essential to Orders:
 and we my see likewise, how she will break thorow all ancient Doctrines and Rules, rather than not disgrace all Bodies of Christians, which deny her Obedience, by unchurching them by some subtilty or other; and indeed, thorow the clearest evidences of matter of Fact, as she does in the case of the Or∣ders of the 
Church of England.
 And further∣more, how apt she is to look upon her own novel Inventions as the main Substantials of Re∣ligion.


To whom I shall only add 
Morinus,
 whose judgment in a case of this nature is of more

 weight, than that of the whole Tribe of School∣men. Who in the 1 
Chap.
 of his first Exercitati∣on, 
De Sacris Ordinationibus,
 saith, 
Nemo, ut mi∣hi videtur, dubitare potest, antiquos Latinos, à quibus accepimus & Ordinationes, & quod sacerdo∣tes sumus, legitimè & validè sacerdotes consecrasse, & caetera sacrarum Ordinationum munia contulisse: Eadem antiquorum Graecorum ratio. Certissimum enim est & evidentissimum, neminem Ordinationes Graecas criminari posse, quin crimen in Latinas re∣dundet, cum utrique mutuo alterius Ordinationes pro∣baverint: Graecusque apud Latinos, & Latinus a∣pud Graecos sine ullâ unquam Ordinationis querelâ sacra Mysteria celebraverit: pari veritatis evidentia certum est recentiores Latinos in hunc usque diem le∣gitimas Ordinationes celebrasse & celebrare, eadem ratio hodiernorum Graecorum, cum ut ex iis quae manifestissimè
 
 
quadam demonstrata sunt, ab antiquis non differant, eosque publicè in suis Or∣dinibus ministrantes suscipiat Ecclesia Romana, sem∣perque susceperit.
 And in his seventh Exercitati∣on, speaking of the delivering the Bread and Cup into the hands of those that are ordained Priests, he acknowledgeth it to be a late Cere∣mony in the 
Roman
 Church. 
Antiqui Rituales Latini, non secus ac Graeci, istam instrumentorum traditionem nobis non exhibent: Quidquid specta
 ad illam materiam & formam ab iis abest. Du
 ritus Ordinationis editi, unus Romae in sancti Gre∣gorii sacramentario ex Bibliotheca Vaticanâ, alter Pa¦risiis ab Hugone Mainardo, ex Bibliothecâ Corbeiens
 ista omnia nobis non repraesentant duo antiquissim

 Petaviani literis uncialibus scripti qui prae caeteris eminent, duo alii secundum istos antiquissimi & egregiè splendidéque scripti, qui ampli sunt, & multa Ordinationibus illis exhibent, quae videri possunt non necessaria, quorum unus est Rotomagensis, alter Rhemensis. Tres alii, quorum primus Senonensis est, duo alii Corbeienses, unus à Rodrado scriptus, nunc vertitur annus octogentesimus primus, alter a Rotaldo praecedente multo junior, sed copiosissimus, qui quaecunque noverat ad Ordinationes pertinere, iis ditavit Sacramentarium suum; denique unus è Bib∣liothecâ Thuanâ perantiquus, & alter Bellovacensis.
 In all which ancient 
Rituals,
 he saith, there is a profound silence of this Ceremony.


The Council being ended, 
Mar Abraham
 re∣turned to his Bishoprick, where he observed no∣thing of what he had promised and swore, save that of ordaining his Priests again the third time, at which Ordinations there were several 
Jesuites,
 who were skilled in the 
Syriack
 Tongue, that as∣sisted to see that nothing was omitted that was essential.


Not long after a Letter of 
Mar Abraham
 to the Patriarch of 
Babylon
 was intercepted, wherein he informed him of his having been at a Council of the Bishops of the 
Indies
 at 
Goa,
 whither he had gone purely out of fear of the 
Portuguezes, who,
 he said, 
were over his Head, is a Hammer over an Anvil:
 but when he was there, that he had delivered in a Profession of his Faith, which none of the 
Latin
 Bishops were able to contradict, professing

 himself to his Patriarch a Dogmatist of the 
Chal∣daean
 Faith.


Mar Abraham
 being grown ancient and very much broke, by the long and unintermitting Per∣secutions of the 
Portuguezes,
 was willing to have a 
Coadjutor
 from 
Babylon,
 who might, after his Death, also succeed him in his Bishoprick, and accordingly had one 
Mar Simeon
 sent to him by the Patriarch of 
Babylon.


Mar Simeon
 was no sooner fixed in the 
Serra,
 but, finding the People, by reason of his never having had anything to do with the 
Latins,
 to have a much greater Affection for him than they had for 
Mar Abraham,
 who, tho' to his Sorrow, had been so much among them, he was encouraged to set up for sole Bishop, and having fixed his 
See
 at 
Carturte,
 one of the principal Towns of the Christians of St. 
Thomas,
 was much favoured by the Queen of 
Pimenta,
 in whose Territories 
Car∣turte
 is.


These two Bishops fell presently to fulminate their Excommunications one against another, to the great disturbance of the whole Diocess, and 
Mar Abraham
 finding his Adversary to gain ground of him daily, complains of him to the Viceroy and Arch-Bishop of 
Goa,
 desiring them to drive 
Mar Simeon
 out of the 
Serra,
 who was not only an Intruder, but a bitter Enemy to the 
Latin
 Faith.


The Viceroy, tho' he had no great kindness for 
Mar Abraham,
 yet considering that he wa
 Bishop of the 
Serra,
 by the Pope's appointment


 resolved, if it were possible, to ease him of his Adversary, and understanding that it would be a difficult thing for him to get 
Mar Simeon
 into his hands by open force, he employed some 
Fran∣ciscan
 Friars to inveigle him with fair promises to go to 
Rome,
 and get the Pope's 
Brief
 for the Bi∣shoprick, without which he could never expect to enjoy it peaceably.


Mar Simeon
 having first constituted one 
Jacob,
 a Parish Priest his 
Vicar General
 during his Ab∣sence, was perswaded by the Friars to go along with them to 
Cochim,
 from whence he was sent to 
Goa,
 and from 
Goa
 upon the first Ships to 
Por∣tugal,
 and from thence to 
Rome,
 where, after having been examined by the 
Inquisition,
 he was declared by Pope 
Sixtus
 V. not to be in Holy Orders, and was with that Sentence upon him sent by the Cardinal St. 
Severiana
 to 
Philip
 the Second, who put him into the hands of 
Dom Aleixo de Menezes,
 whom he was then sending to 
Goa,
 to be Arch-Bishop of that place.


Arch-Bishop 
Menezes,
 instead of carrying him along with him to the 
Indies,
 which was what 
Mar Simeon
 expected, confined him to a 
Franciscan
 Convent in 
Lisbon,
 from whence he is said to have wrote Letters by every Fleet, that went to the 
Indies
 to his Vicar-General 
Jacob,
 and in all his Letters to have still stiled himself 
Metropolitan of the Indies,
 and to have profess'd the 
Chaldaean
 Doctrines; these Letters were found by Arch-Bishop 
Menezes
 in the 
Serra,
 when he visited it, by whom they were sent to the chief Tribunal of

 the General 
Inquisition
 of 
Portugal,
 where if they found 
Mar Simeon
 alive, they doubtless made him change his 
Franciscan
 Prison for that of the 
Inquisition,
 where they would take care he should write no more such Letters.


Dom Matthias,
 Arch-Bishop of 
Goa,
 having in the Year 1590. called another Provincial Coun∣cil, did, in conformity to 
Gregory
 XIII's 
Brief,
 Summon 
Mar Abraham
 to repair to it, who being sensible how ill he had complied with what he promised in the former Council, returned no o∣ther Answer to the Summons, but a Saying, which, he said, was a Proverb in his Country, 
That the Cat that bites a Snake is afraid of her Cord,
 inti∣mating thereby, that he durst not trust the 
Por∣tuguezes
 and 
Latin
 Bishops any more: After which he dissembled no longer, but in all things declared himself to be of the 
Chaldaean
 Faith.


Clement
 VIII. being informed of all this, di∣spatched a 
Brief,
 bearing date the 27th. of 
January
 1595. wherein he Commanded 
Dom Aleixo de Menezes,
 Arch-Bishop of 
Goa
 to make Inquisi∣tion into the Crimes and Errors of 
Mar Abraham,
 and in case he found him guilty of such things as he had been accused of, to have him apprehended and secured in 
Goa,
 as also to appoint a Gover∣nour or 
Vicar-Apostolical
 of the 
Roman
 Communi∣on over his Bishoprick, and upon 
Mar Abraham
's Death to take care that no Bishop coming from 
Babylon
 should be suffered to enter into the 
Serra
 to succeed.




This Brief was delivered to the Arch-Bishop before he went to the 
Indies,
 by virtue whereof, and in obedience to the Pope's Commands, he made Inquisition into the Crimes and Errors of 
Mar Abraham,
 and finding him guilty of all that he had been accused of, he sent him his Process without Summoning him to appear at 
Goa,
 by reason of his having been Bed-rid for some time.


The Arch-Bishop furthermore understanding by the Informations he had taken, that 
Mar A∣braham,
 in conjunction with all the Christians of his Diocess, had sent to the Patriarch of 
Babylon
 for another 
Coadjutor,
 Commanded those of 
Ormus
 and of all other places that lay in the way, under grievous Censures, to stop all 
Chaldaean, Persian,
 or 
Armenian
 Ecclesiasticks that should come to∣wards the 
Indies
 without his Pass. This Order was so punctually executed, that one who came to 
Ormus
 with the Title of the Arch-Bishop of the 
Serra,
 was discovered in a disguise, and sent home again. There were several others of those Priests and Bishops who attempted to get into the 
Serra
 in the Habit of Mariners, were stopt, to the great Grief of the Christians of St. 
Thomas,
 who, the more they saw their Clergy Persecuted, re∣spected them the more, and grew every day more zealous for their ancient Doctrines and Rites.


The Arch-Bishop being much encouraged by the Success of this diligence, laid the matter of the reduction of this Church to the obedience of the 
Roman,
 much more to Heart than any of his

 Predecessors had ever done. The first he applied himself to was 
Jacob,
 whom 
Mar Simeon
 had left his 
Vicar General,
 to whom he writ a long Letter, passionately entreating him to throw away the Commission he had from 
Mar Simeon,
 who was Convicted at 
Rome
 of not being in Holy Orders, and to submit himself to the 
Papal Authority;
 making him large Promises of what he would do for him, if he complied with his desires. But 
Jacob,
 who died presently after, was deaf to all the Arch-Bishop could say to him, making it his whole business to enflame his Flock against the 
Latins,
 and their Doctrines.


The Arch-Bishop did not neglect at the same time to write earnestly to 
Mar Abraham,
 as also to the 
Arch-Deacon,
 who is the only 
Dignitary
 in that Church under the Bishop, and who is employed by him as his 
Vicar General,
 calling upon them to purge their Diocess of the Errors wherewith it had been so long infected, and to reduce it to the 
Roman
 Obedience.


St. 
Francis,
 about this time, destroyed a whole Fleet of 
Jores
 to the 
Portugueze,
 who, tho' he was not seen by any of the 
Portuguezes
 in the Fight, which was very bloody on both sides, yet a Cook who belonged to a 
Capuchin
 Convent not far off, having hid himself in the Ruines of their Church, saw a Friar in his own Habit Board the Fleet of 
Jores,
 one after another, whom he so terrified with his very look, as to put them all to flight immediately, and pursued them out of sight: This formidable Friar was afterwards

 discovered to be St. 
Francis;
 but tho' the Histo∣rian has not been pleased to tell us how it came to be known certainly, he tells us it was an Acti∣on very proper for St. 
Francis,
 who was the lively Image of 
Christ,
 to appear thus and con∣found the Enemies of 
Christianity,
 by saying, 
It is I.
 Now, if this Story did not rebuild the 
Capuc
 
uined Church, the 
Portuguezes
 were not s
 
atef
 
 they use to be in such cases. But 
 was 
ing to what their own St. 
An∣thony
 did for them five or six Years afterwards in a Land Battle, wherein he was seen by several, where the greatest fury of the Battle was, Mow∣ing down whole Squadrons of the Enemy, and at the same time extinguishing the Fire of the E∣nemies Artillery with the Sleeve of his Sacred Habit. There were several 
Portuguezes,
 its true, fell in this Fight, but they must have been killed by something else than Fire-Arms, or at least than Cannon.


In the Year 1584. there came a famous 
Ama∣zon
 to 
Goa,
 who had been drove out of her Country by the 
Hidalcaon;
 her name was 
Abehi;
 she had Fought in several Battles to admiration; and tho' when she came to 
Goa,
 she was 62 years of Age, she is reported to have had a great deal of Wit, and the ruines of an exquisite Beauty; she pretended to have business of great moment to communicate to the Viceroy, but the Inqui∣sition, no body knew why, put a stop to the Ne∣gotiation; which, after having kept her Pri∣soner for some time, banished her to 
Ormus,


 from whence having made her escape, she went to the Great 
Mogul
's Court.


In the Year 1593. the Bull of 
Cruzada
 was first brought into the 
Indies
 by 
Francisco Faria,
 a 
Dominican
 Friar; and indeed considering how great a Revenue that Bull is to the Pope in 
Spain
 and 
Portugal,
 it is very much that it did not find its way into the 
Indies
 sooner.


When the Arch-Bishop was visiting the City of 
Damaon,
 he received Letters of the 16th. of 
Feb.
 1597. from the Viceroy 
Matthias Dalbuquer∣que,
 advising him of the Death of 
Mar Abra∣ham.
 On the same day he received this news, he in obedience to the Pope's 
Brief,
 constituted 
Francisco Roz,
 a 
Jesuite,
 and who was afterwards made Bishop of the 
Serra,
 Governour and 
Vicar-Apostolical
 of the said Diocess.


The 
May
 following the Arch-Bishop being re∣turned to 
Goa,
 a Consultation was held about the Affairs of the Church of the 
Serra,
 where it was unanimously agreed; that notwithstanding the Pope in his 
Brief
 had commanded none to be made Governour or 
Vicar Apostolical
 of the Diocess, but what was of the 
Roman
 Communi∣on, it was convenient to nominate the present Arch-Deacon to it, which they did, joining 
Francisco Roz,
 and the 
Rector
 of the 
Jesuites
-College of 
Vaipicotta,
 in Commission with him. But it being required of the Arch-Deacon, that he shou'd subscribe the Profession of Faith made by 
Pius
 IV. before he had his Patent he decli∣ned doing it, pretending he was not satisfied

 with having two joyned with him in Com∣mission.


The Arch-Bishop, tho' he was sensible that it was the Subscription that stuck with him chiefly, thought fit to dissemble, so far as to seem to be∣lieve him, and by a new Patent constituted him the sole Governour of the Bishoprick.


The Arch-Deacon accepted of this Patent, but at the same time declared, That it gave him no Authority but what he had before; but when he was called upon to Subscribe the forementi∣oned Profession of Faith, he desired four Months to consider of it, hoping by that time a Bishop might be sent them by the Patriarch of 
Babylon,
 when the four Months were expired. Being ur∣ged a fresh to Subscribe, he told them flatly, that he would never do it, nor submit to the 
Roman
 Church, which he was sure had nothing to do with the Apostolical Church of St. 
Thomas,
 no more than that of St. 
Thomas
 had to do with the 
Roman.
 And not being satisfied with having made this Declaration as to himself, he further∣more assembled a Synod of most of the Priests, and most substantial Christians at 
Angamale,
 the 
Metropolis
 of the Diocess, where they all swore to stand by their 
Arch-Deacon,
 in the defence of the ancient Faith they and their Fore-fathers had been bred up in, so as not to suffer the least alte∣ration to be made therein, nor ever to admit of any Bishop, but what should be sent them by the Patriarch of 
Babylon;
 of all which they made a publick Instrument, and having Sworn to main∣tain

 it with their Lives and Fortunes, ordered it to be published thorow the whole Diocess.


After the meeting of this Synod, the Christi∣ans of St. 
Thomas
 came to be so far enraged against the 
Latins,
 for what they had done to destroy their ancient Faith, and for their having treated so many of their Arch-Bishops, so barbarously as they had done, that they would suffer no 
Latin
 Priest to officiate in their Churches, nor so much as to live among them. Two 
Jesuites,
 one at 
Angamale,
 and another at 
Carturte,
 having very narrowly escaped being murdered by them. The 
Jesuites,
 and other 
Latin
 Priests, were so far inti∣midated, by the fury that Synod had put that whole Christianity into, that for some time none of them were found so hardy, as to ven∣ture to go among them.


The news of this great and unexpected Heat, as it did strangely afflict the Arch-Bishop, who had set his Heart so much on the reducing of those Christians; so it was the thing that made him resolve to go in Person to the 
Serra
 to try what his Presence and Authority would do.


Not only the Viceroy, but the whole Clergy and Laity, and particularly the whole Chapter of 
Goa,
 together in a body, did all they could, as it is said, to disswade him from so dangerous an enterprise, but tho' he was deaf to all the Re∣monstrances of his Friends, yet upon a War breaking out suddenly in the Year 1598. betwixt the Kings of 
Mangate
 and 
Paru,
 in whose Ter∣ritories most of these Christian Churches stand,

 he thought fit to put off his Journey for that Year, satisfying himself with writing a Letter to the Arch-Deacon to perswade him to reconcile him∣self and his Church to that of 
Rome,
 and acquaint∣ing him with his Intentions to visit all the Churches in the 
Serra
 in Person, so soon as the foremen∣tioned War was over, which he believed would be very speedily.


The Arch-Deacon, when he received this Let∣ter, dreading nothing so much as the Arch-Bi∣shop's coming in Person among them, declared that he had refused to Subscribe the forementi∣oned Profession of Faith, for no other reason, but because he was Commanded to do it before the Rector of the 
Jesuites
 College of 
Vaipicotta,
 with whom and his whole Order he pretended to be justly dissatisfied, giving the Arch-Bishop to understand at the same time, that if he would order any other Priest or Friar to take his Sub∣scription, that he was ready to make it.


But the Arch-Bishop looking upon this only as a Trick to throw an 
Odium
 upon the whole Order of 
Jesuites,
 and that for no other reason, but because they were the most industrious in the reduction of those Christians to the 
Roman
 Faith, would not comply with the Arch-Deacon's Re∣quest, in naming some body else to take his Sub∣scription; for which Conduct the Arch-Bishop was very much blamed, most People, and espe∣cially the other Orders of Friars murmuring a∣gainst him, as one grown so fond of the 
Jesuites,
 as to lose the reduction of so many thousand

 Souls, rather than displease the 
Jesuites.


But the 
Jesuites,
 who sacrifice all Interests and Obligations to the Honour of their Order, have requited the Arch-Bishop but very ill for this his great kindness for them, in having re∣ported this Affair so here in 
Europe,
 as to rob him of that which he esteemed his chief Glory, to wit, the Reduction of this Church to the 
Roman
 Faith.


For in the History of the 
Jesuites
 in the 
Indies,
 published by 
Pieire du Jarri,
 a 
Jesuite,
 and prin∣ted at 
Bourdeaux,
 in the Year 1608. we have all that is said by the 
Portuguezes
 of 
Mar Abraham,
 and his Arch-Deacon's great aversion to the 
Roman Church,
 and particularly to the whole Or∣der of 
Jesuites,
 flatly contradicted; for in that History we are told that 
Mar Abraham
 had such an extraordinary kindness for the 
Jesuites,
 that for some time before his Death, he put himself so entirely into their hands, as to be governed by them in all things; and that the Arch-Deacon 
George
 had such an high Opinion of their worth, as to declare to all the World, that without their aid and assistance, he should not know after the Arch-Bishop's Death, how to Govern the Diocess. It is furthermore said, that 
Mar Abraham,
 when he was upon his Death-bed called the Rector of the College of 
Vaipicotta
 to him, and having all his Clergy about him, declared, that he commit∣ted his Flock to the Bishop of 
Rome,
 as the chief Pastor and Prelate of the whole Church, and Commanded the Arch-Deacon, and all his Priests,

 to obey the 
Jesuites,
 whom his 
Holiness
 had sent to cultivate that Vineyard in all things, and to be sure to follow the Doctrines that they taught, which were the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; after which Charge he is said further∣more to have beseeched and conjured the Rector, by 
the love of Christ,
 and the 
great friendship
 there had been always between them, to take care of the Government of his Church after his Death, and to have ordered an authentick instrument to be made of all this to remain as a Testimony of his last Will, and of the Faith he died in.


The same History furthermore tells us, That this Church was so far reconciled to the Pope, in the Year, 1596. that when the 
Jubile
 of 
Clement
 VIII. was published among them by the 
Jesuites,
 they gave his 
Holiness
 a thousand Bles∣sings for it, and took a singular pleasure in pro∣nouncing his Name; and that during the whole time of the 
Jubile,
 they were at Church from Morning to Night, without taking any refection, and were so zealous to confess themselves to the Fathers, that they waited in the Church till Mid∣night in great Crowds to do it. Now accor∣ding to this report of things, the Arch-Bishop, when he came into the 
Serra,
 had little more to do than to open his Arms to embrace a People, who, being before hand prepared by the 
Jesuites,
 were ready to throw themselves into them.


But to leave Romance, and return to History, having only observed by the way, that it is vi∣sible from this gross misrepresentation of those

 Affairs, how little regard is to be had to the 
Jesuites
 Reports of their Feats in the 
Indies;
 since to support a Story purely invented for the Honour of their Order, they do not boggle to pretend to have an authentick instrument of the truth of it, and that drawn up by the Order of a dying Prelate.


But a thing happened at this time, which, tho' in it self not considerable, did abundantly ma∣nifest how little disposed the Clergy of this Church was to submit to the 
Pope.


A Boy, that went to School to the 
Jesuites
 at 
Vaipicotta,
 having been taught by them to name the Pope in his Prayers before the Patriarch of 
Babylon,
 being over-heard doing it in the Church by some of the 
Malabar
 Priests, was, after they had beat him severely, turned out of the Church; they spoke also to his Father to whip him out of pray∣ing for the Pope, who, they said, was none of their Prelate, nor had any thing to do with them. The Arch-Bishop being informed thereof, writ immediately to the Arch Deacon, commanding him to make Examples of those impudent He∣reticks, for what they had said and done to the Boy: which the Arch-Deacon was so far from doing, that he Honoured them the more for it. By the way, the 
Jesuites,
 teaching their Scho∣lars to pray for the Patriarch of 
Babylon,
 tho' after the Pope, is one instance, among others, of their Conscience, in those Parts, being subser∣vient to their Policy.




But the World continuing still to blame the Arch-Bishop for not putting the Affairs of the 
Serra
 into some other hands than those of the 
Jesuites,
 against whose order that whole Church was so much incensed, he was obliged at last, tho' contrary to his Inclination, to send a 
Fran∣ciscan
 Friar to the Arch-Deacon, with authority to take his Subscription to the 
Roman
 Creed, and to require him to punish the Priests, who had beat the Boy for naming the Pope in his Pray∣ers.


The Arch-Deacon having nothing to object against the 
Franciscan
 Friar, and being extreamly desirous, if it was possible, to keep the Arch-Bishop from coming into the 
Serra,
 tho' he refu∣sed to Subscribe the Creed of 
Pius
 IV. yet con∣descended to Subscribe a Confession of Faith, wherein he professed himself a 
Catholick,
 and that he believed 
as the Church believed,
 but without naming the 
Roman,
 or acknowledging the Pope as universal Pastor of the Church; he is furthermore said, upon the Arch-Bishop's sig∣nifying his dissatisfaction at the ambiguous Pro∣fession he had made, to have given his consent publickly to that of 
Pius
 IV. being read to him in 
Portugueze,
 of which he did not understand a Syllable. But let that be as it will, it is cer∣tain that he continued still to teach, that the Pope was the head of his own Church, but had nothing to do with that of St. 
Thomas.




The Arch-Bishop not being able to brook such things any longer, fix'd a day for his going to∣wards the 
Serra,
 and when the Viceroy and the whole Clergy beg'd of him not to expose his Per∣son to such visible danger, they could have no other answer from him but this, 
That his life was but too secure in this case, seeing he had ne∣ver merited enough to entitle him to the Honour of being a Martyr.
 However, lest his Humility might deceive him in passing a Judgment upon himself, he did not think fit to trust too much to his want of Merits; and for that reason went attended with a good Guard, he had also a Com∣mission to treat with all the Princes of 
Malabar,
 about Peace and War, and particularly to en∣gage the 
Samorim
 to assist the 
Portugueze
 to take 
Cunahle,
 a Fortress lately possessed by a com∣pany of 
Mahometan
 Pyrates, who did very much disturb the 
Portugueze
 Trade upon that Coast. This Nest of Pyrates, was first built by one 
Pate Marca,
 a 
Mahometan,
 who having in a short time enriched it strangely with the Spoils of the 
Por∣tuguezes,
 both by Sea and Land, left it at his Death to his Nephew 
Mahomet Cunahle Marca.
 This 
Mahomet
 was Governour, or rather Prince of it at this time; and as he was nothing inferior to his Uncle in Courage or Conduct, so he had Fortified the place so as to make it absolutely one of the strongest Garrisons in the 
Indies,
 nei∣ther did he insult the 
Portuguezes
 only, but the 
Malabars
 also, and particularly the 
Samorim,
 in whose Country 
Cunahle
 stood, and who had given

 leave to his Uncle to fortifie that place, on pur∣pose to incommode the 
Portugueze.


And tho' the 
Portugueze
 Historians will have it, that he took this Affair of 
Cunahle
 only in the way to his Visitation; yet by the course of his pro∣cedure, one would be tempted to think, that it was what principally carried him to those Parts.


On the 27th. of 
December,
 1598. the Arch-Bishop Embarked upon a Gally Commanded by 
Don Alvaro de Menezes,
 and on the day of 
Epi∣phany,
 arrived at the Bar of 
Cunahle,
 where he joined the whole 
Portugueze
 Armada, Comman∣ded by the Viceroy's Brother, he was saluted with all the Guns and Musick of the Fleet; and having called a Council of War, and heard the several Opinions of all the Captains con∣cerning the best way to take 
Cunahle,
 he dispatch∣ed the resolution they had come to thereon, to the Council of State at 
Goa;
 a most Apostolical begin∣ning of a Visitation. After having put the Siege of 
Cunahle
 into a good Posture, he departed with a good Convoy to 
Cananor,
 where he continued 16 days, and then sailed to 
Cochim,
 where he was splendidly received by the Governour and the whole City, at the Stairs they had made on purpose for him to Land at.


Next day, when the Magistrates of the City came to Complement him at his House, he ac∣quainted them with his design of reducing the Christians of St. 
Thomas
 before he returned to

 
Goa,
 desiring their assistance therein, which they frankly promised him.


The day following His 
Grace
 having called the common Council of the City together, re∣commended the enterprise of 
Cunahle
 to them, whom he made so sensible of how great impor∣tance it was to their City above all others, to have that Fortress wrested out of the hands of the 
Ma∣hometan
 Pyrates, who had lately made themselves Masters of it, that they immediately caused 150 Men to be Raised and Armed at their own Charge, whom, together with a great quantity of all sorts of Ammunition, they sent upon five stout Ships to joyn the 
Armada
 before 
Cunahle;
 the Arch-Bi∣shop also, to give the more life to the enterprise, sent one of the best of his own 
Manchua's
 or Yachts, mann'd with his own menial Servants, along with them.


The King of 
Cochim
 was much troubled to hear of the Arch-Bishop's being so hot upon the re∣duction of 
Cunahle,
 being sensible that a Peace betwixt the 
Portuguezes
 and the 
Samorim,
 with∣out whose assistance by Land, it wou'd be hard for them to reduce that Fortress, must be the Con∣sequence of the enterprise. And as there had been nothing, the Kings of 
Cochim
 had been always more careful to hinder such a Peace, which they than did on purpose to keep the 
Portuguezes
 in a closer dependance upon them; so the present King fol∣lowing the wise measures of his Ancestors, en∣deavour'd, by a Stratagem, to destroy the Con∣fidence he saw the 
Portuguezes
 had already repo∣sed

 in the 
Samorim.
 To which end he sent his 
Chief Justice,
 and one 
Joan de Miranda,
 a Gentleman of 
Cochim,
 to wait upon the 
Arch-Bishop
 and to acquaint his 
Grace
 from him, that he had received certain advice from some Spies he had in the 
Samorim
 Cabinet-Council, that that Prince, whenever the 
Portuguezes
 Landed, in∣stead of joyning with them, had determined to cut them all off in revenge of the many In∣juries they had done his Ancestors, of which danger he thought himself obliged, both as a Friend and a Brother in Arms to the King of 
Portugal
 to advise him.


The 
Arch-Bishop,
 who understood the In∣trigues of Princes, as well as any Man living, returned the King his Thanks for his Intelligence, but withal sent him word, that they were re∣solved to trust the 
Samorim
 in this occasion; and the rather, because they did not want Power to be revenged on all that should deceive the King of 
Portugal
 either in Peace or War.


The King, when he found his Plot had not succeeded according to his expectation, resolved to divert the 
Samorim
 from sending an Army to 
Cunahle,
 by making a War presently upon the 
Caimal,
 or Prince of 
Corngeira
 his Friend and Allie: and having with incredible expedition got an Army of 60000 Men together, he sent to let the 
Arch-Bishop
 know, that before he marched he designed to wait upon him. The 
Arch-Bishop,
 tho' he did not go over his Threshold to meet the King, received him, when he came,

 with great Civility; and after the Complements were over, acquainted him first, with his In∣tention of visiting all the 
Christian Churches
 in the 
Serra,
 in order to reduce them to the true Christian Faith, from which they had very much swerved; telling him, that since great numbers of those Churches were within his Territories, he expected his assistance in so good a work; of which being assured by the King, the 
Arch-Bishop
 went on and told him, that there was another thing that he must not deny him, and that was to put off his War with the 
Caimal
 till 
Cunahle
 was taken; the King gave many reasons why he could not deferr it; but the 
Arch-Bishop
 prest him so hard upon the point, that before they parted, he made him promise to disband his Army.


The 
Arch-Bishop
 having put the Affairs of the Siege in a good posture, begun to apply himself to the reduction of the Christians of St. 
Thomas,
 and the first step he made towards it, was to send to the 
Arch-Deacon
 to come and speak with him at 
Cochim.
 But after having expected him some days, and finding that he neither came himself, nor returned him any answer, he con∣cluded, as well he might, that he was afraid to venture himself in that City; whereupon he sent him a Letter of 
safe Conduct,
 swearing he would not question him about any thing that was past.


The 
Arch-Deacon,
 upon this occasion, Assem∣bled a great number of 
Caçanares,
 and other

 considerable Christians to consult together what was best to be done. It was agreed on all hands, that the 
Arch-Deacon
 shou'd go and wait upon his 
Lordship,
 who was a Person of that Autho∣rity as to be able to undo them all at once, by depriving them of their 
Pepper
-Trade, if they should disoblige him, and besides, he was able to oblige their Kings, who were all very much at his Devotion, to Sacrifice all their Lives and E∣states to his displeasure; and what made them the willinger to comply with him therein, was, their being confident that they should be quickly rid of his Company, since Winter was at hand, which they thought would certainly call him to 
Goa.


Upon all which Considerations it was agreed, That they should give way to his saying of 
Mass,
 and his Preaching in their Churches, which their Books told them was a common Civility, that is every where paid to Bishops, tho' out of their own Diocesses; but as for any Acts of Jurisdicti∣on, such as Visiting, Conferring Orders, Excom∣municating, and the like, if he should pretend to exercise any such Acts, as it was to be feared he would, that they shou'd then put him off as well as they cou'd with delays, until he returned to 
Goa,
 which they thought he would in two Months at farthest; by which means they might, without embroiling themselves with so powerful a Prelate, wait till they had a Bishop sent them by the Patriarch of 
Babylon,
 to whom they had writ for one; of all which they made a pub∣lick

 Instrument, and for their further Security, brought together a Body of 3000 brave Men, who were all well Armed; the Christians of St. 
Thomas
 being, by much, both the stoutest and best Firemen in the 
Indies,
 as the 
Portu∣guezes
 knew very well, which made them be the more zealous to reduce them to the 
Roman Church,
 in order to make them Subjects to the King of 
Portugal.


The 
Arch-Bishop
 sent also at the same time to some of their 
Paniquais,
 some of which have 4000, some 6000 Men at their Command, to come and speak with him at 
Cochim;
 but they, instead of going thither, took an Oath solemnly to make themselves 
Amouços,
 after the Custom of the 
Malavars,
 against him, in case he offer'd any violence to their 
Arch-Deacon,
 or to any other of their Priests. When the 
Malavars
 devote themselves to be 
Amouços
 for any cause, they defend it to the last drop of their Blood, with∣out either fear or wit.


With two of these 
Paniquais,
 and 3000 Men well Armed, the 
Arch-Deacon
 came to wait up∣on the 
Arch-Bishop
 at 
Cochim. Don Antonio de Noronha,
 the Governour of the City, met them without the Gates, and conducted them to the 
Arch-Bishop
's Palace. The 
Arch-Deacon,
 when he came before the 
Arch-Bishop
 kneeled down and kiss'd his Hand, as did all the other 
Caçanares
 that were in his Company; the two 
Paniquais
 were also presented to his 
Lordship
 by the 
Arch-Deacon,
 who when the 
Arch-Bishop,
 and the 
Governour,


 and the 
Arch-Deacon
 came to sit down, placed themselves at the Elbows of the 
Arch-Bishop
's Chair, where they stood all the while with their broad Swords naked over his Head. The door of the Room where they were being shut, to keep out the Crowd, those that stood without imagining that it was done to make their 
Arch-Deacon
 a Prisoner, said to one another, this is the time to die for our 
Arch-Deacon,
 and for the Church of St. 
Thomas,
 but being assured that their 
Arch-Deacon
 was in no danger, they were quieted.


After the hubbub was over, and they had dis∣coursed together for some time, it was agreed, that the 
Arch-Bishop
 should go next day to 
Vaipi∣cotta,
 which upon the account of its having a College of 
Jesuites
 in it, should be the first Church he should Visit, and that the 
Arch-Dea∣con
 with his 
Caçanares,
 should repair thither im∣mediately.


The 
Arch-Bishop
 having furnished himself with all Necessaries for his Voyage, embarked with all his Retinue upon seven 
Tones
 or 
Gallies,
 and 
Roque de Mello Pereyro,
 who had been Governour of 
Malaca,
 attended him with two 
Gallies
 more, and 
Joan Pereyra de Miranda,
 who was afterwards Governour of 
Cranganor
 with one.


Being arrived at 
Vaipicotta,
 he was conduct
d by the 
Jesuites,
 and their Scholars, and the whole Village to the Church, where, with his 
Mitre
 on his Head, and his 
Crosier
 in his hand, he gave them a long Sermon. His Text was, 
He that

 entereth not in by the door,
 &c. on which words he told them at length, 
That none were true Pa∣stors, but what entered in by the door of the
 Roman 
Church, and were sent by the Pope, who was Christ's Vicar; which none of their former Prelates having been, who had been all sent to them by the Schisma∣tical Bishops of
 Babylon, 
they were all Thieves and Murderers of the Flock.
 When he had done his Sermon, he bid them come next day to the Church to be confirmed, which some did; to whom, after he had confirmed them, he told the news of 
Purgatory,
 a place most of them had never heard of before.


All this while no 
Arch-Deacon
 appeared, who came not to 
Vaipicotta,
 till two days after the arrival of the 
Arch-Bishop.
 He had delayed his coming on purpose, that he might not by his pre∣sence, seem to consent to any of those things, which he knew the 
Arch-Bishop
 would offer to do at that place.


Tho' the 
Arch-Bishop
 knew well enough what it was that had made the 
Arch-Deacon
 loiter so behind, yet he dissembled so far as to receive him very kindly, treating with him about the course he was to take in the reduction of the Church, who seemed to approve of every thing that was proposed to him.


The 
Arch-Bishop
 went daily to 
Matins
 and 
Vespers,
 which were sung by those of the Semi∣nary in 
Chaldee,
 but coming to understand at last, for he understood 
Chaldee
 no more than he did 
Malavar,
 that they prayed therein for the Patri∣arch

 of 
Babylon,
 stiling him the 
Ʋniversal Pastor of the Church,
 a Title that all Patriarchs, as well as the Pope, have assumed to themselves for some Hundred of Years (nay, by what 
Gre∣gory
 I. has said of that Title, I do not know but the Pope might be one of the last that assumed it) he resolved not to permit so wicked a thing to be done any longer, notwithstanding all that the good 
Jesuites,
 who out of Policy had all along complyed with it, could say to disswade him; and so having one Evening, without com∣municating his design to any one, called all the 
Jesuites,
 Masters of the Seminary, and the 
Arch-Deacon,
 and his 
Caçanares,
 together at his Lodg∣ings, having first made a Speech to them to prove, 
That the
 Pope 
was the only Head of the Church on Earth, and that the Bishop of
 Babylon 
was a Here∣tick and Schismatick,
 he pulled out of his Pocket an Excommunication 
latae sententiae,
 commanding his Secretary to read it with an audible Voice, and his Interpreter to declare it to those that did not understand 
Latin,
 in 
Malavar,
 by which he Commanded, 
That no Person Secular or Ecclesi∣astick do from henceforward presume to pray for the
 Patriarch of Babylon. He Commanded the 
Arch-Deacon
 and 
Caçanares
 to sign it, and finding the 
Arch-Deacon
 had a great mind to have shuf∣fled it off, he said to him, 
Sign it, Father, for it is full time the Axe were laid to the Root of the Tree;
 to which the 
Arch-Deacon
 returned no an∣swer, but Signed it without saying a word, as did all the other 
Caçanares,
 after which

 it was fixed to the Gates of the Church.


The Christians of the Village, when they came to hear of what had been done, run, as if they had been Mad, in a Body to the 
Arch-Dea∣con
's Lodgings, where, with one voice, they set up a most lamentable howl, crying out, 
That the Arch-Bishop of
 Goa, 
with his
 Portuguezes 
was come to destroy their Religion, and had affronted their
 Patriarch, 
by whom they had been Governed for above
 1200 
Years;
 and after having exclaimed against the 
Arch-Bishop
 at a most bitter rate, and bewailed their great Misery, in having Strangers come among them to destroy the Religion they had been born and bred in, they told their 
Cassa∣nares,
 that if they would but give way to it, they would either Sacrifice their Lives in defence of their Religion, or be revenged on those that had affronted it.


But the 
Arch-Deacon
 having made a sign, that he desired to be heard, they all held their Peace, he told them, 
There was a time for all things, and that that was not a time for Revenge, but Dissimu∣lation; that it was true he had Signed the Excom∣munication, but that he did it purely out of Fear, for they were to consider, that, besides the Strength the
 Arch-Bishop 
had brought along with him, he had engaged the King of
 Cochim, 
in whose Country they were, to protect him in all he did, and who, if they should offer any affront to the
 Arch-Bishop, 
would certainly revenge it on their Lives and Estates. As to himself, he was resolved to die in defence of the Religion of his Country, sooner than consent to the

 introduction of
 Popery; adding, 
The
 Portuguezes, 
if they liked their own Religion, might live in it, in God's Name, and he knew no Body that would trouble them for it; but that he saw no reason why they should thus disturb and persecute People in their own Country, because they will not turn
 Papists, 
or change their
 old Religion 
for theirs, and that as to the
 Arch-Bishop, 
the thing that made him so furious to destroy the Authority of the
 Patriarch of Babylon 
was, that he might make himself Primate of the
 In∣dies; 
to which he hoped, none of the Christians of
 Malabar 
would ever consent, or would ever be per∣swaded to forsake their
 old Religion 
for that of
 Popery. At this they all gave a great shout, crying, 
They would lose their Lives, and all they had in the World, before they would do it.
 But none of the forementioned 
Amoucos
 being among them, it's like, at that time they went no fur∣ther.


The 
Portuguezes
 upon this uproar, did not forbear to blame the 
Arch-Bishop,
 for having pub∣lished such an 
Excommunication,
 contrary to the advice of all that were about him, advising him to hasten aboard his Galleys if he would secure his Person; he told them, 
He was so far from re∣penting for what he had done, that were it to do again, he would do it, and that instead of retreating to
 Cochim, 
he would go next Morning to
 Paru.


Paru
 is the 
Metropolis
 of a Kingdom, wherein the noblest Body of all the Christians of St. 
Thomas
 lives, but withal, the most violent against 
Popery,
 as they had sufficiently manifested on several oc∣casions;

 for tho' 
Don Jorge du Cruz,
 and 
Don Joan du Cruz,
 both Natives of the Country, had been sent by the 
Portuguezes
 to 
Rome
 in the time of 
Gregory
 XIII. who had done them great Honours there, and had granted them ma∣ny 
Indulgences
 for their Churches, and withal, a Privileged Altar therein, yet their Countrymen did not only slight all those 
Indulgences,
 but would not so much as suffer them, tho' of two of the noblest Families in the Country, to offici∣ate in any of their Churches, and at last forc'd them to leave the Kingdom, their own Brethren and Kinsfolk, having the first hand in their ex∣pulsion.


The Christians of 
Paru,
 tho' thus affected to the 
Roman
 Church, had, according to the fore∣mentioned Agreement, prepared great 
Festivities
 for the reception of the 
Arch-Bishop,
 hoping, by such Complements, to have kept him from doing any business; but, having the Night before he came, heard of what he had done at 
Vaipi∣cotta
 to their Patriarch, they turned all their 
Festivities
 into 
Arms,
 and were so much incensed against him, that when he Landed, he was met by eight or ten Persons only that waited on the 
Arch-Deacon.


The 
Arch-Bishop,
 tho' he read trouble and de∣jection in all their Countenances, seemed to take no notice of it, but with his 
Cross
 carried before him went directly to the Church, which, con∣trary to Custom, he found full of Armed Men, without so much as one Woman or Child a∣mongst

 them; whereupon, being apprehensive lest his Guards and Servants, if they continued ashoar, might come to Blows with the 
Malavars,
 whom he saw so much disposed to Quarrel, he Commanded them all aboard except two Priests, who were to assist at the Offices.


The 
Arch-Bishop
 having put on his 
Pontificals,
 and given his Blessing to the Congregation, made a long discourse to them, shewing them, 
That there was but one true Religion, which was the
 Roman, 
and that all Christians were under an in∣dispensable obligation to submit themselves to the
 Pope. After he had done his Sermon, which lasted an hour and an half, and explained to them the Doctrine of the Sacrament of 
Confirma∣tion,
 and then called upon them to come to it; the Congregation, tho' they had heard him till then very quietly; began to cry out with great fury, 
That they would never be Confirmed by him, that being a thing that none of their Prelates had ever used, and that it was no Sacrament of Christ's Institution, but an Invention of the
 Portuguezes 
to make them their Slaves, by
 setting a Mark on their Foreheads, 
and
 giving them a Box on the Ear, which is what all the 
Roman
 Bishops do in 
Confir∣mation, and tho' the
 Dastards 
in
 Vaipicotta 
had been so tame as to suffer themselves to be buffeted and en∣slaved by him, they would never endure it, nor suf∣fer him to touch their Beards, or their Wives Faces; that he might go home in a good hour to his
 Portu∣guezes, 
and let them alone with their Religion, and if he did continue to disturb them thus, it should

 cost him dear.
 The 
Arch-Bishop
 heard all this with great patience, and sitting down, endea∣voured to convince them of the Truth of the Sacrament of 
Confirmation;
 but when he per∣ceived that they were the worse, rather than the better for what he said to them, having mu∣stered all his Courage together, he rose up, and having advanced two steps with his 
Crosier
 in his hand, he told them with great heat, 
That the Faith he Preached to them was the Faith of
 Christ 
and St.
 Thomas, 
and was believed by all Christians, and that he was ready to die to confirm the truth of it;
 but they being as ready to die for their Reli∣gion as he was, or pretended to be, for his, that Argument had no effect at all upon them. He furthermore challenged all those that 
Talked a∣gainst the
 Roman 
Faith by Night in Corners, to come forth, if they durst, to dispute with him pub∣lickly;
 which the 
Arch-Deacon,
 who the Night before had assembled most of the considerable Christians of 
Paru
 together, and had made them promise never to throw off the 
Patriarch
 of 
Ba∣bylon,
 taking to himself, he rose up in, a passion, and having asked aloud 
who they were that taught Heresies in the dark, and that Preached no where but in Corners,
 flung out of the 
Church,
 and going into the Town picked up eight or ten Boys, whom he presented to the 
Arch-Bishop
 to be confirmed by him, pretending, that with all that he was able to do, he could perswade no more to come: The 
Arch-Bishop
 having confirmed these Boys, returned to his Gallies very angry,

 and finding there was nothing more to be done at 
Paru,
 he determined to Sail next Morning to 
Mangate,
 to see how those 
Christians
 stood af∣fected.


When he came to the Church of 
Mangate,
 a Town chiefly inhabited by Christians, he found the Church filled with Houshold Goods and Wo∣men, by reason of the War that was then on foot between the Kings of 
Mangate
 and 
Paru.
 After having comforted the Christians for the Losses they had sustained, and given them his Blessing, he began to Preach against the Errors they had been Educated in. But having advice that there were some 
Amouços
 coming after him from 
Paru,
 he went straightways aboard his Gallies, and row∣ing away before Night, he arrived next Morn∣ing at 
Cheguree,
 a place belonging to his Friend the King of 
Cochim;
 where having sent ashore an Order to the 
Caçanares
 and 
Christians
 to meet him at the Church, he had word sent him, that the Church doors were all shut, and there was nei∣ther Man, Woman, nor Child, to be seen in the whole Village; he was informed at Night, that the 
Arch-Deacon
 was in the Town, but that he had shut himself up in a House, and was resolved never to see his 
Lordship
 again.


The 
Portuguezes
 that were in his Train, as well Ecclesiasticks as Seculars, were at him perpetually to give over this enterprise, and not to expose his Person and Dignity (as he did) to no purpose; but instead of returning any answer to their

 Importunities, he retired all alone to his 
Cabin,
 where he wrote a long Letter to the 
Arch-Deacon,
 in which he swore that he remembred nothing that was past, and that he had no design of doing him any harm, and if he would but do him the favour to come and speak with him once more, he did not doubt but that he should be able to convince him of his Errors, promising with all to do great things for him, if he would but entirely submit himself to the 
Roman
 Church.


This Letter was delivered the same Night to the 
Arch-Deacon,
 who having read it, called the 
Caçanares
 together, and told them, that it being a scandalous thing in them to decline treating with the 
Arch-Bishop
 above board, about the Affairs of Religion, he was for their going to wait upon him to hear what he could say, but with such a Guard, that it should not be in his Power to make them Prisoners. Having all agreed to this Proposition, they sent to the 
Arch Bishop
 to let him know, That if he would be please
 to come ashoar, they would wait, upon him The 
Arch-Bishop
 sent them back word, That th
 Sun was too hot to stand in, and desired the
 therefore to come aboard his Galley, which la
 with her 
Stern
 on ground. The 
Arch-Deaco
 and 
Caçanares
 seeing the Galley quite surrounde
 by their People ventured to go aboard; whe
 being come, they were conducted to the 
Arc
Bishop
's Cabin, where they found him with a
 his Priests, 
Jesuites,
 and several Gentlemen e
¦pecting them. After some discourse, the 
Arc
Deaco


 told the 
Arch-Bishop, That it was true they had not received his
 Grace 
so courteously as might have been expected, nor indeed as they inten∣ded to have done, had he not fallen so foul upon their
 Patriarch, 
whom, tho' he had been pleased to call an Excommunicate Heretick, they knew to be both a Catholick and a most holy Man, and endea∣voured to introduce several Novelties into the
 Serra, 
which they and their Forefathers had never so much as heard of before.
 To all which the 
Arch-Bishop
 answered, 
That he was sure they were not ignorant of the Patriarch of
 Babylon
's being a Professed
 Ne∣storian, 
and not to trouble them with any Arguments to prove that all
 Nestorians 
must be Hereticks, he would only ask them one single Question,
 which was, 
Whether they believed the Gospel of St.
 John? They told him 
they did, and would die rather than deny any thing that was revealed in it. Well then,
 said the 
Arch-Bishop, pray tell me, how you can re∣concile what St.
 John 
saith,
 The word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us, 
with what your Pa∣triarchs and Bishops have taught you, to wit,
 that the Word did not make it self Flesh, and that Christ was not God, and that God did not make himself Man, 
for do you not sing in your Churches upon the Feast of the Nativity, that the Word did not make it self Flesh, as the unbelieving
 Romans 
teach, but did only dwell in Christ as in a Temple.


The 
Arch-Deacon
 returned no answer to this, but passing to another point, said to the 
Arch-Bishop, Your
 Grace 
would fain perswade us likewise, that none can be saved out of the Obedience of the


 Roman 
Church, which is what St.
 John 
no where saith, that ever I could see; besides, we have in our
 Archives 
a Letter of St.
 Caius, 
Bishop of
 Rome, 
wherein he confesseth that he had nothing to do with the Church of
 Babylon, 
no more than the Church of
 Babylon 
had to do with his Church. We have also another Letter, which is called in our Books the
 Letter of the Lord's-day, 
because it is said upon that day to have fallen down from Heaven, where∣in the same Truth is affirmed.
 Here the 
Arch-Bishop
 run into a long discourse of the Primacy of St. 
Peter,
 and of the 
Pope
's being his Successor, and 
Christ's Vicar
 upon Earth; after which they came at last to this Agreement, That as to matters of Faith, a Synod should be called to determine them; and that in the mean while the 
Arch-Bi∣shop
 might, if he pleased, give the Blessing, and Preach in any of their Churches, but should not be received in them as their Prelate, but as a Bishop that was a Stranger, neither should he pretend to 
Confirm,
 or do any other Episcopal Act within that Diocess. This Agreement was Signed by the 
Arch-Bishop
 and the 
Arch-Deacon,
 and all the 
Caçanares
 who were present, with a Declaration that the Synod should be Celebrated before 
Whitsuntide,
 and that the 
Arch-Deacon
 should no longer stir up the People against him, nor go attended with such Troops of Armed Men as he had done formerly.


This Agreement being Signed, the 
Arch-Bi∣shop
 set Sail for 
Canhur,
 whither the 
Arch-Deacon
 went by Land, not daring to trust himself by

 Water, where he would have been in the Power of the 
Portuguezes.


At 
Canhur
 he was received very friendly by the 
Christians,
 who had been told by the 
Arch-Deacon,
 that he did not pretend to come among them as their Prelate, but only as a Stranger, but tho' he kept to his Agreement so far as not to of∣fer to do any thing but give the Blessing and Preach, yet in his 
Sermon,
 which was a very long one, he talked so much of the 
Roman Church,
 and its 
Supremacy,
 and of the obligation all Churches were under to submit to it, that the whole Congregation were much offended with him; the 
Arch-Deacon
 was likewise discontented with it, and being Sick, or at least pretending he was, returned to 
Cheguree
 to be cured; and the 
Arch-Bishop
 having other work on his hands, was willing enough to dismiss him; who, in pursu∣ance of the Instruction he brought with him from 
Goa,
 was obliged to hasten to 
Coulaon,
 a Fortress belonging to the 
Portuguezes,
 to see in what condition it was, and to take some course to have the Fort the King of 
Travancor
 was build∣ing in its Neighbourhood, and would much in∣commode it, demolished.


On the first of 
March
 he set Sail for a Castle that is within two Leagues of 
Cochim,
 where the Governour and Bishop of the City met him, to whom having communicated his Designs, he Sailed directly for 
Porcoa,
 where the King of the Country had been some days expecting him; he went to a Church that was there in the Evening,

 where he was kindly received by the 
Christians;
 the King, who professed a great Friendship for the 
Portuguezes,
 having Commanded them, upon pain of his displeasure, to comply with the 
Arch-Bishop
 in all things. After having Preached, he went to Lodge at the House of the 
Caçanar,
 whi∣ther the King came at Night to visit him; the 
Arch-Bishop
 entertained him very friendly, and thanked him for the kindness he had shewed to the 
Christians
 of St. 
Thomas,
 and their Churches, and for having cleared his Coast of Pyrates: the King, after some Complements desired to be admitted to the Honour of being a 
Brother in Arms
 to the King of 
Portugal,
 as the King of 
Cochim
 had been: The 
Arch-Bishop
 told him, that was an Honour the King of 
Portugal
 never did to any King, before he had merited it by some signal Service; however, he promised to do all that lay in his Power to help him to it.


Next Morning the 
Arch-Bishap
 went to Church, where he said 
Mass,
 and afterwards confirmed the whole Congregation, notwithstanding his late solemn Promise to the contrary, as indeed none but Fools will ever expect, that 
Papists
 will ob∣serve any such Promises longer than the first op∣portunity they have to break them.


From 
Porcoa
 he sailed directly to 
Coulaon,
 where, under pretence of visiting a Church that stood near the Fort the King of 
Travancor
 was building, he took a view of the Fort, and finding it was near finished, and would in a few days have a Garrison put in it, he immediately dis∣patched

 away a Messenger to the Captain Gene∣ral of the Fleet and Troops that were before 
Cu∣nahle,
 to come forthwith with his whole 
Armada
 to demolish the said Fort, which, if he came quick∣ly, he might do with great ease, for that he would find none in it but Workmen.


Now you must know that the 
Arch-Bishop,
 when he was last at the Bar of 
Cunahle,
 notwith∣standing that the King of 
Travancor
 and the 
Por∣tuguezes
 were at that time in Peace, had left a private Order with the General, that so soon as he was Master of 
Cunahle,
 he should set Sail im∣mediately with the whole 
Armada,
 and demolish this Fort, which, by reason of 
Cunahle
's not being yet taken, had not been executed.


But while the 
Arch-Bishop
 was expecting the Captain-General, he received the bad news of a great slaughter of 
Portuguezes
 in an Attack they had made upon 
Cunahle,
 and that the Captain-General was retired to 
Cochim
 to have his wound∣ed Men cured; from whence he intended to come and wait upon him for further Orders.


The 
Arch-Bishop
 was extreamly troubled at this News, as well upon the account of the great numbers of Persons of Quality that had been killed in the Action, as because he feared it would very much hearten the Kings of 
Malabar,
 who had till then still looked upon the 
Portuguezes
 as Invincible. Wherefore, to prevent the ill effects that the true News of this Defeat might have up∣on the Minds of the Princes of 
Malabar,
 he dis∣patched Letters immediately to all of them to

 acquaint them with the great Victory the 
Portu∣guezes
 had obtained before 
Cunahle;
 and tho' he acknowledged, that it was purchased with the Blood of several brave Men, among whom were some of his own Kindred, who were very dear to him, yet he did not doubt but that they would infallibly carry the Place, at the next Attack they made.


These tricks of the 
Arch-Bishop
 coming so thick, one upon the neck of another, for here we have no fewer than three of them in less than a Fortnight, puts me in mind of what 
Manuel de Faria
 saith of him in the 
3d.
 Tome of his 
Asia Portuguesa,
 which I shall give the Reader in his own words, 
Este illustre Prelado estuviera yo por ventura en el numero de los santos, si no passara a Espanna a donde le quito esta gloria, en la opinion mortal, la deficil del acierto en el maneio de los grandes puestos que vinoa ocupar, o fuessen solicitudos, o fuessen ofrecidos.
 
This Illustrious Prelate, had he never returned to 
Spain,
 had, in all probability, been made a Saint before this time, where, thro' the difficulty there is in the managery of high Posts, whether offered to him or procured by Sollicitations, he lost all the Glory he had acquired in the 
Indies
 in the Opinion of the World.


His High Posts in 
Spain,
 which the Author saith he does not know whether he procured by Sol∣licitations or not, were the 
Primacy of Braga,
 and 
Viceroyship of Portugal,
 under 
Philip
 III. for two Years, and the 
Presidentship
 of the 
Council of

 State
 of 
Portugal
 at 
Madrid,
 in which Office and Court he died.


What his Miscarriages were in 
Spain,
 whereby he is said to have forfeited his Glory, I have not been able to learn; but whatever they were, one would think that the violating of a solemn Agree∣ment openly, within a Week after it was made, and the ordering a Fort belonging to a Prince, that was in Peace with them, to be treacherously demolished, and the dispersing of notorious Falshoods only to serve a turn, ought to be no very good title to 
Saintship.
 But the 
Arch-Bishop,
 if he could have had hands to have executed it, had served the King of 
Travancor
 a much worse trick than this, when he was upon his Visitation that was after the Synod. We are told of a live∣ly thing spoke by a 
Portugueze
 Captain, that was very brave, but had scarce Bread to eat, who, in this Siege, having seven of his Teeth struck out with a Musquet-Bullet, after he had wiped his Mouth said, 
The
 Mahometan 
had done him no Injury, and had known doubtless he had no need of Teeth.
 But to return to the Story.


The 
Arch-Bishop,
 after having sent this false News about, and having sent to the Queen of 
Changanate,
 to let her know, that he should not be able to meet her according to his Promise, until he returned; Sailed in great hast to 
Cochim,
 to conferr with the Captain-General, and to consult whether it would not be convenient to make an absolute Peace with the 
Samorim,
 and the rather because he had been so true to his

 Word, in carrying on the Siege of 
Cunahle.
 It was agreed on all hands that such a Peace would be convenient at that time; however, they would not venture to conclude it before they had the 
Viceroy
's Opinion of it, to whom they sent the Project.


The 
Arch-Bishop,
 after he had dispatched this business, Sailed to 
Molandurte,
 a great place of Christians, where he was received very kindly, which kindness of theirs is said to have cost them dear; for the King of 
Cochim,
 to whom 
Molandurte
 belongs, being grown extreamly jealous that the 
Arch-Bishop,
 under a pretence of reducing the Christians of St. 
Thomas
 to the obe∣dience of the 
Roman Church,
 designed to bring them under the obedience of the Crown of 
Por∣tugal,
 as it is plain he did from the 24th 
Decree
 of the last 
Action
 of the following 
Synod,
 for this very reason laid a great Tribute upon them, which they have not been able to this day to shake off; and furthermore Commanded them, upon pain of Death, to repair to 
Angamale
 to their 
Arch-Deacon,
 who being there, and having heard, it's like, of the 
Arch-Bishop
's having vio∣lated their Agreement within less than a Week after it was made, begun to thunder out Excom∣munications against him, writing to all his Churches to have nothing more to do with him, and to all the Princes of 
Malabar,
 to have a care of him as a Person that had ill designs upon their Subjects.




While the 
Arch-Bishop
 was at 
Molandurte,
 where he confirmed and exercised all Episcopal Acts, he received Letters from the 
Viceroy
 ap∣proving his Project of Peace with the 
Samorim,
 and desiring him to return to 
Vaipim
 to Sign it, which he did in great haste, as did the Gover∣nour and Bishop of 
Cochim
 also, who both met him there.


This Peace was much promoted on the 
Samo∣rim
 side by his Nephew and first Minister 
Ʋniare Cherare,
 who, notwithstanding he had been pri∣vately Christned by Father 
Roz,
 had leave to con∣tinue to Profess himself a Heathen still, the better to enable him to serve the 
Portuguezes,
 which he did effectually, both by communicating to them daily all the Secrets of his Uncles Cabinet-Coun∣cil, whereof he was President, and by disposing him to have a good opinion of the 
Portuguezes;
 which was what he would not have been in a ca∣pacity to have done, but would have been imme∣diately disgraced, and turned out of all, had he discovered himself to have been a Christian so soon as he was Baptized. And as for the 
Arch-Bishop,
 we find he was so far from condemn∣ing either the Prince or the Jesuite for this scan∣dalous dissimulation, that after the Celebration of the Synod he confirmed and anointed the Prince therein, by giving him the Sacrament of 
Chrism
 or 
Confirmation,
 with the same Secresie, and the same Dispensation as the Jesuite had given him that of Baptism.




After he had dispatched the Peace, Signed to the Captain-General, he set Sail for 
Diamper,
 the ancient Seat of several of the Bishops of the 
Serra,
 where meeting with several that had a mind to take Orders, there having been no Ordination in the Bishoprick for two Years, he gave notice that he intended to conferr Or∣ders on the 
Saturday
 before the 
Fifth Sunday
 in 
Lent.


He writ also to the 
Arch-Deacon
 to come and assist at the Solemnity; the 
Arch-Deacon
 was much concerned at the news, and writ him back word, 
That this was contrary to the late A∣greement they had made together, and that his do∣ing of it would put an end to the Affair of the Synod, which he seemed to desire so much, since the prin∣cipal point that was to be debated therein was, 
Whether he was their Prelate or no?
 But the 
Arch-Bishop
 fansying that the 
Arch-Deacon
 talked of a Synod only to amuse him and gain time, writ him word, that nothing should hinder him from Conferring Orders at the time appointed; and not only so, but that he would exercise all other Acts of Episcopal Jurisdiction, in obedience to the Pope's 
Briefs,
 to whom all the Churches of the World were subject. The 
Arch-Deacon
 finding he was absolutely determined to Ordain, desired him, since he was resolved to do't right or wrong, to Ordain none but 
Latins,
 for so they called not only the 
Portuguezes,
 but all the 
Malavars,
 who were bred up under the 
Jesuites.
 The 
Arch-Bishop
 sent him word again, that he

 would Ordain both 
Latins
 and 
Chaldaeans,
 it be∣ing his business to destroy that distinction by bringing all Christians under one head. Upon this the 
Arch-Deacon
 finding nothing else would do, ordered an Edict to be published in all the Churches of the Diocess, prohibiting all Christi∣ans, upon pain of Excommunication, 
latae senten∣tiae,
 to receive any Orders from him, with which he sent another Instrument, commanding all Priests and Christian People not to suffer him to come into any of their Churches, as also not to be present at any of his 
Masses
 or 
Sermons.


The 
Arch-Bishop
 had Preached two days fol∣lowing, and had confirmed a great many before these Instruments had reached 
Diamper;
 but after they came once to be published, they put a full stop to what went on so currently before: The oldest 
Caçanar
 of the Church requiring the 
Arch-Bishop,
 upon the receipt of them, to leave the place, and not to offer to set his Foot in their Church any more, nor to Confirm any Body, which among them, who anointed Children on the Head when they were Baptized, was an un∣necessary Ceremony.


Notwithstanding this, the 
Arch-Bishop
 continued still a Preaching, and when the day appointed for the Ordination was come, Ordained 37 on it, having first obliged them to subscribe the Faith of 
Pius
 IV. and to swear obedience to the Pope. After this Solemnity was over, the 
Arch-Bishop
 determined to pass the 
Holy Week,
 and 
Easter
 at 
Carturte,
 a considerable Town of

 
Christians
 in the Dominions of the Queen of 
Pimenta.
 He took several Churches in his way thither, at some of which he met with a kind Reception, at others the Christians would not so much as see him. Being arrived at 
Carturte,
 after a dangerous Voyage, on the 
Friday
 before 
Palm-Sunday,
 he went to Church betimes next Morning, where having said 
Mass,
 and Preached, he Commanded the Congregation not to fail to be at Church next day, for that he had some∣thing of Importance to communicate to them; and having the same Night invited several of the most considerable Christians of the place aboard his Galley, by some means or other; for you must understand he was not sparing of his Money in this occasion, no more than he was of his Promises, he gained two of the most substantial among them intirely to his Party, who did him afterwards very great Service: Their Names were 
Itimato Mapula,
 and 
Itimane Mapula.


The 
Arch-Bishop
 not knowing but that the 
Por∣tuguezes
 Musick might charm the common People, and reconcile them to the 
Latin
 Service, to which they seemed to have a great aversion, sent for a full Quire from 
Cochim,
 and on 
Palm-Sunday
 had high 
Mass
 performed with the same Ceremony and Majesty that he could have had it done at 
Goa:
 but the 
Caçanares
 and People were so far from being satisfied with the Musick and pompous Ceremony of that Service, that if they liked it ill before, they liked it a great deal worse after that, as in truth none but they that

 place all Religion in external Performances can do otherwise, there being no Passion which that Service will not excite in its Spectators (which is all the People are) sooner than Devotion.


The Queen of 
Pimenta
 being importun'd to it by several Christians, and her own Jealousies, sent an Order to the 
Arch-Bishop
 to leave her Kingdom in three days upon pain of Death, and not to trouble her Subjects with his 
Novelties,
 un∣der which, she had reason to apprehend some ill design against her State was couched. But the 
Arch-Bishop
 knew his own strength too well to be frighted away with Paper Threats, and so sent the Queen back word positively, that he would not stir out of her Territories before he had finished the work that had brought him thither, telling her withal, 
That he was serving her rather than otherwise in what he was doing, and that her
 Ancestors 
had granted Privileges to the Arch-Bishop of the
 Serra, 
but being
 Infidels 
had never offered to concern themselves in the matters of their Religion; That if she should Murther him, she must know, that she Muthered the second Man in the
 Indies; 
and that his would be the dearest Blood that ever she spilt in her Life; since the
 Portuguezes, 
the Greatness of whose Power she and her Kingdom could not be but sensible of, having so often felt it, would infal∣libly Revenge his Death to the utmost.


What made the 
Arch-Bishop
 the stouter in this occasion, was his knowing that he had secured most of her 
Regedores,
 namely him of 
Carturte,
 and the Country about it to his Party, whom

 he had engaged by very rich Presents to favour and protect him in the execution of his designs. The 
Arch-Bishop
 having thus intimidated the Queen, and bribed her Officers, began to make bolder steps than he had offered to make before, and so seeing a 
Caçanar
 at Church one day, whom he had excommunicated but a little before, for having presumed to excommunicate him, he sent to him to get him out of the Church, which was no place for an excommunicate Rebel as he was. The 
Caçanar
 laughed at the Order, and told him very briskly, 
That he would not go out of the Church, for that he was none of his Prelate, neither did he value
 Roman 
Excommunications no more than he did the dirt under his feet; the
 Roman 
Church having nothing to do with the Church of the
 Serra; the 
Arch-Bishop
 not being able to bear such a publick Affront, and knowing his Party in the Church to be the stronger, commanded the Ser∣vice and Musick to cease; and turning towards the place where the 
Caçanar
 stood, commanded him to come up to him, which the 
Caçanar
 re∣fusing to do with great scorn; he was dragg'd up to him by some 
Caçanares,
 and others that he had gained to his Party, and being kept down upon his Knees before him, was commanded to beg his 
Lordship
's Pardon; he told them resolutely, 
H
 would die before he would do it, or any thing where¦by he should acknowledge him his Prelate.
 Th
 
Arch-Bishop
 perceiving that he was not to be ter¦rified into a compliance, ordered him to b
 turned out of the Church; the 
Caçanar
 to


 him, 
He would not be turned out of a Church where he had more to do than he had;
 upon this the whole Church was all in an uproar, some striving to keep him in the Church, and others to thrust him out, but the 
Arch-Bishop
's Party being the stronger, after a great disturbance, turned out he was.


The Night following several 
Caçanares
 and others, abjured the Patriarch of 
Babylon,
 and were reconciled to the Church of 
Rome
 at the 
Arch-Bishop
's Lodgings, which were over the Church. After which the 
Arch-Bishop
 was re∣solved either to make the 
Arch-Deacon
 bend, or to break with him totally; and so having all his Converts together, without whose advise he told them he would never do any thing; he de∣clared to them that he could no longer bear with the 
Arch-Deacon
's Rebellion, and was therefore determined to depose him, and put another in his place, naming one 
Thomas Curia
 a near Kins∣man of the 
Arch-Deacon
's, to be his Successor. They all owned that His 
Grace
 had great reason to be angry with the 
Arch-Deacon;
 but yet see∣ing he was but a young Man, and had had the ill luck to be in the hands of bad Counsellors, they intreated His 
Grace,
 before he declared his place void, to allow them some time to admonish him in, and to try whether they could not per∣swade him to Conformity; for which they desi∣red but twenty days, promising, that if he did not submit within the time, that they would never own him more, but would submit to any

 
Arch-Deacon
 that His 
Grace
 should set over them. Next day they sent six to treat with him, who, tho' they took a great deal of pains to perswade him to submit himself to the 
Arch-Bishop,
 could not prevail with him to do it.


On 
Easter-Eve
 the 
Arch-Bishop
 had a second Ordination, whereat he Ordained a great many that had been hindred by the 
Regedores
 from coming to the first. The same day 
Francisco Roz,
 the 
Jesuite,
 who was afterwards made Bi∣shop of the 
Serra
 by the Pope, came to wait upon the 
Arch-Bishop,
 who, after 
Mass,
 told him, 
That he could not believe he was in
 Carturte, 
where, not many Months ago, having a mind to say
 Mass, 
he was forced to have the Church doors opened to him by the Queen's
 Regedor, 
and where, when he eleva∣ted the Sacrament, the People all shut their Eyes, that they might not see it; and beat one of his Scho∣lars for having named the
 Pope 
in his Prayer's; and when he shewed them an Image of our
 Lady, 
cried out, 
Away with that filthiness, we are Christians, and for that reason do not adore Idols or Pa∣gods.


On 
Easter-day
 the 
Arch-Bishop
 intended to have a most solemn 
Procession,
 which the 
Heathens
 having notice of, were resolved either to hinder or disturb it; but finding they were not strong enough to do the former, by reason of the 
Re∣gedore
's guarding the 
Arch-Bishop
 as he did, they hired the most infamous Sorcerer of the whole Country to kill the 
Arch-Bishop
 in the 
Procession,
 which he undertook to do with a Charm that

 had never failed him, but as he begun to do his 
Tricks
 in the 
Procession,
 he was seized on and sent to Prison, and a Currier was immediately dispatched away to the Queen to acquaint her with what had been done: The Queen straight∣ways sent back an Order, that he should be put on the 
Caloete,
 which is a sharp Stake fastned in the Ground, which being stuck thorow the Body of the Malefactor, he dies thereon in great tor∣ment. But the 
Arch-Bishop
 would not give way to his being punished so, but condemned him to greater punishment, in sending him to 
Cochim
 to Row in the Gallies as long as he lived, which shews how great the 
Arch-Bishop
's Power, how∣ever he came by it, was at 
Carturte,
 where he made his first great Conversion.


When the Morning-Service was over, the 
Arch-Bishop
 was invited by the 
Caçanares
 to the 
Nercha,
 which is a Feast kept in the Church on certain days, all the Christians that are present sitting down to it. The Bishop, if present, craves the Blessing, and in his absence, the eldest Priest of the Church. The Bishop has one half of the Provision, the Priests a quarter, and the People a quarter among them. In many Churches there are certain Rents dedicated to the maintenance of those Feasts, which seem to be the same with the Apostolical 
Agapae
 or 
Love-Feasts,
 I do not know but St. 
Paul
 might allude to this double Portion that the Bishop has at these Feasts, when he saith, 
That they who rule well, and labour in the Word and Doctrine, are

 worthy of double Honour;
 and the rather because he immediately subjoyns, 
Thou shalt not muzzle the Ox that treadeth out the Corn,
 &c. Besides it is evident from St. 
Cyprian,
 34 
Ep.
 to his Church of 
Carthage,
 that the Clergy were said to be Honoured, according to the proportion they had of the Publick Offerings where speak∣ing of 
Aurelius
 and 
Cellerinus,
 two Confessors, he writes, 
Presbyterii honorem designasse nos illis jam sciatis, & sportulis iisdem cum Presbyteris honorentur, & divisiones mensurnas aequatis quanti∣tatibus partiuntur.


The 
Arch-Bishop
 being tired with the Service of the day, desired to be excused assisting at the 
Nercha;
 nevertheless he had his double Portion sent home. It was a great branch of 
Figs,
 and several Cakes made of 
Rice
 and 
Honey,
 with several other Dishes dressed 
a la Mode de Malabar.


In the Evening the 
Arch-Bishop
 went and vi∣sited all the Sick in the Town, and gave them both Money and Ghostly Counsel, the People imagining that this was the common Practice of all the 
Roman
 Prelates, began to cry them up to the Skies, as much more humble and charita∣ble than the 
Chaldean
 Bishop.


On 
Easter-Tuesday
 the 
Arch-Bishop
 went out to 
Nagpili,
 a Church about a quarter of a League from 
Carturte,
 where having Preached, he confir∣med a great many, and reconciled several 
Caça∣nares
 to the 
Roman
 Church. By the way, it is something strange too, how the 
Arch-Bishop,
 tho' he was able to School their Kings and 
Regedores,


 who all spoke 
Portugueze,
 should be so powerful a Preacher as the 
Portugueze
 make him to have been among the 
Malavars,
 considering that he nei∣ther knew a word of their Language, nor they of his.


Next day the 
Arch-Bishop
 set Sail for 
Molan∣durte,
 where, when he arrived, he found the People much changed from what they were, when he was there last, for they had shut the Church doors against him, neither did there so much as one single Person appear to receive him at the place where he was to Land, which was a quarter of a League from the Town.


The 
Arch-Bishop
 understanding how things were ashoar, did not offer to Land for fear of raising a Tumult, but wrote away immediately to the Governour of 
Cochim,
 to send the King of 
Cochim
's chief 
Regedor
 to him before 
Mo∣landurte.
 The King, tho' he did not love to hear of the Christians of St. 
Thomas,
 submitting them∣selves to the 
Arch-Bishop,
 being very sensible, if they were once brought under 
Portugueze
 Bishops, it would not be long before they would be entirely under the Crown of 
Portugal
 too, by which means he should lose 50000 of the best Soldiers in his Kingdom; yet at the same time he appear∣ed very zealous to promote that work, having more than once Commanded all his Christian Subjects in all things to do what the 
Arch-Bishop
 would have them, and accordingly when the Go∣vernour sent him word that the 
Arch-Bishop
 desi∣red to speak with the chief 
Regedor
 at 
Molandurte,
 he immediately ordered him to go and wait on him.




When the 
Regedor
 was come, the 
Arch-Bishop
 complained to him of the vexation his Master had given the Christians of 
Molandurte,
 for no other reason but for the kind reception they had given him when he was there last. The 
Regedor
 endeavoured to palliate the matter, and promised to acquaint his Master with what the 
Arch-Bishop
 had told him, 
Who, if any thing were amiss,
 he said, 
would be sure to redress it, and to give his
 Grace 
satisfaction.
 The 
Arch-Bishop
 here took him up short, and told him, 
That he ex∣pected no kindness from his Master, since he had de∣nied him so small a favour, as to order the Mus∣quets that were lodged in the Quire of the Church, to be removed to a proper place, which, tho' he had faithfully promised to do, yet he understood the Mus∣quets were there still.
 The 
Regedor
 told him, 
The
 Regedor 
of the Place, and not his Master, was to blame for that, who, to his knowledge, was ordered to have done it.


Upon this the 
Arch-Bishop
 and 
Regedor
 went to Church together, where the 
Regedor,
 in his hear∣ing, commanded all the Christians of the place, in the King's Name, to do whatsoever the 
Arch-Bishop
 should command them. But, tho' he is said, at the same time to have whispered some in the Ear, That the King would rather that they should adhere to their 
Arch-Deacon,
 and their old Customs, than submit to the 
Arch-Bishop,
 yet that did not appear in the sudden change that was wrought in their Carriage, by what the 
Regedor
 had told them publickly; for they

 who but the day before would not so much as endure to see the 
Arch-Bishop,
 were, without any other Argument, reconciled to the Church of 
Rome,
 and him the next day.


From 
Molandurte
 the 
Arch-Bishop
 went a se∣cond time to 
Diamper,
 where the chief 
Regedor,
 according to his promise, met him again. The 
Arch-Bishop
 complained to him of the 
Regedor
 of the place, who had not only hindred the 
Christians
 from coming at him, but encouraged several 
Heathens
 to deride and threaten him; as the chief 
Regedor
 was offering to excuse his Bro∣ther, the 
Arch-Bishop
 interrupted him, and strik∣ing the 
Cane
 he had in his hand three times against the Ground, bid him in a great fury not 
to offer to speak to him, for that he knew his Heart well enough, and that he bore an ill will to all Christians; but there's another,
 said he, 
I blame more than you, and that's your Master, who, notwithstanding his being Brother in Arms to the King of
 Portugal, 
suffers me to be abused in his Country; but you may tell your Master from me, that the King of
 Portu∣gal 
shall know how I have been used by him, and that it will not be long before he shall smart for it.
 The 
Regedor
 desiring to appease him, did assure his 
Grace, That his Master knew nothing of what had been done to him at
 Diamper; 
and that so soon as he was acquainted with it, he would be sure to make Examples of all those that had any way af∣fronted his
 Grace. This put the 
Arch-Bishop
 in a greater Passion than he was in before; he said, 
This was all Trick, and that he had treated too

 often with Kings, and knew their Tempers too well to be made believe, that they would not see themselves obeyed when they had a mind to it.


The 
Regedor
 assured him a second time, that his Master always had, and always would favour his designs in the 
Serra, I shall quickly know that,
 said the Arch-Bishop, 
for if you be sincere, you will presently call all the Christians together, and Command them, in the King's Name to acknow∣ledge me as their Prelate, and to unite themselves to the Church of
 Rome. The 
Regedor
 promised to do it presently, and having called all the Christians together, commanded them before the 
Arch-Bishop
 on pain of the King's high displeasure, to obey the 
Arch-Bishop
 in all things, assuring them withal, that this was His Majesty's Will, and therefore they should give no credit to any that should whisper the contrary to them; and thus, by Hectoring and Bribing of Kings and their 
Regedores,
 the 
Arch-Bishop
 made both sudden and great Conversions.


Having dismissed the 
Regedor,
 the 
Arch-Bishop
 gave them a Sermon, and commanded them to come to Church next Morning to be confirmed by him. Next day after the Confirmation, he told them, 
That he had Excommunicated and De∣posed the
 Arch-Deacon, 
as a Rebel to the
 Pope, 
who is Christ's Vicar on Earth; and that he told them of it on purpose that they might have no more Communication with such a Rebel, but might ac∣knowledge him for their Prelate.
 The People seemed to be satisfied with what he had done,

 and to blame the 
Arch-Deacon
 for his obstinacy. In the Evening he visited the Sick, and gave large Alms to the Widows and Orphans of the Town, telling them withal, that what he did was their Prelate's duty, and not to take Money from them as their former Bishops had done; but he forgot to tell them, that whereas their former Prelates had lived altogether upon Alms, having no settled Revenues to maintain them, by reason of their living under Princes who were 
Infidels,
 that he had above 20000 Crowns a Year in Rents that were certain. Besides, by having represented what he was doing in the 
Serra,
 as a great Service to the Crown, he had the Command of the Publick Treasure at 
Goa,
 which was never so great as at this time; the Viceroy 
Don Matthias de Albuquerque
 having in the Year 1597 left 80000 Ducats, and an im∣mense Summ in Jewels therein.


This 
Trick,
 for it deserves no better Name, together with his Hectoring of Kings and their 
Regedores
 as he did, made a great many People wish themselves under 
Portugueze
 Prelates, who, they saw, would not suffer their Princes to Ty∣rannize over them, but would espouse all their Quarrels, and defend them in their Rights, which was what the 
Chaldean
 Prelates were not able to do.


The 
Arch-Bishop
 now having by the foresaid Methods brought three such considerable places, as 
Carturte, Molandurte,
 and 
Diamper,
 besides se∣veral small Villages, under his Obedience; and

 being also sure of all the Churches that are in the Kingdom of 
Porca, Gundara, Marca,
 and 
Batimena,
 whose Kings had already Commanded all their Subjects to obey him in every thing: The 
Arch-Deacon
 hearing how things went, began to be sensible, that it would not be possible for him to contend with so powerful an Adversary much longer; and that he must therefore, either sub∣mit or be sent a Prisoner to 
Portugal,
 the 
Arch-Bishop
 having so blocked the 
Serra
 up to prevent a 
Chaldean
 Bishop's coming thither, that it was not possible for him to make his escape, if he had a mind to run his Country rather than renounce his Religion.


The 
Arch-Bishop
 being informed by a 
Caçanar,
 that the 
Arch-Deacon
 was in great perplexity what he had best to do, writ him a long Letter, wherein among other things he cited him 
to ap∣pear before the Judgment-seat of God, to answer for the Souls that were now burning in Hell, by his ha∣ving kept them from being reconciled to the
 Roman 
Church, out of which there is no Salvation.
 To which Letter the 
Arch-Deacon
 returned an answer in a strain quite different from what he had writ in formerly.


Before this Letter came to his hand, the 
Arch-Bishop
 having done his work at 
Diamper,
 was sailed to 
Narame,
 a considerable Village of Chri∣stians, which he found all in Arms, having all bound themselves with an Oath never to forsake their Religion and 
Arch-Deacon,
 but to defend them with the last drop of their Blood; and so

 when the 
Arch-Bishop
 was ready to Land to go to Church, they called to him to stay where he was; for besides that, the Church doors were shut, there was not one Person among them, who would have any Communication with him. Whereupon the 
Arch-Bishop,
 according to his Custom, sent immediately to the 
Regedor
 of the Country, which also belonged to the King of 
Cochim
 to come aboard, for that he had some∣thing to say to him.


What made the 
Arch-Bishop,
 making such great use of Kings and 
Regedores,
 who were all 
Infidels
 in the Conversion of these Christians to the 
Roman
 Church, the more unpardonable, was, that but a little before he had made the 
Arch-Deacon's interesting of
 Infidel 
Princes in the Af∣fairs of
 Christianity, with which they were not to be suffered to meddle, the chief Article for which he deserved to be deposed.


The 
Regedor
 being come aboard, the 
Arch-Bishop
 spoke to him to go ashoar, and do as much for him at 
Narame,
 as the chief 
Regedor
 had done at 
Molandurte
 and 
Diamper.
 The 
Regedor
 promised him he would, but when he came ashoar to cause the Church to be opened, there was no body left in the Town; for the Chri∣stians hearing of his coming, and what his busi∣ness was, had all hid themselves, that so they might not be constrained to break the Oath they had made so lately. The 
Arch-Bishop,
 when the 
Regedor
 brought him word how it was, was in a great Passion with him, and would not be per∣swaded

 but that he had underhand fomented this division. But however these Christians came to be incensed against the 
Arch-Bishop,
 it is certain they were to that degree, that they denied him fresh Provisions for his Money, so that he was forc'd to live upon the 
Rice
 and 
Bisket
 that was aboard for some days.


While the 
Arch-Bishop
 was in this Diet, the 
Arch-Deacon
's Letter came to his hand, the sub∣stance whereof was, 
That he was overcome at last by the irresistable force of Truth, and was resolved to submit himself to the
 Roman 
Church, intreating his
 Grace 
to pardon all the by past Errors of an igno∣rant Son.


The 
Arch-Bishop
 tho' he was extream glad at the news, would not discover that he was, but told the 
Caçanar
 that brought it very gravely, 
That he had been so often deceived by the
 Arch-Deacon, 
that he did not know how to trust him, and that he never would any more, before he had subscribed the Ten following Articles.


I. 
That he abjured all the Errors of
 Nesto∣rius, 
and of all his Followers,
 Diodorus 
and
 The∣odorus (who, by the way, were both in their Graves before 
Nestorius
 was ever heard of) 
ac∣knowledging them to be cursed
 Hereticks, 
that are burning in Hell for their Errors.


II. 
That he should confess there was but one Christian Law.


III. 
That he should subscribe the Confession of Faith, which he sent to him from
 Goa, 
when he made him Governour of the Bishoprick.


IV. 
That he should deliver all the Books of the Diocess to be amended or burnt according as they deserved.


V. 
That he should swear Obedience to the
 Pope, 
as St.
 Peter
's Successor, and Christ's Vicar upon Earth, and the Supream Head of all Christians, and of all Bishops, Arch-Bishops, Primates and Patri∣archs in the World, so that none can be saved out of his obedience.


VI. 
That he should curse the Patriarch of
 Baby∣lon, 
as a
 Nestorian 
Heretick and Schismatick, and swear never to obey him any more in any matter, nor to have any further Commerce or Communica∣tion with him by Letters or otherwise.


VII. 
That he should swear never to receive any Bishop or Prelate in the
 Serra, 
but what should be sent thither by the
 Pope, 
and to obey whomsoever he sent.


VIII. 
That he should swear to acknowledge and obey him for his
 true Prelate, 
as being made so by the
 Pope.


IX. 
That he should pass
 Olas 
or Provisions for the Assembling of a Diocesan Synod, to treat of all such matters, as the Arch-Bishop should think fit, and swear to be present at it himself.


X. 
That he should accompany the
 Arch-Bishop 
peaceably, wheresoever he went, without any thing of Guards, and should go along with him in his Galley to all the Churches he had a mind to visit.


These Articles being made and signed by the 
Arch-Bishop,
 he delivered them to the 
Caçanar,
 together with a Letter, wherein he bid the 
Arch-Deacon,
 if he was not fully resolved to subscribe them, allowing him but twenty days to do it in, not to appear before him; and being wil∣ling to secure himself of the fidelity of the Bearer, he obliged him, before he dismiss'd him, to swear obedience to the 
Roman
 Church, ma∣king him swear also to return, and never to have any thing more to do with the 
Arch-Deacon,
 in case he refused to sign the Ar∣ticles.


Having dismissed this Messenger, the 
Arch-Bishop
 returned to 
Cochim,
 where his main bu∣siness was to get the Governour of the place to joyn with him, to press the King of 
Cochim
 to assist him cordially in his design of uniting the Church of St. 
Thomas
 to that of 
Rome;
 and while he was satisfying the Governour of

 what Importance such an Union would be to the 
Portugueze
 Interest in the 
Indies,
 which was what he himself had all along as much in his Eye, as the Governour could have for his Heart: The King having heard of his being in Town, came very opportunely to pay him a visit, in which, before they parted, the King renewed his pro∣mise to him of commanding all his Christian Subjects to obey him in all things; with which promise the Arch-Bishop returned well satisfied to 
Cranganor,
 in order to settle the Affair of the Synod.


The day after his arrival there, he had Letters brought him by a 
Patamar,
 or Currier, from the King of 
Samorim,
 advising him of the King of 
Cochim
's having begun a War upon the 
Caimal
 or Prince of 
Corugeira
 his Allie, to which if a stop were not put suddenly, it would necessarily oblige him to withdraw his Army from before 
Cunahle,
 which was what the King of 
Cochim
 aimed at. So soon as the 
Arch-Bishop
 had read these Letters, he dispatched a Currier away im∣mediately after the King of 
Cochim,
 who was already on his March, desiring him not to make a War upon the 
Caimal
 till after 
Cunahle
 was taken, since it could not be done without di∣verting the 
Samorim
 from the Siege of 
Cunahle,
 who was then before it, expecting the return of the 
Portugueze Armada,
 which would be with him in the beginning of the Spring, he writ also to the Governour of 
Cochim,
 and the Commissioners of the 
Treasury
 to come to

 him; whom, after some discourse about the bu∣siness, he ordered to go after the King of 
Cochim,
 and to stop him in his March.


Before the 
Arch-Bishop
 left 
Cranganor,
 he recei∣ved a Letter from the 
Arch-Deacon,
 wherein he wrote to him, 
That, tho' he was ready to subscribe all the Articles he had sent him, yet that it was not possible for him to wait upon His
 Grace 
in so short a time as he had fixed.


The 
Arch-Bishop
 understanding that the King of 
Mangate,
 in whose Country the 
Arch-Deacon
 was at that time, was very much against his submitting to him, sent a Servant of his own with a splendid Retinue to him, to let him know, 
That, if he should offer to hinder the Arch-Deacon from coming to him, the King of
 Portugal 
should know of it, who was resolved to revenge all the wrongs that were done to him in the
 Serra 
to the utmost of his Power.
 The King, who had too great a dependance on the 
Portuguezes,
 to pro∣voke one of the 
Arch-Bishop
's Character and Spi∣rit, sent him word, 
That the
 Arch-Deacon 
migh
 wait upon him when he pleased for all him, an
 that he never had any thoughts of hindring him
 For all that, the 
Arch-Deacon
 did not come having in truth no Stomach to the morsel th
 
Arch-Bishop
 had prepared for him. Whereupon th
 
Arch-Bishop
 sent a couple of 
Jesuites
 to him, t
 let him know, 
That that was his last admonitio
 and that if he did not come to him in eight da


 he would infallibly depose him and put another in his place.


The Governour and Commissioners having prevailed with the King of 
Cochim
 to desist from the War; the King, in his return home, resolved to take 
Cranganor
 in his way. The 
Arch-Bishop
 having received advice that he was ready to Land, was civiler to him than he had been for∣merly, and went to the 
Caiz,
 of the Castle to meet him, and after some Complements had passed on both sides, they went together to an 
Hermitage
 that was not far off. Where they discoursed alone for a considerable time; after which the King called in his chief 
Regedor,
 and several of his Nobles, and the 
Arch-Bishop,
 the Captain of the Castle, and some of his own Servants. Before whom the 
Arch-Bishop
 thanked His 
Highness
 for having desisted from the War of 
Corugeira,
 promising him thanks also from the King of 
Portugal
 for it, but told him withal, 
That this must not hinder him from acquainting His Highness with his being much dissatisfied at his having used him so as he had done.
 The King desired His 
Lordship to tell for what he was displeased, there being nothing that he was so desi∣rous of, as to satisfie him in all things.
 The 
Arch-Bishop
 told him with a frowning Coun∣tenance, 
That when his Brother in Arms, the King of
 Portugal, 
sent him into the
 Serra, 
he ex∣pected he should have been defended there by His
 Highness, 
and not only so but that he would have assisted him to the utmost in the Pious design he

 came about; in confidence of which Protection and Assistance it was that he left
 Goa 
to come into those Parts, but that he had found himself misera∣bly deceived, there not being a Prince in
 Malabar, 
in whose Dominions he had been
 (and he had been in the most of them) 
but what had shewed him more favour than His
 Highness, 
who had loaded some of his Christian Subjects with Taxes, for no other reason, but for having given him a kind Reception.
 Here the chief 
Regedor
 interposed, and desired him 
to let His
 Majesty 
know what the Affronts or Injuries were that he had received in any part of his Dominions.
 The 
Arch-Bishop
 re∣plied with great passion, 
Sir, There is no Body knows them all better than you do, since they were done before your Eyes; however, you were pleased to wink at them; nay, I do not know but you might have a hand in procuring them; and therefore pray do not you offer to conceal them from your Master.
 The King protested he had never heard of any Injury or Affront that had been put upon His 
Lordship
 in any part of his Territories. The 
Arch-Bishop,
 without any Ceremony, told him, 
It was not so, for that he himself had ac∣quainted His
 Highness 
several times by Letter, of what he suffered from his Subjects, but could never have them remedied as he expected, and as they ought to have been by one that owed so much to the
 Portugueze 
as His
 Highness 
did, wherefore,
 said he, 
for the future I'll complain of none but my own King, for having sent me from a Palace at
 Goa, 
where I lived at my ease and in splendor, to wander

 about the
 Serra, 
and be abused as I have been.
 This does not agree very well with what is said before of his going into the 
Serra
 purely out of Zeal and Devotion, and contrary to all that the 
Viceroy
 and others could say or do to hinder him; but upon his upbraiding the King with his not having answered his expectations, nor the obliga∣tions which he owed to the 
Portuguezes,
 who, of a petty Prince, had made him a great Monarch; the King ask'd him, as well he might, 
what his
 Lordship 
meant,
 desiring him 
to instance in what particulars he had been thus aggrieved;
 whereupon the 
Arch-Bishop
 told him of what had been done at 
Molandurte
 and 
Diamper,
 and charged him with having encouraged the 
Arch-Deacon
 in his Rebellion, to whom he had granted several 
Ollas
 or Provisions, without having granted him one as yet. The King told him he would treat with the Governour of 
Cochim
 about an 
Olla
 for his 
Lordship.
 This put the 
Arch-Bishop
 in a much greater passion than he was in before: for he reckoned the King slighted him, in saying he would treat with the Governour about a thing that was his immediate concern; whereupon he told his 
Majesty, That it had been always his custom to put him off with delays, that for his own part he desired none of his
 Ollas; 
and that the Christians of St.
 Thomas, 
if they had been true Christians, would never have suffered their Kings to have meddled with matters of Religion; but especially being
 Infidels 
and
 Idolaters, 
as he was, and who not knowing the true God, Worshipp'd Stocks and Stones, and Devils in∣stead

 of him: That for his part he could not but wonder at His
 Highness
's taking upon him to fa∣vour the Patriarch of
 Babylon 
against the
 Pope, 
who understood nothing of the difference between them; That His
 Highness 
would do well therefore to leave his Christian Subjects to him, who was their true Prelate, and not to meddle with matters he did not understand: That as for the
 Arch-Deacon 
he had determined that if he did not come and submit to him by next
 Saturday, 
to turn him out of his place, and put another into it, and that he could not but look upon the
 Arch-Deacon 
as an ill Christian, if for no other reason, for that of having communi∣cated the Affairs of
 Christianity 
to His
 Highness, 
whom all the World know to be an Infidel.
 The King was desperately angry at what the 
Arch-Bishop
 had said of his 
Idols;
 however being a very wise Prince he did not touch upon that string, but told him, His 
Lordship
 might expect the 
Arch-Deacon
 one 
Saturday,
 two 
Saturdays,
 and three 
Saturdays.
 The 
Arch-Bishop
 took the words out of his Mouth, and striking his 
Cane
 against the Ground in great Fury, said, 
I will not expect him one, two, and three
 Saturdays, 
but if I live I will depose him if he does not come and submit before the next, and that he deserved to be Deposed, if for no other reason, for his having interested His
 High∣ness 
in the concerns of
 Christianity, 
notwithstand∣ing he knew him to be an
 Infidel. The King, who could not help standing amazed at the 
Arch-Bishop
 condemning the 
Arch-Deacon
 so much for endeavouring to interest him in a thing which

 he himself at the same time was swaggering him into, perceiving that the more they talked, the 
Arch-Bishop
 grew the more furious, and talked the louder, put on a pleasant Countenance, and told him with great sweetness, 
That there was nothing he had ever studied so much as to please His Lordship.
 With this the 
Arch-Bishop
's Passion be∣ing something mitigated, he replied, 
It was what he had always expected from His
 Highness, 
and that he hoped he would not wonder to see him put into so great a Passion, in a case wherein Christianity was so much concerned, for the least of whose Interest he was bound in duty to sacrifice his Head.
 The King told him, 
That if he knew of any that sought after his Head, they should not keep their own long upon their Shoulders.
 After they had made an end of this hot business, they talked for some time of indifferent matters; and when the King was for going, the 
Arch-Bishop
 accompanied him to the 
Caiz,
 where they are said to have parted very good Friends; which if they did, the King con∣sidering how he had been treated, was certainly the best natured Prince that ever wore a Crown, and in a very substantial point a much better Christian than the 
Arch-Bishop.


This rancounter was of no small advantage to the 
Arch-Bishop
 in the reduction of that 
Christi∣anity;
 for the King fearing to provoke one of the 
Arch-Bishop
's Character and Temper, so soon as he had left him, writ away immediately to the 
Arch-Deacon
 to come and submit himself to the 
Arch-Bishop,
 he writ also to the King of 
Mangate,


 in case he found the 
Arch-Deacon
 not willing to do it, to oblige him to it.


Upon the receipt of this Letter the 
Arch-Dea∣con
 sent away immediately to the 
Arch-Bishop,
 to let him know, That he was ready to throw him∣self at his 
Grace
's Feet, and to obey all his Com∣mands, and that within the time he had prefixed; but withal, desired to wait upon him some where else than in 
Cranganor,
 which being a Fortress belonging to the 
Portuguezes,
 he was afraid to trust himself in, there being nothing that he dreaded so much as being some time or other kidnapped for 
Goa.
 However the 
Arch-Bishop
 complyed so far with his Fears as to order him to meet him at the 
Jesuites
-College in 
Vaipicotta.
 They met first in the Church, where the 
Arch-Deacon
 threw himself at the 
Arch-Bishop
's Feet, with the words of the 
Prodigal
 in his mouth, 
Fa∣ther, I have sinned against Heaven, and against thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son. I do humbly beg Pardon for all my Errors, which have been great.
 The 
Arch-Bishop
 lifting him up and embracing him tenderly, told him, all that was past was forgot; and that God's Mercy in reducing him to the 
Catholick Church
 was greater than the Malice of the Devil, which had been the cause of his returning no sooner, that he would certainly have that great Reward that is reserved in Heaven for those that bring so many Souls to the purity of the Faith, as he was confi∣dent he would do by his Example; that he would therefore have him subscribe the Profession of

 Faith and ten Articles immediately. The 
Arch-Deacon
 beg'd to speak one word first with His 
Grace
 in private, promising, after that to do whatsoever His 
Grace
 should command him; and being alone, he told him, That if His 
Grace
 would have it so, he was ready to subscribe the Profession and Ar∣ticles publickly, tho', with submission he thought it would be better if he would allow him to do it in private, for the sake of that Christianity who were not as yet so well instructed as they ought to be; but that before the meeting of the Synod, at which he promised to sign them publickly, he hoped to be able to prepare them for the recei∣ving of whatsoever should be therein determined, which he believed he should be able to do the more effectually, if they knew nothing of his having already submitted to the 
Roman Church.
 The 
Arch-Bishop
 answered, 
That notwithstanding a Profession of the Faith was by so much the better, as it was the more publick, nevertheless he so far approved of his Reason as to dispense with his ma∣king it openly.
 Whereupon they and the Jesuite 
Francisco Roz
 repaired to the 
Arch-Bishop
's Lodg∣ings, and having shut the doors, the 
Arch-Deacon
 kneeled down before a 
Crucifix
 that stood on the 
Arch-Bishop
's Table, and laying his hands upon the 
Missal,
 swore to the Ten Articles, and to the Profession of Faith, to which the 
Arch-Bishop
 obliged him to put his hand, to prevent his de∣nying it afterwards.


Next Morning all the 
Caçanares
 being called to∣gether, the 
Arch-Bishop
 acquainted them with his

 intention of calling a Synod very speedily, which they all agreed to. It was then debated where it should meet, some were for its being held at 
Angamale,
 the 
Metropolis
 of the Diocess, but the 
Arch-Bishop
 would not hear of its being held there for three Reasons; the first was, That the Christians of 
Angamale
 were the Christians of the whole Bishoprick that were most addicted to their old Religion, 
Secondly,
 It was not in the Domi∣nions of the King of 
Cochim,
 the Prince of 
Malabar
 that had the greatest dependence upon the 
Portu∣guezes;
 And 
Lastly,
 Because it was at too great a distance from the 
Portugueze
 Garrison of 
Cochim.
 It was carried therefore that it should be held in the Town of 
Diamper,
 which was but a little way from 
Cochim,
 and should begin on the 20th. of 
June,
 being the 3d. 
Sunday
 after 
Whitsuntide.


In pursuance whereof the 
Arch-Bishop
 and 
Arch-Deacon
 did both issue forth their 
Ollas,
 command∣ing all Priests and Procurators of the People, who were four from every Town, to assemble toge∣ther at the Town of 
Diamper,
 on the 20th. of 
June
 next, there to celebrate a Diocesan Synod. The 
Ollas
 bore date the 11th. of 
May,
 so that there were six Weeks allowed for the preparing of business, which the 
Arch-Bishop
 made good use of.


Before the 
Arch-Bishop
 left 
Vaipicotta,
 the 
Caimal
 of 
Angamale,
 who was called the 
black King
 of 
Malabar,
 came to give him a visit: The 
Arch-Bishop
 received him kindly, and at parting pre∣sented him with some pieces of very rich Cloath;

 which was what he went well furnished withal from 
Goa,
 having laid out 18000 
Pardaos
 in Goods, to make Presents of in the 
Serra.
 The 
Caimal,
 who was a boisterous and bloody Prince, was so well pleased with his Present, that he pro∣mised the 
Arch-Bishop
 to see him obeyed in all things.


After which the 
Arch-Bishop
 returned to 
Cran∣ganor,
 where he composed the Decrees of the Synod, which were all writ with his own Hand, word for word as they are published. As soon as he had finished them he had them translated out of 
Portugueze
 into 
Malavar.
 He likewise Consecrated there a Stone Altar for every Church in the 
Serra,
 which was what they all wanted.


What remained to be done, after having en∣gaged all the Neighbouring Princes, and their 
Regedors
 to assist him, was to secure the 
Major
 Vote in the Synod; and in order thereunto he Ordained no fewer than fifty Priests on 
Trinity-Sunday,
 in the Church of 
Paru,
 which fifty being added to the thirty eight he had Ordained but a little before at 
Diamper,
 and to those he had Ordained at 
Carturte,
 who are said to have been many, must make up at least two thirds of the Priests that were present at the Synod, who in all were but 153. of which two thirds the 
Arch-Bishop
 was secure, having before he Or∣dained them, made them abjure their old Reli∣gion, and subscribe the Creed of 
Pius
 IV.


He was also industrious to secure to himself the Votes of several of the most considerable among

 the 
Procurators,
 by making them great Presents, giving to one of them a Cross set with 
Diamonds
 of great value, as he did another of equal price, to an old 
Caçanar,
 who had been a great Com∣panion of Arch-Bishop 
Mar Abraham.
 Upon which, and the other Precautions made use of by the 
Arch-Bishop
 to compass his ends in the Synod, Father 
Simon
 in his 109 Pag. of his 
Historie Critique,
 makes the following judicious reflection: 
All that these methods have hitherto produced, serves only to let the World see by what means the
 Roman 
Religion has been established in the
 East, 
which he that knows will not wonder, that all the re-unions which have been made with those People we call
 Schismaticks 
in those Parts, have been so short lived.


On the 9th. of 
June
 the 
Arch-Bishop
 accompa∣nied with six 
Jesuites
 and his Confessor, who were all Divines, and several 
Caçanares,
 arrived at 
Diamper,
 where he immediately erected a 
Junto
 of eight of the most popular 
Caçanares,
 before whom he laid the Decrees, desiring their opini∣on of them; and when they came to consider the Decrees relating to manners, he called four of the gravest of the 
Procurators
 also to be present at the Examination of them; after some Debates the Decrees were all agreed to by the 
Junto,
 which, for that reason, was given out to be the Author of them.


On the 20th. of 
June
 1
99. the Synod was opened, at which solemnity were present the 
Dean
 and 
Chapter
 of 
Cochim,
 with their whole 
Quire,
 as also the Governour, the Commissioners of the

 
Treasury,
 and the Chamber of the same City, and several other 
Portuguezes
 of Quality.


I will detain the Reader no longer from the perusal of the Synod it self, in which he is not to wonder if he meets with the whole mass of 
Popery,
 considering that all its Decrees were com∣posed by a Popish 
Arch-Bishop
 who assembled it on purpose to establish the 
Roman
 Religion in the 
Serra;
 in the doing whereof, tho' he was in∣strumental in letting the World know more of the Orthodoxy of that Apostolical Church, than its like they would ever have known of it other∣wise, we have reason to bless Providence, but none at all to thank him for it, who intended nothing less than the making of such a happy dis∣covery.

THE PREFACE TO THE READER.


THE following Synod is printed at the end of the History of 
Dom Frey Aleixo de Menezes,
 Archbishop of 
Goa
's Visitation of the Christians of Saint 
Thomas
 in the 
Serra
 or Mountain of 
Malabar,
 made immediately after the Celebration, and in pursuance of the Order of the said Sy∣nod; the History of which Visitation was compos'd by 
Antonio de Gouvea,
 an 
Austin Friar,
 and Reader of Divinity in 
Goa,
 at the Command of the Provincial of his Order in 
Portugal.
 It contains divers things that are fit for all Protestants to know; namely, the rude and boisterous Methods, that the 
Roman
 Prelates, where they may do it with safety, make use of in the Reduction of those

 they call 
Hereticks;
 together with clear Con∣firmations of the Truth of what we meet with in the Fourteenth, and other Decrees of the Third Action of this Synod; to wit, That the Three great Doctrines of Popery, the 
Pope
's 
Supremacy, Transubstantiation,
 the 
Adoration of Images,
 were never believed nor practised at any time in this ancient Apo∣stolical Church; but, on the contrary, were rejected and condemned by her, and that in her Publick Offices. So that upon what we learn from this Synod and History, I think one may venture to say, That before the time of the late Reformation, there was no Church that we know of, no not that of the 
Vaudois,
 abating that one thing of her being infected with the Heresie of 
Nestorius,
 of which too she is cleared by one of the 
Roman
 Communion, that had so Few Er∣rors in Doctrine, as the Church of 
Ma∣labar.


If the Synod I here publish should be well received, as I have reason to hope it will, by all Protestants, and lovers of Truth, upon the account of the clear Discoveries

 it makes of the forementioned Popish Er∣rors, having never been at any time the Doctrines of the Universal Church, which we know is confidently affirmed, and much boasted of; and for further satisfaction in so important a Matter, the above-named History should be desired, I shall be rea∣dy to translate and publish it with all ex∣pedition, alone, and in the same Volume with this of the Synod; together with the best Account I can procure of the Church of 
Malabar,
 and the other Oriental Churches, that were never within the Bounds of the 
Roman
 Empire; for it is in those Churches that we are to expect to meet with the least of the Leaven of Popery.


As to the Synod, to prevent all surmises of its being a Piece either forged by some Protestant, or of no Authority in the Church of 
Rome,
 tho' set forth by a Member of her Communion; I have, together with the whole Title Page, which tells where, when, and by whom it was printed, translated and published all the 
Licences
 that it came out with: And if any should suspect the Trans∣lation,

 if they please, they may satisfie them∣selves of its Fidelity, by having recourse to the Original in the 
Bodleian Library
 at 
Ox∣ford;
 to which, as the safest, as well as no∣blest Repository of Books in the World, I design to give it.


I have here and there added some short Remarks upon some Passages, which will not, I hope, be unacceptable to the Rea∣der.








The DOCTRINES wherein the Church of 
Malabar
 agrees with the Church of 
En∣gland,
 and differs from that of 
Rome.




1.
 SHe condemns the Pope's Supremacy.


2.
 She affirms that the Church of 
Rome
 is fallen from the true Faith.


3.
 She denies Transubstantiation, or that Christ's Body and Blood are really and substantially in the Eucharist.


4.
 She condemns Images, and the Adoration of them as Idolatrous.


5.
 She makes no use of Oils in the Administration of Baptism.


6.
 She allows of no Spiritual Affinity.


7.
 She denies Purgatory.


8.
 She denies the necessity of Auricular Confession.


9.
 She knows nothing of Extream Ʋnction.


10.
 She allows her Priests to Marry as often as they have a mind, and Ordains such as have been mar∣ried three or four times, and to Widows, without any scruple.


11.
 She denies Matrimony to be a Sacrament.


12.
 She holds but two Orders, Priesthood, and Dia∣conate.


13.
 She Celebrates in Leavened Bread.


14.
 She Consecrates with Prayer.


15.
 She denies Confirmation to be a Sacrament.










In the Account that is given of the Doctrines of the Church of 
Malabar,
 in the Eighteenth Chapter of the First Book of the Visitation,


SHe is said, 1. Not to adore Images. 2. To hold but Three Sacraments, Baptism, the Eu∣charist, and Order. 3. To make no use of Oils. 4. To have had no Knowledge of Confirmation or Extream Unction. 5. To abhor Auricular Confession. 6. To hold many enormous Errors about the Eucharist, insomuch that the Author of the History saith, he is inclined to believe, that the 
Hereticks
 of our Times, meaning Pro∣testants, the revivers of all forgotten Errors, and Ignorances, might have had their Doctrine a∣bout the Eucharist from them. 7. To Ordain such as have been married several times, and to Widows, and to approve of her Priests marry∣ing as often as they have a mind. 8. That she abhors the Pope and the Church of 
Rome
 as Anti-Christian, in pretending to a Superiority and Ju∣risdiction over all other Churches.

I
 Have perused this Synod, and to me it appears to be a Work that deserves to be Printed; for besides the sound Doctrine contained therein, it will be of great Use and Conso∣lation to all, and very necessary to the extirpating of the Er∣rors, Schism, and Heresies sown by Hereticks, and parti∣cularly the 
Nestorians
 in the ancient Christianity, planted in the 
Indies
 by the Apostle St. 
Thomas.

THE PUBLICATION and CALLING OF THE SYNOD.


DOM 
Frey Aleixo de Menezes,
 by the mercy of God, and the Holy 
Roman
 See, Archbishop, Metropolitan of 
Goa,
 Pri∣mate of the 
Indies,
 and the Oriental Parts, 
&c.
 To the Reverend in Christ, Father 
George,
 Archdeacon of the Christians of St. 
Thomas
 in the 
Serra
 of the Kingdom of 
Malabar,
 and to all other Priests, Curates, Deacons and Subdeacons, and to all Towns, Villages, and Hamlets, and to all Chri∣stian People of the said Bishoprick, Health in our Lord Jesus Christ.


We give you all, and every one of you in parti∣cular to understand, that the most Holy Father Pope 
Clement VIII.
 our Lord Bishop of 
Rome,
 and Vi∣car of our Lord Jesus Christ upon earth, at this time presiding in the Church of God; having sent two

 Briefs directed to Ʋs, one of the 
27th.
 of 
Jan.
 in the Year 
1595,
 and the other of the 
21st.
 of the same Month, in the Year 
1597;
 in which, by virtue of his Pastoral Office, and that Ʋniversal Power be∣queathed to the Supream, Holy and Apostolical Chair of St. 
Peter
 over all the Churches in the World, by Jesus Christ the Son of God our Lord and Redeemer, he commanded us upon the death of the Archbishop 
Mar-Abraham,
 to take Possession of this Church and Bi∣shoprick, so as not to suffer any Bishop or Prelate coming from 
Babylon,
 to enter therein, as has been hitherto the Custom, all that come from thence being Schismaticks, Hereticks, and 
Nestorians,
 out of the Obedience of the Holy 
Roman
 Church, and Subject to the Patriarch of 
Babylon,
 the Head of the said Heresy; and to appoint a Governour or Apostolical Vicar to Rule the said Diocess both in Spirituals and Temporals, until such time as the Holy 
Roman
 Church shall provide it of a proper Pastor; which being read by us, we were desirous to execute the Apostolical Mandates with due Reverence and Obe∣dience; besides, that the same was incumbent on us of right (the said Church having no Chapter to take care of it during the vacancy of the See) as Metro∣politan and Primate of this and all the other Churches of the 
Indies,
 and the Oriental Parts.


But perceiving that our Mandate in that behalf had no effect, what we had ordered, not having been obeyed in the said Diocess, so that what our most Holy Father, the Bishop of 
Rome,
 had designed, was like to be frustrated, after having laboured therein for the space of two Years, Schism and Disobedience to

 the Apostolical See, having been so rooted in that Diocess for a great many Years, that the Inhabi∣tants thereof, instead of yielding Obedience to the Apostolical, and Our Mandates; on the contrary upon the intimation thereof, did daily harden themselves more and more, committing greater Offences against the Obedience due to the Holy 
Roman
 Church; af∣ter having commended the Matter to God, and or∣dered the same to be done through our whole Diocess, and after mature Advice, by which Methods the Apostolical Mandates might be best executed; and being also moved by the Piety of the People, and the Mercy God had shewn them in having preserved so many thousand Souls in the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, from the time that the Holy Apostle St. 
Tho∣mas
 had Preached to them until this day, notwith∣standing their having lived among so many Heathens, and been scattered in divers places, their Churches and all belonging to them, having been al∣ways subject to Idolatrous Kings and Princes, and incompassed with Idols and Pagods, and that with∣out holding any correspondence with any other Chri∣stians before the coming of the 
Portuguezes
 into these Parts; we being likewise desirous that the La∣bours of the Holy Apostle St. 
Thomas,
 which still remained among them, should not be lost for want of sound Doctrine; and that the Apostolical Mandates might not be frustrated, did determine, and having provided for the Government of our own Church during our absence, did prepare to go in Person to take Possession of the said Bishoprick, to see if by our Presence we might be able to reduce them to

 the Obedience of the Holy 
Roman
 Church, and purge out the Heresies and false Doctrines sown among them, and introduced by the Schismatical Prelates, and 
Nestorian
 Hereticks that had governed them under the Obedience of the Patriarch of 
Babylon;
 as also to call in and purge the Books containing those Heresies; and according to our Pastoral Du∣ty, so far as God should enable us, to Preach to them in Person the Catholick Truth.


Accordingly going into the said Bishoprick, we set a∣bout visiting the Churches thereof; but at that time Satan, the great Enemy of the good of Souls, having stirred up great Commotions, and much opposition against this our just intent, great numbers depart∣ing from us, and forming a Schism against the Holy 
Roman
 Church, after having passed through many troubles and dangers, out of all which God of his great mercy, not remembring our sins and evil deeds, was pleased to deliver us, and to grant us an intire Peace for the Merits of the glorious Apostle St. 
Thomas
 the Patron of this Christianity, but chiefly of his own great Clemency and Mercy, which makes, that 
he doth not delight in the death of a sinner, but rather that he should return and live;
 and by coming all to the light of the Truth, may joyn with us in the Confession of the Catholick Faith, approving our Doctrine and Intention, and submitting themselves to the Obedience of the Holy 
Roman
 Church; which being by us observed, after having returned Thanks to God, we thought fit, in order to the compassing and securing of all those good Effects, to assemble a 
Diocesan Synod
 in some com∣modious

 place near the middle of the said Diocess, there to Treat of all such Matters as are convenient for the honour of God, the exaltation of the Holy Catholick Faith and Divine Worship, the good of the Church, the extirpation of Vice, the Reforma∣tion of the Christians of the said Diocess, and the profit and peace of their Souls; to which end ha∣ving pitched upon the Town and Church of 
Diam∣per,


We do hereby let all the Inhabitants and Christi∣ans of the said Bishoprick, as well Ecclesiasticks as Laicks, of what State or Condition soever, to un∣derstand, that we do call and assemble a Diocesan Synod in the said Town of 
Diamper,
 on the 20th. of 
June
 of this present Year 
1599,
 being the Third 
Sunday
 after 
Whitsuntide;
 and do therefore, by Virtue of holy Obedience, and upon pain of Excom∣munication, 
latae Sententiae,
 Command the Reverend the Arch-Deacon of this Diocess, and all the other Priests of the same, that shall not be hindered by Age, or some other just Impediment, to be present in the said Town of 
Diamper,
 there with us to ce∣lebrate a 
Diocesan Synod
 conformable to the Holy Canons: And whereas by immemorial Custom, and a Right introduced into this Diocess from its Begin∣ning, and consented to by all the Infidel Kings of 
Malabar,
 the whole Government as it were, and the Cognizance of all Matters wherein Christians are a∣ny ways concerned, has belonged to the Church, and the Prelate thereof; and it having likewise been an ancient Custom in the same, to give an Account to the People of whatsoever has been ordained in

 the Church, in order to its being the better observed by all: We do therefore under the same Precept and Censure, command all Christians in all Towns and Villages of this Bishoprick; and where there are no Villages, all that use to assemble together at any Church as belonging to it, immediately upon this our Pleasure being intimated to them, to chuse Four of the most Honourable, Conscientious, and Ex∣perienced Persons among them, to come in their Name at the said time, to the said Synod, with sufficient Powers to Approve, Sign, Confirm, and Consult in their Name, so as to oblige themselves thereby to comply with whatsoever shall be deter∣mined in the Synod. And that these Commissioners may demand or propose whatsoever they shall judge to be of Importance to the Synod, and for the Spiri∣tual or Temporal Good of their People; We do grant free Liberty to all in this Diocess, as well Ecclesia∣sticks as Laicks, that have any Complaints, Grie∣vances, or Controversies about any such Matters as are decidable by the Prelate, or other Christians, to represent the same to the Synod; where they shall be heard with Patience, and have Justice done them according to the Sacred Canons, Customs, and lawful Ʋsages of the Country.


And whereas we are informed that there are se∣veral things in this Bishoprick which are the Causes of great Contentions, we do therefore not only give leave, but do also admonish and command all that are concerned in any such Matters, that forbearing all other ways that are prejudicial to Christiani∣ty,

 they do now make use of this just and holy way of putting an end to all their Debates: And since to bring all these things to a good issue the favour and assistance of God is necessary, from whom all good things do proceed, and without whom we can do nothing, wherefore to engage the Di∣vine Clemency by Prayer to be favourable to us, following the laudable Custom of the Holy Fathers, and Ancient Councils, we do Admonish, and in the Name of God earnestly request, all the faithful Christians of this Bishoprick, from this time for∣ward until the end of the Synod, to exercise them∣selves with a pure and clean heart, in Fasting, Alms, Prayer, and other works of Piety, instant∣ly beseeching God to enlighten the Ʋnderstandings of all that shall meet together, and so to enflame our Wills with Divine Love, that we may determine nothing but what is right, and may observe and comply with whatsoever shall be Decreed; taking for our Intercessor, our Lady the most Holy Vir∣gin 
Mary,
 of whose Praise and Honour we are to Treat particularly; as also the Glorious Apostle St. 
Thomas,
 the Master, Patron, and Protector of this Church; and all the other Saints in Hea∣ven, that so this Synod may begin, and proceed in Peace and universal Concord, and may end to the Praise, Honour, and Glory of God our Lord for ever. And that this our 
Publication of a Dio∣cesan Synod
 may come to the knowledge of all that are concerned, we Will and Command it to be Read in all the Churches of this Bishoprick to the People on the 
Sunday
 next after the intimation

 thereof to the Curates, and after that, to be fix∣ed to the Gates of the Church.

THE ACTS and DECREES OF THE SYNOD of 
Diamper.




ACTION I.


IN the Name of the most Holy and undivided Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in the Year of our Lord 1599, on the 20th of 
June,
 being the third 
Sunday
 after 
Whitsuntide,
 in the se∣venth Year of the Pontificate of our most holy Lord, 
Clement
 VIII. the Supreme 
Roman
 Bishop, and in the first Year of the Reign of the Catho∣lick King 
Philip,
 the Second King of 
Portugal,
 and 
Algarves,
 and of 
Malucco;
 the Illustrious Lord 
Dom Francisco da Gama Conde de Vidigeyra,
 Ad∣miral of the 
Indies,
 being Vice-roy in the Town of 
Diamper,
 subject to the King of 
Cochim,
 an In∣fidel and Heathen, in the Church of 
All-Saints,
 in the Bishoprick of 
Angamale
 of the Christians of St. 
Thomas
 in the 
Serra
 of 
Malabar,
 the See being vacant by the death of the Arch-Bishop

 
Mar-Abraham,
 there assembled in a Diocesan Sy∣nod according to the Holy Canons, the most Il∣lustrious and most Reverend Lord 
Dom Frey A∣leixo de Menezes,
 Arch-Bishop Metropolitan of 
Goa,
 Primate of the 
Indies,
 and the Oriental Parts, together with all the Priests and Curates of the said Bishoprick; and the Procurators of all the Towns and Corporations in the same, with great Numbers of other Persons belonging to the said Church, and called to the said Synod by the most Reverend Metropolitan: Where, after ha∣ving given Thanks to God for his having extin∣guished and composed all the Alterations and Commotions by which 
Satan,
 the Enemy to all that is Good, had endeavoured to hinder the as∣sembling of this Synod; and being all filled with Joy, to see themselves met together to Treat of things pertaining to the Service of God, the Pu∣rity of the Faith, and the Good of Christianity and their own Souls; the most Illustrious Me∣tropolitan did celebrate the Solemn Mass for the removing of Schism, as it is in the 
Roman
 Missal; and having preached to the People to the same purpose, the Mass being ended, he re-invested himself in his Pontifical Robes, and read the Of∣fice for the beginning of a Synod, as it is in the 
Roman
 Pontifical; which being over, and the Metropolitan seated in his Chair, with all the Ec∣clesiasticks and Secular Procurators about him in their order, he told them, That he celebrated this Holy Synod by Virtue of two Briefs of the Holy Father our Lord Pope 
Clement
 VIII. in

 which his Holiness had recommended to him the Government of that Church, after the death of the Arch-Bishop 
Marabran,
 until such time as it should be provided of a Pastor and Prelate; besides, that the same belonged to him as the Me∣tropolitan thereof, and Primate of the 
Indies,
 and all the Oriental Parts, by the Canons, the See thereof being vacant, and it having no Chap∣ter to take care of it during the vacancy; which Briefs being faithfully translated into the 
Mala∣bar
 Tongue, were immediately read, and recei∣ved with that Reverence and Obedience that was due to them: After which the Lord Metro∣politan told them, That seeing he had but little knowledge of the 
Malabar
 Tongue, it was ne∣cessary for him to have some faithful Person, and that was well versed in Ecclesiastical Affairs, to relate truly in the Congregations what he should say, or what should be spoke to him: Where∣upon upon 
Jacob,
 a Priest, and Curate of the Church of 
Pallurte
 in the said Bishoprick, a Person well skilled both in the 
Portugueze
 and 
Malabar
 Lan∣guages, was presently pitched upon by common Consent; who being called by the Lord Metropo∣litan, was charged by him with the Office of In∣terpreter to himself and the Holy Synod, giving him an Oath at the same time upon the Holy Gospels, well and faithfully to discharge the said Office, and truly and exactly to relate all that should be said by his Lordship or any other Per∣son in the Synod, without any addition or dimi∣nution; as also to read in the Congregations

 all the Decrees and Determinations of the Synod, which were to be in the 
Malabar
 Tongue: And whereas Truth it self has testified, That in the mouth of two or three there is all Truth; there∣fore for the greater security, there were given to the said Interpreter, by the most Reverend Me∣tropolitan, as Assistants, the Reverend Fathers,
 
Francisco Roz,
 and 
Antonio Tos∣cano
 of the Society of Jesus in the College of 
Vaipicotta
 in this Diocess, who being well skilled in the 
Malabar
 Tongue, were to ob∣serve all that was related by the Interpreter, and in case he was at any time faulty, to correct him; there were besides several others present, Natives as well as 
Portuguezes,
 that were well vers'd in both Languages.




Decree I.


THe Congregation being met, and all placed according to their Order, the Metropoli∣tan seated in his Chair, said, In the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three Persons and One only True God. 
Amen.


My beloved Brethren, you the Venerable Priests, and my most dear Sons in Christ, you the Representatives and Procurators of the People, Does it please you, that for the Praise and Glory of the Holy and undivided Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and for the Increase and Exaltation of the Catholick Faith, and the Chri∣stian Religion, of the Inhabitants of this Bishop∣rick,

 and for the destruction of the Heresies and Errors which have been sown therein by several Hereticks and Schismaticks, and for the purging of Books from the false Doctrines contained in them, and for the perfect Union of this Church with the whole Church Catholick and Universal, and for the yielding of Obedience to the Supreme Bishop of 
Rome,
 the Universal Pastor of the Church, and Successor in the Chair of St. 
Peter,
 and Vicar of Christ upon Earth, from whom you have for some time departed, and for the extir∣pation of Simony, which has been much pra∣ctised in this Bishoprick, and for the regulating of the Administration of the Holy Sacraments of the Church, and the necessary Use of them, and for the Reformation of the Affairs of the Church and the Clergy, and the Customs of all the Christian People of this Diocess; We should begin a Diocesan Synod of this Bishoprick of the 
Serra?
 They answered, 
It pleaseth us.
 Then the most Reverend Metropolitan asked them a∣gain; Venerable Brethren, and most beloved Sons in Christ, since you are pleased to begin a Synod, after having offered Prayers to God, from whom all Good proceedeth, it will be convenient, that the Matters to be treated of appertaining to our Holy Faith, the Church, the Divine Offices, the Administration of the Holy Sacraments, and the Customs of the whole People, be entertained by you with Benignity and Charity, and afterwards by God's Assistance complied with, with much Reverence; and that every one of you should

 faithfully procure the Reformation of such things in this Synod as you know to be amiss, and if a∣ny that are present shou'd happen to be dissatis∣fied with any thing that shall be said or done therein, let them without any scruple declare their Opinion publickly, that so by God's Grace it may be examined, and all things may be truly stated as is desired; but let not Strife or Con∣tention find any room among you to the per∣verting of Justice and Reason; neither be ye afraid of searching after and embracing the Truth.






Decree II.


THe Synod by Virtue of Holy Obedience, and upon pain of Excommunication to be in∣curred 
ipso facto,
 does command all Persons what∣soever, Ecclesiastical and Secular, that have been called to, and are present at this Synod, not to de∣part the Town of 
Diamper,
 where the said Sy∣nod is celebrated, without express leave from the most Illustrious Metropolitan, before the Sy∣nod is ended, and they have signed the Decrees thereof with their own Hand, or till all the rest are dismiss'd: The Synod does likewise Request and Command all that have any Matter that is fitting to be offered to it for the Advancement of God's Honour, and the Good of the Christians of this Bishoprick, to acquaint the Metropolitan therewith, either by Word or Writing, or some Third Person, that so what is convenient may be determined therein.








Decree III.


BE it known and declared to all present and absent, That no prejudice shall be done, or follow to any Town, Corporation, or Village, as to any Preeminence they may pretend to; by the celebration of this Synod in the Town of 
Diamper;
 as also that no Church, or Person shall suffer by reason of the Places they sit in, in this Synod, but shall have their Rights and Privileges, in the same state and vigour that they were in be∣fore; and if any Doubts should happen to arise about this or any such Matter, let them be brought before the Illustrious Metropolitan; where both Parties being heard, they shall have Justice done them.






Decree IV.


THis Synod knowing that all that is Good is from God, and that every perfect Gift cometh down from the Father of Light, who giveth per∣fect Wisdom to those that with an humble Heart pray for it; and being withal sensible that the beginning of true Wisdom is the fear of the Lord; we do admonish and command all Christians, as well Ecclesiasticks as Seculars gathered together in this Place, to confess their Sins with a true contrition for them, and all Priests to say Mass, and others to receive the most Holy Sacrament of the Altar, beseeching our Lord with humble

 and devout Prayers for good Success to all that shall be Treated of in this Synod; to which in∣tent, there shall be two solemn Masses said in the Church every day during the Session of the Sy∣nod, one of the 
Latins
 to the Holy Spirit, and the other of the 
Syrians
 to our Lady the Blessed Virgin 
Mary,
 whose Praise and Honour is to be particularly Treated of; which Masses shall be said at such hours as to be no hindrance to the Congregations, which henceforward shall meet every day in the Church at Seven in the Morning. They shall likewise, 
Latins
 as well as 
Syrians,
 e∣very day after Sun-set Sing the solemn Litanies of the Church, with a Commemoration of our Lady for the good intention of the Synod.






Decree V.


THE Synod, for the preventing of some Inconveniences that may otherwise hap∣pen, and to leave no room for unnecessary and hurtful Debates, does command by virtue of Obedience, and upon pain of Excommunication to be 
ipso facto
 incurred, That while the Con∣gregations last, no Person whatsoever, Ecclesia∣stick or Secular, presume to meet together in any Junctoes with any Persons, Ecclesiasticks or Secu∣lars, to Treat of any Matters appertaining to the Synod, or this Church, without express Licence from the most Illustrious Metropolitan; that so all that is desired, may be handled publickly, and in the Congregation, those Meetings only

 excepted which are kept by the People in order to their proposing of Matters to be consulted a∣bout, according to ancient Custom, and the Or∣der of the said Metropolitan.








ACTION II.


ON the second Day after the singing of the 
Antiphony,
 Psalm, Prayers, and Hymn, as they are in the 
Roman Pontifical,
 the most Reve∣rend Metropolitan being seated in his Chair, said, Venerable and Beloved Brethren, the Priests, and you my dearest Sons in Christ, the Procurators and Representatives of the People, We having done little more Yesterday than celebrate the Divine Offices, and Preach to the People, it is fit we should begin to Day to Treat of Matters appertaining to the Synod. In the first place, of those that belong to the Integrity and Truth of our Holy Catholick Faith, and the Profession of the same; which before we go about, I do again admonish you in our Lord Jesus Christ, that all such things as you shall judge to stand in need of Reformation in this Bishoprick, or any part thereof, may be signified to us, or to the Congregation, that so with the Divine fa∣vour and assistance, all things by your Diligence and Charity, may be brought into so good Estate as is desired, for the praise of the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.






Decree II.


THat this Synod may in all things Govern it self according to the Directions of the Holy Canons, and tread in the Footsteps of the Holy General Councils, and particularly of the Holy Council of 
Trent,
 upon the knowledge it has of the Necessities of this Church, and of the diversity of Opinions that have been hitherto therein concerning Matters of our Holy Catho∣lick Faith, and of the Errors contrary thereunto, which have been sowed in this Diocess by Hereticks and Schismaticks: it doth command all Persons Ecclesiasticks and Seculars, called hither, either in their own Name, or in the Name of others, Ecclesi∣asticks or Laicks, of this Bishoprick, to make Pro∣fession and Oath of the following Faith, in the hands of the most Illustrious Metropolitan, Pre∣sident of this Synod: And for the more effectual execution of this Decree, and to provoke others by his own Example, the most Illustrious Metro∣politan having robed himself in his Pontificals, but without his Mitre, kneeling down before the Altar, and having laid his hands upon a Cross that was upon a Book of the Gospels, did in his own Name, as the present Prelate and Metro∣politan of the Diocess, and in the Name of all the Christians belonging to the same, and every Person thereof, Secular and Ecclesiastick, make Profession and Oath of the Faith following, which was immediately declared to all that were present.






The Profession and Oath of the Faith.


IN the Name of the most Holy and undivided Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, one only true God, in the Year of our Lord, 1599, in the Seventh Year of the Pontificate of our most Holy Lord 
Clement
 VIII. Bishop of 
Rome,
 in the Town of 
Diamper,
 in the Kingdom of 
Malabar,
 in the 
East-Indies,
 in the Church of 
All Saints,
 on the 21st. of 
June,
 in a Diocesan Synod of the Bishoprick of 
Serra,
 Assembled by the most Illu∣strious and Reverend Lord 
Dom Frey Aleixo de Menezes,
 Arch-Bishop Metropolitan of 
Goa,
 and the Oriental Parts, and the See being vacant, of the said Bishoprick;


I 
N.
 do of my own free Will, without any manner of force and constraint, for the Salva∣tion of my Soul, believing it in my heart, pro∣test, that with a firm Faith I do believe, and confess, all and every one of the Articles con∣tained in the Symbol of Faith which is used in Holy Mother 
Roman
 Church.


I believe in one God the Father Almighty, Ma∣ker of Heaven and Earth, and of all things visible and invisible:


And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, begotten of his Father before all Worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made: Who for

 us Men, and for our Salvation, came down from Heaven, and was Incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin 
Mary,
 and was made Man, and was Crucified also for us under 
Pontius Pilate;
 He suffered and was buried, and the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures, and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father, and he shall come again with Glory to Judge both the Quick and the Dead: whose Kingdom shall have no end.


And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of Life, who proceedeth from the Father, and the Son, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spake by the Pro∣phets. And I believe one Catholick and Apostolick Church; I acknowledge one Baptism, for the remissi∣on of Sins; and I look for the Resurrection of the Dead; and the Life of the World to come.


I do firmly receive and embrace all Apostoli∣cal and Ecclesiastical Traditions, and all the Ob∣servances and Constitutions of the said Church; I admit the Holy Scriptures in that sence wherein it has ever been, and is still held by Mother Church, to whom it belongeth to judge of the true Sence and Interpretation of the Holy Scrip∣tures; neither will I either receive or interpret it but according to the unanimous consent of the Fathers.


I do confess likewise, that there are Seven true and proper Sacraments of the New Testament, instituted by Christ our Lord, which are all neces∣sary

 to the health of Mankind, tho' not to every particular Person; they are, Baptism, Confirma∣tion, the Eucharist, Order, Penance, Matrimo∣ny, and Extream Unction, which do all conferr Grace on those that receive them worthily; and of these seven Sacraments, that Baptism, Confir∣mation, and Orders, are to be received but once, neither can they be repeated without great Sa∣crilege.


I admit and receive all the Customs, Rites, and Ceremonies, received and approved of in the 
Roman
 Church, in the solemn Administration of the said seven Sacraments, and do also receive and embrace all in general, and every thing in particular, that has been defined and declared concerning Original Sin, and Justification, in the Holy Council of 
Trent.


I do likewise confess, that in the 
Mass
 there is offer'd to God a true and proper Sacrifice of Pardon both for the Quick and the Dead; and that in the most Holy Sacrament of the Eu∣charist, there is the true, real, and substantial Body and Blood, together with the Soul and Di∣vinity of our Lord Jesus Christ; and that the whole substance of the Bread is by Conse∣cration turned into the Body of Christ, and the whole substance of the Wine into his Blood; which Conversion the Catholick Church calls 
Transubstantiation:
 Moreover, I do confess, that under each Species Christ is entire, and the true Sacrament is received.




I do constantly hold and confess, that there is a
 
Purgatory,
 and that the Souls which are cleansing from their Sins, do receive benefit from the Prayers and Devotions of the Faithful.


I do likewise affirm, that
 the Souls of the Just

 and Faithful, which at their departure out of this Life, have entirely satisfied for the Punishment due to the Sins that they have committed; as also those in 
Purgatory
 which have made an end of satis∣fying for their sins according to the Divine Pleasure and Ordination; as also those who after Baptism have committed no Sin, do at the moment of their death go immediately into Heaven, where they behold God as he is: And I do condemn, and anathematize the Heresy of those, who think that the Souls of the Just are in a Terrestrial Pa∣radise till the day of Judgment; and that the Damned are not Tormented any otherwise than by the certainty they have of the Torments they are to enter into after the day of Judgment.


And I do confess, and affirm, that the Saints now reigning with Christ in Heaven, are to be Reverenced, and Invoked, and that they offer Prayers to God for us, whose Relicks are like∣wise to be reverenced on Earth: And moreover, that the
 Images of our Lord Christ, and of our Lady the Glorious Virgin 
Mary,
 and of all the other Saints, are to be kept, used, and reve∣renced, with due Honour and Veneration.




I do also believe, that our Lady the most Holy Virgin 
Mary
 is the proper and true Mother of God, and ought to be called so by the Faithful, for having brought forth according to the Flesh, without any pain or passion, the true Son of God, and that she always continued a Virgin, in, and after her Deliverance, having never been defiled by any actual Sin.


I do confess, that the power of granting In∣dulgences was left to the Church by our Lord Jesus Christ; the use whereof I do affirm to be healthful and profitable to all Christian People.


I do acknowledge the Holy, Catholick, and Apostolick 
Roman
 Church to be the Head, Mo∣ther and Mistress of all other Churches in the World; and do hold all that are not subject and obedient to her, to be Heretical, Schismatical, and disobedient to our Lord Jesus Christ, and his Commands, and to the Order that he left in the Church, and to be Aliens from Eternal Salvation.


I do promise and swear true Obedience to the Pope, the 
Roman
 Bishop, the Successor of the Blessed Prince of the Apostles St. 
Peter,
 and Vicar of our Lord Jesus Christ on earth, the Head of the whole Church on earth, and Doctor and Master of the same, and the Father, Prelate, and Pastor of all Christians; and do confess, that all who deny Obedience to the said 
Roman
 Bishop, the Vicar of Christ, are Transgressors of the Divine Commands, and cannot attain to Eter∣nal Life.




I do without any scruple receive, approve, and confess all other Matters, defined and declared in the Sacred Canons, and General Councils, and chiefly in the Holy Council of 
Trent;
 and do in the same manner condemn, reject, and anathe∣matize every thing that is contrary to the same; together with all Heresies condemned, rejected and anathematized by the said Church; Namely, the Diabolical and perverse Heresie of 
Nestorius,
 together with its perverse Author 
Nestorius,
 and its false Teachers
 
Theodorus
 and
 
Diodorus,
 and all that have and do follow it, who being per∣swaded and seduced by the Devil, do impiously maintain, That our Lord and Saviour Christ

 consists of Two Persons, affirming the Divine Word not to have taken the Flesh into a Unity of Person with it self, but only to have dwelt therein as in a Temple, and so will not say, that God was Incarnate, or that our Lady, the most Blessed Virgin 
Mary,
 was the Mother of God, but only the Mother of Christ; all which I re∣ject, condemn and anathematize as Diabolical He∣resies; and do believe, and embrace, and approve of all that was determined about this Matter, in the Council of 
Ephesus,
 consisting of two hun∣dred Fathers, in which by order of 
Celestine
 1st. Bishop of 
Rome,
 the Blessed St. 
Cyril,
 Patriarch of 
Alexandria,
 was President, whom I acknow∣ledge to be a Saint now enjoying God, and that all that blaspheme him are in a state of Damnation.


Moreover, I do condemn all that say, that the Passion of our Saviour ought not to be menti∣oned, and that it is an Injury to him to do it; on the contrary, I do believe and confess, that the Consideration and Discourses thereof are ho∣ly, and of benefit to Souls.


I do likewise confess and believe, that in pure Christianity there is only one Law of our Lord Jesus Christ, true God, and true Man; in like manner as there is no more than one only true God, one only Faith, and one only Baptism; which one only Law was preached by all the holy Apostles, and their Disciples and Successors after the same manner. I do therefore condemn and reject all those who ignorantly teach, That there was one Law of St.

 
Thomas,
 and another Law of St. 
Peter,
 and that they are so different as not to have any thing to do with one another; as also all other Heresies and Errors condemned by Holy Mother Church. This true and Catholick Faith, out of which there is no Salvation, and which at present I do of my own free Will, profess and truly hold and be∣lieve, I shall with the help of God endeavour to keep entire, and undefiled to my last breath; and constantly to hold and profess, and to procure its being held, professed, preached, and taught by all that are subject to me, or that shall be any ways under my care. I 
N.
 do promise and vow to God, and Swear to this Holy Cross of our Lord Christ: So help me God, and the Contents of this Gospel
.


I do also Promise, Vow and Swear to God, this Cross, and these Holy Gospels, never to re∣ceive into this Church and Bishoprick of the 
Ser∣ra,
 any Bishop, Archbishop, Prelate, Pastor or Governour whatsoever, but what shall be imme∣diately

 appointed by the Holy Apostolical See, and the Bishop of 
Rome,
 and that whomsoever he shall appoint, I will receive and obey as my true Pastor, without expecting any Message, or having any further dependance upon the Patri∣arch of 
Babylon,
 whom I condemn, reject and anathematize, as being a 
Nestorian
 Heretick and Schismatick, and out of the Obedience of the Holy 
Roman
 Church, and for that reason out of a state of Salvation: And I do swear and promise, never to obey him any more, nor to communicate with him in any Matter: All this that I have professed and declared, I do pro∣mise, vow and swear to Almighty God, and this Holy Cross of Christ: So help me God, and the Contents of these Gospels. 
Amen.


The most Reverend Metropolitan, after ha∣ving made this Protestation and Confession of Faith, rose up, and seating himself in his Chair, with his Mitre on his Head, and the Holy Go∣spels, with a Cross upon them in his hands; the Reverend 
George,
 Archdeacon of the said Bishop∣rick of the 
Serra,
 kneeling down before him, made the same Profession of Faith, with a loud and intelligible Voice, in the 
Malabar
 Tongue, taking an Oath in the hands of the Lord Metro∣politan, and after him all the Priests, Deacons, Subdeacons, and other Ecclesiasticks that were present, being upon their Knees, 
Jacob,
 Curate of 
Pallarty,
 and Interpreter to the Synod, read the said Profession in 
Malabar,
 all of them say∣ing

 it along with him; which being ended, they all took the Oath in the hands of the Lord Me∣tropolitan, who asked them one by one in parti∣cular, Whether they did firmly believe all that was contained in the Profession; as also whether they did believe and confess all that is believed and professed by the Holy Mother Church of 
Rome,
 and did reject all that she rejects, and if they did anathematize the cursed Heresie of the 
Néstorians,
 with all its falsities, and all the Au∣thors and Cherishers of the same; Namely, the perverse 
Nestorius, Theodorus,
 and 
Diodorus,
 to∣gether with all their Followers; and whether they did acknowledge the Holy 
Roman
 Church to be the Mother, and Mistress
, and Head of all the Churches in the World, and confess that all that

 were not obedient to her, were out of a state of Salvation; and if they did promise and swear true Obedience and subjection to the most Holy Father the Pope and Bishop of 
Rome,
 as Universal Pastor of the Church, and Successor of St. 
Peter,
 the Prince of the Apostles, and Vi∣car of Christ upon Earth, without any manner of dependance upon the Schismatical Patriarch of 
Babylon,
 to whom tho' contrary to Justice, they had hitherto been subject; and if they did pro∣mise never to receive any other Bishop into this Diocess, but what shall be sent by the Holy 
Ro∣man
 Church, by the appointment of our Lord the Pope, and that whomsoever he shall ordain, they will acknowledge and obey for their Pre∣late, as becomes true Catholicks, and Sons of the Church, anathematizing the Patriarch of 
Baby∣lon,
 as a 
Nestorian
 Heretick, out of the Obedi∣ence of the Holy 
Roman
 Church, and promi∣sing and swearing never to obey him more in any matter, nor to have any further Commerce or Communion with him in things appertaining to the Church.


To all which, and every particular, they did all, and every one of them for themselves with their hands upon the Cross and the Gospel, swear and protest to God by the Holy Gospel, and the Cross of Christ. After the Ecclesiasticks had made this Profession and Oath, the Procurators and Representatives of the People, by virtue of the Powers they had, made the same in their own Name, and in the Name of the People of

 the Bishroprick, as did also all the other Chri∣stians that were present.








Decree III.


THe Synod doth command all Priests, Deacons, and Sub-Deacons, of this Bishoprick, that were not present at this Solemnity, to make the foresaid Oath and profession of Faith in the hands of the most Illustrious Metropolitan, at the Visitation of their Churches, which he intends to make speedily, or in the hands of such as he shall depute for those that shall be absent at the time of the Visitation; that so there may be none in Holy Orders in this Bishoprick but what has made this Profession in the manner aforesaid. The Synod doth likewise declare, That hereafter none shall be capable of undertaking any Vicaridge, or Cure of a Church, until they have made the said Profession, in the hands of their Prelate, or of some Commissionated by him for that purpose; as also, that all that take Holy Orders, do first make the said Profession in the same manner; and if any of the forementioned, which God forbid, shall refuse to do it, that they shall thereupon be declared Excommunicate, until they comply, and withal be vehemently suspected of Heresy, and be punished according to the Sacred Canons.










ACTION III.


BEcause without Faith it is impossible to please God; and the Holy Catholick Faith, without which none can be saved, is the beginning of true Life, and the foundation of all our Good; the Purity thereof being that, that distinguishes Christians and Catholicks from all other People; wherefore the Synod being sensible, that by means of some Heretical Persons, and Books scattered all over this Bishoprick, many Errors and Falsi∣ties have been sown therein, with which many are poisoned, and more may be, doth judge it necessary, besides the profession of Faith that has been made, further to declare to the People in some Chapters, the chief Articles of our Holy Catholick Faith, and to point at, and observe the Errors contained in their Books, and to have them Preached against in this Bishoprick, that so knowing the mischief and falsehood of them, they may avoid them.








CHAP. I. The Doctrine of Faith.


OUr Holy Faith, that is believed with one una∣nimous consent by the Catholick Church spread all over the World, is, That we believe in One only True, Almighty, Immutable, In∣comprehensible, and Ineffable God, the Eternal Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, One in Essence, and Three in Persons; the Father not begotten, the Son begotten of the Father, and of the same substance with him, and equal to him, and the Holy Ghost proceeding eternally from the Fa∣ther and the Son; not as from two Principals, or two Inspirations, but from both as from one only Principal, and one only Inspiration; the Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit is not the Father, nor the Son; but the Father is only the Father, the Son is only the Son, and the Holy Spirit is only the Holy Spirit, none of them being before another in Eternity, nor superiour to another in Majesty, nor inferi∣our to another in Power, but were all without beginning or end; the Father is he who begot, the Son is he who was born, and the Holy Ghost he who proceedeth, Consubstantial, Equal, alike Almighty, and alike Eternal. These three Per∣sons are one only God, and not three Gods, one

 only Essence and Substance, one Nature, one Immensity, one Principal, one Creator of all things Visible and Invisible, Corporal and Spiri∣tual, who when he pleased, created all things, with his goodness, and would that they should be all very good.






CHAP. II.


FUrthermore; That the only begotten Son of God, who is always with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, Consubstantial to the Father, at the time appointed by the profound Wisdom of the Divine Mercy, for the redeeming of Men from the sin of 
Adam,
 and from all other sins, was truly Incarnate by the operation of the Holy Spirit, in the pure Womb of our Lady the most Blessed Virgin 
Mary,
 and in her took our true and intire Nature of Man, that is, a Body and rational Soul, into the Unity of the Divine Per∣son; which Unity was such, that our Lord Jesus Christ is God and Man, and the Son of God, and the Son of Man, in as much as he was the Son of the Blessed Virgin; so that the one Nature is not confounded with the other, neither did the one pass into, nor mix it self with the other; neither did either of them vanish, or cease to be; but in one only Person, or in one Divine Sup∣positum, there are two perfect Natures, a Divine and Humane, but so that the properties of both Natures are still preserved, there being two Wills,

 the Divine and Humane, and two Operations, Christ still continuing one; for as the Form of God does not destroy the Form of a Servant, so the Form of a Servant does not diminish the Form of God; because he who is true God, is also true Man: God, because 
in the beginning he was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word:
 Man, because 
the Word was made Flesh,
 and died among us: God, because by his own Power he satisfied five Thousand Men with five Loaves, and promised the Water of Eternal Life to the 
Samaritan
 Woman, and raised 
Lazarus
 from the Grave when he had been dead four days, and gave sight to the Blind, cured the Sick, and commanded the Winds and the Seas: Man, because he suffered Hunger and Thirst, was weary in the Way, was fastned with Nails to the Cross, and died thereon: Equal to the Eternal Father as to the Divinity, and Inferior to the Father as to the Humanity, and Mortal, and Passible.






CHAP. III.


FUrthermore; That the same Son of God that was Incarnate, was truly born of the Virgin 
Mary,
 and had his Sacred Body formed of the pure Blood of the same most Blessed Vir∣gin, and is truly her Son; for which reason we confess her to be truly the Mother of God, and that she ought to be so called and invocated

 by the whole Catholick Church; for that she really and truly brought forth according to the Flesh, tho' without any Pain or Passion, the true Son of God, made Man; and that the said Son of God Incarnate, truly suffered for us, and was truly dead and buried, and in his Soul truly de∣scended into Hell, or 
Limbo,
 to redeem the Souls of the Holy Fathers, which were therein, and did truly rise again from the dead the third day, and afterwards for forty days taught his Disciples, speaking with them of the Kingdom of Heaven, and immediately by his own Power ascended into the Heavens, where he sits at the right hand of the Majesty, Glory, and Power of the Father, from whence he shall come to Judge the quick and the dead, and to give to every one according to their Works.






CHAP. IV.


FUrthermore; That none that are descended from 
Adam,
 ever were or can be saved by any other means, than by Faith in the Mediator betwixt God and Man, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God; who by his Blood and Death reconciled us to the Eternal Father, by having satisfied him for our Debts; the Faith before our Saviour appeared in the World, being to believe in him who was to come; as after his appearance, to believe in him who is come, and by his Blood and Death has saved us.








CHAP. V.


FUrthermore; That all we who are born of 
Adam
 by the way of Natural Generation, are born Children of Wrath, with the guilt of Original Sin, incurred by the disobedience of 
Adam,
 in whom we all sinned, and which we all committed in him; for which sin, 
Adam
 lost for himself, and us, Holiness and Righteousness, and so that guilt of sin is derived to all of us by Generation, we having all sinned in him, as the Apostle St. 
Paul
 tells us, that 
by one Man Sin entred into the World, and by Sin Death, and so Death passed upon all Men, all having sinned in him,
 but notwithstanding this guilt is derived to us by Generation; nevertheless our Souls are not derived by Generation as our Bodies are, but are created by God of nothing, and by the Divine Ordination infused into our Bodies, at the time when they are perfectly formed and orga∣nized, and in the instant in which they are in∣fused into our Bodies, they contract the guilt of Original Sin, which we committed in 
Adam,
 and for which we were all expelled the Kingdom of Heaven, and deprived of God for ever; but which is now pardoned by Holy Baptism, by which our Souls are cleansed from the guilt of that sin, and of Children of Wrath, and Aliens from Glory; we are made the blessed Sons of God, and Heirs of Heaven; wherein likewise all

 our other sins and actual transgressions, where there are any, together with all the punishments due to the same, are forgiven.






CHAP. VI.


FUrthermore; That the Souls of all those that have committed no sin after Baptism, and of those who having committed sins, have done condign Penance, and have made an en∣tire and equal satisfaction for them, are carried immediately into Heaven, where they behold God, Three and One as he is; and do partake of the Divine Vision, in proportion to the di∣versity of their Merits, some more perfectly than others, and in the same manner they who die in any Actual Mortal sin, without having done condign punishment for it; or only in Original sin, do go straightway down into Hell, there to be tormented with Eternal punishments, though unequal, according to the measure of their guilt.






CHAP. VII.


FUrthermore; That all Christians departing this life in Charity, and having truly repented of the sins they have committed, before they have made full satisfaction to the Divine Justice for the same, are at their death carried into 
Purgatory,
 where their guilt is purged away by

 Fire, and other punishments in such a space of time as by the Divine Ordination is suitable to their Quality, or until they have entirely satisfied for them, after which they are carried up into Glo∣ry, there to enjoy God; and that in Purgatory the Prayers, Alms, and other Works of Piety that are performed by the Faithful that are alive, for the Faithful that are dead, are profitable to them; but above all, the holy Sacrifice of the Mass, for their being relaxed from the punish∣ments that they suffer, and for the shortning of their banishment from Heaven.






CHAP. VIII.


FUrthermore, That at the day of Judgment, our Bodies, tho' crumbled into dust and ashes, shall be raised up the same that they were in this Life, and be reunited to their Souls, those of the Righteous to be cloathed with Glory, and to reign with Christ for ever in the Heavens; and those of the Wicked, to be together with their souls tormented for ever in the Company of Devils in the Eternal and real Fire of Hell.








CHAP. IX.


FUrthermore, That in the beginning, and in Time God created all things Visible and In∣visible, Corporeal and Spiritual, and the Empy∣rean Heavens full of Angels, of whom, those that continued subject to God were confirmed in Grace, enjoying God with all the perfections and Gifts wherewith they were created, as those who disobeyed him fell into Hell, which God so soon as they sinned made for them, where they are tormented for ever with the rigour of Ju∣stice; not only with punishments of loss, in be∣ing Eternally deprived of the Divine Vision, which they were created to have enjoyed, but with real Fire, and other Eternal Torments al∣so; and do tempt men, endeavouring to do them all the mischief they are able, out of envy, for the Blessings that are reserved for the Just, and which they have forfeited by their sins, and out of hatred they have for God and his Works, and that intrinsical Malice they are hardned in.






CHAP. X.


FUrthermore, That the Blessed Angels and Saints that reign with Christ in the Heavens are to be venerated, and invok'd by the Faith∣ful, desiring of God a Remedy for our wants

 through their Intercession; and of them that they would intercede for us, which they do daily by offering up our Prayers and Peti∣tions to God; That the Bodies and Re∣liques of Saints ought to be had in veneration, in being carefully kept, kissed and adored by the Faithful, and placed under the Holy Altars, and other consecrated places, upon the account of their having been lively Members of Christ, and the Temple of the Holy Spirit, and because they are to be raised again at the day of Judgment, and and clothed with Eternal Glory in Heaven, and God vouchsafes many Blessings upon Earth by them.






CHAP. XI.


FUrthermore, That the Images of our Lord Christ, and of our Lady the Glorious Virgin 
Mary,
 and of the Holy Angels that are painted after our manner, and of other Saints which the Church believes to be in Heaven, ought to be kept and used in all decent places; not only in the houses of the Faithful, but chiefly in Church∣es and Altars, and to be reverenced and adored with due veneration, and with the same that is due to the Persons they represent; not that we believe that there is any thing of Divinity or
 Vir∣tue in them for which they ought to be honour∣ed, or that we put our Hope and Confidence in

 them, as the
 Heathens did in their Idols; but because the Honour which we pay to them, re∣ferrs to what they represent, so that in prostra∣ting our selves before their Images, we adore Christ, and reverence the Saints, whose Images they are: In like manner we adore the sign of the Cross, with the Worship of
 
Latria,
 which is due only to God, because it is a sign represent∣ing the Son of God our Lord Jesus Christ upon the Cross, and which he himself hath told us will be the sign of the Son of Man in the Day of Judg∣ment, and with the same Worship of 
Latria
 we adore the Images of our Lord Jesus Christ, be∣cause they represent him.








CHAP. XII.


FUrthermore, the Church professeth that eve∣ry Person as soon as he is born, hath a Guardian Angel given him, whose business it is to excite People to what is good, and to deli∣ver them from many evils which they would o∣therwise have fallen into, which Angel protects and accompanies People through their whole lives, doing all it can to keep them from Sin, and all other Evils, that so it may bring them to Eter∣nal Life, and is always suggesting good things to their Free Will, from which we receive many Blessings as well Spiritual as Temporal, notwith∣standing we neither see them, nor understand how they do it; and these we call our Guardian Angels.






CHAP. XIII.


FUrthermore, That the Catholick Church is one and the same all over the World, having for its Pastor the chief Bishop of 
Rome,
 Successor in the Chair of the Blessed Prince of the Apo∣stles, St. 
Peter,
 to whom, and by him to his Suc∣cessors, our Lord Jesus Christ delivered the full power of ruling and governing his whole Church; from whence it is, that the 
Roman
 Church is the Head of the whole Church, and the Father, Ma∣ster and Doctor of all Christians; and the Pre∣late

 of all in common, and of all Priests, Bi∣shops, Archbishops, Primates and Patriarchs, of whatsoever Church they are; as also the Pastor of all Emperors, Kings, Princes and Lords: In a word, of all that are Christians, and of all the Faithful People. Hence it is, that all that are not under the Obedience of the said 
Roman
 Bishop, the Vicar of Christ upon Earth, are out of a state of Salvation, and shall be condemned to Hell as Hereticks and Schismaticks, for their Dis∣obedience to the Commands of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Order that he left in his Church.






CHAP. XIV.


FUrthermore, that One and the same God is the Author of the New and Old Testa∣ment, of the Prophets, and the Gospels, the Saints of both those Testaments being inspired in the Writing of them with the same Holy Spirit; and so the Catholick Church receives all the Cano∣nical Books of both Testaments, which contain in them nothing but what is infallibly true, and was dictated by the Holy Spirit: To wit, of the Old Testament the five Books of 
Moses, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy;
 as al∣so 
Joshua,
 the two Books of 
Judges, Ruth,
 the four Books of 
Kings,
 the two Books of 
Chroni∣cles,
 the first Book of 
Esdras,
 the second which is called 
Nehemias, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Job,
 the Psalms of 
David,
 being 150, the 
Proverbs, Ec∣clesiastes,


 the 
Song of Songs,
 the Book of 
Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus,
 the four greater Prophets, 
viz. Isai∣ah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel;
 the twelve lesser, 
viz. Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi,
 and the first and second of 
Maccabees;
 and of the New Testament, St. 
Matthew,
 St. 
Mark,
 St. 
Luke,
 and St. 
John,
 the Acts of the A∣postles writ by St. 
Luke,
 the fourteen Epistles of St. 
Paul,
 viz. One to the 
Romans,
 two to the 
Co∣rinthians,
 one to the 
Galatians,
 one to the 
Ephe∣sians,
 one to the 
Philippians,
 one to the 
Colossians,
 two to the 
Thessalonians,
 two to 
Timothy,
 one to 
Titus,
 one to 
Philemon,
 and to the 
Hebrews;
 two of the Apostle St. 
Peter,
 three of the Apostle St. 
John,
 one of the Apostle St. 
James,
 one of the Apostle St. 
Jude,
 and the 
Revelation
 of the Apo∣stle St. 
John,
 all which Books, with all their parts are Canonical, and contain in them nothing but what is infallibly true.








Decree II.


THe Synod declareth, that in the Books of the New Testament used in this Church, and writ in the 
Syrian
 or 
Syriack
 Tongue, there is wanting in the Gospel of St. 
John,
 the begin∣ning of the 8th. Chapter, the History of the Adul∣teress that was carried before our Lord Christ; as also in the 10th. of St. 
Luke,
 where it is said, that 
Christ sent seventy two Disciples,
 it is said, he 
sent seventy Disciples;
 and in the 6th. of St.

 
Matthew,
 the words, 
For thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory for ever,
 is added to the end of the Lord's Prayer; there is also want∣ing in the said Books the second Epistle of St. 
Peter,
 the second and third Epistles of St. 
John,
 and that of 
Jude,
 and the 
Revelation
 of St. 
John,
 and in the 4th. Chapter of the first Epistle of St. 
John,
 this Verse is wanting, having been impi∣ously left out, 
Qui solvit Jesum, non est ex Deo;
 and in the 5th. Chapter of the same Epistle, these words are wanting, 
There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are One;
 and in the Old Testament there are wanting the Books of 
Esther, Tobit,
 and 
Wisdom,
 all which the Synod commandeth to be translated, and the passages that are wanting to be restored to their Purity, according to the 
Chaldee
 Copies, which are emend∣ed, and the Vulgar Latin Edition made use of by holy Mother Church, that so this Church may have the Holy Scriptures entire, and may use it with all its parts, as it was written, and as it is to be used in the Universal Church; to which end the Synod desireth the Reverend Father 
Francisco Roz,
 of the Society of Jesus, and Professor of the 
Syrian
 Tongue in the Col∣lege of 
Vaipicotta
 in this Bishoprick, that he would be pleased to take the trouble thereof up∣on him, for which he is so well qualified by rea∣son of his great skill both in the 
Syrian
 Language, and the Scripture.








Decree III.


WHereas the Holy Scriptures are the Pillars that support our Holy Faith, and as it were the Foundations whereon it stands, and wherein the Truth and Purity thereof is to be met with, which has made all Hereticks in their endeavours to destroy the said Faith, constantly and industriously to corrupt the Text of the Divine Scriptures, partly by taking away such passages as did manifestly contradict their Er∣rors, and by perverting other places so as to make them
 seem to favour them; which hath also happened in this Bishoprick, through its ha∣ving been governed by Bishops who were 
Nesto∣rian
 Hereticks, and that used the same practices upon the Holy Scriptures, that were in their hands in favour of their Heresies; as in the 20th. of the Acts of the Apostles, where St. 
Paul
 saith, 
Take heed to your selves, and the whole Church, over which the Holy Spirit hath made you Bishops to rule the Church of God, which he purchased with his Blood;
 the word 
God
 is impiously changed for

 that of 
Christ,
 and it is said 
that Christ hath made them to govern his Church, which he pur∣chased with his own Blood;
 because the 
Nestorians,
 being instigated by the Devil, will not acknow∣ledge according to the Catholick Truth, that God suffered and shed his Blood for us; and in the fourth Chapter of the first Epistle of St. 
John,
 this Verse is left out, 
Qui solvit Jesum, non est ex Deo;
 because it contradicts the 
Nestorians,
 who do impiously divide Christ, by making him to have two Persons; and in the 3d. Chap. of the same Epistle, where it is said, 
In this we know the Love of God, because he laid down his Life for us,
 the word 
God
 is maliciously left out, and that of 
Christ
 put in its stead, saying, 
That in this we know the Love of Christ,
 &c. and so it favours the 
Ne∣storian
 Heresie, which denies God to have dyed for us; and in the 2d. Chap. of the Epistle to the 
Hebrews,
 where the Apostle saith, 
We have seen Jesus for the Passion of his Death crowned with glo∣ry and honour, that he by the Grace of God should taste death fo
 all men;
 the 
Surian,
 the better to make a difference of Persons in Christ, which was what 
Nestorius
 taught, has impiously added, 
VVe have seen Jesus for the passion of his death crown∣ed with honour and glory, that the Grace of God, (prae∣ter Deum,
 or besides God) 
might taste death for all;
 and in the 6th. of St. 
Luke,
 where our Lord Christ saith, 
Lend, hoping for nothing again;
 to favour and justifie their Usury, they have made it, 
Lend, and from thence hope for something:
 All which places being depraved and corrupted by

 Hereticks, the Synod commandeth to be cor∣rected in all their Books, and to be restored ac∣cording to the Purity and Truth of the Vulgar Edition used by Holy Mother Church, entreat∣ing the most Illustrious Metropolitan forthwith to visit the Churches of this Diocess, either in Per∣son, or by some well skilled in the 
Syrian
 Tongue, whom he shall be pleased to depute.






Decree IV.


THe Synod being informed that the Chri∣stians of this Diocess, by reason of the Communication they have with Infidels, and by living among them, have imbibed several of their Errors and Ignorances, namely, three that are the common Errors of all the Infidels of these parts; the first is, That there is a
 Transmigrati∣on of Souls, which after Death go either into the Bodies of Beasts, or of some other Men; which besides that it is a great Ignorance, is also an Er∣ror contrary to the Catholick Faith, which teach∣eth, That our Souls after Death are carried to Heaven or Hell, or Purgatory, or 
Limbus,
 ac∣cording to every ones Merits, and that there is no such fabulous and false Transmigration.




The second is, That all things come necessari∣ly to pass, or through
 Fate or Fortune, which they call the Nativity of Men, who they say are compelled to be what they are, and that there is no help for it; which is a manifest Error, and condemned by Holy Mother Church, for as much as it destroys that Liberty of Will, with which God created us, leaving us in the power of our own Will, to do Good or Evil, to obey his Holy Inspirations and Internal Motions, by which he excites to Good, or to resist Evil; so that as it de∣pends on his Divine mercy and goodness to move us to Good, so it depends on our Free-Will, whether by his assistance we will obey those In∣spirations, and will profit our selves of his Inter∣nal Motions, or of our own free Will refuse to do it; or in a word, do Well, or Ill; so that if we perish for doing any thing that is Ill, it is the fault of our own Free-Will; as the Catho∣lick Faith teaches us; and not from the fate of our Nativity, as the ignorant Heathens will have it.


The third is,
 That every one may be saved in his own Law; all which are Good, and lead Men to Heaven. Now this is a manifest Heresy; there being no other Law upon earth in which Salvation is to be found, besides that of

 our Saviour Christ, for that he only teacheth the Truth; so that all that live in any other Sect, are out of a state of Salvation, and shall be condemn∣ed to Hell; there being no other Name given to Men, by which we can be saved, but only the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, who was Crucified for us: All which Er∣rors, the Synod commandeth the Vicars and Preachers often to preach against in the hearing of the ignorant People; and all Confessors to examine their Penitents concerning them, and to teach them the Catholick Truth.






Decree V.


THis Synod being informed, that there is a dangerous Heresy, and very injurious to our Lord Jesus Christ, sown and preached through this Diocess; which is, That it is a
 grievous sin so much as to think or speak of our Saviour's Holy Passion: and as there are a great many of this Opinion, so the doing of it has formerly been prohibited by impious Censures; all which is a manifest Error, and extreamly prejudicial to the Souls of all faithful Christians; and the fruit and profit of Souls, arising from such Considerations, and Discourses, which is very great, as well for that love and affection which they beget in us, for our Saviour, who suffer'd for our Salvation, as

 for the Example of those Vertues which were so Illustrious in his Holy Passion, and the hatred of Sin, for which he suffer'd so much, and the fear of the Divine Justice which he so rigorously satis∣fied, and the confidence of our Salvation by such a plenteous Redemption; and the use of the Sacraments, to which he applyed the virtue of his Holy Passion, and other infinite benefits which are derived from thence to our Souls, which Error included another no less prejudicial, and which is also common among the 
Nestorians; the condemning of Holy Images;
 for that if it were an Impiety to think of the Passion of our Lord Christ, it must follow that all those things are unlawful, that move or contribute thereun∣to; as, the Sign of the Holy Cross; and all Images of the Holy Passion; all which is a gross and manifest Heresy: Wherefore the Synod doth recommend it to all Preachers, Confessors, and Rectors of Churches, frequently to perswade their People to the consideration of those Di∣vine Mysteries; and to that end, they shall ad∣vise them to the Devotion of the 
Rosary
 of our Lady the most Blessed Virgin 
Mary;
 wherein are contained all the principal Mysteries of the Life of our Lord Christ, with profitable Medita∣tions upon them.






Decree VI.


AMong the many Errors sown in this Diocess, and left in the Books thereof, by the per∣fidious 
Nestorian
 Hereticks, there being several against our Lady, the most Blessed Virgin 
Mary,


 the Mother of God, the 
only
 Remedy of Chri∣stians, the Mother of Mercy, and the Advocate of Sinners, the Queen of Angels. The Synod doth therefore declare, That it is the Doctrine of the Catholick Faith, that the Holy Virgin was never at any time stained with the guilt of any actual sin; and that it is Pious to believe, that she was also Conceived without Original Sin; it seeming to be most agreeable to the Dignity of the Mother of God, that it should be so; tho' it is true, that Holy Mother Church
 has not as yet determined any thing about that matter. Furthermore, the Catholick Faith teacheth, that she was always, before, in, and after Child-birth, a most pure Virgin, and that she brought forth the Son of God, made Man, without any Pain, or Passion; having none of those things which are common to other Women after Child-birth, nor no need of any created assistance to help her to bring forth, or afterwards, there being nothing in her but what was pure, the Eternal Word, made Flesh, springing out of her Womb, the Claustrum of her pure Virginity being shut,

 when the time, determined in the Consistory of the Holy Trinity was come, to the great Spiritual Joy and satisfaction of the said Blessed Virgin; for which reason she ought truly to be stiled the Mother of God, and not only the Mother of Christ; and that when she departed this Life, she was immediately carried up into Heaven, where by a particular privilege due to her Merits, she enjoys God both in Body and Soul, without waiting for the general Resurrection; there be∣ing no reason why that Body, out of which there was most Holy Flesh formed, for the Son of God made Man, should as other Bodies be dissolved into Dust and Ashes, but that it should be im∣mediately exalted and glorified, and placed high above all the Quires of Angels, as Holy Mother Church sings and confesseth; concerning the whole of which matter, the Impious 
Nestorian
 Hereticks have spoke, and writ, even in the Bre∣viaries used in this Bishoprick, a great many Blasphemies and Heresies.






Decree VII.


THe Synod is with great sorrow sensible of that Heresy, and perverse Error, sown by the Schismaticks in this Diocess, to the great pre∣judice of Souls; which is, That there was one Law of St. 
Thomas,
 and another of St. 
Peter,
 which made
 two different and distinct Churches, and

 both immediately from Christ; and that the one had nothing to do with the other; neither did the Prelate of the one owe any obedience to the Prelate of the other; and that they who had fol∣lowed the Law of St. 
Peter,
 had endeavoured to destroy the Law of St. 
Thomas,
 for which they had been punished by him; all which is a manifest Error, Schism, and Heresy, there be∣ing but one Law to all Christians, which is that which was given and declared by Jesus Christ the Son of God, and preached by the Holy Apostles all over the World, as one Faith, one Baptism, there being but one Lord of all, and one Ca∣tholick and Apostolick Church, of which our Lord Christ, God and Man, who Founded it, is the only Spouse; and one only Universal Pa∣stor, to whom all other Prelates owe obedience, the Pope and Bishop of 
Rome,
 Successor in the Chair of St. 
Peter,
 the Prince of the Apostles; to whom our Lord Jesus Christ bequeathed that Supream Authority, and by him to his Successors; which Catholick Doctrine is necessary to Eternal Life: Wherefore the Synod doth command all Parish Priests, and Preachers, to Treat often of this matter, by reason of the great need there is of having this Bishoprick well instructed therein.








Decree VIII.


FOr that, till the very time of the most Illu∣strious Metropolitan entring into this Dio∣cess, there was a certain Heresy twice repeated in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, and twice more in the Divine Office, in calling the Patriarch of 
Babylon,
 the Universal Pastor, and Head of the Catholick Church, in all places, and as often as they happen to name him; a Title that is due only to the most Holy Father, the Bishop of 
Rome,
 Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, St. 
Peter,
 and Vicar of Christ on Earth: the Sy∣nod doth therefore command in virtue of Obe∣dience, and upon pain of Excommunication to be 
ipso facto
 incurred, that no Person of this Bi∣shoprick, Secular or Ecclesiastical, shall from henceforward presume, by Word or Writing, either in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, or in the Divine Office, or in any other occasion, to bestow that Title on the said Patriarch of 
Baby∣lon,
 or on any other Prelate, besides our Lord, the Bishop of 
Rome;
 and whosoever shall dare to contravene this Order, shall be declared Excom∣municate, and held for a Schismatick and Here∣tick, and shall be punished as such, according to the Holy Canons: And whereas the Patriarchs of 
Babylon,
 to whom this Church was subject, are 
Nestorians,
 the Heads of that cursed Sect, and Schismaticks out of the Obedience of the Holy 
Roman
 Church, and Aliens from our Holy Catho∣lick

 Faith, and are for that reason Excommuni∣cate and accursed; and it not being lawful to joyn with such in the Church in publick as stand Excommunicate: Wherefore this Bishoprick, up∣on its having now yielded a perfect Obedience to the most Holy Father, the Pope, Christ's Vicar upon Earth, to which it was obliged by Divine Authority, and upon pain of Damnation, shall not from henceforward have any manner of depen∣dance upon the said Patriarch of 
Babylon;
 and the present Synod, does under the said precept of Obe∣dience, and upon pain of Excommunication to be 
ipso facto
 incurred, prohibit all Priests, and Curates, from henceforward to name the said Patriarch of 
Babylon
 in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, or in any other Divine Office, in the Pray∣ers of the Church, even without the false Title of Universal Pastor; but instead thereof, shall name our Lord the Pope, who is our true Pastor, as also of the whole Church, and after him, the Lord Bishop of the Diocess, for the time being; and whosoever shall maliciously and knowingly act the contrary, shall be declared Excommuni∣cate, and otherwise punish'd at the pleasure of his Prelate, according to his contumacy.






Decree IX.


WHereas all the Breviaries used in this Church are 
Nestorian,
 and by the commands of Prelates of the same Sect, on a certain day the impious and false Heretick 
Nestorius
 is Comme∣morated in this Bishoprick, and a Day is kept to

 his Honour, and at other times, 
Theodorus, Dio∣dorus, Abbaratho, Abraham, Narsai, Barchauma, Johanan, Hormisda,
 and 
Michael,
 who are also 
Nestorian
 Hereticks, were likewise Commemora∣ted; 
Nestorius, Theodorus,
 and 
Diodorus,
 being commemorated on the 
Friday
 after the Nativity; and on the seventh 
Friday
 after that, 
Abraham,
 and 
Narsai,
 and all the above-named; and all of them on every 
Thursday
 in the Year, in the said 
Nestorian
 Office, and every day in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, and the Divine Office; and notwithstanding in some places they have not of late named 
Nestorius, Theodorus,
 and 
Diodorus,
 but do still continue to name 
Abraham, Narsai, Abba Barchauma, Johanan, Hormisda,
 and 
Michael,
 in the Blessing that the Priest gives to the Peo∣ple at the end of the Mass; wherein they desire 
Hormisda
 to deliver them from evil, being his Disciples; as also on all 
Fridays
 in the Year they commemorate as Saints, the said 
Hormisda, Jo∣seph, Michael, Johanan, Barchauma, Barianda, Rabba Hedsa, Machai, Hixoiau, Caurixo, Avahixo, Lixo, Xaulixo, Barmun Lixo, Metidor, Cohada Israel, Ezekiah Lixo, David Lixo, Barai Israel, Julianus Haudixo,
 &c. who were all 
Nestorian
 Hereticks, and as is evident from the said Masses, and from their Lives, Commemorations, and Praises, bestowed upon them, the Heads of the said Sect. Therefore the Synod in Virtue of Holy Obe∣dience, and upon pain of Excommunication to be 
ipso facto
 incurred, doth prohibit all Priests, and Curates, and all other Persons, as well Se∣cular,

 as Ecclesiasticks, in this Diocess at any time, either in common, or in particular, to comme∣morate any of the foresaid Hereticks, or to keep a day to them, or to celebrate their Festivities, with any Solemnity, or to make any mention of them in the Divine Offices, or in the Mass or any where else, or to direct any Prayers to them, either in common, or particular, or to make any Vows, Promises, Offerings, or any Nercha's to them; or to have their Images either in the Churches, or in their Houses; and in no wise to give them that Worship, and Veneration, which is due to Saints; and that they raze their Names out of their Books, Calendars, and Offi∣ces; and that their Masses be cut out of their Breviaries, and Missals, and burnt, and their Commemorations extinguished, that so their Me∣mory may perish among the faithful, all of them having been cursed and excommunicate Hereticks, and condemned by Holy Mother Church, and are
 at this time burning in the torments of

 Hell, for their Crimes and Heresies, and for their having been the
 followers of such a cursed Sect; the Synod doth furthermore command, that instead of them, on the 
Friday
 next after the Nativity, St. 
Athanasius,
 St. 
Gregory Nazian∣zen,
 St. 
Basil,
 St. 
John Chrysostom,
 and St. 
Cyril


 of 
Alexandria,
 shall be Commemorated; and on the seventh 
Friday
 following, St. 
Austin,
 St. 
Am∣brose, St. Gregory,
 and St. 
Ephrem,
 who was men∣tioned by them among the Hereticks, and on 
Wednesdays, All-Saints
 and Confessors together; and in the Commemorations of the Divine Offi∣ces, and Mass, they shall Commemorate all the forenamed Saints, in the place of the above-men∣tioned Hereticks; neither shall any one that shall presume to do the contrary, be absolved from the Censures he has incurred, until he hath un∣dergone a condign Penance, or such a one as his Prelate shall think fit to impose upon him, and shall thereupon be obliged to curse all the said Hereticks, and their damnable Sect, and to make Oath of the Faith publickly, and to submit to all other punishments that his Rebellion shall deserve, and if he is an Ecclesiastick, he shall moreover be suspended from his Orders, and Benefices, and punished according to the Holy Canons.








Decree X.


WHereas the Church of 
Angamale,
 called the Archbishop's, was built by 
Mar-Abraham,
 and dedicated to 
Hormisda
 the Abbot, common∣ly called St. 
Hormusio,
 who was a 
Nestorian
 He∣retick, and a great Ring-leader of that Sect, and for that reason was abhorred by all Catholicks, who are called 
Romans,
 as is reported in his Life writ in the 
Surian
 Tongue, and which was ordained to be burnt by the most Illustrious Me∣tropolitan, upon the account of the manifold Heresies and Blasphemies contained therein, and the many false Miracles said to be wrought by him, in confirmation of the 
Nestorian
 Sect: There∣fore the Synod does in virtue of Obedience, and upon pain of Excommunication, to be 
ipso facto
 incurred, prohibit the Observation of the two Festivities that have been dedicated to his Me∣mory, the one upon the first of 
September,
 the other sixteen days after 
Easter;
 and the dedi∣cating of any Church to him, commanding the abovenamed Church to be dedicated to St. 
Hor∣misda
 the Martyr, who was also a 
Persian,
 and whose Festivity is celebrated upon the 8th. of 
August,
 upon which day the Feast of the said Church shall be observed; and on the 
Retablo
 they are to make the Picture, wherein the Martyr∣dom of the said Saint shall be drawn to the best advantage, that so the People may learn to what Saint the said Church is dedicated, and all the

 Prayers and Devotion that used to be perform∣ed upon the Festivities of the Heretick 
Hormis∣da,
 may be directed to this Glorious Saint.






Decree XI.


SEeing in the Creed, or Holy Symbol of Faith, ordained by the Sacred Apostles, and declared by the Holy Councils, which is sung in the Mass, all the principal Mysteries and Articles of our Faith are contained, it is not fit that any thing should be added to it, or taken from it, but that it should be sung in this Bishoprick as it is all over the Universal Church; wherefore the Synod doth Order, that the words which are wanting in the Creed that is said in the Mass be added to it; where speaking of Christ, it it said, that he was born of the Father before all Times, there is wanting, 
God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God,
 that so it may in all things be con∣formable to what is sung in the Universal Church, using also the word 
Consubstantial
 to the Father, and not what is said instead thereof in the 
Suri∣an, Son of the Essence of the Father.






Decree XII.


NOtwithstanding it is contrary to the Sacred Canons, That the Children of Christians should go to School to Heathen Masters: Never∣theless, seeing this Church is under so many Hea∣then Kings, who many times will not suffer any

 but Infidels to be Schoolmasters; wherefore the Synod doth command and declare, That in all Schools, whether for Reading or Writing, where∣in the Masters have 
Pagods,
 to which they oblige their Children at their coming into the School to pay their Reverence, as the Custom is; that it shall not be lawful for Christian Parents or Guardians to send Christian Children to such Schools, upon pain of being proceeded against as Idolaters; but if there should be any such Schools, wherein the Heathen Masters will con∣sent that Christian Children shall pay no Reve∣rence, nor be obliged to any Heathen Ceremo∣ny, in case there is no Christian Master near, they may be sent to such Schools, their Parents in∣structing them that they must pay no reverence but only to the Master, and that they must use none of the Ceremonies of the Heathen Chil∣dren, that so they may not
 such in Idolatry as Mothers Milk. Furthermore, the Synod doth earnestly recommend it to all Towns and Villa∣ges, to do all that is in their Power to have their Children Educated by Christian Masters, and as for Reading and Writing, to have the Parish-Priests to teach them to do that in their

 Houses: But as to those masters who do oblige Christian Children to do reverence to their 
Pa∣gods;
 the Synod in virtue of Holy Obedience, and upon pain of Excommunication to be 
Ipso facto
 incurred, doth command all Fathers of Fa∣milies, and others that have charge of Children, not to consent to their going to such Schools; and doing the contrary, let them be declared Excommunicate, and be rigorously punished by the Prelate, neither shall such Children be suffer∣ed to enter the Church; as to which matter the Vicars and Priests ought to be extreamly vigi∣lant, to prevent Childrens being Educated in Ido∣latry; and where-e'er there is a Christian School-master in any Town, or near it, the Children of Christians are not to go to School to Infidels.






Decree XIII.


THe Synod being certainly informed, that there are some Christian Schoolmasters, who to conform themselves to others, and to have the more Scholars, do set up 
Pagods
 and Idols in their Schools, to which the Heathen Children pay reverence, doth command all the said School-masters, so soon as it shall be intimated to them, upon pain of Excommunication, to remove the said 
Pagods
 Idols, and Reverence out of their Schools, and not to give way to Heathen Chil∣dren, paying any such adoration; and whosoever shall be found guilty thereof, shall be declared Excommunicate, and denyed the Communion

 of the Church, and of all Christians, and dying, shall not be buried in holy Ground, nor have Christian Burial, nor have any Prayers said for them, and let this Decree be published by the Vicars of the Churches to which such do be∣long.






Decree XIV.


THe Purity of the Faith being preserved by nothing more than by Books of sound and holy Doctrine; and on the contrary, there being nothing whereby the Minds of People are more corrupted, than by Books of suspicious and He∣retical Doctrines; Errors being by their means easily insinuated into the Hearts of the Ignorant, that read or hear them: Wherefore the Synod knowing that this Bishoprick is full of Books writ in the 
Surian
 Tongue by 
Nestorian
 Hereticks, and Persons of other Devilish Sects, which abound with Heresies, Blasphemies and false Doctrines, doth command in virtue of Obedience, and up∣on pain of Excommunication to be 
ipso facto
 in∣curred, that no Person, of what quality and con∣dition soever, shall from henceforward presume to keep, translate, read or hear read to others, any of the following Books.


The Book intituled, 
The Infancy of our Saviour,
 Or 
The History of our Lady;
 condemned former∣ly by the ancient Saints, for being full of Blas∣phemies, Heresies, and fabulous Stories, where among others it is said, that the Annunciation of

 the Angel was made in the Temple of 
Jerusalem,
 where our Lady was, which contradicts the Go∣spel of St. 
Luke,
 which saith, it was made in 
Na∣zareth;
 as also that 
Joseph
 had actually another Wife and Children, when he was betrothed to the Holy Virgin; and that he often reproved the Child Jesus for his naughty Tricks; that the Child Jesus went to School to the Rabbins, and learnt of them, with a thousand other Fables and Blasphemies of the same Nature, and things un∣worthy of our Lord Christ, whereas the Gospel saith, that the 
Jews
 were astonished at his Wis∣dom, asking how he came by so much Learning, having never been taught; that the Devil tempt∣ed Christ before his Fast of forty days, which is contrary to the Gospel; that St. 
Joseph,
 to be sa∣tisfied whether the Virgin had committed Adul∣tery, carried her before the Priests, who accord∣ing to the Law gave her the Water of Jealousie to drink; that our Lady brought forth with pain, and parting from her Company, not being able to go farther, she retired to a Stable at 
Bethlehem;
 that neither our Lady, nor any other Saint is in Heaven enjoying God, but are all in a Terre∣strial Paradise, where they are to remain till the day of Judgment, with other Errors, too many to be related: But it is the Synod's pleasure to instance in some of the chief Errors contained in the Books that it condemns, that so all may be satisfied of the reason why they are prohibited to be read, or kept upon pain of Excommunica∣tion, and that all may avoid and burn them

 with the greater Horror, and for other just and necessary respects.


Also the Book of 
John Barialdan,
 wherein it is said in divers places, That there were two Per∣sons, a Divine and Humane, in Christ, which is contrary to the Catholick Faith, which confes∣ses one only Divine Person: It is also said, That the Names of Christ and 
Emanuel
 are the Names of the Humane Person only, and for that reason that the most sweet Name 
Jesus
 is not to be ado∣red; that the Union of the Incarnation is com∣mon to all the Three Divine Persons, who were all Incarnated; that our Lord Christ is the adop∣ted, and not the Natural Son of God; that the Union of the Incarnation is accidental, and is only that of Love betwixt the Divine and Hu∣mane Persons.


Also the Book intituled, 
The Procession of the Holy Spirit;
 wherein it is endeavoured to be proved at large, that the Holy Spirit proceedeth only from the Father, and not from the Son, which is contrary to the Catholick Truth, which teaches, that he proceeds from the Father and the Son.


Also the Book entituled 
Margarita Fidei,
 or 
The Jewel of Faith;
 wherein it is pretended to be prov∣ed at large, That our Lady, the most Holy Virgin, neither is, nor ought to be stiled the Mother of God, but the Mother of Christ; that in Christ there are two Persons, the one of the Word, and the other of Jesus; that the Union of the Incarnation is only an accidental Union of Love and Power, and not

 a substantial Union; that there are three distinct Faiths, which is divided into three Professions, the 
Nestorian, Jacobite
 and 
Roman;
 that the 
Ne∣storian
 is the true Faith that was taught by the Apostle, and that the 
Roman
 is false and Hereti∣cal, and was introduced by force of Arms, and the Authority of Heretical Emperors, into the greatest part of the World; that to Excommu∣nicate 
Nestorius,
 is to Excommunicate the Apo∣stles and Prophets, and the whole Scripture; that they that do not believe his Doctrine, shall not inherit Eternal Life; that they that follow 
Nestorius,
 received their Faith from the Apostles, which has been preserved to this day in the Church of 
Babylon
 of the 
Syrians,
 That 
Matrimo∣ny neither is, nor can be a Sacrament;
 that the sign of the Cross is one of the Sacraments of the Church instituted by Christ; that the Fire of Hell is Metaphorical, not real; that the 
Roman Church is fallen from the Faith, condemning it like∣wise for not celebrating in leavened Bread,
 accord∣ing to what the Church has received from the A∣postles, for which it is said the 
Romans
 are Here∣ticks.


Also the Book of the Fathers, wherein it is said, That our Lady neither is, nor ought to be called the Mother of God; that the Patriarch of 
Babylon
 of the 
Nestorians,
 is the Universal Head of the Church immediately under Christ; that the Fire of Hell is not real, but spiritual; that it is Heresie to say, that God was born, or dyed; that there are two Persons in Christ.




Also a Book of the Life of Abbot 
Isaias,
 com∣mented by a 
Nestorian,
 wherein it is said, That the Union is common to all the Three Persons; that St. 
Cyril
 of 
Alexandria,
 who condemned 
Ne∣storius,
 was an impious Heretick, and is now in Hell, for having taught, that there is but One Person in Christ; whereas, as often as 
Nestori∣us, Theodorus
 and 
Diodorus
 are named, they are stiled Saints, and blessed; by whose Authority it is there proved, that the Saints shall not en∣joy God before the day of Judgment; and that till then they shall be in an obscure place, which they call 
Eden,
 near to the Terrestrial Paradise; and that by so much the worse as any one has been, he is tormented
 the less for it in Hell, by reason of his greater conformity and friendship with the Devils; that the Word was not made

 Man, and that it is Blasphemy to affirm it; that Christ conquer'd all the Passions of Sin by a Pow∣er derived from God, and not by his own strength; that St. 
Cyril
 was a Heretick in teach∣ing, that there was but One Person in Christ; that the Divine and Humane Nature were uni∣ted in Christ accidentally by Love; that the whole Trinity was incarnated; that God dwelt in Christ as in a Rational Temple, giving him power to do all the good things he did; that the Souls of the Just will be in a Terrestrial Pa∣radise till the day of Judgment; that the Wick∣ed when they dye in Mortal Sin, are carried to a place called 
Eden,
 where they suffer only by the sense of the punishments they know they are to undergo after the day of Judgment.


Also the Book of Synods, wherein there is a forged Letter of Pope 
Caius,
 with false Subscrip∣tions of a great many other Western Bishops, di∣rected to those of 
Babylon,
 wherein it is acknow∣ledged, that the Church of 
Rome
 ought to be subject to that of 
Babylon,
 which with all that are subject to her, are immediately under Christ, without owing any reverence to the 
Roman
 Bi∣shop; they say likewise, That the 
Roman
 Church is 
fallen from the Faith,
 having perverted the Ca∣nons of the Apostles, by the force of Heretical Emperors Arms; and that the 
Romans
 are He∣reticks, for not 
celebrating in leavened Bread,
 which has been the inviolable Custom of the Church derived from our Saviour, and his Ho∣ly Apostles; that all the Bishops that followed

 
Nestorius,
 ought to be much esteemed, and when named, to be stiled 
Saints;
 and to have their Reliques reverenced: 
That Matrimony is not a Sacrament,
 that it may be dissolved for the bad conditions of the Parties: That 
Ʋsury
 is Law∣ful, and there is no Sin in it.


Also the Book of 
Timothy
 the Patriarch, where, in three Chapters, 
The most Holy Sacrament of the Altar
 is blasphemed; it being impiously asserted in them, 
That the true Body of our Lord Christ is not there, but only the Figure thereof.


Also the Letter which they pretend came down from Heaven, called the 
Letter of the Lord's day,
 wherein the 
Roman Church is accused of having fallen from the Faith,
 and having violated the 
Domingo,
 or 
Lord's-day Letter.


Also the Book called 
Maclamatas;
 wherein the distinction of two Persons in Christ, and the accedental Union of the Incarnation are pre∣tended to be proved at large, and are confirmed with several false and Blasphemous Similitudes.


Also the Book intituled 
Ʋguarda,
 or the 
Rose;
 wherein it is said, That there are two Persons in Christ; that the Union of the Incarnation was Accidental; that our Lady brought forth with Pain; and the Sons of 
Joseph,
 which he had by his other Wife, being in company, went for a Midwife to her, with other Blasphemies.


Also the Book intituled 
Camiz;
 wherein it is said, That the Divine Word, and the Son of the Virgin are not the same; and that our Lady brought forth with Pain.




Also the Book intituled 
Menra;
 wherein it is said, That our Lord Christ is only the Image of the Word; that the Substance of God dwelt in Christ as in a Temple; that Christ is next to the Divinity; that Christ was made the Com∣panion of God.


Also the Book of 
Orders;
 wherein it is said, That the Form, and not the Matter, is necessary to Orders; and the Forms therein are likewise Erroneous; that there are only two Orders, 
Di∣aconate
 and 
Priesthood;
 that Altars of Wood, and not of Stone, are to be Consecrated; there are also Prayers in it for those that are converted from any other Sect to 
Nestorianism,
 in form of an Absolution from the Excommunication they had incurred for not having followed 
Nestorius,
 and of a reconciliation to the Church.


Also the Book of 
Homilies;
 wherein it is said, That the 
Holy Eucharist is only the Image of Christ, and is distinguished from him, as an Image is from a true Man; and that the Body of our Lord Je∣sus Christ is not there, nor no where else but in Heaven:
 That the whole Trinity was Incarnate; that Christ is only the Temple of the Divinity, and God only by Representation; that the Soul of Christ descended not into Hell, but was car∣ried to the Paradise of 
Eden;
 that whosoever affirms the contrary, errs, and that we therefore err in our Creed: There are therein likewise some Letters of some Heretical Synods, in which it is said, That the Patriarch of 
Babylon
 is not subject to the 
Roman
 Bishop; with an Oath to

 be taken to the said Patriarch, as the Head of the Church, wherein People Swear to obey him, and him only, and not the Bishop of 
Rome.


Also a Book intituled, 
An Exposition of the Gospels;
 wherein it is every where pretended to be proved, That there are two Persons in Christ, and that Christ as a pure Creature, was obliged to adore God, and stood in need of Prayer; that he was the Temple of the most Holy Trinity; that Christ's Soul when he died, descended not into Hell, but was carried to the Paradise of 
Eden;
 which was the place he pro∣mised to the Thief on the Cross: That our Lady, the Virgin, deserved to be reproved for having vainly imagined, that she was Mother to one that was to be a great King; looking upon Christ as no other than a pure Man; and presuming that he was to have a Temporal Empire, as well as the res
 of the 
Jews:
 That the Evangelists did not Record all Christ's Actions in Truth as they were, they not having been present at se∣veral of them; which was the reason why they differed from one another so much: That the Wise Men that came from the 
East,
 received no favour from God, for the Journey they took; neither did they believe in Christ; that Christ was the adopted Son of God, it being as im∣possible that he should be Gods Natural Son, as it is that Just Men should be so; that he re∣ceived new Grace in Baptism, which he had not before; that he is only the Image of the Word; and the pure Temple of the Holy Spirit; that

 the 
Holy Eucharist is only the Image of the Body of Christ, which is only in Heaven at the right hand of the Father, and not here on Earth:
 That Christ, as pure Man, did not know when the day of Judgment was to be: That when St. 
Thomas
 put his Hand into Christ's Side, and said, 
My Lord, and my God!
 he did not speak to Christ; for that he that was raised was not God; but it was only an Exclamation made to God upon his beholding such a Miracle: That the Autho∣rity that Christ gave to St. 
Peter
 over the Church, was the same that he gave to other Priests; so that his Successors have no more Power or Ju∣risdiction than other Bishops: That our Lady, the Virgin, is not the Mother of God: That the first Epistle of St. 
John,
 and that of St. 
James,
 are not the Writings of thole Holy Apostles, but of some other Persons of the same Name, and therefore are not Canonical.


Also the Book of 
Hormisda Raban,
 who is stiled a Saint; wherein it is said, That 
Nestorius
 was a Saint, and Martyr, and suffered for the Truth; and that St. 
Cyril,
 who persecuted him, was the Priest and Minister of the Devil, and is now in Hell: 
That Images are filthy and a∣bominable Idols, and ought not to be adored;
 and that St. 
Cyril,
 as a Heretick invented and intro∣duced them: There are also many false Mira∣cles Recorded in this Book, which are said to have been wrought by 
Hormisda
 in confirmati∣on of the 
Nestorian
 Doctrine; with an Account of what he suffered from the Catholicks, for being obstinate in his Heresy.




Also the Book of 
Lots,
 into which they put that they call the 
Ring of
 Solomon, with a great many more Superstitions, for the choice of good Days to Marry upon, and for several other uses; wherein are contained many Blasphemies, and Heathenish Observances; as also all other Books of 
Lots,
 and for chusing of Days, the Synod prohibits under the same Censure.


Also the Book written after the manner of
 
Flos Sanctorum;
 wherein are contained the Lives of a great many 
Nestorian
 Hereticks, who are there called Saints; and not only that entire Book, but also any of the Lives contained there∣in, which may be current separately; namely, those of 
Abraham,
 stiled the 
Great,
 of 
George Ab∣bot Cardeg,
 whom they call a Martyr; 
Jacob, Abban, Saurixo, Johanan, Gauri, Raban, Sabacat, Ocama, Daniel, Barcaula, Raban Nuna, Jacob, Rabai
 the Great, 
Dadixo, Jomarusia, Schalita,

 Ihab, Abimelech
 the Expositor, 
Abraham,

Abraham Natpraya, Jobcarder, John, Ircasca, Ne∣storius, Jaunam, Barcurra, Raban Gabarona, Scha∣bibi, Barcima, Titus, Raban Sapor, Gregory

 Bishop, 
Joseph, Azaya, Isahaha
 Bishop, 
Jacob,
 whom they call a Prophet, 
Ixaiahu, Eu∣nuco Ramain, Jobar Malchi:
 Who were all 
Ne∣storian
 Hereticks, and the chief followers of that cursed Sect, as is evident from their Lives, which are full of Heresies, Blasphemies, and false and
 fabulous Miracles, with which they pretend to Authorize their Sect.




Also the Book called 
Parisman,
 or the 
Persian Medicine,
 which is full of Sorceries, teaching certain Methods whereby one may do mischief to their enemies, and may gain Women, and for a great ma∣ny other lewd and prohibited purposes; there are likewise in it strange Names of Devils, of whom they affirm, that whosoever shall carry the Names of seven of them about him writ in a Paper, shall be in no danger of any Evil: It contains also many
 Superstitious Exorcisms for the casting out of De∣vils; mixing some Godly words with others that are not Intelligible; and with the Invocation of the most Holy Trinity, oftentimes desiring the doing

 of lewd things, and enormous sins, joyning the Merits of 
Nestorius
 and his followers, many times, in the same Prayer with those of the blessed Virgin, and those of their Devils, with those of the Holy Angels; all which is very common in this Diocess; most Curates having this Book, and making use of it to this very day; all which sort of Books the Sy∣nod prohibits in this Diocess under the forementi∣oned censures; and whosoever from henceforwards shall be found to have any of them, besides the cen∣sure they have incurred thereby, shall be severely punished by their Prelate.






Decree XV.


BUt the forementioned Heresies are not only to be met with in these Books, but are like∣wise in the Common Prayer, and Breviaries that they use in their Churches, which having been composed by 
Nestorian
 Hereticks, are full of Blasphemies, Heresies, Fables, and Apocry∣phal stories, whereby instead of praising God, they are continually blaspheming him in their Divine Offices.


In the Book called the 
Great Breviary,
 it is said, That the Divine Word did not assume Flesh, ignorantly pretending to prove it thus; because if the Word had assumed Flesh, to what purpose was the Holy Spirit's overshadowing the Virgin? In the same Breviary the whole Office of Ad∣vent is Heretical, it being every where affirmed therein, that Christ had two Persons, and calling

 him continually only the Temple of God; and in the Feast of the Nativity, there is a proposi∣tion in one of the solemn Antiphona's, that di∣rectly contradicts St. 
John,
 in which it is said, that 
the Word was not made Flesh,
 and that all that be∣lieve the contrary, are disobedient to the Church, and are obstinate Rebels against the Faith; so that the whole Offices of the Advent and Nativi∣ty are little else than pure Blasphemy.


In the Book of Prayers for the great Fast, it is frequently said, that there were two Persons, a Divine and Humane in Christ. It contains al∣so several Commemorations of 
Nestorius,
 and o∣ther Hereticks his Followers, affirming 
Marndeay, Theodorus
 and 
Diodorus,
 and other 
Nestorian
 He∣reticks, to have been the Followers of St. 
E∣phrem.


In the Greater Breviary, which they call 
Hudre
 and 
Gaza,
 or 
The Treasure of Prayers,
 it is every where said, that there are two Persons in Christ, and one representation of the Son of God; that he is the Image of the Word, and the Temple of the same; that the Divine Person did enlighten the Humane, and that Christ advanced in Grace and Knowledge by degrees; that our Lady never carried God in her Womb, as Hereticks affirm, Christ being a Man like to others, and that she ought not to be called the Mother of God, but only the Mother of the second 
Adam;
 that the whole Trinity assumed Humanity, and that St. 
Matthew
 taught the 
Hebrews
 so; that God did not make himself Flesh, which he only took as

 a Dwelling to cover his Glory; that God ac∣companyed Christ on the Cross, but had not ta∣ken the Humanity, neither was it God that suf∣fered; that the Word of the Father changed it self into Humanity, and by the Son of 
Mary
 re∣deemed Mankind; that the Father Eternal took Flesh in the same manner as the Son; that the Angel delivered his Message to the Virgin in the Temple, and not at 
Nazareth;
 that the pains of travail opened the Womb of the Virgin, who brought forth with labour after the manner of other Women; that
 
in the most Holy Sacra∣ment of the Eucharist, there is not the true Body of Christ;
 with a thousand more Blasphemies about

 it; that 
Nestorius
 was a Preacher of Truth; and in several places God is praised for having de∣clared the Truth to 
Theodorus
 and 
Diodorus,
 who was Master to 
Nestorius;
 and in several Prayers they beseech God to chastise those that believe otherwise than 
Nestorius,
 and his Followers, whose Faith they say is founded on St. 
Peter
's, and the rest of the Apostles; Moreover it is said, that the Holy Virgin, and her Spouse 
Jo∣seph,
 appeared before the Priests, who could not tell how she had conceived; and 
that Images are Idols, and ought not to be adored, nor so much as kept in Churches or in Houses of Christians;
 there are likewise Offices of 
Nestorius
 and his Follow∣ers, and Commemorations of several Here∣ticks.


In the Office for Priests departed, it is sung, That in the most holy Sacrament of the Altar, 
there is only the Virtue of Christ, but not his true Bo∣dy

 and Blood;
 all which Books and Breviaries, tho' they do well deserve to be burnt, for these and other Errors that they contain, yet there being no other at present in this Diocess, for the keeping up of Divine Service, and the celebra∣tion of Religious Offices, until such time as they shall be furnished with new Breviaries, which the Synod desires they may speedily, and that some may be Printed for them at St. 
Peter
's in 
Rome;
 the Synod doth order them to be corre∣cted and purged from all their Errors, and Com∣memorations of Hereticks, and the entire Offices for all such; and the Offices of Advent and the Nativity to be entirely tore out of their Brevia∣ries and burnt, entreating the most Illustrious Metropolitan to see it done at his next Visitati∣on in all the Churches of the Diocess, command∣ing all Curates in virtue of Obedience, and up∣on pain of Excommunication to be 
ipso facto
 in∣curred, to produce the said Books, and all the other Books that they have, as well of publick as of private Use, and of Prayers, as well as of the Mass, before the said Lord Metropolitan at his Visitation, in order to their being corrected by Persons appointed for that work, in confor∣mity to what is here ordained.






Decree XVI.


FOR the preservation of the Purity of the Faith, the Synod does command all Priests, Curates, and all other Persons, of whatsoever

 Condition, or Quality, within this Bishoprick, in virtue of Obedience, and upon pain of Ex∣communication within two Months after the pub∣lication thereof shall come to their knowledge, to deliver all the Books they have written in the 
Syrian
 Tongue, either with their own hands, or by some other Person, to the most Illustrious Metro∣politan, which they may do at the Visitation that he intends to hold speedily, or to Father 
Francisco Roz,
 of the Society of Jesus, Professor of the 
Syrian
 Tongue in the College of 
Vaipicotta,
 or to the said College, in order to their being perused and corrected, or destroyed, as shall be thought most convenient, the Books of Com∣mon Prayer being excepted, which are to be emended in the form abovesaid; and under the same Precept of Obedience, and pain of Excom∣munication, the Synod does command, That no Person, of what Condition or Quality soever within this Bishoprick, shall presume to translate any Book into the 
Syrian
 Tongue, without ex∣press License from the Prelate, with a Declara∣tion of the Book to which it is granted, the Books of Holy Scripture and Psalms only except∣ed; and until such time as this Church shall be provided with a Bishop, the most Illustrious Me∣tropolitan doth commit the Power of granting all such Licenses to the Reverend Father 
Fran∣cisco Roz,
 of the Society of Jesus, by reason of his great skill in those Books, and in the 
Chaldee
 and 
Syrian
 Languages.








Decree XVII.


SEeing the Purity of Faith and good Manners doth very much depend on the Doctrine that is preached to the People; wherefore the Synod, being informed that there are several ig∣norant Curates who do take upon them to preach, and make Discourses in publick, where∣in they teach several Errors and Heresies that they meet with in Books that they do not un∣derstand, and several fabulous and Apocryphal things, those especially which they take out of the Book of the 
Infancy of our Saviour,
 and other Apocryphal and Heretical writings, doth com∣mand that none presume to preach, or make any set Discourse to the People, but who are Licen∣sed by the Prelate in Writing, who shall first exa∣mine them diligently, as to their sufficiency and Doctrine, according to the Holy Council of 
Trent;
 and when there shall happen to be no Prelate during the vacancy of the See, the most Illu∣strious Metropolitan doth commit the care there∣of to the Rector of the Jesuits College of 
Vaipai∣cotta
 in this Diocess, that so he, and such of the Fathers as he shall name, may make the said Examinations, of which they shall give a Certi∣ficate sealed by the Rector; and at the next Vi∣sitation the Lord Metropolitan shall name such as shall appear to him to be most for the benefit of the People of this Bishoprick, in order to their being rightly instructed; and whosoever

 shall, without having undergone such an Exami∣nation, and without having obtained a License thereupon, in writing, under the hand of the Bishop, or Prelate, presume to preach, or make any Discourses to the People, shall be suspended from their Office and Benefice for a Year; never∣theless, all Vicars may in their own Churches make such Discourses to their People, as they shall judge necessary, out of the Holy Scriptures, and other approved Books; to which end the Synod doth earnestly desire, that there may be a Catechism made in the 
Malabar
 Tongue, out of which there may be every 
Sunday
 something read to the People: And whereas the Synod is informed that the most Illustrious Metropolitan is already about such a Work, and has reason to hope that it may be done by the end of the Visitation, it doth command, so soon as it is finish∣ed and published, That all Vicars do every 
Sun∣day
 at the time of Offering, or before, or after Mass, read a Chapter of the same to the People in conformity to the Orders they shall receive.






Decree XVIII.


WHereas, through the Ignorance and bad Doctrines of the Priests of this Diocess, occasioned by their having been accustomed to read Heretical and Apocryphal Books, they do many times deliver Errors, and fabulous Stories, in their Sermons, and Admonitions to the People, without knowing what they say themselves:

 Therefore, to prevent the Peoples being mis∣taught, the Synod doth command, That when∣soever it should be proved to the Prelate, that any such thing has been delivered in pub∣lick, or in any Congregation, that the Prelate ha∣ving drawn up a Form of Recantation in Wri∣ting, shall send to the said Curates, or the Per∣sons that have delivered such things, comman∣ding them to retract and unsay the same in pub∣lick, either by reading the said Recantation, or by declaring the Contents of it to the People, and teaching them the Truth; which if any shall refuse to do, which God forbid, they shall be declared Excommunicate, and shall be punished according to the Holy Canons, and the quality of the Matter they delivered; which shall be executed with great rigour, if it shall appear to have been spoke with Knowledge and Malice; but where it shall be found to have flow'd from Ig∣norance, and an innocent Mind, it shall suffice that a ready Obedience be paid to the said Satis∣faction and Recantation.






Decree XIX.


THe Synod having been informed of several Meetings that were in this Diocess, upon the death of Bishop 
Mar-Abraham,
 in which both publick and private Oaths were taken, against yielding Obedience to the Holy 
Roman
 Church, several Curates, and others, obliging themselves never to consent to any change either in the

 Government of the Bishoprick, or in matters of Faith, nor to receive any Bishop that should be sent to them by the Holy Apostolical See, or by any other way, than by the Order of the Schisma∣tical, Heretical, 
Nestorian
 Patriarch of 
Babylon,
 with several other particulars, contrary to the Sacred Canons, and the Obedience that is due to the most Holy 
Roman
 Pontificate; doth declare all
 such Oaths, or any other taken, or that shall be taken in the same manner, to be void, and of no force; and that they do not only not ob∣lige the Consciences of those that have taken them, but that as they were rashly and maliciously taken, so it is an Impiety and Schism to keep them; denouncing the Sentence of the greater Excommunication upon all those that made them, or took them; This Synod having above all o∣ther things promised and sworn to yield Obedi∣ence to the Commands of the Pope, and the Holy Apostolical See, according to the Holy Ca∣nons, and never to receive any Bishop or Pre∣late, but what shall be sent by the Holy 
Roman
 Church, to which it of right belongs to provide Prelates and Bishops to all the Churches in the World, and to receive those that he shall send, without any doubt or scruple, acknowledging them for the true Prelates and Pastors of their Souls, without waiting for any other Order, besides that of the Bishop of 
Rome,
 notwithstan∣ding

 any impious Oaths that may have been made at any time to the contrary.






Decree XX.


THis present Synod, together with all the Priests and faithful People of this Diocess, doth embrace all the Holy General Councils re∣ceived by Holy Mother Church, believing and confessing all that was determined in them, ana∣thematizing, rejecting, and condemning all that they have rejected and condemned; but especi∣ally it doth with great Veneration receive and embrace the first Holy Council of 
Ephesus,
 con∣sisting of 200 Fathers, firmly believing all that was therein determined, and rejecting and con∣demning whatsoever it condemned; but above all, the Diabolical Heresy of the 
Nestorians,
 which has been for many Years preached and be∣lieved in this Diocess; which together with its Author 
Nestorius,
 and all his Followers, the said Council did reject, and anathematize; who be∣ing taught by the Devil, held that there were Two Persons in our Lord Christ; affirming also, that the Divine Word did not take Flesh, into the Unity of its Person, but only for an Habitation, or Holy Dwelling, as a Temple; and that it ought not to be said, that God was In∣carnate, or that he Died, nor that our Lady, the Glorious Virgin, was the Mother of God, but only the Mother of Christ, with other Diaboli∣cal Heresies, all which this Synod does condemn,

 reject, and anathematize, embracing the Holy Catholick Faith, in that purity and integrity, that it is believed, and professed in, by the Ho∣ly Mother 
Roman
 Church, the Mistress of all Churches, to which in all things it submits it self according to the profession it has made. Further∣more, this Synod does acknowledge the Glo∣rious 
Cyril
 Archbishop and Patriarch of 
Alex∣andria,
 who by Order of the Bishop of 
Rome,
 presided in the Holy 
Ephesan
 Council, to be a Blessed Saint, at this time enjoying God in Hea∣ven; and that his Doctrine in the said Council against the 
Nestorians,
 is Holy, and universally received in the Catholick Church, professing all that reject it, to be Excommunicated Hereticks.






Decree XXI.


FUrthermore, This present Synod, with all the Priests and faithful People of this Dio∣cess, doth embrace the last
 Holy and Sacred Council of 
Trent,
 and does not only believe and

 confess all that was determined and approved of therein, and reject, and anathematize all that that Council rejected and condemned; but doth moreover receive and embrace the said Council as to all matters therein determined, relating to the reformation of the Church, and all Christian People, promising and swearing to Govern it self according to the Rules thereof, and to ob∣serve the same Forms that are observed in the Catholick Church, and as are observed in this Province of the 
Indies,
 and in all the other Pro∣vinces, and Suffragans to the Metropolis of 
Goa;
 in order to the removing of all Abuses and Cu∣stoms that are contrary to the Decrees of the said Council of 
Trent;
 by which only it is resolved to Govern it self as to all matters relating to the Government of the Church, and the Refor∣mation of the Manners of this faithful and Ca∣tholick People, any Customs, tho' immemorial, in this Bishoprick, to the contrary notwithstanding.






Decree XXII.


THis present Synod, together with all the Priests and faithful People of this Diocess, doth with great submission, and reverence, sub∣mit it self to the Holy, Upright, Just and Neces∣sary Court of the Holy Office of the
 Inquisition,

 in these Parts Established; and being sensible how much the Integrity of the Faith depends upon that Tribunal, it does promise and swear to be obedient to all its Commands in all things there∣unto pertaining; being, after the Example of all other Bishopricks in this Province, willing that all matters of Faith should be judged of by the same Court, or by such Persons as it shall de∣pute: And notwithstanding the said Holy Office has not hitherto, by reason of this Church's ha∣ving been separated, and had little or no cor∣respondence

 with the Apostolical See, or with any of the Churches that are subject to it, med∣led with any Persons belonging to this Bishop∣rick, yet now for the benefit of their Souls, as to Absolutions in cases of Faith, which are known to be reserved to that Court; This present Sy∣nod doth beseech the Lords Inquisitors to Autho∣rize some Learned Men within this Bishoprick, or the Jesuits of the College of 
Vaipicotta,
 and of other residences of the same Religion in the said Diocess, to Absolve all such as shall stand in need thereof, and that with such limitations as they shall think fit; considering how difficult it is for the People inhabiting the 
Serra,
 to have recourse to the Tribunal at 
Goa;
 neither can it be otherwise, considering that they live in the midst of Infidels, but that such necessary Cases will sometimes happen, and especially to rude and ignorant People.






Decree XXIII.


THe Preservation of the Purity of the Faith, and the prevention of Peoples being cor∣rupted with false and strange Doctrines, being a thing of the greatest importance; this Synod doth therefore command all Persons, of what Quality or Condition soever in this Bishoprick, that whensoever they shall happen to know of any Christians doing, speaking, or writing any thing that is contrary to the Holy Catholick Faith, or of any that shall give assistance or

 countenance thereunto, to
 dilate them with all possible Expedition and Secrecy to the Prelate, or to the Vicars of the Church, or to some o∣ther faithful Person, who will immediately give an account thereof, that so such a course may be forthwith taken, as the necessity of the Mat∣ter shall require; the Synod in virtue of Obedi∣ence commanding the said Vicars, and Persons to whom such things shall be denounced to intimate them with all possible speed.








ACTION IV. Of the Sacraments of Baptism, and Confirmation.


THe Holy Sacraments of the Gospel, instituted by our Saviour and Redeemer Jesus Christ the Son of God, for the Remedy and Salvation of Men, and to which he hath applyed the Vir∣tue of his Holy Passion, and infinite Merits, and by which all true Holiness begins in us, and be∣ing begun, is encreased, and being lost is reco∣vered, are
 Seven, to wit, 
Baptism, Confirmation,
 the 
Eucharist, Penitence, Extream Ʋnction, Or∣der,


 and 
Matrimony:
 All which do differ much from the Sacraments of the Old Law, which did not cause, but did only signifie the Grace that was to be given by the Passion of Christ, where∣as our Sacraments do contain Grace, and give it to all those that receive them worthily; the first 
five
 were ordained for the Spiritual perfe∣cting of every Man only with relation to him∣self, the 
two last
 were appointed for the good Government and encrease of the Church; by 
Baptism
 we are spiritually born again to God; by 
Confirmation
 we are advanced in Grace, for∣tified in the Faith, and being Regenerated and strengthened, we are supported by the Divine Food of the 
Eucharist,
 and Sacrament of the Al∣tar; and when we chance by Sin to fall into any di∣stemper of Soul, we are Spiritually restored by 
Penitence,
 and both Spiritually and Corporally by 
Extream Ʋnction;
 by the Sacrament of 
Or∣der,
 the Church is governed, and Spiritually multiplied, and by 
Matrimony
 Corporally: All these Sacraments are perfected by three Causes; that is, Things as their matter, Words as their form, and the Person that is to administer them with an
 Intention of doing what the Church

 doth; and where any of these three Causes are wanting, they are not perfect, neither indeed is any Sacrament administer'd; all the Ceremonies and Rites, approved and made use of by Holy Mother Church, in the administration of the Sa∣craments are holy, and cannot be despised, neg∣lected, or
 changed for others without a great Sin, notwithstanding they do not appertain to the In∣tegrity



 or Essence of the Sacraments; there are three that imprint a Spiritual sign on the Soul, that can never be blotted out; it is called a 
Character,
 which is the reason why those Sacra∣ments are never to be repeated; they are 
Bap∣tism, Confirmation
 and 
Orders;
 the other four, that is, 
Penitence,
 the 
Eucharist, Extream Ʋn∣ction,
 and 
Matrimony,
 imprint no Spiritual Sign in the Soul, and so may be repeated with due Order; but tho' these seven Sacraments are all Divine, and do contain Grace, and dispense it to their worthy Receivers, deserving our most profound Reverence and Adoration, on the ac∣count of the Majesty of their Institutor, who was our Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, as also for the assistance of the Holy Spirit, who operates in conjunction with them; and for the virtue that is in them for the curing of Souls, the Treasure of the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, being deposited in them, and dispensed to us by their means; Nevertheless this does not hinder, but that in some respects, some of them may be more worthy than others, and may de∣serve a greater reverence and veneration. These Sacraments were all instituted by our Lord Je∣sus Christ before his Ascention into Heaven, that so by their means he might communicate Grace, and other Spiritual Benefits, he had merited for us by his Death on the Cross, confirming them to the faithful by his Word and Promises, that so by using them lawfully, and with due dispo∣sitions, we might be ascertained of his commu∣nicating

 himself, and all the fruits of his Passion to us, in every one of them, in such a manner as he represents himself in them.




The Doctrine of the Holy Sacrament of Baptism.


THe first of all the Sacraments is that of 
Bap∣tism,
 which is the Gate of the Spiritual Life, and that whereby we are made capable of the other Sacraments, of which without it we are no ways capable; for as a Man must first be born, before he can enjoy the good things of the Na∣tural Life, so Men before they are born again in Baptism, are not capable of enjoying the hea∣venly advantages of a Spiritual Life, it being by Baptism that we are made Members of Christ, and are incorporated into the Christian Com∣mon-wealth, and the Mystical Body of the Church; for as by the first man Death came up∣on all, for the Sin of Disobedience committed by him and us, for which Sin we were exclu∣ded the Kingdom of Heaven, and were born Children of Wrath, and separated from God, so that without being born again of Water and the Spirit, we cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, as Christ himself has taught us; so that as we were born Children of Wrath, by Baptism we return to be Children of Grace, and as we were born in sin the Sons of Men, in Baptism we are born the Sons of God; all that are bap∣tized

 in Christ, as St. Paul hath it, having put on Christ: The Matter of this Sacrament, is true, natural, and common Water, as of the Sea, Ri∣vers, Fountains, Lakes, or Rain, and no other, tho' never so pure and clean; all others being Liquors, and not natural Water: The Form is, 
I Baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
 The Minister of this Sacrament is a Priest, to whom it belongs by virtue of his Office; but in case of necessity, not only a Priest or Deacon, but a Lay-man, or Woman, nay an Infidel, a 
Mahometan,
 a Here∣tick, or 
Jew:
 In a word, any Person that can Baptize, using the Form of the Church, and in∣tending to do what she does, may administer this Sacrament: For seeing none can be saved without being Baptized, therefore as our Lord ordained Water, than which nothing is more ready at hand, to be the matter of this Sacrament, so he would exclude no Man from being the Mini∣ster thereof; the effects and virtue of this Sacra∣ment, is, the pardon and remission of all sins O∣riginal and Actual, and of all punishments due to them; for which reason there is no Penance to be enjoyned those that are Baptized, for any sin they committed before Baptism, all that die after Baptism, before they have committed any sin, going directly to Heaven, where they enjoy the Divine Vision for ever.






Decree I.


WHereas in the Examination of the Forms of the administration of the Sacraments of the Church in this Diocess, made by the most Re∣verend Metropolitan in his last Visitation, he found that in divers Churches there were diffe∣rent Forms used, and written in the Baptisteries, some Curates using the Form following;
 N. 
is Baptized and perfected, in the name of the Father, Amen; in the name of the Son, Amen; in the name of the Holy Ghost, Amen:
 Others using the 
Greek
 Form, saying, 
Baptizetur servus Christi, in nomine Patris, Amen; in nomine Filii, Amen; in nomine Spiritûs Sancti, Amen.
 The Synod in virtue of Obedience, and upon pain of Excommunication to be 
ipso facto
 incurred, doth command, that no Person shall presume hereafter to use either these, or any other Forms, but that which is used in the Holy 
Roman
 Church; 
I Baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;
 and that all other Forms be blot∣ted out of their Baptisteries, and Books, and this be put in their place.






Decree II.


THis Synod being informed, That at divers times they have used different Forms of Baptism in this Diocess, which were introduced

 by Schismatical and Ignorant Prelates, some of which were not Legitimate, neither was the Sa∣crament administred by them, as was declared by the most Illustrious Metropolitan, and others, after a strict Examination; and others were very doubtful, doth therefore in the name of the Holy Ghost, desire and command all the faith∣ful Christians of this Diocess to declare to the said Metropolitan at the Visitation he intends to make of the Churches of this Diocess, or to Per∣sons deputed by him, the time when they were Baptized, that so according to the Form that was then used, a saving remedy may be provided, in conformity to what shall be ordained therein, and that all submit themselves to whatsoever he shall be pleased to order.






Decree III.


FOrasmuch as the Synod is informed, that there are many Persons in this Diocess, and especially among those that live in the Heaths, and are far from any Church, who tho' they are not Baptized, yet being of a Christian race, do pro∣fess themselves Christians, and when they come where there is a Church, do go to it and receive the Holy Sacraments with others, and out of meer shame of letting it be known that they are not Christened, do die without Bap∣tism; and others because they will not pay the Fees, which are Simoniacally demanded of them: It doth therefore command all Vicars of Chur∣ches

 to make diligent inquiry through their whole Parishes and the Heaths, to see if there are any that are not Christened, besides the search that the most Illustrious Metropolitan does intend at his next Visitation, as he did at his former; and that the said Vicars on the high Festivals, upon which those that live in the Heaths do usually come to Church, shall admonish them all in ge∣neral, that in case there are any among them that have never been baptized, or that have some reason to doubt whether they have or not, that they go to them and acquaint them therewith in private, that so they may be secretly Christen∣ed, and without paying any Fee, letting them know that they are not Christians, nor capable of inheriting Eternal Life, nor of receiving the Holy Sacraments without being baptized; and all Prea∣chers shall frequently give the same admonition, and all Confessors must be careful to ask all rude Christians that live in the Heaths, whether they have been baptized, and in case it appear doubt∣ful, they shall then baptize them privately. The Synod grants the same License to all Priests with∣in or without this Diocess, to baptize all such se∣cretly, in what place soever they shall think fit.






Decree IV.


THE Synod being informed that there are some small Villages in this Diocess, which, by reason of the great distance they are at from any Church, and through the negligence of their

 Prelates and Priests, tho' they call themselves Christians of St. 
Thomas,
 because descended of such, yet are not Baptized, having nothing of Christians but the bare name, doth command a diligent enquiry to be made into this matter, recommending the same to the most Reverend Metropolitan, and commanding all Vicars of Churches to search all places bordering upon their Parishes, and to oblige all such to be Bap∣tized: The Synod doth likewise command Chap∣pels to be built in or near to all such Villages, and to be provided with such Curates as may in∣struct them in all matters of Faith, that so there may be none in all these parts that call them∣selves Christians of St. 
Thomas,
 but what are Baptized; and of some Parish where they may receive the Sacraments.






Decree V.


BY reason of the great negligence that is so visible in the Christians of this Bishoprick, in bringing their Children to be baptized within eight days after they are born, according to the Custom of the Church, but chiefly among those that live at a considerable distance from any Church, whose Children are many times some Months or Years old before they are Christen'd; the Synod doth strictly command, That all Chil∣dren be baptized on the 8th. day after they are born, according to the custom of the Univer∣sal Church, without there should be some dan∣ger

 of their dying before, in which case they ought to be Christened immediately, or that it should so happen, that if they are not baptized sooner, they cannot be in a long time, in which case also they ought to be presently Christened; and for those that live in 
Heaths,
 and far from any Church, if they should not be able to bring their Children to be baptized on the eighth day, they must not fail to bring them betwixt the fifteenth and the twentieth; and all that are found to be negligent herein, let them be punish'd severely; and whosoever shall neglect to bring their own Children, or others that they have the charge of, tho' their Slaves, to Baptism for above a Month, let them be thrown out of the Church, neither shall it be lawful for any Priest to go to their Houses, or to give them the 
Casturi,
 or a Visit, no not in order to perswade them to bring their Children to Baptism: But if it should be probable that the length of the Way might en∣danger the Child's Life, then let the Father or Guardian signifie so much to the Vicar of the Church to which they belong, that a fit remedy may be taken therein, that the 
Baptism
 of the Infant be no longer deferred; and in such Cases the Synod doth command all Vicars either in Person, or by some other Priest, to hasten to go; the doing thereof with diligence being one of the highest Duties of their Function.








Decree VI.


THe present Synod doth condemn the Custom or Abuse which has hitherto obtained in this Diocess, of not Baptizing the Infants of Pa∣rents that are Excommunicated, for fear of ha∣ving some Communion with them, by which means it often happens, that Children continue unbaptized for many Years, thereby running a great hazard of dying without Baptism; and ordaining the contrary, commands the Children of Excommunicated Parents to be Christen'd as well as others, and to that intent declares, That they that go into such Families to fetch such Children, or shall carry or accompany them to Church, shall incurr no censure or punishment whatsoever for so doing; nevertheless, the Per∣sons that are Excommunicated shall not be suf∣fer'd to go along with them, nor shall o∣thers go to any Feast or Banquet at their Houses which they may have made on that occasion.






Decree VII.


THe Synod doth exhort and admonish all Fa∣thers and Mothers, and all other Persons that are present at Womens Labour, to be care∣ful not to suffer any Infant to die without Bap∣tism: Wherefore if they shall perceive the Child when it is born, to be weak, or in danger of dying presently, they shall then, if it can be

 done, call the Vicar, or in his absence any other Priest, to come immediately to Baptize the In∣fant; but if the danger shall be such as not to admit of any delay, in that case any Person that is present shall Baptize it in the Church; throw∣ing Water upon its Face, and saying, 
I Baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Amen:
 which shall be done by Ecclesiasticks, if any are present, rather than Laicks, and by Men, rather than Women, if they know the 
Form;
 but if they do not, then any one that knows it may perform it; and when Infants are in danger of dying in the birth, in case the Head or any other principal Member doth appear, tho' the whole Body should not, they shall sprinkle the Member that appears with Wa∣ter, using the 
Form.
 And as for those that have been Baptized in this manner, if they shall hap∣pen to live, and it shall be proved that they were Baptized on the Head, or the greater part of the Body, they shall not then be Christen'd again, but shall only be carried to the Church to be anointed with the Holy Oils; but if the Baptism was perfor∣med on any other part, they shall then be Bap∣tized again, but with a Condition, saying, 
If thou art not Baptized, I Baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen:
 And after the same manner Priests, and others shall behave themselves, as to such Per∣sons of whose Baptism they have any reason to doubt; provided, if there are any other pre∣sent, it shall not be lawful for the Parents of

 such Infants to Baptize them, that they may not contract the Spiritual Relation of Godfather, or Godmother; but in case there should be no body else present, and the Child should be in apparent danger of Death, in such a case of ne∣cessity, the Father or Mother must Baptize it.






Decree VIII.


THe Synod doth earnestly recommend to all People, to procure Christian 
Daia's
 or Midwives in all their Towns, and such as know the Form of Baptism, and are able to succour the necessities of Infants when born in danger: And whereas Infidel 
Daia's
 do use a great many Ceremonies and Superstitions with Infants, which are foreign to the purity and integrity of the Gospel, and especially such of them as are 
Ma∣hometans;
 the Vicars shall therefore take care frequently to instruct all their People, but espe∣cially the 
Daia's,
 in the Form of Baptism, that so every body may know how to succour the necessities of Infants when they are born; and the Confessors of the 
Daia's
 must be sure to ex∣amine them as to the said Form, and having in∣structed them therein, shall acquaint them how much it is their duty to be perfect in it.








Decree IX.


THe Synod doth command, That no Person presume to keep an Infidel Slave without Baptizing him; whom, if they are Infants, they shall Baptize presently; and if come to years of discretion, they shall take care to instruct in the Faith, in order to make them Christians, but without any manner of Compulsion, besides that of continual Persuasion; and whosoever should be found to have an Infidel Child that is not Baptized, or one that is of Age and does desire to be, shall be severely punished by the Prelate, and the Parties shall be Christened: In this the Vicars ought to be extreamly vigilant, and espe∣cially when they make the Roll of Confessions, and inquire what Persons are in every Family, and who are not Christians, and why they are not.






Decree X.


THere being some Christians so unmindful of their Christian Obligations, as to sell Christians to Infidels, contrary to the Holy Canons, who by that means are certainly constrained to Apostatize from the Faith; wherefore the Synod in virtue of Obedience, and upon pain of Excommunica∣tion to be 
ipso facto
 incurred, doth command, That no Christian presume to Sell any of the Faithful to Infidels; and that whosoever shall be found to have done it, shall be forthwith

 declared Excommunicate, and shall not be Ab∣solved, until he hath redeemed the said Chri∣stian, tho' he should cost him more than what he sold him for; or until it shall be manifest to the Vicar of the Church, and to other Curates, and the whole People, that it cannot be done; in which case he shall not be Absolved until by way of Penance he has refunded the Money that he received, with which the Vicar and Church-wardens shall buy an Infidel, whom they shall 
Christen,
 great numbers of such being sold daily in 
Malabar;
 and the Person so bought shall have his liberty, and shall be cemmitted to the care of some devout substan∣tial Christian that will Educate him for God's sake. Moreover, the Synod in virtue of Obedi∣ence, doth prohibit all Christians to Sell any Boys or Girls, tho' they are not Baptized, to any 
Ma∣hometan, Jew,
 or 
Heathen;
 it being certain, that such when sold to Infidels, will never come to the knowledge of the Faith; tho' when it is ne∣cessary, and they are their lawful Slaves, they may sell them to other Christians: Whosoever shall transgress herein, shall be severely punish∣ed, except the Person that was sold was Twenty Years of Age; and it is manifest to the Vicar, to whom he shall be carried before he is sold, that he refused to be Baptized.








Decree XI.


THe Heathens of these Parts being so strange∣ly addicted to 
Auguries,
 and Superstitions, as sometimes to kill their Children which are born on those days which they reckon to be Un∣lucky, imagining they must be miserable if they live, the Mothers, that they may not Murther them with their own hands, leaving them in Heaths, or at the bottom of some Tree, or in a Ditch, there to perish; wherefore the Synod doth command all the faithful Christians of this Bishoprick, That whereas living among such Hea∣thens, and being their Neighbours, they cannot for the most part but know what passes in their Houses, to be very watchful in this case; and whensoever they shall know of any Infants be∣ing thus exposed, or shall find them at any time in the Heaths, to carry them home to their Houses, and cherish them with Christian Charity, either Baptizing them themselves, or procuring it to be done; and if when they find them, they shall apprehend them to be near dying, notwithstanding they may know that their Pa∣rents will take it ill of them, who by thus ex∣posing them have lost their dominion over them, they shall Baptize them immediately, whereby the Church will acquire a right in them, and as a Holy Mother, is glad to receive them; and if it should so happen that those by whom they are found, are not in a condition to breed them

 up, they shall then carry them to the Vicar, and the other Curates of the Church, whom we com∣mand in the name of Christ, to call together the chief Men of the Parish, to take some course a∣bout the bringing up of the Child; and if there is no well-disposed Person that will for the love of God, take the charge thereof upon him, they shall then procure a Nurse, and whatsoever else is necessary, if there can be no other way found, out of the Alms and Fabrick of the Church.






Decree XII.


THe Synod commands, That the Infants that are left at the Gates of the Churches, or in any other place, if it does not manifestly appear that they are already Christned, shall be Baptized, and shall be brought up in the same manner as is prescribed for the Children of In∣fidels that are found exposed in the Heaths, the Vicars doing all they can to prevail with some to undertake the charge of their Education for God's sake.






Decree XIII.


ALL that shall be converted from Heathe∣nism to Christianity, being of Age, shall be well instructed in the matters of Faith, be∣fore they shall be admitted to Baptism, and shall know at least how to Cross themselves, and be able to say the 
Pater Noster, Ave Mary,
 the

 
Creed,
 and the 
Commandments,
 as well as they can be taught; in which Matter there has been hi∣therto a great Neglect, commanding the Vicars to examine all such in the Faith before they Chri∣sten them, without they should happen to be in danger of Death before they have learn'd those things; in which case their making a profession of Faith, and the necessary Mysteries thereof, and signifying a desire to be Baptized, shall be suffi∣cient: And whereas the Synod is inform'd, that great numbers of Infidels living among Christi∣ans, have long desired Baptism of them, but through the coldness of Priests and others, have had none that would be at the pains to instruct them, it doth therefore charge the Consciences of the Vicars therewith, speedily to set about instructing such, according to the fervour of those that desire it, that so they may be brought to the Sacred Font of Baptism, desiring all other Christians likewise to be diligent and zealous in that Matter.






Decree XIV.


THe 
Holy Oils
 having hitherto not been used in this Bishoprick in any of the Sacraments, and if any have been used, it having been with∣out any distinction, and without being Blessed by the Bishop; wherefore for remedy thereof, the most Illustrious Metropolitan, in his Refor∣mation of the Affairs of this Church, having on the 
Thursday
 of the last Holy Week blessed the

 
Oils,
 and furnished all the Churches therewith, in∣structing them in their Holy Uses and Distincti∣ons; the Synod doth therefore command all Vi∣cars in virtue of holy obedience, to use the said 
Oils
 in Baptism, Anointing all that are Baptized there∣with on the Breast, and the Sides, and after they are Baptized, anointing them with the Holy 
Chrism
 on the Head, and making the 
sign of the Cross
 thereon with their Thumb dipt in the Ho∣ly 
Oils,
 or with a Feather kept in the Vessel for that use, wiping the 
Oil
 off afterwards with a Cloth or Towel, which shall likewise be kept in the same place: The Synod doth also com∣mand under the same Precept, That all Cu∣rates and Vicars do celebrate this Sacrament, with the Rites and Ceremonies, Exorcisms and Prayers, that are contained in the 
Roman Cere∣monial;
 which the most Illustrious Metropolitan has order'd to be Translated into 
Syrian
 for the administration of all the Sacraments, and is to be kept in all Churches; and that the Priests when they administer Baptism solemnly in the Church, shall have on a 
Surplice,
 and a 
Stole
 a∣bout their Necks, for the more decent admini∣stration of that Sacrament, and shall not per∣form it in their ordinary wearing Habit, as they have done hitherto.






Decree XV.


WHereas hitherto the ancient Custom of the Church of having Godfathers and Godmo∣thers, has not been in use in this Bishoprick, by

 which means there has been no knowledge therein, of the Spiritual Affinity that is contract∣ed betwixt the Party Baptized, and the Parents thereof, and the Godfathers and Godmothers; therefore the Synod does command, That all that are Baptized, shall have one or two God∣fathers and Godmothers, to present them in the Church, and to touch them on the Head before Baptism, and to receive them from the Holy Font: The Men must be fourteen Years of Age at least, and the Women twelve; neither shall any be admitted under those Ages. The Synod doth likewise declare, That there is such a close Spiritual Affinity betwixt the Godfathers and Godmothers, and their God-children, and the Parents of the Children, that they can never Marry with one another, without a Dispensation from the Pope, or from one empowered by him, and which is seldom granted, and never but when there is a very urgent cause for it; and that such Marriages celebrated without a Dispen∣sation, are void, and of no effect. The Synod furthermore declares, That this Spiritual Affinity reacheth no further than to the one or two God∣fathers, and one Godmother, but not to those that shall stand for them, tho' they touch the Heads of the Children, neither shall the Priest admit above two.








Decree XVI.


SEeing that by our Lord Jesus Christ, and his Death, we are passed from the 
Old Law,
 to the 
New Law
 of Grace, it is therefore reason∣able, that we should in all things be ingrafted into the same: and whereas in this Bishoprick Christians do take several of the Names of the Saints of the 
Old Testament,
 as also several of the Names of the Country, insomuch that there are but very few called by any of the Names of the 
Law of Grace;
 wherefore the Synod doth command the Priests to do all they can to have the Names of the 
Law of Grace
 given in Bap∣tism, but chiefly those of the Holy Apostles, and of the Saints that are most celebrated in the Church, not intending hereby to take them from any Devotion that several among them may have for some of the Saints of the 
Old Testament,
 whose Names have been hitherto very common in the Diocess, such as 
Abraham, Jacob, Zacharias,
 and others; nevetheless from henceforward they shall not presume to take the Name of 
Hijo,
 which has been very common among them, nei∣ther shall the Priests ever give it to any, it be∣ing the most sweet
 Name of 
JESƲS,
 to

 which that Respect and
 Reverence is due, that none ought to take it upon them; for that in the naming thereof, 
all Knees both in Heaven and Earth, and under the Earth, ought to bow them∣selves, and every Tongue ought to confess, that it is from that Divine Name that we desire all the good things that we enjoy on Earth;
 command∣ing all that are called by that Name, to change it for another when they come to be Con∣firmed; and as for the common Names of the Countrey, they may still retain them, if they are such as have been used only among Chri∣stians, but not among the Heathens, for as to those Names which the Heathens have
 in com∣mon with Christians, the Synod will not have them to be given in Baptism, charging the Vicars and Priests that Baptize, to take care thereof.








Decree XVII.


THe Synod being informed, That there are some Christians so far unmindful of their Duties in this Matter, as to give other Names to their Children, than the
 Christian Names they received in Baptism, and sometimes such as are not used among Christians; it doth there∣fore strictly command, that no Christian shall presume to give their Children, or to call them by any other Names, than those that were given them when they were Christened; or when there shall happen to be any just cause for the changing of their Baptismal Names, it shall be done only at their Confirmation, and whosoever shall transgress herein, shall be severely punished by the Prelate; and the Priests must not be want∣ing frequently to admonish their People there∣of.






Decree XVIII.


THe Synod being informed, That when ma∣ny Children are brought together to be Baptized, there are great heats, which shall be first Christened; and that after having lay'd Wa∣gers, they give Money to the Curates for the

 preference, all which are intolerable disorders, and such scandalous abominations as the Church ought not by any means to give way to, and which might be easily prevented, if People could but be perswaded to bring their Children to be Christened upon the eighth day, it being their deferring of their Baptism so long, that is the cause of so many coming together; wherefore for the removing of these disorders in the Church, the Synod doth command that the Chil∣dren be baptized as they come, without any di∣stinction of first or last, and that the Priests do accustom themselves, either to baptize the poor∣est first, or all indifferently; and the Vicar or Priest that shall be found to have taken Money, or any Fee, before or after Baptism, tho' it should be voluntarily offer'd, and of never so small va∣lue, or only what is to be Eat, shall be con∣demned of Simony, and punished according to the Canons.






Decree XIX.


IN all Parochial Churches there shall with all possible expedition be Fonts provi∣ded for Baptism, which may be built with the Fabrick Money, or with the Alms Money of the Church, or by a Collection among the Parishi∣oners; it must be erected in a decent place, in a corner of the Church, and shall have a hole in the bottom, through which the Water may be conveyed away, that so it may not be thrown

 out where it may be trod upon, or treated with any irreverence, it shall also be close covered at top, and locked up, and until such time as a Font shall be provided, they shall have a Vessel of some Metal or other, which shall be put to no other use, and shall be always kept in some decent place in the Church, or Sacristy; neither shall they hereafter make use of any common Vessel, as has been the Custom hitherto; and the Water they have baptized with, shall be thrown in some place of the Church, where it will not be trod upon, and all the Water that shall be made use of in Baptism, whether it be in a Font, or a Vessel, shall be blessed with the Holy Chrism, according to the 
Roman
 Ceremo∣nial, which they are to make use of.






Decree XX.


THis Synod, conforming it self to the De∣crees of the Holy Council of 
Trent,
 and the Universal usages of the Church, doth com∣mand every Parish-Church to provide a Book, wherein the Vicar shall register the Names of all that are baptized, together with the Names of the Parents, and of the place where they live, and of the Godfathers and Godmothers, naming the place also where they were Christened, the day of the Month, and the Year, in this Form: On such a day of the month, in the Year 
N,
 I 
N.
 Vicar of the Church of 
N.
 baptized there, or in such a place, 
N.
 the Son of 
N.
 and of 
N.
 naming

 the Father and Mother Natives of such a place, and the Godfathers and Godmothers were 
N.
 and 
N.
 the Vicar signing his Name to it at the bottom; and when any Priest that is not the Vi∣car shall Christen a Child, which shall never be done without the Vicars leave, he shall Regi∣ster it thus: I 
N.
 Curate, with leave from the Vicar of such a Church, naming both the Vicar and the Church, did Baptize 
N.
 and so on as a∣bove, signing his Name at the bottom; which Book shall be always kept in the Church, and the Vicars shall be obliged to give an account thereof, and at every Visitation to shew it to the Prelate, out of which the Curates are to give Certificates of the Age of such as are to be Mar∣ried, or to receive Holy Orders, that so their Age may be certainly known; and that such Matters may not be so in the dark, as they have been formerly, when there was no certain way of coming to the knowledge of Peoples Age, which must needs create great scruples in the Minds of such as were to be Married or Or∣dained.








The Doctrine of the Sacrament of Confirmation.


THe Second Sacrament is 
Confirmation,
 which our Lord Christ instituted, in order to the confirming and establishing of Christians in the Faith, so that nothing might be able to se∣parate them from it through the Power of the

 Holy Ghost which is given therein, particularly to that effect; besides the sanctifying Grace which it gives in common with the other Divine Sa∣craments; the Matter of this Sacrament is the Holy Oyl of Chrism, made of the Oyl of the Olive-tree, signifying the light and purity of the Conscience; and of Balsam, which signifies the sweet smell of a good Name, both mixed together, and blessed by the hand of the Bishop; the Form are the words spoke by the Bishop when he dips his Thumb into the said Chrism, making therewith the Sign of the Cross on the Forehead of the Person that is confirmed, saying, 
I sign thee with the sign of the Cross, and do con∣firm thee with the Chrism of Health, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;
 to which the Bishop subjoyns three holy and wholsome Prayers, wherein he beseeches God to fill those that are confirmed with his Divine Spi∣rit. The ordinary Minister of
 Confirmation is the Bishop, for tho' simple Priests may perform se∣veral other Unctions, this can be done only by

 a Bishop, the Bishops being the Successors of the Apostles, by the imposition of whose hands the Holy Ghost was given; in the place of which imposition of hands the Church gives Confirma∣tion, Christ having so ordained it, wherein the Holy Ghost is given likewise; Nevertheless, by a dispensation from the Holy See, and by no o∣ther way, when there is any very urgent Occa∣sion, or when it happens to be necessary for the good of the Faithful, simple Priests may confirm with Chrism, that has been consecrated by a Bishop in the forementioned Form; the effect of this Sacrament is, that there∣in the Holy Ghost is given, to the strengthening

 and fortifying of the Soul, as it was given to the Apostles on the day of 
Pentecost,
 that Christi∣ans may with boldness confess the Name of Christ and his Catholick Faith, for which rea∣son the Person confirmed is anointed on the forehead with the Sign of the Cross, that being the most open place of the Body, and the Seat of Shame and Confusion, which is very diffe∣rent from what is done to People when they are baptized, who are anointed on the Head; Peo∣ple are confirmed on the forehead, that they may not be ashamed to confess the Name of Je∣sus Christ and his Cross, which as the Apostle saith, is 
to the Jews an Offence, and to the Heathens foolishness;
 this Sacrament differs much from that of Baptism, for as by Baptism we are born into the Faith, so by this we are confirmed therein; for as in the Natural Life, to be born is different from growing, so in the Spiritual Life it is one thing to be born to Grace and Faith, which is done in Baptism, and another to encrease and grow stronger therein, which is done in Confirmation, and so in Baptism we are born to a Spiritual Life, and are afterwards prepared and confirmed for our Warfare, and do receive so much strength, that no dangers or terrors of Punishments, or Losses, or Torments, or Deaths are able to sepa∣rate us from the Confession of the Name of Christ, and of the true Faith we profess.






Decree I.


FOrasmuch as hitherto there has been no use, nor so much as Knowledge of the Holy Sa∣crament of 
Confirmation
 among the Christians of this Bishoprick, the Heretical Prelates that go∣verned it, having neglected to feed the People in a great many cases with wholsome Catholick Food; therefore the Synod doth declare, That all Persons who are come to the use of reason, ought to receive this Holy Sacrament, having the opportunity of receiving it at the hands of a Bishop, and that all Masters of Families, and o∣thers having the Charge of Children, are in Du∣ty bound to command their Children and Slaves to receive the said Sacrament, and that all who out of contumacy or contempt shall refuse to re∣ceive it, or to order such as belong to them to go to it, are guilty of a Mortal Sin, and if they neglect it out of a conceit of it's not being a Sa∣crament, they are Hereticks and Aliens from the true Catholick Faith; wherefore the Synod doth command, that in the Visitation that is to be made speedily by the most Illustrious Metropoli∣tan in the Churches of this Bishoprick, all Men and Women that are above seven years old do come to be Christen'd or Confirmed, those on∣ly excepted who were confirmed by the said Lord in his former Visitation, or at some other, or on some other occasion, by some other Bishop; this Sacrament as well as that of Baptism being ne∣ver

 to be repeated, in so much, that all that re∣ceive it a second time wittingly, are guilty of a great piece of Sacrilege, besides, that they re∣ceive no Sacrament thereby: But in case any are doubtful whether they have ever been confirm∣ed or not, or should not remember that they were ever, they shall declare so much to the said Lord, or to the Bishop that is to confirm them, that they may order the matter according to the merit of their doubts: But if any, which God forbid, should sacrilegiously and obstinately de∣spise the said Sacrament, it being proved upon them, they shall be declared Excommunicate until such time as they have done condign Pe∣nance, and shall be punished at the pleasure of the Prelate.






Decree II.


THe Synod, to its great sorrow, having been informed, that some ignorant Persons in Sacred Matters and the Doctrine of the Holy Sa∣craments of the Church, being instigated by the Devil to persist in their cursed Schism, did in se∣veral places resist the most Illustrious Metropoli∣tan in his former Visitation of these Churches, so far as not only to refuse to receive the Holy Sacrament of 
Confirmation
 from him, but did al∣so oppose him publickly in the Churches, and that many did absent themselves, some whereof excused themselves by pretending, that it was an unnecessary thing, and that they had never seen nor

 heard of it before, and others that they should be affronted by the Holy Ceremony of the Pre∣lates touching their Cheek, scurrilously upbrai∣ding those that had received it, with base pro∣voking words, telling them that they had suf∣fer'd themselves to be affronted and buffeted, with other such Sacrilegious Expressions, full of Infidelity and Heresy, arising from the Schism wherein they have been brought up: Whole Towns conspiring together so far in this Mutiny, that the despising or receiving this Holy Sacra∣ment, became the Test of their obedience or disobedience to the said Metropolitan, doth therefore (notwithstanding it knows they have all in common, and every one in particular repen∣ted of this, and being sensible of the greatness of the error they committed therein, have beg'd pardon for it, and upon their having confess'd their Ignorance, have been graciously received by the said Lord Metropolitan, and having submitted themselves to the obedience of the Holy 
Roman
 Church, are ready to do all that shall be enjoy∣ned them, to prevent the life however, that none for the time coming may commit the like faults or Sacrileges) command, That if any (which God forbid) shall dare to do or say any such thing against this Sacrament or the Holy Ceremonies and Rites wherewith it is administred to the Faithful, that they be declared Excommunicate, and be separated from the Church and the Com∣munion of the Faithful, until such time as they have undergone condign Penance at the plea∣sure

 of the Prelate, and shall demonstrate their due subjection to the obedience of the Holy Church, and have taken the Oath of the Faith contained in this Synod, and declared that all that reject and despise the Rites and Ceremonies approved of, and received in the Church, in the solemn administration of this and the other Sa∣craments, are Hereticks and Apostates from our Holy Catholick Faith, as was determin'd in the Holy Council of 
Trent,
 and ought to be pro∣ceeded against and punished as such, according to the Sacred Canons.






Decree III.


THe Synod doth declare, That in the Sacra∣ment of 
Confirmation
 or 
Chrism,
 there must be a Godfather and Godmother as well as in 
Baptism,
 to present such as are to be Confirmed according to the ancient Custom of Holy Mother Church, but there shall be but only one Godfather and Godmother, who must themselves have been Confirmed; it being very indecent, that any Person should present one to have that done to him, which they have not had done to themselves; and that the Man shall be above 14, and the Wo∣man above 12 Years Old, or one of them at least shall be of that Age; and in this Case the Godfathers and Godmothers do contract the same Spiritual Affinities and the same Impediments that the others do in 
Baptism,
 the said Spiritual Affi∣nity being equally contracted in both these Sacraments.












ACTION V. Of the Holy Sacrament of the 
Eucharist,
 and of the Holy Sacrifice of the 
Mass.




The Doctrine of the Holy Sacrament of the 
Eucharist.


THe third Sacrament in the Order of the 
Spiritual Life,
 is the Holy 
Eucharist,
 tho' in Veneration, Sanctity and Dignity, it is the first and most excellent, for containing in it 
the true, real and substantial Body and Blood, together with the Soul and Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, true God, and true Man, our Sa∣viour and Redeemer; which was instituted by him the day before he suffer'd for us, as the most sweet Remate, or Conclusion of all his Works, and a Me∣morial of his Passion, the fulfilling of all the ancient Figures, the greatest of all the Miracles that ever he wrought, and for the singular Consolation of the Faithful in his absence.
 The Matter of this Sa∣crament is Bread of 
Wheat,
 and Wine of the 
Grape
 only; so that all that Consecrate in Bread made of 
Rice,
 or of any thing else but the Flower of 
Wheat,
 or of Wine that was not pressed out of the ripe 
Grape
 of the Vine do not make the Sacrament; there must also be 
Water
 mixed with the Wine before it is Consecrated, but in a much smaller quantity than the Wine, that so it may easily
 turn it self into Wine before the Con∣secration:

 which mixture is therefore made, because from the Testimony of Holy Fathers, Holy Mother Church believes that our Lord Christ himself did so, whose having mixed Water with the Wine that he Consecrated, makes it a great Sin to omit to do it. It is also agreeable to the representation of the Mystery of what passed on the Cross, and of our Lord Christ, out of whose precious Side flowed 
Water
 and 
Blood;
 as also to signifie the Effect of this Sa∣crament, which is the 
Ʋnion
 of the Faithful with Christ, the 
Water
 signifying the Faithful, and the 
Wine
 our Lord Christ, and the conversion of the 
Water
 into the 
Wine,
 the Union of our Souls with Christ by means of this Divine Sacrament, according to what our Lord said; 
He that eateth my Flesh and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.
 The 
Form
 of this Sacrament is the words of our Saviour, by which the Sacra∣ment is made; for tho' the Priest pronounceth many and divers words in the 
Mass,
 and makes many Prayers and Petitions to God, yet when he comes to Consecrate, he useth only the words of Christ, none others belonging to the sub∣stance of Consecration; so the Priest speaking in the Person of Christ, makes this Divine Sacra∣ment, because by virtue of those words, he tur∣neth the substance of 
Bread
 into the substance of the Body of Christ, and the whole substance of the 
Wine
 into his 
Blood,
 there remaining nothing of 
Bread
 and 
Wine
 after that, but only the Ac∣cidents or Species of them; and that after such

 a manner, that the whole of Christ's Body and Soul, and Divinity, are contained under every Particle of both, tho' never so small when separated; so that in every crumb of the 
Host,
 tho' never so small, there is Christ intire, and in every drop of the Species of Wine that is separated there is Christ entire, so that in each of the Species whole Christ, God and Man is re∣ceived, as also the true Sacrament; for which reason Holy Mother Church does not use to Communicate the Faithful but
 under one Spe∣cies, because in that they receive Christ entire. To this Divine Sacrament the Worship, Venera∣tion and
 Adoration of 
Latria
 is due, or the

 same that is due to God who is contained there∣in, and is really present there. The Effect that this Sacrament worketh on the Souls of those that receive it worthily, is the 
Ʋnion
 of the Man with Christ, and by it, through Grace, the Man is incorporated into Christ, and joyned to his Members: Moreover by this Sacrament, Grace is increased in all such as receive it worthily, so that whatever effects Carnal eating and drinking works upon a Man as to his Corporal Life, the same are wrought upon Man by this Divine Sa∣crament as to a Spiritual Life.




Decree I.


THere being nothing so necessary for the Faithful, as the acknowledgement of, and thankfulness for so profound a Blessing, and so excellent a Mercy as that which our Lord Christ did for us, in leaving himself under the Sacra∣mental Species, to be the true Food of our Souls, and for the consolation, support, and remedy of the Spiritual Life of Believers; we ought there∣fore wholly to occupy our selves in the Venera∣tion

 of that Divine Mystery: In order whereunto, Holy Mother Church, besides the continual Thanks and Veneration which she always gives and shews, hath ordained a particular Day in the Year for the celebration of the Memory of so great a Blessing: which not being
 observed in this Diocess, the Synod desiring that in all things this Church may conform her self to the Customs of the Holy Mother, the Universal Church of 
Rome
 doth command the Festivity of the most Holy Sacrament to be Celebrated in all the Churches of this Diocess, on the 
Thursday
 after 
Trinity Sunday,
 according to the Stile of these Parts, and the said Day to be kept by all sorts of People; and that thereon, either be∣fore or after 
Mass,
 they make a 
Procession
 through the Town, or in some convenient place with all possible Solemnity, in the same manner as they do upon 
Easter-day.








Decree II.


THe Synod doth declare, That every faith∣ful Christian so soon as he attains to the Years of perfect Discretion, that is, to say, Men at the Age of fourteen, more or less, according as their Confessors shall think fit, and Women having a Capacity to know what they do at the Age of twelve, are obliged to receive the most Holy Sacrament of the 
Eucharist,
 once a Year in 
Lent,
 or at 
Easter,
 from the hands of their own Vicar or Curate of their Church, and that whoso∣ever does not receive it, being capable, betwixt the beginning of 
Lent,
 and the second 
Sunday
 after 
Easter,
 shall be declared Excommunicate on the third 
Sunday,
 and be held as such untill they have confessed themselves, and Communi∣cated. Nevertheless the Synod gives Licence to such Vicars as know their Parishes to be of that Nature, that it is not possible for the People to comply with this Obligation in so short a time, to wait 'till 
Whitsuntide,
 and then to declare them; provided that before they declare those that live on the Heaths, they shall first take care to admonish them, either by themselves, or by others of known fidelity, that so they may do their Duty herein, letting them know if they fail, that they must be declared Excommunicate. The Curates must also be sure to observe who have complyed with this Obligation, putting their Names in a Roll as is ordered in Confessi∣on.

 But notwithstanding the Sacred Canons do oblige the Faithful only to confess and commu∣nicate once a Year at the time aforesaid, never∣theless the Vicars shall advise their Parishioners to do it oftner, namely at 
Christmass
 and 
Whit∣suntide,
 and the 
Assumption of our Lady,
 giving warning thereof still the 
Sunday
 before.






Decree III.


THe Synod doth declare and teach, That no Christian, how contrite soever for his Sins, may lawfully come to receive the Divine Sacra∣ment of the 
Altar,
 being guilty of any Mortal Sin, without having first confessed all his Sins entirely, to some approved Priest that has Au∣thority to receive his Confession, that being the Tryal and Examination that the Apostle speaks of, and saith a Man ought to make of himself, and being so approved and confessed, let him eat of the Divine Bread, and drink of the Di∣vine Cup; 
For he that eateth and drinketh unwor∣thily,
 and with a Conscience of Sin, 
eateth and drinketh Judgment
 and Condemnation 
to himself;
 for which reason this Divine Sacrament must not be given to publick Sinners, without they have left their Sins, as publick Witches, and common Women, and such as keep Concubines publick∣ly, and such as are in open malice, before they are reconciled, and all other open Sinners what∣soever. In which Matter the Vicars must be ex∣treamly careful, being sensible, that as it is a grie∣vous

 Sin in such to receive the Divine Sacrament, before they have forsaken their Sins; so it is like∣wise a grievous offence in them to give the Sa∣crament to such publick Sinners, and who are known by all to live in such Sins, and not to have forsaken them, notwithstanding they should have been confessed by others, and should bring a Note of their being absolved. This matter ought to be laid home to the Consciences of the Vicars by reason of the great dissoluteness that there is in this Bishoprick in giving the Commu∣nion to publick Sinners, and especially to those that keep Concubines, and are Married, but will not live with their Wives, and to others who live in open Malice, without any Body to hinder them, of all which the Vicars must give a strict Account to God; but at the point of death they may give the Divine Sacrament even to such as have been publick Sinners, if they are not finally impenitent.






Decree IV.


THe Synod teacheth, That this Divine Sacra∣ment ought to be received Fasting, as Ho∣ly Mother Church commands, and that upon the day on which people are to communicate, they are neither to eat nor drink any thing from Midnight untill after they have received the

 Communion, not to do so being
 a most grie∣vous Sacrilege, such only excepted as are under any great infirmity, or much spent with Sick∣ness, who may take Electuaries, and other light things to strengthen them, of which the Con∣fessor must be judge.






Decree V.


CHristians are not only bound to receive the most Holy Sacrament of the 
Altar
 once a Year, at 
Easter,
 but as often as they are in pro∣bable danger of Death, and especially in any great Sickness, for which reason this Divine Sacrament is called the 
Viaticum,
 that is to say, the Support in the way from a Mortal to an Eternal Life, wherefore the Synod doth com∣mand all Sick People, whose Distempers are any thing dangerous, to receive it with much De∣votion; and as they that look after the Sick ought to give the Vicars timely Notice, so the Vicars themselves must be diligent to enquire what Persons are sick in their Parishes, that so before they come to be too weak, at a time when it will do them no prejudice, they may be brought in a Palanquin, or in something else that

 covers them, to the Church, there to receive the Holy Sacrament; for which use there shall be a 
Palanquin,
 or Net, made commodious with Car∣pets, in every Church, in which the Sick shall be carried with due care, which shall be bought within a month after the publication hereof out of the Fabrick money of the Church, all which the Synod doth recommend earnestly to the Vi∣cars, this being truly the chief Duty of their Of∣fice; and if it shall any time happen that a Pari∣shioner shall die without having received the Communion, thro' the Vicars default, the said Vicar shall be suspended for six months, from his Office and Benefice, and if it happen thorow the Vicars not having been advised thereof, then those that attended the Sick Person, shall be se∣verely punished by the Prelate.






Decree VI.


WHereas Women are many times in danger of Death in Child-bed, a great many dying therein, the Synod doth therefore de∣clare, That all Women with Child ought about the time when they reckon they are to be deli∣vered, to confess themselves, and receive the Ho∣ly Sacrament, but especially before the Birth of their first Child, in which the danger is greatest, recommending it to them to be careful to do it in time, that they may not be prevented by their Labour from going to Church. Such also as de∣sign to undertake any long and dangerous Voy∣age,

 ought to do the same, to whom the Synod recommends it much, and requires it of them.






Decree VII.


FOrasmuch as there are several Priests and 
Ca∣zanares
 of this Diocess that do never cele∣brate, some by reason of their having been or∣dained when they were but Boys, and so do wait till they come to be of a due Age, and o∣thers through other Impediments, therefore the Synod doth command all such to receive the Ho∣ly Sacrament upon all the solemn Festivities, and at least once a month, wishing they would do it every 
Sunday
 with a due preparation and re∣verence; and as often as any Priest doth com∣municate, he shall be in a 
Surplice
 and 
Stole,
 with a 
Cross
 on his Breast to distinguish him from other People, by reason of the Reverence and Respect that is due to the Sacerdotal Office which he bears.






Decree VIII.


SEeing as is aforesaid, it is not lawful for any Person to come to the most Holy Sacrament of the Altar, having the least scruple of any Mor∣tal Sin about him, without having been Sacra∣mentally confess'd, the Synod doth declare, That even to Priests it is not lawful, and that none finding in themselves the least scruple of Mortal Sin, and having an opportunity of a Confessor,

 shall say 
Mass,
 tho' under an Obligation to do it, without having first confessed themselves: But besides, that such when under any scruple are obliged to confess, for the greater purity of their Souls, tho' under no scruple the Synod com∣mands all Priests to confess at least once a Week.






Decree IX.


THe Synod doth furthermore command all Deacons and Sub-Deacons, that Minister solemnly in the solemn 
Masses
 on 
Sundays
 and Saints-days, to receive the most Holy Sacrament at those times, and on the Festivity of our 
Lord Christ,
 our 
Lady,
 and the 
Holy Apostles,
 all the 
Chamazes,
 or Clergy that are in the Church; of which the Vicars ought to take special care, and the Prelate in his Visitations is to make diligent In∣quiry, how these things are observed.








The Doctrine of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.


THe great Love of God to Mankind, does not only appear in the Institution of the Holy Sacrament of the 
Eucharist,
 and in the putting of his Divine Body and Blood under the Sacramental 
Species,
 to be the heavenly Food of our Souls, by which the Spiritual Life is main∣tained and preserved, but in his having likewise so instituted it, that the 
Catholick Church Mili∣tant


 might have a perpetual and visible Sacrifice for the purging away of our sins, and for turn∣ing the Wrath of our Heavenly Father, who is many times offended with our wickedness into Mercy, and the rigour of his just punishment in∣to Clemency: So in the 
Mass
 there is offered unto God a true and proper Sacrifice, for the pardon both of the Living and of the Dead, by the offering of the which Sacrifice the Lord is so far appealed as to give Grace, and the Gift of Repentance to Sinners, and by means thereof does forgive Men their Sins and Offences, tho' never so enormous; the 
Host
 that is offered by the Ministry of the Priest on the Altar of the Church, being one and the same that was offered for us on the Cross, with no other difference be∣sides that of the reason of their being offered: And so it is not only offered for the Sins, Punish∣ments, Satisfactions, and other Necessities of the Faithful that are Living, but also for the Dead, departed in Christ, and that are in the Torments of 
Purgatory,
 being not as yet fully purged by rea∣son of their not having made a compleat satisfaction for the punishments due to their sins, it being but just and reasonable, that all should be benefited by a Sacrifice, which was instituted for the Remedy and Health of all Mankind; which Oblation is of that purity, that no indignity or wickedness in the 
Offerers
 is able to defile it: so that as to the substance, value, and acceptation, it is the same when offered by a wicked and unclean sinner, as when by a pure and holy Priest, because it

 does not derive its Dignity from the 
Offerer,
 but from the Majesty and excellency of what is offer∣ed, neither does the Eternal Father accept there∣of for the Merits and Vertue of the Priest that offers it, but for the value of the Sacrifice it self, and the infinite Merits of 
Christ,
 who is offered therein; so that our Saviour being about to offer himself to God the Father on the Altar of the Cross, could not possibly have given us a greater expression of his immense Love for us, than by leaving us this visible Sacrifice in his Church, in which the Blood which was present∣ly to be once offered upon the Altar of the Cross, was to be renewed every day upon the Altar of the Church, and the Memory thereof to our great profit, was to be adored every where in the Church until the end of the World; which Divine Sacrifice is offered to God only, not∣withstanding it is sometimes celebrated in Me∣mory and Honour of the 
Martyrs,
 and other 
Saints
 in Bliss; it not being offered to them but to God only, who has been pleased to Crown them with Immortal Honour, rendring him there∣by our bounden thanks for the notable Victory of the 
Martyrs,
 and the publick Mercies and Blessings he has vouchsafed to other 
Saints,
 and for the Victories which by these means they ob∣tained over the World, the Flesh, and the De∣vil; beseeching the said Saints to be pleased to intercede for us in Heaven, whose Memories we celebrate on Earth: and tho' the Divine 
Eucha∣rist
 does still continue to be a Sacrament, yet it is never a Sacrifice, but as it is offered in the 
Mass.






Decree I.


FOrasmuch as it is of great moment, that all things belonging to the Sacrifice of the 
Mass,
 should be preserv'd pure and undefiled, and where∣as this Church has been for
 1200 years from under the Obedience of the Holy 
Roman
 Church, the Mi∣stress of all the other Churches, and from whence all good Government and true Doctrines do come, all the Bishops that came hither from 
Babylon
 ha∣ving been Schismaticks and 
Nestorian
 Hereticks, who have added to, and taken from the 
Mass
 at their pleasure without any order; from whence it has come to pass, that several things are foisted into the 
Syrian Mass
 which is said in this Diocess, without any consideration, and such things too as may give occasion to many Impious and He∣retical Errors: For which, if due Order were observed, all the 
Missals
 of this Bishoprick ought to be burned, as also for their having been of 
Ne∣storian
 use, and compiled by 
Nestorian
 Hereticks; but being there are no other at present, they are tolerated, until such time as our 
Lord
 the Pope shall take some Order therein, and there

 shall be 
Missals
 sent by him printed in the 
Chal∣dee
 Tongue, which is what this Synod humbly and earnestly desires may be done: And in the mean time it doth command, that the 
Missals
 now in use be purged and reformed as to all the following Matters, and that till such time as they are so purged, which the most 
Illustrious Metro∣politan,
 with the assistance of some Persons well versed in the 
Chaldee
 Tongue will see done the next Visitation, no Priest shall presume to make use of them any more.


Whereas from the above declared Doctrine of this Sacrament it is evident, that the Priest does not Consecrate with his own words, but with those of our 
Lord Christ,
 the Author and Insti∣tutor of the said Divine Sacrament; it is not therefore lawful to add any Clause, how good soever in it self to the Form of Consecration, or to what our 
Lord Christ
 said therein; in which we do not comprehend the word 
Enim,
 which the 
Church of Rome
 adds to the Consecration of the Body and Blood; for besides that, there is the
 
Tradition
 of the Holy 
Apostles,
 for our 
Lord Christ's
 having used it in the Consecration

 of the 
Body;
 and that St. 
Matthew
 also relates it in the Consecration of the 
Cup,
 it is no Clause or distinct Sentence, but a conjunction to a Sen∣tence of the words of Christ which immediately follow. As also the word 
Aeterni
 in the Consecra∣tion of the 
Cup;
 and the words 
Mysterium Fidei,
 which tho' not mentioned by the Evangelists, yet as it is proved by 
Apostolical Tradition,
 were used by our 
Lord Christ
 in the Consecration of the 
Cup,
 and for that reason the 
Holy Church
 continues to use them in the same; but as for the words added to the Consecration of the 
Cup
 in the 
Syrian
 Missal, 
Et hoc erit vobis pignus in saecula saeculorum,
 they being no where in any of the four Evangelists, nor in any Book of the New Testament; and it not appearing to the Church by 
Apostolical Tradition,
 that Christ used them in that Consecration, the Synod doth prohibit them to be used therein any more; but the words in themselves being good and Holy, and agreeable

 to what 
Holy Church
 singeth of this Divine Sa∣crament, that it is the 
pledge of the Glory that we expect,
 that we may keep to the Old 
Missal
 so far as the sincerity of the Faith, and the pu∣rity of this Divine Sacrifice will permit, the Priest shall say them after the elevation of the 
Cup,
 where making a profound Reverence, he shall begin the following Prayers with them, only changing the word 
Vobis,
 which was used as spoke by Christ, for 
Nobis,
 as spoke by himself, saying, 
Hoc erit nobis pignus;
 and for the words 
in saecula saeculorum
 which follow, they being commonly said in the Church of such Matters only as are to last for ever, or are wished to be Eternal, seeing the use of this Divine Sa∣crament as well as of the rest, is to continue but to the end of the World, (they having been in∣stituted only as a remedy for our Spiritual neces∣sities in this life, for in the other we are to see our Lord no more under Sacramental 
Species,
 but clearly as he is, neither shall we in Heaven eat this Divine Bread of Angels Sacramentally, but shall eat as the Angels do in the Vision of the Divine Word.) The words 
in saecula saeculorum
 shall be therefore left out, and instead thereof shall be put 
usque ad consummationem saeculi,
 say∣ing, 
hoc erit nobis pignus usque ad consummationem, saeculi,
 the Sacrament being a pledge only for so long as we do not see the Glory that we hope for, but is and ever will be such a pledge in this life, Christ having promised to his Church, 
that he will be with her to the end of the World;


 so that the Divine Sacraments, which were in∣stituted for our benefit, can never fail till then; after these words the Priest shall go on with what immediately follows in the 
Mass, Gloria tibi, Domine, gloria tibi,
 and so on.


Furthermore in the Consecration of the 
Cup
 there is added to the words of Christ, 
novi testa∣menti qui pro vobis,
 &c. 
novi & aeterni testamenti mysterium fidei, qui pro vobis & pro multis,
 &c. Therefore the Synod doth command, That the words of Consecration of the 
Body
 and 
Blood
 be reformed, and put in all their 
Missals,
 according to the Canon of the 
Roman
 Missal used in the Universal Church without the least addition or diminution, and with the same Adorations, In∣clinations, and Ceremonies as are in the 
Roman
 Missal.


Furthermore, where the Priest saith 
Dominus Deus noster quando spirabit in nobis odor suavissi∣mus,
 it is said in the same Prayer, 
& cum animae nostrae veritatis tuae scientiâ fuerint illustratae, tunc occurremus dilecto filio tuo,
 &c. speaking of the day of Judgment, it shall be said, 
Cum corporae nostra veritatis tuae splendore fuerint illustrata, tunc occurremus dilecto filio tuo,
 the Souls of the Just being illuminated and glorified in Heaven before the day of Judgment, which is the time when the Bodies receive their Glory; this Passage seeming to allude to the 
Nestorian
 Heresie, which teacheth that the Souls of the Just do not see God, nor are Glorified, nor are in Bliss, before the day of Judgment.




Furthermore, where the Deacon saith, 
Orando pro sanctis patribus nostris Patriarchâ nostro pastore universalis totius Ecclesiae Catholicae,
 meaning the Schismatick of 
Babylon, & Episcopo hujus Metro∣polis;
 it shall be said 
Pro sanctis Patribus nostris, beatissimo Papâ nostro totius Ecclesiae Catholicae pastore,
 naming him by his Name, 
& Episcopo hujus Me∣tropolis,
 naming him also, 
& Ministris ipsorum;
 and a little lower where the Deacon praying, saith, 
praecipuè nos oportet orare pro incolumitate Patrum nostrorum sanctorum, domini Patriarchae totius Ec∣clesiae Catholicae pastoris,
 naming the 
Patriarch
 of 
Babylon
 by Name, instead thereof he shall say, 
Praecipuè oportet nos orare pro incolumitate patrum nostrorum Domini Papae,
 naming him also, 
& Episcopi hujus Metropolis,
 naming him also.


Furthermore, when the Deacon a little before saith, 
Commemoramus autem beatissimam Mariam, virginem Matrem Christi & salvatoris,
 it shall be said 
Sanctam Matrem Dei vivi, & salvatoris, & Re∣demptoris nostri,
 &c. because the perverse 
Nestorians
 do impiously deny the Blessed 
Virgin
 to be the 
Mo∣ther of God,
 as has been observed.


Furthermore, when the Deacon a little low∣er saith, 
Commemoramus quoque Patres nostros sanctos & veritatis Doctores Dominum & Sanctum Nestorium,
 &c. all which is Heretical, it being an impious thing sacrilegiously to pray to God to preserve the Doctrine of 
Nestorius,
 and of o∣ther Hereticks his followers in the Church, all the forementioned having been such except St. 
Ephraim;
 wherefore instead of them he shall say,

 
Commemoramus quoque Patres nostros sanctos veri∣tatis Doctores S. Cyrillum,
 &c. And tho' in some 
Missals
 the Names of 
Nestorius, Theodorus,
 and 
Diodorus
 are already left out, yet they do still remain in some, and the Names of 
Abraham
 and 
Narcissus,
 two of the Ringleaders of that cursed Sect are in all of them. Wherefore there must be care taken to have them also left out.


Furthermore, in the beginning of the Prayer wherein the Deacon saith, 
Oportet nos orare & exaltare unum Deum Patrem Dominum omnium adoratione dignissimum, qui per Christum fecit no∣bis bonam spem,
 it shall be said, 
Qui per Jesum Christum filium suum Dominum nostrum fecit nobis bonam spem.


Furthermore, where the Priest pouring the Wine into the Cup saith, 
Misceatur pretiosus Sanguis in Calice Domini nostri Jesu Christi,
 it shall be said, 
Misceatur Vinum in Calice Domini nostri,
 that no occasion may be given to the Error of calling the Wine before it is consecrated, 
The Precious Blood of Christ,
 alluding to the condem∣ned Custom of the 
Greeks,
 who as they offer the Bread and Wine before they are consecrated, so they adore them too, saying they do it for what they are to be; and presently after where the Priest saith, 
Expectans expectavi Dominum, Corpus Christi & sanguinem ejus pretiosum super sanctum altare offeramus,
 it shall be said for the same rea∣son, 
Panem Sanctum & Calicem pretiosum offeramus;
 and immediately after where the Deacon saith, 
Edent pauperes & saturabuntur, Corpus Christi &

 Sanguinem ejus pretiosum super sanctum altare offe∣ramus:
 He shall say for the same reason, 
Ede
 pauperes & saturabuntur, Panem sanctum, & Calicem pretiosum,
 &c.


Furthermore, where the Priest with a low Voice in the Prayer, which begins, 
Offeratur & gloriae immoletur,
 saith, 
& Christus qui oblatus est pro salute nostrâ,
 he shall say, 
Jesus Christus Dominus noster Dei filius qui oblatus est,
 &c. And where the Priest raising his Voice saith, 
Gloria Patri,
 &c. 
Fiat Commemoratio Virginis Mariae Matris Christi,
 he shall say, 
Fiat commemoratio Virginis Marie Matris ipsius Dei & Domini nostri Jesu Christi;
 And a little lower, where the Deacon saith, 
In saecula usque in saecula, Amen, Amen, Apostoli ipsius filii & amici unigenti;
 he shall say, 
Apostoli ipsius filii Dei & amici.
 And where the Priest begins, 
Pusilli cum majoribus,
 and saith, 
Resur∣rectione tuâ supergloriosâ resuscitabis eos ad gloriam tuam,
 he shall say, 
Per Resurrectionem tuam super∣gloriosam suscitabis eos.


Furthermore, where the Deacon saith, 
Ef∣fundite coram illo corda vestra, jejunio, oratione, & poenitentia, placaverunt Christum, Patrem quoque & Spiritum ejus sanctum,
 where in saying, 
Spiri∣tum sanctum ejus,
 they seem to allude to the Error of the 
Greeks,
 that the Holy Spirit proceedeth only from the Father, and not from the Father and the Son, as from one principal, as the Catholick Faith confesseth, and because the 
Nestorians
 by rea∣son of the great Communication they have had with the 
Greeks,
 have imbibed some of their Er∣rors,

 that there may be therefore no countenance given to such an Error, it shall be reformed thus, 
Placaverunt Patrem Filium, & Spiritum Sanctum.


Furthermore, In the Prayer where the Priest saith, 
Dominus Deus fortis, tua est Ecclesia san∣cta Catholica, quae admirabili Christi tui passione empta est;
 it shall be said, 
Quae admirabili Christi filii tui,
 &c.


Furthermore, near the end of the Gospel ta∣ken out of that Chapter of St. 
John,
 which, as has been observed, is corrupted in the 
Syrian
 Translation, where it is read 
quoniam venit hora in quâ omnes qui in monumentis sunt audient vocem ipsius,
 it shall be read 
audient vocem filii Dei,
 as it is in the Gospel.


Furthermore, in the 
Creed
 that is sung in the 
Mass
 there are wanting several substantial words, where speaking of our 
Lord Christ,
 and saying that 
he was born of the Father before all Worlds,
 there is wanting 
God of God, light of light, very God of very God,
 all which shall be added to it: as also the word 
consubstantial to the Father,
 lea∣ving out the words that are in its place, in the 
Syrian, filius essentiae Patris,
 and the whole shall be reformed and translated into the same words, as it is sung in the Catholick Church in the 
Ro∣man
 Missal.


Furthermore, presently after the Creed, where the Deacon praying for, and making a Comme∣moration of the Holy 
Apostles, Martyrs
 and 
Con∣fessors,
 desires of God that he would raise them up that they may be Crowned with Glory at the Re∣surrection

 of the Dead, saying, 
Oremus, in quam, ut resurrectione quae est ex mortuis à Deo coronâ do∣nentur,
 which besides that it is not the Custom of the Church to pray for the Holy 
Apostles, Mar∣tyrs,
 and 
Confessors,
 nor to desire any good thing for them, whom we believe to be in possession of Bliss, but much rather to
 Pray to them, to intercede for us, and to obtain for us of God, whose familiar Friends they are, all that we stand in need of, and is of importance, both as to all our Spiritual and just Temporal Concerns; it seems to allude to the 
Nestorian
 Opinion, That the Souls of the 
Saints
 are not to see God, until after their Bodies are raised at the day of Judgment, and that till then they are in a 
Terre∣strial Paradise,
 which is Impious and Heretical; wherefore the Synod doth command, That since there are no such Prayers used in the Church, nor any such Petitions made to God in behalf of the Saints, notwithstanding they are said in the 
Reve∣lation
 to make them for themselves, that those words be blotted out, and what follows be joined with what went before, saying, 
& Con∣fessores hujus loci & omnium Regionum, oremus, inquam, ut det nobis ut efficiamur socii eorum,
 &c. leaving out the fore-mentioned words; and at the end of the Prayer where it is said, 
per gratiam

 Christi,
 it shall be said 
Per gratiam Dei, & Domini nostri Jesu Christi.


Furthermore where the Priest begins 
Confite∣mur & laudamus, Domine Deus noster,
 where he saith below 
Dignos nos fecisti dispensatione sacra∣mentorum sanctorum corporis & sanguinis Christi tui,
 it shall be said 
Christi filii tui;
 as also before where the Priest speaketh to those on the right side of the Altar, and they answer with the Dea∣con 
Christus exaudiat orationes tuas, hoc sacrificium quod tu offers pro te, pro nobis, & pro toto orbe à minimo usque ad maximum,
 the last words 
& pro toto orbe à minimo usque ad maximum,
 must be left out, for the 
Mass
 being a publick Prayer of the Church, 
Infidels, Schismaticks
 and 
Hereticks
 are not to be prayed for therein, but only 
Catholicks,
 and such as are united to the Church; wherefore instead thereof it shall be said, 
quod tu offers pro te, pro nobis, & pro universâ Ecclesiâ Catholicâ, & omnibus orthodoxis, atque Apostolicae & Catholicae fidei cultoribus.


Furthermore, where the Priest begins 
Etiam Domine Deus Exercituum,
 where he saith, 
& pro Sacerdotibus, Regibus, & Principibus,
 it shall be said, 
& pro Regibus & Principibus Catholicis,
 the Christians of this Church being subject to 
Infidel
 Princes; and a little lower, where the Priest be∣gins 
Tu Domine cui propter,
 &c. where he saith, 
recordatione corporis & sanguinis,
 it shall be said, 
Christi filii tui;
 and a little lower in the same Prayer, near the end, it shall be said, 
sanguine Christi filii tui redempta.




Furthermore, where the Deacon and Clergy praying, do say, 
Et pro omnibus Patriarchis, Epi∣scopis, & Presbyteris,
 &c. it shall be said, 
& pro beatissimo Papâ nostro,
 naming him, 
& pro omni∣bus Patriarchis & Episcopis.


Furthermore, in the Hymn said by the Clergy and the Deacon 
alternatim
 after the elevation of the most Holy Sacrament, in the Verse where the Priest saith, 
Quando ad sanctum altare ingreditur, manus suas purè protendit in coelum, & invitat spiritum qui de superis descendit & consecrat cor∣pus & sanguinem Christi,
 in which words the Priest seems to call upon the Holy Ghost, to come down from Heaven to consecrate the Body of Christ, as if it were not the Priest that conse∣crated it; whereas in truth it is the Priest that does it, tho' not in his own words, but the words of Christ; wherefore that no colour may be given to such an error, it shall be said, 
manus suas purè protendit in coelum & consecrat corpus & sanguinem Christi,
 leaving out the words of 
& invitat spiritum qui de superis descendit,
 &c. and the following words 
à saeculo usque in saeculum.


Furthermore, in the Prayer said by the Dea∣con, which begins 
Omnes timore pariter & amore accedamus,
 where it is said, 
unigenitus Dei mortale corpus & spiritualem, rationalem, immortalemque ani∣mam ex filiis hominum suscepit,
 that there may be no countenance given to an error held by some, and followed by several 
Nestorians,
 that the Soul as well as the Body, is 
ex traduce,
 or derived from the Parents; whereas in truth it is created

 by God out of nothing, and infused into the Body when it is perfectly formed; it shall there∣fore be said 
unigenitus Dei mortale corpus ex filiis hominum, & spiritualem, rationalem, immortalem∣que animam suscepit.
 As also where the Deacon after the Communion of the Priest, inviting the People to communicate, saith, 
fratres mei susci∣pite corpus ipsius filii,
 he shall say 
ipsius filii Dei.


Furthermore, in the first word of the Bene∣diction of the People, where he saith, 
Ille qui benedicit nos in coelis, per filium Humanitatis,
 he shall say 
Per filium suum;
 and in the first Blessing which the Priest gives to the People, at the end of the 
Mass,
 where he saith, 
Ca∣thedra gloriosa Catholicorum orientalium,
 meaning Schismatical 
Babylon,
 he shall say 
benedicatur Ca∣thedra gloriosa Romana,
 and in the following verse of the same Blessing, where speaking of the Bi∣shop of the Diocess, he saith, 
Dominus totius gre∣gis episcopus plenus sobrietate custodiatur à malo,
 &c. he shall name our Lord the Pope, saying, 
Domi∣nius totius gregis catholici Papa N. plenus sobrie∣tate custodiatur à malo, una cum bono Doctore, & Episcopo nostro N.
 naming him by his Name: And a little after in the same Blessing, where he saith, 
Illustris in congregatione Sanctorum religiosus Hor∣misda, sanctitas sanctitatum,
 &c. the name of 
Hor∣misda,
 who as has been observed, was a 
Nesto∣rian
 Heretick, shall be left out, and instead there∣of he shall say, 
Illustris in congregatione Sancto∣rum S. Apostolus Thomas,
 &c. all that follows

 agreeing very well with that glorious Apostle, who first taught the Faith in these parts, and not to that false Heretick.


Furthermore, in the first Verse of the Blessing of the Solemn Days, where it is said of the Di∣vine Word, 
Qui factus est homo, & operuit spe∣ciem suam in filio hominis,
 for fear of the 
Ne∣storian
 Doctrine it shall be said, 
Qui factus est homo, & operuit Divinitatem suam humilitate no∣strâ;
 and a little lower where it is said, 
Benedic Ecclesiam tuam quae patitur, & in ovili pessimi Dae∣monis ecce comprehenditur,
 it shall be said, 
Quae patitur infestationes a pessimo Daemone, libera il∣lam,
 &c. for the Catholick Church tho' it be infested and persecuted by the Devil, is not held nor overcome by him, our Saviour having pro∣mised, that 
all the Powers of Hell shall never pre∣vail against her.
 And afterwards where it is said, 
Benedic dextrâtuâ, Christe, congregationem hanc,
 it shall be said, 
Benedic dextrâ tuâ, Jesu Christe,
 &c. and in the same Blessing, where it is said, 
Salva Re∣ges nostros & Duces nostros,
 it shall be said, 
Salva Reges nostros & Duces nostros Catholicos,
 all the Kings and Princes of this Church being 
Infidels,
 and so ought not to be prayed for in the pub∣lick Prayers of the 
Mass;
 and a little after, where it is said, 
Sicut decet coram ipso Jesu Salva∣tore,
 it shall be said, 
Coram ipso Jesu Deo Salva∣tore,
 because of the 
Nestorian
 error; and in the last Verse but one of that Blessing, where it is said, 
Qui comedit corpus meum & bibit ex sanguine meo sanctificante liberabitur ab inferno per me,
 the

 words of Christ, 
Habet vitam aeternam,
 shall be used instead of 
Liberabitur ab inferno;
 and in the end of the third Blessing, where it is said, 
Glo∣ria illi ex omni ore Jesu Domino,
 it shall be said, 
Jesu Domino Deo,
 because the 
Nestorians
 do im∣piously affirm, That 
the name of Jesus is the name of a humane Person, and does not agree to God.


All the above-mentioned particular the Synod doth command to be Corrected, as is here ordered, with such caution as is necessary in these Matters, wherein the cursed 
Nestorian
 Hereticks have sown so many Errors.






Decree II.


WHereas in the 
Missals
 of this Diocess there are some 
Masses
 that were made by 
Nesto∣rius,
 others by 
Theodorus,
 and others by 
Diodorus,
 their Master, which are appointed to be said on some certain days, and which, carrying those Names in their Titles, are full of Errors and Heresies; the Synod doth command all such 
Mas∣ses,
 entire as they are, to be taken out, and burnt, and in virtue of Obedience, and upon pain of Ex∣communication 
Latae Sententiae,
 doth prohibit all Priests from henceforward to presume to use them, ordering them to be forthwith cut out of their Books, and at the next Visitation to be delivered by them to the most 
Illustrious Metro∣politan,
 or to such as he shall appoint to correct their Books, that so these 
Masses
 may be burnt.








Decree III.


WHereas in the 
Masses
 of this Bishoprick, there is an impious sacrilegious Ceremony, which is the Priests, after having dipt that part of the 
Host,
 after his having divided it, which he holds in his right hand, and has made the sign of the Cross upon the other part that is upon the 
Patin,
 opening this latter part that was upon the 
Patin
 with the Nail of his right Thumb, to the end, according to their Opinion, that the Blood may penetrate the Body, that so the Blood and Body may be joyned together, which is ignorantly done in allusion to the Heresie of 
Nestorius,
 or of his Followers, who do impiously affirm, That 
under the Element of Bread is only the Body of Christ without Blood, and under the Element of Wine the Blood without the Body:
 Wherefore the Synod doth command in virtue of Holy Obedience, and upon pain of Excommunication to be 
Ipso facto
 incurred, that no Priest presume to use any such Ceremony, and that they throw it out of their Masses, for that besides it alludes to the foremen∣tioned Heresie, it contains a great ignorance in supposing that the 
Species
 can penetrate the Bo∣dy and Blood of Christ.








Decree IV.


FOrasmuch as the 
Syrian Mass
 is too long for Priests that have a mind to celebrate daily, the Synod doth grant License for the tran∣slating of the 
Roman Mass
 into 
Syrian,
 desiring the Reverend Father 
Francisco Roz,
 of the So∣ciety of 
Jesus
 to undertake the Work, which 
Mass
 together with all the 
Roman
 Ceremonies the Priest may say on particular Occasions, but the solemn and sung 
Masses
 of the day shall be al∣ways the 
Syrian,
 as they shall be emended by the most 
Reverend Metropolitan:
 and such Priests as are able to say 
Masses
 both in 
Latin
 and 
Syrian
 in the Churches of other Diocesses, may say it in 
Latin,
 but not in this Bishoprick, in which to avoid confusion, it shall be said only in 
Syrian.
 Wherefore the Synod desires the Bishops of those parts to give License, that the Priests of this Dio∣cess, having 
Letters dimissory
 from their Prelate, that do not know how to say 
Mass
 in 
Latin,
 may be permitted to say the 
Syrian Mass
 in their Churches, or at least the 
Roman
 translated with all its Ceremonies into 
Syrian;
 the Schism which this Church has been in, being now thorow the goodness of God removed, entreating the most 
Illustrious Metropolitan,
 the President of this Sy∣nod, that he would be pleased to present this Petition in behalf of the Priests of this Dioces
 to the first Provincial Council that shall be cele∣brated

 in the Province, that so if the 
Fathers
 shall think fit, it may pass into a Decree.






Decree V.


WHereas the Power of handling the Holy Vessels is given particularly to the order of the 
Subdeacon,
 this Synod doth command that from henceforward if the Minister that assists at the 
Mass
 be not a 
Subdeacon,
 that the Priest shall not put the 
Patin
 into his hand, when he is or∣dered by the 
Syrian Mass
 to do it, such a one having no Authority to touch it; but he may lay his hand only on the stone or wood of the Altar, so as not to touch the 
Patin,
 which is according to the 
Rubrick
 of the 
Missal,
 which supposes the Person that assists at the 
Mass
 to be a 
Deacon,
 ordering expresly that the 
Priest shall put the Patin into the hand of the Deacon.






Decree VI.


WHereas the 
Stole
 that is thrown over the Shoulders is the particular Badge of the Or∣der of 
Deacon,
 it is not lawful therefore for any Person that has not taken the said Order, to use the Stole in the Church with any publick Cere∣mony; and whereas hitherto all of the Clergy that have assisted at 
Mass,
 tho' but in 
inferior Or∣ders,
 or without them, have wore the said 
Stole
 over their shoulders, no less than the 
Deacons,
 contrary to the 
Ceremoniale,
 which supposeth him

 that assists at the 
Mass
 to be a 
Deacon;
 the Sy∣nod doth therefore ordain and command, that from henceforward the 
Chamazes,
 who do assist at the 
Mass,
 and are not 
Deacons,
 be not per∣mitted to wear the 
Stole;
 it would also be de∣cent for the 
Deacons
 when they wear the 
Stole,
 to be in a 
Surplice,
 and to have a 
Towel,
 and not to have it over their ordinary wearing Cloths, as has been hitherto the Custom.






Decree VII.


THe Synod doth command, That in all Churches there be 
Stamps
 of 
Hosts
 (or In∣struments wherewith to print the Wafers that are to be Consecrated) which shall be bought forthwith out of the Fabrick-money, or the Alms of the Church; and that the Vicars take care to be always provided of the flour of Wheat, for the making of them, which they must be sure not to mix with any thing else, as is done com∣monly in other Bread, for fear there should be no Consecration therein; wherefore they must either make them themselves, or employ such as are of known Skill and Fidelity to do it, and the same care shall be taken of the Wine that it be no other than that of 
Portugal,
 and that it be not mixed with the Juice of 
Raisins,
 or with any other Wines of the Countrey for the same dan∣ger.








Decree VIII.


THe Synod doth earnestly recommend it to the Priests of this Diocess to take heed in what Wine they celebrate, having been inform∣ed, That as some Churches, by reason of their Poverty, are without 
Portugal
 Wine, so where it is that the Priest keeps it in Glass Bottles, where being in a small quantity, and kept a long time, it must necessarily decay and turn to Vi∣negar, with which they celebrate notwithstand∣ing, not considering the danger there is of there being no Consecration; for remedy whereof the Synod in the strictest manner that it can, doth command, That in every Church there shall be in the Vicars keeping a sweet pipe, or small Run∣let of Wood, or a Frask, in which the Wine for the 
Masses
 shall be kept, and that the Vicars be extreamly careful, that the Wine do not decay or turn to Vinegar; which if it should happen so as to have lost the essence of Wine in the Opi∣nion of those that have good Palates, they shall not then celebrate therewith, it being a great Sacrilege to do it, seeing there can be no Conse∣cration.






Decree IX.


WHereas for want of 
Portugal
 Wine, it ma∣ny times falls out that there are no 
Mas∣ses
 celebrated in this Diocess, to the great pre∣judice

 of the Faithful Christians, who for that reason are several months without hearing 
Mass,
 and without an opportunity of receiving the most Holy Sacrament, and the Sick of receiving the Holy 
Viaticum;
 wherefore the Synod, for remedy hereof, doth entreat his 
Majesty
 the King of 
Portugal,
 out of his great Piety, and as he is 
Protector
 of the Christians of these parts, once a Year to send us as an Alms, a Pipe and a half, or two Pipes of 
Muscatel
 Wine of 
Portugal,
 to be distributed among the Christian Churches of this Bishoprick, and of the whole 
Indies;
 and till such time as an Answer shall be returned to this Petition, the most 
Illustrious Lord Archbishop
 of 
Goa, Dom ffray Aleixo de Menezes,
 Metropoli∣tan of this Church, Primate of 
India,
 and Pre∣sident of this Synod, is pleased to give the said quantity of Wine to be distributed among the Churches of this Bishoprick, the distribution whereof shall be made by the Prelate according to the Informations he shall receive of the Ne∣cessities of every Parish, and whereas all the suc∣cesses of this Life are uncertain, if this should happen to fail at any time, the Prelate shall then at his Visitation take so much out of the stock of every Church as shall suffice to purchase what Wine is necessary, and the Wine shall be commit∣ted to the Vicar, who shall make use of it only in the 
Masses
 that are said in the Church, and order shall be taken that the 
Mass
 of the day, which belongs to the whole Parish, and is the chief obligation of the Church, shall be celebra∣ted without fail.








Decree X.


THis Synod being very doubtful whether the Stones of the Altar, on which the 
Masses
 are said in the Churches of this Diocess, be con∣secrated with Holy Oil, or truly Blessed, by rea∣son of the small care and knowledge which the former Prelates coming from 
Babylon
 had of such Matters; doth command, That all such as are not well known to have been lawfully Consecra∣ted, shall be brought to the most 
Reverend Me∣tropolitan
 that they may be Consecrated by him, whom the Synod doth intreat to provide such Churches with Stones as want them: Comman∣ding likewise, all Cups that are not of Gold, Sil∣ver, Copper or Tin, to be broke, and
 no Cups to be used but what are made of one of these Metals, and that 
Mass
 be never said in any of these after they are broken; and seeing there are many Churches that for want of Cups have no 
Masses,
 the 
Lord Metropolitan
 is desired to give order, that all Churches be furnished with Cups.








Decree XI.


WHereas there are many poor Churches in this Bishoprick, and especially in the 
Heaths,
 that have no consecrated Vestments for the saying of 
Mass,
 and for that reason have but few said in them, to the great prejudice of the faithful Parishioners; therefore the Synod doth command, That out of the Alms of the Parish the most 
Reverend Metropolitan
 may provide all Churches with Holy Vestments, so that none may be without them, and for that reason be with∣out having 
Masses
 every 
Sunday;
 and in those Parishes where the Alms shall not be found to be sufficient to do it, the said Lord 
Metropolitan
 is de∣sired to take such order therein, that they may be some way or other provided, and have so great a want supplied.






Decree XII.


WHereas the Christians of this Diocess have not hitherto heard 
Mass
 as upon obliga∣tion, having never imagined that the not hearing thereof upon some particular days was a mortal sin; for which reason, some have without any scruple neglected going to hear it, and others have not stayed to hear it out; therefore the Synod doth declare, That it is the Precept of the Universal Church, and that upon penalty of a mortal Sin, that all Christians, Men and Women, having no

 lawful impediment, do hear an entire 
Mass
 upon every 
Sunday
 and Holy-day that is commanded to be kept, if they have the opportunity of a Priest to say it to them. As also, that all Ma∣sters of Families are obliged by the said Precept, to make their Children, and such of their Servants and Slaves as are Christians, and all other Persons living in their Families, to go every 
Sunday
 and Holy-day to hear 
Mass,
 which every one shall endeavour to hear at his own Parish-Church, or at the place where he then happens to be; and as for those who with just reason are afraid to leave their Houses alone without any body in them, and especially such as live in 
Heaths,
 and are a great way from any Church, they shall so order the matter, that all in their Families shall take their turns of going to 
Mass
 and stay∣ing at home on 
Sundays;
 and the Vicars of the Churches must be careful to mark all such as are negligent herein, and reprove, admonish, and punish them, so as they shall judge necessary: and where there is any number of 
Clergy,
 they shall sing the 
Mass
 on 
Sundays
 and Holy-days: and when there is not a competent number, there the 
Mass
 shall be said at a convenient hour, the whole Parish being present, and he shall at the same time Preach, publish their Admonitions, the Banes of Matrimony, and whatsoever else is necessary in the Church.








Decree XIII.


THe Synod being informed that most of all the Christians that live out of Towns and Villages in the 
Heaths,
 being a great way from Church, do go to Church but once a Year, on the three days before 
Lent,
 which they call 
Monorbo,
 and then rather to fill their Bellies with what is given by Christians at that time, than to hear 
Mass;
 and that there are others who content themselves with going to hear 
Mass
 twice or thrice in the Year, and so have no opportunity of being instructed in matters of Faith and Religion as they ought to be, nor of complying with their Obligations, doth command all Christians living within two Leagues of the Church to go to 
Mass
 at least once a Month, and on the principal 
Festivities
 of our 
Lord
 and 
Lady,
 commanding the Vicars also to constrain them to do it; and all such as are but one League, to hear 
Mass
 once a Fortnight, and such as are less than a League, to hear it every 
Sunday
 and Holy-day; comman∣ding all that shall trangress herein, being obsti∣nate, after the third Admonition, to be thrown out of the Church when they come thither; neither shall the Priest go to their Houses, or give them the 
Casture,
 or Blessing, until they shall come to hear 
Mass,
 more or less, in the Form afore∣said; and besides, they shall be punished by the Prelate as he shall think good.








Decree XIV.


WHereas upon several Festivals of the Church there are Musicians called to the celebrati∣on thereof, according to the custom of the Coun∣try, who are all 
Heathens,
 small care being taken in what part of the Church they are placed, or to hinder them from playing during the time of the Holy Sacrifice, at which no Excommunicate Person or Infidel ought to be present, there∣fore the Synod doth command, that great care be taken not to suffer them to remain in the Church after the Creed is said, or the Sermon, if there be one, is ended, that so they may not be∣hold the Holy Sacrament; the Vicar shall also be careful to drive all Heathens who may come up∣on such occasion, from the Doors and Windows of the Church.






Decree XV.


WHereas there is nothing that is so great a help to the Souls of the Faithful that are in the Fire of


 
Purgatory
 as the Holy Sacrifice of the 
Mass,
 of which there is no memory remaining in

 this Diocess; that Holy Sacrifice having been in∣stituted for the health and remedy of the Living and of the Dead: Wherefore the Synod doth ex∣hort all the Faithful of this Bishoprick to accustom

 themselves to procure
 
Masses
 to be said for the Souls of their deceased Friends, and to leave something by Will that they may have 
Masses
 said for their own Souls, which will be much more profitable for them than the Feasts that they used to make for their Kindred and others in∣vited to their Funerals; which Custom shall be left off, and instead thereof, they shall give a

 
Dole
 to the Poor, which is also very profitable to the Souls of the departed. And that the De∣cree relating to such 
Masses
 may have its due effect, the Synod doth command, That all that shall be found to have died worth 2000 
Fanoins,
 and have left nothing for a certain number of 
Masses
 to be said for their Souls, shall have so much taken out of their Estates before they shall be divided among the Heirs, as shall pro∣cure the saying of five 
Masses
 for their Souls, which shall be deposited by the Executors in the hands of the Church-wardens, by them to be di∣stributed among five Priests, that they may be the sooner said; and where there are more than five Priests, the Alms shall be given to the five Eldest, there not being sufficient to divide among them all; and where there is only the Vicar of the Church, the whole shall be given to him: which Custom of procuring 
Masses
 to be said for the Souls of the Faithful departed this Life, as it is used in the Universal Church, so it is what this Synod is extreamly desirous to introduce into this Bishoprick, wherein it has been totally dis∣used, recommending this Matter earnestly to the Preachers and Confessors, to persuade all Chri∣stians to it in their Sermons and Confessions, and to the Vicars to do the same in their Admonitions.












ACTION VI. Of the Holy Sacrament of 
Penance
 and 
Extream Unction.




THe Fourth Sacrament is that of 
Penance,
 in which the Acts of the Penitent are, as it were, the Matter, and are distinguished into these three parts, 
Contrition of Heart, Confession of the Mouth,
 and 
Satisfaction for Sins, according to the direction of the Confessor.
 It belongs to the 
Con∣trition of the heart,
 that the Penitent be sorry at his Soul for the Sins that he has committed, and detesting them, is firmly resolved not to com∣mit them any more: which 
Contrition,
 tho' it sometimes happen to be perfect through Charity, so as to reconcile one to God even before he has actually received the Sacrament of 
Confession,
 yet it can never be perfect, nor a means of reconci∣liation with God, if not attended with a readi∣ness and purpose of mind to confess those very sins which it is conversant about; such sins be∣ing no less subject than others, to the Keys and the ingagements to 
Confession.
 It belongs to the 
Confession of the mouth,
 that the Penitent Confess himself entirely to his own Priest, as to all the sins that he remembers, using all due diligence according to the length of the time, since he last Confessed himself; and this 
Confession
 is not to be only of sins in general, nor only of the

 
Species
 of them, but of every sin in particular, and as far as the Penitent is able to remember of their number; declaring withal, all the ag∣gravating Circumstances, and all such as change the 
Species;
 in a word, all 
mortal
 sins, how se∣cret soever, tho' only in thoughts and wicked desires; as also all faults committed against the two last Commandments; 
Thou shalt not covet thy Neighbours Wife; Thou shalt not covet any thing that is anothers;
 such sins being at some times more dangerous for the Soul, than others that are open; all which we are commanded to do by the Divine Law; our Saviour when he ascended into Heaven, leaving the Priests for his Vicars upon Earth, and constituting them Judges, before whom all 
mortal
 sins committed by Christians, were to be brought, that by the power of the Keys, which he committed to them to forgive or retain sins, they may pronounce Sentence, which cannot be just and Righteous, neither can the punishments they impose be e∣qual or proportionated to the Nature of the Faults, without their having a full knowledge of the same, as of the matter that they pass Sentence upon; which knowledge cannot be had but by the Penitents confessing all and every 
Mortal
 Sin, whereon Judgment is to pass, not only in gene∣ral, but in 
specie
 and number, making mention of every such Sin in particular, with all its ne∣cessary circumstances, that so a just sentence o
 absolution or retention may be pronounced up∣on them. And as to 
Venial
 Sins which we fre∣quently

 fall into, and for which we are not ex∣cluded from the Grace of God, tho' the confes∣sing of, and being absolved from them, is very profitable to the Soul, yet we are not under any such precise obligation of confessing them, there being other ways by which they may be pardoned, so that it is no sin not to discover them. The third part of 
Penitence,
 is, 
Satisfa∣ction for Sins according to the judgment of the Con∣fessor;
 which 
satisfaction
 is chiefly performed by Prayer, Fasting and Alms, the Penitent being obliged to comply with the Penance imposed upon him by the Priest, who being as a Judge in the place of God, ought to impose what he thinks to be necessary, not only with respect to the amendment of Sin for the future, but chief∣ly with respect to the 
Satisfaction
 and 
Penance
 of past Sins. The Form of this Sacrament is, 
I absolve thee,
 to which necessary words the Church has thought fit to add the words following, 
from all thy Sins, in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
 There are also some Pray∣ers which the Priest saith immediately after o∣ver the Penitent, which, tho' they are not es∣sential to the form, yet are very profitable and healthful for the Penitent. Now by pronouncing the form, not only all the Sins that are confes∣sed, but all those likewise which after a due di∣ligence and Examination of the Conscience do not occurr to the Memory, so as to be discover∣ed, all such being included in the said Confessi∣on, are all pardoned; tho' with an obligation of

 confessing them, if they should ever after come to be remembred, sins being as it were chains to the Soul, from which it is delivered by the absolution of the Priest, which is applicable to such, as by virtue of contrition joyned with a desire of confessing, have obtained pardon of God for their Sins, which they were under an obli∣gation to have confessed: as also to those Sins which were never confessed, because not re∣membred after a due diligence, and to those likewise which having been once lawfully con∣fessed and truly pardoned, are by the Penitent of his own accord, and for the greater Penance confessed and submitted to the Keys several times. The Minister of this Sacrament is a Priest, 
who hath Authority to absolve,
 and is either the 
Or∣dinary,
 as the Prelates, or such as are commission∣ed and approved of by them. The effect of this Sacrament is, 
The absolution and pardon of Sins,
 and for that reason it is by the Doctors proper∣ly called the 
Table after Shipwrack,
 because the Grace which was given to us in Baptism, being lost by the commission of 
Mortal
 Sin, by which we make Shipwrack thereof, and of all the other Vertues and Gifts, which together therewith were poured down upon us, there remains no other remedy or means whereby we can be sa∣ved, but only by the plank of 
Penance,
 or the Sacrament of 
Confession;
 for that without this ei∣ther actually received, or firmly purposed ac∣cording to the command of Holy Mother Church with contrition, wherein such a purpose is al∣ways

 included, we cannot be saved nor enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; for which reason this Sacrament ought to be much reverenced and frequented, as the only remedy that sinners have for all their evils.




Decree I.


WHereas an entire Sacramental 
Confession
 is of Divine right, and necessary to all those who after Baptism fall into any 
Mortal
 Sin, and Holy Mother Church doth command all faith∣ful Christians who are come to the use of Rea∣son, upon pain of 
Mortal
 Sin, to confess at least once a Year in the time of 
Lent,
 or at 
Easter,
 when all that are capable are bound likewise to receive the most holy Sacrament of the Al∣tar, declaring all that neglect to do it, to be excommunicate; and notwithstanding, this Pre∣cept has not hitherto been in use in this Bishop∣rick, in which no Christian has ever confessed upon Obligation, and a great many not at all, which was occasioned through their ignorance of this healthful precept, and of the necessity of this Divine Sacrament, this Church having been governed by Schismatical 
Chaldaeans,
 and 
Nestori∣an
 Hereticks, the particular Enemies of this Sa∣crament, being the cause of their being totally unacquainted with the Virtue, Efficacy, and Ne∣cessity thereof. Some not using it all, others being perswaded by the Devil into a vain and superstitious Opinion, That if they should con∣fess

 themselves, they should die immediately, all which having been made known to the most 
Il∣lustrious Metropolitan
 in his first Visitation of these Churches, he at that time perswaded a great many that had never done it before to confess themselves, having undeceived them as to the unreasonable and pernicious mistakes which they lay under, therefore the Synod the more to further this, doth declare that it is the Duty of every faithful Christian, upon penalty of 
Mortal
 Sin, to observe the precept of the Church concerning 
Confession,
 at the time by her deter∣mined and founded on the Divine precept of 
Confession,
 for all such as are fallen from Grace, by the Commission of any 
Mortal
 Sin, and doth command all faithful Christians Men and Wo∣men, that are arrived at the Years of Discreti∣on, to confess themselves to their own Vicar, or to such Priests as are licensed by the Prelate to hear Confessions, at the time of 
Lent,
 or against 
Easter,
 and that whosoever shall not have com∣plyed with this Precept, or is not confessed sometime betwixt the beginning of 
Lent,
 and the second 
Sunday
 after 
Easter,
 shall be in the Church declared Excommunicate by the Vicar without waiting for any order from the Prelate to do it, until he has effectually confessed him∣self, and has undergone the punishment due to his Rebellion; and if the Vicar shall for some just reason think fit to wait any longer, for some that have been negligent, and who being busie have desired to be dispensed with till 
Whit∣suntide,


 it shall be in their power to bear with them, according to what is determined in the 2d. 
Decree
 of the 5th. 
Action,
 of the Sacrament of the 
Eucharist,
 having first admonished those that live in the 
Heaths,
 or are at Sea, or enga∣ged in Business in such places where there are no Churches to confess in, that when they return home, they are bound to do it within a month.


And that the whole of this may be executed, with the more ease, and be performed as is rea∣sonable, the Vicars of the Churches shall be obli∣ged a month or more before 
Lent,
 if it be ne∣cessary to go to all the Houses of their Parishes belonging to Christians, however remote in the 
Heaths,
 either in Person, or by some other Cler∣gyman, whom in Conscience they can trust with such a business, and taking the Names of all the Christians even to the very Slaves in every Fa∣mily that are nine Years old and upward, and of those too that are abroad, observing whether they do return home after the time of the Obli∣gation, and having made a Roll of Parchment of all that are of Age to confess themselves, they shall afterwards make a mark at their Names as they come to Confession, that so they may know certainly who have, and who have not comply∣ed, that the Disobedient may be Excommunica∣ted, which we declare to be the precise Obliga∣tion of their Office, the Pastor being bound to know his Sheep, that he may give them Food, and so far as he is able, supply all their neces∣sities,

 Temporal as well as Spiritual, and to have their number, that he may know when any are lost; and for the perfecting of such a Roll the Vicars may take the advantage of the 
Monoibo,
 at which time all Christians do flock to the Churches, at which time likewise they may hear of many that live in the 
Heaths.
 And as to those that have confessed themselves to some other approved Confessors, they shall bring a Note signed by them of their having been confessed, which they shall deliver to their Vicar, who shall thereupon mark them in his Roll; but tho' it is lawful for them to confess themselves to Confessors that are Strangers, yet they cannot receive the most Holy Sacrament, nor the Com∣munion upon Obligation in 
Lent
 any where, but in their own Parish Churches, and the Prelates in their Visitations shall call for those Rolls, in order to inform themselves how this Decree is observed.






Decree II.


WHereas the Precept of 
Confession
 obligeth all that have the use of Reason, and con∣science of 
mortal
 Sin, which happens sooner to some than others, the Synod therefore taking the most safe and probable way, according to the knowledge it hath of the People of 
Malabar,
 doth ordain, That at eight Years old and up∣ward, all People shall Confess themselves, and that without prohibiting such as are younger and

 capable to do it sooner; on the contrary, the Vicars, if they shall understand that there are any under eight, of so much Judgment and Discretion, as to be capable of committing a 
mortal
 Sin, they shall immediately constrain them to come to 
Confession,
 as being oblig'd to it, which must be left to the discretion of the Parish Priests.






Decree III.


THe Synod doth admonish all Masters of Fa∣milies, and all that have the charge of o∣thers, to be careful to make all the Persons in their Families to confess themselves at the time of Obligation, and particularly their Servants and Slaves, both Men and Women, who if they do never come to 
Confession,
 their Masters and none else must be certainly in the Fault, in ha∣ving neglected to put them in mind of it, and to order them to do it, it being their Duty, and that upon penalty of 
Mortal
 Sin, to call upon them to do it, of which they must give a strict Account to God, the Apostle St. 
Paul
 affirming, That 
he who does not take care of his Servants, has denied the Faith, and is worse than an Infidel;
 which words are chiefly to be understood of the Spiritual Necessities of those of his Family, and of Matters appertaining to their Salvation; about which matters the Vicars ought to be very care∣ful, and must observe whether the Slaves, whose Names as well as others, they must have down in their Rolls, do come to 
Confession,
 declaring

 such of them as have not complied with their obligation at the time appointed, Excommuni∣cate, having first admonished their Masters to com∣mand them to come, and acquainted them with the Declaration that will be made if they do not: and the Vicars that shall be found negligent here∣in, shall be punished at the discretion of the Prelate.






Decree IV.


ALL faithful Christians are not only obliged to Confess themselves once a Year, under penalty of 
mortal
 Sin, but also as often as they are in any probable danger of Death, or are very Sick, they are under the same obligation; wherefore the Sick Persons or those that attend them, so soon as ever they shall apprehend any danger, where-ever they live, tho' in the 
Heaths,
 shall send to call a Confessor, and shall advise the Vicar of the Church thereof, who shall ei∣ther go himself, or send another to hear their Confessions. The Vicars are also to understand, that it is their indispensible duty to enquire after the Sick, and either to go to Confess them themselves, or to send another to do it, when∣soever they shall be sent for, that so none may die without the Holy Sacrament of 
Confession,
 they being guilty of the Condemnation of such of their Sheep as go to Hell for not having con∣fessed their Sins before they died, if it was through their fault or negligence it was not done. And

 the Vicar, through whose fault or negligence any of the Parish shall die without 
Confession,
 shall be suspended from his Office and Benefice for a whole Year without any dispensation, and another shall be appointed to supply his Cure, and the Persons that attend the Sick, that shall neglect to send for the Parish-Priest, shall be severely punished at the discretion of the Prelate; and such as die in 
Hamlets
 or in 
Heaths
 without 
Confession,
 if they did not send to call a Confessor, if their death was not so sudden as to prevent them, shall not be buried in Holy Ground, nei∣ther shall the Clergy go to their Houses, or say the Office of the Dead for them, nor so much as the 
Chata.






Decree V.


NOt only such as are dangerously Sick, but all that are any ways in danger of Death, are obliged to Confess themselves; wherefore since all Women in Child-birth are in danger thereof, they shall before they are in Labour, Confess themselves, but especially before the birth of their first Child, at which time the danger is known to be the greatest; and shall likewise, if capable, receive the most Holy Sa∣crament; and if any such, not being surprized by their Labour, shall die without 
Confession,
 or being in visible danger, did not desire it, their negligence being proved, and especially if they lived in Towns, they shall be proceeded against

 in the same manner, as those are who through their own fault die without 
Confession
 as is above decreed.






Decree VI.


THe Synod being informed that the greatest part of those that die of the Small-Pox, tho' they lived in Towns and desired 
Confession,
 do die without it, that Distemper being so very dangerous and infectious, that the Priests are afraid of coming near those that have it; doth command all Vicars to be careful, that none such do die without 
Confession,
 and either to go them∣selves, in Person, or to send one to Confess them; a due regard being still to be had to their own health, either by confessing them at some distance, or so that the Wind shall blow the steams from them, and by having taken preservatives against the Di∣stemper; that so none may die without 
Confessi∣on,
 which is what the Synod doth very earnestly recommend to them in the Lord.






Decree VII.


THe Synod doth earnestly recommend to all the faithful Christians Inhabitants of this Bishoprick, not to satisfie themselves with having confessed their Sins once a Year at 
Easter,
 when they are bound to it upon the penalty of 
mortal
 Sin; but that they do frequently make use of this Sacrament, in proportion to the Sins they fall

 into daily, and not to fail to Confess themselves on the Festivities of the 
Nativity
 of the 
Holy Ghost,
 and the 
Assumption of our Lady,
 and at the 
Wake
 of their Parish, and the Vicars must not fail to admonish their People thereof on the 
Sunday
 before those Festivities.






Decree VIII.


THe Synod doth declare, That notwith∣standing the power of pardoning Sins is annexed to the Sacerdotal Order, nevertheless that all Priests cannot hear 
Confessions,
 but only such as are Licensed by the Prelate; for the Act of Absolution being an Act of Jurisdiction, and Judicature, cannot be without Subjects, which the Prelate only can give when he appoints Con∣fessors with such limitations as he thinks necessa∣ry; so that a Priest having no Licence, or trans∣gressing the bounds that were set to him by his Prelate, if he shall presume to hear Confessions and Absolve, his Confessions and Absolutions are void and of no force; neither are the Sins of the Penitents pardoned, who are therefore bound to Confess themselves again to a Confessor that has power to Absolve, as if they had not Con∣fessed before; but when any one is in probable danger of Death, and cannot have a Priest that is Licensed, any Priest, tho' he is not Licensed, may Confess and Absolve him in that case.








Decree IX.


WHereas it belongs to the good Government of the Church and the Faithful, that Crimes of a heinous nature should be judged not by every Priest, but by Prelates or Bishops, because for that reason Christians will be the more fearful to commit them; besides that, it has always been the Custom of the Church, to reserve to the Prelates, and even to the Pope as the Universal Head of the Church, some Crimes from which they and none else can Ab∣solve, or not do it without their leave: there∣fore the Synod doth declare, That notwithstan∣ding this Doctrine has not hitherto been under∣stood or practised in this Bishoprick, by reason of the great Ignorance of the Church and sacred Canons that has reigned therein: Nevertheless, that the ordinary Confessors have no power to Absolve in cases reserved to the Prelate, and least of all in those that are reserved to the Pope, namely, those contained in the 
Bulla Coen
 Domini;
 which all Confessors ought to be ac∣quainted with; neither can they Absolve in the Crime of Heresy, or in any cases wherein the Faith is concerned; all which do belong to the Court of the 
Holy Office of Inquisition,
 or to such as are Commissioned by them, or to the Bi∣shop who by himself may Absolve in the Form of the Holy Council of 
Trent;
 and according to the Ordinations of the Holy Fathers: Nei∣ther

 can ordinary Confessors dispense with or change the Vows of Penitents, because that be∣longs to the Prelate, or such as are deputed by him, or that have obtained Apostolical Privi∣leges to that effect. Only at the point of Death, not only approved Confessors, but also all simple Priests, there being no other to be had, are ob∣liged to hear 
Confessions,
 and may also Absolve in all Cases and from all Censures to whomsoe'er reserved. Tho' as to the Censures with this Obligation, that if the Sick Person shall recover, they shall return to the Persons again to whom they were before reserved, from whom they shall receive such healthful Penance as shall be thought meet.






Decree X.


THat Confessors may the better know in what Cases they may, and in what Cases they may not absolve their Penitents, having no Authority to do it, the Synod doth command the 
Bulla Coenae Domini,
 and all the Cases reserved in this Bishoprick to be pasted on a Board, and set up in all 
Sacristies,
 and where there are no 
Sacristies,
 in the chief Chapel in every Church in the 
Malabar
 Tongue, for the direction of the Confessors, and doth furthermore in its regulation of the reser∣ved Cases in this Diocess, declare, That willful Murther, publickly committed with violence on the Person of an Ecclesiastick, the voluntary firing of Houses, or of any Goods belonging to

 Christians, formal Simony both in the givers and receivers, marrying without the Vicar and two Witnesses, Schism and Disobedience against the Prelate, in all that are guilty thereof, or that fa∣vour such as are, the having of any of the Books condemned by this Synod in their Houses, or the reading of any of them, the performing of the publick Ceremonies called 
Taliconum Coliconu,
 the having of 
Pagods
 or Idols in their Houses, and the giving them any Veneration, have all the censure of Excommunication annexed to them, of which tho' some are
 reserved by Law, yet that they might be the better known, it was thought fit to have them expressed here.








Decree XI.


THe Sentence of Excommunication being the last and most rigorous punishment of the Church, and which for that reason ought not to be inflicted but with great Caution and Conside∣ration, the Synod doth therefore condemn the facility wherewith it has been used in this Dio∣cess upon very slight and impertinent occasions, commanding it not to be inflicted hereafter, but for weighty causes, and with great considerati∣on, and never by word of mouth, but always in Writing. The Synod doth likewise condemn what has been formerly commanded in this Bi∣shoprick, which was, that in certain Cases Pe∣nitents were not to be absolved, but at the hour of Death, and in some not then neither, which is contrary to Christian Charity, and the Rules of the Church, who as a Pious Mother at all times receives true Penitents, and never shuts the Gates of Salvation against any of her Chil∣dren: So that let their Crimes be never so enor∣mous, yet upon their doing Penance, and ex∣pressing a deep sorrow for their Sins, and yield∣ing the satisfaction that is imposed upon them, they are graciously received, and made free at

 least in the Internal or Sacramental Court: But being there is no other punishment in this Church, by reason of its being under Kings that are 
Infi∣dels,
 beyond that of Excommunication or Ex∣clusion from the Church, some who are absol∣ved in the Internal Court may still continue ex∣communicate in the External, so as not to be permitted to enter the Church; and tho' the Priests may go to their Houses, they shall not give them the 
Casture,
 until such time as the Pre∣late shall order it to be done, having a regard to the heinousness of their Crimes, and the length of time from the Commission of them, that by this means the facility wherewith the Christians of this Diocess commit several Crimes, namely Murther, and the Ceremonies of the 
Taliconum
 may be removed.






Decree XII.


FOrasmuch as the Ignorance of Confessors is the destruction of Penitents, and thorow the Error of the Key, there is nothing done, and it being known to the Synod that in this Diocess there are many Confessors that are such Idiots, as not to know what they do in Confession, all the Priests exercising themselves therein with∣out ever having been examined as to their suf∣ficiency; it doth therefore command, that from henceforward no Priest shall presume to hear Confessions without being Licensed thereunto in writing by the Prelate, which License shall not

 be granted to any, but what have been first exa∣mined by Learned Persons, as to their sufficien∣cy for such an Employment, and until such time as this Church is provided of Prelates to regulate all such matters to the best of their understand∣ing, the Synod doth commit the Examination and Approbation to the
 Fathers of the Society of 
Jesus,
 of the College of 
Vaipicotta,
 upon

 whose Examination and Approbation, and a Li∣cence granted by the Governour whom the most 
Illustrious Metropolitan
 will leave in this Bishop∣rick, the Priests may hear Confessions with the limitations expressed in the said Licences, and all such as are at present Confessors, shall be exami∣ned by order of the 
Lord Metropolitan
 at his next Visitation, and such of the Clergy as shall be made Parish-Priests, or Vicars, shall be first examined, and approved of in the same form to be Confessors, that so such as are not qualified to be Confessors, may not be admitted Vicars, whose precise Obligation it is to confess their Sheep: And all Confessors that are not appro∣ved of by the said 
Lord Metropolitan
 in the form aforesaid, this Synod doth suspend from the Of∣fice of Confessor till such time as they shall be effectually examined and allowed of, and if any Priest, which God forbid, shall be found hear∣ing Confessions without such a Licence, except in the case of danger of Death, and where no Confessor is to be had, he shall be suspended from his Office and Benefice for a Year, and be further punished according to the degree of his Contumacy, and the Penitents shall be admo∣nished to confess themselves again to some appro∣ved Confessor.








Decree XIII.


BY reason of the great want there is of know∣ing and able Confessors in this Bishoprick, the Synod for the sake of the Sheep thereof doth approve of all such Confessors as understand the 
Malabar
 Tongue, and are Licensed Confessors in any other Diocess, of whom also the Prelate may make use for the assistance of the Parish-Priests in 
Lent,
 where it shall be judged neces∣sary, and especially of the Priests of this Diocess residing at 
Cochim.






Decree XIV.


THe Synod doth grievously condemn the Sacrilegious Ignorance of those Priests, who when they have confessed any at the com∣mand of the Prelate, or of any other by whom they are authorized, after having heard the Sins of their Penitents, do carry them to the said Pre∣late, to be absolved by him in the Sacramental Court; which was what happened to the most 
Il∣lustrious Metropolitan
 in these parts; the Synod doth therefore teach and declare, That none can absolve the Penitent in the Sacramental Court, but the Priest only that heard his Sins; for whereas he is the Judge, it is he that ought to pass sentence and absolve, in conformity to what he has heard confessed, the contrary be∣ing a gross and manifest Error.








Decree XV.


FOrasmuch as there are some ignorant Cler∣gymen, who being desired by Christians to read the Gospels and Prayers to them, or to give them the Blessing on their heads, do igno∣rantly use the form of Sacramental Absolution, saying, 
I absolve thee from thy Sins in the Name of the Father,
 &c. wherefore the Synod doth advertise and admonish them not to commit such an Error, it being a most grievous Sacrilege to apply the Sacramental form, where it ought not to be, wherefore they shall only read the Go∣spels and Prayers allowed, ending with the Blessing 
In the Name of the Father,
 &c.








The Doctrine of the Sacrament of 
Ex∣tream Unction.


THe fifth Sacrament of 
Extream Ʋnction
 has for its matter, 
the Oyl of Olive blessed by a Bishop,
 it is called 
Extream Ʋnction,
 because it is the last of all the Holy Unctions, instituted by our Lord Christ in his Church, and the last that is received by a Christian; this Sacrament is to be administred to an adult Person that is sick, when apprehended to be in probable danger of death, who is to be anointed by the Priest the only minister of this Sacrament, on those parts wherewith he hath offended God chiefly; that is to say, on the Eyes, because of Sins commit∣ted

 by the sight; on both the Ears, because of Sins committed by hearing; on the mouth, be∣cause of Sins committed by tasting and speaking; on both the hands, for the sins committed in feeling and touching; on both the Feet, for the Sins com∣mitted in walking; on the Loins and Reins, for be∣ing the chief seat of Carnal pleasure; every one of which parts must be anointed by the Priest, making the sign of the Cross upon them with his Thumb dipt in Holy Oil, and at the same time repeating the words of the form, which are, 
By this Holy Ʋnction, and his most tender mercy may our Lord forgive thee all the Sins thou hast committed by thy sight;
 and so on, naming every part or sense as it is anointed: The effect of this Sacrament, is the Health of the Soul, and of the Body also, so far as it is convenient and necessary to the Soul, which is the chief; moreover, it washeth away the Reliques of sin, if there are any remaining in the Soul, comforting the Soul of the Sick withall, and confirming and exciting in it a great confidence in the Divine Mercy, by vir∣tue of which Consolation it suffers the troubles of Sickness with the more patience, and with the greater ease resists the Temptations of Satan, whose custom it is to assault the Soul with ex∣traordinary violence in its last Hour: It like∣wise cherishes and succours the Body, so far as it is convenient for the salvation of the Soul, as S. 
James
 teacheth us in his Canonical Epistle, saying, 
Is any one Sick, let him call for the Priests of the Church, and they shall pray over him, anoint∣ing

 him with Oyl in the Name of the Lord, and the Prayer of Faith shall save the Sick, and the Lord shall give him ease, and if he be in Sins, they shall be forgiven him:
 The Apostle in saying 
they shall be pardoned,
 demonstrates it to be a Sacra∣ment, whose Virtue and Nature is to conferr Grace, that pardoneth Sins; and in saying, 
If any are sick among you,
 he declares the time when this Sacrament is to be received, that is in time of dangerous Sickness; and in saying, 
they shall call the Priests of the Church,
 he sheweth that the Priests are the only Ministers of this Sacrament, and in saying, 
they shall be anointed with Oil in the Name of the Lord,
 he sheweth, that Holy Oil is the matter of this Sacrament; and in saying, 
they shall pray over the Sick, anointing,
 he shew∣eth, that the form of this Sacrament is to be pro∣nounced by way of deprecation, or Prayer; and in saying, 
the Lord shall give him ease,
 he shew∣eth also, that the effect of this Sacrament is to give health to the Body, so far as it is convenient and necessary to the health of the Soul. And where∣as this Sacrament was instituted for the use of the Sick, none but what are dangerously so must take it, and a Person who shall recover after having received it, may when dangerously sick receive it again, it having been instituted by our Lord for that end; and to prepare, defend and forti∣fie us at the time of our departure out of this life, whensoever it is.






Decree I.


WHereas in this Bishoprick there has not been hitherto any use of the Sacrament of 
Extream Ʋnction,
 in which for want of Ca∣tholick Instruction, there has been no knowledge of the Institution, Effects, or Efficacy thereof; therefore the Synod does most earnestly re∣commend the use of this Sacrament, comman∣ding the Vicars to be vigilant over the Sick of their Parishes, where-ever they live, whether in the Villages or in the 
Heaths;
 and whenever they shall hear of any in danger of Death, to car∣ry the most Holy Sacrament of 
Ʋnction,
 and administer it to them according to the 
Roman
 Ceremonial, which is to be translated into 
Syri∣an,
 and kept in all Churches, anointing them with Oil, and making the sign of the Cross with Holy Oil on both their Eyes shut; doing the right first, and then the left, upon the Eye-lashes, and upon both the Ears, the Nostrils, and the Mouth, being shut, on both the Lips; but if the Distemper should be such, that the Sick Per∣son's Mouth cannot be shut, or not without dan∣ger, then the upper Lip shall be anointed, ma∣king the sign of the Cross upon it; as also both the Palms of the Hands, the Balls of the Feet and the Loins, ordering the Sick Person to be moved gently; neither is it necessary that any more of these parts should be anointed than what is convenient for the making the sign of the

 Cross with the Holy Oil; and the Priest must be sure to remember in this, as in all other Sa∣craments, to join the Form with the Matter, re∣peating the words of the Form as he anoints the parts: If the Sick Person shall happen to ex∣pire while the Priest is anointing, the Priest be∣ing satisfied that he is dead, shall proceed no further with the Office; and the Vicar, through whose negligence any Parishioner shall die with∣out having received this Sacrament, shall be suspended from his Office and Benefice for six Months.






Decree II.


FOrasmuch as the Troubles the Sick are in, together with the want of good Instructi∣ons in matters appertaining to their Salvation, do but too often make them unmindful of the Holy Sacraments; wherefore the Synod doth command and earnestly recommend it to all Confessors that are called upon to Confess any Sick Person to instruct them in the Doctrine and Efficacy of this Sacrament of 
Ʋnction,
 admonish∣ing, persuading and intreating them when they shall come to stand in need of it, to have it administred to them; and they shall also admo∣nish the People, and particularly those who at∣tend the Sick Person, not to fail to call the Vicar when it is necessary, that is, when they apprehend the Sick Person to be in any danger, and before he has lost his Senses, to give him

 the Holy 
Ʋnction;
 and such as shall be negligent therein, besides the offence they do to God and the Sick Person, shall be punished severely at the pleasure of the Prelate.






Decree III.


THe Synod doth command the Priests that go to anoint the Sick, tho' it should be to the 
Hamlets,
 to go in their Surplice and Stole, carrying the Vessel the Holy Oil is in, in their hands, covered with a piece of Silk, with great reverence, having the 
Chamus
 or Parish-Clerk before them with the Cross of the Church in his Arms, who, or some other Person, shall also car∣ry a Pot of Holy Water, and if it is in the Night, a Lanthorn or some other Light before him, that so all People may know what he is going about; and if the Sick Person is in a condition, he shall persuade him to Confess himself again, and be reconciled, notwithstanding he should have Con∣fessed himself the day before; letting the Sick Person know that it is necessary in order to his receiving the Holy Sacrament of 
Ʋnction
 with the greater purity; and when the Priest shall be to carry this Sacrament a long way to those that live in 
Heaths,
 he shall go in the best Form he can, and shall carry the Surplice and Stole along with him, that so when he comes to administer the Sacrament, he may do it with all due reve∣rence; he shall likewise, if the Sick Person has not a 
Crucifix
 of his own, leave one upon his

 Pillow, exhorting him to fix both his Eyes and confidence thereon at his last minute, begging by it the pardon of his Sins of our Lord, who for our sake died thereon.










ACTION VII. Of the Holy Sacraments of 
Order
 and 
Matrimony.




The Doctrine of the Sacrament of 
Order.


THe sixth Sacrament is that of 
Order,
 which was instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ the day before he suffered for us, after that he had made an end of instituting the Sacrament of the Eucharist, that so he might institute the Sacrifice and the Priests that were to offer it together; at which time he created the Apostles Priests, giving them withal power to consecrate others, that so the Sacrifice and the Priesthood might be continued in the Church till the end of the World. The Matter of this Sacrament is that which is delivered to the Person that is ordained, for the exercise of that Order he has received; to the Priests, a Cup with Wine in it, and a Patten with Bread; to a Deacon the Book of the Gospels; and to a Sub-Deacon an empty Cup and Patten, and so as to the other inferiour Orders: The Form of the Priesthood and other Orders, are the words spoke by the Bishop when he

 delivers to every one that which belongs to his Ministry and the exercise of his Order. The Minister of this Sacrament is only a Bishop, to whom only Christ committed the power of Consecrating Priests; the effect of it is the en∣crease of Grace, to the end that the Person or∣dained may be a fit Minister. This Sacrament was instituted by Christ as highly necessary in his Church; for a Sacrifice and Priesthood are so join∣ed, that the one cannot be without the other; wherefore since under the New Testament the visible. Sacrifice of the Holy 
Eucharist
 was to be instituted, it became therefore necessary, that there should be a new, visible and eternal Priest∣hood in the same Church, whereby the ancient Priesthood of the Old Law was translated; and there were Priests provided accordingly for the Offering of the Divine Sacrifice; which Priests be∣ing lawfully ordained, our Lord Jesus Christ has given them power over his true and real Body, to Consecrate, Offer, and Administer it, as also o∣ver his Mystical Body the Church; giving them power to pardon and retain Sins; to which power 
t likewise belongs to rule and govern all Chri∣stian People, and to lead them in the way to Eternal Life. Now the Priesthood being so high an Office, that it may be exercised with the more decency and veneration, it was conveni∣ent that there should be different Orders or Ministers, who are bound by their Function to serve the Priesthood, and to be divided in such 
 manner, that after having received the 
Clerical

 Tonsure,
 they are to ascend through the lower to the higher Orders. The
 lower are the 
Ostiary, Reader, Exorcist, Acolythus.
 The higher those which are called 
Holy,
 and are the 
Sub-Deacon, Deacon,
 and 
Priest,
 to which degrees there is joined that of 
Bishops,
 who succeeded in the place of the Apostles, and as St. 
Paul
 saith, are ordained to 
govern the Church of God;
 so that they are in a higher degree than the Priests, and to them only it belongs, by virtue of their Office, to administer the Sacrament of 
Confirmation,
 to Consecrate the Holy Oil of 
Chrism,
 and to Consecrate Altars and Churches, and or∣dain Priests and other Bishops. The Church en∣joins 
Continency
 and 
Chastity
 to all that take 
Holy Holy,
 that so being disingaged from all other business they may employ themselves whol∣ly in the Ministry of the Altar, and be intent only on matters appertaining to our Lord, and Divine Worship. The Church does not admi
 
Slaves
 to be Priests, because it is necessary to the Divine Worship, that the Ministers thereo
 should be free and not subject to others, and

 that they should not have been guilty of Mur∣ther or Blood, neither must they have been born out of lawful Wedlock, nor have any blemish or maim, nor have been twice Married, nor have married a Widow, nor be Boys that are not come to perfect Age; all which is ordered for just Reasons and Considerations, and out of respect to the high Mystery wherein they are exercised.




Decree I.


WHereas it has been hitherto the Custom of this Diocess to ordain 
Boys
 even Priests, and that without examining their Lives and Manners, having for Money and not for any extraordinary sufficiency, all the Orders In∣feriour, as well as Holy, conferred upon them in one day, contrary to the Holy Canons and the Laws of the Church: Therefore the Synod doth command, That from henceforward, none be ordained but what have first been examined as to their Sufficiency, Lives, and Manners, which shall be done by the Prelate, or by some ap∣pointed by him, fearing God, and who are ob∣servers of the Holy Canons, and the Forms of the Holy Council of 
Trent.
 And whereas in the said Council it is commanded, That none be ordained Sub-Deacon under Two and Twen∣ty, nor Deacon under Three and Twenty, nor Priest till they are Five and Twenty, this Sy∣nod doth command the same to be inviolably

 observed; declaring, that no Prelate can dispense therewith without being particularly impowered and authorized thereunto by the Apostolical See. And forasmuch as there are great numbers in this Diocess that have been ordained before they were at that Age, the Synod suspends all such, whether Priests, Deacons, or Sub-Deacons, from the exercise of their several Functions, until such time as they have perfectly attained to it, they shall nevertheless hold their Places, and reap the benefits thereof, in the same manner as if they were in the exercise of their Functions: And as to their Sufficiency, the Synod doth declare, That as the Council of 
Trent
 requires, that all that are ordained do understand 
Latin,
 so in this Diocess it is required, that all that are ordained if they do not understand 
Latin,
 should understand 
Sy∣rian:
 Neither shall any 
Syrian
 that does not un∣derstand it so well, as to be able to read and sing it, so as to understand what they say in the Offices, be admitted into Orders, or at least not into those that are Holy.






Decree II.


ALL that are in Orders in this Diocess having been Simonaically ordained in having pay'd a certain price, upon a formal Bargain for their Orders, have thereby incurr'd the grievous pu∣nishments of the Law. Nevertheless in consi∣deration of their Ignorance, and the false Do∣ctrine wherein they have been educated by thei


 former Prelates, the 
Most Reverend Metropolitan,
 both by his ordinary Authority, this 
See
 being va∣cant, and the Apostolical Authority committed to him over this Church, doth Absolve all that have been so ordained, from all Penalties and Censures which by the Law they have incurr'd, by having been Simonaically ordained, commanding them to have no further scruples about that matter, and dispensing with them all as to the exercise of their Orders, so that they may lawfully offici∣ate, as in right they may and ought to do.






Decree III.


THe Synod being informed that there are several Priests, who tho' infected with the Leprosie, and miserably deformed thereby, do presume to Celebrate, to the great loathing of the People, and to handle the Holy Vessels and Vestments, to the endangering of the health of others, doth command, That none that are notoriously Leprous, do presume to Celebrate, 
ll such being irregular according to the Law of Corporal defects, on the account of the disgust they give to People when they see them Celebrate in such a condition, and receive the most Holy Sacrament of the Altar at their 
ands.








Decree IV.


WHereas it is the custom to receive the 
Casture
 or Blessing from the hands of the oldest Clergy-man that officiates in the Quire, and for all that are present to return it to him; which according to the usage of this Diocess, contains in it a Symbol of Charity, Communion, and Brotherly Love; the Synod being informed that there are those, who not being in Charity with their Neighbours, do not speak to them, nor take them by the hand, and do neither give nor take the 
Casture
 from them, thereby discovering that they live in malice with their Neighbours, denying them the ordinary Ecclesi∣astical Salutation used in the Church of this Diocess; doth command, that all that shall re∣fuse to give or receive the same, be punished by the Prelate as Persons living in hatred or out of charity with their Neighbours; and that un∣til such time as they shall give the said 
Casture,
 they shall not be suffered to come to the Altar, according to the command of our Lord Jesus Christ: Neither shall they be permitted to offici∣ate or Minister in the Church; neither shall the Blessing be given them until they have effectu∣ally reconciled themselves to their Brother.








Decree V.


WHereas it is the Precept of the Universal Church, that all that are in Holy Orders do recite the whole Divine Office, and the usage of this Diocess is, to recite it only when they go to Church, and there, tho' it happen to be near ended before they come, having heard a little to go away immediately, reckoning they have complied with their Obligation, tho' they do not say over what they were not present at, there being very few that recite the Divine Office in their Houses, some imagining that they are not bound to do it any where but in the Church, and others excusing themselves for want of Books, there being but very few, and those that are, are in Manuscript in this Bishoprick; therefore the Synod doth declare, That all that are in Holy Orders, are obliged upon pain of 
Mortal
 Sin, to recite the whole Divine Office as it is recited in the Church; and that all such as shall come late, shall be obliged to recite what they have missed; and if they do not recite it in the Church, they shall do it at home in their Houses, having the conveniency of a Book, which being what a great many do want, the Synod obligeth all such to recite the said Divine Office by Beads, that so there may be none but what perform this duty either by Book or Beads: And tho' the Divine Office consists of seven distinct Ca∣nonical hours, yet in this Church, in conformity

 to the 
Breviary
 thereof, they shall only recite one part at two times in the Morning, and the other part in the Evening, without making any other difference in the Divine Office, besides that of repeating one part thereof in the Morning and the other in the Evening; and whereas they who have no Books are to recite with Beads, such beginning in the Morning as the Divine Office is begun in the Church, shall say Thirty-three 
Pater Nosters,
 and as many 
Ave Maries,
 with the 
Gloria Patri,
 &c. in the Mor∣ning; and when they are ended, they shall more∣over say twelve 
Pater Nosters,
 and twelve 
Ave Maries,
 for the Souls of the Faithful departed, and one 
Pater Noster
 and one 
Ave Mary
 for the Pope, and the same for the Bishop, instead of the Prayers that are said for them in the Church: and instead of the Prayers that are to be re∣cited by them in the Evening, they shall say Thirty-three 
Pater Nosters,
 and as many 
Ave Ma∣ries,
 with the 
Gloria Patri,
 &c. as in the Mor∣ning; and when they are ended, they shall say
 nine 
Ave Maries
 to our Lady, and one 
Pater Noster
 and one 
Ave Mary
 for the Pope, and another for the Bishop as in the Morning, provided that

 such as have Books shall recite by them, and not by Beads, and such as recite by Beads, if they have said any of the Prayers either in the Morning or Evening at Church, shall not be ob∣liged to recite them again, but shall only recite those which they may have omitted there.






Decree VI.


THe Synod doth command the Creed of St. 
Athanasius, Quicunque vult,
 to be translated into 
Syrian,
 and to be put into all the 
Brevia∣ries,
 and Books of Prayer of this Diocess, and to be read every 
Sunday
 in the Church immediately after Morning Service, desiring the Reverend Father 
Francisco Roz,
 of the Society of 
Jesus
 to translate it, and all the Curates and Clergy to learn the said Creed by Heart, which is what the Holy Canons recommend to them, for as much as that Creed contains in it summarily the chief Mysteries of our Faith, and is used and sung in the Universal Church.






Decree VII.


THe Synod doth earnestly recommend it to all the Clergymen and Curates, not to be absent from Church at the time of Divine Ser∣vice, Morning nor Evening, and that none of∣fer to talk or divert themselves there any other way, as has been the Custom, or to dispose themselves to sleep whilst others are reciting,

 who are also to take notice, that in reciting they ought not to begin a new Verse before the Con∣gregation has done with the former, and that tho' it has hitherto been the custom for the old∣est Clergyman that was present at Divine Service to give the 
Casture,
 that from henceforward the true Vicar of the Church being present, shall in every thing be preferr'd to all others as he is the particular Pastor of the Church.






Decree VIII.


THere being no reason why they that do not minister in the Church, should be e∣qually rewarded with those that do; it seems just to the Synod that the Curates and other Cler∣gymen, that are absent either from Morning or Evening Service, or from the 
Mass
 of the day on 
Sundays
 and Holydays, be marked by the Vi∣car, or the oldest Clergyman in his absence, that when the Dividend comes to be made, for eve∣ry time they have been absent so much may be deducted from their share, as they that make the distribution shall think fit, in proportion to the quantity of the Dividend, which shall be done only when they are not hindred by some lawful Impediment, as Sickness, or are not other∣wise employed in the Service of the Church, or by the Prelate, in all which cases they are to be excused: and the 
Sconses
 shall be equally divi∣ded among the rest.








Decree IX.


THe Synod being informed, that great num∣bers of Clergy-men do use superstitious and Heathen Exorcisms, taking words out of an impious and prohibited Book called 
Parisman,
 for the casting out of Devils, doth command in virtue of Holy Obedience, that none presume to use any other exorcisms to that effect, but such as the 
Roman
 Church makes use of, and have been approved of by the Holy Fathers, which are to be bound up with the Offices of the Admi∣nistration of the Sacraments, and all Clergymen, that shall be found to use any other, or to use any unknown superstitious words or Ceremo∣nies with such as are possessed, shall be suspended from their Office and Benefice for a Year, and be subject to what other penalties the Prelate shall be pleased to lay upon them, according to the quality of the Superstitions they have made use of; and in case they shall after they have been admonished and censured, persist therein, they shall then be Excommunicated; and when it shall appear that any have acted thus upon any compact or contract with the Devil, which God forbid, as it is said some do, they shall be declared Excommunicate, until they have done the condign Penance, which the Prelate shall have imposed upon them, and shall be more∣over suspended from their Office and Benefice during their Lives, without any hopes of a dis∣pensation,

 and shall be yet further punished, as the Law requires they should be, who are guil∣ty of such Crimes, and are convicted of having had a compact with the Devil.






Decree X.


WHereas there are several Clergymen, who according to the superstitious Custom of the Heathens, do give good days for Marriages, and do several other things, at the request of Christians for the Heathens, and for that end keep an account of the lucky and unlucky days of the 
Gentiles
 in their Books, and do use some of their Prayers, and do make Schemes after the manner of 
Astrologers,
 as appears from seve∣ral even of their Church-books, the Synod doth command in virtue of Holy Obedience, and upon pain of the greater Excommunication, that no Ecclesiastical or Secular, or 
Cassanar,
 shall dare to give good or bad days for Marriages, or on any other occasion, or to draw any thing out of a Book of Lots, and namely out of that which is generally bound up with the Book called 
Pa∣risman,
 or out of any other place, or by whom∣soever invented; and whosoever shall transgress herein shall be declared excommunicate, and shall be suspended from their Office for a Year, and six Months from their Benefice; it being the duty of the Priests rather to admonish the People to avoid all Heathen Superstitions, and to chuse the solemn days of the Church, or the

 Saints days, who may intreat God for them, for the celebration of their Marriages, or any other days they please, all days being good to those that do good upon them, being all equally the work of Gods hands. Those only which are spent in the greatest works and the higher cele∣bration of the Divine Mysteries, being the days that are to be most reverenced.






Decree XI.


WHereas it is decent that Priests being the Masters, from whom the People are to learn good Manners should themselves give good example, the Synod is therefore much concern∣ed for the scandal some give by their being dis∣orderly in their eating and drinking, to the great disgrace of the Sacerdotal Office among so many 
Infidels,
 and does recommend Moderation to them, ordering such as shall be found at any time overtaken with drink to be sharply repro∣ved by the Prelate, and if it appear that they are frequently so drunk, as to lose their Judg∣ment, they shall be suspended from the Exercise of their Orders for ever, tho' not from reading Prayers with others in the Church, nor from the profits they may receive from thence. The Synod doth likewise command, That no Priest shall dare to eat or drink in a Tavern or Pub∣lick Eating house, it being very unbecoming the gravity of the Sacerdotal Office so to do, and is therefore forbid the Priests by Law: it

 doth likewise prohibit all Priests to eat with 
In∣fidels,
 whether 
Heathens, Mahometans,
 or 
Jews,
 upon pain of being suspended for four Months, from their Office and Benefice.






Decree XII.


IT being convenient that Clergymen should al∣ways go in a habit different from that of the Laity, and in such a one as becomes their Fun∣ction, wherefore the Synod doth command, that no Clergymen presume to go abroad in Dou∣blets with their Skirts flanting out, as has been too customary, or with any open Linen: but when they shall go into Town, or to the Church, or when they travel upon the Road, they shall wear a white and black, or blew Vestment, ac∣cording to Custom, and a Hat or Bonnet on their Heads; neither shall they at any time go disguised, no not at Nights, nor when they go a hunting, or Fishing: and all that shall transgress herein shall be severely punished; neither shall they wash themselves, or if they do, it shall not be in the Company of Women, according to the custom of the Country, it being a thing very unbecoming the gravity of the Mini∣sters of the Church: and as for their Beards, they shall be left to their liberty to do what they shall think fit, only such as are Young shall not suffer their Beards to grow, but shall still keep them shaved, and they that wear them

 very long, shall take care to
 cut off the Hair, that grows near their Lips, that so they may not be a hinderance to their receiving the Blood of the Cup in the 
Mass,
 by being so long as to touch it.






Decree XIII.


WHereas the Apostle S. 
Paul
 saith, That the Persons that are particularly dedicated to the service of God and the Divine Worship, ought not to entangle themselves in secular Affairs; for which reason all Clerks are by the Sacred Ca∣nons prohibited to Merchandize, a thing very lit∣tle observed in this Diocess, therefore the Synod doth prohibit all the Clerks thereof to go upon the publick Exchange, or to Farm any of the Revenues, or to be Factors or Agents, or to farm any Contracts singly, or in Company: or to sell any sorts of Merchant Goods publickly in their houses, or any sort of Victuals, or to bear any
 secular Office, all that shall transgress herein, shall be most rigorously punished by the Prelate, and if they do not reform, shall be suspended from their Orders, and such as are 
Taregas,
 if they shall not renounce that Office within a month, shall not be suffer∣ed to enter the Church, and shall be suspended from their Office and Benefice, until such time as they have effectually abandoned it.








Decree XIV.


WHereas several Priests in this Diocess not having the fear of God or of the Church, or of their Prelates, before their eyes, and with∣out having a due regard to the high Station and Dignity they are in, do occupy themselves in Secular Business and in publick Merchandize, and that they may do it the more securely, do neither wear the Sacerdotal Habit, nor the 
Tonsure,
 nor any manner of Crown, but do wear their Hair long like the Laity: Therefore the Synod doth command in vertue of obedience, and upon pain of Excommunication, That all Clerks in Holy Orders, do wear the Habit 
Tonsure
 and shaved Crown, and not long Hair after the fashion of the Laity; and that whosoever shall transgress herein, shall be declared Excommunicate, until they have put on the said Habit and 
Tonsure,
 and shall have their Crown shaved as other Ecclesiasticks.






Decree XV.


WHereas there are several Ecclesiasticks, as well 
Cassanars
 as 
Chamazes,
 who being unmind∣ful of their obligations, to free themselves from some vexations of 
Infidel
 Kings; or, which is yet more scandalous, to be favoured and pro∣tected by such Princes against their Prelates, that they may not punish them for their faults, do

 receive Pay from the said Kings as the Natives do, whereby they are obliged to take the Field as Souldiers, and Fight when commanded, which is expresly contrary to the Holy Canons and Ec∣clesiastical Laws: Therefore the Synod doth command in virtue of obedience, and upon pain of Excommunication to be 
ipso facto
 incurred, That no 
Cassanar
 nor 
Chamaz
 do from henceforward presume to receive pay from any King as a Soul∣dier; and that whosoever shall transgress herein, shall be immediately declared Excommunicate, and shall not be Absolved before they have renounced the said pay, and all the obligations thereof, and have undergone condign punishment for their fault.






Decree XVI.


IT having been the Universal custom from the beginning of the Church, for all that are in Holy Orders, and especially Priests, to keep Chastity and Continency, as is evident from all the ancient Councils, 
Eastern
 and 
Western;
 and tho' in the beginning of the Church, as well for the want of Priests, as for the making use of several Learned Men who were Married when they turned Christians, but not having been twice Married, several who were Married were not only consecrated Priests but Bishops also; which custom still remains both in the 
Greek
 Church, and in some that are subject to the Apostolical 
See,
 by which it is tolerated for just Reasons: Nevertheless the Church Catholick did 
ever consent that Priests should Marry after

 they are in Orders, but was much rather for having such as were Married to leave their Wives, that that they might serve the better in the Holy Ministry: And whereas in this Diocess (which the Synod has taken notice of with great sorrow) through their vile ignorance of the Law, and the abounding iniquity of the Times, and their ha∣ving been governed by Schismatical Prelates, Priests have Married after they were in Orders, nay have taken Orders on purpose that they might Marry the better, and have frequently Married Widows, and some have Married three or four times, making no account of the impe∣diment of Bigamy, so strictly observed in the Church from the beginning, but did, notwith∣standing that, go on still exercising their Functi∣on, some few excepted, who after they had been twice Married, gave over celebrating and per∣forming all other Exercises and Ministeries of Priests; all which they thought they might do lawfully by virtue of a Licence granted by their Prelates, who notwithstanding they prohibited them to Marry upon pain of Excommunication, and had declared them Excommunicate, did nevertheless Absolve them for a sum of Money, or upon some Simonaical contract; so that not∣withstanding that Excommunication, they did all Marry and continued in Wedlock, reckoning themselves safe in Conscience upon their having obtained a Licence after such a manner: All which being detested by the Synod as the inven∣tions of the Devil, and devised by the covet∣ousness

 of Schismaticks, and desiring to restore this Church to its due purity, and the usage of the 
Roman
 Church, doth command, in virtue of obedience and upon pain of Excommunication 
latae Sententiae,
 that henceforward no Clerk in Holy Orders presume to Marry, nor shall any 
Cassanar
 Marry any such, nor shall any presume to be present at any such Marriage, nor give Council, Favour, or Assistance thereunto: And whoever shall offend in any of these particulars, must know that they are Excommunicate and Cursed, and are to be declared as such by the Church; and as to those who are already Mar∣ried, the Synod suspends them all, whether Married once or oftner, from the Ministery of their Orders, and all Sacerdotal Acts, until such time as they have put away their Wives effectu∣ally, which is what the Synod intreats them in the Lord to do: And to those who have been twice Married, or have Married Widows, or Women that were publickly dishonest, the Synod doth command all such as being 
Bigamists,
 and having Married contrary to their consciences, as it appears several of them have done, by their giving over thereupon to Celebrate, notwith∣standing their having obtained a Licence from their Bishop, in virtue of obedience and upon pain of being declared Excommunicate, so soon as this Decree shall come to their knowledge, to turn off the said Women, not only as to Bed and Board, but so as not to dwell in the same House with them; declaring, that until they

 have done it they are in 
Mortal
 Sin, and do live in Concubinate, such Marriages having never been true or valid; but on the contrary, void and of no force: neither can any Prelate or Bishop grant Licences in such cases, having no Authority to do it, by reason of its being con∣trary to the Rules of the Church, that have been always punctually observed, and contrary to the Holy general Councils received all over the World; and as to those who have been but once Married, the Synod will consult the most Holy Pope and Bishop of 
Rome,
 that he as Prelate and Head of the whole Church of God, and Master and Doctor of the same, may teach and command what ought to be done therein, and whatsoever his 
Holiness
 shall ordain, shall be punctually observed.






Decree XVII.


THe Synod doth declare, That those Priests who as obedient Sons shall follow the ad∣vice of the Synod in turning away their Wives, may, after they have so done, continue in the exercise of their Functions; and if not other∣wise hindered, may Celebrate, notwithstanding they have been twice Married, or may have Married Widows, since by such Weddings not being true Marriages, they did not incurr the irregularity of Bigamy: All which the Synod grants out of pure Grace, being extreamly de∣sirous to have them turn away such Women, and

 out of respect to their Ignorance, and the Cheat that was put upon them by their Prelates, who instead of instructing them better, granted them Licences: And whereas all Priests that Mar∣ry are Irregular, according to the Holy Canons, the most 
Illustrious Metropolitan
 by the Ordina∣ry, as well as the Apostolical Authority, that he has in this Church by reason of the 
See
's being vacant, doth dispense with the Priests and all the other Clergy-men in Holy Orders that shall yield obedience to the Synod, in turning away their Wives, and shall desire to continue to offi∣ciate, as to the said irregularity which they have incurred, granting them Licence as to this free∣ly and without scruple, to exercise their Orders.






Decree XVIII.


WHereas the Wives of Priests who are cal∣led 
Catatiaras
 or 
Cassaneiras,
 have not only the most Honourable place in the Church for their being such, and are the more reveren∣ced, but do moreover partake of the profits of the Churches wherein their Husbands ministred equally with the surviving Priests, and have sometimes a greater share of them than any of the Priests, by reason of the Seniority and Prehe∣minence that their Husbands had in the Church; therefore the Synod doth ordain, That such of them as do not from henceforward depart from their Husbands, shall receive no such benefit: but if obeying the admonition of the Synod

 they shall leave their Husbands, they shall then immediately receive their proportion as an Alms to help to sustain them and their Families, and shall injoy the same place and Honour in the Church, and every where else which they did before.






Decree XIX.


THe Synod doth declare, That notwithstan∣ding it has received the Holy Council of 
Trent,
 with all its Decrees, relating both to the good Government of the Church and Man∣ners, nevertheless that what was declared therein relating to Priests Bastards, not being permitted to Minister in the same Church, wherein the Fathers have Ministered before, is not to be extended to the Sons of the Married Priests in this Dio∣cess that are now born, by reason of the great numbers there are of such at present in all Churches, and of other great inconveniencies that would follow thereupon; it is therefore permitted to such to Minister, nay to be Vicars of the Churches wherein their Fathers have offi∣ciated; but this is to be understood of such only as were born of Marriages, that were reputed true, the provision of the forementioned Holy Council being to take place, as to all that shall be born hereafter.








Decree XX.


WHereas the sin of
 
Simony
 is one of the greatest offences in the Church, and a per∣nicious plague therein, which God has always punished with great rigour, it being the selling of Spiritual things for Money; and this Bishop∣rick,

 which the Synod takes notice of with great regret, having hitherto abounded with it, Mo∣ney having been publickly taken for the ad∣ministration of the Holy Sacraments, and after such a manner that none of them were given, before the Money was either put into the Priest's hands, or into the Church Box, to be divided among them, no, not so much as the Holy Sacra∣ment of the Eucharist, at which all pious Ears do tremble, nor any other Sacraments or Dispen∣sations for Marriages, nor Absolutions from Ex∣communication, nor the Consecrations of Stones, nor any of the lesser Orders, nor Licences, nor 
Reverenda's,
 to go to receive those Orders in a∣nother place, nor Letters Dimissory for Clerks, to go to other Diocesses; all which was done at a Rated Price, or by a Publick Agreement: All which the Sydod detesting as a most execrable and horrid abomination, doth therefore in virtue of Holy Obedience, and upon pain of Excom∣munication to be 
ipso facto
 incurred, command, That no Money, nor nothing else, be taken for any of the foresaid things; and that no Priests shall dare to take any thing for the administra∣tion of any of the Sacraments, nor to give them upon any such consideration to any Person what∣soever, but shall give the Holy Sacrament 
gratis
 to the Faithful, according to the Precept of our Lord Christ, who said, 
Freely you have received, freely you shall give;
 neither shall they so much as receive Alms that the Faithful would give voluntarily, though not given with any respect

 to the Sacrament, if offered at the same time when the Sacrament is administred: And the Priest that shall be found to transgress herein, besides being Excommunicated, shall be suspen∣ded from his Office and Benefice for three Years, and the Vicars must take care to advertise the People thereof. The Synod being more∣over informed, That a great many poor People who live in the 
Heaths,
 do not bring their Chil∣dren to be Baptized, because they have not so much Money as is demanded, doth order the Priest to be satisfied with the profits arising from the Dead, the Alms they receive for their 
Masses,
 in which the Synod declares there is nothing of Simony; but only a congruous maintenance for the Priest that Celebrates, given by the Person that he recommends, and with the other Alms which the Faithful are accustomed to give; which being Just and Holy, shall be divided af∣ter the same manner as they have been former∣ly: And the Synod doth declare further, That such as are absolved from Excommunication, if it was for any great Crime that they were under that Censure, though there can be nothing taken for their Absolution, yet for the Fault that they have committed, they may, by way of Punishment, be Condemned in a Pecuniary Mulct, if Autho∣rized by the Prelate, which Money must be put to some Pious use, or employed in the building of a Church; and the Offender being Poor, he may be employed in Person to do some work about a Church, for so long as shall be thought

 fit, and in that Case no Money shall be required of him.






Decree XXI.


THe Synod desiring by all means possible to destroy and root out of this Diocess the pernicious Vice of 
Simony,
 which it understands to have been encreased in part by the want the Ministers of the Church are in of a necessary maintenance, doth therefore most earnestly en∣treat the People of this Bishoprick to apply a certain Yearly Summ to be raised by the way of Alms, Collection, or Assessment, or by the way of Tithes, according to Peoples Abilities; for the support of the Vicar and Curate of their Souls, and the other Ministers that are necessary to the Divine Service in the Church, which the most 
Reverend Metropolitan
 may treat about in every Parish; for they must know, that Chri∣stians are bound both by Divine and Humane Laws to maintain the Priests which pray to God for them, and give Spiritual Food to their Souls, of which they are to render an account to God and their Prelates.






Decree XXII.


THat this Synod may by all ways possible sup∣ply the Necessities of the Ministers of the Church, and by that means extirpate 
Simony;
 besides what it desires the People to contribute

 towards their maintenance, understanding their Poverty to be such, that they are not able to sup∣ply them with so much as is necessary, it doth further beseech his Catholick 
Majesty,
 the King of 
Portugal,
 that as Protector of the Christians of these parts, and the only Christian King and Lord in the 
Indies,
 he would be graciously pleased to provide the Vicars of this Church with a sufficient Maintenance, as he does in all the other Church∣es of the 
Indies,
 allowing them at least fifteen thousand 
Cruzado's
 to be divided among them all, besides what shall be gathered for them in their respective Parishes; which as the Synod is informed, is the Summ that was formerly desi∣red of his Majesty in the third Provincial Coun∣cil of 
Goa,
 in order to the reducing of this Church to the Obedience of the Church of 
Rome,
 and the extirpating of 
Simony.
 The Synod doth moreover intreat the most 
Illustrious Metropolitan
 to present this their Petition to his Majesty, in the Name of this Church, representing therewith the great Necessities of the Ministers thereof, and that until such time as they shall have his Ma∣jesty's Answer, the said Lord Archbishop, Metro∣politan of this Church, and President of the Synod, 
Dom fray Aleixo de Menezes,
 understanding how effectual a course this will be for the rooting the Pestilential Sin of 
Simony
 out of this Diocess, and for the tying of Vicars to their Churches, there to govern the Faithful, and administer the Holy Sacraments to them, would be pleased to give the said Summ of fifteen thousand 
Cruzado's


 Yearly out of his own Revenues, and to pay it Quarterly at 
Goa,
 to be divided among the said Vicars, the distribution whereof the Synod or∣ders to be made in all Churches according to the Allotments, in the Instrument passed, and signed and sealed by the said Lord Arch-bishop, under the Great Seal of his Chancery, every Church being to receive so much, as was now read in the presence of the whole Synod.






Decree XXIII.


WHereas this Diocess is not only provided with a sufficient number of Clergy, but has a great many more than are necessary, and the Holy Council of 
Trent
 having prohibited that any more should be ordained than what are necessary for the Churches, the Synod doth therefore command, that during the vacancy of this 
See,
 none shall be put into
 Holy Orders, neither shall any 
Reverenda's,
 or Licences be granted for that purpose, such only as are in Holy Orders may go ascending therein, as the Governour, who is to be left in this Diocess by the most 
Illustrious Metropolitan
 shall judge convenient: The Synod doth also put such as do aspire to Priests Holy Orders in mind of not fail∣ing to learn the Doctrine of the Sacraments, and the Form of Sacramental Absolution, so as to

 be ready to use them on all occasions, and in all Cases of Necessity, as also the absolution from Censures, or at least the Conditional one, which always goes before the Sacramental Absolution from Sins in Confession.








The Doctrine of the Sacrament of 
Matrimony.


THe seventh Sacrament is that of 
Matrimo∣mony,
 which according to the Apostle is the signification of that Union which is betwixt Christ and his Church. The efficient Cause of Matrimony regularly, is the Consent of both par∣ties declared by Words or Signs 
de praesenti.
 This Sacrament our Lord Jesus Christ Founded on the Matrimonial Contract, which has always been in the World, and in all Religions, from whence it is that Matrimony is to be considered in two respects; either as a Natural Contract, or as a Sacrament instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ: The Bond of Matrimony God hath made to be perpetual, insomuch that it cannot be dissolved by any thing but Death, according to what Christ said, 
Whom God hath joined let no Man put asunder;
 which is also in it self very con∣venient. As it is a Sacrament, there is Grace re∣ceived therein, as in other Sacraments, our Lord Christ, who was the Author and Institutor of the Divine Sacraments, having by his Passion merited Grace for us, whereby the Natural Love which is betwixt the Married couple is perfect∣ed, and the conjunction that is betwixt them is

 confirmed, and made Perpetual, and the Hus∣band and Wife are Sanctified. There are two Reasons or Ends for which Matrimony was or∣dained and instituted; the first and principal is the Procreation or Generation of Children, for the conservation of the World, and the multi∣plication of the Faithful, and Servants of God. The second is, for a remedy for Uncleanness; and that such as are inclined to that Vice, might have a remedy given them by God, so that li∣ving with their Wives, they might not fall into that Sin, from whence it is that People may not only Marry once, but as often as one of the Parties dies, because this end of Matrimony may not only be compassed in the first, but equally in the subsequent Marriages; wherefore the Church detests those as Hereticks, who condemn second Marriages, holding them to be unlawful; as some Hereticks did anciently; and as some of the most Superstitious Heathens do at this day in these Parts; from whence it may also be collected, that this Sacrament may not only be lawfully ce∣lebrated betwixt Persons capable of having Chil∣dren, but also betwixt those, who according to the ordinary course of Nature, cannot have any, because the second end may be answered in such Marriages; but where neither the one nor the other end can be answered, as in Children, for whom the Church has set a certain time, and in such as are under a Natural Impotency that will last as long as they live, as to Matrimonial Acts, Matrimony is not to be celebrated: And

 tho' both under the Law of Nature and of 
Moses,
 there were Dispensations whereby Matri∣mony was made to deviate from its first Origi∣nal, some of the Patriarchs having had several Wives at once by a Divine Dispensation, and the Law of 
Moses
 having permitted Divorces, or the repudiating of Wives, yet under the Evan∣gelical Law, by which Matrimony was perfected and restored again to its first Estate and Purity, it is prohibited for a Man to have more than one Wife at a time, and to turn away his Wife and take another so long as she lives. The Be∣nefits of Marriage are three principally; the first is the Generation and Education of Chil∣dren for the Worship and Service of the true God; the second is the Fidelity which the Mar∣ried couple ought to keep to one another; and the third is the Perpetuity of Matrimony, which, in that it cannot be dissolved, signifies that in∣separable Conjunction and Union that is betwixt Christ and his Church: And notwithstanding for the cause of Fornication or Adultery, it is law∣ful for the Married couple to part as to Coha∣bitation, yet it is not lawful to Marry with any other, because the Bond of Matrimony, being once lawfully tied, is Perpetual, and cannot be dissolved by any thing but the death of one of the Parties.






Decree I.


HOly Mother Church has always so ordered the celebration of 
Matrimony,
 as to make it to be understood to be a Holy thing, and that as Holy, it ought to be Holily treated; where∣fore for the removing of several inconveniencies, and those especially that attend Clandestine Mar∣riages, she has ordained and commanded, that 
Matrimony
 be celebrated in the face of the Church by the Vicar, or Parish-Priest, or some other Priest, Licensed by him or the Prelate, and in the presence of two or three Witnesses at least; and that all Marriages that are not celebrated with this Solemnity by the Parish-Priest before two Witnesses, are void and null: And that the Priest, who without leave from the Parish-Priest, and the Parish-Priest who without two Witnesses shall presume to Marry any couple, shall be severely punished. Now the Synod under∣standing that this Rule is not observed in this Diocess, but that the Persons who are to be mar∣ried do imploy any Priest, and are married where they please, from which great Inconveniencies and Disorders do many times follow, different Rites and Ceremonies being also used in divers places in the celebration thereof, doth command, that all that is above related be punctually ob∣served according to the Decrees of the Holy Council of 
Trent,
 which has been received by this Church in this Synod; declaring all Marri∣ages

 not celebrated in this Form, or not by the Parish-Priest before two Witnesses, to be null, and the Parties not to be Married, neither are they to be permitted to live together as Man and Wife: And the Priests who shall presume to Marry without leave from the Parish-Priest or 
Ordinary,
 shall be suspended from their Orders and Benefices for one Year without Indulgence, and the Marriage shall be declared void, and the Parties shall be obliged to Marry again in the foresaid Form. The Synod doth furthermore declare, That the Contracted may be Married by the Parish-Priest of either of the Parties, tho' the ordinary Custom is to be Married by the Parish-Priest where the Woman lives.






Decree II.


WHereas 
Matrimony
 ought to be celebrated with words signifying a present Consent, and in many places of this Diocess, it is com∣monly celebrated with words signifying only a Consent for the time to come: Therefore the Synod doth command, That when the Persons that are to be Married, come to the Door of the Church, the Parish-Priest, or some other Priest, having his or the Prelates Licence, being in his 
Surplice,
 with his 
Stole,
 and at least two Wit∣nesses present, shall ask them, if they are pleased to Marry; and if they say they are, or express their Consent by some other evident signs, the Priest then shall take one end of his 
Stole,
 and

 laying it on the Palm of his left Hand, shall take the right Hand of the Bride and lay it on the 
Stole,
 and lay the Palm of the right Hand of the Bridegroom on the Palm of the right Hand of the Bride, in form of a Cross, and covering both their Hands with the other end of the 
Stole,
 and laying his own right Hand upon all, so that the Hands of both Parties, and both the ends of the 
Stole
 are betwixt the Priest's Hands; after having blessed them with the sign of the Cross, he shall say, 
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen;
 and shall make the Bride say first, 
I
 N. 
receive thee
 N. 
for my lawful Husband, so as the Holy Mother Church of
 Rome 
doth command;
 and shall afterwards make the Bridegroom say the same words, 
I
 N. 
receive thee
 N. 
for my lawful Wife, so as the Holy Mother Church of
 Rome 
doth com∣mand;
 and after they have both said these words, the Priest shall say, 
I, by the Authority I have, do join you in Matrimony in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen;
 after which he shall sprinkle them both with Holy Water, saying, 
By this sprinkling of Holy Water the Lord give you Health and Blessing, Amen.
 And if neither of the Parties was ever Married be∣fore, they shall then be carried before the Hig
 Altar, where being upon their Knees, the Pries
 shall give them the Blessings, as they are in th
 
Roman
 Ceremonial of the administration of th
 Sacraments, which is to be translated into 
Syria
 and to be used in all Churches; but if eithe


 of the Parties have been Married before, he shall not then give them the said Blessings, but dismiss them, after having said a Prayer in the Church.






Decree III.


THat there may be no Frauds in Matrimony, and that the Impediments, which, if they were known, would hinder the same, may be discovered; and that in all things we may con∣form our selves to the Decrees of the Holy Coun∣cil of 
Trent,
 the Synod doth command, That what is ordained by the said Holy Council, be punctually observed; to wit, That the Par∣ties to be Married, shall have their Banns pub∣lished by the Vicar, or by one appointed by him, on three 
Sundays
 or Holy-days in the Churches where the Bridegroom and Bride live, when the People are assembled at 
Mass,
 in this Form; N. 
born in such a place, does purpose to Marry
 N. 
the Daughter of
 N. 
and
 N. 
born in such a place; wherefore if there be any that know any Impedi∣ment, they must declare it upon pain of Excommu∣nication:
 And the Vicar, in case he has any lawful Impediment declared unto him, shall not Marry the Parties before he has made the Pre∣late acquainted therewith, that so he may de∣termine what is just to be done therein; which Publications cannot be dispensed with by any but by the Prelate, or one representing him: And in case it is probable that if such Publi∣cations

 are made, there are those that will ma∣liciously endeavour to hinder the Marriage, tho' in such a case the parties may be received with∣out them, yet for the better discovery of other Impediments that may happen to be therein, they cannot be joined together, nor receive the Bles∣sings, tho' capable thereof, before the publicati∣ons are made in the Churches, without the Pre∣late should be pleased to dispense therewith, to whose Prudence and Judgment the Holy Coun∣cil of 
Trent
 has committed the whole of this Matter, and the Priest who shall receive any couple without a License from the Prelate, be∣fore such publications have been made, shall be suspended from his Office and Benefice for six months.






Decree IV.


THis Synod conforming it self in all things to the Holy Council of 
Trent,
 doth com∣mand that in every Parish there be a Book, as was ordered as to 
Baptism,
 wherein the Vicar of the Church shall write the Names of the Mar∣ried Persons, and the Place, day of the Month, and Year, and the Names of the two Witnesses commonly called the 
Padrinhos,
 where they were Married, registring them thus, 
On such a Day of such a Month and Year, I
 N. 
Vicar of the Church,
 naming the Saint to whom it is dedica∣ted, 
in such a part,
 naming where the said Church is, 
did joyn
 N, 
the Son of
 N, 
and
 N. 
to
 N. 
the

 Daughter of
 N. 
and of
 N. 
born in such a place, both at the gate of the Church according to the Holy Coun∣cil of
 Trent, 
the Witnesses were
 N. 
and
 N. to which the Vicar and the two Witnesses shall sign their Names, and when any Priest shall by a License from the Vicar, or Prelate, marry any couple, he shall write, 
On such a day of such a Month, and Year, I
 N. 
a Priest, by a License from the Vicar of such a place, or from the Bishop,
 if he granted the Li∣cense, 
did receive at the gate of the Church
 N. na∣ming him, 
the Son of
 N. 
and
 N. naming his Pa∣rents, 
born in such a place,
 naming the Town ac∣cording to the Holy Council of 
Trent, the Wit∣nesses were
 N. 
and
 N. to which the said two Witnesses and Priest shall put their Names; which Book shall be kept among the Registers of the Church, and the Prelate at his Visitations shall see that there be no fault or neglect there∣in.






Decree V.


AS Holy 
Matrimony
 is a Sacrament, and as such conveys Grace, it ought therefore to be received with great Purity and Holiness, where∣fore this Synod conforming it self to the Holy Council of 
Trent,
 doth exhort and admonish, and command all that are to be Married, that at least three days before the celebration of this Sacra∣ment, they do confess themselves, and being ca∣
able do receive the Holy Sacrament of the 
Eu∣
harist
 neither shall the Vicars receive them be∣fore

 they have complyed with this Obligation, concerning which they shall make diligent En∣quiry. The Synod doth furthermore command, That all Marriages be celebrated in the Church, and that the Parish-Priest do not accommodate himself to the negligence of those who do not care to be seen to marry in the Church; but declaring withall that wheresoever Matrimony is celebra∣ted, if it be done by a Parish-Priest, and in the presence of two Witnesses, it is true and valid, tho' the Parish-Priest ought not to Marry any out of the Church, but upon very urgent Rea∣sons.






Decree VI.


THere have been always in the Church, even under the Old Law prohibited degrees of Kindred, within which Matrimony was not to be celebrated, and being celebrated, was null; and that not only as to such as were prohibited by a Divine Natural Law, as betwixt Persons in the first degree, and betwixt Brothers and Sisters, but as to others also who are prohibited by a Divine posi∣tive Law; wherefore the Synod doth declare, that the degrees at this time prohibited in the Church, without which 
Matrimony
 cannot be celebrated without a Dispensation, and being celebrated, is void, are only to the fourth de∣gree inclusive of Consanguinity, and of Affinity only to the second degree, as first Cousins, se∣cond Cousins, third Cousins, fourth Cousins, by

 Father and Mother, and the same degrees are prohibited in the Kindred of Affinity, betwixt the Kinsfolk of the Husband and Wife, with whom either of the Parties have been Married; and besides, that the Kindred in the first and se∣cond degree only with such, or of those with whom either of the Parties have at any time had unlawful Carnal Knowledge, beyond which de∣grees there are no other of Carnal Kindred that can hinder 
Matrimony,
 but in all these that have been mentioned, all Marriages that are made, are null, and of no force, and all those that have Married so, do live in the 
Mortal
 Sin of foul For∣nication: but if any upon just and reasonable accounts shall desire to Marry within any of these degrees that are prohibited only by a positive Law, they must have
 recourse to the Holy Apo∣stolick

 See for a Dispensation, or to their Pre∣late, having power from the said 
See
 to do it, declaring the degree of Kindred wherein they desire to be dispensed, together with the Causes why they do desire it, in which the Prelate shall do what he shall judge convenient in the Lord, and so the Prelate being impowered by the Ho∣ly 
See
 to do it, shall do it 
gratis,
 without taking any thing for the dispensation, tho' the Parties of their own accord should offer to pay him for it.






Decree VII.


BEsides the Carnal Kindred of Consanguinity and Affinity, which hinders 
Matrimony
 in certain degrees, there is also another sort of Kin∣dred that does the same, which is called Spiri∣tual Kindred, and is contracted in 
Baptism
 be∣twixt the Godfather and Godmother, and the Child that is Baptized, and the Parents of the said Child, and in 
Confirmation
 or 
Chrism
 betwixt those who offer and present the Person that is confirmed, as was ordered in the Decrees of 
Baptism
 and 
Confirmation;
 which Spiritual Kin∣dred of Godfathers and Godmothers, and Gos∣sips, does so hinder the celebration of 
Matrimo∣ny,
 that without a Dispensation from the Apo∣stolick 
See,
 or from some authorized by the Pope to that purpose, the 
Matrimony
 is null, and of no force, all that live therein living in Fornica∣tion, and a state of Damnation; and if any that

 are thus a kin have a mind to marry together, they shall preferr a Petition, as they shall be di∣rected hereafter, but are to know that the Church does very seldom or never, but for weighty Cau∣ses dispense in Cases of Spiritual Affinity.






Decree VIII.


WHereas hitherto the prohibited degrees, and the reservation of dispensing with the same to the Apostolical 
See,
 has not been under∣stood in this Diocess, the Prelates thereof having dispensed in all degrees, prohibited only by a positive Law, without having had Authority for what they did, so that great numbers by virtue of such Dispensations, have lived many Years in a Married Estate, without any scruple concern∣ing what was granted by their Prelates; for which reason the Synod for the greater security of the Consciences of such People has thought fit that the most 
Reverend Metropolitan
 should dispense with them in all the said degrees, by virtue of the Apostolick Authority granted to him in these parts to that effect, and particular∣ly by the brief of 
Gregory
 the XIII. of glorious Memory, obtained at the instance of the 
Jesuits,
 and confirmed by our Holy Father 
Clement
 the VIII, at this time presiding in the Church of God; wherefore for the quieting of the Consci∣ences of such as have been Married with the forementioned Dispensations, the said Lord with the approbation of the Fathers of the Society,

 doth by the Authority of the said Brief, effectu∣ally dispense in all and every one of the said degrees of Spiritual as well as Carnal Kindred and Affinity, which are prohibited only by a po∣sitive Law, and with all Persons who have Mar∣ried within the same with such dispensations so far as of right can or ought to be done, as much as if they were here particularly named; com∣manding them for the further security of their Consciences to be
 Married again privately in their Houses, or elsewhere, as they shall judge most convenient, by any Priest they please, there being two Witnesses present, according to the form of the Holy Council of 
Trent:
 And the Synod doth command that henceforward such Dispensations be not granted any otherwise than in form of the Briefs of the Holy Apostolick 
See
 in these parts to that effect, declaring all that shall be granted otherwise to be null, and of no force; and the Marriages that are celebrated by virtue of them, to be void, and the Parties not to be Married.








Decree IX.


THe Synod recognizing for the time to come the ancient prohibition, observed in the Universal Church of not Marrying, from the first day of 
Advent
 until the 
Epiphany,
 and from 
Ash∣wednesday
 until the 
Sunday
 of the 
Octaves
 of 
Ea∣ster
 inclusive, doth command the same to be in∣violably observed in this Diocess, adding to those days the time from 
Quinquagesima Sunday
 forward when by ancient custom 
Lent
 is begun in this Church, but that at all other times, tho' of Fast∣ing, marriage may be celebrated as People shall think fit.






Decree X.


VVHereas in this Diocess there has hitherto been no respect had in the celebration of 
Matrimony
 to the Age of the Parties that the Law appoints, therefore the Synod doth com∣mand, that no Man shall be Married hereafter, until he has attained the Age of fourteen Years at least, nor no Woman before she is full twelve, declaring that herein the Prelates have no power to dispense, but can only, if any that are under that Age should pretend to marry, judge in their Consciences whether they are ripe for 
Matrimo∣ny,
 and judging them to be so, may grant them a License, and dispense with their marrying; nevertheless, for several just respects, and the

 greater security of Peoples Consciences, and to re∣move as far as is possible for the Synod to do it, the imitations of the marriages that are so much in use among the Heathens, who marry people very young, there being also great numbers in this Diocess who have been married at nine or ten Years old, or under, the Synod will not have the said Dispensation or Anticipation of time to exceed four months as to men, and six as to Women; nor to be granted by any but the Bishop; and if any man hereafter shall pre∣sume to marry without such a Dispensation, be∣fore he has attained the Age of fourteen, or any Woman while she is under twelve, all such mar∣riages shall be void, but may be resolved into Contracts 
de futuro,
 and the Priests that shall marry any such, shall be suspended from their Office and Benefice, for six months, and the Par∣ties shall be kept asunder until they are of a due Age.






Decree XI.


THe Synod being informed, that great num∣bers of married people in this Diocess do, without any sentence of the Church, (to which all Matrimonial causes do belong) forsake their Wives, and, to the great offence of God, ab∣sent themselves from them for a long time toge∣ther, doth command that there be no such sepa∣rations made without the order of the Church, and if any shall presume to make them, that

 they be constrained to come together again, up∣on pain of Excommunication, or whatsoever o∣ther Penalty the Bishop shall think fit to inflict; and in case they refuse to comply, they shall be declared Excommunicate, until such time as they return to one another; and in case they have any just Cause to separate, they shall carry it before the Prelate to be Judged according to Law, and what is Just, and shall be obliged by Censures to stand to his last determination. The Synod doth furthermore declare, That the non-payment of the Portion that may have been promised, is no just Cause to leave their Wives, which they might have been careful to have secured before they were Married to them; and that whoso∣ever shall forsake their Wives on that account, shall be punished and constrained by Excom∣munication to live with them.






Decree XII.


THe Synod being informed that the Black Slaves that are Christians, and even such of them as live in the Mountains with Christians, do Marry without a Priest, by only tying a Thred about the Brides Neck, according to the usage of the Heathens, doth declare, That all such Marriages are void and null, and that all that live so, do live in Uncleanness; commanding all that have been so Married, to be brought to the Church, there to be Married by the Vicar, according to the Form of the Holy 
Trent
 Council,

 and as is above ordered. The Vicars must take pains to inform themselves of the Marriages of all such Slaves, in order to make them observe the said Decree inviolably; and the Masters who have consented that their Slaves or Servants should be thus Married, and have celebrated such Marriages themselves, and shall not send them to Church to be Married, tho' they desire it, shall be severely punished at the pleasure of the Prelate, and shall be told of the great wrong they do to their own Consciences therein, and of the Scandal they give to Christianity.






Decree XIII.


THe Synod being informed that some of the Christians of the Mountains have been Married to several Women in the face of the Church, their first Wife being still alive, to the great affront and injury of the Holy Sacra∣ment of 
Matrimony;
 doth command all Vicars and Curates at their first institution into their Churches, immediately to make strict enquiry into this Matter, and to force all such to live with their first Wives; and, in case they refuse, to declare them Excommunicate, until such time as they comply, and do turn away all their other Wives, removing them from the place where they live, which shall be done to all, who du∣ring the life of their first Wife have presumed to take others until they shall be brought to live only with the first; and besides, they shall

 be punished with other punishments at the plea∣sure of the Prelate, or of the Holy Office of
 
Inquisition
 to which this doth belong.






Decree XIV.


WHereas it is a thing unworthy of a Chri∣stian to observe the Superstitious Cere∣monies of the Heathens, from whence it is ima∣gined good Success may be derived, the Synod being informed that there are some ill Christians, that, in imitation of the Heathens, do go to some of them, and others to some of their own Su∣perstitious Priests, to learn which are the best Days and Hours to be Married on, after the manner of the 
Infidels;
 and do furthermore on their Wedding-day make certain Circles, into which they put Rice, and certain Persons using several Superstitious Ceremonies, which are plain∣ly Heathen; and do moreover make certain Figures behind their Doors to make their Marri∣age Fortunate, and use several Prayers with Ce∣remonies,

 which they call the 
Ring of Solomon;
 all which being Devilish, Superstitious, and Hea∣thenish Ceremonies, condemned by Holy Mo∣ther Church: Wherefore the Synod doth com∣mand and exhort all Faithful Christians, neither to practise any such Ceremonies themselves, nor to suffer others to use them in their Houses; and that all who shall presume to practise them them∣selves, or permit others to do it in their Houses, shall be denied the Sacrament for a whole Year, and be rigorously punished at the pleasure of the Prelate: and the same shall be done to those that go to Heathens, to learn what Days are Fortunate.






Decree XV.


THe Synod having been informed, that when Contracts 
de futuro
 are celebrated among the Christians of this Diocess, or Marriages are concerted, that it is performed with some Hea∣thenish and Superstitious Ceremonies, and that many times when the Parties contracted are not of Age, or have not Judgment enough to give their consent, doth command, that no such Con∣tracts be made, but when the Parties contracting are of sufficient Age to understand what they do, and are capable of giving their consent 
de futuro;
 and, if the Parents will make such Matches, they shall do it by a simple Writing, or by shaking Hands, or by any other way that has nothing of Superstition in it; neither shall they

 use any Superstitious Ceremonies, upon pain of being severely chastised at the pleasure of the Prelate; commanding the Priests, in virtue of Holy Obedience, not to be present at Contracts, where any such damnable Superstitions are per∣formed, that so they may not seem to Autho∣rize them by their Person and Dignity.






Decree XVI.


THe Synod doth condemn the Custom, or abuse that has obtained in this Diocess of the new-married couple's not going to Church till after the fourth day after their Marriage, when they use to Wash themselves, which is ac∣cording to the 
Judaical
 Ceremonies condemned by the Law of Christ, but on the contrary, doth exhort all new-married People, without respect of Days, to go to Church and say their Prayers, knowing for certain, that if any of the Days that they stay from Church, should happen either to be a 
Saint's-day
 or a 
Sunday,
 upon which all People are obliged to hear 
Mass,
 that they sin mortally in not hearing it, if hindred by no o∣ther cause: Neither are they to imagine, that such Washings do any way contribute to the Spiritual Health of their Souls, the Worship of God, or the Reverence of the Church.












ACTION VIII. Of the Reformation of Church-Affairs.




Decree I.


WHereas the Universal Catholick Church is Ruled, Inspired, and Taught by the Holy Spirit, by whose direction, for the better Govern∣ment of Christians, and the more commodious administration of the Sacraments to the Faithful, it has divided the Provinces of the whole World into Diocesses, which are all subject to their several Bishops; and the Diocesses into Parishes, which are all subject to their Parish-Priests, so that as the Diocesses and all the faithful Inhabi∣tants of the same are subject to their several Bi∣shops, and through them to the Bishop of 
Rome, the Ʋniversal Pastor and Head of the Church, and Christ's Vicar upon Earth;
 so all the faithful In∣habitants in every Parish are subject to their Rector or Vicar, that administer the Sacraments to them, and are the particular Pastors and Cu∣rates of their Souls, through whom they are subject to their Bishop, and through the Bishop to the Pope, and through the Pope to Christ; which Order has been at all times preserved in the Church all over the World, and for want whereof, this Church is so Confused and Dis∣orderly as it is; every one doing what seems

 good in his own eyes, without ever being cal∣led to an Account for what they do, having none that are under any obligation to take care of their Souls, nor no particular Pastor to assist them in their Necessities, nor distinct Parishes, unto which every one is bound to resort; there∣fore this Synod conforming it self to the Govern∣ment of the whole Catholick Church, doth or∣dain, that this Diocess be also divided into Pa∣rishes, allotting such a number of People to each Parish as shall be found most convenient, and furnishing them with particular Vicars and Cu∣rates, to watch over the Souls of the Faithful; and as for other Priests and Curates that shall be in any Church, they shall be therein as Be∣neficed Persons, and Co-adjutors to the Vicars in the administration of the Sacraments to the Peo∣ple, as also in the Divine Service and Worship of the Church, as they have hitherto been, ha∣ving the same Profits and Dividend they had formerly, save that the Synod intends to deprive them of those Fees which formerly they Simo∣naically received for administration of the Sacra∣ments, as to which they shall observe what is before decreed, as the Vicars and Parish-Priests are to have what is allotted for their maintenance in the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Decrees; and the said Vicars shall make a Roll of all the Inhabitants of their several Parishes, that so they may be acquainted with their Customs and way of living, and may administer the Sacraments unto them, and comfort them in their Troubles

 and Necessities; neither shall the Faithful receive the Sacrament from any but their own Vicar, without his Licence in Form.






Decree II.


THe Synod doth declare, That the Division of Parishes, and the laying of People to them, has at all times belonged to the Prelate; so that he may at any time Divide or Unite Parishes at his pleasure, and as he shall find to be most convenient for the administration of the Sacraments to the Faithful, to whom it also be∣longs to provide Vicars and Curates for Churches, whom he may Institute or Depose as often as he shall judge it to be necessary, to the better feed∣ing of the Flock of Christ, which he is charged with, and is to give an account of; and for the present the most Reverend 
Metropolitan
 shall make such a reparition of Parishes and People in this his Visitation, Uniting or Dividing them as shall seem to him to be most commodious for the administration of the Sacraments to the Faith∣ful, who at the end of the Synod will name Vicars for every Parish: And the Synod, for the just Respects and the better Government of the Church, will not have any Vicars so Esta∣blished, as not to be removable at the pleasure of the Prelate.








Decree III.


THe Synod doth furthermore declare, That no Priest shall hold Two Churches with Cure, or receive the Fruits of them according to the Holy Canons: And whereas in this Diocess there are many that have two or three Churches, which they have had commended unto them in several parts, either because they were built by their Relations, or for some other Reason; all which being a great Abuse, the Synod doth de∣clare, That after the division of the Parishes is made, none shall have any Jurisdiction therein besides their proper Vicars, to whom only it shall belong to order all the Affairs of their Churches, and to whom whosoever shall deny to yield Obedience, shall be declared Excommunicate, and shall be punished at the pleasure of the Pre∣late as disturbers of the Church; and all such Priests as are in present possession of the Churches, if qualified, and there be no just Impediment, the Synod will have it be instituted Vicars of one of their Parishes, as the most Reverend 
Me∣tropolitan
 shall think fit; not that the Synod in∣tends to prohibit the Prelate, in case he is not provided of a sufficient number of able Priests, or where there is not a sufficient maintenance, to recommend two Churches to one Vicar, pro∣vided they are at such a distance that he can look after both, without any wrong to the administration of the Sacraments. However,

 this shall never be done, but when there is an urgent and necessary Reason for it.






Decree IV.


WHereas there are a great many Churches in this Diocess that have no Priests, to the great detriment of the Faithful, who by that means are for several Years without 
Mass,
 or any to administer the Sacraments to them, as has ap∣peared to the Reverend 
Metropolitan
 in his Visi∣tation of the Churches, in some of which he found there had been no 
Masses
 said in five or six Years, and that there are Children of that or a greater Age, that have never been Bap∣tized; therefore the Synod both command, That there be no Church that is made Parochial, how poor and inconsiderable soever the People may be, for any long time without a Curate or Vicar to administer the Sacraments to the Faith∣ful, of which the Prelate is to take special care; and if it should so happen, as it does too often, that he cannot have a Priest to supply such Cures, in that Case, the Synod declares, that the Prelate may oblige whomsoever he pleaseth, by Penal∣ties and Censures to serve such Churches, that so the Necessities of the Faithful may be pro∣vided for, giving them whereon to subsist in the said Churches.








Decree V.


THe Synod being informed that there are many Villages in this Diocess, which, by reason of their great distance from any Church, have little of Christianity left in them besides the Name of the Christians of St. 
Thomas,
 which has been occasioned through the great negligence of the former 
Schismatical
 Prelates of this Bishop∣rick; wherefore the Synod doth, in virtue of Holy Obedience, command all Priests that are nominated Vicars, so soon as they shall come to their Churches, to make a strict inquiry into the Christians that live in the Skirts of their Parishes, and to report what they shall discover as to this Matter to the most Reverend 
Metropolitan,
 that so he may take such course therein as shall be most for the Service of Christ, and the Be∣nefit of Souls; and the same diligence shall be used in all Parts, where there are such People found, and have never been Baptized, and where it is thought necessary, there shall be New Churches built, and Vicars appointed for the reducing such to true Christianity, and the use of the Holy Sacraments of the Church.








Decree VI.


WHereas the Church of 
Travancor
 is at this time totally demolished, the greater part of its Parishioners having above forty Years ago turned perfect Heathens, all which has hap∣pened through the negligence of sending Priests among them by reason of their great distance from any other Church, there being nevertheless several good Christians there still, therefore the Synod doth command, that a Vicar be forthwith collated to that place, who shall set immediate∣ly about rebuilding the Church; there shall like∣wise be some Preachers sent along with him to reduce the said People into the bosom of Holy Mother Church, and to the Holy Catholick Faith of Christ, according to the Orders given therein by the most Reverend 
Metropolitan,
 and the Vi∣car shall continue there baptizing and receiving all, according to the necessity of the Church, for which an 
Olla,
 or License has been already obtained from the King of 
Travancor,
 and shall from henceforth continue in the Church accord∣ing to the necessity thereof.






Decree VII.


THe Synod being informed, That upon the borders of the Territories belonging to the 
Samorim
 King of 
Calecut,
 at the distance of four leagues from any Church in this Bishoprick,

 there is a Country called 
Tadamalla,
 in which there are certain Villages of Christians, who were anciently of this Church, but at present have nothing of Christianity but the bare Name, doth command that Priests and Preachers be sent thither immediately from this Church to reduce them to the Catholick Faith, and baptize them, in which matter, through the diligences that have been used by the most Reverend 
Metropo∣litan,
 they will meet with no difficulties on the part of those who have lost their Christianity only for want of Instruction, and the Synod doth recommend this People, as a Member of their Church to the Spiritual Care of the most Reverend 
Metropolitan.






Decree VIII.


WHereas the use of the Holy Oils was in∣stituted by Christ in the Church, who made the Oil of 
Chrism,
 the matter of the Sacrament of 
Confirmation
 and 
Extream Ʋnction;
 and did fur∣thermore appoint other Holy Unctions for the 
Ca∣techumeni,
 delivering the Doctrine of the Consecra∣tion of such Oils in his last Supper to his Disciples, as we are taught by Holy Tradition from the Apostles and the Doctrine of the Holy Fathers of the Church, and there having notwithstanding this been no such thing in use, or known in this Church to this day: Therefore the Synod doth command, that in all Parish Churches there be a Box that shall hold three Vessels of Plate, Tin, or Glass,

 in which the Holy Oils shall be kept with due Decency and Reverence, with their several Names upon each Vessel, so that they may not be used one for another, commanding the Vicars that are to be nominated, not to go from hence without carrying these Boxes along with them, to their respective Churches, which the most Re∣verend 
Metropolitan
 will furnish them withal, and with the Holy Oils which he consecrated on Holy 
Thursday
 last for this purpose in the Church of 
Carturte
 in this Diocess, which Boxes they shall put under Lock and Key in their Repositories, either in the chief Chapel of the high Altar, or in their Vestries, or near to the Font, having them always decently covered with Silk, or in case the Vicars live at a considerable distance from their Churches, or in the 
Heaths,
 in some decent place in their Houses for fear of Infidel Robbers, and that they may be always at hand, when they shall be called to administer the Sa∣crament of 
Ʋnction,
 and whensoever they are carried to Church for Baptism, or are carried to the Sick, they shall be always carried by a Priest, if it is possible, but at least by one in Holy Orders; and upon Holy 
Thursday
 they shall either burn all the Oils that remain of that Year in the Lamps of the Church, or pour them into the Font, so as after that day not to make use of any Oils but such as are new, which af∣ter 
Easter
 they shall either go or send to the Prelate for, or to the place where he has or∣dered them to be distributed, and in case the

 
See
 be vacant, they shall then by order from the Governour of the Diocess, have recourse to the Bishop of 
Cochim,
 and the Vicars that shall neglect to go or send for the said Holy Oils for the use of their Churches, so as not to have them within a month after 
Easter,
 shall be suspended by the Prelate, who is desired to be very watch∣ful in this matter, from his Office and Benefice for six months, and be obliged to fetch them, and the Children that shall be baptized during that time, shall be anointed with the Holy Oils of Baptism when they come, neither shall the Vicars depart from hence, until they are fully instructed in the use of the Oils by Persons ap∣pointed by the Synod to teach them, that so they may not be mistaken in the administration of the Holy Sacraments.






Decree IX.


THere being a great Confusion in this Bi∣shoprick as to the Holy days that are to be kept under the Obligation of a

Also the days of the Consecration of their Churches, and the Feasts of the Saints, to whom they were Dedicated, in their own Parishes only.


The Synod doth furthermore declare, That the 
Fridays

Christmas
 to 
Lent,
 which use to be observed in some Parts, shall not be kept hereafter, the Saints that were Celebrated on some of them, having their particular Feasts; and others of them being Dedicated to Hereticks, as is above observed, whose Memories ought not to be Celebrated; and the Vicars shall not fail on 
Sundays
 at 
Mass,
 to warn the People of all the Holy-days of the Week, that so they may be advertised to keep them.






Decree X.


NOt only what Holy-days were to be kept, were uncertain, and not uniformly obser∣ved in this Bishoprick, but the same also hap∣pened to the Fasting-days, which Christians are under an obligation to keep; wherefore the Synod doth declare, that the Fasting-days, as well the Ancient ones, as those that are now commanded, are these following.


The Holy and Solemn Fast of 
Lent,
 which according to the Custom of this Bishoprick, be∣gins upon the 
Monday
 after 
Quinquagesima.


The Holy Fast of 
Advent,
 which is kept in this Bishoprick with great rigor from the

 that is next to the first of 
December,
 until 
Christmas.




The first day of

The 2d. of 
December,
 being the Vigil of the Glorious Apostle St. 
Thomas,

Nativity,
 notwithstanding these two do both fall in 
Advent.


And that this Diocess may be in all things conformable to the Customs of the Universal Church, the Synod doth command, the 
Fast of the four Times
 to be published and observed therein; they are the first 
Wednesday, Friday,
 and 
Saturday
 after the first 
Sunday
 in 
Lent;
 and the the first 
Wednesday
 and 
Friday,
 and 
Saturday
 after 
Whitsuntide;
 and the first 
Wednesday, Friday,
 and 
Saturday
 after the Feast of the 
Holy Cross,
 in 
Sep∣tember;
 and the 
Wednesday, Friday,
 and 
Saturda
 after the Feast of the 
Holy Cross,
 on the 13th. of 
December,
 which falls in with the 
Advent
 Fast.




And the Synod doth furthermore declare, That the Fast of our 
Lady's Assumption,
 which be∣gins on the first of 
August,
 and lasts to the day of the Festivity, and the Fast that is called the 
Apostles,
 which begins on the first day after 
Whit∣suntide,
 and lasts fifty days, notwithstanding they are Holy and Laudable, it wisheth they were not kept as they are by the Christians of this Diocess, after the same manner as the ancient Fasts are; nevertheless, since they are observed by some and not by others, that there may be no Scruples nor Disorder, the Synod doth de∣clare, that the keeping of them is not comman∣ded under the Precept of a 
Mortal
 Sin, though they may be kept out of Devotion by those that have a mind to't, neither are People under any obligation to a 
Lent
 Fare on these Days; and as to the three Fasting Days of the Prophet 
Jonas,
 called 
Mononebo,
 which begins eighteen days be∣fore the first day in 
Lent,
 the Synod, out of re∣spect to its Antiquity and Holiness, doth permit it to be observed with great strictness: But whereas People do assemble together in the Churches on those days, there to eat the 
Nercha's
 that are distributed, the Synod, tho' it is not willing to oblige People to Fast on those three days under the obligation of a 
Mortal
 Sin, doth nevertheless oblige them to a 
Lent
 Diet at least upon them; and the Vicars shall be obliged to give notice to the People of all the Fasts of the Week upon 
Sundays,
 that so all may be warned to observe them.








Decree XI.


THe Synod doth approve of the Holy and Laudable Custom observed by the Christians of this Diocess, of eating neither Eggs nor Cheese, nor any thing made of Milk, nor of Fish, and of abstaining totally from Wine, and from their Wives during the whole time of 
Lent;
 all which it desires them to continue to observe inviolably, as also to begin the Fast upon the day after 
Quin∣quagesima Sunday;
 and some Abuses being refor∣med, it doth declare, That Fasting doth not only consist in Peoples abstaining from some sorts of Meat, but also in their not eating so often as they may desire, the Integrity of the Precept of Fasting obliging People not to eat above one Meal a day; and that at
 an hour appointed, and at Night they that shall stand in need of

 it, and have an appetite to drink for their Healths-sake, may eat a light Collation, accor∣ding to the permission of the Church; but if they shall exceed either in the quality or quan∣tity of the said Collation, or eat oftner than twice after this manner, they do violate the Fast, and Sin Mortally; and if through infirmi∣ty or weakness, they should break the Fast up∣on any day, they shall not, as some imagine, be released by their having broke 
Lent
 once: from continuing the Fast, but on the contrary, they shall be guilty of so many 
Mortal
 Sins, as there are days of Obligation, on which they neglect to Fast: They are also bound to Fast on all the Saints days, tho' never so Solemn, that shall fall in 
Lent, Sunday
 only excepted, upon which it is not lawful for any Christian to Fast, as to which matter there are great Abuses introduced in to this Diocess.






Decree XII.


THe Synod doth declare, That notwithstan∣ding Fasting is of great benefit, that it doth not intend to oblige any that are under one and Twenty, nor such as are very ancient, or weak, or sickly, nor Women with Child, nor those that give Suck, nor those that cannot Fast con∣veniently by reason of some hard Labour they are obliged to, to Fast any otherwise than by eating a 
Lent
 Diet on Fasting-days, as to which too the weak and sick are excepted, who may

 at all times eat what is necessary to their health; and it shall also be lawful for Women with Child to eat whatsoever they long for, to pre∣vent Abortion.






Decree XIII.


THe Synod doth very much condemn what some ignorant observers of Heathenish Su∣perstition imagine, 
viz.
 That if they do not wash their Bodies betimes in the Morning on a Fast∣day, their Fast will be of no worth; and that if they happen to touch any of a base Race, or a 
Naires,
 they must wash themselves to make their Fast to be of any Merit; and declares, that all such Washings and Superstitious touches, are commanded neither by God nor the Church, and are no ways proper for Christians; and doth furthermore command the observers of all such Superstitions to be punished severely by the Pre∣late, as followers of
 Heathenish Vanities, con∣demned by Holy Mother Church, earnestly de∣siring that all such things may be totally rooted out of the hearts of the very 
Infidels
 in this Diocess.








Decree XIV.


NOtwithstanding the Synod doth approve of the laudable Custom that has obtained in this Diocess, of beginning the Holy Fast of 
Lent,
 upon the 
Monday
 following 
Quinquagessima Sun∣day:
 Nevertheless in conformity to the usage of the Universal Church, it doth ordain and com∣mand, that on the 
Wednesday
 following, they con∣secrate Ashes in the Church, which shall be sprin∣kled on the Heads of the People by the Priest that celebrates 
Mass,
 using these words, 
Remem∣ber Man that thou art dust, and that to dust thou shalt return,
 as he is directed by the 
Roman
 Ce∣remonial translated into 
Syrian,
 by the order of the most Reverend 
Metropolitan,
 leading by this Holy Ceremony the Faithful to a deeper Repen∣tance, for their Sins, and a sense of their own vileness in that Holy time; which Ashes so far as it can be done, shall be made of the branches that were blessed the former Year upon 
Palm Sunday,
 which is called 
Osana
 in this Diocess, a
 it is likewise ordered in the said Ceremonial, bu
 at the same time the People shall be told tha
 this is only a Holy Ceremony of the Church, and not a Sacrament.








Decree XV.


THat this Bishoprick may in all things be conformable to the Customs of the Ca∣tholick Church, the Synod doth command all the Members thereof upon pain of 
Mortal
 Sin, not to eat Flesh upon 
Saturdays,
 in memory of our Lord's Burial, but Eggs, Milk, Butter or Cheese they may lawfully eat upon 
Saturdays,
 as also upon all Fish days that are not Fasts, and since the custom of not eating Flesh on 
Wednes∣days
 is not observed over the whole Diocess, but only in some parts thereof, and that but by a few; the Synod doth declare, that albeit that custom is Holy and Laudable, and it were to be wished that it were universally observed by all Christians, it doth not think fit to oblige People thereunto upon pain of Sin, so that all that list may eat Flesh upon 
Wednesdays.






Decree XVI.


THe Synod doth declare, That the Obligati- of not eating Flesh on prohibited days, lasts from midnight to midnight, beginning at the midnight of the prohibited day, and ending at the midnight of the day following, so that the Obligation of not eating Flesh upon 
Frydays
 and 
Saturdays,
 begins at the midnight of 
Fry∣day,
 and ends on the midnight of 
Sunday,
 and the Obligation of ceasing from labour begins at

 the midnight of the said day, and ends at the midnight of 
Monday:
 being to understand that in beginning the Fasts and Festivities on the Even∣ing of the former, and continuing them to the Evening of the latter day, they do conform themselves to the Customs and Rites of the 
Jews
 condemned by Holy Mother Church, in which days and their observances are not reckoned from Evening to Evening, but from midnight to midnight.






Decree XVII.


WHereas it is the Custom of the Universal Church, to have
 Holy Water at the entrance of the Churches, that so the Faithful by sprinkling themselves therewith, may have their 
Venial
 Sins pardoned, and the Holy Water that has been hitherto made use of in this Dio∣cess has not been blessed by the Priest, nor by any Prayer of the Church, the 
Sextons
 only throwing a little of the Clay into it, that is brought by Pilgrims from the Sepulchre of St. 
Thomas,
 or from some other Holy Place relating to him, and where such Clay has been wanting, the said 
Sextons
 have thrown some Grains of Incense into it: Whereupon without any further Consecrati∣on, it has been esteemed Holy: Therefore the

 Synod doth declare, that such Water is not Ho∣ly, and that the Faithful ought not to make use of it; and albeit that all the Earth of Holy places, and of the Sepulchres of Saints approved of by the Church, ought to be kept with much Veneration, yet that the Earth of the Holy places belonging to St. 
Thomas,
 has not the vir∣tue of such a Consecration in it: for which rea∣son it commands all Priests to bless the said Wa∣ter, by throwing Holy Salt into it, according to the custom of the Universal Church, as is di∣rected by the 
Roman
 Ceremonial translated into 
Syrian
 by the order of the most Reverend 
Me¦tropolitan,
 according to the Form whereof the true Vicars shall take care to consecrate Water, and every 
Saturday
 Evening, or 
Sunday
 Morning to furnish the Water-pots therewith; and upon 
Sun∣days
 the People being assembled, the Priest being in his 
Surplice
 and 
Stole,
 but without his 
Planet,
 shall before he begins 
Mass,
 sprinkle the whole Congre∣gation, repeating the 
Antiphona,
 and the Prayer contained in the said Ceremonial: and at 
Masses
 at which the Deacon and Sub-Deacon officiate, the Deacon may repeat the 
Antiphona,
 but the Prayer shall always be said by the Priest. The Vicars must also instruct the People at their entring into the Church, to take Holy Water and bless them∣selves therewith, in the form of a Cross, and to give over the saying the Prayer to the impious Heretick 
Nestorius,
 which they used to do when they took Holy Water as they entred into the Church, the Synod condemning the same as He∣retical and Blasphemous.








Decree XVIII.


WHereas the greatest part of the People of this Bishoprick are not instructed in the 
Do∣ctrine,
 and they that are, know only the 
Pater Noster,
 and 
Ave Mary
 in the 
Syrian
 Tongue, which they do not understand, and most of the Children know not how to bless themselves, nay the Clergy themselves are ignorant thereof, not being able to say the 
Commandments;
 there∣fore the Synod doth command, that in all Parish Churches in the Morning and Evening, as the Vicar shall think most convenient, one of the Boys or the Bell-man shall ring the little Bell to call the Boys and Girls together in the Church, where being assembled, the Vicar, or some o∣ther Clergyman that he shall appoint, shall in∣struct them in the 
Doctrine,
 that is to say, the 
Sign of the Cross,
 the 
Pater Noster, Ave Mary,
 the 
Creed,
 and the 
Commandments of God,
 and 
the Church,
 the 
Articles of Faith,
 and other Chri∣stian Doctrines in the 
Malabar
 Tongue, that so all may understand them, and not in the 
Syri∣an,
 which the People do not understand, it be∣ing the custom of the Church to teach the 
Do∣ctrine
 to Children, and to the People in thei
 Mother Tongue, and furthermore upon all 
Sun¦days
 and Holydays, either before or after 
Mass
 the Vicar shall teach the said 
Doctrine
 in the Congregation, that so all may be instructed there in, and shall also after having called the peopl


 together with a Bell, teach it on the Evenings of 
Sundays,
 and as for the Churches that are in the 
Heaths,
 the Vicars shall give orders that the Children, or at least such of them as are nighest to the Church, shall upon a certain day of the Week come to learn the 
Doctrine,
 employing o∣thers persons to instruct the rest therein, and the Schoolmasters that teach 
Syrian,
 or that teach to read and write, shall every day before they begin School repeat the said 
Doctrine
 to their Scholars in 
Malabar,
 neither shall any in∣ferior Orders, no not the 
first Tonsure,
 be given to Children before they can say the whole 
Do∣ctrine
 in 
Malabar,
 in which they must be exami∣ned according to the Holy Council of 
Trent,
 and in all Church s there shall be a Book of the
 
Do∣ctrine
 in the 
Malabar
 Tongue, for the instructi∣on of Children: which the Synod doth entreat the Father Rector, of the College of Jesuits of 
Vaipicotta,
 to order to be translated by some of that College, commanding all the Churches of this Diocess, as also exhorting all the Christians

 thereof at Night to cause the said 
Doctrine
 to be taught in their Houses to their whole Fami∣lies, that so their Servants and Slaves may be instructed therein, and the Confessors in their Confessions must not fail to examine their Peni∣tents in the 
Doctrine,
 and to exhort them to learn it.






Decree XIX.


THat the Faithful Christians in this Diocess may in their Common Prayer be confor∣mable to the whole Catholick Church, they must not from henceforward say the 
Ave Mary,
 as they have been taught by the Perfidious 
Nestori∣ans,
 but must say it thus, 
Ave Mary full of Grace, the Lord be with thee, blessed art thou among Wo∣men, blessed is Jesus the fruit of thy Womb; Holy Mother of God pray for us Sinners, now, and at the hour of our Death, Amen, Jesus.
 And in this form it shall be inserted into all the Prayer Books of this Diocess.






Decree XX.


VVHereas the Christians of this Diocess do not shew the least Reverence to the most Holy Name of 
Jesus
 when it is mentioned, which ariseth from the false Doctrine of the 
Nestorian
 Hereticks, who do impiously assert, That it is not worthy of Reverence, being the Name of a Humane Person, teaching falsly that there are two Per∣sons

 in Christ, therefore since that Divine Name contains in it so many Divine Mysteries, being the Name of our Redemption, and the Name above all Names, 
At which
 St. 
Paul
 saith, 
every knee in Heaven and in Earth, and below the Earth ought to bow,
 the Synod doth command, that as often either in the Gospel or Prayers of the 
Mass,
 or Offices, or any where else that that Name is mentioned, all People do reverently bow their Body, whether they be sitting or standing, and the Clergy and other Christians, having their Caps on shall take them off, and the Vicars and Preachers must not neg∣lect to put their People frequently in mind there∣of; and whereas the Name 
Lyo
 is the same with the most sweet Name of 
Jesus
 in the 
Malabar
 Language, and is commonly given to Children in Baptism; the Synod doth strictly prohibit the giving of that Name to any body for the future, commanding all that are called by it, to take another Name in Confirmation, or at any other time, it being a great irreverence for any one to be called by so high and Divine a Name.






Decree XXI.


WHereas it is necessary that the Feast of Christ's 
Nativity
 should be celebrated with great solemnity and uniformity through the whole Catholick Church; the Synod doth com∣mand that on the Eve of that Festivity, all the Clergy and People do assemble together in the Church, there to say the 
Matins,
 with the great∣est

 Solemnity possible; and that after they have done these Prayers, which shall end about Mid∣night, they shall make the customary Procession, which being over, a Solemn 
Mass
 shall be said, with all possible Festivity, after which the Priest may say a 
Mass
 at break of day, and a third at the usual time of 
Mass;
 for the Priest must know, that for the greater Solemnity of this Festival, they are permitted to say three 
Masses
 upon it, that is, one at Midnight, one at break of day, and a third at the ordinary time; or being private 
Masses,
 all three together after break of day, but being publick, shall be all said in the fore-mentioned Order; neither shall they after the first two take the 
Lavatory,
 but after having received the Blood, shall go on with the 
Mass
 without taking the 
Lavatory,
 that so they may be Fasting to celebrate the third; and they shall be very careful to have the Cups well scoured, and their Fingers washed clean with Water, which shall be preserved in a particular Vessel in order to its being afterwards either thrown into a Pond, or poured under the Altar, or into the Baptismal Water that is in the Font; and if any Priest through carelessness should in either of the two first 
Masses
 take the 
Lavatory,
 after that it shall not be lawful for him to say any more, because the 
Mass
 is not to be celebra∣ted but Fasting, which the taking of the 
Lavatory
 breaks.








Decree XXII.


THe Synod doth command, That the Priests in the solemn administration of the Sacra∣ments of 
Baptism, Matrimony,
 and 
Extream Ʋn∣ction,
 or when they administer the Holy 
Eucharist
 without the 
Mass,
 for the greater decency and reverence for what they are about, do wear a 
Surplice
 with a 
Stole
 about their Necks: And whereas hitherto there has been no such thing as a 
Surplice
 in this Bishoprick, the most Reve∣rend 
Metropolitan
 having been pleased to pro∣vide such Vestments as are necessary in this Bi∣shoprick, no Vicar shall go from hence without taking a 
Surplice
 along with him, which he is to wear in the administration of the Holy Sacra∣ments, wherein the Synod commands them like∣wise to use the Rites and Ceremonies prescribed in the 
Roman
 Ceremonial, which the said Lord 
Metropolitan
 has commanded to be translated in∣to 
Syrian
 and to be kept in all Churches, which contains the Forms of Baptizing, of Anointing the Sick, of Marrying, of Sacramental Absolution, with the customary Prayers therein; of admi∣nistring the Holy Sacrament of the Altar, of the Exorcisms of the Church, for People possessed with the Devil, the Blessings of Holy Water, of Ashes, of Chains and Branches, as also the Form of Burying the Dead, Old and Young, and of reconciling Churches and Church-Yards. Which Books being Bound, shall be kept in all Churches;

 neither shall any Priest presume to apply them to his own private use, or to take them out of the Church: And the Synod doth earnestly re∣commend it to the Rector of the College of the 
Jesuits
 of 
Vaipicotta,
 to have always some of these Books Translated by some of the said College by him, in order to the supplying of the Necessities of these Churches.






Decree XXIII.


THe Synod desiring that this Church may in all things be conformable to the Holy 
Ro∣man
 and whole 
Italian
 Church, doth command, That on the second of 
February,
 being the day of our Lady's 
Purification,
 before 
Mass,
 the Wax Candles which are in the Church, be Blest, as also all the Candles that shall be brought by the People out of Devotion, according to the 
Ro∣man
 Ceremonial, translated into 
Syrian;
 and after the publick and solemn Benediction is over, there shall be a Procession in or round the Church, in which all the Clergy shall carry Blessed Can∣dles lighted in their hands, as the People shall also do that have any, in Memory of the Mystery of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Divine Light and Splen∣dor of the Father, first entrance into the Tem∣ple, there to offer himself to his Eternal Father, cloathed with our Humanity: So likewise upon the 
Monday, Tuesday,
 and 
Wednesday
 before the Feast of our Lord's Holy 
Ascension,
 in the Mor∣ning, either before or after 
Mass,
 there shall be

 a Procession in the Church, or where the Vicar shall appoint, in which the 
Litanies
 shall be said according to the customs of the Church, which shall also be translated in the said 
Roman
 Cere∣monial, expunging the Names of all the Here∣ticks, who according to the custom of the 
Ne∣storians,
 were commemorated in this Church; and it is the desire of the Synod, that the use of the said 
Litanies
 be brought into this Church to be read in their Necessities, or when they de∣sire to implore the Divine Mercy.






Decree XXIV.


THe Synod being informed, that in the re∣mote parts of this Bishoprick, as well to∣wards the 
South,
 as towards the 
North,
 the Chri∣stians that dwell in the 
Heaths
 are guilty of Working and Merchandizing on 
Sundays
 and Ho∣ly-days, especially in the Evenings, doth com∣mand the Vicars to be very vigilant in this Matter, and to admonish and reprehend all that they shall find so doing; and if after three par∣ticular Admonitions, they shall not reform, they shall after that be thrown out of the Church, and have the 
Casture
 denied them; neither shall any Priest go into their Houses until they have yielded Obedience.








Decree XXV.


WHereas in this Diocess there are many Churches dedicated to 
Marxobro
 and 
Mar∣phrod,
 who are commonly stiled 
Saints,
 of whom there is


 nothing known, only it is commonly said, 
That they came into these Parts and wrought


 wrought Miracles, and returned afterwards to 
Babylon,
 from whence they came, others affirm∣ing that they died in 
Coulaon,
 there being no∣thing writ of them that is Authentick, neither does it appear that they were ever canonized by the Church; but on the contrary, since they came from 
Babylon,
 there is just cause to suspect that they might be Hereticks: Wherefore the Synod doth command, That all the Churches which are dedicated to them, be dedicated to all the Saints, and that the Festivities used to be kept to their Honour, and the 
Ner∣chas
 that used to be given upon their days, shall be given on 
All Saints
 day, being the first of 
November:
 and for the future there be no more Churches dedicated to them, Churches and Festivities being never to be dedicated, nor Pray∣ers made to any but to Saints canonized and ap∣proved of by the Church.








Decree XXVI.


WHereas Experience has demonstrated that many Churches have been Robbed by reason of the Poors Box being kept in them and not opened in many Years, no not when the necessities of the Churches did require it; therefore the Synod doth command, That in every Church upon the first of 
January
 there be chose four substantial and consciencious Men to be Overseers of the Poor, and to take care of the Church, who at the end of the Year shall open the Poors Box and take out all the Alms they find therein, which shall be put down in a Book by one of the four Overseers, and the said Alms shall be afterwards put into a Chest Lock∣ed with three different Keys, which shall stand in any one of their Houses as they shall agree, of which Keys the Vicar shall have one, and the other two the two Overseers, who are not the Scrivener, nor in whose Houses the Chest is not kept: He that's the Scrivener shall also have a Book, in which he shall set down the Expences of the said Alms, how much has been laid out upon the Fabrick of the Church, and in the reparation of the Walls and Roof, how much in adorning it, and in necessary Linen, and in Pictures, and in keeping it clean: And when∣soever there is any great extraordinary Expence, it shall not be made without the consent of the four Overseers, according to custom; neither

 shall the Chest be opened but when they are all five present, or some one in the place of him that is lawfully hindred; and when new Over∣seers are chose, the old ones shall deliver the said Chest to them, for which the Elect shall give a Receipt, that so it may always appear how much has been received and how much is re∣maining: And the Prelate in his Visitation shall look over the said Books and inform himself of the Expences, and may order the Alms to be disposed of as he shall think fit and necessary. And the Synod intreats the most Reverend 
Me∣tropolitan
 to see that this Decree be put in exe∣cution at the Visitation he intends to make, it being a thing of great advantage to the Churches.






Decree XXVII.


WHereas most of the Churches of this Dio∣cess are kept very Nasty, being full of Dust and Cobwebs, for want of an Officer to keep the Church clean, therefore the Synod doth command, that the Overseers appoint a 
Capiar,
 who shall be paid out of the Alms, for Sweep∣ing the Church and keeping clean the Lamps and Candlesticks; and the 
Capiar
 shall take care that the Church be Swept at least three times a Week, and there be always one Lamp at least lighted before the High Altar, and the Vessels wherein the Lamp-Oil is kept, without they be so small as not to be seen, shall not be kept in the Church, nor the 
Bategas
 or Kettles, nor any

 thing else that is undecent, but shall be kept in the 
Capiar
's or Overseers Houses, that so the Church may be kept clean and decent.






Decree XXVIII.


THe Synod doth command, That in all Vestries of Churches there be Cupboards and Chests with Locks, to keep the Cups, Cor∣porals, and Ornaments in; and where there is no Vestry until one shall be built, they shall be kept some where in the Church; except in the 
Heaths,
 where the Churches are in danger of being robbed, where the Vicars shall keep them in their Houses, and shall by no means leave any of them upon the Altars, as has been the custom, which was the occasion of the Ornaments be∣ing so dirty, and of the Altars being so much out of order: And whereas most of the chief Chapels are extreamly dark, they shall take care to have Windows opened, and fortified with Iron to let in Air and Light, which must nevertheless be so contrived, that the Heathens when they come may not see the Divine Myste∣ries thorow them.






Decree XXIX.


WHereas almost all the Churches of this Dio∣cess are without Pictures, which was the effect of their being governed by 
Nestorian
 He∣reticks, who do not allow of the healthful use

 of Sacred Images; therefore the Synod doth command, That in Churches that are finished, the first work that shall be done after that of the Baptismal Font out of the Alms of the Pa∣rish, shall be to set up some Images, according to the directions of the Prelate, who shall al∣ways be consulted about every Picture, and af∣ter that of the High Altar is once set up, if the Church has any Side-Altars, they shall also have Images set up in them, and on every Altar besides an Image, there shall be a Cross or some Matter or other set up; and in all Churches that are large enough, and yet have no Pulpits, Pul∣pits shall be erected for the Preaching of the word of God; and they shall also put Bells in their Steeples to be rung at meet times, and to call the People to Church, which shall not be hung within the Church, where besides that they can∣not be rung as they ought to be, they do take up too much room; and in places where there is danger of having their Bells stole, they shall have their Steeples fortified and shut up after the manner of Towers; and where the Kings and 
Bramens
 of the 
Pagods
 will not consent to their having a Building higher than the Church, which often happens through their imagining that the 
Pagods
 are made melancholly by the hearing of such Bells; they shall hang them with∣in the Church but at such a height, that they may ring them without touching them with their hands, and that they shall take up no room be∣low in the Church; and in those Churches where

 they have no Bells, the Synod grants Licence un∣til such time as they can procure some, to make use of Boards, as they have done formerly, to call the Faithful together, and to give the Signal at the 
Mass.






Decree XXX.


THe Synod doth teach and declare, That by ancient Right always observed in the Church, Churches may be so violated in certain Cases, that it is not lawful to Celebrate in them, nor to bury the Dead until they are reconciled, which through ignorance of the Canons has not hither∣to been observed in this Bishoprick; the Cases are, 
when humane Blood is injuriously
 shed in the Church, or there is a Natural Cause given of such shedding, or of Death; as if one has a Mortal Wound given him in the Church, or a Wound that fetches Blood, notwithstanding the Wounded Person shall be got out of the Church before any Blood is shed; but if the Wound was given without the Church, notwithstanding the Blood thereof should come to be shed therein, the Church is not violated thereby; and by a Wound that is injuriously given in the Church, whereby Blood is shed, tho' the Wound should not prove Mortal, the Church is violated. The second Case is, 
when humane Seed is voluntari∣ly spent in the Church,
 tho' in conjugal Copula∣tion: The third is, 
when one that is Excommu∣nicated is buried in the Church:
 The fourth

 
when an Infidel is buried in it;
 in which Case the Church is not only to be reconciled, but the Walls are also to be scraped: The fifth is, 
when the Church has been Consecrated or Blessed by a Bishop that was publickly Excommunicate;
 in all which Cases the Church is to be reconciled, which reconciliation being to be done to a Church that was Consecrated by a Bishop, none but a Bishop can perform it: But having been only Blessed by one, or by a Priest, the Vicar may perform the Reconciliation, according to the Form, and with the Prayers and Ceremonies contained in the 
Roman
 Ceremonial Translated into 
Syrian;
 and it is to be observed, that when a Church is violated, the Church-yard that be∣longs to it is violated also, if they are not at some distance the one from the other; but when the Church-yard is violated in any of the forementioned Cases, the Church it belongs and is joined to, is not violated thereby.






Decree XXXI.


IT being of mighty moment that Consecrated Churches be had in great Reverence; and whereas in this Diocess it is a common thing for Sick People out of Devotion to lie in Churches with their Wives and Families for several days, hoping thereby to be cured of their Distempers, which cannot be done without many Services; wherefore the Synod doth command, That no Person whatsoever, tho' never so Sick, do lie

 in the Church with his Family, the time of War only excepted, but the Sick having performed their Devotion, shall lie at home at their own Houses, or if they shall desire it may Lodge in some Houses that are near to the Church, or in the Porches thereof, but by no means within the Church.






Decree XXXII.


WHereas there is a great neglect in carrying the Corps of those that die in the 
Heaths
 to the Church, which are sometimes buried with∣out a Priest, and in unconsecrated Earth; where∣fore the Synod doth command, That the Kindred, or those in whose Houses Christians do die, do carry their Corps, how far soever they may live off, near to the Church, where the Vicars shall go to fetch them, with the Cross of the Church, and in their 
Surplice
 and 
Stole,
 praying all the way they go with the rest of the Clergy, and Interr them, which all, tho' never so poor, shall be oblig'd to do: And if at the time when they bring the Corps they shall meet with no Priests in the Church, they shall then assemble as many Christians together as conveniently they can, and bury the Corps in the Church-yard, praying for their Souls with Christian Charity: And who∣soever shall neglect to bring their Dead to the Church, and shall bury them in Profane Ground, shall be severely punished by the Bishop.








Decree XXXIII.


WHereas the Small-Pox is looked upon in these parts as a very dangerous and infe∣ctious Distemper, for which reason a great ma∣ny Christians dying thereof are not carried to the Church, nor buried in Holy ground; here∣fore the Synod doth very much recommend it to the Vicars to take order, that the Corps of such as die of that Sickness may be brought with due caution to the Church-yard, where they with the rest of the Clergy at some distance are to recommend them, and pray for them, as they do for others, and to see them interr'd: all which Christian Charity will teach them to do, according to the Obligation of their Office.






Decree XXXIV.


THe Synod doth order that no Town or Vil∣lage, wherein there is a Church dedicated to any Saint, shall dedicate the same to any o∣ther, or if they do, they shall appoint another 
Orago,
 or Wake, so as to have two Festivals to prevent those Emulations that are common in these parts. The Synod also condemns the
 Ig∣norance of those Christians who imagine that they

 do an injury to a Church, in dedicating a New one in the same Country to a different Saint, from whence it is that all the Churches in the same Country are as it were called by the same Name, and doth furthermore command, That upon the 
Orago's
 of Churches where there are Sermons, people having no Sermon in their own Parish, do repair thither that so there may be no divisions among Churches, to the prejudice of Charity and Christian Unity, as the Synod is informed there is in many places, all which it is desirous to remove, as not becoming Christi∣ans, and for the further service of the Church commands Fraternities to be erected, but espe∣cially for the festivities, by which means such things as are necessary for the Church may be greatly advanced.








Decree XXXV.


THe Synod doth very much recommend it to the Vicars of Churches, and other Priests to labour much in the Conversion of 
Infidels,
 and that by just and gentle methods, namely, by the preaching of the Gospel to bring them to the Catholick Faith, and to omit no opportuni∣ty, of instructing as well the 
Naires
 as the 
Chegos,
 or baser sort of People in the knowledge of the Truth; but above all, the poor 
Malleans
 who live in the Heaths, who as the Synod is inform∣ed, are less wedded to their Errors, particular∣ly that of the Adoration of Idols, and are much better disposed to receive the Evangelical Doctrine than others; and whensoever any Infidel is converted, the Priest shall advise the Prelate thereof, that he may take such order therein as he shall judge most convenient, and to be most for the service of Christ, earnestly entreating that the Conversions that are begun in some parts by the most Reverend 
Metropoli∣tan,
 may be carried on by the Clergy of this Diocess, by providing themselves continually of such Priests as are fit to advance the same, and where-ever there is any considerable number of Converts, they shall immediately build Church∣es, and appoint Vicars to take the Cure of their Souls.








Decree XXXVI.


VVHereas the Synod is informed, That the meaner sort of People are much better disposed to receive the Faith than the 
Naires,
 or Nobles, and being extreamly desirous to find some way whereby such well disposed People may be made Christians, so as to assemble toge∣ther with the old Christians, as why should they not, since they all adore the same God, with whom there is no distinction of Persons, and are all of the same Faith, and do all use the same Sacra∣ments, and whereas after mature deliberation, and having oftentimes recommended the matter to God, and conferred about the most proper me∣thods for the effecting of it in the Congregati∣ons, we have not been able to find any that are effectual, by reason of the Heathen Kings and Lords to whom all the Christians in these parts are subject, who, if they should observe that we withdraw their common Subjects from their Religion, would correspond with us no longer to the loss of the Trade and Commerce we do at present maintain with them, all which being ob∣served by the Synod, it doth command that if any of the poorer sort of People shall desire to turn Christian, that they be received to Baptism, and the Prelate shall be advised thereof, that he may give order for the building of distinct Churches for them, and may appoint Priests to take the Cure thereof, that so the meaner sort of

 People may not have the Gate of Christianity and Salvation shut against them, as it has been hitherto in this Church; and in case they have not a Church to themselves, they shall then hear Mass without doors in the Porch, until Christ shall provide some better way for them, and the Heathen Kings shall be brought to allow the mean People that turn Christians to be esteemed as Noble, upon the account of the Relation that all Christians stand in to one another: and the Sy∣nod doth beg it of His Majesty the King of 
Por∣tugal,
 that by means of the great Power he has in these parts, he would procure this privilege of the Kings and Lords of 
Malabar.






Decree XXXVII.


THe Synod being desirous that the Church of the 
Serra,
 should in all things be confor∣mable to the 
Latin
 customs, or Holy Mother Church of 
Rome,
 unto which 
See
 she has now 
ielded a perfect Obedience, and whereas in the 
Roman
 Church, the custom is to make the Sign of the Cross and Blessings from the left to the 
ight, so that in saying, 
In the Name of the Fa∣
her, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
 they 
ut their hand on their Forehead, and after that descended to their Breast, where after having 
rossed themselves, they go next to the left Shoul∣
er, and from thence to the right, thereby sig∣
ifying among other Mysteries, that by virtue of the Cross of Christ the Son of God, we are

 translated from the left hand, the place of Repro∣bates, to the right, the place of the Elect; and the custom of this Diocess is to make the said sign from the right to the left; wherefore the Synod doth command that all Children and all other Peo∣ple be taught to cross and bless themselves from the left to the right, according to the 
Latin
 cu∣stom, which shall also be observed by the Priests in the blessings they give to the People, and in the Crosses they make in the Holy Sacrifice of the 
Mass,
 and the Administration of the other Sacraments.






Decree XXXVIII.


THe Synod doth declare, That the Executi∣on of Last Wills lawfully made by decea∣sed Christians does by the Canon Law belong to Prelates and Bishops, who are to take care that they be observed; and that whatsoever Christi∣an has made a Will that is valid according to the custom of the place, if it is not complyed with in a Year after the Death of the Testator, the Bishop shall by censures, and other Penalties, if found necessary constrain the Heirs, or others, whose Duty it is to fulfill the same.








Decree XXXIX.


WHereas it often happens that Persons dy∣ing who were under the scandal of ha∣
g committed some grievous Sin, tho' never 
oved upon them, are upon that account de∣
ed the Prayers, and other Offices of the Dead, 
ecially if they desired Confession, and were 
fessed at their Death, which is contrary to the 
der and custom of the Church, which deprives 
one of her publick Prayers, but such as die Ex∣communicate, or in the Act of some Mortal Sin, without having given any sign of Contrition: Therefore the Synod doth command, that what∣soever Sins one may have committed, if the cen∣
e of Excommunication was not annexed to 
m; or unless the Person died in the very Act 
 some Mortal Sin, without giving any sign of 
ntrition, or slowly in his Bed, without desi∣
g to be confessed, or to have a Priest called to 
 to that effect, as is appointed by the Decrees 
 the Sacrament of 
Penance,
 they shall pray and 
form the Office of the Dead for him, and bu∣
y him in Holy Ground with the same Prayers they do other People.






Decree XL.


THe Synod having thanked the 
Jesuits
 of the College of 
Vaipicotta
 in this Diocess, 
nd of the other Residencies, for the pains they

 have been at in instructing the Christians of these parts, does for the greater benefit of the Souls of the said Christians, grant Licence to the said Re∣ligious, as well of the College, as of their other greater Residencies to preach and hear Confessi∣ons, and administer the Sacraments in all Chu
¦ches where-ever they come, without standing 
 need of any further Licence, the Sacrament of 
Matrimony
 only excepted, which it shall not be lawful for them to administer without leave fro
 or at the request of the Parish Priests, command¦ing all Vicars and Curates of Churches, and 
 the People to receive the said Fathers chearful¦ly, and to entertain them with great Kindne
 and Thanks, for the great trouble they are 
 in travelling continually over the Mountains on
 for the Salvation of their Souls, and rejoyce 
 learn from them how to administer the Sacra¦ments, and to have their Flocks instructed 
 them in all such Doctrines as are necessary 
 their Souls, and their Vicars shall oblige the
 People to come to Church, to hear them, when ever they preach, the Synod being very con
¦dent, that the said Fathers will exercise all th
 said Functions in great Love and Charity with the Parish, and all the other Priests of the Church.








Decree XLI.


WHereas the Constitutions of the Bishoprick of 
Goa
 have been received in the Pro∣
ncial Councils thereof, and have been ordered 
 be observed thorow the whole Province, of 
hich this Church being a 
Suffragan,
 is obliged by 
e said Councils, and to which this Synod yield∣
g a due Obedience, doth command, That in 
 things that can be observed in this Bishoprick, 
 concerning which there is no provision made 
 this Synod, the said Constitutions be kept 
d obeyed, and doth likewise command, That 
peals whensoever made from Sentences given 
 this Bishoprick to the 
Metropolitan,
 such Ap∣
ls being made in such Cases wherein the Ca∣
s allow them, shall be granted; neverthe∣
 not intending hereby to alter any thing in 
t mild method of the Prelate, and four or 
ore Persons composing Matters amicably to the 
evention of many Discords, but if the Parties 
ll not submit to such determinations, but will 
peal to the 
Metropolitan,
 it shall not be denyed 
m, being done in due form.










ACTION IX. Of the Reformation of Manners.




Decree I.


WHereas of all the evil Customs that are to be rooted from among the Faithful, tho
 are the most dangerous which have something 
 the Heathen Superstition in them, of which th
 Bishoprick is full; therefore the Synod desiri
 that all such customs were totally extirpated, th
 so Christians may enjoy Christianity in its purity doth in order thereunto command, that all Superst
¦tious washings which are by some most superstit∣ously practised as Holy Ceremonies be utterly abo∣lished, such as the washing of Dead Corps the Da
 after they have given a 
Dole,
 reckoning it a S
 to neglect such washings, the making of Circl
 with Rice, into which they put the Parties that a
 to be Married, having given Rice before to Chil∣dren, as also the taking a thred out with great Su∣perstition when they cut a Web of Cloath, and the taking two grains of 
Nele
 back again, after they have sold and measured it: all which Heathenish Vanities the Synod totally prohibits, commanding all that shall use them hereafter to be severely punished.








Decree II.


THo' it would much rejoice the Synod to see the Superstitious and absurd Customs of the Heathen 
Malavars
 of the better sort not mixing with the lower, and of having no com∣munication or correspondence with those that 
ave but touched any of them, totally abolished 
mong the Christians of this Bishoprick; yet for∣
much as the Christians thereof, by reason of 
eir being subject to Infidel Princes, whom they 
e forced to obey in all things, wherein the 
ith is no ways concerned; and that Christians, 
 they should but touch those of the baser rank, 
uld not after that, according to the Laws, have 
y Trade or communication with the better 
rt of People, and so would not be able to live 
mong them; for which reason the Synod doth 
clare, That the custom of not touching any 
 the baser sort, being observed only in com∣
yance with the Heathens, and looked upon as 
 Superstitious Heathen Vanity, and not volunta∣
y observed, is no Superstition, nor for the above∣
entioned Reasons any matter of scruple, and 
at Christians may in all places thus lawfully observe it, where there are 
Naires
 or any of the better sort, or where it is likely they may 
e, or may come to hear of it: But in all places where these Causes do not concurr, or in secret, or among the 
Portuguezes,
 this Superstition cannot be observed without doing a great injury to

 their Consciences; on the contrary, the Synod doth admonish all the Faithful to receive all such with great Love and Charity, tho' never so poor and mean, and especially if they are Chri∣stians, knowing that there is no distinction of Persons with God, who is Lord of all: And albeit they do not touch the base sort of Peo∣ple upon the forementioned account, yet if the
 should happen to touch any of them, they shall not wash themselves thereupon, that being a thin
 that can never come to the knowledge of th
 Heathens, and would therefore be a manifes
 Superstition; those also that will not touch the 
Naires,
 or if they should, do wash themselves which, as the Synod is informed, is what the Christians in the 
Southern
 parts do observe, where the forementioned impediment is not among the Heathens, who are rather scandalized by such a contemptuous Carriage: Therefore the Synod doth command all that shall be found guilty of forbearing to touch such, or having touched them, shall wash themselves, to be severely pu∣nished as Superstitious followers of the Heathen Customs, and commands the Preachers and Con∣fessors to admonish them thereof in their Ser∣mons and Confessions.








Decree III.


THe Synod being informed, that in some parts when any one of the baser sort do but touch the Cisterns of Christians, that Christians do 
Disempolear
 or 
Purify
 them, by performing cer∣tain Ceremonies after the manner of the Hea∣
hens, which is very contrary to the Purity of 
e Christian Religion, being an intolerable Su∣
rstition, doth with great rigour command those 
hat make the said 
Disempoleamento
 or 
Purificati∣
 or use the said Ceremonies, to be thrown out 
 the Communion of the Church, and to be de∣
ied the 
Casture
 during the Prelate's pleasure, or at 
ast for one Year, and to be punished with the 
enalties that such Ceremonies do
 deserve.






Decree IV.


WHereas in the Feast of the Heathen, called 
Ona,
 which is Celebrated in 
August,
 in which they go out one against another with Bows and Arrows, and other Arms, in which conflicts some are killed, and more wounded; and some Christians, unmindful of their Obliga∣tions, living among them, and communicating much with them, do go forth with them, and Armed as they are to the said Feasts, and are thereby liable to the same Disasters: Therefore

 the Synod doth command all the Faithful Chri∣stians of this Bishoprick, in Holy Obedience, and upon pain of Excommunication, not to presume to resort to this or any other Heathen Festivity, tho' there should be no Ceremony belonging to a 
Pagod
 therein; forasmuch as all such Feasts are dedicated to the said 
Pagods,
 and are celebrated and observed to their Honour and Veneration; which is the rather to be forbore in this of the 
Ona,
 by reason of the danger of death that there is probably therein, the Heathens superstitiously imagining that all that die in that occasion, go immediately to Heaven; but Christians shall only observe their own Holy Festivities among them∣selves, and that with a due moderation and de∣cency, as becomes the Professors of the Law of Christ; without having any thing to do with the Superstitious Festivals of the Heat
ens, which are dedicated to the Honour of the Devil, and if any Christian shall die in the said Heathen Feast, he shall be denied Ecclesiastical Burial.






Decree V.


FAithful Christians must not only avoid the Ceremonies and Superstitions of the 
Heathens,
 but the 
Judaical
 Rites and Ceremonies also, which were all abrogated by the sufficient promulgati∣on of the Gospel, for which reason the Synod, tho' it doth very much commend the Holy Cu∣stom of carrying Children to Church forty days after they are born, to offer them to the Lord,

 in imitation and praise of what was done by our Lady the most Holy 
Virgin;
 nevertheless it con∣demns the separating of Women for the said forty days after the birth of a Male, as if they were unclean so as not to suffer them to enter into the Church, imagining they would sin in doing it, and eighty days after the birth of a Female; both which are 
Jewish
 Ceremonies, that are now abrogated, and not only useless but prejudicial, and as such, the Synod doth totally prohibit the observance of them; declaring, that if Women have Health and Strength sooner, they shall be obliged to go to Church to hear 
Mass
 upon 
Sundays
 and Holy-days: and after forty days they may, according to their Custom, carry their Sons to Church with Devotion, understanding that there 
s no Precept of the Church for it, but that it is only a pious Devotion of faithful Women that are willing to make such an Offering of their Sons to God in imitation of the most Holy Virgin 
Mary,
 the Mother of God, taking her for the Intercessor of the Children thus offered to God both for Spirituals and Temporals.






Decree VI.


ONe of the greatest Sins in the sight of God, and which he has always prohibited and punished above all others, is 
the consulting of Witches,
 and such as hold a correspondence with the Devil; wherefore the Synod being informed that a great many Christians of this Bishoprick,

 and especially among those that live in the 
Heaths,
 by reason of the Communication they have with 
Infidels,
 and their having so many 
Witches
 and 
Fortune-tellers
 about them, when they intend to Marry, have recourse to such People to know what Success they shall have, governing themselves so much by what they are told, as to break off Matches after they are concluded, and to make new ones at the plea∣sure of the said 
Witches;
 as also when they are Sick, that they send for such People to perform some Ceremony whereby they hope to have their Health restored; and at other times to help them to Children, and to discover Thefts, and f
 several other purposes; all which are things re∣pugnant to the Christian Religion, doth com∣mand all Christian convicted of having con∣sulted any of the said 
Witches
 for these or any other purposes, to be thrown out of the Church, neither shall any Priest go to their Houses o
 give them the 
Casture,
 during the Prelate's plea∣sure, or for one Year at least, and shall be punished with such other Penalties as the Ce∣remonies they performed and consented to shall deserve.








Decree VII.


THe Synod being informed, that some wic∣ked Christians are not content only to go to 
Witches
 to consult them, but do furthermore send for them to their Houses, where they joyn with them in the Invocation of their 
Pagods,
 and 
 making offerings and Sacrifices to them, in killing Dogs, and performing other Ceremonies, that are contrary to the Faith, namely, one which 
ey call 
Tollicanum, Ollicanum, Bellicorum, Co∣
,
 which they do often publickly to the great 
ndal of Christianity, as if they were not Chri∣
ans, and at other times permit the Heathens to 
rform them in their Houses, doth command in 
rtue of Holy Obedience, and upon pain of 
communication to be 
Ipso facto
 incurred, that 
 Christian shall presume to perform any of 
 said Ceremonies, or consent to the perfor∣
ng of them in their Houses, and that all that do 
nsgress therein, shall be declared Excommuni∣
te in the Church, until they shall beg for mer∣cy, and have undergone condign and publick Punishment in the Church, and tho' upon their 
epentance appearing to be true and sincere, 
hey may be absolved, yet they shall not have the 
Casture
 given them, neither shall any Priest go to their Houses in two Years, save in case of peril of Death; and they who shall go to offer 
ay thing to a 
Pagod,
 or shall make any Vow to one, shall be punished after the same manner,

 and with the same Penance, and shall incurr Ex∣communication 
Ipso facto,
 in all which Matters the Vicar must be very watchful for the preven∣tion of all such Idolatries.






Decree VIII.


A Great many ignorant Christians of this Bi∣shoprick being unmindful of the Purity of their Christian Obligations, do carry Notes a∣bout them which have been given them by 
Witches
 for the Cure of their Distempers, hoping for relief from their vertue, hanging them like∣wise about the Necks of their Cattle to keep them well, and putting them in their Orchard
 to encrease the Fruit, and communicating them to several other things for various effects; all which the Synod detesting as Diabolical, dot
 command all that are guilty thereof to be severe∣ly punished by the Prelate, and all Vicars not to permit any such Offenders to enter into the Church, nor to give them the 
Casture,
 and no Priests to go to their Houses, and they shall be compell'd to deliver all such Notes to their Vi∣cars to be torn, and all that have used any of them, tho' they should never do it more, shall be punished for the space of six months with the said Penalties.








Decree IX.


THe 
Onzena,
 or practice of Usury, is a grie∣vous Sin in the sight of God, and is very much condemned in the Scriptures, Christ com∣manding us 
to lend to others, hoping for no∣thing again,
 and the Synod being very much troubled to find the greatest part of the Christi∣ans of this Diocess entangled therein, through their ignorance of what gains are lawful, and 
hat are not, and of what may be kept, and what 
ght to be restored, doth therefore admonish 
 the Lord, all Faithful Christians to consult 
he Learned about these Matters, giving them 
 account of all their Contracts, in order to 
eir being rightly instructed as to what they 
ay lawfully take for Money they have lent out. 
nd the Synod doth furthermore declare, that 
ccording to the best Information it has receiv∣
d, the Interest of Money in 
Malabar
 is Ten 
per 
ent.
 and whatever is taken more, if the Prin∣cipal runs no
 risk is 
Onzena,
 or Usury, and as

 to the Ten they shall likewise consult the Learn∣ed, to whom they shall declare how Money may be improved in the place where it is lent, that so they may be able to tell them, whether it be lawful for them to take so much, for it may hap∣pen that in some places, there will not be so much to be got by the Negotiating of Money, which must make such an high interest to 
 there unlawful, and whosoever shall take more than Ten 
per Cent.
 if his Principal runs no risk, after having been three times admonished by the Prelate or Vicar without Amendment shall be declared Excommunicate, and shall not be ab∣solved until he has dissolved the said Contract.






Decree X.


THe Synod doth condemn the taking of One 
per Cent.
 by the month, where the Principal runs no risk, being secured by a pledge, and of Two 
per Cent.
 by the Month, if the one is not payed punctually, such Contracts being very un∣just and manifest 
Onzena,
 or Usury, so that nei∣ther the want of a pledge, nor any thing else can justifie the taking of Two 
per Cent.
 by the month, if the Principal is not in danger, all which Con∣tracts the Synod doth prohibit, and the Vicars to give their consent to any such, and where they are made to dissolve them, compelling all that are faulty therein by Penalties and Censures if it shall be found necessary: The Synod doth furthermore condemn their calling all Gain ari∣sing

 from Money, 
Onzena,
 because it gives occasi∣on for some to imagine that all such Gain is un∣lawful, and notwithstanding such Gain is law∣
l, and may be justly taken in several Cases, to 
ruple the taking any.






Decree XI.


WHereas there are great numbers of Christi∣ans who for want of having the Fear of God and the Church before their Eyes, do co∣
bit publickly with Concubines, to the great 
ndal of Christianity; the Vicars shall there∣
re with great Charity admonish all such Of∣
nders, three times declaring to them, That if 
ey do not reform, they must declare them Ex∣communicate, and if after so many Admonitions they do not turn away their Concubines, they must be Excommunicated until they are effectual∣
 parted, and be punished with other Penalties 
 the pleasure of the Prelate, according to the 
me that they have lived in that Sin, and 
hen it shall so happen that their Concubines are their Slaves, they shall constrain them not only to turn them out of their Houses, but to send them out of the Country where they live, that there may be no more danger of their re∣lapsing, which shall be likewise observed as to all other Women where there is the same danger.








Decree XII.


THe Synod doth very earnestly recommend it to all Masters and Fathers of Families, to be very watchful over the Lives and Manners of their Slaves and Servants, and the rather for ha∣ving been informed, that most of the Black Wo∣men belonging to Christians in this Bishoprick, do lead very ill Lives in being publick Whores, and known to be such by their Masters, never going to 
Mass
 or 
Confession,
 and being totally ig∣norant of the Christian Religion, their Mast
 taking no care to have them instructed therei
 or of the good of their Souls, notwithstandin
 the Obligation they are under of doing it, S
 
Paul
 having told us, that 
he that does not ta
 care of his Family, is worse than an Infidel.
 Where∣fore the Synod doth very much recommend it to the Vicars of Churches to be very watchful ove
 and to make diligent Inquiry into the Lives o
 the Slaves that are in their Parishes, and as they shall see occasion to exhort their Masters, and oblige them not to suffer their Slaves to live in a sinful State.






Decree XIII.


WHereas several poor wretched Christians fol∣lowing the Custom of the Heathen among whom they live, when they find themselves pin∣ched with any want, do, contrary to all right and

 reason, sell their Children: Wherefore the Synod doth in Virtue of Obedience, and upon pain of the greater Excommunication, prohibit all Chri∣stians to sell their Children, or any of their Kin∣dred, no not to other Christians, and doth un∣der the same Precept and censure forbid all Christians to buy any such, or to keep them as Slaves, except when they see Parents so far de∣spise this prohibition, as to be ready to sell their Children to Infidels, in which case they may buy them to keep the Christian Children from coming under the power of Heathens, whom nevertheless they shall not keep as Slaves, but shall forthwith signifie what they have done, to the Prelate, that he may take such course there∣in, that the Buyer may have his Money, and the Child its liberty, and the Seller may be punished: all that shall buy such Children in any other case, as well as those that sell them, shall be held Excom∣municate until they have effectually dissolved all such Bargains; and if the Child do happen to be made an Infidel, he that sold it shall not be ab∣solved until he has ransomed the said Child, or at least until the Vicar and People are satisfied of his having done all that he is able to have re∣deemed it, and the Synod doth furthermore re∣commend it to the Vicars and Curates of Chur∣ches, and to all Christian People, that whenever any such thing happens, they do all that is in their power to recover such Children, and to ransom them whatever it cost, by contributing Money towards it, and by complaining thereof

 to their Kings, and advising the Prelate of it, leaving no means untried to rescue such Chil∣dren, that so they may not be bred up Infidels.






Decree XIV.


THe Synod doth approve of the laudable Custom of this Diocess of Mens giving the Tenth part of their Wives Portion when they are Married, to the Church; as also of that of making a repartition of the said Alms betwixt the Fabrick of the Church and the Priests there∣of; and whereas this Custom does not obtain all over the Diocess, and especially in the 
Southern
 Parts, the Synod doth intreat and command all People to conform themselves to the same, and willeth that the People among whom this Custom is not as yet introduced, may be obliged to it by their Procurators, there being no reason, since it is observed in the greater part of this Diocess, why it should not be established all over it.






Decree XV.


WHereas by the ancient Custom consented to by the Infidel Kings of 
Malabar,
 the whole Government of the Christians of this Bishoprick, not only in Spirituals but in Temporals also, is devolved to the Church and the Bishop thereof, who is to determine all differences that are a∣mong Christians, and that some dreading the Justice and Judgment of the Prelate in their

 Controversies, do without any fear of God, carry them before Infidel Kings and their Judges, who are easily bribed to do as they would have them, to the great prejudice of Christianity; the said Kings taking occasion from thence to intrude themselves into the Affairs of Christians, by which means, besides that they do not under∣stand such Matters, being Tyrants and Idolaters, they become very grievous and vexatious to Christians; for the avoiding of which, and seve∣ral other mischiefs arising from thence to Chri∣stianity, the Synod doth strictly command all the Christians of this Diocess, not upon any pretence whatsoever, to presume to carry any of their Causes before Infidel Kings or their Judges, with∣out express Licence from the Prelate; which, whensoever it shall be judged necessary, shall be granted to them as shall be thought fit in the Lord; but all Causes shall be first carried before the Prelate, that he may judge or compose them according to Reason and Justice; and all that shall do otherwise, shall be severely punished for the same, at the pleasure of the Prelate, and be thrown out of the Church for so long time as he shall think fit.






Decree XVI.


WHereas the Christians of this Bishoprick are subject to Kings and Lords that are Infidels, by whom they are many times obliged to handle Bars of hot Iron, or to thrust their

 Hand into boyling Oil, or to swim thorow Ri∣vers that are full of Snakes; reckoning, that if they are Innocent, none of those things can hurt them, but will certainly, if guilty of what they are accused: And seeing there are not wanting, some ill-minded Christians, who finding them∣selves unjustly accused, do voluntarily offer them∣selves to undergo the said 
Ordeals
 for the mani∣festation of their Innocency; and notwithstan∣ding that it is true that God has sometimes con∣curr'd with Peoples Innocency and Simplicity in such Cases, by not suffering them to be hurt by such things; nevertheless since for any to offer themselves to undergo such 
Ordeals,
 is to tempt God, and to pretend to work a Miracle, which is not lawful, and may sometimes so succeed, as to be a great affront to our Catholick Faith; therefore the Synod doth prohibit all Christians to presume to offer themselves to undergo any such 
Ordeals,
 knowing that they sin mortally in so doing, in being guilty therein of tempting God; commanding all that shall transgress there∣in, to be severely punished. And when it shall happen that any such 
Ordeals
 shall be so impo∣sed upon them by their Infidel Princes, that there is no avoiding it, in such Cases they shall submit themselves to the Will of God, as to the Injustices and Violences laid upon them by Infidel Tyrants; and in case of any Oath being tendred to them by Infidels, wherein they must swear by their 
Pagods,
 they must know that they ought rather to suffer death, than take any such Oath,

 the taking of an Oath being an act of Worship and Veneration, that is due to God alone: Nei∣ther shall Christians use any 
Ordeals
 among them∣selves, or Oaths, but such as were in use in the Church, the foresaid Oaths being what Christians ought to dread more than all the Torments of the World.






Decree XVII.


WHereas the distinction of the Faithful from Unbelievers, even by outward signs and habits, is a thing which has always been endea∣voured, that so the one may be known and di∣vided from the other; therefore the Synod ha∣ving observed that there is no distinction neither in their Habits nor in their Hair, nor in any thing else, betwixt the Christians of this Diocess and the Heathen 
Naires,
 doth command, that henceforward no Christian do presume to bore their Ears, or to do any thing to make them large, except Women, among whom it is an Universal Ornament; and whosoever shall trans∣gress herein, shall be punished at the pleasure of the Prelate, who shall not suffer them to wear an Ornament of Gold or of any thing else in their Ears; and whosover shall presume to wear any such Ornament, shall be thrown out of the Church, neither shall the 
Casture
 be given them un∣til such time as they are brought to yield effectual Obedience, and to leave off all such Ornaments; but as for those whose Ears are bored already,

 if they are not Children, they may wear what they please, or what they have accustomed them∣selves to.






Decree XVIII.


THe Synod being desirous to rectifie what∣ever is amiss in this Diocess, and so far as it is possible, to reform all evil Customs; and having observed the great Debauchery of many, and especially of the poorer sort, in drinking 
Orraca,
 from whence do follow many Disasters, Murders, and Wounds; wherefore in order to the preventing such Mischiefs so far as is possible, the Synod doth prohibit the selling of 
Orraca
 in any Christian Inn, neither shall Chri∣stians Trade in that Commodity upon pain of being punished at the pleasure of the Prelate, by which means not only Disorders, but the great Communication the Faithful hath with the Hea∣then in such Inns, will also be prevented.






Decree XIX.


WHereas it is a manifest Injustice to have di∣verse Weights in the same Country, the Synod being informed, that in many Markets of this Bishoprick every one sells with what Weights they please, doth command, That there be but one Weight for the same Merchandize in a Mar∣ket and all the Shops thereof, and that it be the usual Weight of the place; to which all that do

 not yield Obedience, shall be admonished by the Vicars, and if they do not reform thereupon, shall chastised at the pleasure of the Prelate, who shall constrain them to the same by Penalties and Censures, if they shall be found necessary; there being no other Government among the Christi∣ans of this Diocess but that of the Church, nor no other coercive Power but that of Censures.






Decree XX.


WHereas an unreasonable Custom has obtain∣ed in this Diocess, 
viz.
 That Males only inherit their Fathers Goods, the Females having no share at all thereof; and that not only when there are Sons, but when there are Daughters only, and they unmarried, and many times In∣fants, by which means great numbers of them perish, and others ruin themselves for want of necessaries, the Fathers Goods falling to the Males that are next in Blood, tho' never so re∣mote or collateral, there being no regard had to Daughters no more than if their Parents were under no obligation to provide for them; all which being very unreasonable, and contrary to the natural right that Sons and Daughters have to succeed, to the good of their Parents; the Kindred who have thus possessed themselves of such Goods, are bound to restore them to the Daughters as the lawful Heiresses to them; wherefore the Synod doth decree and declare this Custom to be Unjust, and that the next

 a-kin can have no right when there are Daugh∣ters to inherit their Father's Estate; and being possessed of such Estates, are bound in consci∣ence to restore them; neither is it lawful for the Males to divide the Estate among them, with∣out giving any equal Portion to the Females; or if they have not done it already, they stand in∣debted for their Portions; or if the Father has disposed of the third part of his Estate by Will, the remaining two parts shall be equally divided betwixt the Sons and the Daughters, the Porti∣ons that have been received by those that are married being discounted; all which the Synod doth command to be observed, intreating and commanding all the Christians of the Diocess to receive this Decree as a Law, and observe it intirely, it being laid as a duty upon their Con∣sciences; and if any shall act otherwise, and be∣ing a Kinsman, shall seize upon the Goods be∣longing to Daughters; or being a Son, shall de∣ny to give Portions to his Sisters, or being in possession of the said Goods, shall refuse to make restitution; the Prelate, if it cannot be done otherwise, shall compell them to it by Penalties and Censures, declaring them Excommunicate, without any hope of Absolution, until such time as they shall pay an effectual Obedience, and shall make restitution.








Decree XXI.


THe Adoption of Sons is not lawful, but in defect of natural Children; which not be∣ing understood by the Christians of this Bishop∣rick through their ignorance of the Law, they do commonly Adopt the Children of their Slaves born in their Houses, or of other People, disin∣heriting their lawfully begotten Children, some∣times upon the account of some differences they have had with them, and sometimes only for the affection they have to Strangers, all which is contrary to Law and Reason, and is a mani∣fest injustice and wrong done to their legitimate Children; wherefore the Synod doth declare, that the said Adoptions must not be practised where there are natural Children, and being done are void, so that the Persons thus Adopted are not capable of inheriting any thing, except what may be left them by way of Legacy, which must not exceed the third of the Estate; no, not tho' the Adoption was made before there were any Legitimate Children to inherit. The Synod doth furthermore declare, That the A∣doptions which have been made before the cele∣bration of this Synod, where there are Children, and the Adopted are not in actual possession of the Estate, are void, neither shall the Adopted have any share thereof, or having had any, shall be obliged to restore it, to which if it be found necessary, the Prelate shall compell them by Pen∣nalties

 and Censures; but as to those who by virtue of such Adoptions, have for a long time been in quiet possession of Estates, the Synod by this Decree does not intend to dispossess them thereof, by reason of the great disturbance and confusion the doing so would make in this Diocess, which is what this Synod pretends to hinder, leaving every one however in such Cases, at liberty to take their remedy at Law.






Decree XXII.


WHereas the way of Adopting by ancient Custom in this Diocess, is to carry the Parties that are to be Adopted before the Bishop or Prelate, with certain Testimonials, before whom they declare, that they take such a one for their Son, whereupon the Bishop passeth an 
Olla
 or Certificate, and so the Adoption is per∣fected; the Synod doth command, That from henceforward, the Prelate do not accept of an Adoption from any that have Children of their own; or in case they have none, yet it shall be declared in the 
Olla,
 That if they shall afterwards happen to have any, that the said 
Olla
 shall be void to all intents and purposes; by which means the great Injustices that are now so common in this Diocess will be prevented.








Decree XXIII.


THe Synod being desirous to have all the Christians of this Diocess to live together in Villages, by reason of the great inconveni∣encies they are under that live in the 
Heaths,
 as well by reason of the great communication they must have with Infidels, as for wanting opportunities of going to Church, and Sacra∣ments, whereby they are kept in ignorance of Christianity, doth in order thereunto very ear∣nestly recommend it to all Christians that live in 
Heaths,
 to do all they are able, either to come and live in some Village, or to build new Villages with Churches, that so they may live more civilly, and be separated from the com∣munication of Infidels, and be the better in∣structed in the Customs of our Holy Catholick Faith, recommending it earnestly to the Vicars to persuade their Sheep thereunto, for the Spi∣ritual profit they will receive thereby: which the Prelate shall also endeavour with all his power.






Decree XXIV.


THe Synod having taken into consideration the manifold Injustices, Oppressions and Grievances wherewith Infidel Kings and Gover∣nours do often treat the Christians of this Bi∣shoprick; and that out of enmity to our Holy Catholick Faith, and observing the necessity they

 are in of Defence and Protection, doth with great instance desire, That his Majesty the King of 
Portugal
 would be graciously pleased to take all the Christians of this Bishoprick under his Favour and
 Protection, he being the only Christian King or Lord in all these Oriental Parts; and the Christians of this Diocess shall on their

 parts be ready at all times to sacrifice their Lives to their Holy Catholick Faith, the preservation of Christianity, and the defence of Christians, which they shall be always prepared to do with their Lives and Fortunes; beseeching the most Reverend 
Metropolitan,
 President of this Synod, to present this their Petition to his Majesty, and to let him know how ready all the Christians of this Bishoprick are to serve him.






Decree. XXV.


WHereas in this Synod, Matters pertaining to our Holy Catholick Faith, the Holy Sacra∣ments of the Church, the Reformation of Affairs thereof, and the Customs of Christian People have been handled; the Synod doth command all Vicars of Churches not to fail to have all its Decrees Transcribed from the Original 
Malabar,
 and to have a Copy thereof in all their Churches, Signed by the Reverend the Arch-Deacon of this Diocess, and the Rector of the College of 
Vaipicotta,
 and upon every 
Sunday
 and 
Holy-day,
 when there is no Sermon nor no Lecture upon the 
Catechism
 set forth by the most Reverend 
Metropolitan,
 that a portion of this Synod be read to the People; but on the Seasons when the said 
Catechism
 is ordered to be read, it shall be read on 
Sundays,
 and the Synod upon 
Holy-days,
 that so all that is decreed therein may come to the knowledge of the People, and may be remembred and observed by them; the Ori∣ginal

 of the said Synod being Signed by the most Reverend 
Metropolitan
 and all the other Members thereof, shall be put in the 
Archives
 of the 
Jesuites
 College of 
Vaipicotta
 in this Dio∣cess, from whence so many Copies as shall be thought necessary, shall be transmitted to the Churches; there shall also be another Original Signed by the most Reverend 
Metropolitan,
 the Arch-Deacon, and other Members, kept in the 
Archives
 of the Church of 
Angamale,
 called the Arch-Bishop's 
See,
 that all Copies may at all times be Corrected according to either of those Originals; and the Synod doth furthermore re∣commend it to all Vicars, Priests, and Curates, and to all and every Christian of this Diocess, and commands them all in the Lord to conform themselves to the Decrees of this 
Diocesan
 Synod, and so far as is in their power, to observe and cause them to be observed inviolably, and to govern themselves by them in all things; which the Synod is confident they will do with the help of 
God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who liveth and reigneth for ever: Amen.


After the Decrees were read, the Bishoprick was divided into Seventy-five Parishes, whose Bounds were greater or lesser as was judged to be most convenient for the administration of the Holy Sacraments, and the Spiritual Food of the Faithful; Vicars were also nominated to them all, and the Churches that were not able to maintain a Vicar were united: The Vicars after they were named, were brought in one

 by one to kiss the 
Metropolitan
's Hand, who at the same time gave them their Collation, de∣claring to them the greatness of their Authority, and of the Obligations of their Office, and com∣manding the People to acknowledge them as their Parish-Priests and the Shepherds of their Souls. After they had all, one after another, per∣formed this Ceremony, they were admonished all together in the presence of the People by the most Reverend 
Metropolitan,
 to comply with the Obligations of their Function, and being all upon their Knees before him, he delivered the following Charge to them.


Venerable and beloved Brethren, and fel∣low Priests, and particular Pastors of the Faith∣ful, We let you all to understand, that we, tho' unworthy of it, are in the place of

None of you shall take 
he cure of a Church upon you without the Prelate's knowledge and order, notwithstanding you should be called to it by the People; neither shall any of you leave the Churches you have a Title to, nor be translated to another Church without his Order. None shall pre∣sume to hold more than one Church, contrary to the disposition of the Holy Canons. The Jurisdiction of no Church shall be divided a∣mong many, but every Church shall have its own Parish-Priest and Pastor. None shall Ce∣lebrate any where but in a Church, or with any sort of Arms.

eat charity and zeal, for their Spiritual profit. Upon the Feasts of the 
Nativity, Easter,
 and 
hitsuntide,
 ye shall exhort all the Faithful to re∣
eive the most Holy Sacrament of Christ's Body, 
nd at 
Easter
 at least ye shall take heed that all 
hat are capable do receive it. All quarrels, diffe∣
nces and enmities that shall arise among your 
bjects, ye shall endeavour to compose and 
blige them all to live as Friends in Christian

 Charity; and if there be any that give offence by refusing to speak to their Neighbours, being so malice with them, ye shall admonish them there∣of, and so long as they continue to behave them∣selves so, ye shall not suffer them to receive the Holy Sacrament of the Altar. At certain times, but chiefly upon solemn Festivities and Fasts, ye shall admonish Married Men, according to a Holy Council, to abstain from their Wives, None of you shall wear coloured Cloaths, o
 any Habit but what is grave and decent for Priests to wear. Ye shall instruct your People to forbear Working on

Every one of you must have a Catechism, an Exposition of the Creed, and of the Prayers of the Church, conformable to the Exposition of the Holy Catholick Doctors, by which ye may both edifie your selves and others. Ye must also have this Synod, that so you may go∣vern both your selves and your People by its Rules. Ye shall declare the Catholick Faith

holick Faith, by heart, and repeat it dayly:

Rubricks


 of the 
Breviary
 and 
Missal,

Easter;
 in which, that you may not be mistaken, ye must be sure to have the 
Martyrology
 of the Saints in all your Churches, which we will take care to have translated into 
Syrian.
 All which ye shall ob∣serve, that so by these and your other good Works, ye may, by the help of God, bring both your selves and your People to that Glo∣ry which shall endure for ever, and be bestow∣ed on you through the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit, liveth and reigneth for ever and ever: 
Amen.


The Speech and Admonition to the Vicars and Priests being ended, the most Reverend 
Metro∣politan
 commanded them all to Sign the Origi∣nal Decrees of the Synod, translated into 
Mala∣bar,
 desiring them, if they had the least scruple concerning any thing commanded or declared in the Synod, those excepted that have been de∣creed and decided already, that they would signifie them openly before they Subscribed, that there might be no doubt or controversie about any thing hereafter: So after several Doub
 had been considered and satisfied, they did all unanimously Subscribe to the Synod.


Then the Books of the Synod were delivered to the most Reverend 
Metropolitan,
 who being in his 
Pontificals,
 and seated on his Throne with a Mitre on his Head, Subscribed the said

 Decrees; which being done, a Table was set in the middle of the chief Chappel, and the De∣crees being laid upon it, all that were called to the Synod, as well Ecclesiasticks as Secular Pro∣curators, Signed and Subscribed them with their own hands before the whole Synod and People. The Synod consisted of 813, 
viz.
 133 Priests, besides Deacons and Sub-Deacons, and others of the Clergy, and 660 Procurators of the Peo∣ple, and other principal Men of the Laity, besides the Inhabitants of the Town of 
Diamper,
 where the Synod was held, and of several other neigh∣bouring Villages; there were likewise present a great number of 
Portugnezes,
 who came along with 
Don Antonio De Neronha,
 Governour of 
Cochim,
 who together with all the other Magi∣strates of the City, assisted at the Synod.


The Decrees being Signed, the most Reverend 
Metropolitan
 rose up, and having taken off his Mitre, kneeled down before the High Altar, and begun the 
Te Deum,
 with which, to the great joy of all that were present, a solemn Procession 
ound the Church was begun, the Quire singing that and some other Psalms, the 
Latines
 in 
Latin,
 and the 
Native
 Priests in 
Chaldee,
 and the People their Festivity in 
Malabar:
 proceeding to praise God with abundance of tears and joy, in three Tongues in the Unity of the Faith, and Good∣will among them all, for having at last obtained that, which they had so long desired of Almighty God, 
Three Persons, and One Nature, the Father the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who liveth and reigne
 for ever: Amen.




After the Procession was over, the most Re∣verend 
Metropolitan
 going to the High Altar, read the Prayer 
Exaudi quaesumus, Domine,
 as it is in the 
Pontifical;
 which being ended, he seated himself upon his Throne with the Mitre on his Head, and his Pastoral Staff in his Hand, and directing his Discourse to the People said, 
I give many thanks to Almighty God the Author of all good things, for this great favour he has vouchsafed to me and you, and all the faithful People of this Bishoprick, in permitting us to celebrate this Synod maugre all the impediments which Satan the enemy of Souls, had created to obstruct it, by stirring up Contentions and Debates on purpose to separate this Christianity from the Ʋnion of the Catholick Church, and to keep them in their old Errors, as you all very well know. I do also give many thanks to God, for his having been pleased to order Matters so, that this whole Affair should end with so much Joy, Peace and Concord, as you all see it does, and so much to the sorrow of Infidel and Idolatrous Kings, and of all the other Enemies of our Holy Catholick Faith. I do also thank you my most dear Brethren and fellow Priests and Coadjutors, and you my be∣loved Sons the Procurators of the People, and all the other principal Persons who have been present at this Synod, that not regarding the troubles of the Ways and Times, nor the displeasure of the Kings to whom you are subject; you have, as true Christians desirous of Salvation, over-looked all those Inconveniencies, and obeyed our Precept in assem∣bling your selves together to treat about the good

 of your Souls, for which God will reward you with Eternal Life, if you persevere in the purity of the Faith you have here profest, and which you have been taught by this Synod, and shall conform your Lives and Manners to its Decrees. I trust in the Lord that he will carry you back safe to your Houses, and bless you and your Families and Posterity for ever; which God of his infinite Grace and Mercy grant. Amen.


This Discourse being ended, the most Reve∣rend 
Metropolitan
 rose up, and with abundance of tears gave his solemn Blessing to the People, and after that, the Arch-Deacon with a loud voice said, 
Let us depart in peace;
 to which the whole Synod answered in the name of Christ, 
Amen.
 And thus the 
Diocesan
 Synod ended the 26th of 
June,
 in the Year 1599, to the Honour and Praise of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
who with the Father and the Holy Spirit, liveth and reigneth for ever: Amen.


The Synod being ended in conformity to what had been ordained therein, there was gi∣ven to every one of the Vicars that was nomi∣nated to any Church by the most Reverend 
Metropolitan,
 a Stone Altar, Consecrated by his 
Lordship
 for that purpose, their former Altars not having been duly Consecrated; as also a Box with the Vessels of Holy Oils, together with Directions how to use them: There was more∣over a Book of the Administration of the Sacra∣ments according to the 
Roman
 use, translated into 
Chaldee
 and 
Syrian,
 given to every Vicar,

 and another which contained the whole Christi∣an Doctrine in the 
Malabar
 Tongue, for the instruction of Children and others, as also a Sur∣plice to be used in the administration of Sacra∣ments, which was what had never been in use among them; the Churches were also furnished with Corporals, Vestments, Frontals, Cups, and what-ever else was necessary to the Ministry of the Altar, all which were wanting in most Churches; and all the Controversies, whether betwixt Corporations or particular Persons, that were brought before the Synod, were decided by the most Reverend 
Metropolitan
 and his Asses∣sors, after which they all departed in peace.


The most Reverend 
Metropolitan,
 as soon as the Synod was ended, begun his Visitation of all the Churches in the Diocess, in order to put the Decrees of the Synod in execution, reciting the principal and most necessary of them in every Church, and delivering the Books, Breviaries, and Missals, as well of th
 Churches as of par∣ticular Persons every where, and burning the Books condemned by the Synod, and correcting others, puting the Vicars in possession of their Churches, who were every where received as such by the People, who settled Revenues upon them; of which, together with what was given them by the most Reverend 
Metropolitan,
 they made 
Ollas,
 or Instruments in the Churches, cre∣ating four Church-wardens, and opening the Church Boxes, and in a word, ordering whate∣ver was necessary to be done. The Clergy,

 who had not been present at the Synod, made a profession of the Faith, the Confessors were ex∣amined, and had Licences given them in writing according to their abilities, and the necessity of the Church, prohibiting all others to hear Con∣fessions: Where there was a Font, they also Baptized all the Children that they found un∣christened, and had those brought in that were in the 
Heaths,
 where there were many that were Eight and Ten Years old unchristened. They Confirmed the whole People, and Absolved all that were Excommunicate; many of which, ac∣cording to their custom, had continued so for twenty or thirty Years, and especially for Mur∣ther, for which they never grant Absolution, no not at the hour of death; the 
Metropolitan
 preach∣ed every day to Christians in the Church, and to Infidels (who flocked to see him) in the Church Porch, treating with them about Baptism when he came to say 
Ingredimini in Sanctam Dei Ec∣clesiam,
 several of which he persuaded to turn Christians, who after having learned their Cate∣chism, were Baptized by him at other places: He Catechized the Children in the 
Malabar
 Tongue; and finding there was none of them that understood their Catechism, he ordered them to be taught it every day out of Books that were kept in the Church. Finally, where he met with any that were disposed to Marry, he Married them, and gave Orders about every thing else relating to the Synod, which he did in the Form following.




After the most Reverend 
Metropolitan
 had been received by the whole People with great Joy and Festivity, according to their fashion, and carried in Procession to the Church, the way as he went being covered with Cloth or Mats, or Boughs of Trees, after the common Ceremony of Blessing and Absolution, the whole People both Men and Women, came with a most profound Humility and Reverence to kiss his Hands, and to yield Obedience to him; he went to Church betimes in the Morning with the whole Clergy and People; where after ha∣ving Confessed himself before the High Altar, which he did for the great need there was of having those Christians instructed in the Sacrament of Confession, which was in use among them but in few places, he said 
Mass.
 When 
Mass
 was ended, Father 
Francisco Roz,
 Master of the 
Chal∣dean
 and 
Syrian
 Languages in the 
Jesuites
 Col∣lege at 
Vaipicotta,
 with the rest of the Fathers deputed to that Work, and some of the most learned 
Caçanares
 assembled together in the Sa∣cristy, or in some other place appointed, where in obedience to the Excommunication of the Synod, all the 
Syrian
 Books were brought be∣fore them, as well those that belonged to the Churches, as those belonging to private Persons; all which were emended, delivering those which were condemned by the Synod to the 
Metro∣politan,
 who burnt them all. The 
Metropolitan
 having in the mean time put on his 
Pontificals,
 sat down and Preached at length to the People,

 all the necessary Doctrines of Faith and Man∣ners; after which Discourse the chief Decrees of the Synod were published, and a Processi∣on for the Dead was made round the Church, to which such vast multitudes of Heathens re∣sorted to see the Novelty, and the 
Pontifical
 Vestments, that they filled the Church-yard and Windows: After the Procession for the Dead was ended, and the Doctrine of 
Purgatory,
 and the benefits of praying for them declared, the 
Metropolitan
 having seated himself, began a Dis∣course of the Sacrament of 
Confirmation,
 accor∣ding to the necessities of the People, and after that Anointed all that were present, then he Baptized all the Children of Christian Parents in his 
Pontificals,
 and such of the adult Hea∣thens as desired it, who were called together the day before to that purpose. The 
Metropo∣litan
 whenever he came to the words 
Ingredimi∣ni Sanctam Dei Ecclesiam,
 beginning a Discourse to the Heathens and 
Naires,
 that flocked to see the Ceremony performed, who tho' all Armed with Bows and Arrows and other Weapons, and in their own Country remote from the 
Portu∣guezes,
 did quietly and chearfully hear all that he said to them, not only concerning the Faith of Jesus Christ, but also the indignities and hard words which he bestowed upon their Idols and Priests in order to undeceive them: When the Sermon and Baptism was over, the Ecclesiasticks that were not present at the Synod, made a pro∣fession of the Faith before the People in the

 hands of the 
Metropolitan,
 and having called all the Children together, and ordering them to kneel round his Chair, he began a 
Chamaz,
 or set of Prayers in their own Tongue, which they all said after him, and having Blessed them all, made a Discourse to them suitable to their Age, to the great satisfaction of their Parents, teaching them the Veneration that is due to the most sweet Name of 
Jesus,
 to which, agreeable to the 
Nestorian
 Doctrine wherein they had been edu∣cated, they had payed no manner of Respect: After that he inducted the Vicar in the presence of the People, charging him with the Flock which received him for their Pastor, and where there were any to be Married he Married them; great numbers also Confessed themselves to him, and received the most Holy Sacrament at his hands, among whom were abundance of Ancient People, who had never Confessed themselves be∣fore: In the Evening the People assembled to∣gether and agreed about the Stipend, they de∣termined to settle upon their Vicar, which was Registred in 
Ollas,
 that were to be kept in the Church; and having opened the Money-Box of the Church, they distributed such Alms as they thought necessary. The 
Metropolitan
 and the Fathers that were in his Company, having ex∣amined the 
Caçanares,
 to such as he found to be qualified for it, he granted a Licence in writing to be Confessors; after that he heard all the Com∣plaints and Controversies that were among Christi∣ans, and having those four principal Men, with the

 consent of the Parties, they decided them all according to the Customs of the Country, and the Judgment of the 
Metropolitan,
 so as to exclude all farther Process or Appeals; be then Absol∣ved all that were Excommunicate, and several that had lain twenty or thirty Years under that Censure, there being several Cases wherein they were so barbarous, as never to grant Absoluti∣on, no not at the hour of Death, injoyning every one such Penances as were suitable to their Faults, omitting nothing that he judged necessary to the good of the Church and People; in all which he was accompanied and assisted by five 
Jesuites,
 who were all zealous for the Salvation of Souls, and well skilled in the 
Malabar
 Tongue, and two of them in the 
Chaldee
 also; they were Father 
Hieronymo Cotta,
 Father 
Jorgye de Crasto,
 Father 
Francisco Roz,
 who is now the most wor∣thy Bishop of that Diocess, Father 
Antonio To∣scano,
 and Brother 
John Maria:
 Father 
Frey Braz de Santa Maria,
 a Divine of the Order of St. 
Austin,
 was Confessor to the most Illustrious 
Metropolitan;
 there were also three Canons of the 
Metropolitan
 Church of 
Goa,
 and the 
Metro∣politan
's two Chaplains, and several 
Caçanares
 that were Natives, who celebrated the Divine Offices both in 
Chaldee
 and 
Syrian,
 whom the most Illustrious 
Metropolitan
 made great use of in several Occasions. In the reduction of this Church to the Catholick Faith, many remarkable things happened, in which God manifested how much that Work was for his Service; and in

 the Visitation of the Churches there were se¦veral Successes of great edification, and that were much for God's Praise, which shall, God willing be written in another place, for his Glory 
w
 liveth and reigneth for ever. Amen.








The Letter of 
Dom Andre
 Bishop of 
Cochi
 to the Synod, being Assembled.


BRethren, in my judgment all you who are cal¦led the 
Christians
 of St. 
Thomas,
 do owe much to God for his having by means of th
 Apostle, chose you from among such multitudes 
 Infidels as the 
East
 is filled with, to enlight
 your understandings with the Truth, and for having made you, as St. 
Peter
 saith, 
a Holy Nation, 
 purchased People:
 For you are not to imagine that your Forefathers did deserve more at the hands of God, than the other Infidels that were their Con∣temporaries, and yet you see how God was pleased to chuse them, and you by their means, when 
 the same time he left others and their Poster
 in their natural Misery; for which there can be no other Cause assigned, but that it was the Wi
 of God to extend that Mercy to you and your Forefathers, which he denied to all the other Peo∣ple of these Parts; and what makes this Mercy 
 be the greater and more Illustrious, is, That Go
 was pleased to bring you to the Faith, not by 
 Ministry of some obscure Person of small Authority,

 which has been the Case of many other Christians, but by sending two chosen and beloved Apostles to you, for your greater Honour, and that this Church might justly stile it self 
Apostolical;
 a privilege that was granted but to few Churches that are now in being in the World, and which the Metropolitan of 
Con∣stantinople
 was long ago ambitious of usurping to himself, if he might have been permitted. But Satan, the great Enemy to all that's Good, envying the great Glory of this Church, laboured to sow the Tares of Errours and Heresies in this Field of Christ's, and the Apostle St. 
Thomas;
 and so coming from 
Babylon
 and the Land of the 
Chaldeans,
 he brought along with him some of the Disciples of the perfidious 
Nestorius
 to pervert this Church
 This 
Nestorius
 was condemned as a Heretick in 
Asia minor,
 in the City of 
Ephesus,
 in a Council of 
200
 Bishops, and afterwards in a Council of 
630
 Bishops: He was so wicked and perverse an Heretick, that besides the punishment inflicted on him for his Sins by Men, God also begun to pu∣nish him in this Life, giving him as it were an earnest of those Punishments and Torments which he is now suffering in Hell; for besides his being deposed and deprived of his Bishoprick, and Condemned by the forementioned and other follow∣ing Councils, and Banished by the Sentence of the Emperour 
Theodosius
 the 
II.
 who then Reigned, in the Desarts of 
Aegypt,
 and his having his Books 
rned by the command of the said Emperour be∣fore his death, his Tongue with which he h
d uttered such great Blasphemies, rotted in his Mouth,

 as did also his whole Body, and being eat up with Lice he expired, surrendring his Soul to the Devil, as 
Evagrius,
 a Noble Writer who lived at the same time, relates; and the same is reported of him by 
Nicephorus, Cedrenus,
 and other Greek Writers. The Disciples of this cursed Heretick being brought into this Church by the Devil, sowed their Errours in it without being observed by you, who were a simple sincere People; insomuch that St. 
Thomas
 when he was on Earth, might have said the same that St. 
Paul
 did to those of 
Ephesus,
 where 
Nestorius
 was afterwards Condemned; 
I know that after my departure greedy Wolves shall come among you, not sparing the Flock:
 And well might the Pastors you have had among you be called 
devouring Wolves,
 who being a base and inconsiderable People, had no other intent but to rob you of all they could, taking Money for Orders,
 Dispensations, for Absolutions, and for all Sacraments and Sacred things, as you very well know; a thing so abominable in the sight of God, that St. 
Peter
 the Prince of the Apostles, for this Sin only threw 
Simon Magus
 out of the Church, and Excommunicated him, as you may see in the 
Acts of the Apostles;
 insomuch, Brethren, that we see that fulfill'd in you, and in your Prelates, who came from 
Babylon,
 which was foretold by God

 so many Years before by the Prophet 
Isaiah, The Shepherds themselves had no understanding, they have all gone out of the Way, and from the first to the last are all turned to Cove∣tousness.
 For God's sake, Brethren, tell me what sort of Prelates and Bishops could they be, who sought nothing but their own Interest; and who gave Orders and Dispensations, and did every thing that belongs to a Bishop, without being Bishops themselves, or so much as Priests or Clerks, but were pure Laicks, as they themselves afterwards con∣fessed: What Dispensation, what Sacrament, what Grace, could he who was dispensed with and or∣dained, receive from those who were no Bishops, nor so much as Clerks, but pure Laicks, nay 
Lascares,
 in whose Habit they came out of their own Coun∣try. Brethren, this is the Fruit which they send you from 
Babylon,
 Hereticks and pure Laicks, and Barbarians for Bishops: Tell me what has 
Mala∣bar
 to do with 
Babylon,
 and what correspondence is there betwixt the most pure Doctrine of Christ, which was preached to you by the great Apostle St. 
Thomas,
 and the barbarous Errours which were brought hither by 
Arabians
 and 
Chaldeans
 from 
Ba∣bylon;
 and from their Master the Apostate 
Nesto∣rius?
 Believe me, Brethren, these are they of whom St. 
Paul
 spoke in his Epistle to his Scholar 
Titus, That there should come Men teaching what they ought not to teach, for filthy lucre:
 And so it fell out for these Men, that they might not lose the Profits and Honours they were unjustly possessed of, did all they could to put into your

 heads that the Doctrine of St. 
Peter
 was different from that which had been taught you by St. 
Tho∣mas:
 It is true that the Doctrine of the Apostle St. 
Peter
 is contrary to the Heresies that have been brought hither from 
Babylon,
 but not what was preached here by St. 
Thomas:
 For what St. 
Tho∣mas,
 that also St. 
Peter
 taught, and Christ him∣self and all his other Disciples taught; for as St. 
Paul
 saith, 
there is one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, and one Church, of which Christ is the Head, and that on Earth St.
 Peter 
and his Suc∣cessors the Bishops of
 Rome: For that St. 
Peter
 and his Successors are the Head of the whole Church
 on Earth is plain from what Christ before his Passion promised St. 
Peter,
 as it is recorded in the 
16.
 Chap. of St. 
Matthew,
 where Christ, after having exa∣mined his Faith, said to him, 
Thou art
 Peter, 
and upon this Rock I will build my Church, and I will give thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,
 &c. Words which he spoke to
 none of the rest of the Apostles, but to St. 
Peter
 only. And St. 
John
 in the last Chapter of his Gospel tells us, That Christ, after his Resurrection, ha∣ving asked St. 
Peter
 if he loved him more than all other things, and, St. 
Peter
 had answered, that he knew very well that he did, said to him three several times, 
Feed my Lambs, feed my

 Lambs, feed my Sheep:
 By which words he made him the universal Pastor of his Sheep, and after him all the Bishops of 
Rome
 who were to succeed him in that Office; for Christ h
s but one Fold for all his Sheep, and one only Church: and so in the Creed that is sung in the Mass, we say, 
I be∣lieve in one Holy and Apostolical Church:
 and so Christ her Spouse said of his Church in the 
Canticles, My Dove, my perfect, is but one;
 that is to say, my Dove, my perfect, which is the Church, is but one: And St. 
John
 in his 
10th.
 Chapter tells us, that the Son of God speaking to his Disciples concerning his intent of calling the Gentiles to his Faith, said, 
I have other Sheep which are not of this Fold, whom I must bring in, that there may be one Fold and one Shep∣herd.
 Now that Fold wherein the Jews and Gen∣tiles were to concurr in one only Faith, is the Ca∣tholick Church, and that Shepherd was St. 
Peter,
 and all his Successors the Bishops of 
Rome;
 eve∣ry one of which as he is Bishop of 
Rome,
 is the universal Pastor of the
 whole Church of God, in∣somuch as that all who will not be subject to him, are not of the number of the Sheep of Christ, but are without the Fold of the Church, being Schis∣maticks and Hereticks, for such are all who are disobedient to the 
Roman
 Church; in which 
Ro∣man
 Church there never was nor will be any error

 in Faith, by reason of Christ's promise, who, as St. 
Luke
 reports, speaking to St. 
Peter,
 said to him; 
I have prayed for thee,
 Peter, 
that the
 
Faith of thy Church may never fail:
 The Faith of other particular Churches, as we have seen, may fail, but the Faith of the 
Roman
 Church has never failed nor never will. Wherefore, Bre∣thren, fasten your selves close to this firm Pillar of the 
Roman
 Church; against which, according to our Saviour's promises, 
the Gates of Hell shall never prevail;
 which Gates are the Heresies that are, and have been in the World: You ought there∣fore to render many thanks to God, for his having relieved you at this time, by sending you the Lord 
Arch-Bishop
 for a Spiritual Pastor and Master, who having left his Dwelling, and quiet is at all this Trouble, only for the sake of your Salvation, and to rescue you from the errors you have hither∣to lived in: For I know and am certain, that he is one of those Pastors which God spoke of by 
Jeremiah; And I will give you Pastors accor∣ding to my heart, and they shall feed you with Knowledge and Doctrine.
 Hitherto you have been fed with Errors and Ignorances, and your Pastors have sought gain, and not the Salvation of your Souls: This Pastor, as you see, does not come to take any of your Goods from you, but to spend his own for your profit, and to put you in the right way to Heaven and Salvation: From



 whence you may clearly perceive the great diffe∣rence there is betwixt him and those other Pastors, or to speak more properly, 
those Wolves,
 which you have had hitherto among you, as our Lord saith, 
in Sheeps cloathing.
 Hitherto your Errors have had some excuse, because you could know no more but what your Masters taught you; whereas from henceforward, you shall have no manner of excuse, neither before God nor Man, if you do not become such, as all that love you desire you to be. The Faith and Doctrine that has been preached to you by the Arch-Bishop, is the Faith of all the Chri∣stians in the 
Indies,
 and of all Clerks and Religi∣ous in these Parts, and which all 
Portugal, Spain,
 and in a word all
 Christendom holds. This is the Faith that was taught by the Son of God, the Faith that St. 
Thomas
 preached, and was preach∣ed also by St. 
Peter
 and the rest of the Apostles; and if any shall teach the contrary, 
let him be,
 as St. 
Paul
 saith, 
Anathema,
 and Excommunicated and expelled the Society of the Faithful, as he is from Christ, his Faith and Grace. The Lord give you a perfect knowledge of himself, as it is desired by your Brother in the Lord. Writ at 
Cochim
 the 
28th
 of 
June, 1599.


Your Brother in the Lord, Bishop 
FREY ANDRE.








The SYNOD'S Answer,


The Lord Assist Us.

To the most Illustrious and Reverend Lord 
Dom Andre,
 the most worthy Bishop of 
Cochim;
 The Diocesan Synod of the Christians of St. 
Thomas
 of the Bishoprick of the 
Serra,
 assembled in the Town of 
Diamper,
 wisheth eternal Health and Pro∣sperity in our Lord.


OƲr most Reverend 
Metropolitan
 ordered your most Illustrious 
Lordship's
 Letter to this Synod to be read in a full Assembly of the Priests and People; and having heard and understood it, we rejoiced exceedingly in the Lord, to perceive that the Holy Doctrine taught us by your 
Lordship,
 is the same with that our 
Metro∣politan
 has preached in all our Churches, and has declared in this Synod, as also the same that is preached by the Fathers all over this Diocess, by which means we are the more confirmed in the Catholick Faith, and the Obedience we owe to the Holy 
Roman
 Church, our true Mother, and to our Lord the 
Pope,
 the Successor of St. 
Peter,
 and Christ's Vicar upon Earth, as is manifest from the Acts of the said Synod, Signed by Ʋs, as your Lordship may see; and if we have hitherto been

 wanting to our Duty in these Matters, it did not proceed from any Obstinacy of Mind, or from any Inclination we had to be Hereticks, or Schismaticks, but purely for want of the Light of true Doctrine and healthful and Catholick Food, which was not given us by our Pre∣lates, but who did instead thereof, poyson us with the false Doctrines of 
Nestorius,
 and several other Errors; from which we are now, by the Divine Mercy, rescued; and by the goodness of God, and the Ministry of our 
Metropolitan,
 enlightened: from whence also rose the Rebellion which was made by us, when the Truth began to be first preached to us; as also all the Troubles and Vex∣ations that we gave to our 
Metropolitan,
 and the manifest Dangers we exposed him to; for all which we are now heartily sorry, and do dayly more and more lament it: But whereas God has been plea∣sed to enlighten us with his Doctrine, the 
Metro∣politan
 being discouraged by none of those things to go on preaching in our Churches, the light of the Truth coming to us by that means, we have cordially embraced, and have with an unanimous consent and great alacrity, made profession thereof in this Synod; having also put the Affairs of our Church in the best Order we were able, and sub∣mitting our selves to the Judgment of our 
Metro∣politan Mar Aleixo,
 who as our Master, has instructed us in all things: But whereas his Lord∣ship, after his Visitation of this Diocess is over, is to go to reside in his
 own Diocess, which we

 take notice of to our great Sorrow, by which means we shall want a Special Protection; we do therefore beg, that until such time as God shall be pleased to send the Pastor among us, which we expect from the Holy Apostolical See, your Lordship, as being the Prelate that lives nearest to us, and from whom and your Predecessors, this Church has re∣ceived so many Favors, would be pleased to take us under your protection, and to concern your self in all our Affairs, and to favour the Prelate, which the 
Metropolitan
 with his wonted kindness and benignity to his Flock, intends to leave among us. And seeing your most Illustrious 
Lordship
 in your Charity has been pleased to favour us with a Letter, we take confidence from thence, to beg of you, That whereas our Priests, both for their Spi∣ritual Consolation, and other Necessities, do frequent∣ly resort to your City and several parts of your Diocess, where it will be necessary for them to say Mass, which they have hitherto been hindred from doing, by reason of their not being in a perfect Ʋnion with the Holy Mother Church of 
Rome;
 we now being in such an Ʋnion, as much as can be desired, the Synod doth humbly beseech your

 Lordship that you would be pleased to give leave to such of our Priests as have a Licence from our Prelate to say Mass in your Churches, at least the 
Roman
 translated into 
Syrian,
 that it may ap∣pear thereby that we are all one in the Ʋnity of one only Catholick Church; and that the division which Satan had made betwixt us, and most other Chur∣ches is at an end, all Churches making one one∣ly Catholick Church, as your Lordship has clear∣ly taught us, as a vigilant Pastor, in your learned Letter. The Lord preserve your 
Lordship's
 most Illustrious Person, and prolong your Years, for the good of the Church and the profit of the Sheep of Christ.

Diamper

 Praise be to God.














A Preface to a MISSAL.




The 
Mass
 that is henceforth to be used by the ancient Christians of St. 
Thomas
 of the Bishoprick of 
Angamale
 in the 
Serra
 of 
Malabar,
 in the 
East-Indies,
 purged of the 
Nestorian
 Errors and Blasphemies it abounded with, by the most Illustrious and Reverend 
Dom Frey Aleixo De Menezes,
 Arch-Bi∣shop of 
Goa,
 and Primate of the 
Indies,
 at the time when he reduced them to the Obedi∣ence of the Holy 
Roman
 Church. Translated word for word out of 
Syriack
 or 
Syrian,
 into 
Latin.




AMong the other things which the most Reverend Arch-Bishop of 
Goa,
 and Primate of the 
Indies, Dom Frey Aleixo de Menezes,
 put in Order in the 
Diocesan
 Synod, assembled by him in the Bishop∣rick of 
Angamale
 of the 
Serra
 of 
Malabar,


 of the Christians of St. 
Thomas,
 in which he purged the Church of the 
Nestorian
 Heresies, and reduced it to the Obedience of the Holy 
Roman
 Church; one of the chief was the reforming the 
Syrian
 Mass, which was said in the 
Chaldee
 Tongue in this Bishoprick, which having been com∣posed or inlarged by 
Nestorian
 Hereticks, was full of Errors and Blasphemies both in the Prayers and Commemorations of 
Nestorius, Theodorus,
 and 
Diodorus,
 and se∣veral other 
Nestorian
 Hereticks, to whom as to Saints, they prayed, for to intercede for them: And whereas this People was in a profound Ignorance, nay the very Bishops, who came from 
Babylon,
 not knowing the true Form of Consecration, all of them adding to it and taking from it at their pleasure; there being no certain particular Form of Consecration among them, un∣til a certain Arch-Bishop came who had more knowledge than the rest in Eccle∣siastical Matters, and the Holy Scriptures; who perceiving that the Form wherewith they Consecrated, contained in it some

 Errors, contrary to the Truth of the Di∣vine Sacrament, did establish the true Form, adding some words to it, both in the Consecration of the Body and Blood, in contradiction to the Error and Heresie of those who say that the Sacrament is 
only the Figure of the Body of Christ our Lord.
 From whence it is more than probable, the Hereticks of our Times, the revivers of the Errors of all the ancient condem∣ned Sects, took this Opinion: The Form established by the forementioned Arch-Bi∣shop, was, 
This is in truth my Body; this is in truth the Cup of my Blood, which was shed for you and for many, for the propitia∣tion and remission of your Sins; and this shall be a Pledge to you for ever and ever;
 in which Form they have now Consecrated for several Years. But the most Reve∣rend Arch-Bishop Primate, having remo∣ved the words that are not necessary, e∣stablished the proper Form used in the Catholick Church, as it is in the 
Roman Missal,
 laying aside divers and Sacrilegious and ignorant Ceremonies also, which sig∣nified

 some Heresies and Errors that were amongst them: And having thus refor∣med their 
Mass,
 he continued it however in its ancient Form, until such time as he had consulted the Apostolical 
See
 about it, to know what our Lord the Pope would determine in that Matter; many of the emendations are noted in the Synod, 
Dec.
 10. 
Act.
 5. of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, and in the Action of Matters of Faith, where they are to be seen; I shall here present the Curious only with the 
Mass
 re∣formed, and as its said among them at this time.




I
 Have Published this 
Preface
 for the sake of the Testimony that is therein, of this Church's not having believed 
Transubstantiation,
 but have forbore to Print the 
Missal
 it belongs to, because it is the 
Missal
 that was imposed upon this Church by Arch-Bishop 
Menezes,
 or their Old 
Missal,
 so altered and mangled by him, as to be truly what Father 
Simon
 calls it, 
A confused indigested Office, and withal very tedious.




FINIS.
