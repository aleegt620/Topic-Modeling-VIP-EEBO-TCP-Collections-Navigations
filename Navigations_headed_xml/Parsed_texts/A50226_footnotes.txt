"On p. 24-43 ("Some grounds of the war against the Pequots", and "A brief history of the war with the Pequot Indians in New-England; anno 1637") Mather printed a manuscript sent to him by John Allyn of Hartford who is accredited with the authorship of it. It was, however, John Mason's narrative, which was first separately edited and published by Thomas Prince in 1736 as "A brief history of the Pequot War". Mather made use of another manuscript history of that war, found in the library of Rev. Mr. Davenport, but not now identified.--NUC pre-1956 imprints.
