THE Present State OF HUNGARY: OR An Historical, and Geographical Description of that Kingdom.




CHAP. I.




 Of its Names, Bounds, Division, Ri∣vers, Lakes and Mountains.




THE Kingdom of 
Hungary,
 belonging by Right to the House of 
Austria,
 but, in a great part, invaded and

 usurped by the 
Turks,
 lies betwixt the 39. and 47. degree of Longitude, and from the 45. to the 49. of North Lati∣tude, or thereabouts: It is part of the Ancient 
Pannonia,
 called 
Magiar
 by the 
Turks; Wegierska,
 by the 
Sclavoni∣ans; Hungerland,
 by the 
Germans; On∣garia,
 by the 
Italians
 and 
Spaniards; Hongrie,
 by the 
French;
 and 
Hungary
 by the 
English.


The Bounds of it are 
Transilvania
 to the East; 
Poland
 and 
Russia
 to the North; 
Moravia, Austria
 and 
Styria
 to the West; and 
Servia
 and 
Bosnia
 to the South.


The Figure of this Kingdom is square, its Corners looking to the four parts of the World.


It is divided into the Upper and Lower 
Hungary;
 the Upper is on the side of the 
Danube,
 towards 
Poland
 and 
Transilvania;
 and the Lower on the other side of the same River.


Heretofore it contained above Sea∣venty Counties, but at present it has only about fifty; whereof before this last War Twenty six were subject to the 
Ottoman
 Tyranny. It may be also divided into the part held by the Em∣perour,

 and that which is under the 
Turkish
 Dominion.


Its chief Rivers are, the 
Raab,
 the 
Wag,
 the 
Gran,
 the 
Teisse,
 the 
Sarvilise,
 which comes out of the lake 
Balathon,
 and the 
Donau.
 The less considerable are the 
Newsidl
r, Reckzkerle,
 and some others.


The highest Mountains of 
Hungary
 are the 
Carpathian
 Mountains, towards 
Poland
 and 
Transilvania.
 The richest are betwixt 
Buda
 and 
Strigonium,
 which have Mines affording excellent Mettals, and especially Quick-silver.






CHAP. II.




 Of the Country of 
Hungary,
 and its Inhabitants.




THE Air of this Country is un∣wholesom, and especially to Stran∣gers; and it is observed to engender a great deal of Vermine. The Waters, excepting that of the 
Danube,
 are not good, and the Author 
de Mirabilibus Hungariae
 observes, that there are Foun∣tains

 in 
Hungary,
 whose Waters are Poysonous, which increase and dimi∣nish with the Moon, and are quite dried up when that Luminary is in the Full. There are other Fountains in it also, that turn into Stone any thing that is cast into them; others which are hot in Winter, and freeze in Sum¦mer; and others whose Waters are sowrish, salt, 
&c.
 There are in i
 also several Mines of Salt, Gold, Sil¦ver, Copper, Steel and Iron. Th
 Soil is very fruitful, in so much, tha
 some have thought, that 
Hungary
 alone was sufficient to furnish all 
Europe
 with Corn. Its Pasturages are wonderful and so great is the plenty of Wild Beasts and Fowl, of Fish and Cattle that the Country People live for mos
 part on the Flesh of Wild Boars an
 Venison. An hundred Carps hav
 been sold there for a 
Noble;
 and i
 hath been observed, that in one yea
 above Fourscore thousand Oxen hav
 been brought from thence into 
Germa¦ny.
 The 
Hungarians
 are Warlike, bu
 cruel, proud, revengeful, and so i
 united together, that it is no wonde
 they have been a Prey to the 
Barbar
¦ans.


 They speak several Languages, and especially 
Latin,
 which is very familiar to them; the Gentry are magnificent, and all great Lovers of Horses, Hunting and good Chear. The 
Hungarians
 love not the 
Germans;
 yet the Nobility adhere to the House of 
Austria,
 to secure themselves from the Oppression of the 
Turks,
 who va∣lue a Peasant as much as a Gentleman. The strength of the Country consists in light Horse-Men. The Troopers there are called 
Hussars,
 and the Foot 
Heydukes.






CHAP. III.




 Of the Princes and Nations, who have made any Progress in 
Hungary.




THE first of the 
Romans
 that made any Progress in 
Hungary
 was 
Julius Coesar,
 other Captains con∣tinued them after him, untill the time of 
Tiberius,
 who entirely subjected that Kingdom. Afterwards upon the Fall of the 
Roman
 Empire, the 
Goths


 seiz'd it, and that Kingdom became Prey to the 
Huns
 and 
Lombards,
 who were driven out by the former in th
 eighth Century. For certain crue
 People of 
Scythia,
 called 
Hongres,
 tha
 lived only on Blood, possessed them selves of all that Country, which a
 present we call 
Hungary.
 They who treat of 
Hungary,
 reckon 
Balamir
 o
 
Balamber
 amongst the Kings of tha
 Countrey; he reigned fifty six years and had a Son 
Mundsur
 or 
Mundiaque
 who died before his Father. 
Aptar
 i
 also reckoned amongst those Kings and the two Brothers, 
Bleda,
 killed in the Year, 444. and 
Attila,
 called the Scourge of God, who died in the year 453. His Children made a cruel Wa
 against one another, and lost the Con¦quests of their Father. The 
Huns
 made another Irruption into 
Pannonia,
 about the Year 744. under the Conduct o
 one named 
Amie,
 who had 
Arphad
 for his Successor. These gave the name to 
Hungary. Sultan,
 one of the issue of that 
Arphad,
 was, as it is said, the Father of 
Toxa
 or 
Toxis,
 and this Man begot 
Geiza,
 the Father of St. 
Stephen,
 with whom I shall begin the Chrono∣logical

 Succession of the Kings of 
Hun∣gary.
 He was Crowned in the year, 1000. or 1020. according to others. Since that time the 
Hungarians
 had Kings, who governed them peaceably▪ enough, until after the Death of 
Loüis,
 called the Great, whose Daughter and Heiress 
Marie
 was Married to the Em∣perour 
Sigismond
 of 
Luxemburg;
 but his Government displeasing them, they called in 
Charles de Duras
 King of 
Na∣ples,
 and 
Stephen,
 Vaivod of 
Transilva∣nia,
 who had his recourse to 
Bajazet
 the First, Emperour of the 
Turks;
 from thence began the Miseries of that Kingdom, which since the year 1394. hath been always almost the seat of War, and became a Prey to the 
Turks;
 and especially under 
Amurath, Solyman,
 and others. The Kingdom of 
Hun∣gary
 is partly possessed by the House of 
Austria,
 and partly by the 
Infidels.
 The former rendred it Hereditary af∣ter the Death of 
Loüis
 the Young, who perished at the Battle of 
Mohacs,
 in the year 1526. 
John de Zapol,
 Count of 
Scepua,
 was saluted King by part of the 
Hungarians,
 and 
Ferdinand
 of 
Austria
 by the rest, who carried it

 from his Competitor. The Estates of this Kingdom are divided into four Bodies. 1. The Clergy. 2. The Ba∣rons. 3. The Nobles. 4. The Roy∣al and Free Towns. The Religion of it is divided, and the Manners of the People odd. The 
Hungarians
 were converted to the Faith by 
Gisle
 Sister to St. 
Henry,
 who married their King St. 
Stephen.

Hungary.

CHAP. VI.




 Of the Towns of 
Upper Hungary
 and their Description.




THE Kingdom of 
Hungary,
 as we have said, is divided into the 
Up∣per
 and 
Lower Hungary,
 the Towns of the 
Upper Hungary,
 are these that follow.




PRESBOURG.


This Town lies upon the 
Danube,
 and is the Capital City of the 
Upper Hungary,
 and of all that belongs to the Emperor within that Kingdom. It gives it's Name to a County, which is a Province of 
Hungary,
 betwixt 
Mo∣ravia, Austria,
 and the 
Danube;
 the Latin Authors call it 
Posonium
 and 
Flex∣um,
 and those of the Country, 
Poson.
 This place is eight Leagues from 
Vien∣na
 in 
Austria,
 and as far from 
Newheu∣sel
 and 
Comorra;
 it is Fortified with a considerable Castle against the Incur∣sions

 of the 
Turks,
 which is mention∣ed by the Author of the 
German
 Itine∣rary in this manner. 
Lib.
 5.


Hic ubi Posonium consurgit turribus altis,


Limes Teutonicis, Hungariisque viris.


The Authors of the 
Hungarian
 Histo∣ry, which are bound up in one Vo∣lume, speak of 
Presbourg,
 as well as 
Cluverius, Ortelius
 and 
Samson;
 it hath the Title of an Arch-Bishoprick, and in the Cathedral-Church, which is partly possessed by the Fathers Jesuits, the Body of St. 
John
 Bishop of 
Alex∣andra
 is held in great Veneration.


Pope 
Clement
 the Fifth being inform∣ed that the 
Hungarians
 were in Arms, and would not submit to 
Charles Mar∣tel,
 Son to 
Charles
 II. King of 
Naples,
 thought himself obliged to send a Le∣gat thither, either for composing these Disorders, or strengthening the Party of the Lawful Soveraign. For that effect he pitched upon 
Gentil de Monteffiore,
 whose Merit had raised him from a Franciscan Frier to the Dignity of a Cardinal, and who ac∣quitted

 himself extraordinarily well in his Commission. At first he used all ways of Mildness; but finding them to be unprofitable, he employed Ec∣clesiastical Censures, and reclaimed the 
Hungarians
 to their Duty. He ce∣lebrated a Council at 
Presbourg,
 in the year 1309. Where sound Cannons were made; which were afterwards approved by the Pope. In this Town there are a great many Houses built after the 
Italian
 manner, which con∣tribute much to the Beauty thereof.






NITRIA.


Nitria
 or 
Nitracht,
 a Town in the 
Upper Hungary,
 is the Seat of a Bishop, Suffragan to the Arch-bishop of 
Gran,
 and has it's Name from the River it lyes upon, which it gives to a Coun∣ty, whereof it is the Capital: It is un∣der the Jurisdiction of 
Newheusel,
 be∣ing five Leagues distant from it, and ten from 
Presbourg,
 and continued al∣ways subject to the Emperour.








NEWHEUSEL.


The people of the Country call it 
Owar,
 and the Latin Authors 
Neoseli∣um;
 it lyes upon the River of 
Nitria,
 or 
Nitrach,
 two Leagues from 
Comor∣ra
 upon the 
Danube:
 It is but a small Town, but very well seated, and the chief Town of a large Country; the 
Turks
 took it in the year 1663. And the Emperours Army having invested it the seventh of 
July,
 1685. Re∣took it the nineteenth of 
August
 fol∣lowing.






NOVIGRAD.


A little Town with a Castle upon a Hill, the Capital of the County of the same name, lying on the 
Danube,
 betwixt 
Gran
 and 
Vachia.






VACHIA.


Vatzen
 or 
Veitzen,
 and in Latin 
Vac∣cia,
 is a Town lying upon the 
Danube,
 betwixt 
Novigrad
 and 
Pest,
 and the Seat of a Bishop, Suffragan to 
Gran.








CASSOVIA.


This Town by the 
Hungarians
 is called 
Caschow,
 the Capital of the County of 
Abauwiver.
 It is very well fortified, and lyes upon the River of 
Kunnert,
 which falls into the 
Teiss
 five or six Leagues from the Carpatian or Crapat Mountains, betwixt 
Esperies
 and 
Borsanick.
 And though it be a free Town, and have considerable Pri∣viledges, yet it hath always acknow∣ledged the Emperor as King of 
Hunga∣ry,
 till of late, being engaged in the Rebellion of 
Teckely,
 it was forced to return to the Emperor it's Lawful So∣veraign in the year, 1685.






FILLECK.


Was formerly a strong Town of the Imperial 
Hungary,
 lying five Lea∣gues to the North of 
Agria,
 and as far to the West of 
Cassovia,
 upon the River 
Gayenne,
 in the County of 
Zabel;
 it was reduced under the power of 
Teckely,
 and it's Fortifications demo∣lished.








ESPERIES.


In Latin 
Eperiae
 is a very well forti∣fied Town in the County of 
Sarax
 in 
Hungary,
 lying upon the River of 
Tar∣bez,
 towards the Mountains and upon the Frontiers of 
Poland:
 It always be∣longed to the Emperor as King of 
Hungary,
 till it was involved in the Rebellion of 
Teckely,
 from whom it was retaken by the Imperial Arms in the year, 1685.






AGRIA.


This Town by the 
Germans
 is cal∣led, 
Eger,
 and by the 
Hungarians, Er∣law,
 lying upon a River of the same Name: It is but a small place, hut ex∣traordinarily well fortified, and hath always been the Seat of a Bishop, Suf∣fragan to the Arch-bishop of 
Strigoni∣um,
 and the Bulwark of Christendom, and therefore it was Besieged, but in vain, by the Army of 
Solyman:
 But at length, 
Mahomet
 the Third carried it the 12. of 
October,
 1596. Since that time it hath been in the hands of the

 
Turks,
 who keep a strong Garison in it. Three Leagues from this Town the River of 
Agria
 falls into the 
Tyssa
 or 
Teisse,
 which is the 
Tibiscus
 of the Latins. In the year 1552. the 
Turks
 first besieged 
Agria,
 with an Army of Threescore and ten thousand Men. It was then no strong place, neither by Nature nor Art; and yet the Cou∣rage of the Garison supplied the Weak∣ness of the place. There were within it Two thousand 
Hungarians,
 and Three∣score of the chief Gentlemen of the Country, who brought thither their Wives, Children, and all their Goods. They all took an Oath, that they would suffer the utmost Extremity, ra∣ther than render the place; they put all their Provision into publick stores, and when the 
Turks
 summoned them to render the place, they put out a Cof∣fin upon the Battlements of the Walls, to shew that they had resolved to die, rather than to yield. The Town was for Forty days time incessantly Batter∣ed with Fifty pieces of Cannon; but all that daunted not the Besieged. Nay the 
Turks
 having made three Assaults in one day, were still beaten off, and

 lost Eight thousand men. Above all things the Valour of the Women was conspicious in so bloody an Action. One of them was fighting in presence of her Mother and Husband, who was killed hard by her, and her Mother bidding her carry off the Body and Bury it: God forbid, answered she, that I should Bury my Husband be∣fore I revenge his death: and with that snatching up the Buckler and Sword of her dead Husband, she threw her self into the midst of the Enemy's, and left not off Fighting till she had revenged the death of her Husband by the slaughter of three 
Turks.
 Ano∣ther Woman carrying a great stone to cast down upon the Enemy, was shot with a Canon Bullet, that carried off her head. Her Daughter who fol∣lowed her, without standing to be∣wail her loss, took up the stone, and all bloody as it was with her Mo∣thers Blood, threw it down upon a croud of the Enemy, who endeavour∣ed to mount the Wall. The 
Turks
 be∣ing Witnesses of such obstinate Reso∣lution, raised the Siege the Nineteenth of 
October;
 and the Besieged sallying

 out after them, cut to pieces a great number of the Infidels, and took most of their Baggage.






TOKAY.


A very strong Town with a Cita∣del upon the River 
Bodroch,
 that falls in∣to the 
Teisse.
 This Town lying in form of an Island, was taken by the 
Turks,
 and afterwards regained by the Em∣perors Army; but falling into the hands of the Rebel 
Teckely,
 his Impe∣rial Majesty retook it in the year, 1685. to whom it belongs at pre∣sent. This Town is Subject to Inun∣dations, and yet the Land about it is very Fertile, and bears excellent Wine called by that name. Below it the Ri∣ver of 
Bodroch,
 running by

 it is Rich, Populous, and of great Commerce and Traffick; upon the humble desire of the Inhabitants, it was received into the Protection of his Imperial Majesty, after the Reduction of 
Zolnock,
 and 
Cassovia:
 It continued

 Neuter during the late Revolutions in 
Hungary,
 and sided not with the Re∣bels, allowing always Liberty, as well to the Judges there established by the Emperour, as to the Commissioner of the Port, to Exercise their Authority in it.






GIULA.


This Town lies betwixt the Rivers of 
Sebeskeres
 and 
Feyerkeres,
 upon the Lake of 
Zarkad,
 a few Leagues be∣low great 
Waradin,
 upon the Frontier of 
Transilvania;
 as yet it belongs to the 
Turk.






ZOLNOCK.


This Town lyes upon the River of 
Teisse,
 where the River of 
Zagiwa
 joins it: It is the chief Town of the same name, and strongly fortified, having long groaned under the 
Turkish
 Yoke; it lyes fourty Leagues to the West of 
Waradin,
 and sixty from 
Bu∣da.
 This Fortress was taken by the 
Baron de Mercy,
 Lieutenant-Marshal 
de
 Camp, and by the Sr. 
Heusler
 one of

 the Emperor's Generals, in the Month of 
October,
 1685.

 on the Frontiers of 
Tran∣silvania,
 and the Capital of the County of the same Name; it belongs to the Emperour, and is ten Leagues North∣ward of

Tokay.






ZARAVAS.


This is a Modern Fortress built by the 
Turks,
 since the breaking out of the Rebellion, which 
Emersi
 Count of 
Teckely
 raised in this Kingdom: It lyes upon the River of 
Kiros,
 which falls into the 
Teysse,
 five 
German
 Leagues from 
Zolnock,
 and twelve from 
Giula;
 but the situation of it is not as yet de∣scribed in the Maps: By the Conquest of this place, two Counties that de∣pend on it have been gained, which before the Rebellion held not of his Imperial Majesty; the one is called the County of the 
Tarantali∣ans,


 and the other of the 
Czongradi∣ans.






MONGATZ.


A Fort with a very strong Castle seated on the River 
Torza,
 betwixt 
Ungwar
 and 
Zatmar
 near the Moun∣tains; it hath been a place of Retreat to the Rebel Count 
Teckely,
 as it was before to Prince 
Ragotzi.
 The Coun∣tess of 
Teckely, Aurora Veronica
 Daugh-to the late Count 
Peter Serine,
 and be∣fore Widdow of the said Prince, still delays to render it to the Emperor, as being uncertain what will become of her Husband. In the mean time it is straitly blocked up by the Imperial Forces.






TEMESWAR.


A great and strong Town upon the River of 
Temes,
 towards the Fron∣tiers of 
Transilvania;
 it is the chief Town of a P
ovince of that Name, which has the Title of a County. The 
Turk
 hath subdued both the Town and Country.








WARADIN.


This Town which is called 
Great Waradin,
 lying on the 
Drave,
 was of the Ancient 
Dacia,
 and is at present in 
Transilvania.


It is situated to the South of the lit∣tle River of 
Keuvres,
 which others call 
Sobeskeres,
 and the Ancients 
Chrisus,
 that has its Source in one of the Branches of the 
Carpathian
 Mountains, from whence it seems to wash away, and bring along with its Sand little Spangles of Gold.


In the year 1242. the 
Tartars
 made themselves Masters of that Town, and used great Cruelties i
 
t, putting most of the Inhabitants to the Sword, with∣out distinction of Age or Sex.


In the year 1290. 
Ladislaus
 King of 
Hungary,
 built in it the fair Church of our Lady, which is the Seat of a Suf∣fragan Bishop.


This Town having a strong Cita∣del, is fortified with five Bastions; and the 
Turks
 looking upon it as a fa∣vourable Post, for enlarging their Con∣quests on the side of 
Transilvania,
 sent

 first in the year, 1598. a powerful Army under the command of 
Omar,
 who besieged it in the month of 
Sep∣tember;
 but after may Cruel and Bloody Attacks on both sides, the 
Turks
 were forced to raise the Siege on the third of 
November:
 How∣ever in 1660. they took it, and made it a place of Arms against Christendom.


This place is the usual Residence of a 
Sangiack,
 who depends on the 
Beglerbey
 of 
Themeswar:
 And here it was, that Count 
Emery of Teckely,
 was surprised and seized by the Bassa of the place, and sent to the Grand Visier at 
Adria∣nople
 in Chains. This was a great Transformation of him, who put in his Standard that was taken in the month of 
September,
 1684. by General 
Schultz
 at the Battle near 
Esperies;
 his own Arms beset with two Lions 
Or,
 and two 
Argent
 holding in their claws a Shable, cleaving the Imperial Eagle in two, and over-head a Ducal Coronet, with a device in Latin and Sclavonick, of, Protector in 
Hungary:
 But alas!


Quem veniens superbum


dies vidit


Hunc fugiens jacentem








GUTTA.


This Town is very well Fortified at that place, where the River of 
Waag
 discharges it self into the 
Danube;
 it was Built since the last Wars, in a Fen∣ny place betwixt a branch of the 
Da∣nube,
 the 
Waag
 and the 
Swatrz.
 It is a Mile distant from 
Newheusel,
 and from the top of the Church of 
Gutta,
 one may see the Town of 
Newheu∣sel,
 and even distinguish the several Houses.






SCHINTA.


Esteemed a very strong place, long since Built to command the River, and all the Country about; it hath a Tower in the middle, with four Ba∣stions, and several great Guns.






TIRNAW.


Is a Town lying in an open Coun∣trey, and may be seen at a great di∣stance; within these seven years it was reduced to Ashes, and is now almost intirely Re-built.








TOPOLCHAN.


This Town lyes upon the Banks of the River of 
Nitra,
 and was burnt down with its Church during the late Wars, and could never be Built again since.






LEOPOLD.


This Town was Built after the loss of 
Newheusel,
 and much in the same Figure; it hath six very Regular Ba∣stions, and well covered, lying West∣ward of the River of 
Waag,
 and exact∣ly opposite to 
Freistadt:
 It is not ve∣ry far from the place, through which the 
Tartars
 went in the late War, when they ravaged a great part of that Coun∣try, and made many Slaves, as they did also in 
Moravia.
 It was begun to be fortified in the year, 1665.






FREISTADT.


Is a very pretty Town, but the 
Turks
 not long since burnt it: The Count of 
Forchatz,
 has a lovely Castle and a

 stately House in it, and the 
Capucins
 a Convent.






TRENSCHEIN.


Is a very fair Town lying upon the side of the River of 
Waag,
 over which it hath a Wooden Bridge: The Mar∣ket place of it is very pretty, the Je∣suits Church lovely, and the Castle very high; it is seen at a great di∣stance, and belongs to Count 
Illeshazi.
 There are a great many Springs of Mineral Waters, in all the Country a∣bout it.






SERNOWITZ.


Is a Town lying upon the River of 
Gran,
 having a Castle built upon a Rock.






NEWSOL.


Is a pretty neat Town, lying upon the River of 
Gran;
 at the end of it there is a very lovely Tower, and the Castle well deserves to be seen; be∣cause there is a Church within it co∣vered

 with Copper, wherein are a great many fair Wooden Statues, and some Relicks. It hath a Bridge over the River, with a handsome pile of Building, made to stop the Timber that is thrown into the River, ten Miles above the Town in the Country, that is all covered with Wood. By that means Wood is conveyed to 
Newsol
 without much trouble and cha
ges, which is made use of for Working in the Copper Mines that are in the Town: It was taken by 
Bethlem Ga∣bor
 Prince of 
Transilvania,
 who making use of the Occasion of the Revolt of the 
Bohemians,
 and of his Alliance which they demanded, fell into 
Hun∣gary
 and took many places in it. Before this Town of 
Newsol,
 the brave Count 
Charles of Bucquoy,
 Knight of the Gol∣den Fleece, being General of the Im∣perial Army, found his Bed of Ho∣nor; for having retaken the Towns of 
Presbourg, Tirnaw, Altenbourg,
 and others, and encamping before 
New∣sol,
 where he Valliantly carried on the Siege in the year, 1621. he was kil∣led in a Sally in the Month of 
July
 that year, after he had received Six∣teen

 Mortal Wounds. The following Inscription was made to his Me∣mory.

ALTSOL.


Is a Town lying upon the same River of 
Gran,
 lower than 
Newsol,
 betwixt it and the Town of 
Crem∣nitz.






HERN-GRUNDT.


Is a little Town standing on a pretty high Ground, though it be betwixt two

 Hills. The place it stands on goes by the same Name, and is but a mile from 
Newsol.






SCHEMNITZ.


The biggest of all the Towns in 
Hungary,
 where there are Mines, and in it there is a great deal of Silver found daily. The Town is very well built, hath three fair Churches, and most part of the Inhabitants are 
Lu∣therans.
 It hath also three Castles; the first is the old Castle, that stands in the Town; where one may hear pretty pleasant Musick, at six of the Clock in the morning, and six at night, which is performed by means of an Engine that they have found out. The second is the new Castle, built by a Lady, who caused the Gibbet that stood upon a Hill to be removed, and a stately Fabrick to be erected in place of it. The third is upon the top of a very high Hill, where there is always a Sentinel to discover the approach of the 
Turks,
 and to give notice of it by firing a great Gun. The Streets lye upwards and downwards upon the side

 of the Hill, and all the Country is ve∣ry uneven.






CREMNITZ.


This is but a very little Town, but hath large Suburbs, and stands on ve∣ry high Ground. It is thought that St. 
John
's Church, which is pretty near it, is built on the highest Ground of all 
Hungary:
 It is the ancientest of all the Towns where Mines are, and is also the richest of all the seven, which are called 
Schemnitz, Cremnitz, New∣sol, Koninsbergs, Bochantz, Libeten,
 and 
Tiln.






VIROVICHITZ.


Lying before the Isle of St. 
Andrew,
 is a place in high Esteem, for the love∣ly Vines and good Grapes that grow there. Near it there is a demolished Stone Building, upon the side of the Isle of St. 
Andrew,
 where it is said, that heretofore there was a Stone Bridge.








MAROS.


Is on the other side of 
Vicegrad,
 near the Isle of St. 
Andrew.
 It hath a very lovely Church, and being a place that heretofore yielded voluntarily to the 
Turks,
 the 
Christians
 are not much tormented there; but only pay a yearly Tribute of very small Conse∣quence.






PEST.


On the other side of the 
Danube
 to∣wards the East, is the Town of 
Pest,
 that is square and seated in a very lovely Plain: it looks very pretty from 
Buda,
 because of its Walls and the Towers of its 
Mosques.
 It gives the Name to all the Countrey about, which therefore is called, 
Comitatus Pesthiensis,
 the County of 
Pest;
 for 
Hungary
 is divided into Counties as well as 
England.
 Betwixt this place and 
Buda
 there is a fair Bridge of 
Boats,
 at least half a mile over; it hath been taken and re-taken, whereby it is much ruined, and the Town of 
Buda
 which

 is over against it standing on an Emi∣nence, whereas this lies in a Plain, so commands it, that it can batter it down with great Guns; unless on the side of the Gate of 
Agria,
 which is covered by the Town. The 
Imperial
 Forces took it in the year 1684. when they invested 
Buda;
 but quitting that Siege they also abandoned 
Pest;
 though now in this present year 1686. they have again made themselves Masters of it.






HADWAN.


Lies upon the 
Zagywe
 to the North of 
Pest,
 and fortifyed with Earth, but not so as that the 
Turks
 repose great assurance on it: It was taken by the 
Christians
 in the year 1596. but after∣wards abandoned to the 
Turks
 in the year 1603. and is not above six Leagues from 
Pest.


To close up the Description of the Towns of Upper 
Hungary,
 I shall sub∣join the 
Latin Epigram,
 made upon the Revolt of the Towns that espoused the Party of 
Teckely.








EPIGRAMMA.
 In septem Superioris Hungariae For∣talitia Duce Teckelio Caesari Rebellantia.


CAstrorum septem crudelis & impia tellus


Quid Dominum contra perfida colla levas?


Oblita es famulam, saltem te agnosce pa∣rentem:


Hic tibi, ni Princeps esset, alumnus erat.


Divitiisnè tumes? cecidit Campania dives.


An populo? Marathon millia quanta premit.


Sed tibi fortè animos perjurus proditor auget,


Aspice quàm stultum stulta sequare Ducem.


Sit licet ille ferox, & sit bellare peritus,


Sit licet ille potens, improba causa sua est.


Vincitur ut causâ, pariter vincetur & Ar∣mis,


Bella placent justo non nisi justa Deo.










CHAP. VII.




 Of the Towns of Lower 
Hungary.






BUDA.


BEfore the 
Turks
 invaded 
Hungary,
 the City of 
Buda
 was the 
Metro∣polis
 of the Kingdom; the Ancients called it 
Curta,
 and the 
Germans Offen.


It is divided into the Upper and Lower Town, lying upon the side of a Hill, the Foot whereof is washed by the 
Danube,
 which at that place is a∣bove half a mile over: It hath a Bridge of Boats over it, that joins the City of 
Buda,
 to the little Town of 
Pest,
 ly∣ing on the opposite side. In 
Buda
 are to be seen the Ruines of several stately Palaces, built heretofore by 
Matthias Corvinus
 King of 
Hungary,
 and his Predecessours; which the 
Turks
 neg∣lect, and let fall into decay.




This is a large, fair, and well built Town, but ill peopled, and hath hard∣ly any Inhabitants, but the 
Spahies
 and 
Janisaries
 of the Garrison, which is al∣ways very numerous.


After the Death of 
John Zapol,
 Count of 
Scepus
 and 
Elba
 King of 
Hungary,
 his Widow 
Elisabeth
 of 
Po∣land
 and his Son 
Stephen,
 called in the 
Turks
 to their Assistance, against 
Ferdi∣nand
 of 
Austria,
 who was elected King. The 
Germans
 besieged 
Buda,
 and the 
Turks
 having defeated them, made themselves Masters of the Town under pretext of Friendship, sending the Queen, her Son, and 
George Martinisius,
 who had been chief Minister to the late King, into 
Transilvania.


This Town is the Residence of a 
Beglerbey,
 whose Authority extends o∣ver twenty 
Sangiacks.
 The 
Bassa
 of 
Buda
 hath more Authority than the others have, and the Garrison consists commonly of eight or ten Thousand Men. Some take it to be the 
Curta
 of 
Ptolomy,
 and others for the 
Aguincum
 of the Itinerary of 
Antonine.
 It is ve∣ry hard to be positive as to that, and all that can be said are but Conje∣ctures.

 But it is a Fable, that the Brother of 
Attila
 built it, and called it by his Name 
Budaeus:
 For that Bro∣ther of 
Attila
 was named 
Bleda,
 and not 
Budaeus,
 as the Fabulous pretend.


Solyman
 rendered himself Master of 
Buda
 the 20eth. of 
August,
 1526. and in the year 1527. 
Ferdinand
 I. King of 
Bohemia,
 Brother to the Emperour 
Charles
 V. after the overthrow of 
Loüis
 the Young, in the Plain of 
Mohacz,
 was proclaimed King of 
Hungary,
 by 
Stephen Bathori
 Palatin of the Kingdom, and by the sounder part of the Nobi∣lity; 
John Zapoliha,
 Vaivod of 
Tran∣silvania,
 having been before tumultua∣rily elected by the rest.


The same year, 
Ferdinand
 made himselt Master of the greatest part of the Kingdom, and of 
Buda
 the Capi∣tal City, of which he made 
Thomas Nadasti
 Governour; until the year 1529. that 
Solyman
 took it by the Trea∣chery of the Garrison, and shortly af∣ter laid siege to 
Vienna,
 which he was forced shamefully to raise, after he had made many B
oody Assaults.




From whence, retreating to 
Buda,
 he re-established 
John
 Vaivod of 
Tran∣silvania
 in the Kingdom; having left in 
Buda, Gritti,
 a Renegado, with three Thousand 
Janisaries,
 to defend it in Name of the Vaivod.


Afterwards 
Ferdinand
 King of 
Bohe∣mia,
 made General 
Rogendorf
 besiege it, in the year 1530. but in vain.


In the year 1540. he commanded his General 
Leonard Fessius
 to Besiege it a second time, having first possest himself of the Forts of 
Vicegrad, Vac∣cia,
 and 
Pest;
 and 
John Zapoliha
 be∣ing dead the year before, who left for his Successor 
John Sigismond,
 a Pupil under the tuition of the Princess 
Isabel
 his Mother, and 
George Monck;
 but 
Fessius
 having there endured the fati∣gues of a long and troublesom Siege, was again obliged to draw off.


In the year, 1541. General 
Rogen∣dorf
 renewed the Siege again a Third time; but upon the coming of 
Soly∣man,
 he thought it best to retreat. In the mean time that 
Ottoman
 Prince surprised the Town by Cunning, drove the young Prince and his Mother out of it, and sent them to Reign in 
Tran∣silvania,


 publishing that he would keep it until 
John Sigismond,
 the Son of 
John Zapoliha
 the Usurper, were of Age.


In the year, 1542. the Marquess of 
Brandebourgh,
 made as if he intended to Besiege 
Buda,
 and in that design marched towards it. He attacked 
Pest,
 on his march, but in vain, and retreated without any success.


The Count of 
Swartzenbourgh
 ha∣ing in the Month of 
March
 1598. by a Wonderful Stratagem retaken 
Java∣rin,
 or 
Raab,
 from the 
Turks,
 marched the same year in the Month of 
Octo∣ber,
 under the Auspices of the Arch∣duke 
Matthias,
 and laid Siege to 
Buda,
 which after thirty days Attack he was forced to raise, because of the conti∣nual Rains: And it is remarkable, that the 
Turks,
 who at the same time Besieged the Town of 
Waradin
 in 
Tran∣silvania,
 were likewise obliged to quit their Enterprise for the same Rea∣son.


The Christians again attacked that Town in the year 1602 under General 
Roswurm,
 but having ruined the Bridge ever the 
Danube,
 and pos∣sessed

 the Town of 
Pest,
 the Rigour of the Season obliged them to desist from their Design.


The Duke of 
Lorrain
 Generalissimo of the Imperial Armies, attempted the Siege of the same place, having first made himself Master of the Castle of 
Vicegrad, Vaccia
 and 
Pest,
 and thrice defeated the 
Ottoman
 Army; but the Season being too far advanced, that he might not endanger the Army, he thought it convenient to raise the Siege in the Month of 
October,
 1684.




The Council of 
Buda.


Philip
 Bishop of 
Fermo,
 of the holy See, being sent by 
Nicholas
 III. for treating some important Affairs with 
Ladislaus
 III. King of 
Hungary,
 in the year 1279. celebrated a Council at 
Buda;
 the Constitutions whereof to the Number of Thirty six, 
Oldericus Rainaldus
 hath put at the end of the 14. Tome of the Ecclesiastical An∣nals.






Churches
 or 
Funf-Kerken,
 and some other places, burnt 
Siget,
 and be∣sieged 
Canisa,
 which he would have infallibly taken, had the Succours that were promised him been sent to him. The Grand 
Visier
 having Intelligence of that siege, advanced with a great Army, made him raise it, and then took 
Fort Serini,
 which was afterwards demolished, little 
Gomora,
 and other Places.








VICEGRAD.


The 
Latins
 call it, 
Vissegradia,
 and the 
Germans, Plindenburg.
 It is a strong Town, built upon a very high Rock, the 
Danube
 running by the Foot of it, and lies above 
Buda,
 and below 
Stri∣gonium.
 In this place there is a Castle, upon a little Hill, where the 
Abbey
 of 
Pily
 stands also. Heretofore the Crown of 
Hungary
 was kept there, that Town in former times having been the place of Residence of the Kings of 
Hunga∣ry;
 and the Remains of the Ruines of a very stately Building of Free Stone, are still to be seen there. The Forces of the Arch-Duke 
Matthias,
 re-took

 that place in the Reign of 
Mahomet
 III. But the 
Heydukes
 committed a piece of the greatest Treachery ima∣ginable, and delivered it up into the hands of the 
Turks,
 in the time of 
Sultan Achmet. Charles
 King of 
Na∣ples,
 who was also proclaimed King of 
Hungary,
 having been wounded in the Head by 
Forchatz,
 was carried into that Castle, where under pre∣text of applying a Plaister to his Head, they strangled him. The Crown of 
Hungary
 was heretofore kept at 
Vice∣grad,
 but the 
Turks
 having advanced so far, it was thought safer to put it into the Castle of 
Presbourg.
 This Crown is of a pretty singular shape; for it is very low, and hath a Cross on the top with four leaves that go compleatly round it, of which one is as big as the other three, or at least, as two of them. It is infinitely esteem∣ed by the 
Hungarians,
 because they believe that an Angel brought it to their King St. 
Stephen:
 and the most 
August
 Emperour 
Leopold,
 who reigns at present, is the two and fourtieth King that hath been crowned with that Crown.








S. MARTINSBERG.


Is a pretty handsom Town, and a very strong place, seated on the Top of a very high Hill, from whence all the Countrey about may be discovered. It lies betwixt the Fort of 
Raab,
 and the Town of 
Dotis.






DOTIS.


Dotis, Tata,
 or 
Theodata,
 is but four Leagues from 
Comora;
 it hath a Ca∣stle with Ditches round it, and not far from thence, there are some natural Baths. It lies betwixt 
S. Martinsberg
 and the 
Danube,
 hath been often ta∣ken and re-taken, and belongs to his 
Imperial
 Majesty. The Count of 
Salms,
 General of the 
Imperial
 Army, took it in the year 1565. with the Town of 
Vesprim.






VESPRIM.


In 
Latin Vesprinium,
 and in 
High-Dutch Weisbrun,
 is a little pretty strong Town, lying near the head of the Ri∣ver

 
Sarwis,
 and the Lake 
Balaton
 ele∣ven Leagues from 
Strigonium,
 and five from 
Alba Regalis,
 being the Seat of a Bishop Suffragan to 
Strigonium;
 it is the capital of the County of its Name, and hath a strong Castle upon the top of a little Hill, belonging to his 
Im∣perial
 Majesty. The Count of 
Salms
 took it in the year 1565. with the Town of 
Dotis.






PAPA.


A little Town, but strong, defend∣ed by a Castle, and lying in the County of 
Vesprim,
 upon the River of 
Malchaltz;
 it belongs to the Em∣perour.






SARWAR.


This place lyes upon the 
Raab,
 be∣twixt 
Papa,
 and 
Sabaria,
 under Obe∣dience to the Emperour, having been re-taken in the year, 1567.






SABARIA.


Is an Ancient Town in the County

 of 
Iron Castle
 lying at the concourse of the two Rivers of 
Guntz,
 and 
Regnitz,
 before they fall into the 
Raab.
 This Town is affirmed to be the Native Town of St. 
Martin;
 and there are some who report, and others that be∣lieve, that the Famous Poet 
Ovid
 di∣ed and was Buried in this Town of 
Sabaria.
 They write, that having been Seven years Banished at 
Tomos,
 near the 
Euxin
 Sea, he was afterwards recalled, and died at 
Sabaria,
 upon his return to 
Italy;
 where they say his Tomb was found in the year 1508. with this E∣pitaph, made by himself, and cut on the outside of a stately Vault.










Fatum necessitatis lex.


Hic situs est Vates, quem Divi Caesaris ira


Augusti, Patriâ cedere jussit humo.


Soepe miser voluit Patriis occumbere terris;


Sed frustra, hunc illi fata dedêre locum.




That's to say.






Fate 
is a Law of necessity.


Here lyes the Poet, whom the Anger of Divine 
Caesar,
 obliged to leave his Country; often did he wish in his Mi∣sery that he might dye in his own Coun∣try, but in vain; for the Fates have given him this for a Burying place.










And about the year 1540. 
Isabel
 Queen of 
Hungary
 shewed 
Peter Angelo Bargeo,
 a Silver Pen that 
Ovid
 made use of to write with; which not long before had been found amongst the Ancient Ruins of 
Tearunum,
 at present called 
Belgrade,
 at the mouth of the 
Save,
 that falls into the 
Danube,
 with these words Engraven round it: 
Ovidii Nasonis Calamus,
 which that Queen highly prised, and kept it as a Sacred thing.






GRAN.


This Town which is called 
Gran, Strigonium,
 or 
Ostrogon,
 lyes on the South-side of the River of 
Gran,
 where it falls into the 
Danube.
 It is divid∣ed into the Upperr and Lower, Town both which are considerably strong

 and have good Walls. The lower Town commands the 
Danube,
 and St. 
Thomas
 his Hill is also very well fortified, be∣cause being close by the Town it might command it. In this Town there are excellent Natural Baths, that are not too hot. Heretofore it was the Metropolitan City of 
Hun∣gary,
 and St. 
Stephen
 their first King was born in it; as 
Stephen
 III. died there. The chief Ornaments of it are the great Church of St. 
Stephen,
 who lyes buried in it, the Arch-Bishop's Palace, and the Houses of other Ca∣nons: This Arch-Bishop formerly put the Crown upon the Kings Head the day of his Coronation. In the Upper Town there is a Rock, on which a ve∣ry strong Castle is built. The Neigh∣boring Hills abound in Vines, and the Country about with Springs of hot water, so that by reason of the Fruit∣fulness of the Country, and the strength of the Town, the Kings of 
Hungary,
 in former times had their Palace and kept their Residence there: Hardly any place hath maintained so many Bloody Sieges. For 
John
 King of 
Hun∣gary▪
 Besieged it, but in vain; and he

 could not succeed in his Attempt. 
So∣lyman
 took it in the year, 1542. but the Count of 
Mansfield
 re-took it, for the Arch-duke 
Matthias.
 It was once more Besieged in vain; but in Succession of time 
Sultan Achmet
 took it, by means of an infamous piece of Baseness, that the Christians who de∣fended it committed; for having kil∣led the Count of 
Dampierre
 the Gover∣nour, they surrendered the place to 
Alybeg
 General of the 
Turkish
 Army. The Town of 
Barckan,
 is exactly op∣posit to 
Gran,
 and there is a Bridge of Boats betwixt those two places. It was before that Fort, that the Armies of the Emperor and 
Poland
 gained the Battle against the 
Turks
 in the Month of 
October,
 1683. when they Besieged and took the said Fort, and the Town of 
Gran
 also the 23. of the same Month, after they had gloriously raised the Siege of 
Vienna;
 which the Grand Vizier 
Kara Mustapha
 had laid to it, with the chief Forces of the 
Ottoman
 Empire, who were cut to pieces, and put to the rout there; and after that the City of 
Gran,
 for the space of 80. years had groaned under the yoke

 of the 
Turks.
 But the 
Barbarians,
 be∣ing impatient that such an important place should remain longer in the Hands of the Christians, endeavoured to regain it with an extraordinary strong Army, and laid Siege to it the 30th. of 
July,
 1685. which they were forced to raise, with the loss of the Battle that followed after the 16th. of 
August,
 the same year.




The Isle of Schut.


This Isle, which the 
Latins
 call 
Insu∣la Cituorum,
 called commonly 
Schut,
 and 
Comora,
 or rather 
Comara,
 from its most important place lying on the North-East point of the Island, that has that name, is Twelve 
Hungarian
 Leagues in length, and Five in breadth, Sixteen 
Hungarian
 making Twenty 
German
 Leagues. It contains about Three Hundred Villages, or Bourgs, and Fifteen Thousand Inhabitants. Its next best place to 
Comora,
 is 
Sama∣ria
 or 
Samareyn,
 for which cause 
Mun∣sterus
 says, that the Island is called 
Sa∣maria,
 as well as 
Schythia
 and 
Camaron,
 meaning 
Schut
 and 
Comara.
 This

 Isle is made by the 
Danube,
 which dividing it self into four Branches be∣low 
Presbourg,
 makes many lovely Isles, full of tall Trees, of which this is the chief; at the end whereof and be∣low 
Comara
 the 
Danube
 unites all its Branches, of which that which comes from the Upper 
Hungary,
 is cal∣led 
Waag;
 and the River coming from the North falls into the 
Danube
 at this Island.








RAAB or JAVARIN.


A very strong Town situated where the Rivers of 
Raab
 and 
Rabuits,
 fall into the 
Danube,
 is the Seat of a Bishop Suffragan to 
Gran,
 or 
Strigoni∣um.
 The 
Germans
 call it 
Raab,
 the 
French Javarin,
 the 
Hungarians Gever,
 the 
Italians Giavarin,
 and the Latin Authors, 
Javarinum, Arabo
 and 
Ha∣rabo.
 The Fort was made by 
Ferdi∣nand
 of 
Austria,
 King of 
Hungary,
 be∣fore he came to be Emperor in the year, 1550. and is one of the com∣pleatest Strengths in 
Europe.
 It hath two Bridges, one on the side of 
Au∣stria,
 and the other on the side of 
Al∣ba Regalis,
 or 
Stael-Weissenbourgh,
 it is

 fortified with Seven Bastions, and hath Four high Mounts, from whence all the Country about may be disco∣vered. The First is the Bastion, on which the Castle or Governours Pa∣lace is built. The Second is upon the brink of the River of 
Danube.
 The Third stands upon the Holy Hill; and when the 
Turks
 blew it up, there was a Man upon it on Horse back, who was carried by the force of the Gun∣powder into the 
Danube,
 without the least hurt either to Man or Horse. The Fourth is that in the middle, which looks East-ward into the Coun∣trey. The Fifth is that which is cal∣led the New Bastion. The Sixth the Imperial Bastion. And the Seventh is that of 
Hungary,
 on the brink of the River of 
Raab.
 Here it was that the 
Turkish
 Governour was killed, when the Christians surprised the Town, in the night time. It is very near the Isle of 
Schut
 in a Plain that reaches out of sight, environed by a Branch of the 
Danube,
 and the River of 
Raab,
 which makes many to give it that name: And it would seem that nothing can be able to hurt it; unless it be a little Hill

 which is at a pretty good distance from it too, and might be blown up when they pleased, if there were occa∣sion for it. Beyond it there is also a little Tower, in the middle of the Plain, from whence the approach of an Enemy, may easily be discovered. This Town may be near Three hun∣dred paces in Circuit, and at each Angle of the Figure, there is a Cava∣lier which commands the Fortification faced with brick. 
Sinam Bassa
 besieg∣ed it in the Reign of Sultan 
Amurath
 III. He lost a great many men there, and Twelve thousand were killed in one Attack; but at length it rendred in the year 1591. by the Treachery of the Count of 
Hardeck,
 who was Go∣vernour of the place, for which base Action he had his Head struck off at 
Vienna.
 Some years after it was re∣taken by the Count of 
Swartszenbourg,
 and the Count of 
Palfy
 who surprised it in the night time, in the year 1606. under the Emperor 
Rodolph,
 and made a great slaughter of all the 
Turks
 that were in it: A piece of the Gate, which was broken down by a Petard, is still kept in the Cathedral Church, as the

 Instrument of the Victory; in memo∣ry whereof, the Town fires yearly all their Guns, and make a Solemn Pro∣cession. Whilst the 
Turks
 were Ma∣sters of that Town, they made a Dungeon for the Christian Prisoners, into which there enters no Light but through a Grate that looks to the Market-place. But at present there are commonly 
Turks
 shut up in it, who beg the Charity of those that pass that way, and sell a kind of Whips, which they make in their wretched Confine∣ment. 
George Drascovitz
 Bishop of that Town held a Synod there in the year 1579.


The Emperor finding himself in∣commoded by the great number of 
Chiaus
 or Ordinary Envoys who came often to 
Vienna,
 from the Vizier of 
Bu∣da,
 and never went back again with∣out some Present, ordered for the fu∣ture, that they should advance no far∣ther than 
Raab,
 unless they had a Per∣mission, and that they should receive their dispatches there. In consequence whereof there was in 
December,
 1685. a 
Turkish Aga
 there named 
Aga Scelebi,
 waiting for the Emperours Answer,

 from whom he came to beg a Peace.






COMORA.


Gomora, Crumenum,
 or 
Comaronium,
 is a very large fair Town, lying at the East-end of the Isle of 
Schut;
 it looks to the 
Danube,
 and 
Waag,
 and is very well fortifyed and peopled. The Fortifications of it have also been late∣ly enlarged, and a great deal of ground taken in, by means of a Line drawn from the 
Waag
 to the 
Danube,
 and is fortified by four Bastions more.






TORTOISE.


Is reckoned a strong place, and has its Name from its Figure, which in some manner resembles a 
Tortoise. Si∣nan Basha
 having taken the Town of 
Raab,
 besieged this place with Three∣score Vessels, and a vast number of 
Turks
 and 
Tartars;
 but it was without success, and most part of the 
Tartars
 were kill'd there.








PETRONEL.


Betwixt 
Vienna
 and 
Presbourg,
 where the River of 
Mark
 falls into the 
Da∣nube,
 lyes the Town of 
Petronel,
 near the Hill, and Castle of 
Haimbourg. Petronel
 is thought to be the place that was anciently called 
Carnuntum,
 which was one of the strongest places of the 
Panonians,
 and in vain besieged by the 
Romans
 170. years, before the Incar∣nation of our Saviour; who never∣the less, in Progres of time made them∣selves Masters of it under 
Augustus,
 that sent thither a 
Roman
 Colony, with the Forces which were called 
Legio decima Gemina,
 and 
Classis Istrica.
 It was enlarged so much afterward, that it became the chief City of the Upper 
Panonia,
 and contained all that lay on the South side of the 
Danube,
 where at present we see 
Haimbourg, Altenbourg,
 and 
St. Petronel.






ALTENBOURG.


Is a Town environned by the little River of 
Leytha,
 and near that small

 Branch of the 
Danube,
 which runs to∣wards the Lower 
Hungary,
 eight Leagues from 
Presbourg.
 It was form∣erly an open Village; but it hath since been walled in by the 
Hungarians,
 who call it 
Ovar,
 that's to say, old 
Castle,
 which sutes with the German name 
Altenbourg,
 that signifies an old Bur∣rough. It is near to the West end of the Isle of 
Schut,
 and in the Hands of the Emperour, who in the year 1646. gave that Lordship to 
Nicholas Drasko∣witch,
 Count of 
Trukostian,
 at that time chosen Palatin of 
Hungary,
 that he might qualifie him by that Dig∣nity.






SIGET.


A strong Town lying on this side of the 
Drave,
 in the Wash of the River 
Alm,
 with a Citadel fortifyed by a tripple Wall, and a tripple Ditch: It is the chief Town of the County of that Name, and was taken by the 
Turks
 the seventh of 
September,
 1566. after a brave defence made by 
Nicho∣las Esdrin
 Count of 
Serini,
 Great-Grandfather to 
Nicholas
 II, Knight of

 the Golden Fleece, who died in the year, 1664. and three days after, 
Soly∣man
 who besieged it departed this Life in the Town of 
Five-Churches,
 whi∣ther, falling sick in the Camp, he was carried. This 
Nicholas
 I. was that Great and Valiant Warriour, who af∣ter the taking of so many Towns, and gaining so many Battles, defended that great and important Place of 
Ziget,
 against the 
Turks
 with an undaunted Courage to the last; so that being no longer able to resist the formidable Ef∣forts of that Barbarous Enemy, he made the last Sally with Prodigious Re∣solution, and amongst many Musket-shot which he received at the first dis∣charge, one in the Head, laid him Dead on the Ground. The Barbari∣ans having cut off his Head, sent it to 
Selim
 the Son of 
Solyman,
 who sent it to 
Mahomet Bassa,
 and he to the 
Ba∣sha
 of 
Buda,
 who presently wrapt it up in a Cloth of Silk, and by two Boors sent it to the Emperor 
Maximi∣lian
 in the Camp of 
Turn
 or 
Bregeto,
 and from thence it was carried by 
Bal∣thasar Butschano
 to 
Tscacaturno,
 and there buried in St. 
Helens
 Church,

 where 
Catharine de Frangipani
 his first Wife lay; this is the 
Epitaph
 upon his Tomb.

FIVE CHURCHES.


This Town hath a Bishoprick Suf∣fragan to 
Gran,
 or 
Strigonium;
 the 
Ger∣mans
 call it 
Funf-Kircken,
 the 
Hungari∣ans Otegiazack,
 and the 
Latin
 Authors 
Quinque Ecclesiae.
 It lyes upon the Ri∣vulet called 
Kevirz
 close by the 
Drave,
 which five or six Leagues from that, falls into the 
Danube. Five Churches
 is

 a strong place Four Leagues from 
Si∣get,
 and in the hands of the 
Turks. Solyman
 II. took it in the year 1543, and afterward died in that Town, du∣ring the Siege of 
Siget
 in the year, 1566. which being so near, they had reason to say that he died in his Camp. The Valiant Count 
Nicholas Serini
 Se∣cond of that Name, burnt this Town, and the Bridge of 
Esseck,
 in the year 1664. and shortly after signalized him∣self in a particular manner at the Bat∣tle of 
Raab,
 the 
Turks
 having ingenu∣ously confessed, that the Terror of his Name was the cause of the gaining of that Battle. Not long after that brave Count ended his Life, in a very Tra∣gical manner, for being separated from his Attendance, and engaged in the Thickets of a Wood, a Wild Boar enraged by the Wounds which it had received, fell upon him, and having hurt him in the Knee, threw him down. The Count had not the leisure to come to him again; for the violent Beast struck one of its Tusks into his Head, and gave him that Mortal wound, whereof he shortly af∣ter died in his Page's Arms. Such

 was the end of that Illustrious Cap∣tain, whom Death seemed to have respected amidst the greatest Dangers to which he daily exposed himself, and yet became a prey to an inconsi∣derable Beast. He was a sworn Ene∣my to the 
Mahometans,
 and had for them as implacable a Hatred as ever 
Hanibal
 had for the 
Romans.
 He was undaunted in Dangers, brave in Acti∣on, indefategable in Labour, Mild in Peace, and moderate in his Pleasures. He was very sober and took greatest pleasure in Hunting in the Woods, be∣cause it was an Exercise that resem∣bled the Labours of War. He was a man of a profound and solid Judg∣ment; and in a Word, one of the most zealous Defenders of the Christi∣an Religion, whose Courage, Valour, and brave Actions, ought in History to procure him a place amongst the greatest 
Hero
's. He died the 18th. of 
November,
 1664. about the four and fortieth year of his Age, and his Body was Buried near to 
Sacathurne,
 the place of his Residence in 
Croatia,
 in the Chap∣ple that hath been built in the same place of the Wood where he was killed,

 and all round the Chappel these words are to be read: 
Neque diem, neque horum scimus.
 The Chappel is full of all sorts of Trophies, Standards, and Colours, which that Noble Warriour took from the 
Turks.
 His Epitaph is in Leonin Verse.


Fata, Leonini versus, deflete 
Serini,


Magnus bellator fuit & Virtutis a∣mator,


Turcas prosternit, mortemque & vulnera spernit,


Hic vitâ exemptus, crudeli est morte peremptus,


Inter Apri ardentes, invenit funera dentes,


Atque hoc augustum meruit sub mar∣more bustum






ESSECK
 and its 
BRIDGE.


The Town of 
Esseck
 or 
Osseck,
 is thought to be the Ancient 
Mursa,
 or at least it is not far from it. History will have it to be in this place, that 
Constantus
 Son to the Emperor 
Con∣stantine
 defeated the Tyrant 
Magnen∣tius
 in the year 359. This Town lies very low, and there are Trees grow∣ing in all the Streets. On one side of

 the Gate there is part of a 
Roman
 in∣scription, which begins thus: 
M. Aeli∣an,
 &c. And on the other, the Head of a Maid on a Stone. There is a very pret∣ty Dial there also, brought thither from 
Serinwar;
 and one of the finest pieces of Cannon that ever was seen in those parts: It is not upon a Carriage, as o∣thers are, but upon great beam of Wood. This is a great and populous Town, there being in it at least five hundred shops, many Mosques and 
Haccars,
 which are large Inns for Tra∣vellers.


But that which is most considerable, is the lovely Wooden Bridge, (not to be matched in the World) which was built by 
Solyman,
 in the year 1521. immedi∣ately after he took 
Belgrade,
 partly over the 
Drave,
 and partly over the River of 
Fenues
 close by, both which do often o∣verflow. On this side the 
Drave
 it is about Eleven Hundred paces long, and on the other side almost Eight Thousand, all of good Oak. It is about Twelve yards broad, so that three 
Turkish
 Wag∣gons, that are bigger than ours, can go a Breast upon it. The River of 
Drave
 is not broad at that place, and there are

 but sixteen Boats that support the Bridge with great Trees that make the Arches. All who well consider that Bridge, and the several Wood∣en Towers which are built upon it, with the vast number of Beams that were needful to uphold so great a Fa∣brick, cannot sufficiently admire, how they could find Timber enough to build or to support it. The Brave Count 
Nicholas
 of 
Serini,
 Second of that Name, burnt the part of the Bridge that is over the 
Drave
 in the year 1664. but in six Weeks time they made ano∣ther Bridge of Boats, a little lower than the first. The 
Turks
 would not re-build it in the same place, because the Piles that supported it, and that were under Water when the Fire was out, stuck so fast in the ground, that it would have cost them too much Trouble to get them out. Over this Bridge march all the Armies that come into 
Hungary,
 and here it was that the unfortunate King 
Loüis
 thought to have put a stop to the 
Turks,
 that were co∣ming against him, under the Conduct of 
Solyman,
 in the year 1526. and in∣deed, if that Pass had been well defen∣ded

 at that time, it is probable 
Soly∣man
 might not so easily have marched forwards to 
Buda.
 Count 
Serini
 burnt the part of the Bridge that was built o∣ver the 
Drave,
 to hinder the 
Grand Vi∣sier
 from receiving Succours from the other Counties of 
Turky;
 and upon his return, he also burnt 
Five-Churches,
 that lyes West-ward from 
Esseck. Count Le∣slie,
 General of the Imperial Army, set fire again to the Bridge of 
Esseck,
 which for twelve hundred Paces length was immediately in a flame; at the same time he took the Town of 
Esseck,
 put all he met to the Sword, and ha∣ving plundred it, and blown up the Magazin and Arsenal, that were full of Ammunition and Provisions, he put Fire to it, and reduced it to A∣shes.






WALPO.


Is a Town lying upon a River of the same Name, which abounds in Fish. It was taken by the 
Turks
 in the year 1642. and re-taken and sacked by Count 
Leslie,
 in the Month of 
Au∣gust
 1685.








METRONIZA.


Is a pretty neat Town, and big e∣nough to be the place of a Fair. It lyes upon the side of a Lake.






CIRMIUM.


This Town lying upon the River 
Bosneth,
 near the 
Save,
 into which it falls, is the chief Town of the Province of that Name, which is also called 
Schremnia,
 in the South part of 
Hun∣gary,
 having been formerly a Bishops Seat; it hath its Name from 
Sirmus
 King of the 
Tribals:
 This is the anci∣ent 
Sirmium
 heretofore so Famous, which is at present so little esteemed. However, there grows excellent Wine about it, and in this Province, it is said, that the Emperour 
Probus
 planted Vines with his own hand, upon 
Mount-Almos
 or 
Arpataro.
 That Emperor was killed there by his own Soldiers, who were vexed that he kept them in so strict Discipline, and feared that they might be thought useless when that Prince had quell'd all the Enemies of

 the Empire; but afterwards repent∣ing what they had done, they made him this 
Epitaph.


Hic probus Imperator


Et verè probus situs est.


Victor omnium gentium Barbarorum,


Victor etiam Tyrannorum.


That Emperour named 
Marcus Au∣relius Probus,
 was the Son of a Peasant in 
Dalmatia,
 and was killed in the year 282. Many 
Roman
 Emperours have been in these parts, who were born, died, or signalized themselves by great Actions there. For not to speak of 
Trajan, Caracalla, Gallien, Constantius,
 and several others; the Emperours 
Aurelian, Probus,
 and 
Gra∣tian,
 were born at 
Sirmium,
 and 
Clau∣dius Gothicus
 died there, or very near to that place. 
Jovian
 and 
Valentinian,
 were born in 
Pannonia,
 and in the time of 
Photinus
 Bishop of 
Sirmium,
 there was a general Council held in that Town.










CHAP. VIII.




 Of the Rivers of 
Hungary,
 and their Description.






THE 
DANUBE.


THE 
Don
 or 
Donaw,
 by the Anci∣ents called 
Danube,
 is the second River of 
Europe,
 both for Greatness and Force; its source is in 
Swabia,
 in the County of 
Fustemberg,
 where the 
Schwartz-wald
 is, and the black For∣rest. It passes by 
Ulm,
 over against which it receives the 
Iler,
 which runs by 
Kempten,
 and near to 
Memminguen,
 it passes by 
Donawert,
 near which and on the other side of it, it receives the 
Lech,
 which runs by 
Ausbourg,
 and se∣parates 
Swabia
 from 
Bavaria;
 near to 
Donawert,
 the 
Danube
 enters into 
Ba∣varia,
 where it leaves 
Newbourg
 to the right hand, 
Ingolstadt
 to the left; di∣vides 
Bavaria
 from the Palatinat, from whence it receives the 
Nabe;
 passes under the Bridges of 
Ratisbonne
 and

 
Siraubing,
 which are to the right; on the same side receives the 
Iler,
 which watereth 
Munick
 and 
Landshout,
 the Capitals of the upper and lower Dut∣chies of 
Bavaria,
 receives at 
Passaw
 the 
Inn,
 which comes from the 
Enga∣dines
 amongst the 
Grisons,
 and crosses the County of 
Tirol,
 and there wa∣shes 
Inspruck,
 that has the first Bridge upon the 
Inn,
 then 
Halle,
 in 
Tirol,
 and 
Kufstain,
 &c. and gives to a part of the Town of 
Passaw
 the Name of 
In∣stat,
 the first Town of 
Inn.
 A little below 
Passaw
 the 
Danube
 enters 
Au∣stria,
 and there watereth 
Lintz
 the Capital City of 
Austria;
 above 
Ens
 it receives the River of 
Ens,
 where the Town of 
Ens
 is, washes 
Crems
 in the middle 
Austria,
 and 
Vienna
 in the lower; 
Vienna
 and 
Lintz
 are on the right side Bank, and 
Crems
 on the left of the 
Danube.
 The 
Murau,
 which descends from 
Moravia,
 falls into the 
Danube
 between 
Austria
 and 
Hungary,
 where the 
Danube
 continuing its course, on the left hand washes 
Presbourg,
 the Capital City of the Upper 
Hungary,
 embraces the Isle of 
Schut,
 on the Bor∣ders whereof are 
Owar
 or 
Walkenbourg,


 and 
Gever
 or 
Javarin;
 and at the point of the Isle, 
Comora,
 all strong places, which for many years have stood it out against the 
Turks.
 The 
Danube
 ha∣ving at 
Comora
 rejoined all its Branch∣es, passes by 
Gran
 or 
Strigonium,
 runs betwixt 
Buda
 the ancient place of Re∣sidence of the Kings of 
Hungary,
 and 
Pest,
 embraces the Isse of 
Ratzenimarck;
 waters 
Colocz
 on the left, receives the 
Drave
 on the right, and over against the Isle of 
Erdewdy,
 the 
Teisse
 on the left, over against 
Salonkemen,
 the 
Save
 on the right, and below the confluence of the 
Save
 and 
Danube
 lyes 
Belgrade,
 in a Situation that ought to be estee∣med, seeing of the four Rivers that are near to it, the least runs above an hun∣dred Leagues: Beyond 
Belgrade
 we have but little knowledge of the 
Da∣nube,
 and from this place forwards the Ancients began to call it the 
Ister:
 On the right hand it receives all the Riv∣ers, which descend from 
Servia
 and 
Bulgaria,
 and on the left those of 
Wa∣lachia
 and 
Moldavia,
 by seven Mouths it discharges it self into the greater or black Sea. The whole Length of its Course may be six hundred Leagues,

 to wit, two hundred in 
Germany,
 some∣what less in 
Hungary,
 and somewhat more from 
Hungary
 to the Black Sea.






The 
TIBISQUE,
 and the 
BEDRACK.


That great River towards the East called 
Tibiscus,
 or otherwise the 
Teisse,
 which hath its source in the Country of 
Maromorus,
 at the Foot of the 
Carpati∣an
 Hills, having received the 
Mariscus
 or 
Marisa
 with several other Rivers, discharges it self into the 
Danube,
 be∣twixt 
Waradin, St. Peter,
 and 
Belgrade.
 There are brought down this River great quantities of Salt Stones, dug out of several Mines in 
Hungary
 and 
Tran∣silvania,
 which are also sent up the 
Da∣nube
 as far as 
Presbourg.
 This River is reckoned the best in all 
Europe;
 nay, I may say, in all the World, for Fish∣ing; so that the People of the Coun∣try say commonly, that there is no∣thing in that River but Water and Fish.




The River of 
Bedrack,
 which falls in∣to the 
Tibiscus
 not far from 
Tockay,
 is also so full of Fish, that in the Sum∣mer time when the water is low, the People say that the Fish make the Ri∣ver to swell: It is none of the smallest Rivers; for according to the Relation of those who have seen it, it is Thirty fathom broad, and Eighty eight and a half deep. But there is no good fish∣ing in it with Nets, because the Chan∣nel of it is triangular. This great Fer∣tili
y is attributed to the Communica∣tion that its Water hath with the salt Mines under Ground, which impreg∣nates it with a Principle of Fecun∣dity.






The 
RAAB.


The River 
Arabo
 or 
Raab
 is to the West, which hath its source in 
Stiria,
 and falls also into the 
Danube.
 It is a River in much esteem, because it re∣ceives the 
Lauffnitz,
 the 
Pica,
 the 
Guntz,
 and many other Rivers; but it is become more Famous by the de∣feat of the 
Turks,
 under the conduct of 
Achmet,
 who at that time was 
Grand

 Visie-,
 by the 
Imperial
 Army at 
St. Go∣dard
 near to that River.






The 
DRAVE.


There is a very lovely River to the South, called the 
Drave,
 or the 
Drau,
 which having its head in the Country of 
Saltzburland,
 that is a part of the ancient 
Noricum,
 and running through the middle of 
Carinthia,
 falls at length into the 
Danube
 near to 
Erdoed,
 or the ancient 
Teutoburgium,
 after it hath run about an hundred Leagues. The River of 
Mure
 falls into it.






The 
SAVE.


On the same side also is the River of 
Sava
 or 
Sau,
 which is very broad, and having its source in 
Carinthia,
 falls into the 
Danube
 at 
Belgrade,
 after it hath run near an hundred Leagues, and been augmented by several considera∣ble Rivers that fall into it. It seems to be a very pretty River at 
Carnodunum
 or 
Crainbourg,
 which is a neat Town near the head of it; but it is much en∣larged in its Course: It makes some

 pretty Islands, as 
Metubaris
 to the West of the ancient 
Sirmium,
 and 
Sigestica
 or 
Sissex
 near 
Zagrabia,
 wherein there was heretofore a very strong and fa∣mous Town. The Water of the 
Da∣nube
 seems to be whiter and more mud∣dy than the 
Sau,
 and the Water of the 
Sau,
 blacker and clearer than the 
Da∣nube.






The 
GRAN
 and the 
WAAG.


In the North of 
Hungary
 there are some Rivers also, which having their sources in the 
Carpathian
 Mountains, divide it from 
Poland;
 amongst others the River of 
Gran,
 which falls into the 
Danube,
 close by 
Strigonium
 or 
Gran;
 and the 
Waag
 or 
Vagus,
 which dischar∣ges it self into the same River, above 
Comara. Stuckius
 who is an Eye Wit∣ness says, that that River is no less than the 
Po
 in 
Italy:
 It is certain that at 
Frey∣stadt,
 which is a Town about seven∣teen Leagues from the place, where it falls into the 
Danube,
 it is very broad, and has a fair Bridge there, the greatest part whereof was carried away by the Ice, in the year 1669. A great way above this

 Place, and nearer its source, there is another very fair Bridge at 
Trenschin.






The 
SARVIZZA, WALPO,
 and 
BOSNETH.


Besides all these great Rivers there are some others mentioned by 
Pliny
 which he calls 
Fluvii non ignobiles,
 no inconsiderable Rivers. By 
Jeni
 or 
Nova Palenka,
 runs the River of 
Sarviz za
 otherwise called 
Vrpanus▪
 which hath its source close by 
Wesprin,
 and having run by 
Alba Regalis,
 makes a Trian∣gle with 
Buda
 and 
Gran,
 and then falls into the 
Danube.


By 
Walcover
 also runs the River of 
Walpo
 or 
Vulpanus,
 which hath its head above the Town of 
Walpo,
 that was taken by 
Solyman
 upon his March to 
Alba Regalis
 or 
Stoel-Weissenbourg.


As to the River 
Bosneth
 or 
Bacuntus,
 it hath its source near Mount 
Arpataro
 or 
Almus,
 and falls into the River of 
Sau,
 near to the Ancient 
Sirmium
 that stands upon its bank.










CHAP. IX.




 Of the Division of the Kingdom of 
Hungary,
 into Counties, and their Names.




WE have said before, that the Kingdom of 
Hungary
 is divid∣ed into Counties as well as 
England
 is. These Counties are the parts of the Kingdom, which are called Provin∣ces, and by the 
Greeks
 Monarchies, and the Lords who are Counts of them, have the jurisdiction therein; it having been for the more easie and exact Administration thereof, that the 
Hungarians
 thought fit to make that division. The Soveraignty of part of these Counties is at present lodged in his Imperial Majesty, as King of 
Hun∣gary;

CHAP. XII.




 Of the State of the Palatin of the King∣dom of 
Hungary,
 his Quality, Au∣thority, and Preheminence, with a List of those who in this last Age have been Elected to that Office.




THE chief Dignity of this King∣dom next to the King, is that of 
Palatin,
 who calls the Estates during an Inter-reigne, and who hath the first and most powerful voice in the Electi∣on of the King. He also decides the controversies that happen betwixt the King and his Subjects, since the Kings there are subject to the Laws, and must not Transgress them. He hath abso∣lute Power in the Armies, so that he can punish and reward all, as he thinks good, and bestow asmuch Land as Twenty or Thirty men are able to Labour. He hath great Revenues, not only from the Salt-pits, but from other things also; and heretofore he had the Rents of the two Isles on the Coast

 of 
Dalmatia,
 which now are possessed by the 
Venetians.
 In short, so great is his Authority, that right or wrong the 
Hungarians
 obey his Will, and fol∣low his Resolutions; and it is a Digni∣ty that cannot be given to Strangers, but belongs only to the 
Hungarians,
 who many times oppose their King by means of that Magistrate. It is not an Hereditary but Elective Office. Here I shall mention those who in this last Age have been Chosen to that Dignity.


1. 
Stephen Illishazi
 Count of 
Trens∣chin,
 Palatine of 
Hungary,
 chosen in the year 1601. died at 
Vienna
 the 26. of

Hunga∣ry,

December,
 1609.


3.

4.

Esterhazi
 of 
Galantha
 and

Hungary,
 made Knight of the Golden Fleece, in the year 1628. Deceased in the year 1645.


5.

August
 1648.

Erbent,
 and

 was made Knight of the Gol∣den Fleece in the year 1650. he died in 1654.


7.

 Count 
Wesselini
 of 
Hadad,
 Hereditary of 
Muran,
 Palatine of 
Hun∣gary,
 made Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in the year 1662. he died in 1667.


8. 
Paul
 Count of 
Esterhazi, Galan∣tha, Frackno,
 and 
Sopronica,
 Palatine of 
Hungary,
 made Knight of the Gol∣den Fleece, in the year 1682. Coun∣sellor and Chamberlain to the Empe∣ror in his Royal Court of 
Hungary,
 at present Palatine of that King∣dom.








CHAP. XIII.




 Of the Arms of the Kingdom of 
Hunga∣ry,
 and in what manner the Kings have born them.




THE Kingdom of 
Hungary
 bears Barry of eight pieces 
Argent
 and 
Gules.
 Prince 
Sigismond
 King of 
Bohe∣mia
 having Married 
Mary
 Daughter and Heiress of 
Loüis
 of 
Hungary,
 was in right of her King of 
Hungary,
 and afterwards Emperor. He joyned the Arms of 
Hungary
 and 
Bohemia,
 which he bore upon the Eagle of the Empire, empaling those of 
Hungary,
 with a dou∣ble Cross of St. 
Stephen,
 which is pre∣served with his Coat of Arms and Sword, used in the Ceremony of the Coronation of these Kings. In his Coyn of Gold there is a Reverse of the Globe of the Earth, Crowned with an Imperial Crown, which the Em∣perours at present place over their Arms.




John
 and 
Matthias Corvinus,
 who were Kings after him, bore quarterly the Arms of 
Hungary,
 the Cross of St. 
Stephen;
 those of 
Dalmatia,
 and 
Bohemia,
 and upon all those, the Arms of 
Corvin.
 In this manner they have been found upon a Prayer Book in Velom, which belonged to 
Matthias Corvinus,
 and is kept in the 
Bibliotheke
 of the 
Vatican.
 On the first page they are disposed in this manner, quar∣terly. 1. 
Hungary,
 Barry 
Argent
 and 
Gules.
 2. 
Gules
 a Cross double 
Argent
 placed upon a Tuff of Earth 
vert,
 con∣sisting of three little Hills. 3. 
Dalma∣tia, Azure
 three Leopards Heads cou∣ped and Crowned 
Or.
 4. 
Bohemia, Gules,
 a Lion 
Argent
 his tail forked, nowed, and passed in 
Saltier,
 Crown∣ed langued and Armed 
Or,
 upon all the Arms of 
Corvin,
 which is 
Or,
 a Crow conturned Sable, the head re∣turning back to the right-hand, in his Beak a double long Cross placed in Bend. 
Loüis
 King of 
Hungary
 Knight of the Golden Fleece, Son of 
Ladi∣slaus
 King of 
Hungary
 and 
Bohemia,
 bore quarterly the 1. and 4. 
Hungary,
 the 2. and 3. 
Bohemia, Gules
 a Lion

 
Argent,
 with a double tail, langued, and Armed 
Or,
 upon these the Arms of 
Poland.
 The Helmet Crowned 
Or,
 and the crest an Eagle nascent.


After them, this Kingdom entered into the House of 
Austria,
 which joyn∣ed the Arms of both together. The Arch-Dukes, who have born so many Quarterings in their Escutcheons, have born a chief empaling 
Hungary
 and 
Bohemia. Ferdinand
 the Brother of 
Charles
 the Fifth, King of the 
Romans,
 and afterwards Emperor, bore a great Escutcheon quartered of 
Hungary
 and 
Bohemia;
 upon which he placed ano∣ther less Escutcheon, quarterly upon the 1. 
Austria
 and Ancient 
Burgun∣dy
 empaled. 2. Quarterly of 
Castille
 and 
Leon:
 Upon the 3. 
Arragon
 em∣paled with 
Sicily:
 Upon the 4. 
partie per fess, Lorrain
 upon 
Brabant.
 Up∣on all another little Escutcheon em∣paling 
Guelders
 and 
Juliers,
 two Lions confronting one another, the Eagle of the Empire was displayed behind the great Escutcheon encompassed with a Collar of the Order of the Gol∣den Fleece.




Rodolph,
 II. during the Diet of 
Aus∣bourg,
 coyned a piece of Silver or Me∣dal, in the Middle whereof was the Eagle of the Empire Crowned with an 
Imperial
 Crown, and collered with an open Crown supporting an Escutche∣on quarterly of 
Hungary
 and 
Bohemia,
 with another over all, empaleing 
Au∣stria
 and Ancient 
Burgundy:
 About this Medal or Coin, instead of an Inscription, were Four and Twenty little Escutcheons of the Arms of 
Ca∣stillo, Leon, Arragon, Sicily, Granada, Carniola, Carinthia, Swabia, Cellem∣bourgh, Braganza,
 the Mark of 
Scla∣vonia, Portuan, Habsbourg, Tyrol, Bra∣bant, Flanders, Nybourg, Alsatia, Hol∣land,
 the Mark of the Holy Empire, or 
Antwerp, Croatia, Sclavonia,
 and 
Dal∣matia.


One may judge how much in the progress of time, the Kings of 
Hunga∣ry
 enlarged their Country, not so much by what may be found in Histo∣ry, as by what is to be seen at their Coronation. For there are Twelve of the Chief of the Kingdom, who carry each of them a Banner, where∣in are represented the Arms of

 Ten Provinces of that Kingdom, which are,



Hungary.


Dalmatia, Vert.
 Three Leopards Fa∣ces: 
Or.


Croatia,
 Chequey 
Argent
 and 
Gules
 of Eight Ranges.


Sclavonia: Or,
 a Cardinals Cap 
Sable,
 bordered 
Gules,
 the Strings Pen∣dant of the same.


Galicia.


Russia:
 Sables, a Portal open, with an Ascent of two Steps, 
Or.


Servia.


Bulgaria.


Bosnia: Azure,
 an Arm armed 
Or,
 holding in the hand a Sword 
Argent,
 the point upwards.

CHAP. XIV.




 Of the Memorable Battels that have been fought in 
Hungary.






ROMAN BATTLES.


THE Inhabitants of 
Hungary
 have had in Ages past many Brushes with the 
Romans,
 and fought several Bat∣tles with them: that which was given in the Neighbourhood of 
Adom,
 a Town of the Lower 
Hungary,
 upon the Bank of the 
Danube,
 was one of the Bloodiest. The occasion of it was, that at that time the 
Romans
 came to Seize the Country under the Conduct of 
Mocrinus
 and 
Tetricus,
 but there they received an utter overthrow.


Some time after the Inhabitants of 
Hungary
 having recollected their For∣ces, gave the 
Romans
 a Second Battle in the precincts of 
Solna,
 wherein they again obtained the Victory, and drove out the 
Romans,
 though they lost on their side above Forty thousand of their own Souldiers.








THE BATTLE OF MOHACZ.


THAT unhappy Battle, where∣in 
Loüis
 King of 
Hungary
 lost his Life, was fought the 30th. of 
August
 1526. in the plain of 
Mo∣hacz,
 a little Town of the Lower 
Hun∣gary
 upon the River called 
Carasse,
 close by the 
Danube,
 betwixt 
Botesk
 and 
Es∣seck. Solyman,
 Emperor of the 
Turks,
 being come into 
Hungary,
 with a pow∣erful Army; the Chief Commanders of the 
Hungarian
 Army perswaded the young King, who being hardly Twenty years of Age, was much wanting in Conduct, and had not For∣ces sufficient to make head against the 
Turks,
 to give them Battle, without staying for the Succors that were to come to him from 
Transilvania:


 They were puffed up with their for∣mer Victories, and so swollen with a good Conceit of themselves, that they 
hought none were able to stand a∣gainst them, and that their Reserved∣ness might make the 
Hungarians
 enter∣
ain a bad opinion of the resolution of 
heir Army. The Event answered 
he rashness of that Counsel; for that 
ovely Army of the 
Hungarians,
 consist∣
ng of the best part of the Nobility, 
nd chief Forces of the Kingdom, was 
outed and cut in pieces: The King was 
ot killed in the Fight; but his Horse 
hrew him into a Mire, where he 
tuck, and died, after he had for a 
ong time fought Valiantly with the 
Barbarians
 on the other side of the Town. His Body was found two Months after the Battle, in the River 
f 
Czelepatuka,
 and was interred in 
he Burying-place of the Kings, in the City of 
Alba Regalis.
 That unhappy 
efeat of the Christians, and that 
ictory of the 
Turks,
 occasioned in the 
equel the loss of the chief part of the 
ingdom of 
Hungary:
 The Bishops 
hemselves aswell as the rest of 
he Clergy, made it apparent

 in that Battle, that they were very good Soldiers for the common Cause of 
Chri∣stendom;
 for no fewer than six Bishops were killed in that fatal Overthrow, and amongst them 
Paul Tomorie
 Archbishop of 
Colocza,
 one of the chief who had advised the King to engage in that Battle: His Head was carried to 
Soly∣man,
 who called it a foolish Head, and incapable of giving its Master good Council. This is the Inscription that was made in memory of that fatal day.


Ludovicus
 solo nomine secundus,


Ad coronas natus, non formatus


Diadema Hungaricum secundo, quarto aetatis Bohemicum,


Ut Immaturus acquisivit.


Ita maturè secum utrumque perdidit;


Foelicior, si solus perire potuisset.


Eandem tamen cum Rege fatalis urna sortem


Experire coacta Hungaria,


Ducenta suorum millia eodem luctu deplora∣vit:


Luctuosum praevisorum malorum initium,


Lachrymabile futurorum dolorum argu∣mentum.








THE BATTLE OF S. GODARD.


THis Battle was fought the first of 
August,
 in the year, 1664. at St. 
Godard,
 betwixt 
Kermin
 and 
Canisa,
 in the Lower 
Hungary.
 In this place, one half of the 
Turkish
 Army passed the River of 
Raab,
 to attack the 
Impe∣rialists;
 but hardly were these Troops got over the River, when, without gi∣ving them time to entrench themselves, the 
Imperial
 Forces under the Com∣mand of General 
Montecuculi,
 being drawn up to receive them, forced them to fight, and utterly defeated the great∣est part of the 
Turks;
 the rest betook themselves shamefully to flight, who crowding in great haste to re-pass the River, threw themselves head-long in∣to the Water, and were carried away by the Stream; so that the Rapidity of

 the River, forcing along with it Men and Horses, they were drowned in the deepest places; it being certain that more perished in the Water, than by the Sword: And the 
Turks
 themselves acknowledged, that they lost many more Men, than the 
Gazets
 of 
Europe
 mentioned. To which they added, that their Histories did not speak of so great and so shameful a Disgrace happened to the 
Ottoman
 Empire, since it had attained to so high a degree of Power, as that Disaster was. The 
Turks
 left above Eight Thousand Men upon the place, and the Glory of the day to the 
Imperialists,
 which was imme∣diately followed by a Peace, that the 
Turks
 proposed, and greedily embra∣ced; of which these were the Condi∣tions.




1. That 
Transilvania
 should conti∣nue within its ancient Limits, and with its ancient Priviledges, under the Command of Prince 
Michael Abaffi.


2. That the Emperour of 
Germany
 should have Liberty to fortifie 
Gutta
 and 
Nitra.




3. That the 
Turks
 should make no In∣novation in the Regulation made for the Frontiers, as well of 
Hungary,
 as of the other Territories of the Em∣perour.


4. That 
Abaffi
 should pay six hundred Thousand Crowns to the Port, for the Charges of the War.


5. That all Acts of Hostility, betwixt the Emperour and 
Grand Signior,
 and their Subjects, should for ever cease.


6. That the two Provinces of 
Zatmar,
 and 
Zaboli,
 given to 
Ragotzi
 for Life, should again return to his Imperial Majesty, and neither the Prince of 
Transilvania,
 nor the 
Grand Signior
 pretend any Right to them.


7. That the strong Castle of 
Zechel∣hyd
 which revolted from the Em∣perour, should be demolished, be∣cause neither Party would renounce their Pretentions to so important a place.




8. That 
Waradin
 and 
Newheusel
 should remain in the Possession of the 
Turks,
 who had carried them by their Arms.


9. That for Confirmation of the Peace, the two Emperours should send Ambassadours to one another, with reciprocal Presents of equal value.










THE BATTLE AND RELIEF OF VIENNA. The 12th. of 
September,
 1683.




Instead of a Description of that happy day; I shall here publish the Letter of the King of 
Poland,
 written in Latin, the Day after the Battle, to the 
Marquess
 of 
Grana,
 then Go∣vernour of the 
Netherlands,
 with the Transla∣tion thereof; nothing being more Authen∣tick than the Contents of it.

 Poland,

MOST Illustrious Lord, and most dear to us. Being

 called to the relief of 
Vienna,
 which was in danger of being lost, we make no doubt, but that you have been in∣formed by the com∣mon Report, in how short a time, not∣withstanding the dif∣ficulties and length of the way, we came to the Banks of the 
Danube,
 sur∣mounted the tops of Mountains, and cros∣sed the Forrests of 
Vienna,
 with Forces that we raised in di∣ligence; but with Pleasure now we ac∣quaint your Illustri∣ous Lordship with that which we cannot conceal without pre∣judice to the com∣mon Consolation of Christendom. Know then that Yesterday the Christian Ar∣mies, the command whereof was by all given to us, fight∣ing under the Pro∣tection of God; and

 assisted by the good Fortune of the Princes, ann Dukes and Ele∣ctors, obtained in the Camp where we are, a signal Victory and Memorable to all posterity, over the 
Turks
 and 
Tartars.
 For the 
Grand Visier
 of the 
Turks
 proud with the Forces of all the East and of the 
Crim Tartars,
 and think∣ing of nothing less than swallow∣ing up not only 
Vienna,
 which in three days space must have perished (had it not been reliev∣ed) but also all Christendom, is in one days fight overthrown and put to flight. The Infantry, whom they call 
Jani∣saries,
 not being able to fly so

 nimbly as the Horse, seeing they are slower and more pestered, were left in the Camp, and aban∣doned to the dis∣cretion of the Vi∣ctorious. Their Camp, which took up near two 
German
 miles in 
length,
 and as much in breadth, was taken, their Can∣non, Ammuniti∣on, with rich spoils became the re∣ward of the victo∣rious Armies. 
Vi∣enna
 is relieved from a dreadful Siege, and immi∣nent dangers, and the Emperour a∣gain restored to the place of his Residence. The Night put a stop to the course of the Victory, and Darkness favoured the Ignominious flight of the E∣nemy, who smit∣ten

 with a Panick Fear is retreated towards 
Hungary.
 Our Light Horse, nevertheless pur∣sue them at the Heels, and kill or make Prisoners all whom they over∣take in the way. We, moreover, in the name of God pursue the same Victory, being re∣solved not to de∣sist, untill (if kind Heaven so think fit) we have opened for the Christian Armies Winter quarters in the Enemies Country. And such at present is the Confus
on of the 
Ottoman
 Af∣fairs, that if the Princes of Europe, will speedily Arm and undertake somewhat worthy of the Christian Name, a more favourable Jun∣cture than this

 can never be of∣fered unto them; for if the News of this Victory were seconded by some shew of arm∣ing by Land and by Sea, there is no doubt but 
Greece,
 that groans under the Ty∣ranny of an U∣surper, and 
Con∣stantinople
 it self would revolt from their perfidious Master, and endea¦vor to reco∣ver their pristine-Liberty. Upon no slight grounds we may assert the same thing of 
Epyrus, Macedonia, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Dalma∣tia, Valachia, Mol∣davia,
 and other Kingdoms and Provinces that have been sub∣dued by the 
Turks.
 Perhaps, also the 
Mahometan
 Em∣pire, may now have a tryal of

 the vicissitude of Humane Affairs, and from small Beginnings being grown so great, that it labours under its own weight, by a change of Fate and a turn of the Wheel of fickle Fortune, it may relapse in∣to its Original, and from so high an Elevation have a greater fall. But all these things are to be left to the su∣pream Will and Pleasure of Em∣pires and King∣doms. As for your Illustrious Lordship, we are fully perswaded that you have so great Piety and such Generous In∣clinations towards the concerns of Christianity, that you will not on¦ly congratulate

 these happy suc∣cesses; but one day also contri∣bute to the pro∣moting of the same, and omit no Occasion of furthering the ad∣vantage of 
Chri∣stendom.
 This we desire from the bottom of our Heart, praying God to give your Illustrious Lord∣ship perfect health and all sort of Prosperity. From the Tent of the 
Grand Visier,
 in the 
Turkish
 Camp before 
Vienna
 the 13. 
Septemb.
 1683. and the Tenth Year of our Reign.








Upon occasion of this great Victo∣ry, the following Chronogram was published.


aVstrIaCo aVXILIVM DeVS.


And it was the Subject of a Medal, which was made representing a double

 spread Eagle upon the Globe of the World looking to the Sun, with this Inscription, 
Colliget Auxilii radios,
 and having in its Tallons a Sword and Scep∣ter: About the Globe was this Mot∣to, 
Sub umbrâ alarum tuarum,
 and un∣derneath this, the Crescent reversed, with this Hemistich, 
Victamque rede∣git in umbras.
 And in the circumfe∣rence of the Medal, this Verse:

Imperii murum Austriaco interponit inorbe.


On the Reverse these Words were en∣graven.

And on the other:

There were many Sonnets made upon the same Subject in Vulgar Lan∣guages to the Honour of the King of 
Poland;
 but that which was made on him in Latin, very well deserves a place here.

Now this happy Victory and Relief of 
Vienna,
 is so much the more to be pri∣sed, that it is certain, according to the List which was afterwards found in the Grand Viziers Tent, that the Army of the 
Turks
 which Besieged it, consisted of 191800. men, and the Christian Army only of 81600. The great Standard, the Horses Tail, and the Grand Viziers own Horse were taken by the 
Poles,
 who obstinatly pursued them in their Retreat, and there was much booty found in the 
Turkish
 Camp, which was wholly plundered even to the Tent of the Grand Vizier, where they found great Riches in Gold, Silver, and other pre∣cious things: All their Artillery, which consisted of above an hundred pieces

 of Cannon, was also gained with store of Ammunition.


The great Standard we mentioned before, was carried before the King of 
Poland,
 when he made his entry into 
Vienna,
 immediately after it was Relieved, and was sent presently by that King to the Pope. On the one side of it was this Inscription,

We prophecy to you prosperity and good Success, God Pardon your Sins, and grant you all his grace.


And on the other side.

God Assist and Bless you, and dwell in the Hearts of Believers, that the purity of the Faith may encrease therein. Besides him there is no other God, and 
Ma∣homet
 is his Prophet.


It will not be amiss here to insert the List of the great Lords, who be∣sides the 
Imperialists,
 were present at that Battle; of whom the Names follow,





The King of 
Poland.


Prince 
Alexander
 his Son.


The Elector of 
Bavaria.


The Elector of 
Saxony.


The Duke of 
Lorrain.


Prince 
Waldeck.


Two Marquesses of 
Baden.


Four Dukes of 
Saxony.


Three Dukes of 
Wittenberg.


The Prince of 
Anhalt.


The Duke of 
Croy.


The Prince of 
Salms.


Two Dukes of 
Neubourgh.


The Marquess of 
Barreit.


The Prince of 
Hannover.


The Prince 
Lubomirski.


The Prince of 
Savoy.


The Prince of 
Hogen Zoller.




And since the King of 
Poland
 had so great a Hand in this Victory, I hope the Curious will not be dissatisfi∣ed, to see the League offensive and de∣fensive, which was happily made and concluded in the Month of 
April,
 1683. betwixt their 
Imperial
 and 
Polo∣nian
 Majesties, of which the substance follows:


1. There shall be only an Alliance defensive betwixt the two high Con∣tractors; but against the 
Turks
 there shall be also an Alliance offensive, which shall last untill both Parties find themselves in Rest and good Security.


2. This Alliance shall be Sworn and Sacredly confirmed by Oath, in presence of the Pope, by the two Cardinals 
Pio
 and 
Barberino,
 aswell in name of his 
Imperial
 Majesty, as of his Majesty of 
Poland,
 and of his States.


3. His 
Imperial
 Majesty renounces all pretentions for the Charges he hath been at, for the good of the Republick of 
Poland,
 during the late War of 
Swe∣den,
 and the 
Diploma de Electione Regis
 shall be given back and an∣nulled.


4. On the other hand the Crown and Republick of 
Poland
 renounces all pretentions it can have against the House of 
Austria.


5. The one shall not make a sepa∣rate Peace, without the consent of the other.


6. The Heirs of the two parties and Successors in the Government, shall be obliged to observe this Alli∣ance.


7. This only is to be understood of a War against the 
Turks,
 and not of any other.


8. His 
Imperial
 Majesty declares, that he will entertain 60000. men, whereof he will send 40000. into the Fields, and keep the other 20000. in Garrisons.


9. His 
Polonian
 Majesty offers to bring 40000. men into the Fields un∣der his own command.


10. To the end the Preparations of War may be the sooner in readiness, His 
Imperial
 Majesty promises by Antici∣pation to remit 200000. Crowns to the Crown of 
Poland,
 on condition that that sum be raised out of the Tenth of the Pope in the Kingdom of 
Poland,
 which he hath granted for that effect.


11. His 
Imperial
 Majesty shall be obliged to recover the places that he hath lost in 
Hungary.
 The 
Poles
 in like manner shall be obliged to regain theirs in 
Podolia, Walachia,
 and the 
Vkrain,
 and to act against 
Teckely
 with 6000. men.


12. Other Christian Kings and Po∣tentats may be also received into this Alliance; but not without the mutu∣al consent of both Parties, and above all the two 
Czars
 of 
Muscovy
 shall be earnestly entreated to enter in∣to it.


I cannot conclude this Chapter, without calling to mind a pretty Em∣bleme made upon occasion of this Victory, by a young Prince, who reckons Emperors amongst his Ance∣stors: The Emblem represents a 
Turk
 pitching a Net to surprise and catch the Eagle; but who wandering and engaging too far in his own Toile, be∣came himself therein the prey of the Eagle, with this Inscription: 
Qui captat, capitur,
 or 
Turca à capiendis captus.


Turca parans Aquilae insidias ac retia tendens


In somnis nuper visus adesse mihi.


O miseram! mecum tacitus, te funera, dixi,


Quae maneant, nescis, quo malè cauta volas?


Interea in casses tendebat rectà volatu,




Tollere jam praedam, praedo parabat ovans.


Unguibus at contrà volucris (mirabile visu)


Tendentem insidias insidiasque tulit.


Sic raptus raptor, factus sic latro, rapina,


Praedonemque putans se fore, praeda fuit,








THE BATTLE OR DEFEAT OF THE TURKS NEAR 
PRESBOƲRG.


THE 
Turks
 who were before 
Vienna,
 in the year 1683. find∣ing it difficult to bring their Provisions and Ammunition from the City of 
Buda,
 to the place where they were on the side of the 
Danube;
 be∣cause the Garrisons of 
Raab
 and 
Co∣mora
 way laid all their Convoys, and much annoyed them; the 
Grand Visier
 sent orders to 
Basha Husani,
 to join

 Count 
Teckely
 with some Troops, who was on the other side of the 
Danube,
 near the River of 
Waag,
 and to en∣deavour to make himself Master of the City of 
Presbourg,
 to the end they might have the passage of the 
Danube
 free, make a Bridge of Boats over it, and be provided of all things on that side. The thing was well undertaken; for Twenty thousand of their Men marched towards that Town: But the Duke of 
Lorrain,
 who at that time resolved to encrease his Army with the Regiments of 
Gran
 and 
Baden,
 which were in 
Raab,
 and were not so necessary there, seeing the 
Turks
 had Besieged 
Vienna,
 and who therefore had drawn near to 
Presbourg,
 to secure that Town from the attempts of the 
Turks;
 having had notice of it, sent immediately against them Prince 
Louis
 of 
Baden
 (who that day commanded the Van-Guard) with some Squadrons of Prince 
Lubomirski
's men, and the Two Regiments of 
Palfi
 and 
Styrum,
 who at first charged 
Teckely
's men in such a manner, that presently they be∣took themselves to flight. The 
Turks
 made a little longer Resistance; but at

 length also they were forced to give ground with the loss of Eight hundred of their Men, and a considerable 
Aga.
 The 
Imperialists
 gained there a Thou∣sand Wagons with Baggage; and cer∣tainly it was a lucky Hit for them to have beat the Enemy at that time, be∣cause if they had delayed but one day longer, 
Presbourg
 had been lost, see∣ing those within had promised to ren∣der next day to 
Teckely,
 and to furnish him with all that was necessary for the Bridge of Boats: whereas the 
Im∣perialists
 thereby not only preserved that Town, whither soon after they sent Six hundred men to re-inforce the Garrison; but also hindred the passage of the 
Danube,
 and the means of pro∣viding the Army before 
Vienna
 with necessaries; besides that they also ru∣ined the Boats which Count 
Teckely
 and the 
Turks
 had gathered together for making a Bridge: These last re∣treated towards the River of 
Waag,
 from whence Count 
Teckely
 wrote a Letter, to Justifie himself to the 
Grand Visier,
 which was intercepted by the 
Imperialists.








THE BATTLE OF BARKAN.


THE Generals of the Christian Armies, on the 10th. of 
Octo∣ber,
 1683. advanced towards 
Barkan
 (the 
Poles
 on that occasion be∣ing on the left Wing;) the 
Turks
 see∣ing them approach, fell upon them with a dreadful Shout, and chiefly up∣on the left Wing, commanded by the Lord High Marshal of 
Poland Jabla∣nowisky,
 who having the former Vict∣ory in his thoughts, charged the 
Turks
 so furiously, that he constrained them to give ground; but the Duke of 
Lor∣rain
 with the Cavalry of the right Wing, broke in upon them, with so great Impetuosity, that he put them entirely to the Flight. Afterwards some Regiments were commanded out to pursue the 
Turks,
 who fled, and by

 them were driven partly in a Marish, and partly into the 
Danube;
 because the Bridge, betwixt 
Barkan
 and 
Gran,
 broke in the middle, so that most of them fell into the River, and were drowned, and the rest who saved themselves in the Marish were killed, seeing in the first heat they gave the 
Turks
 no Quarters; and it was not till towards the end that they took a Thousand Prisoners, a∣mongst whom was the Basha of 
Silistria.
 Prince 
Loüis
 of 
Baden
 signalized him∣self on this occasion, and was by his Conduct the chief cause of the Victo∣ry, because the 
Imperial
 Cavalry act∣ed all along without the Foot. The Christians gained all the Colours, Tents, Cannon, Baggage, and in a word, all that was in the Camp of the 
Turks,
 besides a Thousand Horses that they made booty of. There are various Relations of the loss that the 
Turks
 suf∣fered in this Fight; some will have it that being Thirteen thousand strong before the Defeat, they saved but Three or Four Thousand at most, and amongst those the 
Basha
 of 
Mesopotamia
 who Commanded them; all the rest,

 who were the Choice of the 
Turkish
 Army, being either killed or taken. However it be, the Waters of the 
Da∣nube
 were died with their Blood; this Fight lasted about five hours.


From thence the 
Imperalists
 advanc∣ed towards 
Barkan,
 and Battered that place so violently with great and small Shot, that presently they in the Town beat a Parley, which being granted them, the 
Imperialists
 enter∣ed the place; but shortly after a Fire happening in it, this little Hold was burnt down, and no body could tell how the Fire happened. This Victory was followed by the taking of 
Gran,
 which surrendered the 27th. of 
Octo∣ber,
 after four days Siege: These were the Articles of Capitulation;


1. All the Cannon, Mortars, Ammu∣nition, Magazines, and other Arms shall remain in the Fort, except what is hereafter specified.


2. The Garrison shall have leave to provide themselves of Bread and Meat for two days, and to carry with them all their Coffee, Sharbet, Cloaths and other Moveables.


3 His Highness of 
Lorrain
 shall fur¦nish the Garrison a certain Number of Waggons, to carry their Goods to the Water, to be Transported down∣wards.


4. Some Boats shall also be given to the said Garrison, to be made use of for transporting their Effects; and if they cannot carry them off all at once, they may send for them at several times.


5. That if the afore said Baggage can∣not be Transported all at once, the Garrison may put what is left behind into some Houses of the Lower Town, which shall be kept by some of their Men, that all the rest may honestly and without Let or Molestation follow after.


6. Since the Boat-men cannot be spared at present, the Garrison shall be obliged to make use of their own men, to go down and up the River with the Boats.


7. The afore-mentioned Articles being granted to the Garrison, the Gate of the Castle shall immediately be opened to the 
Imperial
 Troops, that they may take their Post there,

 and so soon as the aforesaid Waggons and Boats shall be ready, the Garrison of the Fort of 
Gran,
 that is to say, they who are capable to bear Arms, shall march out all at once.


8. All the Christian Prisoners in the Castle shall be released.


9. Lastly, the Garrison may freely march out, as hath been said, with their Wives and Children, Arms and Baggage, Horses and Camels, observ∣ing the Conditions above-mentioned, in the manner as they are expressed.


In consequence of this Capitulation, the Prince of 
Alepah
 of 
Syria,
 Comman∣der in 
Gran,
 and 
Basha
 of 
Nicopolis,
 and 
Samson Basha
 Colonel of the 
Janissa∣ries,
 marched out of the place with Five hundred Men carrying Arms to go to 
Offen;
 whereupon the Duke of 
Lorrain,
 made Governor of 
Gran
 Co∣lonel 
Calowith
 Governor of the Castle of 
Presbourg,
 with a Garrison of 1000. 
Imperial
 Souldiers, and some Hundreds of 
Hussars.








THE BATTLE OF GRAN.


AUgust
 the 16. 1685. The Dukes of 
Lorrain
 and 
Bavaria
 raised the Siege that the 
Turks
 had laid down before 
Gran,
 and then engaged the 
Barbarians,
 to the number of Fifty or Sixty Thousand men, gave them a total Rout, and obliged them to aban∣don their Camp and Baggage; which Victory Three days after was fol∣lowed with the taking of 
Newheu∣sel.


It will not be improper, I think, in this place to insert the Letter which about that time, the 
Serasquier Ibrahim Basha
 wrote to his Highness the Duke of 
Lorrain,
 which he sent by the 
Defte∣dar
 of the 
Timmariot
's 
Achmet Desquelebi
 by the Advice of the 
Grand Signior,
 the Contents whereof are word for word as follows.






To our good Friend the Duke of 
Lor∣rain,
 Generalissimo of the Armies of the Emperour of the 
Germans,
 Greeting: 


We let you know as a good Friend, that 
Ach∣met Desquelebi Deftedar,
 or Commis∣sary of 
Newheusel,
 hath reported that we your Friend, ought to send you Letters, to which you might give Credit, if we desire to see a Negotiation for Peace: It is for that Cause that the present are Writ∣ten and sent to you; and seeing we your Friends desire for the service of the Crea∣tures of God, that means of Tranquillity might be found out for the Subjects of both Parties, what we say to you and beseech, as well as what we shall do (in pursuance of our Word) hath been approved (for so is the Will of God) by the Majesty of our re∣splendent, Omnipotent, and formidable Emperor and King of the Superfice of the Earth; wherefore we send you this Man, to whom we have entrusted some things to be told you by word of Mouth, to the end you may be pleased to send us a trusty Man on your part, to endeavour a Peace, it is hoped we may come to a Conference; where∣upon Farewel. Given in the Camp at 
Pest:
 


Signed, 
IBRAHIM.












CHAP. XV.




 Of the Ceremonies observed in the Coro∣nations of the Kings and Queens of 
Hungary.




AFter all necessary Preparations have been made for the Solem∣nity of the Coronation, the Ceremo∣nies of it are performed in this manner: In the first place, an Election is made of those who are to go and fetch the Crown, Scepter, Globe, representing the World, Sword, Coat of Arms, the Royal Habits, and Cross, in the City of 
Presbourg,
 where they are kept, with the Standards of the King∣dom. They discharge this Duty, and carry them to the Church. The Pa∣latin takes the Crown, and places it on the right side of the Altar, where the Arch-bishop of 
Strigonium
 says Mass; the Prelates sit about the Steps of the Altar, and some of them lead the King from the Throne to the Al∣tar, or from the Altar to his Seat; the

 rest serve for some other Action of the Coronation. The Kings Throne dec∣ked with Cloth of Gold, is pretty near the Altar, and opposite to the middle of it, having over it a Cloth of State, of the same Stuff as that of the Seat. The King kneels first upon the Steps of the Altar, and Kisses the Cross, which the Arch-Bishop of 
Stri∣gonium
 presents to him; then takes the Oath contained in the 
Roman
 Pontifi∣cal, saying the Words after the Arch-bishop, and laying his Right hand on the Gospel, with Eyes lifted up to Heaven, as if he called God to wit∣ness. After the Oath, he is anointed by the Arch-bishop on the right Arm near the Elbow, and betwixt the two Shoulders: Then being cloathed with the Coat of Arms of King St. 
Stephen,
 he receives from the same Arch-Bishop, the naked 
Cuttelas
 of the same Saint, then gives it back to the Arch-bishop, who returns it into the Scabbard, and then girds it to his side. That being done, the King turned towards the Altar, as Defender of the Altars, Re∣ligion, and the Church, draws the Sword out of the Scabbard,

 and brandishing it three ways in the Air gives so many blows; then the Arch-Bishop taking the Crown, gives it to the Palatin, who holding it up on high with both his Hands, and being upon the Steps of the Altar, asks aloud all that are present, if they would have him Crown'd for their King, and having three times put the same que∣stion unto them, upon their answer∣ing in the Affirmative, he is crowned, and receives from the Arch-Bishop the Scepter in the right hand, the Globe in the left, and all the marks of Roy∣al Dignity: After that he sits down on the Throne, as taking Possession of the Kingdom. Then all the 
Hun∣garians
 make loud Shouts and Accla∣mations, wishing the King a long and prosperous Reign, and at the same time, the Vocal and Instrumental Mu∣sick, the Trumpets, Drums, and Can∣non, mingle their noise with the confused Voices. Mass being said, and the Streets, through which the King is to go, being Boarded and co∣vered with White, Green, and Red Cloth, the King walks from the Church, where he was, to another,

 wearing the Crown and Coat of Arms, some carrying before him the Royal Ornaments and Standards, and a great many others walking before and after him. At the same time pieces of Gold and Silver are scattered a∣mong the People, in all the Streets through which the King passes, who coming to the other Church, sits down on the Royal Throne erected there, and makes some Knights, striking them thrice on the Back with the naked Sword of St. 
Stephen,
 as they are knee∣ling before him. This being done, he comes out of the Church, and mount∣ing on Horse back, with the Crown and Coat of Arms, having the same per∣sons on Horse-back, who walked be∣fore or followed him on foot, as he came in the same Order he goes out of the Town, and alighting, with the Arch-bishop of 
Strigonium
 mounts up upon a Theater, where lifting up the Right hand he takes an Oath to the 
Hungarians
 to maintain the Priviledges of the Nobility, do Justice to all, ob∣serve the Laws of the Kingdom, and procure the good of the Publick.


In the mean time all are uncovered, and when he hath taken the Oath, all

 again shout, and amidst the noise of great Guns wish him all sort of Prospe∣rity. Afterwards he mounts a stately and well-managed Horse, and spurs him towards an adjoyning ground, where putting him upon the Carrier, and drawing the Sword of St. 
Stephen,
 he makes in form of a Cross, four stroaks in the Air, turning his Horse very nimbly, as threatning the four Corners of the World, and then there is nothing to be heard but Volleys of great Guns. After this the new King putting his Horse to a Walk, draws near the Lords who are Spectators, and with them goes to his Pallace, where he feasts them, sitting at Table with his Crown and Coat of Arms, and being served by some Ba∣rons and Grandees of the Kingdom, appointed for that Office; and when Dinner is over, they who have the charge of the Crown, and Royal Orna∣ments carry them back to their place.


Now to shew you the Ceremonies of the Coronation of the Queens of 
Hungary,
 I'll give you here an Abridg∣ment of what past when the present Emperess 
Anna Maria of Bavaria
 Pa∣latiness

 of 
Newbourg
 was Crowned Queen of 
Hungary
 in the Town of 
Edimbourg
 in the year 1681. The Emperor in his 
Imperial
 Habits, and the Domestick Crown of the Empire on his Head, went with his Attendants to the Church of the 
Recollets,
 where he was received and sprinkled with Holy Water by the Clergy of 
Hunga∣ry.


The Train of the Empress came after, before whom Count 
John Dras∣kowich
 walked with the Scepter, in place of Count 
Draskowich,
 the Ste∣ward of the Kingdom went before. The Counts 
Stephen Zichy
 and 
Christo∣pher Erdedy,
 both Keepers of the Crown, came next, with the Lords who carried the Royal Jewels upon Cushions of Crimson Velvet. Count 
Illishazi
 carried the Silver Cross, Count 
Nicholas Erdedy
 the Scepter, the Pala∣tin of 
Hungary
 the Crown, and Count 
Nicholas Draskowich
 the Globe of the Empire. The 
Empress
 came after these, led by the Duke of 
Diederichstein
 Master of the Palace. The Countess of 
Rapach
 chief Governante carried up her Train, which was embroidered

 with Gold, Diamonds and Pearls, and after her came the Palatiness and other Ladies of Court. The Emperess was received at the Entry into the Church, by the Arch-Bishops of 
Colocza
 and 
Neutra,
 who led her to the Throne. In the mean time the Emperour ha∣ving taken his place on the side of the Gospel, went also to his Throne in the middle of the Quire over against the great Altar, behind the Throne sate the Palatiness with the chief Go∣vernante and other Ladies of Court, in Chaires prepared for them. On the left hand of the Empresses Throne were the Lords of 
Hungary,
 who carri∣ed the Jewels of the Kingdom, which were taken from them by the Arch-Bishop who put them upon the Altar. Before the Throne there was a Silver Stool, where the Domestick Crown, which was brought to the Church un∣der a Cover, was placed. That being done the Gospel was read, at the end whereof the Emperour went to the Altar with the Crown on his Head, the Scepter in his Right Hand, and the Globe in the Left, and presented the Empress to the

 Arch-bishops to be crowned. When his Imperial Majesty had taken his place, the Empress advanced towards the Altar, assisted by the Arch-bishops, and kneeled upon the first Step, whilst the Arch-bishop of 
Gran
 kissed the end of the Cross, and presented her the Scepter and Globe of the Empire, which she took, the Scepter in her right hand, and the Globe in the left, the Prelate all the while saying some Prayers. That Ceremony being over, the Empress was led back to the Throne, where the Arch-bishop hav∣ing again said some Prayers, 
Te Deum
 was sung during a Volly of 480. Musket∣shot, and a discharge of the Artillery upon the Rampart. Then Count 
John Draskowich
 took the Scepter and Globe of the Empire out of the hands of the Empress, in place of the Steward of 
Hungary,
 and gave them back to those who had carried them before. That being done, the Empress was led to the Offering by the Arch-bishops, and put a rare piece of Gold of Gold-Smiths work into a Silver Bason that was up∣on the Altar, and then returned to her Throne. The Domestick Crown was

 taken off of the Head of the Empress by the Bishop of 
Neutra,
 during the Offering and Communion, and given to be held by the Duke of 
Diedericksteyn,
 who after the Communion gave it back to the said Prelate, to be put up∣on the Head of the Empress again. The aforesaid Bishop led her to the Communion, which being given her by the hand of the Arch-bishop of 
Gran,
 the Crown was put upon her Majesties head. The Ceremonies thus performed, they returned in the same Order as they came, with the noise of Cannon, and the Ladies were ad∣mitted to kiss her Hand. When they were at Table, his Imperial Majesty ordered the Artillery once more to play, which concluded the Solemnity.








CHAP. XVI.




 Of the Description of 
Transilvania,
 an∣ciently united to 
Hungary,
 and the Princes who have Reigned in it, since the beginning of this Age, to the present time.




TRansilvania,
 a Principality of 
Eu∣rope,
 is part of the Ancient 
Dacia,
 to the West of 
Hungary,
 and to the East of 
Moravia,
 having the 
Carpathian
 Mountains to the North, and 
Walachia
 to the South. It is four days journey in length, and as much in breadth: That Name was given it by the 
Romans,
 because it is incompassed with Forrests as well as Mountains. The 
Hungari∣ans
 call it 
Erdely,
 and the 
Germans Si∣ben bergen;
 because of Seven Towns which the fugitive 
Saxons
 built there. Several other People settled there; but the 
Saxons
 I speak of cultivated the Country best. The 
Romans
 after∣wards became Masters of it under 
Tra∣jan:


 In process of time it was united to 
Hungary,
 from which it was dismem∣bred in the year 1541. At present the Princes of it are Elective & Tributary to the 
Turk.
 The Town of 
Transilva∣nia
 are 
Hermenstadt, Clausenbourg, Wei∣senbourg,
 or 
Alba-Julia,
 &c. It is a fertile Country, and hath several Mines and Medicinal Plants. Most of the Inhabitants are 
Greeks, Schismaticks;
 there are in it also a great many 
Here∣ticks,
 and some 
Mahometans.


The Princes of 
Transilvania,
 who have reigned since the beginning of this Age, are these that follow.


1. 
Sigismond Bathori,
 Knight of the Golden Fleece, Son to 
Christopher
 Prince of 
Transilvania,
 who died in the year 1581. succeeded to his Fa∣ther in that Principality, and died at 
Prague
 the 17. of 
March
 1603.


2. 
Stephen Bodtskey
 introduced himself by force into that Principality, and his Usurpation was approved by the 
Turk,
 and at length by the Empe∣ror upon certain Conditions; he died of Poyson in the year 1606. and named for his Successor 
Valen∣tine Homonay;
 but the States of the

 Country preferred 
Sigismond Ragot∣ski
 before him.


3. 
Sigismond Ragotski
 was elected Prince of 
Transilvania
 in the year 1606. but having reigned a year, he resigned that Dignity to 
Gabriel Ba∣thory
 Nephew to Prince 
Sigismond
 in 1608. 
Sultan Achmet
 confirmed that choice, and the King of 
Hun∣gary,
 the Arch-Duke 
Matthias
 did not oppose it.


4. 
Gabriel Bathory
 was elected Prince of 
Transilvania
 in the year 1608. and was assassinated at 
Valencze
 in the year 1613.


5. 
Bethlen Gabor
 who had had a great Hand in that Death, being suppor∣ted by the 
Turks,
 seized the State and caused himself to be proclaim∣ed Prince of 
Transilvania
 in the year 1613. and by a Treaty made with the Emperor in 1622. he continued Prince of 
Transilvania.
 He died the 15. of 
November
 1629.


6. 
George Ragotski
 Prince of 
Transilva∣nia
 succeeded to him; he died of his Wounds at 
Waradin
 in the Month of 
June
 1660.


7. 
Achatius Barchay
 by the 
Turks
 intro∣duced into that Principality in place of 
Ragotski,
 resigned it some time after, and was beheaded about the end of the said year 1660,


8. When 
John Kemeni
 was chosen Prince, who was killed in the year. 1661.


9. 
Michael Abafti
 Count of 
Sicules,
 Prince of 
Transilvania
 who Reigns at present, was chosen in the year 1661. by the Assistance of the 
Turks.








CHAP. XVII.




 Of the 
Turkish
 Emperors, who in Pro∣gress of time have invaded, subdued, and usurped the greatest part of 
Hun∣gary.




SOlyman,
 called the Magnificent, Son of 
Sultan Selim,
 immediately af∣ter the death of his Father, whom he had poysoned, took 
Belgrade,
 and the Isle of 
Rhodes,
 was the first that inva∣ded the Kingdom of 
Hungary,
 and with his Armies passed the Rivers of 
Save
 and 
Drave,
 in the year 1526. He was Victorious in the Famous Battle of 
Mohacz,
 which I mentioned before, wherein 
Loüis
 II. King of 
Hungary
 un∣fortunately perished. At 
Bagdet
 he was crowned King of 
Persia,
 and sub∣jected 
Assyria,
 and 
Mesopotamia:
 He made six Expeditions into 
Hungary,
 and took the strong Towns of 
Strigo∣nium
 and 
Alba-Regalis:
 He also sub∣jected 
Aladulia,
 and the Kingdom of 
Aden;
 besides many other Towns up∣on

 the 
Red-Sea:
 He made 
Algiers
 Tri∣
utary, took 
Pialli, Tripoli,
 and the 
Gerbes,
 and after all these Victories whilst he besieged the strong Town of 
Siget
 in the lower 
Hungary,
 he died 
n 
Five-Churches,
 as hath been menti∣oned before.


This Emperour took to himself the 
ollowing Titles, in the Credential Letters of the Ambassador, whom 
e sent to the Emperour 
Ferdi∣
and.




I the Lord of all Lords, the Ruler of the East and West, who am able to do, and 
ot to do whatsoever I please. Lord of all
 Grecia, Persia, 
and
 Arabia, 
Ruler over 
ll things that can be Subject to a King 
nd Lord; the Great
 Hero 
of these Times, 
nd mighty Giant of this vast universe; Lord of the White and Black Seas, and 
he Holy City of
 Mecha, 
shining with the Brightness of God, of the City of
 Medina, 
nd the Holy and Chaste City of
 Jerusa∣
em; 
King of the most Noble Kingdom of
 Egypt; 
Lord of the Country of
 Ionia, 
and Cities of
 Athens 
and
 Sena, 
of the Holy Temple of God
 Zabilon 
and
 Bassio, Ret∣
aam 
and
 Magadim, 
the Seat and Throne 
f the Great King
 Nashin Rettham, 
and

 Lord of the Island of
 Algiers, 
and Prince of the Kingdom of
 Tartary, Mesopota∣mia, 
the
 Medes, Georgians, 
and of all
 Greece, Morea 
and
 Anatolia, Asia, Armenia, Walachia, Moldavia, 
and all
 Hungary, 
with a great many other Kingdoms and Dominions, whereof I am Emperour, that thrice great
 Caesar, Sul∣tan Solyman, 
the Son of the great Em∣peror
 Sultan Selim, 
who have Authority from God to Rule all People in a bit of Iron, and power to open the Gates and Doors of all Cities and strong Holds, all the ends of the Earth, none excepted are delivered into my Hands; I the Lord of the East from the Land of
 Tscin 
to the utmost bounds of
 Africa, 
whom God hath made a valiant Warriour in the edge of the Sword, amongst whose most potent King∣doms the impregnable Castle of
 Cesarea, 
is reckoned the least, and the Empire or Dominion of
 Alexander 
the Great the meanest of my Hereditary Dominions; with me is the Strength of the whole World, and Virtue of the Firmament.




Zelim
 II. Emperor of the 
Turks,
 Son of 
Sultan Solyman
 II. called the Mag∣nificent, succeeded to him in the year 1566. being about Fourty two years

 of Age; this Emperor having subje∣cted 
Nicosia
 and 
Famagusta,
 seized the Island of 
Cyprus,
 a Kingdom belong∣ing to the 
Venetians
 in the year 1521. but after that loss the 
Christians
 gained the Famous Battle of 
Lepanto,
 the 7th. of 
October
 the same year. 
Haly Basha
 was killed there, and it is not doubted, but that it was the greatest Blow that the 
Ottoman
 Empire had for a long time received; and, indeed, if the 
Christi∣ans
 had known how to make the best Advantage of that Victory, they might without doubt have taken 
Con∣stantinople,
 where all were in a gene∣ral Consternation: And to see how great a Victory that of the 
Christian
 Princes was, we may only read the Triumphal Inscription exposed by the 
Romans
 in the Capitol, in memory of it, and of 
Marco Antonio Colonna
 Duke of 
Paliano,
 Knight of the Golden Fleece, Great Constable of 
Naples,
 whom Pope 
Pius
 V. made General of the Ecclesiastical Forces, who solemn∣ly received the Standard in St. 
Peter
's Church at 
Rome,
 and who in that memorable Battle commanded as Lieutenant General, being upon his

 return received in Triumph in the City of 
Rome.

Selim
 the 
Turkish
 Emperor, died of an Apoplexy the Thirteenth of 
De∣cember
 1574.


Amurath
 III. Son of 
Selim
 II. began to Reign about the end of the year 1574. He presently put to death five of his Brothers, according to the Cru∣el custom of the 
Ottomans,
 and refus∣ed to prolong with the Emperor 
Maxi∣milian
 II. the Truce which he had concluded with 
Selim
 II. He took 
Tauris
 which he Plundered, and de∣feated the 
Marovites
 and 
Drus
 of Mount 
Libanus:
 After that he made a powerful Invasion into the Country of the 
Croats,
 who were worsted at first, but they afterwards killed Ten thousand 
Turks,
 and obliged the rest to let them live in quiet. 
Amurath
 di∣ed at 
Constantinople,
 the 18th. of 
Ja∣nuary,


 1595. at the Age of Forty eight.


Mahomet
 III. Son of 
Amurath
 III. began his Reign in the year 1595. by the death of One and Twenty of his Brothers, and Ten of his Fathers Wives whom he left with Child, and whom he caused to be thrown into the Sea. He never was at the Head of his Ar∣my but once. The Christians under the Conduct of Count 
Mansfield
 took 
Strigonium, Alba-Regalis
 under the Command of the Duke of 
Mercaur
 in the year 1601. and the Lower Town of 
Buda,
 under the Arch-Duke of 
Austria.
 He lost the Forts of 
Vice grad, Balbocz, Petrinia, Haduan, Palota
 and 
Vesprin;
 and on the other side the Knights of 
Malta
 seized 
Lepanto.
 The Armies of 
Mahomet
 were beaten by the Vaivod of 
Walachia,
 and by the Prince of 
Transilvania,
 who defeated 
Sinan Basha,
 and so 
Moldavia, Wala∣ohia
 and 
Transilvania
 shook off the 
Ottoman
 yoke. The 
Turks
 on the o∣ther hand had some advantages, and re-took two or three Towns, as 
Pest Canisa
 and 
Alba-Regalis,
 but that was not comparable to their losses. 
Maho∣met


 demanded Peace of the Christi∣ans, who refused it. He was an In∣famous Man, so plunged into Debau∣chery, that neither domestick Disor∣ders, nor Forreign Wars could ever make him forsake it; that made the 
Janisaries
 mutiny; to pacifie whom 
Mahomet
 was forced to deliver up his greatest Friends to their Rage, and pre∣tended to banish his Mother, who was thought to be the cause of all the Ca∣lamities of the State. He caused his eldest Son to be Strangled, and the 
Sultana
 the Mother of him to be drow∣ned, having suspected her to be Guil∣ty of some Treason against his Person. He died of the Plague at 
Constantino∣ple
 in the year 1603. the Thirty ninth year of his Age, and Eighth year of his Reign.


Achmet
 I. of that name, Emperor, of the 
Turks,
 Succeeded to his Father, 
Mahomot
 III. at the Age of Fifteen years, in the year 1603. His Mode∣ration was admired upon his coming to the Throne, in that having but one only Brother, he did not put him to death according to the Custom of the 
Turkish
 Princes; but shut him up in

 a Cloyster of 
Mahometans.
 The 
So∣phy
 of 
Persia
 taking the advantage of his Minority, re-took 
Tauris
 and 
Er∣zerum. Achmet
 sent thither the 
Basha Ci∣gale,
 who not having acquitted himself well of his Commission, was upon his re∣turn Strangled by 50. 
Capigis
 who met him at 
Bursa. Achmet
 regained 
Transil∣vania, Walachia
 and 
Moldavia
 by the means of 
Botskay,
 who revolted from the Emperor, and sided with 
Bethlem Gabor
 against 
Sigismond Bathory
 Prince of 
Transilvania.
 Afterwards finding himself Attacked on all hands, he put Four Armies into the Field; one against the 
Persians,
 another against the 
Poloni∣ans,
 one to oppose the 
Cossacks,
 and the last to guard the Tribute of 
Egypt;
 but all of them having been unfortu∣nate, as he was preparing for greater designs, he died the 15th. of 
November
 1617. in the Thirtieth year of his Age and Fourteenth of his Reign.


Mustapha,
 Emperor of the 
Turks
 was Son to 
Mahomet
 III. and Brother to 
Achmet
 I. he succeeded to him though he had a Son 
Osman
 Twelve years old in the year 1617. 
Mustapha
 being Twenty five years of Age was placed

 upon the Throne by the 
Janisaries,
 who two Months after degraded him, being displeased at his reserved way of living. 
Osman
 his Nephew Succeeded to him, and 
Mustapha,
 as some say, led a recluse and solitary Life: But the truth is he was in Prison; howe∣ver being brought out by the 
Janisa∣ries,
 he was again set upon the Throne the 19. of 
May
 1622. Next day after he caused his Nephew 
Osman
 to be put to death, and having Reigned six∣teen Months, the People being dis∣satisfied with his Conduct, he was again confined to perpetual Imprison∣ment in the Month of 
September
 1623. and 
Amurath
 Brother to 
Osman
 was put in his place.


Osman,
 Emperor of the 
Turks,
 was the Son of 
Achmet
 I. and succeeded to him at Twelve years of Age about the end of 
January
 1621. He led an Army of almost Four hundred thou∣sand men against the 
Poles;
 but that Expedition was not prosperous; he lost above an Hundred thousand men, a∣tempting to force the Camp of Three∣score thousand 
Poles
 and 
Cosa
ks,


 Commanded by Prince 
Ladislaus. Os∣man
 was obliged to make a Peace on disadvantageous Conditions. He thought that the 
Janisaries
 had much contributed to that unhappy Success, which made him have a mind to ca∣shier them, and he was accused of having a design to remove the seat of the Empire unto 
Damascus
 in 
Syria.
 That insolent Militia revolted and the Unfortunate Prince was Strang∣led the 20. of 
May,
 1622. dy Order of 
Mustapha
 his Uncle, whom the same 
Janisaries
 had raised to the Throne, as I said before. 
Osman's
 Reign lasted but Four years, and about four Months. Sultan 
Osman
 took the following Ti∣tles, in a Letter which he wrote at the desire of the most Christian King to Basha 
Ferrovi
 and to 
Mula Cadi
 of 
Jerusalem,
 to restore the 
Cordeliers
 to the possession of 
Bethlehem
 and of the Holy Sepulchre in 
Jerusalem,
 which places had been possessed by the 
Ar∣menians
 in the year 1625.




The Emperor
 Osman, 
Son of the Em∣peror
 Achmet, 
always Victorious; I who am by the infinite Graces of the Almighty Creator, and by the abundant Miracles of

 the chief of the Prophets, Emperour of Vi∣ctorious Emperours, Distributor of Crowns to the greatest Princes of the Earth, Kee∣per of the two sacred and most august Ci∣ties, the fairest amongst all those of the World
 Mecha 
and
 Medina, 
Protector of the Holy
 Jerusalem, 
Lord of the great∣est part of
 Europe, Asia, 
and
 Africa, 
conquered with our Victorious Sword, to wit, of the Countries and Kingdoms of
 Greece, Themeswar, Bosne, Seget, Natolia, Caramania, Egypt, 
and of all the Countries of the
 Parthians, Curdes 
and
 Georgians, 
of the
 Iron-Gate, 
of the Countries of the Prince of the little
 Tar∣tars, Cyprus, Diarbeck, Aleppo, Er∣zerum, Damascus, Babylon, 
the
 Bal∣zaradick, Arabians, Abechy, Thunis, Tripoli, Barbary, 
and of so many other Countries, Isles, Streights, Passages, Peo∣ple, Families, Generations and of so many Thousand millions of valiant Soldiers, who rest under the Obedience and Justice of me, who am Emperor
 Osman, 
Son of the Em∣peror
 Achmet, 
of the Emperor
 Maho∣met, 
of the Emperor
 Amurath, 
of the Emperor
 Selim, 
of the Emperor
 Solyman, 
by the Grace of God, the Retreat of the greatest Princes of the

 World, and Refuge of the most honorable Emperors.




Amurath
 IV. was the Son of 
Achmet,
 and Brother of 
Osman;
 after the Death of 
Achmet,
 the 
Janisaries
 as we have said, put 
Mustapha
 his Brother upon the Throne, and afterwards having sent him back again to Prison, they crowned 
Osman.
 But in the sequel the same Insolent Militia re-called 
Mustapha,
 who caused 
Osman
 to be strangled, and the Government of that Prince, being disagreeable unto them, they remanded him to Prison. 
Amurath
 at the Age of fifteen years was saluted Emperor in the Month of 
Sep∣tember
 1623. and in the year 1626. he besieged 
Bagdet;
 but the 
Persians
 de∣fended themselves so vigorously, that in the year 1630. the 
Turks
 were for∣ced to withdraw. 
Amurath
 had the Trouble of losing 
Hali Basha,
 and di∣vers places, which the 
Persians
 and 
Ara∣bians
 took from him. Besides that, the 
Poles
 and 
Cossacks,
 gave him the allarm so hot, that the 
Viziers
 were resolved to dethrone him, if the Peace, which he made with these People, had not al∣tered their minds. 
Amurath
 concerned

 himself indirectly in the Affairs of the Protestants of 
Germany,
 at the Sollicita∣tion and under the Conduct of 
Ragot∣ski;
 but it happened to the Confusion of both. He had at length the Plea∣sure to be revenged on the 
Persians.
 In the year 1638. He set out into the Field, as it is thought, one of the most numerous Armies that ever the 
Otto∣mans
 had on foot, and making use of the favourable juncture of the War betwixt the 
Persians
 and 
Mogols,
 he be∣sieged 
Bagdet,
 and took it in fourty days time. 
Amurath
 enjoyed not that Victory long, for his Debauches brought him to his Grave the 8th of 
Fe∣bruary
 1640. in the Two and thirtieth year of his Age.


This 
Amurath
 IV. in a Letter which he wrote to the King of 
Hungary
 in the year 1640. took the following Ti∣tles.




By the Grace of the Almighty God in Heaven, we
 Soly-Mahomet 
only God upon Earth, full of invincible Graces, and Omnipotent Emperour of
 Babylon in Ju∣dea, 
from the Sun-rising to its Setting, King of all the Kings of the Earth, King of all
 Arabia 
and
 Media, 
Duke sprung

 from the Noble Stem of
 Greece 
and
 Ar∣menia, 
born Triumphant King of
 Jeru∣salem, 
Lord and Protector of the Holy Se∣pulcher of Christ Crucified.




Ibrahim,
 Emperor of the 
Turks,
 was the Son of 
Achmet,
 and succeeded to his Brother 
Amurath
 IV. in the year 1640. When this last died the Officers of the Port had a great deal ado, to make him come out of the place where he had been in a manner Prisoner for three or four years, suspecting it to be only a pretext to render him Criminal. The 
Sultana
 his Mother persuaded him of the truth, having shown him the dead Body of his Brother, he came out, and having been crown'd, he gave himself wholly over to Voluptu∣ousness, which was fatal unto him. The loss of one of his 
Sultana
's, whom the Knights of 
Malta
 took in the year 1644. betwixt 
Rhodes
 and 
Alexandria,
 made him undertake to be revenged on 
Malta.
 But he turned his Arms a∣gainst 
Candie,
 and took the 
Canea
 in 1645. In the mean time he grew cru∣el, his Pleasures made him abandon all care of the Affairs of the Empire, and he became insupportable to all Men.

 The Militia and Officers conspired a∣gainst him, and sent for the 
Mufti
 and other considerable Persons of the Law, on design at first to put to Death the 
Grand Visier:
 Then they resolved to depose 
Ibrahim,
 who expressing a great Contempt, and much Haughtiness, did so incense those mutinous Spirits, that they strangled him the 18th. of 
August
 1649. and placed 
Mahomet
 his Son up∣on the Throne.


Mahomet
 IV. was Born the second of 
January
 1642. and was raised to the Throne ten days after the Death of 
Sultan Ibrahim
 his Father, who was strangled by the 
Janisaries.
 In the years 1663. and 1664. He took in 
Hun∣gary
 the Towns of 
Newheusel, Fort-Se∣rin
 or 
Serin-wart,
 afterwards demolish∣ed, and some other places. The loss he sustained at the Battle of 
Raab
 or 
St. Godard
 made him resolve to make Peace, which he did the 17th. of 
Sep∣tember
 1664. He hath been more un∣fortunate in the present War, where∣in he hath lost 
Gran, Newheusel
 and a great many other strong Places and Battles mentioned before. He took the City of 
Candie
 in the year 1669.

 after a very long and tough Siege. The 
Venetians
 have taken many impor∣tant Places from him in this War, both in the 
Morea
 and elsewhere. His great∣est delight is in Hunting, wherein he spends most part of the year. For that reason it is that he resides commonly at 
Adrianople,
 that he may be near the places where there is most Game. He goes often to 
Larissa,
 and spends some∣times Eight or Ten Days together un∣der magnificent Tents, pitched half a League from that Town upon the Banks of the 
Peneus.
 The 
Turks
 in his time have made many Conquests from the 
Poles,
 from whom they have taken 
Caminiec,
 and some other places. 
Sobieski
 great Mareshal of the Crown, and at present King of 
Poland,
 was at that time General of the 
Polonian
 Ar∣my, who defeated the 
Turks
 at the Fa∣mous Battle of 
Gotzchin
 in the year 1673. He eluded their Projects the two years following, and at length re∣duced them to desire a Peace. Since that, the 
Turks
 undertook a War a∣gainst the 
Moscovites,
 and got some ad∣vantages over them in the year 1678. and the 
Poles
 having confederated with

 the Emperor and Republick of 
Venice
 in the year 1683. continue to Harass and make head against them in 
Podolia, Russia,
 and the neighbouring Territo∣ries. These are the Titles that 
Ma∣homet
 IV. takes to himself.

 Mahomet, 
son of the Emperor
 Ibrahim, 
by the Grace of God, the Retreat of the greatest Princes of the World, and the Refuge of honourable Em∣perors.




This Prince 
Mahomet
 IV. has Chil∣dren: the 
Sultana
 Queen, who is his chief Wife, brought him his first Son, she is called 
Eumenia,
 a Greek by Nati∣on; he hath a Brother called 
Solyman
 and his eldest Brother named 
Osman,
 is a Dominican Monk, called 
Father Dominick of St.
 Thomas, who was ta∣ken with his Mother by the Galleys of 
Malta
 sayling to 
Alexandria
 upon a Pilgrimage to 
Mecha.
 This Emperor is the greatest Enemy of Christendom: May Heavens grant, that the projects of that Infidel Prince against the Chri∣stian Religion, may be disapointed, and that the proud Empire of the Crescent may one day be subject to the glorious Standard of the Cross, un∣der the Auspices of that great 
Caesar,
 who under the lovely name of 
Leopold
 hath merited to be the first, and XIV. Emperor of the most 
August
 House of 
Austria,
 who by his great Prudence and exemplary Piety, by his Constant and indefatigable Pains, and by the Grace of the Great God of Armies, hath happily procured to Christendom, all these great Victories to the shame and confusion of that fierce and barbarous common

 Enemy, and under the Conduct of the Valiant 
Charles
 IV. Duke of 
Lor∣rain,
 that brave 
Hero,
 to whom Chri∣stendom is obliged, that it had time to Relieve 
Vienna,
 when with unparal∣led Speed he marched thither, and in view of the Enemy supplied the place with Provisions, Ammunition and 12000 of the best men in the Army, who defeated the 
Turks
 and Rebels before 
Presbourg;
 that having taken that Town, had a design, to make a Bridge there over the 
Danube,
 thereby to fa∣cilitate the passage of the 
Turkish
 Con∣voys to their Camp before 
Vienna,
 who flew like lightening to save the King of 
Poland
 from the extream Dan∣ger wherein he was, being engaged with the Body of the 
Ottoman
 Army near 
Barkan,
 and who after gained the Battle of 
Barkan
 that we mention∣ed before. This is that Prince who considering that his Glorious Prede∣cessors have Reigned in 
Jerusalem,
 when they had driven the 
Mahometans
 out of it, hath on that occasion given so many Proofs of his Courage, that it may be said he there revived the 
Lorrain
 Princes, who heretofore Con∣quered

 the East. He hath spared nei∣ther Body nor Heart in following their Footsteps, that he might Crown him∣self with Glory in the Bloody Battle of 
Gran,
 which he gained. He is the very same who hath so often repulsed the Fury of the 
Turks,
 when they were most formidable: It is he, in short, who re-took from the Infidels the strong place of 
Newheusel,
 which serv∣ed them for a Key to open them a passage farther into the Countries of the Christians, and who after the ex∣ample of the Glorious 
Godfrey,
 who filled 
Europe
 with admiration in the year 1096. hath so signalized himself that if he Reign not in 
Jerusalem,
 as his Ancestors have done, he Reigns, at least, in the hearts of those, who have been the Spectators of his Fortitude and Prowess.
