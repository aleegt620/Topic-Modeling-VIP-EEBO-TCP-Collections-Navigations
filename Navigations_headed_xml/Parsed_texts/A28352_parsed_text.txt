TO THE HONORABLE, SIR 
JOHN DANVERS,
 KNIGHT: 
Great Favourer of the Westerne Planta∣tions, and a Member of the Par∣liament of
 England.


Noble Sir:


T
HE great Incouragement that I have found from your Worthy selfe to propogate the Publique Affaires, as well Forraigne as Domestique, hath imbolned mee to presume humbly to present this small Piece of the Dis∣covery of the Westerne Part of 
Virginia,
 wherein you


shall finde by the Industry of the Surveyors of that Part, the great Benefit that may accrew to the Eng∣lish Plantation; in regard of the many and severall Commodities that may thence arise, by reason of the fertility of the Soyle, Nature having provided so plentifully for all things, that with no extraordinary great Charge it may be effected, to the great Profit, and more Glory of this English Nation: And where∣as your selfe hath beene, and still are a Chiefe Agent in that, and other Plantations, so (under God) you may be a meanes for converting divers of those poor Indians to the Christian Faith. For the World doth take notice you observe the Orators saying; 
That you were not borne for your selfe, but for your Country
: Which that you may ever doe, shall be the Prayer,


SIR,


Of your most humble servant,
 J. S.








To the Reader.


W
Ho ever thou art that desirest the Ad∣vancement of Gods glory by conversion of the Indians, the Augmentation of the English Com∣mon-wealth, in ex∣tending its liber∣ties; I would advise thee to consider the present benefit and future profits that will arise in the wel setling 
Virginia's
 Confines, especially that happy Country of 
New Brittaine,
 in the Latitude of 
35.
 and 
37.
 degrees, of more temperate Clymate then that the English now inha∣bite, abounding with great Rivers of long extent, and en∣compassing a great part, or most of 
Virginia's
 Continent; a place so easie to be settled in, in regard that Horse and Cat∣tle in foure or five dayes may be conveyed for the benefit of Ʋndertakers, and all inconveniencies avoyded which com∣monly


commonly attend New Plantations, being supplied with ne∣cessaries from the Neighbourhood of 
Virginia.


That the Assembly of 
Virginia
 (as may be seene by their Order since my returne heereto procured) have conceived a hundred to be a sufficient force and competence for the esta∣blishment of that Country in which Tobacco will grow larger and more in quantity. Sugar Canes are supposed naturally to be there, or at least if implanted will undoubtedly flourish: For we brought with us thence extraordinary Canes of twen∣ty five foot long and six inches round; there is also great store of fish, and the Inhabitants relate that there is plenty of Salt made to the Sunne without art; Tobacco Pipes have beene seene among these Indians tipt with Silver, and they weare Copper Plates about their necks: They have two Crops of Indian Corne yearely, whereas 
Virginia
 hath but one. What I write, is what I have proved; I cordially wish some more then private Spirits would take it into their considerati∣on, so may it prove most advantagious to particular and pub∣lick ends; for which so prayeth,


Your faithfull servant,
 Edward Bland.








October 20. 1650. By the Assembly.


I
T is Ordered by the Grand Assembly, that according to the Petition of Mr.

The Discovery of 
New Britaine.


A
Ugust 27. 1650. 
The Right Honorable Sir
 W. Berkly, 
Kt. being Governour and Cap∣taine Generall of
 Virginia, Edw. Bland 
Merch.
 Abraham Wood 
Capt.
 Elias Ponnant 
and
 Sackford Brewster 
Gent. foure Men, and one Indian named
 Pyancha, 
an Appamat∣tuck for our Guide, with two servants, foure Horses and Pro∣vision, advanced from Fort
 Henry, 
lying on Appamattuck River at the fals, being a branch of
 James 
River, intending a South westerne Discovery.


This day wee passed over a branch belonging to 
Blackwater
 lake, running South east into 
Chawan
 River; at that place wee were forced to unlade our Carria∣ges by reason of the great raines lately fallen, which otherwise is very passable for foot, being firm gravelly ground in the bottome, and lieth from Fort 
Henry
 20. miles, and some 12. miles from this place we travelled unto a deepe River called the 
Nottaway
 Creeke some 100. paces over sandy bottomes (& with a little labour may be made passeable) unto a 
Nottaway
 Town liyng some two miles from the River. Hither we came within night, and by reason of our suddaine approach and hallowing of 
Robert Farmer
 servant to Mr. 
Bland,
 the Inhabitants ran all away into the Woods, with their Women and Children; therefore by us it was named 
Farmers
 Chase. After our arrivall there with∣in a small space of time one 
Indian
 man appeared, and finding of us peaceable, and the white flag bore be∣fore us by our Guide whom they knew, he made a


hallow and the rest came in from their sculking holes like so many timerous Hares, and shewed us what curtesie they could. About two houres after came to us 
Oyeocker
 elder brother to 
Chounterounte
 one of the 
Nottaway
 Kings, who told us that his brother 
Chounte∣rounte,
 and other of the 
Nottaway
 Kings would come to us next day by Noone, and that the day before 
Chounterounte
 and all his men had been a hunting, and it hapned that 
Chounterounte
 had shot one of his bro∣thers in the leg, and that thereupon he was gone downewards. We stayed untill next day at Noone but he came not, and then we journyed unto the Towne belonging unto 
Oyeocker,
 who kindly invited us thither, and told us he thought that 
Chounterounte
 would meet us there, and also of his owne accord proffered us to be our guide whithersoever we went. The Land generally to this Towne is Champion, ve∣ry rich, and the Towne scituate in a rich levell, well timbered, watered, and very convenient for Hogs and Cattle.


August
 28. We journied with our new entertain∣ed Guide 
Oyeocker,
 lying betweene South, and South and by West, from the first Towne upon a very rich levell of Land: sixteen miles from this place we came unto the River 
Penna
 Mount, being another branch of 
Chawan
 River, eight miles on the South side it hath ve∣ry rich Land and Corn-fields on both sides the River, and is about some 200. paces wide, and runs out with elbowes: at the place of our passage over this River to this second Towne is shallow upon a Sandy Point, and with a very little labour may be made passeable both for foot and horse, or any Carriage by Land,


or pentater with small Boats, and some two miles higher there is a sound passage no deeper then a mans anckle: Within night came 
Chounterounte
 unto our Quarters frowning, and with a countenance noting much discontent, downe he sets, and lookes about him, salutes the English with a scornefull posture, and then our Appamattack Guide, and tels him, I am sorry for thee friend, thou wilt be knockt on the head; after this some pause was made before any discourse, expecting the English would begin, but finding us slow, he thus spake: There was a 
Wainoake Indian
 told him that there was an Englishman a 
Cockarous
 hard by Captaine 
Floods,
 gave this Indian Bells, and other petty truck to lay downe to the 
Tus∣karood
 King, and would have hired him to have gone with him, but the 
Wainoakes
 being doubtfull what to doe, went to Captaine 
Flood
 for advice, who advised them not to go, for that the Governour would give no licence to go thither; heereupon 
Chounterounte
 was by us questioned, when and who it was that had told him so, & if he did know that 
Wainoake
 Indian, to which he answered doubtfully, and demanded of us whither we did intend to go; we told him the 
Tuska∣rood
 King had envited us to trade, and our Governour had ordered us to go, and speake with an Englishman amongst them, and to enquire for an English woman cast away long since, and was amongst those Nations. 
Chounterounte
 perswaded us to go no further, alleadg∣ing there was no English there, that the way was long, for passage very bad by reason of much raine that had lately fallen, and many rotten Marrishes and Swampps there was to passe over, 
in fine
 we


found him, and all his men very unwilling we should go any further; but we told them, that let the waies and passages be never so bad, we were resolved to go through, and that we were not afraid of him nor his Nation, nor any other, for we intended no injury, and that we must go, for we were commanded by our King; these words caused 
Chounterounte
 to assimulate a feare in his countenance, and after delivery of him∣selfe, at our going away next day, when we had moun∣ted our Horses, 
Chounterounte
 came privately unto us, and in a most serious manner intimating unto us, that he loved us, and our Nation, and that he lively ap∣prehended our danger, and that our safety concerned him, for if any accident hapned otherwise then good to us, he should be suspected to have a hand in it, and withall wished us to go no further, for that he cer∣tainly knew that the Nations we were to go through would make us away by treachery; we answered him, that we were not afraid to be killed, for that any one of us were able to deale with forty through the pro∣tection of our great God, for we were commanded by our King.


August
 29. We travelled from this second Town to 
Maharineck,
 eight miles upon barren Champion Lands, and six miles further is a branch that runnes South west, with rich Lands upon it; and from thence some sixe miles further, is a Brooke some hundred paces over, and runnes South and a little to the West, on both sides of the Creek: for fowre miles or there∣abouts, is very rich Lands, well Timbered and Wate∣red, and large dry Meadowes, South and by West: From this Creeke is another, some eight miles off,


that opens it selfe into divers small Guts, made by the inundation of Freshes of Waters; and the pas∣sage lies some two hundred paces from the Path, and this Creek is some ten miles from 
Maharinecke
 Towne, and was by us named 
Newcombs Forrest.
 It was night when we entred into 
Maharineck,
 where we found a House ready made for us of Matts; and Corne stalkes layd in severall places for our Horses, the Inhabitants standing, according to their custome, to greet us: and after some discourse with their 
Wer∣rowance,
 a Youth, to whom wee presented severall gifts, we certified them the cause of our comming was to Trade in way of friendship, and desired the great men that what Wares or Skins the Town did afford, might be brought to our Quarters next mor∣ning; and also a measure for 
Roanoak,
 which they promised should be done, and so left us to our selves a while, untill wee had refreshed our selves with such provisions as they had set before us, in most plenti∣full maner; and afterwards the great men and Inha¦bitants came, and performed divers Ceremonies, and Dancings before us, as they use to doe to their grea
 Emperour 
Apachancano,
 when they entertain him in most solemne maner and friendship.


August
 30. Being wearied with our last dayes tra∣vell, we continued at 
Maharineck,
 and this day spake with a Tuskarood Indian, who told us that the Eng∣lishman was a great way off at the further Tuskarood Towne, and wee hired this Turkarood Indian to run before, and tell his 
Werrowance
 wee intended to lay him downe a present at 
Hocomowananck,
 and desired to have him meete us there, and also wrote to that


effect to the Englishman in English, Latine, Spanish, French and Dutch, the 
Tuskarood
 promised in three dayes to meete us at 
Hocomawananck.
 In the after∣noone came two Indians to our Quarters, one of whom the 
Maharinecks
 told us was the 
Werrowance
 of 
Hocomawananck
 River, seemed very joyfull that wee could goe thither, and told us the 
Tuskarood
 would have come to us to trade, but that the 
Wainoakes
 had spoken much to dishearten them from having any trade with the English, and that they intended divers times to have come in, but were afraid, for the 
Wai∣noakes
 had told them that the English would kill them, or detaine them, and would not let them goe without a great heape of 
Roanoake
 middle high, to which we answered that the 
Wainoakes
 durst nor af∣firme any such thing to our faces, and that they had likewise spoken much against the 
Tuskarood
 to the English, it being a common thing amongst them to villefie one another, and tell nothing but lies to the English.


This day in the morning the 
Maharineck
 great men spake to heare some of our guns go off: Whereupon we shot two guns at a small marke, both hitting it, and at so great a distance of a hundred paces, or more, that the Indians admired at it: And a little before night the old King of 
Maharineck
 came to us, and told us, that the people in the Towne were afraid when the guns went off, and ran all away into the Woods. This night also we had much Dancing.


August
 31. Wee went away from 
Maharineck
 South East two miles to goe over 
Maharineck
 River, which hath a bottome betweene two high land sides


through which you must passe to get over, which River is about two hundred paces broad, and hath a high water marke after a fresh of at least twenty foot perpendicular by the trees in the breaches be∣tweene the River, and the high land of the old fields. This River is the Southerly last and maine branch of 
Chawan
 River, and was by us named 
Woodford
 River, and runs to the Eastward of the South. On both sides of 
Woodford
 River is very much exceeding rich Land, but especially on the further side towards 
Ho∣comawananck.
 Imediately after the passage over this River, are old Indian fields of exceeding rich Land, that beare two Crops of Indian Corne a yeare, and hath timber trees above five foot over, whose truncks are a hundred foot in cleare timber, which will make twenty Cuts of Board timber a piece, and of these there is abundance.


As also exceeding rich Land, full of great Reeds thrice as big as the largest Arrow Reeds we have a∣bout our Plantations; this good Land continues for some six miles together unto a great Swampp, and then begins a pyny barren Champion Land with di∣vers Branches and Pecosans, yet very passeable, run∣ning South and by West, unto a deepe River some a hundred paces over, running South, and a little to the East, which River incloses a small Island which wee named 
Brewsters
 Island, some eighteene miles from 
Woodford
 River due South, and by West, with very ex∣ceeding rich Land on both sides of it for some sixe miles together, and this River we also named 
Brew∣sters
 River, it being the first branch of 
Hocomawananck
 River: and a little lower downe as the River runs, is


such another River as 
Chickahamine
 River (which is a mile broad.)


After we had passed over this River we travelled some twenty miles further upon a pyny barren Champion Land to 
Hocomawananck
 River, South, and by West: some twelve miles from 
Brewsters
 River we came unto a path running crosse some twenty yards on each side unto two remarkeable Trees; at this path our Appamattuck Guide made a stop, and cleared the Westerly end of the path with his foote, being demanded the meaning of it, he shewed an un∣willingnesse to relate it, sighing very much: Where∣upon we made a stop untill 
Oyeocker
 our other Guide came up, and then our Appamattuck Guide journied on; but 
Oyeocker
 at his comming up cleared the o∣ther end of the path, and prepared himselfe in a most serious manner to require our attentions, and told us that many yeares since their late great Emperour 
Appachancano
 came thither to make a War upon the 
Tuskarood,
 in revenge of three of his men killed, and one wounded, who escaped, and brought him word of the other three murthered by the 
Hocomawananck
 Indians for lucre of the 
Roanoake
 they brought with them to trade for Otter skins. There accompanyed 
Appachancano
 severall petty Kings that were under him, amongst which there was one King of a Towne called 
Pawhatan,
 which had long time harboured a grudge against the King of 
Chawan,
 about a yong wo∣man that the King of 
Chawan
 had detayned of the King of 
Pawhatan:
 Now it hapned that the King of 
Chawan
 was invited by the King of 
Pawhatan
 to this place under pretence to present him with a Guift of


some great vallew, and there they met accordingly, and the King of 
Pawhatan
 went to salute and embrace the King of 
Chawan,
 and stroaking of him after their usuall manner, he whipt a bow string about the King of 
Chawans
 neck, and strangled him; and how that in memoriall of this, the path is continued unto this day, and the friends of the 
Pawhatans
 when they passe that way, cleanse the Westerly end of the path, and the friends of the 
Chawans
 the other. And some two miles from this path we came unto an Indian Grave upon the East side of the path: Upon which Grave there lay a great heape of sticks covered with greene boughs, we demanded the reason of it, 
Oyeoc∣ker
 told us, that there lay a great man of the 
Chawans
 that dyed in the same quarrell, and in honour of his maemory they continue greene boughs over his Grave to this day, and ever when they goe forth to Warre they relate his, and others valorous, loyall Acts, to their yong men, to annimate them to doe the like when occasion requires. Some foure miles from 
Ho∣comawananck
 is very rich Champian Land: It was night when we came to 
Hocomawananck
 River, and the Indian that came with us from 
Woodford
 River, and belonged to 
Hocomawananck,
 would have had us quar∣tered upon the side of a great Swampp that had the advantage of severall bottomes of the Swampp on both sides of us, but we removed to take our advan∣tage for safety, and retreate, in case any accident should happen, which at that time promised nothing but danger, for our Guides began to be doubtfull, and told us, that the 
Hocomawananck
 Indians were very treacherous, and that they did not like their counte∣nances,


and shape well; this place we named 
Py∣anchas
 Parke: about three houres after we had taken up our Quarters, some of the Inhabitants came, and brought us roasting cares, and Sturgeon, and the 
Ho∣comawananck
 Indian that came with us from 
Woodford
 River, came not unto us untill next day, but his 
War∣rowance
 told us before wee came from 
Woodford,
 hee could not come untill that day at night. The next day morning after our comming to 
Hocomawananck
 the In∣habitants seemed to prepare us a house: But we a∣bout eight of the clock set forward to goe view the place where they killed Sturgeon, which was some six miles from the place where we quartered by 
Pyan∣chas
 Parke, where there is a River Running very deep South, exceeding deepe, and foure hundred paces broad. The high water marke of this River between both sides of the River perpendicular, from the top of the Banck to the River, is forty five foot upon a fresh; this River was by us named 
Blandina
 River: from 
Py∣anchas
 Parke to the place where they kill Sturgeon is six miles up the River running Northerly, and all ex∣ceeding rich Land: Both upwards and downewards upon the River, at this place where they kill Sturge∣on also are the Falls, and at the foot of these Falls al∣so lies two Islands in a great Bay, the uppermost whereof Mr. 
Blande
 named 
Charles
 Island, and the lowermost Captaine 
Wood
 named 
Berkeley
 Island: on the further side of these Islands the Bay runs naviga∣ble by the two Islands sides: 
Charles
 Island is three miles broad, and foure miles long, and 
Berkeley
 Island almost as big, both in a manner impregnable, by na∣ture being fortified with high Clefts of Rocky Stone,


and hardly passeable, without a way cut through them, and consists all of exceeding rich Land, and cleare fields, wherein growes Canes of a foot about, and of one yeares growth Canes that a reasonable hand can hardly span; and the Indians told us they were very sweet, and that at some time of the yeare they did suck them, and eate them, and of those we brought some away with us. The Land over against 
Charles
 Island we named 
Blands
 Discovery, and the Land over against 
Berkeley
 Island we named 
Woods
 journy, and at the lower end of 
Charles
 Island lies a Bay due South from the said Island, so spatious that we could not see the other side of it: this bay we name∣ed 
Pennants
 Bay, and in the River between 
Charles
 I∣sland, and the maine Land lies a Rocky Point in the River, which Point comes out of 
Charles
 Island, and runs into the middle of the River: this Point we name∣ed 
Brewsters
 Point, and at this Point only, and no o∣ther is there any place passeable into 
Charles
 Island, and this 
Brewsters
 Point runs not quite from 
Charles
 Island to the maine Land, but when you come off the maine Land to the Rivers side, you must wade about fifty paces to come upon the Point, and if you misse the Point on either side, up or downe the River, you must swim, and the River runs very swift. Some three miles from the River side over against 
Charles
 Island is a place of severall great heapes of bones, and heere the Indian belonging to 
Blandina
 River that went a∣long with us to the Fals, sat downe, and seemed to be much discontented, insomuch that he shed teares; we demanded why those bones were piled up so cu∣riously? 
Oyeocker
 told us, that at this place 
Appachan∣cano



one morning with 400. men treacherously slew 240. of the 
Blandina
 River Indians in revenge of three great men slaine by them, and the place we named 
Golgotha
; as we were going to 
Blandina
 River we spake to 
Oyeocker
 our Guide to lead us the way, and he would not; but asked our Appamattuck Guide why we did not get us gone, for the Inhabitants were jealous of us, and angry with us, and that the Runner we sent to the 
Tuskarood
 would not come at the day appointed, nor his King, but ran another way, and told the Indians that we came to out them off; where∣upon our Appamattuck Guide stepped forth, and frowning said, come along, we will go see the Falls, and so led the way, and also told us that the 
Woodford
 Indians lied, and that Indian that came to us, which the 
Woodford
 Indian said was the King of 
Blandina
 Ri∣ver, was not the 
Werrowance
 of 
Blandina
 River; where∣upon we resolved to return (having named the whole Continent 
New Brittaine)
 another way into our old path that led to 
Brewsters
 River, and shot off no guns because of making a commotion, and adding to the Natives feares. At 
Blandina
 River we had some dis∣course with our Appamattuck Guide concerning that River, who told us that that Branch of 
Blandina
 River ran a great way up into the Country; and that about three dayes journy further to the South-West, there was a far greater Branch so broad that a man could hardly see over it, and bended it selfe to the North∣ward above the head of 
James
 River, unto the foot of the great Mountaines, on which River there lived many people upwards, being the 
Occonacheans
 and the 
Nessoneicks,
 and that where some of the 
Occonacheans



lived, there is an Island within the River three dayes journy about, which is of a very rich and fertile soile, and that the upper end of the Island is fordable, not above knee deepe, of a stony bottome, running very swift, and the other side very deepe and navigable: Also we found many of the people of 
Blandina
 River to have beards, and both there, and at 
Woodford
 River we saw many very old men, and that the Climate ac∣cording to our opinions was far more temperate then ours of 
Virginia,
 and the Inhabitants full of Children; they also told us that at the bottome of the River was great heapes of Salt; and we saw among them Cop∣per, and were informed that they tip their pipes with silver, of which some have been brought into this Country, and 'tis very probable that there may be Gold, and other Mettals amongst the hils.


September
 1. About noone from Woods Journey wee travelled some sixe miles North East, unto the old Path that leads to 
Brewsters
 River: within night we quartered on the other side of it, and kept good watch: this Path runnes from Woods Journey north and by East, and due North.


September
 2. In the morning about eight of the clocke, as every one was mounted, came to our quar∣ters 
Occonnosquay,
 sonne to the Tuskarood King, and another Indian whom he told was a 
Werrowance,
 and his Kinseman, with the Runner which wee had sent to the Tuskarood King, who was to meet us at 
Blan∣dina
 River that night; the Kings sonne told us that the English man would be at his house that night, a great way off; and would have had us gone backe with him, but we would not, and appointed him to meete


us at 
Woodford
 River where hee came not, wee having some suspition that hee came from 
Wood∣ford
 River that night, and that our Runner had not beene where we had sent him, through some information of our Nottaway guide, which after∣wards proved true, by the Relation of the 
Werrowance
 of 
Blandina
 River, whom about fowre howres after wee had parted with the Kings son, wee met on the way comming from 
Woodford
 River with a company of men, thinking he should have found us at 
Blandina
 River that night, according to his order and promise; with whom falling into discourse, he told us that the King of the 
Tuskaroods
 son, and our Runner were the night before at 
Woodford
 River; but the Kings son told us he came from 
Blandina
 River, and beyond, and hearing we were gone before he came, he had tra∣velled all night from 
Blandina
 River to overtake us. This day about Noone we came to 
Woodford
 River Towne, and tarried there that night, we found the old 
Werrowance,
 and all his great men gone, yet had courteous quarter; but not without great grounds of suspition, and signes that they were angry at us: at our coming back to 
Woodford
 River we had informa∣tion that some Spies of 
Wainoake
 had been there a lit∣tle before we came, and that the King of 
Wainoake
 and 
Chounterounte
 had sent Runners to all the Nations thereabouts, informing them that the English were come to cut them off, which we supposed to be some greater Polititians then Indian Consultations, who had some private ends to themselves, and minded no∣thing lesse then a publick good; for we found that the Runner whom we imployed to carry our message to


the 
Tuskarood
 King, ran to the 
Waynoakes,
 and he whom the 
Woodford
 Indians told us was the 
Werrowance
 of 
Blandina
 River, was a 
Woodford
 Indian, and no 
Werrow∣ance,
 but done of purpose to get something out of us, and we had information that at that time there were other English amongst the Indians.


September
 3. By breake of day we journied from 
Woodford
 River to a path some eight miles above 
Pen∣nants
 Mount running North, and by East and North, North, East, which was done by the advice of our Appamattuck Guide, who told us that he was infor∣med that some plots might be acted against us, if we returned the way that we came, for we told 
Chounte∣rounte
 we would returne the same way againe: And this information our Guide told us he had from a wo∣man that was his Sweet-heart belonging to 
Woodford
 River. This day we passed over very much rich, red, fat, marle Land, betweene 
Woodford
 River Towne, and the head of 
Pennants
 Mount, with divers Indian fields; the head of which River abounds much with great Rocks of Stone, and is two hundred paces over, and hath a small Island in it named 
Sackfords
 Island. Betweene 
Pennants
 Mount River head, and the head of 
Farmers
 Chase River is very much exceeding rich, red, fat, marle Land, and 
Nottaway
 and 
Schockoores
 old fields, for a matter of sixe miles together all the trees are blowne up or dead: Heere it began to raine, and some six miles further we tooke up our quarters, and it proved a very wet night. At the first other 
Notta∣way
 old fields, we found the Inhabitants much per∣plexed about a gun that went off to the Westward of them, the night before wee came thither, which


our Appamattuck Guide conceived were the Wainoake Spies, set out there to prevent our journyings, and we found severall Agers about the place where the Indians told us the gun went off.


Septemb.
 4. About 8 of the Clock we travelled North, North-East some six miles, unto the head of Farmers Chase River, where we were forced to swimm our horses over, by reason of the great rain that fell that night, which otherwise with a little labour may be made very passable. At this place is very great Rocky stones, fit to make Mill-stones with very rich tracks of Land, and in some places between the head of Farmers Chase River and Black water Lake, is ground that gives very probable proofe of an Iron, or some other rich Mi
e. Some sixteen miles from Far∣mers Chase, North, and by East, and North, North-East, lies Black water Lake, which hath very much rich land about it, and with little labour will be made very passable. From Black water Lake we did travell to the old fields of 
Manks Nessoneicks,
 and from thence some 12 miles N.N East we came unto Fort Henry a∣bout the close of the Evening, all well and in good health, not∣withstanding from the time we had spoken with 
Chounterounte
 at Pennants Mount, we every night kept a strickt watch, having out Swords girt, and our Guns and Pistols by us, for the Indians every night where we lay, kept a strict guard upon us.
