She hath caused to daye moche shame parde

Syr knyght sayd syr Gawayne haue good daye


For on fote I haue a longe waye


n horse were me wonder dere


Somtyme good horses I haue good wone


But now on fote nedes must I gone


God in hast amende my chere


Syr Gawayne was armed passynge heuy


On fote myght he not endure truely


His knyfe he toke in honde


His armoure good he cut hym fro


Elles on fore myght he not go


Thus with care was he bonde


¶ Leue we now syr Gawayne in wo


And speke we more of syr Brandles tho


Whan he with his syster met


He sayd fye on the harlot stronge


It is pyte that thou lyuest so longe


Strypes harde I wyll the set


And bete the bothe backe and syde


And than wolde he not abyde


But to his fader streyte he wente


Than he axed hym how he fared


He sayd sone for the haue I cared


I wende that thou haddest ben shente


Brandles fayd I haue bete my systere


And the knyght I made hym swere


 we mete agayne


 togyder fyght




Tyll at the laste they wanted lyght


They wyst not what to done


Than sayd syr Brandles that knyght so gaye


Syr knyght we wante lyght of the daye


Therfore I make my mone


If we fyght thus in the derke togyder


Thrugh myshap the one myght fle the other


And therfore by myne assente


Let vs swere on our swerdes bothe


Where that we mete for lefe or lothe


If that we mete in presente


And neuer leue the batayle tyll the one be slayne


I assent me therto than sayd Gawayne


And ye wyll that it so be


Thus sayd syr Brandles I maye none other do


For suche promyse I made my fader vnto


Therfore this othe make we


I wote that there is no stroke y
t

But I haue quyt it sykerly


And thou arte not in my det


Full large of lyuerye thou arte syr knyght


Neuer none dyde preue so well my myght


We ben euen as we met


Let vs make an othe on our swerdes here


In what place we mete ferre or nere


Euen there as eyther other may fynde


Euen so we shall do the batayle vtterly


I holde sayd Gawayne by mylde mary


And thus we make an ende


S
r Gamayne take 
 his swerde than




Whan he all sawe he sayd alas


This is euyll tydyngr


Whan he sawe his fader all blody


And his .ii. bretherne hurte full sykerly


Alas sayd Brandles than


Who hath done you suche a dyspyte


Tell me in hast that I may hym quyte


For myne herte is wo begone


Then sayd the fader sone I shall the tell


All this hathe done a knyght full fell


And layne by thy syster also


He bet me fyrste and sythe them all


And made vs swere that we ne shall


This day do hym no wo


Now quod Brandles this is ylle come


I ensure you by my holy dome


I shall proue his myght


Were he as stronge as Sampson was


In faty he shall I neuer frome hympas


Tyll the one of vs to dethe be dyght


Ye loue Brendles thou shalte not so


Though he haue done wronge let hymg


The knyght is passynge sure


I wyll not for more than I wyll sayne


Se the syr Brandles there slayne


For I warrante the he wyll endure


The knyght is stronge and well fyght


And whan he hath in his hande a man


He wyll do hym no yl


But 
entyll wordes speke agayne




And eche of them helped other


As well as they myght go


Than the lady gate her awaye


They sawe her neuer after that daye


She wente wandrynge to and fro


Also syr Gawayne in his party


On fote he wente full weryly


Tyll he to the courte came home


All his aduenture he shewed the kynge


That with those .iiii. knyghtes he had fyghtyng


And eche after other alone


After that tyme they neuer met more


Full glad were these partyes therfore


So was there made the ende


I praye god gyue vs all good reste


And those that haue harde this lytell geste


And in hye heuen for to be dwellynge


And that we all vpon domes daye


Come to the blysse that lasteth a ye


Where we maye here the aungelles synge

Of knyghthode thou haste no felowe


On my faythe I ensure the


Nowe quod Gawayne let hym be


And syr knyght make one othe to me


That this daye thou do me no greue


And thou shalte passe from me all quyte


Where as is nowe thy moost delyte


Without ony more reprefe


Syr Terry sayd therto I graunte


Fare well nowe god be thy warraunte


Full mekely he wente on fote


He lefte neuer tyll he came there


Where his fader and syr Gyamoure were


That carefull hertes had god wote


Than spake syr Gyamoure his yongest bro


Syr thou hast goten as we haue and none


That knewe I well it sholde so be


By god sayd syr Terry so nowe it is


He is a deuyll forsothe Iwys


And that is preued on me


Ye quod syr Gylberde that erle olde


He is a knyght bothe stronge and bolde


And fortune is his frende

Therfore I dare well saye he is a man


And mykell worse than I wende
