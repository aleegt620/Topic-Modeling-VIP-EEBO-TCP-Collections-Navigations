A REPLY TO AN ANSWER FROM A FRIEND, TO THE APOLOGY FOR THE English Nation, That the TRADE TO THE 
East-Indies and Africa
 Should be FREE.


LONDON,
 Printed, in the Year, 1692.














A Reply to an Answer from a Friend, to the Apology for the English Nation; that the Trade to the 
East-Indies
 and 
Africa
 should be free.


SIR,


WHen I desired your Opinion of the Apology for the English Nation, 
&c.
 I expected you would have first answered where I began; 
viz.
 That all Nations, as well as the Inhabitants of Nations, by Equal Right or the Law of Nature, may entertain Trade and Commerce with one a∣nother: and if in Times of Peace Humane Laws shall debar Subjects of this Right, this is practising Iniquity by a Law: And that you would have Objected against the Reasons, which the Parliament gave 3 
Jac. C.
 6. for the freedom of the English in the Spanish Trade; or that these Reasons did not hold in the 
East-India
 Trade, but of these you say not one word▪


You say when you were in
 London, 
all Men Agreed the
 East-India 
Trade could not be driven, without a Company, because of the Power of the
 Dutch 
in those Seas.


I suppose you mistake me in contending against a Company Exclu∣sive to all others▪ for it is not a Company I contend against; but the Exclusion of all others: For your seeming Reason of the 
Dutch
 power in the 
East-Indies,
 to necessitate a Trade by the 
English
 in a Company, it will not hold; unless you can make an 
English
 Company to be equal to the 
Dutch
 in power, which can never be hoped for; but if it could▪ it could never be by Excluding others, which might contribute to the Encrease of it.


For the Instance you give of the 
Turkey
 Trade; it hath no resem∣blance to the Trade in the 
East-Indies:
 For our Trade to 
Turkey,
 is up∣on the Matter, but to one place, 
viz. Smyrna;
 whereas that which the Company call the 
East-India
 Trade, is to all the Parts on the East of 
Africa,
 and the Southern Parts of 
Asia,
 to the North of 
China,
 with all

 the Islands which lye in that vast Ocean; so that for ought is known Tenfold the Trade might be managed by the 
English
 there, if the Trade were free, than to 
Turky;
 which is impossible to be done by one Com∣pany exclusive to all others; in the numerous and vast Dominions in those parts of the World.


Besides the Objection which you make of the 
Dutch
 power in those Seas, to exclude all others but a Company is a Topick set up only by the Favourers of the 
East-India
 Company; for unless you suppose the 
Dutch
 power to he more than that of all the Princes of 
Africk, Asia,
 and all the Islands in the vast Ocean, these cannot give Laws to them, all; and this is an Argument which the Company, themselves do not be∣lieve, for if granted, Interlopers could never Trade to the 
East-Indies,
 which is the greatest fear the Company have.


But suppose all the Princes in 
Africk
 and 
Asia
 could not protect the 
English
 in their Trade with them; yet sure a King of 
England
 is not so faln from power, but that he is able to protect his Subjects in all their Just Trades from the Violences and Oppressions of the 
Dutch.


You say the Commons had reason to refer the Business of the Erecting a new
 East-India 
Company to the King, they having so little time to Sit.


The Commons had busied themselves above four Months in Esta∣blishing this Company, more than in any thing else, and then threw it upon the King, who in the Circumstances he is in, cannot attend it four days.


But you say you doubt not but the Commons upon their next Sitting, will assume this Business again, and then will undoubtedly Blow up the present Com∣pany.
 But this will be more strange than to Vote an 
East-India
 Com∣pany exclusive to all others, to be Established by Act of Parliament; and then to throw it upon the King; and after to take it out of the power of the King.


But here you may see how Industriously Men pursue their Interest, without any regard to Justice or Prudence: For all this time in propa∣gating an 
East India
 Company exclusive to other Men, no regard is had how the 
English
 might be secured from the Violences and Injuries of the 
Dutch
 in it; nor how it can be carried on by the 
English
 in the miserable and distracted state, the now Company have brought it to, with the 
Mogull, Sophy
 of 
Persia,
 and King of 
Syam.


The 
Dutch
 power in the 
East-Indies
 is vastly more than the 
English,
 yet to maintain this, they are at as vast Charges in maintaining it, so that where the 
English
 and 
Dutch
 Trade, with all the other Princes of the 
Indies, Persia,
 or 
China,
 the 
English
 Trade is so much cheaper, as they are at less Charges in maintaining their Dominions, nor can it be ever hoped the 
English,
 with or without a Company can expel the 
Dutch
 out of their Dominions in the 
East-Indies.




It's true, the 
Dutch
 have been as Injurious to this present Company (if Injuries can be done to such a Company of Men) as the Company has been to the rest of the 
English
 Nation: For besides the Business of 
Amboyna;
 which was not in this Companies time; they Outed the Com∣pany from 
Polloroon,
 where the Natives could not protect them, and was a principal cause of the second 
Dutch
 War in King 
Charles
 the Se∣cond's Reign: And by falshood kept the Company from Trading to 
China
 and 
Japan,
 alledging the 
English
 were Christians; and the King had Married the King of 
Portugal
's Daughter: (the 
Portuguez
 of all Na∣tions being most detestible to the 
Chiness;
) and now by joining with the young King of 
Bantam
 against his Father; they keep the King Pri∣soner, and make use of his Name, to expel the 
English
 from their Trade to 
Bantam
 for Pepper, so as the 
English
 are forced to Trade to the West of 
Sumatra
 for Pepper, a most unhealthful place, where more 
English
 lose their Lives, than ten times the Trade is worth, of which the Company have no regard, so as they could purchase a Pound of Pepper by the loss of ten 
English
 Men: The unhealthiness of this place being represented to Queen 
Elizabeth,
 she forbid her Subjects Trading to 
Sumatra.


In the second 
Dutch
 War, the 
French
 joyned with King 
Charles
 against the 
Dutch;
 and thereby the 
Dutch
 were reduced so low, as they were in the War with the Rump Parliament; but the Parliament dreading the Consequences, Petitioned the King to make a separate Peace with the 
Dutch,
 without including the 
French;
 but this prevailed but little, till the 
Spanish
 Ambassador, the Marquess 
Del Fresno
 interposed, threat∣ning other ways, 
Spain
 would break with 
England,
 and then the King made a separate hasty Peace with the 
Dutch,
 whereby a Regulation of Trade was agreed to be settled, and adjusted in the 
East-Indies,
 by certain Commissioners on both sides.


Persuant hereto, the 9th. of 
Feb.
 1673. six Commissioners named by the King, entred into a Treaty, with Six sent by the 
Dutch,
 at 
London,
 who were to settle the Regulations and adjust the Trade to the 
East-Indies
 in three Months time; and what was not settled in that time, was to be referred to the Queen Regent of 
Spain,
 who was to Name Eleven Commissioners, the Major part whereof was to deter∣mine what was not settled; provided they gave their Judgment with∣in Six Months to be computed from the time they met; which was to be within three Months after the Queen had taken this Award upon her. But tho' these Commissioners set more than three times the time limitted for Adjusting the 
East-India
 Trade; 
viz.
 till the first of 
Dec.
 1674. yet they concluded nothing in it, nor was ever any further Refe∣rence to the Queen Regent of 
Spain.




Thus this Prince 
Charles
 the Second having joined with the 
French
 in a War against the 
Dutch,
 to the Disturbance of the peace of 
Christen∣dom,
 because of the 
Dutch
 Oppressions and Wrongs done the 
English
 in their Trades in the 
East Indies.
 Now to get 800000 Pa
a
oons of the 
Dutch,
 and a round Sum of Money from the Parliament, makes a se∣parate Peace with the 
Dutch,
 and leaves the 
English
 in their Trades to the 
East-Indies
 in the same state it was before: And sure the cosiderati∣on hereof had been more worthy the wisdom of the Commons, than their Debates Four Months together to Establish an 
East-India
 Company exclusive to all others.


Nor can I imagine how this Intended Exclusive Company by the Commons, or any of the 
English
 Nation, can Trade to the 
Mogul
's or King of 
Syam
's Dominions, before the Differences made by this Companies War with them be Adjusted; you cannot believe we have a true Representation of them from the Company; nor do I be∣lieve the Company themselves understand them: And do you think the 
Mogull
 or King of 
Syam,
 will sit down by the Loss? Or that it is rea∣sonable, the Kings other Subjects, which the Company have denied the Benefit of the Trade to the 
East Indies,
 should be liable to pay their Debts there; and make Restitution for all the Violences and Deprada∣tions the Company have committed.


But admit the Company be in a condition to pay the Expence of this War, and their Debts contracted in it, which Mr. 
White
 computes to be Seventeen Hundred Thousand Pounds; its probable the Company ha∣ving spent all the Money there, must return it thither out of 
England;
 and I think at this time the Nation is not in a condition to part with such a Sum; and s
 when these things had been Adjusted, it had been time enough to have debated, whether the 
East India
 Trade might been better carried on by a Company exclusive to all others, or that it should be free.


So I leave it to you to judge, whether it be not more to be wished, that the King will please to Adjust and Regulate thee Trade of the 
East-Indies;
 especially concerning the Trades to 
Amboyna, Poll
o
n
 and 
Ban∣tam;
 and send Ambassadors to the 
Mogull
 and King of 
Syam,
 to vin∣dicate the rest of the 
English
 Nation from the Violences and Rapines which the Company have committed upon their Subjects; and to inspect the state of Affairs in the 
East-Indies,
 as they now stand; and to enter into a Treaty of Commerce with the 
Sophy
 of 
Persia, Mogull,
 the Empe∣ror of 
China,
 and other Princes of the 
East-Indies,
 with whom the 
En∣glish
 shall Trade; before he Erect any Company to Trade to all these Princes, and be thereby Liable to the Violences of the 
Dutch,
 and to make satisfaction for all the Debts and Depradations of the n
w Company.




I agree with you that the Company have no Right to the Half Cu∣stoms of Goods vended in the Gulph of 
Persia;
 nor that they ever paid any thing for them, yet more than double the worth of all the Joint∣stock the Company imployed in this Trade to the 
East-Indies:
 And that these Customs ought to be imployed in Building Forts in proper places for securing the 
English
 Traffick in those Seas: And that when these Moneys are not so Imployed, they are due to the King.


We agree too, that the 
African
 Company is Injurious to the Nation in the Vent of our Native Commodities; and in our Trades to the Plan∣tations; nor is this Company less injurious to the Nation in their re∣turns: For a Worker in Ivory assured me within three days, that the Company has raised the prizes of Elephants Teeth, threefold more than when the Trade was free; and what is this but to impose a dear∣ness upon all Ivory Manufactures at Home, and to Establish the For∣reign Vent of them to the 
Dutch, French,
 and other Nations to our Loss, and undoing of Thousands of people, who other ways might be em∣ployed in them. 
Ex ungue Leonem;
 by this you may judge of the rest?


FINIS.
