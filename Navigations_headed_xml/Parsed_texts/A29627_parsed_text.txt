TO THE
READER.


Courteous Reader,


IT were a needless Un∣dertaking
to offer any
Apology for the ensuing
Treatise, its own intrinsick
Value being sufficient to raise
it both above the reach of
all aspersing Cavillers, and at
the same time to recommend
it to every judicious 
Per∣user;

but yet it will not be
impertinent to give some few

Hints,
 wherein both its



Usefulness
 and 
Excellency

doth consist.


Its Bulk is but small, yet
the Matter contain'd large
and extensive, as compre∣hending
concisely, but yet ve∣ry
conspicuously, an Account
of the most 
Remarkable Pla∣ces

in this our 
Native
 Coun∣try,
intermixt with many o∣ther
very useful and divert∣ing

Occurrences:
 There are
indeed voluminous Treatises
of this Nature already ex∣tant,
which claim a just
Praise in their kind, and
some of a smaller Size, that


have their 
Usefulness
 also;
but none, in my Judgment,
so well handled, so compleat,
and truly recommendable as
this; for what they in lar∣ger
Volumes have done, you
have here contracted into a
small compass, but yet so, as
that there is nothing Mate∣rial,
or worthy to be known,
omitted, and what the les∣ser
Tracts have passed over,
is here fully inserted. Our

Author
 hath spared no pains
to oblige thee, 
(kind Rea∣der)

having spent 
Three
whole Years
 of his Life in
this his 
Peregrination,
 now


exposed to thy view: To say
nothing of his 
Person
 and

Character,
 his 
Language
 is
Elegant and Pithy, his 
De∣scriptions

lively and airy,
his 
Historical Relations
 per∣tinent
and seasonable, and
such a pleasing 
Variety,
 and
engaging 
Divertisement

throughout the whole Series
of the 
Story,
 as can do no less
than excite in thee a kind
of a 
Longing-wish
 that
thou hadst been present with
him, and actually pertici∣pated
of the same.



But what signifies what
we have now premised, if

Truth
 be not the Standard
of all, and in this regard we
must not pretermit in 
Si∣lence,

what so eminently di∣stinguishes
our Ingenious 
Au∣thor

from most, if not all, that
have gone before him upon
this 
Subject,
 in that he pre∣sents
you here with nothing
but his own 
Ocular Obser∣vations,

whereas others, con∣fining
themselves to their
Studies, have obtruded up∣on
the World what they
have taken upon the bare

Credit
 of those, who were,


perhaps, more slothful than
themselves.


In fine, 
Gentle Reader,

Peruse, and Judge mature∣ly,
and when thou hast so
done, I make no doubt of thy
Approbation, and plenary
Satisfaction, which will not
be a little grateful to


Thy Compatriot

An ACCOUNT
OF
M
r.
 
R. Rogers
's
Three Years Travels
OVER

England
 and 
Wales.




FROM 
London,
 the Epitome of 
Eng∣land

it self, we took our Journy
thro' 
Middlesex,
 a County famous
for its goodly Edifices, as well
wisely Compacted together upon
the Banks of 
Thames;
 as likewise for divers
stately Palaces dispersed in several Parts there∣of.
The first Town of Note we came to was

Colebrook,
 which takes its Name from the Ri∣ver

Cole;
 a Town of great Antiquity, and of
a considerable length, and well stored with
Inns: We stayed here a small time, and so set
forward to 
Maidenhead.




MAIDENHEAD
 is Eight Miles distance
from 
Colebrook,
 and so we came into the Con∣fines
of 
Barkshire.
 It is a County of near e∣qual
Length and Breadth; it was thus De∣nominated
from the Superstitious Ado∣ration
that was given to the 
Brittish
 Maid,
being one of the Eleven Thousand, which
by the Conduct of St. 
Ursla,
 returning home
from 
Rome
 were all Martyr'd at 
Cologne
 in

Germany
 by the Tyrant 
Attila,
 that most cruel
Scourge to the 
Christians.
 'Tis of no long
Date or standing; and it is certain, as I was
credibly informed, That 
Julius Caesar
 making
an Inrode into this County did pass over the
River not far from this Place, and by the
voluntary Submission of these People here,
did soon compleat his Conquest amongst
them.




Windsor.


In this County is 
Windsor.
 This Place
was given away by 
Edward the Confessor
 from
the Crown to the Church of 
Westminster;

but 
William the Conqueror
 taking a very great
Affection to it by reason of its pleasant Situ∣ation,
made an Exchange with the Abbot
of 
Westminster
 for some other Lands in the
room of this, and so it returned to the
Crown again. The Palace in which the
King resides when he comes down hither,
is inferior to none for Sight and Pleasure
throughout all His Majesty's Dominions. In


the front of it lies a pleasant Valley, chec∣quered
with the various colors of Green and
Red Verdant Meadows, and fertile Tillage,
melodious Woods, and the murmuring of
the Noble River 
Thames.
 Behind it is a
pleasant Prospect of a delightful Forrest, de∣signed
on purpose by Nature for Sport and
Recreation, whilst she so liberally stocks it
with numerous Herds of Deer, lurking a∣mongst
the shady. Thickets; and our Kings
and Nobles did very usually resort hither from
the City of 
London,
 it being so fine a Place of
pleasure and delight. K. 
Edward
 the Third
being born at this Town, did much aug∣ment
and strengthen the Castle there upon
the Hill, which 
Henry
 the First had before
erected, fortifying the same with strong
Walls and Trenches, which are now to be
seen. After K. 
Edward
 the Third had sub∣dued
both the 
French
 and 
Scots,
 and took
their Kings Captive, he Committed 
John,

King of 
France,
 and 
David,
 King of the 
Scots,

for some time Prisoners to this Castle, which
is divided into two Partitions; in the first,
which looks towards the East, is the King's
Palace, splendid and glorious; in the other,
which is the outward Partition, stands a state∣ly
Church, Dedicated by 
Edward
 the Third
to the Virgin 
Mary
 and St. 
George,
 but beau∣tified
and illustrated with most rare and cu∣rious
Work; K. 
Edward
 the Fourth lies en∣terred


therein: But that which makes it still
more Holy and Venerable is, the Body of
our Sacred Martyr K. 
Charles
 the First, tha

Royal Saint of ever Blessed Memory. From
hence we w
nt to 
Reading.


READING
 in this County is a Town of
very good Note, and not inferior to any in
all that County. It is situated, as it were,
on the side of a little Hill, with a small ascent
towards the Market-place. It is very well
watered by a good River which runs along
the one side of it, and hath the Noble River
of 
Thames,
 which comes within a little di∣stance,
on the other side. It hath a Mayor
for its chief Magistrate, and it is famous
for a very great Market once a Week for all
Sorts of Grain. We stayed here but one
Night, having a design to take a farther view
of this County by 
Wallingford,
 and so to


ABBINGTON,
 This is a fair Town in
this County; the River 
Isis
 after it hath win∣ded
it self a long way about in a crooked
Channel, makes its approach to this Town.
It is a large and populous Place, and re∣ceives
its Denomination from a famous Ab∣by
which was here erected, although this
Monastery did, for some Years, flourish ex∣ceedingly,
yet it was afterwards Subverted
by the fury of the 
Danes;
 but through the


Bounties and Munificence of King 
Edgar▪

was restored again to its Primitive Splendor
and Greatness, and by the Industry and Care
of the 
Norman
 Abbots, it grew to that pitch
of Grandeur, and so exceeding Rich and
Wealthy, that it began to have an Esteem
of it self beyond all Comparison, and indeed
the Ruins too be-speak it to have been a ve∣ry
glorious Structure: As for the Town,
though it had its chief Dependance from
this Abby, yet from the Year 1430, that one

John,
 Surnamed St. 
Helena,
 built a strong
Bridge of Stone over its River, and so made
a Through-fair and High Road through the
Town, it began to be populous, and much
frequented, and ever since hath been most
deservedly reputed the eminent, principle
Town in this County. The Inhabitants are
great Maulsters, and Barly is the great Com∣modity
of the Market. The Magistrates, by
their Vigilancy and Care, do keep up this
Corporation in great Honour and Request,
and the Mayor and Aldermen are very Cir∣cumspect
in the discharge of their Offices;
and for the more great and weighty Matters
which are above their Sphere, the Judges,
when they come their Circuit, and keep
the Assizes here for the County, do ease
them of that trouble, by giving a final De∣termination
of all.




FARRINGDON
 was the next Town of
Note we went to in this County, which
though it be situated upon a stony Soil, yet
'tis now as famous for its great Market, as
it was once Renowned for its Impregnable
Fortress, which 
Robert,
 Earl of 
Gloucester,
 built
here against King 
Stephen,
 which the King
though with the loss of a great number of
Soldiers, at last by his continual Assaults and
Batteries took and utterly demolished.


But one thing is to be observed in this
County; That it is very pleasant and fertile,
watered with the River 
Isis,
 adorned with
woody Hills and thick Groves, and in its
Eastern parts thereof with fertile Valleys,
and in the Western part, being called 
The
Vale of White Horse,
 is extreamly delightful,
and Nature compensates the Barrenness of
the Soil in one place, by her manifold
Gifts she bestows upon it in another.


NEWBURY
 was the next place we went to.
'Tis a Town of very good Note, and of a
considerable largeness, governed by a Mayor
and Aldermen, and hath a very commodious
Market-house, which is not much inferior
to any in the County. The Town is situa∣ted
in a pleasant Valley, and watered by a
very good River, called 
Newbury River,
 which
runs through one part of the Town near the
Market-house; and in the other part of it is a


very find Rivelet, which runs from one end of
the Town to the other, and is mighty ne∣cessary
for all the Inhabitants. We made no
long stay here, but went to 
Marlborough
 in

Wiltshire,
 of which hereafter.






Wiltshire.


MARLBOROUGH
 is a Town of an
indifferent largeness, and is Ruled by a Ma∣yor
and Aldermen. The Buildings of this
Town, and the Market-place, are not much
inferior to any Town in 
England;
 but that
which is most remarkable, and to be admi∣red
at is, a Mount belonging to the Duke
of 
Summerset,
 the like is not in 
England.
 The
Mount it self is made round, with a Quick∣set
Hedge which is all entire, and goes seve∣ral
times round about, the Mount rising with
a very small Ascent till it comes up to the
top; within this Hedge is a very plain Path,
or Walk, and the ground seems to be so
even, that you cannot well perceive the rise
of it till you are at the top, which is of a
very great height, and of a large circumfe∣rence,
but yet as you go down you may ea∣sily
perceive the ground fall much. The
Gardner there told us, That it is a Mile from
the bottom up to the top, and go the Path-way
which leads up to it. On the top of the
Mount, is a very fine level piece of Ground,
planted with several sorts of Fruit-Trees;


there stands likewise on the top, a very large
leaden Cestern, of about 12 foot square, and
4 foot deep, and is replenished with Water
by a leaden Pipe, which comes from a Spring
along the Path that leads up to the top. On
the one side of this Mount is a very commo∣dious
Wilderness, and on the other a fine
Garden; in a word, this Mount is the most
to be admired, and must have the Respect
of all Travellers, to be the greatest piece of
Artificial Workmanship in our own Nati∣on.
We stayed here but one Night, and
went to take a farther View of this County,
in which there are many things very observ∣able.
About two Miles out of this Town is
a great Down, called 
Marlborough Downs,

where there is an exceeding Curiosity of
Nature's workmanship, it is a huge number
of Massy Stones, they are called by the Name
of 
The Grey Wethers,
 and shew to your sight,
at a distance, like a great number of Sheep,
and some of them higher; but for the great
number of them, and containing such a vast
distance of Land, to be all in one and the
like posture. It is a large Plain, or Valley,
between two Hills where they stand, and is
in breadth almost a Mile, and about six Miles
in length, as we were informed, undoubted∣ly
it hath as much need to be mentioned, as
any thing in the Kingdom. Having made
some Observations here, we went to take


some account of 
Stonehenge
 in this County,
of which I shall give you a short Relation.


STONEHENGE.
 This place contains
in it, within the circumference of three Hun∣dred
foot, a rude and indigested Mass of vast
large Stones, rough, and of a grey colour,
25 Foot in length, 10 in breadth, and 8 in
thickness; they look as if they were hewen
square, and are joined two and two toge∣ther,
and every couple hath a third Stone
lying a-cross, which is fastened by Tennants
that enter into Mortesses, not closed with a∣ny
Morter. It appears as if they had been set
in three Ranks going round, as Circles, one
within another, whereof the uttermost and
largest is in compass about 300 Foot, but the
other Ranks are decayed, and some of them
being faln down to the ground, 'tis very dif∣ficult
to reckon how many there are; like∣wise
it seems very strange, how such im∣mense
Bulks should happen here, where there
is no Stones of any small demension within
the Neighbourhood: Whereupon some are
of an Opinion, That they are not purely na∣tural,
or had their growth in this place.
'Tis now generally credited and believed,
that they were a Monument set up by 
Au∣relius
Ambrose,
 in Remembrance of the 
Brit∣tains

that were Slain and Buried there, in the
Reign of 
Vortiger,
 at a Banquet and Com∣munication
of 
Hengist,
 which the 
Saxons
 and



Brittish
 Chronicles testifie, 
That whereas the

Saxons 
about the Year of our Lord
 450. 
had slain
Four hundred and eighty of the
 Brittish 
Nobili∣ty
by Treachery, under a Colour of a Parley and
Treaty; this
 Aurelius Ambrose 
being then King
of the
 Brittains, 
desirous to continue their Memo∣ry,
as well as the Infamy of his base and treache∣rous
Enemies, caused these Stones to be set up in
the very place of their Death and Burial, the
which Stones had been first brought out of
 Africk

into
 Ireland, 
and there placed on Mount
 Killare,

and from thence, by the Art and Magick of
 Mer∣lina,

a renowned Magician in that Age, were at
length conveyed to this place upon this very Occa∣sion.

Others think, that the 
Brittains
 did E∣rect
this, as a Monument for 
Ambrosius
 him∣self,
to perpetuate his glorious Name to Po∣sterity,
who died afterwards upon this place
by the Sword, in the Answer of their Quar∣rel,
and Vindication of their Liberties; how∣ever
certain it is, that there are thereabouts
certain little Hills, or Banks, under which
there are sometimes found Bones of tall, gi∣gantick
Men, and pieces of Armour; and
not far from hence, remains still some of the
Ruins of an old kind of Fortress, which the

Romans,
 as it is probable, did raise for them∣selves,
during their Possession of these our
Territories, 
&c.


From hence we went to 
Wilton-House,
 be∣longing
to the Earl of 
Pembrook.
 It is situa∣ted


in a pleasant Valley, and hath the Town
of 
Wilton
 on the one side of it, and a spacious
Park on the other side, with delightful Gar∣dens
and Meadows on the other sides, and
a fine River running through the Gardens.
In this House are excellent Rooms, and great
variety of Pictures, and in the Gardens are
undoubtedly the most curious Water-works
that are in all 
England.
 We did not tar∣ry
long here, but went away to 
Salisbury,

of which I shall inform you as briefly as I
can.


Leaving 
Wilton-House
 we rode to 
Salisbury,

and in our way beheld the place where for∣merly
old 
Wilton,
 the Metropolis of this
County, stood, called 
Willey.
 'Tis situated,
saith 
Cambden,
 where the two Rivers 
Willey∣brook

and 
Alderbourne
 meet; and here it was
that 
Egbert,
 King of the 
West Saxons,
 in the
Year of our Lord 821, fought the second
Battle against the 
Mercians,
 so bloody on both
sides, that the River 
Avon
 was all over dyed red
with the Blood of the slain; and in the Year
871, 
Alfred
 having maintained a long Fight
against the 
Danes,
 and upon the first Onset
had success, but was at last quite routed, his
Forces defeated, and himself forced to flee
away to preserve his life. In the 
Saxons
 reign
it flourished mightily, and 
Edgar
 built there
a Nunnery, and made his Daughter 
Editha

Lady Governess thereof; afterwards being


long exposed to the fury of the 
Danes,
 who
were its Mortal Enemies, and deserted the
Bishops of 
Salisbury,
 who were at first its Sup∣porters,
it went to decay, and almost return∣ed
again on a sudden into its first Principle
of Nothing; and so old 
Salisbury
 then, and
since new 
Salisbury
 which hath sprang from
that, have quite extinguished its Primitive
Lustre and Glory. Old 
Salisbury
 was situated
upon a Hill, exposed much to Winds and
Storms, very dry, barren and uncomfortable▪
by reason of the great Defect of Water
throughout the whole City; it was well for∣tified,
as appears by some ancient pieces o

Walls which are there still to be seen. The

Saxons,
 in the Year 553, first Sacked it, and
took it, and in the Reign of 
Edward
 the Se∣cond,

Osmund,
 Bishop of 
Sherbourne,
 Transla∣ted
the See hither, and built a Cathedral
Church, though the 
Danes
 not long after, ha∣ving
took and burnt the City, that likewise
underwent the same fatal Calamity, and was
levelled with the ground, till both of them
were raised again in 
William the Conqueror
's
time; for after that he had made his Pro∣gress
throughout all his Kingdom of 
England,

he at last Summoned all the Three Orders of
the Nation to come hither, and here to take
their Oaths of Allegiance to him: But after∣wards
in the Reign of 
Richard
 the First, the
Citizens being oppressed by the Insolence of


the Soldiers, which then kept Garrison, and
was in great want for Water, resolved to free
themselves from these Burdens, by Trans∣planting
themselves into another Soil, which
they unanimously agreed upon, and seated
themselves about a Mile from this place in a
more pleasant Valley, where the flowry
Meads, and Chrystial-stream'd Rivers, gave
them a more hearty Welcome, and far bet∣ter
Entertainment than before they were ac∣quainted
withal. After a new Colony was
Transplanted hither, 
Richard Pore,
 first Bishop
of 
Chichester,
 then of 
Salisbury,
 afterwards of

Durham,
 did likewise Transplant the Cathe∣dral
from the barren, dry place in which it
was erected near to the old Castle of the
Earls of 
Salisbury,
 and built it in a more
plentiful Soil; this most pious Prelate, for he
did not only Transplant it, but (by the Ad∣vice
and Contrivance of the most excellent
and ingenious Artificers, not only Natives,
but Foreigners, whom he drew hither by his
large Rewards) he raised it to that Splender
and Magnificence, that now it matches with the
staliest of Structures, for the rare Workmanship
thereof throughout the Nation. The Steeple
is built in the form of a Pyramid very high,
and as the Pole Star directs the Pilot at Sea,
so doth this Spire direct the wandring Tra∣veller
over the Plain, discovering its lofty
head at the distance of 20 Miles, as we were


credibly inform'd; but the admirableness of
the Structure consists in this, That it hath as
many Pillars as there are Hours in the Year,
and these not close but you may see the En∣tertices
betwixt them, and shake those that
are of the lesser size, and there is as many
Windows as there are Days in the Year, and
these very artificially Adorned, and curiously
Painted to admiration; and there is likewise
as many Doors as there is Weeks in the Year,
and as many Chappels as Months. Thus did
this great Prelate, which by augmenting it,
augment his own Fame, and even Cannoniz
himself: And as the Church was then re-e∣dified,
so was the City much enlarged too
by the Citizens, and for the more sweetness,
as well as cleanliness of their Habitations,
they made several Channels and Rivolets in
the midst of their Streets very commodious
and beneficial to them. Thus, by degrees,
Old 
Salisbury
 is vanished away, and very lit∣tle
to be seen in it, but the Ruins and old
Walls of the Earl's Castle, and one small
Dwelling-house, and New 
Salisbury
 is be∣come
glorious and aimable, resorted to, and
frequented and admired by Persons of all
Qualities and Degrees; for its Houses are
stately, its Churches magnificent, its Streets
clean, its Rivers pleasant and well stored with
Fish, its Gardens delightful and very fragrant,
and nothing wanting in it to please either


the Eye or the Pallate; it is governed by a
Mayor and Aldermen. Thus have I given
you a brief Account of 
Wiltshire,
 I could have
wrote much more, for there are many other
things very observable in this County, espe∣cially
for Travellers to take notice of, which
is too tedious here to relate.






Summersetshire.


The first Place of Note we came to in this
County was 
Wells,
 the chief City of the
Shire, and receives its Denomination from the
variety of fresh and wholsome Springs which
bubble up about it in great abundance. The
Houses therein are well contrived, and built of
Stone, the Government safe and regular, but
the chief Ornament hereof is the Cathedral,
built by King 
Ina
 in honour to St. 
Andrew;

the Church hath been enriched with large
Revenues by religious Benefactors; it was
made a Bishop's See in the Reign of King 
Ed∣ward

the Second, and 
Eadulphus
 was Consti∣tuted
the first Bishop here in the Reign of

William Rufus,
 and in the Year 1092, 
John,
 a

Turon
 born, being elected Bishop, united that
of 
Bath
 with this; and hence it comes to
pass, that he that is Bishop of this See, is cal∣led
Bishop of 
Bath
 and 
Wells.
 This Church
underwent the same Calamities that other re∣ligious
Places did in this Kingdom, and took


away the Revenues annexed to it; 'tis a
magnificent Structure, and the Quire of it
yeilds to none for stateliness; if we consider
the artificial Bosses very delicately gilded
which adorn it above, or the curious Co∣lumns
which uphold it below, or the Bishop's
Seat of Marble, set out with most glorious
Embellishments, supported with rich Pillars,
and with its towring Piramids, being the
Head and Ornament in a more especial man∣ner
of the Quire, as he is of the Church; to
this I may add the variety of carved Images,
which almost environ the Church on the
out side, containing the History of the Old
Testament, and the curious Architecture of
the Chapter-house, supported only by one
large Column which stands in the middle of
it. Near unto the Church is the Bishop's Pa∣lace
of great Grandeur, which becomes a
Reverend Father of the Church to be seated ed
in. But the remarkablest, and which can∣not
but have the respect of all Travellers to
be the most admirable piece of Nature's
Workmanship in our Kingdom, is a Place
called 
Ochy-hole,
 two Miles from this City:
'Tis a Cave under a very high Rock, situa∣ted
amongst the 
Mendippe-hills,
 of which I
shall endeavour to give a Description as
briefly as I can.




OCHY-HOLE.
 After that we had, with
some difficulty, climbed up to the top of a
Rock, we went along the Brow of a Hill till
we came to the Mouth of the Cave, where
opening a Door that gave entrance, and ligh∣ting
24 Candles of 6 in the Pound, which we
provided for that purpose, we ventured in;
being got within it, we found the Cave very
hollow, and so dark, that the Candles there
scarce burning so bright, though there were
24, as two doth ordinary in the Night in
one of our largest Rooms; we thought cer∣tainly
we had been come into the Confines
of the Infernal Regions, or some such dis∣mal
Place, and began to be affraid to visit it,

viz. That although we entered in frolicksome
and merry, yet we might return out of it Sad
and Pensive, and never more be seen to Laugh
whilst we lived in the World;
 such dreadful
Apprehensions seized upon some of us; and
indeed we had cause to fear some such O∣perations
might have proceeded from this,
as well as the other, since both were e∣qually
uncomfortable, by reason of our de∣privation
from the least glimmerings of light,
and consequently had the same Circumstan∣ces
to beget both Horror and Amazement:
however we plucked up our Spirits, and crept
in one after another as fast as we could conve∣niently:
The Cave as we went a long was
parted into several kinds of Rooms, the










Names whereof our Guides informed us:
The first was the Kitchin, and at the Door
sticks out a large Mass of the Rock, which,
they tell us, was the Porter's head, formerly
the Keeper of this Cave; it bears the resem∣blance
of a Head, and by that lies a Stone
which they call 
The Tombstone,
 under which,
the Report is, That his Body lies Enter∣red,
and his Dogherd by him in the same
substance; yet their Transformations are not
so strange and wonderful, being something
too fabulous to be given Credit to, as the va∣riety
which the Rock affords into which they
are incorporated, part of it glistering like
Silver, and part like Diamonds, and both ap∣pear
very pleasant to the Eye: A little fur∣ther
on the right hand is another piece of the
Rock that bears the resemblance of a Bell, and
on the left hand a Vessel, which they term
a But, in which the Beer of an old Sorceress,
(Cousin to the famous 
Circe,
 Lady Governess
of this dismal Cave,) used to be work'd in;
'tis a hollow Cestern of a considerable depth
always filled with Water, and now and then
flowing over, to which the drops of Water
which continually trickle down from the
top of the Rock add every moment fresh
supplies; hard by this stands another Vessel
of hers, in which, they say, she made her
Mault, they call it the 
East Hurdle,
 'tis like∣wise
hollow, and of a pretty depth. Now


appears unto your view the old Witch her
self, heating of her Furnace which seems
black and sooty; it seems to be Alablaster,
by reason of its whiteness, though 'tis most
probable to be the product of Nature, and
not of Art, because the place is very unfit
and very unsuitable for any Artist to exer∣cise
his Skill in, it being very oft so low,
that it is impossible here and there for any
one to stand upright in it; and therefore it
was that we were forced frequently to stoop,
and buckle almost double for fear of hiting
our Heads against the Rock, until we came
to some Steps which we were to descend,
and the Defect thereto was very tedious and
affrightful, for on the right hand the Rock
hung down over us extream low and sloping,
and on the left hand a great Rivolet which
runs along through the Cave, being pretty
deep, and making a loud noise in its gliding,
yet at length we came sweating into ano∣ther
Room which is called 
The Hall,
 and
here, at first sight, we were entertained with
as great a Rarity as 
Nature
 hath in all her
Store-houses, 'tis a Cestern almost square,
about six Foot each way, and of a considera∣ble
depth, always brimful of Water, supplied
by the Drops which falls from above; but
that which is to be admired in it is this, tho'
the Water be constantly droping, and is con∣tinually
brimful, yet it never runs over, as


our Guides told us. Round about this Hall
hangs four Stones resembling four Fletches
of Bacon, for the outside is blackish and the
inside white; in this place the Daughter of
the old Sorceress had took up her Residence,
and appears to your eye like the Statue of a
Woman that is great with Child; she is of a
different colour from her Mother, being
much more dusky than she is: But nothing
more pretty to behold here than those
which they call 
The Organ Pipes
 placed upon
one side of the Rock, and are very like to
those we have in our Churches, some being
of bigger and some of lesser Dimensions, in
the middle of a good reasonable thickness
though at the ends sharp and slender. After
some more Difficulties in our Passage, and no
less dangerous than before, we came into a∣nother
part of the Cave more strange than
any we had yet seen. 'Tis a place they call
the 
Dancing Room,
 so well Contriv'd, and so
curiously set forth, that 
Nature
 hath wrought
here what Art could never do or compre∣hend,
both above and below; if you look up,
the variety of Colours which are there to be
seen by the light of the Candles, and the
checquered Configurations of the Rock,
which is now very high above your head;
will both feast your Eyes and refresh your
Body, which by that time is sufficiently wea∣ried
by the tediousness, as well as the trouble


of the Passage; for there is so great a glister∣ing,
such a Lustre as it were of Silver and
precious Stones round about you, that you
would be ready to mistake your self, and
think that you were in the Palace of some
great Monarch of the Earth, and not in such
a dismal Cave; and if you look down, there
you will find no stony, hard, ruggy Tract to
perplex you, but a fine, even, sandy Flower,
and indeed beyond expectation, that we who
had beheld such craggy Stones and dange∣rous
Passages should at last arrive in so spa∣cious
and delightful a place; they told us,
That it was very usual for Gentlemen and
Ladies, that lived thereabouts, to bring Mu∣sick
and Dance here, the Musick making a
more sweeter Melody than ordinary; we
paused and breathed a little here, delighting
our selves as well with it, as also with the
resemblance of a Chimney, which we took
really to be one, it being of that fashion, and
having in it a kind of black moist Matter,
which, if you touch it, will stick to your fin∣gers,
and black them like Soot, and yet no
fire was ever known to be there: But we
were not as yet satisfied, though we were a∣bove
300 Yards under the Ground, and in a
most horrid Dungeon, but went still farther
to a place termed 
The Seller,
 that is curious∣ly
vaulted, and 'tis very usual to carry Bottles
of Wine and drink there upon a stone Table


which is form'd in it of natural Stone; in
this place lies also a great Stone which they
call 
The Great Gun,
 the nature of it is this,
take it but up in your hands, and let it fall
down to the ground, and a great Gun can∣not
give a louder Report. We tried the Ex∣periment
thrice, but we thought the very
Rock we were under would have rent in
pieces about our Ears, yet they that were
half way the Cave, or at the Mouth of it,
heard nothing of any noise at all; this we
found experimentally true, for one of the
Persons that accompanied us in our Journey,
staying a little distance in the Cave, being
unwilling to venter any farther, assured us
when we came back, that he had not
heard any noise at all; we ventured a lit∣tle
farther, and at the end of the Celler,
when we had gone down some few Steps,
we found a great Rivolet several Yards deep,
but as clear as Chrystial, and pleasant to the
Taste, but very cold; it gave a Period to our
Journey. It runs under ground, though its
Head from whence it first springs is like that
of the River 
Nilus
 in 
Egypt,
 which is not yet,
or at least very difficult to be discovered,
conveying it self out of this Cave, it sets
30 Mills on work after it comes into the ad∣jacent
County, as we were informed. When
we had got thus far, and almost a Mile un∣der
ground, as our Guides told us, we be∣gan


to think how we should return and get
out safe, being afraid to find the same diffi∣culty
and trouble we had encountered with
in our Entrance; for tho' the Place was some∣what
resembling an Infernal Abbyss, and
our Passage into it proved so troublesome
and irksome, yet we came back without any
toil, or rather with great facility and plea∣sure,
notwithstanding 'tis impossible to find
out the way without a Guide, there being
so many Turnings and Windings; nor could
the Guides themselves, without a light,
find the way out of this forlorn place, where∣by
they steer their Course: However, at
last, we made a shift to creep up again to the
top of the Rock, just as merry 
Lucian
 tells us
old 
Menippus
 did out of a hole in 
Lebadia,

after he returned from Hell, and had ended
the Discourses with the Ghosts below. Thus
have I given you a small Relation of this
wonderful Rarerity.


GLASTENBURY
 lies four Miles from

Wells,
 a Place of great Antiquity, as any
whatsoever in the Kingdom; for the Origi∣nal
thereof is deducted from 
Joseph of Arima∣thea,

who, together with 
Mary Magdalen, La∣zarus

and 
Martha,
 was sent hither by St. 
Phi∣lip

the Apostle of the 
Gauls,
 to preach the
Gospel about 63 Years after Christ, and
were buried here themselves, upon which
account it was, in process of time, very


much enlarged by pious Princes, King 
Ina

who was the first here, that caused his Sub∣jects
to pay 
Peter-Pence
 to 
Rome,
 rebuilt
the Abby which was then gone much to
decay; to which he added a very fine and
stately Church, dedicated to Christ, S. 
Peter,

and S. 
Paul;
 and that which is very remar∣kable
here, is the Kitchin of the Abbots, be∣ing
20 foot high, built in the form of a Py∣ramid
of pure Stone, and divided into four
Angles or Corners; to each of which were
allotted a Window and a Chimney: But all
of them went to rack, and were razed to the
ground, and there is nothing left now but
the Ruins to proclaim its former Glory and
Magnificence; and to reckon up all the Kings
of the West-Saxons that were buried here
would be too tedious.


The 
Walnut-Tree
 and 
Holy Hawthorn.
 But
to come nearer to our own days, here was
something not many years since very notable
and strange: The 
Walnut-Tree
 in the holy
Churchyard, that did never put out any
Leaves before S. 
Barnabas
 day, and upon that
very day grew rank and full of Leaves; and
the 
Hawthorn
 in 
Wiral
 Park, that always on

Christmas-day
 sprouted forth as if in 
May,
 both
deserve Credit, as well as Admiration: For
the truth of both these we were credibly in∣form'd
of divers Persons Inhabitants of this
Place; and that these Trees, through the


Malice and Fury of some Person in the late
Warrs, were cut down and destroy'd: But
many things here are very observable, which
I have not room to insert.


BATH.
 It lying low and all sides sur∣rounded
with Hills, the Town is well water∣ed
with Springs, though some of them are
sulphureous and bad to the Tast; environ'd
with a Wall, very commodious for its Mar∣ket-place,
and handsomly adorn'd with three
Churches; one whereof is very large and
spatious, built in the form of a Cathedral;
the Steeple is four-square, and hath a Ring
of very tunable Bells, and a Quire with very
sweet Organs; and in it are erected several
antient and stately Monuments of Persons of
Quality, and Bishops of this See, who have
been noble Benefactors to it; 'tis governed
by a Mayor and Aldermen, and the Assizes
are generally kept there in the Summer
time: But that which is most remarkable
here, and causeth a Concourse in the Sum∣mer
not only of the Nobility and Gentry,
but of the Commonalty too, from all parts
of the Nation hither, are the 
Baths,
 which are
not inferiour to any that ever 
Italy
 or 
France

could glory in; they have without question
cured many weak and feeble Limbs, and do
cure divers Diseases which are incident and
destructive to Humane Nature; by causing
Men to sweat either more or less, propor∣tionably


to their Distempers. Who they
were that first found them out is very uncer∣tain,
whether 
Bleyden
 alias 
Bladud
 the Son of

Rudhudibras
 the Magician, or 
Julius Coesar,

I shall not undertake to determine the Con∣troversie:
However they are of very great
Antiquity, and 'tis many hundred years since
their powerful Vertues were first discovered,
though they are all different in their Nature,
as well as their Operation; as the learned
Dr. 
Stubbs
 by divers Experiments assures us.
The Baths are in number six; the King and
Queens Baths, the 
Cross Bath,
 the 
Hot Bath,

the 
Leper's Bath,
 and the 
Horse:
 That which
is the Chief is the 
Cross Bath,
 the Water
whereof being more mild than the other,
the Orders are very strict and regular. And
Persons of the greatest Quality of the Nation
chuse to bath themselves here, and to drink
the Water thereof; hard by this stands the

Hot Bath,
 not much frequented save by those
who having quite lost the Use of their Limbs,
come hither to seek remedy: Not far from
this is that they call the 
Leper's Bath,
 which
is believed to be very efficacious against that
spreading Disease: And an Hospital, or Spit∣tle,
built by 
Reginald
 Bishop of 
Bath,
 for the
Use and Benefit of poor, aged, decrepid Peo∣ple.
About the middle of the Town, near
to the great Church are the King and Queens
Baths, the Water of the one flowing into


the other; and the difference is, that the
King's Bath is large, and the Queens lesser
in circumference; and I was credibly infor∣med,
that there hath been found here an an∣tient
Statue of 
Hercules,
 amongst other great
Monuments of Antiquity, holding a Serpent
in his hand; which was found in the Ruins
of a famous Temple, that once stood here,
near this place: And it might be thought
very convenient, as well as reasonable, that

Hercules,
 who exposed himself to such diffi∣culties
and manifold dangers, and underwent
such hard and unsupportable Labours, should
now and then ease and refresh his weary
Limbs by such Purgations as the Baths could
afford him. In this, and other Baths, hang
divers Crutches of lame and decrepit Persons,
which they left behind them as Trophies of
their Recovery, being perfectly cured of their
Lameness and Infirmity, and restored again
to their former Health and Strength. Last
of all, that which is called the 
Horse Bath,

is very effectual for the Cure of lame and
foundred Horses, and the removal of some
other Distempers. Thus have I given a
short account of the Bath, 
&c.
 Many things
there are more in this County very observ∣able
for all Travellers to take notice of,
which I think too tedious to relate.








Bristol.


The next Place we went to in these Parts
was 
Bristol,
 which is undoubtedly the Se∣cond
City of 
England,
 which if we consi∣der
the Stateliness of the Buildings; or its
Natural, or Artificial Fortifications; the Com∣modiousness
of its Harbours, and its most
pleasant Situation betwixt the two Rivers of

Avon
 and 
Frome;
 its lofty Churches, and
its stately Palaces; the great Concourse of
Foreigners, as well as the great Number of
Natives, Citizens: Upon which account, no
Wonder if both the Counties of 
Somerset
 and

Gloucester
 do contend which of them may be
most glorious and happy, in its Superiority
over them; and yet neither of them can at∣tain
to that Honour, it being both City and
County of itself, and having particular Pri∣vileges,
Immunities, and Laws of its own:
'Tis governed by a Mayor and two Sheriffs,
twelve Aldermen, with other Ministers and
Officers befitting its dignity; 'tis environ'd
with a double Wall, and adorn'd with two
navigable Rivers, 
Avon
 at Spring-Tides is
11 or 12 Fathom deep, and 
Frome;
 over
which stands a Bridge beautified with curi∣ous
Edifices, consisting of four large Ar∣ches:
It is very convenient for the Ships
and great Vessels to anchor in, and hath a
Key in it very commodious for the export∣ing


and importing of Goods, out or into the
Merchants Houses: This returns back into
the River 
Avon;
 and so both by their mu∣tual
Union enrich this City, and augment
its Happiness At what time it was first built
is very hard to determine, but it seems to
have been of latter years, because we find it
no where spoken of by Historians in the times
of the 
Danes,
 when they made their Invade
into this Nation: And it is supposed to take
its rise in the Declination of the 
Saxon
 Em∣pire,
at the time when 
Harold
 is said to have
sailed from 
Bristol,
 with a great Navy, into

Wales;
 which was about 213 years before
our Saviour's Incarnation. 
Robert,
 Bishop of

Constance,
 made choice of this place first to
begin his War in, which he designed against

William Rufus;
 and did encompass it with
the inner Wall, as some conjecture, part of
which in some places is still to be seen; and
from that time it hath received great En∣largment,
and by degrees is risen to that
we now behold it in: As its Houses are fair,
and its Streets clear; so are its Gates strong
and its Churches glorious, consisting of
nineteen Parish-Churches, whereof that
which is the Cathedral, and Mother-Church,
dedicated to S. 
Austin,
 and endow∣ed
by King 
Henry
 the 8th. with Revenues
for a Bishop's See; yet notwithstanding this,
the Church of 
Ratcliff
 in the Suburbs of this


City is a more noble Structure, being curi∣ously
Arched, and made a stately Fabrick all
of pure Stone, without any Addition of
Beams, or Rafters of Timber, no not one
Stick to be found throughout the whole
Building; the Steeple is four square, and of
a great height, but most artificially carved
with divers Sculptures, all at the cost and
charges of one Mr. 
Cannius
 a Merchant of
this City about 108 years since, who in the
erecting this famous piece of Architecture,
employ'd at his own Expence 800 Labour∣ers
and Artificers, besides Masons and Car∣penters
to the number 300, in all 1100, for
2 years together; until the Work was total∣ly
compleated; and in it his Monument doth
stand in Marble: May his Memory be more
lasting, than that Marble which is set to pre∣serve
it; and his Name more durable than
any Monument, and remain to succeeding
Generations.


S. 
Vincent
's 
Rocks.
 On the Northern side
of this City are several high and craggy
Rocks, by which the River 
Avon
 gently glides
along, till it returns back again into the 
Se∣vern;

one of the chief whereof is called
S. 
Vincent
's 
Rock,
 which hath great plenty of
pellucid Stones, commonly called 
Bristol-stones;

the learned Mr. 
Cambden
 hath observed, that
their Pellucidness is beyond that of the Dia∣mond
we receive from the 
Indies;
 only the


Hardness of the latter gives them the pre-emi∣nence;
and yet certainly Nature never made
greater demonstrations of her Art, having
made some of these Stones as smooth as the
most expert Jeweller could have done, as
round and sharp, as broad above and small
beneath, as the greatest Artist could have ef∣fected;
shaping some of them with four, some
of them with six Angles apiece, like the Stones
which we usually set in Rings. To make us
still the more admire her Perfections, she hath
not given them all one colour, but some of
them are like Chrystal, clear; and some of
a more ruddy colour, and sanguine com∣plexion,
according to the nature of the Soil;
she causeth her Productions not to be unlike
their great Parent.


The 
Hot Well.
 There is one thing still
here very remarkable, and that is the 
Hot
Well,
 which is just at the bottom of this Rock,
and at the very brink of the River 
Avon;
 yet
it still retains its natural Head, and by its con∣stant
Ebullitions purgeth away all the Scum
and saltish froth it might have contracted by
the Sea; the Water is exceeding wholesome,
and very good to purge away ill Humors, and
purifie the Blood; and I was there credibly in∣formed
that it hath wrought great Cures, and
is much frequented and resorted to by seve∣ral
sorts of People.








Devonshire.


The next County we went to in these
Parts, was 
Devonshire,
 where we made but
little Stay: The Air is sharp and wholesome,
the Soil hilly and woody; and they use here,
as they do likewise in 
Cornwall,
 Sea-Sand to
mend and inrich their Land. The chief Com∣modities
of this County are, Wooll, Kerseys,
Sea-Fish, and Sea-Fowl; and the West of it is
well stored with Tin Mines, and Loadstones
have been found upon 
Dartmore
 Rocks of
good value and vertue, so at other places in
this County are found Mines of Lead, and
some Veins of Silver.


Upon 
Exmore
 Forest are such huge Stones,
and placed confusedly as they are upon 
Salis∣bury

Plain, and one of them hath 
Danish
 Let∣ters
upon it directing Passengers that way. At

Hubblestow
 in this County was a Battle fought
by the 
Danes,
 where their Banner called 
Rea∣fan,

in which they reposed all their confidence,
of Victory and Success, was notwithstanding
taken, and 
Hubba
 their General slain.


The People of this County are strong; and
well made, and as they have a peculiar sort of
quaking Pudding, which they call Whitepots,
so the Women have a peculiar kind of Gar∣ment,
which they wear upon their Shoulders,
called Whittles; they are of divers Colours
made like Mantles, with Fringes about the


Edges, without which the common sort of
People never ride to Market, nor appear in
publick.


In divers places of this County the ways are
so rocky and narrow, that it is not possible
for Waggons to pass, so that the Coun∣try
People are forced in Harvest time to
carry home their Corn upon Horses in certain
Crooks made for that purpose, which creates
no small Toil and Labour to them.


EXETER
 is the principal City in this
Province, situated upon the Eastward by the
Banks of the River 
Ex,
 or 
Ise,
 upon a little
Hill, gently arising with an easie Ascent to
a pretty height, the Pendant whereof lies East
and West, environed about with Ditches
and very strong Walls, having many Turrets
orderly interposed, and six Gates which
gives entrance into the City, and contains
about a Mile and half in circumference; the
Suburbs branch forth a great way on each
side; the Streets are broad, kept clean and
well paved; the Houses are as gay within as
trim without; there are Seventeen Parish-Churches,
and in the very highest part of the
City near the 
East Gate
 is a Castle, formerly
the Seat of the 
West Saxon
 Kings, and after∣wards
the Earls of 
Cornwal,
 which 
Baldwin
de Redures
 the Governor holding out against
King 
Stephen,
 was by scarcity of Provisions
forced to Surrender, and after the surrendry,


he, with his whole Family was banished that
Kingdom. Just without the 
East Gate
 are
two pleasant Walks call 
Southney
 and 
North∣ney,

beset on both sides with Rowes of high
Trees, which being mounted up aloft afford
a curious Prospect to 
Topesham,
 the place
where all the Ships and Vessels of the Citi∣zens
lie at Anchor, from whence (since the
River was stopt up by certain Dams or Wears
that 
Edward Courtney,
 Earl of 
Devonshire,
 for
some Distaste that he had took from the Ci∣ty,
caused here to be made) all their Goods
and Commodities are brought home by
Land. In the same quarter of the City stands
the Cathedral founded by King 
Athelstan
 in
honour to St. 
Peter,
 and 
Edward the Confessor

made it the Bishop's See of 
Cornwall
 and 
Kir∣ton,

and Constituted the first Bishop thereof,
who Successors augmented it greatly both in
Edifices and Revenues, and 
William,
 the Ninth
Bishop after him, when the Monks were dis∣planted
brought in a Dean and Four and
Twenty Prebendaries, to which has been ad∣ded,
in our times, four Arch-Deacons. In the
Church are Six private Chappels, and a Li∣brary
very handsomly built and finished by a
Physician of this City; the Quire is curious∣ly
beautified and adorned, especially with
Organs, whose Pipes, though they are of a
larger size than any which ever we beheld in
any Cathedral besides, yet the Musick is ex∣treamly


pleasing and melodious to the Ear.
All which Additions hath been erected since
the Return of K. 
Charles
 II.


On the West side of this City runs the Ri∣ver,
over which is built a strong Stone-bridge
with four Arches, and about the middle of
the City is the Town-Hall, where the Assizes
and Sessions are held for the City, it being
both City and County of it self. 'Tis gover∣ned
by a Mayor, two Sheriffs, four and twen∣ty
Aldermen, a Recorder and Town-Clerk,
with other Officers befitting the Grandeur of
so honourable a Place.






Plimouth.


So called from the River 
Plime
 which runs
along by it, where is one of the largest and
most securest Haven in 
England,
 for before
the very Mouth of it lies St. 
Nicholas
 Island,
strongly fortified both by Art and Nature,
and in the Haven are Fortifications laid on
both sides for the safe Riding of Ships, and
the annoyance to Enemies. One the one side
is Mount 
Batton,
 in which is a strong Garri∣son,
having twelve Guns mounted upon its
Platforms, and on the other side the Cittadel
which may, for Strength, compare with most
Places in the Nation, commanding both the
Sea and Town at Pleasure; without the Walls
of the Cittadel runs a Trench, out of which
was digged a certain kind of Marble with


which they were built, being Eleven Foot
thick at the bottom, and Seven at the top,
and three quarters of a Mile in compass; up∣on
the Walls are placed divers Watch-Tow∣ers,
and each of them are adorned with a
round Ball upon the top, so curiously gilded
and painted with the King's Arms, that they
make a very great glistering shew at a di∣stance;
and round about are placed between
two and three hundred Pieces of Ordnance.
There are two Gates, and as many Draw-Bridges
which gives entrance into the Castle,
and upon the Front are admirably carved
the Arms of his Majesty, by which is placed
his Royal Statue, with the Arms of the Earl
of 
Bath
 who is Governor hereof; within the
Walls is the Governor's house, and divers Ap∣partments
for Soldiers, a Magazine for Am∣munition,
and a Store-house for Provisions:
For the Strength and Conveniencies of this
Fortress, which is almost impregnable, the
Town is much obliged to the excellent In∣genuity
of Monsieur 
Bernard de Gum,
 his Ma∣jesty's
Engineer.


The Commodiousness of the Harbour of∣tentimes
causeth a Fleet of Ships to ride
here; 'tis now so replenished with Marri∣ners,
frequented by Merchants, enriched by
Traffick, that it seems to outvey some great
Cities of this Kingdom. It is Governed by
a Mayor, Aldermen and Common-Councel,


who have a stately 
Guild-hall
 for their more
solemn Conventions, and is adorned with two
handsome Churches.






Cornwall.


This place is hilly; one cause of a very tem∣perate
heat of the Summer, and the lateness
of Harvest, as its Situation is the cause of the
gentleness of the Winter. Its Hills are par∣ted
with short and narrow Valleys, the Earth
is but shallow, underneath is Rocks and
Shelves, so that it is hard to be Tilled, and
apt to be parched by a dry Summer. The
middle of the Shire lies open, the Earth be∣ing
of a blackish colour, and bears Heath
and Spirry-grass; there is but little Meadow-ground,
but store of Pasture for Cattle and
Sheep, and plenty of Corn-ground.


They have a Stone called here a 
Moor-stone,

found upon Moores and waste Ground, which
serves them instead of Free-stone for Win∣dows,
Doors and Chimnies, it is white with
certain glimmering Sparkles; they have like∣wise
a 
Stone
 digged out of the Sea-cliffs of
the colour of a grey Marble, and another
as black as Jet, and out of the Inland Queries
they dig Free-stone; nor must we omit
what is here observed of some Stones, That
the Sea works the Pebbles upon the shoar,
by the frequent rolling of the Waves, into a
kind of roundness.



They have a Slate of three sorts, Blew,
Sage-leaf coloured and Grey, which last is
the worst, and all these Slates are common∣ly
found under another kind of Slate that
they Wall with when the depth hath brought
the Workmen to the Water. They also make
Lime of a kind of Marble-stone by burning
it. There are Copper Mines in sundry pla∣ces
of this County, and the Ore is sometimes
shipped off to be refined in 
Wales:
 and tho'

Cicero
 will have none in 
Brittain,
 yet Silver
hath been found in this County in the time
of 
Edward
 the First and Third, who reaped
good profit by it: Nay Tinners do find little
quantities of Gold, and sometimes Silver a∣mongst
the Tin Ore▪ as I was informed; but
for the generality the Mettal that the Earth
abounds with in this County is Tin.


Richard,
 Earl of 
Cornwall,
 Brother to King

Henry
 the Third, was the first that began to
make Ordinances for these Tin works, and
afterwards 
Edmund
 his Son granted a Char∣ter
and certain Liberties, and prescribed
withal certain Laws concerning the same,
which he ratified or strengthened under his
Seal, and imposed a Rent, or Tribute upon
Tin to be paid unto the Earls; these Liber∣ties,
Privileges and Laws King 
Edward
 the
Third afterwards confirm'd and augmented.


In some places on the Sea Coasts there are
Pearls found that breed in big Oisters and


Musles, yet though they are great they are
not good; here are also Aget and white Co∣ral,
as they say, 
&c.
 In the West Parts of

Cornwall
 there are Bents growing on Sandy
Fields, which are knit from over the head
in narrow breadths, after a strange fashion,
of which they make Mats: Many other
things here are very observable in this Coun∣ty,
but I shall forbear mentioning any more,
because it will seem tedious.






Dorsetshire.


'Tis a County of very fertil Soil, well
shaded with Woods, enriched with Pasture,
and covered with great Flocks of Sheep.


PORTLAND,
 although some would
have deriv'd its Name for its lying over a∣gainst
the Port of 
Weymouth,
 yet it seems rather
to have receiv'd it from one 
Port,
 a Noble

Saxon,
 who about the Year 703, grievously
infested and annoyed these Coasts. This same

Portland
 was very much exposed to the 
Danish

outrage, but after their Wars were over, it
fell into the Possession of the Church of 
Win∣chester,

when 
Emma,
 Mother to 
Edward the
Confessor,
 being Accused by her Son with too
great familiarity with 
Aldwin,
 Bishop of 
Win∣chester,

and having cleared herself of that un∣just
Imputation, by suffering (which in those
Days was a usual Trial of Chastity) in wal∣king


bear-foot upon Nine 
Culters
 of red hot
Iron, which she did to a Miracle, without a∣ny
harm or prejudice to her self; she for a
Memorial hereof, bestowed Nine Lordships
upon the See of 
Winchester,
 to which her Son
added this Island, with many other Revenues,
to expiate the Crime of this defamitory Sus∣picion,
and unjust Accusation of his Mother's
Honesty. The Island is about seven Miles in
compass, rising up about the sides with high
Rocks, but lying low and flat in the midst,
inhabited scatteringly here and there, plenti∣ful
enough of Corn, and very good to feed
Sheep, but great scarcity of Wood. The
ancientest of their Inhabitants do find a∣mongst
the Weeds of the Sea a thing grow∣ing
without Leaves like Coral, which when
it is cut waxeth hard and black, but 'tis ve∣ry
brittle, and if it fall it soon breaketh; it
grows amongst that Sea-Weed called 
Alga;

here is likewise divers Querries of excellent
Stone, which is conveyed into divers Parts
of this Nation, and especially to 
London
 for
the rebuilding of Churches; on the East side
there is only one Church, and some few
Houses standing close thereto; and on the
North side is a Castle built by King 
Henry
 the
Eighth, which being well Fortified, com∣mands
the Entrance into the Haven of 
Wey∣mouth.

From hence we went to 
Dorchester.




DORCHESTER
 is about 7 Miles from
the Sea, and is the Head Town of the whole
Shire, watered by a small River, but neither
very large nor beautiful, being much decay∣ed,
and long since dispoiled of its Walls by
the 
Danes,
 who raised, as it thought, certain
Trenches, whereof one is called 
Maumbury

being an Acre inditched, another 
Poundbury

somewhat greater, and the third a Mile off
as a Camp with fine Trenches containing near
ten Acres called 
Maiden-Castle,
 which, in all
probability, was a 
Roman
 Station; but that
which argues its Antiquity is the Coin of
the 
Romans
 both Copper and Silver found
there, and especially at 
Fordington,
 hard by
which the common People call King 
Dorne
's
Pence, whom by some Allusion to the Name
they think him to be the Founder of the
Town. It had anciently a Castle in that
place, where the 
Grey-Friars
 built their Con∣vent
out of the Ruins thereof. It has three
Parish Churches, and several Alms-houses
for the support and maintenance of poor
impotent People, and it was formerly a no∣ted
Place for the Manufacture of Cloth, and
is now for Sheep, of which there are huge
Numbers to the great benefit and enriching
of the County. The next Shire we de∣sign'd
to pursue our Progress in was 
Hamp∣shire,

of which it follows.








Hampshire.


We went out of 
Dorsetshire
 through some
part of 
Wiltshire,
 which I have already men∣tioned,
and so came into the Confines of

Hampshire,
 and past through part of 
New
Forrest,
 where along the East is the Banks of
the River 
Avon. William the Conqueror
 demo∣lished
all the Towns, Villages, both Houses
and Churches far and near, and likewise re∣jected
the Inhabitants; after having done
so, he made all the ground within the com∣pass
of 20 Miles into a Forrest, or Harbour
for Wild Beasts, and so it was called 
New
Forrest;
 and this he did, either that the 
Nor∣mans

might arrive more securely in this
place 
(Normandy
 lying just over against it)
in case new Broils should arise after his Con∣quests,
or for the Pleasure he took in Hun∣ting,
or else to encrease his Treasure; for
being better affected, and more favourable
to Beasts than Men, he imposed very heavy
Fines and Penalties, yea, and most grievous
Punishments upon all such Persons as did
meddle with the Game; but it seems the
Children suffered for the Cruelty of their
Father, for 
Richard,
 his second Son, and 
Wil∣liam
Rufus,
 who Succeeded him, both perish∣ed
in this Forrest, the one with a Blast of
pestilent Air, the other with an Arrow shot
by chance by Sir 
Walter Tirrel: Henry
 like∣wise


his Grandchild by his eldest Son 
Robert,

whilst he was here in the hot pursute after
his Game, was caught up by a Bough, where
in a very short time he underwent the mise∣rable
Fate of poor 
Absolom.
 The first Town
of Note we came to in this County was

Southampton,
 which is situated betwixt two
Rivers, the one running forth at the West
side called 
Test,
 and the other on the East.
The Town is fair and hath stately Buildings,
with two commodious Keys which do high∣ly
adorn it, and the great concourse of Mer∣chants
which Trade to Foreign Parts do
mightily enrich it. There are five Parish-Churches,
with one for the 
French,
 likewise
it hath a strong Wall and seven Gates, with
a Castle upon a Mount cast up to a great
height built by 
Richard
 the Second, and it
was made a Corporation by 
Henry
 the Sixth,
who Constituted it both Town and County,
which doth abundantly dignifie it. It hath
three Markets a week, and that for Fish is five
Days in a Week; 'tis likewise of great Note
for building of Merchant's Ships. After some
small stay here we went to 
Winchester,
 of
which take this following Account.






Winchester.


I find it to have been a Place of great An∣tiquity,
and that it was in great Request a∣mongst
the 
Romans.
 In this City was 
Con∣stance,



who, was become a Monk, saluted

Caesar
 by the Order of his Father 
Constantine,

though afterwards he paid dearly for his
Honour by the loss of his Life. This was
the chief Seat in which the 
Saxons
 placed
themselves, and made it famous by their e∣recting
Magnificent Temples; in the Time
of the 
Normans
 too it flourished exceeding∣ly,
until it was almost once or twice quite
destroyed by the Sword, but now again 'tis
very fair and populous, large and stately, and
is computed to be within the Walls above a
Mile in length; it hath six Gates which
give entrance into the City, though all of
them have been very much defaced in our

Civil Wars,
 as likewise the Castle which for∣merly
hath been very formidable for its
Strength and Impregnableness. This is that
Castle that 
Maud
 the Empress having took,
held it out some considerable time against
King 
Stephen,
 and being at last strictly be∣sieged
by the Bishop of 
Winchester
 then in be∣ing,
who was Brother to the King, fearing
to be took Prisoner and delivered up into
her Enemies hands, she secured her self by
this cunning Way; she commanded it should
be given out for a most certain truth that
she was Dead, and was carried out upon a

Beir
 as if she had been so indeed, and by
this means she deceived her Enemies, and se∣cured
her own Person. Upon the Wall here∣of


hangs the 
Round Table
 so much talked of,
and called by the Name of King 
Arthur's
Round Table,
 whether this can gain to it self
so great Antiquity as is attributed to it, I
shall not undertake to determine, yet certain
it is, that those kind of Tables are of a very
long standing; for formerly when there hath
been great Entertainments amongst the vali∣ant
Champions of this Nation, it was usual
for all such to sit round them, lest any Dif∣ference
should arise amongst the Noblemen
about Superiority of Place. About the mid∣dle
of the City stands the Cathedral, built
by 
Kenelwalchius,
 King of the West 
Saxons,

who Constituted 
Ina
 the first Bishop there,
and it was always had in great Veneration
by the 
Saxons,
 because divers of their Kings
was Enterred in it, and was called by them

The Old Monastery;
 there is a Dean and 12
Prenbendaries belonging to it; the Church
is curiously adorned with Monuments of an∣cient
Hero's and Bishops of that See, 
William
Wainfleet
 Founder of 
Magdelen
 College in

Oxford
 lies here Entombed with his Hart in
his Hand, and Cardinal 
Beaufort,
 and Bishop

Gardner,
 that bloody Scourge to the poor
Protestants in Queen 
Mary
's days, who did
so insatiably thirst for the Blood of Queen

Elizabeth,
 but was always crossed in his most
wicked Inclinations; there lies also the Lord

Weston,
 Earl of 
Portland,
 whose Monument is


of Brass, and by him his Father who lies in
Marble; here is likewise preserved the Chair
of State in which Queen 
Mary
 was Married
to King 
Philip;
 the Countess of 
Exeter
 is al∣so
Enterr'd here; also the Chappel of Bishop

Fox
 is worth ones observation which he built
for his own use, together with his Study and
Press for his Books all in one place. In the
Quire under a plain flat Marble Stone lies the
Body of 
William Rufus,
 King of 
England,
 who
received his Mortal Wound as he was Hun∣ting
in the 
New Forrest
 by Sir 
Walter Tyrrel;

Sir 
Walter
 shooting at a Deer unawares hit him
on the Brest on which he died immediately,
and was brought to 
Winchester
 and buried
in this place, though afterwards his Bones
were Translated into a Coffer. At the West
end of the Quire stands in Brass two Statues
very curiously wrought, the one of King

James
 the First, and the other of King 
Charles

the First of ever blessed Memory; there is
another thing also very remarkable in the
Cathedral, and that is the rich and famous
Monument of 
William
 of 
Wickham,
 who was
Constituted Bishop of 
Winchester
 in the Reign
of 
Edward
 the Third: But to return again
into our Discourse relating to the City. We
find it not only to have attained a great E∣minency
for its Religious Houses, for its
pleasant Gardens, for its Silver-stream'd
Brooks and flowry Meadows, for its publick


and private Edifices, for its great Hall where∣in
the Assizes are usually held for the Coun∣ty
of 
Southampton,
 not to be parallel'd for
Length and Breadth by any throughout this
Nation, except 
Westminster,
 for the Antiquity
of its Corporation, with the true and exact
Rules of Equity and Justice prescribed by its
Governors and Magistrates; 'tis likewise re∣ported
to have been very famous and re∣nowned
by its Sufferings and Ruins of its
Palaces, and in the time of 
Adelstane,
 King
of the 
West Saxons,
 that invinceable Hero,

Guy
 Earl of 
Warwick,
 in a single Combat
slew 
Colbrand
 the 
Danish
 Giant in 
Hide-Mead

near to this City. After some time spent
here, we travelled to 
Portsmouth,
 of which I
come next to discourse of.


PORTSMOUTH
 is about 16 Miles di∣stant
from 
Winchester,
 and situated in a little
Island called 
Portsey.
 'Tis a place of great
Strength, and of no less importance by rea∣son
of the Dock, where many of the King's
greatest Men of War are built, those impreg∣nable
Wooden-Walls of our 
Brittish
 Island.
'Tis fortified with a Wall made of Timber,
and the same well covered over with thick
Banks of Earth; 'tis likewise environed with
a double Trench, over which are placed two
Drawbridges, from which about a Mile di∣stance
is another, and at all of them stands
Centuries of Soldiers who are kept in Garri∣son,


with a little Fortress adjoining to it
which leads up the Continent; to the Sea∣ward
is a Castle and Block-houses, which be∣ing
first begun by King 
Edward
 the Fourth,
King 
Henry
 the Seventh, as it is reported, did
afterwards compleat; which Fortifications
have of late Years received exceeding great
Augmentations by the succeeding Monarchs,
especially in the late King 
Jame
's Reign.
Here is only one Church, and an Hospital
called 
God's House,
 built by 
Peter Roch,
 Bishop
of 
Winchester;
 hereabouts are divers Saltpan∣houses,
which make exceeding white Salt.
Much more might have been wrote concer∣ning
this County, but this may suffice for
these two Reasons; the first is, The smallness
of the Volume will not allow it, and the se∣cond
is, That what has been related is the
notablest, and most requisite to be mention'd.






Sussex.


The next place of Note we went to was

Chichester
 in 
Sussex.
 'Tis a good large City
well Wall'd, re-built by the second 
Saxon

King of this Province; it was before the
Conquest of a small Repute, Bishop 
Raulf

built a Cathedral here, which before he had
fully finished was consumed by Fire, yet by
his Endeavours, and the bounteous Liberali∣ty
of King 
Henry
 the First, it was raised up
again, and is now a Bishop's See. The Church


is not very large, but was formerly a curi∣ous
beautiful Fabrick, having a Spire-steeple
of Stone of a very great height, and an high
Tower standing near the West Door, which
was built by King 
Rinon,
 as they say. In
the South Cross-Isle of the Church was for∣merly
on the one side artificially pourtrayed
and painted the History of the Churches
Foundation, with the Images of the Kings
of 
England
 on the other; there was likewise
the Images of the Bishops, at the charge of
Bishop 
Sherborne,
 who greatly Adorned and
Illustrated this sacred Structure. The City
is walled about in a circular round Form,
the 
Lavant,
 a pretty River, running hard by
it on the South and West sides. It hath four
Gates opening to the four Quarters of the
World, from whence the Streets leads direct∣ly,
and cross themselves in the midst where
the Market is kept, and where Bishop 
Read

Erected a fair stone Market-house, supported
with Pillars round about.


We went from hence to 
Amberly
 Castle,
which is about 12 Miles from 
Chichester
 high∣er
into the County; it was built by 
William
Read,
 Bishop of 
Chichester,
 in the Reign of

Edward
 the Third for the use of his Succes∣sors,
and Leased out now to the worthy Fa∣mily
of the 
Butlers,
 who are the present In∣habitants.
We stayed here the space of a
Week, where we were generously Entertai∣ned


with great courtesie and civility. We
went from hence to 
Arundel,
 and from thence
to 
Lewes,
 of which take this brief Account.


ARUNDEL
 is about four Miles from

Amberly,
 situated upon the Brow of an Hill,
but finding nothing to detain us here but
the Ruins of an old Castle, which for many
Generations hath successively appertained to
the Earls of 
Arundel,
 we travell'd on to


LEWES,
 which was the next Town we
came to. 'Tis situated upon a Rising almost
on every side, and hath been Wall'd, but now
there is no great sign of the Walls; there is
several Streets near it as Suburbs, and in the
times of the 
Saxons
 when King 
Athelston

made a Law for the coining of Money, he
appointed two Coiners in this place. There
are five Churches belonging to it, and this
place was very memorable for that Mortal
and bloody Battel between King 
Henry
 the
Third and the Barons, in which prosperous
beginning of the Fight on the King's side,
proved the overthrow of his whole Army,
for whilst Prince 
Edward
 his Son, breaking
by force through certain of the Baron's
Troops, carelesly pursued the Enemy over∣far,
as making sure account of the Victory;
the Barons having reinforced themselves, and
giving a fresh Charge, so discomforted and
put to flight the King's Forces, that they
constrained the King to accept of unequal


Conditions of Peace, and to deliver his Son
and others into their hands. From hence
we went to 
Pevensey,
 or 
Pemsey,
 of which it
follows.


PEVENSEY,
 or 
PEMSEY.
 There is a
very low Level which, some are of Opinion,
hath been over-flowed by the Sea, and the
Town of 
Pevensey
 is the noted place for the
first Landing of 
William the Conqueror,
 and for∣merly
there was a Haven and Castle. 
Hastings

is not far from hence, where was fought
that bloody Battel betwixt King 
Harold
 and
the 
Norman
 Duke, which proved so fatal to
the 
English,
 and successful to the 
Normans,

which Ground where the Fight was hath
been thought ever since to have worn the
Conqueror's Livery, because always after
Rain it looks of a reddish colour. I could
haved cited other Remarks in this County,
but what is related is most material.






Kent.


'Tis a County divided into three several
Portions, the first of which is called 
Health
without Wealth,
 the second is 
Health and Wealth,

and the third 
Wealth without Health,
 to all
which Nature notwithstanding hath liberally
apportioned so many Blessings, that she com∣pensates
the Defects of one thing by the
Collation of another, not suffering any pecu∣liar
Place to monopolize all her Favours at


once; but thus, if the 
Weald
 be very emi∣nent
for 
Wooll,
 the same of 
East Kent
 shall be
as great for 
Corn,
 and 
Tenham, Goddington
 and

Otham
 shall be no less cried up for 
Orchards,

and 
Sheppey
 for the best 
Wheat,
 and 
Thanet

shall bring forth as good Crops of 
Barley;

but if 
Dover
 and 
Cranbrooke
 hath the Name
for 
Beer, Tunbridge
 shall for 
Water,
 and if ei∣ther
the fertility of the Soil, or safe Roads or
sure Harbours for Ships, or the broad Streams
of great Navigable Rivers, or the vicinity
of a vast and large City can be any ways to
advance it Prosperity, it must needs be one,
if not the most flourishing County in the
Kingdom of 
England:
 As touching the Cu∣stomes
and Privileges of 
Kent,
 they have been
already so fully discoursed of by Mr. 
Lambert

in his 
Kentish Perambulation,
 and what was
by him omitted, have been supplied by the
ingenious Pen of Mr. 
Philipot,
 so that I shall
wave them, and only give a very small ac∣count
of it, although I have been in most
Towns and Parishes in this County. 
Canter∣bury,

because the Antiquity of this City, with
all its Liberties and Privileges, the Beauty
and number of all its Churches and Religi∣ous
Houses before their Dissolution, the Mag∣nificence
of its Cathedral, with all its renow∣ned
Tombs and Monuments are very exqui∣sitely
Surveyed and Discribed by other Pens,
I shall not go about to pourtray that in any


contracted Landskip, which hath been be∣fore
represented in so large a Scheme, but
referr all such as desire a particular Account
of this City, to those Writters who have
pencelled out every Part and Limb thereof
with great Exactness and Accuracy.






Rochester.


A City which, in ancient Times, was e∣minent
for its Strength and Granduer, and
had not those violent Impressions which the
rough hands of War formerly defaced and
deminish'd its Bulk, and bereaved it of its
Beauty, it might have been registered at this
day in the Inventory of the principal Cities
of this Nation. In the Year 1225, by the
indulgent Bounty of King 
Henry
 the Third,
it was invested with a Wall, and that this
Fortification might be of more concern∣ment,
it was secured or fenced with a Ditch.
It was governed by a 
Port Reeve,
 until King

Edward
 the Fourth in the Second Year of his
Reign raised it to a higher Dignit
, and de∣creed,
by his Royal Grant, that it should
henceforth be under the Jurisdiction of a
Mayor and Twelve Aldermen, and to this
Monarch doth the City owe much of its
present Felicity; indeed formerly many and
dismal Calamities did attend it, and that so
frequently, that the fury of the Elements
seemed to enter into a Corrivalship, or Com∣petition


with the fury of the Enemies for its
ruin, and the Fire and Sword seem'd to be
join'd Confederates to destroy it. Never∣theless
it maugres all these Casualties by the
Favour of the Princes, and their Royal Mu∣nificence,
it still recruits its Losses, and sur∣vives
in Splender. The goodly Skeleton of
the Castle, which yet courts the eyes of the
Beholders to an admiration of its former
Strength, and built many hundred Years
since. The Cathedral, with the Bishoprick
of 
Rochester
 united to it, were formerly E∣stablished
by that pious Monarch 
Ethelbert,

King of 
Kent,
 and the first Bishop to whom
was entrusted the Pastoral Staff or Crosier,
was Bishop 
Augustine,
 the Apostle to the 
Sax∣ons.

Here is likewise a very fine stone Bridge
built by Sir 
Robert Knowles
 over the River

Medway,
 which is fixed and built upon one
and twenty Arches, and coped about with
Iron-spikes by Archbishop 
Warham,
 and leads
into 
Stroud.


And because (according to the Orator)
every one is obliged to be serviceable to his
Country proportionable to his Abilities, and
every one hath an inrate Propensity to love
the Native Soil which first gave him a Being,
I cannot but in Duty pay some Acknowledg∣ments
of the Benefits I have received herein,
both for my Nativity, and first Education,
and indeed I may justly say without any par∣tially,


That it is a Province not much infe∣rior
to any in 
England,
 being divided into
three several Parts, of which I have made
some mention before. It is in all parts so
sufficiently fruitful of all things necessary for
the use of Man, and if we will take the pains
to course over the Vallies, we shall find the
Earth groaning under the burdens of boun∣tiful

Ceres,
 and the Fields and Meadows in
contest which should shine most gay and glo∣rious;
if we range the Woods and Hills, we
shall hear such charming Melodies by the
mutual reciprecation of Birds and Trees, that
we should fancy all had got the knack of
Speaking and Pratling, Groves being now
become visible to us; if we be so curious
as to dig into the Entrails of the Earth, and
take a view of the recondite Treasures, we
shall find plenty of Iron-Ore in the South
parts of this County, and great Queries of
Stone in several places; also towards the
North side they dig out of the Earth plenty
of excellent fat Chalk, which they use to
lay upon their Land for the enriching of it,
and causeth it to bring forth great Crops of
Corn: If we be taken with the harmonious
Murmurs of Brooks and gentle Rivers there
are several, the Banks of the Noble River of

Thames
 on the North side, and the River 
Med∣way

which comes out of 
Surrey
 glides along
for many Miles together on the South side


of this County, and takes its course through
almost the middle of the County, and doth
not run swift in many places, but glides soft∣ly,
admiring, as it were, the pleasantness of
its Soil; there is also at 
Newel
 in the
Parish of 
Orpington
 the finest Spings undoub∣tedly
in the Kingdom, both for the clear∣ness
of its Water, and the rising up of it in
such abundance, that within two Furlongs
of the Head it drives a Mill, and afterwards
is called by the Name of 
Cray River.
 Most
of the Rivers in this County do afford seve∣ral
sorts of Fish to gratifie the Pallate, and all
the Towns and Villages are well inhabited,
having a great many very fine Seats of No∣blemen
and Gentlemen, in which respect 'tis
honourable; the Churches fair and uniform,
and so 'tis glorious; the Air in many parts
is clear, which renders it wholsome.


One word or two I must I say in relation
to 
Maidstone.
 'Tis the principal Town in the
County; as in respect of its having the As∣sizes
and Sessions kept in it, and its being si∣tuated
near the middle of the County upon
the River 
Medway,
 which renders it so plea∣sant
and delightful, that even that alone
might be sufficient to set forth all the other
Parts of it. Leaving this place, we soon af∣ter
arrived in 
London,
 where we only tarried
a reasonable space of time to give our Selves
and Horses some Rest and Refreshment, as


likewise to visit our Friends and Acquaintan∣ces,
and then proceeded on, designing to finish
our intended purposes, and so (with God's
Assistance) took Horse and went to






Essex.


RUMFORD
 is about 10 Miles from

London,
 in the County of 
Essex.
 It is well sto∣red
with Inns, and hath a great Market for
Cattel; the whole County is populous, ha∣ving
in it divers fine Seats of Persons of Qua∣lity.
We tarried here not long but Travell'd
on to 
Burntwood,
 and so to 
Ingerstone,
 both
which Places have no great Remarks worth
our tarrying, we rid on to 
Chelmsford,
 which
place is situated in the heart of the County
between two Rivers which meet here. It
hath a great Market for Corn, and the As∣sizes
are generally held here for the County;
here are likewise several Persons of Quali∣ty's
Seats in and about the adjacent Places,
which do mightily enrich it. We stayed
here but one Night, and the next Place of
Note we came to in this County was 
Colche∣ster,

of which it follows.


COLCHESTER
 is pleasantly seated up∣on
the brow of an Hill, and doth extend it
self in length East and West, and is very nu∣merous
for Inhabitants whereby its Buildings
are enlarged, and its Churches encreased to
the number of fifteen; but in the late unhap∣py



Civil Wars
 it had its share of Calamities,
for being close Besieged by their Enemies,
the 
Royalists
 who were within behaved them∣selves
so bravely, that they could neither
take it by Violence, nor enforce it to a Sur∣rendry,
until at last having blocked up all
places whereby the least Provisions might be
conveyed to them, so that they were redu∣ced
to that Want and Exigency, Hunger ex∣ercising
its Tyranny within the Walls with
no less Vigour than the Enemy did without,
that they were compelled by one Enemy to
surrender to the other, by trusting to the
a merciless Sword, rather than to die thro'
griping Hunger: So that the Rebels having
got possession of the Town, they did not on∣ly
use their utmost Cruelty upon the weaker
Sort, who could make no resistance, but even
in cold-Blood did they barbarously murther
those very Persons, who, had they been at
the Head of an Army would have made the
stoutest Champion of their Party to give way
to them. Sir 
Charles Lucas
 and Sir 
George Lisle,

Persons of as great Integrity and undaunted
Courage as any whatsoever, were cowardly
and cruelly Shot to death by the Sanguinary
of the insolent Soldiers in the 
Castle Yard,
 on
which very Spot of ground where they fell
down dead hath never since sprouted up a∣ny
Grass, as there were wont, the Ground
it self from that time being clad in mourn∣ing,


Weeds and Grass dreading such execra∣ble
Murthers, retires and hides its head with∣in
the Bowels of the Earth, and this Plat of
ground is a Monument to succeeding Gene∣rations,
yet doth a Vault that belonged to the
Family of Sir 
Charles Lucus
 secure both his
own and his Fellow-sufferer's Bodies from a∣ny
farther Attempts of the Sons of Violence,
and being wrapped in Lead they were laid
in that Church which was next to his own
House, which formerly was a fair and sump∣tuous
Structure, but ruinated by his Enemies
who hated the House for the Master's sake.
The Castle which did stand about the midst
of the Town, is likewise now demolished and
gone to decay; and though the Inhabitants
shewed us a Brazen-gate which gives en∣trance
into a Vault fifteen Miles under the
ground, as some of the Inhabitants tell Sto∣ries
of it, yet I think there is no credit to be
given to it. Here are other large Towns,
and a considerable many of stately Buildings,
but I have not room here to insert them.
From hence we went to






Suffolk.


IPSWITCH
 is a Town very commodi∣ous
for its Haven, Enriched by foreign Com∣merce,
replenished with Inhabitants, ador∣ned
with several magnificent Churches, and
being united into a Corporation is governed


by two Bailiffs, who have all other Ministers
befitting their Granduer to attend them, tho'
formerly it hath sustained great Losses by the

Danes;
 the Streets are very clean and well
paved, and in the midst of the Market-place,
which is surrounded with rich Shops and
goodly Houses, stands a very curious square
Cross which hath the Effiges of 
Impartiality,

bearing a pair of Scales in one hand and a
Sword in the other, a sit Emblem to re∣minde
the Magistrates of the exact Measure
that they must use in the distribution of Ju∣stice.
The Store-houses which are kept for
the King's Ships do much promote the Trade
of the Town. Before the subversion of the
Monasteries, it could glory in four Religious
Houses, besides a magnificent College ere∣cted
by Cardinal 
Woolsey,
 who received his
first Breath in this place, being only a But∣cher's
Son of this Town.


St. EDMUNDS-BURY,
 or 
BURY,
 a re∣nowned
Town; a Place for situation and
wholsomness of Air so excellent, that 
Camb∣den

saith, 
Sol non vidit urbem situ elegantiorem▪

Many of the Gentry live here. There are two
Churches in one Churchyard, where there
are Lectures several days in the Week. Here
was born 
Richardus de Bury,
 Bishop of 
Dur∣ham,

the Governour of 
Edward
 the Third
when young, and famous especially for a
Work which he Entituled 
Philobiblos,
 in the


Preface of which he confesseth, 
Ecstatico quo∣dam
librorum amore potenter se abreptum.
 He
was well acquainted with 
Petrark
 the 
Italian,

and other learned Men of that Age. 
Brad∣wardine

Archbishop of 
Canterbury,
 and 
Richard
Fitzralph, Armachanus, Walter Burleigh, Robert
Halcot,
 and other most famous Men of that
Age were his Chaplains.


We have been at most of the Towns in
this County, and there is five hundred se∣venty
and five Parishes in it, and the whole
County is very fruitful. We went from
hence to 
Scole
 Inn in the County of 
Norfolk,

of which hereafter.






Norfolk.


SCOLE
 is a little Village very famous for
an Inn and Sign-Post built by Mr. 
Peck,
 a
Gentleman, which thing cost him several
Hundred Pounds. The House is of Brick ve∣ry
neat and uniform, and hath great variety
of Objects for diversion: In the Porch, at
the four corners, stands two Men playing on
Wind-Musick, a Tapster filling of Drink, and
a Mountebank shewing of Tricks; on the
two side-Posts 
Hercules
 with his Club, and

Sampson
 with his Jaw-bone; on the Front is
the Figure of the Whale vomiting up 
Jonah

out of his Mouth, and on the East side of the
House the Statue of 
Peace
 and 
Hope
 with an
Anchor and an Olive branch; but that which


is most admirable, is the contrivance of the
Sign-post which seems to contain great va∣rieties;
on the top of all is an Astrono∣mer
looking thro' a Quadrant, riding upon
an Anchor with the four Cardinal-Vertues
on each side of him, 
Fortitude
 with her bro∣ken
Pillar, 
Temperance
 with her Cup pouring
out Wine, 
Prudence
 with a Snake in her right
hand, and a Horn of Plenty in her left, and

Justice
 with a pair of Scales and a Sword;
along the Sign-post stands several Images ve∣ry
curiously carved and painted, the first re∣presents
a Huntsman equipped and accou∣tred
with his Horn and his green Jacket, just
as if he were then very hot upon the Chase,
and next to him 
Acteon
 transformed into a
Stag, with his Pack of Hounds worrying and
devouring him, the next is 
Diana
 with an
Half-Moon upon her head, and the Planets
under her feet, her Quiver in her hand, and
her Horn by her side, and before her is a
Greyhound, as it were, in a close pursuit af∣ter
the Hare; next to this stands old 
Time

with an Hour-glass on his head, a Sythe in his
left hand, and a prodigal Youth in his right,
and 
Death
 under his Feet with this Inscrip∣tion,

Tempus edax rerum;
 in the middle hangs
the sign of the 
White Heart,
 ingeniously con∣trived
into an Oval figure, with two Angels
and two Lions on each corner, under one of
which are placed four naked Boys treading


of Grapes, and under the other a Mounte∣bank
shewing of Feats of Activity; on both
sides are the Arms of the chief Families both
in 
Suffolk
 and 
Norfolk,
 and also a Shepherd
playing merrily upon his Pipes, and last of
all on each side of the Post which supports
the whole Fabrick, stands three-headed 
Cer∣berus
the Great
 of the Infernal Court, and old
grisle-bearded 
Charon
 with his Boat and Oars
wafling a Wench over the 
Stigion
 Lake; the
splendedness of this curious and costly piece
of Workmanship, is worthy of any Traveller's
observation. The next Town of Note we
came to in this County was


YARMOUTH,
 which entertained us
with a pleasant Prospect, the Haven being as
commodious as the Town is beautiful, and
is fortified both by Art and Nature, for al∣though
it be environed almost round with
Water on the West side by the River 
Yare,

from whence it borrows its Name, which
hath a Drawbridge over it, and from other
parts with the Ocean, unless it be North∣ward
where there is firm Land, yet it is like∣wise
enclosed with a very strong Wall, upon
which, besides Towers, is cast up a Mount
towards the East, and there are likewise plan∣ted
several pieces of Ordnance to defend the
Town and command the Seas; there is but
one Church, but that is fair and lofty, ador∣ned
with a high Spire-steeple, built at first by



Herbert,
 Bishop of 
Norwich;
 there are also di∣vers
clean and spacious Streets, on each side
of which are several Rows of very uniform
Buildings, inhabited by wealthy and gentle
Persons. This Town is of no long date or
standing, as appears by Antiquaries, for it
received its beginning from the Ruins of old

Garianum
 which was near this place, after
which, in a short time, as we were informed,
built this new Town which grew potent
and populous, and they strengthened it with
a Wall, and grew very numerous in Inha∣bitants,
and there happened a fearful and
sudden Pestilence, which in the space of a
Year brought above seven Thousand Men
and Women to their Graves, all which was
faithfully recorded in an ancient Table, which
formerly used to hang up in their Church,
but since restored to its primitive Lustre, and
their Wealth hath increased, and 'tis now a
place of great Merchandize and Traffick, but
especially renowned for its Fishery of 
Her∣rings

of which, at the Season, here is very
great plenty, and by their care and industry
are salted and dried in particular Houses de∣signed
and appointed for that very purpose,
and do supply our own and foreign Nati∣ons
too. The next place of Note we went
to was




NORWICH
 is one of the most renow∣ned
Cities in our 
Brittish
 Island, for whether
we consider the Wealth of the Citizens, the
Number of Inhabitants, the great Conference
of Foreigners, the stately Structures, and
beautiful Churches, the obliging Carriage of
the Gentry, and the Industry of the Com∣mons,
do all concur to illustrate and digni∣fie
it. 'Tis situated on the brow of a Hill,
and environed with a Wall in which are pla∣ced
divers Turrets, and twelve Gates to give
entrance into the City, unless it be on the
East side, where the River 
Yare
 after it hath,
with many windings, watered the most part
of the City, having four Draw-bridges for
People to pass over, and is a farther defence
by reason of its deep Channel, and high
Banks; 'tis reported to be a Mile and a half
in length, and half as much in breadth. It
hath had great Misfortunes, and suffered ve∣ry
much by the 
Danes
 when they took their
range in these parts, and after 
William the
Conqueror
 had settled the 
Brittish
 Crown up∣on
his head, it suffered much more, which
is too tedious to relate, but in succeeding
Ages it began to recruit its Strength, and
hath flourished exceedingly. King 
Henry
 the
First permitted the Citizens to Wall their Ci∣ty,
and King 
Richard
 the Second gave them
a Grant for the Transportation of Worsted,
and to advance their Trade which was ex∣treamly


eclipsed. King 
Henry
 the Fourth re∣newed
their Charter, and conferred on them
the Honour to chuse every Year a Mayor
for their Magistrate, whereas by a former
Order from King 
Stephen
 they were only go∣verned
by Coroners and Baliffs. It contai∣neth
thirty two Parishes, forty two Chappels
and Churches, of which the Cathedral is the
fairest and chiefest, the first Stone of which
was laid by Bishop 
Herbert,
 in the Reign of
King 
William Rufus,
 who Translated the E∣piscopal
See from 
Thetford
 to this place, and
procured a Grant to have it confirmed the
Mother-Church of 
Norfolk
 and 
Suffolk,
 en∣dowing
it with great Revenues, and it is a ve∣ry
stately and magnificent Structure, but most
famous for its Roof which runs aloft over
the very body of it, on which is drawn to
the life the whole History of the Bible in di∣vers
little Images, curiously carved and ador∣ned,
from the Creation of the World, to the
Ascention of our blessed Saviour, or the De∣scent
of the Holy Ghost, with the perfect re∣semblance
of our Lord's Crucifiction and Re∣surrection,
and divers other things. The
Market, Cross and Cloister of the Cathedral
are the fairest in 
England.
 There is a great
House that was the Duke of 
Norfolk
's, now
the Earl of 
Arundel
's, where there are very
fine Granaries, and the best Bowling-Alley in
the Kingdom. There is also an Hospital,


where an hundred Men and Women are
maintained. The Arms of the City are the

Castle
 and 
Lion.
 After some time of abode
in this City, we Travelled to a little Village
called


TETTLESHALL,
 in the Parish-Church
whereof is erected a stately Monument of
Marble, in honour to Sir 
Edward Cooke,
 that
most famous Lawyer of his time, on the top
are placed his Coat of Arms, with the four

Cardinal Vertues
 to support them at each cor∣ner,
his Effigies is of Marble laid out at full
length, above which this Motto is engra∣ven'd,

Prudens qui Patiens,
 and underneath in
golden Characters this following Inscription,

The Monument of Sir
 Edward Cooke, 
Knight,
born at
 Mileham 
in
 Norfolk, 
Recorder of
 Nor∣wich

and
 London, 
Solliciter to Queen
 Elizabeth,

and Speaker to the Parliament, afterwards At∣torney
General to her and King
 James, 
Chief Ju∣stice
of both Benches, a Privy Councillor, as also of
Council to Queen
 Anne, 
and Chief Justice in Eire
of all her Forrests, Chases and Parks, Recorder of

Coventry, 
and High Steward of
 Cambridge,

of which he was a Member in
 Trinity College.

He died in the Eighty third Year of his Age, his
last Words being these,
 Thy Kingdom come,
thy Will be done. The next place of Note
we came to in this County was 
Lynne Regis,

of which it follows.




LYNNE,
 this Town, though its standing be
but of latter Years, as receiving its Original
from old 
Lynne,
 which is seated in the 
Marsh-Land,

and is opposite against it, yet it is grown
of far greater request, for the commodious∣ness
of its Haven, and safe Harbour causeth
a great resort of Mariners to frequent it, and
the Vessels which come loaded with Coals
from 
New-Castle,
 do here, for the most part,
lighten their Burdens, and is conveyed into
the adjacent parts in the Counties. The
Town is environed with a strong Wall, the
Streets are well paved and kept very clean;
it is, for the most part thereof, divided by two
small Rivers that have fifteen Bridges, or
thereabout, over them; it is called 
Old Linne,

and 
Linnum Regis,
 that is, 
King's Linne;

there are five Churches to adorn it, the chief
of which is a curious Fabrick dedicated to
St. 
Margaret,
 upon the top of which stands a
large and stately Lanthorn very admirable
for its rare Workmanship. The Town is go∣verned
by a Mayor and Aldermen, which
have received great Kindnesses from their So∣vereigns,
and especially from K. 
John,
 who,
for the good Service they had done him in
defence of his Quarrel, not only presented
them with his own Sword from his side,
(which is continually carried before the
Mayor, when ever he pleaseth to appear in
publick) but likewise gave them a great Sil∣ver


Cup gilt for the use of the Town, which
because they shew it most to Strangers and
Foreigners who are of any Note or Repute,
they generally have it filled with Wine to
drink his Majesty's and Mr. Mayor's healths,
for which there is a particular Allowance
proportioned by the Town: Most of their
little Churches over the County are Thatch'd.
Here are many other things very observable
which I have not room to set down. We
went from hence to 
Cambridge,
 of which it
follows.






Cambridgeshire


Is an extream, pleasant, open County, and
a place of such Variety and Plenty through∣out,
that fruitful 
Ceres
 with a smiling coun∣tenance
invites the industrious Peasant to be∣hold,
with joy, the Fruits of his Labour,
whilst she crowns his Industry with a plenti∣ful
Harvest, and this County doth in divers
places make some annual Additions of ano∣ther
Crop, by adorning its Fields with large
Productions of Saffron, thro' which great Pro∣fits
continually arise unto them; here it is that
the green Banks of murmuring Rivers and
sunny Hills bedeckt with diversity of Plants
and Simples, call forth the Students from
their musing Cells, and teach them 
Theory,

by diving into their Natures, contemplating
their Signatures, and considering their Qua∣lities


and various Effects: In a word, here is
nothing wanting for Pleasure, Profit, or De∣light;
and though the Northern parts of
the County towards the Isle of 
Ely
 lying
somewhat low is moist and fenny, yet the
gentle Gales which are frequently stirring,
drive away all Mists and Fogs which may
seem to annoy it, and by their means makes
it a fit Seat for the Muses to inhabit, and we
have no reason to complain of the Soil,
since our wise Ancestors thought good and
convenient to plant a Colony here, and place
one of the Eyes of our Nation in this Spot
of ground, the famous and most glorious U∣niversity
of 
Cambridge,
 which we could not,
in honour, pass by without a Visit.


CAMBRIDGE
 was formerly called

Grantbridge,
 from a fair large Bridge made o∣ver
the River 
Grant,
 which is now called 
Cam,

from whence the Town it self receives its
Name. It is increased much by the Ruins
of 
Grancester
 sometime a famous City, situ∣tuate
a little above a Mile from this place,
and the Castle that is beyond the River, the
Ruins of which are still to be seen, was built,
as ancient Records testifie, in the first Year
of 
William the Conqueror,
 or in the first Year
of 
William Rufus
 in the Year of our Lord
1092, A Nobleman of the 
Norman
 Blood
named 
Picot,
 a 
Vice Comes,
 or Sheriff, at the


Request of his Wife founded a Church to
the honour of God, and Dedicated it to
St. 
Giles,
 near unto this Castle, but after∣wards
in 1102, the Canons were remov∣ed
from hence, and there is only one Col∣lege
beyond the Bridge sacred to St. 
Mary
Magdalen;
 on this side of it are very spacious
Streets, adorned with fifteen several magni∣ficent
Colleges and Halls, each of which are
liberally endowed with large Revenues, more
or less, in the practice of Religion, and the
dilligent pursuit of all kind of Learning;
here are fifteen Churches, besides private
Chappels in every College, the chief of
which is called St. 
Mary's
 Church, set a part
particularly for the use of the University,
and the Commencement is kept yearly the
first Sunday in 
July,
 that the Name and fa∣mous
Memory of our most pious Benefa∣ctors
may still flourish and be renowned, for
their great Munificence and most memoral
Acts. The Town is a Corporation, and is
governed by a Mayor and Aldermen, and
the Assizes, for the most part, are kept here
for the County, which is very profitable to
the Town, and 'tis observable that one High
Sheriff serves for both the Counties of 
Cam∣bridge

and 
Huntingdon,
 which borders upon
it; but one thing more is very noteable a∣bout
it, and that is the great Fair annually
kept within a Mile of it in 
September,
 called


by the Name of 
Sturbridge
-Fair; from whence
it received its Denomination is uncertain,
but this is most sure, that of all Fairs in 
Eng∣land,

'tis the greatest and best stored with all
kind of Wares and Commodities which the

Londoners
 take special care to import hither;
when you are within the limits, you would
rather be ready to imagine your self in some
great Town, by the variety of Shops and
multiplicity of Booths, than in a wide open
Feild, those Booths are always built for the
time in which it lasts, which is well nigh a
Fortnight; neither are you presented only
with Booths upon the Land, but Booths on
the Water too, there being particular Con∣trivances
in the Boats for Rooms and secret
retirements all covered above, for the conve∣niency
of Strangers which resort thither,
and indeed here is always a great Resorting
of People from most Parts of this Nation.


Near unto 
Cambridge
 on the South East
side, there appears aloft certain high Hills
called 
Gogmagog.
 On top of them is a very
large Fort, entrenched, strengthened with a
three-fold Rampire.


There are contained in the Shire, eight
Market-Towns, and one hundred and sixty
three Parishes.


Having paid our Devotions, and taken a
Review of that which affords so great varie∣ty,
we, at last took our farewel, and biding


it a-dieu we betook our selves into its neigh∣bouring
County of






Huntingdonshire


Is joined to 
Bedfordshire
 on the South, 
Nort∣hamptonshire

on the North and West, and 
Cam∣bridgeshire

on the East. 'Tis a very fruitful
County both for Corn and Grass, and is wa∣tered
by two pleasant Rivers 
Avon
 and 
Ouse.

The first Village we arrived at in this Coun∣ty
was 
Fenny-Stanton,
 but found nothing ob∣servable,
we went from hence to


GODMANCHESTER,
 a very great
Country-Town, and of as great a Name for
Tillage; situate in an open Ground, of a
light Mould, and bending for the Sun. There
is not a Town in all 
England
 that hath more
stout and lusty Husbandmen, or more Plows
a going: For they make their boast, That
they have in former time received the Kings
of 
England,
 as they passed in their Progress
this way, with Nine-score Plows, brought
forth in a rustical kind of pomp for a gal∣lant
shew.


Soon after King 
James
 the First came in∣to

England,
 here the Bailiffs of the Town
presented him with seventy Teem of Horses,
all traced to fair new Plows, in shew of their
Husbandry, of which when his Majesty de∣manded
the Reason, he was answered, 
That
it was their ancient Custom, whensoever any King


of
 England 
passed through their Town, so to pre∣sent
him.
 Besides they added, 
That they held
their Lands by that Tenure, being the King's Te∣nants.

His Majesty took it well, and 
Bad
them use well their Plows, being glad he was
Landlord of so many good Husbandmen in one
Town.


It is mention'd in History to have been a
flourishing City, and the old 
Roman
 Coins
which have been digged up there do attest
its Antiquity, and that a Bishop did former∣ly
reside in this place, when it was in that
condition.


HUNTINGDON
 is about half a Mile
distant from this place, and is the chief Town
of the County, situated upon the River 
Ouse,

over which stands a Bridge made of Stone
which gives entrance into it; the Houses are
fair, and the Streets large; 'tis adorned with
four Churches. and had formely an ancient
Monastery belonging to it, some of the Ru∣ins
are still to be seen. Near the River, up∣on
a high Hill, stands the remains of a Castle
which was built about the Year of Christ 917,
afterwards 
David,
 King of 
Scots,
 waging War
against King 
Stephen
 upon the account of

Maud
 the Empress, who was his Niece, this
then was given upon some certain Terms to
the 
Scotch
 King, who did exceedingly beau∣tifie
and strengthen it, by making strong Ram∣pers
and Fortifications round about it, but



Henry
 the Second finding it, in process of
time, a Cage for Rebels and Ring-leaders to
Sedition, at last quite demolished it; from
the top of the Hill is a very pleasant Prospect
for some Miles. The Town is governed by
a Mayor and Aldermen, and the Assizes are
held here twice a Year for the Shire, and
wants no kind of Provision to entertain Tra∣vellers
who resort hether out of the Nor∣thern
parts, the great Road to the City of

London
 lying through this Town.


In this Town, in the Year 1599, was that
Usurper and Religious Cheat 
Oliver Cromwel

Born and Educated, whom though we have
reason to curse his very Name, and detest
his Memory as odious and execrable, yet
since prosperous Successes of the most cruel
Tirants, makes others inquisitive after those
Persons which they did so fortunately attend.
It will not be amiss to tell the World that
this place gave him his first Being, who, 
Ne∣ro

like, destroyed his Father and his Mother
too; the Father of his Country, and his Coun∣try
too, being a Murderer of the one, and a
Plague to the other, who was of so unparal∣lel'd
and base a Temper of Mind from his
Cradle to his Grave, that nothing could stay
with him, or be pleasing to him long, but
what carried even the World before it Con∣fusion
and Ruin. In this little Shire are num∣bred
seventy eight Parishes, four Hundreds,


and six Market-Towns. We stayed here one
Night, and the next day we went into






Northamptonshire.


This County is situate in the very middle
and heart (as it were) of 
England.
 On the
East lie 
Bedford
 and 
Hunting donshires.
 On the
South 
Buckingham
 and 
Oxfordshires:
 Westward

Warwickshire:
 Northward 
Rutlandshire,
 and

Lincolnshire,
 separated from it by 
Avon
 the
less and 
Welland,
 two Rivers.


It is a champion County, exceeding po∣pulous,
and passing well furnished with
Noblemens and Gentlemens Houses, replen∣ished
also with Towns and Churches; inso∣much
as in some places there are twenty,
and in others thirty Steeples with Spires or
square Towers within view at once.


The soil very fertile both for Tillage and
Pasture, yet nothing so well stored with
Woods unless it be in the further and hi∣ther
sides. But in every place, as elswhere
also in 
England,
 it is over-spread, and (as it
were) beset with Sheep.


THARPSTONE
 is twelve Miles distant
from 
Huntingdon,
 has a great Market for all
sorts of Grain, and well stored with Inns;
from hence we went to another Town cal∣led

KETTERING,
 which is of much
more Note than it Neighbours, by reason of
a handsome Cross beautified with divers I∣mages


curiously carved; the next place was

HIGHAM-FERRERS.
 The excellent
Ornament of this place was 
Henry Chichley,

Archbishop of 
Canterbury,
 who built 
All-Souls

College in 
Oxford,
 and another here, where
he placed secular Clerks and Prebendaries,
and withal an Hospital for the Poor.


FOTHERING-HAY
-Castle, environed
on every side with most pleasant Medows.


Here 
Mary,
 Queen of 
Scots,
 was beheaded.


There belongs unto this Shire three hun∣dred
twenty six Parishes.






Leicestershire.


The next place of Note we went to was

Leicester,
 the Metropolis of 
Leicestershire.
 'Tis
more venerable for its Antiquity than its
comeliness, or present beauty. I find that
about the Year 680, it was a Bishop's Seat,
though in few Years after the Sea was Tran∣slated,
and the Dignity being taken away
from the Town, it began to go much to de∣cay,
but in the time of the 
Normans
 it flou∣rished
exceedingly, and encreased mightily
in Inhabitants, yet afterwards in the Reign
of King 
Henry
 the Second it was again invol∣ved
in great Calamities and Disasters. Here
is to be seen an ancient Hospital, in the Chap∣pel
whereof 
Henry,
 Earl of 
Lancaster,
 and 
Hen∣ry,

his Son, the first Duke of 
Lancaster,
 lie In∣terred,
for that Duke being very Aged, and


being willing to give some visible Testimo∣ny
of his Charity, built this Hospital for the
Use and Maintenance of divers poor, aged,
decreped Persons of both Sexes; and on the
other side, amongst those flowry Meadows
which the River 
Sore
 enricheth with its bub∣ling
Stream, 
Robert,
 the crook-backt Earl of

Leicester,
 built a Monastery very spacious and
magnificent, and Dedicated it to the Virgin

Mary,
 and endowed it with large Revenues.
In the Chappel of this Monastery lay interr'd
the great and puissant Cardinal 
Woolsey,
 who
being at first a poor Man's Son of 
Ipswich
 in

Suffolk,
 was raised by King 
Henry
 the Eighth,
for his great Parts and Learning, to the grea∣test
Degree of Honour in this Nation, being
advanced to be Lord Chancellor, of 
England,

and presented with a Cardinal's Cap from
the Pope, and the unknown Incomes and
Revenues, and by his great Treasures and
Mints of Money, atchieved more magnificent
Acts than ever any Prelate did before him,
for he erected the Royal Palace of 
Hampton-Court,

besides two famous Colleges, the one
at this Native Town, and the other a most
glorious Structure called 
Christ-Church
 Col∣lege
in 
Oxford;
 and for the height of his Li∣ving
and Attendance, it is very elegantly set
forth by the writer of his Life: But notwith∣standing
he was the Favourite of his Prince,
and the Darling of Fortune, and sued to by


Foreigners, and his own Country-men too,
as to be the only Person to apply to in all ac∣counts,
yet true it is, that Fortune very oft
sets great Persons upon the Hill of Honour,
thereby to precipitate them with the greater
Violence; we find this lofty Cardinal could
no way secure himself from the reach of fret∣ting
Envy, and learn'd by the mutability of
his own Condition, for being retired into the
Country, after he seeing his Fortunes began
to ebb at Court, having the Great Seal took
from him by the King's Order, and was af∣terwards
sent for by the Lieutenant of the

Tower
 to appear before his Majesty; and as
returning out of the North to the City of

London,
 in his Journy he fell sick of a Flux
at the Earl of 
Shrewsbury
's house in 
Sheffeild
-Park,
which being accompanied with a Fe∣ver
did so weaken his Body, that when he
came to 
Leicester
 Abby, which way he took,
he told the Abbot, after the Solemnities of
receiving him were past, 
That, indeed, he was
come to lay his Bones amongst them,
 which ac∣cordingly
came to pass, for their he died,
and after his death, his Corps being invested
by the Monks with all such Ornaments as he
was Professed in, when he was made Bishop
and Archbishop, as Mitre, Cross-King and
Pall, with all other things due to his Order
and Dignity, and having lain some few days
in State, to be visited by those who had a


mind to pay their last Respects to his Per∣son;
he was buried in their Chappel dedica∣ted
to the Virgin 
Mary,
 with great Solemni∣ty,
though all perished in the ruin of the
Monastery, Subverted not long after when
Popery was banished from the Confines of

England.
 This Town had its share of Cala∣mities
in the unhappy 
Civil Wars:
 It is well
furnished with all kind of Grain; it is go∣verned
by a Mayor, Alderman and Recorder,
with other inferiour Officers to attend them.
The Town is strengthened with several
Gates, in one whereof is kept the Magazine;
it is also adorned with divers eminent Fa∣bricks
both Sacred and Civil; the Cross in
high Street is a very excellent Structure; there
are likewise five Churches, by that which is
called St. 
Martins
 stands the new Hospital,
being a stately Edifice, built and endowed
by several Benefactors for the use of divers
aged Men and Women, with a Chappel, and
a Chaplain to read Divine Service, and to be
assistful to those poor People therein, and to
this joins their publick Library, which was
given for the use of Ministers and Schollars
who inhabit here; hard by St. 
Mary
's Church
stands the Castle, where the Assizes are kept
for the County, and by St. 
Nicholas
 there is
a Wall, which, by the Ruins of it, seems to
be of very great Antiquity, having several
hollow places in it of an oval form, of which


the Inhabitants have strange Conjectures
concerning them, as if there had been some
place in which the Pagans did offer up their
Children to their blood-thirsty Idols, or that
they made them here pass through the fire,
as the 
Israelites
 did to 
Moloch,
 but of this there
is no probability at all, and these only be∣ing
conjectural Guesses, I shall leave them,
and observe one thing more concerning this
Town. After the fatal Battel betwixt King

Richard
 the Third, and 
Henry,
 Earl of 
Rich∣mond,

afterwards 
Henry
 the Seventh King of

England
 in 
Bosworth
-field, about the Year of
our Lord 1485, in which King 
Richard,
 with
four Thousand Men more were slain, and not
above ten Persons on the other side. The
Corps of the deceased King was brought to
be buried there in great disgrace, as the day
before he went out in pomp; for his Body
being rifled by the Souldiers, was carried
naked behind a 
Pursivant at Arms,
 and be∣ing
all over daub'd with Mire and Blood,
was conveyed to the 
Grey Friar's
 Church,
that then was within the Town, and there
buried very obscurely and meanly, whilst

Richmond,
 with joyful Acclamations, was pro∣claimed
King in the very midst of slaughte∣red
Bodies round about.


CARLETON,
 all that are born there,
whether it be by a peculiar Property of the
Soil, or of the Water; or else by some other


secret Operation of Nature, have an ill favou∣red,
untunable and harsh manner of Speech,
fetching their Words, with very much ado,
deep from out of the Throat, with a certain
kind of wharling, the Letter 
R
 being very
irksome to them to pronounce.






Rutlandshire.


It is the least County of all 
England.
 Ly∣ing
in form almost round like a circle, it is
in compass so far about, as a Light-horsman
will ride in one day.


It was called 
Rutland,
 as one would say

Red-land,
 the Earth in this Shire is every where
red, and so red, that even the Sheeps fleeces
are thereby coloured red: The 
English-Saxons

called 
Red
 in their Tongue 
Roet
 and 
Rud.


UPPINGHAM,
 a place upon an high
ascent, whence that name was imposed, a
well frequented Market Town.


The 
Vale of Catmose,
 a field full of Woods.


Okeham
 is in the middle of it, so called from
Oaks.


This small Shire hath Parish Churches four∣ty
eight.






Lincolnshire.


A very large County reaching almost three
Score Miles in length, and carrying in some
places above thirty Miles in breadth; passing
good for yielding of Corn, and feeding of


Cattel, well furnished and set out with great
number of Towns, and watered with many
Rivers, having great store of Fish and Fowl.


BOSTON
 is a famous Town, standing
on both sides the River 
Witham,
 which hath
over it a wooden Bridge of great height, well
frequented by means of a commodious Haven
unto it: The Market-place is fair and large,
and the Buildings are very beautiful; also a
most stately Church, with a very high Tower-steeple,
and hath as many steps in its steeple
from the bottome to the top, as there are Days
in the Year; which Steeple salutes Passengers
and Travellers a great way off, and giveth
Direction also to Sailers. In the Coat of

Boston
 for the Corporation, there are three
Crowns relating to the three Kingdoms, the
Crest a Ram lying upon a Wool-sack, the
Ram signifying the great Sheep-walks in the
Fens round about, and the Wool-sack, that
it was a Staple-Town; the Supporters of the
Coat are two Maremaids, signifying that it
was a Port-Town.


LINCOLN.
 The chief City of the Coun∣ty,
and is large, well inhabited and frequen∣ted,
it is situated upon the side of an Hill,
and thence hath its Name from its Situation,
or because it hath been a Colony. Certain
it is a Place of great Antiquity, and of a very
long standing; there are fourteen Churches,
whereof the Cathedral is very glorious, being


not much in feriour to any, and in one of
the Steples there is a very great Bell rung by
sixteen Men, called 
Great Tom of Lincoln.


'Tis governed by a Mayor and Aldermen.
The Diocess here is the largest in 
England,

for after three Bishopricks were taken out of
it, it contained four whole Counties, and
parts of two; the whole Shire is divided into
three Part, whereof one is called 
Holland,
 a
second 
Kestuen,
 and the third 
Lindsey.


GRANTHAM,
 a Town of good resort, ador∣ned
with a School built by 
Richard Fox,
 Bishop
of 
Winchester,
 and with a fair Church, having
a Spire-steeple of a mighty height. There are
in this Shire six hundred and thirty Parishes,
thirty and one Hundreds, and thirty Market
Towns. We went from hence into






Nottinghamshire.


It is limited Northward with 
Yorkshire,

Westward with 
Darbyshire,
 and in some other
parts with 
Yorkshire.
 The South and East parts
thereof are made fruitful by the River 
Trent,

with other Riverets resorting unto it.


NOTTINGHAM
 is built upon a Rock,
and is environed by Rocks on one side which
are washed by a crooked winding of a com∣modious
River, and hath a very fair Park of
the Duke of 
New Castle
's adjoining to it, with
the Forest of 
Shirewood
 bordering upon it.
The Streets are large and well paved, the


Market-place very handsome and conveni∣ent,
the Churches spatious and well contri∣ved,
and the Houses high and stately, they
are for the most part built with Brick, but
some of them are rare pieces as well for Stru∣cture
as Design; and, in short, the whole
front of their Fabrick is beautified with Sculp∣tures
and glistering Balconies, the Inhabi∣tants
be very desirous of the new Modes and
Draughts of Architecture. The Castle which
is on the West side of the Town is situated
upon an exceeding high Rock, and is suppo∣sed
to be a place of very great Antiquity,
This Castle held out a Siege by the 
Danes
 a∣gainst

Alfred,
 and it was then called 
Snotten∣ham,

and now 
Nottingham.
 King 
Edward
 the
Second strenghened the Town by an addi∣tion
of Walls, and a new Castle was built by

William the Conqueror
 to keep the 
English
 in
awe and subjection, and by Art and Nature
together it became even impregnable. 
Ed∣ward

the Fourth illustrated it with several
Dwelling-houses for Commanders and Sol∣diers,
and indeed in the Rock upon which
the Castle stands, are several small Cottages
hewen out of it, in which, at present, dwells
divers poor people; and it is reported, that
it never was taken until it was surprized by

Robert,
 Earl of 
Derby,
 in the 
Baron
's Wars,
who having once got this entered the Town,
and then used the Townsmen according to


his pleasure; though I find too in the Life
of King 
Stephen,
 that 
Robert,
 Earl of 
Gloucester,

invaded this Town with a great Power, and
when most of the Townsmen were slain and
burnt in the Churches whither they fled for
refuge; there is a Story of one of them who
was richer than the rest, and being forced
to return to his own house by the Soldiers
that had taken him, to shew them where all
his Treasures lay, he bringing them into a
Celler, and whilst they were busy in break∣ing
open Locks and Coffers, conveyed him∣self
away, making the Door fast after him,
and set the House on fire, so that the Soldi∣ers,
being thirty in number, perished all in
the Flames, which ketching hold of other
Buildings joining to it, almost burnt up the
whole Town: But that which makes this
Castle most signally remarkeable, was the
Discovery of 
Roger Mortimore,
 Earl of 
March,

and the Imprisonment too of 
David le Brase,

King of the 
Scots,
 who was here confined;
the relation of which I shall set down as brief∣ly
as I can.


After King 
Edward
 the Second had been
Deposed and Murdered by the Plots of his
own Wife, Queen 
Isabella,
 and King 
Edward

the Third, her Son, had Reigned about four
Years, a Parliament was called at 
Nottingham,

where this 
Roger Mortimore,
 who was then
the Queen's most especial Favourite, was in


such Glory and Renown, that it was beyond
all comparison: None so much Lord Para∣mount,
as the Earl of 
March:
 None appears
in so great an Equippage, and attended with
so honourable a Retinue, as the Earl of 
March;

so that the King's Train was inferiour to his,
and his Majesty's Glory eclipsed, by the
Pomp and Grandeur of one of his Nobles,
for he very oft would presume to go fore∣most,
and his own Officers, and was so ex∣ceeding
proud and haughty, as to make all
Persons cringe, and do as great Homage to
him, as to Majesty it self; nay, he undertook
to Order and Dispose of all Persons and Af∣fairs
to his own Will and Pleasure; and here∣upon
one day he very sharply rebuked the
Earl of 
Lancaster,
 the King's Cousin, for pre∣suming
to appoint Lodgings for certain No∣blemen
near the Court, without his particu∣lar
License and Assignation, and having dis∣lodged
the Earl, with some other Persons of
very great Quality, and removed them a Mile
out of Town, he did by this means so in∣cense
the Nobility against him, that they be∣gan
to pry more narrowly into his Actions,
and being enraged to see his Pride and U∣surpation
of his great Prerogatives, they u∣nanimously
held against him, and gave it out
amongst the People, 
That this
 Mortimore 
was
the Queen's Gallant, and the King's Master, and
sought by all means he possibly could to destroy the


Royal Blood, and to Usurp the Crown;
 which
Report did so work upon some of the King's
most trusty Friends, that they got 
Robert Hol∣land,

who had a long time been Governor
of the Castle, and knew well all the secret
Corners therein, to swear Secrecy to them,
and Fidelity to the King, and accordingly to
assist them in those Designs they had in hand:
Whereupon one night King 
Edward
 lying
without the Castle, both he, and his Friends,
were brought by Torch-light through a se∣cret
place under ground, beginning a far off
from the said Castle, ('tis the Vault which is
still called 
Mortimore's Hole)
 till they came e∣ven
to the Queen's Chamber, which, by
chance, they found open; being armed with
naked Swords, in they rushed, leaving the
King in the same posture at the Door; being
entered into the Privy-chamber, they found
the Earl of 
March
 undressed, ready to go to
bed to the Queen, but they crossed his De∣sign,
and cool'd his Courage, halling him a∣way
by force, upon which the Queen cried
out, 
Good Son, take pitty upon gentle
 Mortimore,
suspecting her Son to be there in the compa∣ny:
The Keys of the Castle were presently
called for, and every place, withal the Fur∣niture
committed into the King's Hands, and

Mortimore
 was forthwith sent to the Tower,
who, being Tried by his Peers, Arraign'd
and found Guilty, was hanged upon the


common Gallows two Days and two Nights.
The Articles that were brought against him
were divers, though his Familiarity with the
Queen, his Treachery to his King, and his
great Service to 
David,
 King of the 
Scots,
 was
the chief, whilst he also burnt the Charters
by which the 
Scotch
 King stood obliged to
do Homage to the King of 
England,
 and there∣upon
ensued a great War betwixt them; for
King 
David
 being spurred on by the 
French

King Invaded 
England,
 and having made a
great Road into the Northern Counties, and
spoiling and burning every where as they
went along, at length, at 
Durham
 his Army
was routed, and himself taken Prisoner, be∣ing
first sent to the Tower, afterward com∣mitted
to this Castle, where, during his con∣sinement,
he engraved upon the Walls of his
Deportment, the History of our Saviour's
Death and Passion, the Relicts of which are
still to be seen. After eleven Years Impri∣sonment,
he was restored against to his King∣dom,
by paying a good Ransom for his Li∣berty;
but before he returned, he was one
of the four Kings that was nobly Treated by

Henry Picard,
 a Vintner, then Lord Mayor of

London:
 These were the four Kings, 
Edward

the Third, King of 
England; John,
 King of

France; David,
 King of the 
Scots;
 and the
King of 
Cyprus,
 together with 
Edward, The
Black Prince,
 all bearing him company at the


same Table; this was about the Year 1358.
But before I leave this Town, I cannot but
take notice of one thing more memorable in
our Age, this being the first place where
King 
Charles
 the First set up his Royal Stan∣dard
against the Rebels in the late unhappy
Wars, and when the King's Forces were for∣ced,
to leave it, the Castle was quite demo∣lished.
We went from hence to view the
Chair of 
Robin-Hood,
 of which it follows.


Having pleasured our selves with the An∣tiquities
of this Town, we took Horse and
went to visit the Well and ancient Chair of

Robin-Hood,
 which is about a Mile within the
Forest of 
Shirwood:
 Being placed in that
Chair, we had a Cap, which, they say, was
his, very formally put upon our Heads, and
having performed the usual Ceremonies be∣fitting
so great a Solemnity, we received the
Freedom of the Chair, and were incorpora∣ted
into the Society of that renowned Bro∣therhood;
but that we may not receive such
Privileges without an honourable mention∣ing
of the Persons that left them to Posteri∣ty;
know, we must, that the Patent was be∣queathed
to the inferior Rangers of this Fo∣rest,
by 
Robin Hood
 and 
Little John,
 honou∣rable
Personages indeed, being the chief Lords
of some most renowned Robbers in the Reign
of King 
Richard
 the First: This same 
Robin
Hood
 entertained one Hundred tall Men, all


good Archers, with the Spoil he daily made
himself Master of, whom four Hundred, tho'
every way well Accoutred to give Battel,
durst scarce make an Onset. He suffered no
Woman to be violated, oppress'd, oa any
ways molested; poor Men's Goods he spa∣red,
and did relieve them very liberally with
what he got from the rich 
Carles:
 He kil∣led
none, and by this means he did, for a
long time, keep up the Order of 
Knight Er∣rants.

Having, for some time, pleased our
selves with our new Brothers that very curte∣ously
entertained us, we went from hence into






Yorkshire.


The County of 
York
 is the greatest Shire
by far of all 
England,
 and is thought to be in
a temperate measure fruitful. If in one place
there be stony and sandy barren ground, in
another place there are for it Corn-fields, as
rich and fruitful; if it be void and destitute
of Woods here, you shall find it shadowed in
another place with most thick Forests. The
Length extendeth from 
Hart-hill
 in the South,
to the Mouth of 
Tees
 in the North, which is
near seventy Miles; the breadth from 
Flam∣brough-head

to 
Horn-Castle
 upon the River 
Lun

is Eighty; the whole circumference three
hundred and eight Miles.


HELMSLEY,
 a Mannor in 
Yorkshire
 hath
two Parks and a Chase in it, said to be about


146 Miles in compass, and had 40000 Tim∣ber-Trees,
and 200 Acres of Wood. There
are many Free-holders there.


The whole Shire is divided into 3 parts,
which, according to the 3 Quarters of the
World, are called 
The West-Riding, The East-Riding,
The North-Riding. West-Riding,
 for a
good while is compassed in with the River

Ouse,
 with the bound of 
Lancashire,
 and with
the South limits of the Shire, and beareth to∣ward
the West and South: 
East-Riding
 look∣eth
to the Sun-rising, and the Ocean, which,
together with the River 
Derwent,
 encloseth it.

North-Riding
 reacheth Northward, hemmed
in (as it were) with the River 
Tees,
 with 
Der∣went,

and a long race of the River 
Ouse.


YORK
 is the fairst City in all this Coun∣ty,
and deservedly reputed the Second of

England;
 for its Greatness and Munificence,
the pleasantness of its Situation, the Buildings
are stately and beautiful. The whole City is
rich, glorious and honourable, both in re∣spect
of its being governed by a Lord Mayor,
who moderates in all Cases of Temporal Af∣fairs,
as also by an Archbishop who is Judge
in all Spiritual Matters. The River 
Ouse
 flow∣ing
with a gentle Stream from the North
part cutteth it in twain, and divided (as it
were) into two Cities, which are conjoin∣ed
with a stone Bridge, having one mighty
Arch. There is a Cathedral Church dedi∣cated


to Saint 
Peter,
 an excellent fair and state∣ly
Fabrick, near unto which there is the
Prince's House, commonly called, 
The Man∣nour.


York
 was a Colony of the 
Romans, Ptolomey

and 
Antonine;
 and also by a piece of Money
coined by the Emperour 
Severus,
 in the re∣verse
whereof we read,

COL. EBORACUMLEG. VI.
VICTRIX.


Severus
 had his Palace in this City, and here
at the hour of death gave up his last breath,
with these words: 
I entered upon a State every
way troublesome, and I leave it peaceable even to
the
 Britains.


There are many fine Seats of Persons of
Quality, by reason of the Pleasantness of its
Soil, which abounds in Plenty of all things,
and for Pleasure and Recreation it affords the
most of any County in 
England.


In the 
North-Riding
 of this County is 
Ouns∣bery-Hill,

or 
Rosebery-Topping,
 which mount∣up
a mighty height, and maketh a goodly
shew a farre off, so often as the Head thereof
hath his cloudy Cap on, lightly there follow∣eth
rain whence they have a proverbial Rhime,


When 
Rosebery-Topping
 wears a Cap,


Let 
Cliveland
 then beware a clap.


I could have particuliz'd several other
Towns and Villages in this Shire, but what


has been related is most material, and again
the Volume is but small, and would not bear
it. In this County there are 459 Parishes,
under which are very many Chappels, for
number of Inhabitants equal unto great Pa∣rishes.
We went from hence into the Bishop∣rick
of 
Durham,
 of which it follows.






Durham.


The chief Town; in Latin, 
Dunelmum,
 a
County Palatine, and a Bishop's See; 'tis si∣tuated
upon a Hill, and encompassed almost
round by the River 
Were,
 is also shaped in
form of an Egg, and strongly fortified both
by Art and Nature. There is a stately Ca∣thedral
which makes a fine and lofty shew,
with an high Tower in the midst, and two
Spires at the West end. The County in ge∣neral
is very pleasant, and rich in its Moun∣tains
with Iron and Coals, and its Vallies with
Corn and Grass: But before I leave this Coun∣ty,
I cannot omit the mentioning of a certain
place near 
Derlington,
 which is 3 Pits full of
Water of a wonderful depth, called by the
common People 
Hell Kettles,
 concerning which
Sir 
Richard Baker
 in his 
English Chronicles
 gives
this Account, That in the 24th Year of King

Henry
 the Second the Earth in this place lif∣ted
up it self in the manner of an high Tower,
and so remained from Morning till Evening
unmoveable, and presently after that time


fell with so horrible a noise, that it affrigh∣ted
all the Inhabitants thereabouts, and the
Earth swallowing it up made those 3 deep
Pits, which are still to be seen. The next
place we took notice of was






Northumberland.


The Ground appears to be very barren and
rough, and is Mountainous and Rocky in ma∣ny
parts of it. Towards the Sea and 
Tine,
 by
diligence and good Husbandry, it becometh
fruitful, but elswhere 'tis hard and rugged.
By reason of the sharpness of the Air, and
coursness of the Soil, the Inhabitants are lookt
upon, and esteem'd to be a War-like People,
and excellent Light-horsemen. The Nobi∣lity
and Gentry of the North are of great An∣tiquity,
and can produce more ancient Fami∣lies
than any other Part of 
England,
 many of
their Gentry taking date before the Conquest,
the rest came in with 
William the Conqueror.


NEW-CASTLE upon TINE,
 (so called
because 
Robert de Curtois,
 Son of 
William the
Conqueror,
 built there a New Castle out of the
ground against the neighbouring 
Scots)
 the
very Eye of all the Towns in these Parts, en∣abled
by a notable Haven, which 
Time
 mak∣eth,
being of that depth, that it beareth very
tall Ships, and so defendeth them, that they
can neither be easily tossed with Tempests,
nor driven upon Shallows and Shelves. The


Town is situated on the rising of an Hill, a∣dorned
with four Churches, and fortified with
strong Walls which have 7 Gates in them,
with many Towers. It is wealthy, partly by
entercourse of Traffick with the 
Germans,
 and
partly by carrying out Sea-coals, wherewith
this Place aboundeth, both into foreign Coun∣tries,
and also into other parts of 
England.


BERWICK
 is the utmost Town in 
Eng∣land,

and the strongest hold in all 
Britain.
 It
is well near compassed about with the Sea,
and 
Twede
 together. Upon the West of 
Nor∣thumberland

the 
Picct's
 Wall is to be seen of
great height, and almost whole. There are
about 46 Parishes in 
Northumberland.






Cumberland.


This County is like the rest of the Nor∣thern
Counties, and hath a sharp piercing
Air; the Soil is fertile, for the most part, both
with Corn and Cattel, and in some parts
hereof with Fish and Fowl. Here are
likewise several Minerals which have of late
been discovered, not only Mines of Cop∣per;
but Veins of Gold and Silver too
have been found here, as I was credibly in∣form'd;
and of all the Shires we have, it is
accounted the best furnished with the 
Roman

Antiquities. Nor it is no less renowned for
its high Mountains than for its Mines, of
which there are three, 
Skiddow, Lanvellin
 and



Casticand,
 and these Words goes much con∣cerning
the height of them,


Skiddow, Lanvellin 
and
 Casticand


Are the highest Hills in all 
England.


CARLISLE,
 is commodiously Situated,
and is fortified with a strong Wall, Castle
and Cittadel; the Cathedral Church there
being formerly a very stately and magnifi∣cence
Structure, adorned with rare Ornaments.
Not far from this City, is a Trophy of Vi∣ctory,
as is supposed, called by the Country
People 
Long-Megg and her Daughters,
 being
Seventy and seven Stones, each of them Ten
Foot high above-ground, and one of them is
fifteen foot. There are in 
Cumberland
 9 Mar∣ket-Towns,
and 58 Parishes.






Westmorland.


It is so called because it lieth amongst

Moors
 and high Hills, and was, for the most
part, unmanured; such barren places the
Northern 
Englishmen
 call 
Moors;
 and 
Westmore∣land

is a Western Moorish-county. The Air
is sharp and cold.


KENDALE-KIRKE
 by 
Kendale,
 a ve∣ry
great Town of Trade and Resort, with
two broad and long Streets crossing the one
over the other; a place excellent for Cloath∣ing,
and for Industry so surpassing, that in re∣gard
thereof it carrieth a great Name. For,


the Inhabitants have great Traffick, and vent
of their Woollen-cloaths throughout all parts
of 
England.


APELBY,
 memorable for its Antiquity
and Situation only. It standeth in a pleasant
Site, encompassed for the most part with the
River 
Eden;
 for its Antiquity it deserves to
be counted the chief Town of the Shire. The
Castle is the common Goal for Malefactors,
and the Sessions and Assizes are there kept.


In this Shire are contained 26 Parishes.






Lancashire.


It is a large, populous and well wooded
County. The County Palatine of 
Lanca∣ster

(famous for the four 
Henries,
 the Fourth,
Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Kings of 
England,

derived from 
John Gaunt,
 Duke of 
Lancaster,)

is upon the South-confined and parted by the
River 
Mersey,
 from the County Palatine of

Chester,
 the County of 
Darbyshire
 bordering
upon the East; the large County of 
York∣shire,

together with 
Westmorland
 and 
Cumber∣land,

being her kind Neighbours upon the

North,
 and the Sea called 
Mare Hibernicum

imbracing her upon the 
West.
 Their Kine
and Oxen have goodly Heads and fair spread
Horns, and are in body well proportionate
withal; but the Ground, for the generality,
is Hilly and Mountainous.




MANCHESTER,
 a Town of great an∣tiquity,
from 
Main,
 a 
British
 Word, which sig∣nifieth
a 
Stone:
 It is seated upon a stony Hill,
and beneath the Town, there are most fa∣mous
Quarries of Stone. It far excelleth the
Towns lying round about it, for the Beauti∣ful
shew it carrieth, for resort unto it, and
for Cloathing: In regard also of the Mer∣cate
place, the fair Church and Colledge.


LANCASTER,
 or 
Loncaster
 from the Ri∣ver

Lone,
 the chief Town of this Region. I
shall now give a short Account of the Se∣ven
Wonders, which are as follows,






The First Wonder


Is at the 
Divel
's 
Arse,
 near a Village called

Castleton,
 sufficiently Noted for that wide
Subterraneons Cavarn, known by the Name
of the 
Devil's Arse,
 which runs under the
Hill upon which the Castle stands; and at
its Entrance, it is Large and Capatious, tho'
the further you go in, the more narrower
it is Contracted; within the Mouth of it
are several poor Cottages Erected, the top
of this Cave is an exceeding great Height,
and appears to the Eye as if it were Arched
above and Chequer'd with diversity of cul∣loured
Stones. At the Entrance the poor Peo∣ple
are very ready to attend with Candles,
and Lanthorns, to conduct Strangers in,
tho' it belonged to 
Satan
's Territories, and it


is very Dark and Slippery by reason of se∣veral
Currants of Water which runs along
the Cave, which puts a stop to your Jour∣ney;
there is a Story of a Shepherd that past
over all these Currents, and at last came in∣to
a very fair and delightful Meadow, which
savours too much of a Romance to be cre∣dited;
however, 'tis supposed could all these
Waters once be gone over, there might be
made some new Discoveries, but it is a dis∣mal
place both for its Name and Nature,
and hath so near a Relation to the Diaboli∣cal
Regions.






The Second Wonder


Is 
Mamtar;
 'tis a high steep Cliff, and from
the top of which Cliff or Rock the Sand tho'
the Air be never so Calm, doth continually
trickle to the bottom Night and Day, and
now and then great Stones fall down with a
very great Noise, and do much affright the
poor Neighbouring Inhabitants. On the top
of it, bubbles up a Fountain which in some
places streams down the Cliff.






The Third Wonder


Is a Fountain which Ebbs and Flows like
the Sea, receiving an influence from the
Moon, and observing the same regular Mo∣tions
by which the Ocean it self continually
is regulated.








The Fourth Wonder


Is called the 
Marble Stones
 by their order∣ly
Dispositions, into several rows, one row
higher than another; it seems rather to be
the contrivance of Art than of Nature, but
that we ought not to Derogate from that
great Parent, whose production are conti∣nually
Rare and Unimitable.






The Fifth Wonder


Is 
Elden Hole,
 near unto the Fourth Won∣der;
'tis reputed a bottomless Abyss, and
could never as yet by any Art be Fathom∣ed:
The Mouth of it is wide and craggy,
but the inward recesses contracted and in∣trecate.
There is a Story that they let a
Man down by Ropes, and Candles to light
him, to give an Account of this infernal
Pit, but paid dearly for his Presumption with
the loss of his life for his Boldness.






The Sixth Wonder


Is 
Buxtons-Well,
 about two Miles from
the fifth Wonder; it glories in a hot Well;
'tis inclosed in a very fair Stone Building,
erected formerly by the Earl of 
Shrewsbury;

the Operation is very near to that of the
Cross Bath, having two Springs of Water,
the one within a hand breadth of the other,
and one is Hot, the other cold as Ice.








The Seventh and last Wonder


Is 
Pool Hole;
 'tis a Hollow Cave under a
very high Rock, bearing some resemblance
with that by the City of 
Wells,
 called 
Ochy
Hole,
 but not containing in it self half so
great Varieties. From hence we went into






Cheshire.


It is a County Palatine, and of great
Note for plenty of several Commodities; as
also for most excellent Cheese, and the Men
and Women are generally Acounted very
Handsome here. There is in this County
great store of Salt-Springs, Mettals and
Mines, and in the River 
Dee
 is plenty of

Salmons;
 on the 
South
 part of 
Cheshire,
 Trees
are very frequently found by Diging under
the Ground, which is believed have been
here ever since 
Noah
's Flood.


The chief Town of this County is 
West
Chester,
 a City famous for its Antiquity and
Situation, and no less for its Renown; 'tis
Built in the form of a Quadrant, with very
spacious Houses, neat and uniform, and en∣vironed
with a very strong Wall, and hath
a Castle stands upon a high Hill near the
River 
Dee
 strongly Fortified. Here are se∣veral
Churches which are very Antient and
goodly Fabricks, but especially for the Ca∣thedrals.
The Houses are very fairly Built,


and along the chief Streets are Galleries or
Walking-places; they call them Rows, ha∣ing
Shops on both sides, through which a
Man may walk dry from one end to ano∣ther.


NANTWICH,
 which the River 
Wever

first visiteth, is reputed the greatest and fair∣est
built Town of all this Shire after 
Chester.

It is called the 
White-wich
 or 
Salt-pich,
 be∣cause
the whitest Salt is there boiled. This
Shire containeth 13 Market Towns, and 68
Parishes. We went next into






Shropshire.


Or the County of 
Salop,
 is for the most
part Rich in Corn and Cattle, and glories in
in its most famous City of 
Shrewsbury,
 which
is compassed almost round by the River 
Se∣vern,

having two fair Bridges upon it, and
is Fortified both by Art and Nature. It is
like a Horse-shew in the opening place, and
doubtless deserves the Observation of all
Travellers, more than any Town or City in
this Nation, and is built upon the Riseing
of a Hill; the Churches are very fair and
Spacious, it is inhabited with both 
Welsh
 and

English,
 speaking both Languages. One of
their Rarities there is their Cakes, such as
cannot be made so well in any other place
of 
England,
 and many things here is very
observable, which I shall not mention, be∣cause


they have been allready so well set
fourth by other Pens. From hence we went
into


LUDLOW,
 is one of the chiefest Towns
in this County, and is of greater Anti∣quity
than Beauty; 'tis Situated by a plea∣sant
River, and is famous for its Castle built
by 
Roger,
 Earl of 
Mountgomery,
 who enviro∣ned
it with a Wall a Mile in compass; af∣terwards
when 
Robert,
 Earl of 
Shrewsbury,

and Eldest Son to 
Mountgomery,
 was taken in
his Rebellion against 
Henry
 the First, and
was banished out of the Land; the King
took this Castle into his own Hands; after
this it was given away from the Crown,
by King 
Henry
 the Second, and came into
the Family of the 
Lacys
 and 
Mortimors,
 at
last to be the inheritance of the Princes of

Wales.
 And by this means beginning to be
in great request, the Inhabitants erected
a very large Church to make it more Fa∣mous;
and in a little time, it excelled all its
Neighbourhood, and out-shin'd them in Lu∣stre
and Dignity; for King 
Henry
 the Eighth
instituted here the Counsel of the Marches of

Wales,
 in which he Ordered there should be
a President, Secretary, Attorney and Solici∣tor,
four Justices of some of the Neighbour∣ing
Counties of 
Wales,
 and as many other
Privy Counsellours, as the Prince of 
Wales

should Elect to be Assistant to himself in this


Court, being erected for his own particular
Use and Service. We staid in this Town
but two Nights, and went from hence into






Staffordshire.


Is very Rich in Pasture and Cattle, and
enriched by the River 
Trent, Trigenta
 as some
will have it; because there are Thirty seve∣ral
Streams or Rivolets which run into it, or
Thirty several sorts of Fish which Swims
within its Streams: However, 'tis very Ad∣vantageous
to the whole County; the first
Town of Note we came to in this County
was


STAFFORD
 is situated on a pleasant Soil,
sweet Air, Environed with a Wall, and For∣tified
with Gates, and adorned with two
Churches, and a Spacious Free-School, and
a large Market-place, and the Houses very
Handsome and Beautiful; it is Governed
by a Mayor and Aldermen; not far from
the Town are to be seen the Ruins of an old
Castle, Situated upon a Hill, heretofore be∣longing
to the Barons of 
Stafford.


LICHFIELD.
 This City is low Sea∣ted,
of good Largeness, and Fair withall,
divided into two parts with a shallow pool
of clear Water; which Parts notwithstand∣ing
join in one by the means of two Bridges,
or Causeys, made over, that have their
Sluces made, to let out the Water.



It was beautified with a very goodly Ca∣thedral
Church, which being round about
compassed with a fair Wall-Castle-like, and
garnished besides with fair Houses of Pre∣bendaries,
and with the Bishop's Palace also,
mounting up on high with three Pyramids or
Spires of Stone, making a lovely shew,
and for elegant and proportional Building it
did yield to few Cathedral Churches, but
is now demolished. There are accounted
an Hundred and Thirty Parishes in this Shire.
We went next into






Warwickshire.


It is bounded on the 
East-side
 with 
Nor∣thamptonshire,
Leicestershire,
 and the 
Watling∣street
-way;
on the 
South
 with 
Oxfordshire
 and

Glocestershire;
 on the 
West
 for the greatest
part with 
Worcestorshire;
 and on the 
Northside

with 
Staffordshire.
 It is divided into a plain
Champion, and a woody Country; which
parts the River 
Avon,
 running crookedly
from 
North-East
 to 
South-West,
 doth after a
sort sever one from the other.


WARWICK
 is the principal Town of
the whole Shire. It standeth over the Ri∣ver

Avon
 upon a steep and high Rock, and
all the Passages into it are wrought out of
the very Stone. It stands in a dry and fer∣tile
Soil, having the benefit of rich and plea∣sant
Medows on the 
South
 part, with the


lofty Groves and spacious Thickets of the
Woodland on the 
North.
 It hath a very
strong Castle, the seat in times past of the
Earls of 
Warwick,
 the Town it self is adorn∣ed
with fair Houses.


COVENTRY.
 It is a City very com∣modiously
Seated, large, sweet and neat, was
fortified with a strong Wall, and is set out
with right goodly Houses; among which
there rise up on high two Churches of rare
Workmanship, standing one hard by the
other, and matched (as it were) as con∣currents;
the one consecrated to the 
Holy
Trinity,
 the other to Saint 
Michael.
 One
and the self same Bishop carried the name
both of 
Coventry
 and 
Lichfield.


Leofrick,
 the first Lord of this City, being
much offended and angry with the Citizens,
oppressed them with most heavy Tributes,
which he would remit upon no other con∣dition,
at the earnest suit of his Wife 
Godina,

unless she would her self ride on Horse∣back
Naked through the Greatest and most
inhabited Street of this City; which she did
indeed, and was covered with her fair
long Hair, and also a Proclamation was pub∣lish'd,
commanding all People to keep close
within their Houses, as also their Doors and
Windows shut, no Person on pain of Death
to appear in that Street, nor so much as to
look into it, whether out of a Window or


otherwise; upon which, as she was riding
along Naked, one Man curious than
Ordinary, ventures to peep out of a Garret
Window, and being immediately discover∣ed,
was Apprehended and Hang'd, as by
the Effigies of a Man, that is continually
kept up as a 
Memorandum,
 in a full proporti∣on,
looking out of a Garret Window, and
called by the Inhabitants, 
Peeping Jack:
 And
thus she did set free her Citizens of 
Coventry

from many Payments for ever.


At 
Gosford
-Gate there hangeth to be seen
a mighty great Shield-bone of a wild Bore,
(or rather of an Elephant, being not so lit∣tle
as a yard in length) which 
Guy
 of 
War∣wick

slew in Hunting, when he had turned
up with his Snout a great Pit or Pond, which
is now called 
Swansewell,
 but 
Swineswell
 in
times past. In this County there are an
Hundred and Fifty Eight Parish Churches.






Worcestershire.


At the first entring on the Confines of this
Shire, we found it a very Healthfull and
plentiful County: One part is of Note for
its excellent Cheese, but mostly for its great
number of Pear-trees growing all along the
very Hedges, of which the Inhabitants make
a very pleasant Drink, called 
Perry;
 'tis
likewise very full of Salt Pits, and hath for∣merly
been admir'd for the abundance of


Salt-Springs, which have very oft been dis∣covered
in this County; but that which
makes it most renowned, is the River 
Se∣vern,

which streams along the County. This,
as also the River 
Avon,
 which comes out
of 
Warwickshire,
 are well replenished with
all sorts of 
Fish,
 but more particularly seem
to have been designed on purpose, as Stews
and Ponds for the preservation of 
Lampreys;

a Fish of great Esteem in that Country, and
sent far and near as a very great present
throughout divers parts of 
England.
 They
are called 
Lampreys,
 from the Latin word

Lampretra,
 as if they had their Denomina∣tion
from licking of Rocks; they are like
Eels, slippery and blackish, however on their
Bellies they are of a blewish Collour; in the
Spring they are most wholesome and sweet,
for in the Summer the part which is to them
instead of a Back-bone, waxeth very hard:
Naturalist observe that these Fish receive and
let in Water at seven Holes, for that they
have no Gills visible at all; the 
Romans
 all∣ways
thought this a very Noble Dish, and
when any Person of Quality desired a Sump∣tuous
Feast, he would be sure to be provi∣ded
with these; and the 
Italians
 at this day
are very much delighted with them, and
upon that Account are very exquisite in their
Dressing of them, and consequently by their
Cookery, make them exceeding delicate to


the taste. The first Town of Note we came
to in this County, was the City of


WORCESTER,
 It is the chief City of
this County, and gives its Name to it; the
River 
Severn,
 which in other parts of the
County runs along in a swift Currant here,
glides more softly with a more gentle Stream,
admiring as it were this City as it passeth
by. It is famous both for its Antiquity and
Beauty, 'tis supposed that the 
Romans
 built
it, at that time when they first planted Ci∣ties
on the 
Eastern
-side of the 
Severn,
 to hin∣der
the Incursion of the 
Britains,
 who were
on the other side, even as they did on the

South
-side of the 
Rhine
 in 
Germany,
 to repress
the 
Germans,
 and keep them within their own
Boundaries. 'Tis situated partly upon the
brow of a Hill, rising with a gentle Ascent,
and hath a very fair Bridge over the River,
and is of great Repute by Reason that the
Citizens are generally great Clothiers. The
Houses are Neat and well Built, the Streets
clean and well Paved, the Churches in Num∣ber
many, in Order and Beauty excellent,
but especially, the Cathedral built many
Hundred Years since; in this Church are
divers small Pillars, all of pure Marble,
which stand in Rows, and do uphold that
vast Bulk and Fabrick, somewhat strange to
see the Body larger then the Supporters,
that so small props should be able to bear


up so great a Weight. This City hath suf∣fered
great Calamities by Fire, having al∣most
been quite Burnt up by the 
Danes
 three
times, and in the Year 1113. by an un∣known
Casualty, and once again in the
Reign of King 
Stephen:
 And, sure I am, 'tis
not long since it fell into the Hands of some
Barbarous and merciless Rebells, who were
as raging as the Flames, and whose Fury
was as unquenchable as the Fire. Witness
the grevious Pressures it groaned under for
its Loyalty, Love and Obedience to the
King in the Year 1651. For here it was,
That after His Majesties long Exile, he a∣rived
with an Army of 
Scots
 and some 
Eng∣lish

the 22
d.
 of 
August,
 and by the Assistance
of the Citizens beat out the Soldiers, who
kept it for the 
Common-wealth,
 and being
Proclaim'd by the Mayor that then was,
and one of the Sheriffs, King of 
England,
Scotland, France,
 and 
Ireland;
 nevertheless
was attended with the same ill Fortune and
Success which had been too long his Atten∣dance.
And having but a small Army in
comparison of the numberless Number of
Rebells that were poured in upon him, was
totally Defeated; in this City several of his
Nobles slain and took Prisoners, the rest
forced to fly for their Lives, and himself
constrained to make his Escape as privately
as he could, and to betake himself into a


Wood in 
Staffordshire,
 where he hiding him∣self
in the Shady Bows of a well spread Oak,
he found more pitty and security from the
Trees and Woods, than from his own un∣natural
and Bloody Subjects; who for the
fear of God by whom Kings Reign, as well
as their Allegiance which they have sworn
to him, ought to have been his continual
Protection and Safe-good: However, 'tis
restor'd again to its Lustre, and like the 
Phe∣nix

is raised again out of the Ashes to its
native Splender and Magnificence, being still
Governed by a Mayor, two Sheriffs, and a
Court of Aldermen, with other Officers fit
to preserve it in that Bravery, to which it
hath now attained. From hence we went
next into.






Herefordshire.


Having sufficiently satisfied our selves with
the Varieties of that City, we came into
the Confines of the 
Eastern
 part of 
Hereford∣shire,

which is very Rocky and Mountain∣ous
at the first; but having passed those
Rocky parts, we began to find the County
more pleasant to the Eye. We discovered it
to be a fertile Soil, the Vallies thick with
Corn, and the Meadows abounding with
Grass, and well watered with Rivers, the
Hills covered with Sheep, and the Hedges
full of Apple-trees, which bear a sort of


Fruit, called 
Red Streaks,
 of which they
make the best Cyder in 
England;
 in a word,
we found it according to the usual report
which is made of it, to yield to no Coun∣ty
in this Nation for three 
W. W. W.
 Wheat,
Wool and Waters, to which formerly might
have been added Wood, but the Iron Works
have destroyed it very much, and made it
now become less plentiful. The first Town
of Note we came to in this County was


LEOMSTER,
 Is a Town of great Re∣quest
in this County, and is of great Anti∣quity:
Some are of an Opinion, that it re∣ceived
its Denomination from 
Linen, Hemp
 or

Flax;
 because, that grows thereabouts in
plenty, but it may be so called from 
Lana,

because it is reported to have the best Wool
known by the Name of 
Leomster Ore,
 and is
said to make the finest Cloth in 
England,

and as its Wool makes the finest Cloth, so
doth its Wheat the purest Bread; and they
say hereabouts, that for 
Leomster
 Bread, and

Weobly
 Beer, none can Compare. Concern∣ing
the Town it is Situated in a pleasant
Valley, and is Governed by a Bayliff and
Aldermen, and is Adorned with a very
handsome Hall, for the dispatching of pub∣lick
Affairs. We went from hence to


HEREFORD,
 The chief City hereof,
is Situated almost in the Middle of the
County, and Watered by two pleasant Ri∣vers



Wye
 and 
Lugg,
 which by their happy
Union not far from this City, advance her
Felicity and enrich her Soil: Antiquaries
are of an Opinion, that this City had its
Rise from 
Ariconium,
 which at this Day hath
no form at all of a Town, as having been
over-turned by an Earthquake, as some do
imagine it to have been in this Place, which
they now call 
Lenchester,
 some three Miles
distant from this City, which they conceive
to be so from the Ruines of old Walls that
are here to be seen, as likewise from four
square Pareing Stones and thick Bricks, as
well as several Roman Coins digged up in
the Earth, though now all grown over with
Trees, Bushes and Brambles: We observed
when we went to Visit this place, we saw
several peices of an old Wall, which do Ar∣gue
the place to continue in it very great re∣mains
of Antiquity; however, her Sister 
He∣reford,

which now is Beautiful by the pains
of others, claims rightly the Pre-eminence
before all other places in this County, wan∣ting
nothing for Pleasure and Profit to make
her Renowned. She is thought first to have
shewn her Head in the time of the 
Saxon,

and it is supposed to have received great
Helps and Increase by Religion, and the
Martyrdom of 
Ethelbert,
 King of the 
East
Angels,
 who when he courted the Daugh∣ter
of 
Offa,
 King of the 
Mercians,
 was trea∣cherously


put to death by 
Quendred, Offa
's
Wife; hereupon, being Registered for a Mar∣tyr,
he had a Church built and dedicated to
him by 
Milsred,
 a petty King of this County,
which after the Establishment of a Bishop's
See, it grew to great Wealth and Honour,
and is thought never to have suffered any
Misfortune until 
Edward the Confesser
's time,
when 
Griffith,
 Prince of 
South Wales,
 and

Algarus
 had raised a Rebellion against King

Edward,
 and led away Captive the Bishop,
Sacked the City, and burnt the Cathedral;
afterwards the 
Normans,
 at the East end of
the Church by the River 
Wye,
 built a strong
Castle, and fortified the City with a Wall,
and by the Trench near the Castle, is a very
fine Spring called St. 
Ethelbert
's 
Well.
 Within
this City are four Parish-Churches, and Bishop

Reinelin,
 in the Reign of King 
Henry
 the
First, founded the Cathedral which now is,
being a beautiful and magnificent Structure,
adorned with divers ancient Monuments of
Bishops and Abbors. The City is governed
by a Mayor, (who is annually Sworn upon

Michaelmas-Day,
 12 Aldermen, a Recorder,
and divers Common-Councel-Men, and by
their Charter have Privileges for particular
Companies and Societies amongst themselves,
who have several distinct Halls and Petty-laws
Enacted, for Regulating and Ordering their
Affairs in Trade. It hath three Markets a-Week,


in which there are plenty of Corn,
and all sorts of Provisions.


About two Miles from this County stands

Rotheram,
 as formerly belonging to the Fami∣ly
of 
Boddenham,
 now in the Possession of
the Family of 
Van Arker,
 and is one of the de∣lightfullest
and sweetest Seats in all the Coun∣ty
having a spacious Park before it, the Ri∣ver

Nye
 behind it, pleasant Meadows on the
one side, and fruitful Tillage on the other;
and having had such great plenty of Apple∣trees
belonging to it, as I have been credi∣bly
informed by those that then knew it,
That take but one Apple from each Tree, it
would make a Hogshead of Cyder.


Concerning some remarkable Things in
this County, 
&c. BONE-well
 near 
Richard
's
Castle, we went to visit, to take some notice
of Nature, who is never more curious than in
her Water-works, presented us with another
new Rarity; a Well called 
Bone-well,
 in the
Water whereof are always bubling up several
little Bones, like Bones of Fishes, and altho'
they which be upon the Surface are, with as
great care as can be, taken off, yet others will
immediately succeed in their room.


HOPTON's-well
 is not far from this, the
Water whereof is found very effectual for
the Curing of several Maladies which have
seized upon Poor, Languishing, Decriped
Mortals; it hath likewise been observed to


by very good for the restoring of Eye-sight
to the Blind, and is also of great use in streng∣thening
the Limbs of weak Persons.


SUTTON WALLS.
 Amongst the
other Varieties we were entertanied with in
this County, there were some Remains of
Antiquity, called 
Sutton walls:
 Near to the
Village of 
Marden,
 are the Ruins of some
antient great Buildings, in all probability,
supposed to be the Mansion-house of 
Offa,

when 
Renchester
 flourished, or, at least, when

Hereford
 was but in its Infancy: This 
Offa

being King of the 
Mercians,
 having invited

Ethelhert,
 King of the 
East-Angles
 into his
Palace under colour and pretence of bestowing
his Daughter upon him in Marriage; by the
Councel of his ambitious Wife (in hopes to
succeed him in his Kingdom,) basely and
treacherously caused his Head to be stricken
off, by one 
Grimbert,
 his Servant, and his
Body being buried on the Banks of the
River 
Lugg,
 was afterwards removed to

Hereford,
 and over it was built a Cathedral
by King 
Milfred,
 which was since dedicated
to St. 
Ethelbert.
 Having sufficiently recrea∣ted
our selves with all the pleasure, pastimes
and rarities in this County, we began to think
to return towards 
London,
 and went from
this City to a place called 
Ross,
 in this County,
a Town noted for its famous Houses of
Slates and Stones, as also for a great number


of Blacksmiths, hammering out their living
upon their Anvells, and when we were
past that Town we soon came into the Con∣fines
of 
Gloucestershire,
 of which hereafter.






Gloucestershire.


Being within the Confines of this County,
we found it most fertile, watered by the
River 
Severn,
 and be-set with Woods and
thick Groves; 'tis happy in the enjoyment
of all things which are necessary for the
Use and Service of Man; the very Hedges
and Land are well stored with Apples and
Pear-trees, and their fragrant blushing Col∣our
invites the wandering Travellers to
refresh himself with their most Wholesome
Juices: And as Concerning this County in
General, the Towns stands thick together
in most parts of this County, and so 'tis
populous; the Houses numerous, and well
built, the Churches fair and handsome
and so 'tis honourable; but that which is
one of the greatest Blessings of all is, the River

Severn;
 there is not any River in all our
Nation for its Channel broader, for a Stream
Swifter, and for Variety of Fish better stock∣ed,
though sometimes it overflows the
Banks, and when it hath roved a great way
it retires back again, as it were, triumphing
over the Conquest of the Land. This River

Severn,
 or 
Sabrina,
 was so called from



Sabenia,
 a fair Lady, concerning whom
there goes this Story; 
Loarnie,
 the eldest
Son of 
Brutus,
 who came first into 
Britain,

took to Wife the Daughter of the Duke of

Cornwall,
 but notwithstanding this he kept
a very beautiful Mistriss, and by her he had
a Daughter, whom he named 
Sabenia;

whereupon he grew so enamoured of her,
that after the Death of his Father-in-law, the
Duke of 
Cornwall,
 he put a way his Lawful-Wife,
and Wedded his Mistriss; his Wife was
so extreamly netled at this, that she imme∣diately
repaired into 
Cornwall,
 and made
her Complaint there amongst her Friends
and Relations, and having gathered a great
Power to revenge her Injury, she fought
with her Husband 
Loarine,
 and Slew him,
and buried him at 
Trynobant,
 or 
London,
 af∣terwards
executed her Revenge still in the
highest Degree: She took the Lady, with
her fair Daughter 
Sabenia
 too, and drown∣ed
them both in this River. The first place
of Note we came to in this County was the
City of


GLOCESTER.
 This City is well sea∣ted,
and as well inhabited, and of a conside∣rable
Trade by reason of the 
Severn,
 which
being Navigable, Boats of great Burden
come up to their Key side loaded with seve∣ral
Commodities. 'Tis governed by a Ma∣yor
and Aldermen, and is adorned with se∣veral


fair Churches, amongst which the Ca∣thedral
is the chief and most glorious, Ere∣cted
by 
Alfred,
 Archbishop of 
York
 and Bi∣shop
of 
Worcester,
 it hath been, by the cha∣rity
of good Benefactors, much enlarged.
King 
Edward
 the Second lies here Interred
under a Monument of Alablaster, and in the
Quire under a wooden painted Tomb lies

Robert,
 the Eldest Son of 
William the Conque∣ror,

who was deprived both of his Life and
Kingdom by his younger Brother. Here is
likewise to be seen the Monument of 
Lucius,

the first 
Christian King
 that ever was in 
Eng∣land,

about the Year 179. The Pillars of this
Church are of an extraordinary thickness,
scarce to be parallel'd in any Church in 
Eng∣land;

but that which makes it more re∣markable,
is a place at the East end of the
Quire called 
The Whispering-place,
 'tis a Pen∣tagone-Arch
in the from of a Semicircle 30
Yards in circuit, and so rare a piece of Art,
That if any Person stands at one end of it,
and whispers never so softly, he that lays
his Ear to the other end will discover distinct∣ly
the Words he speaks. Then next Town
of Note we went to was


TEWKSBURY,
 a Market-Town of
good Note, and of a great Trade for Cloth
and Stockins. 'Tis situated amongst the plea∣sant
Rivers, 
Severn
 on the one side enricheth
it, on the other side 
Avon,
 and another small


River which comes from the East, over each
whereof stands Bridges which give entrance
into it. It hath been counted famous for the
great Battel fought here between the House
of 
York
 and 
Lancaster
 utterly Subverted; In
the Reign of King 
Henry
 the Third, there is
a story of a 
Jew
 that lived in this Town Re∣corded,
That falling into a Jakes, or Privy,
on the Sabbath, or 
Saterday,
 by no means,
for Reverence of that Day, suffer any Help∣ing-hands
to come and pluck him out of
that unpleasant Hole, whereupon the then
Earl of 
Gloucester
 having some Intilligence of
his refractory Sullenness, gave a strick Charge
that no one should dare to take him out on
the 
Sunday,
 for the Reverence of that Day,
and so the poor Circumsized-Wrecth perished
in that most Loathsom Dugeon through his
own folly. This was about the year 1259.
The next place of note we went to was


CICITER,
 which the River 
Ornus,
 or

Churne,
 Rising amongst the Woods near 
Corbe∣ly,

is very commodious for Mills. This Place
doth appear to have been of great Antiquity
and Renown, The 
Brittish
 Chronicles shew
that this Town was burnt, being set on fire
by a Company of Sparrows through an Inven∣tion
devised by on 
Gurmund;
 certain it is,
that the Inhabitans shew a Mount below the
Town which they report this 
Gurmund
 did
cast up, they corruptly call it 
Gurmund
's


Tower. Hear is likewise to be seen some
ruinated Wall of an old Abby; 'tis now beau∣tified
with a very handsome Church having
a high spired Steeple, and a Market once a
week. Many other things are very observe∣able,
which will be too tedious to relate. We
went from hence to


FAIREFORD,
 a place well known
for its curious Church-Windows, in which
are most rarely pourtrayed in Painted-glass,
the whole history of the Bible. From hence
we went into






Oxfordshire.


Which being once entered into, we could
not sufficiently enough admire the pleasant∣ness
of the Soil: There it is that 
Cerces
 be∣stowes
her Gifts most Liberally upon the La∣bours
of Husband-men: There it is that the
Meadowes are garnished with variety of
Plants, allure and intice the industrious and
studious Herbalists into a more strict Inquiry
of Names, Natures and Properties there; 'tis
where the Hills are adorned with shady
Woods, and afford most delightful Bows to
the waried Students, whilst the Silver-stream'd-Rivers
with their Murmures nimbly coursing
along, do whet their fancies, and screw up
their Intellectuals to the highest pitch. The
first Town of Note we came to in this Coun∣ty
was.








Burford.


Is a Town of good Note, situated, as it
were, on the side of a Hill very pleasantly,
and if we will give Credit to ancient Records,
'tis storied, That 
Cuthred,
 King of the 
West
Saxons,
 when he was no longer able to bear
the severe Tributes and Exactions of 
Ethelbeld,

King of the 
Mercians,
 who did most cruelly
oppress him, and began to suck the very
Blood and Marrow of his Subjects, came in∣to
the Field against him, and in a pitcht
Battle routed him totally, taking from him
his Banners on which was painted a golden
Dragon, and so raised his Subjects from their
Tributary-Vassalage. The next place we
came to was.


OXFORD,
 a Ford for Oxen to pass over,
as is called by the 
Germans, Oxhenfurt.
 It
hath a most healthy Air, and commodious
situation, and is well adorned with private
Structures, as also with goodly and magni∣ficent
Colleges and Halls, and is thought,
by Antiquaries, to have been a place of
publick Study before the learned 
Saxon
 King

Alfred
's time, who very much angmented it
out of his Princely Favour and Love to
Learning and Religion. It boasts in 
Unive∣sity-College,

founded, at first, by King 
Alfred,

afterwards re-edified by 
William,
 Arch-Dea∣con
of 
Durham,
 or, as others write, by 
William,



Bishop of 
Durham,
 in the Twelfth Year of

William the Conqueror,
 and of 
New-College,

built by 
William
 of 
Wickham,
 Bishop of 
Win∣chester,

and the Magnificence 
Christ Church,

erected by Cardinal 
Woolsey
 in the Reign of

Henry
 the Eighth. This City is adorned
with 22 Colleges, besides the curious Fab∣rick
of the Schools, and the admirable
Sructure of the Theatre, built at the sole
Cost and Charges of the most Reverend Fa∣ther
in God, 
Gilbert,
 late Lord-Archbishop
of 
Canterbury;
 the famous Library, not much
inferiour to the 
Vatican
 at 
Rome;
 the de∣lightful
Physick-Garden, replenished with
divers both of Foreign and Domestick Plants,
surrounded with a strong stone Wall at the
sole Expence of the Right Honourable 
Henry,

Earl of 
Danby,
 together with all the Cust∣oms,
Privileges, Offices and Dignities, which
are already elegantly set forth by the inge∣nious
Author of the 
Present State of
 England:
And as concerning the South side of this
County, What can be more pleasant than

Thamiss?
 branching it self forth into several
Veins, gives refreshment to several parts of
this County; at last, by several Turnings
and Windings, lodgeth it self again in its
natural Couse. We went from hence to.


DORCHESTER.
 It seems to be a
Town of great Antiquity, and is credibly
reported that this was formerly a Bishop's see,


which was Transplanted from this place to

Lincoln
 by 
William the Conqueror
's dislike, that
the Bishop's Seat stood in so small a City,
from which time it began to decline into a
low and mean Condition, and is now only
famous for its venerable Relicts and Ru∣ins,
and for the mutable Union of the two
noted Rivers 
Tama
 aud 
Isis,
 which here una∣nimously
embrace each other. From hence
we went to 
Hendly,
 in this County, of which
it follows.


HENDLY,
 which the 
Thames,
 after it
hath fetch'd a handsome compass, enricheth
with its silver streams, the Inhabitants here∣in
being most of them Bargemen, and get
good Livelihoods by carrying of Corn and
Wood out of the neighbouring Counties to

London;
 there is now a very large and strong
Timber-bridge over the River, which, they
say, was formerly arched, and of Stone,
but whether this be the Bridge that the 
Ro∣mans

went over, when 
Casar
 pursued the

Britains
 who fled into these Parts, is hard
to determine; however it is very probable
that this was the place. We went from
hence into.






Buckinghamshire, 
or
 Bucks.


Which might possibly be so called from
Beech-trees, there being such great plenty
in that County; or likely from a Country in



Germany
 called 
Buchonia,
 from its great plenty
of those kind of Trees. The County gen∣erally
is of a plentiful Soil, and passing full
of Inhabitants, who chiefly employ them∣selves
in grazing of Cattle. There is store of
Mutton and Beef.


WICKHAM,
 or 
Weicombe,
 situated above
a pleasent Valley, by which runs a-long the
Currant of a small Rivolet, and possibly from
this situation it might take its Name, for

Combe,
 in the 
Saxon
 Language, signifies a

Valley,
 and 
Wick,
 any Turning or Winding
of a River or Sea. 'Tis a Town for Large∣ness
and Buildings not much inferiour to any
throughout the Shire, and hath a Mayor and
Aldermen. It is a place well known for the
abundance of Bone-lace that is made here,
which brings good Advantage and Profit to
the Inhabitants. The next Town we arrived
at was.


BEACONSFIELD,
 a Town better
known for that it was formerly the Inhabi∣tants
by Succession to the Lord 
Scudamore,
 than
for any thing it contains in it self. We tar∣ried
not long here, but went to.


UXBRIDGE,
 formerly called 
WOX∣BRIDGE,

a Town built of latter times, and
well stored with Inns. We past from hence
to see some part of 
Harfordshire
 and 
Bedford∣shire,

which Counties we found very rich in
Corn and Cattle; but in relation to these


Counties, and their renowned Towns of

Bedford, Dunstable,
 and St. 
Albans,
 and divers
other Towns, they having been so well set
forth by others, I shall forbear mentioning
them. We went to.


WARE
 in 
Hartfordshire,
 where we tarried
two Nights. This Town, according to
Writers, was built by 
Edward
 the Second,
King of the 
West Saxons,
 in the Year 914.
'Tis wartered by the River 
Ley,
 and hath a
great Market for all sorts of Grain; it is po∣pulous,
and well Inhabited by Persons of
very good Quality, and lying in the great
Road to 
London,
 is frequented constantly by
Persons of all Degrees; and altho' 
Hartford

be the Eye of the County, 'tis now infe∣riour
to this place; but the most remarkable
thing in 
Ware
 is the 
New-River,
 or Aqueduct,
conveyed above 20 Miles together in a con∣tinued
Channel from this Place to 
Islington,

from whence the Water thereof is dispersed
in Pipes laid a-lond in the ground for that
purpose, into abundance of Streets, Lanes,
Courts and Alleys of this City and Suburbs
of 
London;
 the great Contrivance whereof
all the Citizens have daily Experience, and
ought to immortalize the Name of their In∣ventor
Sir 
Hugh Middleton,
 who bestowed
this most excellent Gift upon them, and
Consummated this good Work so useful and
beneficial to the City at his own proper Cost


and Charges. I have not mention'd the
County of Surrey distinctly as yet, and in∣deed,
had almost forgot it, but I will give
some brief relation of it, tho' not in its pro∣per
place.






Surrey.


From the West it boundeth partly upon

Barkshire
 and 
Hantshire;
 from the South upon

Sussex;
 and from the East on 
Kent;
 towards
the North it is watered with the River 
Thames,

and by it divided from 
Middlesex.


It is a County not very large, yet wealthy
enough, where it beareth upon 
Thames,
 and
lieth as a plain and champion Country.


FERNHAM,
 so named of much Fern
growing in that place.


GUILFORD,
 a Market Town well fre∣quented,
and full of fair Innes.


KINGSTONE,
 a very good Market
Town for the bigness, and well frequented.
It had begining from a little Town more
ancient than it of the same name, in which,
when 
England
 was almost ruinated by the

Danish
 Wars, 
Aethelstan, Edwin
 and 
Ethel∣stred

were crowned Kings upon an open stage
in the Market place, whence it was called

Kingstone.


SHENE,
 so called of its shining bright∣ness,
now 
Richmond,
 wherein the most migh∣ty
Prince, King 
Edward
 the Third, when


he had lived sufficiently both to glory and
nature, died.


King 
Henry
 the Seventh built it, and gave
it that name of 
Richmond,
 of the Title he bore,
being Earl of 
Richmond,
 before he obtain'd the
Crown of 
England.
 He had scarce finished
this new work, when in this place he yeild∣ed
unto Nature, and ended his Life. Here
Queen 
Elizabeth
 also died.


CROIDON,
 there was the Archbishop's
House of 
Canterbury:
 There are Charcoles.


LAMBETH, Canutus,
 the Hardy King
of 
England,
 there amidst his Cups yeilded up
his vital Breath. It is the Palace of the
Archbishop of 
Canterbury.


This County hath in it an hundred and
forty Parish Churches.










I have been both in 
North
 and 
South Wales,

of which other Pens have already set forth, so
that I do not intend to deliver any thing to the
Publick that hath been already set forth by others,
but only give a short Account of several things ve∣ry
observable, not yet set forth by any.






WALES.




Flintshire.


THe Air is healthful, without any Fogs or
Fenny-Vapours, and the People gene∣rally
are very Aged and hearty. The Snow
lies here very long upon the Hills; the Coun∣ty
affords great plenty of Cattel, but they
are small; Millstones are also digged up in
these Parts, as well as in 
Anglesey.
 Towards
the River 
Dee
 the Fields bears, in some pla∣ces,
Barley, in others Wheat, but generally
throughout Rye, with very great encrease,
and especially the first Year of their break∣ing
up their Land, and afterward two or
three Crops together of Oats.






Holy-Well, 
or St.
 Winifrid's-Well.


This County is most remarkable for a lit∣tle
Village called 
Holy-Well,
 where is the
Well of St. 
Winifrid,
 so famous for the strange
Cures which have been wrought by the
Vertue of it, as it is supposed; the Water
hereof is extream cold, and hath likewise
a very great Stream that flows from it, which
is presently able to drive a Mill; the Stones
which are at bottom being of a sanguine co∣lour,
are believed to receive that colour
from the Drops of Blood which trickled


down from her Body, when she was here
beheaded, by the bloody Tyrant that would
have ravished her, and the Moss which grows
upon the sides, and bears a very fragrant
Smell, is averred to have been the product
of her Hair, though I find, by some we
brought away with us, that in process of
time it loseth all its sweetness. Over the
Well stands a Chappel dedicated to her built
of Stone, after a curious manner, to which,
formerly, was much resorting by Pilgrims,
who came hither out of blind Devotion, and
the generality of the Commonalty herea∣bouts
do believe, That this Martyred-Virgin,
and the great Miracle that was wrought by
St. 
Benno,
 who restored her to life again, as
they say, by claping on her head immedi∣ately,
after it was cut off, upon her Shoul∣ders,
which Relation those Inhabitants there∣abouts
do verily believe to be true. So
having made some small stay here, in which
time we conversed with the 
Welshmen,
 and
gathered up a true Account of this County,
which was as follows.






Radnorshire.


In the East and South parts thereof 'tis
more fruitful than the rest, but is uneven
and rough with Mountains, yet it is well
stored with Woods, watered with running
Rivers, and, in some places, with standing


Pools; the Air is very cold and sharp, because
the Snow lying long unmelted under the
shady Hills and hanging Rocks, whereof there
are many, and upon the Borders of it which
lies next to 
Herefordshire,
 runs a-long a famous
Ditch, which 
Offa,
 King of the 
Mercians,
 with
great toil and labour caused to be cast up from

Dee
 mouth to 
Wye
 mouth, for the space of
90 Miles, to separate the 
Britains
 from the

English:
 Several other things there are very
observable, which are too tedious to relate.






Brecknockshire.


Lies beneath 
Radnorshire.
 It is thick with
Hills, and fruitful in the Valleys.


MOUNTH-DENNY,
 three Miles from

Brecknock,
 is a Hill so called, that hath its top
above the Clouds, and if a Cloak, or Hat, or
the like, be thrown from the top of it, it will
never fall, but be blown up again, nor will
any thing descend but Stones or Mettals, or
things as heavy.


LYNSARATHAN-MERE,
 two Miles
East from the same place is a Mere called

Lynsarathan,
 which (as the People dwelling
there say) was once a City, but the whole
City was swallowed up by an Earthquake,
and this Water, or Lake, succeeded in the
place; they say likewise, That at the end of
Winter, when aftr a long Frost, and the Ice
of this Lake breaks, it makes a fearful noise


like Thunder, possibly because the Lake is
encompassed with high steep Hills which pen
in the sound, and multiply it; or else the
ground may be hollow underneath, or near
the Lake.


LIVENNY-River.
 Through this Lake
runs a River called 
Livenny,
 without mixture
of its Waters, as may be perceived both by
the Colour of the Water, and also by the
Quantity of it, because it is no greater after∣wards,
than when it entered the Lake.


CADIER-ARTHUR,
 or 
Arthur's Chair,

a Hill so called on the South side of this Coun∣ty;
from the Tops resembling the form of
a Chair, proportionate to the Demensions of
that great and mighty Person; upon the top
whereof riseth a Spring as deep as a Well,
four square, having no Streams issuing from
it, and yet there are plenty of Trouts to be
found therein.






Glamorganshire.


Hath a temperate Air, and is generally
the most pleasant part of all 
South Wales.


MINYD-MORGAN Hill.
 On the top
of a certain Hill so called, is a Monument
with a strange Character, which the Inhabi∣tants
thereabouts say, if any Man read the
same, he shall die shortly after.




The Springs by 
Newton.

Upon the River 
Ogmore,
 and near to 
New∣ton,

in a sandy Plain, is a Well, the Water
whereof is not very clear, in which, at full
Sea in Summer-time, can hardly any Water
be took up, but at the Ebb it bubbleth up a∣main;
in Summer-time, I say, for in the
Winter the Ebbing and Flowing is nothing
near so evident, because of the Veins of Wa∣ter
coming in by Showers, or otherwise;
besides it is observed, this Spring never riseth
up to the top brink, or over-floweth.


ABERBARRY Cave.
 There is in this
Shire a Cave so called, under the bottom of
a Hill, and on the top of it a gaping Chinck,
where, many times, is heard as it were a
Musical-noise, and sometimes other very
strange Noises, which is very observable for
all Travellers to take notice of.


LANDAFF,
 a small Town, but of good
Repute in that it is a Bishop's See, and ador∣ned
with a Catheral-Church.






Carmardenshire.


A most hilly Country, yet it hath a whol∣some
Air, and though the Soil be not very
fruitful in Corn, 'tis well stored with Cattel,
and in some places yeilds very good Pit-coal
for Fuel: On the South side, the Ocean hath
with so great violence encroached upon the
Land, that the Country seems to have shrunk


back in a fright, and withdrawn it self more
inwardly for security.


The Cave and Well near 
Carreg-Castle.

Near 
Carreg-Castle
 are many Undermines,
or Caves of very great wideness within the
ground, now covered all over with Green-sword
and Turf, wherein, it is probable, the
Multitude unable to bear Arms, when the

Normans
 made their first Incursion into these
Parts, hid themselves during the heat of the
War: There is also a Well that, like the Sea,
Ebbs and Flows twice in 24 hours.






Pembrokeshire.


Hath a good temperate Air, considering
it lies so near to 
Ireland;
 the Inhabitants are
many of them 
Dutchmen,
 but by their Man∣ners
and Language they are much like the

English,
 that upon this Account this County
is called 
Little
 England 
beyond
 Wales.


In the Rocks of this Shire there breeds a
rare kind of Falcon which is thus described,
The Head is flat and low, the Feathers laid
in rows, the Legs pale and wan, the Claws
slender and wide spread, hooked round.


About 300 Years a-go, it was reported,
That for five Generations, the Father of the
Family in the Earldom of 
Pembroke,
 their
Name was 
Hastings,
 never saw his Son.


At the time when 
Henry
 the Second made
his Abode in 
Ireland,
 there were extraordi∣nary


violent and lasting Storms of Wind and
Weather, so that the Sandy-shoar on the
Coasts of this Shire were laid bare to the ve∣ry
hard ground, which had lain hid for ma∣ny
Ages, and by farther search the People
found great Truncks of Trees, which when
they were digged up were apparently lop∣ped,
so that they might see the Stroaks of
the Ax upon them, as if they had been gi∣ven
not long before; the Earth looked very
black, and the Wood of these Truncks alto∣gether
like Ebony, as the Inhabitants infor∣med
us. At the first discovery made of these
Storms, the Trees, we spake of, lay so thick,
that the whole Shoar seemed nothing but a
lopped Grove; from whence may be gathe∣red,
That the Sea hath over-flowed much
Land on this Coast, as it had upon the Shoar
of many Countries bordering upon the Sea.


The 
Salmon's-Leap
 at 
Kilgarran.

About 
Kilgarran
 are abundance of Sal∣mons
taken, and there is a place called 
The
Salmon's-Leap,
 as there is also in other Rivers,
for this reason, The Salmon coveteth to get
into fresh-water Rivers to Spawn, and when
he comes from places where the Water falls
down-right almost perpendicular, as some such
like Places there be, he useth this Policy, He
bends himself backwards, and takes his Tail
in his Mouth, and with all his force unloo∣sing
his Circle, on a sudden with a smart


Let-go, he mounteth up before the Fall of
the Stream; and therefore these down-right
Falls are called 
The Salmon's Leaps.


St. DAVIDS
 is in this County, formerly
an Arch-Bishop's See: There is a Cathedral,
erected in the Time of King 
John,
 and
near unto it stands the Bishop's Palace, and
several other Houses belonging the Bishop's
See, all enclosed round with a Wall, where∣upon
they call it 
The Close.






Cardiganshire.


Being a hilly Mountainous County like the
rest of 
Wales,
 was not formerly planted or
garnished with Towns, but little Cottages, as
may be gathered by that Speech of their
Prince, who being taken Prisoner and carried
to 
Rome,
 after he had throughly viewed the
Magnificence of that City, 
What mean you,

said he, 
when you have such stately Buildings of
your own, to covet our poor small Cottages?


Many other things here might be mentio∣ned
in relation to this County, but I must o∣mit
them by reason I have not room enough.






Montgomeryshire.


In this Shire there is nothing more ob∣servable
than its excellent Breed of Horses,
which (as I have been informed) are of most
excellent Shapes and strong Limbs, and in∣comparable
for Stoutness.




The Hill 
Plim-limmon.

It raiseth it self up to a wonderful height,
and on that part where it boundeth on part
of this Shire it poureth forth the 
Severn,
 the
greatest River in 
Britain
 next the 
Thames,
 as
likewise in the other parts of it riseth the
River 
Wye,
 and the River 
Rideal.


The Hill 
Cerdon.

Upon 
Cerdon
 Hill are placed certain Stones,
in a round Circle like a Coronet, in all pro∣bability,
to commemorate some notable Vi∣ctory:
In this County are several old Castles,
and other things very observable.






Merionethshire.


The Air may be wholsome, but the Soil
is very barren, for 'tis exceeding full of spi∣red
Hills, being the most mountainous place
in 
Wales
 (except 
Caernarvonshire)
 upon which
account it is subject to many and extraordi∣nary
great Winds.


The Pool near 
Bala.

Near 
Bala
 is a great Pool of Water that
drowns, at least, 200 Acres of ground, whose
Nature is such, as they say, That the High∣land
Floods cannot make this Pool swell big∣ger
though never so great; but if the Air
be troubled with violent Tempests of Wind,
it riseth above the Banks: The River 
Dee
 runs
into with a swift Stream, and glides through
it without mixture of Water, for in this Pool


is bred a sort of Fish which are never seen in

Dee,
 and in 
Dee
 River, Salmons are taken
which are never found in this Pool. Upon
the Sea-Coasts of this County, great store of
Herrings are taken at time of Year, and up∣on
the West side of it the Sea beats so sore
and hard, that it is thought it has carried a∣way
part of it.






Caernarvonshire.


In this County the Air is sharp and pier∣cing,
and in it are the highest Hills in 
Wales,

on some of which the Snow lies long, and
on others all the Year long, hard crushed to∣gether.
'Tis affirmed likewise, That on the
high Hills of this Shire are two Meres, one
of which produceth Fish that have but one
Eye, and the other a floating Island: I do
not verifie the truth of this, because I think
it meer Fables.


SNOWDEN-HILLS,
 altho' they have
always Snow lying upon them, yet they are
exceeding rank with Grass, insomuch that
they are become a Proverb amongst the

Welshmen,
 That those Mountains will yeild
sufficient Pasture for all the Cattle in 
Wales,

if they were put upon them together; and 'tis
certain that there are Pools and standing Waters
upon the top of these Mountains, and they
are so coated with a snowy Crust that lies
on them, That if a Man does but lightly set


his foot any where upon the top of them,
he shall perceive the Earth to stir for several
Foot from him, which probably might occa∣sion
the Story of the floating Island before
mentioned.


PEN-NEANMOUR, The great stony
Head,
 a Hill so called in this County. It is
an exceeding high and steep Rock, which
hanging over the Sea when it is Flood, a∣fordeth
a very narrow Way for Passengers,
having on the one side huge Stones over
your heads, as if they were ready to fall up∣on
you, and on the other side the raging
Ocean lying off a wonderful steep depth un∣der
it; but after a Man hath passed over this,
together with 
Pen-mean-Lythan, The less story
Head,
 he shall come to an open broad Plain
that reacheth as far as the 
Conway,
 in which
are bred a sort of Shell-fish, which being
Conceived of an Heavenly-dew, as is con∣jectured,
bring forth Pearl.


BANGOR-PENCHOR,
 so called, is
also in is this County, a Bishop's See; the
Church was Consecrated to 
Daniel,
 Bishop
hereof, but that which is now standing is but
a mean Structure; for 
Owen Glender,
 that
notorious Rebel, who designed to destroy
all the Cities in 
Wales,
 set it on fire, because
the Inhabitants of this Place chose rather to
side with the King of 
England
 than with him:
Hereupon the ancient Church being defaced,



Henry Denry,
 Bishop hereof, did afterwards,
repair it, about the Reign of 
Henry
 the Se∣venth,
as we were credibly inform'd by
the Inhabitants,






Anglesey.


In this Island (which is computed to be
in compass 85 Miles, or thereabout) are
frequently found and digged up in the lower
Grounds, Bodies of huge Trees with their
Roots, and Firr-tres of a wonderful bigness
and length, which Trees, some believe,
were cut down by the 
Romans,
 as the In∣habitants
do say, That when the 
Romans
 had
Conquered this Island, they caused all the
Woods to be cut down and destroyed. This
Island was in time past, full of Woods and
Timber but instead thereof now it yeildeth
plenty of Corn, Sheep and Cattle. The Air
is indifferently healthful in most parts of it;
here are likewise great store of Mill-stones
and Grind-stones, and in some places a sort
of Earth of which they make Allum and
Copperas; also it yeilds such plenty of
Wheat, that it seems to be deserving of the
Title of, 
The Mother of
 Wales.








Denbighshire.


The Air is cold, but very wholsome; the
Snow lies long on the Hills, being a hilly
Country, the high Hills resembling the Bat∣tlements
of Walls.


MOILENLLY-hill
 is the highest Hill in
this Shire, having a Spring of very clear Wa∣ter
upon the top of it.


WREXHAM
 in this County is about 16
Miles from 
Holy-well,
 and is much admired
for its Church-steeple, being a very curious
Fabrick, contrived according to the most ex∣act
Draught and Models of Architecture,
no where to be parallel'd in those parts for
Workmanship, of which taking some small
view, we passed into 
Shropshire,
 of which I
have already made mention.


I having already given a Relation of most
of the Shires in 
Wales,
 and omitted 
Monmouth∣shire,

of which I could not in honour to the
County pass by without a Visit, so staying
at 
Hereford
 some days, we set a-part some
time to go see 
Monmouth,
 of which it follows.






Monmouth.


We found the Ways near 
Monmouth
 hard
and rugged, and that Town to be enviro∣ned
with Hills on all Sides, the Ruins of its
Walls and Castle argue its Antiquity. It
hath a fair Church and Market-place, with


a Hall for the Assizes and Sessions. 'Tis go∣verned
by a Mayor, Recorder and Alder∣men,
and the Inhabitants do generally speak
both the 
Welsh
 and 
English
 Tongue: They
told us there, of great Immunities and Pri∣vileges
granted to them by the House of

Lancaster,
 but for no other thing is it so
much renowned, as that it was first the Na∣tive
place, and gave Breath to 
Henry
 the
Fifth, that Scourge of the 
French,
 and glori∣ous
Pillar of the 
English
 Nation, who Con∣quered

Charles
 the Sixth King of 
France,
 and
all his Army, and made him surrender up
his Crown unto him, and Acknowledge
him the triumphant Conqueror: Here we
were entertained with no other Objects but
what the stony Rocks, the dangerous Clifts,
the towring Mountains, and craggy Preci∣pices
did afford us, being now and then co∣vered
with Flocks of Sheep, and Herds of
Goats; the Inhabitants told us, That upon
the 
Black Mountain
 there, as they call it, or
thereabouts, are some Hills so high, whose
Tops are so sharp, that two Persons may
stand upon two different Points thereof and
discourse with one another, and understand
each other very well, although they must
be forced to go some Miles before they can
embrace each other, but the truth of this I
will not averr; certain I am▪ there are ma∣ny
of them of so unconceivable a height,


and so steep an Ascent, that they seem, as it
were, Nature's Stair-cases, by which we may
climb up to some higher Region, and have
Entercourse with the Inhabitants of the
Moon.


Thus have I given a true and faithful Re∣lation
of my Travels over 
England
 and 
Wales,

but cannot much commend the latter for
their Cookery, yet for their Linen it was in∣different
sweet and clean: I could have men∣tioned
several other things, but what has
been spoke of is most material.


FINIS.
