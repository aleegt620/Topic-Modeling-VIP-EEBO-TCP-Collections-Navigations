CHAP. I.




A RELATION Of the Lord BALTEMORE'S Plantation in 
Maryland.




H
Is most Excellent Majestie Having by His Letters Pa∣tents, under the Great Seale of 
England,
 granted a certaine Countrey in 
Ame∣rica
 (now called 
Maryland,
 in honour of our gratious Queene) unto the Lord 
Bal∣temore,
 with divers Priviledges, and encou∣ragements to all those that should aduenture with his Lordship in the planting of that Cōn∣trey: the benefit and honour of such an action was readily apprehended by divers Gentlemen, of good birth and qualitie, who thereupon re∣solued to aduenture their persons, and a good


part of their fortunes with his Lordship, in the pursuite of so noble and (in all likelihood) so aduantagious an enterprize. His Lordship was at first resolued to goe in person; but the more important reasons perswading his stay at home, hee appointed his brother, Mr. 
Leonard Caluert
 to goe Governour in his stead, with whom he joyned in Commission, Mr. 
Ierome Hawley,
 and Mr. 
Thomas Cornwallis
 (two worthy and able Gentlemen.) These with the other Gentlemen aduenturers, and their seruants, to the number of neere 200. people, imbarked thēselues for the voyage, in the good ship called the 
Arke,
 of 300. tunne & upward, which was attended by his Lordships Pinnace, called the 
Dove,
 of about 50. tunne. And so on Friday, the 22. of 
November,
 1633. a small gale of winde comming gently from the 
North-West,
 they weighed from the 
Cowes
 in the 
Isle
 of 
Wight,
 about ten in the morning; And having stayed by the way Twenty dayes at the 
Barbada's,
 and Fourteene dayes at Saint 
Christophers
 (upon some necessary occasions) they arrived at 
Point Comfort
 in 
Virginia,
 on the foure & twentyeth of 
February
 following. They had Letters from his Majesty, in favor of them, to the Governour of 
Virginia,
 in obedience whereunto, he used them with much courtesie and humanitie. At this time, one Captaine 
Cleyborne
 (one of the Councel of 
Virginia
) com∣ming


from the parts whether they intended to goe, told them that all the Natives were in preparation of defence by reason of a rumor some had raised amongst them, that 6. shippes were to come with many people, who would drive all the inhabitants out of the Countrey.


On the 3. of 
March,
 they left 
Point Comfort,
 & 2. dayes after, they came to 
Patowmeck
 river, which is about 24. leagues distant, there they began to give names to places, and called the 
Southerne
 point of that River, Saint 
Gregories;
 and the 
Northerne
 point, Saint 
Michaels.


They sayled up the River, till they came to 
Heron
 Iland, which is about 14. leagues, and
 there came to an Anchor under an Island neere unto it, which they called S. 
Clements.
 Where they set up a Crosse, and tooke possession of this Countrey for our 
Saviour,
 and for our So∣veraigne Lord the King of 
England.


Heere the Governor thought fit for the ship to stay, vntill hee had discovered more of the Countrey: and so hee tooke two Pinnaces, and
 went up the River some 4. leagues, and landed on the 
South
 side, where he found the 
Indians
 fled for feare, from thence hee sayled some 9. leagues higher to 
Patowmeck
 Towne where the 
Werowance
 being a child, 
Archibau
 his vnckle
 (who governed him and his Countrey for him) gave all the company good wellcome, and one of the company having entered into a little dis∣course


with him, touching the errours of their religion, hee seemed well pleased there∣with; and at his going away, desired him to re∣turne thither againe, saying he should live with him, his men should hunt for him, and hee would divide all with him.


From hence the Governor went to 
Pasehatoway,
 about 20. leagues higher, where he found many 
Indians
 assembled, and heere he met with one Captaine 
Henry Fleete
 an 
English-man,
 who had lived many yeeres among the 
Indians,
 and by that meanes spake the Countrey language very well, and was much esteemed of by the natives. Him our Governour sent a shore to invite the 
Werowance
 to a parley, who thereupon came with him aboard privatly, where he was courte∣ously entertained, and after some parley being demanded by the Governour, whether hee would be content that he and his people should set downe in his Countrey, in case he should find a place conuenient for him, his answere was, 
that he would not bid him goe, neither would & hee bid him stay, but that he might use his owne discretion.


While this 
Werowance
 was aboard, many of his people came to the water side, fearing that he might be surprised, whereupon the 
Wero∣wance
 commanded two 
Indians
 that came with him, to goe on shore, to quit them of this feare, but they answered, they feared they wou'd kill


them; The 
Werowance
 therefore shewed him∣selfe upon the decke, and told them hee was in safety, wherewith they were satisfied.


Whilest the Governour was abroad, the neighbouring 
Indians,
 where the ship lay, be∣gan to cast off feare, and to come to their Court of guard, which they kept night and day upon Saint 
Clements
 Ile, partly to defend their barge, which was brought in pieces out of 
Eng∣land,
 and there made up; and partly to defend their men which were imployed in felling of trees, and cleaving pales for a Palizado, and at last they ventured to come aboard the ship.


The Governour finding it not fit, for many reasons, to seate himselfe as yet so high in the River, resolued to returne backe againe, and to take a more exact view of the lower parts, and so leaving the Ship & Pinnaces there, he tooke his Barge (as most fit to search the Creekes, and small rivers) and was conducted by Cap∣taine 
Fleete
 (who knew well the Countrey) to a River on the North-side of 
Patomeck
 river, within 4. or 5. leagues from the mouth thereof, which they called Saint 
Georges
 River. They went up this river about 4. Leagues, and an∣chored at the Towne of 
Yoacomaco:
 from whence the 
Indians
 of that part of the Coun∣trey, are called the 
Yoacomacoes:


At their comming to this place, the Go∣vernour went on shoare, and treated friendly


with the 
Werowance
 there, and acquainted him with the intent of his comming thither, to which hee made little answere (as it is their manner, to any new or suddaine question) but entertained him, and his company that night in his house, and gave him his owne bed to lie on (which is a matt layd on boords) and the next day, went to shew him the country; and that day being spent in viewing the places about that towne, and the fresh waters, which there are ve∣ry plentifull, and excellent good (but the maine rivers are salt) the Governor determined to make the first Colony there, and so gave or∣der for the Ship and Pinnaces to come thither.


This place he found to be a very commodi∣ous situation for a Towne, in regard the land is good▪ the ayre wholsome and pleasant, the Ri∣ver affords a safe harbour for ships of any bur∣then, and a very bould shoare; fresh water, and wood there is in great plenty, and the place so naturally fortified, as with little difficultie, it will be defended from any enemie.


To make his entry peaceable and safe, hee thought fit to present the 
Werowance
 and the 
Wisoes
 of the Towne with some 
English
 Cloth,
 (such as is used in trade with the 
Indians
) Ax∣es, Howes, and Knives, which they accepted very kindly, and freely gave consent that hee and his company should dwell in one part of their Towne, and reserued the other for them∣selues:


and those 
Indians
 that dwelt in that part of the Towne, which was allotted for the 
English▪
 freely left them their houses, and some corne that they had begun to plant: It was also agreed between them, that at the end of haruest they should leave the whole towne; which they did accordingly: And they made mutuall pro∣mises to each other, to live friendly and peace∣ably together, and if any injury should happen to be done on any part, that satisfaction should be made for the same, and thus upon the 27. day of 
March, Anno Domini,
 1634. the Go∣vernour tooke possession of the place, and na∣med the Towne Saint 
Maries.


There was an occasion that much facilita∣ted their treaty with these 
Indians,
 which was this: The 
Sasquehanocks
 (a warlike people that inhabite betweene 
Chesopeack
 bay, and 
Dela∣ware
 bay) did vsually make warres, and incur∣sions upon the neighbouring 
Indians,
 partly for superiority, partly for to get their Wo∣men, and what other purchase they could meet with, which these 
Indians
 of 
Yocomaco
 fearing, had the yeere before our arivall there, made a resolution, for their safety, to remove them∣selues higher into the Countrey where it was more populous, and many of them were gone thither before the 
English
 arrived.


Three dayes after their comming to 
Yoacoma∣co
 the Arke with the two Pinaces arived there.


The 
Indians
 much wondred to see such ships, and at the thundering of the Ordnance when they came to an Anchor.


The next day they began to prepare for their houses, and first o
 all a Court of Guard, and a Store-house; in the meane time they lay a∣bord the ship: They had not beene there many dayes before 
Sir Iohn Haruie
 the governor of 
V
rginea
 came thither to visit them; Also some Indian 
Werowances,
 and many other Indians f
om severall parts came to see them, amongst others the 
Werowance
 of 
Patuxent
 came to visit the Governour, and being brought into the great Cabin of the ship, was placed betweene the Governour of 
Virginea,
 and the Governour of 
Mary-land;
 and a 
Patuxent
 Indian that came with him, comming into the Cabin, and find∣ing the 
Werowance
 thus sitting betweene the two Governours, started backe, fearing the 
We∣rowance
 was surprised, and was ready to have leapt overboard, and could not be perswaded to come into the Cabin, untill the 
Werowance
 came himselfe unto him; for he remembred how the said 
Werowance
 had formerly beene ta∣ken prisoner by the 
English
 of 
Virginia.


After they had finished the store-house, and unladed the ship, the Governour thought fit to bring the Colours on shore, which were atten∣ded by all the Gentlemen, and the rest of the servants in armes; who received the Colours


with a volley of shot, which was answered by the Ordnance from the ships; At this Cere∣mony were present, the 
Werowances
 of 
Patuxent,
 and 
Yoacomaco,
 with many other Indians; and the 
Werowance
 of 
Patuxent
 hereupon tooke oc∣casion to advise the Indians of 
Yoacomaco
 to be carefull to keepe the league that they had made with the 
English.
 He stayed with them divers dayes, and used many Indian Comple∣ments, and at his departure hee said to the Go∣vernour. 
I loue the 
English
 so well, that if they should goe about to kill me, if I had but so much breath as to speake; I would com∣mand the people, not to revenge my death▪ for I know they would not doe such a thing, except it were through mine owne default.


They brought thither with them some store of Indian Corne, from the 
Barbado's,
 which at their first arivall they began to vse (thinking fit to reserve their English provision of Meale and Oatemeale) and the Indian women seeing their servants to bee unacquainted with the manner of dressing it, would make bread there∣of for them, and teach them how to doe the like: They found also the countrey well stored with Corne (which they bought with truck, such as there is desired, the Natiues having no knowledge of the use of money) whereof they sold them such plenty, as that they sent 1000. bushells of it to 
New-England,
 to provide them


some salt-fish, and other commodities which they wanted.


During the time that the 
Indians
 stai'd by the English at 
Yoacomaco,
 they went dayly to hunt with them for Deere and Turkies, wherof some they gaue them for Presents, and the meaner sort would sell them to them, for knives, beades and the like: Also of Fish, the natives brought them great store, and in all things dealt very friendly with them; their women and children came very frequently amongst them, which was a certaine signe of their confidence of them, it being found by experience, that they never at∣tempt any ill, where the women are, or may be in danger.


Their comming thus to seate upon an Indi∣an Towne, where they found ground cleered to their hands, gave them opportunity (al∣though they came late in the yeere) to plant some Corne, and to make them gardens, which they sowed with English seeds of all sorts, and they prospered exceeding well. They also made what haste they could to finish their houses; but before they could accomplish all these things, one Captaine 
Cleyborne
 (who had a desire to appropriate the trade of those parts unto himselfe) began to cast out words amongst the Indians, saying, That those of 
Yoacomaco
 were 
Spaniards
 and his enemies; and by this meanes endeavoured to alienate the mindes of


the Natives from them, so that they did not re∣ceive them so friendly as formerly they had done. This caused them to lay aside all other workes, and to finish their Fort, which they did within the space of one moneth; where they mounted some Ordnance, and furnished it with some murtherers, and such other meanes of de∣fence as they thought fit for their safeties: which being done, they proceeded with their Houses and finished them, with convenient ac∣commodations belonging thereto: And al∣though they had thus put themselves in safety, yet they ceased not to procure to put these jea∣lousies out of the Natives minds, by treating and vsing them in the most courteous manner they could, and at last prevailed therein, and set∣led a very firme peace and friendship with them. They procured from 
Virginia,
 Hogges, Poultrey, and some Cowes, and some male cat∣tell, which hath given them a foundation for breed and increase; and whoso desires it, may furnish himselfe with store of Cattell from thence, but the hogges and Poultrey are already increased in 
Maryland,
 to a great stocke, suffici∣ent to serve the Colonie very plentifully. They have also set up a Water-mill for the grinding of Corne, adjoyning to the Towne.


Thus within the space of sixe moneths, was laid the foundation of the Colonie in 
Mary∣land;
 and whosoever intends now to goe thi∣ther,


shall finde the way so troden, that hee may proceed with much more ease and confi∣dence then these first adventurers could, who were ignorant both of Place, People, and all things else, and could expect to find nothing but what nature produced: besides, they could not in reason but thinke, the Natives would op∣pose them; whereas now the Countrey is dis∣covered, and friendship with the Natives is as∣sured, houses built, and many other accom∣modations, as Cattell, Hogges, Poultry, Fruits and the like brought thither from 
England, Virginea,
 and other places, which are vsefull, both for profit and Pleasure: and without boa∣sting it may be said, that this Colony hath a∣rived to more in sixe moneths, then 
Virginia
 did in as many yeeres. If any man say, they are beholding to 
Virginea
 for so speedy a supply of many of those things which they of 
Virginia
 were forced to fetch from 
England
 and other remote places, they will confesse it, and ac∣knowledge themselves glad that 
Virginea
 is so neere a neighbour, and that it is so well stored of all necessaries for to make those parts happy, and the people to live as plentifully as in any o∣ther part of the world, only they wish that they would be content their neighbours might live in peace by them, and then no doubt they should find a great comfort each in other.

This Northerne part of Virginia (the limitts whereof extend many degrees farther Southwards) is heere inserted for the better description of the entrance into the Bay of Chesapeack.


















CHAP. II.




A description of the Countrey.




T
He precedent discourse gives you to understand, how the first Colony sate downe in 
Maryland,
 what progresse they made, and in what estate it is at this present: Now my purpose is to speake of the Countrey in generall, that who so lookes that way, may beforehand know something thereof. It is seated betweene the degrees of 38 and 40 of North-Latitude, 
Vir∣ginia
 bounds it on the South, 
New-England
 on the North, and the Ocean on the East, but the Westerne parts are not yet discovered.


The temper of the Ayre is very good, and a∣grees well with the English, as appeared at their first comming thither, when they had no houses to shelter them, and their people were


enforced, not onely to labour in the day, but to watch in their turnes at night, yet had their healths exceeding well: In Summer its hot as in 
Spaine,
 and in Winter there is frost and snow, but it seldome lasts long▪ this last Win∣ter was the coldest that had beene knowne in many yeeres: but the yeere before, there was scarce any signe of Winter, onely that the leaves fell from the trees, in all other things it appeared to be Summer; and yet the last Win∣ter, both their Cattell and Hoggs kept them∣selves in the woods, without any fodder, or o∣ther helpe, and the Hoggs thrived so well, that some of them were killed out of the woods for Porke and Bacon, which was excellent good and fat.


The Windes there are variable; from the South comes Heat, Gusts, and Thunder; from the North, or North-west, cold-weather, and in winter, Frost and Snow; from the East and South-east, Raine.


The ordinary entrance by Sea into this Countrey, is betweene two Capes, which are distant each from other, about 7 or 8 leagves, the South-Cape is called 
Cape-Henry;
 the North, 
Cape-Charles,
 When you are come within the 
Capes,
 you enter into a faire Bay, which is navigable for at least 200 miles, and is called 
Chesopeack
 Bay, and runneth Norther∣ly: Into this Bay fall many goodly navigable


Rivers, the chiefe whereof is 
Patomack,
 where the Colony is now seated. It's navigable for 140 miles, it begins to be fresh about 2 leagves above 
Patomack
 Towne. The next River North∣ward is 
Patuxent,
 which at the entrance is di∣stant from the other, about 20 miles, and is a very pleasant and commodious River; It's fit for habitation, and easie to be defended, by rea∣son of the Ilands, and other places of advantage, that may command it; from thence, untill you come to the head of the Bay, there are no more Rivers that are inhabited: There dwell the 
Sas∣quehanocks▪
 upon a River that is not navigable for our Boates, by reason of Sholes and Rockes; but they passe it in 
 
Canoos;
 At the entrance thereof, there is an Iland which will command that River. Vpon the East side of this Bay lie very many Ilands which are not inhabited, where are store of Deere.


On the Easterne shore of the Country, which lieth upon the maine Ocean, are sundry small Creekes, and one likely to proove a very com∣modious harbour, called 
Matsopongue;
 neere the mouth whereof, lieth an Iland of about 20 miles in length, and thence about 6 leagues more Northerly, another Iland called 
Chingoto;
 and about seaven leagues beyond that, to the North, opens another very large faire Bay, cal∣led 
Delaware
 Bay. This Bay is about 8 leagues wide at the entrance, and into it, there falls a


very faire navigable River.


The Countrey is generally plaine and even, and yet hath some pritty small hills and ri∣sings; It's full of Rivers and Creekes, and hath store of Springs and small Brookes: The Woods for the most part are free from under∣wood, so that a man may travell on horsebacke, almost any-where, or hunt for his recreation.








CHAP. III.




The Commodities which this Countrey affords naturally.




T
His Countrey affords naturally, many excellent things for Phy∣sicke and Surgery, the perfect use of which, the 
English
 can∣not yet learne from the Na∣tives: They have a roote which is an excellent preseruative against Poyson, called by the 
English,
 the 
Snake roote.
 Other herbes and rootes they have, wherewith they cure all manner of woundes; also 
Saxafras,
 Gummes, and 
Balsum.
 An 
Indian
 seeing one of the 
English,
 much troubled with the tooth-ake, fetched of the roote of a tree, and gave the par∣ty some of it to hold in his mouth, and it eased the paine presently. They have other rootes fit for dyes, wherewith they make colours to paint themselues.


The Timber of these parts is very good, and in aboundance, it is usefull for building of hou∣ses, and shippes; the white Oake is good for Pipe-staves, the red Oake for wainescot. There is also Walnut, Cedar, Pine, & Cipresse, Ches∣nut, Elme, Ashe, and Popler, all which are for Building, and Husbandry. Also there are di∣vers sorts of Fruit-trees, as Mulberries, Persi∣mons, with severall other kind of Plummes, and Vines, in great aboundance. The Mast and the Chesnuts, and what rootes they find in the woods, doe feede the Swine very fat, and will breede great store, both for their owne pro∣vision, or for merchandise, and such as is not in∣ferior to the Bacon of 
Westphalia.


Of Strawberries, there is plenty, which are ripe in 
Aprill:
 Mulberries in 
May;
 and Raspi∣ces in 
Iune;
 Maracocks which is somewhat like a Limon, are ripe in 
August.


In the Spring, there are severall sorts of herbes, as Corn-sallet, Violets, Sorrell, Purslaine, all which are very good and wholsome, and by the 
English,
 used for sallets, and in broth.


In the upper parts of the Countrey, there are Bufeloes, Elkes, Lions, Beares, Wolues, and Deare there are great store, in all places that are not too much frequented, as also Beavers, Foxes, Otters, and many other sorts of Beasts.


Of Birds, there is the Eagle, Goshawke, Falcon, Lanner, Sparrow-hawke, and Merlin,


also wild Turkeys in great aboundance, where∣of many weigh 50. pounds, and upwards; and of Partridge plenty: There are likewise sundry sorts of Birds which sing, whereof some are red, some blew, others blacke and yellow, some like our Black-birds, others like Thrushes, but not of the same kind, with many more, for which wee know no names.


In Winter there is great plenty of Swannes, Cranes, Geese, Herons, Ducke, Teale, Widge∣on, Brants, and Pidgeons, with other sorts, whereof there are none in 
England.


The Sea, the Bayes of 
Chesopeack,
 and 
Dela∣ware,
 and generally all the Rivers, doe abound with Fish of severall sorts; for many of them we have no 
English
 names: There are Whales, Sturgeons uery large and good, and in great a∣boundance; Grampuses, Porpuses, Mullets, Ttouts, Soules, Place, Mackerell, Perch, Crabs, Oysters, Cockles, and Mussles; But above all these, the fish that have no English names, are the best except the Sturgeons: There is also a fish like the Thornebacke in 
England,
 which hath a taile a yard long, wherein are sharpe prickles, with which if it strike a man, it will put him to much paine and torment, but it is very good meate: also the Tode-fish, which will swell till it be ready to burst, if it be taken out of the water.


The Mineralls have not yet beene much


searched after, yet there is discovered Iron Oare; and Earth fitt to make Allum, 
Terra lem∣nia,
 and a red soile like Bolearmonicke, with sundry other sorts of Mineralls, which wee have not yet beene able to make any tryall of.


The soile generally is very rich, like that which is about 
Cheesweeke
 neere 
London,
 where it is worth 20. shillings an Acre yeerely to Til∣lage in the Common-fields, and in very many places, you shall have two foote of blacke rich mould, wherein you shall scarce find a stone, it is like a sifted Garden-mould, and is so rich, that if it be not first planted with 
Indian
 corne, 
Tobacco,
 Hempe, or some such thing that may take off the ranknesse thereof, it will not be fit for any 
English
 graine; and under that, there is found good loame, whereof wee have made as good bricke as any in 
England;
 there is great store of Marish ground also, that with good husbandry, will make as rich Medow, as any in the world: There is store of Marle, both blue, and white, and in many places, excellent clay for pots, and tyles; and to conclude, there is nothing that can be reasonably expected in a place lying in the latitude which this doth, but you shall either find it here to grow naturally: or Industry, and good husbandry will pro∣duce it.








CHAP. IIII.




The commodities that may be procured in 
Maryland
 by industry.




H
Ee that well considers the situa∣tion of this Countrey, and findes it placed betweene 
Virginia
 and 
New-England,
 cannot but, by his owne reason, conclude that it must needs participate of the naturall commo∣dities of both places, and be capable of those which industry brings into either, the distan∣ces being so small betweene them: you shall find in the Southerne parts of 
Maryland,
 all that 
Virginia
 hath naturally; and in the Nor∣therne parts, what 
New-England
 produceth; and he that reades Captaine 
Iohn Smith
 shall see at large discoursed what is in 
Virginia,
 and in Ma∣ster 
William Wood,
 who this yeere hath written a


treatise of 
New-England,
 he may know what is there to be expected.




Yet to say something of it in particular.


IN the first place I name Corne, as the thing most necessary to sustaine man; That which the Natives use in the Countrey, makes very good bread, and also a meate which they call 
Omene,
 it's like our 
Furmety,
 and is very savory and wholesome; it will Mault and make good Beere. Also the Natives have a sort of 
Pulse,
 which we call 
Pease
 and 
Beanes,
 that are very good. This Corne yeelds a great increase, so doth the 
Pease
 and 
Beanes:
 One man may in a season, well plant so much as will yeeld a hun∣dred bushells of this Corne, 20 bushells of 
Beanes
 and 
Pease,
 and yet attend a crop of 
To∣bacco:
 which according to the goodnesse of the ground may be more or lesse, but is ordinarily accompted betweene 800 and 1000 pound weight.


They have made tryall of English 
Pease,
 and they grow very well, also 
Musk-mellons, Water∣mellons, Com-cumbers,
 with all sorts of garden Roots and Herbes, as 
Carrots, Parsenips, Turnips, Cabbages Radish▪
 with many more; and in 
Vir∣ginia
 they have sowed English 
Wheate
 and 
Bar∣ley,
 and it yeelds twise as much increase as in 
England;
 and although there be not many that doe apply themselves to plant Gardens and Orchards, yet those that doe it, find much pro∣fit


and pleasure thereby: They have Peares, Ap∣ples, and severall sorts of Plummes, Peaches in abundance, and as good as those of 
Italy;
 so are the Mellons and Pumpions: Apricocks, Figgs and Pomegranates prosper exceedingly; they haue lately planted Orange and Limon trees which thrive very wel: and in fine, there is scarce any fruit that growes in 
England, France, Spaine,
 or 
Italy,
 but hath been tryed there, and prospers well. You may there also have Hemp and Flax, Pitch and Tarre, with little labour; it's apt for Rapeseed, and Annis-seed, Woad, Madder, Saff∣ron, &c. There may be had, Silke-wormes, the Countrey being stored with Mulberries: and the superfluity of wood will produce Potashes.


And for 
Wine,
 there is no doubt but it will be made there in plenty, for the ground doth naturally bring foorth Vines, in such aboun∣dance, that they are as frequent there, as Bram∣bles are here. 
Iron
 may be made there with little charge; Brave ships may be built, without re∣quiring any materialls from other parts: Clab∣board, Wainscott, Pipestaves and Masts for ships the woods will afford plentifully. In fine, 
Butter
 and 
Cheese, Porke
 and 
Bacon,
 to transport to other countrys will be no small commodity, which by industry may be quickly had there in great plenty, &c. And if there were no other staple commodities to be hoped for, but Silke and Linnen (the materialls of which, apparantly will grow there) it were sufficient to enrich the inhabitants.










CHAP. V.




Of the Naturall disposition of the 
Indians
 which Inha∣bite the parts of 
Maryland
 where the 
English
 are sea∣ted: And their manner of living.




H
EE that hath a Curiosity to know all that hath beene obserued of the Customes and manners of the 
Indians,
 may find large discourses thereof in Captaine 
Smiths
 Booke of 
Virginia,
 and Mr. 
Woods
 of 
New-England:
 but he that is desirous to goe to 
Maryland,
 shall heere find enough to informe him of what is necessary for him to know touching them.


By Captaine 
Smith's,
 and many other Relati∣ons you may be informed, that the People are War-licke, and have done much harme to the 
English;
 and thereby are made very terrible. Others say that they are a base and cowardly People, and to be contemned: and it is thought by some who would be esteemed States-men, that the only point of pollicie that the 
English
 can use, is, to destroy the 
Indians,
 or to drive them out of the Countrey, without which, it is not to be hoped that they can be secure. The truth is, if they be injured, they may well be feared, they being People that have able bo∣dies, and generally, taller, and bigger limbed then the 
English,
 and want not courage; but the oddes wee have of them in our weapons, keepes them in awe, otherwise they would not flie from the 
English,
 as they have done in the time of Warres with those of 
Virginia,
 and out of that respect▪ a small number of our men being armed, will aduenture upon a great troope of theirs, and for no other reason, for they are re∣solute and subtile enough: But from hence to conclude, that there can be no safety to live with them, is a very great errour. Experience hath taught us, that by kind and faire usage, the Natives are not onely become peaceable, but also friendly, and have upon all occasions per∣formed as many friendly Offices to the 
English
 in 
Maryland,
 and 
New-England,
 as any neigh∣bour


or friend uses to doe in the most Civill parts of Christendome: Therefore any wise man will hold it a far more just and reasonable way to treat the People of the Countrey well, thereby to induce them to civility, and to teach them the use of husbandry, and Mechanick trades, whereof they are capable, which may in time be very usefull to the 
English;
 and the Planters to keepe themselues strong, and united in Townes, at least for a competent number, and then noe man can reasonably doubt, either sur∣prise, or any other ill dealing from them.


But to proceede, hee that sees them, may know how men lived whilest the world was un∣der the Law of Nature; and as by nature, so a∣mongst them, all men are free, but yet subject to command for the publike defence. Their Government is Monarchicall, he that governes in chiefe, is called the 
Werowance,
 and is assisted by some that consult with him of the common affaires, who are called 
Wisoes:
 They have no Lawes, but the Law of Nature and discretion, by which all things are ruled, onely Custome hath introduced a law for the Succession of the Government, which is this; when a 
Werowance
 dieth▪ his eldest sonne succeeds, and after him the second, and so the rest, each for their▪ liues, and when all the sonnes are dead, then the sons of the 
Werowances
 eldest daughter shall suc∣ceede, and so if he have more daughters; for


they hold, that the issue of the daughters hath more of his blood in them than the issue of his sonnes. The 
Wisoes
 are chosen at the pleasure of the 
Werowance,
 yet commonly they are cho∣sen of the same family, if they be of yeeres ca∣pable: The yong men generally beare a very great respect to the elder.


They have also 
C
ck
r
ses
 that are their Captains in time of war, to whom they are very obedient; But the 
Werowance
 himselfe plants Corne, makes his owne Bow and Arrowes, his Canoo, his Mantle, Shooes, and what ever else belongs unto him, as any other common Indi∣an; and commonly the Commanders are the best and most ingenious and active in all those things which are in esteeme amongst them. The women serve their husbands, make their bread, dresse their meate, such as they kill in hunting, or get by fishing; and if they have more wives then one, as some of them have (but that is not generall) then the best beloved wife performes all the offices of the house, and they take great coment therein. The women also (beside the houshold businesse) use to make Matts, which serve to cover their houses, and for beds; also they make baskets, some of Rushes, others of Silke-grasse, which are very handsom.


The Children live with their Parents; the Boyes untill they come to the full growth of men; (for they reckon not by yeeres, as we doe)


then they are put into the number of Bow-men, and are called Blacke-boyes (and so continue untill they take them wives) When they are to be made Black-boyes, the ancient men that governe the yonger, tell them, That if they will be valiant and obedient to the 
Werowance, Wisos
 and 
C
kc
r
ses,
 then their god will love them, all men will esteeme of them, and they shall kill Deere, and Turkies, catch Fish, and all things shall goe well with them; but if other∣wise, then shall all goe contrary: which perswa∣sion mooves in them an incredible obedience to their commands; If they bid them take fire in their hands or mouthes, they will doe it, or any other desperate thing, although with the appa∣rant danger of their lives.


The women remaine with their Parents un∣till they have husbands, and if the Parents bee dead, then with some other of their friends. If the husband die, he leaves all that he hath to his wife, except his bow and arrowes, and some Beades (which they usually bury with them) and she is to keepe the children untill the sons come to be men, and then they live where they please, for all mens houses are free unto them; and the daughters untill they have husbands. The manner of their marriages is thus; he that would have a wife, treates with the father, or if he be dead, with the friend that takes care of her whom he desires to have to wife, and agrees


with him for a quantity of Beades, or some such other thing which is accepted amongst them; which he is to give for her, and must be payed at the day of their marriage; and then the day be∣ing appointed, all the friends of both parts meet at the mans house that is to have the wife, and each one brings a present of meate and the wo∣man that is to be married also brings her pre∣sent: when the company is all come, the man he sits at the upper end of the house, and the womans friends leade her up, and place her by him, then all the company sit down upon mats, on the ground (as their manner is) and the wo∣man riseth and serves dinner, First to her hus∣band, then to all the company; the rest of the day they spend in singing and dancing (which is not unpleasant) at night the company leaves thē, and cōmonly they live very peaceably and lovingly together; Yet it falls out sometimes, that a man puts away one wife and takes ano∣ther; then she and her children returne to her friends again. They are generally very obedient to their husbands, and you shal seldome heare a woman speake in the presence of her husband, except he aske her some question.


This people live to a great age, which ap∣peares, in that although they marry not so yong as we doe in 
England,
 yet you may see ma∣ny of them great-grandfathers to children of good bignesse; and continue at that age, very


able and strong men: The Men and Women have all blacke haire, which is much bigger and harsher then ours, it is rare to see any of them to waxe gray, although they be very old, but never bauld: It is seldome seene that any of the men have beards, but they weare long locks, which reach to their shoulders, and some of them to their wasts: they are of a comely sta∣ture, well favoured, and excellently well lim∣bed, and seldome any deformed. In their warres, and hunting, they use Bowes and Ar∣rowes (but the Arrowes are not poysoned, as in other places.) The Arrow-heads are made of a Flint-stone, the top of a Deares horne, or some Fish-bone, which they fasten with a sort of glew, which they make. They also use in warres, a short club of a cubite long, which they call a 
Tomahawk.


They live for the most part in Townes, like Countrey Villages in 
England;
 Their houses are made like our Arboures, covered some with matts, others with barke of trees, which defend them from the injury of the weather: The fiers are in the midst of the house, and a hole in the top for the smoake to goe out at. In length, some of them are 30. others 40. some a 100. foote; and in breadth about 12. foote. They have some things amongst them which may well become Christians to imitate, as their temperance in eating and drinking, their


Iustice each to other, for it is never heard of, that those of a Nation will rob or steale one from another; and the 
English
 doe often trust them with truck, to deale for them as factors, and they have performed it very justly: Also they have sent letters by them to 
Virginia,
 and into other parts of the Countrey, unto their seruants that have beene trading abroad, and they have delivered them, and brought backe answere thereof unto those that sent them; Al∣so their conuersation each with other, is peace∣able, and free from all scurrulous words, which may give offence; They are very hospitable to their owne people, and to strangers; they are al∣so of a grave comportment: Some of the Ad∣uenturers at a time, was at one of their feasts, when Two hundred of them did meet together; they eate of but one dish at a meale, and every man, although there be never so many, is serued in a dish by himselfe; their dishes are made of wood, but handsomely wrought: The dinner lasted two houres; and after dinner, they sung and danced about two houres more, in all which time, not one word or action past amongst them that could give the least disturbance to the company; In the most grave assembly, no man can expect to find so much time past with more silence and gravitie: Some 
Indians
 comming on a time to 
Iames Towne
 in 
Virginia,
 it happe∣ned, that there then sate the Councell to heare


causes, and the 
Indians
 seeing such an assembly, asked what it meant? Answere was made, there was held a 
Match-c
mac
 (which the 
Indians
 call their place of Councell) the 
Indian
 reply∣ed, that they all talke at once, but wee doe not so in our 
Match-comac
.


Their attire is decent and modest; about their wasts, they weare a covering of Deares skinnes, which reacheth to their knees, and up∣on their shoulders a large mantle of skinnes, which comes downe to the middle of the legge, and some to the heele; in winter they weare it furred, in summer without; When men hunt they put off their Mantles, so doe the women when they worke, if the weather be hot: The women affect to weare chaines and brace∣lets of beades, some of the better sort of them, weare ropes of Pearle about their necks, and some hanging in their eares, which are of a large sort, but spoyled with burning the Oysters in the fire, and the rude boaring of them. And they and the young men use to paint their fa∣ces with severall colours, but since the 
English
 came thither, those about them have quite left it; and in many things shew a great inclination to conforme themselues to the 
English
 manner of living. The 
werowance
 of 
Paschatoway
 desi∣red the Governor to send him a man that could build him a house like the English, and in sun∣dry respects, commended our manner of living,


as much better then their owne: The 
Werowance
 of 
Patuxent,
 goes frequently in 
English
 Attire, so doth hee of 
Port
back,
 and many others that have bought Clothes of the 
English:
 These 
Werowances
 have made request, that some of their children may be brought up amongst the 
English,
 and every way, shew great demonstra∣tions of friendship, and good affection un∣to them.


These People acknowledge a God, who is
 the giver of al the good things, wherewith their life is maintained; and to him they sacrifice of the first fruits of their Corne, and of that which they get by hunting, and fishing: The sacrifice is performed by an Ancient man, who makes a speech unto their God (not without some∣thing of Barbarisme) which being ended, hee bu
es part of the sacrifice, and then eates of the rest, then the People that are present, eate also, and untill the Ceremony be performed, they will not touch one bit thereof: They hold the Immortalitie of the soule, and that there is a place of Ioy, and another of torment after death, and that those which kill, steale, or lye, shall goe to the place of torment, but those which doe no harme, to the good place; where they shall have all sorts of pleasure.


It happened the last yeere, that some of the 
Sasquehanocks
 and the 
Wicomesses
 (who are ene∣mies) met at the Iland of 
Monop
nson,
 where


Captaine 
Cleyborne
 liveth, they all came to trade, and one of the 
Sasquehanocks
 did an Inju∣ry to a 
Wicomesse,
 whereat some of 
Cleybornes
 people that saw it, did laugh. The 
Wicomesses
 seeing themselues thus injured and despised (as they thought) went away, and lay in ambush for the returne of the 
Sasquehanocks,
 and killed five of them, onely two escaped; and then they returned againe, and killed three of 
Cleybornes
 People, and some of his Cattle; about two moneths after this was done, the 
Wicomesses
 sent a messenger unto his Lordships Governor, to excuse the fact, and to offer satisfaction for the harme that was done to the 
English:
 The 
Wicomesse
 that came with the message, brought in his company an 
Indian,
 of the Towne of 
Pa∣tuxent,
 which is the next neighbouring Towne unto the 
English
 at Saint 
Maries,
 with whom they have good correspondence, and hee spake to the Governour in this manner.


I Am a Native of 
Patuxent,
 as this man (whom you know) can tell you, true it is, I married a wife amongst the 
Wicomesses,
 where I have lived ever since, and they have sent me to tell you, that they are sorry for the harme, which was lately done by some of their people, to the 
English
 at 
Monaponson;
 and hope you will not make the rash act of a few young men, (which was done in heate) a quarrell to their


Nation, who desire to live in peace and love with you, and are ready to make satisfaction for the Injury, desiring to know what will give you content, and that they will returne such things as were then taken from thence; But withall, they desire you not to thinke that they doe this for feare, for they have warres with the 
Sasquehanocks,
 who have by a surprise, lately killed many of their men, but they would not sue to them for peace, intending to revenge the injuries, as they could find opportunitie, yet their desire was to have peace with the 
English.


The Governour returned answere to the 
Wi∣comesse;
 since you acknowledge the Injury, and are sorry for it, and onely desire to know what I expect for satisfaction; I tell you I expect that those men, who have done this out-rage, should be delivered unto me, to doe with them as I shall thinke fit, and likewise that you re∣store all such things as you then tooke from the 
English;
 and withall, charged him with a second Injury attempted upon some of his owne People, since that time, by the 
Wico∣messes.


The 
Wicomesse
 after a little pause, replyed; It is the manner amongst us 
Indians,
 that if any such like accident happen, wee doe redeeme the life of a man that is so slaine, with a 100. armes length of 
Roaroke
 (which is a sort of


Beades that they make, and use for money) and since that you are heere strangers, and come in∣to our Countrey, you should rather conforme your selues to the Customes of our Countrey, then impose yours upon us; But as for the se∣cond matter, I know nothing of it, nor can give any answere thereunto.


The Governour then told him; It seemes you come not sufficiently instructed in the bu∣sinesse which wee have with the 
Wicomesses,
 therefore tell them what I have said; and that I expect a speedy answere; and so dismist him.


It fell in the way of my discourse, to speake of the 
Indian
 money of those parts, It is of two sorts, 
Wompompeag
 and 
Roanoake;
 both of them are made of a Fish-shell, that they gather by the Sea side, 
Wompompeag
 is of the greater sort, and 
Roanoake
 of the lesser, and the 
Wompompeag
 is three times the value of 
Roanoake;
 and these serue as Gold and Siluer doe heere; they barter also one commoditie for another, and are very glad of trafficke and commerce, so farre as to supply their necessities: They shew no great desire of heaping wealth, yet some they will have to be buryed with them; If they were Christians, and would live so free from cove∣tousnesse, and many other vices which abound in Christendome, they would be a brave people.


I therefore conclude, that since God Almigh∣ty hath made this Countrey so large and fruit∣full,


and that the people be such as you have heard them described; It is much more Pru∣dence and Charity, to Civilize, and make them Christians, then to kill, robbe, and hunt them from place to place, as you would doe a wolfe. By reducing of them, God shall be serued, his Majesties Empire enlarged by the addition of many thousand Subjects, as well as of large Territories, our Nation honoured, and the Planters themselues enriched by the trafficke and commerce which may be had with them; and in many other things, they may be usefull, but prejudiciall they cannot be, if it be not through their owne faults, by negligence of for∣tifying themselues, and not conseruing milita∣ry discipline.

CHAP. VII.




Instructions and advertisements, for such as shall intend to goe, or send, to plant in 
Maryland.




T
His Countrey of 
Maryland,
 lieth from 
England
 to the Southwest, about 1200 leagues by Sea: the voyage is sometimes performed thither in 5 or 6 weekes, but or∣dinarily it is two moneths voy∣age, and oftner within that time then beyond it. The returne from thence to 
England,
 is or∣dinarily made in a moneth, and seldome ex∣ceeds sixe weekes.


The best time of the yeere for going thither, is to be there by 
Michaelmas,
 or at furthest by 
Christmas,
 for he that comes by that time shall have time enough to build him a house, and to prepare ground sufficient to plant in the spring following. But there is conveniency of passage thither in most moneths of the yeere; and any one that will send unto M
r
. 
Peasleys,
 or Master 
Morgans
 house, may there be informed of the certaine time when any of his Lordships com∣pany is to goe away, and so save the charge of unnecessary attendance here in 
London.








A particular of such necessary provisions as eve∣ry Adventurer must carry, according to the number of his servants: together with an estimate of their prices.

Beside all their other labours in building, fen∣cing, clearing of ground, raising of Cattell, gardening, &c.


If a mans labour be imployed in Hempe and Flaxe, it will yeeld him as much profit, as 
Tobacco
 at this rate; and so in many other Commodities, whereof this Countrey is ca∣pable.


No man neede to doubt of the vent of these Commodities, for Merchants send shipping to those parts, who will buy off these Commodi∣ties at the aforesaid rates, in as great a quanti∣tie, as they shalbe able to make ready for them; because they yeeld a great encrease of profit in other Countreys, which the Planters them∣selues may make aduantage of to themselues, if they have shipping, and thinke fit to deale in such a kind of trade. As for instance, a 1000. of Pipe-staves, which are rated upon the place at foure pound, being carried to the 
Ca∣naries,
 will yeeld 15. or 20. l. Where likewise, and at the Westerne Islands, the 
Indian
 Corne will yeeld a great increase of benefit. The bene∣fit also which may be raised by trade out of Swine onely, may easily be conceived to be ve∣ry great, seeing they multiplie exceedingly, aske little tendance, and lesse charge of kee∣ping in that Countrey, so abounding with Mast, Chestnuts, &c. For Porke being trans∣ported into 
Spaine,
 or the Westerne Ilands will yeeld about 6. pence a pound, and Bacon, 8. pence. or 9. pence.












A note for the Aduenturers memory, of such things as hee may (if he please) carry with him, either for his owne better accommoda∣tion (on Ship-board, or for some time after his arrivall in
 Maryland) 
or for trade, ac∣cording to his abilitie.






Provision for Ship-board.


FIne Wheate-flower, close and well packed, to make puddings, &c. Clarret-wine burnt. Canary Sacke. Conserues, Marma∣lades, Suckets, and Spices. Sallet Oyle. Prunes to stew. Live Poultry. Rice, Butter, Holland-cheese, or old Cheshire, gammons of Bacon, Porke, dried Neates-tongues▪ Beefe packed up in Vineger, some Weather-sheepe, meats baked in earthen potts, Leggs of Mut∣ton minced, and stewed, and close packed up in tried Sewet, or Butter, in earthen pots: Iuyce of Limons, &c.






Provision for trade in 
Ʋirginia,
 or 
Maryland.


If he be minded to furnish himselfe with


Cattell in 
Virginia,
 his best way is to carry a superfluitie of wollen, or linnen cloth, callicoes, sayes, hatts, shooes, stockings, and all sorts of clothing; of Wine, Sugar, Prunes, Rasins, Currance, Honey, Spice, and Grocery wares, with which hee may procure himselfe cattell there, according to the stocke he dealeth with∣all. About 4. or 5. Pound laid out heere in commodities▪, will there buy a Cow; and be∣tweene 20. and 30. shillings, a breeding Sow. The like Commodities will furnish him either there, or in 
Maryland,
 with Hogges, Poultry, and Corne. Hee may doe well also to carry a superfluity of Knives, Combes, and Bracelets, to trade with the women Natives; and some Hatchets, Howes, and Axes, to trade with the men for Venison, Fish, Turkies, Corne, Fawnes to store a Parke, &c.






Provision for his House.


Iron, and Locks, and Hinges, and bolts; &c. Mustard-seede, Glasse and Leade for his win∣dowes, Mault for beere, a Hogshead of Beefe or Porke: Two or three Firkins of Butter, a hundred or two of old Cheeses; a gallon of ho∣ney, Soape and Candles, Iron wedges, Pookes for Rennet to make cheese: a good 
Mastiffe,
 &c.








Provision for Husbandry.


Seede Wheate, Rie, Barley, and Oates (the best way to preserue it from heating at sea, is to carry it in the eare) Kernells of Peares and Apples (especially of Pepins, Pearemaines, and Dusons) for the making hereafter of Cider, and Perry; the stones and seedes of all those fruits and rootes, and herbes, which he desireth to have. Good store of claver grasse seede, to make good meadow.






Provision for Fishing and Fowling.


Inprimis,
 necessaries for a boate of 3. or 4. Tunne; as Spikes, Nayles, Pitch, Tarre, O∣come, Canuis for a sayle, Ropes, Anchor, Iron for the Ruther: Fishing-lines for Cod and Ma∣crills, &c. Cod-hookes, and Macrill-hookes, a Seane or Basse-net, Herring-netts, Leade, Fowling-pieces of sixe foote; Powder and Shott, and Flint Stones; a good Water-Spaniell, &c.








A direction for choice of seruants.


IN the taking of servants, he may doe well to furnish himselfe with as many as he can, of usefull and necessary Arts: A Carpenter, of all others the most necessary; A Mill-wright, Ship-wright, Boate-wright, Wheele-wright, Brick-maker, Brick-layer, Potter; one that can cleave Lath and Pale, and make Pipe-slaves, &c. A Ioyner, Cooper, Turner, Sawyer, Smith, Cutler, Leather-dresser, Miller, Fisherman, and Gardiner. These will be of most use; but any lusty young able man, that is willing to la∣bour and take paines, although he have no par∣ticular trade, will be beneficiall enough to his Master.


And in case any Adventurer shall be unpro∣vided of such men to supply his number, hee may have directions at the place where these bookes are to bee had, how and where hee may provide himselfe of as many as hee please.






The forme of binding a servant.

 yeeres, in such service and imployment, as he the said 
 or his assignes shall there im∣ploy him, according to the custome of the Countrey in the like kind. In consideration whereof, the said

In witnesse whereof, the said

Sealed and delivered in the presence of H










The usuall terme of binding a servant, is for five yeers; but for any artificer, or one that shall deserve more then ordinary, the Adventurer shall doe well to shorten that time, and adde encouragements of another nature (as he shall see cause) rather then to want such usefull men.




A Forme of a Bill of Lading, to be taken from the Master of the Sip, by every Aduenterer, for the better securing of the transportati∣on of his goods.

 his heires and Assignes, all that part of a 
Penjnsula,

Chesopeack
 on the West, and divided from the other part thereof,


by a right line drawne from the Promontory or Cape of Land called

 (situate in the foresaid Bay, neere the river of

Mary land,
 and so from henceforth will have it called.


AND FORASMVCH as Wee have hereby made, and ordained the foresaid now Lord

circumspection of the said now Lord
 
Baltemore,
 for Vs, Our Heires and Successors▪ doe grant free, full, and absolute power, by vertue of these Presents, to him and his heires, for the good and happy government of the said Province, to ordaine, make, enact, and under his and their seales to publish any Lawes what∣soever, appertaining either unto the publike State of the said Province, or unto the private utility of particular Persons, according unto their best discretions, of and with the aduise assent and approbation of the Free-men of the said Province, or the greater part of them▪ or of their delegates or deputies, whom for the enacting of the said Lawes, when, and as often as neede shall require, We will that the said now Lord

in those parts, so farre as they concerne them, under the paines therein expressed, or to be ex∣pressed: Provided neverthelesse, that the said Lawes be consonant to reason, and be not re∣pugnant or contrary, but as neere as conueni∣ently may be, agreeable to the Lawes, Statutes, Customes, and Rights of this our Kingdome of 
England.


AND FORASMVCH, as in the Govern∣ment of so great a Province, suddaine accidents doe often happen, whereunto it will be neces∣sary to apply a remedy, before the Free-holders of the said Province, their Delegates, or Depu∣ties, can be assembled to the making of Lawes, neither will it be conuenient, that instantly up∣on every such emergent occasion, so great a multitude should be called together: There∣fore for the better government of the said Pro∣vince, Wee will and ordaine, and by these Pre∣sents for Vs, Our Heires, and Successors, doe grant unto the said now Lord

England,
 and so as the said Ordinances be not extended, in any sort to bind, charge, or take away the right or interest of any person, or persons, of, or in their Life, Member, Free-hold, Goods, or Chattells.


FVRTHERMORE, that this new Colony
 may the more happily encrease by the multi∣tude of people resorting thither, and may like∣wise be the more strongly defended from the incursions of Saluages, or other enemies, Py∣rates and Robbers: Therefore Wee, for Vs, Our Heires and Successors, doe give and grant by these Presents, Power, licence, and liberty unto all the liege people, and subjects, both present, and future, of Vs, Our Heires, and Suc∣cessors (excepting those who shall be specially forbidden) to transport themselues and families unto the said Province, with conuenient ship∣ping▪ and fitting provisions, and there to settle themselues, dwell and inhabite, and to build, and fortifie Castles, Forts, and other places of

England,
 and 
Ireland,
 and be in all things held, treated, reputed, and esteemed as the liege faithfull people of Vs, Our Heires, and Successors, borne within Our Kingdome of 
England:
 and likewise any Lands, Tenements, Revenues, Seruices, and other hereditaments whatsoever, within Our Kingdome of 
England,

Our Kingdome of 
England,
 freely, quietly, and peaceably, have and possesse, occupy and enjoy, as Our liege people, borne, or to be borne with∣in Our said Kingdome of 
England,
 without the let, molestation, vexation, trouble, or grievance of Vs, Our Heires and Successors: any Statute, Act, Ordinance, or Provision to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.


AND FVRTHERMORE, That
 Our Subjects may be the rather encouraged to undertake this expedition, with ready and cheerefull minds; KNOW YEE, that We of Our speciall grace, certaine knowledge, and meere motion, doe give and grant, by ver∣tue of these presents, aswell unto the said now Lord 
Baltemore
 and his Heires, as to all o∣ther that shall from time to time repaire unto that province, with a purpose to inhabite there, or to trade with the Natives of the said Pro∣vince, full licence to Lade and Fraight in any Ports whatsoever, of Vs, Our Heires and Suc∣cessors, and into the said Province of 
Mary∣land,

Vs, Our Heires, or Successors, or of any of the officers of Vs, Our Heires, or Successors; (sa∣ving alwayes, to Vs, Our Heires and Succes∣sors, the Impositions, Customes, and other duties and payments for the said Wares and Merchandise) any Statute, Act, Ordinance or other thing whatsoever to the contrary not∣withstanding.


AND because in so remote a Country, and
 situate amongst so many barbarous nations, the incursions aswell of the salvages themselves, as of other enemies, pyrates and robbers, may pro∣bably be feared: Therefore We have given, and for Vs, Our Heires, and Successors, doe give power by these presents, unto the now Lord 
Baltemore,
 his heires and assignes, by them∣selves, or their Captaines, or other their officers, to Leauy, Muster and Traine, all sorts of men, of what condition, or wheresoever borne, in the said Province of 
Mary-land
 for the time being, and to make warre, and to pursue the Enemies and Robbers aforesaid, aswell by sea as by land, yea, even without the limits of the said Pro∣vince, and (by Gods assistance) to vanquish and take them, and being taken, to put them to death by the Law of warre, or to save them at their pleasure, and to doe all and every other thing which unto the charge and office of a Captaine Generall of an Army belongeth, or hath accustomed to belong, as fully and freely,


as any Captaine Generall of an army hath ever had the same.


ALSO, Our Will and Pleasure is, and by
 this Our Charter, We doe give unto the said now Lord 
Baltemore,
 his heires, and assignes, full power, liberty, and authority, in case of Re∣bellion, Tumult, or Sedition, if any should happen (which God forbid) either upon the land within the Province aforesaid, or upon the maine sea, in making a voyage thither, or retur∣ning from thence, by themselues, or their captains, deputies or other officers, to be autho∣rized under their seales for that purpose (to whom we also, for Vs, Our Heires and Succes∣sors, doe give and grant by these presents, full power and authority) to exercise Martiall Law against mutinous and seditious persons of those parts, such as shall refuse to submit them∣selves to his, or their governement, or shall re∣fuse to serve in the warres, or shall flie to the Enemy, or forsake their Ensignes, or be loyte∣rers, or straglers, or otherwise how soever offen∣ding against the Law, Custome, and Discipline military, as freely, and in as ample manner and forme, as any Captaine generall of an army by vertue of his office might, or hath accustomed to use the same.


FVRTHERMORE, That the way to
 honors and dignities, may not seeme to be al∣together precluded and shut up, to men well


borne, and such as shall prepare themselves un∣to this present Plantation, and shall desire to deserve well of Vs, and Our Kingdomes, both in peace and war, in so farre distant and remote a Countrey: Therefore We, for Vs, Our Heires and Successors, doe give free, and absolute pow∣er, unto the said now Lord 
Baltemore,
