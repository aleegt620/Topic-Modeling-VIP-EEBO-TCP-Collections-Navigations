A LETTER from Monsieur 
S. L.
 a 
Polish
 Lord, to Monsieur the Mar∣quess 
C. L.
 In which are manifest∣ly discovered the Practices and se∣cret Intrigues of the 
French
 with the 
Turks
 and 
Hungarian
 Rebels. With some Letters and Remarks upon this Subject.


SIR,


YOU have given me sufficient assu∣rances of the continuance of your Friendship in the Letter I now re∣ceived from you, and by the earnest desire you express of being informed by me of what our Sentiments are in 
Poland,
 concern∣ing the present Troubles in 
Hungary.
 The common report, you say, accuses the French of having raised the War with the 
Turk;
 and making use of 
Poland
 to set its Engines at Work, and put in execution its pernicious Designs. If you are of the same Opinion with our 
Polanders,
 I shall tell you, with my accustomed freedom, that you do not wholly wrong them; For it is true that my

Country-men, for some years past have suf∣fered themselves to be over-reacht by the 
French,
 and that by treating with them too ingenuously, they have insensibly been drawn in to bear a part with them in their evil Practices; and among others, in favour∣ing the Malecontents in 
Hungary.
 They acknowledge at present, though perhaps too late, their Errour, and begin to fear lest they have purchased to themselves Enemies, who after they have filled their own Country with Desolation, their Ambition and Bar∣barity may make them turn their Arms against 
Poland.
 Sir, we love our selves, and our Friendship cannot consist with those Peo∣ples Maximes. Their Politiques appear to us so much the more criminal, because there is no just revenge, but that which ob∣liges us to fight our Enemies with our Arms in our Hands, and openly; nor any so base, as that which makes us use wicked Devises, and execrable Treasons as the Instruments of their Ruine. I have a great esteem for the 
Sarmatians,
 because they had this good Quality, that they never suffered their sus∣pitions to prevail against any Mans credit, and that they chose always rather to judge of others according to their own Inclinations, than upon bare conjectures think them ca∣pable

of Malice. And I beg of you, Sir, to afford me the same Justice, at such time as at the Diet of 
Ratisbonne,
 you unravel 
Pene∣lopes
 weaving, and condemn my Countri∣mens wicked Politicks. I grant you, that the 
Hungarians,
 that by their caballing and Seditiousness have been banished their Coun∣try, have found in 
Poland
 both refuge and Friends to protect them. I easily also acknow∣ledge, that the original of all the Evils you complain of, has its rise from an abuse of the Liberty that we have in 
Germany.
 You may also reckon up so many Factions and Parties, whether in Peace or War, as there are lit∣tle Kings, that in these last Ages have raised themselves to the Royal Authority, and established their Throne in the midst of 
Ger∣many.
 Now after this, you ought not to be surprized to see that our Governours have granted the Favour of Hospitality to those that complained that their Liberty was ta∣ken from them in their Country, and that all Laws were violated to oppress them in the highest degree; since humanity it self, and the right of Neighbourhood could not let them refuse to admit them, till such time as they were reconciled to the Emperour the Sovereign and Master. It may yet be pre∣sumed that the 
French
 protected them,

thinking there was some merit in protect∣ing the Miserable oppressed. I am also of Opinion, that the 
Polanders
 were persuaded to suffer among themselves those that came from 
Hungary
 banished their Country, and deprived of their Goods, upon thoughts of preserving them to the Empire and Christi∣anity; and to the end that their Despair might not oblige them to have recourse to the 
Turk,
 to obtain his Protection. If it was the 
French
 Design in these last Wars of 
Germany
 to draw more business upon the Emperour, and divide his Forces; it ought to be remembred that we are not to mind in an Enemy either craft, or violence. How∣ever, I condemn that way of proceeding, which occasioned them to bear an Enemies Heart in time of Peace; and have a Horrour at their fomenting the troubles of 
Hungary
 with their Forces and Counsel. This Ma∣nagement breaks the most sacred bonds of Friendship and Peace. So have I always, and many others with me, thought it very ill that 
Frenchmen
 should go out of our Coun∣try, as it were out of the 
Trojan Horse,
 to go as Spies into 
Hungary
 and 
Transylvania,
 for to raise Troubles, and encourage the dis∣contented so much the more by giving them Mony and Arms. All 
Europe
 knows how

Bohancy,
 the Head of the Rebels of 
Transylva∣nia,
 with some 
French
 of the same Leven, famous for their Crimes committed in 
Hun∣gary,
 run up and down to raise Seditions, and join themselves to the Rebels. How∣ever, the unviolable observance due to so solemn a Treaty of Peace, made me doubt, whether 
France
 did Authorise this Conduct; and I could no longer fix my Suspicions up∣on the most Christian King, when I reflect∣ed, it has alwayes been fatal to Sovereigns, by many Examples, to reduce Subjects to Revolt, or to maintain or protect them when they have rose against their Lawful Prince. Besides, I was never so bold or rash as to cry down the Glory of Kings and Sovereigns; and I can say, that if Fortune had been an∣swerable to my Government, having never offended any Body in my life, I should be very happy. The most Christian King, by the for∣tunate Success of his Arms, the greatness of his Exploits and Victories, has raised his Glory to so high a Pitch, that he ought on∣ly to use it with moderation, and it is need∣less for him to use unworthy artifices for to make himself more Glorious. Souls truly Royal and Magnanimous, have always de∣spised the Conquests they could more easily obtain by Cunning than by force of Arms.

And it was through this sentiment, worthy a great Heart, that 
Alexander
 the Great sharply rebuked his Favourite 
Parmenio,
 who would have put him upon a crafty De∣sign, saying to him, That it was fit only for Robbers to have recourse to Treachery, as their only means to compass their Thefts. Nevertheless, because the Ministers of Prin∣ces are People more zealous in their Em∣ployments than they should be, and hold that they may lawfully commit all sorts of Injustice for their Sovereign's interest, provi∣ded at the same time they do their business; I thought it might possibly be the same in 
France.
 The better to assure my self in this belief, I would be informed by those Gen∣tlemen, that keep the Bank here of the 
French
 mony (for we never want some 
Po∣landers,
 who had rather live under the 
French
 Slavery, than be satisfied with the liberty of 
Poland
) what great concerns the 
French
 had with the Duke of 
Transylvania, Apafi
us,
 so much constrained to the 
Turks
 Party, what were the Designs and Intenti∣ons, and to what end was so much com∣ing and going of 
Akakia, Du Vernay Boucauld,
 and all the other Expresses.


At last, I found they gave no other Rea∣son, but that the 
French
 were at present in

Possession, and going through all Countrys, that they found every where Friends and Allies; and that they were at last arrived at the time of fulfilling the desire they had long had of seeing themselves Masters of all the World. This is it these 
French
 Prophets boast of, founding their hopes and pretensi∣ons upon this ground, that there is no other way of opposing the House of 
Austria,
 which aspires to the entire Monarchy of all 
Europe,
 but the 
French
 King's entring into a League with the 
Turk,
 and there making an Alli∣ance, and joyning their Forces by vertue of a Treaty, confirmed with an Oath taken upon the Holy 
Evangelists;
 but this you may learn better from the Original; as if it could ever be justifiable to revenge one in∣jury with another wrong done to all Chri∣stendome, and the Destruction of our Holy Mother the Church.


Having asked these French-men, what Prince of the House of 
Austria
 it was that disturbed 
France
 for this 
Ʋniversal Monarchy,
 they knew not which to name; this makes me believe, that those who judge of the pre∣sent by what is past, will without doubt say that the French and Turks have long ago agreed; and that the French Ambassador at 
Constantinople
 has no greater business with the

Ottoman
 Port, than to instruct him about the Emperors Negotiations in 
Hungary,
 as a Famous 
Venetian
 said before me, and that the secret intention of the French, is to draw the War into those Provinces of the King∣dom of 
Hungary,
 that remain as yet undivi∣ded; to extend, when they shall think fit, their Dominions on the other side, through the Ruin of Nations, and Destruction of Christians.


However, the French Party every where exclaim, and ask, what advantage can the loss of 
Hungary
 produce to 
LEWIS THE GREAT?
 They say on the contrary, the King endeavours to preserve it in its obedi∣ence to the Emperour, and that his Majesty has given sufficient Testimony of it to the chiefest Princes in 
Europe;
 when 
Luxemburg,
 being attacked on all sides, and ready to Sur∣render, he left the Conquest of that impor∣tant Town, to which he has a just Claim, as soon as he knew that they were inform∣ed at 
Vienna,
 by an extraordinary Courtier, that the Turk was bringing all his Forces against the Empire, and had ordered his Army to March towards 
Belgrade,
 with a Design to Invade in this War all 
Hungary,
 and the Neighbouring Provinces to 
Austria.
 That the most Christian King had given a

signal demonstration of his Piety, in not hindring, as very advantagiously he could, the Emperour, and the rest whom the same misfortune threatned, from turn∣ing all their force upon the Enemy, and in withdrawing his Troops that were in 
Flan∣ders
 and upon the 
Rhine.
 We all admired, and highly extolled a Conduct so Glorious, so Pious, and so worthy a great Monarch, that would at so high a Rate purchase the peace and quiet of Christendom; and with∣out doubt the French that had come after∣wards, had received sincere Praises, if the thing had really been, or but always appear∣ed the same they represented it to us, but, praised be God, the Truth did not always lye hid under the specious pretences with which it was covered.


I pass by all examples of past ages, and only say, that after their actions in these latter times, there is no more doubt to be made of their sinister dealings. And to be fully satisfied in this point, it is only ne∣cessary to hear those that are best instruct∣ed in the causes of this rumour which I spread abroad. They say, that all their exactness in discovering of News has not been able to inform them that any acci∣dent had happened which should give occa∣sion

to the 
Turk
 to make a War either in 
Asia,
 or 
Greece, Thessaly,
 or any of his re∣mote Provinces; that nevertheless at the same time they have seen in several Letters of the 
French
 Emissaries, which were disper∣sed in 
Constantinople, Transylvania
 and 
Hun∣gary;
 how that last year, on the 30th of 
De∣cember,
 the War was resolved upon and sworn to against the Emperour, in the Pa∣lace of 
Constantinople,
 and in the Holy Council, which the 
Turks
 call 
Divan,
 in which the Muphti, High Priest of the 
Ma∣hometan
 Religion presided. Which suffi∣ciently lays open the Authors and Procurers of this War; and clearly shews us that the 
French
 were not ashamed, as if it had been a famous action in them, to take advice in the 
Divan,
 and applaud the success of the Negotiations, as they did in their Letters writ backwards and forwards to the Rebels, in which they congratulated with them for having drawn the 
Turk
 to succour them. They promise each other in their Letters all the advantages they can expect, which aim at no less than to have the Emperour driven out of his best Estates, and the 
Turk
 advance into 
Christendom,
 bestowing Crowns on the one side, and rewards on the other, ac∣cording as every one shall have laboured with him for the freeing of 
Hungary.




I lay not the stress of this upon any false rumour that has run among the People; I have assured and convincing testimonies of it; and the Persons from whom I take it, deserve we should make it a point of Con∣science faithfully to believe them.


Sir, if you suspended as yet your judge∣ment upon the 
French,
 on account of what I have told you; and if you should as yet persist in your belief, that the 
Polanders
 have had a hand in all this with the 
French;
 I would desire you to examine with that justice, which in you is usual, whether what I have related unto you is not sufficient to raise all your suspicions.


There is no body but knows that in last years assembly, our illustrious 
Hungarians
 loudly proclaimed, that such of their Coun∣try-men, as have been forced to retire to other Places, lived only upon such supplies of Mony, as they received from the 
French;
 that they would not make their Peace with the Emperor, whose Clemency extended but just so far as to offer it, and that they were resolved to prosecute their enterprize, upon assurance of the Promises that were made them. So afterwards 
Akakia
 renewed and confirmed more powerfully than ever the League and Alliance with the Malecon∣tents

of 
Transilvania.
 We also saw the 
French
 Emissaries without any shame of violating the Law of Nations, and in Countries of the solemn Treaty of Peace; though they had been manifestly discovered in a secret Con∣spiracy, run on afterwards more then ever, with an unparallelled Impudence, as if all things had been lawful to them.


You that know me, may well imagine what a trouble it was to me, to see that 
Po∣land,
 my Country, should be the Theatre where all these Villanies were acted, and not one 
Polander
 to be found who might unde∣ceive the World.


Yet the Emperor, with his ordinary Mer∣cy, suffered the Malecontents of 
Hungary
 to pass the next Water with as much quiet and security as they would desire, to the end to draw them by this affectionate con∣duct to lay down Arms, return to their Du∣ty, and live peaceably in their Country un∣der obedience; and I thought they would then for ever have left their Rebellion, if the Artifices of the French had permitted them to take good counsel.


We have been inform'd, how 100000 Florins were ordered at 
Paris
 to foment the Discontent of the Rebels in 
Hungary,
 and quicken the 
Turks
 the more; How this Sum

was delivered at 
Dantzick,
 the Metropolis of Royal 
Prussia,
 and put into the Hands of a Banker, whose Name is 
Fromontius,
 who afterwards delivered it to the French Emissa∣ries, at several payments, the better to hide the business. Moreover, we knew, how the 
Sieur du Vernay Boucauld,
 Count 
Teckely
's real Spy, caused to be delivered into the hands of the Sieur 
Valentin Nemessan,
 11300 Ducats, to oblige the Malecontents to take Arms again, and attack the Cittadel of 
Zat∣mar,
 after the French fashion, with gilt Ar∣rows, I mean, to endeavour to gain the Ga∣rison, or Citizens, with money.


You knew, Sir, that in 
Poland,
 we highly disapproved of this Conduct, which was not totally unknown. The Principal Officers of our Court, before the whole Court, repre∣sented to the most Christian King's Ambas∣sadour, that we would no longer allow of such things. We told them, that by order of the whole Senate, we forbid the French to act, as we understood they lately had done, upon pain of our King's displeasure. 
Monsieur de Vitry
 endeavoured to excuse him∣self, he produced his Book, assuring us, that we should not find in all his Accounts that the Malecontents in 
Hungary
 had touched the money we spoke of, and which was all

delivered by his Order. Thus it is that De∣ceit and Craft hide the Truth under false pretences.


Notwithstanding you must know, that the French Money went into 
Hungary,
 and men have been employed on purpose to stop it; and even the very Women have not been ignorant of the Wiles and Practises of the French.


The Princess 
Radrivilliana,
 Widow to the Prince of that name, expresly forbid the suf∣fering any French to pass through her Coun∣try of 
Sacolia,
 bordering upon 
Transylvania,
 fearing lest they should, as in other places, corrupt the People with mony. Nevertheless the French, whether it was that they would venture all, or whether they thought they were sufficiently disguised not to be known, took their Journey through this Princess's hereditary Country, and one that was taken was carried to her Castle, whom she impri∣soned, loaded with Irons, and afterwards caused to be severely punished. The Mar∣quess 
De Vitri,
 as well as all the Court, saw this man run backwards and forwards, be∣ing obliged to take another way. This ge∣nerous Princess's Example may convince the World that there were those in 
Poland,
 who condemned the abominable practises of the French.




All the world would have thought, that after this the 
Sieur du Vernay
 and all his un∣der Spies would have grown circumspect by the punishment of their Companion, or that at least they would have learnt to conceal themselves better. But on the contrary, they made it appear by their new behavi∣our, that when once a man has gone be∣yond the bounds of Honour he is fit for any thing. These Gentlemen, the Masters of Perfidiousness, perceived, that they had no fairer a convenience for to entertain a commerce with the French Ambassadour at 
Constantinople,
 the Turks, and Malecontents in 
Hungary,
 than that which they found on the borders of 
Poland.
 They always had cor∣respondence, and had as often as they could private enterviews with the Sieurs 
Valentin Nemessan, Peter Iagel,
 and other particular Friends and Allies of 
Teckely.
 They more∣over endeavoured to have still more and more frequent Conferences in 
Transilvania,
 sending first one and then another to 
Paris,
 with the necessary Instructions of all their Proceedings.


So the Emperour's Ambassadour at this Court, who had notice of all, desired our most Serene King of 
Poland,
 that his Majesty would be pleased to give order, that no

French-man, not being an Ambassadour, or bearing some other Employment, should be allowed to stay in his Dominions. He added to his Entreaty the humble Remonstrance, that the ancient Treaties so often renewed between the Empire and 
Poland,
 required it for the publick Peace, neither did he omit what he had understood concerning the Be∣haviour of the French in 
Hungary
 and 
Con∣stantinople.
 This occasioned that the most Christian King's Embassador was advertized by his Majesty of 
Poland,
 to order 
Akakia
 and 
Du Vernay
 to withdraw. At the same time he received a severe Animadversion about those Peoples Behaviour. The Senate told him, that we were no longer upon terms of conniving, since we had been informed, that the French more and more stirted up the Troubles of 
Hungary,
 to draw on a War with the 
Turk;
 that we knew from good hands what Mony they had given for it, what Ca∣bals they had had, and the Sieur 
Du Vernay
 kept every day. We declared that Man was a Spy, and a turbulent Person, who had no other business to detain him about 
Leopol,
 but only to treat with the 
Turks
 and Male∣contents, about the means and entring into a League together, for to draw the War in∣to 
Hungary;
 that therefore we earnestly de∣sired

he would cause him to retire. The Ambassador answered, that he would not do what we demanded; he loudly declared, that Monsieur 
Du Vernay
 was sent with him into 
Poland,
 to manage the Affairs of the most Christian King their Master. He presumed very confidently to deny, that neither the Sieur 
Du Vernay,
 nor he, had any commerce with the 
Hungarians,
 or 
Turks;
 on the con∣trary, he said, that the French King, in lea∣ving 
Luxemburg,
 had sufficiently testified how earnestly he desired the Peace of Christen∣dom, much less to give an occasion of sus∣pecting the French of any sinister Design. He promised however, to take away, as he said, all Suspitions, that the Sieur 
Du Vernay
 should go to 
Varovia,
 and that there he should execute his most Christian Majesties com∣mands. However, the Sieur 
Du Vernay,
 upon the news of all these Accusations, had re∣tired to a Convent of Schismatick Monks of the order of St. 
Basil.
 And this did not put an end to these Practices, so unworthy the name of Christianity.


Some time after, the Emperours Ambassa∣dour discovered that new sums of Mony were come to 
Dantzick
 for the French. This and many other things which he understood at the same time, obliged him to renew his Pray∣ers

to his Majesty of 
Poland.
 He had Audi∣ence in the Presence of the Marquess 
De Vi∣try,
 the French Embassador, and before the whole Senate. He spoke a long time, and all his Speech consisted of Complaints against the Sieur 
Du Vernay.
 He said, he had only changed the Place, and not his way of Pro∣ceeding, and still daily continued his Crafts in 
Poland.
 He produced a Paper he had recei∣ved by the last Post; by which he was given to understand, that the remainder of the Mony the French had engaged for to the Rebels, by the agreement made between them of one hundred thousand Florins, was lately delivered at 
Dantzick.
 He ended, be∣seeching his Majesty of 
Poland,
 to be plea∣sed now at last to purge his Dominions of those dangerous and seditious Men, who by all means fomented the Troubles of 
Hungary.
 He said, the Miseries of 
Hungary
 would reach 
Poland,
 since the Toleration they had, ten∣ded to the Violation of the Treaty of Peace, till now always inviolably observed. He pro∣tested, if we gave not satisfaction to his de∣mands, he should be obliged to publish in all Princes Courts, and would make known to all 
Europe,
 that the French, by their abo∣minable Methods and Practises, are the Au∣thors of the Troubles of 
Hungary
 and 
Tran∣silvania,


and cause of the 
Turkish
 War. That they have sacrificed to their hatred, and en∣vy against the House of 
Austria,
 the best purchased Provinces of the Empire, in which they have exercised their Treacheries and Treasons. That they have done all this to make good their ground in the Provinces they have torn from the Empire, and which they cannot retain by any other lawful right. In a word, that their aim in all these Proceed∣ings is only to renew the Treaty of Peace, up∣on pretence that we have broke it, to the end they may the better retain their Usur∣pations, and have an occasion of seizing what is left of the Empire.


This Speech was convincing, and we could do no less than to press anew the 
French
 Embassadour to oblige the Sieur 
de Vernay
 to depart 
Poland:
 We told him from the King and Senate, that we would no longer be satisfied with the vain pre∣tences he alledged to detain him. Then Monsieur the Marquis 
de Vitry
 declared, (which he durst not do the last time) that Monsieur 
Du Ʋernay Boucauld,
 was joint Embassadour with him from the 
French
 King. He came thus far to save him by the quality of Embassadour, sheltering him under the Law of Nations.




This Declaration stopt our 
Polander
's mouths; they thought no more of demand∣ing the departure of him that was the real Author of the Rebellion of 
Hungary;
 and they spoke not the least word to put a stop to his licentiousness by a just advice: On the contrary, they promised the Embassa∣dour, that the Sieur 
Du Vernay,
 his pre∣tended Companion, should have all liberty to act for his Master.


This soft and complying behaviour of the 
Polanders
 cannot be better excused, than by saying, that without doubt they remembred upon this occasion, that the 
French
 of late years, make no greater com∣plaint, than when their Embassadours or Agents, that have liberty in all Countries, are touched, though never so slightly.


(These are the words of 
Charles Pascal,
 a 
French-man,
 in his Treatise he made of Embassies.) "And they do like the Wolfs, who draw the Sheep far from the Shepherd, that they may afterwards devour them. In fine, it is upon these frivolous accusations, that the 
French,
 to have some pretence for making War, have at other times so loud∣ly complained, and not long since, against 
Germany,
 saying, They observed not the law of Nations, and broke the most sacred

bonds of Humanity, and the Peace to∣wards their Embassadors. Yet at the same time, they passed by and endured, with∣out one word speaking, the horrid injuries and most barbarous usage their Embassa∣dours received at the 
Ottoman
 Port.


I must needs tell you here, Sir, that if you wonder that we suffer the 
French
 Emis∣saries in 
Poland,
 under the pretended qua∣lity of an Embassadour; we have much more reason to admire in 
Poland
 that the 
French
 are received in the principal Courts in 
Germany
 with great kindness and satisfa∣ction, notwithstanding there is so much reason to mistrust their intentions.


This makes me think, dear Sir, that even at this day we might see the observance of the Laws, the love of your Country, the love and respect due to the Emperour, in which you were so exact the last age, sub∣sist amongst you, if the French had not been the first in changing this good order, by conjuring with the 
Turks.
 Then, 'tis true, a Law made in a Diet was publish∣ed in 
Germany;
 by which all sort of com∣merce with the 
Turks,
 and the 
French,
 their Confederates, was forbidden through the whole Empire; to hinder the sprouting of the seeds of Division and Rebellion,

which that perfidious Nation casss where∣ever it is admitted. Since no 
French
 Em∣bassadour was admitted in any one Court in 
Germany,
 so little did they trust the 
French;
 and scarce would the Princes of the Empire receive Letters from that Coun∣try. Now things are much changed, and we may well cry, when we see the present miseries of 
Germany, O tempora! O mores!


Yet all the World has not the same opi∣nion of the French. But to convince you, I will give you an example so much the more to be imitated, because it would be extremely advantagious to 
Germany,
 if the same were done there. It happened in 
Po∣land,
 The Castellan of 
Primislau,
 percei∣ving that neither his Majesty of 
Poland,
 nor the Senate expelled the French Spies, and moreover that their designs always suc∣ceeded better and better, and that they were going to destroy, by the 
Turkish
 War they were drawing on, a million of innocent Christians, refused to permit the Sieur 
Du Vernay
 to enter his Village of 
Nimirovia,
 and assembled a number of men to oblige him to pass another way; so much did he fear this man, of whom he had heard so many things.




There wanted not for great complaints. The Marquis 
de Vitry
 was highly incensed, and sought all ways of revenge. And as he is the Most Christian King's Embassa∣dour, went directly to Court, to lay before his Majesty of 
Poland,
 after his own fashion, the affront and indignity offered, contrary to the Law of Nations, to his Companion, the Sieur 
du Vernay;
 and was so bold as to demand that the Castellan should be impri∣soned for satisfaction. The King could not endure this confidence, and told him very harshly, That it was to no purpose to couch the Sieur 
du Vernay
 under the quality of Ambassadour, that the Tragedies he acted under the vain pretence of an Embassy were well known; that all the devices of the French, and their contracts with the Turk were discovered; that the places where 
Akakia
 and 
du Vernay
 had Conferences were named; their resolutions and designs known; that we could exactly tell how much Mo∣ney was sent from 
France
 to 
Hungary;
 and how they had used violence, deceit, and wicked practices against the Emperour, to the misfortune of Christendom.


The Ambassadour would have cleared himself of those things, with which, he said, we wrongfully charged his Nation. He

thought there was no body could convict the French of their actions in this Country. But the King, who grew hot, would not hear him. He only told him, he would lay 10000 Pistols with him, that we would prove un∣deniably all that he had said:


I tell you nothing here, Sir, but what I have seen and heard, and if you had been present, you would have thought with me, you had heard 
Cicero
 speak in the Roman Senate, instead of the King of 
Poland, How long,
 Catiline, 
will you abuse our patience? How long shall your fury sport at us? to what end will your impudence come? are you igno∣rant that all your Designs are known to us? don't you perceive that all my Citizens are con∣vinced of the Conspiracy you carry on with the Malecontents of
 Hungary 
and the
 Turks?


The Marquess 
de Vitry
 pressed no farther for the liberty of the French Agents. He did not, like 
Catiline,
 pray we should not enter∣tain those thoughts of him and his, which no Body believ'd; that when 
Hungary
 were lost, we should have need of the French. He look∣ed like one astonished at this blow. He stood amazed, and his silence sufficiently confirm∣ed the thing. All the other French that were present, in a consternation, fixed their Eyes upon the ground, and lifted them not up but

to look upon each other, as it were accusing themselves. So certain it is, that the inward sting of Conscience, and the secret power of Truth, dashes the most fierce and confident, and by reducing the guilty to a shameful si∣lence, forces them to make some sort of con∣fession of their Crimes.


Sir, Here you have a very acceptable Hi∣story to tell such of your Countrymen as can well praise all the French actions, whether good or bad. Next, you may ask them, whether they expect a good Peace with the French, because they so highly extoll the advantages and pleasures of Peace.


If the Ghost of the Emperour 
Tiberius
 should come from Hell, and appear in you assembly of the States of the Empire, how justly would he blame you, and say, 
O men, born to slavery! will your softness extend so far as not to believe, but that we only imagine what is done openly in sight of the whole world, which we see, and even feel.
 This I say, because I know there are some amongst you, that suf∣ficiently mistrust the French, to know what they are to think of them, whether they suspect them for not observing the Peace, or for entring into a League with the 
Turks.


But I also believe, which is much better, that there are many 
Germans,
 who will talk

boldly of taking away the snares that are laid for them, and endeavouring to defend the liberty of their Country. I still remember what I saw in 
Germany
 when I travelled in it. At least I doubt not, but that if you would Unite your selves to re-establish the glory of 
Germany,
 and retain the valour of your Ancestors, you might live at home like Kings, and laugh at those who have made themselves slaves to 
France.


But what side must be taken in so great a diversity of Opinions, and among so many occasions of fear on both sides. My opinion is little to the purpose, but if you will believe me, you would judge, that you have most reason to fear what threatens you from the East, than from any other place. For what can you expect from a War with the 
Turk
 but the total ruin of your Goods, and utter destruction of your Countrey. There is an end of your Liberty, your Religion, your Life, and all you can lose in this World.


So that since you have still time to con∣sider what you are to do, imagine some∣times your Churches, your Houses, your Wives, your Children and your Country, comming to you and conjuring by all they have deserved from you, that you will not leave them as a prey to your common Ene∣mies,

and to prevent the Miseries of a cruel slavery that threatens their Liberty.


If you will say that 
Hercules
 himself wont encounter two; that therefore you must treat with the French at any rate. You may still think, if you please, that the Kingdom of 
Hungary
 is of far greater value and conse∣quence, as being the bulwark of Christen∣dom, than the City of 
Strasburg.
 That at present you must behave your self like a prudent Pilot in a Storm, who choses rather to cast his Merchandise into the Sea, than venture losing all, by endeavouring to preserve all. But I must also tell you, that you have reason to fear, lest under those beautiful Leaves, a Snake lyes hid. You must believe the French have stirred up the 
Turks.
 And these shall no sooner have entred 
Au∣stria,
 besieged 
Vienna,
 as without doubt they will besiege it, destroyed all the Country round it; and finally reduced 
Germany
 to the last Extremities; but the French, invited by your Prayers, will voluntarily come of∣fer you their Service. But instead of Wa∣ter to quench the Fire, they will bring Oyl to make it the fiercer.


Sir, I shall not say many other things that I think about this matter. I only add, that methinks I see a History, almost the same

with that we read of a Roman Emperor, who had a Fancy to set on fire the four cor∣ners of 
Rome
 for the Pleasure, as he said, of seeing a Fire equal to that of 
Troy;
 and thereby to have an occasion of doing good to the miserable Citizens, who would come to complain of their Miseries and Misfor∣tunes. Perhaps 
Nero,
 in this cruel Scene, de∣sired nothing but the Glory of building a new City, and calling it by his own Name.


If you believe me, endeavour above all things to take away the Snares that are laid for you. The French King, as all other Christian Princes, is obliged to defend you against the 
Turks;
 and you will have so lit∣tle trouble in obtaining of it, that he has al∣ready agreed upon it with your Enemy. But what will be the event? You will infal∣libly come to complain of one another, be∣cause some will be contented, and others dis∣satisfied; Whilst you are taken up in these Disputes, the French will do their Work, and at last you will find your selves under their Dominion, cast down, conquered and made Slaves without daring to say so.


Do not then stay to dispute Rights and Interests, till the time when the noise of Arms and the fury of War will hinder you from hearing the Law. Be the 
Horatii,


and not the 
Curatii
 of your Country. In fine, remember that the members separated from the Head languish away like Carcasses. Be faithful to your Soveraign, the Empe∣rour, your lawful Prince: He has ascended the Throne by a right owned by all the World; he has always upheld himself with Glory; you are used to obey him, and he always applied himself to your preservation. You ought to pay him all sorts of respect, if you expect in him a Protector and Father, and if you fear drawing the wrath of Hea∣ven on your heads. What light would the Planets have if they darkned the Sun? If you prefer the Moon hid under the 
Flower∣de-Luces
 before the Sun at which your 
Eagle
 looks; if you had rather be slaves to the 
French
 King, than obey the Emperour, all things will happen worse and worse to you; and you will draw all the Cruelty of the Barbarians on you, as a punishment of your Perjury and breach of Faith.


You are not ignorant of the reproach that we cast upon you, 
viz.
 that the 
Ger∣mans
 are the only people that desire to be subject to a Foreign Government, and have no love for their Country. That reproach cannot justly be retorted upon us; and 
Ger∣many
 shall ever find in the 
Polanders
 all sort

of friendship and service. We foresee the dangers that threaten us, and seeing of it, our Fore-fathers example, our promised Faith, and our natural inclination, stir us up powerfully to the defence of our Coun∣trey.


Sir, I know, that to make you sensible of all that my Friendship and sincerity has made me say, I need only represent it to you. It only remains that I desire you to tell me your Opinion with the same free∣dom, that I may be delivered from the dis∣quietness the sight of the present Evils, and the fear of those that threaten us, has put me into. It is time you should read the pieces I send you. Farewel.

FINIS.








The Speech of
 Monsieur Zerowiski, 
the Emperour's Embassadour in
 Poland. 
Spoken in the Royal Palace before his Majesty of
 Poland, 
and in the Pre∣sence of the Princes, Noblemen, and Embassadors at that Court; at
 Ta∣voravia, 
the
 6th 
of
 October, 1682.


Most Great King,


AMongst other Books, I have hit upon that of the Life and Exploits of Cardinal 
Commendon
 who was sent to this Court by the 
Pope,
 with the Quality of extraordinary 
Legate,
 in the Em∣pire of 
Sigismond,
 and Reign of 
Henry de Va∣lois:
 I have observed in it, that it was that Cardinal's Maxim, Never to answer but with an affected Silence and Contempt, to all that his Enemies could do or say against him. Without doubt, in his time, the state of Affairs, the Customs and Spirits were very different from what they now are; at least, a long experience has made me judge them very different; and I know I cannot, without great disadvantage, conceal or connive at a thing that very much troubles me. I have understood that the French King's Ministers, published some dayes ago, certain Letters, which brought, as it were, assured Testi∣monies, that His Imperial Majesties Envoy's only Busi∣ness with the 
Ottoman
 Court was to endeavour, by all possible means, to turn the 
Turkish
 Armies against 
Poland.


There is no Body but sees, and your Majesty must needs perceive, how injurious this is to the Empire; and to what end it is done. They give this out to dis∣unite Two Kingdoms; both which, at this present Con∣juncture of Affairs, have their chief Interest in being firm∣ly

united. But the Letters took not so great an effect as they expected. The Spirits of this Court, were not so credulous as to believe them. They are too well satis∣fied in 
Poland,
 of the Piety and Affection of those of the House of 
Austria;
 to think that the Emperor, my Ma∣ster, gives his Embassadors such base and unworthy Com∣missions. There is no Body here that can doubt that his Imperial Majesty, would be as sensible of the loss of 
Poland
 as of 
Hungary,
 since it is as much his Interest to preserve the one as the other.


I come not hither, great King, to tell you what through my Aversion, I could publish upon little Rumours that have been spread among us; I bring your Majesty those things, which I can beyond all dispute, produce before the whole World, as the true Originals of Letters and Answers, which the most Christian King's Embassador, Monsieur 
Du Vernay Boucauld,
 who is here present, has writ to Count 
Tekely,
 the Head of the 
Malecontents,
 or received from him. These will evidently discover to your Majesty, what Affairs Mounsieur 
Du Vernay
 has Treated about, with so much secresie and circumspecti∣on with Count 
Tekely;
 and the reason he had so cauti∣ously to conceal from you the Commission he had in this Kingdom.


I humbly intreat your Majesty to remember how ear∣nestly I intreated you, to remove the Sieur 
Du Vernay
 from your Court and Dominions, as a man pernicious to the Empire, and 
Poland.
 You would have, Great King, invincible Proofs and Testimonies of what I rela∣ted; Here they are, such as you will wish for, and I am persuaded they will be sufficient to make you judge the speedy departure of Monsieur 
Du Vernay,
 out of your Kingdom, very necessary. But I fear, troubling your Ma∣jesty with a long Discourse; I pass by a thousand things which I could add; this Memorial is enough, To you I present it with all imaginable respect.








A 
Memorial
 presented to the King of 
Poland,
 by Monsieur 
Zero∣wisky,
 the Emperour's Resident.


Which was read in the presence of his Majesty of 
Poland,
 and before the Princes and Mi∣nisters of his Court; at 
Tavoravia,
 the 6th of 
October, 1682.


SInce the last 
Memerial
 which I had the Honour to present to your Majesty, I have endeavoured, ac∣cording to the Advice of the Illustrious Lords of the Senate, to furnish my self with some piece that might evidently shew what Correspondence the 
French
 King's Agents have in your Kingdom with Count 
Tekely,
 Head of the Malecontents in 
Hungary.
 These wanted also to inform you, what Bargains and Agreements passed be∣tween them, which, as I said, tend to the breaking off the Peace and Treaties, that are between your Majesty and the Emperor, my Master. You could not easily be informed of it from any but my self. I know the 
French
 King's Ministers daily assur'd your Majesty, that they had a Hand in no such thing; and that we accu∣sed them falsely. And the French would no longer be suspected to have any ill Design against the Empire, after the Declaration the French King had made, at the rai∣sing the Bloccade of 
Luxemburg.
 His most Christian Majesty would inform all 
Europe,
 how he behaved him∣self in that occasion; and they were careful to carry his Declaration to all the Courts of the chief Christian Princes. The French King plausibly declares, that having been informed of the Designs which are carrying

on in the 
Fast
 against the Empire, he would put nothing in Execution which might hinder his Imperial Majesty, and the most August House of 
Austria,
 from opposing the 
Turks
 with all their Forces, and providing for the com∣mon good of Christendom.


This could by no means allow your Majesty to believe, that the 
French
 were in League with the Maltcontents and 
Turks;
 and that they contributed to the taking and plundering the Towns of 
Hungary;
 for that appeared to be quite contrary to such fair Declarations: But God, the Defender and Revenger of Christians, has ordered those things to fall into my hands, which I lay at the foot of your Majesties Throne; and which I lay before the Eyes of the whole World. These are the Sieur 
Da Vernay
's Letters, and Correspondence with Count 
Tekeley;
 which you will find diametrically opposite to those Declarations, so worthy the Piety and Genero∣sity of the most Christian King.


I have made use of no evil practice for the obtaining these Letters: I have not, though I could have done it, so much as employed any Body to observe the 
French.
 And to tell you all, I got these Letters by the means of the Steward of the most Illustrious Lord 
Stadnick
's Estate. The Sieur 
Du Vernay,
 after having long im∣portuned the Monks of a Monastery of St. 
Basil,
 went also to importune the Steward, who is 
Castellan
 at 
Pre∣mislaw.
 So much he did, that he stirred up the Gen∣tlemans Anger against himself, and so consequently he became my Friend, and has ever since been very favour∣able to my Intentions. This 
Castellan,
 some dayes ago, stopt certain 
Hungarians
 coming back from 
Nimiravia,
 whither they went to see the Sieur 
Du Vernay;
 immedi∣ately he ordered them to be brought to me, with the Letters he sound about them. I presently took care to convey them to the Emperour, my Master's Territories; sending at the same time the Letters, to the end that all the World might judge, whether I had not just cause to

suspect, that the Sieur 
Du Vernay
 exceeded his Master's orders.


Certainly, this Agent, this Minister, this Spy, this Ambassador, I know not what to call him, but I mean Monsienr 
Du Vernay,
 has committed a great outrage against all Christendom. Against the Emperor, in fo∣menting and contriving what he has against him. Against your Majesty, in entertaining a Commerce so unworthy, so pernicious, and for so long a time, without your know∣ledge, and in your Kingdom, as if he had been at home. I must add, for the Interest of your Kingdom, that this Conduct has given the World occasion to believe, that the 
Polanders
 were blind enough, not to see the dangers their Neighbours made them fear, and that they would themselves drive the Poniard to their own Breast, in permitting the Sieur 
Du Vernay
 to live amongst them. His proceeding will, without doubt, appear very in∣jurious to the French King; for that Posterity may judge and believe, that the great King, 
Lewis
 the XIV, Authorized or commanded, what the Sieur 
Du Vernay,
 his Agent did in his Name.


Your Majesty will not take it ill, that we have disco∣vered to the Assemblies at 
Francfort
 and 
Ratisbonne,
 the Famous Exploits of the French, with the Turks and Rebels of 
Hungary,
 in your Kingdom, which for so ma∣ny Ages has been closely united with the August-House of 
Austria;
 and has alwayes acknowledged its own Inte∣rest, to preserve 
Hungary
 to the Empire, thinking it im∣possible for 
Peland
 to subsist if 
Hungary
 shall sall.


It is now a year, that the Sieur 
Du Vernay
 travels up and down several Parts of your Maiestjes Dominions, on the Borders of 
Hungary.
 He always pretends his Masters, as if we could see that 
Dantzick
 or 
Rogioment,
 which are the Places the French come through, were not nearer and more proper to receive what Orders the French King would send. But he stays there to observe the nearer the Affairs of 
Hungary:
 It may be also, to

be in a better condition to go give Count 
Tekeley
 joy, and to get the reputation with him, of the Progress the Turks, by his means, might make in that Country.


I desire your Majesty, that after you have seen the Memorial I present; and after you are convinced of all the Arts the French have used in this Kingdom, you will be pleased to order the Sieur 
Da Vernay
 to depart your Dominions, since he abuses his Employments to the prejudice of all Christendom; and renders himself unworthy the Protection the Law of Nations allows.


You may do it so much the more justly, great King, because the Roman Catholick Church, your Mother, esteems them as Excommunicated Persons, who side with Infidels, whether it be carrying them Arms, or treating with them.


The Sieur 
Du Vernay
 has drawn this upon his own head, and if he is punished according to his deserts, the most Christian King will banish him his Kingdom, for ex∣ceeding his Orders, and engaging his Master's Honour and Reputation. In fine, he has committed his Villa∣nies in the French King's Name, and broke his Master's word; acting in all things contrary to the observance of it, which if it should fail in the World, could be no where found but in the Mouth of a King or Prince.


I doubt not, great King, but all my pressing, reite∣rated and just instances, will at last take effect. The Al∣liances and Treaties that are between this Kingdom and the Empire, require it from your Majesty. And I also, with a most profound respect, beg to be admitted to the honour of some part of your Affections,








A
 Letter 
from Monsieur
 Du Vernay, 
to Count
 Emery Tekeley.


My Lord,


I Received with great joy the Letters, you did me the honour to write to me, from the Camp before 
Fil∣leck,
 enclosed in the Pacquets of our Ambassadors at 
Constantinople;
 nevertheless, I was a little surprized, that you should seal them before he had seen them. I wonder also, you said nothing about the Siege of 
Filleck.
 However, I doubt not but that place, by this time, is in your power. Monsieur 
Jaygel,
 I believe, knows by my last Letters, that I have several times endeavoured to send him what I promised, and let him have what I have received, but I always wanted an opportunity. When you send any of your People to me, order them not to come to my House but at Night, to the end we may do our business without any bodies knowledge. But what I most earnesty desire is, that above all things, they take care not to follow the Road that goes directly from 
Tavoravia
 to 
Nimirovia.
 For here are several Po∣lish Gentlemen, who, by the most Serene King of 
Po∣land
's Order, search, visit, and detain all strangers that pass. The safest way, in my Opinion is, that they leave 
Premislaw
 and 
Toreslavia
 on the right hand, and follow the Road that leads to 
Sandomiria,
 lest they be seen to enter 
Nimirovia,
 where I am surrounded with Spyes. I recommend the enclosed to you; and desire you to send them according to their Directions, by the first opportunity. I will take the same care in all things, you shall be pleased to command me. I am most cordi∣ally,


Sir,
 
Your most zealous Servant,
 Du Vernay Boucauld.


Nimirovia,
 
Sept.
 the 22d. 1682.


 The Superscription was thus: 
To the most Illustrious Lord, Count
 Emery Tekeley, 
Lord of
 Kesmark 
and
 Arve, 
Gene∣ral of the
 Hungarian 
Army, that sights for its Country.






The Audience being ended, His Majesty of 
Poland
 said, he was convinced of the French Correspon∣dence with the Malecontents. He shew'd himself very angry that the thing had been conceal'd from him. Next day some of the chief Officers of his Court, had Order to go and command the Sieur 
Du Vernay
 imme∣diately to depart the Kingdom. He said, he would obey his Majesties Order; but that he earnesty desired those Gentlemen to give him some dayes, that he might take the Coach of 
Transilvania.
 On the other side, the Em∣peror's Resident used all diligence, and with great suc∣cess; for Monsieur 
Du Vernay
's Letter-carrier, called, 
Kelemeschi,
 returned to 
Nimirovia
 before his departure. This Courrier came with those whom 
Tekeley
 sent to the Sicur 
Du Vernay,
 with his Letters; and those of his great Agent and Confident 
Jaygel.
 These Courriers were sei∣zed, and the Letters they had intercepted. These Let∣ters were partly writ in Cyphers. Here you will find them set down word for word.




A Letter from 
Count Tekeley,
 to Monsieur 
Du Vernay.


SIR,


I Doubt not, but you have made much of Monsieur 
Valentine Nemessani,
 my Envoy. He has alwayes been faithful to me, and very true to my Interest. The Recommendations you gave him touching the Affairs he

communicated with you; will, without doubt, be of great Importance to him, with the Most Christian King. I am beholding to you for all you have done for him, and shall acknowledge it, as occasion serves: It is time I should inform you, of the present state of my Affairs. After I had taken 
Cassovia,
 and entered some Forts about it, I went with the Vizier of 
Budas
 Troops, to attack the Famous Fort of 
Filleck:
 The Inhabitants re∣fused, at first, to put themselves under my Protection; but after a fortnights Siege, they came to beg I would admit them to Capitulate; I granted them what they asked; which was, that the Garrison, and what other Prople there was, should go out, carrying with them as much as they could upon their Backs: Then I raised the Fort, in sight of the Imperial Army, which was hard by in the Mountains. As I am now informed, it is marched away: and having sacked the Town of 
Vieuxsols,
 and other places, retires very hastily. I design to follow the Imperialists, and drive them far off, to restore my Country to its former Liberty. At length the Emperor will be forced to yield by Force, what we beg as a Favour. Heaven has commiserated my Fortune indeed somewhat late; but I also hope, it will draw on a greater and more speedy Vengeance. Sir, I will take care to inform you of all my other Affairs; however I desire you alwayes to stand my Friend. I am


At the Camp before
 Filleck, 
Sept.
 18, 1682.


SIR,
 
Alwayes ready to serve you,
 EMERY TEKELEY.


The Superscription was: 
To the Most Illustrious Lord, Monsieur
 Du Vernay Boucauld 
Ambassador Extraordinary from the French King.








A
 Letter 
from Monsieur
 Peter Jaigel, 
Gover∣nour of
 Cassovia: 
To Monsieur
 Du Vernay.


SIR,


LAst Wednesday we took and raised 
Filleck:
 where above a thousand 
Janizaries
 were slain. After∣wards, the Vizier made all the 
Hungarians
 that were present, and were under the Prince of 
Transilvania
's Dominion, be brought before our Illustrious 
Count;
 then all the Estates of the upper 
Hungary
 being assembled, Monsieur 
Tekeler
 was proclaimed King, and confirmed in that Quality by the Great Turk, who sent him from the Port, a Hat instead of a Crown, with a Standard, and Scepter. After the Ceremony, the 
Count
 very modestly refused the Title of King: He is satisfied with that of Prince Regent of 
Hungary:
 His Titles are, 
Eme∣ricus Thokolius Princeps, ac partium Regni Hungariae Do∣minus,
 &c. After this Election, the Vizier gave him the best Troops, to pursue at the Head of the Army, those of the Imperialists. 
Caprara
 having deserted the Moun∣tains, pillaged the Towns, and abandoned the Forts 
Vi∣gles
 and 
Zolian,
 is at last retired, and has taken his way towards 
Threnezin.
 Sir, we had done something more, but we have not received what you promised us, and without that supply, we are forced to proceed gently in our Business. Monsieur 
Nemessani
 is gone to treat of Affairs at the French King's Court. He needs your In∣structions; we have ordered him in all things, to act to your Honour. We will very suddenly send you an Express; I beg of you for God's sake, make him up as large a Sum as you can. I alwayes remain, as I ought,


SIR,
 
Your most obliged Servant, 
PETER JAIGEL.


Cassovia,
 
Sept.
 22d. 1682.


 The Subscription was: 
To the most Illustrious Lord, Monsieur
 Du Vernay Boucauld, 
Ambassador Extraordi∣nary from the French King.






After the Emperour's Resident had the second time produced these Letters, and the dayes appointed were expired, his Majesty of 
Poland
 sent word to the Marquess 
de Vitry,
 the French Ambassador in 
Poland,
 to cause the Sieur 
Du Vernay,
 immediately to retire; that he was weary of hearing daily of his new Designs. Without doubt, he has obeyed this Order of the King of 
Poland.


It was thought convenient to put in the Letters here, in the same manner as they were writ, and this to satis∣fie such Persons as are not content without the Original.

Du Vernay.


Illustrissime Domine, mihi observantissime.


NUllus ambigo, quin Illustriss. Dominatio Vestra Ablegatum meum, Egregium 
Valentinum Nemessani,
 pro sincero ejusdem hactenus semper declarato erga me affectu & candore, favorabiliter prosecura fit, 
& negotio∣rum, medio ipsius coram declaratorum, cur sui, multum ef∣fficaci suae recommendatione, apud Christianissimum Gallia∣rum Regem pondus addiderit:
 quo nomine obligatum me ad reciprocationem paralis dexteritatis Illustriss. Domi∣nationi Vestrae exhibendae, declaro porro quam rerum faciem progressumque res meae habuerint hujusque Illu∣striss. Dominationi Vestrae pro debito necessitudinis mu∣tuae rescribendum censui. Nempe occupata 
Cassovia,
 & Arcibus quamplurimis jugum subire coactis, 
Budensi Vizirio
 copiisque Turcicis auxiliaribus 
Filekinum
 Forta∣litium alias famoscum, nolens protectioni meae sese sub∣dere, post obsidionem spatio duarum hebdomadarum toleratam, ad conditiones pacis acceptandas, supplici∣tur provolvi (Praesidiariis & cuncta plebe eo coacta, cum farcinulis, quas quivis humeris suis sustentare effereque poterat, libere dimissis) compulsum, & consequenter di∣rutum est, Germano milite in proximo circa montanas oberrante, & haec conniventibus oculis intuente, qui im∣par viribus ad resistendum, se ex montanis civitatibus (uti rumor est recenter allatus) proripuit, & expilata civitate 
vetero-Soliensi,
 aliisque locis, regressum praecipi∣tare dicitur, quocum fortunae aleam subire animus est, nec praetermittitur occasio eundem prorlingandi, Patriam∣que hanc in tranquillum statum pristinae libertatis repo∣nendi, ut quae Caesar suppliciter rogatus remittere noluit, inventus cedere cogatur, Nemesi Divina sortis meae mise∣rata sero quidem, et eo gravius ultionis poenas repeten∣te.

Quid post hac rerum gerendarum occurrerit genui∣ne Illustriss. Dominationem Vestram informare haud praetermittam. Me de caetero benevolentiae ejusdem re∣commendans, maneo.

Illustrissime Domine mihi colendissime,


Praeterito die Mercurii, occupato & deleto Fortali∣tio 
Filleek,
 ubi plusquam mille Jenizzarones peri∣erunt, post hac primum omnibus Hungaris, qui penes Principem Transylvaniae fuerant, ad Dominum Comi∣tem per Vezirum pulsis, cum summa solemnitate, prae∣sentibus Comitatibus; & universis Statibus Regni Hun∣gariae Superioris est in Regem electus, & a Turca con∣firmatus, elevatusque Princeps Comes, cui a Porta pile∣us, loco Coronae oblatus, item Vexillum & Sceptrum: qui finita electione, recusavit se uti titulo Regis, sed ti∣tulo Principis, cujus titulus est talis: 
Emericus Thokoli Princeps, ac Partium Regni Hungariae Dominus, &c.
 Fini∣tis

his, selectam militiam Vezirus dedit Domino Comiti ut fugientem Exercitum Germanicum prosequeretur Princeps noster.
