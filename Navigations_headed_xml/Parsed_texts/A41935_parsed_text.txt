GREAT NEWS FROM THE Polish Camp, and the Terms upon which his 
Most Christian Majesty
 proffers to make a Peace with the Republique of GENOA.


From the 
Polish Camp
 at 
Soochin,
 
the 2d. of 
October.
 1684.


THe Rain hath continued here, for four Weeks toge∣ther, which hath so swelled the 
Neister,
 that notwith∣standing all Endeavours, it hath ruined our Bridge, so that only a part of our Army got over.


The Rains have so far incommoded us, that we as well as our Horses stand in Mud, and want forrage.


We also, are not freed from an Invasion of the 
Tartars,
 for they in a great Body having already past the River, and laid the Country in ruin.


His Majesty is much displeased, being prevented in his de∣signs if he had got over the River: But he resolves to put a good Garrison in 
Suaint
 and 
Soochin,
 and then to march for 
Camminack,
 with hopes, that though he cannot besiege that place, that yet he shall find an opportunity in 
Moldavia
 to get over the River.


'Tis said these 
Tartars
 are 60000 strong, under Command of the 
Cham
 and his Son.






Conditions, on which his Most Christian Majesty proffers to give a Peacet 
Genoa,
 are as followeth, 
Viz.


1. THat the Duke and four 
Senators
 shall come in per∣son and submit to his Majesty.


2. That the 
Genovees
 shall observe an equal Newtrallity, and not Engage in the affairs of other Princes.


3. That they shall dis-arm all their Gallies but six, and shall Arm no more without the consent of his Most Christian Majesty.


4 That they shall give free passage, and being to the 
Salt
 in 
Savonia,
 that so it may pass freely to 
Monferrat.


5. That all the French Kings Subjects, that are forced from their Goods and Estates, shall be restored, and re∣imbursed; and that Justice shall be Administred to the French Subjects, that have any pretences on those of 
Genoa.


6. That Restitution shall be made of those Goods taken out of the House of 
Fresque,
 and that 100000. Crowns shall be paid in part to the Earl of 
Fresque:
 But if they have any pretence, to any of the Goods be∣longing to that House, they shall be heard, and his Ma∣jesty will do them Justice.


7. In Case of Refusal, they must expect no peace or quiet with 
France,
 and that this was the last Resolution of that King.


To all which the 
Genoa
 Resident (and Prisoner in the 
Bastile
 in 
Paris
) answered as followeth,


If the King will see the Duke and 
Senators,
 he must go and see them at 
Genoa,
 or fetch them 
per
 force, and that he could give no other answer.
