An
 ACT 
of
 Common Council, 
For the better Regu∣lation of the
 Weighing 
of Goods and Merchandizes at the
 KING's Beams.


W
HEREAS it appertaineth to Iu∣stice, That to all Men be uprightly given true 
Weight
 and 
Measure;


And whereas, for the more indif∣ferent and just 
Weighing
 of Goods and Merchandizes, which used to be Bought and Sold by 
Weight,
 within the City of 
LONDON
 and Liberties thereof, there are,

 and from the time, whereof the Memory of Man is not to the contrary, there have been certain 
Com∣mon Beams,
 within the said City and Liberties thereof commonly called the 
KING's BEAMS,
 at which there are and have been (during all the time aforesaid) certain sworn Offices who by the Duty of their Places have used, and ought con∣stantly to attend for the Weighing of such Goods and Merchandizes.


And whereas the Office of 
TRONAGE,
 or 
Weighing
 of all Goods and Merchandizes within the said City and Liberties thereof as well by Custom time out of mind, as by several ancient Charters and Acts of Parliament, is confirmed unto and vested in the 
Mayor
 and 
Commonal
,
 and 
Citizens
 of the said City.


And whereas all Goods and Merchandizes, of all Foreigners not being Free of the said City, which have been Sold or Bartered within the said City or Liberties, to any Person or Persons what∣soever, as well Freemen as others, ought and during all the time aforesaid have been accustom∣ed to be Weighed at one of the said 
ams,
 at or before the Sale or Delivery thereof.


And whereas divers Foreigners of late time not minding or regarding the good and wholsom Customs of the said City; but out of a Covetous desire, by sinister ways and unlawful means, to promote their own private Interests, have of∣tentimes Sold and Delivered such their Goods and Merchandizes within the said City, as well to Freemen of the said City as others, by other 
Weights
 and 
Beams,
 without weighing the same at any of the said 
Common Beams,
 whereby many Frauds, Injuries and Deceits have hapned and

 been committed: And the better to palliate their Offence and avoid suspicion, do sometimes by Confederacy and Practice with some Freemen of the said City, cause Fraudulent and Clandestine Sales to be made of such their Goods and Mer∣chandizes to Freemen of the said City, before the same Goods or Merchandizes do come to the said City or Liberties thereof, contrary to the Oaths of such Freemen, and sometimes do mix their Goods with the Goods of other Persons that are Free of the said City, that so the distinct proper∣ty of the Goods of Foreigners, may not be known from those of Freemen: And other times do procure Freemen to be Partners with them in such Goods and Merchandizes, who many times have but a small and inconsiderable Share there∣in; and upon such and other like fraudulent means and pretences, hold themselves discharged from the Duty of Weighing such Goods at any of the said 
Beams,
 whereas in truth they are not, nor ought by any such Colour or Pre∣tence to be in any sort excused or discharged, of or from the said Duty.


For remedy whereof, It is hereby Enacted, Ordained and Declared by the 
Lord Mayor, Al∣dermen
 and 
Commons
 of the City of 
London
 in 
Common Council
 assembled, and by the Authority of the same; That all Goods, Wares and Mer∣chandizes of any Person or Persons being a Fo∣reigner or Foreigners, and not Free of this City, of what kind soever usually Bought and Sold by Weight, at any time after the first day of 
January
 next ensuing, which shall be within or brought to the said City or Liberties thereof, and shall be Sold or Bartered to any Freeman or Freemen of the said City, or to any other Person or Persons whatsoever, within the said

 City or Liberties thereof, shall at, or before the Delivery thereof to the Buyer, or any other Person or Persons, for his use, be Weighed at the said 
Common Beams,
 or one af them, upon pain of forfeiture of 
Thirteen shillings
 and 
Four pence
 for every 
Five hundred
 weight of such Wares and Merchandizes, to be paid by the Seller or Barterer thereof, and so after the same Rate for every greater or lesser quantity.


And for the further prevention of all Fraudu∣lent and Clandestine Dealings, which may hereafter be practised by any 
Freeman
 or 
Freemen
 of the said City, 
Foreigner
 or 
Foreigners
 in Buying of, or Bartering for Goods or Merchandizes of 
Foreigners
 and 
Strangers
 without the Freedom of the said City, to the intent to avoid the Duty of weighing such Goods and Merchandizes at the said 
Common Beams,
 and the reasonable Duty to be paid for the same: Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Sale shall be made by any such 
Foreigner
 or 
Foreigners,
 to any 
Freeman
 or 
Freemen
 of the said City, of any such Goods or Merchandizes, before the same Goods or Merchandizes come to this City, or the Liberties thereof, whereby they avoid the just Weighing such Goods or Merchandizes at one of the said 
Beams,
 and the Duty for Weighing thereof; and such Goods and Merchandizes shall afterwards come to this City or the Liberties there∣of, and shall after the said first day of 
January
 be Sold or Bartered, and delivered by such 
Fo∣reigner
 or 
Foreigners, Freeman
 or 
Freemen,
 to any other Person or Persons whatsoever, within the said City or Liberties thereof; Then such Goods or Merchandizes shall, at or before the Deli∣very thereof to such Person or Persons so Buy∣ing the same, be Weighed at the said 
Common

 Beams
 called the 
King's Beams,
 or at one of them, up∣on pain to forfeit 
Thirteen shillings
 and 
Four pence,
 for every 
Five hundred
 weight, of such Wares or Merchandizes, to be paid by the Seller or Bar∣terer thereof, and so after that Rate for a greater or lesser quantity, notwithstanding any such Sale as aforesaid,


And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any 
Freeman
 or 
Freemen
 of this City, to whom such fraudulent Sale of such Goods or Merchandizes shall be made, as aforesaid; shall wittingly or willingly after the said first day of 
January,
 put in Vre, Iustifie or Endeavour to Maintain such Fraudulent Sale, to the intent to avoid the said just Weighing such Goods and Merchandizes, and the Duty to be paid for the same; Then every such 
Freeman
 shall forfeit for every such Offence the Sum of 
Five pounds.


And it is hereby further Enacted and Decla∣red, That if any such Goods or Merchandizes, of any 
Freeman
 or 
Freemen
 of this City, shall be mixed with the Goods and Merchandizes of any 
Foreigner
 or 
Foreigners
 not Free of this City; so that the distinct Property and Proportion of each of them cannot be known and distinguished from other, and such Goods or Merchandizes so mixed and not divided, being within the said City or Liberties, shall at any time after the said first day of 
January,
 be Sold or Bartered within the same by such 
Freeman
 or 
Freemen, Foreigner
 or 
Foreigners,
 or by any, or either of them, to any other Person or Persons, before any Par∣tition, Division or Seperation be thereof made; Then all such Goods and Merchandizes, as well of such 
Freeman
 or 
Freemen,
 as of such 
Fo∣reigner


 or 
Foreigners
 shall, at or before the Deli∣very thereof to any other Person or Persons so Buying the same, be Weighed at the said 
Com∣mon Beams,
 called the 
King's Beams,
 or at one of them; or in default thereof, as well the Buyer as the Seller thereof, shall each of them forfeit and pay the Sum of 
Thirteen shillings
 and 
Four pence
 for every 
Five hundred
 weight of such Wares and Merchandizes, and so after that Race for a greater or lesser quantity, as aforesaid.


And it is further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all such Goods and Merchan∣dizes usually Sold by weight, whereof any 
Freeman
 or 
Freemen
 shall be possessed, by Consign∣ment to be Sold, or Disposed for the benefit of any 
Foreigner
 not Free of the said City, or in Copartnership, or in Common with any 
Fo∣reigner
 by equal Moieties, or by any other Share or Shares, which at any time after the said first day of 
January,
 shall be Sold or Bartered, to any Person or Persons whatsoever within the said City or Liberties thereof, shall at, or be∣fore the Delivery thereof, be Weighed at the said 
Common Beams,
 or one of them, and in de∣fault thereof, the Seller or Sellers thereof shall forfeit and pay the Sum of 
Thirteen shillings
 and 
Four pence,
 for every 
Five hundred
 weight of such Wares and Merchandizes, and so after the same Rate for a greater or lesser quantity, as afore∣said.


And whereas, for defraying the necessary Charges of repairing, and maintaining the said 
Beams,
 and the 
Scales, Weights
 and other neces∣saries thereunto belonging, and likewise to en∣able the said 
Mayor, Commonalty
 and 
Citizens,
 to give reasonable recompence and satisfaction for

 the care and attendance of such Persons, as are and shall be necessarily employed therein; There have been time out of mind paid to the said 
Mayor

 their Deputies or Officers in that be∣half, certain reasonable Rates and Duties for Weighing such Wares and Merchan∣dizes; and the same have in all times been subject to the Alteration and Regulation of the 
Common Council
 of the said City.


Now, to the intent that the said Rates and Duties may be the better ascertained and made publick to all Persons concerned in Weighing, as aforesaid; And to pre∣vent the Officers and Collectors thereof from Demanding, Exacting or Receiving more than they ought to do: Be it further Ena∣cted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every Person or Persons not being Free of this City, who shall Sell and De∣liver, or Cause to be Sold and Deliver∣ed within the said City or Liberties thereof, any Goods or Merchandizes usually Bought and Sold by Weight, as aforesaid, shall from and after the said first day of 
January,
 in the Year of our Lord 1698, pay or cause to be paid unto the 
Master Weigher
