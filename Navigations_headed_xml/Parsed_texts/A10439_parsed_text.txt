¶A new interlude and a mery of the nature of the .iiij. element{is} declarynge many pro¦per poynt{is} of phylosophy naturall / and of dyuers straunge landys / and of dyuers straunge effect{is} & causis / whiche interlude yf y

P
eserue this audyēce and cause them to inclyne


To charyte this is my petycyon


For by your pac

A lytyll in
erlude late made and preparyd


Before your presence here shall be declaryd


¶whiche of a f
w conclusyons is contriuyd


And poynt{is} of phylosophy naturall


But though the matt

As a great clerke coude do nor so substancyall


yet the auctour hereof requiryth you all


Though he be yngnorant and ca
 lytyll skyll


To regarde his only intent and good wyll


¶whiche in his mynde hath oft tymes ponderyd


what nombre of bok{is} in our tonge maternall


Of ioyes and tryfellys be made and impryntyd


And few of th
m of matter substancyall


For though m

Consyderyng that our tonge is now suffycyent

hey myght yf they wolde in our englyshe tonge


ryt

But now so i
 is that in our englyshe tonge


 one th

 wyll oft presume amonge


 to compyle and balat{is} to indyte


Some o
 loue or other matter not worth a myte


Some to opteyn fauour wyll flatter and glose


Some wryte curyous term{is} nothyng to purpose


¶Thus euery man after his fantesye


wyll wryte his conseyte be it neuer so rude


Be it vertuous vycyous wysedome or foly


wherfore to my purpose thus I conclude


why shold not th
 the auctour of this interlude


Utter his own
 
antesy and conseyte also


As well as dyuers other now a dayes do


¶For wys
dom
 and foly is as it is takyn


For y
e
 one callyth wysedome a nother callyth foly


y
t amonge moste folke that man is holdyn


moste wyse / whiche to be ryche studyeth only


But he that for a cōmyn welth bysyly


Studyeth and laboryth and lyuyth by godd{is} law


Except he wax ryche men count hym but a daw


¶So he that is ryche is euer honouryd


All though he haue got it neuer so falsely


The pore beynge neuer so wyse is reprouyd


This is the oppynyon moste cōmynly


Thorowe out the worlde / and yet no reason why


Therfore in my 
mynd
 whan that all suche dawis


Haue babelyd what they cā no force of .ii. strawis


¶For euery man in reason thus ought to do


To labour for his owne necessary lyuynge


And than for the welth of his neyghbour also


But what dyuylish 
mynd
 haue they which musīg


And labouryng all their lyff{is} do no nother thyng


But brīge ryches to their owne possessyon


Nothyng regardīge their neyghbours distrucciō


¶yet all the ryches in the worlde that is


ysyth of the grounde by goddys sendynge


And by the labour of pore mennys handys


And though thou rych
 mā haue therof y
e
 kepynge


y
t is not this 
yches of thy gettynge


Nor oughtyst not in reason to be preysyd y
e
 more


For by other mēnys labour it is got before


¶A great wytted man may sone be enrychyd


That laboryth and studyeth for ryches only


But how shall his cōscyens than be discharged


For all clerk{is} afferme that that man presysely


whiche studyeth for his owne welth pryncypally


Of god shall deserue but lytyll rewarde


E
cept he the cōmyn welth somwhat regarde


¶So they s
y that that man occupyed is


For a cōmyn welth whiche is euer laborynge


To rel
ue pore people with temporall goodys


And that it is a cōmyn good act to brynge


People from vyce and to vse good lyuynge


Lyke wyse for a cōmyn welth occupyed is he


That bryngyth them to knowlege y
e
 yngnorāt be


¶But man to knowe god is a dyffyculte


Except by a meane he hym selfe inure


whiche is to knowe godd{is} creaturys that be


As furst them that be of the grosyst nature


And than to know them that be more pure


And so by lytyll and lytyll ascendynge


To know godd{is} creaturys & meruelous werkīge


¶And this wyse man at the last shall come to


The knowlege of god and his hye mageste


And so to lerne to do his dewte and also


To deser
e of his goodnes partener to be


wherfore in this work d
claryd shall ye see


Furst of the element is the sytuacyon


And of their effectis the caule and generacyon


¶And though some mē thyn
e this matter to hy


And not mete for an audyence vnlernyd


Me thynke for man nothynge more necessary


Than this to know though it be not vsyd


Nor a matter more lowe can not be arguyd


For though the elementis goddys creaturis be


yet they be most grose and lowyst in degre


¶How dare men presume to be callyd clerk{is}


Dysputynge of hye creaturis celestyall


As thyngys inuysyble and godd{is} hye warkys


And know not these vysyble thyngys inferyall


So they wolde know hye thyng{is} & know nothīge at all


Of the yerth here wheron they dayly be


Nother the nature forme nor quantyte


¶wherfore it semyth nothynge conuenyent


A man to study and his tyme to be stowe


Furst for the knowlege of hye thyng{is} excellent


And of lyght matters beneth nothynge to know


As of these .iiij. elementis here below


whose effectis dayly appere here at eye


Such thīg{is} to know furst / were most mete study


¶whiche matter before your presence shortly


In this interlude here shall be declaryd


without great eloquence ī ryme rudely


Because the compyler is but small lernyd


This worke with rethoryk is not adournyd


For perhappis in this matter muche eloquence


Sholde make it tedyous or hurt the sentence


¶But because some folke be lytyll disposyd


To sadnes / but more to myrth and sport


This phylosophycall work is myxyd


with mery conseytis to gyue men cōfort


And occasyon to cause them to resort


To here this matter / wherto yf they take hede


Some lernynge to them therof may {pro}cede


¶But they that shall nowe this matter declare


Openly here vnto this audyence


Be holde I prey you see where they are


The pleyers begyn to appere in presence


I se well it is tyme for me to go hens


And so I wyll do / therfore now shortly


To god I cōmyt all this hole company




¶Hic intrat natura naturata Huma∣nyte & Studyous desire portās figurā




¶Natura Naturata


THe hye myghty most excellent of all


The foūtayn of goodnes verteu & cōnyng


whiche is eterne of power most potencyall


The {per}feccyon and furst cause of euery thynge


I meane that only hye na
tu
e naturynge


Lo he by his goodnes hath ordeynyd and create


Me here his mynyster callyd nature naturate


¶wherfore I am the verey naturate nature


The inmedyate mynyster for the preseruacyon


Of euery thynge in his kynde to endure


And cause of generacyon and corrupcyon


Of that thynge that is brought to distruccyon


A nother thynge styll I brynge forth a gayne


Thus wonders
y I worke and neuer in vayne


¶The great 
wor
d
 be holde 
o deuydyd wōdersly


In to two regyons wherof on I call


The etheriall region with the heuyns hye


Conteynynge the planettys sterris & speris all


The lower region callyd the elementall


Conteynynge these .iiij. elementis be loo


The fyre the ayre the water and yerth also


¶But yet the elementis and other bodyes all


Beneth / take theyr effectys and operacyons


Of the bodyes in the region ethereall


By theyr influens and constellacyons


They cause here corrupcyons and generacyons


For yf the mouyng
 a boue sholde onys cease


Beneth sholde be nother in
r
se nor decrese


¶These elementis of them selfe so syngle be


Unto dyuers formys can not be deuydyd


yet they cōmyx to gyder dayly ye s
e


wherof dyuers kyndes of thyng{is} be ingenderyd


whiche thyng{is} eftsonys whan they be corruptyd


yche element I reduce to his 
urst estate


So that nothynge can be vtterly ad
y
helate


¶For though the forme and facyon of any thyng


That is a corporall body be distroyed


yet euery matter remaynyth in his beynge


wherof it was furst made and formyd


For corrupcyon of a body cōmyxyd


ys but the resolucyon by tyme and space


Of euery element to his owne place


¶For who that wyll take any body corporall


And do what he can it to distroy


To breke it or grynde it into 
ouder small


To washe to drown to bren it or to dry


yet the ayre and fyre therof 
aturally


To their owne {pro}per places wyll ascende


The water to the water the yerth to y
e
 yerth tende


¶For yf hete or moysture of any thynge certayne


By fyre or 
e water 
e cons

yet yerth or asshes on yerth wyll remayne


So the elementis can neuer be distroyed


For essencyaliy ther is now at this tyde


As muche fyre ayre water yerth as was


Euer before this tyme nether more nor las


¶wherfore thou man now I speke to the


Remembre that thou art compound and create


Of these elementis as other creaturis be


yet they haue not all lyke noble estate


For plantis and herbys growe and be insensate


Brute bestis haue memory and their wytt{is} fyue


But thou hast all those and soule intellectyue


¶So by reason of thyne vnderstandynge


Thou hast domynyon of other bestis all


And naturally thou sholdyst desire cōnynge


To knowe straunge effect{is} and causys naturall


Fo
 he that studyeth for the lyfe bestyall


As voluptuous pleasure and bodely rest


I account hym neuer better than a best






¶Humanyte.


¶O excellent prynce and great lorde nature


I am thyne owne chylde and formyd instrument


I beseche thy grace take me to thy cure


And teche me suche scyens thou thikyst expedyēt






¶Nature.


¶Than syth thou art so humble and beneuolent


That thynge that is mete for thy capasyte


And good for thy knowlege I shall Instructe the


¶Furst of all thou must consyder and see


These elementis whiche do yche other penetrate


And by contynuall alteracyon they be


Of them selfe dayly corruptyd and generate


The yerth as a poynt or center is sytuate


In the mydd{is} of the worlde / with y
e
 water Ioyned


with the ayre & fyre rounde & hole inuyronyd


¶Th
 yerth of it selfe is ponderous and heuy


Colde and dry of his owne nature {pro}per


Some parte lyeth dry contynually


And parte therof coueryd ouer with water


Som
 with the salt see some with freshe ryuer


whiche yerth and the water to gyder with all


So Ioynyd make a rounde fygure sperycall


¶So the water whiche is colde & moyst is foūde


In and vppon the y

In dyuers partis liynge with y

Take nothynge of hit a way the roundnes


In comparyson bycause they be so small


No more than the prikk{is} do that be on a gall


¶The ayre whiche is hote and moyst also


And the fyre which
 is euer hote and dry


A bout th
 yerth and water Ioyntly they go


And compasse them euery where orbycularly


As the whyte a boute the yolke of an egg doth lye


But the ayre in the lower parte moste remaynyth

Mouyth not naturally but by vyolence


Of the st

The see is compellyd to ebbe and flowe dayly


And freshe waters to sprynge contynually
