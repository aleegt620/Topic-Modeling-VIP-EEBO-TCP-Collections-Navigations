Belgica Caracteristica.
 OR THE DUTCH CHARACTER. 
BEING
 Nevvs from Holland. A POEM.


By 
John Crouch,
 Gent.


The second Impression, Improv'd.


LONDON, Printed by 
Edward Crowch,
 dwelling on 
Snow-hill.
 1665














Nevvs from Holland.




WHere are our Mighty 
Dutch?
 still Weather-bound?


Although the Wind has mov'd the 
Compass
 round?


Are the scar'd 
Foxes
 lurking in their Holes,


Or working under-ground, like politick 
Moles?


Appear, and open your vsurious 
Baggs,


Pluck up your Breeches, or pull down your 
Flaggs.


Come with your 
Giant
 too, you sent of late


To mince our coyne, and magnifie your 
State.


Is old 
Trumps
 broome (hung up to sweep the 
Seas
)


Imploy'd to brush off swarmes of 
Belgick
 fleas?


Are you asleep? or has our floating 
Wood


D
'd up the 
Channells
 of your 
Seas,
 and Blood?


When the warm season calls you out to meet,


Has your cold 
Terrors
 frozen in your 
Fleet?




If you have any right, or courage, come,


We shall allow you 
Mare liberum.


We'l release all our glorious 
Selden
 writ,


And wave the waighty moments of his 
Wit:


The Sea (made by our 
Cause,
 and 
Valour,
 wide)


Is narrow'd by your 
Cowardize,
 and 
Pride,


You make a 
Mare clausum,
 what? must we


Break up your Bankes to set the 
Ocean
 free?


Let's to that 
Controversie
 put an end:


Justice,
 or 
Warre;
 be 
Eenemy
 or 
Freind:


Ye know what paines your learned 
Grotius
 took


De jure belli;
 fight, or burn his Book.


Are the 
States Generall
 dumb by consent,


At one 
Æ²ote
 of a loyal 
Parliament?


Amaz'd that our State 
Chymists
 can afford


Such vast supplies, coyn 
Millians
 with a word:


Is 
Amsterdam,
 which us'd to be so crank,


(Boasting the rich Mines of her moun'tenous Bank)


Fal'ne sick (not of her Pestilence) but guilt,


Having no innocent blood left to be spilt?


Or (what is worse) is the transplanted 
Plague


Remov'd from 
Amsterdam
 unto the 
Hague?


Where the great Trades-men all their Plots disburse,


Unite the 
People,
 and divide their 
Purse.


All Artless grown? no Pilot fit to steer?


Where are your souls, neither in 
Heau'ne
 nor here?


Do Gunpowder and Brandee mix in vaine


To thaw the frozen Region of your braine?


Are ye afraid the Brittish Oakes ye bought


(Thinking to break our Ribs before we fought)


Should with your 
Guilt
 sink, or your 
Iudgment
 burn,


Or by instinct of Simpathy returne?




As once our 
Phenix
 (which a fatal hour


Had captivated by unequal power)


From midst of all your 
Screech-Owles
 took her wing,


And flew home, to enjoy a kinder Spring:


An act rare as the 
Bird,
 the 
English
 will


(Though sometimes 
Rebells
) yet be 
English
 still:


The wiser sound this dis-harmonious 
pause,


Your Ships are strong, your hearts weak like your 
Cause:


VVhere is that fury sunk your Soveraignes Fleets


Wrap'd all in flameing 
Sayles
 for Winding sheets?


While (freind to both) th' amazed 
Brittish
 shore,


Trembled to see her locks bedew'd with Gore.


None to succeed the generous 
Vantrump,


Who fiercely grappl'd with th' omnipotent 
Rump?


(For so deluded 
Wights,
 they thought t' have bin,


But 
Heaven
 is more omnipotent than 
Sin
)


That both were stout, is no prodigious thing,


Rebells
 with fight with 
Rebells,
 or a 
King.


Restore what ye have gain'd by Fraud and Stealth;


Pyrats
 and Robbers of both 
Indias
 wealth,


Hire not the 
Blacks
 your Neighbours to betray,


Whites
 in your face, in soule more 
Blacks
 than they;


Nor catch the 
Guiny
 natives with your Ginnes,


Reform'd more Heathen by your Christian sins.


When will a
 Dutch-man 
in one vessell hold


His Honesty
 and 
Trade,
 his 
Faith,
 and 
Gold?


While man has mem'ry, may that hellish Plott


Of curs'd 
Amboyna
 never be forgott:


Where you pretend a treacherous surprize,


First to betray, and then to tyrannize,


Racks, Flames, and Tortures, all so exquisit;


Seem'd not to shew your 
Mallice
 but your 
Wit:




By tedious 
Torments,
 forcing us confess


What we ne're thought, 
Made guilty by distress:


For after strict search (and a 
Dutch mans
 Eye


Rub'd with revenge is quick as 
Iealousie
)


Envy could find no weapons of offence;


Nothing ro storm your walls but 
Innocence!


But you that 
Jnnocent
 blood in peace have spilt,


Doubtless delight to sacrifice to Guilt!


Are all the Men and Ships destroy'd last Warre?


Sunk in your mem'ries too, no warning scarre?


Could a poore 
Epileptick
 Body (dead


Without the living infleuence of a Head)


Your numerous, and experienc'd 
Navies
 beat.


Or force them to the shame of a Retreat?


And shall not 
Brittains Monarchy
 doe more


Then it's sick 
Anarchie
 had done before?


Convince us why 
Republicks
 Priviledg'd are


T'vsurpe the wide 
Sea,
 and the wider 
Ayre:?


Is the whole 
Eastern World
 your propper due,


Which 
Rome
 ne're had, when she had Us, and you?


Yet your 
Republick
 is a divers Thing,


The 
Romans
 had two 
Consuls
 though no 
King,


They durst not 
start
 too farr, resolv'd to be


Within the prospect of a 
Monarchie:


The prudence of those sober Ages knew


Greater the 
Monster
 was, the more 
heads
 grew.


Two 
Persons
 Rul'd, with one misterious Will;


The 
Roman State
 was thus 
Monarchik
 still:


Two 
Consuls
 Raign'd, One the whole Worke did do;


Rul'd both the 
Publick,
 and his 
fellow
 too.


When dire Confusions must in time restore


You to the Thraldomes ye bewail'd before.




Did the communicative 
Sun
 create


All 
Spices,
 to make Insence for one 
State?


Your 
Pride,
 and 
Auerice
 will worke your bane;


Where no 
satiety
 is, there's little Gaine!


Graspe what ye well may hold, 'Tis they extend


Too farr, who reach their Ruine, not their 
End:


Though you hold forth a single joynted Hand,


Your fingers start, and disunited stand.


We all admire 
Divinity
 in 
One,


But not in every 
Concrete Vnion.


You think the Narrow 
Seas
 for us too much,


Yet the whole 
Globe
 too little for the 
Dutch.


Good Freinds Print 
Bookes,
 and let the 
Mapps
 alone,


Accoumpt not what you Sell, but buy, your owne.


Thus, while fair Liberty you give, and crave,


You would be
 Free, 
to make the World a Slave.


Tell me (then 
Low-Dutch
) when you were as bigg


With 
Common-Wealth,
 as ever 
Sow
 with Pigg,


Who your blest 
Midwife
 was; I trow, a 
Queen,


Or you had never 
High,
 and 
Mighty
 been.


Who was it rais'd you to this monstrous Height?


Taught ye at first, not to Rebell, but Fight?


You have forgot our 
Sydnies,
 and our 
Veres,


Our 
Monck,
 and 
Oxford, Commoners
 and 
Peeres;


Who shed their rich blood for your Infant 
State;


First to procure your Freedom, than your Hate.


Doe not so farr degenerate, to conclude


Your utmost Period with Ingratitude.


Ingratitude? O Heavens! Has not that word,


An edge as sharp as your old 
Generalls
 sword;


Does not that brave heroick Prince's Ghost?


Stare in your faces? tell you all is lost?




If you with 
England
 fight or shall invade


Her Royal Rights, or check her Popular 
Trade;


If you by 
Spannish
 Gabells shall annoy


Your Fellow Merchants; and devest his 
Boy.


Tell me 
ye Men of breeding
 is it meet


Or pleasant for the Head to kiss the feet?


Does that new Blood quarter'd in every veine,


His
 or the 
High and mighties
 honour staine?


Know the young 
Prince
 is more than 
Orange,
 now,


He may remit, Great 
Brittaine
 must not bow,


Be just to 
Him,
 and 
Vs,
 the Quarrell ends,


Silver will 
soder
 all, and make us freinds.


May never 
Pest
 from 
Amsterdam
 remove,


Till ye restore him to your Faith and Love!


Meane time our Loyall 
Duke
 does kindly waite,


To know the pleasures of the 
Mighty State,


Hopeing this favour youl retaliate too,


To send him word what 
Amsterdam
 will do




FINIS.
