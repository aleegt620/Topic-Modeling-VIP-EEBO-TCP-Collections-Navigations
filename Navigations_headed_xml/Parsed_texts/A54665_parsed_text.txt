To the Nobility and Gentry of KENT.


My Lords and Gentlemen,


I
 Have at last demolishd those difficulties which in∣tercepted this Work, in that progress it endevoured to make, to offer it self up both to yours and the pub∣lick view. Yet I do not deny, in a Peice made rugged with so many knots, several Mistakes and Omissions must (through Inad∣vertency and Mis-information) have slip'd in; some of which had their first extraction from the Presse, and some their birth from my Pen: All which I have collected into a Table of 
Addenda,
 which is imme∣diately subsequent to the Preface, whither the Rea∣der may retire to disperse all scruples.


Secondly, I have not added any Numerical Al∣phabet, to direct the Reader, since the Book is so Alphabetically digested, that the Work is a Dire∣ctory Beam or Ray to it self: To which I have an∣nex'd, as an Appendage, a particular Description of all the circumambient 
Kentish
 Islands.


Thirdly, I have not so tyed my self up to those severer Discourses which I have extracted from either publick or private Record, but that I have embroi∣der'd this Peice with Discourses of a softer com∣plexion;

as at 
Bilsington,
 I have unfolded the Cau∣ses of the Depravation of the ancient Clergy, both in Doctrine and Manners; at 
Birling
 I have disco∣vered the nature of that Tenure, 
Antiquity
 call'd 
Tenure per Baroniam;
 at 
Ewell
 I have unravell'd the first Institution of the 
Knights Templers,
 and the probable causes of their total extirpation; at 
New∣ington Lucies
 I have discours'd largely of 
Ʋrne En∣terment;
 at 
Rodmersham,
 no less of the Institution of the 
Knights Hospitallers;
 at 
Werth
 I have trea∣ted of the 
Antiquity
 of 
Seals;
 at 
Wymings Would,
 of the 
Ancient Dignity
 of the 
Pileus;
 and have at several other places enterlac'd this Work with colla∣teral Discourses of the same tincture.


Whatsoever this Peice may appear in the whole Frame and Bulk of it, I do assure you it was not born without your Influence, it is ready to die at your Command, and cannot live but by your Ac∣ceptance. But I know you have both Art and Can∣dor; and as I cannot but hope, but that a merciful Interpretation will be emergent from the first, so I cannot doubt but the last will give so noble an Allay to your Justice, that if it cannot totally absolve, yet it may at least excuse


(My Lords and Gentlemen)
 
The humblest of your Servants
THOMAS PHILIPOTT.

 upon perusal of the Pipe-roll of the seventeenth of

Am∣bras
 in old Record is the contracted word for 
Amphoras
 and 
Brasium
 signifies Malt, so it must be rendered forty Measures of Malt. In my desciption of 
Brabourne
 I likewise have omitted the Mannor of 
Combe,
 of which I now give this Account: 
Combe
 was anciently the Habitation of Gentlemen of that Sirname of considerable repute in this Track; for 
Rich. de Cumbe,
 and 
Simon de Cumbe
 his Son, were assistants to Sir 
Jo. de Northwood

Archers Court

 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury
 by the Crown in the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, whose Predecessors had a large share in it long before, but was again reassumed by Q. 
Elizabeth
 in the Vacancy of that Sea, and afterwards it rested in the Crown until almost our Memory, and then it was granted away to Sir 
Nicholas Tufton
 of 
Hothfield
 Father to the right honourable 
Io.
 Earl of 
Thanet
 now proprietary of it. There are some other Mistakes in this Work as at 
Uphery
 in 
Gillingham.
 p. 168. it is printed that Sir 
Henry Cheney
 exchanged that Mannor with Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and she passed it away to Sir 
Edward Hobby;
 upon a second Review I find it was not exchanged, but conveyed by Sale in the sixteenth year of that Princess by Sir 
Henry Cheyney
 to Dr. 
Alexander Nowell

Pauls.

Samuel
 joint purchaser with him. At 
Pencehurst
 what I have written concerning the Mannor of 
Pencehurst Halymote.
 p. 270. must be retracted and altered, and read thus. 
Pencehurst Ha∣lymote alias Otford VVild
 was anciently held in Lease by the Successive Lords of 
Pence∣hurst,
 of the Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 as being a Limb of their Mannor of 
Otford,
 which Mannor being exchanged by 
VVill. Warham
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 with 
Henry
 the eighth, this being a relative Appendage to it, was added likewise to the Re∣venue of the Crown, and was resident in the Royall Patrimony until these times, and then it was conveyed by the State to Col. 
Robert Gibbons.








To his worthy Friend 
THO. PHILIPOTT
 Esq; Upon his Diligent Survey of the Mannors of KENT: Entituled, 
VILLARE CANTIANƲM.




THou hast approv'd, Friend, by thy worthy Pen


The Saying of that learned Sage, that 
Men


Are not born for themselves:
 Our Friends do claim


In us a share; our Parents do the same:


Our Countrey for a third comes in; nay, it


Boasts than the rest a more inherent right.


How as a Friend, and Childe, thy Duty thou


Discharged hast, thy more Familiars know!


This I affirm, that of his Countrey none


Hath better merited than Hee alone.


Lambert
 submit, and 
Weever
 too give place;


Nay, thou great 
Cambden
 stand aside: Alass!


You have but posted through our Countrey, and


As if pursued, have fear'd to make a stand:


Whereas amongst us He both born and bred,


In every 
Hundred, Parish, House
 t' have led


His whole Age seems: and 'mongst us to have liv'd


Ere since from Records Rights could be deriv'd.


Bold 
Briton
 then! when 'tis a Crime to be


A Gentleman; and when an Enemie


He's therefore thought, and in Arms to have been,


In whose House 
Arms
 and 
Ancient Coats
 are seen:


When 
Gules
 to him his Blood, 
Or
 his Estate


To this hath cost; when a true 
Sable
-Fate


From Painted 
Sables
 to a Third hath sprung;


Thou dar'st assert what others fear to own:


Thou dar'st by thy more equal Pen unite


(What pow'rful Wrong hath oft disjoyn'd) the Right


Owner with his Possessions; to the 
Son


His 
Fathers
 Titles, and Dominion


With care transmitting; and the 
Heir
 dost tell


How he his Clods derives: Couldst thou as well


Instruct him how his 
Mannors
 to employ,


As thou dost how, and whence he doth enjoy


The same; then 
Scorned Letters
 would at last


Above 
Profaning Ignorance
 be plac'd:


Nor hadst thou travell'd at thine own expence


So many Miles; but know thy recompense


Is from thy self: whilest thou a Name dost give


To 
Ancient Families,
 thine 
Own
 shall live.




JOH. BOIS of 
Hode
 Esq;








The 
Preface
 to the READER.


ANtiquity is the great Luminary of Time, which dispels those Clouds, that like a gloomy Skreen, interposing between the object and the understanding, cast it into Error and Misapprehension: And not onely of Time but of Histo∣ry too; History, that faithful Register of things past, That great Informer of the present, and certain Prophet of the Future; By it we may discover the Print which former Ages made, and treading that, know how to decline the crooked and Irregular Paths of Danger and Misfortune. Antiquity is like the lamp in 
Tullia
's Urne, that representing to our view by Grains and by Scruples the Re∣liques and dust of our long-since expired Ancestors, which perhaps lay scatter'd in the Wilderness of their own Dispersion, erects a Monument to their Re∣membrance, so inaccessable to all the onsets and impressions of age and oblivi∣on, that then onely it shall languish into Decay and dissolution when Nature her self, and Time, the moth of Nature, shall lye gasping in their own ruines, and the Universe it self shall confess its Ashes.


And certinly, amongst all those Trophies which antiquity hath fix'd upon the face of this Island, there is none more Copious, if we consider them for quan∣tity; nor more Conspicuous, if we represent them in their quality, than those that it hath left scatter'd upon the Continent of 
Kent:
 and this must be obvious to the most easie Intellect, when it shall discover that in all the Eruptions of forain Invaders upon this Island, the first track of that Thorough-fair hath been laid in, or very near, this County, by which they have farther penetrated into the Bowels of this Nation. We will wave that fiction of 
Brute
 and a partie of Fugitives (originally) as the 
Legend
 insinuates of 
Trojan
 Extraction, and dis∣carded from 
Italy
 for some Misdemeanor there acted) fixing here, as likewise that Series of the Kings Subsequent to him, being wholy obtruded upon us by seduced and misguided Histories; the brain indeed of 
Jeffrey
 of 
Monmouth
 being both the Forge and the Anvill from whence those sparks brake forth at first, which made up that 
Ignis Fatuus
 after which the world so long hath wandered.


First then the 
Roman
 Eagles endevoured to surprize and seise on the Domi∣nion of this Island, though they were once or twice so rudely grip'd by the 
Britains
 neare 
Chilham
 in 
Kent,
 and some of their noblest Plumes torn from them, that they were forc'd to fly back into 
Gaule
 to new impe their Feathers but breaking in again with a recolected and multiplied strength, the Liberty of this Nation stoop'd, and became a prey to their victorious Tallons, And now it was ordered that all Pleas, Escripts, Decrees, Edicts, and other things of publique Cognisance should be issued out in the 
Roman
 Dialect, that so the roughness of the 
Britains,
 which their warlike inclinations had so long entitled them to, might not onely by degrees be fil'd off, but that likewise being suppled and softned by the 
Roman
 Culture, they might without any regret or resent∣ment

support that load of slavery that sat so heavy on their shoulders, and so at last become wholy riveted and incorporated into the 
Roman
 Empire.


But this was onely in intention, for the accomplishment and perfection of it, was superseded by the Inroad of the 
Goths
 and 
Vandals
 into 
Italy,
 which like an Inundation in many signal conflicts had almost swept away the Imperial dignitie, and so torn the whole Bulk of the 
Roman
 Empire, that its very Spirit was ready to ebb out at those breaches. So that in fine, the Emperour was forced to re∣trive the Guards and Stationary Legions scattered o're this Island, with these like a new stock of spirits to improve and fortifie the Heart of the 
Roman
 Em∣pire, which was ready to bleed out its life at those wounds that the hands of these Barbarous Nations had inflicted on it.


And now the spirits of the 
Britains
 (a stronger Butteress against the Eruptions of the 
Picts
 than the Wall erected by the 
Romans
) being by the Engines of a long and habituated Servitude, cowed and broken into a degenerate Effe∣minacie, they lay open to all the Assaults and impressions of the insolent In∣vader; so that they were forced either to resign up themselves to the fury and inclemency of the Sea, or else offer themselves up to the Rage and Bar∣barity of a Savage enemie: And now, being devested of all protection at home, and all hope of supply from abroad, being forelaid and intercepted by the In∣vasion of the 
Goths
 on the Empire, they made their addresses to the 
Saxons,
 a Martial People then inhabiting that nether part of 
Germany,
 which is washed by the Rivers of 
Elve, Weaser,
 and 
Rhine,
 who instantly upon Covenant and as∣surance of a vast Guerdon to ballance their services, under the conduct of 
Hengist
 and 
Horsa,
 embarqued for 
Britain
 and landed in the Isle of 
Thanet,
 and shortly after with such vigour and animosity repressed the insolencies of the 
Picts,
 that they shut them up within the Cloisters and Recesses of their own Mountains. But it might be said of them, as it was anciently of Religion; 
Religion brought forth Riches, and the Daughter devoured the Mother:
 So these 
Saxons,
 from Assertors and Protectors of the 
Britains,
 became at last Invaders of them; for they representing to the other 
Saxons
 the health∣fulness of the Air, and the temperateness of the 
British
 Clime, who were over-stocked and cloyed with excess of People, and were willing to evacuate that surcharge of Inhabitants into forain Colonies, they instantly attaqued any advantage that might put them into Hostilitie with the 
Britains;
 and pre∣tending that that Compact so solemnely stipulated and transacted between them and 
Hengist
 was infringed and violated, they poured themselves in like a 
Cataract
 upon this Island, so that the 
Britains
 to secure themselves from the fury of this Deluge, after many vigorous attempts to make it flow back a∣gain, shut up themselves within the Solitudes and Recesses of 
Wales
 and 
Corn∣wall,
 whilest on their ruines their adversaries erected and fixed their 
Saxon Heptarchie;
 which again, after many mutual encounters, wherein almost every Turfe of this Island was bespatter'd and bedewed with Blood, found a publique Tombe in the 
West-Saxon
 Monarchie.


But scarce was the Basis of it established, whose Ciment was so much Blood and Tears; But God, who corrects the Ambitious by retaliation and chastises the insolencies of one Invader by casting another into Competion with him, put the 
Dane
 into Ballance with the 
Saxon,
 who like a whirlewind threw himself upon this Island so that all blooming Glories of the 
Saxon
 Greatness did wither and shrivell up, being suddenly nipt and blasted by this Northern tempest. I shall not discypher the long, many, and impetuous encounters between these two fierce Nations, with the effusion of Blood

and the ruine and Depredation that discomplexioned every part of the Land; indeed, they are of so disordered a Memory, and then so blended and con∣founded in the Persons, Times, and Places, upon which the Scene of these de∣formed Tragedies is intricately fixt, that it would be (as one well observes) ano∣ther war to the Reader to over-look them. In brief, after a signal combat per∣sonally commenced between 
Edmund Ironside
 and 
Canutus,
 in the Isle of 
Atheleny,
 both armies on either shore, being Spectators, the 
Saxon
 Diadem was by reciprocall compact to be devided between them: which after the decease of 
Edmund Ironside
 at 
Oxford;
 which, whether it were Naturall or Artificiall, is yet a controversie, wholly invested the Temples of 
Canutus.


But alas! upon what a frail and incertain Pedestal is all humane greatness setled? For the lustre of this new erected Monarchy had no sooner displayed its beams in 
Canutus,
 but like an unthrifty Taper it began to glimmer in 
Har∣old,
 and absolutely expired in 
Hardiknute,
 who dying issueless, the current of Royalty ran back again into the chanel of the 
Saxon
 Blood, which flow'd in the veins of 
Edward
 Sirnamed the 
Confessor;
 who likewise deceasing with∣out Issue, 
William
 Duke of 
Normandy
 upon a pretended Donation from the last 
Edward
 entitles himself to the right and interest of the 
English
 Diadem.


But this certainly was invail'd, for no Testamentary collation can ravell or disorder succession, which with an indissolueble link is chain'd and fastned to the nearest of Blood, and of which the Nation is to take the sole and proper Cognisance:) And to assert his title (which was fixt on the point of his sword) he arives in 
Sussex
 with a numerous Army, to check whose farther Progress in this Island, 
Harold
 advances likewise with a considerable Army (whose body had before evapourated its best and noblest Spirits at those wounds which it before had received in a bloody encounter comenc'd with 
Harold Harsanger
 King of 
Norwey:
) And nere that place where afterwards was founded the Abby of 
Battell,
 puts his claim to the Scepter, likewise to the Decision and Umpirage of the Sword, and after a fierce dispute found the Tombe of his new purchas'd Royalty in the carriage of this Field, upon whose ruines, 
William
 now a Con∣querour, climbs up the Ascent of the 
English
 Throne.


His first design (after he had scatter'd all those clouds of discontent that might have possibly have enwrapt the rays of acquired Majesty in some new umbrage,) was to take a Survey of each mans particular interest and Patrimony, which was inroll d and recorded in a publique Register commonly called 
Dooms∣day
 Book; upon pretence, that from a generall computation of the Revenue of the Nation, he might discern what strength might be collected to intercept the violent attempts of any forain Invader upon this Island. But indeed to make a strict inquisition into the Forfeitures of the Lands of those that had been in Hostility under the Ensignes of 
Harold
 against him, that with those he might not onely endear and gratifie his Partisans, but likewise by reinvesting the chiefest of his adversaries in those possessions which were by their Enmity escheated, oblige them to maintain his Title and Scepter. Yet it is observe∣able, that he engag'd all those that had receiv'd any Lands or Demeasnes of him, either by any new concession or re-investiture to hold them in Escuage, that is by Knight Service, by which they were oblig'd whensoever either publique necessity or his Commands did exact it of them, to attend his Person, either actually or virtually, that is by Proxie with Horse and Armes; and by this art he had always a power in reserve to repress and scatter all Solleviations or sud∣den Insurrections at home, and contradict all the Attempts and Animosities of Adversaries from abroad; that so he might become considerable to his enemies,

and usefull to his Friends. Thus have I compendiously wound up the severall Invasions made on this Island, in which 
Kent
 was so much concern'd. But there is another Invasion that I have not yet numbred, which hath been more ruinous and distructive to the noblest Families of this Island than any of those above recited: and that is the Riot and Excess, that like an Infectious Cloud, whose noysome wombe drops nothing but disease and Pestelence, hath lately broke in upon this Nation, and so withered the Root of the most ancient Gentry, that they have shrunk into their own ruines, and faln negelcted and forgotten: Indeed our modern Luxury is like the Poyson of the Viper, it blasts invisibly, and distroys insensibly, and they that are softned with it are like a Tree, that feeds those wormes that must devoure it; or like Iron, that supplyes that rust which will corode it. Indeed 'tis observable, that those Families have continued in their splendor longer whose seats and habitations have engag'd them to a remoter distance from the Verge and Sphere of the City, than those whose Revenue and Patrimonie hath confin'd upon a place infected with so much Debaucherie, and let loose into so great excess. Yet, 'tis remarkable that the cadets, or younger slips issued out from some of those stems, who by their own vitious exorbitancie have crumbled into an inreparable decay, by being inoculated upon other Families, have by this transplantation contracted newsap and verdure, and again sprouted out and florish'd. For Families are like the River of 
Arethusa,
 they sometimes sink in one place or County, and again rise in another.


I shall now take the County of 
Kent
 under Survey or Prospect, and repre∣sent to the publique view, those several Antiquities which in my search I found to lie wrapt up either in common Records, or shut up in the private Muniments, Escripts, and Registers of particular Families; from whom I have endevour'd to pluck off the veil that they may for the future stand as an Alpha∣bet to point out those Families that are yet in being, that are totally exinguish'd or that lye entomb'd in other Names and Extractions, which by Mariage have swallowed up the Heir generall: In the pursuit of which I confess I have not cloister'd my self up in the nice restraints of any precise or particular Method, because that flood, both of private and publique inteligence, which like a Torrent broke in upon me, swept away whatsoever my busie fancy had built upon the sands of any curious or Methodical invention; But 'tis here, as in some Rivers who though they wander in a crooked and irregular chanell, yet are they the same Streames still, as long as they hold correspondence with their first Fountain and original.


I shall remit all to the Justice and Candor of the Reader, with the first he may arraigne and censure, with the last absolve and excuse


Thomas Philipott.

These Hundreds were parcel'd out into such a proportion or number of Boroughs, Villages or Tythings, containing ten Housholders, whereof (as the 
Saxon
 Laws and Customes informe us,) if any one should commit an unlawful Act, the other nine were to attach and bring him to Reason. If he fled, thirty one dayes were enjoyn'd him to appear: if in the mean time apprehended, he was forc'd to restore the Damage done; otherwise the Free-borough-head (that is to say the Tythingman) was to take with him two of the same Village, and out of three other Villages next adjoyning as many (that is, the Tythingman and two other of the Principal men) and before the Officers of that Hundred purge himself and the Village of the fact, restoring the Damage done, with the Goods of the Malefactor; which if they sufficed not to satisfie, the Free∣borough or Tythingman must make up the rest, and besides take an oath to be no way accessary to the Fact; and to produce the offender, if by any means they could recover him, or know where he were. Besides, every Lord and Master stood Borough for all his Family, whereof if any servant were cal'd in question, the Master was to see him answer it in the HUNDRED where he was accus'd; if he fled, the Master was to resigne such goods as he had to the King: If himself were accus'd to be aiding or privy to his Servants flight, he was to clear himself by five men, otherwise to forfeit all his Goods to the King, and his man to be Outlawed. These Links thus intermutually fastned, made formerly so strong a chain to hold the whole frame of the State toge∣ther in Peace and order, as all the mingled policies upon Earth, all the inter-leagued Societies of Men cannot represent a straiter Form of combination.


As touching the other Customes of 
Kent,
 they have been so fully discuss'd by Mr. 
Lambert
 in his 
Kentish Perambulation,
 that I shall not much insist in the discove∣ry of them: only I shall something winnow the word 
Gavelkind,
 because from that it is pretended the Tenure it self is derived. First, it is suggested, that the word 
Gavelkind
 is amass'd together of three 
Saxon
 Monosyllables, that is to say, 
Goef ele Kent:
 but how this Custome should be originally established on three Syllables by the corruption of Time thus crouded and shut up in one word, is altogether ambi∣guous and mysterious: For, if we shall unvail the word of its 
Saxon
 Habit, and put it into an English dress, it will signifie thus much, 
Give all Child;
 and how much nonsense lurks in that expression, I think is easily discernable: Indeed the phrase should be, if we would attempt to spin any thing of advantage out of it, 
Goef ele Kendern, Give all Children,
 But how much of incongruitie and non-coherence lies wrapt up even in this, I beleeve is obvious enough; yet admit there were none, how four Syllables all of different vowels in their termination, should at length by the depravation of Language be all confusedly shuffled and stiv'd into this one word 
Gavelkind,
 will certainly appear to the most easie apprehension disputable enough.


For my own particular, I'm convinc'd (with submission to cleerer speculations) that this word 
Gavelkind
 is derived from the 
Saxon
 word 
Gabel,
 which in the Latin we render 
Census,
 and put into English signifies some Rent-Service, or Tribute issuable from such and such Land, on which it is fixt as a solemn evidence of some homage due to the Prince or supreme Magistrate, for that security which is received both in life and propriety by his defence and tuition. And certainly this is some∣thing proportionate to Reason; for all 
Gavelkind
-Land is held in the Tenure of free-Soccage, which is charg'd with this manner of Rent-charge or imposition; and so in several Latine Records is represented under the Notion of 
Terra Censualis.




'Tis true, that by the ancient custome of 
Germany,
 cal'd 
Land-Skiftan,
 the Lands of the deceased was by equal portions to be distributed amongst all the Sons; but then it is as probable that this Tribute or 
Gabel
 did accompany it, because the most essen∣tial part of this Custome hath through the Channel of many hundred years flow'd down to this present Age, and is in force in sundry places in 
Germany
 at this instant: For though the Hernelickheis or Lordship, as they style it, descend Patrimonially 
per Jus Dominatus,
 by the right of Signorie to the elder Son, yet all the Land ex∣clusiely from that is equally divided between the Cadets or younger Brothers, on∣ly returning some inconsiderable Rent-Service to the Prince, as a character of that Fealtie thy owe him for sheltring them in their several Patrimonies by his mutual support and protection.


Certain it is when 
Hengist
 transported his 
Saxons
 first into 
Britain,
 that Custome of 
Land-Skiftan
 was wafted over with them, and was by him allow'd to his Abet∣tors and Partisans when they were invested in their new Acquists and Possessions in 
Kent,
 as all other Franchises and Immunities were, which before in 
Germany
 they were by prescription endow'd with, that they might more vigorously improve his designes upon this Island; yet still it is possible he reserved out of those 
Demeasnes
 thus by Grant couveyed to his complices, some Annual Tax or Gabel (though per∣haps of a low and narrow value) as a signal acknowledgement that the Superiori∣ty or Soveraignty was solely lodg'd in him.


There are two other Customes which are properly calculated for the Meridian of 
Romeney Marsh,
 and perhaps through inadvertency were not recited by Mr. 
Lambert,
 and they are these: First, the King had anciently no Wast there, and secondly he had no Wracks, but they were appropriated to those Mannors of the 
Mersh
 that con∣fin'd on the Sea; and surely if we fathom their original we shall find their foundati∣on established on much of Reason. For first, how could the Crown entitle it self to any Wast there, where the Sea by its impetuous encroachments did engage the Inha∣bitants to cast up Mounts, and erect Banks in any place which they should find most proportionate to their defence against the fury of so formidable an adversary? For the second, it is very equitable that they that are interessed in an expence of that vast∣nesse in which the Publique (by the obligation of necessary consequences) is so much concern'd and wrapt up, should have something of Emolument indulged to them by the careful Munificence of the Prince, to poise and ballance those important dis∣bursements which the ill neighbourhood of the Ocean does oblige them to, in fortifying the 
Mersh
 with perpetual Defences and Dams against its assaults and eruptions. Having thus discovered something in relation to the Customs of 
Kent,
 before I advance farther into the Land, I shall represent what care our former Kings have embarqu'd themselves in, to secure the Sea, by fixing Sea-watches and other Military Guards upon all the Avennues and Inlets of the Coast, to represse and check the attempts of any bold Intruder, as if their own safety and indemni∣ty were folded up in the security of this County.


Touching then Sea-watches upon the Coast, there are three Presidents, and a Mandate from the King to the Sheriff in a time of a more modern inscription for performing the like service. The first containing the watch by night in Record is styled 
Vigiliae minutae,
 which are due of right and custome to be made by the Men of certain HUNDREDS, as by the Title thereof, and the Writ for Exe∣cution of the same may appear.


The second concluding the Day-watch, hence called 
Wardan
 is arbitrary, and at the pleasure of those which in time of war and common danger had authority to appoint them, of these there are three examples, one of the 9 of 
Edward
 the 3. (which I intend principally to trace, as being the original to the other) which year he made preparation to invade 
France,
 and to vindicate his Title to the Crown, and the other the 20. of 
Edward
 the 3. in which year he sailed into 
France
 and triumphed in the Signal battail of 
Crescey.


The third describeth to whose charge several parts of the shore were assign'd for defence, in the 29, of 
Fdward
 the 3. At what time he past into 
France
 and was victo∣rious in the Encounter of 
Poictiers.
 It discovers also what parts of the Shire were to resort to the Coast for protection of the same. This order is arbitrary also,

as they that in the Record are styl'd 
Rectores Comitatus
 (that is, Lieutenants of the Shire) shall think meet to appoint.

Before I shut up this discourse concerning Sea-watches, I shall represent to the Reader the Draught of a 
Praecipe
 directed to 
Gervas Clifton
 Esquire, Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the 26. of 
Henry
 the Sixth, by that Prince, by which we may calculate the extent and Latitude of those commands he was to regulate himself by in his care and provision for the defence and Indempnity of this County against the eruptions of any forrain violence whatsoever.


Rex Vicecomiti Kantii salutem. Quia datum est nobis intelligi quod nonnulli inimici nostri su∣per Mare se tenentes, regnum nostrum Angliae in diversis locis ingredi intendunt, &c. Nos ma∣litiae suae obviare volentes, tibi praecipimus, firmiter injungentes, quòd statim visis praesentibus in∣fra Balivam tuam taminfra libertates quàm extra, ubi melius & expeditius videris faciendum, ex parte nostra publicè Proclamari facias, Quod omnes & singuli Ligei nostri de Baliva tuâ, qui Vigilias apud Promhill, Helmes, Kenell, & Denge Mersh, ac in aliis locis ibidem adjacentibus & convicinis super Costeras Maris antiquitus custodire debeant & solebant, hujusmodi Vi∣gilias in eisdem locis custodiant & custodire faciant: It a quod (defectu Vigiliarum praedicta∣rum) sub poena forisfacturae omnium quae nobis forisfacere possunt, damnum, periculum aut gravamen nobis aut populo nostro non eveniat ullo modo & quòd Legei nostri Commitatus tui, Signa vocata Beanors in locis consuetis, per quae gentes de adventu inimicorum praedictorum congruis Temporibus poterint praemoneri, ponant & poni faciant: Et hoc sub periculo incumbente nullatenus omittatis.

Because there hath been frequent mention of 
Hobilers
 in the abovesaid dis∣course, I shall discover to the Reader a brief portraiture of them, as I have copied it by that Original which hath been pencil'd out by the learned industry of Sir 
Henry Spelman
 in his 
Glossarie.


The word 
Hobiler,
 sayes he, is derived from the French word 
Hobill,
 which imports as much as a light quilted Cassock; and indeed all the Latine Records say they should be 
Wampasa armati,
 which signifies or denotes a Jack; and in some parts both of 
Germany
 and the Low Countreys, at this day 
Wampas
 is us'd to express a Doublet or a short Cassock: and if you will know with what Horse they were equip'd or furnish'd for service, the abovesaid Author will tell you, that every 
Hobiler
 should be 
Mediocri eque instructus, & ad omnem motum agili;
 a Horse of no great proportion, but light, and fitted for all manner of service.


Having represented to the Reader how sedulous the Princes of this Nation were in Modern times to secure the Maritime shores of 
Kent,
 which like a Girdle of sand almost invest this County, I shall now discover briefly and in Landskip how they were guarded, fortified, and preserved in times of an elder Inscription; which discourse I shall marshall under the Notion of 
Littus Saxonicum.


We are now come to speak of the Sea-Coast, which the 
Romans
 termed 
LITTUS SAXONICUM,
 that is, the 
Saxon
 Shore: and as the opposite Shore unto it from the River 
Rhene
 to 
Xantoigne
 in 
France,
 had a Ruler over it from 
Dioclesians


time, whom 
Marcellinus
 calleth 
Tractus maritimi Comitem,
 that is, the Count or Lieu∣tenant of the 
Maritime Tract;
 the book called 
Notitia Provinciarum
 stileth, The ho∣norable Earl or Lieutenant of the 
Saxon
-shore along 
Britain;
 whose office was, with Garisons set upon the Shore in places convenient, to represse the depredati∣ons, spoils and robberies of 
Barbarians,
 but of 
Saxons
 especially, who grievously infested 
Britain.
 And he had relation in point of Command unto the Right Ho∣norable General of the Foot-men, whom they called 
Presentalis,
 who besides the Garisons lying at the Havens assigned unto him at all assays for the defence there∣of, 
Victores juniores Britannicianos, Primanos juniores, & Secundanos juniores
 (these are the names of certain Bands or Companies) these he had for his under-Officers to it. 
Principem ex officio Magistri presentalium à parte peditum numerarios duos, Commen∣tariensem, Cornicularium, Adjutorem, Subadjuvam, Regerendarium, Exceptores singula∣res, &c.
 The Formalities of the Ensignes and Commission assigned to this great Officer are thus described in my former Author,

 and were instituted about 
MCC
 years now past, or about 
Theodosius
 the II. which fals neer the last times, where∣in the 
Romane
 Empire extended it self hither:

This

 was as Admirall of that time, and placed against the Maritime incursions of the 
Saxons,
 or those of the West part of 
Germany
 that were known most commonly by that name; the charge or Impress of his ensigne was 9 Mari∣time Towns, but thus placed on the forme of the whole Island; that which appeares

in the Canton of the Banner, besides the Towns names is thus expounded by 
Pancirollus
 who notes them to be 
Sigles,
 and parts of words so well and commonly known in the Office of the Court of the Notaries, or of the Clerks of the Crown, that it needed not they should be more largely expressed; the words he thinks are these, 
Faelix liber∣injunctus Notariis laterculi continens mandata ordine Principis
 or 
Primicerū,
 which was the Master or President of the Clerks of the Crown: And for his Garisons he had under him MM. CC. Foot, and CC. Horse, with his Officers thus expressed

For the Maritim Townes within this Government are mentioned here, 
Othoma
 is conceived by Mr. 
Camden,
 and some other learned men, to have been in the Hundred of 
Dengy
 in 
Essex,
 in the same place or neer where St. 
Peters
 in the Wall is. And to this day doth not 
Brithlingsey
 a Towne adjacent, remain a Member of 
Sandwich,
 and under the Government of the Lord Warden of the Cinque-Port.


Besides the Testimony of sundry inquisitions of survey of the Lord Wardens Admiral jurisdiction; Do they not crosse in direct line from the South-Foreland, which is by 
Margate
 in 
Thanet,
 and so turning up to 
Reculver,
 crosse the main Ocean to the 
Langrell Poynt in Essex,
 passing along St. 
Peters
 in the Wall, where this 
Othoma
 is said to have been, 
Dubris
 was 
DOVER: Lemanni
 or 
Lemannis
 (which is 
Pertus Lemanni
 in 
Antonius,
 and Λιμὴν in 
Ptolmy,
 but not it seems as the word 
 is significant in 
Greek
 but as it was made from the 
British
 name) 
LIME,
 or 
LIMEHILL
 in 
Kent,
 the place where 
Caesar
 landed when he Conquered 
Britain;
 And doth not 
Shipwey
 (the place where the Lord Warden of the Ports taketh his Oath upon his first entrance into that Government) lye in LIME, and is yet within his Government as also 
Hyth,
 which implieth as much as 
Portus
 in Latine, that is, Haven, one of the 5 Ports adjoyning, and 
Stutfall-Castell
 at the foot of LIME-HILL, was it not a Fortress built by the 
Romans
 for de∣fence of the 
Saxon
 Shore, 
Regulbium RECULVER,
 at which the water 
Genlade
 or 
Wantsum
 entered in, and passing by 
Sarre
 a place yet under the Lord Wardens juris∣diction, insulated the Isle of 
Thanet, Rutupis
 RICHBORROW near SAND∣WICH on the same Shore, and 
Anderida
 was situate near. NEW ENDEN in 
Kent,
 upon the river of 
Rother,
 that anciently passed by 
Apeldore,
 and disembogued it self into the Ocean at 
Romney;
 one of the Ports upon the 
Saxon
 Shore, and under the Lord Wardens goverment; 
Portus Adurni
 is supposed to have been 
Arundel.
 or 
Edrington
 near 
Shorham
 in 
Sussex, Branodunum
 is taken for BRANCASTER in 
Norfolk
 and 
Gariono
 or 
Gariononum
 for YARMOUTH both of them lying up∣on the 
Saxon
 Shore in 
Norfolk.
 And do not the 
Barons of the Ports
 injoy a Privi∣ledge upon the said Coast, sending yearly two of their said 
Barons
 as their 
Bailiffs


to joyn with them of 
Yarmouth,
 since they were incorporated in the Administration of publick Justice, during the free Fishing Fair, which thing they have used to do before ever the Town of 
Yarmouth
 was built. The Fortress where the Garrison appointed for the defence of this part of the 
Saxon
 Shore was resident, is now cal∣led 
Burrough-castell
 adjoyning to the River of 
Yare,
 as Mr. 
Camden
 hath ob∣served in his description of that Place.


The Barons of the Ports did Anciently send 7 of their Barons Bailiffs to 
Yarmouth,
 and after reduced that number to 4 whereof 2 were sent to see justice and right done a∣mong the Portsmen that did Fish upon the 
Saxon
 Shore, where 
Branodunum
 in 
Norfolk
 stood, and in those times they continued 40 dayes, which since hath been re∣duced to 2 Bailiffs; and their time of stay to 20 dayes, the 
Cerimonial
 of their en∣trance and reception into 
Yarmouth,
 continues some similitude of what is before expres∣sed yearly upon the 
Ʋigil
 of St. 
Michael
 the Arch-angell; the Bailiffs of the Barons of the Ports, with the Banner or Ensign of their general incorporation displaid, and of this form ride on horseback into the said Town, to the house provided for them, during their abode there; and are to be received with civil and mutuall respect by the Magistrates of that Place.


The Officers Atending upon the Bailifs of the Barons of the Ports are these



A Register,


A Serjeant of the Banner,


A Serjeant of the Horn,


Serjeants at Mace.






Cinque Ports arms: three lions passant guardant conjoined to as many ships' hulls




As for that Officer called the Serjeant of the Horn, be it understood as an ancient note of the Ports tenure by Cornage, from King 
Canutus
 time, by which, as the best Customals of the Cinque Ports inform me there Moots and publick Assemblies are summoned, 
Sonitu Cornu.


Having entred into a Discourse of the Cinque Ports, I shall take a farther propsect of those privileges they were invested with, from or before the Con∣quest, especially by that signall Charter, which was granted to them in the 20 year of 
Edward
 the first. First, then they were exempted from all Taxes and Tallages, that they might with more vigor and alacriry be encouraged and emboldened to attend the publique Service.


Secondly, they had 
Sac
 and 
Soc, Sac
 is a privilege to take Cognisance of causes either Criminal or Civil within their own Courts, 
Soc
 is a power planted in them to compel all persons which live within the Confines of their Liberties, to plead in their Courts, and from hence anciently they were called 
Socmanni,
 that is, Suiters to that Court, where they were forced to plead.


Thirdly, they had 
Toll
 and 
Theam, Toll
 was a Liberty of buying and sel∣ling within their own juisdiction, and a power to receive the 
Toll
 or 
Gabel
 imposed on commodities there vended. 
Theam
 is both a civil and coercive power or jurisdiction settled in them by Charter, over all those who are inhabitants of the Cinque Ports, or any of the limbs or members of them.


Fourthly, they had 
Bloodwith
 and 
Fledwith, Bloodwith
 is a power to punish the effusi∣on of Blood; 
Fledwith
 is an authority to punish those who having committed any misdemeanor or outrage, and seeking to secure themselves by flight, are again seised upon, and offered up to deserved Justice.


Fifthly, they had 
Pillorie
 and 
Tumbrell, Tumbrell
 was an Engine much resembling our Cucking-stool, and was instituted to restrain the fury of loud clamorous and impetu∣ous Women.


Sixthly, they had 
Infangetheof
 and 
Cutfangetheof,
 that is a power to imprison, and

upon just and legal evidence (which is the Lanthorn of the Law) to execute all those, though Forainers and Aliens which should commir any felony in places subject to their jurisdiction.


Seventhly, they had 
Mundbriech;
 that is, a priviledge to raise banks and mounds on any persons land whatsoever, whose proprietie lay within their jurisdiction, to secure the common Interest from the eruptions and casuall Inundations of the Sea▪


Eightly, they had 
Waives,
 called by a generall name in old Law-Latin 
Weveragium,
 and 
Strays Waives
 was a word of a common latitude, used to signifie all those things, either wandering Chattel, or other goods, which being waved or lost, and not claimed within a year and a day, were to be possest by those within whose jurisdiction they were seis'd, according to that of the Civill Law, 
Quae nullius juris sunt, & pro derelictis habentur, cedunt occupanti.
 Strays is a word of a more circumscrib'd and restrained sense, relating only to stragling Cattel; to whom if none did entitle themselves by claim in a year and a day, their propriety was invested in those who possest them.


Ninthly, they had 
Waste
 and 
Strep,
 or Estrepment Waste was that parcell of common earth which by prescription and custome belonged to the Crown, but by Charter was enstated on them. 
Strip
 or 
Estrepment
 is a power granted to them to cut down Trees within their own jurisdiction, without impeachment of waste.


In the tenth place, they had the grant of 
Flotsom, Jetsom, Witsom: Flotsom
 were goods upon some visible wrack floating to the shore 
Jetsom,
 were goods in a storme thown over board to preserve the Ship, and sinking did again buoy up themselves, anr were again by the agitation of the waves thrown on the Strand. 
Witsom
 were goods driven to the shore, when there had not been for some space any wrack visible; from whence they were anciently styled Goods of Gods mercy; 
Wit,
 in old English importing as much as 
Misericordia
 in Latin.


Their eleventh priviledge was to be a 
Guild,
 that is a Fraternity or Combination of men that had all the Franchises of Court-Leet and Court-Baron annex'd to them; as likewise they were endow'd with a power upon emergent occasions to improve the common interest, to lay Assessements and Taxes upon the Inhabitants of the Cinque Ports and their Members; the word 
Guild
 being extracted from an old Latin word called 
Geldo,
 which signifies to tax.


Their twelfth Franchise was, to assemble at 
Shepway,
 which was anciently called the Portmote or Parliament of the Cinque Ports; there they punish'd the infringers of their priviledges, and amerc'd all those who being Inhabitants of the Cinque Ports, or of those Towns which were circumscrib'd within their Jurisdiction, sued out of those Courts which were properly established to hear and determine all causes arising within their Liberties; here likewise they had Authority, by Royall Concession, to make By-Laws and Ordinances, for the common good and profit of the Cinque Ports, and for the better Regulating (as the exigency of Affairs might seem to exact) the Herring∣fishing at 
Yarmouth;
 and that this Court in the power of it might appear to be the Coun∣terpane of that great Original of Power, the high Court of Parliament, all appeals from the inferior and subordinate Courts of the Cinque Ports were transmitted and transfer'd to this of 
Shepway.


Lastly, the Barons of the Cinque Ports claim by inherent Custome and Prescription, which is grown up and confirm'd by a tacite consent between them and the King, to support the four Staves of the Canopy that covers the Kings Head at his Coronation, and after to dine at the uppermost Table in the great Hall, on his right hand.


There are other Franchises and priviledges circumscrib'd within the Verge and Cir∣cumference of the above-recite a Charter, as the taking cognizance of the Assize of Bread and Beer, and some others; which because they are not of that importance or consideration as those which before were rehearsed, and moreover finding that they are calculated for the Meridian of many other Corporations besides that of the Cinque Ports, I have at present forbore any farther Recital of them.


Now if any one will enquire what the Cinque Ports were to act by way of recom∣pence or retribution for these so solemn and signall Characters and Demonstrations of royal favour; To this I answer, That they were to find fifty and seven Ships at their own Charge, for the space of fifteen days, to attend the King whensoever he should pass the Seas; whereof 
Hasting
 was to find one and twenty, 
Sandwich
 five, 
Hieth
 five, 
Romney


five, and 
Dover
 one and twenty; each of which was to be furnished with one and twenty men, and a 
Garcion
 or Boy, the Masters stipend was to amount to 6
•
 the Constables to a Sallary of the same value, and each vulgar Mariner was to have three pence 
per diem;
 and if the obligation of affairs so requir'd it that they at∣tended the King beyond the extent of fifteen days, then they were for the time fol∣lowing to be supported in their expences at the charge of the Crown. Now be∣cause the wisdome of after-times thought this too vast and burdensome an expence, to be solely and wholly sustain'd by the Cinque-Ports, therefore there were several other Towns and Villges that lay scatter'd in the Body of this Nation, that were made Mem∣bers and Limbs of the Cinque-Ports, and invested and fortified with the same Im∣munities and Liberties, that they might by consequence be enwrapt and engag'd in the same common expence. The Names of those which are situated in 
Kent
 are as followeth: 
viz. Sandwich
 had the Addition of 
Fordwich, Sarre, Ramsgate, Deal, Walmer,
 and 
Stonor. Dover
 had 
Feversham, Birchington,
 St. 
Johns,
 St. 
Peters, Ridlings∣would,
 and 
Folkstone. Hieth
 had West-
Hieth. Romney
 had old 
Romney, Lydde, Prom∣hill, Dengemersh,
 and 
Orwelston. Hastings
 and 
Winchelsey
 had in 
Kent
 as their Appen∣dages, 
Bekesbourn, Grench,
 and 
Tenterden.
 As a L'envoy to the Cinque-Ports, I shall represent a Summary, or Bedroll of all those Persons of esteem that have had the Ho∣nour to have been dignified with the Title of Lord Wardens of the Cinque-Ports; which Scroll or Register I have collected out of an ancient Manuscript, and are in their

I might have been more copious in my Discourses of the Cinque-Ports; but be∣cause I intend to publish a particular Treatise relating solely to their Immunities, and their just Right to take cognisance of the Fishery at 
Yarmouth;
 I shall no far∣ther insist upon this subject, but proceed. 
KENT,
 upon the first eruption of 
Hengist
 and his Saxons upon this Island, was represented by himself and his Par∣tizans under that fair and noble Character, that after he had in many bloody De∣cisions broken the strength of the 
Britains,
 upon their ruines he laid the foundations of that greatnesse, on which he afterwards establish'd the Throne, by which he as∣cended to the height of Majesty, and was the first of the Saxons whose hand sway'd the 
Kentish
 Scepter; indeed 
Cyning
 the old Saxon word implyes no more but one that is dextrous and cunning in the managery of the publique Affairs, and such a one was 
Hengist;
 from whom the Series of the Kings of 
Kent,
 which I am now to mention, did as from their Fountain primitively stream forth:

Egbert
 having thus broken the Kentish Forces, and inoculated the Scepter of 
Kent
 upon that of his own, the Title of King was for ever entomb'd in the Ruines and Tomb of the slaughter'd 
Baldred;
 nor was this County dignified with any Title at all, untill the Reign of 
Edward
 the Confessor, and then that Prince created 
Godwin
 Earl of 
Kent;
 a man of so low and obscure an extraction, that the concurrent Te∣stimonie of all Authors does affirm he was 
Bubulci Filius,
 the son of a Cowherd: yet notwithstanding, he made himself so considerable by his Eruptions on several parts of this Island by Land, and his depredations by Sea, that our English story swels with the rehearsal of his Acts of Devastation and Piracy. Now if you would know from whence the Latine word 
Comes
 deduces its original, that is, the 
Ge∣nus
 both to the French word 
Count,
 and the Saxon word 
Earle
 or 
Eorlederman,
 (for that was the more antient term;) I shall in a brief Model represent it to you. The ma∣king of 
Counts
 anciently, as is affirmed by 
Trebellius Pollio
 in the life of 
Macrianus,
 was in 
Contubernium Imperatoriae Majestatis adsciscere,
 to take some select Persons into the Chamber and fellowship of the Imperial Majesty: that 
Tiberius
 had some such, is most certain; for, 
Suetonius
 in his life mentions 
Comites Largitionum expeditionumque;
 whose first institution is by 
Seneca
 in his sixth Book 
de Bene. Cap.
 34. refer'd and ascrib'd to 
Gracchus
 and 
Livius Drusus;
 they, saith he, 
apud nos primum instituerunt segregare Tur∣bam suam, & alios in secretum recipere:
 and then again, 
Habuerunt itaque isti amicos pri∣mos, habuerunt & secundos;
 and it is recorded of 
Alexander Severus
 by 
Lampridius,
 that 
Amicos non solùm primi ac secundi loci
 (which were certainly those persons which he had separated from the vulgar masse of men) 
sed etiam inferiores aegrotantes viseret.
 And 
Tacitus
 in his Book de 
Bello Germanice
 relates, that the Prince had 
duodecem Co∣mites,
 or twelve Companions assign'd him, who transacted the great Affairs both of War and Peace; from which Model it is probable the 12 Peers of 
France
 had their first original. In Ages of a lower step, these 
Comites
 were frequently call'd 
Reguli.
 In 
Can∣tia,
 saith 
Malmsbury, Omnis justitia laborabat sub cujusdam Gorongiregimine, qui tamen si∣cut omnes Reguli insulae Vortigerno substernebantur.
 Afterwards when 
Hengist
 had esta∣blish'd

his Kentish Kingdome, the Title of Earl began to commence in 
Otho
 and 
Ebu∣sa,
 Brothers to the abovesaid 
Hengist,
 as the same 
Malmesbury
 observes in his Tract 
de Gestis Regum Cap.
 3. And the Title of Earl was anciently expressed by the word 
Comes
 amongst the Saxons, for to King 
Ethelberts
 Charter for the foundation of the 
Abby
 of St. 
Augustins,
 cited by 
Reynerus,
 there are these subscriptions, 
Ego Hamigi∣lus Dux laudavi,
 and then, 
Ego Ocea Comes consensi, Ego Graphio Comes benedixi;
 and there is an old Epitaph quoted by Mr. 
Selden
 in his 
Titles of Honour,
 the substance of which is this; that 
Alwain
 which was Founder of 
Ramsey-Abby,
 was 
Comes & Al∣dermannus totius Angliae:
 but in decursion of Time, this word 
Eolderman
 being used by others besides those to whom it was proper and analogical, it began to languish into disuse, and the Title of 
Thane
 and 
Earl
 was assumed, which last hath re∣mained in force untill this day: Now the relief of a 
Thane
 (who was certainly an Earl by office, rather then Title) if he were of the first rank, that is, had the custody of some County under the King, which he paid to the Crown, was four Horses two sad∣led and two unsadled: two Swords, and four Spears, and as many Shields; And if he were of the second rank, he paid two Horses, one sadled and one unsadled, one Sword, two Lances, as many Shields, and fifty Marks in Silver; sometimes, if he were a 
Thane
 of an inferior rank, he paid eight-pound, and frequently three-pound. The relief which an Earl paid constantly to the Crown after the 
Norman
 Conquest was (as Mr. 
Selden
 in his 
Titles of Honour,
 does demonstrate out of severall Records) was an Hundred pound.


Now the benefit which did accrue to the 
Count
 or 
Earl,
 besides a Barren and na∣ked Title to support the dignity of his Person in its due Magnificence and Splen∣dor, was the third penny arising out of the Profits of the County. 
Algar
 Earl of 
Merc∣land
 (as 
Dooms-day
 Book informs us) had the third penny of the County of 
Ox∣ford,
 and the Borough of 
Stafford
 under 
Edward
 the Confessor. And 
Mawde
 the Em∣presse when she created 
Milo
 Earl of 
Hereford,
 assigned to him for the support of his Honor, the third penny of that County: Many examples of the like condition are discoverable in Mr. 
Selden's Titles of Honour,
 whither I refer the Reader. And as they had the third penny, so they had frequently the Castle of the County annexed to their Title, but when by experience the Kings of 
England
 were instructed how fatally per∣nicious it was to have so many local powers concurrent with theirs, that by the strength of their retreat, and the number of confederates and Partisans, seem'd even to out∣poise the Royal Authority, it was by a Statute made in the 13
th.
 year of 
Richard
 the 2
d.
 for the future interdicted and prohibited.


Now if you will enquire when Earls or Counts from being absolute became Feu∣dal, Sr. 
Henry Spelman
 in his 
Glossarie
 will tell you that it was 
Tempore Othonum, & sub excessu Merovinae stirpis in Galliâ,
 that is, about the year onet housand.


Now as concerning the Ensigns of Investiture, with which the Earl was created, it was anciently only with the Cincture of a Sword, but about the latter end of 
Ed∣ward
 the first, the Coronet began to be in use, for 
Aymer de Vallence
 Earl of 
Pembrook
 who died in the 16
th.
 year of 
Edward
 the 2
d.
 had one, as appears by an instrument of 
William de Lavenham,
 cited by Mr. 
Selden
 in his 
Titles of Honour,
 by which he acknowledges the receit of it from Sr. 
Henry Stacheden
 in the 12
th.
 year of 
Edward
 the 2
d.
 
Richard
 Earl of 
Arundel
 died in the 49
th.
 year of 
Edward
 the 3
d.
 and by his last Will dated the fifth of 
December,
 gives his Noblest and Richest Coronet to his Son the Lord 
Richard Fitz-allan,
 his second to the Lady 
Joan
 his eldest, and the 3
d.
 he be∣queaths to the Lady 
Alice
 his youngest Daughter.


What the 
Counts Palatine
 were I shall now demonstrate: they were taken immedi∣ately 
à Palatio,
 from whence they assum'd their name; and were customarily such as had the nearest relation to the Prince, either by friendship or Affinity, and to whose care and administration, he did entrust such or such a Province; and the more to improve and enable them in the discharge of their Duty, did unite some pri∣vileges and Franchises to their office; as erecting Courts of Judicature, appointing Judges to sit in them, and determine by signal decision upon causes both Criminal and Civil, and others of the like nature, that were of that luxutiant latitude, that they had the Stamp and Character of something which resembled Regality fixt upon them. He that will discover by example more of this honorary Title may read Mr. 
Sel∣dens

Titles of Honor
 whither, to decline all superfluity of discourse, I refer to the Reader.


I have now done with the Title, I shall now proceed to unwind the Register of those who were Earls of 
Kent
 subsequent to Earl 
Godwin.

Having represented in Prospect the 
Comites
 and 
Consules,
 the Earls and Consuls which were originally to manage those Provinces subordinate to the Romane Go∣vernment; I shall now take cognisance of those which were anciently styl'd 
Vice Co∣mites & Proconsules,
 and had care of the Provincial revenue (in relation to which they were term'd 
Questores Provinciarum
) and the jurisdiction of some Causes only (as our Sheriffs have of divers Actions 
Viscontiel
) and inquiry of Causes Criminal, but not determination of them. In the Saxon times they were sometimes call'd 
Ealdor∣men,
 and in Latine 
Vice Comites,
 which was applyed to them, not as they were sub∣servient to the Earl, but as they administered justice when he was either dead or absent. 'Tis true, if we dissect the word 
Earldom,
 we shall discover the last syllable: 
Dome
 is deduc'd from 
Dominion,
 and implies that the Marshal and Civil Government be∣ing anciently subordinate to Counts and Earls, there was some Analogy and re∣semblance in the Official Dignity of an Earl, and a Sheriff, and certainly the word 
Sheriff
 imports no lesse, a word contracted from the Saxon word 
Schyregereve,
 or 
Schyregrave.


The word is best interpreted by the Laws, intituled 
the Confessors,
 where we read thus, 
Sicut modo vocantur Greves qui super, alios Praefecturas habent ita apud Anglos anti∣quitûs vocabantur EALDORMEN, quasi seniores non propter Senectutem cum qui∣dem adolescentes essent sed propter sapientiam:
 they were call'd anciently 
EALDOR∣MEN,
 say those Laws, not in respect of years, but wisdome. And we find 
Henry
 the 3
d.
 made his Son Prince 
Edward
 the five last years of his Reign, Sheriff of 
Bedford
 and 
Buckingham.
 The black Prince was often Sheriff of 
Cornwall
 under 
Edward
 the 3
d.
 And Prince 
Henry
 in the life of his Father 
Henry
 the 4
th.
 is found to have been Sheriff of 
Cornwall,
 and it was done by these Sagacious Princes, with this intent, that their Sons, when they should ascend the Throne, might be more dexterous in the Course and Conduct of the revenue of the Crown. And as these Princes were inve∣sted with this Office, so we find both Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Earls, and Ba∣rons held this Dignity; nay, sometimes Queens and Countesses, Dowagers too, with an allowance of a Shire-Clerk, which after resolv'd into him, we call the under-Sheriff. And it was usual long since, as the Statute-Law now likewise asserts it, that the 
Cen∣sus
 or Possession of some 
Demeasne
 in the County, admits a capacity to hold the office, and answer the King the Profits of the County; otherwise, they are illegal

and lyable to exception; and in this respect, sometime the King committed four Counties to one man, if he were possest of Lands in them all, as 
Hubert de Burgo
 was at one time Sheriff of 
Kent, Norfolk, Suffolk,
 and 
Lincoln,
 and was allow'd a meet person to be his Substitute or Shire-Clerk in the ninth of 
Henry
 the third.


If any shall demand how long there have been Sheriffs under this quallified No∣tion, as I have before represented and pourtray'd them, I must remit them to King 
Alfred
 the Founder of 
Englands
 peace, and the divider of it into Shires and Pro∣vinces; not to 
Gervas
 of 
Tilbury,
 whose definition of the Name is very deficient, making the office meerly suppletory to the Count or Earl, nor to 
Polidore Virgil,
 who being by birth an 
Alien,
 would obtrude a false opinion upon us, that the offi∣ces of the Chancellors and Sheriffs were instituted since the 
Norman
 Conquest; For evidence to the confutation of him, we may read the Testimonies remembred by the most learned 
Selden,
 in the subscription of King 
Edreds
 Charter, to the Abby of 
Crow∣land
 there after Abbots, Dukes and Counts follow, 
Ego Afor vice Comes audivi.
 ✚ And in another Saxon Charter, to the same Abby there is this clause inserted, 
Ego Livingus Clericus istud Chirographum manu meâ subscripsi, & Domino meo Theroldo tra∣didi;
 which Records do indisputably, I think subvert his Assertion.


The next Annotation upon our proconsulary Officer, is the continuation of those that in elder time held it many years together; as for example, the 
Cornhills
 did in 
Kent,
 whereby their own Sirname was discontinued, and the officiary Name 
le Sheriff, & le Viscount
 swallowed up the other, and the relict of Reginald 
(de Cornhill) le Viscount,
 in a Concession of Land to the Chappel of 
Lukedale
 in 
Littlebourn,
 is styl'd in the Latine Instrument 
Vice Comitissa Cantii,
 and a Mannor of his in 
Minster
 in the Isle of 
Thanet,
 has from this Sirname obtain'd the Title of the Sheriffs Court. But when it was found inconvenient for one man to hold the place any long time, in regard of his Account, and other enormities emergent; provision was made by Statute that none should serve two years together, but should be two years at least devested of the Office ere he served again in the same County.


Touching the Sheriffs Letters of attendance, injoyning all Arch-Bishops, Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, Bishops, Barons, &c. to assist him, it shews in 
Lankskip
 and 
Perspective
 afar off, the Latitude anciently of his authority; but since the institution of Lords-Lieutenants, the Beams of his power have shone forth with a more dim and contracted light: So much shall suffice for the explication of its Name, as it is Officiary. Now a word or two how it became Honorary, because as from the Con∣sul or Count, Time and Royal Authority hath extracted the Princely Dignity of Earl, which being for the most part enstated in elder times on the Kings kindred, hath caused the use of that addition ever since to all of that rank: So likewise the State and Degree of a 
Vicount,
 hath a participation of that Attribute, and are call'd Cousen by the Soveraign, and in the Scrutiny made by the Chancellor of the Order of the Garter at every Feast of St. 
George,
 during the time of 
Vespers,
 if there were any stall void; A 
Viscount
 is admitted as the lowest degree of Princes. The first that under this Ti∣tle had Parliamentary Dignity and Precedency of all Barons with us, was 
John de Beaumont
 created 
Viscount-Beaumont
 in the 18
th.
 year of 
Henry
 the sixth without any re∣lation to the Office. The Circle or Coronet of this Degree being by its figure di∣stinguish'd from an Earls, as a Marquesses is from a Dukes. They that would take an exact survey of the official part of this ancient Minister in all its Dimensions and Ap∣pendages, let them consult 
Dalton,
 who has very exactly and usefully discovered to the world all the Ingredients which make up this Office.


I shall before I proceed to draw out the Catalogue of the 
Kentish
 Sheriffs, repre∣sent to the world a summary List of Arch-Bishops, Earls, Bishops, and others of high eminence, which manag'd this Office, either personally or virtually; as well in o∣ther Counties as in 
Kent.
 And first, Queen 
Isabel
 had the Sheriffwick of 
Cornwall
 di∣vers years before her Husband 
Edward
 the 2
d.
 was thrust out of the world by an un∣natural death, and some years under the Reign of her Son King 
Edward
 the 3
d.
 
Mar∣garet
 Widow of 
Edward
 Earl of 
Cornwall
 held this Office in the County of 
Rutland
 the five last years of 
Edward
 the first, and as many years in the beginning of King 
Edward
 the 2
d.
 And after the next three years 
Margaret
 the wife of 
Peirce Gaveston
 Earl of 
Cornwall
 answer'd King 
Edward
 the 2
d.
 the Profits of that County. 
Elizabeth


Countesse of 
Salisbury
 had the County of 
Wilts
 committed to her 
Anno.
 1216. the 21 of 
Henry
 the third, and 
John Dacus
 was her substitute.


William
 Earl of 
Salisbury
 was Sheriff of 
Huntingdon
 and 
Cambridge
 the 16
th
 and 17
th
. of King 
John,
 and Sheriff of 
Lincoln
 six or seven years together: The Earls of 
Warwick
 were often Sheriffs of 
Warwick
 and 
Leicester-shire
 under 
Edward
 the 3
d.
 and also of the County of 
Worcester
 most part of that Kings Reign; indeed the office of Sheriff was so frequent in that Family that it almost appear'd to be Hereditary to the 
Beauchamps: Ralph
 Earl of 
Chester
 was Sheriff of that County the first of 
Henry
 the third, and of the County of 
Lancaster
 the second year of the same King.


Walter
 Lord Arch-Bishop of 
York,
 was Sheriff of 
Nottingham
 the fifty fourth and fifty fifth of K. 
Henry
 the third, and 
Hugo de Stapleford
 was his Shire-Clerk; 
Hillarius
 Bishop of 
Lincoln
 was Sheriff of 
Lincolnshire
 the ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth of 
Henry
 the third, and 
Ralph Regnald
 was his Shire-Clerk. 
Hillarius
 Bi∣shop of 
Chichester
 was Sheriff of 
Sussex
 and 
Surry
 the eight of 
Henry
 the second.


Richard
 Bishop of 
Salisbury
 was often Sheriff of the County of 
Dorset
 under 
Henry
 the third, and of 
Hampshire
 at the same time. 
Joceline
 Bishop of 
Bath,
 was Sheriff of 
Somerset
 under 
Henry
 the third, and 
Peter
 Bishop of 
Winchester
 the first eigth years of 
Henry
 the third. 
Walter
 Bishop of 
Carlisle
 was frequently Sheriff of 
Cumberland
 un∣der 
Henry
 the third, and 
Robert
 his successor was often Sheriff of the same County under 
Edward
 the first; and both of them had their Shire-Clerks. 
Walter
 Bishop of 
Coventry
 and 
Liechfield,
 was often in this office under 
Richard
 the first in the County of 
Stafford. Ralph Abbott
 of 
Michelen
 was Sheriff of the Counties of 
Somersett
 and 
Dor∣set
 the seventh of 
Henry
 the third.


Many more Presidents of this Nature could be unfolded, but I think these are com∣petent Testimonies enough to discover both the Dignity and Eminence of this an∣cient and illustrous office; only this may be deduc'd from these examples: That some Counties heretofore were joyned with their next Neighbors for ease of the service, as 
Sussex
 and 
Surry, Devon
 and 
Cornwall, Somerset
 and 
Dorset, Hampshire
 and 
Wilts, Warwick
 and 
Leicester, Cambridge
 and 
Huntingdon, Norfolk
 and 
Suffolk, Essex
 and 
Hart∣ford,
 &c. most of which were separated by Queen 
Elizabeth
 and the rest taken in sun∣der by the late King 
Charles.


I shall now endevour to unravel the Catalogue of the Sheriffs of 
Kent,
 as I find them Registred either in the Pipe-Rolls, or other Evidences; and I have as much as posibly I could, Recorded the places where they inhabited, which will much improve and inforce that light which I am to distribute to the world: in Relation to those pla∣ces I am in my subsequent discourse to treat upon.


And first, I find 
Osward
 a Saxon held divers Lands in 
Kent,
 as 
Herst, Hagalei, Norton, Chert, Stepedon,
 with 
Tunsdal,
 and 
Tong,
 during the Reign of 
Edward
 the Confessor; all which Lands were in the Conquerors Time, possest by 
Hugo de Port:
 This 
Osward
 also held 
Delce Hadon, Alneiton
 and 
Har & Sham.
 He was Sheriff of 
Kent
 under the Confessor, as appears by the prime Record of the Nation, 
Domes day Book,
 where speaking of 
Tarentford
 in 
Axtan
 Hundred it is thus entred, 
Homines de in Hundredo testificantur, quod de isto Manerio Regis ablatum est unum Pratum, & unum Alnetum, & unum Molendinum & XX. acrae Prati, &c. Dicunt etiam quod Osward tunc Vicecomes praestitit ea Alestano Praeposito London, & modo tenet Heltus Dapifer & Nepos ejus. Hamo
 and as frequently 
Hanno
 Lord of 
Marourd,
 in the Hundred of 
Littlefield,
 and of 
Blen
 in the Hundred of 
Whitstaple,
 and 
Lavinton
 in the Hundred of 
Downhamford,
 of 
Estursete; Briested
 (now I take 
Brasted
) 
Nettlested, Ditton,
 and divers other Lands in 
Kent,
 was Sheriff at the Time of the General Survey entred by the Conqueror into his 
Domes day Book.
 The Records of 
Christ Church,
 and the Deeds of the Hospital of St. 
Lawrence
 near 
Canterbury,
 prove that 
Hamo
 Son of 
Etardes de Crevequer,
 did in the Reign of 
Richard
 the first and K. 
John
 hold divers of the Lands, if not all above recited. He continued Sheriff (as then was very usual during life; which was en∣larged untill about the middle of 
Henry
 the first, for in the year 10111, which is the 11
th
 of 
Henry
 the first, 
Hugh Abbot
 of St. 
Augustins
 granted 
Bodesham
 and 
Smethetum
 to this 
Hamo, Quod ipse
 (as sayes the Deed) 
si opus fuerit Ecclesiae & mihi, vel successori∣bus meis de praedictis in Comitatu, vel in Curia Regis contra aliquem Baronem, consulat, adju∣vet, & succurrat exceptis Dominis suis quorum Homo manibus suis fuerit.
 At the same

time this 
Hamo
 restored to the same Abby in the Town of 
Fordwich
 in this Form. 
Hamo Cantii Vicecomes & Henrici Regis Anglorum Dapifer timore Dei ductus reddo Deo, & Sancto Petro Apostolorum Principi, & Sancto Augustino Anglorum Apostolo, & Abbati Hugoni, & Fratribus ejusdem loci Villam de Fordwich. Hanc Donationem meam per Psal∣terium Sancti Augustini & per cultellum meum super principale Altare ejusdem Ecclesiae ma∣nibus meis misi, &c.


William de Aynsford
 was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 after 
Hamo
 in the Reign of 
Henry
 the first, for in the Chartularies of St. 
Augustin
 in 
Canterbury,
 I find a Transcript of the Kings writ thus, 
Henricus Rex Anglorum Willielmo de Aynsford salutem, fac juste habere Abbati de Sancto Augustino consuetudinem suam de Niwentonâ in Denariis Averiis & operationibus, &c.
 And the Deed from 
William
 Son to 
Henry
 the first is here entred, and imports as much as the former; 
Willielmus Filius Regis Willielmo Vice Comiti de Kent salutem; Fac recognosci per Homines Hundredi de Middletuna quas consuetudines in Villâ de Nivento∣nâ, &c.
 This Family of 
Ainsford
 ended about

London.


Norman Fitz Dering
 was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 under K. 
Stephen,
 unto whom Queen 
Maud
 directed her Writ concerning some Land given by her to the Nun 
Helmida ad facien∣dam Domum suam in Elemosinam apud Fauresham post Mortem ejus; Volo
 (saith the Queen) 
ut Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Fauresham pro salute Domini mei Regis Stephani, & meâ, & Filiorum nostrornm & Statu Regni nostri habeat praefatam Terram in perpetuum.


He and his Brother 
Godred Fitz Dering
 are 
Teste
 to a Deed of their Brother 
Osbert de Morinis
 (so called because his Brother was a 
Fleming
) which Deed is Registerd in the Chartularies of Saint 
Augustins,
 wherein he to that Abby gives six Acres and an half of Land in 
Thanet,
 for the supply of a Light in the Chapel of St. 
Mildred;
 within the Abby aforesaid; 
Pro salute Animae suae, & Animi Uxoris ejus Ermelinae, & in Hono∣rem Sanctae Virginis Mildrethae.

Having a in succinct Register represented to the Reader an Historal View of those who were successively Sheriffs of this County, as high as the Light of Publick Record will guide us to discover, I shall now in a narrow Landskip give him a Prospect of those who in elder Times were styled 
Conservatores Pacis,
 from whence our mo∣dern Justices of the Peace may have seemed to have extracted their Original Institu∣tion: They were first established by 
Edward
 the third, and then invested and fortified with an Authority and Power of a very wide Latitude, but suitable indeed to an Of∣fice of so much concernment and importance as they were intrusted with, the main End of their Place in the first Foundation of it was as appears 
Pat. de Anno primo Edwar. tertii Pars prima Memb. septima in Dorse,
 to array and train the Inhabitants of each respective County where the Scene of their Power was laid, that so they might be put into a Capacity to repress all homebred Insurrections within; and secure the Na∣tion from the Eruptions of forraigne Invaders from without, and it is further evident 
Pat. de Anno duodecimo Edwar. tertii Memb. 16. in Dorso.

 They were authorised by two

Commissions to reduce all Vagabonds and Wanderers, to dissipate all mutinous and riotous Conventions, and to suppress all Thieves and Outlaws, and all other Persons disaffected to the Peace established; and to vindicate and assert the two Statutes of 
North-Hampton
 and 
Winchester
 in all the Ends and Consequences of them, both which Laws direct an Inspection into the Premises. The Catalogue or Register of those who were 
Conservatores Pacis,
 for the County of 
Kent

In this year it being found by Experience that the former Number of the Wardens of the Peace setled by the Statute of the eighteenth of 
Edw.
 the third, before mentioned, was not sufficient for the good Governance of this County; It was further provided by an Act made in the thirty fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Cap.
 2. Ordaining that their should be in every Shire one Lord, and with him three or four of the best in the County, and three or four learned in the Laws assigned for keeping of the Peace, and to restrain Offenders. In the next Commission awarded after this Act, these eighth Persons are recited for the abovesaid Purpose,

 But this Restriction was not so permanent, but that in short space the Number was very much augmented, as by the subsequent Se∣ries in the first year of 
Richard
 the second may very well be observed.

After by the Statute of the twelfth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Cap.
 10. and the fourteenth year of the same Prince, 
Cap.
 11. it was prohibited that there should be any more than six Justices of the Peace in any Commission besides the two Justices of As∣sise, and certain Lords who were assigned in the Parliament it self. But in Times sub∣sequent to these, when the Womb of Vice (like the Mudde of 
Nile
) was more fertile in the production of Crimes, and the Seeds of Contention began to be sown more plentifully in every furrow of this Nation, which sprang up again in a numberless Variety of Discord and Animosity; these Restrictions were broke, and the Catalogue of Justices was improved to that Volume, to which it is swoln at present.


Before I descend to a particular Description of the Parishes of this County, I should take cognisance of all those Towns and Villages which by the indulgence of former Princes were invested with the Charter of Market and Faire:

 Indeed all of them had this Passage inserted in the Original Grant, 
Quantum in Nobis est,
 so that ma∣ny of them when they came to be discussed before the Judges 
Itinerent
 at the general Assises, 
Quo Warranto
 they were held, that is to say, what Authority they had to sup∣port them, were if they were found convenient and necessary ratified, confirmed, and continued; but if again they were deemed needless and superfluous, they were at these publick Conventions by the power of the Law then planted in the Judges, vacated and discarded, This may likewise be added, that many of them were granted with this

Intention of their first Institution only to inforce and Aggrandize the Signorie of those Mannors which were parcel of the Demeasn of those eminent Persons to whom those above mentioned Royal Charters and Concessions were indulged; as, 
Sutton Valence, Court at Sreet, Shinglewell,
 and others; and when the Title and Possession of those Places was either by Purchase or Marriage cast into the Tenure of other Proprietaries, the Virtue of these Grants began to be dis-spirited, and the Custome of Keeping up Mar∣kets and Fairs at these Mannors and Parishes began insensibly to shrink into disuse and intermission. It is farther observable, that at diverse Places which were endowed with these above mentioned Priviledges, as, at 
Brenchly, Charlton
 by 
Greenwich,
 and other Parishes, the Market and Fair was observed and held in the Church-yard, and on the Sun∣day; it being the great Design of the Romish Clergie of those cloudy Times, to whom Godliness was great gain, in the practical sense, at once to charm the peoples Devotion and Benevolence: But, as if there were in the Vogue and Estimate of that Age, a greater Degree of Sanctity entailed on the Church-yard, then on the Sunday, the holding either Market or Fair in that Place was by a Statute made in the thirteenth year of 
Ed.
 the first, Chapter the sixth, wholly interdicted and prohibited; but though the Church∣yard were thus empaled, and fenced in with this new Law, the Sunday lay open and exposed to all Disorder and Prophanation, untill the Reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then that pious Prince resenting with regret the many Enormities and other Excesses of a black Complexion, which were occasioned by the Conflux of people assembled at these publick Meetings, and which had foully stained and debauched the purity of this Solemn Festival, did by Statute made and ratified in the twenty seventh year of his Reign, Chapter the fifth, for the future forbid the keeping of any Markets or Fairs in any Place whatsoever on the Sunday.


I shall now take a Prospect of all the Parishes, Villages, and Mannors, which are circumscribed, within the circle of this County; but before I wade farther in this Discourse, I shall represent upon what reasons or foundations Mannors were first in∣stituted and established, by example and resemblance of the King's policy in the in∣stitutions of Tenures, (saith Sir 
Francis Bacon:
) The great men and Gentlemen of this Realm did the like, so near as they could; as for Example, when the King had given to any of them two thousand Acres of Lands, this party proposing in this place to make his Dwelling, or (as the old word is) his Mansion-house, or his Man∣nor-house, did devise how he might make his Land a compleat Habitation to supply him with all manner of necessaries; and for that purpose, he would give of the utter∣most parts of these two thousands Acres, one hundred, or two hundred Acres, or more or less, as he should think meet, to one of his most trusty Servants, with some reserva∣tion of rent to find a horse for the wars, and go with him when he went with the King to the wars, adding vow of Homage, and the oath of Fealty, Wardship, Marriage and Relief. This Relief is to pay five pounds for every Knights Fee, or after the rate for more or less at the entrance of every Heir: which Tenant so created and placed, was, and is to this day called a Tennant by Knights Service, and not by his own person; but of his Mannors, of these he might make as many as he would; then this Lord would provide that the Land which he was to keep for his own use, should be plowed, and his harvest brought home his House required, his Park pailed, and the like; and for that end he would give to sundry other of twenty, thirty, forty or fifty Acres; re∣serving the service of plowing a certain quantity, or so many dayes of his Lands, and certain Harvest works, or dayes in the Harvest to labour, or to repair the House, Park, Pail, or otherwise; or to give him for his provision, Capons, Hens, Pepper, Commin, Roses, Gilliflowers, Spurs, Gloves, or the like; or to pay him a certain Rent, and to be sworn to be his faithful Tenant, which Tenure was called a Soccage Tenure, and is so to this day; howbeit, most of the plowing, and Harvest services are turned into Money Rents: the Tenants in Soccage at the Death of every Tenant, were to pay Relief, which was not as Knights Service is, five pound a Knights Fee; but it was and is still one years Rent of the Land, and no Wardship or other profit to the Lord. The remainder of the two thousand Acres he kept to himself, whith he used to ma∣nure by his Bondman, and appointed them at the Courts of his Mannor how they should hold it, making an Entry of it into the Roll of the Remembrances of the Acts of his Court; yet still in the Lords power to take it away, and therefore they were called

Tenants at Will, by Copy of Court Roll; being in truth Bondmen at the beginning; but having obtained freedome of their persons, and gained a custome by use of occu∣pying their Lands, they now are called Copyholders, and are so priviledged, that the Lord cannot put them out, and all through custome; some Copyholders are for Lives, one, two, or three, successively; and some Inheritances, from Heir to Heir, by custome, and Custome ruleth these Estates wholly, both for Widows Estates, Fines, Harriots, Forfeitures, and all other things. Mannors being in this sort made at the first, reason was that the Lord of the Mannor should hold a Court, which is no more then to assemble his Tenants together, at a time by him to be appointed; in which Court he was to be informed, by oath of his Tenants, of all such Duties, Rents, Reliefs, and Wardships, Copy∣holds or the like, that had happned unto him; which information is called a Present∣ment, and then his Bailiff to Seise and Distrain for those Duties, if they were denied or with-holden, which is called a Court Baron; and herein a man may Sue for any Debt or Trespass under Forty pound value, and the Freeholders are to judge of the Cause up on proof produced upon both fides; and therefore the Freeholders of these Mannors, as incident to their Tenures, do hold by Suite of Court, which is to come to the Court, and there to judge between no party and party in those perty Actions; And also to inform the Lord of Duties, Rents, and Services unpaid to him from his Tenants: By this course it is discerned, who be the Lords of Lands, such as if the Tenants die without Heir, or be attainted of Felony or Treason, shall have the Land by Escheat.


I now proceed, to trace out the several Parishes of 
Kent,
 and marshal them Alpha∣betically; yet in this Scrutiny, I have not tortured their Names, untill by a nice and curious Anatomie, they confessed themselves to be either of British, Roman or Saxon Extraction; because, at once to decline, and unravel this Difficulty, I have cast them into a peculiar Register by themselves, which shall stand as an Appendage to the Book, and first therefore, to go on, I begin with 
Acris.








A. A.


ACris
 is a small Parish lying in the Hundreds of 
Folkston
 and 
Lovingborough,
 and was held in the twentieth of 
William
 the Conquerour by 
Anketellus de Rosse;
 from which Name it passed away by Grant to the 
Cosentons
 of 
Cosenton
 in 
Alresford,
 to hold of the Barony of 
Rosse,
 and of his Mannor of 
Horton
 near 
Ferningham:
 This Seat being thus annexed to the Demeasn of this Family, came down to 
William de Cosington,
 who is in the List of those Kentish Gentlemen whom K. 
John
 in the eighteenth year of his Reign by pardon absolved, for having taken an Oath to 
Lewis
 the 
Dolphin
 of 
France; Charles
 King of 
Navarre
 (as the private Evidences of 
Cosington
 inform me) in the year of 
Grace
 1366. setled an annual Pension of a thousand Crowns on Sir 
Stephen de Cosington,
 and Sir 
William
 his Son, for their remarkable Service performed against the Enemies of his Crown and Scepter. The last of this Family, which held this Man∣nor, was Sir 
J. Cosington,
 who concluded in three Danghters and Coheirs about the the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, matched to Duke 
Wood,
 and 
Alexander Hamon;
 and upon the Disunion of the Estate into Parcels, the last by Female Interest, was invested in 
Acris,
 and his Successors remained Lords of the Fee untill the Beginning of K. 
James,
 and then a Fatalitie like the former, brought the Patrimony of this Fa∣mily to be possest by two Daughters and Coheirs, so that Sir 
Robert Lewknor
 having matched with 
Katharine,
 who was one of them, became in her Right entituled to this Mannor, and left it to his Son 
Hamon Lewknor
 Esq; who deceasing not long since hath transmitted it during the Minority of his Son to his Widow 
Dowager.


The Mannor of 
Brandred
 lies in this Parish, and belonged to the Abby of St. 
Radigunds,
 untill the suppression, and then it was by 
Henry
 the eighth exchanged with the Arch Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 in the twenty ninth of his Reign, and remained par∣cel of that Patrimony, which acknowledged the Signorie of that See, untill these tempestuous Times shook it off.




Addington
 in the Hundred of 
Larkfield,
 was as high as any Track of Evidence can transport me to discover, the Inheritance of a noble Family called 
Mandeville,
 and divers Deeds of a very venerable Antiquity, being without date, and now in the hands of Mr. 
Watton,
 do attest 
Roger de Mandeville
 in those elder Times to have been Lord of the Fee; but before the end of 
Edward
 the second, this Family was vanished, and had surrendred the possession of this place to 
Robert At Checquer,
 in whom the possession was but of a narrow Date, for hee not long after alienated his Interest in it to 
Nicholas Dagworth,
 as is evident by this Record registred in the Book of 
Aid
 kept in the 
Exchequer, De Nicholao de Dagworth pro uno Feodo Militis, quod Roberius de Scaccario. tenuit in Addington de Warreno de Montecanisio
 40. s. That is, 
Nicholas Dagworth
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, paid a respective Supply of 40. s. for his Mannor of 
Addington,
 which both he and 
Robert At Checquer,
 which enjoyed it before him, held of the Honour of 
Swanscamp Castle,
 as being the capital Seat of the Barony of 
Mount∣chensey,
 under the Notion of a whole Knights Fee. But in this Family the Title was a Volatile as in the former, for before the going out of 
Edward
 the third, I find it passed away from 
Dagworth
 to Sir 
Hugh Segrave,
 and he in the seventh year of 
Richard
 the second, alienated it to 
Richard Charles,
 descended from 
Edward Charles
 Captain and Admirall of the Seas, from the 
Thames
 mouth Northward, in the reign of 
Edward
 the first, as appears 
Pat.
 34. 
Edwardi primi.
 But he was scarce warm in his new Acquists, but he expired in two Daughters and Coheirs, 
Alice
 matched to 
William Snaith,
 and 
Joan
 married to 
Richard Ormeskirk;
 but this Mannor upon the Distinction of the Estate into Parcells was entwin'd with the Demeasne of 
Snaith,
 and he dyed possest of it (as the date of his Tombe in 
Addington
 Church informs me) in the year 1409. but dyed without Issue-male, so that his sole Daughter and Heir being wedded to 
Watton
 made it the Inheritance of that Family, and here have they planted themselves ever since that Alliance, and have performed many signal Services to this County by being invested with places of Trust, as Justices of the Peace, Commissioners of the Sewers, and other Officers of the like Condition, which hath much inforced and multiplied the eminent Reputation of this ancient Family.


Allington
 in the Hundred of 
Lark field
 is eminent for an ancient Castle within the Limits of it; which, as Mr. 
Darrell
 and Mr. 
Mersh
 do assert, was erected by 
William de Columbariis,
 or 
Columbers;
 and this Mr. 
Darrell,
 who was very curious in Disquisitions of this Nature, more possitively affirms, because in the eighth year of 
Henry
 the third, when (as appears by the Records of the Tower) there was an exact Survey taken of all the Castles of 
England,
 and of those who were either Proprietaries of them, or else the respective Castellans or Guardians, one of the above mentioned Family was found to be possessor of this Fortresse, and was also Lord of the Mannor, which was still annexed to the Castle; but this Name was of no long continuance in the Tenure of either, for about the latter end of 
Henry
 the third, they came to own the Signorie of Sir 
Stephen de Penchester,
 Lord Warden afterwards of the Cinque Ports, to whom and to 
Margaret
 his Wife, Daughter of the famous 
Hubert de Burgh
 Earl of 
Kent,
 King 
Edward
 the first granted a Licence in the ninth year of his Reign, as appears by the Patent-Rolls of that Time to erect a Castle, and to fortifie and embattle at 
Allington;
 so that it seems it was only before 
Fortalitium,
 some small Fortresse, and could not be marshall'd under the just Notion of a Castle, untill it had received new Symetrie and Dimensions, by those Appendages and Supplements which were added to it by this great Man; and having thus established this Pile, it came to own his Name, and is in some old Records called 
Allington Penchester,
 and not undeservedly; for in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the first, he obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of 
Allington,
 and also a Market Weekly on the Tuesday, and a Fair yearly three days, on the 
Vigil,
 the day, and day after St. 
Laurence,
 but deceased without Issue Male; so that after his 
Exit,
 it came to acknowledge 
Stephen de Cobham,
 who had married his Daugh∣ter and Coheir, and he inocculated his own Name upon it, and called it 
Allington Cobham,
 which flourished severall Descents in this Family, untill the beginning of 
Edward
 the fourth, and then I find it in the possession of 
Brent,
 but remained not long in this Name; for in the eighth year of 
Henry
 the seventh, 
John Brent
 passed away the Castle and Mannor of 
Allington
 to Sir 
Henry Wiat
 one of the Privie Councel to that

Prince, but his infortunate Grandchild Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 having by his Defection in the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 forfeited it to the Crown, it remained there untill Queen 
Elizabeth
 granted it to 
Jo. Astley
 Esq; Master of her Jewels, whose Son Sir 
Jo. Astley
 dying without Issue, it came by Descent to Sir 
Jacob Astley,
 created Lord 
Astley
 by the late King at 
Oxford,
 whose Descendant does now enjoy the Possession of it.


Alkham
 in the Hundred of 
Folkston,
 hath divers places in it of Account.


Malmains
 by vulgar Corruption of the word called 
Smalmains,
 with 
Hollmeade,
 which was ever accounted an Appendage to it, are first to be considered. In the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third I find 
Thomas de Malmains
 Son of 
Nicholas de Malmains,
 (who was Possessor of both these Places in Times of an elder Computation,) paid respective Aid at making the black Prince Knight for his Lands at 
Alkham.
 But after this I find no more intelligence given me by Record of this Family, for about the beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth I discover 
Iohn Alkham
 (who extracted his Sirname from this Parish, and it is very probable had here his Mansion, though now it have found a double Sepulcher, that of Oblivion, and its own Rubbish) to have been possest of them both, which he held in 
Castle-Guard
 Tenure of 
Dover
 Castle, and paid a subsidia∣rie Supply for them in the fourth year of that Prince, at the Marriage of 
Blanch
 his Daughter; from which temporary Assessement or Contribution, severall Parcels of Land in this County have ever since contracted the Name of 
Blanch-Lands.
 In 
Alkham
 the Signorie of both Places did reside, untill the beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then they were demised by 
Peter Alkham
 to 
Iohn Warren
 Gentleman; in which Name after they had continued untill the latter End of 
Henry
 the eighth, 
Malmains
 was passed away to 
Brown,
 who in our Memory conveyed it by Sale to 
Lushinton;
 and 
Hollmeade
 was by the same Vicissitude annexed to the Demeasn of 
Wollet,
 a Name that is grown reverend by an Efflux of many Ages both here and at 
Elham.


The Mannor of 
Hoptons,
 another place considerable in 
Alkham.
 If you will search who was in elder Times possest of it, the private date, lesse Deeds will inform you, that anciently it was the Inheritance of 
Peter de Hall,
 but was not long perma∣nent in the possession of this Name, for in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, (as appears by the Book of Aid) it was the Inheritance of 
William de Bourn;
 and here it seems the Title was more constant, for in this Family it was resident untill the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was alienated to 
Baker
 of 
Caldham,
 in whom it had not long continued, but by his Daughter and Coheir it became the Inheritance of 
Robert Brandred,
 from which Name about the latter end of 
Edward
 the fourth it passed away by Sale to 
Brown
 of 
Bechworth Castle
 in 
Surrey,
 and here it fixed, untill that Age which came within the Verge of our Grandfathers Remembrance, and then it was demised to 
Godman,
 in whose Descendants the Propriety now continues.


Evering
 is the last place of Account in 
Alkham,
 it was the possession of a Family so called which branched from the ancient Lords of 
Folkston,
 sirnamed 
Averenches,
 whose Armes were (as is manifest by ancient Armorials) 
Or
 five 
Cheverons Gules,
 and these 
Everings,
 bare 
Or
 five 
Cheverons Azure. Wolwardus de Evering
 held it under the Notion and by the Service of a whole Knights Fee, in the Time of 
Henry
 the second, of the Lords of 
Folkston.
 And by a successive Chanell of many Descents hath the Title flowed so constantly in this Family, that this Seat is at this instant annexed to their Inheritance.


In this Parish is an 
Eyle-Bourn
 which rises in the bottome at 
Dillingore,
 which the Inhabitants presage to be a fatall presage either of Death or Dearth; and in a short Distance of Time and Place, from no appearance of Head or Spring, sends forth such store of Water that a Vessell of considerable Burden may float therein; then the Wa∣ter being inforced into a Stream runs down to 
Chilton,
 and disgorges it self into that River, which meets the Sea at 
Dover.


Apuldore
 in the Hundred of 
Blackborn,
 in the year of 
Grace
 1032. was by an es∣peciall Licence first obtained from 
Canutus
 and 
Elfgiva
 his Queen, and given by 
Eadsin


Bishop of Sr. 
Martins
 without 
Canterbury,
 to the Prior and Monks of 
Christchurch, & est de cibo corum,
 says the Book of that Convent; that is, it was granted to them for a Supportation of Diet. In the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the third there was a License granted to the then Archbishop, and others by his Royall Patent, 
obsternere quendam antiquam Trencheam, quae ducit a Brachio Maris vocato Apledore versus Villam de Romney,
 those are the Words of the Record; that is, to intercept and dam up a certain Trench or Chanell which proceeds from an Arm of the Sea called 
Apledore,
 (for then it seems the Sea flow'd up to this place, though now it have wholly deserted it) and leads to the Town of 
Romney;
 But to proceed, 
Apledore
 having by the abovesaid Donation been link'd to the Ecclesiasticall Patrimony, continued wrapp'd up in that Interest, untill the Resignation of the Revenue of the Priorie of 
Christchurch,
 into the hands of K. 
Henry
 the eighth, and then he setled it by a new grant on his new erected Dean and Chapter of 
Christ Church.


Hornes place
 in this Parish was the Seat for many hundreds of years of Gentlemen of that Sirname. 
William Horne
 was one of the Conservators of the 
Peace
 in the first year of 
Richard
 the Second for this County, and 
Michael Horne
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the seventh year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and held his Shrievalty at 
Apledore,
 and from him did the proprietie of this place descend to 
Anne Horne
 the last of this Name, who matched with 
Benedict Guldford
 Esquire, who in her Right, as being the sole Inheritrix of this place, became Lord of this Seat, but he denying the Oath of Supremacy, which began about the twelfth and thirteenth of Queen 
Elizabeth
 to be tendered to Romish Recusants, and sheltring himselfe by a Recesse and Flight into forrein Parts, fell under the displeasure of the Queen, and his Estate under the Fury of a 
praemu∣nire;
 so that this Mannor was torne away from his Interest by a Confiscation of it to the Crown, and shortly after the above mentioned Princesse granted it to her faithfull Servant 
George Chowte
 Esquire, from whom it is now descended to his great Grandchild Mr. 
Edward Chowt


 Esquire, a Person who for his Support of Learning in these Times, (wherein if some whose Palates do decline it with regret and disgust, might be confirmed in that licencious Liberty which they pretend to, they would scarce leave us the Title page, to inform Posterity, that their was once Religion or Lear∣ning inhabiting amongst us,) cannot be mentioned by the Fautors and Abettors of Literature, or at least the Pretenders to it, without some grateful acknowledgment.


Dean Court
 in this Parish was the Mansion of a Family who borrowed their Sir∣name from this Town, and were called 
Apledore,
 and sealed with a Pile surmounted with a Fesse, which was their paternal Coat, but before the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, this Family found its Sepulcher in a Female Heir, for 
Thomas de Apledore,
 dying witout Issue, 
Elnith
 his only Sister entituled her husband 
William Roper
 to his Estate here, and in the confining Marsh; and by an uninterrupted Right derived from this Alliance, hath the title of this place been supported in the Family of 
Roper,
 for so many Descents, that it is now at last devolved to the right honorable 
Christopher Roper
 Baron of 
Tenham,
 in whom it is at this instant resident.


There was a Castle anciently here at 
Apledore,
 which when the 
Danes
 in the reign of 
Etheldred
 Father of 
Edmund Ironside,
 made this County the Scene of their Devastations, was mingled by the flame they put it into, in the year 892. in its own Rubbish, yet like a 
Phaenix,
 it rose into new shape and frame again, out of its Ashes, and continued in the Register and under the notion of the Castles and Fortresses of this County, until the year, 1380. and then (as 
How
 relates in his Chronicle, who likewise represents the former Tragedie,) the 
French
 making an hostile Eruption on this part of the County, made it once more a pitied and calamitous heap of flame and ruine; out of whose dis∣mantled reliques (the Church now visible was not only repaired, but as some from an∣cient Tradition affirm, wholly reedified; a probable Argument of the ancient Gran∣deur, Magnificence and Strength of this now totally-demolished Fortresse.


I had almost omitted the Mannor of 
Frenchay,
 which likewise lies within the Cir∣cle of 
Apledore,
 and had in elder Times, as appears by old evidences, Owners of that Sirname; but the greatest Glory that it atchieved, was, that ever since the reign of 
Edward
 the third, untill the Government of 
Henry
 the eighth, it acknowledged the Family of 
Haut
 for its Proprietaries, the last of which was Sir 
William Haut,
 who con∣cluded in two Daughters and Coheirs, whereof 
Joan
 the youngest matched to Sir

Thomas Wiat,
 shared his estate at this place, but he being attainted in the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 this was confiscated to the Crown, and lay there untill the twenty fourth of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was granted back to 
George Wiat
 Esquite, whose Son Sir 
Francis Wiat,
 not many years since, passed it away to 
Thomas Floyd
 of 
Gore-court
 in 
Otham
 Esquire, and he in the year 1636 alienated it to Sir 
Edward Hales
 of 
Tunstall
 Knight Baronet, whose Grandchild Sir 
Edward Hales
 is now in possession of it.


Apledore
 had anciently a Market to be observed here weekly, granted to it, by 
Edward
 the third in the thirty second year of his reign, which since is vanished into Disuse by Intermission.


Adisham
 in the Hundred of 
Downhamford,
 was given to the Monks of St. 
Augustins
 (as appears by 
Christ Church
 Book) by 
Ethelbald
 Son of 
Ethelbald
 King of 
Kent, Anno Domini
 616. 
Cum Campis, Silvis, Pascuis, &c.
 (as the Record mentions) 
ad illam pertinentibus, ad Cibum Monachorum Ecclesiae Christi Cantuariae, liberam ab omnibus servitiis, & fiscali Tributo exceptis tribus istis Consuetudinibus, id est, Communi Labore, de quo nullus excipiatur Pontis Constructione, vel Arcis;
 and whereas we frequently trace in ancient Chartularies these three Letters 
L. S. A.
 which may at first ap∣pearance seem to wrap up some gloomy and mysterious sense, they import no more but this, that Lands which were given by Charter to the Church should be 
Liberae sicut Adisham,
 that is, be fortified with the same Franchises and Liberties as 
Adisham
 Originally was. The 
Austins
 for some Hundreds of years have been Tenants for this and the Mannor of 
Godmersham
 to the Church, as if to improve and gratifie the Memory of 
Augustin
 their first Abbot the Monks of 
Christ Church
 were determined to plant some of their Patrimony in that Name, though perhaps but of accidental Coincidence.


Aldington
 is the next place to be remembred in the Hundred of 
Street,
 and 
Bircholt Franchise
 more eminent, because here are chosen the Officers yearly relating to the Mannors of 
Romney Mersh.
 Queen 
Edgiva
 mother to King 
Edmund,
 and King 
Edred
 gave this Town to 
Christ Church
 in 
Canterbury,
 in Grosse with other Lands 
Anno Dom.
 961. But in the General Survey of the Churches Lands in the Conquerours Time, the Arch-Bishops had twenty one Sullings or Plough-Lands there, and was valued together with the Appurtenances at 
Stouting
 and 
Lyming
 at 107 
l.
 and 25 Burgesses held of it. The Arch-Bishops of 
Canterbury,
 did usually retire to their Mannor-house here, and had both a Park empailed, and a Chase for Deer, called 
Aldington Frith,
 by which Name we express Places where Deer ranged at large, as in a Forrest. But when the Kings of 
England
 intended to pare off something of the Revenue and Power of the Arch-Bishops, which was in their Estimate of too vast and wide an Extent; this Mannor, with many other, was passed away by Exchange to the Crown in the twenty ninth of 
Henry
 the eighth, by 
Thomas Cranmer
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury.


Ruffins-Hill
 in this Parish, was the Seat of the 
Godfrey
's ancient Gentlemen, whose Estate by two Daughters and Coheirs came to the 
Clerks
 of 
Kingsnoth,
 and the 
Blechen∣dens.
 But whether descended from 
Godfrey le Falconer
 the Son of 
Balder,
 unto whom K. 
Henry
 the second assigned, gave, and granted much Land in these Parts, to hold in Serjeantie, by the Service of keeping two Hawks for the King and his Successors, I cannot positively say. Much of the Land lay in 
Hurst,
 and the Mannor is called 
Falconers Hurst;
 and those that for many Generations held it, resolved into the Name of 
Michel-Grove;
 whose Heir General brought this and other fair Demeasns to 
Shelley
's Ancestor of 
Michel-Grove,
 in whose Name it resides at present. The Coat very well alluded to their ancient Name and Tenure, and is Quarterly 
Argent
 and 
Azure
 over all a 
Falcon Or. Hurst
 was formerly a Parish; and the Church was dedicated to St. 
Leonard,
 but it is now languished into Decay and Ruine, and the Inhabitants assemble for the Performance of divine Offices at 
Aldington.


Ainsford
 in the Hundred of 
Axtane
 lieth upon the River of 
Darent,
 and gave Seat and Sirname to a worthy Family that continued till the Time of 
Edward
 the second:

It hath the Ruines of an ancient Castle, which reckons them and the 
Arsicks
 to have been the Founders.


There is another Seat in this Parish of venerable Antiquity, called, 
Arkesden,
 whose owners bore the same for their Sirname, and were of the Number of the Grand Assise in King 
John
's Time; after them the 
Cobhams
 were possessors of it, and 
Reginald de Cobham
 had License the fourteenth of 
Edward
 the third, to Castelate his House, and paid respect of Aid for the same the twentieth of 
Edward
 the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight: From the 
Cobhams
 of 
Sterborough
 it came by the Heir General to the Lord 
Burgh
 or 
Borough,
 from whom by Sale it devolved its Right on Sir 
Samuel Leonard
 Father of Sir 
Stephen Leonard,
 which Sir 
Stephen
 enjoys it at this Day.


Southcourt
 and 
Mayfield
 are two Mannors lying in the Precincts of this Parish, and did anciently relate to the Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 from whom by exchange they passed over to 
Dunham,
 and from that Family to the 
Wiats,
 in which Name and Family they remained, till upon the Attainder of Sir 
Thomas Wiat
 they escheated to the Crown, which by Grant invested their Right and Interest in 
J. Leonard
 of 
Chevening,
 from whom they are now come down to be the Possession of Sir 
Stephen Leonard
 of 
West Wickham.


There is yet another ancient Seat within the Verge of this Village, whose Name is 
Maplescombe,
 and partly is situated in this, and partly in 
Kingsdown.
 This place although it now carry a desolate Aspect by reason of its Ruine and Depopulation, was anciently of a high Repute and Estimate. 
William de Chellerfield
 (he whom I suppose lies enter'd in 
Halsted
 Church) held it (as 
Testa de Nevil
 informs me,) in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third, but his Family had not been possest of it untill the latter End of 
Edward
 the second, when the Vicissicude of Sale carried the Title off to 
Rokesley
 of 
Rokesley
 in 
North-Crey,
 and 
Roger
 the Son of 
Thomas de Rokesley
 held the Lordship by a whole Knights Fee in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, of 
Richard de Rosse
 of 
Horton Kerkbie,
 and he held it of the Successor of 
Robert de Arsick,
 and he of the King; yet I find some part of it to have acknow∣ledged the Signorie of the Family of 
Merworth,
 for 
Roger de Merworth
 in the eighteenth year of 
Edward
 the first; obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Lands at this place; and in the fortieth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
John de Merworth,
 this Mans Grandchild, was by purchase wholly invested in the Possession, and held it at his Decease, which was in the forty ninth year of that Prince, and 
John de Malmains
 was his Heir, who passed it away to 
Nicholas de Brember,
 of whom I shall speak more at 
Merworth;
 and he being attainted in the tenth year of 
Richard
 the second, there was a return made in the twelfth of that Prince, that he held this Mannor at his Conviction, upon which that Prince in the thirteenth year of his Reign grants it to 
John de Hermensthorpe,
 and he not long after passed it away to 
Richard Fitz-Allen
 Earl of 
Arundel,
 and his Son 
Thomas
 Earl of 
Arundel
 dying without Issue Male 1416. 
Joan
 one of his Sisters and Coheits brought it to be the Possession of her Husband 
Will. Beauchamp
 Baron of 
Abergavenny,
 whose Son likewise dying without Issue Male in the ninth of 
Henry
 the fifth, 
Elizabeth
 his sole Inheritrix united it to the Patrimony of 
Edward Nevil,
 and in his Descendants did the Title remain, untill our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was conveyed to 
Lovelace,
 and is now by 
Margaret
 Sole Heir of 
Richard Lovelace
 annexed to the Demeasn of Mr. ....... 
Cooke
 of 
Lanham
 in 
Suffolk.


Easthall
 in this Parish was parcel of the Revenue of 
Rokesley
 of 
Rokesley,
 but when Sir 
Richard de Rokesley
 determined with the Name in a Female Inheritrix, She, by matching with Sir 
Thomas de Poynings,
 entituled that Name to the Proprietie and Jurisdiction of this place, in which Family it continued untill the fourteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it being found after a serious Inquisition, that Sir 
Edward Poynings,
 who deceased the twelfth year of that Princes Government, had neither lawful Issue, nor any Collateral Alliance, which could start a Title to his Estate, it escheated to the Crown in, whose Demeasn this Mannor was locked up untill King 
Henry
 the eighth granted it to Sir 
Roger Cholmeley,
 who sud∣denly alienated his Interest here to Sir 
Martin Bowes;
 and he the first year of 
Edward
 the sixth, conveyed it again to 
Percival Hart
 of 
Lullingston
 Esquire, in

whose Successor, Mr. 
William Hart
 of 
Lullingston
 Esquire, the Title is now resident.


Littlemote
 and 
Petham
 are two Mannors likewise in this Parish, which augmented the Revenue of 
Sibell,
 a Family of deep Antiquity as any in this Track, who were for many Hundred years possest of 
Petham,
 and of the House which is called 
Little∣mote
 likewise, as is evident by their Coat Armour 
viz.
 a Tiger viewing himself in a Mirrour, or Spigel, both carved and embossed very anciently in Wood, as like∣wise represented to the view in old coloured Glass, though much of the Land that relates to this Mansion devolved to 
Sibel
 about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, by the Heir of 
Cowdale,
 whose Arms, 
viz. Arg.
 a 
Cheveron, Gules
 between three 
Bulls Heads Cabosed Sables,
 both empailed and quartered with this Family, are yet visible in many Places of the House; finally, after these two Places had so many Descents been fastned to this Family, they came down at last to 
John Sibel
 Esquire, who concluded in a Female Heir called 
Elizabeth,
 matched to Mr. 
Robert Bosvil
 An∣cestor to 
Thomas Bosvil
 Esquire, who in Right of this Alliance is now Heir ap∣parent to the Signorie of them.


There is one part of the Church is called 
Arsicks Chancel,
 and divers Lands here∣abouts are held of the Honour of 
Arsick
 by Knights Service, and 
Robert de Arsick
 that came in with 
William
 the Conqueror, was one of those that were Assistants to 
John de Fiennes
 for the securer Guard of 
Dover.
 Castle. He had eighteen Knights Fees assigned to him, of which these lay in 
Kent, viz. Fremingham (idest) Farningham,
 one Knights Fee, 
Mayplescombe
 one Knights Fee, 
Nutstted
 in 
Kent
 one Knights Fee, 
Combe
 in 
Kent
 one Knights Fee, 
Bekewel
 in 
Kent
 one Knights Fee. The rest lay most in 
Oxfordshire,
 and some in 
Dorset, Wilts,
 and 
Lincolnshire.
 In the Reign of 
Henry
 the second, 
Ma∣nasser de Arsick
 was of eminent Note in the County of 
Oxford,
 and Mr. 
Camden
 in describing that County, affirms the principal Seat of their Barony to be at 
Coggs,
 and that the Daughter and Heir was married to 
Hubert de Burgo,
 who was Earl of 
Kent.


Alhallows
 in the Hundred of 
Hoo,
 with the appendant Mannor of 
Shawsted,
 did an∣ciently celebrate the Memory of 
Delapole; John De la Pole
 held it in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and paid a respective supply for it at making the Black Prince Knight, and in this Family was the possession permanent untill the Reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then it was transmitted by sale to 
Zouch
 of 
Haringworth,
 writ∣ten in ancient Court Rolls and other Muniments 
De la Zouch;
 and here the Title was resident untill it was by Descent wafted along to 
John
 Lord 
De la Zouch,
 who being a great Assertor of the Cause and Quarrel of 
Richard
 the third against 
Henry
 the seventh, like some noble Fabrick, in whose Joints the Raine hath dwelt, and supplanted the Contextures of its Pillars, fell under the Misfortune of his Royal Master, and sunk in the Ruines of the fatal Field of 
Bosworth,
 and in the first year of 
Henry
 the seventh, being attainted by Parliament, his Patrimony escheated to the Crown, and then that Prince granted his Estate here to his faithful Partisan, Sir 
Henry Wiat,
 whom he had newly taken into his private Councels, and from him did it successively come down to his Grandchild Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 whose Estate here was much improved and augmented by the Addition of 
Windlehill,
 another Mannor in this Parish, which as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 82. did in the forty seventh year of 
Edward
 the third, belong to the Abbot of 
Reding,
 and upon the suppression of that Cloister, by 
Henry
 the eighth, was by his liberal Concession made Parcel of his In∣heritance, and remained so until the Reign of Q. 
Mary,
 and then being attainted and convicted of High Treason in the second year of that Princess, his Estate here fell back to the Crown, and continued there untill K. 
James
 in the Beginning of his Reign passed away 
Shawsted
 and 
Windlehill
 to the City of 
London,
 and they again by their Trustees invested the Propriety of them by Sale in Sir 
William Garaway
 of 
Lon∣don,
 Father to Sir 
Henry Garaway
 Knight, in whose Descendants the Title of them is still resident.


Place House
 in this Parish is secondly to be remembred, which was anciently part of the Demeasn of the illustrious Family of the 
Pimps
 of 
Pimps Court
 in the Pa∣rish of 
Loose
 near 
Maidston,
 and 
Philip de Pimp
 was one of those Men at Arms which the Prior of 
Rochester
 was to furnish out for the Guard of the Seacoast at

Genlade
 or 
Yenlade
 in the Hundred of 
Hoo,
 in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the third. In Times of a more modern Inscription I find 
Thomas Pimpe
 the elder to be Buried in 
Alhollows
 in 
Hoo,
 and that he made his Will the twenty seventh of 
August,
 (as appears by the Repertorie of 
Rochester
 Diocess,) and in the fourteenth of 
Edward
 the fourth, 
William
 and 
John
 were his Sons. 
Elizabeth
 unmaried, 
Margery
 Lady Prioress of 
Malling,
 and 
Alice
 a Nun there, Sir 
William Hampton
 about that Time bought much Land of him; He (I mean this Sir 
William
 was Lord Maior of 
London
 in the Time of 
Edw
rd
 the fourth,) but whether this Place was part of this Purchase or not, there is no Light from any publick Intelligence can illustate it, certain I am that the 
Coppingers
 imediately almost after this Time became possessors of the Place, and the Proprietie is now by Female Right of a Daughter and Heir of a Branch of these 
Coppingers
 resolved into Sir 
Harbotle Grimston
 of 
Essex.


Alresford
 anciently written 
Aiglesford
 hath Places of considerable Animadversion within the Limits and Boundaries of it. The Priory or rather now the Skeleton of it, was founded by 
Richard
 Lord 
Grey
 of 
Codnor, Anno Dom.
 1240, in the twenty fifth of 
Henry
 the third for 
Carmelite
 or 
White Friers
 in Honour of the Virgin 
Mary;
 the Mother of this Lord was 
Isolda
 Daughter and Coheir of 
Hugh Bardolph
 Lord of 
Hoo
 in 
Kent,
 from whom he inherited fair Possessions in this County: And many of his Posterity, in Relation to that Particular, were buried in the Conventual Church of this Monastery. Upon the suppression it was granted with the Royalty of it by 
Henry
 the eighth to Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 from whom it descended to his Son Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 upon whose Defection, this being with other Lands escheated to the Crown, Queen 
Elizabeth
 granted it to Mr. 
J. Sidley,
 and he bequeathed to his Brother Sir 
Will. Sidley,
 and from that Name it was lately passed by Sale unto Sir 
Peter Ricaut,
 whose Heir 1657, conveyed it by the same Vicissitude to Mr. 
Caleb Banks
 of 
Maidston.


Tottington
 and 
Eccles
 two Mannors in this Parish,

 anciently belonged to the Family of 
Rokesley,
 of whose Heir General it came to of 
Poynings,
 and 
Richard
 Lord 
Poynings;
 the eleventh of 
Rich.
 the second, held the Mannor of 
Tottington,
 which with 
Eccles
 one of his Ancestors in the Time of King 
Henry
 the sixth, gave in frank Marriage with his Daughter to 
J. Palmer
 of the 
Courtlodge
 in 
Snodland
 Esquire; whose Posterity after they had held them some space of Time, sold them to 
Warcup,
 descended from the 
Warcups
 of 
Cumberland,
 in which Name the Tenure was not long resident, for by Sale it was alienated to 
Sidley
 of 
Southfleet,
 and his Successor suddenly after by the like Fatalitie invested 
Ricaut
 in 
Eccles,
 and 
Madox
 in 
Tottington.


Cosington
 is a Seat of much Eminence in this Parish, and gave Residence and Sir-name to a Knightly Familie of the same. And King 
Edward
 the first rewarded Sir 
Stephen de Cosenton
 whom he had made Banneret in the twenty eighth of his Reign, for his signal Service at 
Carlaverock
 in 
Scotland,
 with a Charter of Free Warren to all his Lands at 
Cosenton Acris,
 and 
South-Burton
 vulgarly called 
South-Blabden
 in 
Elham
 in 
Kent.
 The Mannor it self holdeth by Knights Service of the Barony of 
Rosse
 of 
Horton Kirbie,
 from whom they received it by ancient Feoffement, and bear in similitude of their Lords the 
Rosses,
 the same Charge in their Arms, 
viz. Azure
 three 
Roses Or.
 The Arms of 
Rosse
 being 
Or
 three 
Roses Gules;
 But when in the Beginning of 
Hen.
 the eighths Government, the Fatality of Time had concluded this Family in three Daugh∣ters and Coheirs married to 
Duke, Hamon,
 and 
Wood;
 this Mannor of 
Cosenton
 accrued by Co-partition to 
Duke,
 in which Name it hath ever since resided. There was a 
Free Chappel
 belonging to this Mansion founded, as private Evidences advertise me, by Sir 
Stephen de Cosenton,
 which is now crumbled into so desolate an Heap of Rubbish, that we can hardly trace out its Ruines even amidst its Ruines. There was another 
Free Chappel
 in his Parish annexed to 
Tottington
 by 
Richard
 Lord 
Poynings
 in the eleventh year of 
Rich.
 the second, which hath been so dismantled by the impressions of Time, and the fury of the Elements, that there is very little Testimony or Evidence re∣maining that this Oratorie ever had a Being.


Preston
 in this Parish of 
Alresford
 is a Seat of that venerable Antiquity, and hath for so many Descents been incorporated into the Demeasn of 
Colepeper,
 that it is questionable which is the ancient Cradle or Seminary of this Family either 
Bayhall
 in 
Pepenbury,
 or 
Preston
 in 
Alresford;
 Sir 
Thomas Colepeper
 as the old Evidences and

Muniments of this Name instruct me, was of this Family, and was Governour of 
Winchelsey
 under 
Edward
 the second, by whom he was beheaded for defending that Town in behalf of the Barons then combined in an hostile League against him: 
Walter de Colepeper
 flourished under 
Edward
 the first and 
Edward
 the second, and seal'd with a 
Bend engrailed,
 which is still the paternal Coat-Armour of this Family; which I the rather mention, because these Deeds are the first of that Nature which I have seen since Sealing with Coats of Arms grew customary in this Nation, and argues him to be a Man of eminence in this County, as did that spreading Revenue likewise of which he died possest, not onely here, but at 
Farleigh, Peckham, Wrotham,
 and divers other places, in the first year of 
Edward
 the third. 
John Colepeper
 was a Judge in the Reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, and concluded in a Daughter and Heir, who by matching with 
Harrington,
 added a considerable Supplement to the paternal Revenue of that noble Family. I shall not more dilate my self in this Discourse, it is enough that I inform the Reader, that this ancient Seat which hath been for so many Centuries of years under the Signorie of this Name, is yet so constant to the Interest of this Family, that it is at this instant knit to the Inheritance of Sir 
Richard Colepeper
 Knight and Baronet.


Roes Place
 in 
Alresford
 pretends to a deep Root in Antiquity likewise, as being the Seat and Original of the ancient Family of 
Roe,
 and from hence the 
Roes
 of 
Chafford
 in 
Ashurst,
 those of 
Essex,
 and he that was Lord Maior of 
London,
 have primitively in a full Channel flowed out; and in this Family was the possession lodged, untill that Age we style our Grandfathers, and then it was carried off by Sale to 
Taylor;
 which Family not many years since concluding in a Female Inheritrix, She by matching with 
Warcup,
 hath espoused the possession of this place to that Name and Family.


Near this place, 
Vortimer
 the valiant British King gave Battle to 
Hengist
 the Saxon, after he had given a Victorious overthrow to the Britons at 
Creyford;
 in which conflict 
Horsa
 and 
Catigern,
 Brethrento both the Generals, were stain, and the Saxons repulsed into the Isle of 
Thanet,
 their first assigned Habitation, not daring to enter and reinvade the Continent whilest 
Vortimer
 survived. 
Catigern
 was interr'd in that Plain which spreads it self on the Hanging of that Hill, which looks down on 
Cosenton,
 where to this Day his Monument remains, being four vast Stones pitched somewhat after the Mannor of 
Stonehenge
 on 
Salisbury
 Plain, but of greater Breadth then they, though not so thick or long, whereby it ap∣pears like a small Sheepcote, and is vulgarly styled 
Cits-Cotehouse,
 which is graphically here intitated. The like Monument was erected for 
Horsa
 at 
Horsted
 near 
Rochester
 which storms and Tempests under the Conduct of Time have utterly extinguished.

Ash
 by 
Sandwich
 lies in the Hundred of 
Wingham,
 and contains many Places within its Precincts very considerable. The first is 
Welmestone,
 which is situated partly in this Parish, and partly in 
Wingham.
 Though it be now obscure, it was in elder Times made more conspicuous, by being one of the Seats of Residence of the Noble Family of 
Septuans, William de Septnans
 or 
Sepuans
 was in the possession of it at his Death, which was in the twenty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Ese. Num.
 5. and in this Family did the Title of this place by the steps of several Descents pass along untill the latter End of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it went from this Family by Exchange for other Land to Sir 
Walter Henley,
 who not long after conveyed the Demeasn Land or Mansion-House to 
Alday,
 and the Mannor it self to 
Solley;
 in 
Alday
 the demised premises had not been long resident, when they were sold to Mr. 
Benedict Barnham,
 by one of whose four Coheirs, the Fee-Simple de∣volved to the Earl of 
Castlehaven,
 whose descendant conveyed it to 
Brigham.




Goshall
 in this Parish must not be forgotten, it was the Residence anciently of a Family of that Sirname, made more eminent by the production of Sir 
John Goshall
 a worthy Knight, who flourished in the Reign of 
Edward
 the third and 
Richard
 the second, and lyes entombed in 
Ash Church,
 in compleat Armour, and his Skeleton underneath, his Arms are also depicted in his Shield, viz. 
Azure
 a 
Lyon Ram∣pant
 within 
Semeè
 of 
Crosse Crosselets Argent.
 The Heir Generall of this Family was wedded to St. 
Nicholas
 of the Isle of 
Thanet,
 and after the Title had for some Ages setled in this Family, it was by a Daughter and Heir transmitted to 
John Dynley
 Esquire, whose Descendant about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth
 conveyed it to 
Roper,
 Ancestor to 
Christopher Roper
 Baron of 
Tenham,
 who hath lately alienated his Interest in it to Sir 
Edw. Monins.


Checquers
 in this Parish of 
Ash,
 was a very ancient Seat of a Branch of the Family of 
Septuans,
 who from their Residence here, contracted the Sirname of 
Checquer
 or 
Atchecquer,
 and so were stiled in severall old Records; and after this Mansion had re∣mained a Series of some Generations in the Name of 
Septuans
 and 
Checquer,
 it shrunk into a Daughter and Heir matched with 
Alday;
 in which Family, after it had some Time resided it was by Sale lately passed away to Mr. 
Tho. Harfleet,
 and now owns his Descendants for its instant Possessors.


Hells Twitham
 is swoln up to some Repute since it was the Revenue of the 
Hells,
 a Family of generous Rank in this County, but stayed not long in the possession, for about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the third, they had surrendered their Interest to 
Twitham,
 a noble Family, and of deep Extraction, in this Teritory; 
Bertram de Twitham
 died possest of it in the third year of 
Edward
 the third; 
Alanus de Twitham
 his Son was likewise found invested in it at his Decease, which was in the twenty fifth year of the abovesaid Prince; and lastly, 
Alanus
 the Son of 
Theobald Twitham
 held it in the fourth year of 
Richard
 the second, and left it to 
Mawd
 his sole Daughter and Heir, by whom the Title was transplanted into 
Simon Septuans,
 in whose Family the Proprietie hath for many Ages, even untill this instant, by an unbroken Link been seated.


The next place which obviates my Discovery, is 
Overland,
 the which in the twenty fifth year of 
Henry
 the third, was by the Royall Charter of that Prince granted to 
Bertram de Crioll,
 and so being made Parcell of his Demeasne, it remained fastned to his Interest untill the Beginning of 
Edward
 the first, and then it was passed away to 
Leybourn,
 and was held by 
Juliana de Leybourn,
 the Heir generall of 
Roger
 Lord 
Leybourn;
 who in relation to that vast Patrimony her Birth intituled her to, might be justly stiled the 
Infanta
 of 
Kent,
 and shee was first espoused to 
John de Hastings,
 and secondly to 
William de Clinton
 Earl of 
Huntington,
 who held it at his Death in her Right, which was in the twenty eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, but shee deceased without Issue, in the forty third year of the abovesaid Prince, by either of them, and there being none, that by the strength of any Collaterall Alliance, could pretend any Interest or Title to the Estate, it escheared to the Crown, and lay there untill 
Richard
 the second bestowed it by Grant on Sir 
Simon de Burley
 Knight of the Garter, and Lord Warden of the Cinque-Ports; but he being attainted in the tenth year of that King, it returned to the Crown again, and then it was by the the same Prince setled on the Abby of 
Childrens Langley,
 and was involved in the Patrimony of that Cloister, untill the generall Suppression in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was granted in the thirty fifth year of that Prince to Sir 
Thomas Moile
 and Sir 
Walter Henley,
 and they not long after conveyed their joynt Interest in it to 
Harfleet,
 Who almost in our Fathers Remembrance alienated it to 
Bargrave,
 from whom the same devolution brought it over to 
Solley,
 who not many years after transmitted it by Sale to Mr. 
Jo. Ward
 of 
London,
 whose Widow, Mrs. 
Katharin Ward
 now holds it in Right of 
Dower.


Goldstanton
 in this Parish is a second place of Note, and was as high as the Beam of any Evidence will guide me to discover the Patrimony of 
Leybourn, Roger de Ley∣bourn,
 who was in the Register of those Kentish Gentlemen who were pardoned by the Pacification, called 
Dictum de Kenelworth,
 for seeking to support with seditious Arms the Cause and Quarrell of 
Simon de Montfort,
 held it in the fiftieth year of 
Henry
 the third, and from him did it descend to his great Grandchild 
Juliana de Leybourn,
 who

dying without Issue or Alliance in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third, this with 
Overland
 escheated to the Crown, but was granted out again by 
Richard
 the second to Sir 
Simon de Burley,
 who being attainted and convicted of high Treason in the tenth year of his Reign, that Prince link'd it by a new Donation to the Abby of 
Childrens Langley.
 But yet I find that in the Reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, 
Richard Cliderow
 (who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the fourth year and most part of the fith year of that Prince, and then again in the sixth year of 
Hen.
 the fifth,) held it I suppose only as a Lessee, and kept his Shrivealty at this Place; a Man he was of no contemptible Account in those Times, as I shall discover more amply at little 
Betshanger
 which was his capital Seat. But to return, after this Mannor had made its aboad in the Demeasne of the above mentioned Covent, untill the Dissollution in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, it was then torn off, and granted to 
Tho.
 Lord 
Cromwell
 Earl of 
Essex,
 upon whose Attaint, in the thirty second year of the above said Prince it escheated back to the Crown, and then it was granted in the thirty fourth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, to 
Vincent Engham
 Esquire, whose Descendant Sir 
Tho. Engham,
 some few years transplanted his Con∣cernment in it by Sale into Mr. ......... 
Courcelis
 of 
London.


Nevills Fleet
 in this Parish was more anciently called 
Butlers Fleet,
 as being parcell of the Revenue of that Family, and the Book of 
Aid
 in the Exchequer, which makes an enumeration of the ancient Owners, mentions one 
Richard de Boteler,
 to have been its ancient Possessor; but in the twentienth year of 
Edward
 the third, when that Book was taken, 
William
 Lord 
Latimer
 of 
Corbie,
 Knight of the Garter, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports held it; and in the thirty eighth ob∣tained by the Charter of that Prince, a Market to be held at 
Ark
 on the Thursday, and a three days Fair at our Lady Day; and from him, as in divers Records it is evi∣dent, did it acquire the Name of 
Latimers Fleet,
 but stayed not long under that Title, for he determined in 
Eleanor
 his Daughter and Heir matched to 
John
 Lord 
Nevill,
 who in her Right became Lord of this Mannor, and from him did it contract the Title of 
Nevils Fleet,
 and lay couched in the Patrimony of this Name untill the Beginning of 
Edward
 the fourth, and then it was alienated to 
Cromer,
 and 
James Cromer
 in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the seventh, alienated it to 
John Isaac,
 from whom not long after it was brought over by Purchase to 
Kendall,
 and in that Name it fixed, untill the Beginninig of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was alienated to Sir 
John Fogge,
 and he before the end of that Prince conveyed it to 
Ralph,
 in which Name it was resident untill the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was demised to 
Spracklin,
 and Sir 
Adam Spracklin
 almost in Times under our Fathers Cognisance passed it away to 
Harfleet,
 in which Family you may at this instant find it.


Molands
 in this Parish gave Seat and Sirname to a Family so called, who before the end of 
Edward
 the second were worn out, and then it became the possession of 
Harfleet, aliás Septuans,
 who much improved the House with additional Buildings, where the Arms of this Family do stand yet in 
Panes
 of very old coloured Glasse, with this Motto annexed, 
Dissipabo inimicos Regis mei ut paleam;
 alluding either to their Coat, which was 
three Fans,
 such as they fan and winnow Corn with, or else to 
William de Septuans,
 who dyed in the year 14011. and warred, as the Records of this Family inform me under 
Edward
 the third in 
France,
 and by his Will registred in the Prerogative Office at 
Canterbury,
 which I mention for the Novelty of it, he gives Manumission or Freedome to diverse of his Slaves or Natives; and Sir 
William Septuans
 was his Son, who lyes buryed in 
Christ Church
 in 
Canterbury,
 and as his 
Epi∣taph
 on his Tomb instructs me, dyed in the year 1448. and from him did the Title stream in this Name, untill the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then I find this Seat in the possession of 
Robert Read;
 but it was not long out of the Name, for about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 I find it reinvested again in 
Harfleet,
 and remains an eminent Mansion of this Family at present.


Many of this Sirname lye buryed in 
Ash
 Church, for those three Altar Tombs in the Church yard, and those on each side the North Dore, were the Repositories or Exchequers, that treasured up the Remains of divers of this Family, all which had their Figures and Arms insculp'd in Brasse, annexed to their Sepulchers, which by the impression of Times, and the Assaults of Sacrilegious Hands are quite dismantled, and torn off.




Wingham Barton
 is another eminent Mannor in this Parish, which belonged to the Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury;
 and when 
John Peckham
 founded his Colledge at 
Wingham
 in the year 1282. there was an Exhibition setled on that Seminary or Bro∣therhood, issuing out of this Manuor, from whence it is supposed by some it con∣tracted the Name of 
Wingham Barton;
 though I rather conjecture it was called so from its Situation, in opposition to another of that Name, called 
Firmins Barton,
 ly∣ing by 
Canterbury.
 But to proceed, this continued Archiepiscopal, untill the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was exchanged by 
Thomas
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 with the Crown, and rested there, untill Q. 
Elizabeth
 granted it to Sir 
Roger Manwood,
 whose son Sir 
Peter Manwood
 passed it away by his Trustees not many years since to Sir 
William Curteen
 of 
London,
 and he gave it in Dower with his daughter matched to 
Henry
 late Earle of 
Kent,
 who upon his decease ordered it to be sold to discharge some Debts, and was accordingly not long since by his Countess con∣veyed by Sale to Mr. 
James Thurbarne
 of 
Sandwich,
 one of the Cinque Ports, Son of 
James Thurbarne
 Esquire, a Justice of Peace in this County in the Reign of K. 
James,
 whose Ancestors from 1331 have continued very eminent in the Cinque Ports, espe∣cially in 
Hasting
 and 
Romney,
 as also in 
Romney Mersh,
 as appears by divers ancient Records. But the ancient Mannor-House was in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the sixth granted to Sir 
Anthony St. Leger,
 and his Descendant Sir 
Anthony St. Leger
 of 
Boughton,
 about the Beginning of King 
Charles
 passed it away to Mr. 
Vincent Denn
 of 
Wenderton,
 who gave it to his Nephew Mr. 
Thomas Denn,
 and he by Testa∣ment setled it on his Brother Mr. 
John Denn,
 who dying without Issue bequeathed it to be shared by his four Sisters, by whom it is designed to be sold to pay Debts and Legacies.


Chilton
 lies likewise in 
Ash,
 and claims our Remembrance, because it yielded a Seat, and afforded a Sirname to 
William de Chilton,
 who held it at his Decease, which was in the thirty first year of 
Edw.
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 19. But after his 
Exit,
 it dwelt not long in his Name; for in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
William Baude
 died seised of it, as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 25. And here again the Title was as fickle, and un∣stable, for in the thirty seventh year of 
Edward
 the third, I find the possession was departed from 
Baude,
 and cast into the Patrimony of 
Thomas Wolton,
 who at that Time held it at his Death. 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 13. But after this Family went out, I find the Inheritance more fixed and permanent, for by divers old Court-Rolls that were taken in the latter End of 
Edward
 the third, I discover 
William de Septuans
 whose successors were since called 
Harfleet,
 to be possest of it, and from him is the Propriety drawn through the successive Series of many Descents to the 
Harfleets
 of this Age, who are still entituled to the Signory of it.


Hells
 is in the Register also of those Mannors which are within the Circle of this Parish, and gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of no shallow Antiquity in this Tract; 
Thomas de Hells
 obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Mannor of 
Hells
 in the eighteenth year of 
Edward
 the first; 
Bertram de Hells
 was Lieuetenant of 
Dover
 Castle in the Reign of 
Edward
 the second, under 
Reginald
 Lord 
Cobham,
 Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Constable of 
Dover
 Castle: 
Gilbert de Hells
 of 
Hells Court,
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the thirtieth of 
Edward
 the third, and in this Name did the Proprietie lodge untill the Reign of 
Edward
 the fourth, and then it was by sale transplanted into 
Wroth;
 and the Title there setled untill the latter End of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then it was by the same Vicissitude carried off to 
Peake,
 where the instant Inheritance is resident.


Laverocks
 is another Seat in 
Ash,
 possest by Worthy Men of that Name, one of them lies buried Cross legged on the 
North
-side of the Quire, with his Arme placed on his Shield; finally, after this Family had for Descents been Proprietaries of this place, it came to be possest by 
Anthony Laverock
 who deceased with∣out Issue Male, so that his Estate here came the eighteenth of 
Henry
 the seventh by 
Parnel
 his Daughter and Heir, to be possest, by 
Edward Monins
 Esquire, and they both not long after passed it away to 
Peake,
 in whose Posterity and Name, the Title is yet remaining.


Fleet
 is the last Mannor in 
Ash,
 which is ennobled by having as (high as any Track of Record can guide us to a Discovery) the Earls of 
Oxford
 for Proprietaries; 
Hugh de Vere


Earl of 
Oxford
 held it at his Death, which was in the forty eighth year of 
Henry
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 26. After him it came down to 
Robert de Vere
 Earl of 
Oxford,
 his Son, and he likewise enjoyed it at his Departure, which was in the twenty fourth year of 
Edw.
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 62. In the fifth year of 
Edw.
 the third 
Robert de Vere
 Earl of 
Oxford,
 was possessed of it at his Decease; 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 71. In Ages of a nearer Approach unto us, 
Robert de Vere
 Duke of 
Ireland
 and Earl of 
Oxford
 held it, but he attempting to support the waning and declining Prerogative of 
Richard
 the second against the Assaults which some of the potent Nobility endevoured to make upon it, in the tenth year of that Princes Government, was ruined in a Battle commenced near 
Burford,
 after which he attempting to decline the Fury of that Field by Flight, was infortunately drowned. After whose untimely Decease this Mannor being folded up in the rest of his Estate, was seised upon as forfeited to the Crown in the sixteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc.
 34. 
Parte secunda.
 But it seems it was restored by 
Henry
 the fourth, for 
Matilda
 this Mans Mother, wife of 
Thomas
 Earl of 
Oxford
 held it at her Death, which was in the fourteenth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 17. from it passed along to 
John
 Earl of 
Oxford,
 who so vigorously asserted the Interest of the House of 
Lancaster
 at the Battle of 
Barnet,
 where his Valour was ruinous to him, for his Army was discomfited, and the great Leader of that Day, the Earl of 
Warwick,
 disdaining to out-live so black and finister a Mis-fortune, found his Sepulcher in the Carnage of that Field, but he was reserved for better Times, having provided for his safety by a timely Escape; he was afterwards attainted in the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 28. and this Mannor as an Escheat annexed to the Royal Revenue, where it made its abode untill the first year of K. 
Henry
 the seventh, and then that Prince after 
Bosworth
 Field (where he obtained both the Crown and Victory together, prin∣cipally by the Courage and Conduct of the above mentioned Earl) restored this Mannor to this worthy Person, as a guerdon of so great Obligations; and in this Family did it afterwards without any Interruption continue untill the Beginning of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and then 
Gurson,
 which was a principal part of it, was sold by 
John
 Earl of 
Oxford,
 to 
Hamon,
 and the Residue of this Mannor to 
Peyton
 and 
Harfleet;
 in which Families the Interest of this Mannor thus resolved and split into Parcels is at this instant resident.


Richborough
 Castle called sometimes 
Ratesborough,
 though now it be onely eminent by those majestick Ruines, which at distance court the Eye of the Beholder; yet in Ages of a more reverend Inscription, it was of more considerable Account. 
Ausonius
 in his Poems mentions one 
Flavius Sanctius,
 who was Commander in Chief of this Fortress, as appears by this Distich.




Militiam nullo qui Turbine sedulus egit,


Praeside laelatus quo Rutupinus Ager.




And in another Distich he Records the Death of his Uncle 
Contentus,
 who paid the last Debt he owed to Nature at this Place, upon whose Ashes he drops this Memorial.




Et Patruos Elegia meos reminiscere Cantus,


Contentum Tellus quem Rutupina tegit.




If you will hear more of this Castle, I shall represent it to you as 
Leland
 describes it in the thirtieth year of 
Hen.
 the eighth, at which Time he visited several Parts of this County: The Site of the old Town or Castle (sayes he) is wonderful fair upon a Hill, the Walls which remain there yet be in compass about almost as much as the Tower of 
London,
 they have been very high, thick, strong, and well embattled, the Matter of them is Flint, marvailous and long Bricks, both white and red, of the British Fashion; The Ciment was made of the Sea, and small pibble. There is a great likelyhood that the goodly Hill about the Castle, and especially towards 
Sandwich
 hath been well inhabited, Corn gr
ws there in marvailous plenty; and in going to Plough, there hath been Time out of Mind, and now is, found more Antiquities of Romane Money, then in any place else of 
England.




Surely Reason speaks that this should be 
Rutupinum,
 for besides the Name some∣what toucheth, the very near passage from 
Calis
 Cliffs, or 
Calis,
 was to 
Ratesborough
 and now is to 
Sandwich,
 which is about a Mile off, though now 
Sandwich
 be not celebrated, because of 
Goodwin Sands,
 and the Decay of the Haven: There is a good Flight shot off from 
Ratesborough
 toward 
Sandwich,
 a great Dike cast in a round Compass, as if it had been for Defence of Men of War, the Compass of the Ground within is not much above an Acre, and it is very hollow by casting up the Earth; They call this place their Little 
Borough,
 within the Castle is a little Paroch Church of St. 
Augustine,
 and an Hermitage; I had Antiquities of the 
Hermit,
 who is an Industri∣ous Man; not far from the 
Hermitage
 is a Cave where Men have sought and digged for Treasure, I saw it by Candle within, wherein were Conies, it was so streight, that I had no mind to creep far in. In the 
North
-side of the Castle is an Head in the Wall, now sore defaced by the weather, they call it Q. 
Berthas
 Head; near to that place, hard by the Wall, was a Pot of Roman Money lately found. Thus far He. The Ancient Lords of the Castle were the Earls of 
Oxford,
 and 
Edward
 Earl of 
Ox∣ford
 in the Beginning of Q. 
Elizabeth
 alienated it to 
Gant.


Ash juxta Faukham,
 lies in the Hundred of 
Acstane,
 anciently written 
Clacstane,
 and was in elder Times the Inheritance of the 
Latimers, William de Latimer
 held it in the thirtieth year of 
Edward
 the first, and by the Royal Indulgence of that Prince obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Mannor of 
Ash
 which he held of 
Roger de Mowbray.
 After the 
Latimers
 were worn out, the noble Family of 
Grandison
 succeeded in the possession, and 
Otho de Grandison
 held it, as appears by the Book of 
Aid,
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at making the Black Prince Knight, by the fourth part of a Knights Fee: But after this, there is little Evidence that it was long constant to the Interest of this Family, for in the Reign of 
Richard
 the second, it was wrapped up in the Demeasn of 
Cressel,
 a Family that were entituled to a large Revenue, both at 
Chiselhurst, Hartley,
 and elsewhere in this Track, but it seems took no deep root at this place, for in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, the Knights Hospitalers held it at the Marriage of 
Blanch,
 that Princes Daughter, but whether they had it by Purchase or Exchange from 
Cressell,
 the Record in the Exche∣quer does not specifie; and here it became fixed and was esteemed as one of the principal Mannors relating to their Order in this County, untill the Reign of 
Hen.
 the eighth, and then in the thirty seventh year of that Prince, not without much contest and strugling, this was with the rest of their Revenue surrendred, and being made parcel of the Income of the Crown, K. 
Edw.
 the sixth about the second year of his Reign granted it to Sir 
Martin Bowes,
 and he had Issue 
Will. Bowes,
 who determined in two Daughters and Coheirs; 
Eliz.
 matched to 
Will. Buggin,
 and 
Ann
 married to Sir 
Edmund Fowler,
 who divided his Patrimony; and this upon the partition, was united to the Revenue of 
Fowler,
 and continues still to acknowledge his descendants for Proprietaries.


South-Ash
 is another Mannor in this Parish, which had Owners in elder Times of that Name, for in the Book of 
Aid,
 I find that 
John
 at 
South-Ash
 paid an auxiliary supply for his Mannor of 
South-Ash
 at making the Black Prince Knight; but it is possible this Mans original Name was 
Hodsoll,
 and borrowed this Name from the Situation and Position of his Habitation, which was 
Southerly;
 and that which induces me to this Conjecture is, that upon a perusall of the original Evidences, I find that the Family of 
Hodsoll,
 was long before possessors of this Mannor, a particular Se∣ries of whom I could discover to the Reader, but that I will not clog this Treatise with superfluities, nor is this Mannor departed from the Signorie of this Name, but is at this instant involved in the patrimony of Mr. 
William Hodsoll.


Hodsoll
 and 
Halywell
 are two other little Mannors in 
Ash,
 whereof the last hath been the Seat of 
Hodsoll,
 who borrowed their Sirname from the first many hundred years; and in Relation to this assumed the bearing of three Stone Fountains, two and one, such as used to be dedicated to some Saint, and were frequented an∣ciently by such who reposed any Confidence in his vertue and miraculous efficacie, whose Name they bore; and of this Figure was 
hat Stone Well at 
Brackley
 com∣monly called St. 
Rumbals Well,
 much frequented in the misty Times of Popery, for the Cure of sore Eyes, and other Maladies, and that this was the ancient Coat of

this Family is most certain, for 
William Hodsoll,
 who in severall Deeds writ himself Esquire, both in the Reign of 
Henry
 the fifth, and 
Henry
 the sixth, sealed with the 
three stone Fountains
 only; but now I know not upon what consideration the 
Fesse Wavee
 is added; so that that the Coat is now 
Azure a Fesse Wavee
 between 
three stone Fountains Argent:
 But to proceed, as 
Hodsoll
 and 
Halywell
 have for so many Gene∣rations owned the Title of that Name and Family, so hath no Vicissitude of Time so carryed off the Propriety of them, but that they are still the present Demeasne of Mr. 
William Hodsoll.


North-Ash
 is another Mannor in this Parish, which hath been accounted a Limb of the great Mannor of St. 
Johns
 at 
Sutton
 at 
Hone,
 and upon the Suppression of the Al∣berge of the Knights Hospitallers here in 
England,
 who for many hundreds of years had owed this Mannor, was by 
Henry
 the eighth granted to Sir 
Maurice Dennis,
 by whose Coheir it came to 
Wrote,
 and he passed it away to 
Thomas Smith
 Esquire, who upon his Decease gave it to his second Son Sir 
Tho. Smith,
 in whose Descendants the Interest of it is wrapped up at present.


Scotgrove
 is the last place of Account in 
Ash,
 it was in Ages of a very high Ascent, the Estate of a Family called 
Torpell. Mabilia Torpell,
 Widow of 
John de Torpell,
 who held it in the Reign of 
Henry
 the third, dyed in the enjoyment of it, in the Time of 
Edward
 the first, as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 27. In Times of a lower Gradation, I find this Family vanished, and then this Mannor came to be under the Signorie of 
Catwick,
 and 
John de Catwick
 held it, and paid respective Aid for it; (as appears by the Book of 
Aid
) at making the black Prince Knight. After this Family had de∣serted the possession of this place, I discover by some old Deeds that Commence from the Reign of 
Rich.
 the second, that the 
Frankenhams
 were Lords of the Fee, who before the latter end of 
Henry
 the fifth were gon out, and then it came to own the Propriety of 
Poynings,
 and went along with this Name untill it devolved to Sir 
Edward Poyning,
 who had it in possession at his Death, which was in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and after a solemne and signall Inquisition taken in the fourteenth year of that Monarch, to discover if there could be traced out any collaterall Alliance (for he dyed without any lawfull Issue) that could justifie a Claim to his Estate, and there none appearing who could do it, this Mannot with much other land escheated to the Crown, and then the abovesaid Prince granted this to 
William Lewknor
 Esquire; in which Family it had not rested many years when it was conveyed by Sale to 
Vane,
 from whom by the like Vicissitude in that Age we call our Fathers, it came to be the Possession of 
Walter
 of 
Faukham.


The Priorie of St. 
Helens
 in 
London,
 had some Interest at 
South-Ash,
 in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, as appears by the Rolls of 
Blanch Lands
 kept in the Exchequer, but whether upon the Suppression it were wrapped up in the Mannor of 
Ash,
 and so conveyed in the general Concession or Grant, as being a Perquisite, I am incertain.


Ashford
 in the Hundred of 
Chart
 and 
Longbridge,
 was one of those Mannors which was marshalled under the Jurisdiction and Propriety of the eminent Family of 
Crioll; Simon de Crioll,
 in the twenty seventh and twenty eighth year of 
Henry
 the third, ob∣tained a Charter of Free Warren to his Mannor of 
Ashford,
 and 
Mawde de Crioll
 his Widow dyed seised of it in the fifty second year of 
Henry
 the third, and left it to her Son 
Will. de Keriell,
 who, as 
Will. Glover Somerset Herald
 out of an old Court Roll does attest, confirmed that change his Mother had designed in her life time, and passed away this Mannor to 
Roger de Leybourne
 for 
Stocton
 in 
Huntington-shire,
 and 
Rumford
 in 
Essex,
 and from him did it come down to his great Grandchild 
Juliana de Leybourn,
 sole Heir of 
Roger de Leybourne,

 Earl of

Rot. Esc. Num.

Juliana
 his Countesse deceasing without Issue, and without Kindred, in the fourty third year of the abovesaid Prince, it escheated to the Crown, and this Monarch desiring to enhance the Revenue of the Church rather then his own, gave it to the Deans and Canons of St. 
Stephens
 in 
West∣minster,
 which Donation was confirmed by 
Richard
 the second, in the twelfth year of his Reign, and afterwards more amply ratified with all the Franchises it was anciently fortified with, in the twenty first year of his Rule, as appears 
Pat.

Ashford
 and elsewhere, which were formerly relating to the Family of 
Leybourne,
 but being granted to Sir 
Simon de Burleigh,
 returned back to the Crown upon his Attaint, which was in the tenth year of the abovesaid Prince, and here in the Revenue of this Cloister did it make a secure abode, untill the rough Hand of 
Henry
 the eighth, like that of 
Aeolus,
 scattered such a Tempest upon these and all other Cloisters, that they shrunk into a common dissolution, and then this Mannor, being in that whirlwind ravished from the Church, and transplanted into the Crown, was by that Monarch granted with 
Westure
 (which was purchased by Cardinal 
Kempe
 of 
Aldon,
 about the twenty eighth of 
Henry
 the Sixth, and setled on the Colledge of 
Wie,
 and came to the Crown upon its Supression,) to Sir 
Anthony Aucher
 and 
Jo. Polsted,
 and they not many years after conveyed them by Sale to Sir 
Andrew Judde,
 who expiring in a Female Heir called 
Alice,
 she by matching with Sir 
Thomas Smith.
 annexed them to his Revenue and from him is both 
Ashford
 and 
Westure
 come down by descendant Right, to his great Grandchild, 
Philip
 Viscount 
Strangford.


Repton
 in this Parish was the Seat of that ancient Family of 
Valoigns; Waretius de Valoigns
 in a Deed whereby on Ash-Wednesday in the the fourty fifth year of 
Henry
 the third, releases some Services due to his Mannor of 
Swerdlin,
 to 
Cecilia
 Widow of 
Richard Greenbold,
 writes himself of 
Repton. Rualonus de Valoigns
 was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the first year of 
Henry
 the second, and dwelt sometimes at 
Repton,
 and sometimes at 
Tremworth.
 The last of this Family at this Place was 
Waretius de Valoigns,
 who concluding in two Daughters and Coheirs, one of them by matching with Sir 
Tho. Fogge,
 brought this and much other Land to own the Title of that Family, and they afterwards made this their Seat, which was productive of Persons as eminent for Piety, Prudence and Valour as any that this County, either in Times which have been tempestuous, or else in those which have been calm and serene, hath been fertile, in one of which was Sir 
Io. Fogge
 Comptroller of the House, and Privie Counsellor to 
Edward
 the fourth, who founded a Colledge here at 
Ashford,
 consisting of a Pre∣bendarie as the Head, and of certain Priests and Choristers as Members. But to pro∣ce
d, after this Seat had so many Generations acknowledged the Interest of this Family, it was in the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 alienated by 
George Fogge
 to Sir 
Michael Sonds,
 and he conveyed it to 
Iohn Tufton
 Esquire, whose great Grand∣child the right Honorable 
Iohn Tufton
 Earl of 
Thanet
 is the instant Lord of the Fee.


There was a perpetuall Chauntry here at 
Ashford,
 in a certain Chappell dedicated to the Virgin 
Mary,
 which was founded by 
Will. de Sodington,
 for which he had a Concession from royall Authoritie, as appears 
Pat.

Ashford, Willesborough, Charing,
 and 
Kennington,
 which upon the Suppression being dispersed into many Hands, I shall decline any farther labour to trace out.


Ashford
 had a Market upon the Saturday, which was allowed by the Judges 
Itinerant
 to 
William de Leybourn,
 in the seventh year of 
Edw.
 the first, which being thus ratified and confirmed, continueth in force upon that Day, even at this instant.


I had almost forgot 
Merdall,
 which is the last Mannor in this Parish; It was in∣cluded in the Patrimony of 
Corbie,
 untill 
Robert Corbie
 of 
Boughton, Malherbe
 concluded in a Daughter and Heir called 
Joan Corbie,
 matched to Sir 
Nicholas Wotton
 twice Lord Maior of 
London;
 by which Marriage all that vast Demeasne which acknowledged the Interest of that Family, came to be united to this, and continued many years couched in their Inheritance, untill at length, that is almost in our Grandfathers Remembrance, by Sale it devolved to 
Sprot,
 who not many years since conveyed his Right in it to Sir 
Thomas Finch
 Earl of 
Winchelsey,
 Father to the right honorable 
Heneage
 Earl of 
Winchelsey
 now Lord of the Fee.


Ashurst
 or 
Ashenhurst
 in the Hundred of 
Watchlingstone,
 with the Mannor of 
Buckland,
 as an Appendage annexed to it, was anciently the Demeasne, as the 
Dooms-day.
 Text informs us, of 
Philip de Gerund,
 and 
Hugh de Gerund
 this mans Successor, was seised both of 
Ashurst
 and 
Buckland;
 likewise in the twenty sixth year

of 
Edward
 the first, as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 71. But after this Family determined in a Daughter and Heir, who matching with 
Chalfhunt
 made that Family possessors of the Fee, and 
Henry Chalfhunt,
 as we trace by Record, held it in the forty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 14. And after they went out, it came about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, by the Heir General of this Family to be possest by 
Hadde,
 whose Successor about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, con∣veyed it to 
Waller
 of 
Grome-bridge;
 and from this Family, after some Interval of Time, it was carried off by Sale to 
Thomas
 Earl of 
Dorset,
 Lord Treasurer of 
England;
 and from his Descendant the Title went away not many years since, by the same Fatality, into 
Rivers
 of 
Chafford,
 in which Family the Title both of 
Ashurst
 and 
Buckland
 are at this instant placed.


Chafford
 next invites our Survey, it was for some Descents the Possession of the 
Roes
 or 
Rows
 streamed out from that original Fountain, which was of this Name and Family at 
Roes Place
 in 
Alresford;
 and from these two those numerous Branches have issued out, which like so many divided Rivulets have dispersed themselves into so many parts of this Nation; but though this Family be here (like a River licked up by a Summer Sun,) shrunk into Oblivion, and the Name wholly dryed, yet hath the Title of this Seat found out another Chanel, for by Sale it now flows in the Name of 
Rivers,
 and Sir 
John Rivers
 Baronet, Crandchild to Sir 
John Rivers
 Knight and Baronet; descended from the ancient Family of 
Rivers
 of 
River Hill
 in 
Hantshire,
 upon the late Decease or his Brother Sir 
Thomas,
 is now Proprietary of it.


Aythorne
 in the Hundred of 
Eastry
 was given to the 
Monks
 of 
Christ Church
 by 
Ulfred
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 in the year 824, in exchange for the Mannor of 
Berham,
 but the principal Honour which did accrue to it, was, that it was parcel of that Estate which claimed the Family of 
Badelesmer
 for Inheritors, and lay involved in their Demeasn until the infortunate Attainder of 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer
 in the Reign of 
Edward
 the second, when being by this Tempest rent off from his Name and Patrimony, it made its abode in the Revenue of the Crown, untill K. 
Edw.
 the third granted it to Sir 
John de Bondon,
 who in the eighteenth year of that Prince, conveyed it to 
John de Gildesburgh.
 After whose 
Exit
 it came by the same Devolu∣tion to be possest by 
Thomas Holben,
 who in the twelfth year of 
Richard
 the second, passed it away to 
Robert Dane;
 And now there being an Interval or Gap in the private Evidences, which have an Aspect on this place, I must next represent 
Robert Webbe
 possessor of it, who in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, transplanted his Interest in it by Sale into 
John St. Clere,
 and he not long after by the same Fatalitie transmitted it to Sir 
Walter Hungerford,
 who about the latter End of 
Henry
 the sixth setled the Right and Title by Sale on Sir 
Thomas Brown
 of 
Bechworth
 Castle in 
Surrey,
 Comptro∣ler of the House to the abovesaid Prince, who in the twenty seventh of his Reign, as appears, 
Pat.
 27. 
Hen.
 6. 
Num.
 37. obtained the Grant of a Fair to be held yearly on St. 
Peters
 Day, and in this Family the Propriety and Title was fixed until the sixteenth of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was conveyed by 
Thomas Brown
 Esq; to 
Francis Santon,
 and his Son by the same Vicissitude in the twenty eighth of the abovesaid Princesse alienated it to Sir 
William Rither
 of 
London;
 who dying without Issue Male, setled this Mannor on 
Susan
 one of his Coheirs, first matched to Sir 
Thomas Caesar,
 and after to Mr. 
Thomas Philipott,
 second Son to Sir 
John Philipott
 of 
Compton Wascelin
 in 
Hantshire,
 and She upon her Decease gave it to her onely Son by her second Husband Mr. 
Villiers Philipott,
 who hath lately conveyed it by Sale to Mr. 
John Brett
 of 
London.

BAbchild,
 but in all ancient Records, Escripts, and all other Monuments of An∣tiquity, written 
Becanceald
 lies in the Hundred of 
Milton,
 and did, as old Deeds

testifie relate to the 
Savages,
 a Family whom elder Times represented under a Cha∣racter of much eminence in this Tract. 
Arnold de Savage
 held this Mannor in the forty ninth of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 39. 
Parte secunda,
 and in this Name the Title stood some years, untill it sunk into a Daughter and Heir, who being wedded to 
William Clifford,
 branched out from the 
Cliffords
 of 
Cliffords
 Castle in 
Here∣fordshire;
 the Title of this Mannor with the Name, was folded up in this Family, and here for some interval of Time it continued, untill that common Fate which shifts and changes the Scene of Majesty it self, as well as the Face of more subordi∣nate Interests, transferred this Mannor by Purchase to 
William Coting
 about the Be∣ginning of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 from whom not long after, it passed away by the same fatality to 
William Biggs,
 Ancestor to that Gentleman his Descendant both of the Name and Family, who is now in the enjoyment of it.


There was at 
Radfield
 in this Parish anciently a 
Free Chappel,
 which is now onely obvious to the Eye, by that Mass of Ruines in which at this present, it seems to lye gasping, the Founder and Uses are both unknown; upon the suppression, the De∣meansn which was annexed to it, was by the Concession of 
Edward
 the sixth, enstated on 
John Bateman,
 and his Successor 
John Bateman
 hath by Testamentary Donation, not long since conferred it on 
John Bateman
 of 
Wormesell.


There was another 
Oratory
 or 
Chappel,
 whose Ruines are yet visible, near the Verge or Margin of the Road, and here 
Pilgrims
 which did usually visit the shrine of 
Thomas Becket,
 at 
Canterbury,
 frequently enter'd to offer up their Orizons, before they advanced any farther in their Pilgrimage; the 
Oratory
 as far as possible Con∣jectures guide us to assert, was erected in Memory, and Celebration of that Counsel, held here by Arch-Bishop 
Brigthwald
 under 
Withredus,
 or as some Copies have it 
Muthredus
 K. of 
Kent,
 in the year 692. He that will read the Results and Decrees of this Councel, may have Recourse to Sir 
Henry Spelman
's 
Concilia Anglicana,
 or his Collections of the English Councels, where he shall find the Constitutions and Ca∣nons of this Synod represented in an exact Register to posterity.


Potts Court
 in 
Babchild
 vulgarly called 
Petts Court,
 was parcel of the Demeasn of the Priory of 
Dertford,
 as appears by an Inquisition taken in the eleventh year of 
Edw.
 the fourth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 69. and continued united to it untill the suppression in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was cast into the Revenue of the Crown where it lay, untill 
Edward
 the sixth in the last year of his Reign granted it to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney,
 whose Son 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney
 about the thirteenth year of Q. 
Eliz.
 passed it away to 
Samuel Thornhil
 Esquire, in whose Descendant Line the Propriety of it is yet continuing.


Morris Court
 is a third place of Note in 
Babchild,
 in elder Times it gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of that Denomination, as appears by the ancient Muniments of this Seat, but before the latter End of 
Henry
 the fourth this Family was vanished, and then I find the 
Enghams
 setled by Purchase in the Inheritance, and 
John Engham
 as appears by ancient Court Rolls, held it in the Reign of 
Henry
 the fifth and 
Henry
 the sixth, and after him did the Title by successive Inheritance transmit it self to his Posterity, even untill those Times which grew near our Grand Fathers remembrance, and then it was by Sale translated into 
Wolgate,
 whose Ancestors had their Habitation at 
Wolgate Green
 in 
Throuley;
 and after it had for some years acknowledged this Fa∣mily for Proprietaries, it was conveyed to 
Tilghman
 descended from the 
Tilghmans
 of 
Snodland,
 from which Name it was again by as sudden a transmission alienated to 
Carselock
 of 
Feversham
 allied to 
John Carselock
 the last Abbot of the Priory there, at the suppression of it; and this Name being lately here by Defailance of Issue to∣tally extinguished, the Heirs of this Family as 
Knowler
 and others, so designed by Testament, do now possess it.


Badelesmer
 in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 was the Seat of that Family, which for the great sway and influence they had once in this County, although they have their Existence now only in Annals and History, deserve a serious Remembrance; 
Giles
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 as the Annals of St. 
Augustins
 instruct me, was slain in the year 1258. in a Battell against the 
Welsh,
 whilst he by endevouring to unite them to the English Scepter, attempted to assault their Liberty, and they as vigorously asserted it;

Guncelin de Badelesmer
 dyed possest of this Mannor in the twenty ninth year of 
Edward
 the first, as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 50. and lies buryed in 
Badelesmer
 Church, with his Portraiture crosseleg'd cut in Wood, and so much left of his Name, as discovers to us that it is He who lyes there enterred; and although there hath such a vast In∣terval or Decursion of Time intervened since his Sepulture, yet neither hath Time, nor our modern Zeal, more fierce and ravenous then that, so defaced it but that the Effigies insculped crosseleg'd is yet obvious & visible; and this I believe wil sufficiently refute the opinion of the vulgar, who believe this Figure on the Tomb-stone to be the representa∣tion of some Giant; and this 
Guncelin
 had Issue, 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 that opulent and powerfull Baron of 
Kent,
 who was witnesse to the Charter of 
Edward
 the second, by which he confirms the Franchises and Priviledges of the City of 
London,
 in the twelfth year of his Reign, and there subscribes himself Steward of the Kings Hostell, and was certainly a very eminent Person, for in the year 1316, when Sir 
Richard de Rodney
 was invested with Knighthood by the abovesaid Prince, the Ceremony of putting on his Spurs was performed by 
Maurice de Berkley,
 and 
Bartholomew de Bade∣lesmer;
 but he had not been long swoln to this vast Dimension of power, but their arose a Tempest which blasted all his blooming Glories, for 
Isabel
 Wife and Queen to 
Edward
 the second, having by severall good Offices performed between her Husband, and his disobliged Barons, so becalmed and softned all their Animo∣sities, that they became intombed in a mutuall Pacification, was so inflamed at her denyall of Lodging, and Accomodation in 
Leeds
 Castle by 
Thomas Colepeper
 the Castellan under 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 that she egged and pushed on the King to a Revenge, which was done so effectually, that the Death of the Castellan was the Expiation of so infortunate an Insolence, and the Losse of the Head of the Lord 
Badelesmer,
 taken Prisoner not long after neer 
Pontfrait,
 and the forfeiture of his Estate paid the price of his Ambition; and thus this magnificent Baron, who like a streight and procere Elme grew tall in Title, and like its luxuriant Branches, did spread wide in the extent of his Power and Revenue, was by this Storm supplanted, and his Patrimony broken to peices, being gathered up by escheat into the Royall Demeasne; and in this Shipwrack did this Family lye involved, untill the second year of 
Edward
 the third, and then the indulgent Munificence of that Prince, boy'd it up out of those Ruines wherein it appeared almost to have been sunk, and by Patent restored him to his Estate here and elsewhere; and he in a thankfull acknowledge to Heaven for this Restitution, according to the Piety of those Times, erected here a House for Black Canons, or Canons of St. 
Augustins,
 as the Record, 
pat.
 13. 
Edw.
 3. 
Memb.
 6. doth amply testifie, and dyed in the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the third, and left his Estate to his only Son 
Giles
 Lord 
Badelesmere,
 who dying without Issue; his four Sisters, 
Mar∣gery
 first marryed to 
William Rosse
 Lord 
Hamlake,
 and then remarryed to 
Tho. Arundell; Margaret
 matched to Sir 
John Tiptoft, Elizabeth
 first wedded to 
William Bohun
 Earl of 
Northampton,
 and afterwards to 
Edmund Mortimer
 Earl of 
March,
 and 
Mawde
 espoused to 
John Vere
 Earl of 
Oxford,
 became his Coheirs, and that Land here at 
Badelesmer,
 which was not before setled on the Monastery, upon the partition was knit to the Patri∣mony of 
Vere,
 and he dyed possest of it in the thirty fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, and left it with the Title of Baron 
Badelesmer,
 to his Successors, one of which was 
Jo.
 Earl of 
Oxford,
 who was attainted in the twelfth year of 
Edw.
 the fourth, for supporting the House of 
Lancaster
 at the Battle of 
Barnet,
 but was restored both in Blood and Estate, but he never was possest of this Mannor, for I find that upon the Suppression of this Cloister at 
Badelesmer,
 it escheated to the Crown, and then 
Henry
 the eighth granted it to Sir 
Robert Southwell,
 and he in the second year of 
Edward
 the sixth, alienated it to Sir 
Anth. Aucher,
 and he upon his decease gave it to his Son 
Jo. Aucher,
 who dying without Issue male, 
Ann
 his sole Inheritrix, brought it with her to her Husband Sir 
Humphrey Gilbert,
 who about the middle of Queen 
Elizabeth
 alienated it to Sir 
Michael Sonds,
 and from him is the instant Signorie devolved to Sir 
George Sonds
 Knight of the 
Bath.


There is another Mannor in this Parish of 
Badelesmer,
 called 
Goddisland,
 and gave Seat and Sirname to a Family which formerly had their Mansion at this Place, and 
John de Goddisland
 is mentioned in the Book of 
Aid
 to have held it in twentieth of 
Edward
 the third, and when after some Flux of Time, this Name was ebbed away from this place, the 
Atwoods
 succeeded, so stiled from their Habitation, nere the

Wood, and 
Robert Atwood
 died seised of it in the sixth year of 
Richard
 the second, and when this Family began to Decay, the 
Sawyers
 came in and were Possessors of the place; but long the Fee was not setled in this Name, for the Title about the Be∣ginning of 
Henry
 the seventh was engraffed by Purchase on 
Cheyney,
 from which Family by the like Current, it flowed about the Begining of Q. 
Elizabeth
 into 
Snode,
 and from them not many years since it was by Sale wafted over to 
Franklin.


Barham
 in the Hundred of 
Kinghamford
 gives Name to that spacious Plain, where the 
Britons
 encountred 
Caesar
 and his Army at his first Landing at 
Deale,
 and after a signal Conflict, repelled them back to their Ships. The old Family of 
Fitz-Urse,
 were formerly Lords of this Mannor, and resolved into the Name of 
Berham,
 after such Time as one of them called 
Randolph Fitz-Urse,
 being Ring-leader of three other Cavaliers of the Kings Court, had impiously assassinated Arch-Bishop 
Becket.
 The Fact being so barbarous in the Estimate of those Times, that flying into 
Ire∣land
 he abandoned the Name of 
Fitz-Urse,
 and took that of 
Mac-Mahon,
 as Mr. 
Cam∣den
 Notes. Certainly as he was the Actor, and thereby more stained then the rest, so was he much more culpable, beause he held this Mannor of 
Berham
 of the See of 
Canterbury,
 by the Service of halfe a Knights Fee, so it appears by the Record of the 
Aid
 kept in the Exchequer, and paid in the twentieth of 
Edw.
 the third; yet did not this Name vanish at this place, but still was inforced, and multiplied into many De∣scents from whence issued Gentlemen of a prime and eminent Note in this Track, un∣till lately that Fate which Shuffles both Families and Kingdomes into Disorder and Oblivion, hath torn this Mannor now from this Name, and by purchase brought over the Propriety of it to 
Fotherby.


Shelvingborough
 is a second Mannor in this Parish, not to be waved in this Survey, because it was sometimes one of the Seats of 
John de Shelving,
 who held it in the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the second; But this Family determining not long after in a Daughter and Heir, She by matching with 
Haut,
 annexed this Mannor to the Patrimony of this Family; and in this Name the Title was carried along by the Clew of many Descents, untill it devolved to Sir 
William Haut;
 who about the latter End of 
Henry
 the eighth, concluded in two Female Coheirs, whereof 
Elizabeth
 was matched to Sir 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bedgebury,
 who brought this along with her to that Family, and he about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the sixth, devested himself of the possession, and by Sale transmitted his Right in it to 
Mantle,
 where after the Title had by some small continuance made some little respite, it was conveyed by Sale to 
Carlisle;
 and here the Propriety, was as transient, for an Alteration of the same resemblance, not many years since, made it the possession of 
Hopday.


Diggs Court
 in 
Barham
 was the Mansion of the ancient Family of 
Digge
 or 
Diggs,
 which Family about four Hundred years since, that is about the Reign of 
Richard
 the first, had the Aldermanry of 
Newingate
 in 
Canterbury,
 as part of their Inheritance, which it seems was not (as now) elective, but as Freehold, either demisable or devisable 
ad Libitum
 of him or her that held the same: or if neither demised nor devised of him nor her in Life Time, but indisposed of at Death, then as Inheritance or Fee, it descended to the next Heir at Law; These Aldermen every one of them, kept within their own Wards, and happily (as the Jews held theirs) had at their several Gates a Court assembled every three weeks, which was called of our An∣cestors, sometimes the 
Hundred Court,
 sometimes the 
Wardmote,
 that is the assembly or the meeting of the Hundred or Ward, or the 
Portmote,
 as the Jurisdiction was called 
Portsoka. John
 or 
Diggs
 was in the year 1258, a great Benefactor to the Fran∣ciscans, who had then newly planted themselves at 
Canterbury,
 and purchased for them an Island in that City called 
Binnewight. Emit Insulam vocatam Binnewight in Cantuar. & locum Portae super Stourstreet, ad opus Fratrum Minorum, & tempore opportuno transtulit Fratres ad illam.
 As 
Leland
 records of him: 
Adomarus de Digge
 one of this House, was a Judge in the Reign of 
Edward
 the second, and possest much Land about 
Reynham
 and 
Newington,
 which still represents his Name to Posterity, and is called 
Diggs Mersh; John Diggs
 of 
Diggs Court,
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 part of the se∣cond year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and 
John Diggs
 his Grand child was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, his Son and Heir was 
John Diggs
 Esquire,

who likewise held that Office in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the seventh, this our Sheriff had Issue 
James Diggs
 of 
Diggs Court
 Esquire, who was likewise Sheriff of 
Kent
 the second year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and Justice of the Peace for this County almost all the Government of that Prince; he was Father of 
Leonard Diggs
 Esquire, who was Grand Father to Sir 
Dudley Diggs
 of 
Chilham
 Castle, Master of the Rolls 1637, who almost in our Memory passed away this Seat which had been for many years an Appendage to it, to Captain 
Halsey
 of 
London;
 who not long after alie∣nated it to Alderman 
Soame
 of the same place, who not long since conveyed it to Sir 
Basil Dixwell
 of 
Terlingham
 in 
Folkstone
 Knight and Baronet, whose collateral De∣scendant, that is, his Nephews Son and Heir, Mr. 
Basil Dixwell
 is Proprietary appa∣rent of it.


Barfreyston
 in the Hundred of 
Eastry,
 was anciently held by 
Castle-Guard
 of 
Dover
 Castle by 
John de Wybarne,
 and when this Family had abandoned the possession, which was about the latter End of 
Henry
 the fourth, it came to be held by 
Harward,
 and when some years it had been wrapped up in the Interest of this Family, it was transmitted by Sale about the latter End of 
Henry
 the sixth, to Sir 
Thomas Brown
 of 
Bechworth
 Castle; and here the Title lodged, untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then part of it was passed away to 
Wood,
 but the Mannor it self rested in 
Brown,
 untill the Beginning of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was conveyed to Mr. 
Thomas Bois
 whose successor Mr. 
John Bois
 not many years since alienated it to Sir 
An∣thony Percival
 of 
Dover.


Hartanger
 and 
Soles
 are two Mannors situated within the Precincts of this little Parish, who both had owners so Sirnamed. The first after it had been folded up in the Demeasn of 
Hartanger
 untill the Reign of 
Edward
 the second, was by Purchase made the Inheritance of 
Perot
 of 
Knowlton,
 and 
Thomas Perot
 died seised of it in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 31. but this Name determining not long after in a Female Heir, She by matching with 
Langley
 of 
Warwick-shire,
 linked it to his Patrimony; and 
William Langley
 in Right of this Alliance, was possest of 
Hartanger
 in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and here it made its abode untill the latter End of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was conveyed by Sale to Sir 
Thomas Brown
 aboved mentioned, and his successor about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh. But the Mannor of 
Soles
 remained longer in the Name and possession of that Family, 
John Soles
 held it at his Decease, which was in the forty ninth year of 
Edw.
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 40. 
Parte secunda,
 whilst this Family flourished under the Notion of one of the most ancient of 
East-Kent,
 but continued here but untill the fourth year of 
Henry
 the fourth; and then I find it linked to the Inheritance of 
Thomas Newbregge
 of 
Fordwich,
 and in his Posterity did the propriety fix, untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then the Name expired, having tranferred the Interest they had in this place to Mr. 
William Bois
 Ancestor to Mr. 
John Bois
 of 
Hode,
 who passed away some part of it not many years since to Sir 
Anthony Percival,
 but transmitted the Remainder to his Son and Heir Mr. 
John Bois
 of 
Hode
 Esquire.


Bradherst
 with its two small appendant Mannors 
Petesworth
 and 
Meresworth,
 vulgar∣ly called 
Meresborough,
 is situated in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne,
 and was formerly folded up in that wide and spacious Revenue, which was the paternal Inheritance of the Lords 
Leybourne
 of 
Leybourne
 Castle, the last of which was 
Roger
 Lord 
Leybourne;
 in whom the Name determined, as the Estate did afterwards in his sole Daughter and Heir 
Juliana de Leybourne,
 who having no Issue surviving, neither by her first Hus∣band 
John de Hastings,
 nor her second, 
William de Clinton
 Earl of 
Huntington,
 nor any who by a collateral Relation could fortifie or furnish out a claim to her inheritance, these Mannors which were a Limbe of it, were invested by Escheat in the Crown, and by 
Edward
 the third were not long after setled on his newly erected Abby of St. 
Mary Grace,
 on 
Tower-Hill;
 and remained wound up in the Revenue of that Cloister, untill the Common dissolution did unravel it, and resigned these respective Mannors, with the Remainder of their Demeasn up to the Crown; and here the Propriety of them made its abode, untill the third year of 
Edward
 the sixth, and then they were by the Royal Concession of that Prince, passed away to Sir 
Thomas

Cheyney,
 whose Son and Heir Sir 
Henry Cheyney
 Lord 
Cheyney
 of 
Tuddington,
 alienated all his Interest here, in the thirteenth year of Q. 
Elizabeth
 to 
Samuel Thornhill
 Esquire who upon his Decease gave his Estate here to his second Son Sir 
John Thornhill
 of 
Bromley
 Knight, whose Son and Heir 
Charles Thornhill
 Esquire, hath now the Signorie of it.


The Church of 
Bradherst
 though thrust into an obscure and silent Corner, amongst Woods and other dark Recesses, yet is enobled with a Monument of one of the Knightly Family of 
Northwood,
 which hath this Epitaph endorsed; 
Hic jacet Wil∣lielmus Northwood, cum quatuor suis Filiis, verus Haeres Domini de Northwood;
 It is pro∣bable this Family had some Retreat or Mansion here at this Parish, which upon their abandoning of 
Bradherst,
 languished away insenbly into Ruine, so that the Memory of it now is altogether neglected and forgotten.


Blackmanston
 in the Hundred of 
Worth,
 had a Family of good Account in this Tract, named 
Marings
 or 
Marins,
 which it called Proprietaries, 
Thomas de Marings
 held it at his Decease, which was in the twenty sixth year of 
Edward
 the first, and so did 
Joan
 Widow of 
Roger Marins
 his Son, as appears by two Inquisitions taken af∣ter her Decease, one in the sixteenth year of 
Edward
 the third, and the other in the twenty third year of that Princes Reign; but after this I do not find this place long permanent in this Family, for in the forty fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 10. 
Henry de Hauts
 of 
Haut bourne
 died possest of it, and from him did the Title by an even Clew of succession come down to Sir 
William Haut,
 Son and Heir of Sir 
Thomas Haut
 of 
Hautsbourne,
 who deceased without Issue Male, so that this Man∣nor of 
Blackmanston,
 upon the Division of his Estate, came by 
Joan
 one of his two Daughters and Coheirs to fall under the Possession and Signory of Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 but continued not long tied up in his Demeasn, for this noble but unfortunate Person being engaged past all Retreat in a Disastrous Combination against Q. 
Mary,
 was attainted of High Treason and beheaded in the second year of that Princess; and so this place being rent off by Escheat from this Family, it lay couched in the Income of the Crown, untill the twenty ninth of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was granted by that Princess to 
Roger Parker
 Esquire, who was one of her Pages; and he not long after conveyed it by Sale to Sir 
William Hall
 of 
Bibrook
 in 
Kennington,
 and his Son 
Nevil Hall
 Esquire in the year 1630, alienated his Right in it to Sir 
Edward Hales
 Knight and Baronet, whose Grandchild Sir 
Edward Hales
 now of 
Tunstal
 Baronet, upon the late Decease of his Grand Father abovesaid, now succeeds in the Possession of it.


Bekesbourne
 in the Hundred of 
Downhamford,
 distinguished from the other 
Bournes
 which are linked to each other by the River of 
Leving,
 by the ancient Owners Name the 
Bekes.
 It hath long time been a Member to 
Hasting
 in 
Sussex,
 and enjoyeth like Liberty with the Cinque Ports, which K. 
Edward
 the third made Declaration of by a special Writ in the forty third year of his Reign. At which time, and long after there was a small Navigation out of the River of 
Stoure
 up to this place: 
Richard de Beke
 as we read in 
Testa de Nevil,
 a Book kept in the Exchequer, held some Lands here in grand Serjeantie to find one Ship each Time K. 
Henry
 the third should pass the Seas.


The Arch-Bishops of 
Canterbury
 had here a small but elegant House, very com∣modious for their Recesse or Retirement, the River brought so conveniently about it, that the Trouts the principal Fish there, are plentifully useful unto it.


Garwinton
 a Mannor and House most elegantly and commodiously situated in this Parish, was possest by certain Gentlemen that extracted their Denomination from this Seat, and held the same by Knights Service of the Abbot of St. 
Augustins
 neer 
Canterbury,
 and 
Thomas de Garwinton
 a Man of valuable Consideration on this side of the County, was eminent here in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and from him did it descend to his great Crandchild 
Thomas Garwinton,
 in whom the Male Line determined, for he dying without Issue in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the fourth, 
Joan
 his Neice matched to 
Richard Haut,
 a Cadet of the 
Hauts
 of 
Hauts-Bourne,
 was after a serious Inquisition found to be his Heir General, and She having entituled her Husband to this Mannor, his Son 
Richard Haut
 in Right of this Alliance was en∣stated in it, but he concluding likewise in a Female Inheritrix called 
Margery,
 She

She by espousing 
William Isaac
 of 
Hopland
 knit this and much other Land to his inheri∣tance, whose successor by the same Fatality expired in a Daughter and Heir, first matched to 
Sydley,
 and secondly to Sir 
Henry Palmer,
 on whom She setled this Man∣nor, and his Descendant Sir 
Henry Palmer
 passed it away to Lieutenant Colonel 
Prude
 slain at 
Maestricht
 Father to Mr. 
Searles Prude,
 whose two Daughters and Coheirs have lately conveyed it to Mr. 
George Curtis.


Bekenham
 near 
Bromley
 helps to give Name to the Hundred wherein it is placed, and of old time was held by Gentlemen, called in Latine Records 
de Rupella,
 in French 
de la Rochel,
 and in English 
Rokeley,
 and were in their original Etymologie extracted from 
Rochel
 in 
France, Richard de Rokeley
 died seised of this Mannor, in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 6. and was succeeded in the Possession by 
Philip de la Rokeley,
 and he held it likewise at his Death, which hapened in the 23 year of 
Edw.
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 39. and left it to his Sole Daughter and Heir 
Isolda de la Rokeley
 matched to 
William Bruin,
 by whom She had Issue Sir 
Maurice Bruin,
 Chamberlaine to K. 
Edw.
 the third, honoured with the Summons to Parliament as Baron amongst the Peers of this Realm, who by a Right derived to him from his Mother, was possest of this at his Death, in the twenty ninth of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 38. and transmitted a wide and spreading Revenue to his Posterity here, at 
Southokenden
 in 
Essex,
 and at 
Roumere
 in 
Hantshire,
 which last was given in Appendage to a younger Son, from whom the 
Bruins
 of 
Athelhampton
 in the County of 
Dorset,
 are lineally de∣scended. But when after a fair continuance this Family had flourished at this Place, the Distaffe prevailed against the Speare, and Sir 
Henry Bruins
 two Daughters and Coheirs about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the fourth, divided his Inheritance, each of them having a first and second Husband: 
Alice
 the eldest was first married to 
Robert Harleston
 of 
Essex
 Esquire, and after to Sir 
Thomas Heveningham;
 and 
Elizabeth
 second Daughter was wedded first to 
Thomas Tirrell
 of 
Heron
 in 
Essex
 Esquire, and after his Decease to Sir 
William Brandon
 Knight, who was Standard-bearer to 
Henry
 the seventh at 
Bosworth
 Field, where he was stain in asserting his Cause and Quarrel against 
Richard
 the third, and he had Issue by her Sir 
Charles Brandon
 Duke of 
Suffolk,
 the Flower and perfection of English Chivalrie in his Time, who sometimes kept his Residence at this place, (not as Proprietarie, but onely as Lessee, for the Sole In∣heritance upon the Division of 
Bruin
's Estate accrued to 
Tirrell;
) and here enter∣tained 
Henry
 the eighth, with all the Cunning Pompe of Magnificence, as he went to bestow a Visit at 
Hever,
 on his discarded, and repudiated wife 
Ann
 of 
Cleve.
 But to go on, this Mannor as I said before, being annexed to the patrimony of 
Thomas Tirrell, Humphrey Tirrell
 his Grandchild to whom it descended, passed away one Moie∣tie of it in the thirty fifth year of 
Henry
 the eighth to 
Ralph Warren,
 and the other to 
Henry Parke; Warren
 alienated his Proportion not long after to 
Bradbury,
 from which Family about the latter End of Q. 
Eliz.
 it came over by Sale to Serjeant 
Gent,
 who gave it in Dower with his Daughter to Sir 
George Dalston
 of 
Cumberland,
 who in our Memory conveyed it to Sir 
Patrick Curwin
 of the same County, and he some few years since sold his Interest in it to Sir 
Oliver St. John
 of 
Batricksey
 in 
Surrey,
 who upon his Decease gave it to his Son then Mr. 
Walter,
 but now upon the Death of his Nephew, Sir 
Walter St. John
 Baronet, the other Moitie by 
Joan
 sole Heir of the abovesaid 
Henry Parke,
 came to be the Inheritance of Mr. 
Robert Leigh
 descended out of 
Cheshire,
 whose Successor about the latter End of King 
James
 alienated it to Sir 
Henry Snelgrave,
 from whom it descended to his Grandchild Mr. 
Henry Snelgrave,
 who not long since passed it away to Mr. 
Walter,
 now Sir 
Walter St. John
 Baronet, who lately hath exchanged the whole Mannor, for other Land with his Brother Mr. 
Henry St. John.


Langley
 in this Parish is a second Seat of eminent Account, which was in elder Times the Possession of 
John de Malmains,
 who obtained a Charter of Free-War∣ren to his Lands in 
Bekenham,
 in the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the second, which was renewed to 
Henry de Cliffe,
 to whom they accrued by Purchase from 
Malmains,
 in the third year of 
Edward
 the third; but stayed not long in the Tenure of this Fa∣mily, for before the going out of 
Edward
 the third, I find the Propriety invested by Sale in 
Langley,
 to which Family the Foundation of that HOuse owes in part its

Original, on which they ingraffed their own Name, which hath flourished under that Title ever since, though the Family be withered away and gone, the last of which Name at this place was 
Ralph Langley,
 who with 
Roger Twisden, Stephen Monins, Edward Monins, John Edingham
 or 
Engham, Richard Edingham, John Berton
 of 
Cotman∣ton
 in 
Shouldon, John Berham, John Betenham
 of 
Shurland
 in 
Pluckley,
 and others, Gentlemen of prime Rank in this County, were summoned to appear before 
Robert Poynings
 and 
John Perry,
 in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, to disclaim the Title of the House of 
York,
 and this 
Ralph
 died in the year 1451, and ordered 
Langley
 and other demeasns at 
Bekenham
 to be sold for the discharging his Debts, the purport and Effects of which Will were accordingly performed, and his Estate at 
Bekenham
 and 
Langley,
 passed away by Sale to 
John Violett,
 whose Successors enjoyed it until the Be∣ginning of 
Hen.
 the eighth, and then it was conveyed to 
John Stiles
 Esq; who much inlarged the House with a supply of Buildings, and from him is it by Descent de∣volved to be the instant Possession of his Successor Sir 
Humphrey Stiles
 Knight and Baronet.


Kelseys
 lies likewise in this Parish, and may justly exact our Notice; by Deeds written in a Character that hath an Aspect upon the Reign of 
Henry
 the third, 
John de Kelsey, William de Kelsey,
 and others of that Sirname are represented to have an In∣terest in this Seat, and from hence it is probable the 
Kelseys
 of 
Surrey
 did derive their first Extraction, however by the Injuries of Time they have been in succeeding Generations cast under the umbrage of an obscurer Fortune: But I return, After this Family had deserted the Possession of this place, which was before the latter End of 
Richard
 the the second, I find the 
Brograves
 stepped in, and by purchase became Lords of the Fee, a Family which in very old Deeds writ themselves 
Burgrave,
 and sometimes 
Boroughgrave,
 though now a more easie Pronunciation hath melted it into 
Brograve,
 which represents the Etymologie of the Name, to have been in its Origi∣nal perfectly Saxon. In the year 1479, there was a License granted (as appears by the Records of 
Rochester
) to 
William Brograve
 by the then Bishop of that Diocess, to erect an Oratory or Chapple at his Mannor-house of 
Kelseys,
 the Vestigia or Reliques of which are yet obvious to an inquisitive Eye, and from this 
William
 did the Title and possession in an even Current come down to Mr. 
Thomas Brograve,
 who being not many years since deceased, his Widow Mrs. 
Martha Brograve
 now in respect of Join∣ture, enjoys the present Possession of it.


Foxgrove
 is the last place of Account in this Parish, it had in elder times Pro∣prietaries of this Sirname; for I find 
John de Foxgrove
 paid respective Aid for it in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at making the Black Prince Knight. After this Family succeeded 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Burwash,
 and he held it at his Decease, which was in the twenty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 44. and from him it descended to his Son 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Burwash,
 who in the forty third year of the abovesaid Prince, passed it away to Sir 
Walter de Paveley,
 and in his Family it remained untill the latter End of 
Richard
 the second, and then it was conveyed to 
Vaux
 of the County of 
North-Hampton,
 and there made its abode untill the latter End of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was alienated to 
John Grene
 Esquire, and he died possest of it in fourth year of 
Edward
 the fourth; and in this Family did the Title reside, untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was demised to 
Beversea,
 and 
Humphrey Beversea,
 I find held it in the eighteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and his Descendant passed it away to 
Luke Hollingworth,
 and he about the Beginning of K. 
Edward
 the sixth, sold his Interest in it to Alderman Sir 
Jo. Oliff
 of 
London,
 and he dying with∣out Issue Male, 
Joan
 matched to 
John Leigh
 of 
Addington
 Esquire, was his sole Heir, and in Right of this Alliance, did it come down to Sir 
Francis Leigh
 late of 
East-Wickham;
 whose Widow Dowager the Lady 
Christian Leigh,
 is now in Possession of it.


Bexley,
 and in ancient Deeds written 
Bekesley,
 lies in the Hundred of 
Rokesley;
 and did in Times of elder Inscription belong to the Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 for 
Anno
 805. K. 
Kenulfus
 gave 
Bexley
 to Arch-Bishop 
Vefred ad opus Ecclesiae Christi;
 and his Successor to improve his Interest in this Mannor, obtained a Market to be held weekly at this place upon the 
Tuesday,
 and a Fair upon 
Holy-Rood-Day
 yearly, in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the second, as appears, 
Pat.
 9. 
Edw.
 2. 
Num.
 49. and here the Title

it lodged untill it came to the Crown in the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, by Exchange with 
Tho. Cranmer
 then Arch-Bishop, as appears by the Records of 
Christ Church,
 and was passed away by King 
Iames
 to Sir 
Io. Spilman
 his Majesties Jeweller, originally extracted out of 
Germany,
 and he suddenly after conveyed it to that resplendent Luminary of 
Englands
 Antiquities, Mr. 
William Camden Clarenceux
 King of Arms, and he upon his Decease gave it to 
Brasennose
 Colledge in 
Oxford,
 from whom the Lady 
Christian Leigh
 of 
East-Wickham
 holds it now as Lessee.


Blinden Court
 in old Deeds written 
Bladindon,
 is the next object of our obser∣vation; It was in elder Times the Possession of 
Jordanus de Bladindon
 or 
Blindon,
 who about the first year of 
Richard
 the first passed it away to 
Walsingham,
 in which Family it was resident untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then it was carryed over by Sale to 
Ferbie
 of 
Pauls Crey,
 and one of this Family about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth transported it by the same Alteration to 
William Marshall,
 and he not long after conveyed it to 
Rawlins;
 but it setled longer here, for it remained linked to the Demeasne of this Name almost untill our Grandfathers Remembrance and then it was by Purchase made the Inheritance of 
May,
 who not many yeers since alienated his Concernment in it to 
Wroth,
 and is at present, part of the Demeasne of 
John Wroth
 Esquire, descended from the ancient Family of the 
Wroths,
 of 
Durants
 in 
Essex.


Hall Place
 in this Parish is the last place which summons our Remembrance; It was in times of a more ancient Character, the Inheritance of a Family called 
Athall,
 the last of which was 
Thomas Athall,
 who in the fourty first year of 
Edward
 the third, conveyed it to 
Thomas Shelley
 of 
Gaysam
 in 
Westerham;
 and in this Name, after the Title like a fixed Inmate had for many Generations dwelt, it came down to 
William Shelley
 Son of 
John Shelley
 Esquire, who in the tweny ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth passed it away to Sir 
John Champneys
 of 
London,
 from whom it descended to his Grandchild Mr. 
Richard Champneys
 Esquire, who some few yeers since alienated his Interest here to Mr. 
Robert Austin
 of 
London.


Brasted
 in the Hundred of 
Codsheath
 was a Mannor which anciently related to the Family of 
Clare,
 who were Earls of 
Glocester
 and 
Hertford,
 and held is in grand Serjeanty of the Arch-Bishops of 
Canterbury,
 as they were originally, and 
de Jure,
 Stewards to the Lord Arch-Bishop at the Time of his Installment and Inthronization. 
Ric. de Clare
 dyed possest of it in the forty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third, and so did 
Gilbert de Clare
 in the twenty fourth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 107. From whom it came down to 
Richard de Clare,
 who in the nineteenth year of 
Edward
 the second, ended in 
Margaret
 his sole Heir, matched to 
Hugh de Audley,
 who in her Right was not only Earl of 
Glocester,
 but likewise Lord of this Mannor, and enjoyed it in the twenty first year of 
Edward
 the third; but he likewise going out in a Female Heir stiled 
Margaret,
 She by matching with 
Ralph Stafford
 Earl of 
Stafford,
 wedded the Title to his Inheritance, nor did it dislodge or depart from it until it escheated to the Crown upon the Attainder of 
Edward Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 who was convicted of high Treason in the thirteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, where it had not long rested, but the abovesaid Prince by Patent setled the Right of it on Sir 
Henry Isley,
 who being interessed past recovery, in the Design of Sir 
Tho. Wiat,
 for∣feited both Life and Estate to the Crown, and then Queen 
Mary
 upon his Conviction, granted it to 
John Lennard
 Esquire, from whom it is now transported by Descent to his Successor 
Francis Lennard
 Lord 
Dacres,
 who is the instant Lord of the Fee.


There is another Mannor and Seat in 
Brasted,
 venerable enough for its Antiquity, anciently called 
Stockets,
 but now 
Crow-place,
 it was so denominated from the 
Stockets
 which first held it, 
Walter de Stocket,
 and sometimes in old Deeds written 
Stock
 and 
Stoke,
 possest it by the fourth part of a Knights Fee, in the Time of 
Edward
 the first, and after this Name began to languish into Decay, it was by a Daughter and Heir brought over to 
Crow,
 extracted from the 
Crows
 of 
Norfolk,
 who from the Reign of 
Richard
 the second, held it in a continued Track of Succession, even untill our Time and then it was passed away from Sir 
Sackville Crow,
 by Sale to Sir 
Robert Heath,
 who dyed Lord Chief Justice of the 
Kings Bench,
 made so by the late King at 
Oxford,
 whose Son and Heir Mr. ........ 
Heath
 Esquire is now entituled to the Signorie of it.




Bredge
 gives name to the whole Hundred wherein it is placed, and in Times of a more ancient Date, was clasped up within that Revenue, which did augment the pater∣nal Inheritance of 
Cheyney,
 Sir 
Alexander de Cheyney,
 (as appears by ancient Muniments, was possest of this place in the reign of 
Edward
 the first, and is in the Register of those eminent persons who accompanied that Prince into 
Scotland,
 and was for his important Service against that Nation, made Bannerent by that King at 
Carlaverock,
 in the twenty eighth year of his Government, and from him did it by the links of severall Descents, after a large Efflux of Time devolve to 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney,
 who about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth
 passed it away to Mr. 
William Partrich
 Esquire, whose Grandchild Sir 
Edward Partrich
 not many yeers since conveyed it to Mr. 
Arnold Brame
 of 
Dover,
 descended from one of this Name who was Secretary to 
Charles
 the fifth.


Blackmanbury
 is a noted Seat in this Parish, and had still the same Owners in Times of a more ancient Character, with 
Garwinton
 in 
Bekesbourn,
 as namely the 
Garwintons,
 the last of which was 
Tho. Garwinton,
 who held it at his Death, which hap∣pened in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and by the Heir Generall of this Family it devolved to 
Haut,
 issued out from the 
Hauts
 of 
Hautsborne,
 and when this Fa∣mily determined, the Female Heir brought this Seat to 
Isaac,
 after 
Isaac
 was worn out of a great part of this Mannor of 
Blackmanbury,
 it became the Possession of 
Henry Lawrence
 Esquire, descended from the 
Lawrences
 of 
Dorsetshire,
 and he held it, as appears by a Court Roll in the thirty sixth year of 
Henry
 the eighth; and in both these Families was the joynt Propriety of this Mannor resident untill about the middle of the Reign of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then the whole Demise was by mutuall Consent passed away from 
Isaac,
 and 
Lawrence,
 to 
William Partrich
 Esquire, Grandfather to Sir 
Edward Partrich,
 who not many yeers since conveyed it to Mr. 
Arnold Brame
 of 
Dover,
 and he upon the Foundation of the ancient Fabrick, hath erected that mag∣nificent Pile which obliges the Eye of the passenger, both to Admiration and Delight, and which like a 
Phaenix
 seems to have arose more glorious out of its Ruines.


Bereacre
 is a third Mannor in 
Bredge,
 which in the twenty first year of 
Edward
 the first acknowledged it self to be under the Signorie of 
Walter de Kancia,
 as appears by an Inquisition taken at the same time after his Death, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 7. But before the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, this Family was extinguished, and then it became the Propriety of 
Bereacre,
 who assumed his Name from this Mannor, and 
John de Bereacre
 paid a respective Supply for it (as appears by the Book of 
Aid
) at making the Black Prince Knight in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third. After 
Bereacre
 was gone out, the Family of 
Lichfield
 was concerned in the Possession, who likewise were Lords of much Land about 
Eastry, Tilmanston
 and 
Betshanger,
 and in this Name was the Title placed untill the twenty second year of 
Edward
 the fourth, and then 
Roger Lichfield
 by Sale conveyed it to 
William Haut,
 and he had Issue 
Richard Haut,
 who left only 
Margery,
 who by matching with 
William Isaac,
 resigned up this Mannor to the Possession of that Family, but long it was not planted in this Name, for before the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, it was alienated to 
Petit
 and 
Weeks,
 and they again not many yeers after transmitted it by Sale to 
Nailor
 of 
Renvill,
 from whom by the same Devolution it was almost in our Fathers Memory carryed down to 
Smith
 and 
Watkins.


Beauville, aliàs Bew
field,
 or 
Whitfield
 lyes in the Hundred of 
Bewisborough,
 is a small Parish mounted aloft on those Hills that run from 
Barham
 down to 
Dover
 Castle, The Lord 
Giles Badelesmer
 anciently held it, and gave it in Frank Marriage with his Daughter 
Elizabeth
 whom 
Jo. Northwood
 of 
Milton
 took to Wife, and here it con∣tinued with the Interest of this Family severall Descents, untill at last it devolved to 
John Northwood
 of 
Northwood
 in 
Milton
 abovesaid, from which Name and Family the Fate of Sale took it off, and brought it over about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth to 
Jo. Bois
 Esquire, Ancestor to Mr. 
Io. Bois
 of 
Fredvill
 Esquire now living, and in this Family the Possession is still resident.


The Mannor of 
Linacre
 is seated within the Circuit of this Parish, and gave both Seat and Sirname to a Family so called, and from whom 
Linacre
 that composed the

Latin Grammar in the Reign of 
Henry
 the ninth, was lineally extracted, but this Name here was expired, before the end of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then by some Court Rolls I find that 
Iohn Monins
 was invested in the Fee, and here for some Decursion of Time the Right and Interest of this Place did abide, untill at length about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, the Title by Sale fell under the Signory of 
Chelesford
 or 
Chelford,
 from which Name the same Fate conveyed it to Mr. 
Io. Bois
 whose Successor Mr. 
Io. Bois
 of 
Fredville
 Esquire, by descendant Right does now enjoy it.


East
 and 
West Berming
 in the Hundred of 
Twyford,
 was in Times of a very high Ascent the Possession of a Family who derived their Sirname from this Place, 
William de Bermeling
 dyed seised of it in the twenty second year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 27. and had likewise the Advowson of the Church, after him 
Robert de Berme∣lin
 held it in the thirty first year of 
Edward
 the first. 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 123. When this Family was gone out, the 
Freminghams
 came into the Possession, 
Iohn
 Son of 
Ralph de Fremingham
 was in the enjoyment of them at his Death, which was in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 145. and so was his Suc∣cessor 
John Fremingham
 in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 15. But after this I find no more of this Name interessed in the Possession the next Family which was invested in the Inheritance were the 
Pimpes,
 a Name very eminent and no lesse ancient in this Track, 
John Pimpe
 held them and 
Ledhock
 at his Decease, which was in the ninth year of 
Henry
 the fifth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 35. from whom the Title streamed down to 
Reginald Pimpe
 Esquire, in whose Tenure they were at his Death, which was in the sixteenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth; from 
Pimpe
 they were carryed away by Purchase to the noble Family of 
Stafford,
 Dukes of 
Buckingham
 and Earls of 
Stafford,
 in which Name they had not long continued, when 
Edward Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham
 in the thirteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth being convicted of high Treason for consulting with a Wizard and a Monke touching the Succession of the Crown, forfeited his Estate here and his Life together, and then King 
Henry
 the eighth, by royall Concession planted the Propriety of these Places in Sir 
John Rainsford
 one of his Privie Councell, and his Son Sir 
Henry Rainsford
 passed them away to Sir 
Henry Isley,
 and he having infortunately enwrapped himself in the unhappy Design of Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 an Attempt which was plausible and specious enough in the Intention of it, as being enamel'd and guilded over with the glorious Pretences of asserting the Orthodox Religion, and defending the publick Libertie against the Eruption of Strangers, but very ruinous and disastrous in the Effects and Conse∣quences of it, as was very visible upon this worthy Person, who in the first year of Queen 
Mary,
 was convicted of high Treason and executed at 
Sevenoke,
 where he dyed with as much Constancy and Alacrity of Spirit, as he had lived with Integrity, upon whose untimely 
Exit,
 the Crown seised upon his Estate, and that Princesse in the same year he was destroyed granted his Estate here to Sir 
John Baker
 her Attor∣ney Generall, from whom the Title and possession of 
Berming
 is flowed down to his Successor Sir 
John Baker
 Baronet, who in Right of this Descent, is now entituled to the Patrimony of both these Mannors.


Halls Place
 in this Parish gave Seat and Sirname to a Family so stiled, who in ancient Deeds were written 
At-Hall
 from their Habitation at some more eminent Mansion, but before the end of 
Edward
 the third this Family was vanished, and the Signory of this Place surrendered to 
Colepeper
 of 
Preston,
 yet some part of it I find by old Deeds was passed away to 
Clive,
 which 
Jo. Clive
 about the seventh of 
Henry
 the fourth alienated to 
Peter Colepeper,
 and he in the tenth year of the abovesaid Prince, conveyed 
Hall Place
 to 
Sampson Mascall,
 originally extracted from a place called 
Mascalls
 in 
Brenchley;
 and in this Family the Possession was fixed untill the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was conveyed to 
Alchorne,
 the Cradle or Fountain of whose Family was at 
Alchorne
 in 
Rotherfield,
 and in this Name is the Fee-Simple of this Place still resident, though the use and profits of it be for a long Series of years made over to Mr......... 
Cook
 late of 
Stepney,
 and his Descendants.


West-Bere
 stiled so in Opposition to 
Bere
 in St. 
Margarets
 nere 
Dover,
 with the Appendant Mannor of 
Hopland,
 is situated in the Hundred of 
Blengate,
 the last of which was not called so from the growth and production of 
Hops
 there formerly

planted, as the vulgar Tradition affirms, the Introduction of 
Hops
 into this Nation, being not of that Antiquity, but from a Family exceeding ancient, who, (as appears by Deeds without Date) were in elder Times possessors of it; but before the end of 
Edward
 the first, this Family was mouldered away, and and then the emi∣nent Family of St. 
Lawrence,
 who likewise were Lords of 
West-Bere
 by purchase from 
Hugh de Bere,
 and about the latter end of 
Edward
 the first, were invested in the Tenure of both, claimed the propriety, and 
Thomas St. Lawrence,
 and 
John de Swalclive
 paid Reliefe for their Lands at 
West-Bere
 and 
Hopland,
 as the Book of 
Aid
 instructs us in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third; and in this Family of St. 
Lawrence,
 did the Propriety of both these Mannors reside, untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then 
Hopland
 was conveyed to 
John Isaac,
 in which Name it was resident untill the latter End of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was conducted down by Sale to acknowledge 
Tourney
 of 
Saltwood,
 and he by a like Alteration transplanted his Interest in it not many years since into 
Steed,
 but 
West-Bere
 came by the Daughter and Heir of this Family to 
Apulderfield,
 and again by the Female Heir of Sir 
William Apulderfield
 to Sir 
John Phineux,
 and he setled it on his second Brother the Heir Generall, of whose Descendant not many years since being wedded to Sir 
John Smith
 it is now become the Possession of his Grandchild 
Philip
 Viscount 
Strangford.


Bersted
 in the Hundred of 
Eythorne,
 was the Seat of the noble Family of 
Crevequer,
 before they removed to 
Leeds
 Castle their Seat and Residence, and in 
Doomsday
 Book where there is a particular Account taken what Mannors 
Hamon de Crevequer
 was possest of in the twentieth of 
William
 the Conquerour, it is written 
Briested,
 which could not be meant of 
Brasted,
 which was the Signory and Possession of 
Gilbert de Clare
 in the Reign of 
Henry
 the first, as appears by the Records of 
Christ-Church
 in 
Canterbury,
 where this Earl and his Successors are said to hold the Mannor of 
Brasted,
 as 
Senescalli Archiepiscopi Cantuariensis in sua Inthronizatione,
 whereas this Mannor had never any such Tenure united to it, and remained parcell of the Patrimo∣niall Demeasne of 
Crevequer,
 untill 
Hamon de Crevequer
 having embarked himself in the Quarrell of 
Simon de Montfort
 Earl of 
Leicester,
 made Shipwrack of his Estate here at 
Bersted,
 which was wrung from him by 
Henry
 the third, and though he was pardoned by the Pacification of 
Killingworth
 made in the fiftyeth of that Princes Reign, yet I do not find that he was ever reinvested in 
Bersted,
 so that it remained in the Crown untill the tenth year of 
Edward
 the second, and then it was exchanged for other Land with 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 but he having by an ambitious De∣fection forfeited this and much other Land in the fifteenth year of 
Edward
 the second, it lapsed back again by an early Confiscation to the Crown, and lay involved there until the fourth year of 
Edward
 the sixth, and then being looked upon as wrapped up in the Mannor of 
Leeds
 Castle as indeed it had been in Appendage unto that, and the Castellans of it, it was granted at that Time to Sir 
Anthony St. Leger,
 from whom it descended to his great Grandchild Sir 
Warham St. Leger,
 who about the latter end of King 
Iames
 exchan∣ged it with Sir 
Richard Smith
 for 
Salmeston
 in the Isle of 
Thanet,
 and two thousand pound in Money to poise the Exchange, and make the Ballance even, and he not long after passed it away to Sir 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Hollingbourn,
 who hath lately enstated it on his Son and Heir Sir 
Cheyney Colepeper,
 who is entituled to the present Signory of it.


Milgate
 in this Parish was anciently a Mannor, though now by Intermission the Homage is lost and shrunk into Disuse and Oblivion; It was in Ages of a more Antiquity, the possession of a Family called 
Coloigne, Robert de Coloigne
 was possest of it, and the Record taken after his Decease will inform you that he dyed seised of it in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 third, as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 52. 
Parte prima.
 And in this Name, melted by a softer pronunciation in Times of a lower Date into 
Coluney,
 did the propriety of it reside untill the Reign of 
Edward
 the fourth, and then by an old Survey of 
Bersted,
 I find it in the Hands of 
Thomas Coluney,
 and this was in the fourteenth of that Princes Reign, when most of this County was sur∣veyed, but after him I find no more of this Family entituled to the Possession, for in the Beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh it was annexed to the Inheritance of 
Stonehouse,
 whose ancient Seat was at 
Haselwood
 in 
Boughton Malherbe,
 where they flourished for

many Generations, even down unto our Times, and was constant to the Interest of that Name, untill the Beginning of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was passed away to Sir 
Thomas Floyd
 Receiver to that Princess, and Justice of the Peace for this County, and he much took off from the Obscurity of this Seat, by adding an additional Magnificence, by making the ancient Fabrick swell into the Dimensions not onely of a stately but an elegant Pile, by an augmentation of Building, and from him did it devolve by Descent to his Grandchild Mr. 
Thomas Floyd
 Esquire, who some few years since transplanted his Right in it by sale into Mr. ...... 
Cage.


There is another Mannor in this Parish called 
Stone-house,
 which formerly lay couched in that Revenue which gave support to the Priory of 
Christ Church,
 but upon the Resignation of the Demeasn of that Cloister into the Hands of 
Henry
 the eighth, it was by a new Grant linked to that Patrimony, which was to be subservient to the Interest of the Dean and Chapter of 
Christ Church,
 which had newly then from the Authority and Munificence of that Prince, received its first Establishment. And certainly from this place, did the 
Stone-houses
 both of 
Kent, Berkshire,
 and 
Buckinghamshire,
 either as Tenants to the 
Monks
 of the abovesaid Cloister, or else as having some Mansion, or Habitation of theirs, situated no far distance from this Mannor, anciently extract and spin out the primitive Original of their Name and Family: This is my conjecture, which I leave to more sober and severer Under∣standings either to embrace, or else abandon and discard.


Brabourne
 in the Hundred of 
Bircholt Franchises,
 was a Record drawn out of an old Manuscript, does engage me to affirm the Inheritance in Times of a very ancient Date of a Lady called 
Salburga
 the Words of the Record that strengthen this Assertion are these; 
Provaeda Matrona Nomine Salburga Domina de Brabourne Testamentum con∣stitit, ut qui tenerent Brabourne darent annuatim Sancto Augustino
 40 
Ambras Brasii,
 (that is, Plates of Brass) 4 
Boves,
 15 
Arietes,
 20 
Panes,
 1 
Piss. Butyri,
 1 
Piss. Casei,
 4 
Ca∣rucatas Lignorum
 (that is, four Carts Loads of Wood) 20 
Gallinas, eâ Lege ut Mo∣narchi singulis Diebus cantarent pro anima ejus, Psalmum Exaudiat te Dominus, &c.
 This Records attests the abovesaid Lady to have died about the year 864. In Times of a lower Descent, I find 
Alexander de Strabolgie
 Earl of 
Athol,
 who flourished here in the Reign of 
Henry
 the third, and 
Edward
 the first, to have held it, and from him did it devolve to his great Grandchild, 
David de Strabolgie
 Earl of 
Athol,
 who held it at his Death, which was in the thirtieth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 19. and left it to his Son 
David de Strabolgie,
 who dying in the forty ninth year of 
Edw.
 the third without Issue Male, 
Elizabeth
 matched to Sir 
Thomas Percy,
 from whose Heir General the Lord 
Borough
 of 
Ster-borough
 was descended, and 
Philippa
 wedded to 
John Halsham
 of 
Halsham
 in 
Sussex,
 shared his Inheritance: but this Mannor upon the Partition acknowledged her for Inheritrix, and She was in Possession of it at her Death, which was in the nineteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 31. and by a Right derived from her did 
John Halsham
 possess it at his Decease, which was in the second year of 
Henry
 the fifth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 8. and from him did it descend to his Son Sir 
Hugh Halsham
 Knight, who deceased in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and left onely 
Joan Halsham
 his Daughter and Heir, who was wedded to 
John Lewknor
 of 
Sussex
 Esquire, and so this Mannor by this Alliance became the Inheri∣tance of that Family, but made no long abode in their Name, for the abovesaid 
Io. Lewknor,
 and 
Ioan
 his Wife in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the fourth passed it away to Sir 
Iohn Scott
 Comptroller of the House to K. 
Edward
 the fourth, and from this Sir 
Iohn Scott
 is Mr. 
Edward Scott
 Esquire, by an uninterrupted Chanell of an Original un∣questioned Descent extracted, who is at this instant, by a Right transplanted unto him from many illustrious Predecessors, entituled to the Possession of this place.


Bircholt
 in this Parish, is made more eminent in this Account, because it affords a Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is situated; by Deeds of a very reverend and venerable Aspect, which by the obsolete and antiquated Character seem to have been written in the Time of K. 
Iohn
 and 
Henry
 the third, it is made the Inheritance ori∣ginally of a Family called 
Bircholt; Stephen de Bircholt
 possessor of this Mannor paid respective Aid for it (as appears by the Book of 
Aid
) at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third. But after the Reign

of this Prince, I do not find long permanent in this Family, for in the Reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, several old Court Rolls discover to me one 
Richard Halk
 or 
Hawke
 of 
Westhawks
 in 
Kingsnoth,
 to be planted in the Possession, and an old 
Arbor Radicalis
 or Tree from whence branches out the several Descents of 
Hawk
 or 
Halke,
 and which is now preserved amongst the Evidences of 
Bircholt
 House; this Family is made to have been Proprietaries of this Mannor ever since the Beginning of 
Richard
 the se∣cond, nor is yet departed from the Name, but remains at this instant knit to the rest of the Demeasn of this ancient Family.


Heminge
 is the last place of account in 
Brabourne,
 which anciently yielded both Seat and Sirname to a Family of that Appellation; I shall not need to make a Reca∣pitulation from Deeds without Date, of the Antiquity of this Family at this place, it is enough that I shall inform the Reader that after it had been the Possession of this Name (as may be traced out by Evidences) almost three hundred years, it was con∣veyed by 
William Heminge
 in the second year of 
Edward
 the sixth to 
Peter Nott,
 in which Name the Title is now resident.


Benenden
 in the Hundred of 
Cranbrooke
 was, as 
Doomesday
 Book informs me, if not all yet for a principal part of it possest by one 
Godricus
 or 
Godric. In Benenden mansit Godricus
 (says the Record) 
& tenet XX. Acras in Alodio suo.
 What this 
Alodium
 was, the 
Civilians,
 and out of them Sir 
Henry Spilman
 in his Glossarie will inform you. 
Alodium est praedium liberum
 (saith he) 
nulli Servituti obnoxium, quod opponitur Feudo, nam olim Feuda non possent vendi sine consensu Domini. At Alodium vero est. quod per omnem haere∣dum seriem discurrit, & cuivis è populo (etiam reclamante Domino) dare possit aut venundari.
 The result of all which is this, that the word 
Alodium
 signifies a Free Inheritance or Patrimony, not chained up to any particular Service whatsoever, which hath the least Resemblace or symtome of servitude, either by Custome, Prescription, or Law imprinted upon it, and may in 
English
 be styled Free Soccage, and which being trans∣mitted and conducted along by an uninterrupted Series of Descent from Posterity to Posterity, might be pawned, mortgaged or alienated to any Person whatsoever; whereas on the contrary, Lands which were Feudal could not be passed away without the Lords consent: And this agrees with the Municipal Laws of 
France,
 which an∣ciently styled those Persons whose Lands were fortified with that Tenure, 
Leuds Francs, id est, Nobiles nullius Domini Imperio evocati, Homines sui Juris, & non Feu∣dalis, id est, nullo Feudi Gravamine coerciti vel restricti;
 that is, Men of a noble Ex∣traction, free and unrestrained, whose Demeasns were not manacled and tyed up with the Obligations of any Tenure which was Servile, as those whose Lands were Fendal: But enough of this, I shall now return to 
Benenden,
 which as it gave Seat to the above mentioned 
Godricus,
 so it seems his Descendants extracted there Sirname from thence, and assumed the Denomination of 
Benenden,
 and bare for their Armes in a Shield 
Azure
 a 
Lobster Or,
 and certainly were of Account in this Track, for 
John
 the Son of 
Roger de Benenden,
 held a Knights Fee in 
Benenden
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third: But as all Families are chained up to a fixed Period, (like the Sea which is it self bound in with a Girdle of Sand) so had this its conclusion likewise, for 
Joan Benenden
 the Heir General of this Name, by matching with Sir 
William Brenchley
 Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, fastned this Mannor to his Inheritance, and they both lie buried in 
Christ Church
 in 
Canterbury,
 He died, as the Date upon their Tomb, for they slumber under one Marble, insorms me, in the year 1446, and She in the year 1453. But after his Decease the Title of this place, did quickly acknowledge another Proprietary, for the Heir General of this Family matched to 
More
 of 
More Court
 in 
Ivy-Church,
 where having been many Genera∣tions, they dislodged from so solitary an Habitation, and planted themselves at 
Be∣nenden,
 where they erected a House and adopted it into their own Name, by styling it 
More Court,
 but though it still stand an Alphabet to the Memory of this Family by bearing their Sirname, yet did it not many years after its first Institution and Frame acknowledge the Signory of this Family, for 
John More
 Esquire, in the first year of Q. 
Mary,
 conveyed it to Mr. 
William Watts,
 from whom by successive Right it is now come down to Mr. ......... 
Watts,
 and owns him for its present Proprietary.


The Mannor of 
Hempsted
 in this Parish, anciently, that is, about the twentieth year

of 
Henry
 the third, belonged, as appears by the Book in the Exchequer, called 
Testa de Nevil,
 to 
Robert de Hempsted,
 from whence he assumed his Sirname, which could not make the Title long liv'd in his Family; for about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the third, I find it passed away to 
Echingham
 of 
Sussex,
 and 
James de Echingham
 held it by the fourth part of a Knights Fee, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at making the Black Prince Knight; but after this the Title was not long constant to the Interest of this Family; for about the Beginning of 
Richard
 the second, I find it in the Hands of Sir 
Robert Belknap
 the Judge, who being attainted in the tenth year of that Prince, by the Malice and crooked Arts of a factious and insolent Nobility, there was Survey taken of his Estate in the fourteenth year of his Reign, and then this Mannor with the residue of his Estate escheated, being annexed to the Crown, it was by 
Richard
 the second granted to 
William de Guldford
 Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the eleventh year of that Prince, descended from 
Henry de Guldford,
 a great Benefactor to the Priory of 
Taning,
 in the twenty eighth year of 
Edw.
 the first, and who is mentioned in the Book of 
Aid
 to have held the Mannor of 
Wickham
 near 
Lidde
 in 
Kent,
 by Knights Service, in the twentyeth year of 
Edward
 the third; and the abovesaid 
William
 having thus by the Favour of his Prince obtained this Mannor, made it his Seat, and transmitted it to his Successors, who much improved it with the Supplement of Additional Buildings, so that it hath not only formerly for many Generations continued to be the Seat of this Familie, but is likewise a Mansion relating to this Name at this instant.


Great 
Maytham
 in 
Benenden
 was a Mannor which related to the Proprietie of the noble Family of 
Malmains,
 whose principal Seat was at 
Malmains
 in 
Stoke,
 in the Hundred of 
Hoo; Nicholas Malmain
 Grandchild of 
John Malmain
 who likewise held this Mannor in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third, paid a proportionate supply for 
Maytham
 at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of 
Edw.
 the third, and died possest of it in the twenty third year of that Prince: But after this it was not long permanent in this Name, for in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, 
Nicholas Carew
 held it at the Marriage of 
Blanch
 that Princes Daughter, and in his Family was the Title constant untill the latter End of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was passed away to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cromwell,
 afterwards created Earl of 
Essex,
 who being convicted of High Treason in the thirty second year of 
Henry
 the eighth, it escheated to the Crown, and that Prince in the thirty third year of his Rule granted it to Sir 
Thomas Wiatt,
 who the same year conveyed it by Sale to Sir 
Walter Henley
 of 
Coursehorne,
 the Kings Serjeant at Law, and he not long after disposed of it to 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bedgbury
 Esquire, who had wedded 
Hellen
 one of his three Daughters and Coheirs, and he in the last year of 
Edward
 the Sixth alienated some part of the Land which related to it to 
Richard Parker
 and 
Anthony Franklin,
 but the Mannor it self rested in 
Colepeper
 of 
Bedgebury,
 untill the late King granted it away not many years since to Alderman 
Wright
 of 
London,
 as being forfeited to the Crowne, because the Lord of it did not pay those Scots and Assessements which were laid upon him towards the Reparation of the Banks of the Mersh; and by 
Margaret
 the Daughter and Coheir of the abovesaid Alderman, is it now become the Inheritence of Mr. 
Richard Cordall
 of 
London
 Esquire.


Lowden
 or little 
Maytham
 is the last Mannor in this Parish, and was wrapped up in that wide Estate which in this County claimed the Family of 
Atteleeze
 for Proprie∣taries, Sir 
Richard Attleeze
 held four Knights in 
Rolvenden
 and 
Benenden
 in the twen∣tieth year of 
Edward
 the third, whereof this was parcell, but he dying without Issue in the year 1394, as is manifest by the Date on his Tomb in 
Shelwich
 Church, 
Mar∣cellus Attleeze
 his Brother became the Heir to his Estate, but this Mannor was not long after resident in this Name, for in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, which happened about the year 1403, (as appears by the Record kept in the Exchequer, called the Roll of 
Blanch
-Lands) it was possest by 
Thomas Aucher,
 and he paid re∣spective Aid for it at the Marriage of 
Blanch
 that Princes Daughter, and from him did it devolve by Descent to his Grandchild 
John Aucher
 of 
Losenham
 Esquire, who concluded in 
Ann Aucher
 his sole Heir, who was matched to 
William Colepeper
 second Son of Sir 
John Colepeper
 of 
Bedgebury,
 and so this Mannor with much other Land came to own the Dominion of that Name, and remained annexed to that Family

many Descents, untill not many years since it was by Sir 
John Colepeper
 of 
Losenham
 created Lord 
Colepeper
 at 
Oxford,
 passed away to his Brother in Law Mr. ...... 
More.


Bethersden
 in the Hundred of 
Chart
 and 
Longbridge,
 contains several places in it considerable, the first that summons our Notice is 
Bethersden Lovelace,
 which cele∣brates the Memory of a Family called 
Grensted,
 now vulgarly styled 
Grenstreet,
 who were its elder Proprietaries, the last of whom was 
Henry de Grensted
 a man of emi∣nent Repute, as the Records of this County testifie, in the Reign of 
Edward
 the second, and 
Edward
 the third, but fell under some Umbrage and Obscurity, when he passed away his Estate here to 
Kinet,
 in whom the Possession was very volatile, for 
William Kinet
 in the fourty first year of 
Edward
 the third, conveyed it by Sale to 
Jo. Lovelace,
 who here erected that Structure that for so many Descents hath born the Name of this Family, and was the Seminary or Seedplot from whence a Race of Gentlemen issued forth, who have in Military Affairs atcheived Reputation and Honour, with a prodigal Losse and Expence both of Blood and Life, and by their deep Judgement in the municipal Laws have deserved well of the Common Wealth, and as by their Extraction they are descended from noble Families, so from hence have sprung those of 
Bayford
 in 
Sedingbourn
 and 
Kingsdown,
 with the right Honorable the Lord 
Lovelace
 of 
Hurley,
 and other Gentlemen of that Stem in 
Barkeshire;
 but alas! this Mansion is now like a Dial when the Sun is gone, that then only is of use to declare that there hath been a Sun, for not many years since Colonel 
Richard Lovelace
 eldest Son to Sir 
William Lovelace
 the last of this Name at this Place, passed away his Right in 
Bethersden Lovelace
 to Mr. 
Richard Hulse
 descended from the ancient Family of 
Hulse
 of 
Norbury
 and 
Astly
 in 
Cheshire.


Surrenden
 the elder House to that of 
Pluckley,
 for they both had one Ancestor, was the Seat for many Generations of Gentlemen of that Name, in Deeds without Date they are frequently written 
Suthrinden,
 and continued here untill the Reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, for in the second year of 
Henry
 the fourth, I find by a Fine levyed that year that 
Robert Surrenden
 sells Lands in 
Bethersden
 to 
John Goldwell,
 and this 
Robert
 had Issue 
John,
 who passed it away about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth to Cardinal 
Kemp,
 who setled it in the twenty eighth year of the abovesaid Prince on the Colledge of 
Wye,
 then newly by him erected, but when that Colledge and all its Demeasne was in the thirty sixth year of 
Henry
 the eighth surrendred into the hands of that Prince, it was by Grant united about the thirty seventh year of his Rule, to to the Patrimony of Sir 
Maurice Dennis
 Captain of 
Calais,
 and he in the second year of 
Edward
 the sixth alienated it to Sir 
Anth. Aucher,
 in whom it was resident but untill the fourth year of that Prince, for then it was conveyed by Sale to 
Philip Chowte
 Esquire, Standard-bearer to King 
Henry
 the eighth at the Seige of 
Boloign,
 where he wan and at cheived much Honour to himself and Posterity, which was re∣markably testifyed by his Soveraigns Assignation of a Canton of that Standards im∣pression to his ancient Coat, 
viz. Partie per pale Argent
 and 
Vert,
 a 
Lyon Passant Gardant Gules,
 and from this worthy Person did 
Surrenden
 by Paternal Devolution come down to his Successor Mr. 
Edw. Chowte,
 being lately deceased, it is with some Restrictions and Reservations by Will, bequeathed to his only Brother Mr. 
George Chowte,
 whose Ancestors having very much enhaunsed and improved the Beauty of the ancient Structure, by additional Buildings, it hath now contracted the Title of 
Surrenden Chowte,
 as that at 
Pluckley
 hath assumed to it self that of 
Surrenden Dering.


Frith
 is the last place of Account in this Parish, it was in Ages of an higher date, the Patrimony of the 
Mayneys,
 as appears by several old Deeds now in the hands of Mr. 
George Chowte,
 who were a younger branch issued out from that Stem which was planted at 
Tunstall,
 as is evident by an old Latin Will of 
John de Mayney,
 who dyed possest of this place in the fiftyeth year of 
Edward
 the third, where he gives an 
Obit
 to pray for his own and the Soul of his Kinsman Sir 
Walter de Mayney;
 after the 
Mayneys
 were departed from the Possession of this Mannor, the 
Darrells
 of 
Cale Hill
 became the Proprietaties of it, and in the Reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, by several Deeds, too redious in this place to enumerate, I find 
John Darrell
 to be possest of it, and in this Name was the Title permanent untill the latter end of the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was passed away to 
Gibbons,
 descended from 
Hole
 in 
Rolvenden
 the

originall Fountain and Seminary of this Family, the last of which Family at this place was 
Thomas Gibbon
,
 in our Crandfathers Memory concluding in 
Lidia Gibbon
 his Daughter and Heir, she by matching with 
Edward Chowte
 of 
Surrenden
 Esquite, hath made it now the Inheritance of his Grandchild Mr. 
George Chowte
 Esquire.


In a peculiar Chancel on the Northside, the Parish Church of 
Bethersden
 belonging to 
Lovelace
 there was a perpetuall Chauntry founded about the thirty eighth year of 
Hen.
 the sixth, by 
Richard Lovelace
 Mercer and Merchant Adventurer of 
London,
 a younger Son of this Family, which was confirmed by the Royall Authority of the abovesaid Prince.


Brenchley
 in the Hundred of 
Harmondon Twyford,
 was parcel of that vast Patri∣mony which was entituled to the Signory of the Earls of 
Glocester
 and 
Hertford,
 whose Sirname was 
Clare, Robert de Clare
 Earl of 
Glocester
 and 
Hertford
 held it at his Death, which was in the twenty first year of 
Edward
 the first, and lest it to his Son 
Gilbert de Clare,
 who deceasing in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the second without Issue, 
Hugh de Audley
 in right of his Wife, Sister and Heir to the abovesaid 
Gilbert,
 (whom our Printed Books of 
Nobility
 call 
Isabell,
 though in the Inquisition taken after his Death, which was in the twenty first of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 39. She is styled 
Margaret
) entered upon the Inheritance of this place but the Fatality of the other Family did likewise cleave to this, for the Spindle prevailed against the Spear; 
Margaret
 being Sole Daughter and Heir to this 
Hugh Audley,
 in whom the Name at, this place met with a sad enterment, and the Estate by her matching with 
Ralph Stafford
 Earl of 
Stafford,
 found another Proprietary, and he in her Right held it at his Decease, which was in the forty sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, and transmitted it to his Son 
Thomas
 Earl of 
Stafford,
 who likewise was in the enjoyment of it at his Death, which happened in the sixteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, and from him was the Possession transported along by an unbroken Thread of Descent to 
Edward Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 and Earl of 
Stafford,
 a Man magnificent, but infortunate, who being accused of high Treason, attainted and beheaded in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and his Estate here confiscated in the thirteenth, and rested in the Crown untill the abovesaid Prince in the thirty first year of his Reign granted it to 
Paul Sidnor,
 and he not long after passed it away by Sale to 
William Lambert
 Esquire, who setled it upon the Colledge of Alms people at 
Greenwich,
 which is vulgarly called Q. 
Elizabeths
 Colledg, with a Limitation reserved, that the Heirs male of his Line might hold it in Lease for ever, and in case they might fail, that the last might dispose of it by Testament or Deed to whom he pleased; by virtue of which Reser∣vation, Mr. 
John Lambert
 of 
Sevenoke
 Esquire is at this instant Lessee to the Colledge for this Mannor.


Bokinfold
 in this Parish is an eminent Mannor which belonged to that Chauntry and Chappel which was founded here by 
Hamon de Crevequer
 (and confirmed as appears by the first Book of 
Compositions,
 kept amongst the Records of the Church of 
Rochester,
) with the Demeasne appertaining to it, in the forty first year of 
Ed.
 the third, and continued being thus forseited and secured by the Royal Charter, untouched, untill the generall Suppression; and being dissolved, the Revenue which anciently supported it, was in the thirty first of 
Henry
 the eighth, carried of by Grant to 
Paul Sidnor
 Esquire, who not long after passed it away to Sir 
John Gates,
 to whom it was again confirmed in the first year of 
Edward
 the sixth; but he being infortunately attainted in the fourth year of the abovesaid Prince, as being one of the Partisans of the Duke of 
Somerset,
 to whose Service, and for whose Cause he sacrificed his Head, this returned to the Crown, and dwelt in its Revenue untill Queen 
Elizabeth
 granted it away again to 
Katharine Tong,
 who suddenly after alienated her Interest in it to 
Revell,
 and he about the latter End of Queen 
Elizabeth
 passed it away to 
Colepeper,
 from whom in our Fathers Me∣mory it went away to 
Dyke,
 and very suddenly from him again to Mr. 
Benedict Barnham,
 by one of whose four Daughters and Coheirs it came to be the Patrimony of 
Soam,
 who lately hath demised his whole Concernment in it to Mr. 
George Brown
 formerly of 
Spelmonden
 in 
Kent,
 now of 
Buckland
 in 
Surrey.


There was formerly a Park at this Place, for in the second year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Bartholomew de Badelesmer
 held the Mannor and Park of 
Bockinfold
 in Fee, by

grant from that Prince, and the advowson of the Free Chappel of the same; and 
Edward
 the second in the nineteenth year of his Reign, being on his way to 
France,
 to do his Homage for the Dutchy of 
Apuitain,
 suddenly drew back his Foot, and retired to this Place, where he reposed himself, and caused many to be indicted for their unlawfull and irregular hunting in the Park at 
Bokinfold,
 nor hath Time so dismantled or disparked it, but that yet there are some Memorials or 
Vestigias,
 remai∣ning which attest the Truth of the Premises.


Criolls Court
 is another Manor in 
Brenchley,
 which by 
Joan
 Daughter of 
Bertram de Crioll,
 and Heir Generall of her Brother 
John de Crioll
 it came to Sir 
Richard de Ro∣kesley,
 and by his Daughter and Heir 
Joan
 to 
Thomas de Poynings
 whose Successor Sir 
Ed. Poynings
 dying in the twelfth year of 
Hen.
 the eighth without Issue or any collateral Alliance, in the fourteenth year of that Prince it escheated to the Crown, afterwards it was granted in the thirty first year of that Prince to 
Paul Sidnor
 Esquire employed as Agent to that Prince into 
Spain
 and he not long after alienated it to 
William Lambert
 Esquire, who setled it upon the Colledge of poor people at 
Greenwich
 of his Erection, with a Reservation that the Heits male of his Line might hold it in Lease for ever, by virtue of which limitation it is now enjoyed by Mr. 
John Lambert
 of 
Sevenoke
 Esquire.


Parrocks
 in this Parish was anciently a Mannor relating to a Family of that Denomi∣nation, which continued Lords of the Fee untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then it was by Sale conveyed to 
William Hextall
 Esquire, who dying without Issue male, 
Margaret
 his sole Daughter and Heir brought this and much Land beside to be the Inheritance of 
William Whetenhall
 Esquire, from whom the right of Descent wafted it down to his Successor Sir 
Richard Whetenhall,
 who in the twelfth year of Queen 
Elizabeth
 demised it to 
William Brooke
 Lord 
Cobham,
 who not long after passed it away to Sir 
Thomas Nevill
 Grandfather to the right honorable 
Mildmay
 Earl of 
Westmerland
 now Possessor of it.


Mascals, Capgrove
 or 
Capgrave,
 and 
Chekeswell,
 are three Mannors in 
Brenchley
 also, which as the Book of 
Aid
 informs me, were in the tweneieth year of 
Edward
 the third, in the possession of 
John de Capgrave,
 and it is probable that 
John Capgrave
 an eminent Monk, an Ornament to Learning, and to the Priory of 
Christ Church,
 who flourished in the year 1484, and is mentioned with so much Honour by 
Pitseus,
 was descended from this man, in whose Name these Mannors were not after this long permanent, for as the learned and laborious 
Sidrach Petit
 does informe me in his Inquest of 
Kent,
 they fell in the Reign of 
Richard
 the second, under the Signory of 
Vaux,
 whose Successor about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth alienated his Propriety in them to 
Humphrey Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 whose infortunate Grandchild 
Edward
 Duke of 
Buckingham
 being attainted in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, these with the Residue of his Estate escheated to the Crown; from which not many years after, they were passed away to 
Edward Ferrers
 Esquire, and he conveyed his Right to 
Whetonhall,
 who about the beginning of King 
James
 demised them to 
Ouldsworth,
 who not long after sold them to 
Bartue,
 and he almost in our Memory transmitted them by Sale to Mr. 
Cha. Tucker
 Father to the present Owner.


The Rectory of 
Brenchley
 was given by 
Richard de Clare
 to the Canons of St. 
Mary Magdalen
 in 
Tunbridge,
 and compounded with the Bishop of 
Rochester,
 with this Provision reserved, that the Rector for the Time being should pay two wax Tapers of four pound Weight to the Priory of 
Tunbridge
 at the Feast of St. 
Mary Magdalen.
 The Mannor which was annexed to this Rectory, was upon the Dissolution of this Cloister in the thirty first year of 
Henry
 the eighth granted to 
Paul Sidnor,
 and he not long after passed it away to 
William Waller
 Esquire, from which Family not many years since it was by Purchase invested in the Family of 
Courthop.


Moatlands
 was the Inheritance of a Family who extracted their Sirname from hence, and were called 
Brenchley,
 a Branch of which was Sir 
William Brenchley
 Lord Cheif Justice of the Common Pleas, who founded a Chauntry or Chappel in the Navy of the Cathedral at 
Canterbury,
 and dyed in the year 1446 without Issue; nor did these Lands continue much longer in the Name, for in the Beginning of 
Edward
 the fourth I find them in the Tenure of 
More,
 who had matched with the Heir Generall, and here the Propriety of this place remained interwoven, with the Inheritance of this Family untill that Age which fell under our Fathers Remembrance, and then it

was transplanted by Sale into 
Roberts,
 the Family with now possesses it.


There are two other Seats in this Parish, which may deserve our notice; the first is 
Cats-Place,
 which gave Seat to 
Hugh de Cat,
 and in Recompence took its Denomination from him, and after the Title of it had lodged in this Name many Descents, even until the Reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, it was passed away to 
Tilden,
 of 
Tildens Place
 in 
Marden;
 and after the Possession had some Ages been united to their Interest, it was some few years since unfastned, and the Propriety of it carried over to 
Bassage.


The second is 
Vanes,
 which yielded both Seat and Sirname to as Illustrious a Family as any in this Track, 
Robert Vane
 or 
Fane
 (for they are proimiscuously so written in ancient Rolls) paid respective Aid for it, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth of 
Edward
 the third, and is from him by a continued Series still transported along in the Demeasn of this Name and Family; so that here (if my Light fail me not) should I look for the original of that Noble Name and Family, that since hath so fairly spread into so many several Branches issued primitively from this first original Stem.


Bredgar
 in the Hundred of 
Milton,
 hath several places in it observable; The first is 
Bexon,
 from whence the Borough of 
Bexon
 or 
Bexon Street
 derives it self; It gave Sirname to a Family in whom in clder Times the Inheritance was planted, and there is yet extant in the Church Windows in coloured Glass a superannuated Portraicture mangled by rude hands, and demolished almost by the Injuries of Time, with this Inscription affixed to the pedestal, 
Orate pro Anima Joannes de Bexon,
 which disco∣vers to us whose Effigies is represented by it; this 
Iohn Bexon
 flourished in the Reign of 
Edward
 the second, as appears by Deeds, and 
Edward
 the third, and had Issue 
Iohn Bexon
 likewise Rroprietary of this place, after whom I can track no more of the Family at 
Bredgar:
 In the Reign of 
Richard
 the second, I find it invested in 
Tong,
 who it is probable were extracted originally from 
Tong,
 not far distant, a Family of good estimate in this County, for I find by some old Deeds, that 
Semanus de Tong
 who in the sixteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, was Tenant to the 
Maison le Dieu in Ospringe,
 for Lands at 
Lurdinden
 in 
Challock,
 sealed with a 
Bend cotised
 between six 
Martletts,
 and sometimes with the 
Bend uncotised,
 and from him are the 
Tongs
 who are now Possessors of this place, originally descended.


Swanton Court
 was parcel of that Estate which claimed the Lords 
Leybourn
 for Proprietaries, and from them descended to the Heir General of the Family, 
Iuliana de Leybourn,
 who dying in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third without Kindred, or without Issue, either by 
Hastings
 or 
Clinton,
 this upon a Defailance of both escheated to the Crown, and King 
Edward
 the third, in the fiftieth year of his Reign setled it upon the Abby of 
Grace
 upon 
Tower Hill,
 in whose Reverue it rested until the Suppression of that Cloister, and then it was by 
Henry
 the eighth in the thirty sixth year of his Reign granted to 
Christopher Sampson,
 and he in the second year of 
Edward
 the sixth conveyed it to Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 and he being attainted in the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 it returned by escheat to the Crown, from whence by a new concession it came over to 
Reader,
 who not many years since conveyed his right in it to 
Aldersey,
 branched out from the ancient Family of 
Aldersey,
 of 
Aldersey
 in 
Cheshire:
 so that it is now the Inheritance of 
Terrey Aldersey
 Esquire.


The Colledge of 
Bredgar
 was converted from a Parish Church, first into that we now call a Colledge, by 
Robert
 then Parson thereof in the reign of 
Richard
 the second, which was establishsd and ratified (saith 
Harpsfield
) by 
Thomas Arundell
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury;
 and in this Capacity or posture it stood until the Dissolution, and then being born away into the royal Revenue, it was by Exchange with the Crown, in the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, annexed to the revenue for the future of the Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury.


There is a place in this Parish called 
Mans,
 as being in elder Times a Mansion of that Name, as Deeds both of an ancient and modern Date do inform me, which whether it were the ancient Seat of the 
Mans,
 who have since been transplanted to 
Canterbury,
 is un∣certain; onely it is very probable, because it had Proprietaries of that Denomination, that this was the Fountain whence this Family issued forth.




Brenset
 in the Hundred of 
Aloesbridge
 had still the same Proprietaries with 
Newing∣ton Belhouse
 near 
Hieth,
 and therefore is called 
Newington Brenset;
 and thither for farther satisfaction I shall refer my Reader, only I must inform him, that here is an old Mansion in this Parish, which for several Descents was the Seat of the 
Edolphs,
 before they were transplanted to 
Hinxhill,
 and certainly in elder Times were of good Account in this County, and writ their Names in old Deeds 
Edulf;
 for so is 
Stephen Edulf
 written in an old Commission, directed to him, 
John Peckham
 and 
Martin Horne,
 wherein they were made Collectors for the Cinque Ports in the sixth year of 
Richard
 the second; but now this Family hath deserted this Place, having not many years since alienated their Interest here to Mr. 
John Fagge
 of 
Rye,
 Father to 
John Fagge
 of 
Wiston
 in 
Sussex
 Esquire, to whose Revenue it remains now annexed.


Betshanger
 in the Hundred of 
Eastry,
 was in elder Times the Patrimony of a Family called 
Marney
 or 
Marin
 for so the Name is promiscuously written; 
Jo. de Marney,
 who is in some old Deeds called 
Marins,
 obtained a Charter of Free Warren to his Mannor of great 
Betshanger
 the first year of 
Edw.
 the first; but it seems this Franchise did but improve the Sale, and make it more fit to be enjoyed by another, for not long after it was convey∣ed to 
John de Soles,
 so called from his Habitation near some Ponds, and he died in the enjoyment of it, in the forty ninth year of 
Edw.
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 40. 
Parte secunda.
 But after this it was not long constant to the Signory of this Family, for about the Be∣ginning of 
Richard
 the second, I find it possest by 
Bertram de Tancrey
 Lord of 
Tancrey
 Island in 
Fordwich,
 and his Descendants enjoyed it until the latter end of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then it went away by Sale to 
Rutter;
 from which Name about the Be∣ginning of 
Edward
 the fourth, it came to 
Lichfield,
 whose Arms are yet visibly ob∣vious in ancient Pains of Glass at 
Dane Court
 in 
Tilmanston, viz. Bendee
 of six 
Pieces Azure
 and 
Ermin,
 and in this Family it continued until the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then by the Heir General of this Name it became united to the Pa∣trimony of 
Thomas Cox
 Esquire, Customer of 
Sandwich,
 who about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, conveyed it by Sale to Mr. 
John Bois,
 Ancestor to 
John Bois
 Esquire, who by Paternal Devolution is now entituled to the Signory of it.


Little Betshanger
 was a Seat relating to the Family of 
Cliderow,
 which in elder Times was of eminent Account in this Track, yet I find that 
Iohn de St. Philibert
 held Lands here in the thirty first year of 
Edward
 the third, but the Mannor it self was an Appendage to the above mentioned Family;

 
Roger de Cliderow
 flourished here in the Reign of 
Edward
 the second, and 
Edward
 the third, and as appears by Seals affixed to old Evidences, which commence from the last Kings Reign, bore for his Coat 
Armour
 upon a 
Cheveron
 between three 
Eagles
 five 
Annulets,
 his Successor 
Richard Cliderow
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the fourth and most part of the fifth year of 
Henry
 the fourth; he was constituted soon after Admiral of the Seas, from the 
Thames
 mouth along the 
Saxon
 Shore to the 
West;
 for in those Times the Admiral∣ty was divided sometimes into three, and most commonly into two Divisions, one beginning at the 
Thames
 mouth was Admiral of the 
Northern
 Seas, the second was Admiral from the 
Thames
 mouth 
Westward,
 and the third had the command of the 
Irish
 Seas; but in this man's Time King 
Henry
 the fourth, in the eighth year of his Reign, reduced it under one Person, and granted it with more ample and wide Authority under his Brother 
John Beauford
 Earl of 
Somerset.
 But to proceed after the Title of this place had remained locked up in the Demeasn of 
Cliderow,
 until the latter end of. 
Hen.
 the eighth, it passed away with the Female Inheritrix to 
Thomas Stoughton
 Esquire, by whom he had three Daughters, who were Coheirs to their Mother, 
Elizabeth
 matched to 
Thomas Wild
 Esquire, 
Helen
 married to 
Edward Nethersole,
 and 
Mary
 wedded to 
Henry Paramour,
 who by a joynt conveyance passe away their right to their Father in the twentieth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and he in the twenty first year by Deed re-enstates his right in them, and they again by a concurrent and mu∣tual consent alienate their Interest here in the twenty eighth year of her Rule to Mr. 
John Gookin,
 and he about the first year of King 
James
 conveyed it to Sir 
Henry Lodelow,
 who not many years since passed it away to Mr. 
Edward Bois
 of Great 
Betshan∣ger
 Father to Mr. 
John Bois
 Esquire, the present Lord of the Fee.




Bicknor
 in the Hundreds of 
Milton
 and 
Eythorn,
 was in elder Times the Habitation of a Family of that Sirname, Sir 
John de Bicknor
 and Sir 
Thomas de Bicknor
 accompanied King 
Edward
 the first in his successeful Expedition into 
Scotland
 and are found Recor∣ded in the Register or Bedroll of those Knights who were made Bannerets at 
Carla∣verock
 Castle by that Prince, in the twenty eighth year of his Government; but after this, this Mannor stayed not long in the Tenure of this Family; for in the Reign of 
Edward
 the second, it came to acknowledge the Dominion of 
Roger de Leybourn
 Baron of 
Leybourn
 Castle; from whom it descended to his Sole Daughter and Heir 
Juliana de Leybourn,
 who dying in the forty third year of 
Edw rd
 the third without Issue and without Kindred, it devolved by Escheat to the Crown, and then that Prince setled it by a new Donation on the Abby of St. 
Mary Grace
 on 
Tower-Hill,
 where it continued until the publick Suppression and then being surrendred up to the Crown, it was in the thirty sixth year of 
Henry
 the eighth granted to 
Christopher Sampson,
 and he in the second year of 
Edward
 the sixth passed it away to Sir 
Thomas Wiat;
 from whom not long after it came by the same conveyance to own the Interest of 
Reader,
 who about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth
 alienated his Right in it to 
Terry,
 who almost in our Memory, partly by Sale, and partly in respect of Alliance, setled the Propriety of it on 
Aldersey,
 so that Mr. 
Farnham Aldersey,
 a second Brother of 
Terrey Aldersey
 of 
Swanton Court
 Esquire, is now Lord of the Fee.


Biddenden
 in the Hundreds of 
Barkeley, Cranbroke
 and 
Blackbourn,
 had an old Family which took both Seat and Sirname from hence, and when this was consumed and va∣nished, the 
Mayneys
 were the next who were successively Possessors of it, 
John de Mayney
 died seised of this and other Lands confining upon it, in the fiftieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and was Son of Sir 
John de Mayney
 who flourished here, as appears by Deeds, under the worthy Character of Knighthood many years before; and to this Name was the Possession by a continued and unbroken Series of Ages wedded, until some years since the Title was by Sale divorced from this Family, and conveyed by Sir 
Anthony Mayney
 Knight and Baronet, to Sir 
Edw. Henden
 Chief Baron of the Exche∣quer; and he by Testament transmitted it to his Nephew Sir 
John Henden,
 who having lately paid a Debt to Nature which we all owe, his Son and Heir 
Edw. Henden
 Esquire, does at this instant enjoy it.


Allards
 is another ancient Seat in this Parish, which for many Generations past, until of late, acknowledged it self to be the Mansion of that Name and Family, and from hence was 
Gervas Alarar
 or 
Allard
 descended, who was Captain and Admiral of the Navy, set forth by the Cinque Ports in the first year of 
Edward
 the first, as appears, 
Pat.
 34. 
Edwardi primi,
 but now the Distaffe hath prevailed against the Lance; for this Name having been lately wound up in a Daughter and Heir, the Possession of it in her Right is now transplanted into Captain 
Terry Aldersey
 of 
Swanton Court
 in 
Bredgar
 Esquire.


Castwisell
 is a third place in 
Biddenden
 worth our Consideration, it was in Times very ancient Parcel of that Estate, which did in this County relate to the 
Moiles,
 extracted from 
Moiles Court
 at 
Bodmin
 in 
Cornwall,
 and certainly did as high acknow∣ledge the Signory of this Knightly Family, as any Land they held in this County, for though by some old Deeds not bounded with any date, I find the Name of 
John de Castwisell
 affixed as 
Teste,
 yet by those old Deeds and Muniments, which have an Aspect upon this Mannor, I discover that 
Walter Moile
 Knight in the sixth year of 
Edw.
 the third did grant to 
Reginald
 and 
William Sand:
 all those Lands, Tenements, Rents and Services which 
Simon Gidinden ad Formam
 late held of the said Sit 
Walter,
 as of his Mannor of 
Castwisell,
 and by a subsequent Deed dated in the twenty third year of 
Henry
 the sixth, I find that 
Margaret
 Widow of 
William Scapis
 of 
Burmersh,
 did grant to 
Walter Moile
 which was the Judge, all that Messuage and Land she held in 
Biddenden,
 and by a Deed of a more modern Inscription, that is one which comences from the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, I find that 
Thomas Moile
 of 
Eastwell
 Gentleman, afterwards dignified with the order of Knighthood by the abovesaid Prince, conveyed it to 
Stephen Rogers
 Gentleman, and from him is Mr. 
Jonathan Rogers,
 now possessor of this place, originally descended.




Bidborough
 is the last place which shuts up the 
Lowy
 of 
Tunbridge,
 here were Lands which were the Inheritance of a Family called 
Chauney,
 the first of whom with whom I meet with in Record is 
Thomas le Chauney,
 who paid respective Aid for it at making the Black Prince Knight (as appears by the Book of 
Aid
) in the twen∣tieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and continued in his Family divers years after his 
Exit;
 for in the latter end of 
Henry
 the fourth, I find 
George Chauney
 possest of it; but after him I can trace out no more of this Family who held it; the next who succeeded in the Possession were the 
Palmers,
 as is manifest by some old Court Rolls, which represent one 
Thomas Palmer
 to have been Lord of the Fee in the Reign of 
Ed.
 the fourth, and 
Henry
 the seventh, but made no long stay in this Name; for about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, it was alienated to 
John Vane
 Esquire, and the de∣scendant of this Family Sir 
Ralph Vane
 being attainted in the fourth year of 
Edw.
 the sixth, it escheated to the Crown, and Queen 
Elizabeth
 in the first year of her Rule granted it to 
Henry Cary
 Lord 
Hunsdon,
 of whom more hereafter.


Ramhurst
 is another little Mannor in 
Bidborough,
 which the Book of 
Aid
 informs me in the twentieth year of 
Ed.
 the third, to have been possest by a Family called 
Warehall,
 and remained in their possession until the Reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then it was passed away to 
Colepeper,
 whose Ancestor 
John Colepeper
 died seised of some Estate here in the forty eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, as appears, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 29. and in this Family was the Propriety resident until the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was transferred by Sale to 
Lewknor,
 from whom, in that Age which came within the Verge of our Grand-fathers Remembrance, it was alienated and demised to 
Dixon,
 in Right of which Conveyance it is the instant Possession of Mr. 
Edward Dixon
 Esquire.


There is an House in this Parish called 
Bounds,
 and in ancient Deeds called 
Bunds,
 which, as Tradition avers, was the utmost Margin or Limit which bounded that League of Earth which hath been since known by the Name of the 
Lowy
 of 
Tunbridge,
 and was given by 
Will. Rufus
 to 
Gilbert
 Earl of 
Briony
 and 
Eu,
 because his Castle of 
Briony
 had been before by Violence torn from him by 
Robert
 Duke of 
Normandy,
 because this Earl had been a Promoter, or at least a Fomenter of the Designs of his Brother King 
William.


The Mannor of 
Bidborough
 it self had the same owners with that of 
Tunbridge,
 as name∣ly, the Earls of 
Clare, Audley,
 and 
Stafford,
 and escheating by forfeiture to the Crown, upon the attaint of 
Edw. Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham
 in the twelfth year of 
Hen.
 the eighth, it was by Q. 
Elizabeth
 granted in the first year of her Reign to 
Henry Cary
 Lord 
Hunsdon,
 whose Son 
George Cary
 Lord 
Hunsdon
 dying without Issue Male his onely Inheritrix 
Elizabeth
 wedded to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Barkley
 linked it to his Patrimony, and he in the Be∣ginning of King 
James
 conveyed it to Sir 
Thomas Smith,
 Grand-father to 
Robert Smith
 Esquire, who lately died possest of it.


Bilsington
 in the Hundred of 
New-church,
 was folded up anciently in that Patrimony which acknowledged the Dominion of 
John Mansel,
 a man of eminent Note in the Reign of 
Henry
 the third, as appears by that Chain of offices which adorned his Greatness; for he was Constable of 
Dover
-Castle, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Provost of 
Beverley,
 for the abovesaid Prince, and Queen 
Eleanor
 his Wife, and Treasurer of the Church of 
York;
 but he not long enjoyed it, for he in the twenty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third, made God his Heir, and devested himself of the propriety of it, to settle it on the Priory of 
Bilsington,
 which was of his Foundation and Endowment, and by dedication entituled to the Patronage of the Virgin 
Mary,
 and was furnished with white Canons, or Canons 
Pramonstratenses;
 and in this condition did it remain, until not onely this, but all other Orders in this Nation, having warped and revolted from their original Integrity, and those closer Engage∣ments and narrower Restraints, the Rules of their primitive Institution tyed them up in, a dissolution of Mannors called for a Dissolution of Demeasn; but now, whether those who did so zealously pretend to correct their Lives, did not more seriously intend to reform the Ecclesiastical Patrimony, and arraign them, not according to the Guilt of their Crimes, but the Hainousness of their Estates, will fall under a sober Consideration; that the Excesses of the Romish Clergie were high, their Imper∣fections many, and their Irregularities clamorous, is without controversie; now what the Causes were which unfastned the Ligatures of streighter Discipline, which like

so many Nerves did both move and tie together all the Limbs of the Body Ecclesia∣stick, I shall now briefly discover: The first Cause of this Depravation was the removing and abating those Persecutions which had so long with a sad and bloody pressure grated upon Christianity, under the Scepter of ten Heathen Tirants; and we know that the Fable tepresents to us, that when the Laurell, the Guerdon, and Salary of Triumphs, and the Sweat of the Laborious shoulder, withered and shrunk into Decay, the Figge∣ttee sprang up our of its Ruines, which is the Emblematick Type of Softness and Effeminacy; and we read that the Lamps of 
Tullia
 and 
Terentia
 burnt with a clear and uninterrupted Flame, as long as they were Recluse to the Cloisters of their Urnes and Vaults, and dwelt in the Scene and Comprehension of Darkeness; but when they were brought out into the Publick, like Camphire, they evaporated into the Air that fed them: So the Primitive Christians who shone with such a bright and constant Beam in the Night and Agony of their Affliction, when they were melted with the warmth and Sun-shine or a calme and prosperous Fortune, began to slacken into Luxury and Excess, Folly and Disorder; and they that had dared Axes and Racks, Wheels and Gridirons, the Teeth of Beasts and the Fury of Men, the Heat of Persecution and the Flame of Oblation; and in brief, had been inexpugnable to all the Artifices and Engines of Torture, contrived by impious men, fell afterwards cheaply and tamely, like those who are smothered with Roses, stifled with Perfumes, and strangled with a silken Halter. The second Cause, that elder observations insi∣nuate to us, to have been the Reason of the Clergies deviation, is, that vast heap of temporal Treasure with which 
Constantine
 loaded the Bosome of the Church; so that it may be truly affirmed, 
Religio peperit Divitias, & Filia devoravit Matrem;
 for Poverty, though like a streight and narrow Girdle it does with its close and uneasie stricture pinch and afflict us, yet it keeps the Garment from falling into Loosness and Disorder; whilst superfluity of Wealth is apt to untie those Restraints which are cast upon the Will, and unshackle those Fetters which are laid upon the sensual Appetite, rendring our Thoughts vain and trifling, foolish and impertinent, and our under∣takings wild and irregular, making us soft and easie for the impressions of Vice; but difficult and uncapable of the influences of Vertue, and the nobler Designs of Religi∣on: For it is farther observable, that from Riches evaporate the Fumes of Luxury and Ambition, which like those Mists which exhale from the Crudities of a raw Stomach, debauch the understanding, and disorder Reason, and muffle them up in 
 Vaile and in a Cloud; and they that view the Light of Truth, which is the grea
 Lu∣minary in the Firmament of the Church, through the Vapours of secular Interest, are like those who take the Prospect of a Star, through a gross vaporous Body of Air: they behold it by the Chanel of so polluted a 
Medium,
 they view it in an uneven and incertain 
Paralax.
 The third Cause of the 
efection of Ecclesiastical Persons in the Church of 
Rome,
 from the severer Obligations of their original Institution, is this; the Pope had newly entituled himself to a vast and uncircumscribed Power, and found that there was an Obligation imposed upon him to support the Clergy in all their Excesses and vitious Sallies, that so they might be obliged to engage the Pulpit and the Pen, in the asserting of that Authority which the Western Emperors vainly endevoured by frequent Contests and Struglings to wring out of his Hands, and rein∣vest in themselves; and they looking up, and discovering that he beheld their Disorders with a calm and an indulgent Brow, let loose the Golden Reigns of Discipline; and it is no wonder if at any Time the Bridle of Government be slackned, when the Snaffle that should keep it steady and even, hath lost its two Bosses, Fear and Punishment.


But I have digressed, I now return; After the Suppression had entituled the Crown to this Maunor, which formerly supported the 
Convent
 of 
Bilsington,
 King 
Henry
 the eighth in the thirty seventh year of his Reign by Royall Concession made it the Inhe∣ritance of Sir 
Anthony St. Leger
 of 
Ulcombe,
 in which Family the Title was permanent, untill the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then his Son Sir 
Warham St. Leger
 passed it away to Sir 
Francis Barnham
 of 
London
 Knight,

 whose great Grand-childe Master 
Robert Barnham
 Esquire, by Paternal devolution and descent, does now claim the instant Signory of it.




Neither 
Bilsington
 in this Parish is that Mannor, which anciently was held by a Fa∣mily called 
Staplegate
 of 
Staplegate
 in 
Natindon,
 who claimed to be the Kings chie Butler at his Coronation. The first that I find possest of it was 
Edmund de Staplegate
 to whom it was derived by Purchase, about the middle of 
Edward
 the third; from 
Richard Fitz Allan
 Earl of 
Arundell,
 whose Ancestors held it many years before, and he having thus entered upon it by his Acquist, dyed possest of it in the twenty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 58, and left it to his Son and Heir 
Edmund de Staplegate,
 and he in the first year of 
Richard
 the second put in his claim to be chief Butler at his Coronation, as holding this Mannor by the Tenure of grand Serjeantry to discharge that Office; to evacuate his claim, 
Richard
 Earl of 
Arundell
 exhibits a Petition and Plea, wherein he asserts that the Office of chief Butler was never annex∣ed to this Mannor of 
Bilsington,
 that his Family had enjoyed it both before the Possession and after the Alienation of it, and therefore desired he might perform it that Solemn Day; upon the discussion of the whole Controversie, it was ordered, that that Day the Earl of 
Arundell
 should discharge it with a 
salvo jure,
 that it should not infringe the Right of 
Staplegate
 or any other that should pretend a Right or Title to it for the future. But to proceed, this Family held this Manor untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then the Fate of Sale carryed it away to 
Cheney,
 and Sir 
John Cheney
 Knight was seized of it at his Death, which was in the seventh year of 
Edward
 the fourth, and from him was it wafted down by the Thread of Descent to his Successor 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheney,
 who about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth
 alienated his Propriety in it to Sir 
Francis Barnham
 of 
London
 Knight, from whom by Successive Right the Title is now devolved to his great Grand-childe, Master 
Robert Barnham
 Esquire.


Birling
 in the Hundred of 
Larkfield,
 was belonging, when the great Survey of 
England
 was taken, called 
Doomsday
 Book, to one 
Ralph de Curva Spina,
 and tha anci∣ent Seat of those who were the possessors of it was at 
Comport
 or 
Comford
 Parke in this Parish; but before the End of 
Henry
 the second, the above mentioned Family was worn out, and then I find a Family called 
Crescie
 to succeed in the Inheritance, 
William de Crescie
 had a grant of Liberties in 
Birling
 in the fifth year of King 
John,
 but his Name and Family after this did not long continue to possess them, for before the Expiration of the long and tempestuous Reign of 
Henry
 the third, it was depar∣ted from them, and planted in th Revenue which did call that Family of 
Say
 Propri∣etaries; the first of whom was 
William de Say,
 who was one of those who stuck so close to the Cause and Quarrel of 
Simon de Montfort
 the active Earl of 
Leicester,
 after whose Ruine at the Battle of 
Evesham,
 and the total Discomfiture and Dissipation of of his Forces in that signal Conflict, he was found in the Register of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen who were pardoned by the pacification at 
Kenelworth,
 and died possest of it in the twenty third year of 
Edw.
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 48. and in some old Deeds it is called 
Caput Baroniae de Say;
 now the vulgar opinion was formerly that that thirteen Knights Fees and a half made up a Tenure 
per Baroniam
 now how much in value a Knights Fee was, was the Question in elder Times, some affirming it to be 50 l. others 30 l. and diverse again but 25 l. but the common received opinion is which hath been generally allowed of by all our Law Books, that it is in Estimate but 20 l. consisting of eight Carucates or Hides of Land for they are coincident allowing to every Carucate or Ploughed Land an 100. Acres, which was anciently thought to be as much as one team of Oxen could plough up in a year; but the Tenure it self which was compounded of these Knights Fees was altogether incertain, for unless it be that Manscript stiled 
Modus Tenendi Parliamentum,
 which is of no higher Age then the Reign of 
Edward
 the third, there is no Record does state or fix it, 
Walter de Meduana
 or 
Mayney
 Ancestor to the 
Mayneys
 of 
Linton
 held twenty Knights Fees as appears by the 
Red
 Book kept in the Exchequer, 
Folio
 84, yet was not under the Repute of a Baron, 
Walter de Wahull
 had the possession of 30. Knights Fees, and 
John de Port
 of 50. yet neither of them out of so vast a Tenure could multiply or inforce to themselves the Stile or Title of Baron, whereas on the contrary 
Roger de Leybourn,
 who marryed the Coheir of 
Vipont,
 and was really a Baron, makes a recognisance of his Service, as appears by 
Kirkbies
 Inquest kept in the Exchequer, and taken in the ninth

year of 
Edward
 the first, but for two Knights Fees and an half; from all which reci∣ted passages is evinced that this Title of Baronage flowed only from the Favour and Indulgence of the Prince, who by his Writ or Summons called those who had meri∣ted well by some worthy undertakings to this Dignity and Title, and not from the vastness of their Patrimony, though this did very much concurre afterwards to sup∣port their Baronage in its true Value and Lustre. But to proceed, 
Jeffrey de Say
 this Mans Successor had view of Franck Pledge here in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, that is, as appears by the Statute of Frank Pledge made in the eighteenth year of 
Edward
 the second, he was to take Cognisance of those Disorders and Excesses in his Court Baron that were committed by those which held in Free-Soccage of his Mannor of 
Berling,
 as well as of those which held in Knights Service or Villen age; and this 
Jeffrey
 in the thirty third year of 
Edward
 the third dyed possest of this place, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 37. and left it to his Son 
William de Say,
 who likewise was in the Tenure of it at his Death, which happened in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 43. 
Parte secunda,
 and transmitted it to his Son 
John de Say,
 who likewise held it at his Decease, which was in the sixth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 67. and from him did it devolve by descent to his Son and Heir 
Jeffrey
 Lord 
Say,
 who about the latter end of 
Richard
 the second alienated his Inte∣rest here by Sale to 
Richard Fitzallan
 Earl of 
Arundell,
 Lord Treasurer and Lord high Admirall of 
England;
 from whom it came over to his Son 
Thomas Fitzallan
 Earl of 
Arundell,
 and Lord Treasurer of 
England
 likewise, who dying in the year 1416. without Issue, 
Joan
 one of his Sisters matched to 
William Beauchampe,
 summoned to Parliament, as Baron of 
Aburgavenny,
 in the sixteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, became his Coheir, and so he by this Alliance was acknowledged for Lord of the Fee, but his Son 
Richard Beauchampe
 created Earl of 
Worcester
 in the year 1420, dying without Issue male in the ninth year of 
Henry
 the fifth, 
Elizabeth
 his sole Daughter and Heir by matching with 
Edward Nevill,
 who in her Right became Baron of 
Aburgavenny,
 annexed 
Birling
 and 
Comfort
 Parke to his Revenue, and he dyed possest of it in the sixteenth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, and from him did it descend to his great Grandchild 
Henry
 Lord 
Aburgavenny,
 who in the twenty ninth of Queen 
Elizabeth
 dying without Issue male, gave it to his Kinsman Sir 
Edward Nevill
 afterwards Baron of 
Aburgavenny,
 whose Grandchild 
John Nevill
 Lord 
Aburgavenny
 possesses now the Signory of it.


Bobbing
 in the Hundred of 
Milton
 was the ancient Seat of the illustrious Family of 
Savage, Roger de Savage
 obtained a Charter of Free Warren to his Lands at 
Bobbing Milsted,
 and elsewhere in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the second, his Father Sir 
John de Savage,
 was engaged with 
Edward
 the first, at the remarkable Siege of 
Carlaverock
 in 
Scotland;
 in the twenty eighth year of his Reign, and there for his Signal Service, was with 
Thomas Savage
 his Brother created Knight Banneret; Sir 
Arnold Savage
 this mans Grandchild was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the fourth and ninth years of 
Richard
 the second, and was afterwards Speaker of the Parliament, in the second year of 
Henry
 the fourth, as appeats by the late printed Abridgement of the Parliament Rolls preserved in the 
Tower,
 and was one of the Privie Counsell to that Prince, as appears by the private Evidences of this Family, his Daughter 
Eleanor
 was first matched to Sir 
Reginald Cobham,
 by whom she had no Issue, and after was remarried to 
William Clifford
 Esquire, Son of Sir 
Lewis Clifford
 Knight of the Garter, descended from 
Clifford
 of 
Cliffords
 Castle in 
Herefordshire;
 who upon the Decease of his Wifes only Brother, this Sir 
Arnold Savage
 without Issue in her Right, as Heir Generall entered upon his Estate here at 
Bobbing,
 and was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the fifth, and again in the thirteenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, his Kinsman 
Robert Clifford
 Esquire, Brother to 
Richard Clifford,
 first Arch-Deacon of 
Canterbury,
 secondly Bishop of 
Worcester,
 and thirdly Bishop of 
London;
 was Knight of the Shire for 
Kent,
 in the eighth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and lyes buryed in the middle Isle in the Body of 
Christ Church
 in 
Canterbury
 though now his Portraicture in Copper with the Inscription affixed, with the many Coats declaring his Descent and Alliance, are torn off and defaced; the above mentioned 
William
 had Issue, 
Lewis
 and 
John, Lewis
 had Issue 
Alexander Clifford
 Esquire, who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the fifth year of King 
Edward
 the

fourth, and he had Issue 
Lewis Clifford
 Esq;, who was likewise Sheriff of 
Kent
 the thir∣teenth of 
Henry
 the seventh, and from this 
Lewis
 was 
Henry Clifford
 lineally descended who almost in our Fathers Remembrance passed away his Interest here to Sir 
Coniers Clifford,
 and the Lady 
Mary
 his Wife Widow of 
Southwell,
 whom he had made joynt purchaser with him in the Conveyance, after whose Decease she was remarried to Sir 
Anthony St. Leger
 of 
Ireland,
 by whom she had Issue Sir 
Anthony St. Leger
 now of 
Wierton
 House in 
Boughton Montchentsey,
 who by a Right derived from a Donation of his Mother divided the Mannor of 
Bobbing
 with his two half Brothers 
Henry
 and 
Coniers Clifford,
 all whom not many years since by mutuall and joynt Consent alienated the whole demise to Sir 
Edward
 Duke of 
Cosington,
 and he not long after passed away his Right in it by. Sale to Sir 
Richard Gurney
 of 
London,
 from whom the same Vicissitude and Conveyance hath now brought it to be the Patrimony of his Brother in Law Captain 
Henry Samford
 Esquire.


Borden
 in the Hundred of 
Milton
 hath nothing memorable in it but the Mannor of 
Criolls
 and 
Poyles,
 for they were alwaies united together, and were parcell of that spreading Demeasne which fell under the Signory of 
Bertram de Crioll,
 and he dyed possest of them in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the third, and left it to 
John Crioll
 his Son and Heir, who dying without Issue, 
Joan
 his Sister and Heir Generall brought this and much other Land to be possest by her Husband Sir 
Richard de Rokesley;
 but he likewise deceasing without Issue, the same fatal Vicissitude brought it by 
Joan
 sole Daughter and Heir to be the Patrimony of 
Thomas de Poynings,
 in which Family the Title flowed with an uninterrupted Current untill it devolved to Sir 
Edward Poynings,
 who dyed in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, without Issue lawfully begotten, and as it appears by the last Inquisition taken after his Decease in the fourteenth year of that Prince, without any respective Kindred that could legally entitle themselves to his Estate, so this Mannor escheated to the Crown, and was granted by the abovesaid Prince to Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 who lost it again upon his attain∣der in the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 but was restored again by Queen 
Elizabeth
 in the twenty fifth year of her Reign to his Son 
George Wiat
 Esquire only for life, for the Reversion thereof was by King 
James,
 by his Letters Patents bearing Date the fifteenth Day of 
June
 in the sixteenth year of his Reign, granted to 
Thomas Hooker
 and 
Jo. Spencer
 Gentlemen, who joyn after in a fine and settle it on the Heirs of Mr. 
George Wiat,
 in the second year of King 
Charles
 Sir 
Francis Wiat
 was found to be his Heir, who with his Ladies Consent, Dame 
Margaret Wiat
 did by good and sufficient Assurance in Law not many yeers since convey it to 
Isaac Seward
 Gentleman.


Sutton Barne
 is a little Mannor in this Parish remarkable only in this, that 
Roger de Savage
 Son of Sir 
John Savage,
 obtained a Charter of Free Warren to it in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the second; and continued with the Name untill the Heir Generall carried it away with 
Bobbing
 to 
Clifford,
 in which Family it remained untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was passed away to 
Platt,
 Ancestor to Mr....... 
Plat
 of 
Borden,
 who now enjoys the Inheritance of it.


Bonnington
 in the Hundred of 
Street
 did anciently appertain to the Knights 
Templars,
 and being found in the Register of their Demeasne at their total Sup∣pression, which was in the second year of 
Edward
 the second, it was in the seventeenth year of that Princes Rule by a new Provision made by Act of Parliament, setled on the Knights Hospitallers, or of St. 
Johns
 of 
Jerusalem,
 and so lay enwrapped in their Patrimony which was wide and spacious in this Track, untill the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then by the Suppression of this Order it was made parcell of the Royall Revenue, untill the abovesaid Prince in the thirty fifth year of his Govern∣ment granted it to Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 and he not long after conveyed it by Sale to Sir 
James Hales
 of the Dungeon neer 
Canterbury,
 from whom it devolved by successive Right to his Successor Sir 
James Hales,
 who almost in our Memory alienated his Interest in it to Sir 
William Man
 of 
Canterbury.


Singleton
 is another Mannor in 
Bonington,
 which was the Inheritance of a Family which anciently extracted its Sirname from the abovesaid Parish, and was called 
Bo∣nington,
 of which Family was 
Ni. de Bonington
 who paid respective Aid for this Mannor at

making the Black Prince Knight; after this Family was extinguished, which was about the Beginning of 
Richard
 the second, the 
Breslands,
 a Family who were Owners of a plentifull Estate in 
East Kent,
 were entituled by Purchase to the Possession of this Mannor, and continued in the Tenure of it untill about the latter end of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then it passed away (as appears by some ancient Court Rolls to 
Cobbe,
 whose Arms, 
viz. Argent
 a 
Cheveron
 between three 
Cocks Gules
 (if not assaulted by the bar∣rous rudenesle of these Times) stand in old coloured Class both in the Churches of 
Bonington
 and 
Limne.
 But to proceed, 
Singleton
 had for several Generations and Ages been folded up in that Demeasne which related to this Family, it was carried down by the Vicissitude of Time to 
Edward Cobbe
 Esquire, who about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth
 deceased without Issue male, and so both this Place and 
Cobbs
 place in 
Aldington,
 became the Inheritance of Sir 
John Norton
 of 
Northwood,
 by matching with 
Alice
 sole Daughter and Heit of the abovesaid 
Edward,
 and from him did it transmit it self by Descent to his Successor Sir 
Thomas Norton
 of 
Northwood,
 who dying without Issue male, 
Elizabeth
 his Female Inheritrix brought this to be parcell of that Estate which acknowledges the Signory of Sir 
James Hales
 now of the place or Court called the Dungeon neer 
Canterbury.


Brookland
 in the Hundred of 
Aloesbridge,
 anciently was wrapt up in the Patrimony of a noble Family called 
Passeley,
 whose Seat was at 
Thevegate
 in 
Smeth, Edmund de Passeley
 is the first whom in publick Record I discover to have been possest of it, as appears by an Inquisition taken after his Decease in the nineteenth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 57. but the aboad of this Family at this Place was no longer then untill the end of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then it was by 
John Passeley
 alienated to the Lord 
Cobham
 of 
Sterborough,
 and here was the Tenure and Title more transient and volatile then in the former Family, for 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cobham
 of 
Sterborough
 dyed in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the fourth, and left it to his sole Daughter and Heir, 
Ann
 matched to 
Edward Borough,
 afterwards in her Right Lord 
Borough
 of 
Sterborough,
 and Lord of this Mannor; and in this Family was it fixed, untill 
Thomas
 Lord 
Borough,
 Grandchild to the abovesaid 
Edward,
 about the middle of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 passed it away to 
Eversfield
 of 
Sussex,
 from whom by as quick a Transition it was alienated to 
Godfrey
 of 
Lidde,
 where after it had some small Time been setled, a Mutation like the former united it to the Propriety of 
Wood,
 and he about the Beginning of King 
James
 demised it by Sale to Mr. 
John Fagge,
 Grandfather to Mr. 
John Fagge
 Esquire, one of the Justices of the Peace for the County of 
Sussex,
 who is the instant Lord of the Fee.


Brook
 in the Hundred of 
Chart
 and 
Longbridge,
 was given to the Priory of 
Christ Church
 by 
Charlemanus
 a Priest, which Donation was first ratified by the Charter of 
Henry
 the first, and secondly confirmed by that of 
Henry
 the second: In the Conque∣rours time you will find it thus represented, 
Rodbertus de Romeney tenet
 1 
Manerium de Brock, ad firmam de Cibo Monachorum, & pro
 1 
Sulling defendebat se, & nunc pro Dimidio, & valet
 4 l. This upon the Surrender of the abovesaid Cloister, and its Revenue into the Hands of 
Henry
 the eighth, was enstated on the newly erected Dean and Chapter of 
Christ Church,
 and there was lodged untill this Age of Discomposure and Distraction, and now it is rent off.


Bromley
 gives Name to the whole Hundred where it is situated, and hath been many Ages part of the Demeasne of the Church, since it was given (as appears by the Records of the Church of 
Rochester
) by 
John Later
 a Goldsmith of 
London
 to the Bishop of that Sea in the year of our Lord 1300.


There are two Seats within this Parish which were alwaies of temporall Interest, and pretend to a deep Antiquity; The first is 
Sundridge,
 which formerly was the Patrimony of a noble Family called 
Blund, Peter le Blund
 was Constable of the Tower of 
London
 the thirty fourth of 
Henry
 the third, and 
Ralph le Blund
 his Grandchild paid respective Aid for his Lands at 
Bromley,
 which he there held by a whole Knights Fee of the Bishop of 
Rochester,
 in the twentieth of 
Edward
 the third; and when this Name was entombed in a Female Heir, this Seat went with

her to the 
Willoughbies,
 from whom the Earl of 
Lindsey
 is descended; and when some years it had rested in this Family, by the Circumstance of Purchase, it became the Patrimony of 
Booth;
 when this Name was likewise wound up in an Heir Generall, the 
Betenhams
 of 
Pluckley
 by matching with her, became Lords of this Manfion, and and continue still Proprietaries of it.


Simpsons
 is the second Seat of Account, though in Ages of a later Inscription it contracted that Name, yet anciently it was the Demeasne of 
Bankewell,
 a Family of Signall Repute in this Track, 
John de Bankewell
 had a Charter of Free Warren to his Lands in 
Bromley,
 in which this was involved in the thirty first of 
Edward
 the first, and 
Thomas de Bankewell
 dyed seised of it in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third, and when this Family was shrunk at this Place into a finall extinction; the next who were eminent in the Possession of it, were the 
Clarks,
 and one 
William Clark
 that flourished here in the Reign of 
Henry
 the fifth, that he might not be obnoxious to the Statute of Kernellation, obtained Licence to erect a strong little Pile of 
ime and Stone, with an embattell'd Wall encircled with a deep Moat, which is supplyed and nourished with a living Spring; but this mans posterity did not long enjoy it, for about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, 
John Simpson
 dwelt here by right of Purchase, and he having much improved the ancient Fabrick, setled his Name upon it, and indeed that is all that's left to Evidence they were once Owners of it, for in an Age or two after this, it was conveyed to Mr. 
John Stiles
 of 
Bekenham
 Esquire, from whom descends Sir 
Humphrey Stiles
 Knight and Baronet, Cupbearer to the late K. 
Charles,
 and him does 
Simpsons
 confesse for its instant Owner.


There is a Well in the Bishops Park, called St. 
Blases
 Well, which anciently had an Oratory annexed to it, dedicated to St. 
Blasius,
 which was much frequented at 
Whitsontide,
 because 
Lucas
 who was Legat for 
Sixtus
 the fourth here in 
England,
 granted an indulgent remission of forty Days injoyned Pennance, to all those who should visit this Chappell, and offer up their Orizons there, in the three Holy-days at 
Pentecost


Boughton Montchensey
 is placed in the Hundred of 
Twyford,
 and hath that Addition annexed to it, to signifie to us that it was once the Possession of the Family of 
Montchen∣sey
 whose principall Seat was at 
Swanscamp,
 where I shall treat more largely of them, but though originally they held this Place, yet it was not long a Branch of their Demeasne, for about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the third, they had deserted the Possession, and surrendred it up to 
Hougham
 of 
Hougham
 by 
Dover,
 and 
Robert de Hougham
 dyed possest of it in the forty first year of 
Henry
 the third, and had Issue 
Robert de Hougham,
 after whose Death the Spindle prevailed against the Spear, for he concluding in Daughters and Coheirs, 
Bennet
 one of them was matched to 
John de Shelving,
 and he by a Right derived from her, was invested in the Possession, and dyed seised of it in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, and so did his Widow in the twenty second year of that Prince, and with them the Name of 
Shelving
 expired in a Daughter and Heir called 
Helen,
 who was affianced to 
John de Bourn,
 and so he in her Right became entituled to the Signory of this Mannor; but before the end of 
Richard
 the second, this Family found likewise its Tomb in a Female Inheritrix, who was married to 
Haut
 of 
Hauts Place
 in 
Petham,
 and 
Edward Haut
 held this Mannor in the eighth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, as appears by the Pipe Roll relating to that Time; but after this it was not long united to their Inheritance, for about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, by an old Court Roll I find it in the Tenure of 
Reginald Peckham
 Esquire, and 
Katharine Peckham
 Widow of 
James Peckham
 his Son held it at her Death, which was in the seventh year of 
Henry
 the seventh, and after her, 
Thomas Peckham
 Esquire her Descendant enjoyed it at his Decease, which was in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and left it to his Son 
Reginald Peckham
 Esquire, who about the latter end of the above mentioned Prince passed it away to Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 and he not long after alienated it to 
Robert Rudston
 Esquire, who having been entangled in the unsuccesful Design of that Knight, forfeited it to the Crown, but was reinvested again in it by a new Concession in the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 and much improved the ancient Structure with the increase of Building, in the years 1567 and 1576, and left it to his Son and Heir 
Belknap Rudston
 Esquire, who by his

last Will and Testament setled it on his Kinsman Sir 
Francis Barnham
 in the year 1613, from whom it is now descended to that worthy person Mr. 
Robert Barnham
 Esquire his Son and Heir.


Wierton House
 is a second place to be considered of in this Parish, it borrows its Sirname from 
Adam de Wierton,
 who as appears by old Deeds which by the Antiquity of their Character seem to commence from the Reign of King 
Henry
 the third, was Possessor of this place, and having inocculated his own Name upon it, it sprouted out, not in loose Suckers and Excrescencies, but in those who were by lineal Descent from him justly and successively entituled to the Propriety of this Mannor; untill the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, and then it was by Sale transmitted to 
Robert Purse,
 and there is one of this Name; but whether this Man or his Son I am incertain who was Lord of 
Wierton House
 who lyes buryed in 
Boughton Church
 in the North Isle, with this Inscription on a Plate of Brasse affixed to the Wall, 
Hic jacet Robertus Purse qui obiit
 145▪ 
& bona multa huic contulit Ecclesiae;
 that is, he built the Belfrey and the North Isle, and those are the good Works registred in his Epitaph; and over his place of Sepulture, his Portraicture in painted Glass was preserved entire untill the eruption of the late intestine War, and then the tempestuous and ill managed, or rather overheated Zeal of these Times, which like an overheated Brain still concludes in Madnesse, disordered it into a Heap of Ruines; after this mans 
Exit,
 I do not find it acknowledged this Family long, for 
Robert Purse
 this mans Son, alienated it to 
Richard Norton,
 and his Wife 
Margaret Norton
 lyes enterr'd within that Seat which belongs to 
Wierton House,
 as the Date on her Tombstone instructs me, in the year 1470, and in this Family did the Title for many Generations inhabit untill that Age which fell under our Cognisance, and then it was demised by Sale to Sir 
Anthony St. Leger
 of 
Ireland,
 who still is the Proprietary of it.


Holbrook
 is the last Place to be taken Notice of in this Parish, it was anciently invol∣ved in the Demeasne of a Family which in ancient Deeds and Court Rolls were writ∣ten 
Halbroke,
 and bore, as is evident in old Registers and Armorials, 
Azure A plain Crosse
 between four 
Mullets Or, Frettee
 of the first, and having continued here many Descents, about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the fifth languished away, and then the Propriety of this place came to confesse the Signory of 
Haut
 of 
Hautsbourn,
 and dwelt in their Patrimony untill Sir 
William Haut
 determined about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth in two Female Coheirs, whereof 
Joan
 was matched to Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 and he in her Right was enstated in the Inheritance of this place, and about the latter end of 
Edward
 the sixth, the Contract being fortified with his Ladyes consent, passed it away to 
Smith,
 Ancestor to Mr. ....... 
Smith,
 who still possesses it as part of his Inheritance.


Boughton Alulph
 or 
Aluff
 in the Hundred of 
Wye,
 had this appellative Distinction united to its Name, to intimate to us, that in the 
Saxons
 Time it owned the Juris∣diction of one 
Alulphus
 a 
Saxon,
 into whose Name to derive his Memory down to us, it hath been ever since adopted; But in the Ages after the Conquest, it was wrapped up in the Estate of the ancient Family of 
Burgherst,
 now vulgarly called 
Burwash, Robert d
 Burgherst
 is the first who is brought on the Stage by publick Record and presented to our Remembrance, and he held it at his Death, which was in the thirty third year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 41. and is amongst the Register of those who accompanied that Triumphant and Succesfull Prince in his fotunate Expedition against the 
Scots,
 and he left it to his Son 
Stephen de Burgherst,
 who in the second year of 
Edward
 the second obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of 
Boughton Aluff,
 and in the third year of that Prince, paid his Debt to Nature; from whom it descended to his Son 
Stephen de Burwash
 who had a Renovation of the former Charter of Free-warren confirmed to this Mannor in the first year of 
Ed.
 the third, his Son and Heirwas 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Burgherst,
 who had a Charter of Free∣warren confirmed to all his Lands, in which this was involved in the twelfth and sixteenth years of 
Edward
 the third, and was certainly a Person of much Eminence in those Times, for he is recorded by 
Daniell
 in his Chronicle to have been one of those, to whom the abovesaid Prince committed the Conduct of his Army at the Battle of 
Crescy,
 and was summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron, as appears amongst

the Summons of that Age, he deceased in the twenty eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, his Heir apparent was 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Burgherst,
 who was Lord Chamberlain of the Kings Household, and was frequently summoned to sit as a Peere of the Realm by 
Edw.
 the third, as it appears Registered in the late printed Abridgement of the Records of the 
Tower;
 and he in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third passed away this Mannor and much other Land to 
Walter de Pavely;
 in 
Paveley
 the Possession was re∣sident but untill the Beginning of 
Richard
 the second, and then it was conveyed to 
Trivet;
 but here it was of no long fixed continuance neither, for Sir 
Thomas Trivet
 about the fifteenth year of the abovesaid Prince passed it away to 
Lewis Clifford,
 from whom it descended to his Successor, 
Lewis Clifford
 Esquire, who in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, by a Fine then levied, transplanted his right in it into 
William Wenlock,
 and he not long after transmitted it by Sale to 
Richard Beauchampe
 Baron of 
Aburgavenny,
 whose Son 
Richard
 Baron 
Aburgavenny
 concluded in 
Elizabeth Beauchampe
 his Sole Heir, who was matched to 
Edward Nevil
 in her Right Lord of this Mannor, whose Descendants constantly remained invested in the Inheritance untill the latter End of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was alienated to Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 and he dying without Issue Male, 
Katharine
 his Daughter and Coheir fastned it to the Demeasn of her Husband Sir 
Thomas Finch,
 where it hath ever since remained so constant, and per∣manent, that it now confesses the Signory of the right honourable 
Heneage Finch
 the instant Earl of 
Winchelsey.


Seaton, Ulley,
 and 
Potbery,
 are three little Mannors lying within the Verge of this Pa∣rish, the first of which held in grand Serjeantie of the Crown, with this respective Ser∣vice to be performed by the Lord of the Fee, 
Esse vantrarius Regius quando Rex iverit in Vasconiam, donec per usus fuerit pari Solutarum pretio
 4 d. which wiser Heads, who pretend to unravell the Intrigues and Criticisms of Law Latin interpret thus, to be the Kings fore Footman, when he shall go into 
Gasconie,
 untill he hath worn out a pair of Shoes, which cost 4 d. All these Mannors were wrapped up in the Demeasn of 
Crioll,
 and 
Bertram de Crioll
 died seised of them in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first, whose onely Daughter 
Joan
 being matched to 
Richard de Rokesley,
 called in some old Records Sir 
Richard,
 upon the Death of her Brother 
John de Crioll
 without Issue, entituled her Husband to that large Patrimony which called her Father Proprietary; but he dying without Issue Male, 
Joan
 his Sole Heir wedded to 
Thomas de Poynings,
 knit together the Demeasn of 
Crioll
 and 
Rokesley,
 and cast it into his Possession; and here it made its abode untill the eleventh year of 
Richard
 the second, and then the Title of these Mannors came by 
Eleanor
 the general Inheritrix of 
Poynings,
 to submit to the Dominion of 
Henry
 Earl of 
Northumberland,
 and his Successor 
Henry
 Earl of the same place alienated them in the twenty third of 
Henry
 the eighth to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney, William Walsingham,
 and 
William Fitz Williams,
 and they conveyed them to Sir 
Christopher Hales,
 and his Son Sir 
James
 sold them to Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 by whose Coheir they devolved to Sir 
Thomas Finch.


Buckwell
 in 
Boughton Alulph,
 was the Seat of a Family called 
Bekewell,
 as appears by an Inquisition taken after the Death of 
Henry de Bekewell,
 in the tenth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 72. by which he is found to have been then possest of it, and so was his Successor 
Henry Bekewell
 by a subsequent Inquisition taken in the seventeenth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 97. After this Family was worn out, the Possession of this Place was united to the Inheritance of 
Wode,
 and here it remained fastned untill the thirty fourth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then 
Robert Wode
 passed it away by Sale to Mr. 
Walter Moile,
 Father to 
John Moile
 Esq; who was Justice of the Peace for this County, in the Reign of 
Edward
 the fourth, and 
Henry
 the seventh; and from whom Mr. 
Robert Moile
 is lineally branched out, who now enjoys this Mansion: And so much for the Seat it self. The Mannor which is now entwined with it, was for the principal part of it, the Inheritance of 
Burg∣herst
 or 
Burwash. Robert de Burgherst
 possest it at his Death, which was in the thirty third year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 41. From whom it devolved to his Successor 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Burgherst
 Knight of the Garter, who in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third, by a Deed of Feoffment, invests it in Sir 
Walter de Paveley
 Knight likewise of the Garter; from 
Pavely
 it came over by Purchase to be the Possession of Sir 
Robert Belknap
 one of the Judges under 
Richard
 the second, who

having disgusted the Duke of 
Glocester
 that Kings Uncle, and others of the Nobility, who were knit into a 
Junto,
 for Protection of the Peoples Liberties, against the Inroades of the Regal Prerogative, which peradventure that infortunate Person had endevoured to extend beyond its just Confines, was empeached of High Treason, convicted and banished into 
Ireland,
 in the tenth year of the above mentioned Prince, and his Estate for the most part confiscated, amongst which was his Land at 
Buckwell,
 which King 
Richard
 the second, in the twelfth year of his Rule, granted to the Dean and Canons of St. 
Stephens
 in 
Westminster,
 and I find one 
Semana de Tong
 to have held it in Lease of that Chapiter at her Death, which was in the second year of 
Henry
 the fifth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 29. and so did 
Kimberly
 afterwards in the third year of 
Henry
 the sixth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 33. After this Family was disseised, I find the 
Moiles
 to have held it as Lessees to that Covent, untill the general Dissolution in the Reign of King 
Henry
 the eighth, and then that Prince granted the Fee-Simple to 
John Moile
 Esquire, Son of 
Robert Moile
 Esquire, who as the Records of this Family restifie, was Justice of the Peace of this County, and one of the Esquires of the Body to that Prince, and from this 
John Moile
 is the Title by Hereditary Succession streamed into Mr. 
Ro∣bert Moile,
 who is the instant Lord of the Fee.


Barton
 is another Mannor, which partly is situated in 
Wye,
 and partly in 
Boughton A∣lulf,
 and had Owners of that Sirname, who were invested in the Possession until the twenty eighth year of 
Henry
 the sixth; and then it was conveyed to Cardinal 
Kempe,
 who setled it on his newly instituted Colledge of 
Wye,
 in whose Revenue it lay folded up, untill upon the suppression it was surrendred into the Hands of 
Henry
 the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his Government, and was not long after conveyed by Grant to Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 and he passed it away to his Brother Mr. 
Walter Moile,
 from whom it is now descended to his Successor, Mr. 
Robert Moile
 the Heir apparent of it.


Bocton
 under 
Bleane
 gives Name to the whole Hundred, wherein it is placed. It was one of those Mannors which anciently belonged to the Arch-Bishop of 
Canter∣bury;
 but by whom it was given, because the Records of 
Christ Church
 in that par∣ticular are silent, I must, if you will look for its appraisment in the Time of the Con∣querour, 
Doomsday
 Book will inform you. 
Bocton,
 (says that Record)

Boughton
 or 
Bocton Court,
 is the first place of secular Interest which claims our Notice; it formerly (though now shrunk into a Mansion of mean Concernment) did contribute both Seat and Sirname to a Family so called, and one 
John de Bocton,
 as I discover by Deeds held it in the Reign of 
Edw.
 the second, and 
Edward
 the third: In times more modern it is in Sir 
Jo. Rowths
 Evidences called 
Swayford,
 from the 
Swayfords
 who were next Possessors of the Fee; those who succeeded the Inheritance were the 
Bingers,
 now called 
Bengers,
 from whom the 
Bengers
 of 
Hougham
 by 
Dover,
 are issued out, and after this Name had flourished here from the entrance into the Go∣vernment of 
Henry
 the fifth, till towards the Reign of 
Henry
 the seventh it expired, and then the 
Hales
 were the successive Proprietaries, from whom by Sale the Right was wafted over to 
Wood,
 and from this Name did a Fatality resembling the former bring it down to 
Rowth,
 in Relation to whom Sir 
John Rowth
 is now entituled to the Fee-Simple of it.


Brinley
 in this Patish does celebrate the Memory of Sir 
Laurence de Brinley,
 who flourished here about the Reign of 
Edward
 the first; and in this Family was it for a Series of some Descents resident, till one of them sold it to 
John Roper
 a younger Branch of the 
Ropers
 of St. 
Dunstans,
 in whose Posterity after the Title had been sometime planted, it was by a Daughter and Heir made the Inheritance of 
Aires;
 and when this Family after some abode here determined in a Daughter and Heir, the same Female Right threw it into the Revenue of the 
Rowths
 descended from the 
Rowths
 of 
Darbyshire,
 from which Alliance Sir 
John Rowth
 claims at this instant the Possession.




Nash Court
 is a Seat of very reverend Antiquity, especially since for some Cen∣turies of years it hath been (as is apparent by their own private Evidences) the Mansion of the 
Hawkins,
 a Family of deep Descent, and illustrious Account in this Track, but made more eminent by being the Cradle of that Learned Gentle∣man Sir 
Thomas Hawkins,
 who for his accurate Translation of 
Caussinus
 his holy Court from the 
French
 Original into 
English,
 and his other well polished Labours, cannot be decyphered or limned out to Posterity under too worthy an Attribute.


Colkins
 is the last place, though not of the least Account, which in this Parish is to be considered; it was built by 
John Colkin
 originally a Citizen of 
Canterbury,
 and he at his Death, which was in the tenth of 
Edward
 the third, was in possession of it; there are several of this Mans Posterity which lye entombed in 
Boughton
 with a 
Griffin Segreant,
 which was their Paternal Coat, affixed to the Front of the Gravestone, 
William Colkin
 and 
Agnes
 his Wife, are there enterr'd with this Inscription, 
Orate pro animâ Will. Colkin & Agnet. Ux. qui quidem obierunt, Anno Dom.
 1460. and the rest is defaced; this Mans Father 
John Colkin
 sleeps there with this Inscription annexed, to the Marble, 
Hic jacet Johannes Colkin qui obiito ctavo Die Aprilis, Anno Dom.
 1405. But not long after the Decease of 
William Colkin
 abovesaid, did the Possession of this Seat continue permanent in this Family, for his Son 
John Colkin
 sold it to 
Henry Petit
 Father to 
Cirjacus
 or 
Sidrach Petit,
 who drew up a Survey of all the Mannors of 
Kent,
 which held by Knights Service of the Crown, in the twenty eigth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, from whom Mr. 
Petit
 the present Lord of 
Colkins
 does extract both his Descent and Title.


Dane Court
 in this Parish also cannot be passed by without some Inspection: In elder Times Sir 
Allan de Dane
 challenged the Signorie of it, and as he took his Sirname from it, so he had his Habitation here, in the Reign of 
Edward
 the third, and it continued a Mansion for his Descendants divers years after; but in the Reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, I find the 
Foggs
 Lords of the Fee, the last of which that held it was Sir 
Jo. Fogge,
 who died possest of it, as appears by his Will, in the seventeenth year of 
Henry
 the seventh, and left it to his Son and Heir Sir 
Jo. Fogge,
 from which Family not many years after it came to own the Propriety of 
Petit
 of 
Colkins,
 in the Descendant of which Family the Interest of it is yet resident.


Tho. At Hurst
 here founded a Chappel in the eighth of 
Richard
 the second, and dedicated it to Saint 
Nicholas,
 which was for the use of 
Lazars
 and poor Leprous people, lodged in an Hospital not far distant of this Mans Foundation also.


Bourdfield
 or 
Boresfield
 in the Hundred of 
Eyhorn
 was formerly a Parish, and the remains of some part of the Stonework of the Church, as likewise the Bounds of the Church-yard are yet obvious, but since its decay it hath been incorporated into 
Oltringden,
 and is now looked upon as an Hamblet of that Parish. It was for many De∣scents the Patrimony of the Lords 
Cobham
 of 
Sterborough,
 and so continued untill 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cobham
 died in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the fourth, and left one onely Daughter and Heir called 
Ann Cobham,
 who was matched with 
Edward Borough
 after in her Right as Heir General created Lord 
Borough
 of 
Sterborough,
 from whom this Mannor descended to his Grandchild 
Thomas
 Lord 
Borough,
 who in the twenty fifth year of Q. 
Elizabeth
 conveyed it to 
John Pakenham,
 and he not long after alie∣nated it to 
John Lewin
 Esquire, in which Family it remained untill our Remembrance, and then by the Heir General it was carried off to 
Rogers
 of the County of 
Somerset,
 and the like vicissitude hath by the Female Inheritrix of that Family brought it now to acknowledge 
Charles Cavendish
 Viscount 
Mansfield
 Heir apparent to 
William
 created Marquess 
Newcastle
 by the late King at 
Oxford.


Bishops-Bourn
 in the Hundred of 
Bredge
 and 
Petham,
 is called so because it was gi∣ven by K. 
Kenulfus
 at the Request of 
Athelard
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury
 to the Priory of 
Christ Church,
 in the year of 
Grace
 789, and in the Charter there is a Re∣cital of one 
Aldhun
 a pious Citizen of 
Canterbury,
 who first bequeathed it to that Covent, and the Charter of Confirmation informs us that it was given to the 
Monks, ad Vestimentum corum,
 for a supply of Vesture. In the year 811. Arch-Bishop 
Ul∣fred
 exchanged 
Eastry
 of 
Bourn,
 with the Covent above mentioned, and in the De∣measne

of that See it lay couched untill the latter end of 
Hen.
 the eighth, and then 
Tho.
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury
 exchanged it for other Lands with Sir 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bedgebury,
 who in the thirty fourth year of the abovesaid Prince conveyed it to Sir 
Anthony Aucher
 Ancestor to Sir 
Anthony Aucher
 Knight and Baronet, the instant Pro∣prietary both of this and 
Hautsbourn,
 which next summons a Remembrance.


Hauts-bourn
 before it was enlarged with the Additional Appellation of 
Haut;
 afforded both Seat and Sirname in elder Times to a Family of venerable Antiquity in these Parts; 
John de Bourn
 lived here, and had a Charter, of Free-warren granted to it in the seventeenth year of 
Ed.
 the first; but when this Name resolved into a Daughter and Heir, who was married to 
Shelving,
 this Mannor lost the Name of 
Bourn,
 and was called by Addition 
Shelving Bourn,
 and remained sometime under that Notion, untill a Vicissitude of the same Nature with the former, entombed this in a Female Inheritrix likewise, who being married to 
Edw. Haut,
 the first Addition was removed, and wrapped up in a second, for thenceforth in publick Records it was frequently stiled 
Hauts-bourn,
 and so continued under that Name and in that Family, untill Sir 
William Eaut
 about the latter end of 
Hen.
 the eighth, dying without Issue Male, this Family determined in two Daughters and Coheirs, one of whom called 
Elizab.
 being matched to Sir 
Thowas Cole∣peper
 of 
Bedgebury,
 brought 
Bourn
 to be the Inheritance of that Family, and he in the thirty fourth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, passed it away to Sir 
Anthony Aucher,
 descen∣ded from 
Aucherus
 the 
Saxon,
 who was of eminent Note at 
Newenden
 in this Coun∣ty, of whom more shall be spoken when I come to treat of that place.


Bursted
 is the last Place to be taken Notice of in this Parish, which in ancient Deeds is written 
Burghsted,
 and was the Inheritance of a Family of that Sirname, but the cheifest Honour which it acquired in times of a more modern Aspect, is, that for several Descents last past it hath constantly confessed it self to be part of the pro∣priety and Patrimony of 
Denne,
 a Cadet of the 
Denns
 of 
Denne Hill.


Boxley
 in the Hundred of 
Maidston,
 had an Abby filled with Cistertian Monks, and founded by 
William de Iper
 of 
Flanders,
 advanced by King 
Stephen
 to be Earl of 
Kent
 in the year 1145; K. 
Richard
 the first, as the Register of this Abby denotes, was a great Bene∣factor to the Covent, who were originally transported hither from 
Clarevall
 in 
Burgun∣dy;
 upon the Suppression, the House with the Demeasne adjacent was in the thirty second of 
Henry
 the eighth, granted to Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 Father to Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 one of his Privy Counsel, a man of an unbroken though a calamitous Virtue, who thinking it a lesse stain to forfeit his Estate, then to debauch his Consience, stuck close to that Sacramental Covenant, by which he and the rest of the Councel had oblieged themselves to 
Henry
 the eighth, to preserve as much as in them lay his two Daughters 
Mary
 and 
Elizabeth
 from confederating with any forreign Alliance, and so engaged in that Design which over set him, and sunk him and his Patrimony into that Ruine; we find him and it lost at present, for upon his Attainder, Queen 
Mary
 in the second year of her Reign, granted out his Estate as if it were by Retail to several sons, but this Mannor and some other small peices were given back to the Lady 
Joan Wiat
 his Widow, for the support of her self and Family; and this is all which of that vast and wide Revenue of his, which lay scattered in this and other Counties is held by his Posterity at this Day.


Wevering
 in this Parish is a Mannor held by Knights Service, and 
Waretius de Shel∣ving
 Son of 
John Shelving,
 and 
Hellen de Bourn
 Daughter and Heir of 
John de Bourn
 held it by this Tenure, to find a Horse for the Kings Army in 
Wales; Cum uno Sacco & Brochiâ pro Esquilar ipsius Domini Regis,
 so it runs in the Latin Record taken in the third year of 
Edward
 the third; after this mans Decease, 
John de Shelving
 was this mans Heir, and in his Right enjoyed this Mannor, though it was not wholly his till he married 
Benedicta
 Daughter and Coheir of 
Robert de Hougham,
 who likewise held some part of it, and then he transmitted it entire to his Son 
William Shelving,
 whose Sole Daughter and Heir being married to 
Edward Haut
 of 
Hauts Place
 in 
Petham,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the eighth of 
Henry
 the fourth, this and an opulent Demeasne beside became interwoven with the Revenue of that Family; and here the Possession seemed to be laid up till Sir 
William Haut
 of 
Hautsbourn,
 this mans great Grandchild dyed and left only two Coheirs, 
Joan
 matched to Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 and 
Elizabeth


married to Sir 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bedgebury,
 so wavering by this Alliance accrued to Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 from whom in the twenty fourth year of Queen 
Mary
 it was by forfeiture torne away, but was in the twenty fourth year of Queen 
Elizabeth
 restored with the Mannor of 
Boxley
 to the Lady 
Joan Wiat,
 Widow of the abovesaid Sir 
Thomas,
 and her Son 
George Wiat
 for three Lifes; the Reversion was sold by King 
Charles
 to Mr. 
Stephen Alcock
 who alienated the Fee Simple to Sir 
Francis Wiat.


Vinters
 is contained also in 
Boxley,
 it gave Seat and Sirname to as noble a Family and of as deep Antiquity as any in this Track; 
Roger Vinter
 lived here, who was one of the Conservators of the Peace for the County of 
Kent
 in the eighteenth year of the Reign of 
Edward
 the third, he deceased in the forty seventh of the abovesaid Princes Government, and 
John Vinter
 was his Heir, who sold 
Vinter,
 to 
Fremingham
 in the tenth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, from whom it was conveyed by a Female Inheritrix to 
Isley
 of 
Sundrich,
 and here it rested till Sir 
Henry Isley
 being folded up in the same attempt with Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 upon the blasting of that Designe forfeited his Interest in it to the Crown; Queen 
Mary
 granted it to 
Cutts,
 who some years after devested himself of his right in it, and by Sale disposed of it to Sir 
Cavaliero Maycott,
 who suddenly alienated it to 
Covert,
 who transferred it by the like Devo∣lution, about some five and twenty years since to Sir 
John Tufton
 Knight Baro∣net, whose second Son Sir 
Charles Tufton,
 upon the late Decease of his Brother Sir 
Benedict Tufton
 is the present Lord of the Fee.


I had almost forgot to mention, which certainly must much improve the Honour of this Place, that King 
Edward
 the second in the fifteenth year of his Reign lying at 
Boxley
 Abby granted the Charter to 
London,
 to elect yearly one of the City at their own pleasure to be their Maior.


Boughton Malherbe
 in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne,
 did very probably take its Deno∣mination from a Family of that Sirname, who were of eminent Account in the County of 
Devon;
 for I find Sir 
William de Malherbe
 was witnesse to a Deed of 
Reginald de Mohun,
 by which he gives much Land to the Abby of 
Axminster,
 as appears 
Pat.
 14. 
Hen. tertii Memb.

parte prima.
 In the Reign of 
Henry
 the third, by several old Deeds I discover it to be marshalled in the List of those Lands which confessed 
Robert de Gatton
 Son of 
Robert de Gatton,
 (who was one of the 
Recognitores magnae Assisae
 in the second year of King 
John
) to have been its Proprietarie, and he dyed possest of it in the forty eighth year of 
Henry
 the third, and left it to his Son 
Hamo de Gatton,
 in whom the male Line determined; so that this Mannor upon the Partition of his Inheritance, devolved by 
Elizabeth
 his Daughter and Coheir to be the Patrimony of 
William de Dene,
 who obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands here, in the renth year of 
Edward
 the second; but he not long after enjoyed the Benefit of this priviledge, for he conveyed it to 
Robert Corbie,
 who in the thirty sixth year of 
Edward
 the third had Licence by this Princes Grant to build after a fortified Mannor, the Terms are 
Kernellare & Turrellare,
 that is, to make Cranies and Loopholes to discharge Crossebows and other missile Weapons, and to embattel with Towers and Curtain Walls the Mannor House at 
Boughton;
 from him it descen∣ded to 
Robert Corby
 his Son and Heir, who dyed and left only one Daughter and Heir 
Joan
 marryed to Sir 
Nicholas Wotton
 twice Lord Maior of 
London;
 and so by Female Right this Mannor became the Possession of this Family, and in a continued Series was it carryed down from Sir 
Nicholas,
 to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Wotton
 not many years since deceased, whose Lady Dowager 
Mary
 Daughter and one of the Coheirs of Sir 
Arthur Throgmorton
 of 
Paulers Perry
 in the County of 
North-Hampton,
 as parcel of her Joynture, did lately before her Decease enjoy it.


Colbridge
 Castle lay in 
Boughton Malherbe,
 under the Hill towards 
Headcorne,
 and hath found a Sepulcher now under its own Rubbish; King 
Henry
 the third in the forty third of his Reign granted Licence by his Charter to Sir 
Fulke Peyforer,
 to fortifie and build after a Castle-like Manno this Mansion House at 
Colbrge;
 it came after to be the Possession of 
Roger
 Lord 
Leybourne,
 and from him did descend to 
Juliana Leybourne,
 his Sole Heir, who matching with 
William Clinton
 Earl of 
Hunting∣ton
 made it his Inheritance; but he deceasing in the twenty eighth of 
Edward
 the third without Issue, and his Lady after dying and leaving no visibleor avowed Alli¦ance,

knit to her by the indisputable tye of Consanguinity to claim it, it escheated to the Crown, and K. 
Richard
 the second in the twenty first of his Reign granted it to the Royal Chappel of St. 
Stevens
 in 
Westminster,
 where it remained till the Dissolution, and then it was granted in the second year of 
Edward
 the sixth to Sir 
Edward Wotton,
 from whom by a successive Right of Descent it was transmitted to his great Grandchild 
Thomas
 Lord 
Wotton
 of 
Marley,
 whose Widow the Lady 
Mary Wotton
 does at this instant possess it.


Lastly, 
Chilston
 is an eminent Seat and Mannor likewise situated within the Precincts of this Parish: In the fifty fifth year of 
Henry
 the third, 
Henry Hussey
 had a Charter of Free-Warren to his Mannor of 
Chilston,
 and his Grandchild 
Henry Hussey
 died seised of it in the sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, and in this Family was the Inhe∣ritance in an undivided Succession resident till our Grandfathers Memory, and then 
Henry Hussey
 by Sale translated the Proprietie into 
John Parkhurst,
 whose Successor Sir 
William Parkhurst
 alienated it to 
Richard Northwood,
 whose Son Mr. 
Oliver North∣wood
 by the same transmission passed it over to 
Cieggat;
 he very lately disposed of his Concernment in it to Mr. 
Manly
 of 
London,
 who very lately hath conveyed it to Mr. 
Edward Hales,
 Grandchild to Sir 
Edward Hales
 of 
Tunstal
 Knight and Baronet.


Buckland
 in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 was (as 
Sidrach Petits
 Inquest into the Man∣nors of 
Kent
 informs me) as high as the Reign of 
Henry
 the third, the Possession of 
John de Buckland,
 who it seems extracted his Sirname from hence, and is likewise mentioned in 
Testa de Nevil
 to have held Land in this Track in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third: But before the end of 
Edward
 the second, this Family was vanished from this place, and immediately after they were gone out, the 
Frogenhalls
 of 
Fro∣genhall
 in 
Tenham,
 were entituled to the Possession, and 
Richard Frogenhall
 was seised of it at his Decease, which was in the thirty fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 37. and from him did it descend to 
John Frogenhall
 Esquire, who was with 
Edmund Brook
 Lord 
Cobham,
 then Ceneral of the 
Kentish
 Forces under 
Richard
 Earl of 
Warwick,
 at the Battle of 
North-Hampton,
 where the House of 
Lancaster
 by that vigorous Assistance the 
Kentish
 men that day afforded the House of 
York,
 received so fatal a Wound, that all the Art of the 
Lancastian
 Partisans, could hardly ever after close it; and this Man had Issue 
Thomas Frogenhall,
 who about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, passed it away to 
Gedding;
 and 
Thomas Gedding,
 in the twenty fifth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, held this Mannor, and conveyed it by Deed to 
Henry Atsea
 of 
Herne;
 and he in the thirtieth of 
Henry
 the eighth was possest of it at his Death, and from him did the Thread of Descent guide the Title down to his Grandchild 
William Atsea,
 who in the tenth year of King 
James
 conveyed it by Sale to ....... 
Saker
 of 
Feversham
 Gentleman, whose Son Mr. 
Christopher Saker
 in our Fathers Memory alienated it to Sir 
Basill Dixwell
 of 
Terlingham
 in 
Folkstone
 Knight and Baronet, who upon his Decease about the year 1641, gave it to his Kinsman Mr. 
John Dixwell
 Esquire, in whom the Possession is still resident.


Buckland
 by 
Dover
 is situated in the Hundred of 
Bewsborough,
 and was a Branch of that spacious and wide Demeasn which made the Patrimony of 
Hamon de Crevequer
 so considerable in this County, and he held it at his Decease, which was in the forty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 33. Afterwards I find the 
Wilghebies
 or 
Willoughbies
 invested in the Possession, and 
Thomas de Willoughbie
 was seised of it at his Decease, which was in the seventh year of 
Edward
 the second: But the Title had no long residence in this Family, for in the Reign of 
Edward
 the third, I find it in the Tenure of 
Barrie
 of 
Sevington;
 for 
Agnes
 Wife of 
William Barrie
 was possest of it in Right of Dower, as appears by an Inquisition taken after her Death in the forty eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 7. After the 
Barries
 were worn out, the 
Callards
 or 
Calwards,
 now vulgarly called 
Collard,
 became Lords of the Fee, a Family of deep Extraction in this Track, and who were in elder Times entituled to the Possession of Land and Houses in 
Canterbury,
 as appears by a Composition made between the 
Monks
 of St. 
Austins
 and those of 
Christ Church,
 in the forty first of 
Edward
 the third, recited by Mr. 
Somner
 in his Survey of that City, Pag. 192. wherein it is mentioned that the Abby of St. 
Austins
 had purchased Land and Houses of 
Iohn

Calward.
 But to proceed, after this Family had for divers Descents held this Man∣nor in a fair repute, (
John Callard
 Esquire, being one of those who accompanied Sir 
Henry Guldford
 of this County to serve 
Ferdinand
 of 
Castile
 in his War commenced against the 
Moors,
 where for some Signal Service performed against those Infidels, he had this Coat assigned to him and his Posterity, by 
Clarenceux Benolt, vid. Girony
 of six pieces 
Or & Sables
 over all three 
Blackmores Heads decouped
) in our Fathers Memory they surrendred the Possession of this place by Sale to 
Fogge,
 who not many years after passed away his Concernment in it, by the same conveyance to Mr. 
William Sherman
 of 
Croyden
 Esquire, Steward both to 
George Abbot
 and 
William Laud
 Successively Arch-Bishops of 
Canterbury.


Dudmanscombe
 is another Mannor in this Parish, which in elder times made up the Revenue of the Priorie of St. 
Martins
 in 
Dover,
 and continued annexed to that Cloister until the general Suppression, and then being torn from the Church, it was again exchanged with 
Thomas Cranmer
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury
 by 
Henry
 the eighth, in the twenty ninth of his Reign, and so remained wound up in the Demeasn of that Sea, untill that ruinous and fatal popular Tempest which arose in these Times supplanted it, and cast it into the Possession of a secular Interest.


Burham
 in the Hundred of 
Lark field
 is in 
Doomsday
 Book written 
Burgham,
 and was in the twentieth year of 
William
 the Conquerour held by 
Ralph de Curva Spina.
 In Ages of a lower Approach to us, I find it under the Signorie of 
Jeffrey de Say,
 and he died possest of it in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first. 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 48. and for the future remained so chained to the Propriety of this Family, that it was esteemed Parcel of their Barony of 
Birling,
 and when 
Jeffrey
 Lord 
Say
 in the Reign of 
Richard
 the second ended in two Female Coheirs, one matched to 
John
 Lord 
Clinton,
 and the other called 
Joan,
 wedded to Sir 
William Fiennes,
 this upon the Division of the Estate accrued to 
Fiennes,
 and coming again by the Heir General of 
Fiennes
 Lord 
Dacres
 to be possest by 
Leonard, William Leonard
 Son and Heir of 
Fiennes Leonard,
 a younger Branch of that House, hath lately passed it away to Mr. 
Francis Barnham,
 and Mr. 
Edward Maplesden.


There was in old Time a Fountain within the Limits of this Parish at a place called 
Haly-Garden,
 venerable it was, and of no small Account amonst the People, who for the sanctitie they conceived was in it, ascribed divine Attributes unto it, as the Name imports for what we call Holy, our Ancestors long time since styled 
Halyg,
 as 
Halyfax
 in 
York-shire,
 from 
holy Haire,
 that that the People devoutly esteemed, and frequently with blind credulity visited. In the seventeenth of K. 
Richard
 the second, the Friars 
Carmelites
 of 
Alresford
 obtained a Grant by Letters Patents to bring the Water from that Fountain in 
Haly-Garden
 to their Monastery in 
Alres∣ford,
 to what purpose, they that will survey the Designs of the 
Monks
 of those Times, may easily discover.


Burmersh
 in the Hundred of 
Worth
 was a Member of that Patrimony, which in Times of a higher Calculation, related to the Abby of St. 
Augustines
 in 
Canterbury:
 and had here a Mansion called 
Abbots Court,
 which is an Adjunct to this Mannor, and had this Denomination imposed upon it, because the Abbot of that Covent used to sojourn here when he came to survey that Demeasn, which augmented the Revenue of that Abby, and lay spread into 
Romney Mersh.
 This Mannor upon the Surrender of the Patrimony of that Cloister into the Hands of 
Henry
 the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his Reign, was in the thirty fifth of that Prince granted to 
William Finch
 Esquire, whose Successor Sir 
Thomas Finch
 Earl of 
Winchelsey
 not many years since passed it away to Sir 
Ralph Whitfield
 Serjeant at Law, whose Son and Heir Sir 
Herbert Whitfield
 is now Lord of the Fee.

CAnterbury
 hath so exactly in all the Parts and Limbs of it been described and surveyed by Mr. 
Somner,
 that I should exceedingly eclipse the Labours of so inductrious a Pen, if I should go about to Pourtray that in any contracted Land∣skip, which hath been before represented to the Publick, pencilled out in so large and exquisite a Volume: Onely some few things are there omitted, which in this Search I shall take notice of, and so proceed.

The Mannor of 
Dodindale
 had originally owners of that Name, for as Mr. 
Somner
 in his Survey of 
Canterbury
 out of the Records of St. 
Augustins
 instructs us, 
Haymo
 the Son of 
Guido de Dodindale,
 gave the Tithes of 
Dodindale
 to the Priory of St. 
Augustins:
 But it seems it was but for certain years, for in the Reign of 
Henry
 the second (as the same Records testifie) 
Robert de Marci
 gave the Tithes of this place, to the Hospital of St. 
Laurence;
 so far he in that laborious Peice of his hath exhibit∣ed to the publick view who were its ancient Possessors when it bore the Name of 
Dodindale;
 now out of the private Evidences it must be my Task who were its Propri∣etaries since it carried the Name of 
Morton;
 By a Deed without date 
Elias de Morton
 (from whom it assumed the Name of 
Morton,
 which hath clove to it ever since) de∣mises the Fee-simple of it to 
Hugh Fitzvinon,
 a Family which had large possessions at 
Selling
 by 
Monks Horton,
 whose Daughter 
Eugenia Fitzvinon
 passes it away by Deed to 
Nicholas de Twitham
 in the twentyeth year of 
Henry
 the third, and he immediately after by a Deed not bounded with any date, settles it in 
Robert de Polre;
 but whether his Successor sold it to 
J. Chich
 or not, is incertain, because there is a vacancy or gap in in the private Evidences, though the Records of St. 
Augustins
 make him to have some Interest in it in the year 1330. The next that I find to have been entituled to the pos∣session were 
Hardres
 and 
Isaack;
 who in the twenty second year of 
Henry
 the sixth conveyed it away to 
William Say
 for the use of 
Robert Rigdon,
 but it seems the title

did not long fix here, for he in the thirty third year of the abovesaid Prince, transmits all his concernment in it by sale to 
William Barton
 and 
John Whete,
 and they by mutual consent in the eighteenth year of 
Edward
 the fourth alienate it to 
Edward Pargate,
 who transmitted it to his Son and Heir 
John Pargate,
 from whom descended 
Edward Pargate
 who in the twenty fifth year of 
Henry
 the eighth demises it to 
Peter Bruin;
 and after the Title had many years united to this Family, 
Henry Bruin
 dying without Issue gave it to his Sister 
Jane Bugge
 who in the first year of King 
James
 cast her Right by Sale into her Kinsman 
John Bruin,
 who in the fifth year of that Prince by the same alienation translated the Title into 
William Denne,
 who deceasing without Issue Male, 
Margaret
 his only Daughter and Heir brought it over to her husband 
Edw. Hougham,
 after whose death it is to devolve to two Daughters who are the surviving Issue of that Wife, namely 
Elizabeth
 matched to Mr. 
Edward Rose
 of 
Chistlet,
 and 
Ann
 wedded to Mr. 
John Betentham
 now of 
Canterbury.


The 
Dungeon
 is another Mannor in 
Canterbury,
 It was formerly belonging to an ancient Family called 
Chich; Ernaldus de Chich
 was a man of principal note under 
Henry
 the second, 
Richard
 the first, and K. 
John,
 and the Aldermanry of 
Burgate
 in 
Canterbury
 did in elder times appertain to this Family; 
Thoma. Chich
 was was Bai∣liff of 
Canterbury
 1259. and again in the year 1271. was a principal Benefactor to the Church of S. 
Mary Bredin
 in 
Canterbury,
 whose Name in an old Character, together with his Effigies, are set up in the west Window, as his Coat is likewise in Stone-work in the Chancell; 
John Chich
 was Bailiff of 
Canterbury
 in the twenty third, and again in the twenty sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, in the year 1320. 
Robert Malling
 then Commissary of 
Canterbury
 gave Sentence upon clear Evidence by ancient muniments and otherwise, that the Hospital of St. 
Laurence
 in 
Canterbury
 should not only receive the Tithes of the Mannor of the 
Dungeon,
 but likewise of 300. Acres adjacient to it, but this was not without the Tye or Tribute of some Remuneration, for in Autumne 
John Chich
 who was then Lord of the 
Dungeon,
 was to receive for his Servants five loaves of Bread, two Pitchers and an half of Beer, and half a Cheese of four pence; and he himself was to receive 
unum par Cirocecarum ferinarum,
 one pair of Holyday Gloves, and one pound of Wax in Candles, and for his Servants three pair of Gloves; 
Thomas Chich
 this mans Son was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the forty fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, and held his Shrivealtie at the 
Dungeon,
 but in 
Valantine Chich
 this mans great Grandchild, not only the male line but likewise the possession of this place fai∣led, for he about the beginning of 
Edward
 the fourth passed it away to 
Roger Brent
 Esq; and he died seised of it (as appears by his Will recorded at 
Canterbury
) in the year 1486. But in this Family it was not long after this resident, for in the beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, by an old Court Roll I find one 
John Butler
 of 
Heronden
 in 
Eastrye
 possest of it, and he conveyed it to Sir 
John Hales
 Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and when 
Leland
 visited 
Kent,
 which was in the thirtieth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, he lived here, and from him is it now come down to his Successor Sir 
James Hales
 the instant Pro∣prietarie of it.


The 
Moate, alias Wyke,
 is a third Mannor within the precincts of 
Canterbury,
 and had owners of that Sirname; For I read in 
Testa de Nevill
 that 
Stephen de VVyke
 possest it in the twentyeth year of 
Henry
 the third, and paid respective Aid for it at the marri∣age of 
Isabel
 that Princes Sister; and in the Book of 
Aid,
 where there is an Enumera∣tion of the ancient owners, there is a Recital of 
Stephen de Wyke, William le Taylour, John Tancrey,
 and 
Richard Betts,
 who had an Interest in it; but before the beginning of 
Richard
 the second, all these Families were mouldred away and vanished: For in that Kings Reign I find it by the Court Rolls of this place in the hands of Sir 
Richard de Hoo,
 and 
Richard Skippe,
 and they about the latter end of 
Richard
 the second by deed convey∣ed it to 
Simon Spencer,
 and he some few years after alienated it to 
John Standford
 Gentle∣man, who suddenly after Passed it away to 
Richard Smith,
 in whose hands it had not long continued, when the same Devolution brought it over to 
John Eastfield
 Esquire, Son of Sir 
William Eastfield
 who was Knight of the 
Bath,
 and Lord Maior of 
London
 in the year 1438. and from him it was by Sale carried off to 
William Rogers,
 and he by a Fine levied in the thirty third year of 
Henry
 the sixth demises and sells it to 
Philip Belknap
 of 
Canterbury
 Esquire, Maior of that City in the year 1458. and Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the thirty fourth year of 
Henry
 the sixth; he married 
Elizabeth
 Daughter of 
John Wood∣house


Esq; by whom he had Issue 
Alice
 his only Daughter and Heir, who was matched to 
Henry Finch
 of 
Nitherfield
 Esq; Father of Sir 
William Finch
 Banneret, who in his Mothers right was invested in the possession of the 
Mo
t,
 and from him is it now by Successive right devolved to the Right Honourable 
John
 Lord 
Finch,
 created Baron of 
Fordwich
 by the late K. 
Charles,
 when he was Lord Keeper of the great Seal of 
England.


St. 
Dunstans
 in 
Canterbury
 was the Ancient Seat of the noble Family of 
Roper, VVilliam Rosper
 or 
de Rubra Spathâ
 for so the Name is written in old Dateless Evi∣dences, and 
Elnith
 his Wife the Daughter and Heir of 
Edward de Apuldore,
 flou∣rished in the Reign of 
Henry
 the third, and were great Benefactors to the Priorie of Saint 
Martins
 in 
Dover, Iohn de Rubrâ Spathâ,
 or 
Rosper
 did eminent Service in 
Scotland
 under 
Edward
 the third, for which that Prince rewards him and 
William Clifford
 (as appears by a Deed recorded in the Earl of 
Dorsets
 Pedigree) about the twenty ninth year of his Reign, with the third part of those Forfeitures that were due from the 
Jews
 then inhabiting in 
London,
 for the Violation of some Penal Statutes enected against them. 
Edmund
 Son of 
Ralph Roper
 was an eminent Man in the Reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, and 
Henry
 the fifth, under whom he was Justice of the Peace for this County, and died the third year of 
Henry
 the sixth 1433, and lies buried in this Church of St. 
Dunstans; John Roper
 his Son, and 
John VVestcliffe,
 as the Records of this Family instruct me, were Correctors and Surveyours of the Customes of the Cinque Ports in the ninteenth year of 
Henry
 the seventh: 
Jo. Roper
 his Grandchild was Attorney General to 
Henry
 the eighth, and Prothonotary of the Kings Bench, as appears by the Inscription on his Monument in St. 
Dunstans
 Church 1524, and 
VVill. Roper
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the first and second year of 
Philip
 and 
Mary,
 and matched with 
Margaret
 Daughter of Sir 
Thomas More
 Lord Chancellor of 
England,
 who (as the Inscription on her Monument) was 
Graecis Latinisque Literis Doctissima,
 succeeded his Father in the Office of Prothonotary of the Kings Bench, which he discharged with much of Fidelity and Care fifty four years, and left it to his Sor 
Thomas Roper
 Esquire 1577, in which year he died; and from this 
Thomas
 is this Mannor of St. 
Dunstans,
 which for so many Centuries of years hath constantly con∣fessed the Signorie of this Name, now descended to his great Grandchild Mr. 
Edward Roper
 Esquire.


Capell
 in the Hundred of 
Folkstone
 was parcel of that Estate which celebrated the Family of 
Averenches
 to have been its Proprieraries, which continued no longer in the Name then the End of K. 
John;
 for then 
William de Averenches
 dying without Issue Male, 
Matilda
 his onely Daughter and Heir brought 
Capell
 with the two little Man∣nors, 
Halton
 and 
Wolverton alias Wolton,
 to be possest by 
Hamon de Crevequer,
 called in the Language of those times, the great Lord of 
Kent;
 from him they descended to his Son and Heir 
Hamon de Crevequer,
 who dying about the forty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third without Issue, his Estate in 
Kent
 and elsewhere was seised on by that Prince, as having died in Actual Arms against him, but was by the Act of Pacifica∣tion made at 
Kenelworth
 in the fiftieth year of his Reign restored to his four Sisters, whereof one was espoused to 
John de Lenham,
 the second was matched first to 
Nicholas de Sandwich,
 and next to 
John de Segrave; Matilda
 the third was wedded to 
Bertram de Crioll,
 and the fourth was married to 
William de Pateshull;
 but upon the Division of the Estate, 
Capell,
 with its two Appendages 
Halton
 and 
Wolton,
 accrued to 
Crioll,
 by whose Daughter and Heir they came to Sir 
Richard de Rokesley,
 and then by 
Joan
 his Sole Inheritrix to 
Tho. de Peynings;
 in which Family they remained untill the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then Sir 
Edward Poynings
 dying without any lawfull Issue, they came by 
Mary
 his natural Daughter to 
Edward
 Lord 
Clinton,
 to whom they were by Grant confirmed in the thirtieth of that Princes Reign, and he in the second year of Q. 
Mary
 passed them away to Mr. 
Henry Herdson,
 whose Grand∣child Mr. 
Francis Herdson
 conveyed them to his Uncle Mr. 
John Herdson,
 and he dying without Issue, setled them on his Kinsman Sir 
Basil Dixwell
 Knight and Baronet, whose Kinsman Mr. 
Basill Divwell
 of 
Broome
 in 
Barham
 is now Proprietarie of them.


Caldham
 high mounted, is another Mannor in this Parish, which informs us, that in elder times a Family of that Denomination held it, which before the End of

Richard
 the second had passed it away to 
Baker,
 a Family of good Account in this Track, who had a peculiar Chancel belonging to them in 
Folkstone
 Church near the Vestry Door over the Charnell House; 
John Baker
 was Gentleman Porter of 
Callis
 under 
Henry
 the fifth and sixth, and dying without Issue male, 
Robert Brandred
 who had matched with one of his two Coheirs was planted in the Possession, and he about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth passed it away to Sir 
Thomas Brown,
 whose Grandchild Sir 
Matthew Brown
 exchanged it with 
Henry
 the eighth about the thirty sixth of his Reign, and he granted it away to 
William Wilford, John Bennet
 and 
George Brigges;
 and they in the thirty seventh of his Government alienated their Right in this place to 
John Tufton
 Esquire, Ancestor to the right Honourable 
John
 Earl of 
Thanett,
 who still possesses the Signory of it.


Charlton
 in the Hundred of 
Blackheath,
 anciently written 
Ceopleton;
 that is, the Town inhabited with honest, good, stout and usefull men for Tillage, and Country businesse; It anciently belonged to 
William Fitz Oger,
 as 
Doomsday
 Book saith, and was after given to the Monastery of 
Bermondsey
 neer 
Southwarke,
 by 
Robert Bloett
 Bishop of 
Lincoln, Anno sexto Willielmi Secundi.
 King 
Henry
 the third gave the Prior of that House Liberty by his Charter in the fifty third year of his Reign to hold a Market there weekly, and a Fair once in every yeer, three days together, 
viz.
 upon the 
Eve,
 upon 
Trinity Sunday,
 and two days after; the Market was held weekly upon the Monday, and was not long since ciscontinued; but the Fair is not disused but kept yearly upon St. 
Lukes
 day, and called Horn Fair, by reason of the great plenty of all Sorts of Winding Hornes, and Cups, and other Vessels of Horn there brought to be sold. King 
James
 granted the Mannor to Sir 
Adam Newton
 Knight and Baronet, Tutor to Prince 
Henry;
 who there hath built a goodly brave House, and left the Care with his Cost, to enlarge and beautify Gods House, the Parish Church, to Sir 
David Comingham
 Knight and Baronet, late Coforer to Prince 
Charles;
 Mr. 
Newton
 his Brother, and Mr. 
Peter Newton
 Gentleman Usher to the late King 
Charles,
 who have most amply discharged that Trust, and in a manner new builded a great Part thereof, and erected the Steeple new from the Ground, and furnished it with a good Ring of Bells, decorating the same Church without and within so worthily that it surpasseth most in the Shire.


Kedbroke
 neer 
Charlton
 was formerly a Parish, but when the Church decayed, and the paucity of the Inhabitants could not support the Charge that was to maintain the same, they were by Composition annexed to 
Charlton;
 it is of late become of better Note since it pleased King 
Charles
 to create Sir 
William Harvey
 Knight and Baronet, and Baron 
Harvey
 of 
Rosse
 in 
Ireland,
 a Peer of this Realm; also by the Name of Baron 
Harvey
 of 
Kedbroke:
 it being part of his Ladies Inheritance, as being Daughter and one of the three Coheirs of 
Brian Annesley
 Esquire, who having it in Lease from the Crown, bought the Fee-simple of 
Edward Blunt
 of 
Wrickelmersh
 Esquire, to whom it was conveyed by his Father in Law, Sir 
William Garaway
 of 
Lon∣don
 Knight, who had purchased it of King 
James
 in the Beginning of his Government; to whose Royal Demeasne it had been fastned ever since the Suppression of the Priory of 
Bermondsey,
 (in whose Patrimony it was involved) in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth.


In the time of King 
Henry
 the sixth,

 the Church of 
Kedbroke
 was appropriated to the Priory of St. 
Mary Overies
 in 
Southwarke,
 the Vicarage not endowed, but being shrunk into Decay and Solitude, the Inhabitants for many yeers last past have resorted for the performance of Divine Duties to the Parish Church of 
Charlton.


Chalke
 in the Hundred of 
Shamell,
 was parcel of that Demeasne which related to the Abby of 
Bermondsey,
 as appears by 
Kirkbies
 Inquest, a Book kept in the Exche∣quer, and collected in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the first, wherein that Cloister is represented to have had the Possession of this place at that Time; and here it re∣mained untill the generall Dissolution snatched it away in the Time of 
Henry
 the eighth, and that Prince afterwards devolved it to Sir 
George Brook,
 from whom it descended to his Great Grandchild Sir 
William Brook,
 who dying in the year 1643 without Issue male, it came over to his Kinsman Sir 
Jon Brook
 as Reversioner in En∣tail, and he some few years since passed it away to 
James
 Duke of 
Lenox
 lately

deceased, whose Son 
Esme Stuart
 now Duke of 
Lenox,
 is the Heir Apparent of it.


Felborough Clam Lane
 and 
Rainhurst
 were a Limb of that wide Revenue which lay scattered and diffused over the face of all this Hundred, and acknowledged it self to be under the Signory of the Family of 
Cobham; Henry de Cobham
 held them, as ap∣pears by 
Kirkbies
 Inquest, in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the first, and so did his Grand∣child 
John de Cobham
 in the thirty sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 43. 
Parte secunda.
 And in this Family and its Descendants did they settle, until the Reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then by an old Survey of 
Chalke,
 I find them in the Hands of 
Brent,
 and continued in their Possession until the eighth year of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then 
Jo. Brent
 Esq; conveys them, as appears by a Fine levied in that year to Sir 
Henry Wiat,
 and his infortunate Grandchild Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 having by an un∣successeful Solleviation or Rising, forfeited them to the Crown in the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 they remained there until Queen 
Elizabeth
 in the thirty seventh of her Rule granted them in Lease to Sir 
Peter Manwood,
 who passed it to 
Menfield,
 and he to Mr. 
James Crispe,
 but the Fee-simple still remained lodged in the Royal Revenue, until the late King 
Charles
 passed it away to the City of 
London,
 in the year 1630, and that City the same year they were granted, conveyed them to Mr. 
James Crispe,
 who upon his Departure disposed them by Testament to his two Sons Mr. 
Thomas Crispe
 and Mr. 
James Crispe.


Challock
 in the Hundred of 
Calehill
 hath two places in it, which may deservedly come within the Register of those Mannors which are in this Survey to be recorded: The first is 
Otterpley,
 which was an eminent Seat belonging to the ancient Family of 
Apulderfield.
 The first that I find of Note in any publick Record to have possest it, was 
Henry de Apulderfield,
 who had the Grant of a Market and Fayre to his Mannor of 
Apulderfield
 in 
Coldham,
 in the thirty eighth year of 
Hen.
 the third; and this mans great Grandchild 
Henry de Apulderfield
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the fiftieth of 
Edward
 the third, and held his Shrievalty at 
Challock.
 His House was near 
East-well
 in the Earl of 
Winchel∣seys
 upper Park, called 
Apulderfields Garden,
 which is now so obscured in its own Ruins, that we now with Difficulty trace out its Sepulcher, made up of its own complicated Rubbish; but this Mannor, as to some Proportion of it, was passed away before he was Sheriff, to 
Edmund de Hant,
 who held it at his Decease, which was in the forty fourth year of 
Edward
 the third; but neither of these Families lasted longer then the Beginning of 
Richard
 the second; for then I find it entirely invested in 
Richard
 Lord 
Poynings,
 who in the eleventh year of that Prince was possest of it at his Death, and left it to his Sole Heir, 
Eleanor
 matched to 
Henry Percy
 Earl of 
Northumberland,
 in whose Successors the Right was constantly fixed, until the twenty third year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was conveyed by 
Henry
 Earl of 
Northumberland,
 to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney, William Walsingham,
 and 
William Fitz-Williams,
 and they immediately after re-conveyed it to Sir 
Christopher Hales,
 and his Son Sir 
James Hales
 about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth alienated it to Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 by whose Daughter and Co∣heir 
Katharine,
 it came to be the Inheritance of Sir 
Thomas Finch,
 unhappily Ship∣wract by 
New-Haven
 in 
France,
 a Person who deserved a longer Life, and not so dark a Fate; from whom by paternal Descent it is now transmitted to the right honourable 
Heneage Finch
 now Earl of 
Winchelsey.


Loringden
 and 
Deane
 are places in 
Challock
 worthy of Consideration. There is a Tradition very frequent amongst the Country people in this Track, that 
Loringden
 now altogether desolate and full of solitude, was once the Mansion of Gentlemen of this Name, one of which should have waged Combate with one of the 
Apulderfields
 of 
Otterpley
 not far distant, about building a Chappel in the Valley, which was pretended by 
Loringden
 to be erected on Land that was of his Fee-simple; but because this without some more solid Foundation to support then Fame and Vulgar Report, will appear but legend, I will re-present to you what the original Muniments and Evidences have discovered to me in Relation to those who were Possessors of this place. That there was a Family which bore the Name of 
Lourdingden
 or 
Loringden,
 is most certain, for there is a place in 
Challock
 which yet continues the Name of 
Lo∣rindens Forestal;
 but when I consulted the private Evidences of this place, I found upon a serious Disquition they reached no higher then 
Henry
 the fourth, and in his

Reign, it acknowledged it self to be of the Propriety of 
Cadman,
 a Family grown into a reverend esteem by a long Prescription in this Track; but the Name of 
Dean
 con∣tinued in being till the Reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, and was in very ancient Deeds, some of which are not limited with any Date, written 
At Dean
 and 
A Dean,
 and in that Princes Reign was by Sale passed away to the above mentioned Family of 
Cadman;
 in which Name both 
Loringdean
 and 
Dean
 remained clapsed up, till the entrance of K. 
James,
 and then by a Sole Daughter and Heir they went over to 
Plomer,
 who almost in our Memory transferred his Right in both of them by Sale to 
Peirce.


The Church of 
Challock
 being fallen down, was new erected by the 
Apulderfields,
 as the Glass windows and Stone work in divers places, embroider'd and diaper'd with the 
Voided Cross,
 which was their paternal Coat Armour, do more then sufficiently testifie.


Cranebrook
 gives name to the Hundred wherein it is seated, a Town very po∣pulous, in respect it was one of the first places where the Manufacture of Clothing was professed and practised, being brought into 
England
 in 
Edward
 the thirds Reign, who by proposing rewards, and granting many Immunities, trained 
Flemings
 into this Nation in the tenth year of his reign, to teach the 
English
 that Art of Draperie, or Weaving and making woollen Cloth, which is esteemed at this day, one of the Butteresse which sustains the Common-wealth; and certainly for making durable Broad clothes with very good Mixtures and perfect Colours, 
Cranebrook
 doth with the most that way excell.


The first place of note in it, which obviates the eye, is 
Sisingherst;
 but more properly and truly written 
Saxenhurst;
 and as 
Bittenden,
 not far distant derives its Name from the 
Brittons,
 so in most probability did this take and assume its Denomination from the 
Saxons.
 In 
Testa de Nevil,
 a Book kept in the Exchequer, which is a memorial of those who holding their Lands in the Knights Service paid relief in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 third, towards the Marriage of the Kings Sister. There is mention of 
John de Saxenhurst
 who was taxed for his Lands here at 
Cranebrook,
 which certain∣ly was this 
Sisingherst,
 with the two little Mannors of 
Copton
 and 
Stone;
 which had al∣wayes the same Owners with 
Sisingherst:
 In times of a more modern Character, the 
Berhams
 by the Female Heirs of 
Saxenhurst
 were Lords of 
Sisingherst,
 with its two adjuncts 
Copton
 and 
Stone; Richard de Berham
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the forty fourth year of 
Edward
 the third was here resident, and is written of this place; and 
Henry de Berham
 this mans Father paid respective Aid at the making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, for sundry parcels of Land which he held in 
Kent,
 and amongst the rest, for his Lands at 
Cranebrook;
 and in this Family was the possession of this place, with that of 
Copton
 and 
Stone
 concentered till the lat∣ter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then part of 
Sisingherst
 with 
Copton
 and 
Stone
 was sold to Mr. 
Tho. Baker
 Father to Sir 
John Baker
 Attorney General, and of the Privy Counsel to Queen 
Mary,
 and likewise Chancellor of the Exchequer, and under-Trea∣surer, who purchased the residue, and raised that Magnificent Pile within the Park, which now charmes with so much Delight the eyes of the Spectators; and from this man by the channel of paternal and lineal Descent is the Inheritance of 
Sising∣herst, Copton,
 and 
Stone,
 emptied into Sir 
John Baker
 Baronet, the instant Lord of the Fee.


Secondly, 
Glastenbury
 is not to be forgotten, since it is of so great a Name elsewhere, and is called as the other is from 
Glastney
 the 
Saxon
 Idiome of 
Inis Witrin,
 the Watry or Glassie place. The House which stands in a Park is moated about, and hath been for many Generations the capital Mansion of the ancient Family of 
Rokchurst,
 ever since 
Stephen Rokehurst
 or 
Roberts
 of 
Curtesden,
 and in old Records sometimes written 
Rokehurst Den
 in 
Goudherst,
 about the beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth married 
Joan
 Sole Heir of 
William Tilley
 of 
Glastenbury,
 (whose Ancestors had flourished at this place, as private Evidencs instruct me, ever since the reign of 
Edward
 the first) and in right of that Alliance became Lord of this Mansion. This 
Stephen Roberts, aliàs Rokehurst,
 was Grand-child of 
William Roberts, aliàs Rokehurst,
 and that 
William
 was great Grand-child of 
William de Rokehurst,
 who in the reign of 
William
 the Conque∣rour, as the Evidences of this Family inform me, came out of 
Anandale
 in 
Scotland
 in∣to

England;
 and to preserve the memory of this man, did the Family till the Govern∣ment of 
Henry
 the seventh, write 
Roberts alias Rokchurst,
 till in the East window of the North Chancel of the Church of 
Cranebrook,
 which was built by 
Walur Roberts
 Esq; in that Princes Reign, as also in most of his Deeds and Conveyences the 
alias
 was left out.


Coursehorne
 finds place to be remembred in the Map of 
Kent,
 and then must not be forgotten here; it hath been for above three hundred years (as appears by private Records) the Inheritance of 
Henley,
 in an Escheat Roll taken in the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the third, and marked with the number 92. After the death of 
Richard Haudloe,
 who it seems had Lands at 
Cranebrook,
 there is mention of one 
Gerva; Henley
 that was one of the Jury and concerned in the Inquisition: But that which much improves the Fame of this Mansion, is, that it was the Cradle of Sir 
Walter Henley
 Serjeant at Law, a man of eminent repute in this County in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and by his three Daughters and Coheirs, 
Elizabeth
 married to ....... 
Waller
 of 
Grome-bridge, Hellen
 first matched to 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bedgbury,
 secondly to Sir 
George Somersett,
 and thirdly to 
Thomas Vane
 of 
Burston;
 and lastly 
Ann
 wedded to 
Richard Covert
 of 
Slaugham
 in 
Sussex,
 knit those Noble Families together in one Alli∣ance, but 
Coursehorne
 did by Descent come over to his Brother 
Gervas Henley
 Esquire, from whom Sir 
Thomas Henley
 now of 
Coursehorne
 is lineally extracted.


Another ancient place there is in 
Cranebrook,
 called 
Hartridge,
 the possession in times past of a worthy Family of that Sirname, among them chiefly to be remembred is 
Thomas Hartridge,
 for he was one of the Conservators or Justices of Peace in this County in the thirty fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, when there was but eight only in the whole Shire. It hath been since much honoured by the 
Will fords,
 who by 
James Willsford
 a most worthy Senator of 
London,
 derive themselves from the right ancient Family of 
Willsford
 of 
Willsford
 in 
Devonshire,
 and are fairly spread from hence into many Branches both in this County, and elsewhere; and after it had thus for divers Descents been resident in this noble Family, the Possession was in our Fathers remem∣brance united by purchase to the Patrimony of 
Tindall,
 now of 
Sutton Valence.


Fifthly 
Betenham
 is not to be passed over in silence, which is a Note worthy Place in this Parish, that gave both Seat and Sirname to the 
Betenhams,
 but when the eldest Line had only three Daughters and Coheirs, matched to 
More, Dering,
 and 
Fisher,
 who divided the Patrimony, this in his Wifes right was annexed to the Demeasn of 
More,
 and this after 
More
 had alienated his Interest in it, came to acknowledge for Sole Owners the 
Roes,
 of which Family was the right Noble Sir 
Thomas Roe
 Knight, Chan∣cellor of the most Noble Order of the Garter, and of the Privy Councel to the late Kidg 
Charles,
 and severall years Embassador to the Great 
Mogor,
 Great 
Turk,
 King of 
Sweden,
 and lastly to the Princes of the Protestant Union in 
Germany,
 in the year 1642. After which Negotiation most prudently transfacted, he returned, and died; but in this Family it remained not long, for in the remembrance of that Age our Fathers lived in, it was by Sale demised to 
Mansfield,
 in whom the Possession is at this pre∣sent setled.


There are two places more which may be registred in this Inventorie. The first is 
Plechinghurst,
 which was an ancient Seat belonging to the 
Sharpeighs
 of 
Sharpeigh,
 a Family of deep rooted Antiquitie in this Track; 
Robert de Sharpeigh
 flourished here at 
Cranebrook
 about the beginning of 
Edward
 the first, and was witness to a Deed of 
William de Brindens
 of 
Brinden:
 In this Parish formerly the 
Linds,
 and now the 
Hol∣dens;
 but this Deed is without Date: another 
Robert Sharpeigh
 of 
Sharpeigh
 and 
Crane∣brook,
 as I find by an ancient Roll was in Commission as Justice of the Peace about the latter end of the Government of 
Henry
 the seventh: But as all sublunary things are crushed and overturned by the wheel of an inconstant Vicissitude, so by Conse∣quence are our Possessions likewise; for, after this place had been for so many Descents the Inheritance of this ancient Family, it was almost within the Verge of our Re∣membrance, first alienated to 
Martin,
 and by him not long since by Sale de∣mised to 
Walter.


The second is 
Buckhurst,
 which is the last place of Account within the circuit of this Parish. If we go to trace the Antiquity of thse Families, who were the ancient Proprietorrs of it, we shall find that it acknowledged 
Hadloe
 and 
Buckhurst
 for its elder

Possessors, that the first had some concernment here, not only the private Deeds and Muniments of this place do evince to us, but likewise by an Inquisition taken after the decease of 
Richard de Hadloe,
 by which it is evident he held some Estate here in the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 32. And that the second Family had some Interest here, not only the Authority abovesaid doth justifie, but the Name it self doth tacitly insinuate that this Mansion formerly gave Seat and De∣nomination to the Family of 
Buckhurst;
 in times of a lower step, that is, in the Reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, I find it in the Tenure of 
Drayner;
 but how it devolved to this Family, I cannot discover; It is enough that it continued united to their Dimeasn, untill the beginning of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was conveyed to 
Alexander Coach∣man,
 in whose Descendant the Signorie and Interest of it hath ever since been con∣stantly resident.


Cranebroke
 had the Grant of a Market to be observed weekly there on the 
Saturday,
 in the eighteenth year of 
Edward
 the first, as appears 
Cart. Edw.
 1. 
Num.
 92.


I had almost forgot to tell you that there is a place in this Parish called 
Holden,
 which with 
Hawkeridge
 hath for some Centuries of years acknowledged the 
Holdens
 for its Proprietaries, and are still united to the Patrimony of this Name and Family, which for such a vast Succession of time hath been planted at 
Cranebroke.


There was a Chappell at a place called 
Milkhouse,
 in the Eastern part of this Parish founded and endowed by 
John Lawless,
 about the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, which upon the generall Dissolation of Chantries and all other Religious Fraternities by 
Henry
 the eighth, was by that Prince about the latter end of his Rule granted to Sir 
John Baker
 of 
Sisingherst
 not far distant, whose Revenue is yet in the possession of Sir 
John Baker
 his Successor.


There was another Chappell founded at 
Sisingherst
 (as the Evidences of that place do insinuate) by 
John de Saxenhurst;
 which was reedified by the late Sir 
John Baker,
 and by a Deed delivered to 
John Bancroft
 Bishop of 
Oxford
 devoted to the Service of God, and dedicated as it was before to St. 
John
 the 
Evangelist:
 After the reception of this Instrument, which was in the year 1637. it was by the same Bishop Consecrated; first, by a Prayer at the entrance of the Chappell, then by others made at the Seats, Pulpit, and Communion Table; the effect of all which was, that God would accept of it for a House, and likewise of the Prayers and Devotions that in that Oratorie were offered up by the faithful People of God to his Honour and Service.


Charing
 in the Hundred of 
Calehill,
 is in 
Saxon
 written 
Cering,
 and by that Name King 
Kenulf
 in the year 799. made Restitution of it to 
Christ Church
 in 
Canterbury
 at the humble request of Arch-Bishop 
Athelard,
 for King 
Offa
 had taken it away from that Church in the time of Arch-Bishop 
Janibert;
 and being thus regained to the See, it continued so till the great Exchange made in the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth with that Prince by Arch-Bishop 
Cranmer;
 the Fee-simple was planted in the Crown: In the time of the Conquest in the Notitia of the Arch-Bishop and Cathe∣drals Lands, because they held it in ancient Demeasn (that is, they had possest it long before the Conquest) and a Mannor-house or Palace there, it was called 
Proprium Manerium Archiepiscopi.
 In the time of 
Edward
 the Confessor it went for eight Sul∣lings or Plough-Lands, but in the twentieth year of 
William
 the Conquerour it was rated in 
Domsday
 Book at seven Sullings, because one Plough-Land was laid into his Demeasn. The Church dedicated to St. 
Peter
 and 
Paul,
 was anciently famous by a tra∣ditional relation, (which I am not much moved with, for it wants the stamp of venera∣ble Authority) which did affirm, that the Block on which St. 
John
 the Baptists Head was cut off, was brought into 
England
 in the Reign of 
Richard
 the first, and kept in this Church.


The first place of secular Interest which doth occurre, is 
Pett,
 the Evidences of this place now in the hands of Sir 
Robert Honywood
 do mention the 
Petts
 to be in Ages of a very high Assent, that is, about the Reign of 
Henry
 the third, and 
Edward
 the first, Proprietaries of it but publick Records reach no farther than 
Newcourt
 Lord of the Mannor of 
Newcourt
 not far distant; 
Jeffrey de Newcourt
 Son of 
Walter de Newcourt
 paid respective Aid in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third for his Lands at 
New∣court
 and 
Pett.
 After the 
Newcourts
 were gone out, the 
Hatches
 were by Purchase

planted at 
Pett
 and 
Newcourt;
 they were called so from their abode near some Gate or passage, for one of them who was Possessor of these two places, was written 
Hugh at Hatch;
 from this Family by Sale about the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, the right of 
Pett
 and 
Newcourt
 devolved to 
William Warham;
 and in some Copies of Fines which I have seen by a false Transcription written 
William VVarren,
 and this man sold them both again in the entrance of the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth to 
Robert Atwater,
 who determining in 
Mary Atwater
 his Sole Heir, She by matching with 
Robert Honywood
 Esquire of 
Henewood
 in 
Postling,
 wound up the Interest of these two places 
Pett
 and 
Newcourt
 into the Demeasn of that Family, so that they now own Sir 
Robert Honywood
 his great Grandchild the Sole Proprietary of them.


Stilley
 is another little Mannor lying within 
Charing,
 and was anciently enwrapt in the Revenue of 
Frene, John de Frene
 who flourished in the Reign of 
Henry
 the third, is mentioned in 
Testa de Nevill,
 a Book collected in the twentieth year of that Prince, to have paid Aid at the Marriage of the Kings Sider, for Lands which he possest at 
Charing;
 after in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, there is a recital in the Book of 
Aid
 of Sir 
Thomas de Brockhull
 Son of Sir 
William de Brockhull,
 who paid an Auxiliary supply at the making of the Black Prince Knight for his Lands which he held at 
Saltwood, Calehill, Charing,
 and other places in this County; but after this the Possession was not long resident in this Family, for 
Henry Brockhull
 this mans second Son, to whom these Mannors of 
Stilley
 and 
Newland
 were assigned for livelyhood, about the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, transmitted them by Sale to 
John Darell
 Esquire, Son of Sir 
William Darell,
 who was extracted out of the right ancient and Knightly Family of the 
Darells
 of 
Sesay;
 from whom Sir 
John Darell
 of 
Calehill,
 and Lord of this Mannor of 
Stilley,
 is originally and lineally issued out.


Wickins
 is another Mannor circumscribed within the Limits of this Parish, it was originally the Patrimony of 
Brent,
 a Family well endowed in this Track, and cer∣tainly was as ancient a Seat of this Family as any which lay involved in their Re∣venue, for 
John Brent
 Son of 
Robert de Brent
 of 
Charing
 paid respective Aid for Lands which he held here in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and 
William Brent
 who was Son of 
Hugh Brent
 of 
Charing,
 made his Will the twenty seventh year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and disposed of this place to his Son 
Hugh Brent;
 and this 
Hugh
 had Issue 
William Brent,
 who composed his Testament in the tenth year of 
Henry
 the seventh; and this 
William
 was great Grandfather to 
Thomas Brent,
 in whom the Male Line determined, so that 
Margaret
 his Sister became his Sole Heir, who by matching with 
Jo. Dering
 of 
Surrenden Dering
 Esquire, hath made 
Wickins
 ever since parcel of the Demeasn of that Name and Family.


Newland
 is another eminent Mannor in 
Charing,
 which gave Seat and Sirname to a Family so styled: Sir 
John de Newland
 lived here in the Reign of 
Edward
 the first, and sealed with an 
Escollop
 upon a 
Cheveron
 for his Coat, which is yet visible in ancient Registers, and other venerable Monuments of Antiquity; but before the latrer end of 
Edward
 the third, this Family was extinguished at this place, and then it became parcel of the noble Family of 
Brockhull
 of 
Cale-Hill,
 and continued folded up in their Possession untill the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then it was passed away by Deed from 
Henry Brockhull
 to 
John Darrell
 Esquire, from whom it is by successive Devolution now transported to his Successor Sir 
John Darrell
 of 
Cale-Hill
 Knight.


Eversley
 next courts us to a Remembrance, it lies partly in 
Charing,
 and partly in 
Stacefield,
 and though now obscure, yet in elder times was made eminent by being one of the Mansions of 
Brian de Eversley,
 a Man very eminent in the Reign of 
Henry
 the third and 
Edward
 the first, and is mentioned in the 
Leiger
 Book of 
Feversham,
 to have been a Benefactor to that Covent; but his Piety could not secure the Title to his Posterity, for about the beginning of 
Edward
 the third, I find it planted in the Pos∣fession of 
Peiferer,
 by the Heir General of which Family called 
Julian,
 it came to be the Possession of 
Thomas St. Leger,
 and he died possest of it in the tenth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and bequeathed it to 
Mary
 his Daughter and Coheir, espoused to 
Henry Aucher,
 from whom it was wafted down by descendant Right to his Successor Sir 
Anthony Aucher,
 who about the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth
 alienated it to

Michael Sond;
 Esquire, afterwards created Sir 
Michael Sonds,
 from whom it is now de∣volved to his Descendant Sir 
George Sonds
 Knight of the 
Bath.


Tremhatch
 in old Deeds 
Tramhatch,
 lies likewise in 
Charing,
 and is advanced and ascended to some Note and Estimate, since it was honoured by being parcel of the Patrimony of 
Barham,
 a Family which was made splendid by an eminent Repute, and no less considerable by a spreading Revenue which they held in this County, of whom I shall speak more when I come to 
Barham Court
 in 
Terstan,
 one of the prin∣cipal Mansions of this Name: Finally, after it had for several Descents confessed the Propriety of this Family, it was by 
Richard Barham
 conveyed by a Fine levied the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the fourth to 
John Haut,
 where the Title was not so fixed as in the former, for he not long after by a semblable Alteration passed it away to 
Henry Malmains,
 and who about the Reign of 
Henry
 the fifth determined in two Daughters and Coheirs, whereof was 
Agnes
 wedded to 
Thomas Gouldwell,
 and so by this Alliance 
Tremhatch
 was enwrapped in his Patrimony, and continued in the Descendants of this Name untill the forty second year of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was alie∣nated by 
John Gouldwell
 and 
Cicely
 his Wife to 
Robert Gaunt,
 whose Son 
Thomas Gaunt
 died possest of it 1625, and gives it first to his Brother 
George Gaunt,
 and in De∣failance of Issue to 
Thomas Carlisle,
 who in Right of the premises is now invested in the Possession.


Broughton
 is a Mannor which is likewise circumscribed within the Limits of 
Charing,
 and had Owners likewise of that Sirname. 
Adam de Broughton
 and some∣times written 
Brocton,
 flourished here about the Reign of 
Edward
 the first, and his Descendants enjoyed the Proprietie of it untill the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, and then it was alienated to 
Paunsherst, Thomas Paunsherst
 made his Will in the year of our Lord 1472, and gave it to 
Thomas Paunsherst
 his Son, and he made his Will in the year 1503, and disposed of it to his Daughter 
Joan Paunsherst,
 and in Defailance of her Issue, to his Kinsman 
Thomas Paine;
 She deceased without Issue, and so the Remainder devolved to be the Inheritance of 
Paine,
 in which Name it remained untill times of our remembrance, and then it was alienated to the Father of the in∣stant Proprietary, 
Withick.


Here was a 
Chauntry
 at 
Charing
 founded, as an ancient Survey of this Parish in∣structs me, by Sir 
Iohn Burley,
 who bare Quarterly 
Or
 and 
Sables,
 and was called suc∣cessively 
Burley
's 
Chauntry
 the Duty enjoyned the Priest that was to officiate, was to pray for the Soules of Sir 
Iohn Burley,
 Sir 
William de Burleigh,
 and the Descendants of that Family, the Demeasn which was to support it, was upon the suppression granted to Sir 
Io. Darell
 Ancestor to Sir 
Iohn Darell
 of 
Cale-Hill,
 who now is in the Enjoyment of it.


Acton
 is the laft place of Account in 
Charing,
 which is eminent in respect of that relation it had to the ancient and noble Family of 
Beaufits,
 who made it their Seat before they were transplanted to 
Twidal
 in 
Gillingham. Robert Beaufits,
 as appears by an ancient Court Roll held it in the Reign of 
Henry
 the third, and from him did it descend to his Grandchild 
Robert Beaufits,
 who about the fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, planted himself at 
Twidal:
 but yet this still continued in the Name untill the Reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then this Name expiring in Daughters and Co∣heirs, one of them called 
Ioan
 by matching with 
Robert Arnold
 made it the Pro∣priety of that Family, and he had Issue 
William Arnold,
 who conveyed it about the the middle of 
Henry
 the eighth to Sir 
Anthony Sonds,
 whose Grandchild Sir 
Richard Sonds
 in our Fathers remembrance alienated it to 
Hutchins,
 from whom by the Hands of Mr. 
Nicholas Nicholson,
 who was made his Feoffee in Trust to discharge Debts and Legacies, it is now come over to 
Godden.


Chartham
 in the Hundred of 
Bredge
 and 
Petham,
 is a Mannor belonging to the Sea of 
Canterbury,
 but of whose Donation I know not; onely 
Doomsday
 Book repre∣sents it thus appraised, 
Certeham est Manerium de vestitu Monachorum, & T. E. R. de∣fondebat se pro IIII Sullings, & nunc similiter, & est appretiatur XX & V
 
lb.


Having done with 
Chartham,
 I shall now discover what places are enclosed within the Verge of it, which were alwayes of temporal Interest.


Densted
 is another Mannor in 
Chartham,
 which in the twentieth year of 
Edward


the third was held by 
John
 the Son of Sir 
John Polre
 of 
Polre
 in 
Harbledowne,
 but onely as Lessee to the Priory of 
Leeds,
 to which Covent it was given by 
Hamon de Crevequer
 about the forty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third, 
pro salute Animae suae & Antecessorum suorum,
 says an old Note extracted out of the 
Coucher
 Book of the Prioty; yet the whole Mannor did not accrue to this Cloister by the former Donation, for in the eighth year of 
Rich.
 the second, 
Rob. Bovehatch,
 as appears, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 81. being convicted of Felony, was found to have held some Land here at 
Densted,
 which upon the Forfeiture, was by that Prince, it is probable, as was customary in those times, settled on the Prio∣ry of 
Leeds,
 and lay wholly couched in their Revenue until the publick Dissolution in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth rent it off, and then it was in the thirty seventh year of 
Henry
 the eighth granted to 
John Tufton
 Esquire, and he about the third year of 
Ed.
 the sixth alienated it to 
Richard Argal
 Esquire; from whom not long after it came over by Sale to Mr. 
Bartholomew Man,
 and he about the Beginning of Q. 
Elizabeth
 conveyed it by Sale to 
William Lovelace
 Esquire, Serjeant at Law to that Princess; and his Son Sir 
Will. Lovelace,
 about the Beginning of K. 
James,
 passed it away to to Sir 
Will. Cullimore,
 whose Lady not long after conveyed it to 
Tho. Steed
 of 
Steed-Hill,
 and he not many years since demised it to Sir 
Tho. Swan
 of 
Southfleet,
 whose Son and Heir 
William Swan
 Esquire enjoys the instant Signorie of it.


Howfield
 is a second place which calls for our Notice, it was as high as any Evidence can furnish me with Intelligence, to steer me on to any old Discovery, the Patrimonial Inheritance of 
Fogge,
 a noble and Knightly Family as any in this Track: Sir 
Thomas Fogge
 who inhabited at 
Toniford,
 about the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, purchased this and 
Toniford
 of 
John de Toniford,
 about the last year of that Princes Rule, and in the Revenue of this Family did the Title of this Mannor for many Descents lye rol∣led up, till some few Generations since it was alienated to 
Colepeper,
 where after some short residence, the Possession by the same Fate was transplanted into 
Vane,
 from whom not many years since it went away by Sale to Sir 
Will. Man


 of 
Canterbury,
 who is the instant Proprietary of it.


But the place in 
Chartham
 of most eminent Account is the Mannor of 
Shalmesford-Bridge,
 so called because the Mansion House is situated near the 
Bridge,
 which crosses the Stoure. It was for many Generations the Inheritance of a Family which had here their Seat, and derived from hence their Sirname, and continued down in an un∣interrupted succession in the Possession of this Family, until about the beginning of the reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, (as appears by the Deed which I have seen) 
Ann
 Daughter and Sole Heir of 
William Shalmesford
 was wedded to 
John Petit,
 and so by this Alliance the Fee-simple of this place was lincked to their Patrimony; but in our Fathers Memory the Tie was broken, for 
William Petit
 this Mans Successor de∣ceased without Issue Male, and left onely three Daughters his Coheirs, 
Katharine
 married to 
Michael Belke, Elizabeth
 matched to 
Giles Masters,
 and lastly 
Dorothy
 espoused first to 
William Masters,
 secondly to 
John Meriwether,
 and thirdly to ...... 
Parker
 of 
North-Fleet,
 who shared his Revenue; but this upon the separation of the Estate, did improve the Demeasn of 
Michael Belke
 with its accession, from whom it is descended to the present owner Mr. ....... 
Belke,
 now Vicar of 
Wye,
 issued out from the 
Belkes
 of 
Coperham
's 
Sole
 in 
Shelvich,
 which hath been in the Tenure and Pos∣session, as it now is, of this Name and Family, as the private Evidences of the place do manifest, almost four hundred years.


There is yet another petty Mannor in 
Chartham
 called 
Shalmesford Street,
 but more truly and originally the Mansion of 
Bolles,
 for it was the Interest of that Name and Fa∣mily who had large Possessions at 
Chilham
 and the parts adjacent, but upon my view∣ing the private Evidences of this place, some of which reached to 
Edw.
 the third, I could not discover that any of them were ever represented under the notion of Gentlemen, or that there was any Coat of Arms insculped on their Seats, after 
Bolles
 was worn out, which was about the beginning of the reign of Q, 
Eliz.
 the Possession was by Sale surren∣dred to 
Cracknal,
 from whom in that Age which bordered upon our remembrance, it was by the same Fatality conveyed away to 
Michel,
 who claims the present Possession of it.


Chetham
 with 
Gillingham
 are knit into one Hundred, so that it gives Name to that Track wherein it is situared; it was in Ages of a very high Pedigree, the Seat of the Potent, Ancient, and Illustrious Family of 
Crevequer,
 and was 
Caput Baroniae,
 or the

principal Mannor which related to their Barony, before they transplanted themselves to 
Leeds
 Castle, and frequently writ 
Domini de Cetham; Hamon de Crevequer
 lived in the Time of the 
Conquerour,
 and is mentioned in the great Survey, styled 
Deomesday
-Book, and he had Issue 
Robert Crevequer,
 or 
de Crepite Corde,
 who was joyned as an Assistant to 
John Fiennes
 in the Guard of 
Dover
 Castle, and he was Grand-father to 
Robert Crevequer
 who erected 
Leeds
 Castle, and had Issue 
Hamon de Crevequer,
 who matched with 
Matilda de Averenches,
 Daughter and Heir of 
William de Averenches,
 by whom he had Issue 
Hamon de Crevequer,
 who was so involved in the Design and Combination of 
Simon de Montfort,
 which was to retrench the Prerogative of 
Henry
 the third, that he made the Breast of Prince 
Edward,
 eldest Son to that King, boile with so much Passion and Animosity, that it could not be appeased or allayed, until he had appointed 
Henry Cobbam
 his Substitute in his Constableship of 
Dover,
 to dis∣mantle and raze his Castle at 
Leeds,
 and seise on this Mannor as the Expiation and recompense of so great a Defection and Folly; and although his Crimes were after∣wards absolved and entombed in the Pacification of 
Killingworth,
 yet I do not find that ever 
Chetham
 was restored to him, for in the tenth year of 
Edward
 the second, that Prince exchanges this Mannor and divers other pieces of Land with 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 for the Mannor of 
Adresley
 and the Advowson of the Church in 
Shropshire:
 But he soon after insculped these Benefits of the Kings in Sand, a weak Register to record so many important Obligations, and by his Confederacy with 
Tho.
 Earl of 
Lancaster,
 and others of the mutinous Nobility, forfeited both this and his life at 
Canterbury;
 upon whose Tragedie it resolved again into the Revenue of the Crown, and there rested until K. 
Edw.
 the third, in the second year of his Reign restored it again to his Son 
Bartholomew Badelesmer,
 and he dying in the twelfth year of that Kings Go∣vernment without Issue, 
Margaret
 matched to 
William Rosse,
 and re-married to 
Thomas Arundel,
 and 
Margery
 another of his Sisters matched to Sir 
Jo. de Tib itot,
 and Co-heirs, shared his Inheritance at this place. Sir 
John Tibitot
 in his Wife's right died seised of it in the thirty third year of 
Edw.
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 39. And 
Margaret
 Widow of 
Will. Rosse,
 and Wife of 
Tho. Arundel,
 was in possession of a Moitie of it at her decease, which was in the thirty seventh year of 
Edw.
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 62. And from these two did it descend by the successive steps of paternal progression, to 
Tho.
 Lord 
Rosse,
 who was beheaded at 
Newcastle
 upon 
Tine
 and attainted in the fourth year of 
Edw.
 the fourth, as a Complice of the House of 
Lancaster;
 and likewise to 
John Tiptoft
 Earl of 
Worcester,
 who was attainted and beheaded in the year 1470, as a Partisan of the House of 
York:
 so that the whole Mannor by the several Attaints being swallowed up in the Revenue of the Crown, it was by 
Edw.
 the fourth in the eighteenth year of his Reign granted to 
Roger
 Lord 
Wentworth
 and 
Margaret
 his Wife, Widow of 
Tho.
 Lord 
Rosse,
 and 
Tho.
 Lord 
Wentworth
 this mans Successor, about the Beginning of Q. 
Eliz.
 alienated it to 
Barnham
 and 
Slany,
 who immediately after disposed of their right in it by a joynt Sale to 
Barker,
 from whom by the like Fate within the Verge of that Age, which fell under our Grand-fathers remembrance, it came over to Sir 
Rob. Jackson;
 and he not many years since conveyed it, by Sale to Sir 
Oliver Boteler,
 Grand-father to Sir 
Oliver Boteler
 Baro∣net, in whom resides the present Signorie of it. But 
Waldeslade
 was given by 
Rich.
 the second in the eleventh year of his Reign (as the Book called 
Feoda Militum
 kept in the Exchequer intimates) to the Abby of 
Canous Langley,
 frequently written 
Childrens Langley,
 and lay involved in their revenue till the general Dissolution, and then King 
Henry
 the eighth in the thirty fifth year of his reign granted it to Sir 
Thomas Moile;
 from whom the Fee-simple by 
Amy
 his Daughter and Co-heir devolved to Sir 
Thomas Kempe,
 and he in the tenth year of Q. 
Eliz.
 passed it away to 
Jo. Mabbe,
 who in the twentieth of her reign alienated it to 
VVilliam Emes,
 from whom in the twenty fifth of that Princess it devolved to 
Richard Fogge
 Esq; and he in the twenty sixth year of her Government conveyed it to Mr.

 
Tho. Cocks,
 who in the thirty sixth of that Queen transferred it by Sale to Mr. 
Richard Lea;
 from whom it descended to his Son and Heir Captain 
Rich. Lea
 of Great 
Delce
 Esquire, and he by Sale gave up his right to his second Brother Mr. 
Thomas Lea,
 who dying without Issue gave it to his Nephew the instant Proprietary 
Richard Lea
 now of Great 
Delce
 Esquire.


The late Repair of the Parish Church, and new Building of the Steeple commends the religious Care and Cost of his late Majesties Commissioners and Officers of the

Navy Royal in the year 1635. But the Arsenals, Store-houses and Shipdocks erected by the late K. 
Charles,
 are so magnificent and universally useful, that they are become a principal Pillar of the Nations support, so far as they relate to the naval defence of it, and affords variety of imployment, by the Manufacture of Cordage, as also by the Careening and Building of Ships.


Chetham Hospital
 called St. 
Bartholomews,
 was founded by 
Gundulphus
 Bishop of 
Rochester
 in the time of 
William Rufus,
 to which the 
Norwoods
 of 
Norwood,
 and the 
Crevequers
 (as the Records of the Church of 
Rochester
 do specifie) were plentitul Benefactors.


Chart Magna
 or 
Great Chart
 gives Name to the whole Hundred which lies about it, and hath thereby a tacite Note of Antiquity and eminence annexed to it, and was in the 
Saxons
 Time called 
Seleberts Chert.
 In the year of 
Grace
 788. King 
Cenulfe
 or 
Kenulfe
 at the Request of Arch-Bishop 
Athelard
 regranted this place to the Sea of 
Centerbury,
 for 
Offa
 sometime before had wrested it from Arch-Bishop 
Janibert.
 In the Time of the Conquest, when the Church Demeasn was rated, this was valued at three Sullings or Plough-Lands.


Goldwell
 is an ancient Mannor and Mansion in this Parish, which was for many Ages and Descents the Inheritance of the noble and illustrious Family of 
Goldwell,
 which in Times of an elder Aspect, gave them both Seat and Sirname, out of which two learned Bishops descended, 
Jam. Goldwell
 who was Bishop of 
Norwich
 in the year 1472, and prin∣cipal Secretary of State to 
Edw.
 the fourth, who obtained a Grant from that Prince to found a 
Chauntry
 in Great 
Chart,
 as appears, 
Pat.
 15. 
Edw.
 4. 
Pars tertia.
 And 
Tho. Goldwell
 Bishop of St. 
Asaph,
 in the year 1555. But alass! after this Mannor had been so long seated in the Patrimony of 
Goldwell,
 it was at length alienated (such is the volatile and unsetled temper of all earthly Inheritances) not many years since by 
J. Goldwell
 to Sir 
Will. Withins,
 and he passed it away to Sir 
J. Tufton
 Ancestor to the right honourable 
Jo. Tufton
 now E. of 
Thanet,
 who by paternal Descent is now entituled to the Possession of 
Goldwell:
 but 
Goddinton
 by 
Joan Goldwell
 who was Daughter and Heir to 
Tho. Goldwell,
 a branch sprouted out of the principal Stem at 
Goldwell,
 came to be the Inheritance of 
Tho. Tooke,
 and hath for sundry Generations continued in that Name till this Day, some of which lie buried in 
Chart
 Church with very fair Inscriptions, unless the Sacrilegious Impiety of these Times hath ravished away the Brass which should stand an Alphabet to their Dust; and in the upper Church windows, about the second Story, their Gentry, Descent, Matches, and Alliance is most amply exprest in their Armories, and that (unless the wildness of some barbarous Hand have lately demolished them) in coloured Glass.


Chelmington
 is another Mannor in this Parish which gave Sirname to a generous Family, who I believe had here their Mansion too, though by the repeated and suc∣cessive Impressions of Age it be now enter'd in Rubbish and Oblivion; finally, after this place had for many Descents been wrapt up in the Revenue of this Name and Fa∣mily, it devolved at last to 
John Chelmington,
 whose Effigies is represented to us in one of the Church windows by an armed Portraicture, who deceased in the reign of 
Henry
 the fourth without Issue Male, so that 
Eliz. Chelmington
 was his Daughter and Heir, who by matching with 
Roger Twisden
 Esq; cast it into the Patrimony of that noble and ancient Family, in respect of which original Alliance the right of this Mannor is now fixed in Sir 
Roger Twisden
 Knight and Baronet, a person to whom for his learned Conduct of these my imperfect Labours thorough the gloomy and perplexed paths of Antiquity, and the many Difficulties that did assault me, I am signally oblieged.


Little Chart
 lies in the Hundred of 
Calchill,
 and does involve that place within the Precincts and Circumference of it, which gives Denomination to the whole Hun∣dred; It was restored to the Monks of 
Christ Church
 in 
Canterbury
 by 
Kenulfe
 King of 
Mercia,
 at the request of Arch-Bishop 
Athelard
 or 
Atheldred,
 in the year of 
Grace
 799. for King 
Offa
 had before violently torn it off from the Patrimony of the Church, as appears by that ancient Record called the Book of 
Christ Church.
 In the year 1044, one 
Elleric Bigge
 confirmed this Donation, and it went then as it had done before by Assignation towards the supply of their Diet; And the Notitia of the particular Mannors belonging to 
Christ Christ
 in the 
Dooms-day
 Record speaks

thus; 
Litel Cert. iterum est Manerium Monachorum, & de Cibo eorum, quod in T. E. R. id est, Tempore Edwardi Regis se defendebat pro III Sullings, & nunc pro duo & dimidio & valet VIII
 
lb.
 The other half Sulling or Ploughland was at that time held by 
William Fitz-Herminfrid
 of the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury
 in Fee, and was called 
Pett.
 This Mannor was many Generations since given in Fee-Farm by Grant from the Monks of 
Christ Church
 to the 
Brockhulls,
 who transmitted it with 
Calehill
 to 
John Darell
 Esq; in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and under that Notion or Capacity it con∣tinued till the suppression, and then it was confirmed to Sir 
James Darell
 by King 
Henry
 the eighth in Fee-Ferm, there being a small Rent issuing out of it reserved to the Dean and Chapter of 
Christ Church,
 and under that Character is it now come down to Sir 
John Darell
 the instant Lord of the Fee.


Calehill
 is that eminent Mannor in 
Little Chart
 which gives Name to the whole Hundred, it was under the Scepter of 
Henry
 the third, the Inheritance of a good Fami∣ly called 
Frene,
 who (as appears by Seals and other Authentick Records of Armorie) bare for their paternal Coat 
Or
 a 
Flower de Lis
 within a plain Bordure 
Sables,
 in Allu∣fion and Assimulation to that 
Pluckly,
 of whom it is probable they held some Land in this Track, who bore 
Or
 only a 
Flower de Lis Sabler; Hugh de Frene
 in the first year of 
Ed.
 the first, obtained a Charter of Free Warren to his Mannor of 
Calehill
 and 
Stilley
 in 
Charing:
 But before the middle of 
Edw.
 the third, this Family was departed from the Possession of this place, having surrendred the Propriety of it, and 
Stilley
 in 
Charing
 to Sir 
Thomas Brockhull
 second Son of Sir 
William Brockhull,
 and he paid respective Aid for his Mannor of 
Calehill,
 and his Lands at 
Charing,
 at making the Black Prince Knight; 
Thomas Brockhull
 his Son was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the seventh and eighth years of 
Rich.
 the second, and held his Shrievalty at 
Calehill,
 and he had Issue 
Hen. Brockhull,
 who in the fourth year of 
Hen.
 the fourth conveyed 
Calehill
 to

 
John Darell
 Esq; younger Brother of 
Darell
 of 
Sesay
 and elder Brother to Sir 
Will. Darell
 under-Treasurer of 
England,
 which 
John
 was Steward of the Lands of 
Hen. Chichley
 Arch-B. of 
Cant.
 a place in those Times of a large Trust, and as eminent a Concernment, and in the twelfth year of the abovesaid Prince 
Hen. Brockhull
 mentioned before, passed away 
Stilley
 in 
Charing
 to 
John Darell
 a∣bovesaid, from whom it came over to his Successor 
James Darell,
 who by a Charter of Inspection in the third of 
Hen.
 the sixth, had the Franchise or Priviledge of Free War∣ren renewed to his Mannors of 
Calchill
 and 
Stilley
 in 
Charing,
 which was originally granted to 
Hugh de Frene: John Darell
 Esq; was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the seventh of 
Hen.
 the seventh, he was afterwards dignified with the Order of Knighthood, and was so eminent a Partisan of that Prince, that he had his Estate torn from him by

 
Richard
 the third for his Fidelity to his Cause and Quarrel, which,

 with thirteen other Man∣nors lying dispersed in the County of 
Worcester
 was granted to him again by 
Henry
 the seventh before mentioned, and was made Captain of the Lanciers for this part of the County wherein he lived. Sir 
James Darell
 was his Son and Heir, who was Governour of 
Guines
 and 
Hames
 Castle near 
Calais,
 Thus have I in prospect represented when 
Jo. Darell
 above mentioned originally extracted from the Knightly Family of the 
Darells
 of 
Sesay
 in 
York-shire,
 deserted that County, to transplant himself into 
Kent,
 and fix his residence at 
Little Chart,
 from whom Sir 
John Darell
 who now enjoys the Signory of 
Calehill,
 and Proprietie of 
Stilley
 in 
Charing,
 by a Derivation of many Descents (all of whom were very considerable in their Generations, as their Monuments and sepulchral Inscriptions remaining in their own Chappel of St. 
Katharines
 in 
Little Chert
 Church, do at this instant eminently manifest) is by a just and un-interrupted Series originally and lineally extracted


Burleigh
 is another Mannor, partly in this Parish, and partly in 
Charing,
 which had anciently Owners who bore that Sirname, and there is a place in 
Charing
 Church, which at this Day is known by the Name of 
Burleighs
 Chauntry, which is very pro∣bable was founded by them; after the 
Burleighs
 were extinguished and abstracted from the Possession of this place, which was about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the third, the 
St. Johns
 written in Sir 
John Darells
 Latin Deeds 
De Sancto Johanne,
 became Lords of the Fee; but long this Mannor was not refident in them, for before the end of 
Edward
 the third, this Family of 
St. John
 was crumbled into Decay and Oblivion, and having disloged from the Possession, a Family called 
Dalingryg
 of eminent Note in

Hantshire,
 were entituled by Purchase to the Proprtety of it, and Sir 
Edward Dalingryg
 by a Fine levyed the first year of 
Richard
 the first, passed it away to 
Roger Dalingryg,
 and 
Alice
 his Wife, and they not long after by the same Vicissitude conveyed their united Interest here to 
Brockhull
 of 
Cale hill,
 and 
Hen. Brockhull
 in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, transmitted it by Sale to 
John Darrell
 Esquire, and from him by the Chanel of sundry Descents is the Right now descended to Sir 
John Darrell,
 who hath the instant Fee-simple of it.


Chart Sutton
 sometimes called 
Chart Greene,
 is seated in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne;
 within the Confines of this Parish there is an ancient Mannor and Mansion called 
Norton place,
 it gave Name to as ancient a Family as any in this Track, in the South-Windows of the Church there was the Effigies of 
Stephen Norton,
 with his Arms on his Tabard or Surcoat, 
viz. Argent
 a 
Cheveron
 between three 
Crescents Azure,
 who flourished in King 
Richard
 the seconds Time; and in a Turnament of the 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, I find one of this Name in a Tabard of the Arms above mentioned, encountring one 
Christmasse
 of 
East Sutton
 not far distant, who was in like manner so habited in a Surcoat charged with his Arms, which meetly express the Owners name, 
viz. Gules
 upon a 
Bend Sables
 three 
Wassail Bowls Or,
 which likewise stand in the South∣Windows in 
Sutton
 Church. But the Effects of 
Gavelkind
 did at length grind this Family to a small Remain, so that in the Times which did almost border upon those our Fathers lived in, this Seat was by 
Norton
 sold to 
Baker,
 from whom by the same Fatality not long after it went away to Sir 
Edward Hales
 Grandfather to Sir 
Edward Hales
 Baronet, who is the present Proprietary of it. But though the Family be worn out at this place, yet from a Cadet of this Name, who did once possess 
Wierton
 in 
Boughton Quarry,
 now the Mansion of Sir 
Anthony St. Leger,
 did Sir 
Gregory Nor∣ton
 now of 
Sussex
 Knight and Baronet lately deceased originally sprout forth.


There is another place in this Parish called the Den of 
Ivetegh,
 which was anci∣ently the Inheritance of a Family who bore that Name, and though the Deeds now in the Hands of my Cozen Mr. 
Thomas Petley
 of 
Vilston,
 do discover the Possession to be resident in this Name, no higher then the Rule of 
Henry
 the fixth, yet it is probable, because the Name was local it was theirs long beyond that Time; from 
Ivetegh
 it came to 
Mascall,
 a Family whose Estate was formerly at 
Berming,
 and from this Name it was by Sale demised to 
Lambe,
 who some three descents since alienated his Interest in it to 
Perry,
 extracted from the 
Perrys
 of 
Worcestershire;
 but this Family lately de∣termining in Females, 
Elizabeth
 marryed to Mr. 
Thomas Petley
 of 
Vilston, Ann,
 and 
Mary,
 these three are the Vihble Coheits of that Estate which related to it.


Crayford
 in the Hundred of 
Little
 and 
Lesness
 contains diverse places in it of emi∣nent Consideration; fitst, 
Howbery,
 offers it self up to our View: It was in the Reign of 
Henry
 the third, and 
Edward,
 as appears by ancient Court Rolls and other Evidences, the Patrimony of the noble Family of 
Northwood,
 who held it for severall Descents in an uninterrupted Channel, untill the Reign of 
Richard
 the second, and then the Title and Propriety of it was by the Revolution of Sale transplanted into 
Abermill,
 but here the Possession was so cursory and transient, that before the end of 
Henry
 the fourth, it was surrendred to 
Nicholas Carew
 of 
Surrey,
 and 
John Cornwallis
 of 
London,
 who by joynt Concurrence in the fifth year of 
Henry
 the fifth conveyed it to 
Richard Bryan,
 and he in the first year of 
Henry
 the sixth passed it away to 
Roger Apylton,
 one of the Auditors to that Prince, and his Father 
Henry
 the fifth, and 
Agnes
 his Wife Widow of 
Thomas Coveley
 or 
Cowley,
 and the Reversion in Fee to her Son 
Thomas Cowley,
 which accordingly after her Decease descended to him, and from him it was transported by Descen to his Grandchild 
John Cowley,
 who in the twenty second year of 
Henry
 the eighth, alienated it to 
John Judde,
 whose Son 
Henry Judde
 about the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth
 resigned up the Possession by Sale to Sir 
Richard Fane;
 in whose Family after it had fixed untill that Age, which was within the Confines of our Fathers Remembrance, it was by Purchase made the Patrimony of 
Draper,
 and is still the Inheritance of Master ........ 
Draper
 now in his Minority.


Newbery
 is the second place of Account, which was in elder Times ennobled by

being parcell of that Inheritance which confessed the Dominion of 
St. John,
 and 
Edward St. John,
 as appears by the Records of this place, flourished here in the Reign of 
Edward
 the first, and 
Edward
 the second, and dying without Issue, left his Estate here to 
Isabell
 his Sister and Coheir, matched to 
Henry de Burgherst,
 and he in her Right dyed possest of it the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the third, as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 94. 
parte secunda.
 After this Family was crumbled away at this place, I find it folded up in the Demeasne of 
Poynings,
 the last of which who enjoyed it was 
Thomas Poynings,
 who about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, conveyed it to 
John Kingston
 Esquire, in which Family it made its aboad untill the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then I find it departed from this Name, and cast into the Possession of Sir 
Thomas Lisley,
 whose Descendant about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth
 conveyed it to 
Apylton
 of 
Marshalls Court
 in this Parish, where they had been resident many De∣scents before, and 
Roger Apylton
 gave this and 
Marshalls Court
 in Dower with his Daughter 
Frances,
 matched to Mr. 
Francis Goldsmith,
 who almost in our Remembrance passed away 
Newberry
 to 
Draper,
 Ancestor to Mr. 
Draper
 now Proprietary of it; but 
Marshalls Court
 was alienated to 
Pix,
 whose Descendant not many years since sold his Interest in it to Mrs. 
Touse
 of 
London,
 who hath setled it in Marriage on her Daughter matched to Collonel 
Wood
 of 
Kingston
 on 
Thames.


Ellam
 is the last place of Remark in 
Crayford,
 it gave Seat and Sirname to a good old Family, who for many Descents passed under the Notion and Estimate of Gentlemen, before they deserted the Possession of this Seat, and bore 
Argent
 a 
Sword
 in 
Bend Dexter Sables: Henry Ellam
 dyed 1471, and lyes entombed in 
Crayford
 Church; 
John Ellam
 deceased 1481, and had there likewise his place of Sepulture, both whose Monuments Time and a Casual Fire invading the Church, have misera∣bly dismanteled; the last of this Name who was possest of this place was 
John Ellam,
 who in the sixteenth year of 
Henry
 the seventh alienated it to 
Henry Harman,
 who was then Clerk of the Crown, in which Family it continued untill the latter end of King 
James;
 and then it was passed away with 
May Street,
 (which 
Henry Harman
 abovesaid purchased of 
Cowley
 and 
Bulbeck
 of 
Bubeck Street
 in this Parish, in the twentieth of 
Edward
 the fourth) to 
Draper,
 whose Descendant Mr....... 
Draper
 is entituled to the Interest of both these places.


The Arch Bishops of 
Canterbury
 had anciently some Concernment in 
Crayford,
 for as I find by Record 
William
 Arch Bishop of 
Canterbury
 in the twentieth of 
Richard
 the second, obtained the Grant of a Market to this place to be weekly observed on the Tuesday, and a Fair yearly on the Vigil, the Day of our Ladies Nativity, and four Dayes after.


Northcrey
 lies in the Hundred of 
Rokesley,
 and though an obscure Village in it self, yet is made eminent by containing within its Limits the Mannor of 
Rokesley,
 which contributes a name to the whole Hundred, it was as high as can by Record be traced, the Inheritance of 
Rokesley, Greogrie de Rokesley
 Lord Maior of 
London
 in the year 1275, which was in the third year of 
Edward
 the first, an eminent man in those times he was, for as by the Chartu∣laries of 
London
 it appears, he was Keeper of the Kings Exchange in 
London,
 and Say∣master Generall of the Kings Mint; nor was his Son of less reputation, for Sir 
Richard de Rokesley,
 so was he called, was Seneschal of 
Poictou,
 and Governour of 
Mon∣treul
 in 
Picardy
 about the latter end of 
Edward
 the first, but died without issue Male, and left 
Ioan
 his Daughter and Heir, who was matched to Sir 
Thomas de Poynings,
 Father of 
Richard
 Lord 
Poynings,
 and so 
Rokesley
 became the Inheritance of that Family: but 
Northcrey
 remained longer in 
Rokesley,
 for 
Roger de Rokesley
 a Cadet of this Family paid respective Aid for 
Northcrey
 in the twentyeth year of 
Edward
 the third, but it seems went out without Issue, so that 
Northcrey
 devolved to 
Poynings
 as the next of Alliance; for 
Richard
 Lord 
Poynings
 died seised of both these Mannors in the thirteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc.
 148. whose Sole Heir 
Elianor
 was married to 
Henry Piercy
 Earl of 
Northumberland,
 whose Successor 
Henry
 Earl of 
Northumberland
 in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of that Prince bequeathed by Testament these Mannors to the Crown, where they lay involved till the same Prince by Grant made them the Inheritance of Sir 
Roger Cholmeley,
 one of

his Judges, who not long after alienated them to Sir 
Martin Bowes,
 and he had Issue 
VVilliam Bowes,
 who concluded in two Daughters and Coheirs, 
Elizabeth
 married to Mr. 
VVilliam Buggin
 Esquire, and 
Ann
 married to Sir 
Bdmund Fowler,
 who shared his Patrimony, but 
Northcrey,
 and 
Rokesley
 upon the partition was annexed to the De∣measn of 
Buggin,
 from whom it is descended to Mr. 
William Buggin
 his Son, in whom the Possession is now resident.


Jackets Court
 in this Parish was a place which gave Seat and Sirname to Gentlemen of this Name: I have seen an old Roll of 
Kentish
 Arms, wherein 
Jacket
 of 
Jackets Court
 is recorded, but the Arms were of so antiquated an Aspect, that I could not distinguish neither the Colour nor Charge; from 
Jacket
 by Sale it went away to 
Switzer,
 a Name of signal Antiquity in this Track, though never under the repute of Gentlemen, one of which in the Reign of Q. 
Elizabeth
 conveyed it to 
Edmund Cook
 Esquire, whose Son Mr. 
Lambert Cook
 passed it away to Alderman 
Leman,
 and he surrendred his Right in it to 
Whiffen,
 by whose Daughter and Heir it is lately come to be the Inheritance of Mr. 
Thomas Bales
 Esquire, Barrister at Law.


Rokesley
 and 
Northcrey
 were formerly two distinct Parishes, till Cardinal 
Reginald Pole,
 when he visited 
Kent,
 which was in the year 1557, finding it convenient by rea∣son of their Situation, and the narrowness of the Demeasn, to lay them together, united them into one, so that 
Rokesley
 (the Church by disuse being languished into decay) hath been ever since esteemed an Appendage to 
Northerey.


Pauls Crey
 or 
Paulins Crey,
 lies in the Hundred of 
Rokesley,
 and gave Sirname to Sir 
Simon de Crey,
 who was Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in the third and fourth year of 
Edward
 the first, and afterwards in the twenty eighth year of that Princes Reign accompanied him in his victorious Expedition into 
Scotland,
 and is in the Register of those 
Kentish
 Cavaleirs who were embarqued in that successfull Design. After this Family was worn away, 
Champneys,
 a Name of celebrated Note in the County of 
Somerset,
 was Lord of the Fee, 
Hugh de Champneys
 is mentioned in the Book of 
Aid
 to have paid some respective supply for this Mannor at the making the Black Prince Knight in twentyeth year of 
Edward
 the third; and 
Champneys
 Field, so called at this day, which lies in Sir 
Thomas Walsinghams
 Park, and hath been for many Descents the 
Walsinghams,
 was belonging to this man; From 
Champneys
 it came down to 
Scroop,
 a Noble and Ancient Family extracted out of the North-Riding of 
Yorke
-shire; Sir 
Henry le Scroope
 died possest of it in the fifteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, and 
Thomas Scroope
 after him held it at his Decease, which was in the fifteenth year of 
Edward
 the fourth; after 
Scroope
 was gone out, I find 
Talbot,
 which was in the Reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, to be fixed in the Possession of this place, and is in some Deeds written 
Talbot
 of 
Grafton;
 by whose Daughter and Heir it devolved to 
Danbie,
 in the time of 
Henry
 the eighth, descended from the 
Danbies
 of 
Middleham
 Castle in 
Yorke
-shire; in which Family after the Possession for divers years had inhabited, it was about threescore years since sold away to Mr. 
James Smith
 of 
London,
 who deceasing without Issue Male, this by 
Mary
 his Sole heir is come to acknowledge Mr. 
Edward Waller
 of 
Beaconsfield
 Esquire for its instant Possessor.


Kitchin-Grove
 is a small Mannor in this Parish, which for many Ages since was the Demeasn of 
Ferby,
 written in ancient Deeds 
Ferbey;
 from whom sundry Descents since, it came by purchase to 
Heron,
 but was not of that continuance here as in the former Family; for after some fifty years Possession it was in the Reign of 
Henry
 the seventh alienated to 
Walsingham
 of 
Scadbury,
 Ancestor to Sir 
Thomas Walsingham,
 in whom the Proprietie of it is at this instant resident.


John Dynley
 had license here in the sixteenth year of 
Edward
 the third to build a Bridge over the River, leading to his Demeasn Land at 
Hockenden
 in this Parish, which with 
Walkelins
 hath been for above two hundred years the Inheritance of Sir 
Leonard Ferby
 and his Predecessors, 
Pat. Anno
 16. 
Edw. tertii Part. prima.


Votes-Crey
 in the Hundred of 
Rokesley,
 taketh that Denomination from one 
Vote,
 the owner thereof in the Conquerours time; in Ages of a more modern Descent, the 
Rokesleyes
 were Proprietaries of it, and 
Gregorie de Rokesley
 was seised of it at his death, which was in the twenty ninth year of 
Edward
 the first, and left it to his Son 
Roger de Rokesley,
 who by a fine levied in the thirty third year of the abovesaid Prince, passed it away to 
John Abel, Margerie
 his Wife, and 
Walter
 his Son, which 
Walter
 after









by the same Devolution translated his right in it to Sir 
Simon de Vaughan,
 who in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third paid respective Aid for it at the making the Black Prince Knight: Then this Mannor came to 
Warner,
 whose Successor 
John Warner
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the twentyeth year of 
Henry
 the sixth: and 'tis probable by some empaled Coats in the Church windows, that the Heir General of 
Vaughan
 was marri∣ed to 
Warner;
 but the two Statues upon an Altar-tomb in the Church, likewise (which the Injuries of Time and impious Sacriledge together, have almost demolished,) belonged to Sir 
Simon de Vaughan,
 and were when Mr. 
Robert Glover
 made his Collecti∣on of the 
Kentish
 Monuments, entire, after the Coheirs of 
Warner
 wedded to 
Jo. Herne
 and 
Denham
 divided his Inheritance at this place, and upon the partition, this accrued to 
Herne,
 and 
Christopher Herne
 Esquire in the twenty first year of 
Henry
 the eighth, passed it away to 
William Walsingham
 Esquire, who upon his decease gave it to his Son and heir Sir 
Francis VValsingham,
 principal Secretary of Estate to Q. 
Elizabeth,
 who about the middle of this Princesses Government alienated it to Mr. 
John Gelli∣brand
 from which Name and Family the possession is at this instant it came down to Mr. 
John Gellibrand
 of 
London.


Chellesfield
 in the Hundred of 
Rokesley,
 afforded in elder time both Seat and Sirname to a Family of principal Account, who obtained a Market to this their Mannor weekly on the 
Monday,
 and 
Simon de Chellesfield
 upon his Plea of prescription before the Judges Itinerant in the seventh year of 
Edward
 the first, had an Allowance of it, and 
William de Chelsfield
 had a Charter warren to his Lands in 
Chelsfield, Shoram, Nock∣holt,
 and 
Orpington,
 in the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the first; from 
Chelsfield
 it passed away to 
Otho
 Lord 
Grandison,
 who paid respective Aid for this Mannor by the sixth part of a Knights Fee, at the making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third: but there it had but a frail abode, for Sir 
Thomas de Grandison
 this mans Son, conveyed it over by Sale to 
Richard
 Lord 
Poynings,
 whose Daughter and Heir 
Eleanor
 matched to 
Henry Percy
 Earl of 
Northumberland;
 and in his Line was the Right of it for some Descents interwoven, till in the Reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, it was by Sale resigned up to 
James Walsingham
 Esquire, whose Son Sir 
Edmund Walsingham
 alienated it to 
Giles,
 in the Reign of 
Edward
 the sixth, which 
Giles
 descended from 
Giles
 of 
Lords
 in 
Shelvich,
 where for ma∣ny years before they had been planted; and from 
Giles,
 about the latter end of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 it came over by purchase to Captain 
Henry Lee
 of 
London,
 who going out in Sisters and Coheirs, it is now come by two of them to Serjeant 
John Clerk
 of 
Huntington
-shire, the principal Possessor, and Mr. 
Thomas Norton
 of 
London.


Ferneborough
 is but a Chappel of Ease, devoted to the honour of St. 
Giles,
 but be∣longs to the Mother-Church of 
Chelsfield,
 which is dedicated to St. 
James,
 as appears by the Records of the Church of 
Rochester:
 It was a principal Seat of the Lord 
Grandison,
 who made this the Head of their Barony; 
William de Grandison
 held it at his death, which was in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the third;

 
Otho
 Lord 
Grandison
 this mans Son, obtained a Charter of Free Warren to it in the eighteenth year of 
Edward
 the third; but long after this it did not remain linked to the Inheritance of this Family, for in the Reign of 
Richard
 the second, I find 
Fleming
 invested in the Possession, whose Tenure was very transitory; for not long after by Purchase it was brought into the Demeasn of 
Petley,
 from whom by as swift a Fatalitie it went away to 
Peche
 of 
Lullingston,
 which Family determined in Sir 
John Peche,
 in the Reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, who dying Issueless, 
Elizabeth
 his Sister and heir, brought this, and a spatious Inheritance to her husband 
John Hart
 Esquire, from whom M. 
William Hart
 now of 
Lullingston
 Esquire is lineally extracted; and in right of this Alliance is at this present entituled to the Possession and Signorie of 
Ferneborough.


There is a third Mannor in this Parish called 
Godington,
 which was anciently the Habitation of a Family which was represented to the world under that Name; 
Simon de Godington
 paid respective Aid for his Mannor of 
Godington
 at the making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third; (as the Book of 
Aid
 in∣forms us,) and after this Family expired at this place, 
Richard
 Lord 
Poynings
 became Lord of the Signorie of it, from whom with 
Eleanor
 his Daughter and Heir it went over to 
Henry Percy
 Earl of 
Northumberland,
 but did not long fix in that Family; for,

for almost two hundred years last past, the Possession hath been constantly united to the Name of 
Haddon,
 a Family of principal Account in this Track, as may appear by their Arms, 
viz. A Leg couped and wounded,
 which are Registered in the old Rolls and Ordinaries of 
Kentish
 Armorie, alwayes with this addition, 
Haddon
 of 
Kent,
 and sometimes of 
Godington
 in 
Kent.


Hewat
 is another small Mannor in 
Cheslfield,


 which was for many Descents the 
Petleys
 of 
Down
 originally, from whom it devolved to a Cadet of that Family, who planted himself at 
Moulsoe
 in this Parish, and there is a Deed in the hands of Mr. 
Thomas Petley
 of 
Vielston,
 of 
John Coldigate
 of 
Coldigate,
 a Farm in 
Halsted,
 which bears Date from the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the fourth; to which one 
William Petley
 of 
Chelsfield
 is 
Teste.
 After it had been resident for sundry Generations in this Branch of 
Petley,
 which sprouted out from those of 
Down
 the Title in that Age which ushered in this, was by Sale from 
Edward Petley
 transferred to Mr. 
Thomas Petley
 of 
Vilston
 in 
Shorham;
 another Branch shot out from the principal Stem of the 
Petleys
 at 
Down,
 and he left it to his second Son Mr. 
Ralph Petley
 of 
Riverhead
 in 
Sevenoke,
 not long since deceased, whose Heir (who is Proprietary of this place) is at this instant in his Minoritie.


Northsted
 is situated likewise in 
Chelsfield,
 and in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, confessed a Family called 
Francis
 for its Proprietaries; 
Simon Francis
 held it at his death, which was in the thirty second year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 33. and acquired it by Purchase of 
Otho de Grandison,
 who held this and 
Chelsfield,
 as appears by the Book of 
Aid,
 in the twentieth year of the former Prince; but about the be∣ginning of 
Henry
 the fourth, this Family had surrendred the possession of this Mannor to 
Vuedall
 or 
Udall
 a Noble Familie, and Masters of much Land both in 
Surrey, Sussex,
 and 
Hant-shire;
 Sir 
John de Vuedall
 was one of the Knights who was with 
Edward
 the first at the Siege of 
Carlaverock;
 Sir 
Peter D'Vuedall
 sat as Baron in Parliament the eighth and ninth of 
Edward
 the second; 
Nicholas Vuedall
 was Constable of 
Windsor
 under 
Edward
 the third, 
John Vuedall
 was Sheriff of 
Sussex
 and 
Surrey,
 the second, fourth, and seventh years of 
Henry
 the fifth; and again the first, fifth, and twelfth year of 
Henry
 the sixth; 
William Vuedall
 was Sheriff of 
Sussex,
 and 
Surrey,
 the eighth of 
Henry
 the sixth, and he in the sixth year of that Princes Govern∣ment conveyed it to 
John Shelley
 of 
Bexley,
 whose Successor 
William Shelley
 about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, passed it away to Mr. 
John Leonard
 of 
Chevening,
 whose great Grand-child 
Henry
 Lord 
Dacres
 not many years since conveyed it to the Lady 
Wolrich,
 who upon her decease setled it on her Kinsman Mr. ....... 
Skeggs,
 of the County of 
Huntington.


Chelsfield
 had a Market obtained by 
Otho de Grandison
 in the eighteenth year of 
Edw.
 the first, to be held there weekly on the 
Monday,
 and a Fair to be observed there yearly, by the space of three dayes at the Feast of Saint 
James.


Choriton
 in the Hundred of 
Folk-stone,
 was the Inheritance of an ancient Family called 
Scotton; Robert Scotton,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth years of 
Edward
 the first lived here, and held his Shrievalty at this place, and was of eminent Rank in this Track; for he was Lieutenant of 
Dover
 Castle under the Prince abovesaid, and held this Mannor under the Estimate of a whole Knights Fee of the Lord of 
Folkstone:
 But before the latter end of 
Edward
 the second, this Family had diserted the Possession of this place, and surrendered their Interest here to 
Va∣loigns;
 whose Time was very brief in the enjoyment of it; for 
Waretius de Valoigus
 dying without Issue Male, this Mannor accompanied his Daughter and Co-heir, and was upon the division of his Estate linked with much other Land to the Demeasn of her Husband Sir 
Thomas Fogge,
 who was Knight of the Shire for 
Kent
 several times under the Scepter of 
Edward
 the third, and 
Richard
 the second; Sir 
Francis Fogge
 another of this Family, lies entombed in 
Cheriton
 Church with his portraicture Cross-legged affixed to his Sepulchral Stone, which implies that he had obleiged himself by some vow to assert the Cross and Sepulchre of our Saviour; finally, after the Proprie∣tie of this place, had by the Current of many Descents flowed in this Family, it devolved to 
George Fogge
 Esquire, who about the latter end of Q. 
Elizabeth
 passed it away to Mr. 
Henry Brockman,
 Grand-father to Mr. 
James Brockman
 Esquire, the instant Lord of the Fee.




Enbroke
 is another Mannor in 
Cheriton,
 which in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third was the Patrimony of 
Peter de Alkam,
 and after his Descendants were Extingui∣shed at this place, it came by the ordinary fate of Purchase to 
Enbroke,
 who having erected a Mansion upon the Demeasn, it is probable adopted it into his own Sirname, and called it 
Enbroke; John de Enbroke
 held it in the twentieth year of 
Edw.
 the third, and paid an auxiliarie supply for it (as appears by the book of 
Aid
) at making the Black Prince Knight; 
Michael Enbroke
 was a great Benefactor to the Fabrick of 
Cho∣riton
 Church in the time of 
Rich.
 the second, and it is probable those antient Tombs yet visible related to these two, or some of this Family, the last of which was 
John Enbroke,
 who flourished here in the Reign of 
Henry
 the fourth; after whose departure it came to be enjoyed by 
Thorold
 or 
Torold,
 and 
Walter Torold
 conveyed it to 
Ni∣cholas Evering
 in the seventeenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, in which Family the Pos∣session was permanent and constant, until that Age which was circumscribed within our Grand-fathers remembrance, and then it was alienated to Mr. 
John Honywood
 of 
Elmsted,
 Ancestor to the instant Proprietary 
John Honywood
 of the same place Esquire.


The Tombs in the Church adorned with several Portraictures and Sculptures of Persons deceased, related to these two formerly recited Families, which the rude hand of Time hath crushed into the disorder of so great a Ruine, that now even the Monuments and Sepulchres themselves have found an enterment in their own Dust and Rubbish.


Godinton
 in 
Great Chart
 was an ancient Mansion of a Family of that Sirname,

 
Simon de Godinton
 lived here, as appears by very ancient Deeds, and so did 
Lucas de Godinton
 likewise; 
John de Godinton
 is portraied in Coat Armour in an ancient window in the North-Isle of the Church, having an aspect upon a Crucifix in the same Glass placed above him, accompanied with eleven others of eminent note in this Track depicted in the same posture with him; and this 
John
 had Issue 
William de Godinton,
 who flou∣rished here, as appears by his Deed in the fourth year of 
Richard
 the second, but before the beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth, had passed away his Interest here to 
Richard, Simon,
 and 
John Champneys,
 and they in the sixth year of the abovesaid Prince conveyed it to 
Thomas Goldwell,
 Son of 
William de Goldwell,
 and he determined in a Daughter and Heir called 
Agnes,
 who was affianced to 
Thomas Tooke
 of 
Bere,
 by whom he had Issue 
Ralph Tooke, Richard
 and 
John; Ralph
 went into 
Hertfordshire, Richard
 planted himself at 
Bere
 by 
Dover,
 and 
John Tooke
 by Donation from his Father was invested in 
Godinton,
 and continued ever since an eminent Seat of that Family, and is at present the resi∣dence of that worthy person Captain 
Nicholas Tooke,
 descended from

 
Sieur de Toque
 or 
Toc,
 who is recorded in the Rolls of those who entred 
England
 with 
William
 the Con∣queror, who hath so industriously and elegantly cultivated and improved our 
English
 Vines, that the wine pressed and extracted out of their Grapes seems not onely to pa∣ralell, but almost to out-rival that of 
France.


Court Wurthin
 is a place of good Account in 
Great Chart,
 which likewise afforded a residence to Possessors of that Sirname, 
William de Wurtin
 by his Deed without Date de∣mises Land which lay circumscribed within his Mannor of 
Wurtin,
 to 
Quikemanus de Bere; Henry de Wurtin
 is in the Register of those twelve eminent persons who are de∣picted kneeling in a Glass window in this Church; the last of this Name at this place was 
Thomas de Wurtin,
 who about the beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth passed it away to 
Thomas Goldwell,
 by whose Heir General it came with 
Godinton
 to 
Thomas Tooke
 of 
Bere,
 who setled it on his third Son Mr. 
John Tooke;
 from whom it is successively by Descent come down to my Noble Friend Captain 
Nicholas Tooke
 Esquire.


It is observable, that there is a Coat of Augmentation united to the Paternal Coat of this Family, which the 
Tookes
 of 
Godinton
 bear in the first quarter, 
viz. Argent upon a Cheveron between three Greyhounds-Heads crased, Sables, three Silver Plates,
 which was given to 
John Tooke
 by 
Henry
 the seventh, as a reward for his diligence in that Embassie in which he was employed by that Prince; the Plates were an Embleme of his Guerdon or Salary, and the Creyhounds-Heads a Symbol of his Celeritie.


Singleton
 is another eminent Mansion in this Parish, which had owners of that Sir∣name, and bore in ancient Armorials, as appears by their Deeds, 
Two Cheverons between three Martletts; Henry de Singleton
 is one of those twelve eminent Persons that are de∣picted kneeling in Coat Armour in a window in 
Great Chart
 Church, and 
John Singleton


this mans Successor was Justice of the Peace for this County in the Reign of 
Richard
 the second, and 
Henry
 the fourth, as appears by an old Roll of the Justices of those times collected by 
Thin:
 But after this mans 
Exit,
 the Title was not long wedded to this Family, for about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, I find the 
Edinghams
 or 
Enghams
 to be by Purchase entituled to the Possession, wh
 added much to the Lustre of the ancient Pile, by adorning its Fabrick with increase of Building, and contniued pro∣prietaries of it untill the beginning of King 
James;
 and then it was passed away by Sir 
Edward Engham,
 to 
Richard Brown
 Esquire, a Cadet or younger Branch of the 
Browns
 of 
Betsworth
 Castle in 
Surrey,
 from whom it descended to his Grandchild Mr. 
Richard Brown,
 who being very lately deceased, it is now in behalf of Dower, the Habita∣tion of his Widow Mrs. 
Elizabeth Brown,
 Daughter of Sir 
William Andrews
 of 
Lath∣bury
 in the County of 
Buckingham.


Nin-House
 shall not pass without some mention, because it was the residence of 
John at Nin,
 who is in the Register of those twelve Worthies who are pourtraied kneeling in Coat Armour in an ancient window in this Parish Church; whose posteritie enjoyed it untill the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was alienated to 
Sharpe,
 and 
Wil. Sharpe
 mingled with the Ashes of his five Wives (as the Inscription on his Se∣pulchral Stone instructs us) rests in the nethermost part of the South Isle of this Church, and as the Date endorsed on his Tombe informs us, deceased in the year of 
Grace
 1499. and from him did the Proprietie of this Mansion by the Devolution of sundry Descents come down to Mr........ 
Sharpe
 lately deceased, whose Heirs do still enjoy it.


Chevening
 in the Hundred of 
Codsheath,
 had owners of that Name, in times of higher Assent, who were of no dispicable account. 
Adam de Chevening
 was one of the grand Assise in the time of King 
John,
 and had his residence here, and likewise derived his Name from hence; and the heirs of 
William de Chevening
 paid respective Aid for the Mannor of 
Chevening
 by the half part of a Knights Fee, (which 
Adam de Chevening
 formerly held of the Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury
) in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight; when the 
Cheve∣nings
 went away from the Possession of this place, the Family of 
Delapole,
 who were Lords of the Mannor of 
Pool
 in 
Southfleet,
 were Seated in the Inheritance, for 
John de Lapole
 held it in the tenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth; but long after this did it not continue constant to this Name, for by Sale the whole Demise was put into the Tenure of 
Isley,
 and 
William Isley
 held it at his death, which was in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, 
Rot. Esc.
 34. and in the Demeasn of this Family was the Inheritance folded up, till Sir 
Henry Isley
 in the Reign of 
Edward
 the sixth fixed the Proprietie of it by Sale in 
John Lennard
 Esquire, who lies enterred in 
Chevening
 Church; in right of which original Grant, 
Francis
 now Lord 
Dacres
 his great Grand∣child is invested in the present Inheritance of it.


Chepsted
 in this Parish, was so called from the Market of Fish there long since used; for there such as imported fish from 
Rye
 on the Sea-Coast, thence called 
Rypers,
 made their Stage, and on fresh horses carried it to 
London.
 Just as 
Chepe-Side,
 and other places beginning with 
Chepe,
 give Addition and Distinction from other Towns of like Name where Markets are kept. That this Mannor had Proprietaries of this Name is evident, for 
John de Chepsted
 Son of 
Cohn de Chepsted
 paid respect of Aid for this Mannor which was held by Knights Service, of the Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight; the Heir of 
Chepsted
 (as appears by an old Pedigree in the hands of Sir 
Sackvil Crow
) was matched to 
John de Bore,
 and the Heir of 
Bore
 to 
Stockett,
 who passed away 
Chepsted
 about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, to 
William Isley
 Esquire, whose un∣happy Successor Sir 
Henry Isley
 being attainted in the time of Q. 
Mary,
 it eschea∣ted to the Crown, where it hath ever since been resident.


Morants Court
 lies in 
Chevening
 likewise, and contributed both Seat and Sirname to a Knightly Family who were Proprietaries of it. King 
Edward
 the second in the fourteenth year of his Reign granted Charter-warren to 
Jurdan,
 and 
William de Morant
 in all their Lands in 
Chevening, Shoram, Otfood, Brasted, Sundridge,
 and 
Chiding∣ston; William de Morant
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the twelfth and thirteenth year of 
Edw.
 the third, and had Issue Sir 
Thomas Morant,
 whose heir General brought this Seat to

Peckham,
 in which Family the Title lay couched till our Fathers Memory, and then it was demised to 
Blackswell,
 who some few years since hath by Deed and other Con∣veyance setled his Right in it on Mr. 
Watson
 of the County of 
Oxford.


Chiselhurst
 in the Hundred of 
Rokesley,
 hath several places within the confines of it, of signal Account. The first is 
Scadbery,
 which had Owners of that Sirname, which about the twentieth of 
Edward
 the third, were extinguished; for then 
John de Scadbery
 deceased without Issue male, so that this ancient Seat devolved to be the Patrimony of 
Osmund de Walsingham,
 descended from the Knightly Family of 
Wal∣singham
 in 
Norfolk,
 who matched with 
Ann
 his sole Daughter and Heir, and having planted himself in this County, he began to sprout out and flourish into a Series of such worthy Successors, that this Family was justly registred in the Catalogue of those who were esteemed the most ancient and eminent of this County, having in this latter Decursion of Time, been for six Descents Knights; which, that I may the better represent to the Reader, the Splendor of this Family I shall destinctly name; the first was Sir 
Thomas Walsingham,
 who was born the third year of 
Henry
 the fifth, and he had Issue Sir 
James Walsingham,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the seventh, whose Son and Heir was Sir 
Edmund Walsingham,
 who was Lieu∣tenant of the 
Tower
 twenty four years, and he had Issue Sir 
Tho.
 Kinsman to Sir 
Francis Walsingham
 the famous Secretary of Estate to Queen 
Elizabeth;
 Sir 
Thomas Walsingham
 was Son and Heir of Sir 
Thomas
 above mentioned, and he had Issue Sir 
Thomas Walsingham,
 who is the instant Proprietary of 
Scadbery.


Frogpool
 is another ancient Seat in this Parish, which in 
Henry
 the thirds Reign confessed the Signory of a Family called 
Barbur, Thomas le Barbur
 obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands in at 
Chiselhurst
 in the thirty eighth of the above named Prince. But before the latter end of 
Edward
 the second, this Family was moldered away, and then it came to be possest by a Family called 
Cressell,
 who were Lords of much Land about 
Hartley, Faukham,
 and other places in that Territory, and bore for their Coat Armour, as appears depicted in ancient Coloured Glasse in 
Chiselhurst
 Church, 
Sables A Fesse Argent
 between three 
Chaplets Or; John de Cressell
 in an old Survey of 
Rochester
 is remembred to have been a liberall Benefactor to this Church in the Reign of 
Edward
 the third, and from the Government of that Prince, does the Age of the above mentioned Coat seem to commence, and this is the Reason, why another 
John Cressell
 of this Family, is in the seventh year of 
Henry
 the fifth recorded in the Register of those, 
Qui portabant Arma antiqua.
 Finally, after the Propriety of this noted Mansion had continued so many Descents wrapped up in the Patrimo∣ny of this Family, it was about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth transmitted by Sale to 
Dyneley,
 and Sir 
John Dyneley
 in our Remembrance demised his Concernment in it to Mr. 
William Watkins,
 to whose Care and industrious Expence, the additional Building annexed to the ancient Structure, does owe its originall; and he having thus improved it, transmitted his Right in it by sale some few yeers since to Mr. 
Philip Warwick.


Chiddingston
 in the Hundred of 
Somerden
 hath the Addition of 
Cohbam,
 as being the Inheritance of the Lords 
Cobham
 of 
Sterborough
 Castle; 
Henry de Cobham
 had in the ninth year of King 
John
 a Charter for all his Lands in 
Kent,
 of which these at 
Chid∣dingston
 with the two little Mannors of 
Reynsley
 and 
Tihurst:
 In Ages of a lower Step, 
Reginald
 Lord 
Cobham,
 who was summoned to Parliament, as Lord 
Cobham,
 of 
Sterborough
 in the twenty second year of 
Edward
 the third, died possest of them in the thirty fifth year of that Prince, 
Parte prima Rot. Esc. Num.
 62. And here the Right continued, till in 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cobham
 this mans great Grandchild, the Male Line failed and resolved into 
Ann Cobham,
 who was matched to 
Edward Borough
 Lord of 
Gainsborough
 in the County of 
Lincoln,
 whose Grandchild 
Thomas
 Lord 
Borough,
 some fifty years since passed away his Right in 
Chiddingstone, Reynsley,
 and 
Tihurst,
 which had devolved to him by his Grandmother to 
Stretfield;
 whose Son deceasing without Issue Male, they became the Inheritance of four Daughters and Coheirs matched to 
Dillingham, Shetterden, Powell
 and 
Taylor,
 only 
Reynsley
 before his Death was sold to Mr. 
Christopher Knight,
 whose Heir does now possesse it.




Burwash
 Court in this Parish was the Patrimony of the Lords 
Burgherst,
 by vulgar Depravation of the Name, called 
Burwash; Stephen de Burwash
 had a Charter of Free-warren to all his Lands in 
Kent,
 in the first year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Robert de Burgherst
 or 
Burwarsh
 possest it at his Death, which was in the thirty third year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 41. and his Son 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Burwash
 in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third, by Deed passes away much of his Land in 
Warwick-shire,
 and 
Kent,
 to 
Walter de Paveley
 and 
Matilda
 his Wife, in which this lay involved; from 
Paveley
 it came down by Purchase to 
John de Bore, Trivet
 and 
Vaux
 whose Successors conveyed 
Burwash
 to 
John Alphew
 in the Reign of 
Henry
 the sixth; 
Alphews
 Coheirs were marryed to....... 
Brograve,
 and Sir 
Robert Read
 Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in the Time of 
Henry
 the seventh, who in his Wifes Right carried away 
Burwash
 as parcell of her Dower; but this man determining like∣wise in Daughters and Coheirs, 
Katharine
 one of them was wedded to Sir 
Thomas Willoughby,
 second Son to 
Christopher Willoughbie
 of 
Eresbie,
 which Sir 
Thomas
 was likewise Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, 
Eliza.
 was matched to Sir 
Tho. Totihurst,
 and a third was married to 
Th. Wotton
 Esquire; Sir 
Thomas Willoughbie
 Esquire, Son and Heir of Sir 
Tho.
 who joyned in a Fine with his two Uncles even now mentio∣ned, in the sixth year of 
Edw.
 the sixth, and so by a mutuall Concurrence with them, their united Concernment in 
Burwash
 was passed away to Mr. 
John
 and Mr. 
Robert Seyliard
 of 
Delaware;
 in whose Name and Revenue the Title and Propriety of this place hath ever since kept so permanent an Aboad, that it is still the Inheritance of Mr. 
John Seyliard
 now of 
Delaware
 Esquire.


Bore
 Place with the Mannor of 
Milbroke
 and 
Boresell,
 was formerly the Inheritance as high as 
Henry
 the third of a Family which assumed its Sirname from hence, and was called 
Bore,
 and likewise took in to his Arms a 
Bore
 for his Cognisance; in this Family the Right of these places successively dwelt, till 
John Bore
 in the Time of 
Henry
 the sixth transplanted his Interest in them by Sale into 
John Alphew,
 by whose Coheir they came over to her Husband Sir 
Robert Read,
 and from him they went away by 
Katha∣rine
 one of his Coheirs to Sir 
Thomas Willoughbie,
 whose great Grandchild 
Percivall Willoughbie,
 who having matched with 
Bridget,
 one of the four Coheirs of Sir 
Percival Willoughbie
 of 
Notinghamshire,
 devested himself of his Title to both these places, to improve his Interest in that County, and not many years since alienated them to Mr. 
Bernard Hide
 of 
London
 Esquire, one of the Commissioners of the Custome House to the late King 
Charles,
 whose Grandchild Mr. 
Bernard Hide
 is upon his Fathers late Decease now enterred into their Possession of 
Milbroke
 and 
Bore∣place:
 But 
Boresell
 now vulgarly called 
Bowsell,
 was sold to 
Edmund Thomas
 of 
Whitley
 neer 
Sevenoke,
 who is now in the enjoyment of it.


Chilham
 in the Hundred of 
Felborough,
 was by 
William
 the Conquerour, as the Pages of 
Doomsday
 Book instruct us, assigned to 
Fulbert de Dover
 under the Notion of a whole Knights Fee, for his Assistance and Association to 
John de Fiennes
 in the Guard of 
Dover
 Castle, which eminent employment thus imposed upon him, did induce him to wave his originall Sirname of 
Lucy,
 and assume one derived from his Office, yet 
Richard de Lucy
 this mans Son, did it seems take up again his primitive Sirname, for when King 
John
 by his Charter in the sixteenth year of his Reign, 
Cart.
 24. 
Num.
 37. restores to 
Rose de Dover,
 called in the Latin Record 
Rohesia,
 the Castle of 
Chilham
 with all its Appendages, he calls it there the Land which was her Grand∣father 
Richard de Lucy
's Inheritance: This 
Rose de Dover
 was sometimes written in old Deeds 
de Lucy,
 in Relation to which she sealed with three Pikes,

 she matched with 
Richard
 base Son to King 
John,
 by whom she had two Daughters and Coheirs, 
Lora
 married to 
William de Marmion,
 and 
Isabell
 espoused to 
David de Strabolgie
 Earl of 
Athol,
 who in her Right became Lord of the Castle and Mannor of 
Chilham,
 and transmitted it to his Son 
John
 Earl of 
Atholl,
 who for his frequent Acts of Hostility and Rebellion against 
Edward
 the first, in his Contest with the 
Scots,
 being by the Fate of War made Captive, was at 
Canterbury
 hanged on a Gibbet fifty Foot high, that he might be as eminent in his Punishment, as he was before conspicuous in his Crimes, and being cut down halfe alive, had his Head struck off, and his Trunk cast into the Fire, a Savage Manner of Punishment, and hardly heard of before amongst

us; upon his Shipwrack and Confiscation of Estate, it rested in the Demeasne of the Crown, till King 
Edward
 the second, in the fifth year of his Reign, as appears 
Parte prima Pat. Edwardi secundi,
 granted the Castle and Mannor of 
Chilham
 to 
Bar∣tholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 who quickly after lost it by his Perfidiousnesse and Disloyalty to that Prince, so that it returned to the Crown; and the abovesaid Prince, as is evident by 
Pat.
 15. 
&
 16. 
Edwardi secundi,
 restores the Castle and Mannor with all the Goods and Chattels in it, which belonged to 
Bartholomew Badelesmer,
 to 
David de Strabolgie,
 Grandchild to the first 
David,
 for Life only, which upon his Expiration was again united to the Royal Revenue, and in the third year of King 
Edward
 the thirds Government, it was by Patent granted to 
Bartholomew Badelesmer,
 Son to the abovesaid Lord 
Bartholomew;
 and he dying in the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the third, left it to his Son 
Giles Badelesmer,
 who deceased without Issue, and so his four Sisters became his Coheirs; one of which called 
Margaret,
 by matching with 
William
 Lord 
Roos
 of 
Hamlake,
 united the Castle and Mannor of 
Chilham,
 which accrued to her upon the Division of the Estate to his Revenue, from whom successively it did devolve by a continued Rivulet of Descent, to his Successor 
Thomas
 Lord 
Rosse,
 who asserting the Cause and Quarrel of the House of 
Lan∣caster,
 was in a Battle commenced between 
Edmund Beaufort
 Duke of 
Somerset,
 and 
John Nevill
 Marquesse 
Montacute
 made Captive to the Partisans of the House of 
York,
 and in the third year of 
Edward
 the fourth, sealed his Faith to that Cause which he contended for, with the Losse of his Head, which was struck off at 
Newcastle;
 but it seems the Mannor and Castle of 
Chilham,
 was before this untimely Fate of his, upon his being engaged in Armes with the Complices of the House of 
Lancaster,
 by 
Edward
 the fourth, in the first year of his Reign granted to Sir 
John Scott
 of 
Scotts Hall,
 one of his Privy Counsel, 
Pat. Anno pri. Edwardi quarti Parte
 4. 
Memb.
 24, but it was but for Life, for afterwards it returned to the Crown, and rested there till 
Henry
 the eighth by royal Concession planted the Propriety in Sir 
Thomas Cheyney,
 who inhabited here when 
Leland
 made his 
Kentish
 Perambulation, which was in the Beginning of the Reign of that Prince, from whom it came down to his Son 
Henry,
 created Baron 
Cheyney
 by Queen 
Elizabeth,
 who having by Riot and Profusion and other exorbitant Ex∣cesses, wasted a noble and plentifull Patrimony, in the tenth year of that Queens Government, alienated the Mannor and Castle of 
Chilham
 to Sir 
Thomas Kempe,
 whose Son Sir 
Thomas Kempe
 concluded in four Daughters and Coheirs, 
Dorothy
 married to Sir 
John Cutts, Ann
 matched to Sir 
Thomas Chichley, Amy
 wedded to Sir 
Henry Skipwith,
 and 
Mary
 espoused to Sir 
Dudley Diggs,
 who being con∣cerned in this Estate, the three first by a joynt Concurrence, passed away their Right to Sir 
Dudley Diggs
 and his Lady, who was Master of the Rolls in the year 1636, and a great Assertor of his Countryes Liberty in the worst of times, when the Sluces of Prerogative were opened, and the Banks of the Law were almost overwhelmed with the Innundations of it; from whom it is descended to his Son Mr. ...... 
Diggs
 Esquire, in whom the Propriety and Interest of this Mannor and Castle does still continue.


Easture
 in this Parish, was the Seat of a Family which was known by that Sirname, and in several ancient Deeds, which are not bounded or limited with any Date, there is mention of 
John de Easture,
 who lived here in the Reign of 
Henry
 the third and 
Edward
 the first; after this Name was vanished, the 
Apul∣derfields
 of 
Otterpley
 in 
Challock,
 a younger Branch of the 
Apulderfields
 of 
Bed∣mancore,
 were invested in the Possession; and of this Family was 
Henry de Apulder∣field,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the fifty first year of 
Edward
 third, and likewise Proprietary of this place; but when this Family resolved into a Daughter and Heir called 
Isabell,
 she by matching with 
John Idelegh,
 who had a large Income about 
Mepham, Chalk,
 and 
Cobham,
 cast it into the Inheritance of that Family, where it had not long remained, but a Vicissitude like the former carryed it by 
Agnes
 the Female Heir of 
William Idelegh
 to 
Christopher Ellenden,
 who was Master of a good Estate about 
Seasalter
 and 
Damian Bleane,
 which Name not many years after shrunk into a Daughter and Heir likewise called 
Mary,
 descended from 
Thomas Ellenden,
 who was about the Reign of 
Henry
 the seventh matched to

Edward Thwaits,
 so that in her right that Family became setled in the Inheritance of this place, and remained in the Possession, till in that Age we stile our Grandfathers, it was by Sale translated into 
Morton,
 descended from the ancient Family of the 
Mortons
 of 
Millbourn St. Andrews
 in the County of 
Dorset,
 whose Successor Mr. 
George Morton
 not many years since passed away his Interest in it by Sale to his Uncle 
John Finch
 Baron of 
Fordwich,
 and Lord Keeper of the great Seal in the year 1640.


Youngs
 is another Mannor in 
Chilham,
 which by Deeds of a very high gradation in time, which step into the Reign of 
Edward
 the second, appears to be the Possession of a Family of that Appellation; and when that was decayed and worn out at this Place, the 
Beverleys
 who were a Family which had been planted at 
Tancrey
 Island in 
Fordwich
 ever since the latter end of the Reign of 
Edward
 the third were ingraffed in the Inheritance, and continued by an undissolved Chain of several Ages seated in the Proprietie of it, till 
George Beverley
 the last of this Name at this place in our Grandfathers Remembrance, demised his right in it by Sale to 
George Barley,
 where the Title found no long abode, for he passed away his Interest to 
Fleet,
 extracted from the 
Fleets
 of 
Fleet
 in the Isle of 
Thanet,
 who suddenly after alienated it to 
Shepheard,
 from which Family almost in our Remembrance it was by Purchase brought over to own the Signorie of Sir 
Dudley Diggs,
 who upon his decease transmitted it to his eldest Son Mt. ....... 
Diggs
 Esquire, in whom the present Proprietie of it is fixed.


Dane Court
 is a fourth Mannor within the Limits of 
Chilham,
 not to be waved or declined in this present Survey: It was anciently the Patrimony of 
Thomas de Gar∣winton
 of 
Welle
 in 
Littlebourne,
 and he held it, as appears by ancient Court Rolls, in the Reign of 
Edward
 the first, and 
Edward
 the second, whose great Grandchild 
William Garwinton
 of 
Welle
 in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the fourth, dying without Issue, upon a serious debate and winnowing of Collateral Alliances, 
Joan
 Wife of 
Richard Haute
 was found to be his Cousin and Heir, and so this place became in her Right the Inhe∣ritance of this Family; but this mans Son called 
Richard,
 likewise not long after decea∣sing without Issue male, 
Margerie
 his only Daughter, who was matched to 
Will. Izaack,
 about the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, became his Heir, and so it fell under the Jurisdiction of that Name, and remained entwined with their Demeasn, till it about the beginning of the Government of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 was by 
Edward Izaack
 sold to 
Hales;
 from which Family in that Age our Fathers lived in, by the same conveyance it went away to 
Spracklin,
 issued out from the 
Spracklins
 of St. 
Lawrence
 in 
Thanet,
 in which Name the Possession is at this instant resident.


There is a place in this Parish on the South-side of the River stretched out on a long green Hill, which the Common People (who bear the greatest sway in corrupting of Names) call 
Jelliberies
 Grave. The Historie it self will evidence the original of this de∣nomination. It was about this place that 
Julius Caesar
 respited his farther remove or ad∣vance into the bowels of this Island, upon intelligence received that his Fleet riding in the road at 
Lymen
 not far distant, had been much afflicted and shattered by a Tem∣pest; whereupon he returned, and left his Army for ten dayes, encamped upon the brow of this Hill, till he had new careen'd and rigg'd his Navy; but in his march from hence was so vigoriously encountered by the 
Britons,
 that he lost with many others 
Leberius Durus
 Tribune and Marshal of the Field, whose Obsequies being performed with solemnities answerable to the eminence of his Place, and Command, each Souldier as was then Customary, bringing a certain quantity of earth to improve his place of Sepulture into more note then ordinarie, caused it so much to exceed the proportion of others elswhere; and from hence it assumed the name of 
Julaber,
 whom other vulgar heads, ignorant of the truth of the story, have fancied to have been a Giant, and others of them have dreamed to have been some Enchanter or Witch.


It is probable the 
Romanes
 built something here at 
Chilham,
 for when Sir 
Dudly Diggs
 digged down the ruines of the old Castle, to make space for the foundation of that exact and elegant House which he there erected, there was the Basis of a more ancient building discovered, and many Aeconomical vessels of the 
Romane
 antique mode traced out in that place, besides the Keeper of the Castle, which is yet preserved, hath a Senate-House adorned and furnished with Seats round about, shaped out of an excellent durable Stone.




Oldwives Leas
 is the last place in the Inventorie of those Mannors which lie with∣in the Limits of 
Chilham.
 It was in elder Orthographie written 
Old-woods Leas,
 as being indeed the Patrimony of a Family so called, as appears both by Deeds without Date, and of a more modern Constitution, and continued Lords of it untill the Reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then the Daughter and Heir Generall of 
John Oldwood
 annexed it to the Inheritance of 
Paine,
 in which Family it was without any pause or interruption resident almost untill our Fathers memory, and then this Name was entombed in four Daughters and Coheirs; two of which by the first Wife were matched to 
Cob,
 and 
Philipot
 of 
Feversham,
 and the two other which were the Issue by the second Wife were espoused to 
Petit
 and 
Prude;
 but this upon the division of the Estate into porti∣ons augmented the Revenue of 
Cob,
 and is still for ought I know wraped up in the Demeasn of the Heirs and Descendants of this Family.


Chilham
 by the influence and procurement of 
Alexander de Balioll,
 and 
Isabell
 his wife had the grant of a Market to be held weekly on the 
Tuesday,
 and a Fair yearly by the space of three dayes, 
viz.
 the Vigil, the day of the Assumption of our Lady, and the day after in the ninteenth year of 
Edward
 the first, which grant was renewed and confirmed to 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer
 in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the second, as appears 
Pat.

Chillenden
 in the Hundred of 
Eastry,
 gave Sirname to a Family so stiled, and there is a recital in Deeds very ancient, which extract their Original from the time of 
Henry
 the third, of 
John de Chillenden, Edward
 and 
William de Chillenden,
 who had an Interest in this place in Ages of a lower step; the 
Bakers
 who were Lords of 
Caldham
 by 
Capell,
 were in the Possession of this place, and after they were gone out, the Family of 
Hunt
 about the Government of 
Henry
 the sixth by Purchase were setled in the Inheritance; and here the Title for two or three Descents was Successively permanent, and then the same inconstant Revolution which carried it to 
Hunt,
 wafted it over from that Name by Sale to 
Gason,
 which Family I find to be of no despiscable Antiquitie about 
Ickham
 and that Track; and when it had for some years been linked to their Revenue, it was for some two or three Ages since alienated to 
Hamon,
 Ancestor to 
Anthony Hamon
 Esquire, into whom by original Descent, the hereditarie Right of this place is at this present collected.


Chistlet
 in the Hundred of 
Whilstaple,
 was given to the Sea of 
Canterbury,
 by 
Ethelbert
 King of 
Kent,
 under the notion of 
Cistelet;
 and here the Arch-Bishops of 
Canterbury
 erected a Magnificent Mansion which they called 
Ford;
 and empaled a certain proportion of Land into the form of a Park, as if they had judged it meet to justifie the first Donation of this Christian Prince, who by election and design intended it for a chosen portion of Earth, devoted to the support of this Arch-Bishoprick.


Clive
 formerly 
Cloves-Hoo,
 lies in the Hundred of 
Shamell,
 called so from its situ∣ation either on some elevated precipice, or else its being cloven or rent in some part of it, from the Continent by water. It was in the Conquerours time called 
Bishops-Clive;
 and in the Pages of 
Doomsday
 Book it is thus ra∣ted, 
Cliva est Manerium Monachorum, & est de vestitu eorum & in T. E. R. se defendebat pro II. Sullings & Dimidio & est appretiatum XVI.
 However the place at present may be represented obscure and despiscable, being shrunk from its former Glory, yet in those Ages wherein the 
Saxons
 flourished, it was ennobled with several Synods which were held here, both National and Provincial, wherein several Rules and Constitutions were enacted and established both to fetter up the Exorbitances of of the Clergie within the Channels and shores of the Ordinances and Decretals Ecclesiastical, and likewise to empale the Irregularities of the Laity, who then began to be debauched into disorder and excess, within the restraints and boundaries of the Laws temporal: I shall now exactly unweave them as they are Registred by the learned 
Spelman
 in his exact Collection of the Councels held before the Conquest: The first was held in the year 742. under King 
Ethelbald,
 and Arch-Bishop 
Cuthbert.
 The second under 
Ethelbald
 King of 
Mercia,
 accompanied with the principal of his Nobilitie, and Arch-Bishop 
Cuthbert
 invested with his Bishops, Abbots, and other

Ecclesiastical Persons, in the year 747. The third was celebrated under Arch-Bishop 
Athelard
 in the year 798. The fourth Synod or Councell was convened at this place under 
Kenulf
 King of 
Mercians,
 and 
Athelard
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury
 in in the year 800. The fifth was called together under the abovesaid King 
Kenulf,
 and Arch-Bishop 
Athelard,
 in the year 803. The sixth was assembled in the third year of 
Bernulfe
 King of the 
Mercia,
 in the year 822. that Prince himself with 
Ʋlfred
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 being both present and president at it and over it: The result of this eminent Synod was to rescue and restore to the Patrimony of the Church-Lands called 
Haerghes, Hereforddinglond, Gedding
 and 
Combe;
 which by the Sacrilegious violence of some impious men, even in those times had been ravished away from the Ecclesiastical Demeasn. Their eighth and last was a small Synodal Convention collect∣ed into a Body under the above mentioned King 
Bernulf,
 and Arch-Bishop 
Ulfred,
 in the year of 
Grace,
 824. And it is observable, that in these Assemblies, and in other Recor∣ded by Sir 
Henry Spelman;
 either the King immediately, or else some 
Thane,
 (which was a Dignity equivalent to our 
English
 Baron;) who did Personate the Prince, was joyntly President with the Bishop; that as one took Cognisance of the Affaires of the Church, so the other managed the Concernments and Interest of the State; and this was done with much of Reason and Prudence in the original Constitution of these Synods, for the mingling the divided Interests of the Laitie, and Clergie together; and making them mutually to interfere, extinguished all jealousie and Emulation be∣tween them, and by consequence all those black effects and inconveniences, which are still the Retinue to those two Furies; for we cannot be so Citizens of the Common∣wealth, but we must be Sons of the Church; nor so Sons of the Church, (the Tempo∣rall and Spirituall Interest are so complicated together) but we must in some relation be Citizens of the Common-wealth; and what causeth annoyance to the one, creates disturbance to the other; for like 
Hippocrates
 Twins they laugh and mourn, and live and die together: But to proceed, when this Mannor had for many Ages been in∣corporated with the Inheritance of the Church, 
Henry
 the eighth judging the Clergie grown too Luxuriant in a wide Revenue, prun'd off this, and 
Malingden
 a Mannor which was ever an Appendage to 
Cliffe,
 as two superfluous Excrescencies; and engraffed them again in the Royall Demeasn; but suddenly after, 
Cliff
 was by this Prince granted to 
George Brooke
 Lord 
Cobham,
 and he left it to his Son Sir 
William Brooke
 Lord 
Cobham,
 who enstated it by entaile on his second Son 
George Brooke,
 and in Defailance of Issue male, by him surviving, to the next Heir male of the Name; after this man was beheaded at 
Winchester,
 in the second year of King 
James,
 this devolved to his Son Sir 
William Brooke,
 who dying without Issue male, in the year 1643. Sir 
Jo. Brooke
 now Lord 
Cobham
 became his Heir.


Malingden
 was by Queen 
Elizabeth
 granted to 
William Ewens,
 who quickly after this Concession, transferred his Interest in it by Sale to 
Brown,
 from whom by as sudden a Decursion the Title by Purchase went in to 
Sompner,
 who (in Times which almost attaque our Remembrance,) sold it away to 
Hills.


Perry Court
 in 
Cliffe,
 was always a Limb of the Revenue of the Family of 
Cobham,
 and so for many Hundred years continued, till 
Henry Brooke
 Lord 
Cobham
 being wound up in that fatal and mysterious Design of the noble but infortunate Sir 
Walter Rawleigh,
 in the Time of King 
James,
 forfeited this to the Crown; but this Seat was by the above∣said Prince, after the Death of 
Frances
 Widow to the abovesaid 
Henry
 Lord 
Brook,
 granted to 
Robert Cecill
 Earl of 
Salisbury
 in Reversion, who married 
Elizabeth Brook
 this Lords Sister, and his Son 
Will.
 Earl of 
Salisbury
 Knight of the Garter, and Captain of the Band of Pentioners to his late Majesty, passed it away by Sale to 
Bernard Hide
 of 
London
 Esq; whose Grandchild Mr. 
Bernard Hide
 does enjoy the present Fee-simple of it.


Cardans
 is the last Mannor in 
Cliffe,
 which (untill the publique Dissolution tore it off, (belonged to the 
Charter-House
 in 
London;
 and being thus ravished away, was by 
Henry
 the eighth in the thirty first year of his Reign, granted to 
Thomas Gethins;
 from which Family not many years since, it passed away by Sale to 
Oliver Leder,
 and was lately, if it be not still, in the Tenure and Possession of that Name.


West-Clive
 vulgarly called 
West-Cliff,
 in the Hundred of 
Bewsborough,
 was the Patrimonial Inheritance of the Lord 
Cobham
 of 
Sterborough:
 Castle in 
Surrey,


a younger Branch of the Lord 
Cobham
 of 
Cobham, Reginald de Cobham
 second Son of 
John de Cobham
 was summoned to Parliament as Baron of 
Ster∣borough
 in the twenty second year of 
Edward
 the third, and dyed pos∣sest of this Mannor, and much other Land in 
Kent
 and 
Surrey,
 in the forty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 15. and so it remained interwoven for some Descents with the Demeasne of this Family, till 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cobham
 this mans great Grandchild resolved into 
Ann Cobham,
 who was his Female Heir, who by being espoused to 
Edward Borough
 Lord 
Gainsborough,
 linked this to his Demeasne and Propriety; but it was unloosned in 
Thomas
 Lord 
Borough
 this Mans Grandchild, who in the Reign of Queen 
Elizabeth
 alienated his Interest in it to 
Guibon,
 whose Grandchild Mr 
Thomas Guibon
 is invested in the instant Possession of it.


Bere Court
 or 
Mannor
 in this Parish, was formerly a parcell of the Demeasne of a Family who in times more ancient fell under this Denomination, 
Williant de Bere
 was Bailiff of 
Dover,
 and was to account the profits to the Constable of 
Dover
 Castle, 
Anno secundo Edwardi primi, Memb.
 19. 
& Anno quarto Edwardi primi, Memb.
 34. After this Family had waved the Possession of this place, the 
Tookes
 were setled in the Inheritance, and by a Decursion of many Ages, have brought down the Inheri∣tance to Mr. 
Charles Tooke
 who is the instant Possessor of 
Bere.


Cobham
 in the Hundred of 
Shamell,
 afforded a Seat and Sirname to that noble and splendid Family,

 who from hence borrowed the originall Denomination of 
Cobham,
 and certainly this place was the Cradle or Seminary of Persons, who in elder times were invested in Places of as signall and principall a Trust or Eminence, as they could move in, in the narrow Orbe of a particular County; 
Henry de Cobham
 was one of the 
Recognitores magnae Assisae
 in the first year of K. 
John,
 who were in some proportion equivalent to the Judges Itinerant, for they took Cognisance of all Causes Criminal, declared to be so by the Laws then in force, and likewise determined in sundry Actions of a meer Civill Aspect, either Reall, Personal, or Mixt; 
Reginald de Cobham
 Son of 
John de Cobham,
 was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 from the Beginning of the thirty third year of 
Henry
 the third, to the end of the fortieth year of the said Prince, and was again Sheriff in the forty second year of the above mentioned Prince, in which year he dyed, and 
Roger de Northwood
 and his other Executors, answered for the Remainder of the year; Sir 
Henry de Cobham
 was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 the twenty ninth, thirtieth and part of the thirty first year of 
Edward
 the first, he is written in the old Rolls of the Arms of the Knights of 
Kent, Henry Cobham le Ʋncle,
 that is, he was Uncle to the Lord 
Cobham;
 he lies buried in 
Shorne
 Church, with his Portraicture, armed in Mail and Crosselegg'd, with a Barons Robes cast over; but whether he were ever actually engaged in the Defence of the Crosse and Sepulchre of Christ against the Assaults of Infidels, is incertain; for it was customary in those times, if they did but vow to undertake the protection of the Crosse in the Christian Quarrel, to insculpe their Figures upon their Sepulchres armed and Crosselegged: This abovesaid Sir 
Henry de Cobham
 was again Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the first and ninth years of 
Edward
 the second; 
Stephen de Cobham
 Son and Heir of this Sir 
Henry,
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the eighth, ninth, and tenth years of 
Edward
 the third; 
Tho. de Cobham
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the first year of 
Richard
 the second; 
John de Cobham
 was one of the Conservators of the Peace in this County, in the third, fifth, sixth, ninth, twelfth, and eighteenth years of 
Edward
 the third, a place of no small Consequence in that Age, the end of it being to appease Tumults, regulate and bridle the Disorders and Excesses of all Irregular Persons, whether Felons, Outlaws, or other Malefactors, of what Complexion soever; and lastly, to secure the Peace of the County from all Eruptions, either inbred or forraign: This man had Issue 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cobham,
 Father to 
John
 Lord 
Cobham,
 in whom the male Line determined, so that 
Joan
 became his Daughter and Heir, who was first matched to 
John Delapole,
 secondly to Sir 
John Ouldcastle,
 by whom she had only a Daughter that died an Infant, and thirdly to 
Reginald Braybrook,
 who dyed as (appears by the Inscription on his Tombe) in 
Cobham
 Church, in the year

1433, and by him she had only 
Joan
 who was Heir to them both, and she by being wedded to 
Thomas Brook
 of the County of 
Somerset
 Esquire, knitt 
Cobham
 and a large Income besides, to her Husbands Patrimony. And this man had Issue by her, Sir 
Edmund Broke,
 who was summoned to Parliament as Baron of 
Cobham,
 in the twenty third year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and he was, in the direct Line, An∣cestor to 
Henry Broke
 Lord 
Cobham,
 Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in the first year of King 
James,
 who being too deeply concerned in the Design of Sir 
Walter Rawleigh
 which was as some, (who pretend to unravell it in the whole Webb, by private Collusion and Treaty with 
Count Aremberg
 the Spanish Legat, to draw over some Forces from 
Flanders,
 by whose powerfull Concurrence they might engage this Nation in the Flame of Civill Contention, since from that they expected their Light, though others wrap it up in so many Vails and Umbrages that the whole Scene of this Attempt becomes perplexed and mysterious,) made the forfeiture of his Estate here at 
Cobham,
 though not his Life, become the price of his undertaking, which being thus rent away by this Escheat from the Patri∣mony of this Family, was soon after, by King 
James,
 invested by Grant in his Kinsman 
Lodowick Stuart
 Duke of 
Lenox,
 who expiring without Issue, it did successively devolve to his Nephew 
James
 Duke of 
Lenox;
 upon whose late De∣cease, it is come over to ....... his Dutchesse Dowager only Daughter to 
George Villiers
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 in whom the blood of those three noble Families, 
Villiers, Manours,
 and 
Beaumont,
 appears to be concentered.


Cobham
-Colledge was founded by 
John,
 Baron 
Cobham
 of 
Cobham,
 in year 1362 for a Master and Chaplains to pray for the Souls of him, his Ancestors, and Successors.


Cobham-Bury
 lyes likewise in this Parish, and was always esteemed as an ap∣pendant Mannor to 
Cobham,
 having originally and successively the same Proprie∣taries: and being found wrapped up in the Patrimony of the infortunate 
Henry
 Lord 
Cobham,
 it escheated upon his Attainder to the Crown; and was suddenly after, by King 
James,
 granted to 
Robert
 Earl of 
Salisbury,
 whose Son and Heir the right honorable 
Robert Cecill
 Earl of 
Salisbury,
 some few years since transferred his Right in it by Sale to one 
Zachary King,
 of 
Watford
 in the County of 
Hertford.


Henherst
 is the last place of note in 
Cobham
 which, as the Records in 
Rochester
 inform me, was given to the Priory of 
Leed;
 Castle by 
Robert de Crevequer
 upon his Foundation of that Cloister, and continued folded up in its Revenue, until the Whirlwind of the generall Suppression rent it off, and King 
Henry
 the eighth granted it to 
George
 Lord 
Cobham,
 who immediately after conveyed it to Sir 
George Harpur
 Esquire, whose Son Sir 
Edward Harpur
 about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 passed away his Concernment here to Mr. 
Thomas Wright;
 from whom it descended to his Son and Heir 
George Wright
 Esquire, who, dying with∣out Issue, gave it to his Kinsman Sir 
George Wright,
 and his Son not many years since surrendered it by Sale to Doctor 
Obert,
 Physitian to the late Queen 
Mary.


The Tythes of this Mannor were given by one 
Goscelinus
 (as the first Book of of 
Compositions
 at 
Rochester
 discovers to me) in the year 1091, to the Priory of St. 
Andrews
 in that City, which upon the Suppression were by King 
Henry
 the eighth, granted to 
George Brook
 Lord 
Cobham,
 which upon the Attainder of his infortunate Grandchild, 
Henry
 Lord 
Cobham,
 in the second year of King 
James,
 returned to the Crown: and here the Propriety made its aboad, untill the late King 
Charles,
 by his royal Concession, made them the Inheritance of Mr. 
Stephen Alcock
 of 
Rochester,
 Esquire.


Cobham
 had the Grant of a Market weekly on the Monday, and a Fair yearly on the Day of St 
Mary Magdalen,
 procured to be observed there at those stated times abovesaid, by 
John
 Lord 
Cobham
 in the forty first year of 
Edward
 the third.


Because I have mentioned before, and shall have frequent occasion to mention hereafter those Kentish Gentlemen who were embarqued with 
Edward
 the first in his victorious and triumphant Expedition into 
Scotland,
 and were dignified with the order of Knighthood for their Assistance given to that Prince, in his succes∣full and auspicious Siege of 
Carlaverock,
 in the twenty eighth year of his Reign;

I shall represent to the Reader a List which I have collected from an Authentick Roll, gleaned from very ancient Registers and other Records, by that eminent Antiquary 
Robert Glover

Coldred
 in the Hundred of 
Eastrie,
 was a Branch of that Estate which related

to the Fraternity of the 
Maison de Dien
 in 
Dover,
 to which in the fourteenth year of S. the first they obtained a Charter of Free warren which was looked upon in that Age as a pri∣viledge of vast extent and circumference; upon the Dissolution in the reign of 
Hen.
 the eighth, it was by royal Concession from that Prince, added to the Demeasn of 
Rich. Monins
 Esq; great Grandfather to Sir 
Edw. Monins
 Baroner to whose Signory and Jurisdiction the propriety of this place at this instant submits it self.


Popshall
 in this Parish was anciently wrapt up in the Demeasn of 
Orlanston
 of 
Orlanston. William de Orlanston
 held it, as appears by an Escheat-roll marked with the number 86, in the reign of 
Hen.
 the third, and transmitted it to his Son 
Will. de Orlan∣ston,
 who in the fifty first year of the above-mentioned Prince, obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at 
Orlanston,
 and 
Pophall
 from him it descended to 
Will. de Orlanston,
 who had Issue 
Jo. de Orlarston,
 who held it in possession at his Decease, which was in the forty sixth year of 
Edw.
 the third, and had Issue 
VVill. Orlanston
 who by Sale transplanted the Interest of this place into 
Rich. Berham;
 in which Family after the Title had for some Generations been resident, a Vicissitude of the same Resemblance with the former, cast it into the possession of 
Horne
 branched out from the 
Hornes
 of 
Horns-place
 in 
Apuldore,
 who after some years investiture in the propriety of 
Popshall,
 determined in a Daughter and Heir, who was espoused to 
John Diggs
 from whom in a direct Line Sir 
Dudley Diggs
 of 
Chilham-castle
 was extracted, who alienated his right in this place to Sir 
Will. Monins
 Knight and Baronet, whose Son Sir 
Edw. Monins
 Baronet, enjoys the instant Fee-simple of it.


Coldham
 in the Hundred of 
Rockesley,
 is in the Pages of 
Doomsday
 Book written 
Caudham:
 which denotes the bleak and chil situation of it; In the twentieth year of 
VVill.
 the Conquerour, it was parcel of the Demeasn of 
Gilbert de Magninot,
 being involved in those Knights Fees which were assigned to him to be assistant to 
Jo. de Fiennes
 in the de∣fence of 
Dover-castle.
 And in this Name after it had some three Descents been lodged, this Mannor went away about the beginning of K. 
Stephen
 to 
VVill. de Say,
 with the Daughter and Heir of this Family. 
VVill. de Say
 this Mans Son, is in the Front or Van of that register, which comprehends the Names of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen who were embarked in the holy Quarrel with 
Rich.
 the first at the Siege of 
Acon. Geffrey de Say
 was one of the 
Recognitores magnae Assisae
 in the second year of K. 
Jo.
 the Nature of which office, and the Latitude of its Authority, I rust and Concernment; I have before unsol∣ded at 
Cobham.

 Geffrey de Say
 was with 
Edw.
 the first at the Siege of 
Carlaverock
 in the twenty eighth year of his reign, and for his noted Actings there, was honoured by that Prince with Knighthood, and dyed possest of this Mannor in the fifteenth year of 
Edw.
 the second, and had the repute of a Baron at his Decease, as had all his Successors like∣wise, holding 
Birling Couldham,
 and other places by that Tenure, which is styled 
per Baroniam. Geffrey de Say
 had view of Frank-pledge here in the eighth year of 
Edw.
 the third, and was engaged with that Prince, in the thirteenth of his reign, in his trium∣phant Designs upon 
France.
 Sir 
VVill. Say
 was his Son and Heir, who went out from his Tabernacle of humane frailty in the forty third year of 
Edw.
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 43. and bequeathed his Estate here at 
Coldham
 to 
Geffrey de Say
 his only Son surviving, who going out in two Daughters and Coheirs, 
Joan
 one of them was matched to Sir 
VVill. Fiennes,
 from whom descended 
Ja. Fiennes
 his second Son, who was summoned to Par∣liament at 
Bury
 as Baron 
Say
 and 
Seale
 the first of 
March,
 in the twenty fifth year of the abovesaid Prince, and

 
Rich. Fiennes
 eldest Son, who matched with 
Joan
 Sole Heir of 
Tho. Dacres,
 eldest Son of 
Tho.
 Lord 
Dacres
 of 
Hurstmonseaux,
 who had this Mannor by Descent from his Father; from whom in a continued Series it came down to 
Gregory Fiennes
 Lord 
Dacres,
 who in the thirty sixth year of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 dyed without Issue; and so 
Sampson Lenard
 Esquire, by marrying with 
Margaret
 his Sister and Heir became Heir to 
Coldham,
 and a large Inheritance besides, and his Son 
Hen. Lenard
 in the reign of K. 
James,
 was created Baron 
Dacres,
 from whom 
Francis Lenard
 now Lord 
Dacres,
 and proprietary of this Mannor is lineally extracted.


The Mannor of 
Apulderfield
 by contraction now called 
Apurfield
 lies in the precincts of this Parish, which was long time possest by Gentlemen that took their Sirname from thence, and branched numerously into divers parts of this Shire; 
Hen. de Apul∣derfield
 in the thirty eighth of 
Hen.
 the third, obtained a grant of a Fair and Market to his Mannor of 
Apulderfield.
 In the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Iohn de Insu∣la


had a Charter of Free-warren granted to his Mannor of 
Apulderfield,
 which was re∣newed to 
Stephen de Ashway
 in the thirty eighth of 
Edward
 the third, who had a free Chappel annexed to it; and in this Family of 
Ashway
 did the Title of this place for many Generations settle, till at last the common vicissitude of Purchase made it the Demeasn of 
Denny,
 from whom it came over by the same Alienation to 
Fiennes,
 and is now in right of 
Margaret Fiennes,
 Sister to 
Gregory
 Lord 
Dacres,
 matched to 
Sampson Lenard,
 devolved to his great Grandchild 
Francis Lenard
 the present Lord 
Dacre.


The 
Hamlet
 of 
Bettred,
 is the last place considerable in 
Coldham
 or 
Coudham;
 It was in elder times the Inheritance of 
Richard de Cherfholt,
 who was discharged of Reve∣ship by 
Jeffrey de Say,
 in the fifteenth year of 
Edw.
 the second, which Lord it seems bore a particular affection to this place: for in the seventh year of 
Edw.
 the third he brings a pleading for a yearly Fair to be kept at this 
Hamlet,
 on the day of St. 
Laurence,
 that is, on the tenth day of 
August,
 which was allowed by 
Jo. de Stonar,
 then one of the Ju∣stices 
Itinerant:
 But to go on, this above-mentioned 
Ric.
 dying without Issue-male, his Daughter and Heir who was matched to 
William de Manning,
 knit it to the possession of this Family: he dyed the seventeenth year of 
Edw.
 the third, and was Son of 
Stephen de Manning,
 of whom there is mention in old Deeds which have an Aspect upon the third, fourteenth, eighteenth, and twenty third years of 
Edward
 the first, and he was descended of 
Simon de Manning,
 to whom 
John Silvester
 of 
Westerham
 demises Land by Deed in the fourteenth year of 
Rich.
 the first, and who (as an old Pedigree which relates to this Family, doth record) was engaged in the 
Holy War,
 in defence of the Cross and Sepulcher of our Saviour, against the 
Saracens
 and Infidels under 
Rich.
 the first, and from this 
Simon de Manning,
 Mr. 
Sam. Manning
 now of 
London,
 and Mr. 
Edw. Manning
 of 
Kevington
 are by successive Right derived to them by many Descents, ori∣ginally and lineally extracted.


Cosmus-Damianus-Bleane
 lies in the Hundred of 
Whitstaple,
 and contains three pla∣ces within the Boundaries of it, which may fall under a Survey. The first is 
Well-court,
 which was anciently parcel of that Estate which did own the Family of 
at Leeze
 for its Possessors. Sir 
Richard at Leeze
 dyed possest of it in the year 1394. but going out without Issue, 
Marcellus at Leeze
 was his Brother and Heir, who concluded in two Daughters and Coheirs, 
Lucy
 first married to 
Jo. Norton,
 and after to 
Will. Langley
 of 
Knolton
 in 
Kent,
 by both which she had Issue; and 
Cicily
 wedded to 
Valentine Barret
 of 
Perry-court:
 but 
Norton
 and 
Langley
 as Heirs to the eldest Daughter, shared the Estate here at 
Well-court;
 and for many years did their Interest remain thus interwoven, till is the eleventh year of 
H.
 the eighth, 
Tho.
 Son of 
Jo. Langley,
 releaseth all his right in this place to his Kinsman Sir 
Jo. Norton,
 and he in the third year of 
Edw.
 the sixth, passes away his Concernment in it by Sale to 
Tho. Green,
 whose Successors 
George
 and 
Tho. Green,
 in the seventh year of K. 
James,
 alienated it by mutual Concurrence to 
Jo. Best,
 in whose posterity the title and propriety is at this instant resident.


The second is 
Lambert
 Lands a Mannor which is couched partly within the Limits of 
Hernhill,
 and partly within the Verge of this Parish; It was in elder times an Appen∣dage to the revenue of 
Feversham
 Abby: but when the storm of Suppression, which hap∣pened in the Government of the reign of 
H.
 the eighth, had ravished it away from the patrimony of the Church, and lodged it in the Crown, it was by that Prince in the thirty sixth year of his reign granted to 
Tho. Arden;
 but it seems it was but for Life, for after he was Barbarously assassinated by his Wife, and her inhumane Complices in the reign of 
Edw.
 the sixth, and left no Issue; that Prince granted it to Sir 
Henry Crispe
 of 
Quckes,
 in whose posterity the title was permanent, till that Age our Fathers lived in, and then it was alienated to Sir 
Jo. Huett
 of the County of 
Darby,
 who is yet the pro∣prietary of it.


Hoad-court
 is, and always was, part of the Demeasn of 
East-bridge
 Hospital, holding of the Master thereof. 
East-bridge,
 was formerly an Inn, for poor devout Pilgrims, who came to offer up their Visits and Orizons to the shrine of 
Tho. Becket,
 after the demolishing of which, in the reign of 
H.
 the eighth, this Hospital sprang up out of its Luines, and in the reign of Q. 
Eliz.
 Dr...... 
Lawes
 being then Master of 
East-bridge
 Hospital, it was granted for three lives to

 Sir 
Jo. Bois,
 a person of an exemplary and regular life, as appears by his diffusive Charity, for he founded 
Jesus
 Hospital in the Subburbs of 
North-gate
 at 
Cant.
 which he furnished with eight Brothers four Sisters

and a Warden, all very plentifully provided for; he died without issue, and left his estate here to his Nephew Mr. 
Tho. Bois,
 who erected for him a magnificent tomb in the Nave or body of 
Christ-church,
 which the assaults of impious and savage hands have demolished and utterly defaced; but though this Monument be thus crushed into un∣comely ruines, yet he hath transmitted his Fame to posterity, which, whenall the gandy and pompous Trophies of Art languish and shrink into their own Ashes, shall stand (both Brass to his Tomb and Marble to his Stone): But to proceed, from Mr. 
Thomas Bois
 abovementioned, is the propriety of this Mannor devolved to his Grandchild 
Jo. Bois
 Esq; a person who for his ingenious and candid Love to Literature may be justly said to be worthy of better times, but fit for these; that is, though his Merit should have been calculated for the best of days, yet it is made more eminent by his support of Learning in the worst.


Cowden
 in the Hundreds of 
Somerden
 and 
Westerham,
 did anciently with its revenue, support the Colledge of 
Lingfield
 in 
Surry,
 till the publique dissolution came and tore it off, and then it was by 
H.
 the eighth granted to 
H.
 Earl of 
Arundel,
 from whom it sud∣denly after devolved by sale to 
Wiskenden,
 whose Grandchild not many years since decea∣sing, left it divided between his two Sons, one of which hath lately alienated his Moi∣ety to 
Ashdown,
 though the other proportion still continues in the Name of 
Wickenden.


The 
Moat
 is an eminent Seat in 
Cowden,
 which for many Generations confessed the Signory of a Family called 
Cosin
 or 
Cosins,
 as is evident from several Deeds of certain parcels of Land which relate to this Mansion, as the capital messuage which were con∣veyed, some by Sale, some by resignation, from one 
Cosin
 to another. Whence this Fa∣mily was originally extracted, I cannot collect, because the evidences of this place (from which I am to borrow my Intelligence) extend no higher then this Family, yet it is probable their first Cradle was in 
Norfolk,
 where in elder times they were eminent: for in the sixteenth year of 
E.
 the second, I find one 
Jo. Cosin
 obtained License by pa∣rent to found a Chantry at 
Norwich,
 as appears 
Pat. Anno
 16. 
E.

Parte secunda Memb.
 4. but whether this Family seated here were derived from him immediately or not, is incertain. Sure I am, that after they had for many Descents been planted here, about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, it began to crumble away; for in the thirty second year of that Prince, 
William Cosin
 by Deed passed it away to 
William Hextall, William Gainsford
 and 
Nicholas Gainsford,
 in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the fourth; 
Hextall
 surrenders all his Interest here to 
William Gainsford
 Esquire, so he is written in the Deed, and from him did it descend to 
Nicholas Gainsford,
 whom I find to be Justice of the Peace for 
Sussex
 and 
Kent
 in the reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, and from him is that Family successively branched out, who are the instant proprietaries of this place.


Waystrode
 is another obscure Mannor in this Parish, which was the possession of as obscure a Family, wich bore that Sirname, who continued Lords of the Fee; untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was passed away to 
May,
 in which Name it had not been permanent untill the latter end of that Prince, but the same re∣volution conveyed it into the possession of a Family whose Sirname was 
Still,
 in whose Successors the title hath remained so constant, that the Inheritance of this place is at this instant resident in this Name and Family.


Cowling
 in the Hundred of 
Shamell,
 had still the Barons 
Cobham,
 of 
Cobham
) of whom I have discoursed so largely at that place) for possessors and came down along with them to 
John
 Lord 
Cobham,
 who expired in 
Joan Cobham
 his Daughter and Heir, who was first espoused to 
John Delapole,
 secondly to Sir 
John Oldcastle,
 who for asser∣ting the Doctrine of the 
Lollards,
 notwithstanding his many great Atchievements in Military Commands, which rendered him gracious with his Prince, and glorious in our Chronicles, he was in the first year of 
Henry
 the fifth, quite subverted by a Romish Tempest raised by the Ecclesiasticks of those Times, and martyr'd in a most inhumane manner, by hanging him first, and burning his Body also; third∣ly, she was matched to 
Reginald Braybrook,
 by whom she had only 
Joan
 her Daughter and Heir, who was wedded to 
Thomas Brook
 of the County of 
Somer∣set
 Esquire; from whom descended 
William
 Lord 
Brook
 Lord Warden of the Cinque

ports in the reign of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 who gave this Mannor to 
George Brooke
 his second Son; and he being unhappily entangled in that mysterious Design of his Brother 
Henry
 Lord 
Cobham,
 and Sir 
VValter Ramleigh,
 by the Losse of his Head at 
VVinchester,
 did expiate this unhappy undertaking; but this being setled by entail and in Marriage also upon his Son, who was in this latter Age known by the Name of Sir 
VVilliam Brook,
 was by King 
James
 restored to this person then in his Minority, upon whose Decease it descended to Sir 
Iohn Brook
 as the Heir male of the Family, who was created Lord 
Brook,
 by the late King at 
Oxford.


Cowling
 Castle was erected by 
Iohn
 Lord 
Cobham
 by Concession from 
Richard
 the second, as appears 
Pat.
 4. 
Richardi secundi;
 which grant of his in the whole Tenor of it, he caused to be inscribed in a large Table of Stone upon the Front of the Castle: so careful was he to conform to the Laws of the Land, which had a particular Aspect upon private embattelling, a Species of Fortification, prohibited 
si facta fuerit sine Licen∣tia Domini Regis.


The Mannor of 
Mortimers
 in this Parish, was the patrimony of Gentlemen of that Sirname. 
Hugh de Mortimer
 who had a Grant of a Fair to 
Cliff
 in the forty first year of 
Henry
 the third, was possessor of this place; In Ages of a lower des∣cent, 
Iohn Mortimer
 (who in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the third, was to pro∣vide an Hobler or Light Horseman, for the security of the Coast about 
Genlade
 in 
Hoo
) lived at this place, which had long before born the Name of his Ancestors; After this Family had left it, the 
Inglefields
 a noble Family in 
Barkesshire,
 descen∣ded from

 
Hasculfus de Inglefield,
 who flourished about the latter end of King 
Canutus,
 were by purchase ingraffed in the possession; and here in this Name did the Title setle, till about the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then it was alienated to 
Iohn Sidley
 Esq; Auditor to that Prince; from 
Sidley
 it went over by purchase to 
Pol∣hill,
 Ancestor to 
George Polhill
 Esq; eldest Son of Sir 
Thomas Polhill,
 who is the present possessor of it.


Crundall
 in the Hundred of 
VVye,
 was one of the Seats of the noble and an∣cient Family of 
Hadloe,
 who had here a Mansion which at this day perpetuates their memory, and is called 
Hadloe
 place; 
Iohn de Hadloe
 had a Charter of Free∣warren to 
Crundall
 and 
Hadloe,
 in the first year of 
Edward
 the third; he was son to 
Iohn de Hadloe,
 who dyed seised of it in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 25. Of this Family was 
Nicholas Hadloe
 son of 
Edmund de Hadloe
 who ended in 
Amabilia Hadloe
 who matched with 
Honewood
 of 
Honewood
 in 
Postling:
 but 
Crundall
 and 
Hadloe,
 were sold away before to 
VVaretius de Valoigns,
 by whose Daughter and Coheir they came over to 
Th
mas de Aldon,
 and in that Name they continued several descents, until the former Fatality brought it to languish into a Fe∣male Heir, who was wedded to 
Heron
 of the County of 
Lincolne,
 who desirous to draw all his estate into an entire Bulke, passed away his estate here to 
Kempe;
 and there it had no long continuance neither, for by 
Mary
 one of the Coheirs of Sir 
Thomas Kempe,
 it went away to Sir 
Dudley Diggs,
 who suddenly after devested himself of his right to 
Crundall
 and 
Hadloe-place,
 and in our Fathers memory passed them away by Sale to Mr......
Gay.


Tremworth
 in this parish,

 was one of the ancient Mansions of 
Valoigns. Allan de Valoigns
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the thirty first, thirty second, thirty third, and thirty fourth years of 
Henry
 the second, had his Residence here as well as at 
Repton
 in 
Ashford,
 and is often written in the pipe-Rolls of those years 
Valoigns de Tremworth;
 from this man did descend 
VVaretius de Valoigns,
 who in the four∣teenth year of 
Edward
 the third, obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at 
Tremworth, Hougham,
 and other places in 
Kent,
 and in whom the male Line failed, for he concluded in two Daughters and Coheirs, one of whom was matched to 
Aldon,
 and so 
Tremworth
 came to own the Jurisdiction and Dominion of that Family; and here it remained for divers Descents, till Time, that with successive Vicissitudes rolles all things into their determined period, brought this Family to find its Tomb in a Female Heir, who was married to 
Heron;
 from which Family about the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, it passed away by Sale to 
Kempe,


of which Family was Sir 
Thomas Kempe,
 who dying without Issue male, left it to his Brother Mr. 
Reginald Kempe;
 and he had Issue 
Thomas Kempe,
 who deceasing with∣out Children, this 
Thomas
 his two Sisters married to 
Clark
 and 
Denny,
 became his heirs, and upon the Division of the Estate 
Tremworth
 was cast into the Revenue of 
Denny,
 by whose Daughter and Heir it is lately become the Demeasn of Mr. 
Robert Filmer,
 second Son of Sir 
Robert Filmer
 of 
Sutton,
 not long since deceased.


Winchcombe
 is an ancient Seat likewise in 
Crundall,
 which ever since the Reign of 
Edward
 the second, hath acknowledged the 
Carters
 (as appears by private Evidences) for its uninterrupted Proprietaries, and is still in the Tenure and possession of that Name and Family.


Cuckston
 anciently written 
Cuckleston,
 lies in the Hundred of 
Totlingtrough,
 and was given to the Church of 
Rochester
 by 
Ethelwolfe
 Son of King 
Egbert,


 first Monarch of the 
English Saxons;
 this King 
Ethelwolfe
 after his decease, which happened to be about the year 857. was (for his several and exemplary acts of Charitie and pious Munifi∣cence towards the Church, of which 
Cuckston
 till these unhappy times ravished it away, stood a visible Monument) Recorded in the Register of Saints.


VVhornes-Place
 in this Parish was erected by Sir 
VVilliam VVhorne,
 who was Lord Maior of 
London
 in the year 1487. upon which (though he setled his Name) he could not so fasten it to his Family, but that the next Age by Purchase brought it over to 
Vane,
 where the Title had not long fixt, but the vicissitude of Sale alienated it to 
Barnewell,
 who about the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth
 sold it to 
Nicholas Lewson
 of the County of 
Stafford
 Esq; whose Grandchild Sir 
Richard Lewson
 desirous to settle himself in his own County, where a vaste Estate lay spread, which had been trans∣mitted to him from his Ancestors, passed away this by Sale to 
John Marsham
 Esquire, originally extracted from the 
Marshams
 of 
Norfolk,
 where many years before they had flourished under no contemptible Estimate.






D. D. D. D.


DArent
 in the Hundred of 
Acstane,
 is very often written 
North-Darent,
 it belonged in the Conquerours time to the Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 as the Record cal∣led 
Doomsday
 Book instructs me) and was exchanged for the Mannor of 
Lambeth
 by 
Hubert Walter
 Arch-Bishop, Lord Chancellor, and Lord Chief Justice, with 
Gilbert Glanvill
 Bishop of 
Rochester,
 in the year of our Lord, 197. which exchange was afterwards confirmed by 
Richard
 the first.


Saint 
Margaret-Hills
 now united to this Parish, had formerly a Church, which being decayed, and the Congregation diminished, it was by Cardinall 
Pole
 in the year 1557. incorporated into 
Darent.
 It was anciently, and is so still, distinguished by the Name St. 
Margaret-Hills,
 which additionall Character it borrowed from a Family originally called 
Hells,
 and then by Tradition and Vulgar corruption after∣wards stiled 
Hills;
 a Family which had large Possessions both here at 
Dertford,
 and at 
Ash
 likewise by 
Sandwich; John de Hells
 had a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannors of 
Hells
 and his Estate at 
Dertford,
 in the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the first; and from this 
John de Hells
 did Sir 
Edmund Hills
 descend; and he about the be∣ginning of 
Edward
 the sixth, alienated this Mannor to 
Lane,
 whose Son 
Henry Lane
 went out in a Daughter and Heir called 
Martha,
 who matched to 
Edw. Rolt,
 descend∣ed from the 
Roults
 of 
Bedford-shire;
 in Right of which Alliance Mr. 
Thomas Rolt
 his Grandchild, is now invested in the Possession of this Place.


Dartford
 gives name to that Hundred wherein it is situated, and before the Foundation of the Nunnerie, was a Mannor which was wrapt up in the Demeasne of the Crown; there was a Family called 
Tingewike,
 which had it in Lease, for when King 
Edward
 the third, 
Pat. An. primi Edw. tertii Memb.
 6. granted the Royalties of

the Mannor of 
Dartford,
 to 
Edmund
 of 
Woodstock
 Earl of 
Kent,
 paying, as a Rent-Service, of 30. l. 
per annum,
 it is mentioned in the Patent that he should hold them all in as ample a manner as 
Alice Tingewike
 formerly had done, upon his decease, it reverts to the Crown, and the same King 
Edward
 in the year 1355. and in the fiftieth year of his Reign, erects here a Nunnerie, whose Lady-Abbess and the Nuns of the Covent were for the most part, in succeeding times, elected into this Cloister out of the noblest Families of the Nation. Upon the suppression, King 
Henry
 the eighth converted the House into a Palace for his own habitation, and under that notion it continued, till K. 
James
 by exchange passed it away to 
Robert
 E. of 
Salisbury,
 who con∣veyed it to Sir 
Edw. Darcy,
 whose Grandchild, 
Edward Darcy
 Esquire, descended from the noble Family of 
Darcy
 of 
Yorke-shire,
 at this instant possesses the Fee-Simple of it.


The Mannor of 
Temple
 in this Parish, was involved in that Revenue, which was marshal'd under the Jurisdiction of the Knights 
Templers,
 as the very Name doth seem to insinuate, and upon the totall disannulling this order here in 
England,
 was, by a Statute made in the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the second, setled on the Knights of St. 
John
 of 
Jerusalem,
 where it was fixed and constant, untill the disbanding of that Order likewise in this Nation by King 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was an∣nexed to the Patrimony of the Crown; and rested there, untill K. 
James
 exchanged it, with 
Robert,
 E. of 
Salisbury,
 who sold it to 
Edw. Darcy
 Esq; whose Grandchild 
Edw. Darcy
 Esq; hath lately conveyed it by Sale, to his Brother in Law Mr. 
Will. Gough.


The Mannor of 
Charles
 is Seated in this Parish, and was a Branch of that Estate which fell under the Signorie of the ancient Family of 
Charles,
 from whom it assumed its ap∣pellation. Of this Family was 
Edw. Charles,
 who was Captain and Admiral of the 
Fleet,
 from the 
Thames
-Mouth North-ward, as appears 
Pat.
 34. 
Edw.
 1. after this Family had left the Possession of this place which was about the beginning of 
Richard
 the second; 
Nicholas de Brember
 was planted in the Proprietie: but he was scarce warm in his new atchieved Purchase, but he fell under the guilt of high Treason, only for being too fast in his Loyaltie and Faith to his Prince, and too loose in his fidelity to his Country, for there it seems that blind distinction had its first rise and growth which like some Alem∣beck distil'd and dropped the Power of the King distinguished apart from his Person, upon the forfeiture of his Life and Estate together, which was in the tenth year of 
Rich.
 the second: It was by that Prince suddenly after conveyed by grant to 
Adam Bamme
 Lord Maior of 
London:
 in which Family after it had for many Ages been seated, (it was as appears by an exemplification now in the hands of Mr. 
Took
 of 
Dartford
) transmit∣ted by Sale to 
Death,
 who about the latter end of K. 
James
 passed it away to 
Goldsmith
 of 
Marshals-Court
 in 
Creyford;
 who some few years since sold all his Concernment in it to Mr. 
Tooks,
 branched out from the ancient Family of the 
Tooks
 of 
Bere
 in 
West-Clive;
 though, since this Name setled at 
Dartford,
 it hath by Depravation been called 
Tuke.


Horsemans-Place
 is a Mansion of good account likewise in 
Dartford;
 in the six∣teenth year of 
Edward
 the second, I find it owned one 
Thomas de Luda
 for Proprieta∣rie, between whom and 
Thomas de Sandwich
 Abbot of 
Lessnes,
 there was a Composi∣tion about that time touching the passage of a Current of Water. But this Family before the end of 
Edward
 the third, had deserted the Possession; and then (by old Court-Rolls and other Evidences) I find it in the Tenure of 
John Horsman,
 who, it is probable new built this Mansion, and on the old Foundation established this new-Name; and he had Issue 
Thomas Horseman,
 who about the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, dying without Issue, gave it to his Widow 
Margaret Horseman,
 re-married to 
Shardelow,
 and she, upon her decease, in the ninteenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, be∣queathed it to her Kinsman 
Thomas Brown,
 whose Daughter and Sole Heir 
Katherine,
 annexed it to the Patrimony of 
Robert Blague,
 one of the Barons of the Exchequer, and he had Issue by her 
Barnabie Blague,
 who in the thirty third of 
Henry
 the eighth conveyed it by Sale to Mr. 
John Bere,
 who much adorned and augmented the ancient Shell or Structure of this Seat in the thirtieth year of that Princes Reign; but left his Acquists thus increased and improved to 
Ann
 his Sole Heir matched to Mr. 
Christo∣pher Twislton,
 descended from 
Twislton
 Castle in the County of 
Lancaster,
 whose Suc∣cessor Sir 
Jo. Twislton,
 Knight, and Baronet, is now by descendant, Right Possessor of it.


At Stanpit,
 in this Parish, there was a Chappell founded by one 
Thomas de Dertford


and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, for one Priest to celebrate divine Offices for the Soul of the Founder. In this Parish, there was likewise a perpetual Salary established by one 
Thomas Martin
 to pray for the Soul of the Founder, and Light-lands which were given by 
John Grovehurst.


Denton
 in the Hundred of 
Shamell,
 was given to the Church of 
Rochester
 by a Noble man called 
Brichric
 and 
Efswith
 his Wife: but it seems there had been some Invasion made upon the Original grant; for (as the Book called 
Textus Roffensis
 informs me) it was restored to that Cathedral by 
William
 the Conquerour, and was in after-times when 
Henry
 the eighth, upon the Ruines of the Priory of St. 
Andrews
 raised the Dean and Chapter of 
Rochester,
 by royal Concession united to their Demeasn.


Denton
 in the Hundred of 
Eastry
 with the appendant Mannor of 
Tapington,
 now by Contraction called 
Tapton,
 were in Times of very ancient Inscription, both cou∣ched in the patrimony of 
Yerd;
 and though several datelesse Deeds represent this Fa∣mily to have been possessors of both these places, as high as the reign of K. 
Jo.
 and 
H.
 the third: yet the first of this Name, whom Record discovers to us, to have been e∣minent, was 
John de Yerd
 who held the Mannors of 
Denton
 and 
Tapington,
 by that Service which they call 
ad Wardam Castri Doveriensis,
 and paid a respective Supply for them, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at making the Black-Prince Knight, and from this man did the possession of both these places flow down to 
Jo. Yerd
 Esq; who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the nineteenth of 
Hen.
 the sixth, and he had Issue 
John Yerd,
 who conveyed 
Tapington
 to 
Jo. Fogge
 Esq; and he again by a Fine levyed in the fifteenth year of 
Edw.
 the fourth, passed away his Interest in it to 
Richard Haut,
 and he determined in a Female Heir called 
Margery Haut,
 matched to 
William Isaack,
 who annexed 
Tap∣ton
 to his Demeasn, and in his descendant line the propriety remained untill that Age which was enclosed within the Circle of our Grand-fathers remembrance, and then it was alienated to 
Bois.
 But 
Denton
 with some part of the revenue of 
Tapington,
 conti∣nued longer in the 
Yerd,
 until 
Jo. Yerd
 the last Heir male of this Family, going to 
London,
 fell sick in 
Southwark,
 and dyed without Issue, and was enterr'd in St. 
Mar∣garets-church,
 afterwards converted to the Court of 
Marshalseys:
 so that 
Langley
 of 
Knowlton,
 in right of a former Match with the Heir General of this Family, was enti∣tuled to the possession of 
Denton,
 and the Demeasn of 
Tapton:
 but 
Edward Langley
 the last of this Name dying Childlesse in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, in relation to a former Match of the Heir General with 
Peyton,
 Sir 
Robert Peyton
 of 
Cambridgeshire
 became Heir to his Estate in 
Kent;
 whose Successor Sir 
Robert Peyton,
 passed away all his Interest here to 
Bois. Bois
 by Sale demised 
Tapington
 to 
Verier;
 who almost in our Remembrance conveyed it to 
Mersh,
 the instant proprietary: But 
Denton
 was by 
Bois
 alienated to 
Rogers,
 who in those Times our Fathers lived in, translated his right into 
Swan;
 who not many years since, sold it to Sir 
Anth. Percival
 of 
Dover,
 and he not long since transplanted it by Sale into 
Phinees Andrews
 of 
Hartfordshire
 Esq.


Wigmere
 is a third Mannor in this Parish; there was a Family of this Name in 
East-Kent:
 for in divers old Evidences which I have seen, there is mention of 
Will. de Wig∣mere,
 and divers others of this Name; but for many Ages it acknowledged the Signo∣ry of 
Brent,
 and so continued till the Beginning of Q. 
Eliz.
 and then 
Tho. Brent
 dy∣ing without Issue, 
Margaret,
 married to 
Jo. Dering
 of 
Surrenden Dering,
 became his Heir; in Right of which match, the Family of 
Dering
 is entituled to the instant posses∣sion.


Madekin
 lies partly in 
Denton,
 and partly in 
Barham,
 and owned a Family of that Sir∣name, (as appears by the Evidences now in the hands of Mr. 
Oxenden,
) and con∣tinued by a thread of several descents fastned to this Name; but about the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, the Succession of the Title was disordered, and by Sale translated into 
Sednor,
 where the possession for many years dwelt, till at last upon some Acquists in 
Brenchley,
 they withdrew themselves thither, and passed away their Interest here to 
Brook;
 in whom after it had continued three descents, the Fate of Sale, cast it into the Inheritance of 
Brooker;
 and by 
Elizabeth
 the Daughter and Heir of that Family, it not long after descended to Sir 
Henry Oxenden,
 whose Grandchild 
Henry Oxenden
 Esquire, now possesseth the Signory of it.




Davington
 in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 was given to the Cloister of 
Black-Nuns,
 which was founded there by 
Fulke de Newenham,
 and dedicated to St. 
Mary Magdalen.
 In the thirty ninth of 
Henry
 the third, that Prince confirmed them their Lands, and invested them with severall priviledges as appears 
Chart.
 39. 
Hen. tertii Memb.
 5. In the seventeenth of 
Edward
 the third, the King sent his Writ to the Sheriff of 
Kent
 to be certified of the Estate and Revenue which belonged to this Nunnery: for the Abbess and Nuns petitioned for relief, in regard their Income was not sufficient to support them; and 
Jo. de Vielston
 then Sheriff of 
Kent,
 returned 
per Sacramentum proborum & le∣galium Hominum,
 that they had not a competent Demeasn for Subsistence; that where∣as formerly there were twenty six Nuns, now there were but fourteen, and that those could not live upon the revenue of the Covent, but had the Charity of their Friends to supply them. Thus did the Cloister of 
Davington
 remain a Seminary of religious Wo∣men, whilst their revenue without, was the Fuel which supported and nourished the Flame on the Altar. But when the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth approached, which be∣came decretory and critical to all these Nurseries of a lazy and speculative Devotion, the demeasn which sustained this Covent, was by 
Henry
 the eighth plucked away, and in the eight and thirteeth year of his Government was by patent knit to the patrimony of Sir 
Thomas Cheyney.
 And his Son Sir 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney,
 in the eighth year of Q. 
Eliz.
 conveyed it by Sale to 
Jo. Bradborn,
 descended (as appears by his Seal affixed to his Deed, by which he alienates it again in the tenth year of Q. 
Eliza.
 to 
Avery Giles
) from the 
Bradborns
 of 
Darbyshire.
 But in this Family the residence of it was very brief and transitory; for his Son 
Francis Giles
 in the twentieth year of Q. 
Eliza.
 passed it a∣way to Mr. 
Jo. Edwards;
 and from this Family though the Fate of purchase did not rend it away, yet that of marriage did: for this 
Jo. Edwards
 leaving only one Daughter and Heir called 
Ann,
 she by matching with 
Io. Boade
 of 
Essex
 Esquire, linked this to his re∣venue, and from him it is descended to Mr. 
Io. Boade
 the present Lord of the Fee.


Little 
Davington
 or 
Davington-court,
 not far distant from that house which was the Nunnerie, was formerly wrapped up in that Demeasn, which confessed the Dominion of the Earls of 
Atholl
 Lords of 
Chilham,
 by whom the Mansion it self was built; as their Arms in Stone-work in the great Hall before they were taken down by Mr. 
Tho. Mills
 did abundantly testifie; and having for many years acknowledged their Signory at last it devolved to 
David de Strabolgie
 Earl of 
Atholl:
 who dying without Issue-male, in the forty ninth year of 
Edw.
 the third, left it to 
Philippa,
 one of his two Coheirs who was matched to 
Io. Halsham;
 and from him did a successive Right bring it down to Sir 
Hugh Halsham
 his Grandchild, who about the beginning of 
H.
 the sixth passed it away to 
Ja. Drylond
 who determined in one Daughter and Heir called 
Constance Drylond
 who was matched to Sir 
Tho. VValsingham
 of 
Scadbery
 Knight, who in her right became possessor of it, and transmitted it to his Son Sir 
Ja. VValsingham,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the twelfth year of 
H.
 the seventh, and kept his Shrievalty at 
Davington;
 and from him did it descend to his Grandchild Sir 
Tho. VValsingham,
 who almost in our Grandfathers re∣membrance conveyed it by Sale to 
Simons,
 and he not long after to 
Coppinger.
 And his Son having about the beginning of K. 
James
 mortgaged it to 
Freeman;
 they both joyned, and by mutual Concurrence fixed their right in Mr. 
Tho. Mills
 of 
Norton,
 who deceasing without Issue-male, it came by 
Ann
 his Sole Daughter and Heir, to be the Inheritance of Sir 
Io. Mill
 of 
South-hampton,
 who conveyed it to his Brother Dr. 
Mill,
 and he some few years past, alienated it to his Kinsman Mr. 
Tho. Mill,
 and he serled the propriety of it on his Son Mr. 
Tho. Mill,
 who hath very lately transmitted all his Right in it by Sale to 
Tho. Twisden
 Esquire Serjeant at Law, now of 
Brabourn
 in 
East-Malling.


Since my Writing of this, I have discovered by an old Survey of 
Davington,
 col∣lected by Mr. 
Tho. Mill
,
 that 
Io. Lewknor
 of 
Sussex
 Esq; had in the twenty first year of 
H.
 the sixth an Interess in 
Davington-court
 derived to him by 
Joan
 his Wife, Sole Inhe∣ritrix of Sir 
Hugh Halsham,
 which he not long after passed away to Mr. 
James Drylond.


Detling
 in the Hundred of 
Maidstone,
 gave Name to a Knightly Family famous for Fortitude and Chivalrie, in token whereof a Massie Lance all wrearhed about with thinn Iron place is preserved in the Church (like that of 
VVillam
 the Conquerours at Battel in 
Sussex
) as the very Spear by them used, and left as a memorial of their Atchivements in Arms, and an Emblem also of their extraordinary Strength and

Abilitie; In which respect those in 
Bedington
-Hall in 
Surrey,
 celebrate the renown of the 
Carewes
 atchieved at Tilt and Turnament; and that in 
Lullingston
-Hall in 
Kent
 the like for the 
Peches;
 As also that in 
Gerards
-Hall in 
London,
 upon which a Ro∣mance is drest up by the vulgar report, fancying he was some Giant, when the truth is, he was of the Knightly Family of 
Gizors,
 and Constable of the 
Tower;
 and this his Capital Mansion was Castellated, as the Seat of the 
Basings
 was, another strenu∣ous Family at 
Basings
-Hall in 
London;
 these matters allude much to the manner of the 
Romans,
 whose Victories were aplauded, and the Victors in their Triumphs extoll'd by Trophies and other Monuments and Ensigns of Honour, as 
Pancirolus, Rosinus,
 and others have judiciously observed, that have treated of these kind of Rituals: But to return to the Subject, from which this discourse hath diverted me, in this Family of 
Detling
 did the Possession of this place for many Ages remain constantly seated, till the beginning of the Reign of 
Edward
 the fourth, and then 
John Detling
 written, in some Old Deeds, 
Brampton alias Det∣ling,
 transmitted it by Sale to 
Richard
 Lord 
Woodvill,
 Lord of the Moat in 
Maidston
 not far distant, created Earl of 
Rivers,
 Lord Treasurer and Constable of 
England,
 by his Son in law King 
Edward
 the fourth in the year 1466. whose Grand∣child 
Anthony Woodvill
 Earl 
Rivers,
 being attainted upon supposed Treason in the first year of 
Richard
 the third, which was made so by that Usurper, and those black Engins which he had raised upon him, because he too cordially asserted the Interest of 
Edward
 fifth, it escheated to the Crown; and that Prince in the second year of his Government granted it to Sir 
Robert Brackenbury
 Lievtenant of the Tower, who it seems disliking a Tenure which was caemented with Blood, passed away his right immediately after to 
Richard Lewknor
 who had some estate here before, by matching with 
Eleanor
 Coheir of 
Tho. Towne,
 which 
Tho. Towne
 wedded to 
Bennett
 Heir of 
John Detling,
 and this 
Richard Lewknor
 about the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, gave it in franck Marriage with his Daughter to 
Hills. Hills
 resolved into two Daughters and Coheirs, one of which was married to 
Vincent,
 and the other was matched to 
Martin,
 and so upon the Division to avoid all Disorder and Confusion, 
Detling
 was split into two Mannors, one was called 
West-Court,
 which accrued to 
Vincent,
 and the other was termed 
East-Court
 which was annexed to the Demeasne of 
Martin. Martin,
 about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 sold 
East-Court
 to 
Webbe,
 in which Name after it had for severall years been fixed, it was in our Fathers Memory passed away to 
Smith,
 who not many years since a∣lienated it to Sir 
Edward Henden
 one of the Barons of the Exchequer, who upon his Decease gave it to his Nephew Sir 
John Henden;
 and from him it is now descended to his eldest Son 
Edward Henden,
 Esquire: But 
Westcourt
 was by 
Vincent
 passed away to 
Morton,
 of 
Whitehorse
 in 
Croyden,
 in which Family the Inheritance is yet remaining.


Dimchurh
 in the Hundred of 
Worth,
 hath nothing to make it memorable but that it was formerly the Inheritance of 
Twitham. Bertram de Twitham,
 held Lands here at his Death, which was in the third year of 
Edward
 the third, as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 115. And from him it came down to 
Theobald Twitham,
 whose Daughter and Heir 
Mawd
 was married to 
Simon Septuans,
 from whom descen∣ded 
John Septuans
 whose Daughter and Heir was matched to 
Fogge,
 who in her Right was entituled to much Land here at 
Dimchurch,
 and in other places of the Mersh; but the Family of 
Poynings
 had likewise some Interest here: for 
Michael Poynings
 was seised in Fee of some Lands in 
Dimchurch,
 in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 14. 
Parte secunda,
 and in this Name was the Possession carried on untill the Beginning of the Reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was alienated to 
Fogge.


Newhall
 in this Parish is the place where those which are the Lords of 
Romney Mersh,
 that is, of so many Mannors which lye within the Precincts the Liber∣ties of it, assemble yearly to compose Laws for the better regulating and se∣curing the Banks of the 
Mersh,
 against the perpetuall Invasions and Encroach∣ments of the Sea




Ditton
 in the Hundred of 
Larkefield,
 with its two Appendages 
Brampton
 and 
Sifleston,
 were in times of a very high ascent, the Patrimony of a Family called 
Brampton;
 the Book of 
Aid,
 (which makes a Recapitulation of the ancient owners, informs us. that anciently they were 
Bramptons,
 that is, in the Reign of King 
John,
 and 
Henry
 the third (as the Pipe-Rolls relating to both those Kings times discover to us.) Afterwards, in the Reign of 
Edward
 the first, I find the 
Aldons
 (by the 
Pipe
-Rolls) to have been Proprietaries of both these places; but, it seems, the Possession remain∣ed not long with them: for, in the third year of 
Edward
 the second, I find 
Stephen de Burghurst
 or 
Burwash
 died in the Possession of them, as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 4. And here the Title continued untill the forty third of 
Edward
 the third, and then the Lord 
Bartholomew Burwash
 this mans Grandchild, conveyed them to Sir 
Walter de Paveley
 Knight of the Garter, and he, in the first year of 
Richard
 the second, passed them away to 
Windlesor
 or 
Windsor:
 in which Family the Inheritance was placed, untill the fifteenth year of this Prince's Reign, and then they were conveyed to Sir 
Lewis Clifford;
 but in this Name they made no long abode neither. For, about the middle of 
Henry
 the sixth, I find they were alienated to 
Colepeper;
 and I discover, 
Richard Colepeper
 enjoyed them at his decease, which was in the second year of 
Richard
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 28. and in this Family was the Possession lodged, untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then the vicissitude of Purchase brought them to acknowledge the Interest of 
Leigh,
 and 
Thomas Leigh
 exchanged them with K. 
Henry
 the eighth; and that Prince in the thirty seventh year of his Reign, passed them away to Sir 
Thomas Wriothesley:
 and in the original grant it is recited, that they de∣volved to the Crown by exchange with 
Thomas Leigh
 Esquire, and he not long after demised them to Sir 
Robert Southwell,
 who in the second year of Queen 
Mary
 conveyed them to Sir 
Thomas Pope,
 in which Family they remained untill the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then they were alienated to 
Wiseman,
 from whom al∣most in our Memory they were by Sale translated into the Patrimony of Sir 
Oliver Boteler
 of 
Teston,
 Grandfather to Sir 
Oliver Boteler
 Baronet, who now is entituled to the Proprietie of them.


The 
Ropers
 held some Estate here at 
Ditton
 by Purchase from 
Clifford
 in the Reign of 
Henry
 the fifth, which 
Edmund
 Son of 
Ralph Roper
 died seised of, in the third year of 
Henry
 the sixth as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 33. which his Successor not long after alienated to 
Colepeper.


Dodington
 in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne,
 contains severall places in it, of no contemptible Estimate. The first is 
Sharsted,
 which was the Patrimony of a Family which was known by that Sirname. 
Robert de Sharsted
 enjoyed it at his death, which was in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the third 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 61. But after this mans departure, I do not find that it owned this Family any farther, for this mans Sole Daughter and heir was matched to 
John de Bourne
 Son of 
John de Bourne,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the twenty second, the twenty third, and twenty fourth years of 
Edw.
 the first, and after in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the third: Certainly, this Family was in times of a very high Gradation, as eminent for Estate, as it was venerable for its Antiquitie; 
Henry de Bourne
 made a Purchase of Lands and Rents in 
Duddington,
 of 
Matilda
 the Daughter of 
John de Duddington,
 (as appears by a Fine levyed in the forty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third; and the above-mentioned 
John de Bourn
 ob∣tained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at 
Bourne, Boxley Dodington,
 and other places, in the eighteenth year of 
Edward
 the first; and from this 
John de Bourne,
 did Mr. 
William Bourne
 in an even stream of Descent issue forth, who almost in our Remembrance, passed away 
Sharsted-Court
 to Mr. 
Delawne
 of 
London,
 whose Son Mr. ....... 
Delawne
 is the instant Proprietarie of it.


Ringleston
 is a second place of note in this Parish: of which there is a Tradition, that it borrows its principal Appellation from a 
Ring
 and a 
Stone;
 which those who were Tenants to this Mannor were to hold for such a proportion of time, as an embleme of their acknowledged Homage and Subjection: But this is but a fabulous romance in the whole frame of it; the truth is, 
Ring,
 in 
Saxon,
 imports as much as Borough or Village, so that 
Ringleston
 signifies no more but the Village-Stone, that

is, some eminent Stone which was placed there, to signifie and discover the utmost extent and limits of the Borough. Having unveil'd the Name, and dispelled the Mist of the former fiction, I shall now exhibite to the publique view, who were the ancient Possessors of it; and first I find the 
Chalfehunts,
 a Familie of a spreading Demeasne and no lesse reputation in this Track; 
Henry de Chalfehunt
 died possest of it in the forty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 14. After him 
Humfrey
 Son and heir of 
Thomas Chalfehunt
 was in the enjoyment of it at his Death which was in the ninth year of 
Richard
 the second 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 14. After this Family was expired, the 
Hadds
 a Family which was sometimes written 
Haddis
 and sometimes 
le Hadde,
 (which argues it to be of 
French
 Etymologie) was planted in the Possessi∣on, and remained many years invested in the Fee, till about the beginning of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 it passed away by Sale from them to 
Archer,
 from whom not many years after the same fatalitie brought it to devolve to 
Thatcher,
 who not many years since alienated both the Title and Demeasn to 
Allen;
 and he in our Memory, sold one moitie of it to 
Ford,
 and setled the other proportion of it upon his Daughter and Heir, who was matched to 
Giles.


Down-Court
 in 
Dodington,
 is an ancient Mannor, which in elder times owned the Signorie of 
Simon de Dodington,
 who flourished here in the Reign of K. 
John,
 and 
Henry
 the third, and was entituled likewise to the Patronage or Advouson of the Church: but he determined in an only Daughter called 
Matilda de Dodington,
 who in the forty first of King 
Henry
 the third (as appears by a Fine levied in that year) passed away her Interest here to 
John de Bourne
 in which Family the Title many years after rested, untill about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth it was conveyed to 
Dungate
 of 
Dungate-Street
 in 
Kingsdowne.
 And 
Andrew Dungate
 the last of this Name at this place, dying without Issue male, his sole Daughter and Heir was marched to 
Killigrew,
 who likewise about the entrance of 
Henry
 the eighth, expired in two female Coheirs, whereof one was wedded to 
Roydon;
 the second to 
Cowland.
 In 
Roydon
 The Pssession was but brief; for he, about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, alienated his Proportion to 
Adye,
 a Name deeply rooted in this Track, whose Successor Mr. 
John Adye
 still enjoyes the capitall Messuage or Mansion called 
Down-Court;
 but the Mannor it self which accrued to 
John Cowland
 upon the Division of the E∣state was by his Will, made 1540. ordered to be sold to discharge Debts and Legacies, and was according to the Tenure of the premises, not long after conveyed to 
Allen,
 Ancestor to him who is the instant owner of it.


Downe,
 in the Hundred of 
Rokesley,
 is so called from its eminent situation; it was in times of elder Aspect, the Habitation of a Family which passed under that Sirname. 
Richard de Downe
 who flourished under 
Edward
 the first, and 
Edward
 the second, lies buried in the Chancell of the Church, but with no date upon his Tombe: Soon after this Family was expired, the 
Petleys
 became Lords of the Fee, and 
Stephen Petley
 is Recorded in the Book of 
Aid,
 to have paid an Auxiliary supply for Lands at 
Down,
 at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third: and in this Family was the Title of this place successively wrapped up for many Generati∣ons, untill about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, it melted away with the Name. For 
Jo. Petley
 resolved into four Daughters and Coheirs, 
Agnes
 the eldest was matched to 
Jo. Manning,
 the second was espoused to 
Bird,
 the third was wedded to 
Casinghurst
 of 
Valous,
 and the fourth was married to 
Childrens:
 and upon partition of the Estate this Mannor fell to be the Inheritance of 
Manning,
 and in this Name for many years it remained constant, untill in our Fathers Remembrance, it went away by Sale to Sir 
Nicholas Carew
 of 
Beddington
 in 
Surrey,
 and his Son Sir 
Francis Carew,
 conveyed it to 
Ellis
 of 
London,
 who not many years since alienated his Right in it to Colonel 
Richard Sandys,
 third Son of Sir 
Edward Sandys
 of 
Northbourne;
 but 
Down-Court
 was long before passed away by 
Manning
 to 
Palmer,
 which was separated from the Mannor of 
Downe,
 and singly sold by it self.


The Arms of 
Philipot
 and 
Petley,
 are extant in the South-window of the Chancell, with this Inscription affixed to the Pedestall of their two Pourtraicttures, 
Orate pro Animabus Jo. Petley, & Christiana Uxoris, & Jo. Petley & Aliciae Filiae Tho. Philipot ........ ac Parentum corum.








E. E. E. E.


EGerton
 in the Hundred of 
Calehill,
 hath two places within the Verge of it remarkable: The first is 
Barmeling,
 which was the Seat of a Family of that Sirname, 
Robert de Bermeling,
 and in old datelesse Deeds called Sir 
Robert de Bar∣meling:
 he held it at his Decease, which was in the fifty third year of 
Henry
 the third, and left Issue 
William de Bermeling,
 who was also in the enjoyment of it at his Death, which was in the twenty second year of 
Edward
 the first, and so did 
Robert de Bermeling
 who made his Exit the thirty first of 
Edward
 the first, and here in this Family hath the Propriety by an undivided Track of Succession; been so fixed and permanent, that it is yet the unseperated Inheritance of this Name of 
Barmeling.


The second is 
Bruscombe:
 This was a Branch of that Demeasn which formerly acknowledg'd the 
Chitcrofts
 for its Possessors, a Name of very great Antiquity both here and at 
Lamberherst. Agnes
 wife of 
Richard Chitcroft
 held it at her Death, which was in the eighteenth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 198. After 
Chitcroft
 was worn out, the 
Beaumonts
 were invested in the Possession, and 
John de Bellemont
 or 
Beaumont
 deceased in the enjoyment of it, in the twen∣tieth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 14. But not long after this the Title ebbed away from this Name, and by a successive Channel of Vicissitude, was powred into 
Baron,
 a Family originally extracted out of the West, where they are yet in being; 
John Baron
 died seised of 
Bruscombe
 the second year of 
Henry
 the fifth. The Family which succeeded this in the Inheritance, upon their Re∣cesse which was about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, were the 
Wottons
 of 
Boughton Malherbe,
 in which Family the Title and Propriety hath been ever since so constantly resident, that it still rests in the Descendants and Heirs of 
Tho.
 Lord 
Wotton
 of 
Marley.


Eltham
 in the Hundred of 
Black heath,
 anciently called 
Ealdham,
 did anciently belong in part to the King, and partly to the 
Mandevills,
 from whence it came to be called 
Eltham Mandeville.
 King 
Edward
 the first granted that Moiety which belonged to himself to 
John de Vescy
 a potent Baron in the North, in the ninth year of his Reign, and in the twelfth year, ennobles his former Concession, and gives him a new Grant to hold a Market weekly and a Fair yearly at his Mannor of 
Eltham.
 In the fourteenth year of the abovesaid Prince, 
John de Vescy
 with his Knowledge and Consent, made an Exchange with 
Walter de Mandevill,
 for that Proportion of 
Eltham
 in which he was Interessed, and gave the sixth part of the Mannor of 
Luton
 in 
Bedfordshire,
 for one Messuage with the Appurtenances in 
El∣tham
 and 
Modingham:
 This 
John de Vescy
 died without Issue in the eighteenth of 
Edward
 the first, and 
William
 his Brother succeeded in the Possession, and was Lord 
Vescy,
 and had Issue by 
Isabell
 Daughter of 
Robert Perington,
 Widow of Sir 
Robert de Wells, William de Vescy
 his lawfull Son born in the year 1269, who died without Issue in his Fathers life Time at 
Conway,
 and was buryed at 
Malton.
 Then 
William de Ʋescy
 having a base Son called 
William Ʋescy de Kildare
 born at 
Compston
 in the County of 
Kildare
 1292,

 begotten upon 
Dergavile
 his Concubine, Daughter to 
Dunwald
 a petty Prince in 
Ireland,
 he made a Feoffment of all his Lands in 
England,
 to 
Anthony Beck
 Bishop of 
Durham
 to the use of 
William Ʋescy
 of 
Kildare
 his base Son; and also infeoffed King 
Edward
 in 
Kildare
 in 
Ireland,
 and in 
Sproxton,
 in 
Scotland
 for Licence of his good Leave and Assent to the other Feoffment.


William de Vescy
 of 
Kildare
 was slain in the Warrs of 
Stripling
 in 
Scotland.
 The King of 
England
 himself being then present in Person; By which means the State being in the Bishop of 
Durham,
 he disposed of 
Alnewike
 Castle in the North,

to 
Henry de Percy,
 that had married 
Idonia de Clifford:
 and considering that the Estate of Lands at 
Eltham
 came from the Crown; the said Bishop reserving an estate for life, disposed of them back again to the Crown: he himself dyed there, the twenty eighth of 
March
 1311. In the fifth year of 
Edward
 the second, and had bestowed great cost in building there. The Stone-work of the outward Gate being Castle-like, is a remnant of the work of that Time: The Palace it self being much more modern and Augmented by several additions of the Kings of 
England,
 who in a manner kept here their constant residence, and here were made the Statutes of 
Eliham,
 the pre∣cedents for Government of the Kin
s House to this day. The Bishop of 
Durham
 being dead, K. 
Edward
 the second kept his residence here,

 and his Q. was here brought to bed of a Son called 
John
 of 
Eliham.


K. 
Edward
 the third intending to give a princely reception to K. 
John
 of 
France,
 which had been Prisoner in 
England,
 and came over to visit the King,

 and dyed before his return, entertained him here at 
Eltham.


K. 
Henry
 the fourth kept his last 
Christmas
 at 
Eliham.




K. 
Henry
 the fifth his Son and Successor, lay there at 
Christmas
 likewise, when he was fain to depart suddenly for fear of some that had conspired to murther him.


K. 
Henry
 sixth made it his principal place of residence, and granted the Tenants of the Mannor of 
Eltham,
 a Charter of renovation of a Market in the seventeenth of his reign; which containeth more ample priviledges than any such grant that yet I have seen, as will be likewise evident to those who will peruse the original Record of that year in the 
Tower
 of 
London.


K. 
Edward
 the fourth greatly to his cost repaired the House,

 and inclosed 
Horn∣park,
 so called, being the Site of the Mannor of 
West-horn,
 which was anciently in the Kings Demeasne; For King 
Edward
 the third, in the twenty first year of his reign granted liberty to all his Tenants of this Mannor to be toll-free throughout 
England.


K. 
Henry
 the seventh set up the fair Front there, towards the Moat, and was usually resident there. I find in a Record, (in the Office of Arms) that he did usually dine in the Hall, and all his Officers kept their Tables there; and at such time as he created 
Stanley
 Baron 
Monteagle,
 by reason of some Infection then reigning in and near the City of 
London
 none were permitted to dine in the Kings Hall but the officers of Arms, who at the serving in the Kings second Course of meat according to the Custome, came and proclaimed the Kings style, and the style of the said new Lord.


King 
Henry
 the eighth built much at 
Greenwich
 with Bricks made here at 
Eltham,
 and then neglected this place; yet he lived here sometime, and kept a royal Christmass at this place, 1515. There is an ancient place in this Parish called 
Henleys,
 which in the time of King 
Edward
 the third, was a Marnor belonging to 
John de Henley,
 whose House was moated about, the situation is yet extant below the Conduit-head; but he dying without Issue, it came by his guift to King 
Edward
 the third, and was annexed unto the Mannor by 
William de Brantingham
 his Feoffee.


The Mannor 
East-horn
 and 
Well-hall,
 was in the year 1100. possest by 
Jordan de Iri∣set
 or 
Brinset
 first establisher of the Order of Knights Hospitallers here in 
England.
 In Ages of a lower Descent, that is, in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, it was held by 
Iohn de Poultney,
 and from that Family about the reign of 
Richard
 the second, it devolved by Sale to 
Chichley; Iohn Tatterst all
 married 
Agnes
 the Daughter of 
Iohn Chichley
 of 
Wol∣wich
 Son of 
William Chichley
 Alderman of 
London,
 and by her had 
VVell-hall
 and 
East∣horn;
 he had Issue by her two Daughters, 
Ann
 was married unto Sir 
Ralph Hastings,
 and 
Margery
 was married unto 
Iohn Roper
 Esquire: and 
Agnes
 their Mother was remar∣ried to 
VVill. Kene,
 who likewise had Issue by her, from whom the 
Mansells
 of 
Wales
 are extracted, and by this Descent are of the Blood and Kindred of 
Henry Chichley
 Lord Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 Founder of 
All-Souls
 Colledge in 
Oxford:
 but 
VVell-hall
 and 
East-horn,
 were united to the patrimony of 
Roper,
 and have continued here so fix∣ed that they are the present Inheritance of 
Edward Roper
 Esquire.


To this Mannor the Chancel of St. 
Michael
 in the South-side of 
Eltham
 Church be∣longeth called sometimes 
Tatershalls
 Chancel. In the windows, the Matches before men∣tioned are impaled in Coloured glass.


The utmost extent of this Hundred East-ward reacheth to 
Shooters-Hill,
 so called

of the Thievery there practised, where Travellers in elder Times were so much in∣fested with Depraedations and bloody mischiefs; that order was taken in the sixth of 
Richard
 the second, for the enlarging the High-way according to the Statute made in the Time of King 
Edward
 the first, so that they venter still to rob here, by prescrip∣tion;

 and some have been so impudent, to offer to engage the Sun shining at mid-day, for the repayment of money called borrowed, in a Theevish way, to the great charge of the Hundred that still was in the Counter-bond; and King 
Henry
 the fourth granted leave to 
Thomas Chapman,
 to cut down, burn, and sell, all the Woods, and Under-woods growing and confining to 
Shooters
-Hill,

 on the South-side, and to be∣stow the money raised thereby, upon mending the High-way. Surely Prince 
Henry
 his Son, and Sir 
John Falstaffe
 his make-sport, so merrily represented in 
Shake∣spear
's Comedies, for examining the

Mottingham
 in the Hundred of 
Blackheath,
 is a Hamlet and member to 
Eltham,
 enjoying like priviledges, which are annexed to both these places, as being of ancient Demealn. It was formerly written 
Modingham,
 denoting that it was proudly situated, (for so we interpret 
Mod
 in old 
English:
) It passed away from the Crown, with the Man∣nor of 
Eltham
 to 
Jo. de Vescy,
 and returned back again with it, inhabited in the time of K. 
Edw.
 the third by the Family of 
Bankwell;
 and after, in the reign of 
H.
 the sixth, by the 
Chesmans:
 the last of which Name which held this place, was 
Tho. Chesman,
 whose Fe∣male-heir 
Alice,
 brought this Seat to her Husband 
Rob. Stodder,
 Ancestor to 
Will. Stodder
 Esq; not long since deceased, who was proprietary of it.


A strange and marvellous Accident happened at this place upon the fourth day of 
August
 1585, in a Field which belongeth to Sir 
Percival Hart.
 Betimes in the morning, the ground began to sink, so much, that three great Elme-Trees were suddenly swallowed into the Pit; the tops falling downward into the hole: And before ten of the Clock, they were so overwhelmed, that no part of them might be discerned, the Concave being suddenly filled with water: the Compass of the hole was about 80. yards, and so profound, that a sounding line of fifty Fathoms, could hard∣ly find or feel any bottome; ten yards distance from that place; there was another piece of ground sunk in like manner, near the high-way, and so nigh a dwelling house, that the Inhabitants were greatly terrified therewith.


Edenbridge
 in the Hundred of 
Westerham,
 was ever esteemed a Chappel of ease, to the Parish of 
Westerham.
 The first that I discover by the beams of Record, to have been possest of 
Edenbridge,
 were the 
Stangraves,
 who had here their capital Mansion, which was known by their Name. 
John de Stangrave
 obtained a Charter of Free-warren to 
Edenbridge,
 in the twenty sixth year of 
Edw.
 the first. Sir 
Rob. de Stangrave
 was his Son and Heir, who was with 
Edw.
 the first, at the Siege of 
Carlaverock
 in 
Scotland,
 and there for his generous Service received the Order of Knighthood, and dyed seised of 
Eden∣bridge
 and 
Stangrave,
 the twelfth year of 
E.
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 52. After the 
Stan∣graves
 were vanished, the 
Dynleys
 were setled in the Signory of these above-mentioned places; 
Jo. de Dynley
 had a Confirmation of the Chatter of Free-warren to 
Eden-bridge,
 in the fourteenth year of 
Edward
 the third, and immediately after passed away his In∣terest here to 
Hugh de Audley
 Earl of 
Gloucester,
 Lord of the Mannor and Castle of 
Tunbridge,
 by whose Daughter and Heir, the Lady 
Margaret Audley, Stangrave
 and 
Edenbridge,
 came to acknowledge the Signory of 
Ralph Stafford,
 Earl of 
Stafford,
 and he dyed seised of them in the forty sixth year of 
Edward
 the third; and in this Family of 
Stafford,
 as they were successively Earls of 
Stafford,
 and Dukes of 
Buckingham,
 was the propriety of these places resident, untill the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then 
Edward
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 Lord high Constable of 
England,
 having unadvisedly consulted with a Monk and a Wizzard touching the Succession of the Crown, fomented so Vast a Stock of Fears and Jealousies in the Brain of that Cautious Prince, that they could not be extinguished but by his Blood, which was poured out on a Scaffold as the last expiation of that Treason, which was by Cardinal 
Wolsey
 pinn'd upon him, and likewise of his Prince's Fury. Upon this his untimely Exit, his Estate escheated to the Crown,

and King 
Henry
 the eighth not many years after, granted 
Westerham, Eden Bridge,
 and 
Stangrave,
 which were parcell of the Confiscation, to Sir 
John Gresham
 Knight, from whom they by Descent are now devolved to 
Marmaduke Gresham
 Esquire, who enjoys the instant Possession of them.


Delaware
 is a Seat of very venerable Account in this Parish: It was the Seat of Gentlemen of that Name as high as the Reign of 
Henry
 the second, as appears by old Evidences, now in the Hands of Mr. 
Seyliard;
 of which, 
Robert de la Ware
 was the last, who about the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, went out without Issue-male: so that 
Dionysia Delaware,
 who was matched to 
William Paulin,
 became Heir to this place. In 
Paulin
 it remained constantly resident, till the beginning of the Rule of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then 
William Paulin
 determined in a Daughter and Heir likewise, who was wedded to 
John Seyliard
 of 
Seyliard
 in 
Hever,
 which is still in the Possession of Mr. 
Seyliard
 of 
Gabriells
 in this Parish; and who descen∣ded from 
Ralph de Seyliard,
 who flourished about the Reign of King 
Stephen:
 In an old Pedigree of 
Seyliard,
 now treasured up amongst the Evidences of 
De∣laware,
 there is enrolled the Coppy of a Deed without date, by which, 
Almerick d'Eureux
 Earl of 
Gloucester,
 who flourished in the Reign of 
Henry
 the third, de∣mises Lands to 
Martin at Seyliard,
 and other Lands called 
Hedinden
 to 
Richard at Seyliard,
 who were Sons of 
Ralph:
 from which 
Ralph, John Seyliard
 Esquire, now Proprietary of this an
ent Mansion of 
Delaware,
 by a Steady and unbroken Current of many Descents in a Direct Line is originally extracted.


The Mannor of 
Sharnden
 in this Parish, was parcell of that Estate which belon∣ged to the Lords 
Cobham,
 of 
Sterborough
 Castle not far distant, and continued fol∣ded up in the Patrimony of this Family, till the Government of 
Edward
 the fourth; and then 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cobham
 of 
Sterborough
 deceasing without Issue∣male, 
Anne,
 matched to 
Edward
 Lord 
Borough
 of 
Gainsborough,
 became his Heir: in which Name and Family, the Title of this place successively streamed down, till almost our Times; and then the Lady 
Katharine Borough,
 to whom it was assigned by 
Thomas
 Lord 
Borough
 her Husband, to defray Debts and other Uses, passed it away to Sir 
Edward Richardson,
 Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, whose Grandchild the Lord 
Edward Richardson
 Baron of 
Cromartie
 in 
Scotland,
 does now possesse the Signory and Inheritance of it.


Elham
 in the Hundred of 
Lovingborough,
 is anciently written 
Helham,
 which denotes the Situation of it in a Valley amongst Hills. Though now the Mag∣nificent Structures, which in elder Times were here, be dismantled, and have only left a Masse of deplored Rubble to direct us were they stood, yet in 
Dooms-day
 Book it is written, (that the Earl of 
Ewe
 a 
Norman,
 and neere in Alliance to the Conquerour) held it, and left the Reputation of an Honour unto it, as the Record of the Aid granted at the making the Black Prince Knight in the twentieth of 
Ed.
 the third, doth warrant. For the Mannor of 
Mount
 adjacent to 
Elham,
 is said to be held of the Honour of the Earl of 
Ewe
 by Knights Service. In 
Testa de Nevill,
 there is mention of 
Gilbert
 Earl of 
Ewe,
 who then paid respective Aid in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third, at the Marriage of 
Isabell
 that Prince's Sister. From this 
Gilbert
 Earl of 
Ewe,
 it went away to 
Edward
 eldest Son to 
Henry
 the third, who obtained a Market and Fair to 
Elham,
 by Charter in the thirty fifth of 
Henry
 the third, and after he had fortified it with these Priviled∣ges, in the forty first year of the abovesaid Prince, conveys it by Sale to 
Boni∣face
 of 
Savoy,
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury. Boniface,
 to decline the Envy and E∣mulation of his English Opposites, which he and the rest of those Forreiners and Aliens, had contracted upon themselves, by their practicall Turbulencies in the Managery of the principal Affairs of State, under 
Henry
 the third, passed it away by Sale to 
Roger
 Lord 
Leybourne,
 a great Partisan and Confederate of 
Simon de Montforts,
 the popular Earl of 
Leicester,
 in his Quarrel commenced against 
Henry
 the third, about removing of Strangers both from his Counsells and Throne, for which after the Battle of 
Evesham;
 where that 
Simon
 was defeated and slain, he was by the Pacification made at 
Kenelworth,
 in the fiftieth year of 
Henry
 the third, absolved and pardoned; soon after which he dyed, and left this Mannor

with much other Revenue, to his Son 
Henry Leybourn
 and he was seised of it at his Death, which was in the twenty eighth year of 
Edward
 the first, from whom it went down to his Son Sir 
Roger Leybourn,
 who dying without Issue-male, 
Juliana Leybourn
 his Sole Daughter and Inheritrix, entred upon the Inheritance, and she was first wedded to 
John de Hastings,
 and after to 
William de Clinton
 Earl of 
Huntington,
 but by neither had she any Surviving Issue, nor yet any collateral Alliance, that could put in any pretended Claim to rescue it from an Escheat, so that in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third, in which year she dyed, it devolved to the Crown; and 
Richard
 the second granted it to Sir 
Simon de Bur∣ley,
 Knight of the Garter, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, a Man of great Virtues, and no lesse Vices; whose Pride and Ambition first galled others, and lastly wounded himself, and like some Physick, wanting a peccant Matter to work upon, preys upon the Vitalls themselves. For bandying against some of the Nobi∣lity, who pretended the Preservation and Sheltring of the peoples Interest against the impetuous Eruptions of an arbitrary Prerogative, he was empeached of high Treason in the tenth year of 
Richard
 the second, and was convicted and exe∣cuted, upon whose Calamitous Tragedie, this by Escheat reverts to the Crown; and the abovesaid Prince in the twelfth year of his Reign, by Grant, annexes it to the Revenue of the Canons of St. 
Stephens
 in 
Westminster,
 where it was fixed untill the publick Suppression removed it, and united it once more to the Patrimo∣ny of the Crown,

 and then King 
Edward
 the sixth, granted it, in Lease for fourscore years, to Sir 
Edward Wotton,
 one of his Privie Councell, whose Son 
Thomas Wotton
 Esquire, passed it away by Sale to 
Alexander Hamon
 Esquire, who determining in two Daughters and Coheirs, 
Mary
 married to Sir 
Edward Bois
 of 
Fredvill,
 and 
Katharine
 wedded to Sir 
Robert Lewknor,
 this in his Wifes Right came over to the last: but the Reversion in Fee was in the Beginning of the late King 
Charles,
 by Sir 
Charles Herbert
 Master of the Revells purchased of the Crown; and he some few years since, alienated all his Concernment in this Mannor to Mr. 
Alst
 a Dutch Merchant of 
London.


Elham,
 had the Grant of a Market procured to it, on the Monday, by the power of Prince 
Edward,
 in the fifty fifth year of 
Henry
 the third, which was after al∣lowed and approved of before the Judges Itinerant, when he was King, in the seventh year of his Reign.


Shotle
field
 in 
Elham,
 was, as high as the Reign of 
Edward
 the second, the Inheritance of a Family called 
le Grubbe,
 who had Possessions of a considerable Value, about 
Yalding
 by 
Maidston,
 and 
Nonington
 in 
East-Kent:
 In the third year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Henry Peres,
 and in another old Deed, styled 
Pers
 or 
de Petris,
 from his Habitation nere some place of a Rocky constitution, demises some parcels of Land lying in 
Elham,
 and 
Lyming,
 to 
Thomas le Grubbe,
 who is written in the Deed 
de Shotlesfield,
 and from this 
Thomas,
 did the Title descend by paternal De∣volution to 
John Grubbe,
 who in the second year of 
Richard
 the third conveyed it by Sale to 
Thomas Brockman
 of 
Liming,
 and his Grandchild 
Henry Brockman
 in the first year of Queen 
Mary,
 alienated it to 
George Fogge
 of 
Brabourn
 Esquire, and he about the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 sold his Interest in it to 
Bing,
 who in that Age which was circumscribed within our Fathers Remembrance, tran∣splanted the Title by Sale into Mr. 
John Masters
 of 
Sandwich,
 from whom it descended to Sir 
Ed. Masters
 of 
Canterbury;
 and he, upon his late Decease, gave it to Dr..... 
Masters
 his second Son Dr. of the Civil-Law.


Mount
 and 
South Blabden
 with 
Jaques
 Court, were Mannors which were in∣volved in the Patrimony of 
Anketellus de Rosse,
 and he in the twentieth year of 
W
lliam
 the Conquerour, held them as appears by the Record of 
Dooms-day
 Book: from which Name they passed away to 
Cosenton
 with 
Acris,
 but with this Clause reserved, that 
South-Blabden
 and 
Acris
 should hold the Mannor of 
Horton
 by knights Service, which was a principall Seat of this Family of 
Rosse,
 before it was sold to 
Kirkby;
 In the seventh year of King 
Edward
 the third, 
Stephen de Cosington
 ob∣tained a Charter of Free-warren to these above recited Mannors. This Man was Son and Heir of 
William de Cosenton,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the first, and is sometimes written of 
Cosenton
 and sometimes of

Mount
 in 
Elham,
 and from these two did Sir 
John Cosenton
 extract his Genealogie, and with it his Title to these two Mannors; and he deceasing about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, without Issue-male, his three Daughters, ....... married to 
Duke, Joan
 matched to 
Wood,
 and 
Elizabeth
 wedded to 
Alexander Ha∣mon
 Esquire, became his three Coheirs, and parted a large Patrimony. Upon the Division 
Wood
 obtained 
South-Blabden
 and 
Jaques
 Court, and 
Hamon
 carried away 
Mount: Wood
's Heir alienated the two first to Sir 
John Wilde
 of 
Canterbury,
 whose Son Colonell 
Dudley Wilde,
 upon his late Decease, hath bequeathed them to his Widow during Life: 
Hamon
's Heir determined in two Daughters and Coheirs, 
Mary
 was espoused to Sir 
Edward Bois
 of 
Fredvill,
 and 
Catharine
 was matched to Sir 
Robert Lewknor,
 descended from the noble and Illustrious Family of 
Lewknor
 in 
Sussex,
 who in his Wifes right was invested in the Possession of 
Mount,
 who upon his Death, transmitted it to his Son Mr. 
Hamon Lewknor,
 whose Widow Mrs. ..... 
Lewknor,
 eldest Daughter to Dr. 
Hen. Kingsley
 Arch-deacon of 
Canterbury
 is now in the enjoyment of it.


Canterwood
 is another Mannor in this Parish, whose Possessors, I confesse, I could never trace out, by any Print of publick Record; therefore I endeavoured to give my self Satisfaction, by the private Evidences: but, the Heir being under Age, the Deeds were deposited in the Hands of those who represented my Design in Surveying them through the Mists of Cautious Jealousies and Distrusts, and so my Attempt became fruitlesse. All the Intelligence I could gain (as in Relation to that place) was collected from an old Manuscript, whose Hand seems contem∣porary to the Time of 
Henry
 the eighth, and what I have drained from thence, I shall now represent to the Reader. 
Canterwood,
 says this Escript, was formerly the Estate of 
Thomas de Garwinton de Welle
 in 
Littlebourne,
 who flourished in the Reign of 
Edw.
 the second, and 
Edw.
 the third, whose great Grandchild 
Will. Garwinton
 dying without Issue, 
Joan
 his Kinswoman, matched to 
Richard Haut,
 was, in the ninth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, found to be his Heir, not only to this place, but to much other Land in this Territory; and she had Issue 
Richard Haut,
 who concluded in a Female Heir, whose Name was 
Margery,
 who by matching with 
William Isaack,
 linked this Mannor to his Revenue. Thus farre this Manuscript. Who were the Possessors since, the Court-Rolls which do not ascend very high, now in the Custody of Mr. 
Hugben,
 discover: The first Family which they recite is 
Hales,
 and it remained in the Inheritance of that Name, till towards the end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was by Sale transported over to 
Manwood,
 who some few years after, disposed of his Interest in it, by the same Alienation to Sir 
Rob. Lewknor,
 upon whose Decease it devolved to his Son Mr. 
Hamon Lewknor
 Esquire, who hath upon his Death during the Minority of his Son left the Possession to be en∣joyed by his Widow.


Bowick
 is a sixth place, which must now come within the pale of this Dis∣course. It was in Times of elder Inscription the Seat of the 
Lads,
 who in di∣verse of their ancient Muniments and Evidences writ 
de Lad.
 Now if you will know, where that place is seated, I answer, it is situated in 
Chart
 by 
Sutton,
 where there is an ancient Farme, which formerly had the Repute of a Mannor, and is at this instant, as it was in Ages of a higher Step, known by the Name of 
Lads,
 and was till, almost our Grandfathers Memory, in the Tenure of that Fa∣mily; after 
Lad
 was departed from the Possession of this Place, the 
Nethersolls,
 by Purchase were, about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, incorporated into the Possession, and staid in it some few years, and then alienated their Interest here to 
Aucher,
 who about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, resigned the Title by Sale to 
Wroth,
 in which Family it was resident, until some few years since it was passed away to 
Elgar.


Oxroad
 is a seventh Mannor in 
Elham.
 In a very old Court-Roll, now in the hands of Mr. 
Shetterden
 of 
Eltham,
 one 
John de Oxroad
 is represented to be the Possessor: and in others of a more modern Complexion, which bear date from 
Henry
 the fourth, and so downwards, untill the beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, the 
Hinck∣leys
 are discovered to us to be the Proprietaries of it, and then this Name was extinguished in a Daughter and Heir: for 
Isabell
 was the only Child of 
Thomas

Hinckley,
 who by espousing 
Joan Bene,
 carried this place into the Possession of that Family, where it was constantly fixed, untill of late years, the Title was by Sale transplanted into Mr. 
Daniell Shetterden
 of 
Eltham,
 descended from the 
Shetterdens
 of 
Shetterden
 in great 
Chart,
 which Land they have possest for diverse hun∣dreds of years.


Ladwood
 is an eighth Mannor in this Parish, written in old Evidences 
Lads∣wood,
 from whence we may spin out a more then probable Conjecture, that, be∣fore the erecting the house by 
Rolfe,
 it was a Wood belonging to 
Lad
 of 
Bo∣wick;
 but for some hundreds of years, that is, fince the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, it hath constantly related to the Family of 
Rolfe,
 a Name which Mr. 
Thinne
 conjectures in a Pedigree which he collected of this Family, was contracted from the ancient German Name 
Rodolphus:
 and Mr. 
Lambert,
 in his Kentish Perambu∣lation, mentions one 
Rolph
 a 
Saxon,
 who added much to the Castle of 
Rochester,
 from whom it is not altogether improbable, this Family, which hath been so ancient at 
Elham,
 might extract their first original.


Clavertie
 is the last place in this Parish, which may exact our mention: it did belong before the Suppression to the Knights Hospitallers, and was one of those places, in this Track, which was a Commaundry to the more general Seminary of this Order planted at 
Edwell.
 Upon the Dissolution of this Order, here in 
England,
 by 
Henry
 the eighth, who condemned their Disorder and Luxury, only to improve his own, like the 
Lapwing,
 who cries most when she is farthest off from her Nest, this was added to the Demeasne of the Crown: and King 
Edward
 the sixth granted it to 
Peter Heyman
 Esquire, who was one of the Gentlemen off his Bedchamber, and great Grandfather to Sir 
Henry Hamon
 Baronet, who was the late Proprietarie of this Mannor of 
Claverty,
 a person to whom if I should not affirm my self signally and extraordinarily engaged, I deserved to be represented to Posterity under the darkest Complexion of Ingratitude.


Eightam,


 vulgarly but corruptly and falsely called 
Ightam,
 lies in the Hundred of 
Wrotham,
 and hath that Denomination imposed upon it, from the eight Hams or Boroughs which lie within the Verge of it. The first is 
Eightham
 it self, the second is 
Redwell,
 the third is 
Ivie-Hatch,
 the fourth is 
Barrow Green,
 the fifth is St. 
Cleres,
 the sixth is the 
Moat,
 the seventh is 
Beaulies,
 and the eighth and last is 
Oldborough,
 which puts in its Claim to be of Roman originall; for when 
Leland
 visited 
Kent,
 which was about the beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, there was some Remains of an ancient Fortification: and it is probable that this being the way which led to the great Roman Colonie at 
Noviomagum,
 now called 
Woodcot
 in 
Surrey,
 was at this place fortified upon all emergent occasions, to secure their Retreat, from any hostile Eruption. The Mannor of 
Eightam
 it self, was the Possession of 
William de Inge,
 one of the Judges in the Reign of 
Edward
 the second: this 
William de Inge
 was by his Country and Paren∣tage of the County of 
Bedford,
 and had Issue 
William de Inge,
 who matched with 
Margery,
 Daughter of 
Henry Grapenell,
 and dyed seised, in the fifteenth of 
Edward
 the second, of this Mannor of 
Eightham:
 his Daughter and Heir 
Joan
 was wedded to 
Eudo
 Lord 
Zouch
 of 
Harringworth,
 and 
William le Zouch
 of 
Harringworth,
 dyed possest of it, in the fifteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 64. And in this Name was the Propriety of this place, for sundry Generations successively re∣sident, untill the beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then it was alienated to Sir 
Robert Read
 Serjeant at Law, and Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, who not long after going out in four Daughters and Coheirs, 
Dorothy
 matched to Sir 
Edw. Wotton, Margaret
 married to Sir 
John Harecourt
 of 
Elnall
 in the County of 
Stafford, Katharine
 wedded to Sir 
Thomas Willoughbie
 Lord Chief Justice of the Common pleas, and 
Eliz.
 espoused to 
Tho. Totihurst
 Esq; they divided his Inheritance, and this Mannor: upon the Distinction of it into parcells, this was added to the Revenue of 
Willoughby;
 from which Family, in our Grandfathers Remembrance, it passed away by Sale to 
Jam.
 descended from 
Jacob van Hastrecht
 who was anciently seated in 
Cleve,
 Ancestor to 
Will. James aliàs Hastretcht
 Esquire, thrice Knight of the Shire, within the Circle of five years, who by Paternall Derivation, is now Lord of this Mannor of 
Eightam.


Before I leave this Discourse of 
Eightam,
 I must inform the Reader of two things.

First that 
Edward
 the second, in the ninth year of his Reign, granted Licence to 
Will. de Inge
 the Judge, to hold a Market here Weekly on the Monday, and a Fair yearly at 
Eightham,
 by the space of three days, 
viz.
 the Vigill, the day of St. 
Peter
 and 
Paul,
 and the day after. Secondly that the Family of 
James
 now Possessors of 
Eightam,
 were originally called 
Hastrecht,
 as being Lords of a place of that Name neer 
Gouda,
 and were branched out from the ancient Family of 
Arkell,


 as likewise was that of 
Bouteslaw,
 both which Families bear the same Coat, without any visible Distinction with 
Haestrecht, viz. Argent
 two Barrs 
Crenelle
 or 
Counterembattel'd Gules
 three 
Pheon;
 or 
Broad Arrow Heads,
 in Chief 
Sables. Roger James,
 Son of 
Jacob van Hastrecht,
 came out of 
Cleve,
 (whither his Ancestor a yonger Son of the Lord of 
Hastrecht,
 had been chased by one of the Lords of 
Holland,
 because his Father, who likewise was forced to 
Drunen
 neer 
Huesden,
 by that Count, had been an eager Parti∣san of his enemy, the Bishop of 
Vtretcht
) into 
England,
 about the beginning of 
Hen.
 the eighth, and being called after the 
Belgick
 mode, 
Roger Jacobs,
 the English by a more soft and gentle pronunciation, filed off the roughnesse of the Accent and by melting it into a more narrow Volume, contracted it into 
James.
 By marriage, the Family of 
Haestrecht
 and 
Arkell
 above mentioned, are allyed to the eminent House of 
Wassenaer,
 issued out from the ancient Counts of 
Holland,
 as likewise to the Family of 
Waermont
 neer 
Leyden,
 who matched with the Heir of 
Hastrecht
 of 
Drunen,
 (where this Family had for many Descents been planted, ever since their first expulsion thither, by the Earl of 
Holland
) who was Colonel of a Regiment of Foot, and 
Drosart
 of 
Breda,
 when it was under the Government and Scepter of the King of 
Spain.


St. 
Cleres
 is the second place of Note in this Parish; it was formerly called 
Aldham,
 as being for many years the Patrimony of that Family, the last of which was Sir 
Tho. de Aldham,
 who resolved into three Female Coheirs: ....... matched to 
Newborough
 of the County of 
Dorsett, Margery
 matched to 
Martin de Pecham,
 and 
Isolda
 wedded to 
John St. Clere.
 Upon the partition of his patrimony, this place was, about the be∣ginning of 
Ed.
 the third, annexed to the Inheritance of St. 
Clere,
 and so it becamein pro∣cedure of Time styled 
Aldham St. Cleres:
 but Custome and vulgar Use did not long after file off the first Appellation, so that it hath for diverse Generations, been styled singly St. 
Cleres. Isolda St. Clere
 Widow of this 
John,
 did, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third pay respective Aid, for her Lands at 
Eightham,
 at the making the Black Prince Knight. And in this Family did the Stream of Possession carry down the Pos∣session of this place, till towards the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then it was ali∣enated from this Name and setled in 
Richard Empson,
 the grand Projector, who had wire-drawn, by his close and dextrous Artifices, the Treasure of the Kingdome into such subtile Threads, as he had almost wound it all into the Kings Exchequer: But he being convicted of Felony for his many Excesses, in the first year of 
Henry
 the eighth, this was confiscated to the Crown, and there it was not many years after by that Prince, granted to Sir 
Thomas Bullen
 Knight of the Garter, and created Earl of 
Ormond
 and 
Wiltshire,
 in the year 1529, whose infortunate Son 
George
 Viscount 
Rochford,
 being blasted with the black Aspersion of Treason, which was multiplyed and inforced to that Bulke, that the weight of it sunk him upon a Bloody and untimely Scaffold, and then this Mannor upon the Death of his Father, which was in the thirtyeth year of 
Hen.
 the eighth, was seised on by the Crown, as being setled before on him and his Heirs male, of whom this unhappy Lord was the last: Some few years after, it was by Royall Conces∣sion from the abovesaid Prince, made the Patrimony of 
George Moulton
 Esquire, of 
Moulton
 in 
Hadloe,
 a Man of high Repute in those Times, and much interessed in the Favour of 
Henry
 the eighth: whose Grandchild 
Robert Moulton
 Esquire, almost in Times within the pale of our Remembrance, alienated his Right in it to Sir 
John Syd∣ley
 Knight and Baronet, who hath upon the old Foundation erected that magnificent Pile, which for the Grandeur, Elegance, and Majestick Aspect it carryes to the publick View, surrenders a Priority, but to few Structures in this County.


The 
Moat
 is the third and last place which summons our Remembrance. It was in elder Times the Inheritance of 
Ivo de Haut,
 who flourished in the Reign of King 
John,
 and 
Henry
 the third: his Grandchild was 
Henry de Haut,
 who held this Mannor at his Decease, which was in the forty fourth of 
Edward
 the third,

Rot. Esc. Num.
 34. his Grandchild was 
Nicholas Haut,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the ninteenth year of 
Richard
 the second. Afterwards, I find that 
Richard Haut
 Grandchild to this Man was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 the eighteenth year of 
Edward
 the fourth: and again in the twenty second year of the abovesaid Prince, he was second Bro∣ther to Sir 
William Haut
 of 
Hautsbourne,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the sixth yeer of 
Edward
 the fourth, and great Uncle to Sir 
William Haut.
 But this 
Richard Haut,
 having with 
John Fogge, John Guldford
 Esquire, 
John Darell
 Esquire, 
James Horne
 of 
Westwell, William Clifford, Reginald Pimpe, John Pimpe,
 and 
Edward Poynings
 of 
Marsham
 or 
Mersham,
 embarked himself in the Designs of 
Henry
 Earl of 
Rich∣mond,


 and the emotion of 
Henry
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 he was attainted in the third year of 
Richard
 the third, as appears 
Rot. Par. de Anno

R.

 6. And then the 
Moat,
 by the Favour and Indulgence of that Prince, was conferred on Sir 
Rob. Brakenbury,
 Lieutenant of the Tower: but he enjoyed it not long, for 
Henry
 above∣said, having triumphed in a Successeful Encounter at 
Bosworth field
 over 
Richard
 the third, and all his Partisans, this was restored to 
Richard Haut
 above-said, in which Family it remained untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then by an old Court Roll I find it in the Possession of Sir 
Richard Clement
 Knight, who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the twenty third year of 
Henry
 the eighth: he dyed without any legitimate Issue, and lies entombed in the Chancel of 
Eightham
 Church; and 
Jo. Clement
 was his Brother and Heir, whose Daughter 
Ann Clement,
 was married to 
Hugh Pakenham,
 who in her Right possest the 
Moat,
 and he about the Reign of K. 
Edw.
 the sixth, joyning with Sir 
William Sidney,
 who had matched with 
Anne
 his only Heir, passed it away to Sir 
John Ailen,
 Lord Maior of 
London
 in the year 1526, and then again 1536, who left it to his Son Sir 
Christopher Allen,
 and he about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 conveyed it by Sale to 
John Selby
 Esq; whose Son Sir 
William Selby
 dying without Issue, to continue it in the Name, gave it to Mr. 
George Selby,
 of 
London,
 whom it acknowledges at this instant for Lord of the Fee.


In the North-side of the Church of 
Eightham,
 in an Arch in the Wall beneath the Quire, lyes the Representation of a Knight wrought in Stone, and his Arms pour∣trayed on the Coat Armour on his Breast, (according to the usage of eminent Souldiers) in the Reign of 
Edward
 the third. This was Sir 
Thomas Cawne,
 extracted originally out of the County of 
Stafford;
 he had not much Land of Inheritance in 
Kent,
 all I find was at 
Nulcomb,
 a place so called in 
Seal,
 as appears by his Deed of Purchase, of 
John Ashburneham,
 dated the thirty ninth of 
Edward
 the third: but matching with 
Lora de Morant,
 the Daughter and Heir of Sir 
Tho. Morant
 of 
Morants Court,
 (after his Death remarried to 
James de Peckham
) he thereby improved and enhaunsed his Fortune in 
Kent.
 He died without Issue, for ought as yet can be discovered; his Arms as they be inserted in the Rolls and Registers of 
Staffordshire,
 are empaled in the Chancel window with the Arms of 
Morant.


Elmested
 in the Hundred of 
Wye,
 was a Limb of that Revenue, which fell under the Signiory of the noble and ancient Family of 
Heringod. In Testa de Nevill,
 there is mention of 
Stephen de Heringod,
 who paid respective Aid in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third, for Lands which he held at 
Hardres
 and 
Elmsted. Stephen de Heringod
 this mans Grandchild, dyed about the beginning of 
Edward
 the first, and determined in a Daughter and Heir called 
Grace de Heringod,
 who was matched to 
Philip de Har∣dres:
 and so this Mannor in her Right, became incorporated into the revenue of this noble Family, and remained for many Generations fastned to this Name, untill the Age which almost commenced from our Fathers Memory; and then 
Dane-Court
 a Branch of this Mannor, was sold to 
Cloake,
 and 
Elmested
 it self by the same Fatality, went out to 
Marsh,
 whose Successor very lately hath fixed his Interest by Sale in 
Lushington.


Evington Court
 is an ancient Seat in 
Elmested,
 which was the Inheritance of Gen∣tlemen of that Sirname, who bare a 
Fesse
 between three 
Steel Burgonets
 for their Coat Armour: and in a Book coppied out from old Deeds and digested into a just Volume, by 
William Glover Somersett Herald,
 and now in my Custody, there is the Copy of an old Deed without date, wherein 
William Fitz-Neal,
 called in Latin 
Filius Nigelli,
 does passe over some Land to 
Ruallo de Valoigns,
 which is fortified by the appendant

Testimony of one 
Robert de Evington,
 who was Ancestor to the 
Evingtons
 of 
Elm∣sted,
 of whom there is mention in the Deeds of this place, in the Reign of 
Hen.
 the third, and 
Edward
 the first. After this Family was gon out, the 
Gays
 a Family of no mean Account in this Track, were incorporated into the Possession, descen∣ded originally out of 
France,
 where there is a Family which even at this Day is known by the Name of 
Le-gay,
 and is planted in 
Normandy,
 from whence those of 
Jersey
 and 
Gernesey
 are extracted, a Branch of which is transplanted into 
South-Hampton,
 and there for ought I know flourishes at present. And to justifie the Truth of this their Extraction, in the 
Leiger
 Book of 
Horton
-Priory, there is mention of one 
John le Gay
 who was a Benefactor to their House, and though they are called at this day, only, without the Addition, 
Gay;
 yet this hath happened by Disuse and Intermission, by not adding it in their Customary writing and af∣fixing it to their Name. But to proceed: 
Evington Court
 though it was not ori∣ginally erected by this Family, yet certainly it was much inforced by Supple∣ment, and additionall Building; for diverse places of the House are in Relation to the Name, adorned with Nose-Gays. In Conclusion, after it had owned many of this Name of no vulgar Ranck for its Proprietaries, it was, about the begin∣ning of 
Henry
 the seventh, by 
Christopher Gay,
 alienated to 
John Honywood
 Esquire, of the eldest Family of the 
Honywoods;
 from whom in a direct Line, 
Edward Honywood
 Esquire, Son and Heir of Sir 
John Honywood,
 lately deceased, is extracted, and is now invested in the Possession of this place.


Elmested
 had the Grant of a Market obtained to it, to be observed weekly on the Thursday, and a Fair yearly on the Vigil, and Day of Saint 
James,
 by the Procurement of 
Henry de Haut Pat.

Elmeston
 in the Hundred of 
Wingham,
 was parcell of the Demeasne of the Lord 
Leybourn: Juliana de Leybourn
 Wife of 
Roger de Leybourn,
 had an estate here at her Death, which was in the first year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 86. and her sole Heir was the Lady 
Juliana Leybourn,
 first married to 
John de Hastings,
 and after to 
William de Clinton,
 but dyed without Issue by either, in the forty third year of the Reign of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 57. and as it appears without any visible Alliance, that could justify their Title to her Estate: for the Crown feised upon it as legally escheated,

 by Defailance of any who could pretend a Claim unto it. King 
Richard
 the second, about the fourteenth year of his Reign, granted it to the Abby of 
Childrens Langley.
 Before I proceed any farther in this Discourse, I shall justifie what I before asserted, that is, that the first Husband of 
Juliana de Leybourn,
 was 
John de Hastings
 a Kinsman of 
Lawrence de Hastings,
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 but not his Son 
John de Hastings,
 as some suppose: and this is obvious, if we consider that 
William de Clinton
 deceased by the Testimo∣ny of all, in the twenty eighth yeer of 
Edward
 the third, 
Juliana
 his Widow called in the Escheat Roll 
Comitissa de Huntington,
 dyed in the forty third year of that Prince, and 
John de Hastings
 Earl of 
Huntington
 in the year 1375, which happened in the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, which must necessarily, upon a serious Computation of Time, fall out six years, after this Countesse's Decease, to whom had she been matched, she would have preserved the Stile of 
Comitissa de Pembroke,
 and not that of 
Huntington.


But to return into that Track, from whence this Digression hath made me wander; after it remained Cloistered up in the Revenue of the Church, for diverse Ages, untill the Title was by the Generall Dissolution dislodged, and in the thirty fifth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, was by Royall Concession from that Prince, invested in Sir 
Walter Henley
 Serjeant at Law, and a Man under an eminent Character in those Times; from whom, about the beginning of King 
Edward
 the sixth, it passed a∣way by Sale to 
Linch,
 a Family of good Antiquity in 
Kent,
 from whom the 
Linches
 of 
Lemster
 in 
Ireland
 are primitively descended, and have been for some Descents seated at 
Linch Knock,
 a Castle in that Province. After the 
Linches,
 the 
Gibs's
 about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 were by Purchase seated in the Inheritance, and continued in it, untill very lately the Title was unfixed, and, by the Transposition of Sale, planted in Mr. 
Jaques
 of 
London.




Erith
 in the Hundred of 
Little
 and 
Lesness,
 was a Mannor which was circum∣scribed within the Revenue of 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 that powerfull Baton, whose Story I shall pencill out more exactly at 
Leeds
-Castle: but, before him, 
Guncelin de Badelesmer,


 who lyes buried at 
Badelesmer,
 with a fair Pourtraicture upon his Tomb, cut out in Wood, enjoyed it, and held it at his Decease, which was in the twenty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 50. And this 
Guncelin,
 was Son to 
Giles de Badelesmer,
 who, as the Annals of St. 
Austins
 in∣forms us, was slain at a Battell commenced against the 
Welsh,
 in the year 1258, whilst he vigorously asserted the Interest of his Country, against their wild Ex∣cursions: But to advance where I first left off, 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer
 before mentioned, had such a particular Affection to this place, that in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the second, he obtained a Charter of Free-warren to this Mannor, and suddenly after, by his Confederacy with 
Thomas
 Earl of 
Lancaster,
 and the rest of the Nobility knit together in Combination against that Prince, forfeited his Estate and Life to the Crown. And then 
Edward
 the second, (as appears by the Patent Rolls of that time) in the fifteenth year of his Reign, grants it for life to 
David de Strabolgie
 Earl of 
Atholl,
 Son to the infortunate 
John
 Earl of 
Atholl,
 who was offered up a Sacrifice to the Fury of 
Edward
 the first, because he had done too little for him, and too much for his bleeding and gasping Country of 
Scotland;
 and this Earl held it at his Decease, which was in the first year of 
Ed.
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 85. After his Death, it reverts to the Crown, and then King 
Edward
 the third, not only reverses the Processe and Judgement, issued out against 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 but likewise by Patent in the second year of his Reign, restores this Mannor and diverse other Lands to 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer
 his Son. And he dyed seised of it, in the twelfth year of that Prince's Reign, but left no Issue-male; so that his four Daughters became his Heirs, whereof 
Eliz.
 was one of them, who was first matched to 
William Bohun
 Earl of 
Northampton,
 and after to 
Roger Mortimer
 Earl of 
March,
 to whose Patrimony this in his Wives Right upon the Quadripartite Division of this wide Estate, was united; and 
Edmund de Mortimer
 this Mans Son, enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the fifth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 43. And left it to his Son 
Roger
 Earl of 
March
 and 
Ulster,
 and he had Issue 
Roger Mortimer,
 and 
Ann
 who married 
Richard Plantagenet de Conisburgh,
 Earl of 
Cambridge,
 second Son of 
Ed∣mund
 of 
Langley
 Duke of 
York:
 and this 
Richard
 Earl of 
Cambridge
 having invol∣ved himselfe with 
Henry
 Lord 
Scroop,
 and Sir 
Thomas Grey
 of 
Northumberland,
 in a Treasonable Design, against the Life of 
Henry
 the fifth, in the second year of his Reign, as he was embarking at 
South-hampton
 for 
France,
 there to justifie his Title to that Crown by the Power of the Sword, was convicted and executed, and left Issue 
Richard Plantagenet:
 who was, in the year 1426, created Duke of 
York,
 and upon the Decease of his Mothers Brother 
Roger Mortimer
 Earl of 
March,
 without Issue, he became not only Heir to his Estate, but likewise to that of his Right to the Crown, which first had devolved to him, and after his Death to this his Sister 
Ann
 Countesse of 
Cambridge,
 Mother to this 
Richard
 Duke of 
York:
 from 
Philppa
 Wife to 
Edmund Mortimer
 Earl of 
March,
 their Grandfather; which 
Philippa
 was sole Heir of 
Lionell
 Duke of 
Clarence,
 third Son of 
Edward
 the third, and elder Brother to 
John
 of 
Gaunt
 Duke of 
Lancaster,
 fourth Son of that Prince, from whom the Lancastrian Family, had wiredrawn, and spun out, a forced, usur∣ped, and distorted Title to the English Diadem. Upon his Decease at the Battle waged at 
Wakefield,
 where he found an untimely Sepulcher, whilst he most vigo∣rously disputed his Claim to the Scepter, against the House of 
Lancaster;
 this man∣nor with the Crown, devolved to his Son King 
Edward
 the fourth, and here it dwelt with the Royall Revenue, untill King 
Henry
 the eighth, in the thirty sixth year of his Reign, passed it away to 
Elizabeth
 Countesse of 
Shrewsbury,
 Widow Dowager of 
George
 Earl of 
Shrewsbury;
 by whom she had Issue 
John,
 who dyed unmarried, and 
Ann
 first matched to 
Peter Compton
 Esquire, by whom she had Issue Sir 
Henry Compton,
 who was Heir to her Estate here at 
Erith,
 and secondly wedded to 
William
 Earl of 
Pembroke;
 Sir 
Henry Compton
 had Issue 
William
 created

Earl of 
North-hampton,
 in the sixteenth year of King 
James,
 and Sir 
Thomas Comp∣ton,
 who dying without Issue, gave his Estate here, which was setled on him by his Fa∣ther, upon his Marriage with 
Mary
 Countesse of 
Buckingham,
 to his Nephew Sir 
William Compton
 a younger Son of 
Spencer
 Earl of 
Northampton,
 who hath very lately alienated his Interest here, to Mr. 
Lodowick
 of 
London.


Bedenwell
 in this Parish had formerly the Repute of a Mannor, when it was the Inheri∣tance of a Family called 
Boreford
 or more vulgarly 
Burford: Rose de Burford
 held it at her Death, which was in the third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Ese. Num.
 52. And afterwards I find 
James de Burford
 obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at 
Bedenwell
 in 
Erith,
 in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third. After this Family was expired, which was before the end of 
Richard
 the second, it came to be the Possession of 
Draper,
 descended from an ancient Family of that Name in the County of 
Notingham,
 who concluded in a Female Heir. For 
William Killom
 matched with the sole Daughter of 
John Draper,
 by whom he obtained 
Bedenwell;
 but with this Proviso that he should change his Name to 
Draper,
 which hath been ever since both by 
Draper
 of 
Crayford,
 and 
Draper
 of 
Hering-Hill
 in 
Erith
 punctually performed. But since this solemne Stipulation, 
Bedenwell
 in seve∣rall peices hath been sold to 
Turner, Gainsford
 of 
Crowherst
 in 
Surrey,
 (who not many years since, alienated his Proportion to 
Cholmeley
) and others; so that being thus broken into Fragments, it hath now lost the estimate of a Mannor, and is to be entombed in Silence.


Hering-Hill
 is a place not to be forgotten, having been in elder Times the Residence of a Family called 
Abell.
 The first whom I find represented to us, under a Cha∣racter of estimate, was Sir 
John Abell,
 who was in the List of the Kentish Knights, which were Assistant to King 
Edward
 the first, at his Siege of 
Carlaverock
 in 
Scot∣land; John Abell
 his Successor was a Judge (as is manifest by the patent Rolls, of the 
Tower
) in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the second, and it is very probable, that it was either this 
John Abell
 or his Father, that obtained a Charter of Free-warren to the Mannor of 
Catford
 in 
Lewsham
 (which was after sold to 
William de Monta∣cute
) in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first. In the Reign of 
Henry
 the fourth: I find, by the Registers of the Crown Office, one 
Edward Abell
 to have been in Commission for the Peace, and he lyes enter'd in 
Erith
 Church, not in the Coemitery or Church-yard: though I confesse, upon a large square Plate of Wood, there is a Register of those accurately enrolled, who were Possessors of 
Hering-Hill,
 from 
John Abell
 the Judge, down to another 
John Abell
 who dyed possest of it about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 but the date is so violated by Time and the Impression of the injurious Elements, that it is hardly visible, much lesse intelligible; the last of this Family at this place, was 
John Abell,
 who about the year 1611, joyning with his Father 
Samuell Abell,
 alienated his Concernment here to Mr. 
William Draper,
 whose Successor Mr..... 
Draper,
 now of the County of 
Oxford,
 is the instant Proprietary of it.


Lesnes Abby
 was founded by 
Richard de Lucy,
 Lord Chief Justice of 
England
 un∣der 
H.
 the second, in the year 1179 and dedicated to St. 
Thomas
 the Martyr, the Saint of 
Canterbury,
 who as he had been above the Kings Will on earth, was now above his Faith in Heaven, being after his, but early Canonization, grown into such Ve∣neration and Estimate, that Orisons and Prayers, Shrines, and Altars, Abbyes and Tem∣ples, were offered up to his Name, of which this was none of the least, being a House of black Canons, or Canons of St. 
Augustins.
 This 
Richard de Lucy
 the Founder, was Son of 
Richard,
 who was Son of 
Roger de Chilham,
 and he was Son of 
Fulbert de Dover,
 who entred into 
England
 with 
William
 the Conquerour, and changed his Name of 
Lucy
 to 
Dover,
 (of which, first, there is not only a Signiory or Lordship, but likewise a Family at this instant remaining in 
France
) because he was one of those eight, to whom certain Knights-Fees were assigned by 
William
 the Conquerour, to be Assistant to 
John de Fiennes,
 in the Guard of 
Dover
 Castle; thus much for his Extraction. Now for his Dignity, he was not only Lord Chief Justice, but likewise Protector of 
England,
 in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the second, in his Absence in 
France,
 which great Office he managed with so much Fidelity, Prudence, and Magnanimity, that when the Earl of 
Boloign
 invaded this Island, in

the thirteenth year of the abovesaid Prince, he was forced to retire with Shame Confusion, and Losse: which Action must certainly have improved his Name to a very high Estimate, in the Opinion of those Times. Yet notwithstanding he de∣vested himself of that Pomp and Pageantry, these great Offices had made him glitter with (which Conquest, that he made upon himself within, was of more Importance, then any he could have atchieved without) and clouded himself in a Monks Cowle, and became the Prior to that Covent, he himself had erected, and there likewise found his place of Sepulture: And it is probable, that those Coffins, with Pourtraictures insculped, which were discovered in a Grotto or Vault, upon the breaking down the Foundation of this House, in the Government of King 
James,
 were the Exchequers which treasured up, not only the Reliques of this Sir 
Richard de Lucy,
 but likewise the remains of others of the same Family: But to proceed, the Prior of this place was in that Repute, that it was customary for him (as the Records of the Church of 
Rochester
 tell us) to have his Indu∣ction into this place, either by the Bishop immediately, or else by some Proxie, who represented the Bishop of 
Rochester
's Person. And in this State it continued, untill Cardinall 
Wolsey
 laid the Foundation of his eminent Colledge of 
Christchurch
 in 
Oxford,
 and thenwith the consent of the present Abbot, in the year 1525, it was supprest, and the Revenue of this Cloister, being found in the Hands of the abovesaid Cardinal at his Death, was by 
Henry
 the eighth, united to the Income of the Crown, where it dwelt, untill it was gran∣ted to 
William Brereton
 Esquire, who being engaged in the fatall Business of 
Ka∣tharine Howard,
 was attainted, and executed, upon whose Tragedy, it returned to the Crown; and was in the thirty eighth of 
Henry
 the eighth, granted to Sir 
Ralph Sadler;
 and he not long after passed it away to Mr. 
Henry Cook;
 in whose Suc∣cessors, the Possession was resident, untill almost our Remembrance, and then it was conveyed to Sir 
Thomas Gainsford
 of 
Crowherst
 in 
Surrey;
 who not many years since, demised his Right in it to Mr. 
Haws
 of 
London;
 who dying lately with∣out Issue, hath setled it for ever, on the Hospital of St. 
Bartholomews
 in 
Smithfield.


In the ninth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 obtained the Grant of a Market to 
Erith,
 on the Thursday, and a three Days Fair at St. 
Crosse,
 and another three Days Fair, the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in Whitson Week.


Lesnes,
 had by the Mediation of 
William de Wilton,
 a Grant of a Market, procured to be observed there on the Thursday, and a Fair to continue yearly the Eve, 
Simon
 and 
Judes
 Day, and three Days after, as is manifest, 
Pat.

Estling
 in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 gave Sirname to a Family, who had here an eminent Mansion called 
Northcourt,
 the last of which Family, was 
Ralph de Estling,
 whose Daughter and Heir 
Alice de Estling,
 about the Beginning of 
Ed.
 the first, was matched to 
Fulke de Peyforer, Custos
 of the Fleet, and Westminster in 
London,
 who in her Right became Lord of this place, and in the thirty second year of 
Edward
 the first, to inforce his Interest here, obtained a Charter of Free∣warren to this place; and in this Family did it reside, untill the latter end of 
Edward
 the second, and then was 
Northcourt, Denton,
 and 
Plomford,
 Mannors, which came along to 
Peyforer
 with 
Northcourt,
 were sold away to 
Roger
 Lord 
Leybourn;
 and his Widow 
Juliana de Leybourn
 held them at her Decease, which was in the first year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 86. And after her Decease, they devolved to 
John de Hastings,
 a Kinsman of 
Lawrence de Hastings
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 who was the first Husband of her Daughter and Heir 
Juliana de Leybourn;
 after his Decease remarried to 
William de Clinton
 Earl of 
Huntington,
 who in her Right was likewise possest of them, but likewise Deceased without any Issue by her, in the twenty eighth of 
Edward
 the third, after whose Death, it is more then probable, she continued a Widow. For in the Inquisition taken in the forty third year of 
Ed.
 the third, she is styled 
Comitissa de Huntington,
 and was found upon a serious win∣nowing, both of her Direct and collaterall Alliances, to have no Heirs that could directly pretend to the Title, so that her Estate here laps'd to the Crown, and King

Edward
 the third, in the fiftieth year of his Rule, granted the Mannors of 
North∣court, Denton,
 and 
Plomford,
 to the Abby of St. 
Mary Grace
 on 
Tower Hill,
 where they rested untill the Dissolution: and then King 
Henry
 the eighth, granted them to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney
 one of his Privy Councel, whose lavish and unthrifty Son 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney,
 after his Estate mouldered away by Retail in the eighth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 passed them away to 
Martin James
 Esquire, whose great Grandchild, Mr. 
Walter James,
 is at this instant the indisputable Proprietary of them.


Huntingfield
 in 
Estling,
 gave Sirname to that illustrious Family of 
Huntingfield,
 and stands a Monument to this Day, to inforce and perpetuate its Memory to Posterity, though the Name be long since extinguished, and gon out in two Daughters and Co∣heirs, being entombed in 
Coupledick
 and 
Norwich.
 The capital Seat of this Family, was at 
West-Wickham,
 on the Skirts of 
Surrey,
 where I shall make a more ample men∣tion of them: but they had other parcels of Land, which lay scattered in the severall Parishes of 
Northsleet, Mepham, Ludsdown, Cobham
 and other places, and it is probable this Family was possest of an Estate likewise in 
Somersetshire.
 For in Mr. 
Bishe,
 late prin∣ted Notes upon 
Upton,
 one 
Walter de Huntingfield,
 is represented as Teste to that memorable Compact, which bears Date the twenty eighth of Aprill, in the forty second year of 
Henry
 the third, and was made between 
Henry de Ferneburgh,
 and the Abbot and Covent of 
Glastenbury,
 to defend the Lands of the abovesaid Ab∣bot, against all the Claim or Pretence, of the Bishop of 
Bath
 and 
Wells,
 with the Dean and Canons of the same place, or any of their Champions; and certainly, this 
Walter de Huntingfield,
 is he, who is mentioned, to have paid respective Aid, in the Book called 
Testa de Nevist,
 for much Land which he held in 
Kent,
 at the Marriage of 
Isab.
 the Kings Sister, in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third. The last of this Family who was possessor of this Mannor was Sir 
John Huntingfield,
 who was summoned to sit as a Baron in Parliament, in the thirty sixth year of 
Edw.
 the third; and he passed it away to Sir 
Sim. de Burley,
 in whom it was resident, until the tenth year of

Northcourt,
 likewise in this Parish, which was granted to him upon the Decease of 
Juliana
 Countesse of 
Huntington,
 escheated to the Crown, and there made its aboad, untill the twenty first of 
Richard
 the second, and then that Prince, setled it by a new Grant, as ap∣pears

 On the Dean and Canons of St. 
Stephens
 in 
Westminster,
 and continued chained to their Revenue, untill the Link was by the general Dissolution of Religious Gonventions, in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, untied and broken, and then being cast into the Demeasne of the Crown, it was in the thirty fifth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, granted to 
Alured Randolph,
 and 
John Guldford
 Esquires, and they not long after, conveyed their In∣terest in it by Sale to Sir 
Thomas Moil,
 from whom the same Fatality in the se∣venth year of 
Edward
 the sixth, carried it away, and transplanted it into 
John Wild
 Esquire: and he not long after, transmitted his Concernment in it to 
Gates,
 and from this Name, the Propriety about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 was by the Vicissitude of Sale, conveyed to 
Martin James
 Esquire, Examiner of the Chancery, from whom the Title by descendant Right is flowed down to his great Granchild, Mr. 
Walt. James,
 who is now in the Possession of it.


Estling
 had the Grant of a Market, obtained to be held there Weekly, and a two Days Fair at St. 
Crosse,
 by the Mediation of 
Fulke de Peyferer,
 in the thirty second of 
Edward
 the first.


Diven Arnold
 is a third place of mark, in 
Estling.
 It is called so, because it was in Ages of a very venerable Inscription; the Inheritance of a Family called 
Dive,
 and it had the Addition of 
Arnold,
 because one 
Arnoldus de Dive
 possest it, and is often mentioned in Deeds without date, and was Teste to a Deed, whereby 
John de Valoigns,
 does convey Lands to 
Robert de Dive,
 Prior of the Hospiral of St. 
Johns
 of 
Jerusalem;
 which is justified by a fine levyed between the said 
John
 and this 
Robert,
 in the ninth year of 
Henry
 the third. And in this Family did it continue, untill the Be∣ginning of 
Richard
 the second, and then it was alienated to 
Sharp,
 of 
Nin-place
 in great

Chart,
 in which Name the Signorry and Title was for sundry Generations constant, untill about the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, it was conveyed away to 
Thurstan
 of 
Challock,
 a Name of great Antiquity in that Parish, from whom not many years af∣ter it went over by Sale to 
Jo. Wild
 Esquire, and he, in the entrance of the Government of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 by the same Revolution, disposed of his Right in it to 
Gates,
 who alienated it after to 
Croyden,
 who in our Fathers Remembrance, transmitted it by Sale to 
Bunce,
 and continues still in the Revenue of that Family.


Eastry
 gives the Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is seated, and was given to the Church in the year of 
Grace
 nine Hundred seventy and nine, by King 
Egelred,
 that is, 
Etheldred,
 Father to 
Edmund Ironside, Et est de Cibo Monachorum,
 say the Records of 
Christ-Church,
 that is, it was granted to the Monks for the Support of their Kitchin, and was in the first Intention of the Gift, I believe, invested in the Ecclesiastical Reve∣nue, purposely to expiate that Murder, which was at this place acted upon the Persons of 
Ethelbert
 and 
Etheldred
 Brethren of 
Egbert
 King of 
Kent,
 by one 
Thunner:
 as if that dark Tincture of Guilt, which the effussion of this Royall and Innocent Blood, had stained the earth with, could not have been assoiled without so munificent a Donati∣on. In the time of 
Edward
 the Confessor, this Mannor was held by the Monks of 
Christ-Church,
 under the Notion of Seven Plough-lands, nor was it represented un∣der a lesse Bulke in the Reign of 
William
 the Conquerour, and was rated in the Whole, in 
Dooms-day
 Book, at Thirty eight Pound, Ten Shillings, and Three-pence.


There was an ancient Tradition that that Altar-Tomb, which was placed at the East-end of the little Chappel, which belonged to 
Eastry Court,
 was the Sepulchre wherein the Reliques of the two Princes (mentioned before, to have been murdered,) were enshrined: nay it went farther and did affirm that there was a Light hovered con∣stantly about that Tomb, as if the Clearnesse of the Innocence of those who slumbered under that Repository, could not have been manifested better, then by the Beams of such a perpetuate Itradation.


Shrickling
 is a Mannor in this Parish which had always the same Possessors with 
Knowlton. Thomas Perrot
 held it the fourth of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 31. By whose Daughter and Heir, it devolved to 
Langley,
 and from 
Langley
 by the Heir General to 
Peyton:
 only I find Sir 
Edward Ringley
 Knight Marshall of 
Callis,
 and Bay∣liff of 
Sandwich,
 both by Water and Land, lived at 
Estry,
 in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and enjoyed this Mannor, in Right of his Wife 
Elizabeth
 Widow of 
Edward Langley
 Esquire.


Heronden
 in this Parish, was the Seat of a Family known by that Sirname, who bare for his Coat Armour a 
Heron
 with one 
Tallon
 erected, and gaping for Breath. One of this Family lay buryed neer the Chancel, in the Time of 
Robert Glover Somerset
-Herald, with his Pourtraicture and Coat of Arms in Brasse affixed to the Tombstone: both which by the rude Hand of some sacrilegious Person, are now torn away; yet is the Coat-still extant in very old Rolls and Registers, in the Heralds Office, where the Fa∣mily is called 
Heronden
 of 
Heronden.
 Nor is the Name lesse ancient, as appears by Deeds which commence from the Time of 
Henry
 the third, which related then to this House and Name. In the Reign of 
Richard
 the second, this Family determined in a Female Heir, who was matched to 
Boteler
 of 
Botelers
 Fleet in 
Ash,
 and she annexed this Place to the Patrimony of this Family, in which Name the Title of this Place, hath been e∣ver since successively laid up.


Ewell
 in the Hundred of 
Bewsborough,
 was a principal Mansion of the Knights Tem∣plers, to which much Land was united, both in this Track, and in 
Romney Mersh,
 where they held the Mannors of 
Hony-Child
 and 
East-Bridge,
 as appears by the Book called 
Liber de Terris Templariorum,
 collected in the year 1130, and kept in the Ex∣chequer. They were founded in the year 1118, in manner following. Cetrain Knights obliged themselves by Vow, in the Hands of the Hands of the Patriarch of 
Jerusalem,
 to serve 
Christ
 after the mannor of Regular Cannons, in Chastiry and Obedience, renouncing their own Wills for ever: they likewise professed to defend the Crosse and Sepulcher of our Saviour from the Eruptions of Infidels, and to secure the

high-ways for the Indempnity of Pilgrims, from the Ambushes of Free-booters, that they might more freely visit the place of our Saviours Agony and Crucifixion. They were called Templers, either from their Vow to defend the Temple, or else, from those Lodgings which were assigned them, neer that place, by 
Baldwin
 the fourth King of 
Jerusalem.
 This order in the second year of 
Edward
 the second, was totally supprest throughout Christendome. The Crimes alledged against them, were Pride, Covetousnesse, for did and unaturall Uncleannesse, and lastly private Collusions and Treaties with Infidels, which tended to the Subversion of the Chris∣tian Cause in 
Palestine,
 all which they solemnly renownced at their Death, which best interprets their Innocence to future Times: for certainly it was impossible, that an Order which had tyed themselves up, upon their Institution, within the Limitations of so strict a Vow, could universally at one Time, and in all places of the World where they were established, degenerate into those black, horrid and prodigious Crimes, wherewith their Enemies bespattered them. But indeed those who have fathomed the Cause of this their totall Abolition, find, that they were warping with some Compliance too eagerly to a Combination with the Emperour, who was then in Contest with the Pope, about vindicating his temporal power in 
Italy,
 and else-where, from the unjust enchroachments made upon it by that See. Which his Holyness descrying, wrapt them up in those pre∣tended Crimes, as the Roman Persecutors did the ancient Christians, in the skins of Beasts, that they might more easily be devoured. Upon this their Dissolution, their House here at 
Temple Ewell,
 was given to the Knights of St. 
John
 Baptist of 
Jerusalem,
 an Order rather restored then instituted by one 
Girardus,
 whose Vow was almost coincident in all the Ingredients of it, with that of the Knights Templers. And in their Demeasne did this place lye wound up, untill the finall Dissolution, in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth; and then being linked to the Revenue of the Crown it was fixed there untill the sixth year of 
Edward
 the sixth, and then it was granted to 
William Cavendish
 Esquire, and he the same year conveyed it to 
Christopher Sackvill,
 and 
Winefrid
 his Wife, who about the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 alienated it to 
John D
niell,
 who about the latter end of that Princesse, dying without Issue-male, his Estate here devolved to his two Daughters and Coheirs, matched to 
Mab
 and 
Wiseman,
 who both concurred, and by joynt Consent alie∣nated the Propriety of this place, about the beginning of King 
James,
 to Mr..... 
Angell
 of 
London,
 whose Son Mr...... 
Angell
 of 
Crowherst
 in 
Surrey,
 is now entitu∣led to the Fee-simple of it.


Borestall Banks
 in this Parish, was, as high as any Evidences do lead us to discover, part of the ancient Patrimony of the illustrious Family of 
Diggs
 of 
Diggs-Court
 in 
Barham, John de Digge
 of this Family, was Alderman of 
Canterbury
 in the year 1258, and was a great Benefactor to the 
Franciscans,
 who were newly sea∣ted at 
Canterbury:
 and purchased for their Support, an Island called 
Binnewith,
 in that City, and from this 
John de Digge,
 did descend 
Roger de Digge,
 who paid respective Aid at the making the Black Prince Knight, for his Lands at 
Berham,
 and other places in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and dyed seised of this Mannor, in the third year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot Esc. Num.
 19. 
John Diggs
 his Successor, was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the second year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and 
John Diggs,
 was Sheriff of this County, the fourth, of 
Edward
 the fourth, and this Mans Son, who also bore his Name, was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the seventh. Briefly, after it had for many Descents, owned the Interest of this Family, it was in the tenth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 conveyed away by Sale to 
Stokes,
 in which Family, the Possession was permanent, untill of very late Time, and then it was alienated to Captain 
Temple
 of 
Dover.

EAst-Farleigh
 lyes in the Hundred of 
Maidston,
 and was given to the Prior and Monks of 
Christ-church
 in 
Canterbury,
 by 
Ediva
 the Queen, Mother of the two Kings 
Eadred
 and 
Edmund
 in the year 941, and was as Mr. 
Lambert
 out of some old Records conjectures to find the Covent with Eele-Pies. If you will see how it was rated in the Conquerours Time, 
Dooms-day
 Book will tell you that 
Farnelege est Manerium Monachorum, & est de Cibo eorum, & in tempore Edwardi Regis se defendebat pro

 This Mannor up∣on the Resignation of the Revenue, of the above-mentioned Cloister, coming to the Crown, King 
Henry
 the eighth, in the thirty fourth year of his Reign gran∣ted this and 
West-Farleigh,
 which was given to the Priory of 
Christ-Church,
 by Queen 
Eleanor,
 in exchange, for the Port of 
Sandwich,
 which Donation of hers, 
Edward
 the first, (as the Book of 
Christ-Church
 informs me) fully ratified and con∣firmed, and likewise devolved from the Crown, upon the former Surrender, to Sir 
Thomas Wiatt,
 who was then one of his Privy Councel, and remained entwined with his Demeasne, untill his infortunate Attaint and Tragedy, in the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 brought them back, as escheated and forfeited to the Crown,

 and then that Princesse the same time, granted the Mannor of 
West-Far∣leigh,
 and the Site and Demeasne of 
East-Farleigh
 to her Atturney General Sir 
John Baker,
 who dying in the first year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 gave 
East-Farleigh,
 to his second Son Mr. 
John Baker,
 and 
West-Farleigh
 to his Son and Heir Sir 
Richard. Jo. Baker
 had Issue Sir 
Richard Baker,
 who about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 passed away 
East-Farleigh
 to Sir ....... 
Vane
 of 
Burstow
 in 
Hunton,
 in whose Des∣cendants, the Propriety of it continues, at this instant: but 
West-Farleigh,
 devol∣ved by Descent from the abovesaid Sir 
Richard,
 to his great Grandchild Sir 
Jo. Baker
 Baronet, who hath very lately conveyed it by Sale to Mr. 
Thomas Floyd
 of 
Gore Court
 in 
Otham
 Esquire.


Smiths Hill
 in 
East-Farleigh,
 hath been ever since the Reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, the Residence of the 
Brewers:
 though that Seat where they were anciently plan∣ted before was 
Brewers
 in 
Merworth,
 which was a Mansion entituled to the Poss∣ssession of this Family some hundreds of years, and from whence 
William de Brewer
 did originally issue out, who was Lieutenant of 
Dover Castle,
 under King 
John,
 to whom that King directs a special Praecipe or Command to deliver that impor∣tant Fortresse to 
Hubert de Burgh
 Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, as appears 
Pat.

Reg. Joannis Memb.

Totesham Hall
 lyes within the Limits of 
West-Farleigh,
 and was the Mansion of a Fami∣ly of eminent Rank in this Track, 
Jo. de Totesham
 was one of the 
Recognitores magnae Assi∣sae,
 as appears by the Pipe Rolls, in the Reign of King 
John,
 and he was Grandfather to 
John de Totesham,
 who held this Seat at his Decease, as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 17. Taken in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the third. And from him did it, in an uneven Channel of Successive Interest, come down to 
Anthony Totesham
 Esquire; the last of this Name, at this place, who about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth alienated this and 
Henherst
 in 
Yalding
 to 
Chapman,
 in which Family the Posession dwelt, untill the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was by the same Conveyance passed to 
Lawrence
 from which Name not many years since, it went away by Purchase to 
Augustine Skinner
 Esquire, descended from an ancient Family of the 
Skinners
 in 
Lincolne-Shire,
 and now by this new Acquisition transplanted in∣to 
Kent.


Farningham
 in the Hundred of 
Clackstan,
 vulgarly called 
Acstane,
 with the Moiety of 
Chartons,
 was in the Time of the Conquerour, held of the Arch-bishop

of 
Canterbury,
 by 
Ansgodus Rubitoniensis,
 that is, 
Ansgod de Rosse,
 and was ra∣ted in 
Dooms-day
 Book at one Sulling or Ploughland, as it was before in the Reign of 
Edward
 the Confessor. But this Name of 
Rosse
 determining here about the end of 
Henry
 the third, it came afterwards to be the Pattimony of 
Freming∣ham,
 and 
Ralph de Fremingham,
 obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to this Man∣nor, in the fifty fifth year of 
Henry
 the third, after whom it descended for∣tified and fenced in, with this new acquired Priviledge, to 
John de Fremingham,
 who was first Assistant to 
John de Malmains
 of 
Faukham,
 not far distant, in his Office of Sheriff, which was in the tenth of 
Edward
 the second, and was after∣wards Sheriff of this County himself, in the twelfth year, and then again in the eighteenth and nineteenth years of the above-mentioned Prince; and dyed possest of 
Farningham,
 in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 145. 
Pars secunda. Ralph de Fremingham
 this Mans Son, was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 the thirty second of 
Edward
 the third, and in the twentieth year of that Prince, paid an aux∣iliary Contribution, at the making the Black Prince Knight, for Lands conveyed over to him by his Father, and whose Tenure was in Knights Service, and lay in this Parish, and held them at his Decease, which was in the thirty eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 19. This Mans Son and Heir was 
John Fremingham,
 who was one of the Conservators of the Peace of this County, in the first year of 
Richard
 the second, and Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the second year of that Prince, and afterwards had the Custody of this County again, in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, but dyed without Issue; so that 
Ann
 his Sister, matched to 
Roger Isley,
 of 
Sundrich,
 became his Heir: and so 
Farningham,
 was with her, brought to acknowledge the Interest of this Family, from whom it devol∣ved to 
John Isley,
 whose Widow 
Alice Isley,
 dyed possest of 
Farningham,
 in Right of Jointure, in the first year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and from her it devolved to her Son 
Thomas Isley,
 and he dyed seised of it in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and it was found at his Decease, that it was held in Knights Service of 
Dover
 Castle, by the payment of a Rent-service, of twenty one Shillings 
per An.
 and had the Estimate of a whole Knights Fee. After him his Son Sir 
Henry Isley,
 succeeded in the Possession of this place, and being infortunately convicted of high Treason in the second year of Queen 
Mary, Farningham
 and 
Chartons
 eschea∣ted to the Crown: and that Princesse, in the same year, granted it back to his Son 
William Isley
 Esquire, and he in the third and fourth of 
Philip
 and 
Mary,
 by a Deed enroll'd in Chancery, passes away 
Farningham
 and the Moiety of 
Chartons,
 to 
William Roper
 Esquire, Grandfather to Sir 
Anthony Roper,
 and Mr. 
Henry Roper,
 from whom upon 
 a Will made by his Brother Sir 
Anthony Roper,
 wherein he demises the Fee-simple to Sir 
John Cotton
 of 
Cambridge-Shire,
 it is by Verdict taken away, and enstated on the above mentioned Person.


The other Moiety of 
Chartons,
 gave Sirname to a Family, who held it as appears by 
Testa de Nevill,
 in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third. In Times of a lower Descent, it was the Possession of a good old Family, called 
Grove∣herst. William de Groveherst
 paid respective Aid for it, at making the Black Prince Knight; and from him it devolved to his Successor 
Richard Groveherst,
 who in the Reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, determined in three Daughters and Coheirs, es∣poused to 
Richard Tickhill, Richard Hextall,
 and 
John Petit,
 who about the Begin∣ning of 
Henry
 the sixth, passed one Moiety of it to 
John Martin,
 whose Successor and Descendant 
Edward Martin
 above-mentioned, passed it away with 
Franks,
 men∣tioned in 
Horton, Kirkby,
 in whose Revenue it lyes now couched, about the be∣ginning of Q. 
Elizabeth
 to Alderman 
Bathurst,
 from whom, with 
Franks,
 it is now de∣volved by Descent, to be the Inheritance of Sir 
Edward Bathurst,.


Ralph de Fremingham,
 obtained a Weekly Market to his Mannor of 
Farningham,
 on the Tuesday, and a Fair yearly to continue for four Days, the Vigil, the day of St. 
Peter
 and 
Paul,
 and two days after, by Grant from 
Henry
 the third in the fifty fifth year of his Reign, 
Pat. An.
 55. 
Hen.
 3. 
Memb.
 12. Which Grant was renewed and confirmed to 
John de Fremingham,
 in the seventh and eighth years of 
Richard
 the second.


Chimbham
 is another Mannor in this Parish, which did give Name to a Family of

that Appellation, for I find in the Book of 
Aid,
 that when 
John de Fremingham,
 pays Aid for his Mannors of 
Farningham
 and 
Chimbham,
 there is a Recitall of 
Lawrence de Chimbham,
 which formerly held it in the Reign of 
Henry
 the third. But it is evident both by that Record, and by the Inquisition taken after his Death which was in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the third: that 
John de Freming∣ham
 held it, and transmitted it to his Son 
Ralph de Fremingham,
 whose Son and Heir 
John Fremingham,
 dying without Issue, 
Ann
 his Sister entred upon the Possession of this, as his next Heir, and brought it with her to her Husband 
Roger Isley
 of 
Sundridge.
 And so this Family became concerned in it, and kept their Interest here until the Reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then it was passed away to 
Sibill
 of 
Littlemoat
 in 
Ainsford:
 in which Name the Propriety had not been long wrapt up, when this Family, found its Sepulcher in a Female Heir. For 
Ed. Sibell,
 the last of this Name, resolved into a Daughter and Heir, matched to 
Hide:
 and he not many years since, conveyed it by Sale, to Alderman 
Bunce
 of 
Lon∣don.


Fairfield
 in the Hundred of 
Langport,
 was given to the Church of 
Christ-Church
 in 
Canterbury,
 by St. 
Edm.
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and Chancellor of the University of 
Oxford,
 about the year 1238, and more to fortifie the Donation, affixed his Seal, (
Sigillo suo confirmavit,
 say the Records of 
Christ-Church
) to the originall Grant. This upon the Suppression, was upon the Institution of the Dean and Chapter of 
Can∣terbury,
 by 
Henry
 the eighth, confirmed by Grant to them.


Faukham
 in the Hundred of 
Acstane,
 was the Seat, and gave the Sirname to an ancient Family called 
Faukham.
 The first whom I find upon Record is 
Walle∣ran de Faukham,
 who flourished here in the Reign of 
Henry
 the second, as appears by the Book called 
Nova Feoffamenta,
 taken in that Princes Reign, and kept in the Exchequer. Afterwards in Times of a more modern date it acknowledged the Signory of the Lord 
Grandison,
 Baron of 
Ferneborough,
 and 
Otho de Grandison,
 is said, in the Book of 
Aid,
 with 
Gilbert de Kirkbie,
 to have held one Knights Fee in 
Faukham
 of the Bishop of 
Rochester,
 which 
Rose de Faukham
 and 
William de St. Clere
 of 
Ford
 in 
Wrotham
 formerly held, and this 
Otho
 Lord 
Grandison
 held it at his Death, which was in the thirty third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 41. And left it to his Son 
Thomas Grandison,
 who dyed without Issue in the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 36. So that his Estate here and in other places, was divided between his Sisters and Coheirs; whereof this, came to be possest by Sir 
John Northwood,
 in Right of 
Agnes
 one of his Sisters, from whom by a constant Line of Succession, it was guided down to his Son Sir 
Roger Northwood,
 who was extinguished in a Female Heir called 
Albina Northwood,
 matched to 
John Diggs
 of 
Diggs Court
 in 
Berham
 Esquire: who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the second year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and so in her Right, this Mannor devolved to this Family, and lay couched in their Estate until the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth; and then it was passed away to 
Barham
 of 
Ber∣ham-Court
 in 
Teston.
 In which Name the Propriety had not been long resident, when 
Thomas Barham
 Esquire, concluded in a Daughter and Heir called 
Ann,
 who was espoused to Sir 
Oliver Boteler,
 who cast this into his Revenue, from whom it is now come down to Sir 
Oliver Boteler
 Baronet, only Son of Sir 
William Boteler,
 slain at 
Cropready
 Bridge, in asserting the Royall Quarrell.


Frendsbury
 in the Hundred of 
Shamell,
 hath severall places in it worthy of our Cognisance. The first is 
Eslingham,
 which was given to the Church of St. 
An∣drews
 in 
Rochester,
 by 
Kenulfus
 King of 
Mercia,
 as the Book called 
Textus Roffen∣sis
 informs me: But by the Registers of that Church, I find that 
John de St. Clere,
 held it in Lease of the Covent, about the ninth year of 
Edward
 the third; and after him a Family called 
Neal,
 who had large Possessions about 
Higham,
 were Lessees to the Cloister. In the sixth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, I find 
John Rykeld
 held it, and kept his Shrievalty at this place: after him a Family called 
Frogenhall,
 was by Right of Lease in the Reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, possest of

it, but upon the Suppression of this Monastery of St. 
Andrews,
 in the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, this Mannor was found to be Lease to 
Audley
 and 
Fisher;
 and then the Fee-simple in Reversion was granted to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Crom∣well
 Earl of 
Essex:
 who, being by the Malice of his Enemies, who had raised all their Black Engines of Mischief upon him, aspersed with the Calumnious Re∣proach of high Treason, was attainted in the thirty second year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and made a Peace-offering to the Fury of his irreconcileable Adversa∣ries; then this, by Escheat, returns back to the Crown; after which that Prince, by his Royall Concession, makes it the Inheritance, of Sir 
Will. Drury
 of 
Nor∣folke,
 in which Family it remained, untill Times of our Knowledge and Remem∣brance, and then the Interest was by Sale, translated into 
Henry Clerk
 Esquire, Serjeant at Law, and late Recorder of 
Rochester,
 from whom it is now come down to his Son and Heir 
Francis Clerk
 Esquire, collaterally descended from that eminent Souldier Sir 
John Clerk
 of 
Willoughby
 in 
Warwick-shire,
 who took 
Lewis de Orleans
 Duke of 
Longueville
 Prisoner, in that memorable Encounter commenced between 
Bomy
 and 
Spours,
 Villages not far distant from 
Terowan
 or 
Terwin,
 in the fifth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, which was Signally testified by that Prince, when by his Favour and Command, there was annexed this Augmentation to his pater∣nall Coat 
viz,
 upon a 
Canton Azure
 a 
Demy Ram
 Saliant Argent, armed 
Or,
 between two 
Flower de Lis
 of the last, over all a 
Batton
 or 
Truncheon
 (which intimates to us, that that Captive-Duke, was one of the Marshalls of 
France
) 
Dexterways
 in 
Bend,
 of the Second.


Chaddington
 is a second place of Account, and represents to our Remembrance, the Lords 
Cobham,
 who were in elder Times, Lords of the Fee. 
John de Cobham
 dyed seised of it, in the twenty eighth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 42. And from this 
John,
 did it successively flow down to 
Henry
 Lord 
Cobham,
 who was attainted in the first year of King 
James,
 upon whose Conviction, this Mannor escheated to the Crown; and that Prince some few years after, granted it to his Kinsman 
Lodowick
 Duke of 
Lenox;
 but he dying without Issue, it des∣cended to his Nephew 
James
 Duke of 
Lenox
 lately deceased, whose Dutchesse Dowager during the Minority of the Duke, her Son, holds the present enjoyment of it.


Goddington
 is a third place, which calls for our Consideration: It was parcel of the Patrimony of the ancient Family of 
Charles. Robert Charles,
 who was possest of Land about 
Hilden
 in 
Tunbridge,
 and was Bailiff of the Forrest or Chase there to 
Robert de Clare
 Earl of 
Gloucester,
 was seised of it at his Death, which was in the twenty ninth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 74. From whom it devolved to 
Nicholas Charles,
 who dying without Issue in the eleventh year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Alice
 one of his Sisters and Coheirs brought this to be the Inheritance of 
William Snaith,
 Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the ninth year of K. 
Henry
 the fourth, descended from 
William de Snaith,
 who was made Chancellor of the Kings Exchequer, during Pleasure, in the fifty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third: but this Family likewise going out in a Daughter and Heir, she by matching with 
Watton,
 whose Ancestor held Lands at 
Rydley
 nere 
Ash,
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, annexed it to the Incom of that Family, in which Name the Title hath ever since, by an even and permanent Succession resided.


Wainscot
 is the last place of any Eminence. It was a Branch which was en∣grafted upon that Demeasne which fell under the Signiory of the 
Colepepers
 of 
Alresford. Walter Colepeper
 of 
Preston
 in that Parish, held it at his Death, which was in the first year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 80. And into the Patrimony of this Family did the Right of it, by a Succession of many Descents, even seem to have bin riveted, having continued constant to this Name, from the a∣bove mentioned 
Walter Colepeper,
 untill the Reign of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 and then it was alienated to 
Randolph,,
 from which Family in Times which were within the Circle of our Fathers Remembrance it passed away by Sale to 
Somers,
 descended from 
William Somer,
 Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Reign of 
Henry
 the sixth who held much Land in the Hundred of 
Hoo,
 whose Son not many years since passed it away, to Mr. 
Robinson
 of 
Rochester.




Frensted
 in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne,
 was honored anciently, by being parcel of the Pa∣trimony of the noble Family of 
Crombwell,
 written so in elder Times, though since a sof∣ter pronunciation hath been quilted into the Name, so that in Times of a more mo∣dern Aspect, it hath been written 
Cromwell,
 who had here a Seat called now 
Meriam Court,
 but in elder Orthography written 
Mereham
 Court. The first of this Family whom I find possest of it, was 
John de Crombwell,
 who in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the second, as Sir 
Henry Spelman,
 in his Glossary, in the Word 
Ban∣neretus,
 cites the Record out of the Office of the 
Pell,
 was written 
Banneret.
 Now what these 
Bannerets
 were, I shall briefly unfold: they were formerly called 
Vex∣illiferi,
 because their Investiture anciently, was, by delivering to them a 
Guidon,
 which was nothing but a 
Pennon
 cut off at the end, which before flowed out into an acute Angle, and now was fashioned and composed into a Square. And as an∣ciently, thirteen Knights Fees, did in the vulgar Estimate, make up a Tenure 
per Baroniam;
 so did ten Knights Fees compose a 
Banneret,
 out of which he was (whensoever the Affairs of the Prince did require) to bring into the Field twelve or sixteen Chevaliers or Horsemen, and those Persons of no cheap or inconsidera∣ble Account, but such as could (as Sir 
Henry Spelman
 notes, 
ex Praediis & Peculio proprio
) out of their own Patrimony, Equipp, Horse and furniture of Armes, pro∣portionate to the Service they were to be embarked in.


But to proceed: 
Ralph de Crombwell,
 Son of the abovesaid 
John,
 in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the second, obtained a Charter of Free-warren, to his Lands here at 
Frensted
 and 
Meriam Court,
 but his Family, after the Grant of this Franchise, did not long possesse their Inheritance here; for 
Richard de Crombwell,
 this mans Son, about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the third, passed it away to 
Hugh Girund,
 in whom the Title was as sickle and volatile: for he determining in 
Mawd
 his Sole Daugh∣ter and Heir, she by matching with 
Henry de Chalfhunt,
 made it his Patrimony, and he in his Wifes Right, was seised of it at his Death, which was in the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 14. And in this Family, did the Propriety of 
Meriam Court,
 and other Lands at 
Frensted,
 continue invested untill the Entrance of 
Henry
 the sixth; and then it was passed away to 
Hadde,
 now called 
Hadds,
 and 
William Hadde
 held 
Meriam Court,
 and the Land annexed to it here at 
Frensted
 at his Decease, which was in the thirty fourth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and in this Family was the Possession constantly resident, untill that Age which fell within the Circle of our Grandfathers Knowledge; and then it was conveyed to 
Archer,
 from which Family some few years since, it went off by Sale to 
Thatcher.


Yokes Court
 is another ancient Seat in 
Frensted,
 which, as high as any Beam, either of Publick Record, or private Muniments, can conduct me to a Discove∣ry; I find, acknowledged the noble Family of 
Northwood,
 and owned the In∣terest of that Family, untill the thirty fifth of 
Edward
 the third, and then 
Roger de Northwood
 dying without Issue-male, bequeathed it to his only Daughter and Heir, 
Albina Northwood;
 who by matching with 
John Digge
 of 
Diggs Court
 in 
Berham,
 united this Seat to the Interest of that Name and Family, and they to keep Life in her Memory, (a small Preferment beyond the Fate of humane Frailty,) that had improved their Paternal Inheritance with so great a Supplement of Ad∣ditional Estate, erected a fair Monument over her Ashes in 
Berham
 Church, and adorned it with a French Epitaph, which instructs the Reader, whose Dust sleeps beneath the Marble Repository. Indeed in this Act, this Family seemed to be Corrivalls with the Egyptians, who expended more upon the Structure of their Tombs then Houses, because they knew they were to dwell longer in them. But I have digressed. I now proceed: Thus have you seen how this Seat fell under Signiory of 
Diggs,
 and the succeeding Records of this Family will inform you, that the Title made its aboad in this Name, untill allmost that Age we call our Fathers; and then it was transmitted by Sale to 
Archer,
 from whom not many years since, a Fatality like the former, hath now brought it to bee the Possession of 
Thatcher.




Feversham
 affords a Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is placed. In the year 812, in the Charter of 
Kenulf
 King of 
Mercia,
 it is called the Kings little Town. It seems it was of no bigg Dimension then, though it be multiplyed and swolne into a greater Bulk since; yet, as small as it was, 
Athelstan
 in the year 903, held a publick Moot or great Counsell here, (which Assemblies since the Normans entring here were termed Parliaments) and enacted severall Laws, in this Convention. Probably enough, it belonged to the Crown in elder Times, and was a Mannor-house of the Kings: for 
William
 the Conquerour (as the Records of St. 
Austins
 testifie) gave the Advowson of the Church, to that Abby, in the year 1072, and the Mannor it self to a Norman, in Recompence of some signal Ser∣vice. But when King 
Stephen,
 resolved to erect the Abby there, he compoun∣ded with 
William de Ipre
 Earl of 
Kent,
 and gave him the Mannor of 
Lilly-Church
 in Exchange for it, and his Queen 
Matilda,
 raised a stately Monastery which she stored with Monks, of the Order of St. 
Bennet,
 which were brought thither by 
Clarem∣bald
 the first Abbot, from the Abby of St. 
Marys
 at 
Bermondsey
 in 
Southwark,
 and procured a Letter to be writ from 
Peter Abbot
 of that place, to absolve and re∣lease them from all Obedience, to the Order of the 
Cluniac's.
 And here was K. 
Stephen, Matilda
 his Wife, and 
Eustace
 Earl of 
Boloign,
 his Son, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Constable of 
Dover
 Castle solemnly enter'd. Of which for∣mer King it is observed, that though his Reign were rough and tempestuous, by Reason of his perptuall Debates and Contests, with 
Mawd
 the Empresse and her Son, concerning the Title; yet were there more Religious Convents erected in his Rule then either before or after; which made it appear though the Times were bad they were not impious. And certainly, from the uneven and imperfect Prospect, which those Times folded up in the Flame and Smoak of Civil War, have afforded us of this Prince, and of his Sway of the Scepter, we may conclude that in all things, he was fit to be a King, but that he was one. 
Thorne
 the Chronicler relates two Contests that happened between the Monks of St. 
Augustins
 and others: the first was between them and King 
John
 animated by 
Hughbert
 Archbishop of 
Canterbury
 touching the Right of Patronage, of the Church of St. 
Mary Charity
 at 
Feversham.
 The K. apprehending the Advowson of the Church, belonged to him, or at least made to believe so by the Archbishop, presents a Clerk to the Church, and commands his Pre∣sentment should be received, which they not only disobeyed, but ejected the Clerk, and sent diverse of their Monks to maintain the Possession of the Church by strong Hand. Which the King understanding, commanded 
Reginald de Cornhill
 the Sheriff, to disseise them and restore his presented Clerk, which he in Order to the Kings Injunction, not without a vigorous Resistance by the Monks effected. Upon which, the Monks complain to 
Stephen
 the Popes Legat, who then was there journeying to 
Rome,
 and in his Way sojourned at their Cloister. And he com∣passionating their Condition, advised them to send their Prior to 
Rome,
 least the Power of the See Apostolick might, by this Affront and Inroad upon it, be tram∣pled under Foot. Hereupon the Pope, upon Advertisement received, issues out a Commission to understand the Matter in Debate: But the Monks upon a serious Debate with themselves, knowing the King's impetuous Temper, they found out a more compendious Method for an Accommodation, and presented the King with two Hundred Marks in a Purse, and a meet Palfrey for his Saddle, by which Do∣native they so endeared the K. that they obtained Restitution of their Right, and made him for the future, their gratious Patron.


Another Conflict fell out after this, between the Abbot, and Maior and Burgers of this Town, about some Intrusions and encroachments made by the Townsmen, as was pretended, upon the Franchises of the Church. You may be sure 
Thorn
 who relates it, is warped with a partial Engagement to his own Fraternity, and with that Caution you may read him. Upon the Dissolution made in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, this Mannor with all its Priviledges returned to the Crown, and lay incorporated with its Revenue untill the Reign of King 
Charles.
 And then it was granted to Sir 
Dudley Diggs
 of 
Chilham
 Castle, who not long after setled it on his second Son Mr. 
Jo. Digg,
 who not long since demised it to Sir 
George Sonds
 of 
Leeze-court.




Fishbourne
 in this Parish, is an ancient Mannor, from whence a Family of that Sirname borrowed its Appellation. One 
John de Fist bourn
 was a Witnesse to that Charter, by which a place called 
Messewell
 was given to 
Feversham
 Abby, in the Reign of 
Henry
 the second. Afterwards, in the Reign of 
Edward
 the third, I find the 
Dreylonds
 to be possest of it, but their ancient Seat, was at 
Cokesditch
 in this Parish. For in a Deed dated the twenty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
John
 the Son of 
Stephen Dreylond,
 whereby he demises some Land in a place called 
Crouchfield,
 to 
William Makenade,
 writes himself of 
Cokesditch;
 and in this Family did the Interest of 
Fishbourne
 continue, untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth. And then it was alienated to 
Simons,
 to which Name the Title hath remained constantly allied to this Day. Nor was 
Cokesditch
 fixed in 
Dreylond
 by a Tenure more permanent, for 
katharine
 Sole Heir of Sir 
Richard Dreylond,
 was matched to 
Reginald Norton
 of 
Milton
 Esquire, and so with her both the Name and Pro∣priety of this place were entombed in this Family; and this 
Reginald
 upon his Decease, gave it to his second Son 
William Norton,
 and from him successively was it transmitted to others of that Line, untill those Times which confined upon our Fathers Remembrance: And then it was alienated to 
Parsons,
 who was not long seated in his new Acquists, but he conveys it away to 
Ashton,
 by whose Daughter and Heir it is lately transplanted into 
Buck.


Frittenden
 in the Hundred of 
Cranbroke,
 resolves it self into several places which call for our Notice. The first is 
Comden.
 It was clapsed up within the Revenue of the Priory of 
Leeds,
 untill the Storm or Hurricano rather, in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, threw it into the Demeasn of the Crown. And then that Prince, in the thirty second year of his Reign, conveyed it by Grant to Sir 
Walter Henley,
 and he in the thirty fourth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, transmitted it by his Deed to Sir 
John Baker,
 whose Successor Sir 
John Baker,
 even in those Times which entrenched on our Remembrance, passed it away to Mr....... 
Cleyton
 of 
London.


Bewper
 is the second place of account in this Parish. It was in elder Times an Appendage or Fragment of that Demeasn, which did contribute to the Support of the Abby of 
Feversham,
 and upon the Suppression of that Cloister or Seminary, by 
Henry
 the eighth, it was in the thirty fifth year of that Princes Reign, gran∣ted to Sir 
Thomas Moil,
 who not long after passed it away to 
Robert Prat.
 And his Son Master 
Franci. Prat, primo Elizabethae,
 by Fine conveyed it to Mr 
Edward Bathurst,
 who not many years after, transplanted his Interest here by Sale into Sir 
Richard Baker,
 Ancestor to Sir 
Jo. Baker
 of 
Sisinghurst
 Baronet, who now by pater∣nal Succession, is entituled to the instant Signory of it.


Wallinghurst
 and 
Buckhurst
 are two petty Mannors, which belonged to the Abby of 
Feversham,
 but upon the Suppression of that Covent, they were pared off, and by Grant from 
Henry
 the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his Reign, were enstated upon 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cromwell
 Earl of 
Essex.
 But long he was not endowed with them: for in the thirty second year of that Prince's Government, he was bespattered and blasted with an Accusation of high Treason, which the Subtlety of his Adversaries had woven so closely together that he was entangled in it; and being attainted, forfeited both his Life and Estate to the Fury, I cannot say Justice, of an incensed Prince: Amongst the Ruines of his Patrimony, these two places were comprehended, and upon his Shipwrack it returned to the Crown. And then King 
Henry
 the eighth, by a new Grant in the same year they escheated, passed them away to Sir 
John Baker
 of 
Sisingherst
 in 
Cranebroke,
 from whom they are now come down to Sir 
John Baker
 Baronet, his Successor.


Upper Peasridge
 was involved in that spatious Inheritance, which fell under the Dominion of the Lord 
Badelesmer,
 of whom I shall speak more at 
Leeds,
 and when he by his Disloyalty had forfeited both Life and Fortune to the Crown, this was enwrapt in the Escheat. But was restored in the second year of 
Edward
 the third to 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer
 this Mans Son, and he in the twelfth year of that Prince, held it at his Death, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 44. But 
Giles
 his only Son dying without Is∣sue, his great Estate was split into parcells, and this with some more of his Demeasne

was allotted to 
Mawd
 his Sister and Coheir, who was matched to 
John Vere
 Earl of 
Oxford,
 and he in her Right was possest of it at his Death, which was in the thirty fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 84. And in this Family did it reside untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then it was passed a∣way by Sale to 
St. Leger,
 to whose Patrimony it remained annexed untill the Go∣vernment of 
Philip
 and 
Mary;
 and then an Alienation like the former, brought it over to 
Lone,
 descended from the 
Lones
 of 
Lancashire,
 where there is yet a House of the Name: and being thus fixt in this Family, the Possession continues still united to it.


Fordwich
 in the Hundred of 
West-Gate,
 was given to the Abbot and Monks of St. 
Austins
 (as the Annalls of that Convent testifie) by King 
Edward
 the Confessor, and was given 
ad Vestitum,
 for Reparation of their Apparell. And there is a Tra∣dition, that 
Hemp-Hall
 which was an Appendage to this Mannor, did pay a quit-Rent in Hemp: but certainly it must be then for the use of those secular persons which related as Officers and Servants to this Cloister; for the Monks themselves being under the Rule of 
Bennet,
 harrowed their Skin with Shirts of Hair, and slept 
vestiti
 in their Apparell, the more to tame and controle the Mutinies and Dis∣orders of the Flesh. But to advance: After this Mannor (which the Piety of for∣mer Ages had planted in the Revenue of the Church) had for a large Decursion of Time owned no other Proprietary; it was by the Dissolution in the twenty ninth of 
Henry
 the eighth, emptied into the Income of the Crown, where it lay, untill 
Edward
 the sixth in the seventh year of his Reign, granted it to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney,
 and he not long after alienated his Concernment in it to 
John Johnson,
 from whom it came over by Purchase to 
Paramour,
 who passed it away to the Lady 
Elizabeth Finch,
 Widow of Sir 
Moile Finch,
 whose Son 
Thomas Finch
 Earl of 
Winchelsey,
 almost in our Memory passed it away to 
John Finch
 Baron of 
Ford∣wich,
 late Lord Keeper of the great Seal of 
England,
 in the year 1640, and in him does the instant Signory of it reside.


Folkstone
 does contribute a Name to the Hundred in which it is situated. The Mannor it self with the Mannor of 
Walton,
 was given to the Nunnery by 
Eadbald
 King of 
Kent,
 which it seems was of that Repute in those Times, that 
Eanswide
 his Daughter was there vailed a Nun, under the Rule of St. 
Bennet;
 and 
Ermen∣red
 and 
Ercombert
 his Sons, changed their hopes of a Crown, into those of one more celestiall, and folded up all their Earthly Glories in a Monastick Cowle, which they assumed at this place, under the Discipline of St. 
Bennet.
 But this Cloister was some Ages after, partly by the Fury of the 
Danes,
 and partly by the Impressions of the Sea, reduced into a heap of Ruines: so that in the Reign of 
William
 the Conquerour, 
William de Muneville
 laid the Foundations of a new Priory in another place of the Town; which was much augmented afterwards by 
William de Averenches,
 who had married his only Daughter. But it seems upon the former Devastation of this religious Seminary, the Mannor had returned to the Crown: for in the year one thousand thirty and eight, 
Canutus
 restored to 
Christ-church
 in 
Canterbury
 (as the Records of that Covent do intimate) this Mannor of 
Folkston;
 which 
Athelstan,
 Son of King 
Edward,
 in the year nine hun∣dred twenty and eight, had formerly granted to them for the health of his Fa∣thers Soul, and to the Honor of 
Ʋlfhelme
 Arch-priest of 
Canterbury,
 but with this Restriction, he limits and bounds this his Concession, that this Mannor thus returned to the Church, should never be alienated by the Arch-bishop without the Consent of the King and the Covent of 
Christ-church,
 who, it appears, joyned with 
William
 the Conquerour and the Archbishop of 
Canterbury,
 and fastned it a∣gain to this Priory, where it remained, untill it was torn away by the Suppression, in the Time of 
Henry
 the eighth, and annexed to the Crown: Afterwards that Prince, in the thirtieth year of his Reign, transplanted his Interest in it and 
Wal∣ton,
 by Grant into 
Edward
 Lord 
Clinton,
 and he the same year passed them away to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cromwell
 Earl of 
Essex,
 who being attainted in the thirty second year of the abovesaid Prince: the Propriety of 
Folkston
 and 
Walton,
 returned to

the Crown, and resided in the Royal Patrimony, untill the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 and then they were regranted to 
Edward
 Lord 
Clinton
 abovesaid, who not long after conveyed them to Mr. 
Henry Herdson,
 whose Grandchild Mr. 
Francis Herdson,
 alienated them to his Uncle Mr. 
John Herdson,
 about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 and he upon his Decease (without any lawfull Issue,) gave them to his Nephew, Sir 
Basill Dixwell
 Knight and Baronet, descended from the ancient Family of 
Dixwell
 in the North-riding of 
York-shire.
 Who likewise making his Ex∣it without any lawful Issue, 
Mark Dixwell
 Esquire his Nephew became his Heir, and from him is the Propriety of both these places descended to his Son and Heir, 
Ba∣sill Dixwell
 Esquire.


The Nunnery of 
Folkston
 abovesaid, being much defaced, was in the Time of 
Henry
 the third, reedified and reestablished by 
John de Clinton,
 and 
John de Se∣grave,
 and 
Julian
 his Wife; which was upon this second Erection stored with Nuns, who were to live as formerly, under the Rule of St. 
Bennet,
 and dedicated to St. 
Peter
 and St. 
Eanswith.
 But when it was found, in the second year of 
Henry
 the fifth, that it related by forrein Dependance to the Abby of 
Lolley
 in 
Normandy,
 it was by that prudent and cautious Monarch Supprest.


There were five Churches anciently in 
Folkston,
 three of which were dedicated to St. 
Peter,
 St. 
Mary,
 and St. 
Paul;
 all which and one more, whose Name is not now obvious, were long since by the Assaults of the Elements, and Devastations of men, utterly dismantled: only that which was erected in the year 1095. by 
Nigellus de Muneville,
 and devoted to St. 
Mary
 and St. 
Eanswith,
 hath been too hard a Morsel for the teeth of Time to consume.


Folkston
 had the Grant of a Market procured to be held here weekly on the Thursday, by the Mediation of 
Geffrey Fitz-Peter,
 in the sixth year of King 
John,
 which was confirmed to 
William de Averenches,
 in the sixteenth year of the above∣said Prince, and renewed to Sir 
John Segrave,
 in the twenty second year of 
Edw.
 the third.


Richard
 the second granted to Sir 
John Clinton,
 that a Market should be ob∣served weekly at 
Folkston,
 on the Wednesday, and a Fair yearly on the Vigil, and Day of St. 
Giles,
 as appears 
Pat.

Eabald
 King of 
Kent,
 about 1000 years since, built a Castle at the South part of this Town of 
Folkston,
 which being shrunk into Decay, 
William de Averenches
 erected a Fort in the year 1068, on the Foundation of the formerly demolished Pile, whose ruinous Shell or Skeleton is yet visible,


I have seen a Leafe by some injurious Hand torn out from the 
Leiger
 Book of 
Folkston,
 which sets forth the entertainment which the Family of 
Poynings
 were to have, when they came to hear Masse at the Priory; a subtle Artifice used by the Monks of that Age, to catch the Benevolence of the noblest and most opulent Families of the Nation, that certainly (had not the Statute of Mortmain, or Law of Amorti∣zation made in the seventh year of 
Edward
 the first, restrained and contracted the unlimited Bounty of the Laity to these religious Cloisters,) almost all the Land which was of secular Interest, had been ingulphed in the Revenue of the Church: so that as one well observes this over-active and operative Devotion, would have dedicated all to God, and have left Little or Nothing to have given to 
Caesar.


Terlingham
 and 
Ackhanger,
 were the Patrimony as high as the Reign of the Conquerour (as Doomsday instructs us) of 
William de Muneville,
 the Repairer and Restorer, if not Founder and Establisher of 
Folkston
 priory. By whose Daughter and Heir they devolved to 
William de Averenches,
 who had Issue 
William de Ave∣renches,
 in whom the male-line failed, so that 
Matilda de Averenches
 his Sole Heir by matching with 
Hamon de Crevequer,
 Baron 
Leeds
 Castle, made them parcel of his Demeasne: who by his Addition, so swelled his Estate, that he was styled the great Lord of 
Kent,
 and was of that Esteem in this County, that by a generall Consent and Councell of the Barons of the Cinque-ports, the Custody of the Sea-Coast from 
Hastings
 to 
Pool,
 was committed to his Care and Inspection, 
Pat.
 19. 
Hen. tertii Memb.
 14. And he held these Mannors at his Death, which was in the forty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 33. And left them to

his Son 
Hamon de Crevequer,
 who was enwrapt in the Faction and Rebellion of 
Simon de Montfort
 Earl of 
Leicester,
 raised against 
Henry
 the third; but was, by that Act of Oblivion and Clemency, styled 
Dictum de Kenilworth,
 passed by that Prince in the fiftieth year of his Reign, called to 
Mercie,
 and to most part of his Estate, excepting 
Leeds-Castle, Bersted, Chetham,
 and some other peices, but dyed without Issue; so that 
Eleanor
 matched to 
Bertram de Crioll, Juliana
 first matched to 
Nicholas de Sandwich,
 and secondly to 
Roger de Segrave,
 and two o∣thers who were wedded to 
Lenham,
 and 
Pateshull,
 became, as they were his four Sisters, his four Coheirs. And upon the partition of the Estate, these two Man∣nors came over to be the Patrimony of 
Crioll,
 and 
Bertram de Crioll
 above men∣tioned held them at his Death, which was in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 48. And left them to 
John
 his only Son, who dying Childlesse, 
Joan
 his Sister matched to Sir 
Richard de Rokesley,
 became his Heir: but he determining likewise in a Female Heir called 
Joan,
 she by espousing Sir 
Thomas de Poynings,
 Father of 
Michaell de Poynings
 of 
Terlingham,
 raunged these places under the Demeasn of that Family, in which they remained, untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh: and then Sir 
Edward Poynings,
 gave them in Dower, with 
Mary
 his natural Daughter to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Clinton,
 whose Son 
Edw.
 Lord 
Clinton,
 about the Beginning of Queen 
Mary,
 by Sale passed them away to 
Herdson,
 from whom by Testament they came over to 
Dixwell,
 in which Family the Possession of them is still permanent.


Morehall
 is a small Mannor in this Parish, to which, 
William de Valentia
 obtained a Charter of Priviledges, in the twenty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third. After him I find the 
Morehalls
 to be Possessors of it, who ingrafted their own Name upon it, and 
John de Morehall,
 paid respective Aid, at the making the Black Prince Knight, for his Mannor of 
Morehall,
 in the twentieth of 
Edward
 the third. After this Family was extinct, the 
Bakers
 of 
Caldham,
 about the Reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, were invested in the Possession, and not many years after, 
Brandred
 by one of the Coheirs of 
Baker,
 became Lord of the Fee: from which Family, by Sale, it passed away to Sir 
Thomas Brown,
 from whom descended Sir 
Mathew Brown
 Knight, who in our Grand-fathers Memory conveyed his Right in it to 
Godman,
 who is still Lord of the Fee.


Hope-House
 in 
Folkston,
 belonged to the 
Houghams,
 a noble and knightly Fami∣ly inhabiting at 
Hougham
 not far distant, and 
Robert de Hougham
 dyed seised of it in the forty first year of 
Henry
 the third. In the Reign of 
Edward
 the second, I find the 
Clintons
 possest of it, and 
William de Clinton
 Earl of 
Huntington,
 dyed seised of it in the twenty eighth year of 
Edward
 the third: and from him it descended to his Kinsman 
John de Clinton,
 great Grandfather to 
John
 Lord 
Clinton,
 who about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, sold it away to 
Davis,
 from which Family by a Daughter, and partly by Purchase: it came over to 
Lessington,
 and he in our Fathers Remembrance, alienated his Concernment in it to 
Hopday,
 whose Son is the instant Possessor of it.


Bredmer
 or 
Berdmer,
 is the last place worthy any Consideration. It is partly situ∣ated in 
Folkston,
 and partly in 
Cheriton;
 that there was a Family of this Name, was most certain. For in ancient Deeds and Court Rolls of 
Valoigns,
 who was Lord of 
Che∣riton
 after 
Scotton:
 I find frequent mention of severall of this Name, who held Land of this Family. But in the Book of 
Aid,
 I find 
William de Brockhull
 held the fourth part of a Knights Fee in 
Cheriton,
 which was this, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third. From this Name by 
Elizabeth
 Heir of 
Thomas Brock∣hull,
 it came to be the possession of 
Richard Selling
 Esquire, and here it rested untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was passed away to 
Edmund Inmith,
 a Retainer to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Clinton,
 who gave it to his second Son 
Edmund Inmith,
 and he was extinguished in two Daughters and Coheirs: one was married to 
Reyner,
 and the other to 
Baker,
 who in her Right shared this place, and in the Reign of King 
James,
 passed it away by Sale to 
Ben,
 who holds the instant Possession of it.

 so called from the deep Channel of 
Ravens-purg'd.
 The River that here slydeth into the

 was heretofore called 
West-Greenwich,
 from the turning of the River 
Thames
 in such a crooked Compass, and the green Meddows adjacent. 
Gislebert Magminot
 or 
Magminiot,
 for he was a great Favorite to 
William
 the Conquerour, was one of those eight Barons and Trustees, that were joyned to 
John de Fiennes,
 for the sure Guard of 
Dover Castle,
 and were assigned competent Lands for the maintenance of that Service: his Castle or Scite of his Barony, hath been long time buryed in its own Ruines, yet some remains of Stony Foundations, make me conjecture it stood nere 
Says Court
 in 
Bromfield,
 upon the Brow of the 
Thames
 Bank neere the 
Mast Dock
 where the Skeleton of Sir 
Francis Drake
's Ship was layd up, and in a very short time nothing left of her: but the Fame of her Captain and Steersman, cannot perish, so long as History shall last.


But to return to the former Subject, it may appear by the Quire of 
Dover Castle,
 transmitted on Record in the King's Exchequer, that it had the Reputation of a Barony and these Knights Fees were held of it.

You may find mention of 
Walkelme Magminot,
 in the Catalogue of the Lord Wardens. But the Daughter and Heir of this Line, was married to 
Say,
 from whom it came to be called 
Says-Court,
 which Name it still retaineth: And was by reason of the Commodiousnesse of the Meadows belonging to it, and Stalls there erected, made a place, in the Time of the late King, for feeding Sheep and Oxen, served by Composition for the Kings House.

 and by

 is ment the upper Town, where a fair strong Stone Bridge, lately erected, doth acknowledge the sole Royal bounty of K. 
Charles,
 by this Inscription.


This Bridge was re-edified at the only charge of King 
Charles,
 in the fourth year of his Reign, 
Anno Dom.
 1628. In former Times it w as repaired at the Charge of the Contry adjacent. For I find by a Record in the

The Treasurer of the Navy, hath here a commendable and convenient House for his Residence at the Dock, to view the building and repayring the States Ships and what is most expedient for the Manufacture of Cordage, Anchors, and other Provisions for Ships, by which means the Town is so greatly increased in small Tenements, and the Statute for Cottages, excepting Market-Towns, and such pla∣ces as are used for building of Ships, that for number of Inhabitants and Com∣municants, it may compare with diverse Counties in the Kingdome: which great Increase of the Parish, caused them to new build another Isle on the North-side the Church, to which the East-Indian Company of Merchants were good Bene∣factors, And the Chancel enlarged with beautifull Additions, partly at the Cost of Sir 
William Russell
 Knight and Baroner, Treasurer of the Navy, and the cir∣cumspection of Doctor 
Valentine,
 the late learned and worthy Incumbent of the place.


Adjoyning to the Church, The Company of Navigators and Seamen, incorpo∣rated by King 
Henry
 the eighth, have a Hall or House for their meetings and Consultations. Certainly the use of this Society, is most considerable and com∣mendable: for the Common-wealth, upon all Occasions, may from them receive necessary Intelligence of all the Roads, Waterings, Depths, and Conveniences, of most part of the Maritime places in the Known World.


One thing more I have to mention: and that is 
Hacham,
 which was, in K. 
Hen.
 the seconds Time, the Seat of 
Hacham,
 lying upon the Confines of 
Kent
 and 
Kent-fields
 or 
Kent-lands,
 within this County; as 
Kent-Hatch
 in 
Westerham,
 is the very out-side of this Shire: As that place towards 
Surrey,
 called 
Kent-House,
 designs the Bounderies of this County, between 
Bekenham
 and 
Croydon.
 Divers Inqui∣sitions, taken since that time, have found 
Hacham
 to be in 
Kent.


And I believe the Mannor of 
Bredingherst,
 before mentioned, was formerly in this Shire, which is now slipt into 
Surrey
 at 
Peckham Rey,
 in 
Camberwell.
 The Reception of Prisoners, from the County of 
Surrey,
 being for a good Space u∣sed to be at 
New Cross,
 hath begot an opinion, that there was the out-side of 
Kent:
 but those that will justly denote the 
Ambitus
 and Bounds, must not think it begins at 
Kent-street,
 because it is so called of the Road-way into 
Kent.
 Nor that 
Kentish Town
 by 
High-gate,
 is part of this Shire, though it pertake of the Customes of Gavel-kind. Nor at Sir 
Thomas Waterings,


 where the Pilgrims to St. 
Thomas
 of 
Canterbury,
 that disobedient and pertinacious Arch-bishop, watered their Horses. But a small Bridge beyond 
Hatcham,
 in the Road to 
London,
 neere which is a Road or Way to 
Bredingherst,
 which by an Inquisition, taken in the seventh of King 
Richard
 the second, appeareth to be in 
Kent.


In the forty third of 
Edward
 the third, it appears, that the Mannor of 
Hachesham,
 was granted to the Prioresse of 
Dertford,


 and many parcels of Land that came by Escheat, as held of that Mannor, lying in 
Surrey,
 after the Death of 
Jo.
 the Son of 
Jo. Adam,
 were confirmed to that Foundation by the King: all which returning into the Hands of 
Henry
 the eighth, upon the publike Suppression, this Mannor, with its Appendages, was for ever setled by the Crown, on the Company or Brother-hood of the 
Haberdashers
 in 
London.


East-Greenwich
 is the next Town to 
Detford,
 so called, because it standeth more East-ward then the other, formerly spoken of. In Latin named 
Viridis Sinus,
 in Saxon 
Grenawic,
 that is, the Green Town, upon the Turning Creeke of the Ri∣ver.


In the Time of the 
Danes
 Invasion, they often made their Road at this place, and made it remarkable, by their Cruelty, shewed unto 
Ealphege
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury:
 whom in the year of our Lord, a thousand and twelve, they cruelly executed with most exquisite Torments, whose Death together with the cause there∣of 
Ditmarius Mersepurgius,
 who about the same time lived, hath thus, in the eighth Book of his Chronicles described. I understood (saith he) by the relation of

Sewald,
 a pitifull Deed, and therefore memorable, namely, that the perfidious Crew of Norman Souldiers, under 
Thurkill,
 as yet their Captain, took that excellent Prelate, Arch-bishop of the Citty of 
Canterbury,
 named 
Ealphege,
 with the rest, and them after their wicked manner imprisoned and bound, yea and put him to endure Famine, and unspeakable pains. This good man moved with humane Frailty, promiseth unto them a Summe of Money, and for the obtaining there∣of, did set down a Time between. That if in this Space, he could not by some acceptable Ransome, escape this momentary Death, he might yet in the mean while purge himself with many a Grone, to be offered as a lively Sacrifice unto the Lord.


But when as the Time and space appointed were come and gon, this greedy Gulph of Pirats, called forth the Servant of the Lord, and in threatning-wise demand this Tribute promised unto them, to be speedily and out of hand paid. Then he, as a Meek lamb, Here am I, quoth he; ready to undergo, (even for the Love of Christ) whatsoever ye presume now to do against me, that I may deserve to become an example of his Servants: and nothing am I troubled at this day. And whereas I seem unto you a Lyer, it is not my own Will, but great need and Poverty that hath done it: This body of mine, which in this Exile I have loved over much, I present as culpable unto you; and I know it is in your Power, to do with it what yee intend: but my sinfull Soul, that regardeth not you, I hum∣bly commend to the Creator of all things. As he was thus speaking, the whole Rabble of these prophane Wretches hemmed him round about, and getteth to∣gether diverse and sundry weapons to kill him: which when their Leader 
Thurkill
 saw a far off, he came quickly running, and crying, do not so I beseech you, and here with my whole heart, I deliver unto you all my Gold and Silver, and whatsoever I have here, or can by any means come by, save my Ship only, that you would not sin against the Lord's annointed. But this unbridled anger of his Mates harder then Iron and Flint, was nothing mollified with so gentle Words, and fair Lan∣guage of his, but became only pacified by shedding his innocent blood, which present∣ly they altogether confounded and bleanded with Ox-heads, Stons as thick as Hail, and Billets hurled at him.


And to the memory of this said 
Ealphege,
 is the Parish Church here consecrated. But far more splendid hath this sumptuous Pallace been, ever since 
Humphrey Duke
 of 
Gloucester,
 Brother to King 
Henry
 the fifth, builded the same, and called it 
Placence;
 And likewise the Castle, and inclosed the Park: For doing them both, he had the King's Charter XI. 
Hen.

 For it was not lawfull for any man to fortifie his House, or raise a Castle or place of Defence without Licence from the Crown, for Fear of inward Sedition: and was therefore inqui∣rable before the Escheator in the twenty fourth Article of his Office. 
Item de Castellis & Dominicis Karnellatis sine Regis licencia.
 The word having its deriva∣tion from 
Charneux,
 whichin French signifieth the indented Form of the Top of a Wall, which hath vent and crest, commonly called Imbattelling, because it was very serviceable in fight to the Defendant within, who might at the loops or lower places, and other cranies in the Walls and Bulworkes, annoy the Enemy, that as∣sayled the same, and might also shroud himself under the higher Parts thereof.


Afterward King 
Edward
 the fourth, bestowed some cost, to enlarge this work. 
Henry
 the seventh, followed and beautified the House, with the Addition of the Brick Front to the water side. But King 
Henry
 the eighth, as he exceeded all his Progenitors in setting up sumptuous Houses, so he spared no Cost in Garnishing 
Greenwich.


Queen 
Ann,
 in the time of King 
James,
 builded that new Brick-work towards the Garden, and laid the Foundation of the House of Delight, towards the Park, which Queen 
Mary,
 hath so finished and furnished, that it far surpasseth all other of that kind in 
England.


In Memory of the many Camps that have been here, Certain places within this Parish, are called 
Combes,
 namely 
East-Combe,
 where that godly good Gen∣tleman

William Lambert
 Esquire dwelt, that gave us the first Description of this Country, in his Perambulation, and made this work the more easy to any, that should endevour further Progresse therein; 
Facile est inventis addere, difficile inve∣nire.


Westcombe
 with its Appendant Members, related to the noble Family of 
Bade∣lesmer,
 and upon the Attainder of 
artholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 escheating to the Crown, they lay clasped up in its Revenue; untill King 
Richard
 the second gran∣ted them to Sir 
Robert Belknap
 the Judge; upon whose Attainder, they were gran∣ted in Fee to 
Robert Ballard
 Esquire 
Pincernae suo
 his grand Boteler. That is the Man∣nors of 
Westcombe,
 and 
Spittlecombe
 in 
Greenwich,
 two Watermills in 
Detford,
 with their Appurtenances in 
Charlton
 and 
Writle-mersh,
 after which that Name, conti∣nued a long time in this place, of whom you may read more among the Sheriffs of 
Kent,
 untill about the fourth of 
Philip
 and 
Mary, Westcombe
 was altenated by 
Nicholas Ballard,
 to 
John Lambert
 Esquire, whose Successor 
Thomas Lambert,
 not many years since, alienated it to 
Hugh Forth:
 from whom it is lately gon over by Sale, to Mr...... 
Biddulph
 of 
London.


Soon after the Conquest, this 
Greenwich,
 was parcell of the Possessions of the Bishop of 
Liseux
 in 
France,
 and bore Service, to 
Odo
 then Bishop of 
Baieux,
 and Earl of 
Kent.
 After, the Mannor belonged to the Abbot of St. 
Petres
 of 
Gaunt
 in 
Flanders,
 till such time, as King 
Henry
 the fifth, seising in∣to his Hands (by occasion of War) the lands of the Priors Aliens, bestowed it together with the Mannor of 
Lewsham,
 and many other Lands also, upon the Priory of the Brotherhood to the Monks of 
Shene
 which he had then newly erected, to which it remained till the Time of King 
Henry
 the eighth, who annexed it to the Crown, unto which it now belongeth, and is called the Honor 
East-Greenwich.


Queen 
Mary
 and Queen 
Elizabeth,
 were both born here; and King 
Edward
 the sixth, a Miracle of Princely Towardnesse, ended his Life, in the same House.


King 
Edward
 the third, 1376, in the fifty first year of his Reign founded the Religious House of Friers Aliens, or Dominican Friers. Sir 
John Norbury
 Knight, high Treasurer of 
England,
 is reckoned a Benefactor to the same, after the Disso∣lution of this House, and its Annexion to 
Shene
 by King 
Henry
 the eighth.


Another House of observant Friers was erected here, by King 
Edward
 the fourth, as we read in 
Jo. Rosse. Circiter Annum Regni Edwardi quarti, venerunt Fratres ob∣servantes Ordinis Minorum ad Greenwich, & habebant Cantariam & Capellam Sancti Crucis.
 And King 
Henry
 the seventh, builded that House for them adjoyning to the Pallace, which is yet there to be seen.


There are moreover in the Town, two Colledges or Almes houses, for the Susten∣tation of poor Persons, the one builded by 
William Lambert
 Esquire, which he named the Colledge of Queen 
Elizabeths
 poor People, and as the Prying Adver∣saries of out Religion then observed, was the first Protestant that built an Hos∣pital.


The other standing by 
Thames
-side, was founded by 
Henry Howard,
 Earl of 
Northampton
 Lord Privy Seal, Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, and Knight of the Garter. And inlarged and Beautified the Castle, (which is famous in the Spanish Fables) from whence there is a most fair and pleasant Prospect open to the Ri∣ver, winding in and out, almost redoubling of it self, the green Medows and Marshes underlying the Citty of 
London,
 and Country round about. Described by 
Berkley
 in his 
Euphormio.


And also for a 
L'env'oy
 to 
Greenwich,
 you may read the Verses of 
Leland
 the 
Anti∣quarian
 Poet adjoyning to 
Greenwich. Blackheath,
 of which the Hundred taketh the name, so called of the colour of the Earth, or Bleacheath of the high and cold Situation, for bleak signifieth cold. Also 
Campus Martis,
 it may well be cal∣led: for besides the Burthen of the Danish Camps, it hath born three rebellious Assemblies. One in the time of King 
Richard
 the second, Moved, as shall be farther declared in 
Offham,
 by 
John Tylar,
 whom 
William Walworth,
 then Maior of 
London,
 slew with his Dagger in 
Smithfield,
 and thereupon, upon the Tradition

comes, that the City had given them, for an Augmentation to their 
Eschochen,
 a Dag∣ger in the Dexter-point or Canton, so to be born by them for ever.


Jack Cade
 that Counterfeit 
Mortimer,
 and his Crew, conducted the second, who araying themselves here, and passed to 
London,
 where they did to Death the Lord 
Say,
 and others, and executed their malice upon the Records and Monuments of the Law; Burning down the Office of Armes, which was then kept at 
Cole-Harbour,
 burning, destroying their Rolls, Registers, and Books of Armory; Their main Drift and Design, being to bring in Parity.


And their Insurrection was here assembled, by 
Michaell Joseph
 Black-smith, and the Lord 
Audley,
 under the Reign of King 
Henry
 the seventh; at which time they and their Complices received their just Desert: the Common Numbers of them, being discomfited and slain, and the Leaders themselves, taken, drawn and hanged.


Of this last, there remaineth yet, to be seen upon the Heath, the place of the Smith's Tent, called commonly his Forge; and of all, there the great grave-Hills of such as were buryed, after the overthrow. These Hills, in the West-Country, upon diverse Champions and Plains (where is no small Store of the Like) are called 
Barowes,
 of the old English word 
Burghes;
 which last word, melted into Buryings, (being a Spring of the old Stock) we do yet retain alive.


The first and last of these Commotions were stirred of Griese, the Common people conceived for the Demand of two Subsidies. Of which the one was un∣reasonable, because it was taxed upon the Polls, and exempted none. The other was unseasonable, for that it was exacted, when the heads of the common people were full of 
Perkin Warbeck.


The third and middlemost, grew upon a grudge, that the People took for yielding the Dutchie of 
Aniou,
 and 
Maine,
 to the King of 
Sicily:
 The coming of whose Daughter, (after that the King would needs have her to Wife, notwithstanding, his precontract made with the Earl of 
Armenac
) was not so joyfully embraced, by the Citizens of 
London
 upon 
Blackheath,
 wearing their red Hoods, Badges, and blew Gowns, as in Sequele the Marriage and whole Government it self, was known to be detested of the Country Commons, by bearing in the same place, Harnesse, Bowes, Bills, and other Weapons. Thus far, the Story of 
Blackheath
 proves but sad and tragical: That which remains, is of a more glorious and splendid condi∣tion, consisting of Ovations and Triumphs; for when the Emperour of 
Constan∣tinople,
 came to require Aid against the Turks, King 
Henry
 the fourth, with all Princely respect, went to meet him at this place, and so conducted him to 
London.
 And when King 
Henry
 the fifth, returned from his victorious Conquest of 
France,
 the Lord Maior and Citizens of 
London,
 went forth in their best Equi∣page, to attend his Reception at this place, at which time the King made many Knights Bannerets; And K. 
Hen.
 the eighth, that excelled in all Triumphal matters met 
Anne Cleve,
 daughter to the Dake of 
Cleve.


Graveney
 in the Hundred of 
Boughton,
 was in the year of our Lord eight hun∣dred and eleven, by Archbishop 
Ʋlfred,
 bought of King 
Kenwolfe,
 (as the Book of 
Christ-church,
 sets it forth,) 
ad opus Ecclesiae Christi,
 to the repair of the Cathe∣dral. In the year of 
Grace
 eight hundred and thirty, 
Werhardus
 a Priest of much Power in 
England,
 (by the injunction of the Arch-bishop) gave 
Graveney
 to the Monks of 
Christ-church,
 which had been before snatched away, and then passed under the Notion of thirty two Hides; and if you will see how it was rated, in 
Dooms-day
 Book, it is thus there represented: 
Graveney, est Manerium Monachorum, & est de Vestitu eorum, quod Richardus Constabularius tenet in Feodo de Archiepiscopo, & tamen reddit firmam Monachis, & pro
 1 
Sulling se defen∣dit.
 This Mannor by the Successive Proprietaries, was held in Fee, of the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury.


Here was a Family called 
Gravenell,
 who were Lords of this Mannor, which 
John de Gravenell,
 dyed possest of, in the fifty sixth year of 
Henry
 the third. Afterwards I find the 
Fevershams,
 a Family so called, held it. 
Richard Feversham
 was seised of it at his Death, which was in the thirteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot.

Esc. Num.
 100. But deceased without Issue-male, so that his only Daughter 
Joan
 matched to 
John Boteler
 became his Heir. This 
John Boteler,
 was high Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the twenty second year of 
Richard
 the second. But dyed likewise with∣out Issue-male, so that his Estate here, which devolved to him by Female Right, by the same Fate, was carried away to 
John Martin,
 one of the Judges of the Common-Pleas, who married 
Ann
 his Sole Heir, and this Man lyes buryed in 
Graveney
 Church, under a Fair Stone inlaid with Brasse, and his Pourtraicture insculped thereon, with this Inscription affixed. 
Hîc jacet Joannes Martin, Justi∣ciarius de communi Banco, qui obiit
 24 
Octobris,
 1436, 
& Anna Uxor ejus.
From 
Martin,
 the Propriety of that Estate here, which had been diverse years entitu∣led to this Name, went by Purchase into 
Pordage
 of 
Rodmersham,
 in which Family the Possession hath for several Generations been constantly resident.


Gravesend
 in the Hundred of 
Toltingtrow,
 was anciently the Possession of a Fa∣mily called 
Cramavill,
 who had likewise very considerable Possessions in 
East-Kent. Henry de Cramavill,
 held it at his Death, which was in the fifty fourth year of 
Henry
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 8. And 
Joan,
 Wife, I believe, of 
Henry de Cra∣mavill,
 was seised of it at her Decease, which was in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 53. After this Family was gon out, I find the Lord of the Fee, to be 
Reginald de Cobham,
 who was in Possession of it at his Death, which was in the forty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 15. and in Ages of a lower Step, another 
Reginald Cobham,
 was seised of it, in the seventh year of 
Henry
 the fourth: and from him, by the Heir Generall it came down, to 
Bray∣brook:
 and by the Heir general of that Family, it was transmitted to 
Brook,
 of the County of 
Somerset,
 from whom descended the infortunate 
Henry Brook,
 Lord 
Cobham,
 who being attainted in the Beginning of King 
James,
 forfeited this Mannor to the Crown: in whose Revenue it lay involved, untill the late K. 
Charles
 granted it to his Kinsman 
James
 Duke of 
Lenox,
 upon whose late Decease, it is now become the Inheritance of his Son 
Esme
 Duke of 
Lenox,
 now in his Minority.


Milton
 neer 
Gravesend,
 in the Hundred of 
Shamell,
 was an Ingredient which made up that Estate, which fell under the Signory of the 
Montchenseys,
 Lords and Barons of 
Swanscamp. Warren de Montchensey,
 obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of 
Milton,
 in the thirty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third, and he had Issue 
William de Montchensey,
 who held it at his Death, which was in the fifty se∣cond year of 
Henry
 the third: and left it to 
Dionis
 his Female Inheritrix, wed∣ded to 
Hugh de Vere,
 by whom she having no Issue, that might transmit the Possession to his Family; the Interest of it was, by 
Joan,
 Sister and Coheir of the abovementioned 
William,
 knit to the Patrimony of her Husband, 
Aymer de Valence
 Earl of 
Pembroke;
 whose Son 
William de Valence
 dying without Issue, 
Isabell
 his Sister and Coheir, being wedded to 
Lawrence de Hastings,
 afterwards Earl of 
Pem∣broke,
 united it to his Demeasn, and his Grandchild 
John de Hastings,
 about the beginning of 
Richard
 the second, passed it away to Sir 
Simon de Burley,
 who be∣ing attainted of high Treason, in the tenth of his Rule, because, according to his Oath, being Knight of the Garter, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, he endevoured to underprop, like some Butteresse, the sinking Prerogative of his Master, against the onsets of some of the ambitious Nobility, it escheated to the Crown. And then the aforesaid King, in the fourteenth year of his Government, granted it to 
John Holland
 Earl of 
Huntington;
 and he not long after conveyed it by Sale, to 
Reginald Cobham,
 whose Widow, 
Elizabeth
 was remarried to 
William Clifford
 Esquire, and he in her Right, I find, was possest of it in the ninth year of 
Henry
 the fourth. But after his Death, it reverts to 
Braybrook,
 who had mat∣ched with 
Joan
 the Heir general of 
Cobham,
 and he determining likewise in an Heir general, matched to 
Brook,
 of the West-country, it devolved with 
Cobham,
 to acknowledge the Signiory of that Family, but continued not long in their Pos∣session: for about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the fourth, I find it in the Tenure of 
Robert Brent,
 from whom it descended to his Son 
William Brent,
 who in the eighth year of King 
Henry
 the seventh, conveyed it to Sir 
Henry Wiatt;
 and from him

did it come down to his Grandchild Sir 
Thomas Wiatt,
 who being attainted in the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 it escheated by Confiscation to the Crown, and then it was granted to 
George Brook
 Lord 
Cobham,
 and went along with that Family, untill the beginning of King 
James,
 and then 
Henry
 Lord 
Brook
 having embarked himself in the unhappy Design of Sir 
Walter Rauleigh,
 was atrainted of high Trea∣son, and his Concernment in this Mannor, was forfeited to the Crown, and was, not many years after, by the above-mentioned Prince, granted to Mr. 
George Tucker
 of 
Gravesend;
 whose Grandchild Mr. 
George Tucker,
 hath lately passed away all his In∣terest here to Mr...... 
Hamon,
 of Queenhith in 
London.


Parrocks
 is likewise situated within the Circle of 
Gravesend,
 and had owners of that Sirname, as is evident by an ancient Record, which testifies, that 
Robert de Par∣rock,


 obtained a Market, weekly on the Saturday, and a Fair yearly to endure for the Space of three Days, 
viz.
 the Vigil, the Day of St. 
Edmund,
 and the day after, in the fifty second year of 
Henry
 the third. Afterwards, this Mannor was linked to the Revenue of the Crown, but whether it was thus annexed by Sale, or by Exchange, I confesse, I am ignorant: only I find by the original Patent, that in the sixth year of 
Richard
 the second, it was granted to Sir 
Simon de Bur∣ley;
 upon whose Attaint, in the tenth year of the abovesaid Prince, it devolved to the Crown, and 
Richard
 the second, not long after, setled it on the Abby of St. 
Mary Grace
 on 
Tower-Hill,
 in whose Revenue it remained untill King 
Henry
 the eighth tore it off by the Publique Dissolution, and united it to the Royall Re∣venue, where it had its fixed aboad, untill the thirteenth year of King 
James:
 and then it was granted to Mr. 
William Salter;
 who not many years after, passed it away to Mr. 
James Crispe;
 from whom in our Memory, partly by Purchase, and partly by Exchange, it went over to Mr. 
Jo. Child,
 in whose Descendant the Pro∣priety is still permanent.


Gravesend,
 had anciently a Market on the Thursday, and a Fair yearly on the Day of St. 
Edward
 the Confessor, both granted to this Town, in the thirtieth year of 
Edward
 the third.


Gillingham,
 was a Mannor always relating to the Arch-bishops of 
Canterbury,
 though the Donation by the Book of 
Christ-church
 be not specified. If we sur∣vey the Pages of 
Dooms-day
 Book, they will give us this: 
Gilling ham est proprium Manerium Archiepiscopi, & in tempore Ewardi Regis se defendebat pro
 VI. 
Sullings, & est appretiatum hoc quod Archiepiscopus habet inde in Dominio
 VIII. 
lb.
 
&c
 X.s. The Arch-bishops of 
Canterbury,
 had here an eminent Pallace, and held their Re∣sidence at it, and gave Consecrations here to Bishops, as we find it recorded in the Book called 
Textus Roffensis,
 or, the Text of 
Rochester.


East-court,
 and 
West-court
 in this Parish, were anciently knit together, and resided in a Family called 
Gillingham. Richard de Gillingham,
 Son of 
Thomas de Gillingham,
 held it at his Death, which was in the twelfth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 176. And left it to his Son 
Thomas Gillingham,
 who resolved into two Daughters and Coheirs; 
Margaret
 married to 
John Thorpe,
 who in her Right, had 
West-court;
 and 
Isabell,
 matched to 
William Crensted,
 who brought along with her 
East-court.
 But as all things have their Fate and Vicissitude, they did not long acknowledge the Dominion of either of them; for 
Thorpe
 sold 
West-court
 to 
Ni∣cholas Lawson,
 of 
Whoorn-place
 in 
Cuckston,
 who not long after, by the same De∣volution, passed it away to 
Duling
 of 
Rochester,
 by whose Female Heir, it is now come over to Mr. 
Stephen Alcock:
 but 
Thorp; Ferme,
 on which he had planted his own Name, he alienated to 
Short,
 and from this Family it went away again by Sale to 
May
 of 
Rochester. Greensted
 endowed 
Benedict Webb,
 his Sisters Son, and in that Relation his Heir, with the Title and Propriety of 
East-court,
 whose two Grand-children 
Thomas
 and 
Christopher Webb,
 by a mutuall and joynt Concur∣rence, devested themselves of their Right, and by Sale surrendered it up to 
Will. Painter
 Esquire, Great Grand-father to Mr. 
Allington Painter,
 the instant Proprie∣tary of it.


Twidall,
 is another Mannor of eminent Account, and had Owners likewise of that Appellation. The first, that I find of the Name, in Mr. 
Painter
's Evidences, which held both this and 
Dane-court,
 is 
Robert de Twidall,
 and he slourished here

about the Reign of 
Henry
 the first, and he had Issue 
Adam de Twidall,
 from whom was lineally extracted, 
Richard de Twidall:
 who in the fourth year of 
Richard
 the second, passed away this, and 
Dane-court,
 to 
John,
 the Son of 
Robert de Beaufitz,
 originally descended from 
Reade
 in 
Marden.
 But in this Family, the Possession was not very permanent, for in some Descents after, the Name went out into into 
Joan Beaufitz
 and other Coheirs: and she by matching with 
Robert Arnold
 of 
Sussex,
 did enstate the Possession of both these places, upon this Name and Fami∣ly, and he bequeathed them as Dower, to his Daughter 
Elizabeth Arnold:
 and shee, in the thirteenth year of 
Henry
 the seventh, conveys them over to her Bro∣ther 
Henry;
 and his Son 
William Arnold,
 in the eighteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, transports his Right in them by Sale to 
Thomas Benolt Clarenceux
 King of Arms: from whom the like Conveyance, in the twentieth year of that Prince, brought itto Sir 
Hen. Wiatt,
 one of the Privie Councel, to 
Hen.
 the 8, whose Son Sir 
Tho. Wiat,
 in the thirtieth year of that King, exchanged them for other Lands with the Crown: from which immediately after they were conveyed by Grant to 
Christopher Sampson,
 who not many years after, transplanted his Interest by Sale, into 
Thomas Parker:
 who conveyed away his Right in 
Twidall,
 to 
William Pain∣ter
 Esquire, great Grand-father to Mr. 
Allington Painter,
 who now enjoys it: but 
Dane∣court,
 was by Purchase brought over to 
Short,
 in whom it had not long continued, but the same Fatality carried it away to 
May
 of 
Rochester.


The 
Grange
 in this Parish, sometimes written 
Grench,
 did in the Conquerours time, appertain to the old Lords called 
Hastings,
 Ancestors of the Lord 
Hastings
 now Earl of 
Huntington.
 In the Book called 
Testa de Nevill,
 kept in the Exchequer we read that one 
Manasser de Hastings,
 held 
Grench
 by Serjeanty under King 
Hen.
 the third, and the particular Office, in some more modern Records is described, 
viz.
 that it is held of the King (and not of the Cinque-ports as some do suggest) by Serjeanty, to find two men and two Oars in the Ship, which carries over the King from 
Dover
 to 
Whitesand
 by 
Callis.
 From 
Hastings,
 it came over by Purchase to 
Richard Smelt
 Alderman of 
London:
 whose Daughter and Heir 
Margaret Smelt
 carried it away to 
Richard Croyden
 likewise an Alderman of 
London:
 in whom the male-line failing, 
Margery
 his Sole Heir was matched to 
John Philipott
 Esquire, Alderman of 
London
 in the Reign of 
Edward
 the third, and Lord Maior of 
London,
 in the Reign of 
Richard
 the second, by which Prince he was invested with the Order of Knighthood, for being so signally instrumental in the Ruine of 
Wat Tiler, Jack Straw
 and his seditious Complices, and had after the Addition of 
Gules,
 A 
plain Crosse
 between four 
Swords
 Argent, 
Pomell'd, Or,
 as a Coat of Augmentation annexed to his Paternal Coat, 
viz. Sable
 a 
Bend Ermin,
 for setting out a Fleet of Ships, at his own expence, and vanquishing 
John Mercer,
 and his pi∣ratical Rabble, who had so infested the narrow Sea, that the Trade of the Mer∣chant, was brought into a deplorable Condition; and had sunk, had he not buoyd it up again, by his Care and Magnanimity. Yet how laudable soever the work were, it escaped not the Envy of 
John
 of 
Gaunt
 Duke of 
Lancaster,
 who questio∣ned him at the Couucel-Board, for that he being a private Person, had embar∣ked himself in an Attempt of so much Concernment, without Order and Licence first obtained by the State: but by the noble Favour he received from his hono∣rable Friends there, especially 
Rychard Fitzallan
 Earl of 
Arundell,
 whose Arms he placed in his House, as a Monument of Gratitude, and left him a Legacie in his Will, he was fetched off with Reputation. But to proceed, in Right of the for∣mer Alliance, he was planted in the Possession of this Mannor, and from him it devolved to his Grandchild 
John Philipott
 Esquire. And he in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the sixth, exchanged this Mannor with Sir 
Richard Bamme,
 Son of 
Adam Bamme,
 Lord Maior of 
London,
 for 
Twiford
 in 
Middlesex,
 and from him it descen∣ded to 
John Bamme
 Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the second year of 
Richard
 the third. And he gave it to his Daughter 
Katharine Bamme,
 who passed it away by Grant to 
Kempe
 and 
Wiatt.
 Sir 
Thomas Kempe
 sold his moiety to Sir 
Thomas Wiatt,
 who ha∣ving forfeited this to the Crown, by his unhappy Defection in the second year of Q. 
Mary,
 it lodged in the royal Revenue, untill Queen 
Elizabeth
 in the twenty fourth year of her Rule granted it back again, to the Lady 
Joan Wiatt,
 and her Son

George Wiatt
 Esq; who in our Fathers memory, alienated it to 
Hayward:
 from which Name by the Heir Generall of this Family, it is lately brought to acknow∣ledge Mr. 
Will. De Lawn
 of 
London
 for its present Proprietary. There was a Chappel belonging to 
Grench,
 which upon the Inquisition returned into the Court of Augmentation; but upon the Suppression in the Reign of 
Hen.
 the eighth, was affir∣med to have been erected by Sir 
John Philipott.
 I confesse I have seen no other Record, to evince any thing to the Contrary, and therefore I acquiesce in that Testimony.


Ʋpbery
 is the last Mannor in 
Gillingham,
 which was a Limb of that Demeasn which related to the Nunnery, at 
Minster
 in 
Shepey:
 and when the whirlwind of the common Dissolution in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, had shook this into the Revenue of the Crown, that Prince in the thirty eighth year of his Reign, passed it away by Grant, (as appears by the original Patent) to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney;
 whose Son 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney,
 exchanged it with other Lands with Queen 
E∣lizabeth,
 and shee (as is manifest by the Patent now in the Custody of 
Brasen-nose
 Colledge) granted it to Sir 
Edward Hobby;
 who about the latter end of her Reign, conveyed it to the Reverend 
Alexander Nowell,
 Dean of 
Pauls:
 and he dying without Issue, in the year 1601, left it for ever to 
Brasennose
 Colledge in 
Oxford,
 with this Proviso, that one of his Alliance should hold it in Lease from that So∣ciety for ever, paying to the Colledge an 100 Marks 
per Annum,
 according to the Tenure of which Testamentary Restriction, it is now enjoyed by Col. 
Tho. Blount
 of 
Wriklemersh
 Esquire.


Gillingham
 had a Market procured to it, to be held weekly, on the Thursday, and a Fair to be observed yearly at the Feast of St. 
Crosse,
 and seven days after, by 
John
 Lord Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the first, as appears 
Cart. Num.

Lidsing,
 is the last place of Account in this Parish, it was, in Ages of a higher Ascent, the Inheritance of an ancient Family, called 
Sharsted. Simon de Sharsted
 possest it at his Death, which was in the twenty fourth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 42. In Ages of a lower Computation, I find 
Roger de Say,
 to be possest of it; and he about the fiftieth of 
E.
 the 3d. gives it to 
Rob. Belknap
 the Judge, who about the tenth year of 
Richard
 the second, was by Sentence from Parliament, exiled into 
Ireland,
 for too vehemently asserting the Prerogative of the Crown, which in the Estimate of those Times, was thought to have opened those sluces too much, which would have let in the Inundations of an arbitrary Power upon the people's Liberties. But this Mannor was again restored by that Prince who looked upon this person as his Martyr, to him as its ancient Possessor, in the twenty second year of his Reign, and he by his Deed, bearing Date the eighth of 
October,
 in the second year of King 
Henry
 the fourth, gives it to the Priory of St. 
Andrews
 in 
Rochester,
 for one Monk who was a Priest, to celebrate Masse for ever for the Soul of his Father 
John Belknap,
 and for the Soul of his Mother 
Alice,
 Wife of the said 
John,
 and likewise for the Soul of himself, and all his Successors, in the Cathedrall of 
Rochester.
 This, upon the Dissolution of the for∣mer Priory, was by 
Henry
 the eighth, upon his Institution of the Dean and Chapter of 
Rochester,
 granted to them for their support and Alimony, and rested in their Reve∣nue untill these Times.


There was another Chauntry founded at 
Twidall,
 by 
John Beaufits,
 which he makes provision for, by his last Will, the twenty second of 
November,
 in the year of our Lord, 1433, and orders it to be dedicated to 
John
 the Baptist, and likewise that one Priest should there celebrate Masse for the Soul of Himself, his Wife 
A∣lice,
 his Father 
John,
 his Mother 
Isabell,
 and his Uncle 
William Beaufitz:
 the Seats in the Chappel, and other Remains, declare it to have been formerly a neat and elegant Piece of Architecture.


Here was a signall Encounter (as the Annals of St. 
Austins
 testifie) between 
Edmund Ironside,
 and 
Canutus
 the Dane, wherein, after a Sharp Debate, the Dane was broken and discomfited.


At 
Gillingham
 likewise (as 
Thomas Robburn
 a Monk of 
Winchester
 testifies) was acted that bloody Tragedy by Earl 
Godwin,
 who slew all those Normans who ar∣rived

with 
Edward
 unto the tenth man, for which his Name as well as his Con∣science, stands bespatter'd and stain'd with an indelible Character of Ignominy, and Cruelty to all Posterity.


Goodwenston
 in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 was the ancient Seat of 
Chich.
 The first of Eminence, was 
Ernaldus Chich,
 who was a man of principall Account in the Reign of 
Henry
 the second, 
Richard
 the first, and King 
John:
 nor were they more eminent here, then they were at 
Canterbury,
 where they had large Posses∣sions, and unto them did the Aldermanry of 
Burgate
 appertain. 
Thomas Chich
 of 
Goodwenston,
 was a prime Benefactor, to the Church of St. 
Mary Bredmin
 in 
Canterbury,
 where his Name together with his Effigies are in an old Character set up, in the West-window, as his Coat is likewise in the Chancel, insculped in Stone-work. He was Bailiff of 
Canterbury,
 an Office not contemptible in those Times, in the year 1259, and again in the year 1271. 
Thomas Chich,
 this mans Son, was She∣riff of 
Kent
 in the forty fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, and held his Shrievalty at 
Goodwenston. Thomas Chich,
 this Mans Son, was Sheriff of 
Kent
 likewise in the fifteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, and he was Grandfather to 
Valentine Chich,
 who matched with 
Philippa
 Daughter and Heir of Sir 
Robert Chichley,
 Brother to 
Henry Chichley,
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 but dyed without Issue-male: so that his three Sisters and Coheirs wedded to 
Kemp, Judde,
 and 
Martin,
 shared his In∣heritance, and by a joint Consent, about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, passed away their Estate here and at 
Ewell,
 in this parish, to 
Pordage
 of 
Rodmer∣sham:
 and from this Name about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth
 it passed a∣way to 
Fagg
 descended from the 
Faggs
 of 
Willesborough,
 where I find by the Court Rolls of the Mannor of 
Brabourne,
 that one 
Andrew Fagge
 held Lands there of that Mannor, in the Reign of 
Edward
 the third. But to go on, the 
Faggs
 had not long been planted in their new atchieved Purchase at this place, when 
Robert Fagge
 concluded in two Daughters and Coheirs, 
Ann
 who was mat∣ched to Sir 
John Proude,
 who was unhappily slain at the 
Groll,
 in the year 1628, whilst he did vigorously pursue the Quarrel of the States General, at that Siege against the Capital Enemy of their Religion, and Liberty, the Spaniard: and 
Mary
 espoused to Sir 
Edward Partrich,
 for his first Wife, but dyed without any Issue surviving by him. Sir 
John Proud
 left only one Daughter called 
Ann,
 who was first wedded to Sir 
William Springate,
 and secondly to Mr. 
Isaac Pennington,
 eldest Son to 
Isaac Pennington,
 Lord Maior of 
London
 in the year 1643, in Right of which Alliance, he at present holds this Mannor of 
Goodwenston.


Goodneston
 by 
Wingham
 vulgarly called 
Gonston,
 lies in the Hundred of 
Wingham
 and was formerly parcell of the Patrimony of 
Hastings
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 bequea∣thed to him by his Kinsman 
John de Hastings;
 who was first Husband to 
Juliana,
 the Heir generall of 
Roger de Leybourn. John de Hostings
 held it at his Death, which was in the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, and so did his Son 
John de Hastings
 after him, and brings a pleading for it in the fourteenth year of 
R.
 the second. After them the 
Malmains
 were possest of it, who had some Estate here before, which they had by Purchase from 
Pine
 and 
Beauchamp,
 about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the third, and in this Family did it remain, untill 
Henry Malmains,
 about the year ........ deceased without Issue-male, and then by 
Agnes
 his Daughter and Heir marryed to 
Thomas Goldwell,
 it came to own the Jurisdiction of that Name and Family, but was not long fastned to it: for he en∣ded likewise in a Female Heir called 
Joan,
 who was wedded to 
Thomas Took
 of 
Bere
 Esquire, and so by her it was united to the Revenue of this Family, and here rested; untill that Age which came within the Circle of our Grandsathers Knowledge, and then it was passed away to 
Henekar,
 from which Name in Times almost of our Cognisance, it went away by a Revolution like the former to 
Kelley,
 who conveyed it to 
Engham,
 descended from the noble Family of the 
Enghams,
 of 
Wood∣church,
 who flourished so many Ages at 
Edingam,
 and 
Pleurinden
 in that Parish.


Bonnington
 in this Parish, is the ancient Seat, from whence the numerous and Knightly Family of 
Bois,
 did as from their originall Fountain issue out,

into 
Fredville, Betteshhanger, Haukherst,
 and other parts of this Countie; and do derive themselves from 
John de Bosco,
 who is mentioned in the Battle-Abby Roll, of those who entered this Nation with 
Will.
 the Conquerour: and certainly they have not been much lesse at this place then 17 Descents, as the datelesse Deeds of se∣veral of this Family who writ themselves of 
Bonnington,
 do easily manifest. Nor hath it yet deserted the Name, or departed from the Possession of 
Bois,
 being at this present, part of the patrimony of Sir 
John Bois,
 to whose paternal Arms, the late King for his eminent and loyall Service perform'd by him at 
Donnington
 Castle, added as an Augmentation, upon a 
Canton, Azure,
 a Crown imperial, 
Or.


Rolling,
 is a third place in this Parish to be taken notice of: It contributed a Seat as well as a Sirname, formerly, to a Family called 
Rolling. Thomas Rolling
 held some Lands in Lease at his Death, which was in the fisteenth year of 
Ric.
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 143. which Lands belonged to a Chauntry in St. 
Peters Church
 in 
Sandwich,
 and lay in 
Eastry,
 near his Mannor of 
Rolling.
 After this Family was worn out, the 
Idley's
 who had large Possessions about 
Mepham, Cobham,
 and 
Higham,
 as appears by the Inquisition taken after the Death of 
John Idelegh,
 in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 58. 
Parte secunda,
 were by Purchase seated in the Possession, and preserved it untill the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth; and then it was alienated to 
Butler
 of 
Heronden
 in 
Eastry;
 from whom in the Beginning of the raign of Q. 
Eliz.
 it went away to 
Roger Manwood,
 Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer: whose Son Sir 
Peter Man∣wood,
 in our Fathers Remembrance, alienated it to 
Dickenson,
 from whom not many years since it was brought over to be the Possession of Master .......... 
Richards.


Godmersham
 in the Hundred of 
Felborough,
 was given to the Monks of 
Christ-Church
 in 
Canterbury,
 by 
Beornulfus
 King of the 
Mercians,
 in the year of 
Grace
 eight hundred twenty and one, free as 
Adisham;
 and it was, at the Request of Arch-bishop 
Ʋlfred,
 to supply the Covent both with Food and Raiment, which Grant Arch-bishop 
Egelnoth,
 who it seems had some Interest in the Place, in the year one Thousand thirty and six, did fully confirm. And in the year one thou∣sand three hundred fourscore and seven, 
Thomas Arundell
 Arch-bishop of 
Canter∣bury,
 with the especiall Licence of 
Richard
 the second, appropriated the Tiths of the Rectory of 
Godmersham,
 to the Church of 
Christ-church,
 to the Support and Maintenance of the Fabrick of the Church abovesaid.


If you will see what Value was set upon this Mannor in the Time of the Conquerour, I shall afford you a Sight of it, out of 
Dooms-day
 Book. 
Godmersham
 (says that Register) 
est Manerium Monachorum, & de Vestitu eorum, & in Tempore Edwardi Regis, se defendebat pro

sed tamen reddit
 XXX. That is, it paid a Rent of thirty pound to the Church.


Yolands
 and 
Ford,
 are two other little Mannors in this Parish, which acknow∣ledged themselves anciently to be parcell of the Inheritance of 
Valoigns.
 And 
Robert de Valoigns,
 dyed possest of these and much other Land in this Track, in the nineteenth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 41. 
Henry de Va∣loigns,
 this mans Son, was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the fourteenth of King 
Edward
 the third, and he had Issue 
Waretius de Valoigns,
 and 
Stephen de Valoigns
 who planted himself at 
Gore-Court
 in 
Otham,
 and is represented in Record, to be one of the Conservators of the Peace for this County, in the twenty ninth, and thirty first years of 
Edward
 the third: but 
Waretius de Valoigns
 determined in two Daughters and Coheirs, one was matched to 
Fogge,
 and the other to 
Thomas Aldon,
 Son of 
Thomas de Aldon,
 who was one of the Conservators of the Peace in 
Kent
 in the tenth and twelfth years of 
Edward
 the third, and he in her Right was entituled to the Possession of these places. And in this Family did it for diverse years continue, untill the ordinary Mutation of Purchase rowled them into the In∣heritance of 
Austin;
 to which Name, the Title remained constantly linked, un∣till that Age we style our Grand-fathers, and then they were by 
Richard Austin,
 passed away by Sale to 
Broadnix,
 so that they are now by paternal Right, devol∣ved to 
Thomas Broadnix
 Esquire, in whose Estate the instant Propriety of them does lye involved.




Egerton
 in 
Godmersham
 was a Mannor which formerly swelled the demeasn of the no∣ble Family of 
Valence,
 who were Earls of 
Pembroke. Aymer de Valence
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 held it at his Death, which was in the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the second, as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 75. And leaving no lawfull Issue, this, upon the par∣tition of his Estate, increased the Revenue of 
John Comin
 Earl of 
Badzenoth
 in 
Scotland,
 who had married 
Joan
 one of his two Sisters and Coheirs: But long it remained not here, for he deceased without any Issue-male, so that 
Joan
 his sole Daughter, matched to 
David de Strabolgie
 Earl of 
Atholl,
 became his Heir, and he in her Right, was found to be invested in the Possession, in the first year of 
Edw.
 the third, as is manifest 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 85. And from him did it devolve by Descent, to his Son and Heir, 
David de Strabolgie,
 who in the seventh year of 
Edward
 the third, by Deed, setled it on his Kinsman Sir 
Henry de Hills,
 which, 
Katharine
 his Widow and Countesse confirms, the twentieth year of that Prince: 
Gilbert de Hills,
 lieth buryed in 
Godmersham Church,
 and as appears by his Pourtraict∣ure in his Armour, was a person of Eminence in that Age, wherein he flou∣rished, and from him, and Sir 
Henry de Hills,
 did issue forth many eminent and worthy Successors, who were Proprietaries of this Mannor, untill that Age which fell within the Precincts of our Crandfathers Memory, and then it went away by Sale to 
Scot,
 a Cadet or younger Sprig of the 
Scotts
 of 
Scotts-Hall:
 the Heir Ge∣neral of which Family, was Mrs. 
Dorothy Scott,
 who being lately matched to Mr. 
Daniell Gotherson,
 he in her Right is now (though not without a signal Conten∣tion at Law, with some collateral Pretenders to the Title) peaceably planted in the Possession of it.


Godmersham
 as the Records of 
Christ-church
 inform mee, had the Grant of a Market, to be observed weekly on the Tuesday, and a Fair yearly upon the Thurs∣day and Friday, in 
Whitson
 Week by the Prior of 
Christ-church,
 in the Reign of 
Edward
 the third.


Goudherst
 in the Hundred of 
Marden,
 with the inherent Mannor of 
Bedgebury,
 were the ancient Patrimony of a Family of no cheap Account in this Track, which, as it chose one of these Mannors for its Seat, so did it derive its Sirname from thence likewise, and was called 
Bedgbury,
 and certainly were of a very high Ascent in their Extraction. For in a Deed without Date, one 
John de Bedge∣bury
 demises some parcels of Land to 
William de Comden
 of 
Comden House
 in this Parish, and the Seal affixed to this Deed is a Cavalier on Horseback, armed, like one of the Knights Templers, which argues that he lived before the Suppression of that Order, and assumed that Impresse out of his particular Affection to them; or else, which was customary in those Times, out of some signall and solemn vow, to maintain the Temple of our Saviour, from the Assaults and barbarous Impressions of Infidels, which these persons were by their Oath, and first Insti∣tution, oblieged vigorously to defend also. 
John de Bedgebury,
 this man's Suc∣cessor, paid respective Aid for his Lands at 
Goudherst,
 and likewise for his Man∣nor of 
Bedgebury,
 at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and left these above recited Mannors to his Son 
John de Bedge∣bury
 who dying without Issue, his Sister became his Sole Inheritrix, who by matching with 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bayhall
 in 
Pepenbury,
 Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the eighteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, fastned the Propriety of these places, to the Interest of this Family, where they continued undivided, but in the thirty eighth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, Court 
Shingley
 was by 
Thomas Colepeper
 a∣lienated to 
Stephen Darell:
 but 
Goudherst
 and 
Bedgebury,
 were not plucked away from this Family, by this Alienation, but continued united to their Estate, so that at this Day they own 
Thomas Colepeper
 Esquire, for their Proprietary.


Combwell
 was a Priory of Black Canons, under the Rule of St. 
Augustin,
 and was founded by Sir 
Robert de Thurnham,
 and dedicated to the Honor of St. 
Mary Magdalen.
 Their Revenue lay scattered in 
Marden, Stapleherst,
 and 
Goudherst;
 in which last, there was an obscure Cell, or Convent of Nuns, which had their prin∣cipal Subsistence by their Charity, whose Ruines are yet visible, though their Re∣venue, was so narrow, that no Record informs us where it was situated. Upon

the Dissolution in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, this devolving to the Crown, that Prince in the thirty fourth year of his Government, granted it to Sir 
John Gage,
 one of the Justices of the Peace, both for 
Sussex
 and 
Kent;
 and his Suc∣cessor conveyed it to 
Colepeper,
 who immediately after, passed it away to 
William Campion
 Esquire, Ancestor to Sir 
William Campion,
 who was offe∣red up a Sacrifice, to the Cause and Quarrel of the last King at 
Colchester,
 in the year one thousand fix hundred forty eight, and in his Heirs is the Interest of this Mannor at this instant resident.


Finchcocks
 is a third place of note in this Parish, made more eminent in that it was the Mansion of a Family of that Sirname, whom, although I find invested in the Possession of this place, ever since the fortieth year of 
Henry
 the third, yet do I not discover that any of the Family was illustrious by any important under∣taking, or famous by any eminent Office. The next Family which stept into the Possession was 
Horden
 of 
Horden;
 and he became Proprietary of it by Purchase about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, one of which Family was 
Edward Hor∣den
 Esquire, who was Knight of the Greencloth to 
Edward
 the sixth, Queen 
Mary
 and Queen 
Elizabeth:
 who dyed without Issue-male, and left his Estate to be shared between two Daughters and Coheirs, 
Elizabeth
 matched to Mr. 
Paul Bat∣hurst,
 descended from 
Bathurst
 Street in 
Nordiam,
 and 
Mary
 espoused to Mr. 
Delves
 of 
Fletchings,
 who in her Right carried away 
Horden,
 where certainly, the above-recited Family had flourished under a noble Estimate; for 
Edward Horden
 the last of this Name was issued out from 
William Chichley,
 second Brother to 
Henry Chichley
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury;
 and for some considerable Service performed to the Crown, had the Augmentation of a Regal 
Diadem,
 upon a 
Canton
 added to his paternal Coat, by Queen 
Elizabeth.
 But to proceed, 
Finchcocks
 by the above-mentioned match, devolved to be the Possession of 
Bathurst,
 and so owns it self at this Day, to be the Estate of this Name and Family.


Patenden
 is another place which gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of no vul∣gar Repute in this County, and was seated in its Possession, as appears by ori∣ginal Deeds and other old Records, as high as the Reign of 
Edward
 the first, and where, in the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, there was issued out a Commission to 
Gervas Clifton
 Esquire, then Sheriff of the County, to return all those, who did 
portare Arma antiqua.
 Amongst the Register and Catalogue of those who were then returned, 
Patenden
 is recorded, who was Lord of this place, and from him did the Propriety of this place by Descent glide down to his Suc∣cessor, who, in those Times we style our Fathers, passed it away by Sale to Mr. 
Bathurst.


The 
Borough
 of 
Twisden,
 is a fifth place, which invites us to a Survey. It was in elder Generations the Inheritance of 
Twisdens,
 upon whom, I may without any Supply of Flattery, strew those just Attributes of Ancient and Noble. The first, that I find by Deed to be of this Family, Possessor of it, was 
Adam de Twisden,
 and he was seised of it,

 in the one and twentieth of 
Edward
 the first. In times of a lower Descent, 
Roger Twisden
 was possest of it, and in the fifth year of 
H.
 the fourth, affixes to a Deed now in the Hands of Sir 
Roger Twisden,
 of 
Roydon
 Hall, Baronet, the Signature or Impression of a Cockatrice on Wax. The Crest, which, at this Day, is annexed to the paternal Coat of this Family, a rare thing in those Times when Crests were infrequent and unusuall, and began to be customary, when those eminent Familyes who were embarked in the two Factions, of 
York
 and 
Lancaster,
 assumed them to serve as Evidences or Symbols of Distin∣ction, whereby the Son might avoid the plunging his Sword in the Bowells of his Father, or a Brother the Sheathing his in the Entrails of his Brother. But to proceed, the last of this Name, who possest this place, was 
Roger Twisden,
 who about the Beginning of 
H.
 the sixth, passed it away to 
Roger Twisden,
 and he imme∣diately after conveyed it by Sale to 
Geffrey Allen,
 who about the latter end of 
H.
 the sixth, setled the Right of it by Deed in 
Thomas Windhill.
 And thus far do the Copies of diverse original Evidences, which relate to this Place, extend and no farther. After this, it was for diverse Descents wrapt up in the Propriety of 
Austin,
 who not many years since expiring in a Female Inheritrix, she, by mat∣ching

with Mr. 
Fowle
 a Cadet of the 
Fowles
 of 
River-Hall
 in 
Sussen,
 hath made it the present Possession of that Name and Family.


Shingley
 is another Mannor in 
Goudherst,
 which belonged to that Revenue which did own the Signory of the Priory of 
Leeds,
 and upon the suppression, when the Pa∣trimony of this Cloister was broken to peeces by the Scepter of 
Henry
 the Eighth, this was in the thirty sixth year of that Prince granted to 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bedgebury
 Esquire, with all the Priviledges which it was fortified with, when it related to the abovementioned Cloister, as namely to be Tith-free, 
&c.
 But the Title (such a Moath and Canker cleaves to the Patrimony of the Church when it is transplanted) made no long stay in 
Colepeper,
 for in the thirty eighth year of 
Henry
 the Eighth, this 
Thomas Colepeper
 alienated it to 
Stephen
 and 
Thomas Darrell;
 but in this Family like∣wise was the Possession of as frail a permanence: for they nor long after conveyed it to 
William Campion
 Esquire, Counsellor at Law, from whom it descended to Sir 
William Campion
 Governor of 
Borestall
 House near 
Oxford,
 for His Late Majesty, and who was after slain at 
Colchester,
 asserting the Royal Interest, and in his Descendants is the Propriety of it still wrapped up.


Bokinfold
 is the last place of Consideration in 
Goudherst;
 it was a Mannor which related to that Chauntry, which was founded here by 
Hamon de Crevequer,
 and con∣firmed with all the Franchises annexed to it by 
Edward
 the Third, in the one and for∣tieth year of his Raign, and in this Patent of Inspection and Ratification, it is men∣tioned that 
Hamon de Crevequer,
 was its Founder: But the common Dissolution in the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, renting away (like some suddain and impetuous Tor∣rent) this Mannor from those Ends and Uses it was first designed to, lodged it in the Crown, and then the abovesaid Prince in the one and thirtieth year of his Raign, granted it to 
Paul Sidnore
 Gentleman, and he not long after conveyed it to Sir 
John Gates;
 but he being one of the principal Emissaries or Complices of 
John Seymour
 Duke of 
Somerset,
 being inwrapped and ingaged past Recovery in the Design of the above said Duke, sunk in the Ruines of that unfortunate Peere, and was convicted of High Treason, and beheaded on Tower-Hill, in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the sixth. Upon his Tragedy, this Mannor returned to the Crown, and stayed there, until the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was granted to 
Katherine Tong,
 who not long after passed it away to 
Colepeper
 of 
Bedgebury,
 who, almost in our remembrance, passed away that part of this Great Mannor, which is circumscribed within the Verge of 
Goudherst
 to the instant Proprietary 
Brewer.


Joan
 Widow of 
Roger de Bedgebury,
 in the third year of 
Richard
 the second, obtain∣ed a weekly Market to 
Goudhurst
 on the Wednesday, and a Fair yearly on the Day of our Ladies Assumption, 
Cart. de Anno tertio Richardi secundi, Numb.
 13.






H. H. H. H.


HAckington,
 otherwise called St. 
Stephens,
 lies partly in the Hundred of 
Bredge
 and 
Petham,
 and partly in that of 
Westgate,
 and did in elder Times appertain to the Monks of Christ-Church in 
Canterbury,
 until it was exchanged by the Prior, and that Covent and the Monks of it, with 
Stephen Langton,
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 for other Houses situated near the Priory of St. 
Gregories
 in 
Canterbury,
 and he having here at 
Hackington
 erected a new Fabrick, bestowed and setled it on his Brother 
Simon de Lang∣ton,
 Arch-deacon of 
Canterbury,
 from whom it successively came down to the following Arch-deacons, and became their fixed Mansion until the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, of those who were invested with that Office: But in the general suppression, the im∣pious hand of sacriledge having plucked it off from the Church; it was annexed to the Crown, and continued there until Queen 
Elizabeth
 granted it to Sir 
Roger Man∣wood,
 chief Baron of the Exchequer, and from him did it devolve to his Grand-child, Sir 
John Manwood,
 who passed it away in our Memory to Colonel Sir 
Thomas Colepeper,
 Colonel of a Regiment of Foot in the Low Countries, in whose Descendants the Pos∣session is now resident.




In Times of a very high Ascent, Arch-bishop 
Hubert,
 and after him Arch-bishop 
Baldwin
 had a Design to have erected a Colledge first here at 
Hackington,
 and then up∣on second Thoughts at 
Lambeth;
 but the Monks of Christ-church, believing that this intended new Seminary of Religion, might something by its Interposition darken the Glory and Grandeur of their Covent, first by 
Alanus
 their then Prior, and afterwards by Proxie, so vigorously opposed this Project at 
Rome,
 that by the Favor and Indulgence of the then Popes, it was vacated and extinguished: But in times subsequent to these, these Monks having much endeared 
Stephen Langton,
 the then Arch-bishop, by bestowing some Signal Favors on 
Simon de Langton
 his Brother, the Controversie, which was fomented by the above mentioned Design, by his compliance with the Monks was appeased, and entombed in an amicable Pacification.


Broad-oake
 is another little Mannor in 
Hackington,
 which anciently made up the Demeasne of the Noble Family of 
Hadlow:
 for 
Nicholas de Hadlow,
 I find had a Char∣ter of Free-warren to his Lands at 
Medgrove
 and 
Broadoake,
 in the one and twentieth year of 
Edward
 the first: After 
Hadlow
 was extinguished, the ancient Family of 
Har∣dres
 of upper 
Hardres
 were ingrafted in the Inheritance, and one 
Edmund Hardres,
 as I discover by an old Court-roll, held it in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the 4
th.
 and after him his Grand-child 
George Hardres
 died possest both of the Lands at 
Medgrove
 and 
Broad∣oake,
 in the one and twentieth of 
Edward
 the fourth, and in this Name was the Pos∣session constant until the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then they were passed away by Sale to Sir 
Edward Boughton
 of 
Burwash
 in 
Plumsted,
 and his Son 
Thomas Boughton
 Esquire, in the seventh year of 
Edward
 the sixth, alienated them to 
Regi∣nald Highgate
 and 
William Hanwick,
 and they not long after conveyed them to ...... 
Roper
 Esquire, from whom they are now by Descent transmitted to his Successor, Mr. 
Edward Roper
 of 
Well Hall
 in 
Eltham.


Shalford
 and 
Medgrove
 were alwaies annexed to 
Hackington
 above mentioned, of which they were accounted, but as Limbs or Ingredients, and in the fourteenth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 were granted in Lease for Life to Sir 
Roger Manwood
 for Life, but the Fee-simple remained in the Crown, until about the Beginning of King 
Charles,
 and then they were granted to Sir 
Edward Sidhenham,
 and Mr. 
Smith,
 and they not long after passed them away to Mr. 
Robert Austin,
 then of 
London,
 but now of 
Bexley
 in this County.


Hadlow
 in the Hundred of 
Hadlow Borough
 & 
Littlefeild,
 gave both Seat & Sirname to a Family ancient and conspicuous enough in this Track: but whether the same with that Family which was seated at 
Hadlow-place
 in 
Crundall,
 is altogether ambiguous; certain I am that 
Edmund de Hadlow
 died seised of it in the thirty second of 
Edward
 the third, and from this Name in the subsequent Age it came to the Crown, but whether by Escheat, Exchange, or Purchase; no Beam, scattered from any private or publique Record, can so far enlighten my Knowledge as to discover. 
Henry
 the sixth, in the twenty fifth of his Raign, granted this and many other Possessions, lying about the Skirts of the 
Lowey
 of 
Tunbridge
 to 
Humphrey Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 and with this Name it went along till 
Edward Stafford
 being infortunately offered up a Sacrifice to the Malice and Ambition of Cardinal 
Wolsey,
 in the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and the Losse of his Head having been the expiation of some Vanities, which he had been too much Guilty of, the Right by his Attaint flowing back into the Crown, it was invested in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the eighth by Royal Concession in 
John Vane
 Esquire, whose Successor Sir 
Henry Vane,
 not many years since sold it to 
Thomas Petley,
 whose descendant now enjoyes it.


Peckham
 in this Parish was part of the Patrimony of the Noble Family of 
Peckham,
 and one 
John Peckham
 (as the Book called the Survey of the Mannors of 
Hadlow,
 taken in the fourteenth year of 
Edward
 the fourth informs me) anciently possest it, from which Name it was by Sale rent away, and incorporated into the Interest of 
Colepeper;
 for 
John Colepeper
 (as the above mentioned Survey instructs me) sold it to 
Leigh,
 and after the Possession had been for some intermission of Time riveted into this Family, it was by the same Alienation taken away, and by 
John Leigh
 trans∣mittted to Sir 
George Rivers,
 whose Son Sir 
John Rivers,
 did lately upon his De∣cease as his Heir successively claim it.




The Mannor of 
Fromonds
 is mentioned likewise in the abovesaid Survey: It gave Sirname to 
Fromonds,
 Ancestor to 
Fromond
 of 
Cheame
 in 
Surrey;
 but whether it yeelded Seat likewise, is the Question. Certain it is, it staid not long in this Name: for 
Richard Fromond
 sold it to 
Colepeper:
 nor was it long fixed or constant in this Family neither; for 
Richard Colepeper
 after the ebbing away of some successive Generations cast the Possession by sale into 
John Fromond
 again, originally extracted from the above men∣tioned 
Richard Fromond:
 and to this Name this Seat and its Interest continues (for ought I can yet discover) at this instant fastned and united.


Causton
 is the next (because it owned a Family of that Sirname) that claims our Consideration. It was in Ages of higher Ascent, the Demesne and Interest of some of this Name; but whether the 
Caustons
 of the County of 
Salop
 were issued from hence, or these of this Seat extracted originally from thence, is yet under dispute; and the more, because Eviderce of Deeds, which is the Lant horn, not only of An∣tiquity, but sometimes of Reason likewise, is wholly wanting. It is without Con∣troversie, this Mansion was not long in the 
Caustons,
 for the thread of Succession was interrupted and broken, and 
Hugh Causton
 by Sale conveyed it over to the 
Wattons
 of 
Addington:
 nor was it long resident here, for 
William Watton
 sold it to 
Thomas Peckham
 branched out from the 
Peckham,
 of 
Yaldham
 in 
Wrotham,
 from whom by a like Muta∣tion that changed the Scene and Face of the Title; it was alienated to 
Vane,
 and after some stay in that Name, lately by Purchase made the Propriety of 
Maynard
 of 
May∣feild
 in the County of 
Sussex.


Totlingbery
 had the Repute of a Mannor also, and was the Mansion sometime of that Name, till Time the great Channel of all Things, that either sinks or preserves them, carried it down from 
John Totlingbery,
 to the Family of 
Roberts
 of 
Glastenbury
 in 
Cranbrook,
 and the same stream of vicissitude wafted it not long after from 
Walter Roberts
 the Last of that Name, which enjoyed it, to 
John Vane
 Esquire; where (no Record or Evidence suggesting yet any thing to the contrary) I think it yet con∣tinues.


Goldhell
 may be looked upon as a place of some importance, since some Families of Estimate have been Possessors of it, for first it was the Possession of the 
Bealds;
 so they are styled in the Survey. And when this Family began to moulder away, the Title by Sale shifted it self to the 
Fromonds,
 a Name eminent enough in this Track: and when they began to languish away into the common Familty of Families: 
John Fromond
 sold it to the 
Colepepers
 of 
Oxenhoath.
 And this Branch of the 
Colepepers
 con∣cluding at last in three Daughters and Coheirs; one of them being wedded to 
Cotton
 of 
Lanwade
 in the County of 
Cambridge,
 made this Part of the Revenue of that Fa∣mily; but they desiring to contract their Interest into a nearer Circumference, cast this by sale into the Possession of Sir 
George Chowne,
 to whose Successor it very lately entitled it self.


Goding
 and 
Crombery
 are Mannors of some Signal Respect, since they acknow∣ledged themselves to be part of the Patrimony of 
Fromond,
 a Family by an eminent Succession of Gentry noble and conspicuous, which being by Time broken and dis∣ordered; it not long after was by 
Thoma Fromond
 sold to 
John Goding.
 From whom after the series of that Name was by the same alteration interrupted; it was con∣veyed to the 
Peckhams,
 where it hao not long made its Residence, but the Title by purchase (like an Orbe never much in repose) rowled it self from 
Thomas Peckham
 into 
Vane,
 where for some years it has rested.


The Mannor of 
Moateland
 shall be the last mentioned, (though not in the above specified Survey, yet) in mine, in Relation to this Parish. The first Family that I track in the Record to be Possessors of it, were the 
Bakers
 of 
East-Peckham,
 in which Name the Propriety of it lay wrapt up, till 
Richard Baker
 did devest himself of his Right, and passed it over by Sale to 
Burgesse:
 where it had not long dwelt, but the same Change untwined it. For 
Thomas Burgesse
 alienated it to 
Henry Leigh,
 and in his Successor (till a clearer Ray of more Modern Intelligence, directs me to believe the Contrary) I think the Possession is resident.


There are two other Seats of Venerable Account in this Parish. The Mannor of the Rectory is the first, which in the year 1287. was by 
Thomas de Inglethorp
 Bishop of 
Rochester
 (as the Records of that Church signifie) appropriated to the Knights of

St. 
John,
 otherwise called the Knights Hospitalers, and remained locked up in their Demeasne, until the publique Suppression snatched it away, and united it to the Crown, where it lodged until the second year of 
Edward
 the sixth, and then it was granted to Sir 
Ralph Vane,
 whose Descendant about the middle of Queen 
Elizabeth
 passed it away to 
Roger Twisden
 Esquire, Captain of a Troop of 
Kentish
 Gentlemen at the Camp formed at 
Tilbury,
 to oppose the Hostile Eruptions of the 
Spanish
 in the year 1588. And from him it is now come by Descent to be possest by his Grand∣child, that learned and accomplished Gentleman Sir 
Roger Twisden
 of 
Roydon Hall,
 Knight and Baroner.


The second is 
Fish-Hall,
 the Mansion formerly of 
John de Fisher,
 so called, be∣cause he was invested with a Priviledge by 
Gilbert de Clare,
 Earl of 
Glocester,
 and Lord of the 
Lowey
 of 
Tunbridge,
 to have the Fishing freely and uncontrouledly within his Jurisdiction, or as far as it did extend, so that from this Immunity or Franchise, his Posterity contracted the Sirname of 
Fisher,
 and for some Ages, did the Right of it remain interwoven with the Demeasne of this Family, till 
Richard Fisher
 sold it to 
John Vane
 Esquire, from whom the same Revolution not long after transported it to 
Rivers
 of 
Chafford,
 and now the Title is ingrafted into a yonger Branch of that Family.


Halling
 in the Hundred of 
Shamell,
 has nothing remarkable in it but the Man∣nor of 
Langridge, aliâs Bavent;
 for so it is written frequently in Records, and indeed not without some Reason to support the Orthography; for in Times of elder Prescription, it gave both Seat and Sirname to a Family that had that Ap∣pellation, and there is some Track or Print yet of the Ruines of a Mansion∣house in that Feild, which is at this Day called 
Bavents;
 and 
Roger de Bavent
 died in possession of it in the thirty first year of 
Edward
 the third: and when this Name was worn out, the next which we find in Succession to be Proprietary of it, was 
Langridge,
 a Branch spouted out from that Stem of 
Langridge,
 which was anciently planted in the County of 
South-hampton.
 And when this Family was decayed and vanished, and had left nothing to evidence to us that it had once a Be∣ing here: but the adopting this Mannor into its Name, the Possession went into 
Melford,
 and here, after it had had some short abode, it abandoned this Family, and cast the Interest of it into the Patrimony of 
Raynwell,
 whose Successor after some short Flux of Time (as appears by the Book of Aid kept in the Exchequer) sold it to 
Robert Wotton,
 in the seventeenth year of 
Henry
 the seventh, and he suddainly after alienated this and other Lands to 
Whorne
 of 
Cuckston;
 nor was the Title any length of Time lodged in this Name; for a Fate of the same condition with the former carried it over to 
Vane,
 from whom it flowed away in the same Current, and by Sale emptied it self into 
Barnewell,
 nor was it lesse permanent there, for the same inconstant Tide wafted it down to 
Nicholas Lewson,
 and Sir 
Richard Lewson
 his Grand-child, desirous to wrap up all his Interest within the County of 
Stafford,
 alie∣nated his 
Kentish
 Lands to several persons, and sold those which were part of his Demesne here to 
Barber.


The Mannor of 
Halling
 it self was given to the Church of 
Rochester,
 by 
Egbert
 King of the West 
Saxons,
 in the year of our Lord 838. and has continued parcel of the Churches Patrimony in an uninterrupted Succession of Time, till the year 1643. and then the Title was raveled and discomposed.


Halden
 in the Hundred of 
Blackborne
 and 
Barekley
 has nothing worthy in it that may oblige a Remembrance, but only 
Hales-place,
 from whence, as from their Fountain, the several Streams of the 
Hales,
 that in divided Rivulets have spread themselves over the whole County, did originally break forth. But where this 
Hales-place
 is now placed, or in what Angle of the Parish it is situated: I confesse I cannot instruct my self, unlesse it be that Great House which was the Original Seat of the 
Scots,
 before they planted at 
Congerherst
 in 
Haukherst,
 and which 
Reginald Scot
 sold to Sir 
Edward Hales.
 Indeed it is often mentioned in the Pedigree of 
Hales,
 and likewise in the Deeds of that Family, as lying in 
Halden,
 which is evidence enough that there was such a Mansion in this Parish; though peradventure through

Neglect and Disuse, and by altering its Possessor, it have at present lost its Name.


Halstow
 in the Hundred of 
Hoo,
 was anciently part of the Barony of 
Bardolph,
 but did not long rest here, for 
Isolda
 the Daughter and Co-heir of 
Hugh de Bardolph,
 being married to 
Henry
 Lord 
Grey,
 this was thrown into that Scale (with other De∣mesnes of vast Estimate) which did after swell the Revenue of this Baron into a huge Dimension. But, as all sublunary matters have the Fate of an uncertain incon∣stancy written in indelible Characters upon them, so had this; for 
Richard
 Lord 
Grey,
 this mans Successor, sold it to 
John
 Lord 
Cobham,
 and he died possest of it in the thirty sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, from whose Heir an equivalent Vicissitude resigned it up to the illustrious Family of 
Zouch;
 and 
William La Zouch,
 extracted from the 
Zouches
 of 
Haringworth
 in the County of 
North-hampton,
 died actually possest of it in the fifth year of 
Richard
 the second; and after the Title had been some years knit to the Relation and Interest of this Family, it was at length torn off by the rough Hand of Time, and by Sale surrendered up to 
Norris,
 from whose Heir by as quick a Transition it conveyed it self over to Sir 
Edward Hales
 Grand-father to Sir 
Edward Hales
 Baronet, now surviving.


Halsted
 in the Hundred of 
Codsheath
 was the Inheritance of a good old Family called 
Malavill,
 who were of no contemptible Account in this part of the County; for in the Pipe-Rols, relating to the Raign of King 
John,
 I discover, that 
Robert de Malavill
 was one of the 
Recognitores magnae Assisae,
 in the fourth year of that Prince, and then again in the seventh year of his Rule, he was dignified with that eminent Place of Trust, and he had Issue 
William de Malavil,
 who was in the enjoyment of this Mannor at his Death, which was in the Raign of 
Henry
 the third, as appears by an escheat Roll, marked with the number 56. And in this Family did the Right and Title of it lie involved, untill the latter End of 
Edward
 the third; and then the noted Family of 
Bures
 stept by Purchase into the Possession, and 
John Bures,
 (as appears to me by an old Deed) held it in the fourth year of 
Richard
 the second; he was Son of 
William Bures,
 who paid respective Aid for part of a Knights-fee, which lay in 
Bromley,
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at making the Black Prince Knight; and 
William Bures
 Son of 
John
 lies entombed in 
Halsted
 Church, pourtraied at length in Brass, and mail'd in Armor upon a fair Grave-stone, being Marble, with this Inscription: 
Hic jacet Willielmus Bures Armigeri Dominus Manerii de Hal∣sted, qui obiit
 1454. And this was he who was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the sixth: But after his Death it was not long in the Fruition of this Name; for about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the fourth, I find it in the Hands of 
Thomas Bourchier,
 descended from the 
Bourchiers
 of 
Essex;
 and he about the Latter End of that Prince, passed it away to 
Stephen Petley
 Esquire, who lies buried in 
Hal∣sted
 Church. And in this Family was the Title fixed, untill the Beginning of King 
James,
 and then the Fatality of Sale did alternate the Possession, and annexed it to the Inheritance of Sir 
Thomas Watson,
 who dying without Issue-male; his only Daughter and Heir was espoused to Sir 
William Pope,
 afterwards created Earl of 
Downe
 in 
Ireland
 by King 
James,
 and so in her Right this Mannor became the Inheritance of his Son, the Right Honourable 
William
 Earl of 
Downe,
 who not many years since passed it away to Mr. 
Edward Ash,
 whose Widow Mrs. ........ 
Ash,
 holds it at this instant in Right of Dower.


Halstow
 in the Hundred of 
Milton,
 hath nothing memorable in it, but 
Berkesore alias Basser-court,
 which was, as high as any print of Antiquity can direct me to dis∣cover, the Patrimony of the Church; for King 
Stephen
 devoted it to find a supply of perpetual Lights before the Chest or Shrine (
ante Capsam,
 those are the words of the Record) of 
Anselme
 the eminent Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury;
 and it hath been many years past held by the 
Darrels
 of 
Cale-hill
 as Lessees, and is still by that Right enjoyed by Sir 
John Darrell
 of the same place.


The Church of 
Halstow,
 (as the Records of Christ-church instruct us) was given by 
Boniface
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 to buy Books, for the Chaunter of that Covent.




Hamme
 in the Hundred of 
Eastry,
 was, as the Records of Christ-church in 
Can∣terbury
 inform me, given to the Prior and Monks of that Covent in the year 934. by one 
Eylfleda;
 but how it was rated in the Conqueror's Time, when, if not all, yet at least the principal part of this County was surveyed, the 
Pages
 of Doomes∣day Book are silent: In brief, the Moity of this Mannor, (for one Half of it was alwaies under the Jurisdiction of Lay-proprietaries) being by the Donation above∣said, made parcel of the Spiritual Patrimony, remained treasured up in the Re∣venue of the Church, as in an unviolable Exchequer, until both the Covent of Christ-church, and all its Demeasne, was surrendered into the Hands of 
Henry
 the eighth, and that Prince in the thirty fifth year of his Raign, granted that part of it which belonged to the Priory of Christ-church to Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 who not long after passed it away to Sir 
Robert Oxenbridge
 Knight, from which Family in our Grand-fathers memory it went away by Sale to 
Bois
 of 
Betshanger.


The other Moity of 
Hamme,
 belonged to the 
Criolls
 of 
Walmer,
 of which Family I shall speak more at that Place: 
Simon de Crioll,
 as I discover by old Deeds, held it in the Raign of King 
John
 and 
Henry
 the third, and transmitted it to his Son 
Nicolas de Crioll,
 who held it at his Death, which was in the one and thirtieth of 
Edward
 the first, and from him did it by the steps of several Generations descend to Sir 
Thomas Crioll,
 who was slain at the second Battle of Sr. 
Albans,
 tamely, and in cold Blood; that is, he was beheaded by Queen 
Margaret,
 wife to King 
Henry
 the sixth, in the thirty eighth of that Prince's Raign, because he had been an eager Partisan of the House of 
Yorke,
 and being thus infortunately cut off, left that great Estate he was possest of, in this County, to two Daughters and Co-heirs, one of which was matched for his second wife to 
John Fogg
 of 
Repton
 Esq; Son and Heir of Sir 
William Fogg,
 and he had Issue by her 
Thomas Fogg,
 Serjeant Porter of 
Callis
 Esquire, a Place of eminent Trust and Concernment in those Times. And he ended in two Daughters and Co-heirs; 
Anne
 first matched to Mr. 
William Scott,
 Brother of Sir 
Reginald;
 and secondly, to Mr. 
Henry Isham,
 and 
Alice
 first wedded to 
Edward Scott,
 of the 
Moat
 in 
Sussex
 Esquire, and after to Sir 
Robert Oxenbridge,
 of the County of 
South-hampton;
 but the Moity of this Mannor of 
Hamme,
 upon the dividing the Estate into equal Portions, fell to be the Inheritance of 
Edward Scott,
 in Right of 
Alice
 his wife, and his Descendant in our Grand-fathers Remembrance alienated all his Interest and Concernment here, to 
Bois
 of 
Betshanger,
 whose Successor Mr. 
John Bois
 of 
Betshanger
 Esquire, is now entirely possest of this Mannor; as namely, of that Moity, which came over to this Family, by Purchase from 
Oxenbridge,
 as well as of that, which devolved to this Name, by Purchase from 
Scott.


Harbledowne
 in the Hundred of 
Westgate,
 though at present but an obscure Village, and not of much Eminence, was in Time of more ancient Date famous for three memorable Places. First, for an old Chappel situated upon the Margin of that Precipice which overlooks that way which leads to 
Canterbury.
 In which Oratory, as Tradition informs us, was preserved the Slipper of 
Thomas Becket,
 taken from one of his Feet after his being destroyed at his own Church at 
Canterbury,
 and which, as Report insinuates, was bespattered with his Blood; this being curiously enchased with Diamonds (so much did those Times dote on this then reputed Saint and Mar∣tyr) was let down for Passengers, who travelled to 
Canterbury
 to offer up their Ori∣zons at his Shrine, to adore with a kiss; nor was it returned, but full fraighted and laden with the Benevolences of devoted Pilgrims.


The second was 
Polres,
 which anciently had and still keeps the Repute of a Man∣nor; 
John de Polre,
 Son of 
John de Polre
 payd respective Aid for it, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third; and when after some expiration of Time, this Family began to find the common Sepulcher which wairs upon all Humane Glory, Decay and Oblivion; the 
Martins,
 a Name of generous extraction in this Track, stept in and by Purchase became Lords of the Fee, and held it, till the Name being con∣tracted into 
Anne
 Sole Daughter and Heir of 
Jo. Martin
 by marriage with 
Roger Brent;
 it was knit to the Patrimony of that Family, and so for some years remained un∣dissolved, till the Union by Sale was broken; and not long since passed over to

Sir 
Thomas Bind;
 where, at present, the Possession is wound up with the other De∣measne of that Family.


The Mannor of 
Beverley
 is a third place of Note in 
Harbledowne.
 It was the Sear of the ancient Family of 
Beverley,
 before they removed to 
Tancrey
 Island in 
Ford∣wich;
 and having remained Proprietaries of it many Generations, by Efflux and Descent it was guided down to 
William Beverley
 Esquite, from whom the Title eb∣bed away, and in whom the Name determined; for, he deceasing without Issue Male, 
Beatrix
 was his only Daughter and Heir, who was matched to 
Thomas Nor∣ton
 Esquire, by which Alliance, the Title of this place became inter-woven with his Inheritance, and continued clasped up in it, until the middle of the Raign of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was conveyed to 
Merseday,
 in which Family it had a setled Residence, until some sew years since the Mutation of Sale brought it to one Mr. ....... 
Richardson
 for its Proprietary.


Lanfranck,
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 in the year 1071. Founded an Hospital at 
Harbledowne
 for Lepers, employed afterwards to the Use of aged people. 
William Wittlesey
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 in the year 1371. founded a Chauntry here, and de∣dicated it to the Honor of St. 
Nicholas,
 which Foundation, in the year 1402. Was by Arch-bishop 
Arundell
 fully ratified and confirmed.


Nether-Hardres
 in the Hundred of 
Bridge
 and 
Petham,
 is eminent for two Places situ∣ated within the Precincts and Ambuts of it. The first is 
Hepington,
 which certainly was anciently the 
Chichs
 of the 
Dungeon
 in 
Canterbury;
 for I have seen a Record, wherein 
Nicolas Mesingham
 releases his Right in this and divers other Lands confining on 
Can∣terbury
 to 
Tho. Chich.
 But let it be granted, it was theirs; certainly the Title was very vo∣latile and incertain; for I find the 
Foggs
 when they expired, to be next in Possession of it, which was as high as the entrance into the Raign of 
Hen.
 the fourth. And here for some Ages the Title fixt it self, till at length the Fatality of Time passed it over by Sale to 
Hales,
 one of whose Successors has lately sold the Mansion House to Sir 
Thomas Godfrey,
 but still preserves the Propriety of the Mannor it self in his Name.


Lindeshore,
 but vulgarly called 
Linsore,
 is the second Place that Objects it self to a Consideration. In the eighth of Edward the third an Original Fine represents it to be 
Thomas de Garwinton's;
 and here many years the Possession was resident, till 
Joan
 his Niece, became (by Reason her Nephew 
Thomas Garwinton,
 Grand-child to this 
Thomas de Garwinton
 died without Issue) the Heir General of this Family, and she being married to 
Richard Haut,
 a Cadet of the 
Hauts
 of 
Hautsborne, alias Bishops-Bourne,
 made this, part of their Demeasne; but this Name not long after concluding in 
Margery Haut,
 Sole Daughter and Heir to 
Richard Haut;
 she be∣ing made the wife of 
William Isaack
 of 
Blackmansbery
 in 
Bridge,
 involved this in her Husbands Revenue, to which, after it had been some time united, it was by Sale from this Family carried over to 
John Brent
 Esquire: and this Name, some narrow Distance of Time after resolving into a Daughter and Heir called 
Margaret,
 who was married to 
John Dering,
 this became part of his Estate, and so continued till his Successor not long since sold it to 
Young
 of 
Canterbury.


Ʋpper
 or 
High Hardres,
 call it which you please, is placed in the Hundreds of 
Bridge, Petham,
 and 
Lovingborough,
 and gave name to a Family which certainly was of 
Saxon
-extraction, being compounded of two 
Saxon
 words; 
Erd,
 which signifies 
Earth;
 and 
Reys,
 which signifies 
Rivulets
 or 
small Drils of water.
 And, more to esta∣blish this Opinion, the Record of Doomes-day Book informs us, that 
Rodbertus de Hardres
 held half a Sulling or Ploughed-land in 
Liminge,
 in the twentieth year of 
William
 the Conqueror: this man was Ancestor to 
Philip de Hardres,
 who was one of the 
Recognitores magnae Assisae,
 in the Raign of King 
John,
 and his Son 
Philip de Hardres
 was a man of that Eminence under the Government of 
Henry
 the third, that he matched with 
Grace,
 Daughter and Heir of 
Stephen de Harengod;
 and I have seen an old Deed, which bears the form of a Latine Will, wherein this 
Stephen
 settles his Mannor of 
Elmested,
 and other Lands in this Track upon this 
Phi∣lip de Hardres;
 which Deed, though not dated, certainly relates to the Time of his Decease, which was in the one and fortieth of 
Henry
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 23.

But though this Mannor gave Sirname to 
Hardres;
 yet I find some others had an Interest in it, or at least some part of it, before it absolutely and solely came to confesse the Signory of this Name: 
Oliver de Bohun
 obtained a Charter of Free∣warren to his Lands at 
High Hardres,
 in the first year of 
Edward
 the first, which was renued to 
Nicolas de Hadlow
 or 
Hallow,
 who had not long before purchased the Inheritance of the above said Family at this place, in the one and twentieth year of the above mentioned Prince; but about the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, I find this Family quite dislodged from this place, and the Sole Demeasne and Pro∣priety wrapped up in the Family of 
Hardres:
 one of whom, by Name 
Henry Har∣dres,
 was one of the Justices of the Peace for this County, in the Time of 
Henry
 the fourth, and 
Henry
 the fifth; and from him, is descended Sir 
Richard Hardres,
 now Lord of this Mannor, who by a Title riveted and incorporated into him by a Chain of many uninterrupted Descents, does now claim the Signory of it.


Southcourt
 is another little Mannor in 
Upper Hardres,
 which in elder Times was entituled to the Propriety of 
Garwinton,
 a Family of signal Estimate and deep Root in this Track; for in an old Pedigree of 
Isaac,
 I discover that 
Thomas
 and 
William de Garwinton,
 were in the List of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen that accompanied 
Henry
 the third in his Expedition into 
Gascony,
 in the thirty seventh year of his Raign, which Design by the ill Conduct of his Affairs, and worse Managery of his Arms, was very ruinous and full of dysaster, to that Prince: But this Family, about the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the sixth (as I have shewed in 
Bekesbourne
) being ex∣tinguished without Issue; the Heir General brought this Mannor to be possest by 
Haut,
 from whom some two Descents after, the same Fatality brought it to be en∣joyed by 
Isaac,
 in whom the Propriety was resident, until the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth; and then it was conveyed to 
Diggs,
 a Family which had some Interest in it (as appears by the Book of 
Aid
) in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and some Descents before; and from this Name not long after the same Alienation carried it off to 
Hales
 of the 
Dungeon,
 in which Family it hath remained so constant, that it is the instant propriety of Mr. ..... 
Hales,
 a yonger Branch of that Family.


Hartlip
 in the Hundred of 
Milton
 hath divers places of Account in it: First, 
Gore Court,
 which was, in Times of an elder Aspect, the Inheritance of a Family of that Appellation: and I find that 
Henry
 at 
Gore
 held it at his Decease, in the one and thirtieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and remained with the Demeasne of this Name, until the Beginning of 
Henry
 the fifth, and then it was transmitted by Sale to 
Werdecre
 or 
Werdegar,
 and here it fixt, until the seventeenth year of King 
James:
 and then 
William Werdegar,
 Son of 
George Werdegar,
 passed it away to Sir 
Nicholas Tufton,
 whose Son and Heir 
John
 Earl of 
Thanet
 is now the Owner of it. 
Juliana de Leybourne
 had some Estate here at 
Gore Court,
 which, at her Decease, in the three and fortieth year of 
Edward
 the third, escheating with the Remainder of her Estate to the Crown, was by that Prince, in the fiftieth year of his Govern∣ment, settled upon the Abby of St. 
Mary Grace
 on Tower-hill, which he had be∣fore founded in the twenty fourth year of his Raign, and lay involved in the Pa∣trimony of that Cloister, until the general suppression, and then it was granted by 
Henry
 the eighth to 
William Werdegar,
 whose Successor sold it with that part of it, which was alwaies of secular Interest, to Sir 
Nicolas Tufton.


Popes-hall
 in this Parish had Owners likewise of that Sirname, who likewise were entituled to some Estate at 
Gaesden
 in 
Tenterden,
 and continued Lords of this Seat, until the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then it was by 
Richard Pope
 Gentleman, transmitted by Sale to 
Christopher Bloer,
 by whose Daughter and Heir called 
Olympia Bloer,
 it devolved to be the Inheritance of Mr. 
John Tufton
 Ance∣stor to the Right Honorable 
John
 Earl of 
Thanet,
 now Possessor of it.


Ealgar
 or 
Ealdigar,
 now vulgarly by melting away the L, called 
Eager Court
 or 
Eagar Croft,
 was anciently, as appears by several old Deeds without Date, the Patrimony of 
William de Elmested,
 but continued not long in this Family; for in the thirteenth year of 
Edward
 the first, I find it folded up in the Inheritance of 
Roger de Northwood,
 and in this Name the Title was resident until the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was transplanted by Sale into 
Norton
 of 
Borden,
 from whom

in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, part of it was passed away by Sale to 
Champneys,
 and in the eighth year of that Prince, the Remainder was by the same Fatality, brought to confesse the Signory of the above-mentioned Family, from whom, 
Thomas Rider,
 held it in Lease, in the Reign of 
Henry
 the seventh; and in the seventeenth year of that Prince, passed away all his Interest and concernment in it to 
Mark Harris,
 but the Propriety of this place, continued still in 
Champneys.
 And from him, did part of it, in the twenty fourth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, passe back again by Sale to 
Norton,
 and the Remainder in the thirty second year of that King's raign, was by the same conveyance wholly remitted to the above re∣cited Family, and made its aboad here untill the fourth and fifth year of 
Philip
 and 
Mary;
 and then 
John Norton,
 by Sale conveyed his Right in it, to 
Gilbert Fremlin,
 and he in the fifteenth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 alienated all his Con∣cernment in it, to 
John Palmer
 Esquire, Father of Sir 
Anthony Palmer,
 and Grand∣father of 
Dudley Palmer
 Esquire, the instant Possessor of it.


There is a Mannor in this Parish, vulgarly and corruptly called 
Grayney,
 but in old Deeds 
Graveney,
 as being indeed the Patrimony of a Family of that Sirname: of which Stem was 
Stephen de Graveney,
 whom, as private Record informs me, held it in the raign of 
Edward
 the first, and in his Descendants, I find it successively constant and fixed, untill the Reign of 
Henry
 the sixth. And from that Prince's Rule, I must make a leap to the Government of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then I find it in the Tenure of 
John Mayney
 of 
Biddenden
 Esquire, great Grandfather of Sir 
John Mayney
 of 
Linton
 Knight and Baronet, the present Lord of the Fee.


Hartley
 in the Hundred of 
Acstane,
 made up a part of that Patrimony, which came within the Circle of that Revenue, which owned for Proprietaries the Lords 
Mont∣chensey,
 whose capitall Seat was at 
Swanscamp,
 where I shall treat more largely of them; but it seems they had a special regard to this Mannor, for 
Warren de Montchensey,
 obtained a Charter of Free-warren to 
Hartley
 in the thirty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third, and left it enobled and secured with this Franchise to his only Son, 
William de Montchensey,
 who dying without Issue, 
Joan
 his Sister and Heir by marching with 
William de Valence
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 entituled him to this Mannor, and she held it at her Death, which was in the first year of 
Edw.
 the second: from whom it devolved to her Son 
Aymer de Valence,
 who dying without Issue-male in the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 second; 
Isabell de Valence
 his Heir Generall, united it to the Inheritance of her Husband 
Lawrence de Hastings,
 afterwards Earl of 
Pembroke,
 from whom it came down to his Grandchild 
John de Hastings.
 And he deceasing without Issue, in the year 1389, left it to his Kinsman 
Reginald Grey,
 and he brings a pleading for this and other Land, against 
John le Scroope,
 in the fifteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, and in the second year of 
Henry
 the fourth, as appears by the Book of 
Dover
 in the Exchequer, he was peaceably fixed in the Possession, and was a person of considerable Rank and importance in those Times, for he bore a pair of gilt Spurs at the Coronation of the abovesaid Prince. But no eminence of Birth or Dignity can chain the Possession of a place to a Family, when the Title leans upon the Wheel of an inconstant and ebbing Estate. For the Revolution of Sale about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, carried it from this Name to 
Penhale,
 and 
John
 the Son of 
Em∣ma Penhale,
 as appears by the Book of 
Dover
 in the Exchequer, held it in the second year of 
Edward
 the fourth, but the Propriety was not long constant in this Family: for about the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, I find it in the Te∣nure of 
Cressell,
 but it was not long permanent in this Family neither: for about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, it was by Sale transplanted into 
Ballard,
 and here the Possession rested untill the latter end of 
Edward
 the sixth; and then it was alienated to 
William Sydley
 Esquire, Ancestor to Sir 
Charles Sydley
 Baronet, who now is entituled to the Right and Propriety of it.


Hastingleigh
 in the Hundred of 
Bircholt,
 did anciently confesse the noble Fami∣ly of 
Haut,
 to be its Proprietaries, and was in their Possession untill the begin∣ning of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then 
Edward Haut
 passed it away to 
Robert Poy∣nings


of 
Ostenhanger,
 and in the Revenue of this Family was enwrapt, untill the Decease of Sir 
Edward Poynings;
 in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and he dying without any Issue of his Body lawfully begotten, (and there being none that could justly entitle himself by Right of Blood or Alliance to his Possessions) it devolved by Escheat to the Crown, and K. 
Edward
 the sixth, in the last year of his reign, by Royal Concession invested the Right of this Mannor in the City of 
London,
 and there it is still resident.


Hawkherst
 in the Hundred of 
Barnefield,
 was granted by 
William
 the Conquerour to the Mannor of 
Wye,
 which with all its Appendages, was to hold of the Abby of 
Battle,
 and remains (though that Abby be supprest) a Member or Limb of that Court to this Day.


Congerherst
 in this Parish, was a Mansion that formerly gave Seat and Sirname to a Family so called, and which in a Successive Series did relate to this Name, untill 
Mildred Congerherst,
 Sole Daughter and Heir of 
Thomas Congerherst,
 matching with 
Thomas Scott,
 made this the Propriety of that Family, to which it is still united.


The Royalty and Rents of 
Haukherst
 upon the Suppression of the Abby of 
Bat∣tle,
 were in the thirty third year of 
Henry
 the eighth, granted to

 Sir 
John Baker
 Attorney Generall, and Chancellor of the Exchequer to that Prince, King 
Edward
 the sixth, and Queen 
Mary;
 but Differences and Clashings, breaking out between the Descendant of Sir 
John Baker,
 and the Heir of the Lord 
Hunsdon,
 Lord of 
Wye,
 touching claims; to bury all future Animosities in Amity and mutual Com∣pliance, Sir 
Henry Baker,
 in the seventeenth year of King 
James,
 conveyed it to 
Henry Cary
 Lord 
Hunsdon,
 now Earl of 
Dover;
 who some years since, passed it away to Sir 
Thomas Finch,
 Father to 
Heneage
 Earl of 
Winchelsey,
 now Lord of the Fee.


Haukherst
 had a Market anciently, now shrunk into Disuse, on the Tuesday, and a yearly Fair three Days, 
viz.
 the Vigil, the Day of St. 
Lawrence,
 and the Day subsequent to it, both procured by the Abbot of 
Battle,
 (as the original patent instructs me) in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the first.


Hawking
 in the Hundred of 
Folkstone
 contains two little Mannors within its Verge, which must not be passed over in Silence. The first is 
Bilchester,
 which belonged to the Knights Templers, but upon their Suppression, in the second year of 
Edward
 the second, it escheated to the Crown, and remained there untill new provision was made, by the Statute called 
Statutum de Terris Templariorum,
 passed in the seventeenth year of the abovesaid Prince, to enstate it on the Knights Hospitalers, and make it part of their Revenue, and accordingly was united to their Patrimony, nor was any hand so bold as to tear it off; untill the generall Suppression of this Order, in the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, did invest it in the Crown: and that Prince in the thirty third year of his Reign granted it to Sir 
Anthony Aucher
 in Lease: and he not long after, assigned it to 
Thomas Sommersall,
 by whom it was made over to 
Richard Simonds,
 but the Fee-simple continued in the Crown, untill the year 1648.


The second is 
Fleggs Court,
 which was folded up in that Demeasne, which re∣lated to the Abby of St. 
Radigunds,
 and upon the Suppression of that Cloister, was exchanged by 
Henry
 the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his Reign, for o∣ther Lands with 
Thomas Cranmer
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and so remained free from violation, untill these Times wrapt it up in the Demeasne of that See.


Hedcorne
 in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne,
 containd within its Limits, First 
Moden∣den,
 vulgarly called 
Mottenden,
 where was a Monastery for Monks of the Order of 
Crouched Friers,
 and founded by Sir 
Ric. de Rokesley:
 the Head of which Covent, was called Minister, and in the cloudy Times of Popery, was much resorted unto by the enchanted Vulgar, by reason of some special Priviledges they were endowed with, as of granting of pardons, and others of the like Nature: all which met with their Sepulcher in the Ruine of this Abbey, and that fatall and destructive Wound it received in its finall Dissolution, from the Hand of 
Henry
 the eighth,

which Prince, upon its escheating to the Crown, granted it in the thirty sixth year of his Government, to Sir 
Anthony Aucher.
 And he, in the second year of 
Edward
 the sixth, passed it away to Sir 
Walter Henley,
 by whose Daughter and Coheir it came to 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bedgebury
 Esquire; who in the sixth year of 
Edward
 the sixth, conveyed it to 
Christopher Sackvill
 Esquire, from which Fami∣ly in our Grand-fathers Remembrance it came over by Sale to 
Franklin;
 and his Successor 
George Franklin
 dying without Issue, bequeathed it by Testament to his Kinsman Sir 
William Sydley,
 whose Grand-child Sir 
Charles Sydley
 Baronet, is in∣tituled to the instant Fee-simple of it.


Kents Chauntry
 is a second Place of Account in 
Headcorne,
 called so because here was a 
Chauntry
 founded by one 
John Kent,
 in the sixth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, and a large Demeasne settled upon it, to support the 
Chauntry
 Priest that was to offi∣ciate there; all which upon the suppression was in the two and thirtieth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, granted to Sir 
Anthony St. Leger,
 whose Son Sir 
Warham St. Leger,
 about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 passed it away by Sale to 
Be∣resford
 of 
Westernham,
 from which Family in our Memory it went away to 
South∣land;
 and he very lately hath alienated it to Mr. ...... 
Belcher,
 now Minister of Gods Word at 
Ulcombe.


Kelsham
 is a third Seat in this Parish, which may challenge our Consideration; because it was the Residence formerly (though now transformed into a Farm-house) of Gentlemen known by this Sirname, who might have been ranged and marshal∣led amongst the prime Gentlemen of this County, and bare for their Coat-
Armour Sable,
 a 
Fesse
 engrailed 
Argent,
 between three 
Garbes, Or.
 One of them stood depicted in coloured Glasse in the Church windows, with his 
Arms
 upon his 
Tabard;
 but by the Assaults of Age, and other wild and sacrilegious Impressions, is now utterly defaced and demolished; nor is the Family in any better condition, that having many years since deserted the Possession of this Place; for about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth
 it was conveyed to 
Johnson:
 from whom very lately, it is come over by Purchase to 
Stringer.


Rishford
 is a fourth Mannor circumscribed within the Bounds of 
Headcorne,
 which in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, was possest by a Family called 
Pend,
 who (as it appears by the Book of 
Aid
) paid a respective supply for it, at making the Black Prince Knight. And here is much Land in this Parish, which bears the Name of 
Pend,
 a probable Argument of the Antiquity of it in this Track: nor did it yeild to Time, or desert the Possession of this Place, but was constant in the Tenure of it, until that Age we call our Grand-fathers, and then it was alie∣nated to a Family called 
Dominie, alias Fullaker;
 the last of which Name at this Place was 
Christopher Dominie, alias Fullaker,
 who not many years since passed it away to Mr. 
John Hulks
 of 
Newenham,
 whose Son and Heir Mr. 
Stephen Hulks,
 does now possesse the Signory of it.


Herietsham
 in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne,
 was anciently a Limb of that Estate which was entituled to the Possession of the Noble Family of 
Crescy: Hugh de Crescy
 died seised of the Mannor, in the forty seventh year of King 
Henry
 the third, and his Grand-mother 
Margery
 was Daughter of 
William de Cheyney
 of 
Patricks∣bourne Cheyney,
 as appears 
Claus.
 52. 
Henrici tertii Memb.
 6. 
in Dorso.
 But he de∣ceased without Issue, and so his Brother 
Stephen de Crescy
 became his Heir and Lord of 
Herietsham,
 and in this Family it continued until the latter end of 
Edward
 the second, and then the Possession of this Place went from 
Crescy
 into 
Northwood,
 as is manifest by the Book of 
Aid,
 where 
Roger de Northwood
 is represented to have held this Mannor, and have paid a proportionate 
Aid
 for it, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth of 
Edward
 the third, and he deceased seised of it in the thirty fifth year of that King's Raign. And in this Name it remained fixed until the Beginning of 
Henry
 the fifth, and then it was transplanted into the Inte∣rest of a Family called 
Adam,
 who had large Possessions in 
Essex,
 and bore for their Paternal Coat vert, a 
Plain Crosse, Or;
 and 
John Adam
 held it at his Death, which was in the ninteenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and left it to his Son 
John Adam;
 af∣ter whom I do not find any more of the Family possest of it: for in the Raign of

Edward
 the fourth, I discover by some Court Rols that 
James Peckham
 of 
Yaldham
 Esquire, was Lord of the Fee; and 
Reginald Peckham
 his Son, that was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the last year of 
Henry
 the seventh, kept his Shrivalty at 
Herietsham;
 but after this, it was of no long continuance in this Family; for in the fifteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, 
Reginald Peckham
 passes it away by Sale to 
Edward Scott
 Esquire, and he not long after transmits it by the same conveyance to 
John Hales
 one of the Barons of the Exchequer, and from him one Moiety of it went away by Sale, in the twenty eighth of 
Henry
 the eighth, to 
John Norton
 Esquire; and the other not long after to Sir 
Anthony St. Leger. Norton
 conveyed his proportion to 
Ashburnham
 of 
Sussex;
 and both 
St. Leger
 and 
Ashburnham,
 in the Time almost of our Fathers Remembrance, by a concurrent Sale demised their joint Right in it to Sir 
John Steed,
 whose Successor, Doctour ...... 
Steed,
 Doctour of the Civil Law, is the instant Proprietary of 
Herietsham.


East Farbon
 and 
Bentley,
 are two little Mannors in this Parish, which belonged to the Priory of 
Leeds;
 and upon the suppression, were made parcel of the Revenue of the Crown, and remained there until King 
Edward
 the sixth, in the fourth year of his Raign, granted them to Sir 
Anthony St. Leger,
 whose great Grand-child Sir 
Warham St. Leger,
 about the Beginning of King 
James,
 passed them away to Mr. ........ 
Steed,
 Father to Doctour 
Steed;
 who upon the Decease of his Nephew 
Cromer Steed
 without Issue Male, as Reversioner in Entail, is now settled in the Possession of these two Mannors.


West Farbon,
 sometimes in old Deeds, called little 
Herietsham,
 lies likewise in this Parish, and was granted in the two and fiftieth year of 
Henry
 the third, to 
William de Valentia,
 Earl of 
Pembrooke:
 But after him I track no more of the Fa∣mily at this place; For in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at making the Black Prince Knight, it was held by 
John Pennington;
 and in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, when 
Blanch
 that Prince's Daughter was married, it acknow∣ledged it self to be under the Signory of the above mentioned Family, and conti∣nued divers years after united to their Interest: But in the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, I find them quite vanished from the Possession, and a Family called 
Hede
 or 
Head,
 entituled to the Inheritance; and in this Name did it make its abode, until the Raign of 
Edward
 the sixth, and then it was conveyed by Sale to 
St. Leger,
 where it rested until the Beginning of King 
James,
 and then it was alienated by Sir 
War∣ham St. Leger
 to Mr. 
Benedict Barneham,
 who left four Daughters and Co-heirs, matched to 
Audley, Constable, Doble,
 and 
Soame,
 who equally shared his Estate; and this upon the distinguishing of it into just Proportions, augmented the Re∣venue of 
Constable.


Harbilton
 is another ancient Mannor in 
Herietsham;
 It was, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, the Inheritance of 
Thomas de Malmains;
 for at that Time, as appears by the Book of 
Aid,
 he paid a subsidiary supply for this and other Lands, at making the Black Prince Knight. After this Family was mouldred away, which was before the End of 
Richard
 the second, I find the Family of 
Maris
 was settled in the Inheritance. 
William Maris
 who was Esquire, first to 
Henry
 the fifth, and after to Cardinal 
Kempe,
 was Possessor of it, and so was his Son 
William Maris
 Esquire, who was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the one and twentieth year of 
Henry
 the sixth. After this Family, I find the 
Moils,
 about the latter end of the former Prince's Government, to have stept into the Inheritance; the first of which was 
Walter Moile,
 who was Justice of the Peace for this County, in the Raign both of 
Henry
 the sixth and 
Edward
 the fourth, and left this, and a spatious Patrimony besides, to his Heir 
John Moile
 Esquire, whose Son 
Robert Moile,
 about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, alienated it to 
Geffrey St. Leger
 Esquire, from whom the Title for many years streamed into this Family, until in that Time, which fell under our Grand-fathers cognizance, it was passed away by Sale to 
Steed,
 Ancestor to Do∣ctour 
Steed,
 who is the instant Possessor of it.


Marley
 and 
Hopme Mill,
 and in other Copies written 
Holme Hill,
 did with their Income support the 
Chaunter
 of the Canons of 
Pauls,
 to whose office they were annexed. A Place certainly in elder Times of important Account; for in the Re∣cords of 
Christ-church,
 from whence 
Pitseus
 hath collected his Inventory of the

English Writers, there is mention of one 
Joannes de Teneth,
 a Man as exemplary for his Piety, as he was eminent for his Learning, who was Chaunter to that Covent; but this Office being entombed in the Ruines of those Canons of 
Paul,
 in the Gene∣ral suppression; the Revenue which upheld it, was fixed in the Crown, until King 
Edward
 the sixth granted both these Places to Sir 
Edward VVotton,
 one of his Privy Councel, whose Grand-child Sir 
Thomas VVotton,
 was by King 
James
 invested with the Dignity and Title of 
Thomas
 Lord 
VVotton
 of 
Marley,
 and was by 
Thomas
 Lord 
Wotton
 his Son, settled in Marriage upon his Daughter 
Katherine VVotton
 with 
Henry
 Lord 
Stanhop,
 Son and Heir apparent to 
Philip
 Earl of 
Chesterfeild,
 and is at this instant in relation to the former settlement devolved in Abeyance to her Son, the Right Honorable 
Philip Stanhop,
 the present Earl of 
Chesterfeild.


Hern
 in the Hundred of 
Blengate,
 has nothing memorable in it but 
Haw-house,
 a Limb or portion of that wide Demeasne that the eminent Family of 
Apulderfield
 held in this Track; and when this Name that had been deeply rooted in Antiquity,

 and had spread to a large extent, in the Latitude of it, was circumscribed in a Daughter and Heir called 
Eliz.
 matched with Sir 
Jo. Phineux:
 this Seat was made by Female In∣terest, an Addition to the Income of this Family, and here it remained undivi∣ded from it, till this Name determined in 
John Phineux
 Esqu; issued from a youn∣ger Line of this Family, who left only one Daughter and Heir, married to Sir 
John Smith,
 Grandfather to 
Philip
 Viscount 
Strangford,
 who in relation to that Right this Match has invested in him, is now the instant Proprietary.


Seas
 or 
At Seas Court
 is likewise involved within the Sphere and Limits of this Parish: it was in Records anciently styl'd so, though now through Disuse it be lan∣guished into an Intermission, having lost its Name, and the Estimate of a Man∣nor likewise. For a Succession of some Ages, it owned the Name and Interest of 
At Sea,
 till Fate and Time, that are the common Sepulchre of Families, by Sale gave up the Fee-simple, an Age or two since, to 
Knowler,
 whose Heir does yet en∣title himself by Right of his Predecessours purchase, to the Possession of it.


Hernehill
 in the Hundred of 
Boughton,
 has two Places in it, which may make it remarkable: First, 
Durgall Stroude,
 which was, in Times of higher Track, the 
Martin's
 a very noble and illustrious Family in this Territory, whose capital or principal Seat was at 
Graveney,
 not far distant: and here, after it had flourisht, by the Decursion of some Ages, it fell into a Daughter and Heir, called 
Margaret,
 Sole Daughter and Heir to 
Matthew Martin,
 who was married to 
William Norton
 of 
Cokesdish
 in 
Feversham,
 and in her Right did he become Proprietary of this Man∣nor, from whose Heir 
Thomas Norton,
 the Property or Fee-simple was by Sale trans∣ferred into the Possession of Sir 
John Wild
 of 
Canterbury,
 to whose Heirs General the Propriety of this Mannor does at present relate.


Secondly, there is another Seat in this Parish, vulgarly called 
Apes Court, alias Lockley;
 but, indeed, in truer Orthography writ 
Epes-Court,
 a place so despicable, that it had not been worth the Memoriall, but that in all the circumstances of pro∣bability the 
Epes
's of 
Canterbury
 assumed, if not Seat, yet at least Sirname from thence; and it is the more possible, because the 
Epes's
 have been ancient Tenants to the Church of 
Canterbury,
 for the Mannor of 
Seas-alter,
 divided by a neer Distance from this place; in Ages of a more modern Date, the 
Nevinsons
 were the Lords of the Fee, and certainly this was their ancient Mansion, before they were trans∣planted to 
Eastry;
 this being sold in the Raign of King 
James
 by Sir 
Roger Nevinson
 to Sir 
John Wild
 of 
Canterbury,
 in whose Heirs General (
Dudley Wild
 Esquire, his only surviving Son being lately deceased without Issue) the Possession continues fixed.


Hever
 in the Hundreds of 
Somerden
 and 
Ruxley,
 had in elder Times a Castle,

 which was the Capital Seat or Mannor built by 
Thomas de Hever,
 who had liberty by the Charter of 
Edward
 the third, granted to him in the fourth of his Raign, not only to embattle his Mansion here, but likewise had Free-warren annexed to his Lands in this place. 
William Hever
 deceased without Issue Male, and left only two

Daughters and Co-heirs; 
Joane
 married to 
Reginald Cobham
 of 
Sterborough,
 and the other wedded to 
Brocas,
 whence in Records it is sometimes called 
Hever Cobham
 and 
Hever Brocas,
 and when the 
Cobhams
 went out, the 
Bullens
 were the immedi∣ate Purchasers; for 
Geffrey Bullen
 purchased this Place, and his Grand-child Sir 
Thomas Bullen
 Knight of the Garter, and Earl of 
VVilts,
 lived here, who was Father to 
Anne Bullen,
 Wife to 
Henry
 the eighth; and as he had here his Habitation, so likewise he has here his Sepulcher, and lieth emtombed in 
Hever-church;
 but when his Son 
George
 Viscount 
Rochford,
 upon pretence of some black Crimes acted against the Majesty of 
Henry
 the eighth, fell under the Censure of High Trea∣son; this upon his Attainder or Conviction was escheated to the Crown, and be∣gan to be reputed a Mansion of some Estimate, when 
Anne
 of 
Cleve
 for some Time lived here, and made it her residence; but, in Times subsequent to this, I find it eminent for nothing, till King 
James
 granted it to Sir 
Edward Waldgrave,
 whose Successor yet possesses it.


Heys
 in the Hundred of 
Rokesley,
 was formerly under the Jurisdiction of the 
Squirries,
 a Family under a signal Notion of Eminence in this part of the County, and was concluded some Ages within their Patrimony, till it was bounded by two Daughters and Co-heirs; one of which called 
Dorothy,
 was married to 
Richard Mervin,
 the other styled 
Margaret,
 matched to Sir 
William Cromer,
 who in Right of their Father 
Thomas Squirrie,
 who held 
Heys
 in the eighteenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, entituled themselves to vast Possessions in these parts; but this Mannor upon the Division accrued to 
Mervin,
 and in his Posterity some years it found an abode, till by Sale the Interest was transmitted to 
Peche;
 but Sir 
John Peche
 de∣ceasing without any Issue Male, his only Daughter 
Elizabeth
 married to 
John Hart
 Esq; extracted from the 
Harts
 of the County of 
Hertford,
 was found to be his Heir, and in Relation to that Mixture, or conjunction, does this Family yet continue Pro∣prietaries of it.


Hinxhill
 in the Hundreds of 
Chart
 and 
Longbridge,
 was part of that Estate which belonged to the Family of 
Strabolgie,
 Earls of 
Atholl;
 but whether or not it de∣volved to 
Alexander Balioll,
 Earl of 
Atholl
 by 
Isabell
 his Wife, one of the Co-heirs of 
Richard de Dover,
 Lord of 
Chilham,
 is altogether incertain; because no Re∣cord that I ever yet saw, reaches beyond the above mentioned 
Alexander;
 this mans Son was 
John
 Earl of 
Strabolgie
 and 
Athol,
 who having forfeited it in the Raign of 
Edward
 the first, whilst he endevoured to buoy up the Liberty of his Country of 
Scotland,
 which then seemed to be sunk in its own Ruines, being trampled upon by the succesful Attempts of that Prince, it for some years encrea∣sed the Royal Revenue, until 
David de Strabolgie,
 Earl of 
Atholl,
 the first that altered his Name from 
Balioll
 to 
Strabolgie,
 having expiated his Fathers Disservices, by being constant to the Party and Interest of 
Edward
 the second, against the Eruptions of the Nobility, which then bandied in Combinations against him, had this with much other Land, restored to him in the fifteenth year of that Prince; from whom it descended to 
David de Strabolgie
 his Grand-child, who dying in the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, left it to 
Philippa
 his Daughter and Co-heir matched to 
John Halsham
 of 
Sussex,
 by whom she had Issue 
Hugh Halsham,
 who about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, passed it away to Sir 
Robert Scott,
 Liev∣tenant of the Tower of London 1424. And he concluding in 
Alice Scott,
 a Female Inheritrix, she by matching with 
William Kempe,
 Nephew of Cardinal 
Kempe,
 linked it to the Demeasne of that Family, and here it remained until Sir 
William Kempe,
 about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, alienated it to 
Browning,
 from which Family, about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 it passed away by Sale to Mr. 
Robert Edolph,
 whose Grand-child Mr. 
Robert Edolph
 dying in the year 1632. without Issue, gave his Interest in it with 
Godchepes
 to his beloved Wife: 
Cicelie Edolph
 remarried to Sir 
Francis Knowls
 of 
Reading,
 and she passed away the Moiety of it (the other proportion of it being invested in Mr. 
Thomas Edolph
 the third Bro∣ther) with 
Godchepes,
 now called 
Goodchepes,
 to her Husbands second Brother, Mr. 
Samuel Edolph,
 who some few years since conveyed his Interest in 
Hinxhill
 with

this by Testament to his Brother in Law Mr. 
John Angell
 of 
Croherst
 in 
Surrey,
 to discharge Debts and Legacies; and he, that he might the more effectually per∣form the Contents of the Will, hath lately passed away the Moiety of 
Hinxhill
 with 
Goodchepes,
 to 
Edward Chowte
 of 
Surrenden Chowte
 in 
Bethersden
 Esquire, lately deceased.


W. liham
 is another Mannor in 
Hinxhill,
 which was folded up in the vast Demeasne of 
Crioll,
 by whose Daughter and Heir it came to 
Rokesley,
 and by the Female In∣heritrix of 
Rokesley
 to 
Poynings:
 in which Name it continued until the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then Sir 
Edward Poynings
 dying without any lawful Issue; after a signal and solemne Inspection, by several Inquisitions into his colla∣teral Alliance, no Claim being laid unto his Estate, this Mannor escheated to the Crown, in the fourteenth year of that Prince, and then King 
Henry
 the eighth, by Grant passed it away to Sir 
Richard Damsell,
 who not long after transmitted his Right in it to 
Goldhill,
 who in our Grand-fathers Memory alienated it to Mr. 
Ro∣bert Edolph,
 whose Grand-child Mr. 
Robert Edolph
 gave it with his Interest in 
Hinx∣hill
 and 
Goodchepes
 to his Wife 
Cicelie Edolph,
 who passed away the Moiety to Mr. 
Samuel Edolph,
 and he devised it by Will to Mr. 
Angell,
 who hath transferred his Right in it by Sale to Mr. 
Edward Chowte.


The Farm called 
Godchepes
 or 
Goodchepes,
 in this Parish; for an unbroken Series of many Generations had Owners of that Sirname, as appears by an Inquisition taken after the Death of 
Thomas Godchepe,
 in the one and thirtieth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 47. and remained fastned to their Inheritance, until the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then by a strange and mysterious Fatality the Propriety of it was carried off, to 
Barrow.
 The Story is represented thus: 
John Bar∣row
 being an Atturney, was called to frame a Settlement by Deed of 
Thomas God∣chepe,
 and by his Direction was desired to insert eight Persons into the Deed, who were successively to inherit his Estate, and being asked by this 
John Barrow,
 whe∣ther he should adde the Names of any more, he was answered (because there had for∣merly been reciprocal Obligations of Friendship between them) that he should place his own next after those eight above mentioned. It pleased the eternal Arbiter of humane Affairs, so to order the vicissitude of things that those eight Persons recited in the Deed, deceased without Issue; so that his Estate here at 
Godchepe
 devolved to 
Barrow,
 as his Heir at Law, from whom by 
Elizabeth
 his eldest Daugh∣ter and Co-heir, it came to Mr. 
Robert Edolph.


Hoo
 gives Name to the Hundred wherein it is situated, and was a principal Branch of that Revenue, which fell under the Dominion of 
Bardolfe: Robert de Bardolfe
 held it under the Notion of a whole Knights Fee, as appears by the red Book kept in the Exchequer, in the Raign of 
Henry
 the second: and from him it came down to 
Hugh Bardolfe,
 who was rated for it after the same Account, in the second year of 
Richard
 the first; but 
Hugh
 Lord 
Bardolfe
 his Son, not long after concluded in three Daughters and Co-heirs. 
Mawde
 was matched to 
Nicholas Points, Margaret
 was married to 
Robert Aguillon,
 and 
Isolda
 was espoused to 
Henry
 Lord 
Grey
 of 
Cod∣nor,
 which divided the Inheritance of that Family at this Place. But that Propor∣tion of it which was annexed by this Alliance to 
Points
 and 
Aguillon,
 was passed away by a Joint Sale to 
John de la Pole,
 and he paid respective supply for his Lands at 
Hoo,
 which were rated at half a Knights Fee, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third; but before the latter end of 
Henry
 the fourth; this Family was worn out, and that Estate they held here was by Purchase involved and swallowed up in the Inheritance of 
Grey,
 who before was entituled to the Moiety of this Mannor, as descending from 
Henry
 Lord 
Grey
 of 
Codnor
 and 
Isolda
 his Wife, Co-heir to 
Hugh
 Lord 
Bardolfe,
 and in this Family did it continue until 
Henry
 Lord 
Grey
 of 
Codnor,
 in the twenty second year of 
Henry
 the sixth, dy∣ing without Issue Male, left it to be Patrimony of Daughters and Co-heirs, one of which brought it to be the Inheritance of the Lord 
Zouch;
 but in this Family it had not long remained, when 
John
 Lord 
Zouch
 having pursued the Interest of the House of 
Yorke,
 did exemplifie his Zeal to it, by his being embarked in the Cause and Quarrel of 
Richard
 the third, in that signal and fatal Encounter at 
Bosworth
 Feild,

where the Title of the two Houses 
Yorke
 and 
Lancaster
 was put to the bloody Arbitration of the Sword; for which, after the Crown and Scepter by that happy Contest devolved to 
Henry
 the seventh, he was in the first year of that Prince's Rule attainted, and his Estate here granted to Sir 
Henry Wiatt,
 one of the Privy Coun∣cell to the said Monarch, whose infortunate Grand-child Sir 
Thomas Wiatt,
 being likewise attainted in the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 it escheated, upon that Con∣fiscation, to the Crown, and there was lodged until King 
James,
 about the third year of his Raign granted it to 
Robert
 Earl of 
Salisbury,
 whose Son 
Robert
 Earl of 
Salisbury
 sold it 
quarto Caroli
 to Sir 
Edward Hales
 Knight and Baronet; from whom it is now come down to his Grand-child, Sir 
Edward Hales
 Baronet, in whose Revenue, it, at this instant, is involved.


Beluncle
 is another Seat in this Parish, whose Antiquity pleads for a Remem∣brance: the first Family whom I find in Record to have been possest of it was 
Foliot. Jordan de Foliot
 held it in the Time of 
Henry
 the second, and 
Richard
 the first, by the fifth part of a Knights Fee; and from him did it descend to 
Richard de Foliot,
 his Son and Heir, who in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third, passes it away by Fine to 
Reginald de Cobham,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 from the thirty third year of 
Henry
 the third, to the fortieth of that Prince, and was accounted one of the principal Seats which was couched in the Demeasne of this Family; and, in divers old Pedigrees and other Deeds, they are written 
Cobham
 of 
Beluncle.
 Of this Fa∣mily was 
Henry de Cobham,
 who was summoned to Parliament as Baron, in the seventh year of 
Edward
 the third: 
Stephen de Cobham,
 who was summoned in the eighteenth year of that Prince: And 
Thomas de Cobham,
 who was summoned as Baron, in the thirty eighth year of that Prince. And in 
Cobham,
 and then 
Brook,
 did it continue, until 
Henry
 Lord 
Cobham
 and his Brother 
George Brooke,
 in the first year of King 
James,
 being entangled in that cloudy Design of Sir 
Walter Rawleigh,
 which con∣tinues muffled up in a Mist until this Day, forfeited both their Estates, and the last his Life. But King 
James
 restored this to 
Henry
 Lord 
Cobham,
 who dying with∣out Issue it devolved to Sir 
William Brooke
 Son of 
George Brooke,
 and he likewise deceasing without Issue-male, in the year 1643. it came over to Sir 
John Brooke,
 now Lord 
Cobham,
 as Reversioner in Entail.


Hollingbourne
 in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne,
 was given to the Monks of 
Christ-church
 in 
Canterbury,
 for to supply them with Diet, by 
Athelstan
 Son of 
Ethelred,
 which Mannor he had before purchased of his Father; and in the year 909. with his Licence and Consent bestowed it on that Covent, free as 
Adisham.
 If you will discover how it was rated in the Conquerors Time, Doomesday Book thus repre∣sents it to you, 
Hollingbourne
 (saies that) 
est Mancrium Monachorum, & de Cibo corum & in Tempore Edwardi Regis se defendebat pro
 VI. 
Sullings, & nunc similiter. Et est appretiatum inter totum hoc Maneriam
 XXX 
lb.
 This being thus fixed, remain∣ed from the Original Donation, locked up in the Ecclesiastical Patrimony, until the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was surrendred into that King's Hands by the Prior and Monks of the Covent aforesaid, and he that year ex∣changed it with 
Thomas Cranmer
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury.


There was the Gallows which appertained to the Priory of 
Christ-church
 here erected at 
Hollingbourne,
 where those who had committed Murders, Felonies, or other Trespasses worthy of death, within the liberties of that Covent, were accor∣ding to their priviledge of 
Infangtheof
 and 
Outfangtheof,
 brought to exemplary pu∣nishment: See 
Somner Fol.

There is a Mannor in this Parish called 
Ripple,
 which had Owners of that Name; for in the thirtieth of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 91. I find that 
Richard de Ripple
 held this, and other Lands, which he had in Lease from the Priory of 
Christ-church
 at his Decease, but it only gave him Sirname, and then left his Family; for before the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, it went from this Name to Sir 
William Septuans,
 and he enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third; and transmitted it to his Son 
William Septuans,
 who not long after conveyed it to 
John Gower,
 in which Name it lay couched until the Raign of 
Henry
 the fourth; and then it was alienated to 
Brockhull,
 a Cadet of that Stock which

flourished so long at 
Calehill,
 and here it continued for many Descents in this Fa∣mily, until the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth:
 and then 
Henry Brockhull
 dying without Issue-male, 
Anne
 his only Daughter and Heir brought it to be the In∣heritance of Sir 
John Taylor,
 in which Family after it had lodged only until the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 it was passed away to Sir 
Martin Barnham.


Elnothington
 is another Mannor in this Parish, which had Owners likewise of that Sirname; for in a Deed of 
Adam de Twisdens,
 which bears Date from the one and twentieth of 
Edward
 the first, one 
William de Elnothington
 is Witness: But af∣ter this man, I find no more mention in any Record of the Name: In the Raign of 
Edward
 the third, I discover Sir 
Arnold St. Leger
 of 
Ulcombe
 to be possest of it, and in the forty second year he makes a Composition with divers of his Tenants for Lands that they held of this Mannor, and from him like an uninterrupted Thread, did the Title of this place passe thorough many Descents of this Family, until at last it devolved to Sir 
Anthony St. Leger,
 who almost in our Memory alienated it to Sir 
Thomas Colepeper.


Pen-Court
 is another Seat in 
Hollingbourne
 worthy our Notice. It was in elder Times the Patrimony of a Family called 
Pen;
 but whether the 
Pens
 of 
Codcot
 in the County of 
Bedford,
 were descended from them or not, is uncertain; in Brief, before the end of 
Edward
 the third, this Family was worn out, and then the 
Donets
 succeeded, but held this Seat not long: for by the Heir Generall it devol∣ved with much other Land to 
St. Leger
 of 
Ulcombe,
 and here it rested untill all∣most our Remembrance: and then it was passed away to Sir 
Thomas Colepeper;
 and he again conveyed it to Mr. 
Mark Questwood
 of 
London,
 who, upon his Decease, settled it for ever on the Company of Fishmongers in 
London.


Muston
 is likewise within the Verge of this Parish: upon perusall of the an∣cient Deeds and Court-rols, I found it to be written 
Moston,
 as giving Name, in the Raign of 
Edward
 the first, to a Family of that Appellation, which about the Beginning of 
Richard
 the second, was wholly crumbled away, and had sur∣rendred the Possession to 
Wood,
 in which Family the Inheritance hath ever since been permanent.


Greenway-court,
 is the last place considerable in this Parish; It was as high as the Conduct of any Evidence can guide me to discover, parcell of the Patrimony of 
At∣leeze,
 and Sir 
Richard Atleeze,
 dying without Issue, in the year 1394, gave it to his Brother 
Marcellus Atleeze,
 by whose Daughter and Coheir, it came to be possest by 
Valentine Barret
 of 
Pery-Court;
 and he, about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth, conveyed it to 
Fitz Water,
 in which Family it remained, untill the Raign of 
Edward
 the fourth; and then it was alienated to 
St. Leger,
 with whose Inheritance it continued, untill almost our Age; and then it was by Sale trans∣planted into Sir 
Alexander Colepeper,
 who upon his Decease, gave it to Sir 
John Colepeper
 of 
Losenham.


Hope
 in the Hundreds of 
Langport
 and St. 
Martins,
 hath nothing memorable in it but 
Crawthorn,
 which for those worthy persons, who have successively held it, calls for some Memorial; for first, the 
Cheyneys
 were (as appears by ancient Evidences) Lords of the Fee: and when they went out, the 
Henleys
 about the latter end of 
Hen.
 the eighth, were the next eminent Possessors of it: and in the Descendants of this Family, did the propriety reside, untill the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 and then it was alienated to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Borough
 of 
Sterborough,
 who not long after conveyed it to 
Tooke,
 of 
Bere
 in 
Westcliffe,
 from whom it came over to Mr. 
Charles Took
 of 
Bere,
 and he hath lately, by the Vicissitude of Sale, transplanted his Con∣cernment in it, to his Nephew Mr. 
Edward Chowte,
 who being lately deceased with∣out Issue-male, hath setled it on his only Brother Mr. 
George Chowte.


Higham
 in the Hundred of 
Shamell,
 had anciently a Nunnery: but the original Chartularies, and other Records being lost, the Founder is unknown. King 
Hen.
 the third, by a Charter of Inspection, as appears 
Carta
 11. 
parte secunda, Memb. septima,
 reviews the Liberties of this Cloister, and confirms them, and adds this Franchise or Immunity to the former, that this Parish lying couched in their

Demeasn, should hold a Fair on 
Michaelmas
 Day, and two days after. This Mannor, upon the Suppression, was by the Bounty of King 
Henry
 the eighth enstated for ever on St. 
Johns
 Colledge, in 
Cambridge,
 and there at present it continues.


The places of most eminence, which were of secular Interest, are 
Great
 and 
Little Okeley,
 which both were formerly united, though since dissever'd and pluck'd asunder by Sale. In the twentieth of 
Ed.
 the third, I find them wrapt up in the Possessions of 
John de St. Clere,
 who held them by the fourth part of a Knights Fee, of the Honor of 
Montchensey,
 that is of 
Swanscamp-Castle,
 from whose Descendant, about the lat∣ter end of 
Edward
 the fourth, they were both passed away to 
Neile
 of 
London,
 who about the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, conveyed 
Great Okeley
 to 
John Sydley
 Esquire, Ancestor to Sir 
Charles Sydley
 Baronet, the instant Inheritor of it. But little 
Okeley
 by the same Transmission was transferred to 
Colemeley
 or 
Cholmeley,
 who about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 resigned up his Interest by Sale to 
Thompson,
 from whom the ordinary Vicissitude of purchase not long since con∣ducted the Title down to 
Best.


Merston
 was formerly an independent Parish of it self, though since annexed to 
Higham,
 and had a Church dedicated to St. 
Giles,
 whose Ruines, in despight of the Impressions of Age, yet represent themselves to the smallest Glance of a curious Eye. It was, before it fell into this Darkness and Obscurity, made something il∣lustrious by being the Inheritance of 
John de St. Clere:
 and when this Family found its Tomb, the Name of 
Smith
 Stept in, and rose upon its Ruines. And when this was expired at this place, which was about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, 
Jordan
 put in his Claim to the Possession of it; but about the latter end of the above∣said Prince, I find this Family extinguished, because the propriety of this Mannor was by one of the above mentioned Names conveyed to 
Anthony Tutsham,
 who not long after alienated the premises to 
George Brooke
 Lord 
Cobham;
 from whom, by des∣cendant Right, the Interest of it is devolved to Sir 
John Brooke,
 restored to the Barony of 
Cobham
 by the late King at 
Oxford,
 who now possesses this place as Reversioner in Entail to Sir 
William Brooke,
 who dyed without Issue-male in the year 1643.


Horsmonden
 in the Hundreds of 
Brenchley, Horsmonden,
 and 
Larkefeild,
 was folded up in the Patrimony of 
Rokesley,
 a Family of a large Revenne, and as wide a Repute in this Track, from whom it descended to 
Richard de Rokesley,
 by whose Inheritrix it was linked to the Patrimony of 
Thomas de Poynings,
 from whom by the steps of divers Descents it went down to Sir 
Edward Poynings,
 who deceasing without any lawfull Issue, in the twelfth of 
Henry
 the eighth: and there being not any that could by a pretence of collateral Alliance entitle themselves to his Estate, the Crown made it its own Interest by Escheat, and then the above said Prince, in the thirty sixth of his Raign, granted it to 
Richard Darell:
 and his Son 
George Da∣rill,
 in the tenth of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 conveyed it to 
Richard Paine,
 who not long after alienated it to 
Beswick,
 Ancestor to Mrs. 
Mary Beswick,
 who dying without Issue, hath settled it by Testament for life on Mr. ...... 
Haughton.


Groveherst
 with its relative Appendages, 
Capell, Augustpits, Hoath,
 and 
Sneade,
 were lately passed away by Mr. 
Whetenhall
 of great 
Peckham
 to Mr. 
Francis Austin,
 whose Ancestor 
William Whetenhall
 Esquire, had them annexed to his Demeasne by match∣ing with 
Margaret
 Sole Heir of 
William Hextall,
 who about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, had purchased the four last places of 
Capell, Cheseman, Hoath,
 and 
Sneade,
 Families who had been entituled to the propriety of them many Descents before: But 
Groveherst
 was linked to the Demeasne of 
Kichard Hextall,
 Father of 
William
 above mentioned, by matching about the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, with 
Anne
 one of the three Co-heirs of 
Richard Groveherst,
 whose Ancestors had been possest of it many hundred years before.


Lewis Hoath
 was in Times of elder Track, the Demeasne of 
John de Groveherst,
 who lies buried in 
Horsmenden
 Church, and was a Priest in Orders, and dying so, be∣queathed this Mannor by Testament to the Abby of 
Begham,
 upon whose suppression, by the importunate Desire of Cardinal 
Wolsey,
 it being found incorporated with the Demeasne of the above said Monastery, it became parcel of the Revenue of the

Crown, and remained there, until Queen 
Elizabeth
 by Royal Concession passed it away to 
Anthony Brown
 Viscount 
Montague:
 but by a sudden Revolution, it was by Sale transmitted to 
Beswick,
 whose Heir Generall Mrs. 
Mary Beswick,
 hath late∣ly by Will, settled it on Mr. ....... 
Haughton.


Sprivers
 is likewise under the Repute of a Mannor; and had in elder Times, Owners of that Sirname: for I find that 
Rob. Spriver,
 dyed possest of it, in the year 1447, and by his Will, gives it to his Son 
Robert Spriver:
 and certainly from this Seat, the 
Sprivers
 which are scattered into some places of 
Kent,
 though now un∣der the Eclipse of an obscure Character, branched out originally. In Times of a more modern Aspect, the 
Vanes
 were the Proprietaries of it; and when this Name began to fade away, the 
Bathursts
 were the next successive Possessors, in whom the Title was not many years settled, but that by the same transitory De∣volution, it was put over to 
Malbert,
 from whom by as quick and as sudden a Mutation, it was incorporated into the Interest of 
Murgan.


Spelmonden
 celebrates the Memory of a Family which bore that Sirname;

 for in the Deeds and Evidences which concern this Seat, there is a frequent recital of 
John de Spelmonden,
 who was Possessor of this Place. After this Family had deser∣ted the Inheritance of it, the noble and eminent Family of 
Poynings,
 was planted by Purchase, in the possession of it. 
Michael Poynings
 enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third. 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 14. 
parte secunda,
 and from him, did the Title glide along in the Interest of this Name, untill it came down to Sir 
Edw. Poynings;
 and he, in the fourteenth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, alienated his Concernment in it to 
John Sampson,
 and he had Issue 
Christopher Samp∣son:
 who in the thirty seventh year of 
Henry
 the eighth, passed it away to 
Ste∣phen Darrell;
 and his Son 
George Darrell,
 in the tenth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 sold it to 
Richard Payne
 of 
Twyford
 in 
Middlesex;
 and he in the twenty eighth year of the above-said Princesse, translated his Right in it by Sale into 
William Nutbrown;
 and he in the twenty ninth year of the same Queens Reign, conveyed it to 
George Cure
 of 
Surrey
 Esquire: from whom, immediately after, it went a∣way by Sale to 
Arthur Langworth;
 and from him by as quick a Vicissitude to 
William Beswick
 Esquire, Son to ....... 
Beswick,
 Lord Maior of 
London,
 in the year of our Lord ........ and his Grandchild Mrs 
Mary Beswick,
 dying not long since without Issue, shee, by Testament, gave it in Lease to Mr. ...... 
Haughton,
 now of 
Chelsey
 in 
Middlesex,
 originally extracted from the ancient Family of 
Haugh∣ton,
 of 
Haughton
 Tower in the County of 
Lancaster.


Horton
 in the Hundred of 
Stowting,
 was a Mannor which belonged to that Pri∣ory, which was founded here by 
Robert de Vere,
 Earl of 
Oxford,
 Lord great Cham∣berlain of 
England,
 and dedicated to the Honour of St. 
John
 Baptist, it being a Cell to the Priory of 
Lewes,
 and stored with black Monks of the 
Cluniac
 Order. 
Adelina
 Daughter of 
Hugh de Montfort,
 was a principall Benefactresse to this House, and so were the 
Honywoods
 of 
Henewood
 in 
Saltwood
 not far distant. The first remembred in the Register, is 
Edmund de Honywood,
 who flourisht in the Raign of 
Henry
 the third. Upon the Generall surrender of the Estate of Abbyes, into the Hands of 
Henry
 the eighth, this by that Prince, in the twenty ninth year of his Reign, was granted to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cromwell
 Earl of 
Essex;
 but he being infortunately attainted in the thirty first year of the abovesaid Prince; this Mannor returned to the Crown, and was resident there, untill King 
Charles
 passed it away by Grant, in the fourth year of his Raign to the City of 
London,
 and they 1630, conveyed it to 
George Rook
 Esquire, Father to Mr. 
Lawrence Rook,
 who enjoys the instant Signory of it: but the Abby-house was by 
Henry
 the eighth, upon the fatall Execution, of the above-mentioned Lord, granted to 
John Tate
 of the County of 
North-hampton
 Esquire; and he in the sixth year of 
Edward
 the sixth, sold it to 
Walter Mantle
 Esq; who being infortunately involved in the Design of the noble but unhappy Sir 
Thomas Wiatt,
 in the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 forfeited this to the Crown, where, after it had for some interval of Time been lodged, it was in the thirteenth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 restored to the above-said 
Walter Mantle,
 and from him, did it come down to his Successor Mr. 
Walter Mantle,
 who was the present Possessor of it 1657.




Sherford, aliàs East-Horton,
 is another Mannor in this Parish; it was a Branch of that Demeasne, which fell under the Jurisdiction of 
Retling.
 Sir 
Richard de Retling
 was found in the enjoyment of it at his death, which was in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 12. and left it to 
Joane
 his Sole Daugh∣ter and Heir, who brought it, by espousing 
John Spicer,
 to be parcel of his Inheri∣tance: and he died invested in the Possession of it, in the tenth year of 
Richard
 the second, and from him it devolved to his second Son 
John Spicer,
 who assigned it as Dower to his Wife 
Joane,
 and she was found to hold it in Possession at her Death, which was in the fifth year of 
Henry
 the fifth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 9. and in this Family did it reside, until that Age which bordered upon our Fathers Remembrance; and then it was passed away by 
Spicer
 to 
Morris,
 in which Family the Propriety is still Resident.


Horton
 in the Hundred of 
Acstane,
 was held by 
An. Retellus Rubitoniensis
 or 
Rosse,
 in the twentieth year of 
William
 the Conqueror, as Doomesday Book instructs me. 
Alexander Rosse,
 another of this Family, and Lord of this Mannor, was one of the 
Recognitores Magnae Assisae,
 an Office of Eminence, and no lesse Concernment. In the first yeare of the Raign of King 
John, William de Rosse
 held a Knights Fee in 
Horton
 and 
Lullingston,
 and left it to his Sole Inheritrix, 
Lora de Rosse,
 who about the latter end of 
Edward
 the first, brought it to be the Possession of her Husband ...... 
Kirkbie,
 who by this Match, being entituled to this place removed out of 
Lancashire,
 where was his antient Mansion at 
Kirkbie Hall,
 and seated himself at 
Horton,
 where he re-edified the Castle, which as 
Darell
 relates, in his Tract 
de Castellis Cantii,
 did acknowledge the 
Rosses
 for its Founders, and built the Mannor House, upon which he engrafted his own Name, from whence it hath ever since acquired the Attribute of 
Horton-Kirkbie.
 But it was not long united to this Name; for about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth, this Family was extinguished in a Female Inheritrix, who was matched to 
Thomas Stoner
 of 
Stoner
 in 
Oxfordshire,
 Fa∣ther and Mother of Sir 
Thomas Stoner,
 who was Father to Sir 
William Stoner,
 who by 
Anne
 Daughter and Heir of 
John Nevill
 Marquesse 
Montacute,
 had Issue 
John Stoner,
 who died Issue-lesse, and had forfeited 
Horton
 Castle to 
Henry
 the seventh, by confederating with the Lord 
Audley,
 in his Insurrection against that Prince: and 
Anne
 a Daughter matched to Sir 
Adrian Fortescue,
 by whom he had the Mannor of 
Kirkbie Court,
 and by her only a Female Inheritrix, called 
Margery Fortescue,
 matched to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Wentworth,
 Ancestor to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Wentworth
 of 
Nettlested,
 created Earl of 
Cleveland,
 in the first year of King 
Charles;
 but 
Kirkbie
 was passed away by Sir 
Adrian Fortescue
 to Sir 
James Walsingham,
 in the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, whose Grandchild, Sir 
Thomas Walsingham,
 about the latter end of Queen 
Eliza∣beth,
 alienated it to Alderman 
Hacket
 of 
London,
 in whose Posterity the Propriety of it resides at this Day; but 
Horton
 Castle continued in the Crown, until King 
Henry
 the eighth granted it to 
Robert Rudston
 Esquire; by the Heir General of which Family it is at this instant become the Inheritance of Mr. ...... 
Michell
 of 
Richmond.


Franks
 is an eminent Seat in this Parish, which was the Mansion of Gentlemen of that Sirname, who about the latter end of 
Henry
 the third, came out of 
Yorke∣shire,
 and planted themselves at this place, and writ their Sirnames in very old Deeds, and other old Evidences 
Frankish,
 and bore for their Coat-Armour, as appears by Seals A Salteir engrailed ........ After 
Franke, John Martin,
 about the Beginning of of 
Henry
 the sixth by purchase, became invested in the Possession, and he upon his Decease, which was in the year 1436. bequeathed it to a yonger Son, who bore his Name, and was called 
John Martin,
 from whom, by paternal Succession, it came down to his Grand-child 
Edward Martin,
 who about the Beginning of Queen 
Eli∣zabeth,
 alienated it to 
Lancelot Bathurst,
 Alderman of 
London;
 who erected that elegant and magnificent Fabrick, which is now the possession of my noble Friend, his Grand-child, Sir 
Edward Bathurst.


Reynolds
 is a third place of considerable importance; it was the Seat of Gentle∣men of that Denomination, and were rooted by a Prescription of so many years in the Possession of this Place, that it is a Controversie, whether those at 
Belso
 in 
Essex,
 or these here, were of the most venerable Antiquity; one of them in one

of his Deeds writes, 
Rogerus Filius Reginaldi.
 It is not bounded with any Date, and from this Orthography which was Customary in those Times, the Name of 
Rey∣nolds,
 or 
Fitz Reynolds,
 did by vulgar Acceptation and Use, first borrow its Original, But to advance in my Discourse. After this Seat had for sundry Descents been con∣stant to this Name and Family; it was, about the latter end of 
Edward
 the fourth, transmitted by Sale to Sir 
John Browne,
 Lord Mayor of 
London,
 in the year 1480. from whom it came down by paternal Descent to his Son and Heir, 
William Brown
 Esquire, who assigned it for subsistance to his second Son, 
John Browne
 Esquire, who was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 the tenth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and held his Shrieval∣ty at this place; and in this Name did the Title dwell, until not many years since it was dislodged, and by Sale transplanted into Sir 
John Jacob;
 from whom the like Fatality hath lately transported it, and cast it into the Inheritance of Sir 
Harbottle Grimston
 of 
Essex,
 Baronet.


Horton
 upon 
Stoure,
 near 
Canterbury,
 lies in the Hundred of 
Bridge
 and 
Petham,
 and was involved in that spacious Inheritance, which acknowledged the Signiory of the Lord 
Badelesmere. Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmere,
 Steward of the Houshold to 
Edward
 the second, in the second year of that Prince, gave it in Franke-marriage with his Daughter 
Joane Badelesmere
 to 
John de Northwood;
 and that this was Custo∣mary in that Age, wherein the Times were dry for any pecuniary Supply, is most certain; for 
John de Northwood,
 this mans great Grand-child, in the eighth year of 
Richard
 the second, gave it in Franke-marriage with his Daughter to 
Christopher Shukborough
 of the County of 
Warwick
 Esquire, and he in the ninth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, alienated it to 
Gregory Ballard
 Esquire, whose Posterity for many years did successively possesse it, until 
Nicolas Ballard,
 in the fourth year of 
Philip
 and 
Mary,
 passed it away by Sale to 
Roger Trollop
 Esquire; and he in the second year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 by Bargain and Sale demised his Interest in it to Sir 
Edward Warner,
 then Lievtenant of the Tower, and he in the sixteenth year of the Govern∣ment of that Princess, conveyed it to Sir 
Roger Manwood,
 Lord chief Baron of the Exchequer, whose Son Sir 
Peter Manwood,
 almost in our Fathers Memory, disposed of his Right in it by Sale to Mr. 
Christopher Tolderbye,
 who left it to his Son Mr. 
Christopher Tolderbye,
 and, he deceasing without Issue, 
Jane
 his only Sister and Heir, by matching with Sir 
Robert Darell
 of 
Cale-hill
 (a man eminent both by his Integrity and Hospitality, according to the accustomed Genius, which alwaies waited on this Family) brought it to be possest by that Name; upon whose Decease it devolved to his second Son Mr. 
Edward Darell,
 who is the present Lord of the Fee.


There was an eager Contest between 
John Beckford
 Vicar of 
Chartham,
 and 
Christopher Shukborough
 Esquire, Lord of 
Horton,
 touching the celebration of Divine Offices in the Chappel at 
Horton;
 as likewise the Administration of the Sacraments: and it was improved to that Animosity, that there was a mutual Ap∣peal made to 
William Courtney,
 then Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 who directed a Commission to 
John Barnett
 his Official, in the year 1380. to hear and determine the Controversie, and upon a serious sifting and winnowing this whole Affair, the Debate was wound up upon this Conclusion, that there should be a solemnization of all Divine Offices in the above mentioned Chappel, 
exceptis tantum D. functorum Sepulturis & exsequiis,
 only the Dead were to receive their enterment in the 
Church
 of 
Chartham.


Hothfeild
 in the Hundreds of 
Chart, Longbridge,
 and 
Cale-hill,
 was wrapt up in the Demeasne of the Lord 
Badelesmer,
 who held it in Grand Serjeanty of the Arch∣bishop of 
Canterbury;
 that is, he was to serve up water to the Arch-bishop at his Installment or Inthronization to wash his Hands, and had 
Pelvim & Lotorium;
 so are the Words of the Record: he was rewarded with the Vessel which contained the Water, and likewise the Towel which dried his Hands, and he was likewise to be his Chamberlin the Night of his Instalment, and was recompensed with the Arch-bishops Bed, as his Guerdon. 
Bartholomew de Badelesmere
 Son of 
Guncelin,
 died possest of it, in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 5. And left it to his infortunate Heir 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmere,
 who by his mutinous

Association with the Rebellious Nobility, having in the sixteenth year of 
Edward
 the second, forfeited this to the Crown; it lay entwined with the Royal Revenue, until 
Edward
 the third, in the second year of his Raign, restored it to his Son 
Bartholomew de Badelesmere,
 who in the twelfth year of that Prince's Government, dying without Issue, his four Sisters became his Co-heirs, whereof 
Margaret
 mar∣ried to the Lord 
William Rosse
 of 
Hamlake,
 cast this Mannor into the Inheritance of that Family, and he in her Right died seised of it, in the seventeenth year of 
Ed∣ward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 60. And from him, did the Title by a lineal trans∣mission, passe down to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Rosse,
 who vigorously endevouring to sup∣port the sinking Title of the House of 
Lancaster,
 was by 
John Nevill
 Marquesse 
Montacute,
 discomfited in the North, and taken Prisoner, and after beheaded at 
Newcastle,
 upon whose Dysastrous Tragedy, this Mannor was laid hold on by the Crown, as an Escheat: and King 
Edward
 the fourth, in the fourth year of his Go∣vernment, granted it to Sir 
John Fogge
 of 
Repton
 for Life only, who was Trea∣surer of his Houshold, and one of his Privie-Councel; and whom King 
Richard
 the third, invited afterward out of the Abbey of 
West-minster,
 where he had taken Sanctuary for fear of some Mischief, intended him by that Usurper; and in the pre∣sence of a numerous Assembly, gave him his Hand, and bad him be confident, that he was thenceforth sure unto him in Affection. This I mention, the rather, because divers of our Chronicles, have erroneously mentioned, that he was an Attorney, whom this Prince pardoned for Forgery. But to proceed: After the Decease of Sir 
John Fogge,
 who dyed in the seventeenth year of 
Henry
 the seventh, it returned to the Crown, and lay there untill 
Henry
 the eighth, granted it to 
John Tufton
 Esquire, Ancestor to the right honorable 
John
 Earl of 
Thanet,
 who now by paternal Right, claims the Possession of it.


Swinfort
 is a Mannor in 
Hothfield,
 which afforded a Sirname to a Family so called: but whether Sir 
Otho Swinfort,
 Husband to 
Katharine Swinfort,
 who was af∣terwards Concubine to 
John
 of 
Gaunt,
 was extracted from this Family or not, is in∣certain; because I cannot discover they were ever of any Eminence. In 
Henry
 the fifths Reign, I find it in the Possession of 
Bridges,
 descended from 
John at Bregg,
 one of those eminent persons, that are depicted kneeling in Coat Armour, in a Window in 
Great Chart Church.
 And there is a place in that Parish, which still bears the Name of this Family, and is called 
Bridge,
 being divorced by no great distance from this Mannor: and in this Family did the Pro∣priety of this place continue, untill the latter end of King 
James;
 and then it passed away by Sale from 
Bridges,
 to Sir 
Nicholas Tufton
 Father to the right ho∣nourable 
John
 Earl of 
Thanet,
 the instant Owner of it.


Faulesley,
 vulgarly now called 
Fausley
 and 
Fousley,
 was the Patrimony of a Fami∣ly, which borrowed not only its Source and Extraction, but its Denomination likewise from hence. Sir 
John Faulesley,
 was an eminent person, in the Raign of 
Richard
 the second, being frequently in his Time, as appears by the late printed Abridgement of the Records in the Tower, summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron: but although this Family was made eminent by this worthy person, who was an elder Branch of this Stem; yet in succeeding Generations it began to crum∣ble away, into Obscurity and Decay: and was at last ground to so narrow a pro∣portion of Estate, that about the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 this Mannor, which had so long been espoused to the Interest of this Name and Family, was carried off by Sale to 
Drury;
 in which Family it was resident, untill the latter end of that Princesse, and then it was alienated to 
Paris;
 who immediately af∣ter conveyed it to 
Bull;
 and he transplanted his Right by Sale again into the same Family; from whom, a like Vicissitude brought it to be the Inheritance of Sir 
Nicholas Tufton,
 Father to the right honorable 
John
 Earl of 
Thanet
 now Possessor of it.


At Hothfield,
 in a field not far removed from 
Ripley,
 a Mannor belonging to 
Alexander Iden
 Esquire, was 
Jack Cade
 that Counterfeit 
Mortimer
 (who was mufled up, in that Name, by the House of 
York,
 only to fathom the depth of the peo∣ple's Affection to their Title, which was to take its Rise from that person) en∣countered, and in a single Combat, offered up to the Justice of 
Henry
 the sixth, by

the abovesaid 
Alexander Iden,
 who was not only by that Prince, recompensed with a considerable Reward, for so important a piece of Service, but likewise in∣vested with the Honour of Knighthood, the present Age wherein he lived, admi∣red him; nor shall there be any History for the future, which shall not Record him. From the Heir Generall of this Family, is Mr. 
George Brown
 Esquire, late∣ly of 
Spelmonden
 in 
Kent,
 and now of 
Buckland
 in 
Surrey,
 by his Grand-mother originally descended.


Hougham
 in the Hundreds of 
Bew borough
 and 
Folkstone
 gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of as reverend an Estimate for Antiquity, as any in this Track. 
Robert de Hougham,
 dyed seised of it, in the forty first year of 
Henry
 the third, and left it to his Son

 
Robert de Hougham,
 who was Castellan of 
Rochester Castle,
 in the Reign of 
Edward
 the first, and dyed seised in the possession of this, and the Custody of that, in the second year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 14. But in the next Descent, this Family was entombed in two Daughters and Coheirs, one was mar∣ried to 
John de Shelving,
 and the other to 
Waretius de Valoigns,
 who in her Right entered upon the Inheritance, and in the fourteenth year of 
Edward
 the third, obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of 
Hougham,
 but enjoyed nei∣ther his new acquired Priviledge or Inheritance long; for before the lat∣ter end of 
Edward
 the third, he dyed, and left a large Inheritance to be shared by his two Daughters and Coheirs, one whereof was wedded to Sir 
Thomas Fogge
 of 
Toniford,
 and the other to 
Thomas de Aldon,
 to whose Revenue upon the Partition, this was annexed, and he was found in the enjoyment of it at his Death, which was in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 10. 
Parte prima.
 But here the Possession likewise, before the end of 
Henry
 the fourth, was as volatile, and full of Vicissitude; for by the Female Inheritrix of this Family, it came to be the Demeasne of 
Heron:
 who, after he had some years owned the propriety of it, alienated the Fee-simple to 
Phineux,
 in which Name and Stem, when it had for many Descents, in a constant procedure, flourished; and had been productive of persons, of the highest Office and Trust, as they could be invested with, in Relation to the Service of this County, it was not many years since, passed away from this Family, and sold to Master 
Neview
 of 
Dover.


Little Hougham,
 is a second Mannor in this Parish: It was, in Ages of a very high Ascent, the Revenue of the ancient Family of 
Basing. William de Basing,
 held it at his Death, which was in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 21. From whom it desceuded to his Grandchild 
John Basing,
 who dyed in the Tenure of it, in the seventh year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 6. Af∣ter whose Decease, it continued in the Name, untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was alienated to 
Clive,
 vulgarly called 
Cliffe,
 a Family of eminent Account, in the Counties of 
Salop
 and 
Essex;
 and in the Possession of this Family it dwelt, untill the latter end of that Prince, and then by Purchase, it was made the Patrimony of 
Hextall,
 a Eamily who extracted their original, out of 
Staffordshire;
 and here it resided, untill the latter end of 
Edward
 the fourth, and then it was transmitted by a Daughter and Heir to 
Whetenhall;
 who sold it to 
John Bois
 Esquire, Ancestor to 
Jo. Bois
 of 
Fredville
 Esquire, who is entituled to the present Signiory of it.


Maxton
 is a third place, which must not be waved in this Discourse: It was in elder Times divided between two Families called 
Madekin,
 and 
Walsham. Ste∣phen de Madekin,
 was not only Lord of 
Madekin
 in 
Denton,
 and the Moiety of this place, in the year one thousand seventy and seven, but likewise Land at 
Canterbu∣ry,
 as appears by Mr. 
Sompner,
 in his Survey of that City, page 415. And 
Will. de Walsham,
 who in the thirty seventh year, was possest of the other Moiety of this place gave, about that year by Charter, some land to the Incumbent or Parson of St. 
Nicholas
 of 
Harbledown.
 After these two Families had deserted the Inheritance, I find the 
Archers,
 about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the third, to be entituled by Pur∣chase to it, and 
William le Archer
 (so he is written in the Book of 
Aid
) paid an Auxiliary Supply for this Mannor, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at

making the Black Prince Knight; but his Son 
VVilliam Archer,
 in the twenty first year of 
Richard
 the second, passes away his Right by Sale to 
John Alkham
 of 
Alk∣ham,
 a Family that had taken deep Root in Antiquity downwards, and had a spreading Revenue upwards in this Track; but, before the end of 
Henry
 the seventh, were consumed and crumbled away, and then the next Family which succeeded in the Possession was 
Herman,
 who was likewise owner of 
Mary-place
 in 
Crayford,
 and in this Name did the Interest of it fix, until the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth
 and then it was alienated to 
Andrews,
 who some few years after demised the Fee-simple to 
Pepper,
 and he almost in the Verge of our Remembrance sold it to Sir 
Thomas VVilford
 of 
Ilden,
 and he in our Memory alienated it to 
Richards
 of 
Dover.


Although the greatest part of this Mannor was of secular Concernment, yet I find that the Prior of St. 
Martins
 in 
Dover
 had some Interest in it, as appears by an Inquisition taken after the Death of 
John Atte-hall,
 where it is proved in the six∣teenth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Numb.
 129. 
Parte secunda,
 that he held Lands at his Death at 
Maxton
 of that Covent.


Siberston
 is the last place of Account in 
Hougham;
 it gave Name in elder Times to a Family so styled; for in an old Deed without Date, in the Hands of Mr. 
Whit∣tingham-Wood
 of 
Canterbury,
 lately deceased, I find 
Richard de Siberston
 demises it to 
John Monins,
 and in another Deed I discover that 
John Monins
 Son of 
John Mo∣nins,
 passes the third Part of his Mannor of 
Siberston
 to 
John Monins
 the elder, in the thirty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third. And this I think is Authority suffici∣ent to evidence to the Publique, that it was a parcel of that Estate that owned the Interest and Signory of that eminent Family, in which it lay couched until the lat∣ter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was by Sale transplanted into 
Pepper,
 whose Successor in our Fathers Remembrance conveyed it to 
Moulton
 of 
Retherhed,
 vulgar∣ly called 
Redriff
 in 
Surrey,
 in whose Descendants the Inheritance of it does still continue.


Hunton
 in the Hundred of 
Twiford,
 celebrates the Memory of an ancient Family, called 
Lenham,
 who were once Proprietaries of it. 
Nicolas de Lenham
 obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannour of 
Hunton,
 in the forty first year of 
Henry
 the third; but about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the third, the Interest of it was departed from this Family, for 
William de Lenham
 determined in 
Eleanor de Lenham,
 his sole Inheritrix, and she by matching with 
John Gifford,
 wrapt up this and 
Ben∣sted,
 another little Mannor in this Parish, which likewise was parcel of 
Lenhams
 Estate, in the Demeasne of that Family; and he and his Wife paid Releif for 
Hunton
 and 
Bensted,
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at making the Black Prince Knight. But after this, it was not long permanent in this Family; for about the Beginning of 
Richard
 the second, it was passed away with 
Bensted
 to 
John
 Lord 
Clinton,
 who in the twenty eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, was found Heir to his Cozen 
William Clinton,
 Earl of 
Huntington;
 for that Land which he held 
Jure proprio & nativo,
 not 
Jure uxoris Julianae de Leybourne
 in this County. And the Effi∣gies of this 
John,
 and of his Grand child ...... Lord 
Clinton
 (who paid Relief, in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, for his Mannor of 
Hunton,
 at the Marriage of 
Blanch
 that Prince's Daughter) have escaped the furious Barbarity of these Times, and stand yet undemolished in the Church-Windows: and from this last did it descend to 
John
 Lord 
Clinton
 his Successor, who about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh alienated the Fee-simple to Sir 
Henry Wiatt,
 one of the Privy Councel to the said Monarch, and his Son Sir 
Thomas Wiatt
 the elder died seised of it, in the thirty fourth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and transmitted it with 
Bensted,
 which his Grand-father likewise bought of the Lord 
Clinton,
 to his infortunate Son Sir 
Thomas Wiatt,
 who adhering too strictly to an unhappy Clause in the Testament of 
Henry
 the eighth, which obliges his Councel not to suffer his Daughters to espouse any Forrainer, involved him in that dysastrous Design, which could not be expiated, but by the Forfeiture of his Life and Estate, in which this Mannor of 
Hunton
 being concerned; it was in the second year of Queen 
Mary
 granted to her Atturney General, Sir 
John Baker
 of 
Sisinghurst,
 from whom the Title in the Stream of Succession, lately glided down to his Heir General Sir 
John Baker
 Baronet, Son

and Heir to Sir 
John Baker
 Baronet, not many years since deceased.


Burston
 is another Mannor in 
Hunton,
 which is eminent for being the Seat of 
John de Burston,
 which the Dateless Deeds that relate to this Family, from the pro∣bable Conjecture of the Hand-writing, which is calculated for the Raign of 
Henry
 the third, record to have lived in that Prince's Time, and there was Land like∣wise about 
Wye
 and 
Crundall,
 that acknowledged the Jurisdiction of this Family; for in the forty fifth year of 
Henry
 the third, 
Waretius de Valoigns
 Knight, makes a Release of his Title to some Lands in those Parishes to 
John de Burston,
 and in this Family did this Seat remain for many Descents, and was productive of men of no despicable Account in this Track: amongst whom 
William Burston
 was returned, in the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, by 
Gervas Clifton
 then Sheriff, 
inter illos qui portabant Arma Antiqua.
 In the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, Alderman 
Head
 of 
London
 was resident here, and added much both of Building and Magnifi∣cence to this Fabrick; but certainly it was only as Lessee; for I cannot find that he was ever Proprietary of it, for about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 it was sold by 
Burston
 to Sir 
Thomas Vane,
 who upon his Decease gave it to his second Son ...... 
Vane,
 from whom it descended to his Heir Sir 
George Vane,
 whose Widdow Dowager the Lady ...... 
Vane
 is now in Possession of it.


Hunton
 had the Grant of a Market procured to it by 
Nicolas de Lenham,
 on the Tuesday, and a yearly Fair to continue five Dayes, the Vigil, the Day of the Assumption of our Lady, and three Dayes after, 
Pat.

Hucking
 in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne,
 is involved in the Mannor of 
Hollingbourne,
 and was enstated on the Prior and Convent of 
Christ-church,
 when that by a muni∣ficent Donation, augmented the Revenue of that Priory.


Yet there is an ancient Seat in this Parish, called 
Rumpsted,
 which never was couched in the Spiritual Patrimony; for it had anciently Owners of that Appella∣tion. Sir 
William de Rumpsted
 held this, and a Castellated Mansion in 
Sevenoke,
 of that Denomination, in the Raign of 
Edward
 the first, and he had Issue Sir 
John Rumpsted,
 possest of this place and 
Rumpsted
 in 
Sevenoke,
 and, as the Tradition asserts, educated Sir 
William Sevenoke,
 Lord Mayor of 
London,
 in the year of Grace 1418. In Ages of a nearer Descent to us, that is, in the third year of 
Henry
 the sixth, I find 
Richard Peverell
 to have enjoyed it. And in Times subsequent to these, the 
Peckhams;
 but their Possession was very frail, for in the Raign of Queen 
Eliza∣beth,
 I find it to be in 
Figge,
 a Name of no despicable Character in this Parish; but it was very transitory here likewise; for about the Beginning of King 
James,
 the Title was interwoven with the Interest of 
Thompson,
 who in our Fathers Re∣membrance, conveyed it by Sale to Mr. ...... 
Taylor,
 Fruiterer to the above∣said Prince; and his Discendant, not many years since alienated it to Mr. 
Stringer
 of 
Goudherst.

ICkham
 in the Hundred of 
Downehamford,
 was given by King 
Offa
 to 
Christ-church,
 and to the Monks of that Covent, in the year 781. under the Notion of fifteen Plough-lands, and was for a Supplement of Dyet. This Donation in the year 958. was confirmed by 
Athelward, Odo
 the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 being then present, and attesting the Ratification: In the Time of 
Edward
 the Confessor, when the first Design of Doomesday Book was started; it was rated at four Sullings or Plough-lands: nor did it fall in that Account, when that generall Register was perfected, which was in the twentieth year of the Conqueror, defending it self at the same Estimate, and upon the Appraisment was valued at thirty pound. And here it was fastned until King 
Henry
 the eighth finding the Revenue of the Church was diffused into too wide a Latitude and Circumference, contracted it by a general

Dissolution into a narrower Orbe, and having rent off this Mannor from the Eccle∣siastical Demeasne, like an Excrescence sprouting out from a luxuriant Stem, he ingrafted it again by his Letters Patent, on the Dean and Chapter of 
Christ-church,
 and they settled it by Lease on 
Edward Isaack
 a Noble Confessor for the Protestant Religion, in the Raign of Queen 
Mary,
 when so many were sent to Heaven, like so many 
Elias's Flammeis vecti Quadrigis
 in Chariots of fire, who rather chose to desert his Country, then abandon his Religion, and to lose his Estate rather then to debauch or relinquish his Conscience, as his Epitaph on an old Tablet affixed to a Pillar contiguous to his Grave-stone in the Nave of 
Christ-church
 at 
Canterbury
 does instruct us. Upon his Recesse, this was seized upon by the Crown, and Queen 
Mary
 by Grant united it to the Revenue of 
George
 Lord 
Cobham,
 whose infortu∣nate Grand-child 
Henry Brooke,
 being attainted, in the Raign of King 
James,
 that Monarch restored his Estate, forfeited here, to 
Robert Cecill
 Earl of 
Salisbury,
 his Brother in Law, whose Son 
Robert,
 now Earl of 
Salisbury,
 holds the instant Possession of it, but hath lately alienated some part of it to Mr. 
Roger Lukin
 of 
London.


Apulton
 is a second Mannor in 
Ickham,
 written in old Deeds 
Apylton,
 as being the Inheritance of a Family of that Name; for in an old Deed of 
Reginald de Corne∣hill,
 that was owner of 
Lukedale
 in 
Littlebourne,
 not far distant, one 
William de Apylton
 of 
Ickham
 is a Witness; but whether this Family was knit by any Relation to the Noble Family of the 
Apyltons
 of 
Essex
 and 
Suffolk,
 I am incertain. Afterwards, the 
Denis's
 were possest of it, and one 
John Denis
 of 
Apulton
 in 
Ickham,
 who was Sheriff of 
London,
 in the year of Grace 1360. Founded here a Chauntry, in the Raign of 
Edward
 the third, as appears by an old Manuscript, in the Hands of Mr. 
Thomas Denne,
 lately deceased, and was called 
Denis
 Chauntry, and the Lands which relate to it, are at this Day styled 
Denis
 Lands: After this Family was worn out, I find one 
Adam Oldmeade,
 by the private Deeds, to be in the Raign of 
Henry
 the fifth and 
Henry
 the sixth, owner of it; from whom before the latter end of that Prince, it came over by Sale to 
Bemboe,
 and from him to 
Hunt,
 in which Family it made no long stay. For about the latter of 
Henry
 the seventh, I find it alienated to 
Dormer,
 a Branch of the 
Dormers
 of 
Buckinghamshire,
 and from this Name not many years after it went away to 
Gason,
 a Name very ancient in this Parish, and here like∣wise was the Possession of as brief a Date; for 
Dormer
 by Sale passed it away to 
Hodgekin
 (whose Ancestors were formerly possest of 
Uffington
 in 
Gonston,
 and trans∣mitted it by Sale to 
Ashenden
) and here likewise was the Title very variable, for within the Circle of fourscore years it acknowledged not only this Family; but 
Rutland, Winter,
 and 
Dee,
 to have been its Successive Proprietaries: from the last of which, not many years since, it was by Sale carried off to 
Frostall,
 in which name it is still resident.


The Mannor of 
Baa
 in this Parish, had anciently Possessors of that Sirname, as appears by an old Fragment of Glass in the Church Windows, whereon is super∣scribed this incoherent Inscription. 
Hic ...... Ba .....
 and at the Pedestal of another antiquated Portraiture 
Thomas de Baa.
 After the 
Baas,
 the 
Wendertons
 of 
Wenderton
 in 
Wingham,
 were possest of it for several Generations, until 
William Wenderton,
 about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, passed it away by Sale to 
Hugh Warham
 Esquire, Brother to the Arch-bishop, and he gave it in Dower with 
Anne
 his Daughter, matched to Sir 
Anthony St. Leger,
 Lord President of 
Ireland,
 whose Descendant Sir 
Warham St. Leger,
 passed it away to Mr. ...... 
Denue
 of 
Denne Hill
 in 
Kingston,
 whose Heir Mr. 
Thomas Denne,
 late Recorder of 
Canterbury,
 al∣most in our Memory alienated it to 
Curling.


Before I leave 
Ickham,
 I must inform the Reader that 
Peter de Ickham,
 was born in this Parish; a man whom both 
Ball
 in his Centuries, and 
Pitseus
 in his Track, 
de Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis,
 do highly magnifie for a man of eminent Literature: whither I refer my Reader.


Ivie-church
 in the Hundred of 
St. Martins
 and 
Aloesbridge,
 contains sundry Places within its Confines, not to be entombed in silence. The first is 
Capells-Court,
 the Seat of a Family of that Sirname, and were written frequently 
At Capell,
 and in

Latin 
de Capella,
 and were a Family certainly of signall Account in 
Kent,
 as ap∣pears by their Land, which lay scattered in 
Linton
 and 
Boxley,
 where 
John de Ca∣pell
 held Land called 
Tattellmell
 in that Parish, in the thirty seventh year of 
H.
 the third, as appears by a Charter of Inspection, of that Prince, wherein he confirms Land to the Abby of 
Boxley,
 which bordered on the Land of 
John de Capell
 at 
Tattellmell. Richard de Capell
 this Man's Successor, dyed possest of 
Capell Court
 in 
Werehorn,
 and this here, in the fifteenth year of 
Richard
 the second. But after this Man's decease, it did not long remain annexed to the Name: for this Family expiring in a Female Heir, shee by matching with 
Harlackenden,
 of the Borough of 
Harlackenden
 in 
Woodchurch,
 united it to the Patrimony of this Fa∣mily, and here it rested untill the Beginning of King 
James,
 and then 
Deborah,
 Sole Daughter and Heir of 
Walter Harlackenden,
 a Branch of the abovesaid Stem by espousing Sir 
Edward Hales,
 late of 
Tunstall
 deceased, entwined it with his Demeasne: upon whose Death, it devolved to his Grandchild Sir 
Edward Hales,
 now of 
Tunstall
 Baronet.


Cheyneys Court
 is a second place of Account in this Parish, and had this Name imposed upon it, because it lay folded up in the Revenue of that Name, of that Family, 
Alexander de Cheyney,
 who flourished in the Raign of 
Henry
 the third, and 
Edward
 the first, in the ninth of which Prince's raign he was one of that Catalogue, as appears by 
Kirkbie
's Inquest kept in the Exchequer, who was em∣barked in that successefull War, which was commenced by that Monarch against the 
Welsh,
 and dyed possest of this Mannor, in the twenty fourth year of his Government. After whose Decease, it was constantly resident in this Family, untill 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney.
 Son of Sir 
Thomas Cheyney,
 about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 passed it away by Sale to Mr. 
Richard Knatchbull,
 whose Heir Generall, Sir 
Norton Knatchbull,
 Knight and Baronet, extracted originally, from th
 
Knatchbulls
 of 
Limne,
 where I find the Name by Deeds, very ancient, is now in the Possession of the Demeasne, but the Mannor was conveyed by Sale to Sir 
Walter Roberts.


More Court
 is a third place in 
Ivie Church,
 which must not find its en∣terrement in Silence because it was the ancient Seat of the 
Moores,
 now Ba∣rons of 
Mellifont
 in 
Ireland,
 before they were transplanted into 
More-place
 in 
Be∣nenden,
 by matching with the Heir generall of Sir 
William Brenchley,
 Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, under 
Henry
 the sixth, and this is evident by a Fine levyed, between 
John
 the Son of 
Thomas de Iden,
 and 
John de More
 of 
Ivie-church
 (so he is named in the Record) by which, the said 
John
 passes away Land to 
John de More
 of 
Rolvenden,
 in the year of 
Grace
 1280. And in this Family for many Generations was it constant and permanent, untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh; and then the common Vicissitude of Purchase (which like a Moath or Canker, frets into ancient Titles) brought it to be the Possession of 
Taylor,
 and here it was settled untill in the second year of 
Edward
 the sixth, (as by an Ex∣emplification, now in the Hands of 
Thomas Taylor
 Esq; is evident) it was divided between 
William
 and 
John Taylor
 Gentlemen; and they immediately after, by a joint and mutuall Concurrence, alienated their Interest here, to 
Peter Godfrey
 Gentleman, Great Grand-father to Sir 
Thomas Godfrey,
 now of 
Hepington
 in 
Ne∣ther Hardres,
 who is the instant Proprietary of it.


Iwade
 in the Hundred of 
Milton,
 is a small Parish, situated no great distance from the 
Swale,
 which exposes it self to the injurious Impression of many Fogs, and other sullen Vapours, which exhale, from the adjacent Marishes; so that, the Air becomming by these Mists, contagious and unheathfull, we must expect, that it cannot be very populous, nor contain many places in it, considerable in their Account. The only place of Note being 
Colshill-hall,
 a place in its Name, pro∣portionate to its Position, though formerly it had Owners of its own Appella∣tion: for in a Deed of 
William de Codshill,
 who held Land at 
Middleton Bobbing,
 and elsewhere, and which bears Date, from about the fiftieth of 
Henry
 the third, I find one 
John de Colsted
 a Witnesse. But in Times of no great distance, from that Prince's Raign, I find the 
Alefs
 or 
Alephs,
 possest of it, and to this Fa∣mily:

does the ancient Shell or Fabrick of the House, owe the principal part of its Structure; especially that, which by its Antiquity obliges the Eye to so much Regard and Veneration as is evident by the Hall, which in diverse places is diaper'd with an A. and then a Leafe, a Rebus, which treasures up the Relique of the Name, remaining unwritten. And appears to be exceeding ancient, by the Character calculated for the Raign of 
Edward
 the third. From whose Time, un∣till the Beginning of the Raign of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 it continued knit to this Name of 
Alef;
 and then 
Thomas Aleph,
 the last of this Name, being extinguished in a Daughter and Heir called 
Margaret,
 matched to 
John Monins
 Esquire, this by that Alliance, became the Inheritance of that Name, but made no long aboad in their Revenue: for in our Grand-fathers memory, it went away by Sale from 
Monins
 to 
Lewin;
 and 
Lewin,
 not many years since, concluding in a Female In∣heritrix, she by being affianced to 
Rogers,
 branched out from 
Rogers
 of 
Brianson
 in the West, linked it to the Inheritance of that Family, where it had as brief a Residence; for 
Rogers
 not long since, dying without Issue-male, 
Elizabeth
 his only Heir, by her espousalls with 
Charles Cavendish,
 Lord 
Mansfield,
 hath now in∣terwoven it with the Propriety and Income, relating to that eminent and illustri∣ous Family.

KEmsing
 in the Hundred of 
Codsheath,
 is a Parish, which, in Respect of its Cir∣cuit and Dimension, is but despicable; but, in Relation to those Persons who in elder Times were Possessors of it, it is not inferiour in its value to scarce a∣ny Parish in this Hundred. The first that I find to be its Proprietary, was 
Falca∣tius de Brent,
 and he is mentioned in the Red-book kept in the Exchequer, to have held it in the Raign of 
Henry
 the second, and was Castellan likewise of 
Kemsing-Castle,
 a place then of important Concernment, though now it's Skel∣leton it self, be shrunk into such a desolate and neglected Masse of Rubbish, that it would be now as difficult to trace it out or find it, as it was formerly to conquer it. And this Mans Son, was that 
Falcatius de Brent,
 so famous in our Chro∣nicles for those wild Disorders and Sallies arising from those Boilings and Eva∣porations which were cast out by the Calentures of Youth, rather then from a∣ny vitious Habit, contracted from severall Acts of Excesse, and riveted into his Soul. Yet, it seems, these Excursions of his, did so disgust King 
Henry
 the third, that he made the Forfeiture of his Estate here, pay the price of his Vanities. In∣deed, that name, his Misfortunes rather then his Treasons, seem to Challenge. And then that Prince, in the sixth year of his Reign, granted it, with the Man∣nor of 
Sauters
 in 
Sutton at Hone,
 to 
Baldwin de Betun
 Earl of 
Albemarle,
 in Right of his Wife 
Hawis,
 Daughter and Heir of 
William le Grosse
 Earl of 
Albemarle,
 and Lord of 
Holdernesse.
 And this 
Baldwin,
 had, by her, two Daughters and Coheirs, 
Hawis
 the eldest of them, was married to 
William le Marshall
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 to whom her Father gave with her in Marriage, 
Kemsing Sawters,
 and much other Land in this County: but this Mans Successor, 
Anselme le Marshall
 Earl of 
Pem∣broke,
 dying without Issue, 
Robert Bigod
 Earl of 
Norfolk,
 by 
Mawd
 his Mother, the Heir Generall of the Family, as being Sister to 
Gilbert Marshall
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 entered upon the Estate of that Family, here at 
Kemsing:
 and he passed it away to 
Otho
 Lord 
Grandison,
 with the Advowson of the Church of 
Kemsing,
 in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the first. And after this Family was worn out, I find the 
Says
 to Step into the Inheritance, and 
Geffrey de Say,
 held it at his Death, which was in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 24. 
Parte secunda.
 From whom, the Propriety flowed down to his Successor 
Geffrey
 Lord 
Say,
 and he concluded in two Daughters and Coheirs, whereof 
Elizabeth,


one of them was affianced to Sir 
William Fiennes:
 who in her Right was invested in 
Kemsing,
 and from him was the Title by Descent transported over to 
William
 Lord 
Fiennes,
 Son of 
James
 Lord 
Fiennes,
 and he in the second year of 
Edward
 the fourth, passed it away to Sir 
Geffrey Bolein,
 Great Grand-father to 
George
 Viscount 
Rochford,
 who was beheaded and left no Issue, in the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, so that this upon his Father Sir 
Thomas Boleyn,
 Earl of 
Wilts,
 departure with∣out any other Issue-male, in the thirtieth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, devolved to that Prince, who seised upon it in Right of his Wife, the infortunate 
Anne Bullen,
 who was eldest Sister to the unhappy Viscount. And here in the Revenue of the Crown did it lie couched, until Queen 
Elizabeth,
 in the first year of her Raign, passed it away by Grant to her Kinsman 
Henry Cary
 Lord 
Hunsdon,
 Son of 
William Cary,
 Esquire of the Body to 
Henry
 the eighth, and of 
Mary
 his Wife, Sister to Q. 
Anne,
 Mother to the above said Princesse, and his Grandchild 
Henry
 Earl of 
Dover,
 alienated his Right in it to 
Richard
 Earl of 
Dorset,
 and he not many years since, passed it away to Mr. ...... 
Smith,
 vulgarly called 
Dog-Smith,
 who upon his Decease settled the Fee-simple for ever on the Hospital of St. 
Thomas
 in 
South∣warke.


There was an old Knightly Family, which tooke their Sirname from this Parish, and was styled 
Kemsing,
 and their Coat was 
Argent,
 a 
Fesse
 and 
Cheveron,
 interla∣ced 
Sables,
 now quatered by Mr. 
William Hart
 of 
Lullingston
 Esquire, in Right of 
Peche,
 who married the Heir General.


Kenardington
 in the Hundred of 
Blackborn,
 is by Contraction called 
Kenarton:
 and al∣though it cannot much boast of the healthful situation thereof, yet it hath had Lords and Owners of a very great Estimate; 
Will. de Normannia
 held it in the Raign of K. 
John,
 and part of the Raign of 
Henry
 the third, as appears by the Pipe Rolls, which relate to those Times, and concern this County:

 After him his Son 
Thomas de Normannia
 or 
Nor∣manvill;
 for so he is written in the ancient Rolls succeeded in the Possession of it, but died in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the first, without Issue-male; so that by his only Daughter and Heir it devolved to be the Possession of Sir 
William de Basing,
 with the Mannor of 
Cockride
 likewise, which was folded up in her Inheritance, and was one of those Knights who accompanied King 
Edward
 the first, in the twenty eighth year of his Raign, in that succesful Expedition which he was ingaged in, when he undertook the Conquest of 
Scotland.
 After him, 
William de Basing
 held it, and was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the second; and dying in his Shrievalty, 
Margaret
 his Widdow accounted for the Profits of the County, as the Records of the Pipe Office set forth. Sir 
Thomas de Basing
 his Son died seised of it, in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the third, and paid respective Aid for it under the Notion of a whole Knights Fee, at making the Black Prince Knight, and left it to 
John
 his Son, a Child of eight years of Age, who after was Knighted, and died possest of it in the seventh year of 
Richard
 the second, and left it to 
Thomas
 his Son and Heir, then eleven years of Age, and he had Issue 
Thomas
 likewise, who dying without Issue, 
John Basing
 his Uncle was found to be his Heir, but was scarce planted in his new acquired Patrimony: but he also, in the twenty fourth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, expired without Issue, so that the Inheritance devolved to 
Alice
 his Sister matched to 
Thomas Mackworth,
 as the Heir General of the Family. And thus were the 
Basings
 at this Place extinguished, who before they planted in 
Kent,
 were registred amongst the prime Gentlemen of 
Middlesex: Salomon de Basing
 was Sheriff of 
London,
 the last year of King 
John; Adam de Basing
 was Lord Mayor of 
London,
 in the thirty sixth year of 
Henry
 the third; and 
Robert de Basing
 succeeded in that Office, in the seventh year of 
Edward
 the first, and 
Basings-Hall
 ows both his Name and Foundation to this Family; and 
John Stow
 in his Survey of 
London,
 ascribes to them the Degree of Barons of the Realm. But to return into that Path from whence this Discourse had diverted me. After 
Mackworth,
 which, by Female Devolution, was possest of this Mannor, was worn out, which was about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh: The 
Hornes
 of 
Hornes-place
 in this Parish, were by Purchase settled in the Inheritance. Gentlemen certainly they were of as eminent Account as any in this Territory, and had been Proprietaries of

this Seat for many Hundreds of years; for one 
Ralph de Hurne
 of 
Kenardington,
 was one of the 
Recognitores magnae Assisae,
 in the Raign of King 
John,
 Persons, who, before the Office of Justice of Peace was instituted, did supply their Place, and were much in Resemblance, like the Grand Inquest at this Day, being assistant both by their presence and concurrent Counsels to the Justices in 
Eyre,
 in all the great De∣cisions which did relate to Causes Criminal, emergent 
à tribus Forisfacturis,
 or the three Forfeitures, Murder, Felony, and Breach of the Peace. But to proceed: In this Family, did the Propriety both of 
Hernes-place
 and 
Kenardington
 thus pur∣chased of 
Mackworth,
 lie rolled up together, until the twelfth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then 
Bennet Horne
 the Heir General of both these being matched to ...... 
Guldford
 a 
Romish Catholick,
 he, to decline the Oath of Supremacy, fled beyond Sea with his Wife, upon whose Recesse the Crown seised upon that Estate, which had formerly accrewed to him in behalf of his Wife at this place, as eschea∣ted upon the Statute of 
praemunire.
 And the above said Princesse immediately after, granted the Premises thus forfeited to 
Walter Moile
 of 
Buckwell
 Esquire, Ancest∣or to Mr. 
Robert Moile,
 who claims the present Signiory both of 
Kenardington
 and 
Hornes-place.


Kenington,
 in the Hundreds of 
Chart
 and 
Longbridge,
 was a Mannor which alwaies related to the Crown, as is intimated by the Name, where lie tacitly couched some Hints of those who were Proprietaries of it. And 
Keningbrooke,
 which is circum∣scribed within the Limits of this Parish, was annexed by 
William
 the Conqueror to his Royal Mannor of 
Wye,
 and was looked upon as an Appendage to it, and fol∣lowed the Fate of it at the common Dissolution, when the other was plucked away from the Patrimony of 
Battell Abby,
 in which ever since the Original Donation of 
William
 the Conqueror it had been resident, and was with the Mannor of 
Wye,
 by Queen 
Elizabeth
 granted, in the first year of her Raign, to her Kinsman 
Henry Cary
 Lord 
Hunsdon:
 and his Grand-child 
Hen.
 Earl of 
Dover,
 not many years since, passed it away by Sale to Sir 
Tho. Finch,
 Father to 
Heneage Finch,
 now Earl of 
Winchelsey,
 in whose Revenue it is at this instant setled.


Bibrooke
 is a second Place in 
Kenington,
 which claims some Consideration. It was, as appears by very old Evidences, the Patrimony of a Family called 
Godwin,
 which flourished here in the Raign of King 
John, Henry
 the third, and 
Edward
 the first; but after this it began to wither, and before the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, was altogether crumbled away, the last of whom that I find by publique Record to be invested in the Possession, was 
William Godwin,
 who enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the thirty second year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 93. The next Family after this, which was entituled to the Possession, was 
Belknap;
 but Sir 
Robert Belknap
 being infortunately attainted and banished, in the tenth year of 
Richard
 the second, to whose Cause and Quarrel he had wholly vowed his Life and Service, and his Estate, as to the principall part, confiscated, in which this lay in∣volved, the same Monarch, in the thirteenth year of his Raign, granted it to 
William Ellys,
 who was at that Time one of the Conservators or Justices of the Peace of this County, whose Capital Seat was at 
Burton
 in this Parish, though in very old Deeds it is written 
Burston,
 as being indeed the Seat of a Branch of that Family, from whom it came over about the latter end of 
Edward
 the second, to 
Ellys,
 but in the Name of 
Ellys
 the Title of 
Bibrooke
 was not long-liv'd; for about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, I find it by Purchase invested in 
Shelley,
 by whose Heir General it devolved in the Time of 
Edward
 the fourth, to 
May,
 from whom not long after it was alienated to 
Tilden,
 where it continued, until about the Be∣ginning of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 and then the same Revolution transported the Title to 
Best,
 who about the latter end of that Princesse, passed it away by Sale to 
Hall,
 Ancestor to Mr. 
Nevill Hall,
 the present Lord of this Mansion; but 
Burton
 was more constant to the Family of 
Ellys,
 and remained linked to the Patrimony of that Name, until that Age, which bordered upon our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was demised by Sale to 
Hall,
 in whose Descendant Mr. 
Nevill Hall,
 the Propriety is at present resident.




Keston
 in the Hundred of 
Rokesley,
 belonged (in the twentieth year of 
William
 the Conquerour, as the Pages of 
Dooms-day
 Book inform me) to 
Gilbert de Mag∣ninot,
 and there it is written 
Cheston:
 and continued in his Name, untill the lat∣ter end of King 
John;
 and then by the Heir Generall of this Family, it came to be possest of 
Say,
 of 
Says-court
 in 
Deptford:
 but stayed not long in this Name, for in the twenty fourth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Alexander de Cheyney
 dyed pos∣sest of it, as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 26. But in his Posterity likewise, it had no long Residence; for about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the third, it was con∣veyed to 
Stephen de Ashway;
 and he in the thirty eighth of this Prince, ob∣tained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of 
Keston.
 And here the Title fix∣ed, untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then it was alienated with 
Baston,
 which had still the same original and successive Proprietaries with 
Keston,
 to 
Squerris
 of 
Squerries-court
 in 
Westerham:
 and here it made its aboad untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it devolved by 
Dorothy
 Daughter and Co∣heir of 
Thomas Squerrie,
 to 
Richard Mervin
 of 
Fountell
 in 
Wiltshire,
 who passed a∣way 
Keston
 and 
Baston,
 both which accrued to him, upon the Division of 
Squerrie's
 Estate, to 
Philp Reynolds,
 and 
Thomas Tregarthen,
 as his Trustees; and they, in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, convey them both to 
Richard Scroope
 and 
Ste∣phen Scroop;
 from whom about the latter end of 
Edward
 the fourth, they came to 
Henry Heyden
 Esquire; and he in the first year of 
Richard
 the first, as is manifest, by an old Court-rol, held a Court here at 
Keston;
 and from him, did the Propriety, by the Steps of several Descents, come down to that worthy Person Sir 
Christopher Heydon;
 who about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 demised all his Interest in 
Keston
 and 
Ba∣ston,
 to Sir 
Samuel Lennard,
 whose Son Sir 
Stephen Lennard,
 is still entituled to the Fee-simple of them.


Mr. 
Camden
 conjectures in his 
Britannia,
 something of the Name of 
Caesar,
 to be couched in the Etymologie of this place, because at 
Baston,
 adjoyning, there is an ancient Camp, stupendious for the heighth of double Rampiers, and depth of double Ditches, hardly paralleled elsewhere, and questionlesse the work of ma∣ny Labouring Hands. Of what Capacity it was, is not now exactly to be discer∣ned, much of it being overgrown with a Thicket: but very vast it was, as may be collected, from its remains, which are yet apparent. And most probable, it is that Camp which 
Julius Caesar
 pitched, when the Britons, with their united strength, gave him the last Battle; and then the successe, being not equall to their Cou∣rage, retired, and gave him way to pierce into 
Surrey,
 and so towards the 
Thames
 by 
Noviomagum,
 or 
Woodcott,
 where he planted a spatious City and standing Camp.


Kingsdown
 in the Hundred of 
Wrotham,
 is spread into two Mannors called 
North∣court,
 and 
Southcourt,
 both which anciently acknowledged themselves, to be par∣cell of the Demeasne of 
Fitz Bernard,
 who flourished here, under the Notion, and in the Degree of Barons, and had this Mannor by Grant from 
Henry
 the first, and with it, had these priviledges, annexed to it, 
Toll
 and 
Theam, Sac
 and 
Soc, Furcas in Latrones Captos,
 that is, 
Infangthef
 and 
Outfangthef, Tumbrell
 and 
Pillory,
 and lastly, 
Assisam Panis & Cerevisiae,
 that is, a power to take Cognizance, of the Weights, and Measures of Bread, and that Beverage, which was then in use, within the Precincts of this Mannor; and all these were allowed to 
Ralph Fitz Bernard,
 as granted before by 
Henry
 the first, by the Judges 
Itinerant,
 in the se∣venth year of 
Edward
 the first, and this Man was Son to 
John Fitz Bernard,
 who was rated, after the value, of a whole Knights Fee, for his Mannor of 
Kings∣down
 (as appears by 
Testa de Nevill
) in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third, at the Marriage of 
Isabell,
 that Prince's Sister. 
Thomas Fitz Bernard,
 Son to 
Ralph
 above-mentioned, enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the sixth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 31. And from him, it descended to 
John Fitz Bernard,
 who in the thirty sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, dyed without Issue, upon whose Decease, the four Daughters, of 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 matched to 
Rosse, Vere, Mortimer,
 and 
Tiptoft,
 entered upon the Possession, 
 Heirs to their Mother, who was Sister and Heir, to this 
John Fitz Bernard,
 and

upon the Breaking the Estate into Parcells, upon the Partition, this was united to the Demeasne of 
Wiliam Rosse
 of 
Hamlake,
 in Right of his Wife 
Margaret,
 who was Coheir likewise to her two Brothers, 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 and 
Giles
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 who both dyed without Issue: and 
John Rosse
 this Man's Son was in the Possession of it at his Death, which was in the seventeenth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 49. And from him, did it glide down to his infortunate Grandchild 
Thomas
 Lord 
Rosse,
 who was attainted and beheaded at New-Castle in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, whilst he endevoured to support the sinking House of 
Lancaster,
 upon whose Shipwrack, this was annexed to the Revenue of the Crown, and in the eighteenth year of his Reign, 
Edward
 the fourth, restores it for Life, to 
Margaret,
 Wife of 
Roger
 Lord 
Wentworth,
 who was Widow of 
Thomas
 Lord 
Rosse:
 but after his Deeease, it returned to the Crown, and slept in its Revenue, untill King 
Henry
 the eighth, passed it away by Grant, to 
John Wilkinson;
 from which Name, about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 it was conveyed to 
Richard Lovelace,
 who dying without Issue-male, 
Margaret
 matched to 
Henry Cooke
 of 
Lanham
 Esq;, became his Heir, and in her Right, is now entered upon 
Northcourt
 and 
Southcourt,
 which make up the Mannor of 
Kingsdown.


Hever
 is another Mannor in 
Kingsdown,
 which was parcell of the Demeasne of the ancient Family of 
Hever,
 of 
Hever Castle
 in this County. 
William de Hever,
 had a Charter of Free-warren, to his Lands here, and at 
He∣ver,
 in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the first, which was renued to 
Thomas de Hever,
 in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, but he did not long enjoy it: for he dying without Issue, 
Joan
 his Sister and Coheir, matched to 
Reginald
 Lord 
Cobham,
 be∣came Heir to his Estate at this place, and he in her Right, dyed possest of it, in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third. But before the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, this Family was worn out, and then the Family of 
Ʋrban
 succeeded by purchase in the Possession. 
John Ʋrban
 held it at his Death, which was in the eighth year of 
Henry
 the fifth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 75. And left it to his Sister and Heir 
Emma Penhale,
 and she enjoyed it at her Decease, which was in the fifth year of 
Hen.
 the sixth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 43. But it was not long, after this, in the Tenure of this Name: for 
Richard Lovelace,
 by his last Will, in the year 1465, which was made in the fifth of 
Edward
 the fourth, ordains, that his Feoffees make an Estate of this Mannor of 
Hever,
 which he purchased of 
Penhale,
 to 
Katharine,
 his Daughter; and if she dye without Issue, as she did, then he wills, that it descend to 
John Lovelace
 his Son and Heir: and from this 
John
 did it, by an uninterrupted Series of Descent devolve to 
Rich. Lovelace;
 and from him, did it go away by 
Margaret
 his Sole Daughter and Heir to 
Henry Cook
 of 
Lanham
 in 
Suffolk
 Esquire, in which Name it is at this instant resident.


Chipsted
 is a third Mannor in 
Kingsdown,
 which indisputably gave Seat and Sir∣name to a Family so called. For I find, 
Adam de Chipsted
 dyed possest of it at his Death, which was in the forty first year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 16. And after this Family was extinguished, the 
Mowbrays
 were planted in the Possession, and continued in the Inheritance, from the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth; and then it was passed away by Sale, to 
John Martin,
 Justice of the Common-pleas, whose Son 
John Martin
 in the thirty third year of 
Henry
 the sixth, alienates it to 
Thomas Underdown
 of 
Dert∣ford;
 and he, not long after, gives it to 
Richard Thetcher,
 of 
Warbulton
 in 
Sussex;
 and he in the nineteenth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, sold it to 
William Atwood;
 and his Son 
Robert Atwood,
 in the thirteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, demises one moiety of it to 
Nicholas Taylor,
 and the other Moiety, in the twenty second year of the abovesaid Prince, to 
Sibill
 of 
Littlemoat
 in 
Eynsford. William Taylor,
 and 
William Atwood,
 in the first year of Queen 
Mary,
 passe away their Propor∣tion of it to Sir 
John Champneys,
 and his Son 
Justinian Champneys,
 not long after alienates his Interest in it to 
Lovelace,
 and by the Heir Generall of that Fami∣ly, it is now devolved to Mr. 
Henry Cook
 abovementioned: the other Moiety by 
Ann
 Sole Heir of 
Lancelot Sibill,
 came to be possest by Mr. 
John Hope:
 in which Name it did not long remain; for in our Memory, it was by Sale, demised to Mr. 
Hodsoll,
 of 
Hodsoll
 in 
Ash,
 and he is now in the enjoyment of it.




Woodland
 is the last Mannor in this Parish, and was anciently a Chappell of Ease to 
Kingsdowne,
 till in the year 1557. it was by 
Reginald Fole
 then Cardinal and Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury
 united to 
Wrotham.
 But the Mannor is still circumscribed within the Precincts of 
Kingsdown.
 It was formerly a Branch of that Revenue which owned the Title and Jurisdiction of that powerful Baron, 
Hamon de Creve∣quer,
 and he died possest of it, in the forty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 33. But, after him, I find not much more of this Family at this Place; for in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
John,
 Son of 
John St. Clere
 enjoyed it, as appears by the Inquisition taken after his Death, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 48. Afterwards I discover 
Thomas St. Clere
 to be possest of it at his Death, in the fourth year of 
Hen∣ry
 the fourth, and so was 
Margaret St. Clere
 Widdow of 
Philip,
 in the first year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and 
Thomas St. Clere
 held it in the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the fourth; and from his Descendant, about the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, it passed away by Sale to 
Pett
 of 
Pett-house
 in 
Sevenoke,
 and 
John Pett
 his Successor sold 
Woodland,
 in the seventeenth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 to 
William Rowe
 of 
London;
 by the Daughter and Heir of which Family, even in our fathers Memory, it came over to the instant Possessor, 
Jenny
 of 
Norfolke.


Kingsdown
 in the Hundred of 
Milton,
 was given by 
Hubert de Burgh,
 to his new∣ly erected 
Maison le Dieu
 in 
Dover,
 which was to be a Retreat for the Knights Tem∣plers, when they visired 
Temple Ewell,
 and other Lands they enjoyed in this Track; but this Mannor, upon the total Suppression and Abolition here in 
England,
 was in the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the second, united to the Revenne of the Knights Hospitalers, and remained annexed to their Demeasne, until the common Disso∣lution supplanted it, and then King 
Henry
 the eighth, granted it to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney,
 who in the first year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 by Sale conveyed it to Mr. 
Tho∣mas Finch,
 from whom it is now by Descent come down to be the Inheritance of his Successor Mr. 
Thomas Finch.


Kingston
 in the Hundred of 
Kinghamford,
 was one of those Knights Fees, which was assigned to 
Fulbert de Dover,
 for to be assistant to 
John de Fiennes,
 in the Guard of 
Dover
 Castle. And indeed it hath been disputable, whether this, or 
Chilham,
 or both jointly, were that which in Writings is styled the Honor of 
Fulberts. William de Dover
 was 
Teste
 amongst the 
Magnates
 in the Charter of 
Mawd,
 the Empress, for creating 
Miles
 of 
Glocester
 Earl of 
Hereford;
 and from this man did it descend to 
Richard de Dover,
 who was base Son to King 
John,
 and assumed that Name, be∣cause he had matched with 
Roesia
 or 
Rose de Dover,
 the Heir General of that Family. But he dying in the Beginning of 
Henry
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Car. Num.
 237. lest it to 
Isabell
 his Co-heir, wedded to 
David de Strabolgie
 Earl of 
Atholl,
 whose in∣fortunate Son 
John,
 Earl of 
Atholl,
 a man of an unbroken, though a Calamitous Fidelity towards his Native Country of 
Scotland,
 seeking to rescue the Liberty of that Nation from those Fetters, which the Hand of 
Edward
 the first would have put upon it, was in an unsuccesful Encounter taken Captive, and offered up to the Fury of that Prince on a Gibber fifty Foot high; at 
London,
 saies 
Daniel;
 at 
Canter∣bury,
 saies an old Manuscript, late in the Hands of Sir 
Dudley Diggs:
 which last was rather the Stage on which his Tragedy was represented, because that City was al∣most contiguous to his two great Mannors of 
Chilham,
 and this of 
Kingston.
 Upon his fatal and deplorable 
Exit,
 aggravated, because so much Virtue and Courage, did rather seem to exact Chaplets and Laurels, than so black and ruinous a Cata∣strophe; this Mannor was linkt to the Crown, untill King 
Edward
 the second, in the fifth year of his Raign, grants it to 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 Steward of his House; but he not long after by an ingrateful Defection, having forfeited it again to the Crown; that Prince by a new Concession invests it for life in 
David de Stra∣bolgie
 Earl of 
Atholl;
 but, after his Disease, which was in the first year of 
Edward
 the third, that Prince in the second year of his Raign, restores it to 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 who dying without Issue, left it in the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the third, to his Son and Heir 
Giles,
 who not long after deceasing likewise without any lawful Issue, it came to be divided between his two Sisters and Co-heirs, 
Margaret


wedded to 
William
 Lord 
Rosse
 of 
Hamlake,
 and 
Margerie
 matched to 
John Tiptoft;
 but before the end of 
Edward
 the third, this Family had wholly departed from this place, and the entire Possession was surrendered up to 
Rosse.
 For 
Thomas
 Lord 
Rosse,
 dyed possest of it, in the seventh year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 68. And from him, did the Title slide down to his unhappy Successor 
Thomas
 Lord 
Rosse,
 who was attainted in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, and his Forfeiture brought it to the Crown, where it rested, untill the above∣said Prince, granted it to 
Roger
 Lord 
Wentworth.
 And 
Margaret
 his Wife, Widow of 
Thomas
 Lord 
Rosse,
 in the eighteenth year of his Rule, he conveyed it to him, be∣cause he had been a great Supporter of his Partie and Title, and then to her, because she was Sister to 
John Tiptoft
 Earl of 
Worcester,
 who was offered up, as an Oblation by the Lancastrian Faction, to his Cause and Quarrell; and from this 
Roger,
 did it come down to his Successor 
Richard
 Lord 
Wentworth,
 who in the twenty first year of 
Henry
 the eighth, demised it by Sale to 
Thomas Colepeper
 Esquire, in which Family it continued, untill the thirty fourth year of that Prince: and then it was conveyed away to Sir 
Anthony Aucher,
 whose Successor Sir 
Anthony Aucher
 of 
Bourne
 Baronet, not many years since, conveyed it by Sale to Mr. 
Gibbons
 of 
Westcliff,
 who settled it in Marriage, upon his second Son Dr. 
Gibbons,
 not long since deceased, in whose Descendants, the Propriety is still resident.


Ilding
 in 
Kingston,
 in Times of as high a Step as any Records can ascend to, was the 
Garwintons
 of 
Bekesbourn,
 as appears by that Signal Controversie, com∣menced between 
Thomas de Garwintor,
 and 
Theobald de Twitham,
 touching some lands couched within the Verge of his Mannor of 
Ilding:
 and the Question was so knotty and perplexed, that 
Henry de Cobham, Geffrey de Say, Hugh de St. Leger, Ralph de St. Leger, Gile; de Badelesmere, Fulk de Peyferer, Robert de Malevill, Alex∣ander de Rosse, Robert de Gatton, Robert de Campania, Richard de Bere, Henry de Sorne, Henry de Enbroke, Alured de Corton;
 and other Gentlemen of prime Account in this Track, were chosen 
Recegnitores magnae Assisae,
 in the second year of King 
John,
 by their Prudence and dextrous Conduct, to soften and becalme this Diffe∣rence. But to go on: after the Signory of this place, had for many Ages, been constant to this Family, it devolved to 
Thomas Garwinton,
 who dying without Issue, in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the fourth, 
Richard Haut
 who had married 
Joan Garwinton,
 his Heir Generall in her Right was entituled to the Possession of this place; but his Son and Heir 
Richard Haut,
 was the last which held it: for 
Margery
 his Sole Inheritrix, united it to the Inheritance of 
Isaack,
 in which Name it stayed, untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then it was transmitted by Sale to 
Diggs
 of 
Diggs-court
 in 
Berham,
 and remained clasped up in their Reve∣nue, untill that Age, which almost was concluded in the Circle of our Remem∣brance, and then it was by Sale transplanted into 
Wilford,
 so that the Lady 
Eliz. Wilford,
 Widow Dowager of Sir 
Thomas Wilford,
 is now by Right of Jointure in Possession of it.


Parmested
 is a third place which calls for a Survey: it was as high, as any Evidence drawn from Record will instruct me to discover, the Inheritance of a Family which bore that Sirname: for in diverse old Deeds which I have surveyed, I find one 
Hugh de Permested
 to be a Witnesse, which is very probable, was Lord of this Place. But before the latter end of 
Edward
 the second, this Fami∣ly was worn out, and that of 
Garwinton
 planted in the Possession, as appears by an old Fine levyed in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, by 
Hugh Garwinton
 in which he passes away his Estate at 
Permested,
 to 
Thomas Garwinton:
 from whom it descended to his great Grandchild 
William Garwinton,
 who dyed possest of it, in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the fourth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 45. But left no Issue, so that 
Joan
 his Kinswoman, matched to 
Richard Haut,
 became his Heir; and he had Issue 
Richard Haut,
 in whom the Male-line concluding, 
William Isaac,
 in Right of his Wife 
Margerie,
 who was Daughter and Heir to the above-mentio∣ned 
Richard,
 entered upon his Estate here at 
Permested;
 and about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, passed it away by Sale to 
Edward Knevet,
 of 
Newington Bel∣house
 Esquire, and his Daughters and Coheirs, by joint Sale, demised it to 
Tho.


Lord 
Cromwell:
 and he in the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, alienated it to 
Christopher Hales
 Esquire, afterwards knighted, first Attorney Generall, and then Master of the Rolls, under the abovesaid Prince, and his Son Sir 
James Hales,
 conveyed it away to 
Thomas Alphew aliàs Alphy, Yeoman.
 From this Man it came over by Sale in the fifth year of Queen 
Elizabeth
 to 
William Downe
 of 
Maidstone
 Draper, and he in the sixth year of that Princesse, transmitted it by the like con∣veyance to Doctour 
Vincent Denne,
 Doctour of the Civil Law, Grand-father to Mr. 
Vincent Denne
 of 
Grays Inne
 Esquire, the present Lord of the Fee. A Person to whose Conduct and supply this particular Survey ows a grateful Remembrance, be∣cause, by his Concurrent Aid, it was guided along through all those Difficulties which might have probably intercepted it in its farther progresse.


Denhill
 in this Parish was not only the Seat, but likewise the Seminary of a Fa∣mily of eminent Note in this County; 
Ralph de Den
 held much Land in 
Romney Mersh,
 and likewise at 
Buckhurst
 in 
Sussex
 (as appears by an old Roll now in the Hands of the Earl of 
Dorset
) about the twentieth of 
William
 the Conqueror, and is styled in the Record, Son of 
Robert Pincerna,
 a Name imposed upon his Father from being, as is probable, either Butler or Sewer to 
Edward
 the Confessor, an Office of no vulgar Account in those Times. Sir 
Alured de Den
 flourished in the Raign of 
Henry
 the third, and was a Person of signal Estimate in that Age; for when the Laws of 
Romney Mersh
 were compiled by that venerable Judge, 
Henry de Bath,
 from which all 
England
 receives Directions for Sewers, this Sir 
Alured
 and 
Nicolas de Haudloe
 were his Associates and Assistants in the Composure of them, in the forty second year of 
Henry
 the third, on Saturday next after the Nativity of St. 
Mary;
 and which makes this Sir 
Alured de Den
 more remarkable, he sealed even in that Age, divided by so remote a Distance from us, with three 
Leopards Heads
 couped and full faced, which is the ancient paternal Coat of this Family. Indeed if I should enter into a particular Discourse of all those Persons who have been originally extracted from this Family, and were formerly eminent, not only within the private Sphere of this County, as being invested with the Commission of Justi∣ces of the Peace, and other Offices of publique Trust and Concernment, but like∣wise shone like Stars of the first Magnitude, within the two Orbes of Divinity, and the Law both Civil and Municipal; the Survey of this Place, which I intend to retrench within as narrow Bounds as may be, must swell into a particular Treatise; it is enough therefore to inform the Reader, that it hath been so many Centuries of years folded up in the Propriety of 
Den.
 that there is no 
Gappe
 at all in the Succession between 
Ralph de Den
 the first of that Name, and 
Tho. Den
 Esq; the last who in a direct Line enjoyed it. Nor hath it yet departed from the Name; for the above mentioned 
Thomas,
 lately deceasing without Issue-Male, 
Vincent Donne
 of 
Grays-Inn
 Esquire, collarerally issued out of this Family, by matching with 
Mary
 his yongest Daughter and Coheir in Right of this Alliance, is now in the instant Possession of it.


Kingsnoth
 in the Hundreds of 
Chart
 and 
Longbridge,
 did in elder Times give Sear and Sirname to a Family which assumed its Denomination from hence, who bore as appears by Seals appendant to their ancient Deeds, 
Ermin
 upon a 
Bend,
 five 
Che∣verons,
 and 
John de Kingsnoth,
 who flourished here about the latter end of 
Edward
 the first, sealed with that Coat, and this Inscription encircles the Seal, 
Sigillum Joannis de Kingsnoth.
 Yet I find 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 who was attainted, in the seventeenth year of 
Edw.
 the second, had some Interest in this Mannor, which upon his Conviction escheated to the Crown, and rested there, until 
Richard
 the second, granted it out again to Sir 
Robert Belknap
 the Judge, who had not long before purchased that proportion which 
Kingsnoth
 was concerned in: So that by this Con∣cession it came entirely to own the Signory of this Family. But he being infortu∣nately attainted, and cast into Exile, in the tenth year of the above said Prince; this Mannor was annexed to the Revenue of the Crown, and was lodged there until 
Henry
 the sixth, in the twenty seventh year of his Raign, granted some part of it to Sir 
Thomas Brown,
 of 
Bechworth Castle
 in 
Surrey,
 and with it a Charter to inclose a Parke, which had Liberty of Free-warren annexed to it; and likewise, the more to endear him, licensed this Town to hold a Fair yearly on 
Michaelmas
 Day, but

the principal part of it was conveyed by Sale to Cardinal 
Kemp,
 who about the twenty eighth of 
Henry
 the sixth settled it on the 
Colledge
 of 
Wye,
 where it remained until the Resignation of its Revenue into the Hands of 
Henry
 the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his Raign, and he by Royal Concession made it the Demeasne of 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cromwell,
 afterwards Earl of 
Essex.
 Who being attainted of High Treason, in the thirty second year of that Prince, it escheated back to the Crown, and then a Moiety of it, in the thirty fifth year of his Government, was granted to Sir 
John Baker,
 from whom by hereditary Conveyance it was delegated and transmitted to his Successor Sir 
John Baker
 of 
Sisingherst
 Baronet, who some few years since hath alienated his Concerment here, to Mr. 
Nathaniel Powell
 of 
Ewherst
 in 
Sussex.
 The other Moiety of it lay folded up in the Patrimony of the Crown, un∣till the first year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was by that Princesse granted to her Kinsman 
Henry Cary,
 afterwards created Baron 
Hunsdon,
 from whom by the Channel of Descent, it was transported to his Grand-child, the Right Honorable 
Henry Cary
 Earl of 
Dover,
 who in our Memory conveyed it to Sir 
Thomas Finch,
 afterwards Earl of 
Winchelsey,
 Father to the instant Proprietary, the Right Ho∣norable 
Heneage Finch,
 now Earl of 
Winchelsey.


Munfidde
 in this Parish was originally the Seat of the 
Clere's,
 written in their ancient Deeds 
le Clere.
 But as all Families have their Vicissitudes and Tombs; and, like the Sea, which is circumscribed and shut in with a Girdle of Sand, are fettered to a determinate Period, so was this: for about the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, 
Henry le Clerc
 concluded in 
Susan le Clerc;
 who was his Daughter and Heir, and she by matching with Sir 
Simon Woodchurch,
 annexed this Mannor to his Patrimony; and he the better to inforce and perpetuate the Memory of this Alliance, and the Estate, which devolved to him by so fortunate a Conjunction; inverted his Sirname, and writ it for the future 
Clerc alias Woodchurch;
 in which Name the Propriety of this Place continued until the latter end of Q. 
Elizabeth;
 and then it was alienated to 
Taylor
 of 
Shadoxherst,
 in which Name, the Interest of it, had not long continued; but that it was in our Remembrance by Sale conveyed to 
Whitwick.


West-Halks
 is a third Mannor in 
Kingsnoth,
 which in elder Times was ennobled, for affording a Residence to a Family of this Sirname; who bore in ancient Seals a 
Fesse
 between three 
Hawks,
 or 
Falcons,
 and sometimes one: a Family of no contemptible Estimate, or shallow Antiquity in this Track, as appears by old Escripts, Pedigrees, and other venerable Muniments, which represent this Family under the Character of Gentlemen, for above three hundred years. 
Sampson de Halk
 died about the year 1360, and held not onely this place,

 but much other Land about 
Petham,
 and other Parishes in that Track; but about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, this Family had demised the Propriety of this place to 
Taylor
 of great 
Chart,
 in which Name it was constantly fixed, untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the seaventh, and then it was sold to 
Clerc,
 who about the latter end of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 passed it away to 
Robert Honywood
 of 
Charing
 Esquire; who, upon his Decease, settled it by his last Will on his second Son by his second Wife, Col. ....... 
Honywood
 now the instant Lord of the Fee.


Knowlton
 in the Hundred of 
Eastrye,
 was parcel of the Patrimony of the noble Family of 
St. Leger. Hugh St. Leger
 (who was one of the 
Recognitores magnae Assisae
 in the Raign of King 
John
) held this Mannor in the fourth year of the Raign of that Prince, and left it to his Son 
John St. Leger,
 who in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the third, exchanged it for other Lands with 
Reginald de Cornhill,
 and he in the twenty fifth year of the abovesaid Prince, passed it away by Sale (as the Book of 
Christ-Church
 informs me) to the Prior and Monks of that Covent; but it seems not long after they exchanged it with 
Thomas Perot;
 for he, in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, died possest of it, as appears by his Office, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 31. and left onely a Female Heir, who carried it along with her to 
Langley
 descended out of the County of 
Warwick,
 and being thus chained by this Match to the Interest of this Family, it remained for many Descents fastned to it, and was productive in se∣veral Ages of Men of no vulgar Account, 
William de Langley
 Son of 
William Langley,
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the twenty first, twenty third, twenty fourth, and twenty fifth years of 
Edward
 the third. 
William Langley
 of 
Knolton,
 was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the

fourth year of 
Henry
 the fifth, and likewise Justice of the Peace for this County under that Prince. 
John Langley
 Esquire, was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the seventh, and had Issue 
Edward Langley
 Esquire, who matched with 
Elizabeth
 Daughter of 
Thomas Peyton,
 of 
Peyton Hall,
 in the County of 
Cambridge,
 descended from 
Peytonus de Ʋfford;
 but he dying without Issue, about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, his Wive's Brother Sir 
Robert Peyton,
 by Reason of a former Match in the Raign of 
Henry
 the fifth, between 
Peyton,
 and a Daughter of 
Lang∣ley,
 entered upon it, as Heir General at Law, and he not desirous to desert 
Cambridgeshire,
 to transplant himself into 
Kent,
 assigned 
Knowlton
 for Livelyhood, to his second Son Sir 
John Peyton,
 Grand-father to Sir 
Thomas Peyton,
 the Primier Baronet of this County, who, as lineally extracted from him, does enjoy the Propriety of it.

Peyton

Werd.






L. L. L. L.


LAmberherst
 lies in the Hundred of 
Little Bernefield,
 and was sometimes writ∣ten 
Lamberts-hurst,
 from 
Lambert
 a 
Saxon
 Owner; in old English, this Name imports as much as bright, or holy and glorious Lamp, as 
Herebert
 is bright Lord. Part of this Parish is in 
Kent,
 and the other part in 
Sussex,
 distinguished by a small Stream which rises nere 
Cowden,
 and glides through this Town towards 
Medway.
 The Lordship of 
Lamberhurst
 it self, with the Mannor of 
Woodroff,
 belonged to the Monastery of 
Roberts Bridge,
 and after the Dissolution, were, by 
Henry
 the eighth, granted in the thirteenth of his Reign to Sir 
William Sidney,
 Tutor to King 
Edward
 the sixth, when he was Prince, whose Successor 
Robert Sidney
 Earl of 
Leicester,
 sold 
Lamberherst
 in our Fathers Memory to Mr. 
Porter,
 and 
Woodroff
 to Sir 
Edw. Henden,
 one of the Barons of the Exchequer, who bequeathed it to his Nephew Sir 
John Henden
 lately deceased.


Hodleigh
 in this Parish, was part of that Demeasne which related to the Col∣ledge of 
Lingfield
 in 
Surrey,
 which upon the Suppression, was by 
Henry
 the eighth, granted to 
Thomas Cardan,
 from which Family it passed away to 
Edward Filmer
 Esquire, Ancestor to Sir 
Edward Filmer,
 eldest Son to Sir 
Robert Filmer,
 lately de∣ceased, to whose Demeasne, the Propriety of it, is at present united.


The Abby of 
Begham
 in this Parish, was founded by 
Ela de Sackvill,
 and Sir 
Robert de Thurneham,
 a man of principal Account in the time of 
Henry
 the third,

 and filled with Cannons 
Praemonstratenses,
 or white Cannons called so from their Habit. The Mannor which belonged to it, was by royal Concession. From Q. 
Elizabeth
 it passed away to 
Anthony Brown,
 Viscount 
Montague,
 who not long after alienated the Fee-simple to Alderman 
Barneham
 of 
London,
 who gave it to 
Benedict
 a second Son; and he dying without Issne-male, one of his Daughters and Coheirs, married with 
Dobell
 of 
Sussex,
 and so carried it into the Inheritance of that Family, where the Possession has ever since been setled.


Scotney
 in this Parish, which hath borrowed that Appellation from its locall Situation, and the over-shooting of the Water, was the Residence of a Family distinguished by that Sirname and Denomination: for one 
Walter de Scotney,
 in Times of high Ascent, was Proprietary of this Place, but added not much Reputation to this Mansion, (for as 
Edmund de Hadenham,
 a Chronicler of great Antiquity, attests) he in the year 1259, administred poyson by tacit Strata∣gem, to the Earl of 
Gloucester,
 and his Brother, to destroy them; of which the last dyed, and the first, escaped not without Danger of Life. But to goe on: After this Family was mouldered away at this place, which was about the midst of 
Edward
 the third, the eminent Family of 
Ashburnham,
 of 
Ashburnham
 in 
Sussex,
 were entituled to the Signiory of it. 
Roger Ashburnham,
 who was one of the

Conservators of the Peace for this County of 
Sussex,
 in the first year of 
Richard
 the second, had here a castellated Mansion, did sometimes inhabit at this place, and was by his Successor sold to 
Henry Chichley
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury
 who gave it as Dower to his Niece 
Florence Chichley,
 married to 
Jo. Darrell
 of 
Cale-hill:
 and he assigned it for the Lively-hood of his second Son, whose Posterity have ever since enjoyed it.


Here was also in this Parish the Mansion of the 
Chitcrofts,
 a Family of worth and eminent degree. Their Blazon was precisely the same with the 
Colepepers
 of 
Bay-hall
 not far distant, as if they had been a Cadet of the same House. This is a matter which falls within the Cognizance of my Profession, and because I meet with diverse ancient Houses in this County, which did the like as well as in other Counties; I cannot leave it without setting down such Notes and Ob∣servations, as have been made upon it, having met with so many Examples, of that kind, in the Survey of this Province: For instance, St. 
Nicholas
 of St. 
Nicho∣las
 in the Isle of 
Thanett,
 in the very Eastern part of the Shire, and 
Peckham
 in the Western side of this County, bear the same very Coat Armour; because per∣adventure, they held Land of the Lord 
Say,
 to whose Arms they did desire their own might be assimilated. 
Tutsham
 of 
Tutsham-hall
 in 
West-Farleigh,
 and 
Eastan∣grave
 of 
Eastangrave
 in 
Eden Bridge,
 bear both alike: 
Brenley
 of 
Brenley
 in 
Bough∣ton
 under 
Blean,
 and 
Ratling
 of 
Ratling
 in 
Nonington,
 have no distinction; 
Peyforer
 of 
North-court
 in 
Eseling,
 and 
Lenham
 of 
Lenham,
 lay claim to an Identitie of Impresse or Coat Armour; and lastly, so did 
Watringbury
 of 
Watringbury,
 and 
Savage
 of 
Bobbing-court.
 Now the Reason of this neere similitude, was to pre∣serve the Memory of those, though otherwise of different Families, who had gi∣ven them Education; or else, by particular Feoffments, had endowed them with Land; or lastly, as an acknowledgement of the Service and Fealty they owed them, because they held their Lands by some petty Rent, Charge, or Homage, of some principall Mannor, of which they whose Coat-Armour they had thus imitated were Proprietaries.


West-Langdon
 lies in the Hundred of 
Bewsborough,
 and was a Mannor belonging to the Abbey of 
West-Langdon,
 which was founded by Sir 
William de Auberville
 of 
Westenhanger
 Knight, to the Honour of St. 
Mary,
 and St. 
Thomas
 the Martyr of 
Canterbury,
 and filled with white Cannons or Cannons 
Praemonstratenses,
 in the time of 
Richard
 the first. 
Hugh de Auberville
 the Founder's Son, and Sir 
William Auberville
 Son to this 
Hugh,
 were Benefactors to this House, and this last, Sir 
Williams
 only Daughter and Heir, being married to 
Nicholas de Crioll
 of 
Bellaview
 nere 
Limne Hill,
 brought this Monastery, to be under the Patronage of the 
Criolls,
 whose Demeasn upon the Dissolution, being made the Incom of the Crown, it here resided till Queen 
Elizabeth
 granted it, with all the priviledges annexed to it, in the thirty third year of her Rule to 
Samuel Thornehill
 of 
London
 Esquire, father to Sir 
Timothy Thornehill,
 upon whose Decease his Lady Dowager had 
West-Langdon
 assigned to her by Right of Jointure, as being enstated before upon her in Marriage.


East-Langdon,
 in the Hundred of 
Cornilo,
 did in elder Times augment that Pa∣trimony, which fell under the Signiory of the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury.
 In the year of 
Grace
 824; 
Ulfred
 then Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 exchanged this Mannor and 
Eythorne,
 with the Monks of 
Christ-church,
 for the Mannor of 
Berham,
 as the Records of that Priory discover to me: and being thus united to their De∣measne, it lodged there untill the Government of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then upon the Suppression of the above mentioned Cloister, it was surrendered up with the Remainder of its Revenue, into the Hands of that King, and he in the thirti∣eth year of his Government, granted it to Mr. 
John Masters
 and Mr. 
Thomas Masters
 of 
Sandwich,
 from whom it is now by Descent devolved to be the Inheritance of his Descendant 
Richard Masters
 Esquire.


Apulton
 and 
Southwould
 are two small Mannors, which are seated within the Limits of 
East-Langdon,
 and were scarce worth any memorial: but that they were formerly marshalled under the Demeasne of the eminent Family of 
Male-mains,


in whom the possession was seated; till 
Henry Malmains,
 being embarked in the rebel∣lion of 
Simon de Montfort
 against 
Hen.
 the second, had expiated that Defection with the forfeiture of his Estate, had he not been pardoned and absolved by the Mediation of the 
Abbot
 of 
Langdon,
 to which Covent in Gratitude, his Son and Heir Sir 
John Mal∣mains
 in the sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, gave for ever

 
Apylton
 and 
Southwould:
 the last of which, was in the first year of 
Richard
 the third, exchanged by the succeeding Abbot, with

 
Robert Monins
 Esquire, for 
Mansuers Langdon.
 These three places upon the Suppression of this Abby, were by 
Henry
 the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his reign, exchanged with 
Tho.
 Arch-B. of 
Canterbury
 but were re-assumed by the Crown by another exchange 1 
mo. Eliz.
 though 
Southwould
 or 
Southwood
 was unjustly snatched a∣way from 
Edward Monins
 Esquire, in whose revenue it was found at the dissolution, upon pretence it had been the former demeasne of the Abby of 
Langdon.


The Borough of 
Marton
 or 
Marton-street
 so called by Contraction; but more truely 
Marshtown,
 is circumscribed also within the Limits of 
East-Langdon,
 and gave Name to a Family, which from the Situation of the place, did borrow their first Appellation and were, in old Registers and other records written 
de Marisco.
 And that it was fre∣quent to mould a Sirname from the Site of the place, and after to communicate it to their posterity, as well as from the place it self is most evident; for 
Gilbert de Marisco,
 who was Lord of 
Wolwich,
 in the reign of 
Edw.
 the first, did assume that Sirname from the Situation of that place, which was environed in a considerable part of it, with moist and watery Mersh-land; and so from the low level of this Borough, did the 
Marshes
 now possessors of this place, or the more principal part of it, by right of Inheritance grown hoary and reverend by a prescription and possession of above three hundred years, as appears by their own private Evidences, in elder Times contract the denomitation of 
de Marisco;
 which in Ages of a more modern Pedigree, was melted by Usage, Custome, and common Consent, into the instant Sirname of 
Marsh.


Langley
 in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne,
 was in elder times the Inheritance of a Family called 
Ashway; Will. de Ashway
 is by the book styled 
Testa de Nevil,
 represented to have held it, and have paid an auxiliary supply for it at the Marriage of 
Isabel
 Sister to 
Henry
 the third, in the twentieth year of his reign. After this Family was withered and shrunk into decay, the Lords 
Leybourne
 were entituled to the Signory of it, and 
Will. de Clinton
 Earl of 
Huntington
 held it at his death, which was in the twenty eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 59. in right of his Wife 
Juliana
 Sole Heir of 
Roger de Ley∣bourn
 Lord of 
Leybourne
 Castle; and she after him likewise was in possession of it at her decease, which was in the forty third year of 
Edw.
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 47. But this after her departure for want of Heirs, either direct or collateral, escheating with a wide and opulent patrimony to the Crown, it made its aboad there untill 
Rich.
 the second in the Beginning of his reign, granted it to Sir 
Simon de Burley,
 Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, and Knight of the Garter; who being infortunately attainted in the tenth year of 
Rich.
 the second, this Mannor by escheat reverts to the Crown, and that Monarch in the eleventh year of his reign, grants the Custody of 
Langley
 Park to 
William
 Arch-B. of 
Cant.
 which his Grand-father K. 
Edw.
 the third, had, in the ninth year of his reign, by a special Grant, indulged to 
Will.
 Lord 
Clinton,
 and 
Julian
 his Lady, licensed to be inlarged with 200 Acres of Land; but the Mannor it self was granted to the Dean and Canons of St. 
Stephens
 in 
Westminster,
 in the twelsth year of his reign, as appears by an Inquisition taken at that time, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 159. and amply confirmed in the twenty first year of the abovefaid Prince, as appears, 
Pat.
 1. 
Memb.
 35. 
Parte tertia,
 and remained folded up in their revenue, until the general Sup∣pression in the reign of 
H.
 the eighth, dislodged the Title and planted it in the Crown; and then that Prince by a new Concession, made it the demeasn of 
Leven Buffkin,
 des∣cended from an ancient Family of that Name in 
Sussex;
 and his Successor in our Fa∣thers memory, passed it away to 
Nat. Powel
 Esq; and he not many years since, demised his Interest in it by Sale, to Sir 
Edw. Hales
 Knight and Batonet; from whom it is now descended to his Grandchild Sir 
Edw. Hales
 of 
Tunstall
 Baronet.


Brising
 is another Mannor in 
Langley,
 worthy the remembrance, even in this, that it gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of that denomination. 
Sarin de Rising
 held in the twentieth year of 
Edw.
 the third, and paid respective Aid for it, at making the Black Prince Knight.




In times of a more modern Character the 
Astrys
 were invested in the possession. And 
Jo. Astry
 held it at his decease, as appears by an old Will in the fourth year of 
Edw.
 the fourth: of this Family was 
Ralph Astry,
 who was Sheriff of 
London,
 in the first year of 
Richard
 the third; and likewise 
William Astry,
 who dyed seised of it, in the thir∣ty fifth year of 
Henry
 the eighth: but after his 
Exit,
 the Title was of no longer date in the Tenure of this Family; for the Vicissitude of purchase, about the Beginning of 
Edw.
 the sixth, brought it from this Name to own the Signory of 
Leven Buffkin
 Esq; one of the Justices of the Peace of this County; and in his posterity did it reside, until those Times which were of our Fathers Cognisance, and then it was conveyed by Sale to 
Powel;
 from whom, not many years since, the same revolution hath devolved it back into the possession of the instant proprietary Mr. 
Leven Buffkin.


Lee
 in the Hundred of 
Blackheath,
 in Barbarous old Latine written 
Laga,
 was the residence of an ancient generous Family called 
Bankwell:
 and there is a place in this parish called 
Bankers,
 by Corruption of the Name,, which, in Orthography of more Antiquity and Truth, was written 
Bankwells;
 from whence, certainly, at first issued this Sirname. In the thirty first year of 
Edward
 the first, 
John de Bankwell
 had a Grant by the King's Charter, to have Free-Warren to all his Lands in 
Lee, Levesham
 and 
Bromley.
 And in the return of 
John de Shelving
 High Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the sixteenth and part of the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the second, of all the Knights and men at Arms in this Connty, 
William de Bankwell
 is mentioned in the second degree; he dyed the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and left 
Thomas Bankwell
 his Heir; who in the thirty fifty year of that Prince's Government, deceased possest of 
Lee,
 and a very large proportion of other Land in 
Modingham, Sherfholt
 (now, I think, corruptly called 
Shrawfield
) 
Littlecroft Bankers,
 both in 
Lee, Bromley, Levesham Eltham, Chiselhurst, Detling, Langshot,
 and 
Wickham
 by 
Bromley;
 and left three Sons, accor∣ding to the Custome of 
Gavelkind,
 Heirs to his Inheritance, which were 
John, William
 and 
Robert Bankwell:
 but upon the distinguishing the Estate into parcels, 
Lee, Ban∣kers,
 and 
Sherfholt,
 now corruptly called 
Shrawfield,
 fell to be the patrimony of 
John Bankwell,
 and in this Mans Lineage did the Inheritance of these places divers years reside; till the Name was circumscribed in a Female Heir, who being wedded to 
John Arrapon,
 brought this place to be an adjunct to his Inheritance: And here, I confess, for want of information either from publick or private Record, I am at a losse, and cannot discover, whether by 
Arrapon
 it was sold to the Crown, and from the Crown transmitted to 
Woodvill,
 or else immediately passed away by sale to 
Richard Woodvill,
 Earl 
River,
 who enjoyed it: but upon his Son's untimely death on a Scaffold at 
Pomfret,
 being by the malice and subtlety of 
Richard
 the third, blasted with an As∣persion of Treason, that fatal Stroke which separated his Head from his Body, divided his Estate here from this Name and Family, and united it by Escheat to the Crown: In whose Revenue it was resident, until King 
Henry
 the eighth, (as is manifest by the original Patent) granted it to Sir 
Thomas Wroteley.
 In times of a more modern As∣pect, that is, about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 I find it in the Tenure of 
Thomas Sackvill
 Lord 
Buckhurst;
 but how it devolved to him, I confesse, I know not; and from him it descended to his Grandchild 
Richard Sackvill
 Earl of 
Dorset,
 who exchanged it with King 
James;
 whose Successor King 
Charls,
 sold the Royaltie and Fee-simple of it to 
Ralph Freeman
 Lord Maior of 
London,
 who gave it in Marriage with his Daughter and Heir to Sir 
George Sonds
 of 
Leeze-Court
 in 
Shelvich,
 Knight of the Bath, who by a Right derived from that Match, is the present Lord of 
Lee,
 and its two Appendages 
Bankers
 and 
Shrawfield.


Leeds, Town
 and 
Castle,
 lies in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne,
 and were by 
William
 the Conquerour in the twentieth year of his Reign (as appears by the Text of 
Dooms∣day
 Book) assigned to 
Hamon de Crevequer,
 whom he had constituted one of the Trustees to assist his Cousin 
John de Fiennes,
 in the Conservation and Guard of 
Dover
 Castle, who chose this for the Capital Seat of his Barony of 
Crevequer,
 or 
decrepito Corde,
 for so it is rendered in Latin, and of 
Chetham
 near 
Rochester
 (for of that place likewise, he and his posterity sometimes writ themselves Barons) and here erected a stupendous Castle, which because it was environed with Water,

was called the Moat. 
Hamon de Crevequer
 married 
Matilda
 Sole Daughter and Heir of 
William de Averenches,
 Baron of 
Folkstone,
 and had Issue by her, 
Robert de Crevequer,
 who by Disloyalty lost himself, and his Soveraign's Favour. And then this Mannor being seised on by the Crown, King 
Henry
 the third, the more to oblige and endear 
Roger de Leybourn,
 gave him this Mannor and Castle in exchange for some Lands which he enjoyed at 
Troscliff,
 as appears 
Pat.
 52. 
Hen. tertii:
 But it seems, either he, or his Successor, quickly re-invested the possession into the Crown, as being a piece of Strength that the Prince began to look upon with Jealousie and Caution: for 
Edward
 the second, as is manifest, 
Pat.
 10. 
Edwardi secundi,
 granted the Mannor and Castle of 
Leeds
 with the Advowson of the Priory, to 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer
 (who was great Grandchild to 
Guncelin de Badelesmer,


 which 
Gun∣celin
 with his Brother 
Ralph de Badelesmer,
 are enrolled in the List of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen who accompanied King 
Richard
 the first, to the Siege of 
Acon;
 and Son to

 
Guncelin de Badelesmer,
 who was Justice of 
Chester
 in the Reign of 
Edw.
 the first, an Office eminently considerable, and of much importance in that Age) in exchange for the Mannor of 
Addrisley
 in 
Shropshire.
 And the Advouson of the Church, and the Addition of this, swelled both his Estate and Ambition to that heighth, that he must be Master of all the remarkable places in 
Kent,
 or else his Sails could not fill: For he had the Barony of 
Fitz-bernard
 at 
Kingsdown, Tong Castle, Chilham Castle, Ridlingswould,
 and 
Hothfield.
 But such a Tempest rose at this place, as utterly overwhelmed him with one Gust. The History is well made up by many Authors; the Abstract is thus. Queen 
Isabel,
 Wife to 
Edward
 the second, who had ever been the Nurse of peace, and laboured to accord the King and his Barons, making her progresse towards 
Canterbury,
 was disposed to lodge in this Castle, as belonging to the Lord 
Badelesmer,
 who had been long King 
Edward's
 Steward; and sending her Marshal to make ready for her and her Train, they who kept the Castle, told him plainly that neither the Queen nor any else, should enter without Letters from their Lord. The Queen her self goes to the Castle, and receives the same Answer: whereupon she is necessitated to take such Lodging otherwhere as could be provided: Of which Indignity she complains to the King, who resent∣ed it with so much passion, as instantly with an Army collected in 
London,
 he layes Siege to the Castle, carries it, hangs the Castellan 
Thomas Colepeper,
 sends the Lady and Children of the Lord 
Badelesmer
 to the Tower, and seises upon his Goods and Treasure. He, to revenge this Devastation of his Castle, associates with the Barons, then in Arms, who pretended the Common good and publick Liberty of the People (they being still that unhappy Vessel which every Tempest shipwracks, but no Calm secures: Or, indeed, being like the Sea, which never swells into Disorder, untill it be breath'd upon by intemperate Winds; and yet even those very Winds break to pieces those waters which they first raised into Billows and Surges.) But, to go on; This Design (whether the Foundation, on which it was fixt, were crazy and infirme or not, I know not) was Ruinous to 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 and the Barons his Partisans; for they were defeared by the Forces of King 
Edward,
 and amongst the rest this Lord, and the Lord 
Ashburnham
 being by their misfortune made prisoners, were put to Death at 
Canterbury.


Upon this Shipwrack, this Castle reverts to the Crown; and Arch-bishop 
Arundell
 having a mind equivalent to his Birth, gets such a Grant of this Castle, as in many Acts of his, he dates them, At his Castle of 
Leeds:
 and you may observe that this would not serve the turn neither, for he was at the same time Constable of the late before builded Castle of 
Quinborough.
 But the Estate he had in it determined with him, and then it remained in the Crown, and was reputed one of the Kings Houses, and the Custody was conferred upon some of the principal Gentlemen of 
Kent,
 whom the King 
pro tempore
 favoured. And it seems it had the Reputation to be a piece of important Strength in the reign of 
Henry
 the fourth: for 
Richard
 the second, as 
Fabian
 in his Chronicle relates 
fol.
 165. was by that Prince sent prisoner to this Castle. In the Raign of 
Edward
 the fourth, I find the propriety of it altered; for that Prince seeking to endear the 
St. Legers
 to him, who were then a Family who had a powerfull Influence upon this County, made 
Ralph St. Leger
 Esquire, Constable of the Castle of 
Leeds,
 and annexed the park too, to his Grant,

(for anciently there belonged two Parks unto it, though both are now clearly dis∣parked and vanished) but the Fee-simple remained in the Crown, untill 
Edward
 the sixth in the fourth year of his Rule, granted it to 
Anthony St. Leger
 his Suc∣cessor, who was Lord Deputy of 
Ireland,
 and improved the 
English
 Interest in that Province by his Prudence and Magnanimity to that heighth and Advantage that he re∣duced most of the old Septs of the 
Irih
 Nobility, and made them become Feodall to the 
English
 Scepter, which could never be accomplished since the first Conquest of 
Ireland,
 till his Time; but his Son Sir 
Warham St. Leger
 was the last of the Name, who was proprietary of 
Leeds
-Castle, for he sold it to Sir 
Richard Smith,
 who not long after determined in two Daughters and Co-heirs, matched to Sir 
Timothy Thorn∣hill
 of 
Kent,
 and to Mr. 
Barrow
 of 
Suffolk,
 who both by mutual Consent did devest themselves of their Interest in it, and by Sale transplanted the Inheritance into Sir 
Thomas Colepeper
 now of the Parish of 
Hollingbourne,
 who setled it in marriage upon his Son Sir 
Cheyney Colepeper
 now Lord of the Fee.


The Priory of 
Leeds
 was founded by 
Robert de Crevequer,
 soon after the building of the Cattle, and not long after the Conquest, and stored with black Canons, or Canons of St. 
Augustins,
 and dedicated to St. 
Mary
 and St. 
Nicholas.
 The Successors of this 
Robert de Crevequer
 were all of them Benefactors. 
Robert de Crevequer
 Son of 
Dan. de Crevequer,
 who was Son of 
Rob. de Crevequer
 the Founder, 
dedit Terras Canoni∣cis de Leed pro Salute Animae Reg. Hen. secundi qui eum aluit & Militem fecit
 (says the 
Coucher
 Book.) There was a goodly Church annexed to this Priorie, parallel to many Cathedrals, whose Glory and Beauty were both blasted when the Priorie above men∣tioned suffered the Common Calamity of that great Tempest of the Dissolution. This, upon that Suppression, augmenting the Revenue of the Crown continued with it, until K. 
Edward
 the sixth in the fourth year of his reign, passed it away by Grant to Sir 
Anthony St. Leger,
 whose Son Sir 
Wartham St. Leger,
 about the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 conveyed it to 
Norden,
 and not long after alienated his right in it to 
Francis Colepeper
 Esquire, who not long after disposed of it again by Sale to 
Norden,
 in which Family it rested, until the same vicissitude brought it to be the Inheritance of 
Covert,
 from which Family hath the Fate of Sale not many years since brought it to be the instant Patrimony of Sir 
William Merideth.


Leigh
 in the 
Lowey
 of 
Tunbridge,
 is sometimes written 
West-Leigh,
 and very often 
West-Leigh alias Pauls:
 It was, in Ages of a very high Gradation, the 
Penchester
's, and in 
Dooms-day
 Book there is mention of

 
Paul de Penchester,
 who held Lands here, and at 
Pencehurst;
 and from this Man was it by a continued Series, brought down to Sir 
Stephen de Penchester,
 Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Constable of 
Dover
 Castle, who exspired in two Daughters and Co-heirs, whereof 
Joan
 the eldest, was married to 
Henry
 Lord 
Cobham,
 of 
Roundall
 in 
Shorn:
 and 
Alice
 the other, was married to 
John
 Lord 
Columbers,
 as appears by an Inquisition ta∣ken in the third year of 
Edward
 the third, and she had for her proportion as∣signed her, the Mannors of 
West-Leigh
 and 
Pencehurst.
 Sir 
Thomas de Columbers,
 was Heir apparent to this 
John de Columbers,
 and 
Alice
 his Mother; and he, by his Deed bearing Date from the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the third passed away all his Interest in this place, to Sir 
John de Poultney
 Lord Maior of 
London,
 and he died possest of it, in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the third, immediately after, I find Sir 
Nicholas Lovain,
 Son of 
Guy Lovain,
 interessed in the possession: but whether it was by Marriage of 
Margaret,
 Widow of Sir 
John Poultney,
 or by purchase, I cannot discover; and he had Issue 
Nicholas Lovain,
 who held it as Heir to his Father, as appears by an Inquisition taken after his Deeease, in the forty fourth year of 
Edward
 the third: but this 
Nicholas
 dying without Issue, 
Margaret Lovain
 his Sister, became his Heir, who brought it to her Husband 
Philip St. Clere
 of 
Aldham St. Clere,
 Son of 
John St. Clere:
 and they by joint Concurrence, by their Deed of Sale, bearing Date the tenth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, passed it away to the Crown; and that Prince bequeathed this Mannor of 
West-Leigh,
 with several other Lands to 
John
 Duke of 
Bedford
 his third Son, after Lord 
Regent
 in the minority of 
Henry
 the sixth; but, he deceasing and leaving no Issue, it came to 
Humphrey
 Duke of 
Glocester
 his fourth Brother, who being strangled by the procurement of 
William De la pole
 Duke of 
Suffolk
 in the Abbey of 
Bury,
 and dying with∣out

any Posterity, King 
Henry
 the sixth in the twenty fifth year of his Rule, granted this Mannor being an Adjunct to 
Pencehurst,
 to 
Humphrey Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 Ancestor to 
Edward Stafford,
 who being attainted of high Treason, in the thirteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, lost both his Life, Title, and Estate; and then it was granted by that Prince, to Sir 
Rafe Vane,
 who was made Banneret by that Prince for his remark∣able Service in 
Scotland:
 but he being unsuccessefully wound up, in the Businesse of the Duke of 
Somerset,
 in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the sixth, was executed as guilty of Fe∣lony, upon whose ruinous Catastrophe, this Mannor by Escheat returning to the Crown it was in the seventh year of 
Edward
 the sixth, granted to Sir 
William Sydney,
 a person of deep Knowledge, and unblemished Integrity, great Grand-father to 
Robert
 now Earl of 
Leicester,
 and Proprietary of 
West-Leigh.


There is another Mannor in this Parish called 
Philipotts,
 which yielded a Sirname to a Family so styled, and in a Deed which bears Date from the twenty eighth year of 
Ed∣ward
 the first, whereby one 
John de Philipott,
 does demise some parcels of Land, to 
Ro∣bert Charles
 Bailiff of the Forest of 
Tunbridge,
 he writes himself 
de Philipotts
 in 
Leigh:
 but as all things have their Revolution, which gives either their own Ruines or Ob∣livion to them for a Sepulchre; so it was here: For after this place had for some Hun∣dreds of years been wrapt up in the Inheritance of this Family, it at last came down to 
Thomas Philipott,
 whose Daughter and Heir 
Alice,
 was married to 
John Petley
 Esquire, and so 
Philipotts
 fell under the Signiory of that Family: but long it continued not there, for this man determined in four Daughters and Coheirs, one of whom matching with 
Children,
 a Family so called, interwove it with his Demeasne; in which Name, after it had for some years been fixed, it was not long since by the Daughter and Heir of this Name, brought to be the Inheritance of 
Polhill.


Lenham
 in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne,
 is that place, which Mr. 
Camden
 and Mr. 
Lambert
 conelude, was 
Durolenum,
 a City of the Romans, mentioned by 
Antonius
 in his 
Iti∣nerarium;
 though others would have it to be about 
Newington,
 by 
Sedingbourn:
 But finding the consulary way, went through this place; and Roman Coine found many Times nere the Fosse and Surface of that way: and that the high Road cal∣led 
Watling-street,
 continued in the Line of the former, till 
Rochester
 Bridge was built of stone; and all that have written of that way, do agree that it went through the middle of 
Kent:
 I will not further dispute it, but acquaint you that the Composition of the Name was from 
Dore, Water
 in the 
British,
 and 
Lenum
 which the Romans formed from some such sounding Name in the British Dialect, and it is the more probable, because from hence is a direct way to 
Limen,
 the Romans Haven nere 
Hyth.


The Soile and Signiory, were given to the Abby of St. 
Anstins
 by K. 
Kenwulf
 under the Notion of one and twenty Plough-lands in the year 804, and upon the Disso∣lution was united to the Crown, till Queen 
Elizabeth,
 passed it away by Grant to 
Tho. Wilford
 Esquire, whose Son Sir 
Tho. Wilford
 conveyed it by Sale not many years since to 
Anthory Brown
 Viscount 
Montacute.


East-Lenham
 was long time since, the Seat of the 
Husseys,
 of whom I have spo∣ken before in 
Boughton Malherbe. Henry Hussey
 had a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at 
East-Lenham, Chilston,
 and 
Stourmouth,
 in the fifty fifth of 
Henry
 the third; and from this Man, did thethread of a continued Descent waft it along to 
Henry Hussey,
 who about the twenty sixth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, alienated the Possession to Mr. 
John Parkhurst,
 descended from an ancient Family so called in 
Norfolke,
 (one of which Name was Bishop of 
Norwich,
 in the year 1560,) Ancestor to that ingeni∣ous Gentleman Sir 
William Parkhurst
 who has lately by Sale transmitted his Right in this Mansion to Mr. 
Wood
 of 
London
 Merchant.


Royton
 in this Parish, had very good Gentlemen so styled, who were no small space possessed of it, and had a Free Chappel founded by 
Robert de Royton,
 about the latter end of 
Henry
 the third, from whence it borrowed the Name of 
Royton
 Chappel, it being annexed to this mansion. The Daughter and Heir of 
Royton
 was wedded to 
James Driland
 of 
Davington,
 and so this place became appropriated to the Interest of that Family; but shortly after, 
Constance
 Daughter and Heir of this man, married 
Walsingham
 of 
Chiselhurst,
 whose Son 
James Walsingham,
 passed it a∣way

by Sale to 
Robert Atwater
 of 
Putwood
 in 
Otteringden;
 and he not long after con∣cluding likewise in a Daughter and Heir called 
Mary,
 she by her Marriage with 
Robert Honywood
 Esquire, a younger Branch of the 
Honywoods
 of 
Elmsted,
 knit this Place to the Patrimony of that Family; and 
Robert Honywood
 this Mans Son gave it in Dower with his Daughter to 
Thomson,
 descended from the 
Thomsons
 of 
Petham.


There are two other Mannors in 
Lenham
 of Signal Estimate; the First is 
West-Shelve,
 written likewise 
Middle-Shelve;
 it was parcel of the Estate of 
Bertram de Criol,
 and by 
Joan
 his Daughter and Heir was linked to the Revenue of her Husband Sir 
Richard de Rokesley,
 from whom the Fate of Female Interest devolved it on 
Thomas de Poynings;
 and to this Family was it for many ages fastned, till Sir 
Edw. Poynings,
 ex∣tracted lineally from this Man, in the fourteenth year of 
Hen.
 the eighth, was found to have died both without lawful Issue, and without Alliance: and so this Name being both in the direct and collateral Line extinguished, the Crown laid claim to this Man∣nor as 
de Jure
 escheated; and in the seventeenth year of his Government, 
Henry
 the eighth granted it to 
John Mills,
 where after the possession had for some Time continued, it was by Purchase brought into the Inheritance of 
Darel,
 by whose Female Heir it is now brought to own the Signorie of 
Wilkinson.


Shelve Cobham
 is another Mannor in 
Lenham
 which in elder Times was folded up in the Inheritance of the Lords

 
Cobham
 of 
Sterborough
 Castle; of which Family was 
Richard de Cobham
 made Knight Banneret by 
Edward
 the third, as appears, 
Pat.
 15. 
Edw. tertii Parte secunda Memb.
 22. and having continued many Descents, constant to the Interest of this Family, it did at last devolve to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cobham
 of 
Ster∣borough,
 who dying in the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, without Issue Male; 
Ann
 his only Daughter and Heir, brought it to be parcel of the Patrimony of 
Edward
 Lord 
Borough
 of 
Gainsborough;
 from whom the Propriety of it did flow down to his Grand-child 
Thomas
 Lord 
Borough,
 who conveyed it by Sale to Mr. 
John Pekenham,
 in the twenty fifth year of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and he was possest of it, but untill the thirty fifth year of that Princesse; and then an Alteration like the former, made it the De∣measn of 
Boteler,
 in which Name after it had remained, until the fifth of K. 
Charles,
 it was alienated by Sale to Sir 
John Melton,
 whose Son 
John Melton
 Esquire, hath lately conveyed it to Mr 
Salomon Adye.


Sindall
 is the last place of Account, in this Parish of 
Lenham;
 which as appears by the Evidences of this place, was, in the Raign of King 
John,
 and 
Henry
 the third, the Inheritance of a Family of that Sirname, and as appears by some old Rolls and Ar∣morials were Gentlemen of prime Note in this Track, but continued not long owners of this Mansion; for in the twenty third year of 
Edw.
 the third, I find it in the Hands of 
Fulk de Peyforer,
 and in this Family did it fix, until the latter end of 
Edward
 the third; and then it was passed away to 
Henman,
 in which Name the Interest of this Place, from the fiftieth year of the above Prince, by a derivation of several Descents, until this present year 1658, hath been successively resident.


Leveland
 in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of that Denomination; for I find that 
Giles de Badelesmer
 of 
Badelesmer
 not far distant, was par∣doned by 
Hen.
 the third, for matching with 
Margaret de Leveland
 the Heir of this Place, without the Kings especial License, as is manifest, 
Pat.
 40. 
Hen.
 3. 
Memb.
 8. But he deceasing before her, she was remarried to 
Fulk de Peyferor,
 who in her Right, died possest of this place, in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the first: but she had no Issue by nei∣ther of these two eminent persons; so that 
Rafe de Leveland
 was her next Heir, who had the Custody of the Palace of 
Westminster,
 and the 
Fleet;
 and after his Deeease, 
Stephen de Leveland
 held both these places as his Brother and Heir; This 
Stephen
 had a Daughter and Heir called 
Joan,
 first wedded to 
John Shench,
 and secondly, to 
Edward de Cheyney,
 who in her Right had the Custody of the 
Fleet
 and Palace of 
Westminster:
 But 
John Shench
 was her Son and Heir, who by a Right derived to him by Descent and Succession, held both the 
Fleet
 and 
Westminster,
 and was in the Possession both of them and 
Leveland,
 at his Decease; as an Inquisition taken after his Death, in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the third does signifie, and left 
Margaret
 his Daugh∣ter Heir not onely to his Estate at 
Leveland;
 but likewise to those Offices of Trust, which it seems were in those Times hereditary, and usually lincked together: But

this Family of 
Shench,
 was not so entirely invested in the Signory of 
Leveland,
 but that a considerable Proportion of it augmented the Patrimony of 
Northwood;
 for 
Robert de Northwood,
 held an Estate here at his Death, which was in the thirty fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 70. and so did 
Richard de Northwood,
 and 
Thomas
 Brother of the said 
Richard,
 as appears by an Inquisition taken in the thirty fifth of the abovesaid Monarch, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 13. 
Parte secunda.
 But before the latter end of 
Edw.
 the third, both these Families had offered up their joynt Interest here to 
Richard
 Lord 
Poynings,
 and he died possen of it, in the twelfth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 148. and left his interest here, to be enjoyed by his Kins∣man 
Robert Poynings;
 from whom an uninterrupted Line of Descent, brought it down to Sir 
Edward Poynings,
 who died in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and there being none, after a serious Inquisition taken in the fourteenth year of that Prince, who could establish any Claim or pretence, either in respect of any direct or collateral Affinity to his Estate, the Crown by Escheat was entituled to this Mannor: and here the Propriety was lodged, until King 
Henry
 the eighth, before mentioned granted it to Sir 
Robert Southwell,
 who in the second year of 
Edward
 the sixth, conveyed it to Sir 
Anthony Aucher;
 and he not long after passed it away to Sir 
Anthony Sonds
 great Grandfather to Sir 
George Sonds
 Knight of the 
Bath,
 now instant Lord of the Signory of it.


Lewsham
 in the Hundred of 
Blackheath,
 was a Mannor which belonged to the Priory which was erected here; but who was the Founder is unknown. Onely thus we find that King 
Henry
 the third, by a new Inspection confirmed it, with all the Franchises and Immunities annexed to it, as appears 
Cart.
 13. 
Hen. tertii Memb.
 9. It was, when it flourished most, but a Cell of Benedictin Monks belonging to Saint 
Peters
 in 
Gaunt,
 and paid to them 40 
s. per Annum,
 as a Rent-Service; as appears, 
Rot. Esc. An.
 12. 
Ric. secundi N.
 72. And so continued, till King 
Henry
 the fifth, perceiving the ill Effects and impressions, which the Influence of Priories-Aliens, and their Fraterni∣ties, might cause upon those Religious persons, who were his Subjects, who were al∣together chained by a Connexion of Canonical Obedience to them, suppressed this and sundry others of the like Nature, and with their Revenue endowed that stately Monastery, which he erected at 
Shene,
 storing it with 
Carthusian
 Monks, and dedi∣cating it to the Name of Jesus of 
Bethlem:
 and in the Patrimony of this Cloister did this Mannor lie included, till the total Dissolution in that general Shipwrack in the Rule of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it returned to the Crown; and there was lodged, till Queen 
Elizabeth,
 in the fifth year of her Government, granted it to 
Ambrose Dudley
 Earl of 
Warwick,
 who soon after exchanged it for other Lands with the said Princess; and she in the year 1575, granted it in Lease for a space of forty years to Sir 
Nicholas Stodard
 of 
Modingham,
 which expiring in the year 1605, King 
James
 passed it away in Lease for forty years more to Sir 
Francis Knolls,
 and the Fee-simple in Reversion to 
John Ramsey
 Earl of 
Holderness;
 who dying before the Expiration of the Lease, gave it to his Brother Sir 
George Ramsey,
 whose Son 
John Ramsey,
 when the former Lease was worn out, which was about the year 1645, sold the Fee-simple to Mr. 
Reginald Grime.


Catford
 in this Parish, was formerly a Mannor which anciently was involved in the Inheritance of the 
Abels
 of 
Hering-Hill
 in 
Eri
h;
 and 
John Abel
 had a Charter of Free Warren to this, and other of his Lands in 
Lewsham,
 in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first, and after this Family was worn out, the Lords 
Mountacute
 were Lords of the Signory, and Fee-simple of it, for 
William de Mountacute
 Earl of 
Salis∣bury;
 obtained by Charter a Confirmation of Free Warren to this Mannor of his of 
Catford,
 in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the third; and in this noble Family did the Pos∣session dwell, till 
Richard de Nevil
 married 
Eleanor
 Daughter and Heir of 
Thomas de Mountacute
 Earl of 
Salisbury,
 and in her Right had the Title of that Earldome, and the Possession of this Place enstated upon him, and divers of the Windows of the most an∣cient Houses in 
Lewsham
 are stained and coloured with his Armes. This was that 
Rich.
 who gave up his Life to the Cause and Quarrel of the House of 
York,
 and with 
Richard
 Duke of 
York
 most resolutely asserting the Truth and Justice of their Title to the Crown perished in the fatal and infortunate Battle commenced with the Partisans

of the Lancastrian Claim between 
Sandall
 and 
Wakefield,
 and afterwards his Son 
Richard
 Earl of 
Warwick
 (he that broke and piec'd up the Scepter as he pleased) and his younger Son 
John Nevil
 created Marquess 
Montacute
 by 
Edward
 the fourth, in the year 1470, fell in that dysastrous Encounter waged with 
Edward
 the fourth at 
Barnet;
 upon whose Ruines and Tombs he built his Throne, and with their Blood coemented the Fabrick of his future Greatness: But whether upon the Shipwrack of this Fa∣mily, it came by Escheat to the Crown; or else to 
George,
 Duke of 
Clarence,
 second Brother to 
Edw.
 the fourth, who espoused 
Isabel
 Daughter and Coheir of 
Richard
 E. of 
Warwick
 is incertain, though it is probable it did, because in a Great House of Mr. 
Streets
 at 
Lewsham,
 the Armes of the Duke of 
Clarence,
 stand empal'd with 
Nevil.
 In Times of a more modern Aspect, 
Catford
 was the 
Polsteds,
 a Family of very deep Antiquity in 
Sur∣rey;
 for 
Hugh de Polsted
 gave Lands called 
Inwood
 by his Deed dated the sixteenth year of King 
John,
 to the Abby of 
Waversley
 in that County; but whether this place came to them, or not, by Grant from the Crown, or by Purchase from some other, I am ignorant; 'tis certain that 
Francis Polsted,
 Cousin and Heir to 
Richard Polsted,
 sold 
Catford
 to 
Brian Annesley
 Esquire, in Reversion after the Decease of 
Elizabeth
 Wife of 
John Wolley,
 and Widdow of the said 
Richard,
 in the twentieth year of Queen 
Eliz.
 And He afterwards dying without Issue Male, his two Daughters married to Sir 
William Harvey
 after Lord 
Harvey
 of 
Kidbrook
 in 
Kent,
 and Sir 
John Wildgoose,
 shar'd the Inheritance of this Place.


There were two Chantreys founded at 
Lewsham.
 One by 
Rich. Walker,
 for one priest to celebrate Mass at the Altar of the Trinity for the Founder's Soul: The other by 
Roger Fitz,
 who by the Appointment of his last Will, the seventeenth of 
Henry
 the seventh, devised that his two Houses the Lion and the Ram in the Stews on the Banck∣side near 
London,
 should be sold to build the Chantry House, and indow it with maintenance for one Priest to celebrate at the Altar of the Trinity in 
Lewsham
 Church for the Founder's Soul.


Leybourne
 in the Hundred of 
Larkfield,
 was the ancient Demeasn of the Lords 
Leybourne,
 who erected here a Castle esteemed a strong Pile in our Ancestors Dayes: however the Ruines and Raggs of it at present appear mean and despicable, yet it hath by several Gradations sunk into this Condition. The first of which Family which I find to be eminent, was,

 
Roger de Leybourne
 who is enrolled in the Catalogue of those 
Kentish
 Knights, who accompanied 
Richard
 the first to the Siege of 
Acon,
 and another 
Roger de Leybourne
 is in the Roll of this 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who assisted 
Henry
 the third, in his Expedition into 
Gascony,
 in the thirty seventh year of his Raign, and afterwards was a principal Partisan of 
Simon de Montforts
 in his Emotions and rude Essorts against his Scepter and Government; for which he was pardoned by the Act of 
Amnestia,
 or Pacification of that Prince, made in the fiftieth year of his Raign at 
Killingworth,
 and this is that 
Roger
 which slew 
Ernulphus de Monteney,
 at a meeting of the round Table, in the thirty sixth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and was the Husband of 
Eleanor
 Countess of 
Winchester.
 Sir 
Henry
 and Sir 
Simon de Leybourne
 are recorded in the List of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who assisted the 
Edward
 the first, in his Siege of 
Car∣laverock
 in 
Scotland,
 in the twenty eighth year of his Reign; and for their signal Service performed in that Expedition were dignified with the Order of Knighthood. 
William de Leybourne
 one of this Family, was frequently summon'd to sit in Parliament as Baron, in the Raign of 
Edward
 the first, and by that Title subscribes in that memo∣rable Letter, which the abovesaid Prince and all the 
English
 Peerage wrote to the Pope, in the year of 
Grace
 1301, that is, in the twenty ninth of 
Edward
 the first's Go∣vernment, to justifie those Grounds on which the war was then commenced against the 
Scots;
 and this 
William
 was Son of 
Roger de Leybourne,
 which 
Roger
 was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 the forty eighth and fiftieth of 
Henry
 the third. The last of this Family was 
Roger de Leybourne,
 who transmitted this Castle and Mannor to his Sole Daughter and Heir 
Juliana de Leybourne,
 first matched to 
Jo. de Hastings,
 and secondly, to 
William de Clinton
 Earl of 
Huntingdon,
 by both which Husbands She had no Issue: so that dying in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third, after all Titles were winnowed by a serious Inquisition, there was none discovered that could by a pretended Claim either of di∣rect or collateral Alliance challenge her Estate. So that her Patrimony here lapsed by

Escheat to the Crown, after which, K. 
Richard
 the second by patent, in the ninth year of his Raign, 
Part. prima, Memb.
 26. grants it to Sir 
Simon Burleigh
 Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports: but, he being shortly after attainted with the Cuilt of High Treason, and his Estate consiscated, this Mannor and Castle reverts to the Demeasne of the Crown; and the same King 
Richard,
 in the twelfth year of his Raign, grants it to the Abby of 
Grace
 upon 
Tower-Hill,
 and in their Revenue it continued shut up till the Dissolution of this Covent, and then King 
Henery
 the eighth, about the thirty seventh year of his Raign, granted it to Sir 
Edward North,
 who not long after alienated it to 
Robert Gosnold:
 and he in the second year of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 gave it to 
Robert Godden,
 who some few years after, by Sale passed it away to 
Nicholas Lewson
 Esq; of 
Whorns-Place
 in 
Cuckston,
 whose Grandchild Sir 
Richard Lewson,
 affecting more to live in 
Stafford-shire,
 alienated his 
Kentish
 Lands: amongst which, this was sold to 
Henry Clerke
 Serjeant at Law, and Recorder of 
Rochester,
 who being lately deceased, his Son and Heir 
Francis Clerke
 Esquire, enjoys the Profits and Possession of it, of whose Family I have spoke at 
Frensbury,
 and shall speak more at 
Ulcombe.


The 
Grange
 in this Parish, is the Mansion of Mr. 
Robert Oliver;
 and hath been for sundry Descents, resident in that Name, though the Original Sirname be 
Quintin.
 They being Descended from 
Anselinus
 or 
Anselmus de Quintin,
 that paid respective Aid for the Mannor of 
Woodfold
 in 
Yalding,
 in the twentyeth year of 
Edward
 the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight. Now if you will know how the Name of 
Quintin
 resolved into that of 
Oliver,
 I shall inform you. 
William Quintin
 Purchased Lands in 
Seal
 called 
Hilks,
 the eleventh of 
February,
 and in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and in the Deed of Purchase, he is often called 
Filius Oliveri,
 without the Addition of 
Quintin,
 and so by vulgar acceptation, and inadvertency, they came by common mistake to be called 
Oliver;
 yet in all Deeds and other Escripts, to preserve their Ancient and Original Denomination, they write 
Oliver, alias Quintin.


Lidde,
 in old 
Saxon
 Records is written 
Hlida,
 which certainly was derived from the Latine word 
Litus;
 it importing as much in that Dialect, likewise, as the Shore, and the Situation of the place, being not far distant from the Sea; does seem to abett the Etymologie. It is Situated in the Hundred of 
Langport,
 which extracts its Name from a Mannor in this Parish, called 
Old Langport,
 which was the Possession of a Family whose Sirname was 
Ikin.
 And 
John Ikin
 I find by an Inquisition taken in the thirty second year of 
Edward
 the third, was at his Death, which was then, poss∣est of it. After 
Ikin,
 a good old Family called 
Hund,
 were Lords of the Inheri∣tance; and Sir 
John Hund
 who lies buried in the Church of 
Lidde,
 lived here in the Raign of 
Henry
 the sixth. From this Family it by Sale passed away to 
Belknap;
 in, which Name the Possession had not been long resident, for Sir 
Edward Belknap
 Son to Sir 
Henry Belknap,
 who Purchased this place, died without Issue, and so his three Sistrs 
Anne, Elizabeth,
 and 
Alice,
 became his three Co-heirs, who married to Sir 
Edward Wotton,
 Sir 
Philip Cooke
 of 
Giddy
-Hall, and Sir 
William Shelley
 of 
Michael∣grove
 in 
Sussex,
 who sold his proportionable Share in this Mannor to 
Dannett,
 and from 
Wotton
 and 
Dannett,
 two parts of it were afterwards conveyed away by Sale to 
Godfrey,
 and the third was alienated by 
Cooke,
 to Sir 
Christoph. Man
 of 
Canterbury.


New-Langport,
 called likewise 
Langport Septuans,
 was for many Descents the Patri∣mony of that Noble Family. 
Robert de Septuans
 held it at his Death, which was in the thirty third year of 
Henry
 the third, and after him his Grandchild 
William Septuans
 or 
de Septemvannis,
 was possest of it in the twenty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third, and so remained by the links of some Descents fastned to the Inheritance of this Family, till 
William Septuans
 this mans great Grandchild, by Sale translated his Right in it to 
John Writtle,
 about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth: where after the Possession had some years settled, it was by Sale supplanted, and Seated in 
Henry Fettiplace,
 of 
Beselslith,
 in the County of 
Oxford;
 where after it had for many years been fixed, it was at length sold from this Family, to 
James.
 But here it had a very short abode, for 
Thomas James
 falling under a 
praemunire,
 in the sixth year of the Raign of King 
James,
 forfeited it to the Crown, and that Prince the next year after, passed it away to 
John
 Lord 
Haddington;
 and he not long after, to discharge some Debts in which he was

engaged to Mr. 
Edward Cropley
 of 
London,
 passed it over to him for his Satisfaction and re-imbursment.


Jacks, alias Jaques-Court
 in this Parish, was the Demeasne of 
Echingham,
 a Family of principal Note in 
Sussex,
 where they were, 
Jure Nativo,
 Seneschalls of the Rape of 
Hastings,
 and of a proportionate Revenue at 
Echingham
 in that County. The first that I find of note in this place, was 
William de Echingham,
 who paid respective Aid, in the twentyeth year of 
Edward
 the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight, for Lands which he held here, and in 
Welland-Mersh,
 by the fourth part of a Knights Fee; and in this Family did it for sundry Ages reside, and was productive of men that were very usefull and subservient to the Interest of their Country, where∣of 
William Echingham,
 Son of the former 
William,
 was one of the Conservators of the Peace, for the County of 
Sussex,
 in the first year of 
Richard
 the second, and died possest of this place, in the fifteenth year of that Prince: But at length the Distaff prevailed against the Speare; for this Family concluded in a Female Heir; for 
Thomas Echingham
 dying without Issue-male, 
Margaret
 his only Daughter was married to 
Walter Blount,
 who had by her 
Jacks-Court,
 which he left to his Son 
Edw. Blount
 Lord 
Montjoy:
 but he at his Decease leaving no Issue, the Inheritance of this place, came to 
Elizabeth
 his Sister and Heir, married to Sir 
Andrew Windsor,
 afterwards created Lord 
Windsor
 by 
Henry
 the eighth, who alienated this Mansion to 
Clache,
 by whose Daughter and Heir, it came to be the Possession of 
Stringer;
 and he ending likewise in a Female Heir, she brought it to 
Scot,
 a Cadet of 
Scots-Hall;
 who sud∣denly after sold his Right in it to 
VVilcocks,
 by whose two Daughters and Coheirs, in the Memory of these Times, it came to be divided between their two Husbands 
Bates,
 and 
Knight.


The Mannor of 
Belgar
 or 
Belgrave
 is Situated likewise in 
Lidde,
 it was given with the Mannor of 
Bilsington,
 to the Priorie of 
Bilsington,
 by 
John Maunsell
 the Founder of it; and was exchanged by the Abbot and Canons for other Lands, not long be∣fore the Suppression, with 
VVilliam St. Leger,
 by whom it was alienated to 
VVilliam Middleton,
 and 
Edward Arthur,
 who after they had been some small time Seated in their new Acquists, by jont-consent passed away their Right in it to 
Sherley
 of 
Sussex,
 who in our Fathers Memorie, by Sale transferred the Inheritance to 
Abdy,
 descended from the 
Abdys
 of 
Abdy-House
 in the Parish of 
VVaith
 in 
Yorke-shire,
 whose Heir both to the Name and 
Belgar
 also, is Sir 
Christopher Abdy,
 a person who for his generall Knowledge, may be called without the circumstance of Flatterie, an Ex∣chequer of humane Learning.


Scotney
 was the Seat of a Family so called; for in the (Book of 
Aid
) there is a recitall of one 
Richard de Scotney,
 who held Lands in the 
Mersh
 not far distant: after∣wards it came to the 
Ashburnhams
 of 
Sussex,
 but whether by Purchase, or by Marriage of the Heir of 
Scotney,
 is incertain; though I rather believe it devolved to them by Marriage, because 
Scotney
 in 
Lamberhurst,
 divided by a remote distance from this place, was likewise theirs; from 
Roger Ashburnham
 it came to 
Henry Chichley
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and he by Gift tied it to his Foundation of 
All-Souls
 Colledge in 
Oxford,
 to whose Revenue it remains at this instant time united.


Nod
 in this Parish of 
Lidde,
 was for sundry Ages the Residence of the 
Derings,
 before they were transplanted to 
Pluckley,
 and here are Lands Situated within the Verge of this Parish, which by an undivided prescription of many Ages have been named 
Derings;
 and 
Derings-Mersh,
 (a certain Evidence to enforce the Antiquity of this Family.) But when they grew more delighted with the Situation of 
Pluck∣ley
 than this place, it was by ........ 
Dering,
 in the fourth year of 
Philip
 and 
Mary,
 alienated to Mr. 
Peter Godfrey
 of 
Lidde,
 and 
Surrenden
 was tyed for his peaceable Possession in it.


Lastly, here is 
Manerium Summi Altaris,
 so it is written in old Latine Deeds, or the Mannor of the 
high Altar,
 which for many Hundreds of years has been united to the Vicarage: But whether it were given to find Vestments for the Priest to Offo∣ciate in at the high Altar, or for a supply of wax Tapers, or for provision of Books to celebrate Mass with, or lastly, for all these Uses, united and complicated together, I know not, because the original Instrument which fortified the Donation is lost, and so both the Use and Doner are become incertain.




There was a Water in 
Lidde
 called 
Guestling,
 whose Course the Prior of 
Christ-Church
 did, by an Inquisition taken in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the second, con∣sult how to alter.


If you will discover what price was set on Timber, in elder times, an old Epi∣taph affixed to a Tomb-stone in 
Lidde
 Church, will represent it to you. The Inscrip∣tion Recorded in old 
English
 speaks thus. Of your Charity pray for the Soul of 
Tho. Briggs,
 who died on the Feast of St. 
Leonard
 the Confessor, the year of our Lord, 1442. and did doe make the Roffe of this Chirch, as far as 45. Copplings goeth, which did cost 45. Marks.


Lidden
 in the Hundreds of 
Folkstone
 and 
Bewsborough,
 was a Mannor which in elder Times made up that vast Patrimony which related to the Knights Templers in this County: but upon the totall Extirpation of that Order here in 
England,
 in the Raign of 
Edward
 the second, it was by the Statute called 
Statutum de Terris Tem∣plariorum,
 made in the seventeenth year of that Prince's Government, settled by that solemne Act upon the Knights Hospitalers, and remained treasured up in their Revenue, untill the Disbanding and finall Dissipation of this Order in this Nation, by 
Henry
 the eighth. And then being by that Prince rent away, it was in the thirty sixth year of the same Prince, granted to 
John Wilde
 Esq; for Life onely, and the Remainder in Fee, to the Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and his Successors for ever; in whose Patrimony according to the tenour of the original Concession, it lay invol∣ved untill that popular Tempest which arose in these Calamitous Times, shook it off, and cast it into a secular Interest.


Coclescombe,
 and 
Swinkfield-Mennes,
 were of the same Complexion with the for∣mer, that is, they were first enwrapped in the Demeasne of the Knights Templers, and afterwards supplanted, and fastned to the Revenue of the Knights Hospitalers, to whose Interest it continued firme, untill the Whirl-wind of the publique Sup∣pression in the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, ravished them away; and then that Prince in the thirty third year of his Raign, by Royall Concession, made them the Inheri∣tance of 
Edward Monins
 Esq; from whom, by Successive Devolution, they are now come down to his Descendant Sir 
Edward Monins
 of 
Waldershare,
 Baronet.


Swanton-Court
 is the last Place in this Parish, which Summons our Remembrance. It was (as appears by private Deeds, Muniments, and other Authentick Testimonies) the Seat and Habitation for severall Descents of a Family deeply rooted in this Track, whose Sirname was 
Greenford,
 and it is possible were originally extracted from a Mannor known by that Denomination in 
Middlesex:
 who after they had flourished by a large Decursion of Time, under a fair and unstained Estimate at this place, trans∣mitted the Proprietie of this Mansion to 
John Greenford
 Esquire, in whom this Fa∣mily found its Tombe and Period: for he dying without Issue-male, in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the fourth, 
Alice
 his Sole Daughter became his Heir, and She by matching with 
John Monins
 Esquire, linked this Seat to his Inheritance, and to this Family, and to his Descendants hath the Title ever since been so constantly wedded, that it hath suffered no Divorce, but remains at this instant united to the Patrimony of Sir 
Edw. Monins
 of 
Waldershare,
 Baronet.


Lyminge
 lies in the Hundred of 
Court-At-Street,
 and was anciently Famous for Land which was given here, by 
Edbaldus,
 Son of 
Ethelbert
 King 
Kent,
 to his Sister 
Edburga,
 upon which she erected a Nunnery, and Dedicated it to the Honour of St. 
Mildred:
 But the Mannor which belonged to it, was upon the Suppression, granted by 
Henry
 the eighth to the See of 
Canterbury:
 and Arch-Bishop 
Cranmer
 in the twenty ninth of that Prince's Government, exchanged it for other Lands with the Crown: and the above-said 
Henry
 the eighth, in the thirty sixth year of his Raign, granted it to Sir 
Anthony Aucher,
 who after, in the Rule of Queen 
Mary,
 was slain at 
Callis,
 whilst he endevoured to make good that City, and the 
English
 Interest together, by a noble and generous Resistance against the Furious Impressions and Onsets of the Duke of 
Guise,
 and the 
French
 Army, who then pressed upon it with a straight and vigorous Seige. But to go on: after this Place had continued in the Name, since the time of the first Concession, even till ours, it was lately by Sir

Anthony Aucher
 of 
Bourne,
 sold to Sir 
John Roberts
 of 
Canterbury.


East-Leigh
 was the Mansion of a Family which took their Denomination from hence; and there is mention in the Book of 
Aid,
 of 
William de Leigh,
 and 
Robert de Leigh,
 who held Land of the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 by Knights Service in the twentieth of 
Edward
 the third: when this Family was vanished, and had de∣serted the Possession of this place, which was about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the fourth; the 
Allens,
 who came from 
Borden
 and 
Sedingbourne,
 were ingrafted into the Inheritance, but enjoyed it not long: for in the Age subsequent to the first Pur∣chase, it was alienated to 
Fogge,
 who by as short and sudden a Vicissitude, disposed of his Right in it to 
Cobbe
 of 
Cobbes-court,
 not far distant, in which Family the Title was as brief, and as incertain, as in any of the former; for by them, after a Possession of some few years it was alienated to 
Salkeld
 descended originally from the 
Salkelds
 of the North-riding in 
York-shire
 and Bishoprick of 
Durham.


Sibeton
 vulgarly called 
Sibton
 and 
Sifton,
 is another Mannor which is contained within 
Lyminge.
 It was, of higher Calculation, the Patrimony of 
Tibetot,
 a Family of no mean Account, both in the Counties of 
Leicester
 and 
Nottingham.
 And 
Robert Tibetot
 was possest of it at his Death, which was in the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the third: but after this Man, I find no farther Remembrance of any of his Stock or Poste∣rity at this place, so that it seems his Son sold it to 
VValter Leigh,
 or at 
Leigh
 of 
East-Leigh
 in this Parish, who was likewise concerned in an Estate in 
Hertford∣shire,
 where he was conservator of the Peace, in the first year of 
Richard
 the second, and in this Family did it reside many years after: For 
Tho. Leigh
 held it in Possession at his Decease, which was in the seventeenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth: but after his Death it was passed away to 
Allen,
 where the Inheritance stayed not long; for from them it went away by Sale into the Patrimony of Sir 
Jo. Hales,
 who was Baron of the Exchequer in the raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, whose Posterity an Age or two since alienated their Interest here to 
Salkeld.


Limne
 in the Hundred of 
Street,
 in ancient Records written 
Limen,
 is improved into a high Estimate, from those many reliques and places of Antiquity, which lie scattered within the Limitts of it. And though now it carry with it an uncouth and desolate Aspect, yet it was more flourishing in elder Times, when Prince 
Edward
 Son to King 
Henry
 the third, (being then Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports) at this place exacted an Oath of Fidelity of the Barons of the same, to his Father, against the Maintainers of the Barons War. And at this Place, or some other member of the Franchise, to which the Court is adjourned from 
Shepway,
 the 
Limenarcha
 or Lord Warden, receiveth his Oath, at his first Entry into his Office.


Berewick
 in this Parish, was, upon the Suppression of the Priory of 
Christ-church
 by King 
Henry
 the eighth, re-enstated on the Arch-deacon of 
Canterbury,
 who had here a Castellated Mansion, long before that tempestuous Dissolution, seated upon the Brow of a Hill, and affording a delightful Prospect into 
France.
 The Pages of 
Dooms-day
 Book, represent it thus rated to us, in the twentieth of 
William
 the Conquerour.

Court at Street
 celebrates the Memory of the noble Family of 
Hadloe
 or 
Haudloe,
 who as is manifest by ancient Records, were, in Times of a very high Ascent, Lords of this Mannor.

 
Nicholas de Hadloe,
 had a Charter of Free-warren to all his Lands in 
Kent,
 and the Grant of a market weekly, and a Fair yearly to his Mannor of 
Court at Street
 in the forty first year of 
Henry
 the third. 
John de Hadloe
 is in the Register of those Kentish Knights, who accompanied 
Edward
 the first into 
Scotland;
 and, for his remarkable Service at the Seige of 
Carlaverock,
 was made Knight and Banneret by that Prince, in the twenty eighth year of his Raign. In the tenth year of 
Edward
 the second, a Licence or Patent was gran∣ted to 
John de Hadloe,
 and 
Mawd
 his Wife, to fortifie and embattle diverse Castles and Mannors in which this was couched. In the first year of 
Edward
 the third,

he was summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron, and left this Mansion thus so∣lemnly ennobled to 
Nicholas de Hadloe,
 in whom the Male-line expired, so that 
Alice
 one of his Daughters and Coheirs, upon the Partition of the Estate, brought this to be the Patrimony of 
John Colvill,
 and he in her Right held it at his De∣cease in the seventeenth year of 
R.
 2
d.
 as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 9. And from him did an uninterrupted Clew of paternal Succession, transport it to 
Edward Colvill
 Esquire, who in the thirty fifth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, alienated it by Sale to 
Edward Thwaits
 Esquire; and from him it did descend to 
Edward Thwaits,
 who in the eleventh year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 conveyed it by Sale to 
Edward Jackman,
 and in this Family did it reside, until that Time which fell within the Circle of our Fathers Remembrance; and then it was passed away to Sir 
William Hewett,
 who upon his Decease by Testament, setled it upon his third Son the instant Possessor Mr. 
Will. Hewet.


Bellaview, Otterpoole,
 and the Appendant Mannor of 
Wellop,
 are all circumscribed, within the Verge of 
Limne.
 The first of which, was both an eminent and ancient Seat of the 
Criolls,
 before they translated themselves to 
Ostenhanger,
 by matching with the Heir of 
Auberville;
 and the two last were wrapped up in that Revenue, which was as an Appendage both to support and enhaunce, the 
Grandeur
 of it, and went collectively together with 
Joan
 Daughter and Heir of 
Bertram de Crioll,
 to 
Richard de Rokesley,
 in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first, and remain∣ed with this Family, but untill the next Age; and the same Vicissitude carried them off, by 
Joan
 his Sole Inheritrix, to 
Thomas de Poynings,
 in which Name the Propriety resided untill the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the eighth; and then they devolved by Successive Descent to Sir 
Edw. Poynings:
 but he dying without any legiti∣mate Issue, and there being none of his Alliance, that could by any collateral Affinity, pretend any visible or manifest Title to the Estate, it devolved by escheat, in the four∣teenth year of that Prince, to the Crown, from which 
Bellavieu
 was again suddenly gran∣ted away to 
Rich. Bernys
 Esq; and he not long after disposed of it by Sale to 
Tho. Wombwell
 of 
Northfleet,
 who in the twenty fifth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, conveyed it to 
Peter Heyman
 Esquire, from whom, not long after, it went away to 
Bedingfield,
 descended from Gentlemen of a deep and ancient extraction in the County of 
Suffolk;
 and in this Family did it fixe, untill the Custome of Gavelkind having broken and split this Mannor into several parcels, and so made it the Inheritance of several Brothers, they by a joint Concurrence, alienated their collective Inte∣rest in it to Sir 
Edward Hales
 Knight and Baronet, Grandfather to Mr. 
Edward Hales,
 who now enjoyes the Fee-simple of it.


Otterpoole
 continued in the Crown, untill the thirty seventh year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was invested by Grant in Sir 
James Hales,
 from which Fa∣mily about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 it came over by Sale to 
Thomas Smith
 Esquire, commonly called 
Customer Smith,
 Ancestor to the right honorable 
Philip
 Viscount 
Strangford,
 the instant Lord of the Fee.


Wellop
 another parcel of the escheated Demeasne of 
Poynings,
 though it were granted in Lease to 
Knatchbull,
 and others, yet the Fee-simple still lodged in the Crown, untill K. 
Charles
 passed it away to Sir 
Edward Hales
 Knight and Baronet, from whom it is now by Descent devolved to his Grandchild Sir 
Edward Hales
 of 
Tunstall.


Lingsted
 lies in the Hundred of 
Tenham,
 and hath two places in it, of emi∣minent Reputation. The first is 
Bedmancore,
 which was in Times of a very high Ascent, wrapped up in the Patrimony of 
Cheyney,
 of whom I shall speak more at 
Patricksbourn Cheyney
 their principal Seat; the last of which Family that held it was 
William de Cheyney,
 who dyed possest of it, in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 58. But after his Decease it was not long re∣sident in this Name; for in the twenty seventh year of the abovesaid Prince, I find it in the Tenure of 
William de Apulderfield,
 of whose Family take this com∣pendious prospect. He was descended from

 
Henry de Apulderfield,
 of 
Apulderfield
 in 
Coudham,
 who with his Son 
Henry,
 are inserted in the Catalogue of those e∣minent 
Kentish
 Gentlemen who were engaged with 
Richard
 the first, at the Siege of 
Acon
 in 
Palestine.

 Henry de Apulderfield
 another of this Family accompanied

Henry
 the third, in his Expedition into 
Gascony,
 and his Son

 
Henry de Apulder∣field,
 with 
John de Lovetot,
 did by a Commission dated the fifteenth of 
Novem∣ber,
 in the sixteenth year of 
Edward
 the first, sit as Justices of the Sewers for 
Rom∣ney Mersh.
 And this 
Henry
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the twenty sixth, and twenty se∣venth of the abovesaid Prince, and had Issue 
William de Apulderfield
 the above∣mentioned Lord of 
Bedmancore,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the twenty seventh and twenty eighth of 
Edward
 the third, and again the thirty first, thirty fourth, thirty fifth, thirty sixth, thirty eighth, and fourty fourth years of the above men∣tioned Prince, and held his Shrievaltie at 
Lingsted. Henry Apulderfield
 his Son, was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the fifty first of 
Edward
 the third, in which that glorious Prince paid that Tribute to Nature we all owe; and from this Man, did 
Bedmancore
 des∣cend to his great Grandchild Sir 
William Apulderfield,
 a Man of very great Emi∣nence in the Raign of 
Henry
 the sixth, and 
Edward
 the fourth, who concluded in a Daughter and Heir called 
Elizabeth,
 matched to Sir 
John Phineux,
 Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench in the Raign of 
Henry
 the seventh, as is attested by his Monument in 
Hern
 Church, and he in her right became possest of 
Bedman∣core:
 but it was not long fastned to this Name, for this Man likewise concluded in two Female Coheirs, whereof 
Jane Phineux
 one of them, matched with 
John Roper
 Esquire; and 
Middred
 the other, wedded 
James Diggs
 of 
Diggs-court
 in 
Ber∣ham
 Esquire: from the first Alliance, 
Christopher
 now Lord 
Roper
 of 
Tenham,
 is lineally extracted, and, by Right of that Conjugal Union, is fortified in his present Possession and Title to this place.


Next to be remembred is 
Sewards,
 the Seat of a second Stock, of the well-spread Family of the 
Finches,
 ever since they married the Heir of place and Name, and after they had sprouted out into many fair Branches at 
Kingsdown, Norton, Selling,
 and other places; The Sole Heir of this House at 
Sewards,
 was married to Sir 
Drew Drury
 of 
Norfolke
 Knight, Gentleman Usher of the Privy Chamber to Q. 
Elizabeth,
 a Gentleman of incorrupt Integrity and Wisdome, to whom wee as∣cribe the building of the great House against the Church, where Mr. 
James Hugison
 kept his Shrievaltie, in the seventeenth year of the late King, having some years be∣fore purchased it of Sir 
Drew Drury
 his Heir.


Linton
 in the Hundred of 
Twyford,
 was anciently under the Jurisdiction and Signiory of Proprietaries called 
Capell,
 who had a Seat adopted into their Sirname, and called 
Capells-court;
 a Family certainly of great Antiquity, and no lesse Reve∣nue in this Track. 
John at Capell
 held Lands at 
Boxley
 called 
Tattelmell,
 in the thirty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third, as appears by that King's Charter of In∣spection, of the Foundation of 
Boxley
 Abbey, 
Cart.
 37. 
Memb.
 9. 
Thomas at Capell,
 and 
James at Capell,
 were to find two Hobelers or leight Horsmen at 
Denge
 Mersh in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the third. And in this Family did the Ti∣tle and Propriety of this place reside, untill the raign of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was passed away to 
Baesden;
 where, after it had for many years been permanent, it was almost in our Grand-fathers Remembrance transplanted by Sale into Sir 
An∣thony Mayney
 Knight, Grand-father to Sir 
Jo. Mayney
 Knight and Baronet, the in∣stant Lord of the Fee.


Some part of 
Linton
 did for many Descents relate to a Family called 
Welldish,
 who had here a Chappel called 
Welldish
 his Chappel, and bore upon their Seals ap∣pendant to ancient Deeds three 
Talbots passant,
 upon a 
Chiefe
 a 
Fox,
 in the same posture with the 
Talbots,
 which was assumed by this Family, as the vulgar and constant Tradition of this Parish asserts, to perpetuate, and inforce the Memory of one of their Ancestors, who was Huntsman to 
William
 the Conquerour. Fi∣nally after this Name had been fixed at this place, for so many Descents, a con∣siderable part of their Estate was in that Age wee name our Grand-fathers, passed away to 
VValter Mayney
 Esquire, from whom his Successor Sir 
Jo. Mayney
 now claims the Propriety of it.


Littlebourne
 in the Hundred of 
Downchamford,
 was many Hundred years since, given to the Church of 
Canterbury
 (as the Annalls of St. 
Angustins
 testifie) by

Withredus
 King of 
Kent.
 But here is the Mannor of 
Welle
 in this Parish, which was alwayes under the Jurisdiction of 
Lay
 Proprietaries. It was first the position of 
John de Welle,
 sometimes written 
At Well,
 from the position of his Dwelling, which perhaps was in a bottom: but this Man in the forty fourth year of 
Hen.
 the third, made 
Ranulph Joremer
 his Feoffe in Trust, who sold it for his Use to 
Reginald de Cornehill;
 by whose Daugh∣ter and Heir, it came to 
Garwinton
 of 
Beakesbourne,
 and in this Name after it had been fixed some four Descents, it went away to 
Haut;
 for 
William Garwinton
 died without Issue; and so 
Margaret
 his Kinswoman, matched to 
Richard Haute,
 who was a se∣cond stock of the 
Hauts
 of 
Bourne,
 became his Heir; but long the Right of it was not united to his Family; For 
Richard Haut
 this Mans Son, left likewise onely a Daughter and Heir called 
Margery,
 who altered the Possession, and brought it with Her to her Husband 
William Isaack,
 who had by her 
Edward Isaack,
 and he deter∣mined in two Daughters and Coheirs, 
Mary
 married to 
Thomas Apulton
 of 
Walding∣field
 in the County of 
Suffolk,
 and the other, first matched to ....... 
Sydley,
 and after to Sir 
Henry Palmer,
 who by Donation from his Wife, was endowed with the Fee-simple of 
Well Court,
 and his Successor in our Father's Memory, alienated it to Lievetenant Colonel 
Prude,
 slain at the Siege of 
Maestricht,
 who left it to his Son Mr. 
Searles Prude,
 whose two Daughters and Coheirs, are by his Will after his Wi∣dow's Decease entituled to the Inheritance.


Reginald de Cornehill
 in the forty fourth year of 
Henry
 the third, exchanged Lands with 
John de St. Leger,
 for Lands at 
Lukedale
 in 
Littlebourne,
 where he founded a Chan∣try, which was endowed with a new accession of Land by his Wife 
Matilda de Corne∣hill,
 and was confirmed by Patent from 
Henry
 the third.


Lose
 in the Hundred of 
Maidstone,
 was in old 
Saxon
 Records written 
Hlos:
 which imports as much as the Lot or Portion. It was, as the Book of 
Christ-Church
 informs us, given by 
Ethelwulf
 King of the 
South-Saxons
 to 
Sneta
 a Widow and her Daughter, and they gave it back again to the Monks of 
Christ-Church
 in 
Canterbury
 to apparel them. In the Conqueror's Time upon the general Survey recorded in 
Doonesday
-Book, it was accounted as part of the six Sullings of 
Ferneleigh.


Pimps Court
 that gave Name to the Knightly Family of the 
Pimps,
 is in this Parish, although they made 
Nettlested
 their more frequent place of abode; 
William de Pimpe
 held this and other Lands by a whole Knights Fee, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight: and from this 
William
 was 
John Pimpe
 Esquire, who was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the second year of 
Henry
 the seventh, lineally descended, who sold this Place to 
Edward Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham
 Lord Constable of 
England,
 whose dysastrous Fate having engaged him to make some dark Applications to a Wizard and a Monk, about the Succession of the Crown; 
Henry
 the eighth, a Prince of much Jelousie and Fury. like an Industrious Spider spun out Ve∣nome enough out of this unhappy Address of his, to poyson him with the Guilt of High Treason, and so made the forfeiture of his Life and Fortune pay the price of his Vanity: upon whose Ruine his Estate was, not long after his Death and Attaint, which was in the thirteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, by that Prince granted to his Confident and Favourite Sir 
John Rainsford,
 who after a brief enjoyment of it, passed it away to Sir 
Henry Isley,
 who being attainted in the second year of Q. 
Mary,
 for supporting by his Assistance and Concurrence the Defection of Sir 
Thomas Wiat
 this reverted to the Crown, and the same Princess in the second year of her Government, granted it by Patent to Sir 
John Baker,
 whose Successor Sir 
John Baker
 Baronet, hath lately passed it away to 
Thomas Floyd
 of 
Gore Court
 Esquire.


Luddenham
 in the Hundred of 
Middleton,
 with the appendant Mannor of 
Bishops-Bush,
 was a Branch of that spatious Revenue which did in these parts own the 
North∣woods
 for Possessors: and 
Roger de Northwood
 in the forty first year of 
Henry
 the third, amongst divers Parcels of Land which he altered from the Nature of Gavelkind into Knights Service, (of the which there is a particular Recapitulation in the Book of 
Aid
) changed ninety Acres of Mersh Land which lay partly in 
Iwade,
 and partly in his Mannor of 
Luddenham
 into that Tenure. After the 
Northwoods,
 the 
Frogenhalls
 were Possessors of this place, and 
William Frogenhall
 had this amongst other Lands in this

Track, which he died seised of, in the eighth year of 
Richard
 the second: his Son and Heir was 
William Frogenhall
 Father to 
Thomas Frogenhall
 the last of the Name at this Place; for he left no Issue Male: so that the Daughters became his Coheirs. One of whom was 
Anne,
 who married 
Thomas Quadring
 of 
London,
 and so this place be∣came hsi Inheritance, as being her Proportion of 
Frogenhalls
 Estate: but it quickly found an other owner; for 
Joan Quadring
 his onely Daughter and Heir, by marrying with 
Richard Dryland
 of 
Cokesditch
 in 
Feversham,
 incorporated it with the Demeasn of that Family: since which Alliance, it hath by a constant Succession been fixt in the Possession of the Name of 
Dryland;
 untill of late years by an Heir General, it came to own the Signory of 
Kirton.


Luddesdowne
 in the Hundred of 
Taltingtrough,
 was (though now a petty obscure Village) more noted formerly, when it was the Patrimony of the Barons 
Montchensie
 of 
Swanscamp-Castle. Warren de Montchensie,
 one of them, obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to this Mannor of 
Ludsdowne,
 in the thirty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third: afterwards this Mans Successor 
William de Monchensie
 held it, and sat in Parliament as Baron of 
Swanscamp,
 and dying in the year 1287, without Issue Male, left this and diverse other Places to 
Dionys
 his Sole Daughter and Heir, who was married to 
Hugh de Vere;
 but died without Issue, in the year of our Lord, 1314, by which means the Title of this Place diverted to 
Joan de Montchensie,
 Sister to 
William
 above-named, and She matched in Marriage with 
William de Valentia
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 half Brother to King 
Henry
 the third, and by him had 
Aymer de Valence,
 who expired in two Female Coheirs, one of whom called 
Isabel,
 was married to 
Lawrence de Hastings,
 who in her Right was afterwards Earl of 
Pembroke,
 and Proprietary of the Fee-simple of this Place; from whom it descended to his Grand-child 
John Hastings
 Earl of 
Pem∣broke,
 who dying in the fourteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, left his Estate in 
Kent,
 in which this was involved to his two Kinsmen, 
Reginald Grey,
 and 
Richard Talbot,
 and upon the Division of it, this Mannor was lincked to the Patrimony of 
Grey,
 and remained untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the fixth, interwoven with the Revenue of this Family, and then I find it under the Signory of that eminent Peer and glorious Souldier 
Thomas Montacute
 Earl of 
Salisbury,
 who in so many remarkable and trium∣phant Conflicts, asserted the Interest of this Nation in 
France,
 in the Raign of the a∣bovesaid Prince, and at last received a mortal Wound, by a Splinter of a Window struck into his Face by a Cannon shot at the Siege of 
Orleans,
 of which he died 1428, and left his Estate here to his Natural Son 
James Montacute,


 so written in the Deed, but in all our printed Books of Nobility falsly and corruptly 
John,
 and he in the thirtieth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, conveyed it by Deed to 
Thomas Davy
 Gentleman, and he not many years after alienated it to 
Edward Nevill
 Baron of 
Aburgavenny;
 from whom it was transported by Descent to his Successor 
Henry
 Lord 
Aburgavenny,
 who dying in the twenty ninth year of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 without Issue Male, gave it to his se∣cond Brother Sir 
Edward Nevill;
 from whom it is come down to his Descendant, 
John
 Lord 
Aburgavenny,
 the instant Proprietary of it.


Buckland
 in this Parish, did acknowledge the 
Bucklands
 for its Heirs and Possessors, who sometimes did inhabit at 
Preston
 in 
Shorham,
 and sometimes at this place; which however now obscure and despicable, was of Credit when Sir 
John Buckland
 paid re∣spective Aid for his Lands at 
Ludsdown,
 at the making of the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth of 
Edward
 the third; from 
Buckland
 by a Daughter and Heir, some few Ages since, it came over with 
Preston
 in 
Shorham,
 to 
Folhill,
 and in that Family is the Title still at this instant resident.


Lullingston
 in the Hundred of 
Axtan,
 was in ancient Records written 
Lullingston Rosse;
 for 
Anketellus Rosse
 held Lands here in the twentieth of 
William
 the Conqueror; 
William de Rosse
 this mans Grand-child (as appears by the Pipe Rolls) held two Knights Fees in 
Lullingston,
 in the first year of King 
John. Alexander de Rosse
 this mans Son was one of the 
Recognitores magnae Assisae,
 or of the grand Assise about the end of that Prince's Rule; but not long after this the Possession of this place was not lincked to this Family; for 
Lora de Rosse
 Sole Daughter to 
William de Rosse,
 by match∣ing with 
William de Peyforer,
 fastned it to the Revenue of that Stock, from whence it

assumed the Title of 
Lullingston Peyforer;
 but it quickly deserted both the Title and Possessor; for 
Gregory de Rokesley
 Lord Maior of 
London,
 in the seventh year of 
Edward
 the first purchased it of the abovesaid 
William,
 and in the same year obtained a Charter Warren to his Lands at this place. In the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
John de Rokesley
 Son to 
Walter Rokesley
 and Grand-child to the before mentioned 
Gregory,
 paid Aid for the Mannor of 
Lullingston,
 which held by a whole Knights Fee, at the making the Black Prince Knight; In the thirty third year of 
Edward
 the third, Sir 
John Peche
 purchased the Mannor of this 
John de Rokesley;
 this Sir 
John
 was Son to Sir 
John de Peche,
 who was Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Constable of 
Dover
 Castle, and was called to Parliament among the Barons, in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the third. In the same year he bought 
Lullingston,
 he obtained a Charter of Free Warren to his Lands there, which was renewed, and by Confirmation fortified in the thirty fourth and thirty fifth of 
Edward
 the third. Sir 
William Peche
 was his Son and Heir, whose Widow the Lady 
Joane Peche,
 who died seised of this Mannor, in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the fourth, lies entombed in St. 
Mary Woolnoth
 Church in 
London:
 Sir 
John Peche
 was Son and Heir to them both; Sir 
William Peche
 was Son and Heir to this Sir 
John,
 who died at 
Lullingston,
 1487, and had two Children Sir 
John Peche
 Knight and Banneret, who died 
sans
 Issue; (which Sir 
John,
 was a man of exemplary Account, being Lord Deputy of 
Calais,
 and of signal Charity, as is evident by his Munificence and Bounty towards the Poor; for he founded the Alms-Houses at 
Lullingston,
 and gave 500 
lb.
 to other Pious Uses, to be performed by the 
Grocers
 Company in 
London,
 of which he was Free:) and 
Elizabeth
 marched to 
John Hart
 Esquire, who in his Wife's Right, upon the Decease of her Brother, enter'd into the Possession of the Premisses; from whom it is transmitted to 
William Hart
 Esquire, his great Grand-child, who hath the instant Signory and Fee-simple of this Mannor of 
Lullingston.






M. M. M. M.


MAidstone
 giveth Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is seated: an elegant Town it is, whether we consider it in respect of the uniform and regular Building; or of the healthful Situation of it, spreading it self out partly upon a Hill, and partly upon a Valley; which are interlaced with a smal River which hath its Original about 
Leeds,
 and on the other side its Banks are washed with the waters of the Medway; from whence it primitively borrowed its Name, being in 
Saxon
 called 
Medwegston.
 The Places of most eminence which are circumscribed within the Limits of it are,


First 
Buckland,
 which is situated on the opposite Banck of the River, upon the Knob or Knoll of an Hill of easie Ascent; from whence it takes in, a various and de∣lightful Prospect of the adjacent Valley; It was anciently part of the Demeasn of the 
Bucklands;
 but whether it originally gave Seat and Sirname to them or not, is not evident; because there was another Place, which likewise bore this Name at 
Luddesdowne,
 and which also acknowledged it self to be Parcel of their Proprietie; 
John de Buckland
 held it at his Death, which was in the third year of 
Edward
 the third, and his Son and Heir was Sir 
John Buckland,
 who was a Person of remarkable Repu∣tation and Note in this Track; for he had Lands about 
Wouldham, Halling, Snodland, Ludsdowne
 and 
Shoreham,
 as well as at this Place. After this Name went out, the Lords 
Cobham
 were Proprietaries of 
Buckland,
 and in this Family was the Possession guided along by an undivided Clew of several Ages, till the infortunate 
Henry
 Lord 
Cobham,
 about the entrance into the Raign of King 
James,
 being with Sir 
VValter Raleigh
 and others, entangled in a Design, which the then present Power after a serious and solemn Debate adjudged treasonable, he could not unravel himself out of it, but with the Forfeiture though not of Life, yet of Estate; but this Mannor before his Attaint being settled upon his Lady 
Francis Cobham,
 as part of her Jointure, upon

his Decease was granted by the Crown to her, and the Reversion to 
Robert Cecil
 Earl of 
Salisbury,
 in respect he had married 
Elizabeth
 Daughter to 
William Brooke
 Lord 
Cobham,
 and Sister to this last Lord 
Henry,
 and She shortly after by marrying with ....... 
Fitz Gerald
 Earl of 
Kildare,
 settled the present Interest of it in him, and He and his Countess being embarked in a mutual and joint consent with the above∣mentioned Earl of 
Salisbury,
 passed away their Right in it, about the year One thou∣sand six hundred and eighteen, to 
William Horspoole
 Esquire, who, in the Memory of these Times, alienated the Fee-simple to Mr. 
English
 of 
Sussex.


Secondly, the Mannor of 
Maidstone
 it self with the Palace fall under Considera∣tion. They were in Times of elder Account belonging to the Family of 
Cornhill,
 and so continued till 
William de Cornhill
 desiring to exemplifie his Zeal and Devotion by some eminent Acts of Piety to the Religion which those Times asserted, gave them to 
Stephen Langton
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 in the seventh year of the Raign of King 
John;
 many of whose Successors were Benefactors both to the Church and Palace. 
Boniface
 of 
Savoy
 (Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury
) about four hundred years since, built here an Hospital, then styled the 
New-work,
 to the Honour of St. 
Peter,
 and 
Paul,
 and 
Thomas
 the Martyr; which Hospital 
William Courtney
 likewise Arch-Bishop pull'd down, and instituted a Colledge upon the Ruines of it; for secular Priests, devoted to the Honour of 
All Saints:
 And also erected the Collegiate Church, as the Walls, diaper'd in sundry places, with his paternal Coat, do easily evince.


John Ʋfford
 also Arch-Bishop about three hundred years since began the Founda∣tion of the Palace here; but dying before he had compleated the same, 
Simon Islip
 his Successor gave it its Perfection, and being afterwards crumbled into Decay, 
Iohn Morton
 likewise Arch-Bishop not onely repaired, but augmented it.


Maidston
 was governed by a Portreve, until the Time of King 
Edward
 the sixth: by whose incorporation it came to be governed by a Maior which Priviledge being lost, because this Town was enwrapped in Sir 
Thomas Wiats
 Insurrection, against Q. 
Mary;
 Q. 
Elizabeth
 not onely restored the same, but, to improve it to more eminence with a farther Addition of Honour, raised it into the Degree of a 
Borough.


Maidstone
 by the Influence of 
Boniface
 of 
Savoy,
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 had the Grant of a Market procured to be held here weekly on the 
Thursday,
 as is manifest, 
Pat.
 45. 
Hen. tertii Memb. secunda.


Thomas Arundel
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 about two hundred and forty years since erected a Chauntry, for the Brothers of 
Corpus Christi,
 now converted into the Free-School, who by the Rules of their Primitive Institution were to pray for the Fraternity of the Guild.


The Mannor and Palace of 
Maidston
 being exchanged with the Crown, by 
Thomas
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 was by K. 
Henry
 the eighth, about the thirty second year of his Raign, granted to 
Thomas Wiat
 the elder, and his infortunate Son Sir 
Thomas VViat
 being attainted in the second year of Queen 
Mary
 it devolved by Escheat to the Crown, and continued there untill Queen 
Elizabeth
 granted it to 
John Astley
 Esq; Master of the Royall Jewells, from whom it descended to Sir 
Jacob Astley,
 created Lord 
Astley,
 by the late King 
Charles
 at 
Oxford,
 in whose Descendants the Propriety is at this instant resident. But the Mannor continued in the Tenure of the Crown, even untill the Raign of King 
Charles.
 For when King 
James
 had by his gracious Charter created Dame 
Elizabeth Finch,
 Widow of Sir 
Moile Finch
 of 
Estwell,
 onely Daughter and Heir of the right Honourable Sir 
Thomas Heneage
 of 
Copped-hall
 in 
Essex
 Vice-Chamberlane, and one of the Privy Councel to Queen 
Elizabeth,
 Vice-Countesse 
Maidston,
 to her and her Issue-male, She obtained the Mannor in Fee Farme for ever, and transmitted it to her Son Sir 
Thomas Finch,
 in her Right Earl of 
VVin∣chelsey,
 from whom both the Title of Viscount 
Maidston
 and the Right of the Mannor are devolved by Paternal Succession, to the Right honourable 
Heneage Finch,
 the pre∣sent Earl of 
VVinchelsey,
 and Vicecount 
Maidston.


Leland
 notes that the Arch-Bishop's Palace, was anciently a Castle, and I verily believe it was the 
Caput Baroniae:
 for the Arch-Bishops had more than one, and ex∣cepting that at 
Saltwood,
 I have diligently Searched, and can find none so likely as this.


Goulds
 and 
Shepway
 do thirdly expose themselves to our Survey, they were former∣ly

the Demeasne of 
Vinter
 of 
Vinters,
 not far distant, and so remained till 
Robert Vin∣ter
 Founded in 
Maidston
 Church that Chantry, which bears the Name of 
Gould's
 Chantry, about the fortieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and then he annexed both these places to the Found
tion, for those Divine Offices which were there to be performed, but upon the Suppression of this Oratorie, King 
Henry
 the eighth granted 
Goulds
 and 
Shepway
 to Sir 
Thomas VViat,
 who afterwards sinking under the crime of High Treason, in the second year of the Government of Queen 
Mary,
 She upon his attaint, granted them to Sir 
VValter,
 and 
Gervas Henley
 Esq; from which Family by Purchase they came over to 
Andrews,
 but stayed not long there, for in our Fathers Memory they were sold to Sir 
Humphrey Tufton,
 late Sheriff of 
Kent,
 part of the year 1654. and part of the year 1655.


Bigons, alias Digons,
 was the ancient Seat of the worthy Family of the 
Mapelysdens,
 and I have a Deed in my Custody, wherein one 
Edward Mapelysden
 is mentioned, with this Addition, 
Edwardus Mapelysden de Digons.
 The Deed bears Date from the twenty fifth of 
Edward
 the third, and after the possession had been for many Genera∣tions Successively resident in this Family, one of this Name, being unfortunately concerned in the Defection of Sir 
Thoma; Wyat,
 was blasted with the guilt of High Treason, and so by Consequence his Estate by Confiscation, escheated to the Crown, from which it was granted to 
Nicholas Barham,
 after Serjeant at Law, who did much improve this Fabrick, with a Supplement of Building, from whose Heir it passed away by Sale to 
Hawle,
 and from him again soon after to Sir 
Francis Berneham,
 to whom this Mansion owes much of its Magnificence and Splendor, whose Son and Heir Mr. 
Edward Barneham
 Esquire, has lately alienated his Interest in it, to Mr. 
Beale
 of 
London.


Jordans-Court
 is a fifth place, which may exact our Notice, because it gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of that Denomination; the next Family, after this was expired, which held it, was 
Roper,
 of the 
Ropers
 of 
St. Dunstans
 in 
Canterbury;
 and 
John Roper
 sold it to 
Edw.
 and 
Wil. Brouch,
 of 
Bersted
 about the thirty sixth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and they quickly after alienated their Concernment to 
Atwood,
 from whom the same Fate, carried it away to 
Peirce,
 who by Sale transmitted his Right to 
Cook,
 and he suddenly after demised it to 
Crooke,
 where after the Title had made some short abode, the Possession was passed over to 
Potkins,
 extracted from the 
Fotkins
 of 
Sevenoke,
 where the Name was very ancient, from 
Potkin;
 by his Daughter and Coheir, it de∣scended to 
Virgo,
 who about the latter end of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 by Sale translated the Possession into 
Washington
 Justice of Peace, and often in the Commission of Sewers, who sold it to 
Godwin,
 from whom by Purchase, it came to be the Inheritance of 
Crisp,
 who in our Memory conveyed it away to 
Smith;
 and he, some few years since, by Sale, invested the Propriety in Mr. 
Beckman.


Sixthly, 
Sheals
 is not to be forgotten, because it was the Inheritance of 
Fremingham,
 for 
Ralph de Fremingham
 died seised of it, in the thirtieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and when this Family went out, the 
Pimps
 of 
Pimps-Court
 and 
Nettlested,
 by Purchase became Lords of the Fee; from whom the same Fare brought it to acknowledge the Signory of the 
Isleys
 of 
Sundrich;
 and here it continued, till Sir 
Henry Isley
 in the Raign of Q. 
Mary,
 being attainted of High Treason, it became Confiscated to the Crown, and She in the second year of her Government, granted it to Sir 
Walter Henley
 Knight, of 
Coursehorne
 in 
Cranbroke,
 in whose Name and posierity the Possession has remained Successively planted till this Day.


Seventhly, 
Chillington
 is not to be omitted, because I find it in the Register of those Lands which acknowledged the Lords 
Cobham,
 for Lords of the Fee: And when 
John de Cobham
 had obtained a Charter of Free-warren, in the seventeenth year of 
Edw.
 the third, to all his Lands in 
Kent,
 The Mannor of 
Chillington
 is Recorded in the Catalogue amongst them. After them, it came (as the Court-rolls and private Evi∣dences of this place inform me) to acknowledge the Signory and Jurisdiction of the 
Mapelysdens
 of 
Digons,
 and remained circumscribed in their Revenue, till Queen 
Mary
 began to weild the 
English
 Scepter, and then 
George Mapelysden
 being entangled beyond all retreat, in the unsuccessfull Expedition of Sir 
Thomas Wyat,
 miscarried in that Attempt, and lost his Estate by Forfeiture to the Crown, and Q. 
Mary
 granted it to Sir 
Walter,
 and 
Gervas Henley
 Esquire, who not long after sold his

Interest in it to 
Nicholas Barham
 Esquire, Serjeant at Law to Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and his Successor alienated this place to 
Hawle
 of 
Wye,
 whose Grandchild Mr. 
George Hawle
 lately deceased, held the Fee-simple of it.


Lastly, within the Ambute or Limits of 
Maidstone,
 stands an ancient Castellated House called the Moate. It did in times of great Antiquity, relate to that Patrimo∣ny which confessed the Signory of the noted Family of 
Leybourne:
 for 
Roger de Ley∣bourne
 obtained the Grant of a Market weekly on the 
Tuesday,
 and a Fair yearly to continue three Dayes at the Feast of St. 
Cross,
 in the fifty first year of 
Henry
 the third, as appears 
Pat.
 51. 
Hen. tertii Memb.
 10. But before the beginning of 
Edw.
 the third, this Name was withered and shrunk into Decay at this place, and then 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Burghurst,
 or 
Burwash,
 Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and one of the first Founders of the Order of the Garter, came to possesse it, and Inhabited here in the twenty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, and possessed the Signory called 
Shofford,
 on which the Castle stands, and which one 
John de Shofford
 held by Knights-Service, in the twentieth year (as appears by the Book of 
Aid,
) of 
Edward
 the third. After the Lords 
Burghurst,
 the 
Woodvills
 were possest of it, and removed from 
Grafton
 in the County of 
North-Hampton,
 where they had long continued, and lived here. A fair Monument of 
Woodvill,
 on the 
North
-side the Chancell of 
Maidstone
-Church affirms it: and when King 
Henry
 the sixth created 
Richard Woodvill
 Constable of the Isle of 
Wight,
 a Baron of this Nation, and elected him into the Order of the Garter, his Style was, Lord 
Rivers, Grafton,
 and 
De la Moat;
 which Act of Grace and Favour, mollifi∣ed a Sentence and Fine of 1000. 
lb.
 imposed upon him, for matching with 
Jaquet,
 Daughter of 
Peter
 of 
Luxenbourg,
 Earl of St. 
Paul,
 Widow of 
John Plantagente
 Duke of 
Bedford,
 without the Kings Licence. But when King 
Edward
 the fourth, had mar∣ried 
Elizabeth
 his eldest Daughter, being widow to 
Thomas
 Marquesse 
Dorcett,
 he cre∣ated him Earl 
Rivers,
 and Lord of the Isle of 
VVight,
 which Titles he had observed were concomitant in some of the Styles of the Lords 
Rivers,
 or 
de Ripariis,
 who were the Ancient Earls of 
Devon,
 and assumed to bear in an Escocheon of pretence upon his own Atchievement, the old Coat ascribed commonly to 
Baldwin de Ripariis
 Earl of 
Devon, viz. Gules a Griphen Segreant Or:
 which I note for Criticks in Armorie to descant on, and return to the Historie of the Place. When this good man, for so he was noted to be, was miserably massacred by 
Robert Ridisdale
 Captain of the Lewd People of 
North-Hampton
-shire, who took him at 
Edgcot-Field,
 and struck off his head at 
North-Hampton
 (Their Will being their Law, and Mischief Minister to their wild Designs?) all his seven Sons who survived him, died without Issue, and then Sir 
Henry VVyat
 becomes owner of this place, Grandfather to Sir 
Thomas VViat,
 afterwards his Successor in the Possession of it, whose dysastrous Tragedy is presented at 
Boxley,
 upon whose untimely 
Exit, Hugh VVarham
 in the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 by Grant from the Crown, enters upon it, from whom Alderman 
Rither
 afterwards Lord Maior of 
London,
 and known by the Name of Sir 
VVilliam Rither,
 Purchased and Repaired it and left it to his Daughter and Coheir, the Lady 
Susan Caesar,
 whose eldest Son 
Tho. Caesar
 Esq; and his Mother concurring together, disposed of their Right in it by Sale to Sir 
Humphrey Tufton
 Knight, second Son to Sir 
John Tufton
 Knight and Baronet, and Bro∣ther to 
Nicholas Tufton
 Earl of 
Thanett,
 who was Father to 
John
 the present Earl.


There was a Family Sirnamed 
de Maidstone,
 whose Blazon upon a Monument in 
Ʋlcombe
 Church is, 
Sables a Cheveron between three Cups, covered, Argent Crowned Or, VVilliam de Maidston
 the Kings Valect, being sent to the Court of 
Rome
 with certain Instruments, and other expresses, deceas'd in his Journey, as appears 
Pat. Anno, quinto Edwardi primi, prima Pars.


Pinenden-Heath
 confines upon 
Maidston,
 and is eminent for the Punishment of Ma∣lefactors, and the frequent Assemblies of Free-holders, who here convene to elect such Persons for Knights of the Shire, as may represent the County in Parliament. But it was in elder times more famous for that great Convention of 
English
 and 
Normans,
 who met there in the fourth year of 
Wil.
 the Conquerour, to decide the great Controversie which then broke forth, between 
Lanfranc
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and 
Odo
 Earl of 
Kent,
 touching some Lands and Priviledges which the said Arch-Bishop alleaged were by an unjust Usurpation by the above-said 
Odo
 ravished away from the Church: which be∣cause it gives us a full Prospect of that exorbitant and wide power which the Clergie of

those times did entitle themselves to. I shall endevour to pourtray it in as Brief and narrow a Landskip, as I have pencill'd it out by 
Textus Roffensis,
 an old Book in Manuscript so called, where it is more voluminously represented.


At 
Pinenden-Heath
 (says 
Textus Roffensis
) in the fourth year of 
William
 the Con∣querour, there was an Assemblie of the gravest and discreetest of the 
English
 and 
Normans,
 by a signall Decision and Debate, to deternine of that Controversie, which did formerly arise between 
Odo
 Bishop of 
Bayeux,
 and Earl of 
Kent,
 touching some Lands and Priveledges which were detained from the Church by the said Earl; and 
Lanfranc
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury.
 The said Dispute or Debate lasted three Dayes: after the expiration of which, the said Arch-Bishop recovered severall Lands which he the said 
Odo
 and his Tenants then held, which were 
Herbert
 the Son of 
Ivo, Turold
 of 
Rochester, Ralph de Curva-Spina,
 and 
Hugh de Montfort,
 with all the Franchises belonging to them, as namely, 
Sac
 and 
Soc, Toll
 and 
Theam, Infangtheof
 and 
Outfang∣theof, Flymena, Firmth, Grithbreach, Forestall, Heinfare,
 and 
Cersett;
 (the last of which, because none of our Interpreters of the dark and obscure Terms of the Law do ex∣plain, I shall; It was a Rent-charge of a certain Proportion of Corn in the ear, paid at the Feast of St. 
Martin,
) with all other Customes greater or less, both on the Land and on the Water; and it was tried and proved by all the honest and wise Men both 
Normans
 and 
English
 who were present, that as the King himself, holds his Lands quiet, and free in his Demeasne, so the Arch-Bishop holds all his Lands whoily quiet and free in his Demeasne. In the presence of these, it was shewn by many and most evident Reasons, that the King hath no Customes in the Church of 
Canterbury,
 but onely three, which are these. If any man digg in the Kings High-way, or cut down any Tree to stop it, if any man shall be apprehended and found Culpable, whilest they are in doing such things, whether Pledges be taken of them or not, yet by prose∣cution of the Kings Officer, and by Pledges they shall amend what is unjustly done. The third Custome is, If any man commit Blood-shed on the Kings High-way; if whilst he does it he be apprehended and imprisoned, he shall then make amends unto the King: But if he shall not be apprehended, but depart without giving any Pledge, the King may not in Justice require any thing of him. And it was at the same time farther determined, that if any Person did commit Blood-shed, or Manslaughter, in places which were within the Liberties of the Church of 
Canterbury,
 from the time that the Church left off to Sing 
Alleluiah,
 to the Octaves of 
Easter;
 that then he should make amends onely to the Arch-Bishop. And it was likewise shewed at the same Time, that whosoever should commit the Crime of Childwitt, that is, of Ba∣stardy; if it were in Lent, the Arch-Bishop should have the whole Satisfaction; but if out of Lent, then he should have onely half of it.


There were present at this Assembly, 
Goisfrid
 Bishop of 
Constance
 the Kings Sub∣stitute, 
Ernost
 Bishop of 
Rochester, Egelric
 or 
Agelric
 Bishop of 
Selsey
 and 
Chi∣chester,
 a Man of deep insight in the Constitutions Ecclesiastical, and of so great an Age, that he was brought in a Wagon, for his Discussion and Declaration, (says 
Textus Roffensis
) upon the known Laws, Usages, Franchises, and Customes of Holy Church. 
Hugh de Montfort, William de Arces, Richard de Tunbridge;
 and lastly, 
Haymo.
 Sheriff of 
Kent.


Town Malling
 and 
East Malling
 lie in the Hundred of 
Larkfield,
 and were both Mannors which related to that Revenue, which made up the Patrimony of the Nunnery of 
Town Malling,
 which was founded by 
Gundulphus
 Bishop of 
Ro∣chester,
 about the year 1090, and dedicated to the Virgin 
Mary,
 and had the Church it self which was likewise named after the blessed Virgin, and the Chappel of St. 
Leonards
 not far distant. Though this 
Gundulphus
 was the Founder, yet 
Haimo de Heath,
 as appears by the Records of 
Rochester,
 aws an eminent Benefactor to it about the year 1339. Both these Mannors upon the Suppression having aug∣mented the Revenue of the Crown, they rested there, untill the fourth year of 
Edward
 the sixth, and then they were granted in Lease for Life, to Sir 
Hugh Cartwright,
 and upon his Decease, they were passed away upon the same Condi∣tion to 
Pierpoint;
 and he conveyed them to 
William Brook
 Lord 
Cobham;
 whose Son 
Henry
 Lord 
Cobham,
 being attainted in the second year of King 
James,
 they were

re-assumed by the Crown, and after granted in Lease, to Sir 
Humphrey Delind,
 a Man fur∣nished with a liberal stock both of divine and humane Learning; and he passed away his Interest to Sir 
Robert Brett:
 but the Fee-simple continued with the Crown, until the twenty first of King 
James;
 and then they were granted for ever to 
John Rayney
 Esquire, which Concession was fully ratified by King 
Charles,
 (to whom the Pro∣fits of these Mannors were assigned when he was Prince, towards the Support of of his Court) in the second year of his Raign, to Sir 
John Rayney
 now of 
Wrotham
 Knight and Baronet, which Sir 
John
 is lineally descended from 
John Reignie
 (for so the Name in old Deeds is written) who held the Mannor of 
Edgeford
 in 
De∣von,
 and 
Smitheley-hall
 in 
York-shire,
 in the Raign of 
Edward
 the third, still the Possession of this Family. Which 
John
 was originally extracted from Sir 
John de Reignie,
 who, as is manifest by the old Rolls and Registers of this Family, held the Mannor of 
Newton
 in 
Cumberland,
 in the raign of 
Henry
 the third.


West-Malling
 had a Market granted to it on the 
Saturday
 by 
Henry
 the third, at the Instance of the Lady Abbesse of that place: to whom and to the Nuns of this Cloister, the Vicar of 
East-Malling,
 was, 
Jure Loci,
 always Confessor.


Parrocks
 and 
Ewell
 are two appendant Mannors, involved in the Mannor of 
West-Malling,
 whose Fee-simple was passed away to 
John Rayney
 Esquire, when the o∣ther was linked by Grant to his Demeasne,

 the last of which lay in 
Brenchley,
 and was in Lease many years from the Nunnery to 
Hextall,
 whose Female Heir brought it to 
VVhetenhall;
 and Sir 
Richard VVhetenhall,
 in the twelfth year of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 sold it to 
George
 Lord 
Cobham,
 and his Son 
Henry
 Lord 
Cobham,
 alie∣nated it to Sir 
Thomas Fane
 Ancestor to 
Mildmay
 Earl of 
VVestmerland:
 whose Lease being lately expired, it is now come to confesse Sir 
John Reyney
 Knight and Baronet, for sole Proprietarie.


Borough
 Court in 
East-Malling,
 was parcell of the ancient Demease of the no∣ble Family of 
Colepeper
 of 
Preston
 in 
Alre
ford
 and was found united to their Revenue, at the Death of 
VValter Colepeper
 Esquire, which was in the first year of 
Edward
 the third; and in this Family did it continue involved for sundry Ages, till all∣most in our Grand-fathers memory, it was by Sale conveyed away to 
Shakerley,
 descended from the 
Shakerleys
 of 
Shakerley
 in 
Lancashire:
 but it made no long a∣boad here, for in the Age subsequent to that wherein it was purchased, this Fa∣mily resolved into a Daughter and Heir, who was matched to 
Beauley,
 descended from the 
Beauleys
 of 
Beauleys
 Court in 
VVouldham,
 who brought 
Borough
 Court a∣long with her, into the Possession of that Family, and left it to her only Daughter and Heir 
Mary Beauley,
 who by matching lately with Mr....... 
Basse
 of 
Suffolk,
 hath made it parcel of his Interest and Propriety.


Marden
 is not parcell only of the Hundred of 
Middleton
 or 
Milton,
 but an Ap∣pendage of the Mannor also: but because they are divided by so remote a distance, from the above-mentioned place, they in elder Times made their Applications, by humble Addresses to the Crown, of whose Revenue this Parish was a Limb, to rescue them from that Burden, which crushed the shoulder, and to permit that this Parish. 
Suo integro Dominio, & Jurisdictione complecterctur,
 might be circumscribed within the Sphere and Circumference of its own Signiory, without any adherence or Con∣nexion to any other: but it seems the Beams of majesty, not beating with any propitious Influence on this Design, it grew not up to that Stature, and perfecti∣on, it did first aspire to; so that it remained an imperfect Moiety of a Mannor, under which Notion it is represented to us at present. Yet, in the ninth year of 
Edw.
 the first, 
Eleanor
 Wife to that Prince, obtained a Market weekly, and a Fair yearly, to be observed at this place, and being improved with these advantageous Fran∣chises, it remained marshalled in the Inventory of the Royal Demeasne, untill the second year of King 
James,
 and then it was passed away by Grant to 
Philip
 then Earl of 
Mout Gomery,
 upon whose late Decease it was disposed by Will to own the Interest of his second Son Mr. 
James. Herbert.


Cheveney,
 and 
Cheveney House,
 are both within the Verge of 
Marden,
 and were entituled to a Family of that Sirname. 
Henry de Cheveney
 held it at his Death, which was in the second year of 
Edward
 the second 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 59. And af∣ter

him 
Joan
 the Wife of 
John Cheveney
 his Son was in Enjoyment of it at her De∣cease, which was in the thirty second year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 5. But after this I find no farther Remembrance of this Family at this Place; for in the second year of 
Richard
 the second, I discover by an ancient Court-Roll, one 
William Atweld
 to have held the Propriety of it: And in this Family was the Title lodged until the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was transmitted by Sale to 
Couper,
 and in the thirteenth year of that Monarch, I find one 
William Couper,
 to have discharged some Persons of some Amerciaments, and Fines imposed upon them for not perform∣ing Suite and Service at this Mannor of 
Cheveney:
 and in this Family was the Interest successively resident, until the Beginning of Q. 
Mary,
 and then this House and Mannor being by the Custome of Gavelkind ground into two Parcels, and those possest by two Brothers Coheirs, one of them passed away 
Cheveney
 House to 
Ma∣plesden,
 in which name it is yet constant, and the other alienated the Mannor of 
Che∣veny
 to 
Lone;
 from whom Mr. ....... 
Lone
 the instant Proprietary is lineally ex∣tracted


Sipherst
 is another little Mannor in 
Marden,
 which had Possessors here of that Sirname, until the latter End of 
Edward
 the third, and then they being abolished and the Fee-simple abandoned and surrendred to 
William Atweld,
 about the second year of 
Richard
 the second, that Name was entituled to the Estate here, until the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was alienated with 
Cheveney
 to 
Couper,
 in whom the Fee-simple had not been long constant, when it was demised to 
John Field,
 and he made his Will in the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, and gives it to his Son 
Jo. Field,
 and from him did it by descendant Right devolve to his Suc∣cessor 
Edward Field,
 who held it the fourth year of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and after gave it to his Kinsman 
Thomas Gilbert,
 whose Successor 
Thomas Gilbert
 having settled it on his Widow 
Sibil Gilbert,
 it is now in her Right possest by her second Husband Mr. 
Richard Knight.


Tildens Stubbins,
 and 
Brooke,
 are three other inconsiderable Mannors in this Pa∣rish: which had three owners of these Denominations, the first of which were Persons of Eminence in this County, and had an Estate at 
Wye. Catts place
 in 
Brench∣ley
 and at 
Tilmanston
 likewise, as it appears by the Book of 
Aid,
 where there is an Assessement laid upon the Lands of 
William Tilden,
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at making the Black Prince Knight: But to proceed, the Propriety of these three Places, were constantly under the Dominion of these three Families until the latter End of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then 
Stubbins
 was passed away to 
Tilden,
 in whom both 
Stubbins
 and 
Tildens
 remained combined and wound up together, until the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then they were demised to 
Thomas Stidolfe
 Esquire, and he made his Will in the year 1453, and therein mentions 
Stubbins
 and 
Tildens
 to have been purchased of 
Tilden
 and 
Brooke
 of 
Richard Brooke:
 but this Family about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, determining in a Female Inheritrix (matched to 
Richard Vane
 Esquire) united these three Mannors to his Patrimony, and from him by the traverses of several Descents, are they now come down to be possest by the right Honourable 
Mildmay Vane
 Earl of 
Westmerland.


Monkton
 is a Mannor in 
Marden,
 which made up the Demeasn of the Priory of 
Leeds,
 and upon the suppression of that Cloister, was by K. 
Henry
 the eighth, granted to 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bedgebury
 Esquire, who not long after alienated it to 
Thomas Wilfor'd
 Esquire, and he in the seventh year of Q. 
Elizabeth
 to 
Thomas Stanley;
 in which Family it remained, until our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was demised by Sale to Mr. ...... 
Board
 of 
Sussex.


St. Mary Church
 in 
Romney Mersh,
 lies in the Hundreds of 
St. Martins
 and 
New-Church,
 and was anciently folded up in that large Demeasn which did acknowledge the Dominion of the 
Criolls; John de Crioll
 or 
Keriel
 of a younger Extraction from 
Bertram de Crioll
 held it at his Death, which was in the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, and transmitted it to his Son Sir 
Nicholas Criol;
 from whom by a continued Succession, it devolved to Sir 
Thomas Crioll
 Knight of the Garter, who falling an Oblation at the Battle of St. 
Albans,
 to the Cause and Quarrel of the House of 
York,
 by his Daughter and Heir it came to be the Inheritance of 
John Fogge


Esquire, who left it to his Son 
Thomas Fogge:
 and though he determined in two Daughters and Coheirs, 
Alice
 matched to 
William Scot,
 and 
Anne
 first married to 
Edward Scot,
 and after to 
Henry Isham,
 yet it seems (to improve and continue the Name) he gave this and other Lands to his Kinsman 
George Fogge,
 whose Posterity enjoyed it even until our Fathers Memory, and then it was alienated to 
Carkeredge.


St. Maries
 in the Hundred of 
Hoo,
 was (as appears by Sir 
Thomas Wisemans
 Evi∣dences, for I can trace not any Notice of it in Publick Records) in the Raign of 
Edw.
 the fourth, (for no higher do the Deeds arrive at) in the Hands of one 
William Halton,
 who sold the same to 
William Lemyng
 Citizen and Grocer of 
London,
 as appears by a Deed dated the twenty second day of 
October,
 in the eighth year of the said King's Raign. Afterwards I find this abovesaid Mannor in the Hands of Sir 
John Brooke
 Lord 
Cobham,
 in the Raign of 
Henry
 the seventh; but from whom it came to him the E∣vidences do not discover: but I find, that in the seventh year of that King's Raign, the said Lord 
Cobham
 sold the abovesaid Mannor to Sir 
Robert Reade,
 then Serjeant at Law, but after Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; who concluding in three Daughters and Coheirs; 
Dorothy
 matched to Sir 
Edward Wotten
 of 
Boughton Mal∣herbe; Katharin
 wedded to Sir 
Thomas Willoughbie
 second Son of 
Christopher Willoughbie
 Lord 
Willoughbie
 of 
Eresbye;
 and 
Margaret
 married to Sir 
Iohn Harcourt
 of 
Elnal,
 in the County of 
Stafford,
 this Mannor of 
St. Maries
 in her right, descending to this Family, the abovesaid Sir 
Iohn
 and the Lady 
Margaret
 his Wise, did, in the thirtieth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, exchange the said Mannor of 
St. Mary Hall
 with 
Iohn Wiseman
 Gentleman, for the Priory of 
Ronton,
 in the County of 
Stafford:
 since which Time the said Mannor hath continued in the Name of 
Wiseman,
 and is at this instant in the Possession of Sir 
Thomas Wiseman
 of 
Riven Hall,
 in the County of 
Essex,
 Knight.


Newland
 is a Mannor Situated in 
St. Maries,
 which was, as high as can be traced, by any Track of Evidence, the Inheritance of 
Somer,
 vulgarly now called 
Somers. Richard le Somer
 made his Will, as appears by the Records of 
Rochester,
 in the year of 
Grace
 1347, and died seised of this Place, Lands in 
Halstow, Higham, Leigh,
 and else∣where, and from him did it come down by the Channel of Descent to 
John Somer,
 who was Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the Raign of 
Henry
 the sixth, who was a great Benefactor to the Priory of 
Christ-Church,
 in whose Cloister the Armes of this Fa∣mily remain insculped in Stone as a Memorial of his Beneficence, the last of this Fa∣mily who held this place, was Sir 
William Somer,
 who was thrice employed as publick Embassador to forraign States by Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and he deceased without Issue Male, so that his two Daughters matched to Sir 
Alexander Temple,
 and Sir 
James Cromer
 became his Coheirs; but this Mannor of 
Newland
 upon the Petition was united to the Demeasn of 
Temple,
 whose Heir hath lately passed it away to the Treasurers of the Chest, for sick and mained Seamen at 
Chetham.


Mershham
 in the Hundred of 
Chart
 and 
Longbridge,
 was given by 
Siward
 and 
Mawde
 his Wife to the Monks of St. 
Augustins
 for support of their Diet, which Concession of their's, was afterwards confirmed (as appears by the Book of 
Christ-Church
) by the Royal Authority of 
Edward
 the Confessor, and so remained wrapped up in the Demeasn of the Church till the Dissolution of that Covent, and then it fell into the Revenue of the Crown; and King 
Henry
 the eighth, in the thirty third year of his Raign, settled it on the newly erected Dean and Chapter of 
Canter∣bury.


Quatherington
 in this Parish, vulgarly called 
Quarington,
 was the ancient Residence of the 
Blechendens,
 till 
William Blechenden
 by marriage with 
Agnes
 Daughter and Co∣heir of ....... 
Godfrey
 of 
Aldington
 became in her Right, Master of 
Simnells
 in that Parish, and so left his Habitation at 
Mersham,
 to enjoy his new Acquists at 
Aldington;
 certainly they were very anciently Seated if not at this place, yet in this Parish, for I have seen the draught of a Pedigree knit together by 
Clarenceux Cooke,
 wherein they are brought down from 
Nicholas de Blechenden,
 who flourished here at 
Mersham
 in the Raign of 
Edward
 the first; though I confesse the Evidences of 
Quarington
 reach no higher then 
Will. Blechenden
 who is made in the Pedigree, to be Grand∣child to the abovesaid 
Nicholas,
 and who flourished in the Raign of 
Richard


the second after the 
Blechendens,
 the 
Cleggates
 of 
Canterbury
 became in our Grand∣fathers Memory, to be Lords of the Fee; but not long after alienated their Right in it to 
Eastday
 of 
Saltwood,
 from whom the like Current of Succession w
fted it over to 
Knatchbull,
 from whom the Right descended to Sir 
Norton Knatchbull,
 a Person who for his Favour and Love to Learning and Antiquitie, in Times when they are both fallen under such Cheapness and Contempt, cannot be mentioned without an Epithete equivalent to so just a merit.


Mepeham
 in the Hundred of 
Totingtrough,
 was given to the Monks of 
Canterbury,
 for their supply of Dyet by 
Ediva
 the Queen, Mother of the two Kings, 
Edmund,
 and 
Eadred,
 (as appears by the Book of 
Christ-Church
) in the year of 
Grace
 861. Upon the suppression of that Fraternitie, it increased by its Addition, the Revenue of the Crown; but it was suddenly after in the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, restored to the Church, and so continued till these infortunate Times chained it to the Patri∣mony of the See of 
Canterbury,
 whose Arch-Bishops it seems had a speciall Regard to this place: for 
William Courtney
 one of them, re-builded the Church, which by the On∣sets of Time was shrunk into Dilapidation and Rubbish, and erected likewise some Alms Houses here for the support and maintainance of the poor of this Parish.


The Mannor of 
Dodmore
 lies within the Circuit of 
Mepeham,
 and was, as high as the Beam of any Deed can discover to me, the Possession of the noble and Knightly Family of 
Huntingfield.
 Sir 
Peter Huntingfield
 by his Deed 
sans
 Date does demise it to his kinsman 
Walter Huntingfield,
 and he by Deed likewise without any Date affixed to it passed it away to 
John Smith,
 and he in the forty seventh year of 
Edward
 the third, conveyed his Right in it by Sale to 
Richard Ideleigh,
 from whom the 
Ideleighs
 of 
Easture
 in 
Chilham,
 and 
Rollingin
 at 
Goodneston
 in 
East-Kent
 originally branched out. But here the private Muniments of this place, by whose Light I have walked, break off; so that I must make a Gap in my Intelligence, and skip into the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth. In the ninth year of whose Government, I find by the Court-Rolls of this place, one 
Thomas Cavendish
 Esq; to be possest of it, from whom about the second year of 
Edward
 the sixth it went away to 
Henry Taylor,
 afterwards within the Circuit of thirty years; it was the Possession of 
John Giffard,
 then of 
Walter Powre
 of 
Brench∣ley,
 and after him, of 
Henry Collins,
 who in the year 1604. demised his Interest in it to 
Walter Kipping
 Gentleman, of 
Kippings-Cross
 in 
Tuydley,
 where they were resident before about five hundred year; and now it is made by 
Dorothy Kipping
 his Daughter and Coheir, part of the Patrimony of my Worthy and Ingenuous Friend 
Edward Darrell
 Esquire.


Dean-Court
 is likewise Seated within the Verge of 
Mepeham:
 It was in elder times a Branch of that wide and opulent Estate which was marshal'd under the Signory of 
Twitham. Alan de Twitham
 is enrolled in the Catalogue of those 
Kentish
 Gentle∣men who were with 
Richard
 the first at the Seige of 
Acon. Bethram de Twitham
 held it at his Death, which was in the third year of 
Edward
 the third, after 
Alanus de Twi∣tham
 died seised of it in the twenty fifth year of the above-said Kings Raign, and his Son 
Theobald de Twitham
 after him enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the fourth year of 
Richard
 the second, as appears by the Escheat Roll of that year, marked with the Number 76. and left 
Mawde de Twitham
 heir to his large Possessions in this Coun∣ty, who by marrying with 
Simon Septuans
 of 
Checquer
 in 
Ash
 by 
Sandwich,
 invested him not only in the Signory of 
Dean-Court,
 but likewise in his other Demeasne which lay dispersed in severall Branches over this County, and he had Issue by her, Sir 
William Septuans,
 who matched with 
Anne
 Daughter and Heir of Sir 
Nicholas Sandwich,
 and had Issue by her 
John Septuans
 Esquire, who likewise wedded 
Constance
 Daughter and Heir of 
Thomas Ellys
 of 
Sandwich,
 and had Issue by her 
John
 his eldest Son, to whom he gave 
Hells, Twitham, Chilton, Molands
 in 
Ash,
 and other Lands in 
Kent; Thomas
 his second Son who had 
Dean-Court
 in 
Mepeham,
 and other Lands in this County; and 
Gilbert Septuans
 his third Son who had his Mannor of 
Chequer
 in 
Ash
 above-said, and from them it is sometimes writ 
At Chequer,
 and afterwards 
Harfleet,
 for some eminent Service by him performed at a Town of that Name in 
Normandy,
 (as the private Evi∣dences of this Family do seem to insinuate) under the conduct of 
Henry
 the fifth, and so Successively by Custome and Prescription, this Name became hereditary to all of

the Name of 
Septuans,
 who were either directly or Collaterally linked in Alliance to this 
Gilbert.
 And in the Name of 
Harfleet alias Septuans,
 did the Inheritance of this Mannor of 
Dean-Court
 sundry Ages reside, till some few years since, it was by one of this Name, alienated to Mr. 
Francis Twisden
 third Brother to Sir 
Roger Twisden
 of 
Roy∣don
-Hall, Knight and Baronet.


Merworth
 stands in the Hundred of 
Littlefield,
 and gave Seat and Sirname to a wor∣thy Family of Gentlemen, whose Ancestor branched out from a Family called St. 
Laurence. William de Merworth
 is in the Register of those 
Kentish
 Knights who were embarked with 
Richard
 the first, at the Seige of 
Acon,
 upon which it is probable the Crosse Corslets were taken into the paternall Coat of this Family. In the fifteenth year of King 
John,
 one 
Roger,
 the Son of 
Eustace de Merworth,
 brought a 
Quare Impedit
 against the Prior of 
Leeds,
 for the Adyouson of the Church of 
Merworth; Roger de Merworth
 obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of 
Merworth,
 in the eigh∣teenth year of 
Edward
 the first. In the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, (as appears by the Book of 
Aid) John de Merworth
 paid respective Aid for a whole Knight's Fee at 
Merworth
 and 
Crombery
 in 
Hadloe,
 which he held of the Earl of 
Glo∣cester,
 at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and an Inquisition taken after this mans Death, for his Mannor of 
Merworth,
 (though the Inquisition for his Mannor of 
Maplescombe
 and other Lands, was not taken untill the forty ninth of 
Edward
 the third) finds 
John Malmains
 of 
Malmains
 in 
Pluckley,
 to be his Heir, who in the forty sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, sells it to 
Humphrey Bohun
 Earl of 
Hereford
 and 
Essex,
 and he about the beginning of 
Richard
 the second, con∣veys it to 
Nicholas de Brembre
 Son of Sir 
John de Brembre,
 who at the Battle of 
Trent,
 as Mr. 
Selden
 relates in his 
Titles of Honour pag.
 556. made himself eminent by a sig∣nall encounter with 
John de Beaumonour
 in the year 1350. And endevouring to support the prerogative of 
Richard
 the second, in an Age wherin his Crime was, too much Loialty, against the Assaults of some of the Factious and Ambitious Nobility, sunk under the waight of their Hatred and Opposition: and being attainted of High Treason, this in the tenth year of the abovesaid Prince Escheated to the Crown, and the same King in the thirteenth year of his Raign, granted it to 
John Hermensthorpe,
 who imme∣diately after conveyed it to 
Richard Fitzallan,
 Earl of 
Arundell,
 Lord Treasurer, and Lord Admirall of 
England;
 whose Son 
Thomas Fitzallan
 dying without Issue, 
Joan
 one of his Sisters and Coheirs matching with 
William Beauchampe,
 who was created by Writt Baron of 
Abergavenny,
 in the sixteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, knit this Mannor to the Patrimony of that Family, where it continued till 
Richard Beauchampe
 this mans Son dying without Issue-male, in the ninth year of 
Henry
 the fifth, bequea∣thed it to 
Elizabeth
 his Sole Daughter and Heir, who matched afterward to 
Edward Nevill
 Baron of 
Abergavenny,
 from whom the Title both of the Barony and 
Merworth,
 flowed down to his Great Grandchild 
Henry Nevill,
 who died the twenty ninth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and left this Mannor to 
Mary
 his Sole Daughter and heir, marri∣ed to Sir 
Thomas Fane,
 unto whom King 
James,
 in the first Parliament which he held, Restored, Gave, Granted, and so forth, the Name, Style, Title, Honour and Dig∣nity of Baroness 
le Despencer,
 and that her Heirs Successively should be Barons 
le Desp neer
 for ever. She had Issue by Sir 
Thomas Fane
 of 
Badsell
 in 
Kent,
 Sir 
Francis Fane
 eldest Son, Knight of the Bath, whom King 
James
 in the twenty second year of his Raign, 
December
 the 29. created Earl of 
Westmerland,
 and Baron 
Burghurst;
 being likewise by his Mothers Descent extracted from the female heir of that old Baro∣ny: for 
Edw. le Despencer,
 who maried 
Elizabeth
 Heir of 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Burghurst,
 and 
Rich. Beauchampe
 who married 
Isabell
 Daughter and Heir of 
Thomas
 Lord 
De∣spencer,
 and his eldest Son Sir 
Mildmay Fane,
 Knight of the Noble Order of the Bath, now Earl of 
Westmerland,
 doth not onely enjoy the Concomitant Titles of 
Despencer
 and 
Burghurst
 but the Mannor of 
Mereworth
 likewise, with all the Royalties of it, which were not inferiour to any which hathreceived Honour by its owners, for it is holden in Chivalrie, by an entire Knights Fee; and a Free-warren which was formerly grant∣ed to it, is yet extant, and the Conveniences of a Park, and Conies are not wanting.


Jotes-Court
 in this Parish of 
Merworth,
 had, as appears by severall old Deeds, some without Date, Owners who were written 
Jeotes:
 and by contraction of the Name, call'd 
Jotes,
 but before the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, this Family was crumbled

away and gone, and then it came to have the same possessors with 
Merworth,
 as namely, 
Fitz-Allan, Beauchampe,
 and 
Nevill:
 the last of which who enjoyed it, was Sir 
Tho. Nevil
 third Son of 
George Nevill
 Baron of 
Abergavenny,
 which Sir 
Tho.
 was one of the Privy Councel to 
Henry
 the eighth, and Speaker of the Parliament, and he in the thirty third year of that Prince, conveyed it by Sale to Sir 
Robert Southwell,
 who in the thirty fifth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, by the same Fatalitie, passed it away to Sir 
Edmund Walsing∣ham
 of 
Scadbery,
 whose great Grandchild Sir 
Tho. Walsingham
 Knight, hath not ma∣ny years since alienated all his Concernment in it to his Son in Law, Mr. 
James Masters.


Swanton-Court
 is the last place considerable in 
Merworth.
 It lay couched in that Re∣venue which related to the Knights Hospitalers, untill the publique Dissolution sup∣planted it, and surrendred it to the Crown, and K. 
Henry
 the eighth about the thirty second year of his Raign, granted it to Sir 
Robert Southwell,
 who in the thirty fifth year of that Prince, conveyed it to Sir 
Edmund Walsingham
 of 
Scadbery,
 whose Successor Sir 
Thomas Walsingham
 of the same place, hath lately passed away all his Interest here to his Son in Law Mr. 
James Masters.


Roger de Merworth
 obtained a Market weekly, and a Fair yearly to his Mannor of 
Merworth,
 in the eighteenth year of 
Edward
 the first, as appears by an old originall pa∣tent in the hands of the Earl of 
Westmerland.


Middleton
 is so called, by Reason it is placed in the middle of the Shire, and gives Name, to the whole Hundred, which is divided, into five Bay∣lywicks, one whereof is called the Bailiwick of 
Shepey,
 because it comprehends that Island. Antiquity has set a noble Attribute upon it, for in ancient Records it is styled 
Regia Villa de Middleton,
 and here at 
Kemsley
 Downe, derived from 
Campsley, viz.
 the pastures where the Camp was kept. Within the Parish of 
Mid∣dleton,
 is the very place, where, in the Time of King 
Alfred, Hasten
 the Dane, that so much infested 
France,
 arrived, and fortified in such manner as he before had at 
Apuldore,
 where he erected a Castle, whose Fragments and Reliques are yet visible.


Our ancient Chroniclers inform us, that this Town, was in a good Condition till the Ragin of 
Edward
 the Confessor: in whose days, during the Disgust be∣tween him and Earl 
Godwin,
 such as confederated with the Earl at home, burnt the King's House here at 
Middleton,
 a castellated Pallace beneath the Church, whilst he and his Sons ransack'd and ruin'd many other places upon the Seacoasts, and Skirts of the Shire.


In Times of a latter Date 
John de Burgo,
 the elder, had a Grant by Patent of the Mannors of 
Middleton,
 and 
Marden,
 in the second year of 
Edward
 the first: and after 
Margaret
 Queen of 
England,
 had a Grant by Patent likewise in the tenth year of 
Edward
 the second; and after her, Queen 
Philippa
 Wife to 
Edward
 the third, had probably this Mannor in Dower, for in the nineteenth year of that King's Raign, as appears 
Pat. Anno
 19. 
part. prima memb.
 26. she grants it for some term of years, to 
William de Clinton
 Earl of 
Huntingdon,
 with all the Liber∣ties annexed to it, reserving only some royal Franchises, which were so inherent to the Crown, they could not be separated, for an Annual Rent of 200. 
lb
 
per Annum;
 after his Time was expired, it reverts to the Crown, and there it re∣mained, for ought I can yet discover, till the English Scepter was put into the Hands of K. 
James,
 and then he grants the Mannors of 
Middleton
 and 
Marden
 for ever to 
Philip
 Earl of 
Pembroke
 not long since deceased.


There is within the Limitts of this Parish, a Mannor called 
Northwood Chaste∣ners,
 which Name complies with the situation, for it stands North from the Town in a Wood, where Chest-Nut Trees formerly grew abundantly. 
Stephen
 the Son of 
Jordan de Shepey,
 desirous to plant himself out of the Island, in some place not far distant; built here a Mansion-house, moated about,

 and a goodly well-wooded Park, stored with plenty of Deere and wild Bores, and had Licence from the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and religious Men of 
Christ-church,
 to erect a Free-Chappell, which some old People hereabouts, who remembred it in the declining Age, described to my Father when he visited 
Kent,
 to be a curious peice of Architecture for Form and Beauty. * 
Rog. de Northwood,
 is listed in the Inventory of those worthy 
Ken∣tish


persons, who were engaged with K. 
Ric.
 the first, at his Seige of 
Acon
 in 
Palestine.
 His Successor was Sir 
Rog. de Northwood,
 who was ever fast and faithfull to 
H.
 the third, and having always given himself to a military and martial Profession, conceived it was ig∣nominious to hold his Lands here, by a lazy and unactive Socage Tenure, and therefore in the forty first year of 
Henry
 the third, changed them from Gavelkind to Knights Service. He dyed in the thirteenth year of 
Edw.
 the first, and his eldest Son Sir 
John Northwood
 succeeded both at 
Northwood
 and at 
Shorn
 and in the time of 
Ed.
 the first, together with his eldest son Sir 
Jo. de Northwood
 was with that K. in his Wars in 
Scotland,
 at the Seige of 
Carlaverock.
 The Mannor of 
Shorn
 holding by this Tenure 
viz,
 to carry a white Banner forty Days together at their own Charge, when the King should make War in 
Scotland.
 Sir 
Jo. de Northwood,
 was called by Writ to sit in Parliament as Baron, the first of 
Edw.
 the second, and his Son 
John de Northwood
 was often summoned to sit as Baron in Par∣liament, in the raign of 
Ed.
 the third. Certainly a numerous Race of worthy Successors were Possessors of this Mannor of 
Northwood
 some of which lye buryed crosse∣leg'd in 
Milton
 Church, that had taken upon them to defend the Sepulchre of 
Christ,
 or otherwise profest themselves for the Wars in the Holy Land. And at last it devolved to 
John Northwood,
 who (as all things are wound upon a fixed and de∣termined Period) concluded in two Daughters and Coheirs, one married to 
Bar∣ley,
 of the County of 
Hertford,
 and 
Joan
 the other was matched to Sir 
John Nor∣ton
 whose Ancestors were derived from one 
Nicholas de Norton,
 who flourished in King 
Stephens
 Days, and had much Land about 
Norton
 and 
Feversham,
 as appears by the Book of St. 
Austins.
 This Sir 
John Norton
's Son, for diverse remarkable Services performed in 
Flanders,
 was knighted by 
Mary
 Queen of 
Hungary,
 then Lady Regent of the Low-countries, for 
Charles
 the fifth, by the Name of Sir 
John Norton:
 and his Grandchild Sir 
Thomas Norton,
 some thirty five years since, alienated it to 
Manasser Northwood
 Esquire, collaterally branched out from the abovesaid 
John Northwood,
 and his Son Mr. 
Robert Northwood,
 passed away the Pre∣mises by Sale to Sir 
John Tufton,
 third Brother to 
Nicholas Tufton
 Earl of 
Tha∣net,
 whose second Son Sir 
Charles Tufton,
 upon the late Decease of his eldest Brother Sir 
Benedict
 is now entered upon it.


Helmes
 or 
Holmes
 is a Mannor, which is partly situated in 
Iwade,
 and partly in 
Milton,
 and had still the same Proptietaries, as namely 
Savage
 and then 
Clifford,
 whither for Satisfaction, I referre the Reader: only this I must add, that about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 it was rent off by Sale and planted in the Re∣venue of 
Thompson,
 Ancestor to Mr...... 
Thompson
 of 
Royton
 Chappel in 
Lenham,
 who is at this instant in the enjoyment of it.


Kempsley
 in this Parish, puts in its Title, to be of Roman extraction, and there is something in the Name, and in the Situation, which does seem to support this originall, nor hath Time with its destructive Impressions so defaced it, but that there are some Reliques yet remaining of a Camp, and other antiquated Fortifications.


Middleton
 in the fifteenth of 
Edward
 the first, had a Market granted by that Prince, to be held there on the Saturday, which continues until this day.


Midley,
 in the Hundred of 
Langport,
 was parcell of the Inheritance of 
Eching∣ham,
 of whom more is spoken at 
Jacks-court
 in 
Lidde;
 from whom by 
Margaret
 Daughter and Heir of 
Thomas Echingham,
 it devolved to 
Walter Blount
 Esquire; from him it descended to his Son 
Edward Blount
 Lord 
Montjoy,
 who deceasing with∣out Issue, 
Elizabeth
 his Sister and Heir entered upon the Possession; and she by matching with 
Andrew Windsor,
 after created Lord 
Windsor
 by 
Henry
 the eighth, swelled the Revenue of that Family, by the Addition of 
Midley;
 who not long after, passed it away to 
Clache,
 by whose Daughter and Heir it came over to 
Stringer;
 and he transferred his Right in it by Sale to 
Scot;
 and 
Scot
 conveyed the whole Demise to 
Godfrey,
 whose Son Sir 
The. Godsrey,
 does now possesse the Signory of the Premises.


Milsted
 in the Hundred of 
Milton,
 though an obscure Village in it Self, yet has been anciently eminent for several noble Families which have had their Residence within the Circuit of it. For first, 
Hogshaws
 gave not only Seat but Sirname likewise to a Family of that Denomination, in whom, when it had for many years continu∣ed,

Edmund Hogshaw
 in the eleventh year of 
Richard
 the second, passed it away to Sir 
Thomas Lovell,
 and he dyed seised of it, in the second year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and 
Thomas Lovell
 was his Heir; after 
Lovell, Greaves
 by purchase became entituled to the Possession of it; whose Successor 
Robert Greaves,
 in the ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, passed it away to 
Roger VVake,
 and this 
Roger VVake,
 in the fifteenth year of the said Prince's Government, alienated by Sale his Con∣cernment in it to 
Richard Bernard;
 who some few years after, devested himself of his Right in it, and sold it to 
Adam Henman
 of 
Lenham,
 where after the Title some few years had fixed, he in the twelfth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 conveyed it over to 
Amias Thompson,
 and he gave it in Dower with his Daughter 
Alice Thompson,
 to Sir 
John Tooke,
 from whom in the memory of these Times, it de∣volved by Descent, to his Son Captain 
Nicholas Tooke,
 who passed it away by Sale to Mr. 
Richard Tilden.


Then we have here secondly another place, which in some old Evidences, is represented under the Name of 
Nottingham
 Court, though now it bears the Name of 
Higham.
 It was the Residence of a noble Family called 
Nottingham,
 who were Owners of a large Patrimony in this Track, and their Armes stand yet in old coloured Glasse in 
Milsted
 Church, 
viz. Paly wavee
 of four pieces, 
Gules
 and 
Ar∣tent.
 The last of which, was 
John Nottingham,
 who expired in a Daughter and Heir, called 
Eleanor Nottingham,
 who by matching with 
Simon Cheney,
 second Son of Sir 
Richard Cheney
 of 
Shurland,
 brought this and a large Demeasne with it, to ac∣knowledge the Signiory of that Family, in which Name without any Vicissitude to transplant the Title it is fixed at this day.


Milton Septuans
 in the Hundred of 
Westgate,
 was anciently a Parish,

 and had a Church, appertaining to it, though now by disuse it be languished into decay, and shrunk into so narrow an Estimate, that it has left only an Oratory or little Chappel, which is yet visible to instruct us, what was its former Glory, which certainly was of no inconsiderable Account, when it was the Seat of the elder House of 
Septuans,
 who made this their Residence. For 
VVilliam Septuans,
 Son of 
William Septuans,
 had here is Habitation, when he was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 which was in the fourth year of 
Richard
 the second: but long after this Man, did it not con∣tinue in the Name of 
Septuans:
 for this Family, as to that Branch of it, which was planted at this place, shrunk into a Daughter and Heir, who was matched to Sir 
Francis Fogge,
 and so this place fell under his Revenue. And from him descended Sir 
Will. Fogge;
 whose Successor Sir 
John Fogge
 of 
Repton
 Knight, passed this away to Sir 
George Brown
 of 
Bechworth
 Castle; in whom it remained, till this Mans Grand∣child Sir 
Thomas Brown
 of 
Bechworth
 aforesaid, partly sold it, and partly gave it in Dower, with his Daughter 
Elizabeth Brown,
 to Sir 
Robert Honywood
 of 
Charing,
 whose eldest Son by this Match, Sir 
Thomas Honywood
 of 
Marks
 Hall in 
Essex,
 is now planted in the Fee-simple of it.


Moldash
 in the Hundred of 
Felborough,
 is a Branch of the Mannor of 
Chilham:
 but yet there is the Mannor of 
Flemings aliàs Bowers,
 for so it is styled in Re∣cords and Court-rolls, which deserves our Notice. It was in the year 1019, as an ancient Court-roll, now in the Hands of Mr. 
Chapman
 does inform me, in the Hands of 
John de Fleming,
 and probably, here it remained diverse years, though I can discover nothing, which may evince the certainty of it; for there is an Intermis∣sion or Gap in the Evidences. In the twenty fourth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, as appears by another ancient Court-roll, it was the Possession of 
John Treswenall,
 and in this Name it continued till the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth; and then it was alienated to Sir 
Thomas Moile;
 in whose Posterity the Title and Demeasne was setled, till our Fathers memory, and then the Fee-simple was sold away to Mr. 
Henry Chapman.


Then secondly, there is the Mannor of 
Witherling,
 who had Owners, who bore that Sirname, and who had certainly the Possession of it, severall Generations, which is manifest from that compliance the Name had with the Mansion, though the Evidence which I have drained from the Deeds and Muniments of this place, reaches

no higher then the Government of 
Henry
 the sixth: for in the thirty eighth year of that Prince's Rule, 
Joan Witherling
 the visible and only apparent Heir of this Family, transmitted her Interest in it by Sale to 
William Keneworth,
 whose Son 
William Kene∣worth
 by the like Fatalitie passed it away in the Raign of 
Henry
 the seventh, to 
John Moile
 of 
Buckwell,
 Esquire, extracted from the 
Moiles
 of 
Bodmin
 in 
Cornwall,
 and this 
John Moile
 in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, sold it to 
Hamo Vidian,
 a Name very ancient in 
Moldash,
 for here is a Farme which at this Day carries the Name of 
Vidian-Forestall
 and his Grandchild 
William Vidian
 at this instant enjoys the Fee-simple of it.


Mongeham,
 called for distinction, 
Great-Mongeham,
 to difference it from an Ham∣let of that Name, styled 
Little-Mongeham,
 lies in the Hundred of 
Eastry,
 and was given to the Church by 
Eadbert
 King of 
Kent,
 for a supply both of Diet and Apparell of the Monks of St. 
Austins,
 (as the Book of 
Christ-Church
 does insinuate) and, upon the Dissolution of the Covent, and annexing the Demeasn to the Revenue of the Crown, it was by 
Henry
 the eighth, in the thirty third year of his Raign, granted to the Dean and Chapter of 
Christ-Church,
 who conveyed it in Lease to 
John Fropchunt,
 from whom by Purchase it was brought over to 
Gibs,
 and is now the Patrimony and Hereditarie Right of 
Crayford,
 a Name of deep and Extraction in this Territorie, by Purchase from the above recited Family.


There is a place in this Parish called 
Fogs-Court,
 which is Register'd in the Inven∣torie of the Mannors of this County; and although the Mansion-House which be∣longs to it, be fallen into so low a degree of Contempt, that it appears now to be litle more than a Caberet or Cottage, yet it calls for some Remembrance, even in this respect, that it was the Patrimony of that noble and Illustrious Family, and is the only Place of this County which I have yet met with, that is adopted into their Sirname, from 
Tho. Fogge
 Esq; Serjeant Porter of 
Callis,
 who was the last of this Name which possest it: by 
Alice Fogge
 his Daughter and Coheir, it came to be the Inheritance of her Hus∣band 
William Scot,
 and in this Family did the Patrimonial Interest of it reside, till almost in our Memory, the Signory and Propriety of it was from this Family by Sale translated into Mr. 
Philip Pownall
 of 
Sibertswould.


Great-Barville
 partly lying in 
Mongeham,
 and partly in 
Tilmanston,
 is the third place considerable in 
Mongeham.
 It hath been for many Descents, which have made up some Centuries of years, the Possession of 
Crayford,
 which are written in Deeds of a very high Ascent, 
de Barville Magna:
 In an old Roll which summs up those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who were with 
Richard Nevill
 Earl of 
Warwick,
 at the Battle of 
North-Hampton,
 (where after a warm and Bloody Debate, the Title of the House of 
York
 by a glorious Victory was evidently asserted.) There is mention of 
William Cray∣ford
 Esquire, who afterwards (as some private Evidences inform me, now in the hands of Mr. 
Gethins
 neer 
Burntwood
) was made Bannerett by King 
Edward
 the fourth, for his various undertakings and Services performed in several Encounters, which had an Influence upon the Cause and Quarrell of the House of 
York,
 and bore (as is mani∣fest by his Seal affixed to several Deeds) 
Ʋpon a Cheveron, three Eagles heads cresed,
 which I mention, to rectifie that 
istake which through inadvertency, hath crept into our Visitations of 
Kent,
 wher
 
he paternall Coat of this Family is represented to have been 
Ʋpon a Cheveron, t
 Falcons heads erased;
 and from this eminent Person is Mr. 
Wil. Crayford
 Lord of th
 Mannor in expectance, by a Thread of direct Descent, ori∣ginally extracted.


Mongeham
 had an an
ent Market by prescription on the 
Thursday,
 and 
Bertram de Crioll
 had a Grant of i
 by the Charter of 
Henry
 the third, which was allowed by the Judges Itinerant 
n the seventh year of 
Edward
 the first, and a Fair yearly, by the space of three Dayes, 
viz.
 the Eve, St. 
Luke's
 day, and the day after.


Little-Barville
 is partly Situated in this Parish, and partly in 
Tilmanston.
 A Family called 
Pix,
 and sometimes 
Picks,
 were for some Centuries of years, invested in the Possession, and contracted this Name, from some Office (as the Successive Tradition of this Family affirms) that they were anciently entrusted with, about the Altar, and the Utensils which related to it, amongst which, the 
Pix
 was the most consider∣able, as being the Conservatory of the Host; and so 
è Pixide nomen elicitum,
 from

their Care and Custody of the 
Pix,
 they originally assumed their Sirname: But to proceed; after this Mannor had for so many Descents, acknowledged this Name and Fa∣mily, about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 by Sale it came to confess the Signory of 
Crayford
 of 
Great-Barville,
 with whose Revenue the Title and Propriety does at this instant continue.


Little-Mongeham
 next offers it self up to our consideration: but of that, I shall speak more at 
Northbourne.


Morston
 in the Hundred of 
Milton,
 gave Seat and Sirname to a Family that fell un∣der that Appellation, as is evident by the Book of 
Aid,
 where 
John de Morston
 is affirmed to have held it, and to have paid an Auxiliary Contribution for it at the making the Black Prince Knight. He was descended from 
Bartholomew de Morston,
 who is in the list of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen who assisted King 
Richard
 the first, at the Siege of 
Acon;
 But before the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, this Family was worn out, and then it fell under the Signory of 
Walter Fitz Walter
 of 
Essex,
 who had beenin elder Times summoned frequently by Writ to sit as Baron in Parliament, and from the a∣bovesaid 
Walter,
 did this Mannor by paternal devolution come down to his Son 
Hum∣phrey Fitzwalter,
 and he held it at his Death, which was in the first year of 
Henry
 the sixth and had Issue 
John Fitzwalter,
 who about the latter end of the abovesaid Prince, alie∣nated it by Sale to 
Cromer,
 in which Family the possession was constant and resident, untill the latter end of King 
James,
 and then Sir 
James Cromer
 dying without Issue∣male, 
Christian
 one of his Daughters and Coheirs, by matching with Sir 
John Hales
 upon the distinction of the Estate into parcells, was united to the Patrimony of that Family, from whom the Right by Descent is now transmitted to the instant Proprie∣tarie Sir 
Edward Hales,
 his Son and Heir, Baronet.


Esthall
 is another Mannor in 
Morston,
 which although it be now by the Vicissitude of Time, and the injurious Impressions of Age, shrunk from its elder Beauty, into decay and Neglect; yet in Ages of a higher date, it was adorned with a nobler Char∣acter of Splendor, when it confessed it self to be parcell of the Inheritance of an an∣cient Family called 
De la pine,
 (so they are written in their old dateless Deeds) and bore for their Arms 
Sable, three Pine Apples Or. James De la pine
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the twenty sixth, and part of the twenty seventh years of 
Edward
 the third, and held his Shrievalty here at 
Esthall,
 and died possest of it in the thirty seventh year of the abovesaid Prince, and left it to his Son and Heir 
Thomas De la pine,
 who about the be∣ginning of 
Richard
 the second, conveyed his Title and Concernment in it to 
Thomas St. Leger
 Esquire, Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the twentieth year of 
Richard
 the second, who dying without Issue-male, 
Joan,
 one of his Daughters and Coheirs, by matching with 
John Ewias,
 linked it to the Demeasn of that Name, and from him did it transmit it self by Descent, to his Son and Heir 
Humphrey Ewias,
 who was seised of it at his De∣cease, which was in the thirty third year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and from him by a Thread of paternal Succession, was it transported to his Grandchild 
William E
ias
 in whom the Male-line determined, so that by 
Alice
 his Daughter and Heir, it came to confess the Signory of 
Thomas Hales,
 who in the sixth year of 
Edward
 the sixth by a Fine and re∣covery wherein his Wife was concern'd, passed away the whole De
se to Sir 
Anthony Aucher,
 whose Son, Sir 
Anthony Aucher,
 in the ninth year of Quee
 
Elizabeth,
 by the same conveyance alienated it to 
Gardiner,
 where the Title was so 
atile and mutable that it stayed with this Family, but untill the tenth year of the ab
said Princess, and then it was transplanted by Sale into 
John Norden,
 who in our 
dfathers memory demised it to 
Pordage,
 Predecessor to Mr........ 
Pordage
 of 
R
ersham,
 who is now entitled to the Fee-simple of it.


Mere-Court
 is a third place of Account in this Parish, calle
 
 from its Situation near the Sea, which our 
Saxon
 Ancestors called 
Mere,
 and is c
marily used in that sense, for any wast heap of Waters, as Lakes, and Pools, that are 
 all sides lockt in by the Land, by the 
Dutch
 to this day. But I cannot find that it ev
 had any Possessors that extracted their Sirname from hence; for in the Raign of 
Edward
 the third, I find 
Arnold de Savage
 held it, and so did his Grandchild 
Eleanor Savage,
 who was matched to 
William Clifford,
 and he by this Alliance, became invested in the Possession, and in this Family did the Title lie couched, untill the beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, and

then I can track no farther Evidence of their Possession of this place: In the Raign of 
Edward
 the sixth, I find it to be invested in the Name of 
Croft;
 and remained tied to the Patrimony of that Family, untill 
David Crofts
 died in the twenty second year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and left it to 
Jo. Croft, Helen
 and 
Margaret,
 his Daughters; and they, upon the death of their Brother, who was an Ideot, becomming Joynt-heirs to this place, in the forty second year of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 passed it away to Mr. 
Stephen Hulks,
 who bequeathed it to his Son and Heir Mr. 
Jo. Hulks,
 and he upon his Decease, which was not many years since, gave it to his second Son Mr. 
Charles Hulks,
 who now is in Fruition of it.






N. N. N. N.


NAtindon
 in the Hundreds of 
Bridge, Petham,
 and 
Whitstaple,
 is an obscure Village, not far remote from 
Canterbury,
 and only calls for some Remembrance in this respect, that the Mannor of 
Staplegate
 is situated within the Limits of it, which was the Seat of an eminent Family which bore that Sirname, who were Lords not onely of this Place, but of much other Land in 
Romney Mersh;
 and had certainly this De∣nomination ingrafted originally upon them, because they collected the Kings profits and Customes arising out of the Staple of Wooll, fixed at 
Staplegate
 in 
Canterbury.
 The first of this Family whom I find eminent is 
Edmund Staplegate,
 who paid respective Aid for his Mannor of 
Bilsington
 and his other Lands in 
Kent,
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at making the Black Prince Knight; and he was Father to 
Edmund Staplegate,
 who at the Coronation of 
Richard
 the second, held that signall Contest be∣fore 
John
 of 
Gaunt
 Duke of 
Lancaster,
 then High Steward at that solemn Inthroniza∣tion, with 
Richard
 Earl of 
Arundell
 about the Office of Chief Butler, as I have be∣fore mentioned in 
Bilsington.
 But to return to that Discourse from whence this e∣mergent Controversie did divert me, 
Edmund Staplegate
 in the thirteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, enjoyed this Mannor at his Death: but after his Deeease, the Title was not long liv'd in this Name, for in the Raign of 
Henry
 the fifth, and 
Henry
 the sixth, (as appears by the Testimony of ancient Court Rolls) it was in the Possession of 
Leichfield,
 who was Master of much Land about 
Tilmanston
 and 
Betshanger,
 and in the twenty second year of 
Ed.
 the fourth, it was by 
Roger Lichfield
 passed away by Sale to 
William Haut
 Esquire, Father to Sir 
William Haut,
 in whom the male-line determined, so that by 
Elizabeth
 his Daughter and Coheir, it came to be the Inheritance of Sir 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bedgebury,
 who about the first year of 
Edward
 the sixth, alienated it to 
Philip Chowte
 Esquire, and from him the like Fate bore off the Title to Sir 
Anthony Aucher,
 and he about the latter end of 
Edward
 the sixth, disposed of his Right in it to Sir 
James Hales
 of the 
Dungeon,
 Ancestor to Sir 
James Hales
 of the same place, who not many years since, demised the Premises to Mr. 
Smith
 of 
High-Gate;
 upon whose late Decease, the Title like a 
Pythagorean
-Soul is transmigrated into his Heir.


Nettlested
 in the Hundred of 
Twyford,
 was the ancient Seat of the no∣ble and ancient Family of 
Pimpe. William de Pimpe,
 paid respective Aid, for this Mannor and other Lands, which lay not far distant from this place, which he held by a whole Knights Fee, at the making the Black Prince Knight, the twentieth of 
Edward
 the third; 
Reginald Pimpe
 was his Son and Heir, and served out the Office of high Sheriff of 
Kent
 for him, in the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, in which year he dyed. It is probable that this 
William
 was knighted, because there is a Tombe, in 
Nettlested
 Church, with this Inscription affixed to his Tombe-stone: 
Hic jacet Domina Margareta de Cobham, quondam Ʋxor Willielmi Pimpe, Militis; quae obiit
 4 
Septembris
 1337. From whence it may be probably collected, that the above recited 
William Pimpe,
 though he is not mentioned as a Knight in the Register of the Sheriffs, yet afterwards for some exemplary Services by him

performed and managed, might be invested with the Order of Knighthood. From this Man in the continued Succession of a direct Line,

 did 
Reginald Pimpe
 des∣cend, who determined in 
Ann Pimpe
 who was his Sole Heir, and so this ancient Family which had under a venerable Character of Antiquity, for so many Ages flourished at this place, as the Monuments in the Church, not yet dismantled, do sufficiently evince, was about the latterend of 
Henry
 the seventh extinguished; and 
Nettlested
 fell under the Patrimony of 
John Scott
 of 
Scotts
 Hall from whom 
Edw. Scot
 Esquire, is lineally extracted; and in Relation to this Alliance, is the instant Proprietary of 
Nettlested.


Lomewood
 is a second place of Account in 
Nettlested
 it belonged formerly to a Cloister of black Cannons in 
Oxford,
 dedicated to St. 
Friswith,
 which being suppres∣sed by Cardinal 
Wolsey,
 in the year 1525, when he intended to erect the magni∣ficent Fabrick of the Colledge of 
Christ-church,
 this Mannor was resigned up to the Crown; and was by King 
Henry
 the eighth, in the twenty seventh year of his raign, granted to Sir 
Edward Nevill,
 who gave it in Martiage with his Daugh∣ter 
Katharine Nevill,
 espoused to 
John Roydon
 Esquire, of 
Roydon
-Hall, in great 
Peckham;
 and he determining in 
Elizabeth Roydon
 his Sole Heir, she by matching with 
Roger Twisden
 Esquire, planted it in his Revenue; and from him hath the Interest of Descent transported it along to his Grandchild Sir 
Roger Twisden
 of 
Roy∣don
 Hall Knight and Baronet.


Newenden
 in the Hundred of 
Selbrittenden,
 was erected in the place where the old Roman City of 
Anderida
 was situated, and was called by the Britons 
Caer Andred,
 very aptly by 
Leland,
 styled in Latine, 
Noviodunum,
 from the Saxon, 
Nywandun,
 in English by Corruption called 
Newenden,
 which in the original imports as much as The new Hill in the Valley.


This was that Station and City of the Romans mentioned in the Banner of the Count, or Lord Warden of the Saxon Shore, by 
Pancerollus
 in his Book called 
Notitia Provinciarum,
 under the Name of 
Anderida,
 and sometimes written 
An∣deridos;
 and here was the Castle which the Saxons called 
Andreds Ceaster;
 and the great Wood, which stretched out in length, from hence into 
Hampshire,
 80. miles was named 
Andreds-wald,
 and by the Britons 
Coid Andred,
 other reasons are laid down for the Identity of the place, extracted from the Name which the English Saxons gave it, who termed it 
Brittenden,
 that is, The Britons Vale, from whence the whole Hundred adjoyning is called 
Sellbrittenden,
 that is, The Britons Woody Vale.


Here for Defence of the Coast, against the Eruptions of Saxon Rovers, the Romans placed the 
Prapositus Numeri Abulcorum,
 and hither the River of 
Lymen,
 long fince called 
Rother,
 was sufficiently Navigable. But soon after the Romans deserted 
Brittain,
 it shrunk into Decay, being ruined by the English Saxons; and yet a marke of the Losse, is covertly couched, under the Name of the principal Mannor, called 
Losenham,
 of which something is to be remembred, when we have done with the History of this place, which I have thus abbreviated. 
Hengist,
 be∣ing fully determined to expell all the Britons out of 
Kent,
 and thinking it would much conduce to the improvement of his Design, to recruite his Army with Troops of his own Nation, called 
Ella
 the Founder of the South-Saxon Kingdome, and his three Sons with a strong Power out of 
Germanie,
 and then gave a sharp Assault against this 
Anderida,
 but was intercepted at that instant in his Designe, by those vigorous Impressions, which the Britons out of their Ambushments in the Woods then made upon him. In Fine, after many Prejudices and Losses both given and taken: 
Hen∣gist
 divided his Army, and not onely discomfited the Britons in the adjacent wood but also at the same Time, forced the City by Assault, and became so enflamed with revenge, that nothing but the Extinction of the Inhabitants, by a publick slaughter, and the totall demolishing of the Town, could supersede or allay so great an Animosity. The place lying thus desolate, was shewed (as 
Henry
 of 
Hunting∣don
 reports) many Ages after, to inquisitive Passengers, till in the year 791, King 
Offa
 gave this and other Lands to the Arch-bishop and Monks of 
Canterbury, ad Pascua Porcorum,
 for the Pannage of their Hoggs.




In the Time of the Conquerour, the Arch-bishops and Monks of 
Canterbury,
 held this Mannor of 
Newenden;
 and it was rated in the extent of it, but at one Sul∣ling, and was an Appendage to 
Saltwood,
 and in the Patrimony of the Church did the Title of it remain locked up, till the general Dissolution in the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was unloosned, and by Act of Parliament fastned to the Revenue of the Crown, where, till these infortunate Times, it did successively continue.


Losenham
 in this Parish, was the ancient Seat of the 
Auchers,
 an eminent and numerous Family; this was both in 
Kent, Sussex, Nottingham,
 and 
Essex;
 where they made 
Coppt-Hall
 by 
Epping,
 the Seat and Head of their Barony, and it is ve∣ry probable, they derive this their Name, from 
Aucherus
 that was Consul or El∣derman of 
Kent,
 and led the power of the County, wherewith, at 
Richborough,
 nere 
Sandwich,
 he foiled and defeated the 
Danes,
 as 
Alfred
 of 
Beverley
 writes. In the Book called 
Nova Feoffamenta,
 collected in the Raign of 
Henry
 the second, it is there recorded that that Prince,

 gave 
William Fitz Aucher,
 the fourth part of a Knights Fee in 
Essex,
 called 
Lagfare. Richard Fitz Aucher
 his Grandchild, is in the Number of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who were engaged with 
Henry
 the third, in his Expedition into 
Wales,
 in the forty second year of his Raign. 
Will. Fitz Aucher,


 another of this Family, held the Mannor of 
Boseham
 in 
Sussex,
 by Grant from 
William
 the Conquerour, and his Rent-service or Acknowledgement, was to pay into the Exchequer (in whose Time he lived) forty pound of tryed and weighted Silver. 
Henry Fitz Aucher,
 fills up the Roll or Inventory of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who assisted 
Edward
 the first, at his Seige of 
Carlaverok
 in 
Scotland,
 in the twenty eighth year of his Raign, and for his Service there, was made Knight Banneret. 
Peter Aucher
 or 
Auger
 (for so in old Records they are promiscuously written) was Valet to King 
Edward
 the second (an Office equivalent in its Trust and Dignity, to those we called Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber to our late Kings) and it seems was mistaken for a Knight Templer, in the fourth year of that Prince, because he nourished a spreading Beard (in that Age an emi∣nent Adjunct of that Order): but 
Edward
 the second rectified this Mistake, and af∣firmed, that his diffused Beard, did not evince he was a Knight Templer, as ap∣pears 
Pat.

 20. And if it could any way multi∣ply, or improve the Eminence of a Family, that was so deeply rooted in Anti∣quity before, I could tell you, that sundry of this Name and Family, were Con∣servators of the Peace, and concerned in other Comissions, both to levy Taxes, im∣posed by Parliament, and to have Inspection into Sewers, both in the Raign of 
Edward
 the third, and 
Richard
 the second: but I avoid the recital, lest this Book might swell into too large a Bulk by these curious and unnecessary Disquisitions. It is enough to inform you, that after this Mannor had for many Centuries of years been wrapt up in the Patrimony of this Family, it went away by 
Ann
 Sole Daughter and Heir of 
John Aucher
 of 
Losenham,
 to 
Walter Colepeper,
 second Son of Sir 
John Colepeper,
 of 
Bayhall
 in 
Pepenbury;
 from which Alliance, Sir 
John Colepeper
 created Lord 
Colepeper
 at 
Oxford,
 by the late K. 
Charles,
 claims at this instant the Inheri∣tance and Lordship of 
Losenham.


There was in this Parish, a House of Carmelite Friers, called so, because they came from 
Mount Carmel
 in 
Palestine,
 and was the first Seminary of that Order here in 
England,
 who, by their Rule were styled, Brothers of 
Mary
 the blessed Virgin, to whom this Covent was dedicated. It was founded in the year of our Lord, 1241, and in the twenty sixth year of the Government of 
Henry
 the third, by Sir 
Thomas Alcher
 or 
Fitz Aucher,
 for the Name was often promiscuously writ∣ten so, but never 
Albuser,
 as Mr. 
Camden,
 and Mr. 
Speed,
 have printed it, though, I do not deny, but such a person might be a Benefactor to the Foun∣dation.


Newenham
 in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 was parcell of that Demeasn, which related to the Abbey of 
Boxley,
 and continued united to it, till the Suppression by 
Henry
 the eighth; and then it was granted by that Prince to Sir 
Thomas Wiatt,
 in the twenty eighth year of his Government, and he by his unhappy Defection in

the first year of Queen 
Mary,
 forfeited it to the Crown, where it remained till Queen 
Elizabeth
 by royal Concession, invested the Possession in her faithfull Ser∣vant 
John Astley
 Esquire, Master or Conservator of her Jewells, whose Son Sir 
Jo. Astley
 upon his Decease, bequeathed it to his Nephew Sir 
Norton Knatchbull
 Knight and Baronet, who is the instant Proprietarie of it.


Champions-Court
 is the second place of Account in this Parish: It was in el∣der Times the Mansion and Demeasne of a generous Family, whose Sirname was 
Campania,
 and was certainly a Family of eminence in elder Times. 
Robert de Cam∣pania,
 is inserted in the Register of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who accompanied 
Richard
 the first, to the Seige of 
Acon. John de Campania
 his Grandchild, obtai∣ned the Grant of a Market to 
Newenham
 weekly on the 
Thursday,
 and a Fair yearly to continue the Vigil, the Day of St. 
Peter
 and 
Paul,
 and the Day after; and was one of those Knights of 
Kent,
 who was embarked in the Seige of 
Carlave∣rock
 in 
Scotland,
 with 
Edward
 the first, in the twenty eighth year of his Raign. In Times of a younger Aspect, the Name by Depravation, and vulgar Use lan∣guished into 
Champion;
 and so continued, till it expired in Daughters and Coheirs, one of which was 
Katharine Champion,
 who by matching with 
Robert Corbett,
 des∣cended from the 
Corbetts
 of 
Morton Corbett,
 in the County of 
Salop;
 upon the Division of 
Champions
 Estate, united this to his Revenue, where it had not long rested, but the same vicissitude brought this Name to determine in female Coheirs likewise, two of which called 
Joan,
 and 
Elizabeth,
 were espoused to 
Samuell Slap,
 and 
Ralph Hart. Samuell Slap
 had Issue 
Joan Slap,
 who dyed childlesse; and so this Mannor was cast into the Possession of 
Richard Hart
 Son of 
Ralph Hart;
 the Suc∣cessor of 
Richard Hart,
 in our Fathers Memory, alienated his Interest in it, to Sir 
Henry Spiller,
 and he not many years since, conveyed all his Right and Title to it by Sale, to Mr. 
Weckerlin,
 descended from the 
Weckerlins,
 a Family of good Ranke and Account in Upper 
Germany.


A third place of Note in 
Newenham,
 is 
Sholand,
 whih was in the Raign of 
H.
 the third, as an old datelesse Deed discovers to us the Patrimony of 
Adam de Stomynton:
 and after this Name went out, the 
Bournes
 of 
Sharsted
 in 
Dodington,
 not far removed from this place, were about the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, possest of this Lordship; from them by purchase the Propriety was carried over to 
Chevin,
 des∣cended from the 
Chevins
 of 
Chevins-court
 in 
Marden,
 and 
Thomas Chevin
 of this place, married 
Thomasin,
 Coheir of 
Champion,
 of 
Champions Court
 in this Parish. From 
Chevin
 the Interest of 
Sholand
 did descend by Sale to 
Maycott;
 and from them by the same Fate to 
Adye,
 a Family of Note and very much Antiquity as to the Name, in this Track, whose Right it had not long acknowledged, but by the same Devolution, the Title was invested in 
Steere;
 from whom by Purchase it came over to 
Sayers
 descended from those of 
York-shire,
 who, in that Age our Fathers lived in, sold his Concernment in it to Mr. 
Hugison
 of 
Dover,
 in whose Heirs the Pro∣priety of this place, is at this instant resident.


Newington-Belhouse,
 lies in the Hundred of 
Folkston,
 and was in the Raign of King 
John
 and 
Henry
 the third, the Possession of 
Hubert de Burgo
 Lord Chief Justice of 
England,
 and from him it descended to his Son 
John de Burgo,
 who in the fifty fifth year of 
Henry
 the third, passed it away by Sale to 
Thomas de Belhouse,
 by the Name of 
Newington juxta Hieth.
 And probably this may be a Reason, why this Family after they had adopted this Mannor into their own Name, assumed a Coat which had some Affi∣nitie with that of 
Hubert de Burgo, videlicet. Or, upon a Bend Gules three Lozinges Argent and Gules,
 which I suppose was done to preserve the Memory of him, of whom it was first purchased. But to proceed, Sir 
Thomas de Belhouse
 great Grandchild of the above-mentioned, paid respective Aid for this Mannor by the Name of 
Newington-Bel∣house,
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at making the Black Prince Knight, and died possest of it in the forty eighth year of that Princes Raign from whom a descendant Right brought it down to his Heir 
John de Belhouse,
 who enjoyed it so nar∣row a space of Time, that it is left upon Record that he died seised of it in the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, and 
Robert Knevit
 a younger Son of Sir 
John Knevit
 Lord Chancellor of 
England,
 who had married the Heir Generall of this Family, was

found to be his Heir, and it was this 
Robert,
 or else probably his Son, who in the seventh year of 
Henry
 the fourth, had a Patent of Confirmation of Liberty of Free∣warren to his Lands at 
Newington
 formerly granted to 
Thomas de Belhouse.
 After the Line of the 
Knevits
 was extinguished at this place, which was about the beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, this Mannor devolved to the 
Cloptons:
 for 
Edmund Knevit
 of 
Stanway∣magna
 in 
Essex,
 had three Sisters who were Coheirs to him and their Father 
Edward Knevit
 Esquire; 
Thomasin
 the eldest was matched to Sir 
William Clopton
 of 
Kentwell
 in 
Suffolk
 for his second Wife; and 
Katharine
 the second Sister was married to 
John Clop∣ton
 Esq; eldest Son of the above-said Sir 
William;
 and 
Dorothy
 the third, was matched to 
Thomas Carnaby:
 but these desiring to Contract all their Patrimony within the Verge of 
Suffolk,
 alienared this Mannor in the twenty seventh year of King 
Henry
 the eighth, with much of their Land in the 
Mersh,
 to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cromwell,
 who being attainted in the thirty second year of 
Henry
 the eighth, this Mannor escheated to the Crown, and lay couched in its Revenue, untill the first year of Queen 
Mary,
 and then it was granted to 
Edward
 Lord 
Clinton,
 who in the last year of the above-said Princesse, conveyed it with all its perquisites to 
Henry Herdson,
 whose Grandchild 
Francis Herdson
 almost in that Age we entitle to our Fathers Remembrance, alienated it to Mr. 
Henry Brockman,
 Grandfather to the instant Proprietarie 
James Brock∣man
 Esquire.


Sene
 and 
Bithborough
 were two ancient Seats which related to the Knightly Fa∣mily of 
Valoigns,
 of whom I shall speak more in my Discourse of 
Petham,
 but before the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, this Family was extinguished, and then one of the two Daughters and Coheirs upon the Distinction of the Estate parcells, brought these two places to be the Inheritance of Sir 
Francis Fogge,
 who lies buried Cross-legg'd in 
Cheriton
-Church, with the Arms of 
Fogge
 and 
Valoigns
 empal'd upon his Tombe; and from him did the Propriety and Title in an uninterupted Channell stream down to 
George Fogge
 Esquire, who alienated 
Sene
 in our Grandfathers Memory to 
Honywood,
 and 
Bithborough
 to Mr. 
Henry Brockman,
 who added much to the ancient Building, so that it is now become the Seat of that Family.


Bertrams
 in 
Newington
 is so called because it was parcell of the Estate of 
Bertram de Crioll
 who died possest of it in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first, and left it to 
Joan
 his Heir, espoused to Sir 
Richard de Rokesley,
 by whose Sole Inheritrix likewise called 
Joan,
 it was linked to the Demeasn of Sir 
Thomas de Poynings,
 from whom the Clew of Descent guided it down to Sir 
Edward Poynings,
 who dying in the twelfth of 
Henry
 the eighth without any lawfull Issue, or any visible kindred that could pretend a Title to the Estate, it lapsed to the Crown; and 
Henry
 the eighth granted it to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cromwell
 upon whose attainder it being again escheated, Queen 
Mary
 in the first year of her Rule granted it to 
Edward
 Lord 
Clinton,
 who in the last year of that Princess, passed it away to Mr. 
Henry Herdson,
 whose grandchild Mr. 
Francis Herdson
 conveyed it by Sale to Mr. 
Henry Brockman,
 in whose Grandchild Mr. 
James Brockman
 the instant Inheritance is fixed.


Blackose
 is another little Mannor in 
Newington
 which as 
Sadrach Petit's
 Inquest an Authentick Manuscript informs me, was as high as the raign of 
Henry
 the third, the Possession of 
Nicholas de Morehall,
 a Family who were owners of much Land at 
Folk∣stone,
 and elsewhere in this Track: and in this Name did it continue untill the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, and then it was transmitted by Sale to 
William Edwy,
 who paid a proportionate Aid for it at the Marriage of 
Blanch
 Daughter of 
Henry
 the fourth, in the fourth year of his raign, from whence much of our Land in 
Kent
 which was rated at the same Time, and upon the same Design, hath assumed the Ap∣pellation of 
Blanch
-Lands. After 
Edwy
 went out, which was in the raign of 
Edward
 the fourth, it became the Possession of 
Wreake,
 and 
Thomas Wreake,
 (as the abovesaid 
Sidrach Petit
 who lived in that Age instructs me) exchanged it with 
Will. Warham
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and continued annexed to the Demeasn of that See, until the great Exchange made by 
Tho. Cranmer
 in the twenty ninth of 
Henry
 the eighth, with that Prince, and then it was made the Demeasn of the Crown; and after some brief abode there, was granted away to 
John Honywood
 Esquire.




Newchurch
 in 
Romney Mersh,
 gives Denomination to the whole Hundred wherein it is situated, and dilates and spreads it self into several places, which call for some Remembrance. The first is 
Peckmanston,
 which was, as high as the Rayes or Light of any Evidence can direct to a Discovery, the Inheritance of the Lords 
Leybourne,
 and was annexed to that vast Revenue, which they entituled themselves to, in this County; and so continued, till Sir 
Roger de Leybourne,
 left this with much other Land, to his Sole Daughter and Heir 
Juliana,
 married to 
William
 Lord 
Clinton
 Earl of 
Huntington,
 who dyed in the twenty eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, but without Issue by this Lady, who deceasing likewise not long after, the Crown, upon a Serious and solemne Disquisition, discovering none, that upon the Stock of any collateral Alliance, could pretend to her Estate, seised upon it as an Escheat; and King 
Richard
 the second, in the eleventh year of his Government, granted it to the Abbey of 
Childrens Langley,
 amongst whose Revenue it rested, till the Dissolution of that Covent, and after that King 
Henry
 the eighth by roy∣al Donation, planted the Possession, in the thirty fifth year of his Raign, in Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 a Gentleman in those Times, of principal Estimate in this Coun∣ty, and of the Privie Councel to that Prince; from whom, by 
Amy
 his Daugh∣ter and Coheir, it came suddenly after, to be the Inheritance of Sir 
Thomas Kempe,
 who in the raign of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 sold it to 
Thomas Smith
 Farmer of the Customes to that Princesse, and he bequeathed it to his third Son Sir 
Rich. Smith
 by whose Daughter and Coheir, the Title and Right of it at this instant, is lodged in Mr. 
Barrow
 of 
Suffolke.


Est-Bridge
 in this Parish, is a second place which exacts our Remembrance. This with 
Honychild
 in St. 
Maryes
 Parish, likewise in 
Romney Mersh,
 did anciently belong part∣ly to the Abby of 
Bradsole ailàs St. Radigunds
 in 
Dover,
 and partly to the Knights of St. 
Jo.
 which upon the general Suppression in the twenty ninnth year of 
H.
 the eighth of all religious Cloisters and Seminaries, were swallowed up in the Demeasne of the Crown, and lay there, till 
E.
 the sixth, granted them in Lease to 
Cuthbert Vaughan
 Esq, who af∣terwards in the fourth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 purchased the Fee-simple of them, of the Crown, and upon his Decease which happened not long after, disposed of 
Honychild,
 to his Son in Law 
Roger Twisden
 Esquire, and 
Est-Bridge,


 to his Wives Son 
Richard Dering
 Esquire, in Right of which original Donation, Sir 
Edward Dering,
 of 
Surrenden Dering
 in 
Pluckley,
 Baronet, great Grandchild of this Mr. 
Richard Dering
 is present Possessor of this Mannor of 
Est-Bridge.


Thirdly 
Silwell
 in this Parish, is not to be omitted, it was in elder Generations an Appendage or Limbe, which made up the Body of that plentifull Income, which appertained to the Abbey of 
Boxley,
 in this County, and upon the Disso∣lution, was (with much other of the Church Demeasn▪ by 
Henry
 the eighth) granted to 
Walter Henley
 Esquire, after created Sir 
Walter Henley,
 and one of the Privy Councell to 
Henry
 the eighth, and 
Edward
 the sixth. But as though there had been some fatall malediction, which like original Sin did cleave to the Posses∣ssion, he left no Issue-male to enjoy that large Patrimony, he had thus archieved, but concluded in three Daughters and Coheirs, 
Elizabeth
 matched to 
William Waller
 of 
Grome-Bridge, Helen
 first married to 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bedgebury
 Esquire, Secondly, to Sir 
George Somerset;
 and Thirdly, to 
Thomas Vane
 of 
Burston
 in 
Hun∣ton
 Esq; and then 
Anne
 wedded to 
Richard Covert
 of 
Slaugham
 in 
Sussex
 Esq; who shared by these matches and alliances, a considerable part of his Inheritance, in which this Man∣nor of 
Sylwell
 was involved.


Newington
 in the Hundred of 
Milton
 has the Addition of 
Lucies
 prefixed before it, to distinguish it from 
Newington,
 in the Hundred of 
Street.
 It was the Ancient Patrimony of the Noble Family of 
Lucy;
 the first whom I find amongst Records of deep Antiquity, was extracted out of 
Normandy:
 within the Precincts of which Province, or upon the Verge and Margent of it, there is a Signory of that Name yet existent. 
G. de Lucy
 (so he is written in the most authentick Copies of the Battle Abby Roll) entered 
England
 with 
William
 the Conqueror. 
Fulbert de Lucy,
 and in some old Registers written Sir 
Fulbert,
 changed his Name of 
Lucy,
 into that of 
Dover,
 when he was by 
William
 the Conqueror made one of the Assistants

to 
John de Fiennes,
 in the Guard of 
Dover-Castle,
 having fifteen Knights Fees as∣signed to him in that Track, for the Support of his Dignity and Trust.

 
William de Dover
 was one of the Magnates or Peers, who was Teste to the Charter of 
Maud
 the Empresse, whereby she creates 
Miles
 of 
Gloucester,
 Earl of 
Hereford. Hugh de Dover
 was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 the eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thir∣teenth, and fourteenth years of 
Henry
 the second. Sir 
Richard de Lucy
 was Lord chief Justice and Protector of 
England,
 in the Raign of the above mentioned Prince, of whom I have more largely discoursed at 
Lesnes
 in 
Erith.

 Aymer de Lucy,
 was with 
Richard
 the first in 
Palestine,
 at the Seige of 
Acon,
 and in Memory of some Signal Service manifested there in that holy Quarrel, added the 
Crosse Crosselets
 unto his Paternal Coat, which was before only three 
Pisces Lucii,
 that is 
Pike Fish. Geffrey de Lucy
 was frequently summoned to sit in Parliament, as Baron, in the Raign of 
Edward
 the first, as the Rols of Summons, which relate to that King's Time, now preserved in the Tower, sufficiently inform us: This 
Geffrey
 with his two Brothers, 
Aymery
 and 
Thomas de Lucy,
 were engaged with 
Edward
 the first, at the Seige of 
Carlaverock
 in 
Scotland,
 in the twenty eighth year of his Raign, and there received the Order of Knighthood. They were Sons to 
Geffrey de Lucy,
 who was constituted High Admiral of 
England,
 in the Time of 
Henry
 the third, as appears 
Pat.
 8. 
Hen.
 3. 
Memb.
 4. 
William
 and 
Anthony Lucy,
 both of this Family, were frequent∣ly summoned to sit in Parliament, as Barons in the Raign of 
Edw.
 the third. In the sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Geffrey de Lucy
 (who held 
Lucy's
 at his Death, which was in the twentieth year of that Monarch) had a Charter of Free-warren to this Man∣nor, which priviledge was renued and confirmed by 
Henry
 the sixth to Sir 
Walter Lucy,
 in the 27. year of his Raign, in which year he dyed, and left his estate here to his Son Sir 
Jeffery Lucy,
 who with his Sole Daughter and Heir 
Mawd Lucy,
 transmitted this Mannor to her Husband Sir 
William Vaux
 of the County of 
North-Hampton,
 whose Son 
Thomas Vaux
 alienated it about the twenty seventh year of the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, to Sir 
Roger Cholmeley
 a younger Branch of the 
Cholmeleys
 of 
Cholmeley
 in 
Cheshire:
 from which Family in our Grand-fathers Memory, it was by Sale passed away to 
Sead,
 and from 
Sead
 by as quick a vicissitude it came over by purchase to 
Osborne,
 by whom not many years since it was sold to 
Pagitt
 of 
London.


Tracies
 is a second place in this Parish, which comes within this List; it was in elder Times the Inheritance of a Family of that Appellation. 
John de Tracy
 was Teste to an old Deed of 
Richard de Lucy,
 which I have seen, wherein he demises some Land to 
William de Frogenhall,
 the Deed is without Date; but by the Anti∣quity of the Character seems to commence from the Raign of 
Henry
 the third: Whether these 
Tracies
 were extracted from the 
Tracies
 of 
Devon
 and 
Gloucestershire,
 or not, I cannot positively determine, because these of 
Kent,
 bore a different Coat from the other, as appears by all old Ordinaries, 
Vid. Argent,
 two 
Bends
 be∣tween nine 
Escollops Gules:
 After the 
Tracies
 had left the possession of this place, which was about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth; the 
Colepepers
 of 
Bedgebury
 were by purchase seised of the Fee-simple of it, but staid not long in the Fruition of it; for in the Raign of 
Henry
 the sixth, the 
Cliffords
 of 
Bobbing
 Court, not far distant; from whom by Sale in the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, it fell under the Signory of 
Thomas Linacre
 Priest.


Frogenhall
 in this Parish likewise was a Branch of that wide Demeasne, which lay diffused in this Territory, and did acknowledge it self to be of the possession of the Ancient Family of 
Frogenhall,
 whose Seat was in 
Frogenhall
 in 
Tenham:
 but whether this were the Land which I mentioned to be by Deed transmit∣ted to 
William de Frogenhall,
 in the time of 
Henry
 the third, by Sir 
Richard de Lucy,
 I cannot positively determine, though it was probable it was, and that afterwards, as was usuall in those Times, to perpetuate the Memory of the Possessor, 
William de Frogenhall.
 fixed his own Name upon it. And in this Family did the Pos∣session continue, till 
Thomas Frogenhall
 concluded in three Co-heirs, of which 
Elizabeth
 was one, who matched with 
John Northwood
 of 
Milton,
 and so linked it to the Inheritance of that Family, where it had not long remained when a sem∣blable Fatality brought this Family likewise to expire in Daughters and Co-heirs; so that this place came by 
Joane,
 one of them, to be the Fee-simple of Sir 
John Norton,


but was not long resident in this Family; for he, about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, conveyed it to 
Thomas Linacre
 Priest, above mentioned, who dying in the seventeenth year of the above-recited Prince, gave both 
Tracies
 and 
Frogenhall
 for ever to augment the Revenue of 
All-souls
 Colledge in 
Oxford.


The Mannor of 
Newington
 it self belonged (as an Ancient Manuscript, now in my Custody, informs me) to a Nunnery which was erected here in this Parish, but by whom it was founded or endowed is unknown: only this Manuscript I mentioned before, rehearses a direful Tragedy, which it cites, as is pretended, out of 
Thorn
 the Chronicler of St. 
Augustins,
 and other old Manuscripts: It was this. Divers of the Nuns being warped with a malitious Desire of Revenge, took the advantage of the Night, and strangled the Lady 
Abbesse,
 who was the Object of their Fury, and passionate Animosities, in her Bed; and after, to conceal so execrable an Assassination, threw her Body into a Pitt, which afterwards contracted the traditional Appellati∣on of 
Nun-pitt;
 but this barbarous offence being not long after miraculously dis∣covered (the Manuscript does not intimate how;) King 
Henry
 the third, in whose Time this Tragedy was acted, seised this Mannor into his Hands, and having by Consent of the Church transmitted the Nuns, who were culpable, to the secular power, by Death to make expiation for this Crime; he sent the Guiltless Nuns into 
Shepey,
 and after filled their Cloister with seven secular Canons: four of which not long after (as if some secret Impiety had lurked in the Wals of the Covent) murdered one of the Fraternity; upon which the King seises this Mannor a∣gain into his Hands, which he had before given back to the support of this new instituted Seminary: two parts of which laying in the Hamlet of 
Thetham
 by the two guiltlesse Canons, with the approbation of 
Henry
 the third, were assigned to the Abby of St. 
Augustins
 (though some Writings more Ancient affirm them to be given under the Notion of two Prebendaries to that Covent) by 
William
 the Conqueror; and the other five parts of this Mannor, were by the abovesaid 
Henry
 the third, granted to his Lord Chief Justice, Sir 
Richard de Lucy,
 whose Son 
Almericus de Lucy,
 saies the Manuscript, did in the year 1278. exchange them with the Monks of St. 
Augustins.
 And thus was this Mannor fastned to the Patrimony of the Church, and so continued, till the General Dissolution in the Time of 
Henry
 the eighth dis∣united it, and linked it afterwards to the possession of the Crown, in whose De∣measne till the Death of the late King 
Charles,
 it lay, ever since the first suppression, involved.


At this Parish of 
Newington,
 not long since were digged up many 
Roman
 Urns, not far distant from the high way or common passage, it being agreeable unto 
Ro∣man
 practice to interre in those places, where their Monuments might be obvious almost to every Eye, Memorials of themselves, and Memento's of Mortality un∣to living Passengers, whom the Epitaphs of great ones were fain to beg to stay and look upon them. Some of these were of a larger, and some again of a nar∣rower Capacity, it being Customary amongst the 
Romans,
 for the Servants and Clients to obtain Repositories for their Remains in Urns of a lesser; for the Masters and Patrons to slumber in Urns of a more wide and spatious Dimension: and many were so curious, that they contrived vast Family-Urns to continue their living Re∣lations, wherein the Ashes of their nearest Kindred and Friends, at least some par∣cels of them might, as in some common Exchequer, be treasured up, that so the Union in Life might be multiplyed and inforced by an amicable Correspondence, even in the place of Sepulture; thus the Ashes of 
Domitian
 were mingled with those of 
Julia,
 and those of 
Achilles
 slept in the same Urn with those of his 
Patroclus.
 That this Usage or Practice of the 
Romans
 extracted its pedigree from 
Greece
 is ma∣nifest: For all Authors that have taken a Prospect of the 
Graecian
 Rites of Funerals, consent that those of 
Megara
 shut up the Bones of four or five Persons in the narrow Confines of one Repertory, or Sepulchral-Urn. It is farther observable, that these Urns discovered at 
Newington,
 were several of them embroidered with particular Inscriptions; one had 
Severianus pater
 insculped upon it, another was en∣dorsed with 
Priscian,
 and a third with 
Fulvius Linus;
 this also was usual amongst the 
Romans,
 not only to superscribe the Names of those whose Remains were lodged within, but likewise sometimes to devote their Dust to those Deities they

called Topical Gods, such as were here, 
Deus Viterineus, Deus Moguntis, Deus Mounus, Dui Civitatis Brigantum, Camulus Deus Sanctus, Gadunus, &c.
 Some∣times they endorsed 
D. M.
 that is, 
Diis Manibns,
 and then we often meet with 
Patera's,
 or Sacrificing Dishes, Lachrymatories, Vessels of Oile, and other Aro∣matical Libations, which Age and a long Date of Time had condensed into the Consistence of Gellies; sometimes again their Urns were placed or situated near some Bound or Land-mark, and then their Ashes inclosed, were consecrated to the peculiar Protection of 
Deus Terminus,
 and were cloistered in a Repository or Vessel, much in Figure or Resemblance like a 
Roman
 Urn, but only the Cover was more wide and deep at Top, and this they styled 
Arca Finalis.
 Besides these at 
Newington,
 there are many other Examples of such endorsments amongst the 
Ro∣mans;
 I shall cull out some few, 
Marcus Plautius
 who slew himself for the Love of his Wife 
Orestilla,
 who deceased at 
Tarentum
 in her passage to 
Asia,
 that so he might accompany her in Death, as he had done in Life, had his Ashes blended to∣gether with hers in one Urn, whilst this Superscription without adorned their ming∣led Dust, 
The two Lovers.
 Not many years since there was digged up near 
Cog∣geshall
 in 
Essex
 an Urn, which offered up to the Spectator's View this Inscription, 
Coccilli M.
 that is, 
Coccilli Manibus.
 And not many years before at the 
Bath
 was re∣presented to publick Inspection, an Urn, with this Endorsment insculped, 
Vibia Jucunda An. XXX hîc sepulta;
 I could discover more of this Nature; But I return. In these 
Newington
 Urns, as my Intelligence instructs me, there were traced out many peeces of 
Roman
 Coin, it being Customary amongst that Nation, not only to inclose Coin or Mony, both of Consulary and Imperial Stamp, by which the Date of their Friends Decease, might be hinted to an Intelligent Observation; but like∣wise Fragments of those Things the Deceased in his Life Time did particularly af∣fect, as namely, Spear Heads, peeces of Darts and Swords, broken Armor, the Cassis or Helmet, Shields, Goblets, Berill Rings, besides a great Number of Gems, with Heads of Gods and Goddesses, and the pourtraiture of several Crea∣tures, fashioned out of Agat and Amber. Now if any will inquire of me, When this Custome of burning the Dead, and after depositing their Dust in Sepulchral Urns, became to be in Use amongst the 
Romans?
 I confess I am satisfied the Time is incertain, though I dare positively aver, it was originally transported from 
Greece,
 where it was used though with more formality, long before it was adopted into the Usages of this Nation. For first the 
Graecians
 burned only the Bodies of those of more eminent Account, but denied it to those who were of baser Allay, or of ob∣scurer Fame; as likewise they did to deceased Infants; to those who were blasted or destroyed with Lightning, because they superstitiously conceived them enemies to the Powers above; to those who had impiously laid violent hands upon them∣selves; and lastly, to those who had by a perfidious Apostasie, declared themselves to be Desertors and Betrayers of their Country. Secondly, they burned only the flesh of the Body, reserving the Bones to be laid up in Chests or Repertories, which they called 
Thecae,
 which amongst the 
Romans
 had the Title of 
Ossuaria,
 bestowed on them. Thirdly, they esteemed it so great an Honor for any person to sleep in his owne Native Countrey, that if he deceased in any Forrain Region, which was in Amity with them, they there, after their Customary Manner burned his Body, and with much Solemnity transported his Reliques to the place of his Nativity, and at every Crosse Way had their appointed Feasts, which were made at the Expence of the Re∣lations and Friends of the Defunct, which they called their 
Compitalia.
 Lastly, they strewed Flowers on the Urns and Repositories of the Dead, and adorned them with Ribands, as they did the Urn of 
Philopaemen;
 but they more particularly affe∣cted the strewing of Myrtle, and Amaranthus, on the Ashes of their departed Rela∣tions, as the 
Romans
 did that of the Rose; yet both of them did concur in the Com∣position of the Funeral Pile, which was furnished and made up of Rosemary, La∣ryx, Yew, Cypresse, and Firre, wherein it is probable were couched some tacit Hints of their surviving Hopes; and in which mysterious Hieroglyphicks, as being Trees which were perpetually verdant, were wrapped up some secret Inferences of a future Resurrection. That this Custome of Burning the Dead did afterwards by an universal Imitation extend and spread it self to other Nations. That the 
Druids
 and

ruling Priests were accustomed to burn their Dead is expressed by 
Pomponius:
 That they held that practise in 
Gaule, Caesar
 expresly delivers: That burning the Dead was used in 
Sarmatia,
 is affirmed by 
Gaguinus:
 That the 
Swedes
 and 
Gothlanders
 did frequently commit their Princes and more eminent Persons to the Fire, is de∣livered by 
Saxo
 and 
Olaus:
 That this was the old 
German
 practise, is also asserted by 
Tacitus.
 And that it was customary amongst the 
Danes,
 Several Urns, discovered in 
Jutland
 and 
Sleswick
 not many years since, do easily evince, which contained not only Bones, but many other Substances in them, as Knives, peeces of Iron, Brass and Wood, and one of 
Norway
 a Brass guilded Jews-harp. When this Custome of Burning of the Dead languished into Disuse, is incertain; but that it began to va∣nish, upon the Dawning of Christianity, as Vapors and Mists scatter before a Morn∣ing Sun, is without Controversie; but when the Light of it did more vigorously reflect, like a 
Meridian
 Beam, on all the gloomy Corners and Recesses of Paga∣nism and Infidelity; then this Use of Urn-Burial, was wholly superseded, and found a Tomb it self in the more sober and severer practise of Christianity. And thus much shall be said concerning these Urns digged up at 
Newington.


The Mannor of 
Levenoke
 in this Parish ought in the last place to be taken Notice of; but the Deeds being dispersed into the Hands of those who are Strangers both to this County and my Design, I cannot give the Reader that satisfaction in this particular that I aime at. Only thus much I can inform him, that by an old Court Roll in the Hands of Mr. 
Staninough
 of this Parish, lately deceased, I discovered that in the Raign of 
Edward
 the third, and 
Richard
 the second, it was the possessi∣on of 
John Beau Fitz;
 and it is probable by the Heir General of this Name, it de∣volved to 
Arnold
 of 
Rochester:
 and more to fortifie this, some ancient Country people at my being there, did assure me, they had it by Traditional Intelligence from their Predecessors, That that 
Knight
 purchased it of one 
Arnold;
 but of that there is no certainty, only this is positive, that about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, that Knight enjoyed it, and in this Name it remained until almost our Memory, and then it was conveyed to 
Gouldsmith,
 and he alienated it to 
Barrow,
 whose Descen∣dant having morgaged it to Mr. ...... 
Alston
 of 
London,
 he very lately hath trans∣planted all his Right by Sale, into Mr. ........ 
Lisle
 of 
Middlesex,
 now de∣ceased.


Nockholt
 in the Hundred of 
Ruxley,
 was a Branch which was incorporated into the Revenue of the Lord 
Say. William de Say
 died possest of it, in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the third, and from this man was it transmitted to his Grand-child 
Geffrey Say,
 who concluded in a Sole Daughter and Heir, called 
Elizabeth,
 who was married to 
William Fiennes
 Esquire, and so in her Right was 
Nockholt
 united to the possession of this Noble Family; from this man was 
Richard Fiennes
 descended, who enjoyed this Mannor successively from him, and married 
Joane
 the Sole Female heir of 
Thomas
 Lord 
Dacre
 of 
Hurstmonceaux
 in 
Sussex,
 who was extracted from 
Edward
 Lord 
Dacre,
 who was summoned to Parliament by the Title of Lord 
Dacre
 of 
Hurstmonceaux,
 in the Raign of 
Edward
 the second, and in her Right was this man summoned to Parliament by the Name of 
Richard Fiennes
 Lord 
Dacres,
 in the Government of 
Henry
 the sixth. And here did both the Barony of 
Dacre,
 and the Inheritance of 
Nockholt
 continue, till 
Gregory Fiennes
 Lord 
Dacres
 deceased, in the thirty sixth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and left by Testament 
Margaret
 his Sister matched to 
Sampson Lennard
 Esquire, he having no Issue, Heir to his large possessi∣ons, amongst which this Mannor was involved; from 
Sampson Lennard,
 who was created Lord 
Dacres,
 in the second year of King 
James;
 it is now come down by Successive Inheritance to be the instant Patrimony of his Grand-child 
Francis
 Lord 
Dacres
 the present Baron of 
Hurstmonceaux.


There are two other Mannors in this Parish, but of small importance, called 
Brampton,
 and 
Shelleys-court,
 or at 
Ockholt,
 both which had Owners, who engraf∣ted their own Sirname upon them. There is a recital in the 
Book
 of 
Aide,
 of one 
John de Brampton,
 who held Land at 
Nockholt
 and 
Ditton,
 in the Raign of 
Edward
 the first: From this Family, 
Brampton
 came by a Female Heir to be the Inheritance of 
Petley,
 who about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, conveyed it to 
Oliver, alias

Quintin,
 and hath been for almost two Hundred years, as appears by the Eviden∣ces now in the Hands of Mr. 
Robert Oliver,
 of the 
Grange
 in the Parish of 
Ley∣bourn,
 in the Tenure and Possession of that Name and Family.


Shelleys Court,
 called in the Evidences likewise at 
Ockholt,
 was, as high as the Raign of 
Edward
 the third, as the originall Deeds now in the Hands of Mr. 
Rob. Austin
 of 
Bexley
 inform me, the Inheritance of 
Shelley,
 and remained united to the Possession of that Family, till the Government of Queen 
Mary;
 and then by Sale the whole Demise, was passed away by Sir 
John Champneys,
 Lord Maior of 
London,
 by 
William Shelley,
 the last of this Name at this place; from whom it devolved to his Son Sir 
Justinian Champneys,
 who left it to his Son Mr. 
Richard Champneys
 Esquire; and he almost in the Remembrance of that Age we live in, alienated his Concernment in it, to the present Possessor Mr. 
Gooday
 of 
Suf∣folk.


Nonington
 in the Hundred of 
Wingham
 and 
Eastry,
 hath diverse places in it of considerable Repute. The first is 
Fredville,
 called in old Deeds 
Froidville,
 from its bleak and eminent Situation. Times of an elder Inscription, represent it to have been the Possession of 
Colkin,
 vulgarly called 
Cokin,
 who it is probable erected the ancient Fabrick, and brought it into the Shape and Order of an Habitation: this Family was originally extracted from 
Canterbury,
 where they had a Lane which bore their Name, being called 
Colkins
 Lane, and likewise had the Inheritance or Propriety of 
Worth-gate
 in that City. 
William Colkin
 founded an Hospital neer 
Eastbridge,
 which celebrated his Name to Posterity, and was called 
Colkin
's Hos∣pital, he flourished in the Time of K. 
John,
 and was a liberal Benefactor to the Hospitals of St. 
Nicholas,
 St. 
Katharine,
 and St. 
Thomas
 of 
Eastbridge
 in 
Canterbury,
 as is recorded by Mr. 
William Somner,
 in his Survey of that City 
Page
 116. But to proceed: 
John Colkin
 dyed possest of 
Fredvill
 the tenth of 
Edward
 the third, and in his Posterity was the Title resident, untill the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, and then it was conveyed to 
Thomas Charleton;
 and he by a Fine, levyed the second of 
Henry
 the second, transplants his Interest into 
John Quadring,
 in whose Name it made its aboad, untill 
Joan Quadring,
 the Heir General of 
Thomas Quadring,
 this man's Successor, carried the Title along with her to her Husband 
Richard Dryland;
 and he about the latter end of 
Edward
 the fourth, alienated it to 
John Nethersole;
 who by Fine levyed in the second year of 
Richard
 the third, con∣veyed it to 
William Bois
 Esquire, descended from 
I. de Bosco
 or 
de Bois,
 so writ∣ten in some old Copies of the Battle Abby Roll, and in others 
R. de Bosco
 or 
de Bois,
 who entered into 
England
 with 
William
 the Conquerour, which 
William
 had Issue 
Thomas Bois,
 who dying in the raign of 
Henry
 the seventh, left two Sons: to 
Thomas
 his eldest he devised 
Fredville,
 with his Estate there; to 
William
 his youngest, 
Bonington,
 and the Lands annexed to it: so that the eldest had the Fai∣rest, and the youngest the ancient Seat: from 
Fredville
 are streamed out first the 
Boois's
 of 
Hode,
 the second Branch of the eldest House; Secondly those of 
Betshan∣ger;
 Thirdly 
Bois
 of 
Sandwich
 issued out from those of 
Betshanger.
 From 
Boning∣ton
 are extracted the 
Bois's
 of 
Willsborough,
 being the second Branch of the second House; Secondly 
Bois
 of 
Offington,
 and thirdly 
Bois
 of 
Hawkherst:
 From 
Thomas Bois
 above-mentioned is the Title of 
Fredville
 in a successive Line now devolved to his Successor 
Iohn Bois
 Esquire.


Elmington
 is a second place of Note in this Parish. It was made eminent in former Times, by being parcell of the Patrimony of 
Condye
 of 
Condies
 Hall in 
VVitstaple,
 who likewise had some Interest in 
Fredville
 by purchase from 
Colkin,
 which 
VVilliam Condy
 passed away to 
Thomas Charlton
 above-mentioned. Which 
VVilliam
 was Son and Heir to 
Iohn de Condy,
 who dyed possest of 
Elmington
 the fifth of 
September,
 in the forty second year of 
Edward
 the third, and by descendant Right was invested in the Propriety of this place, but enjoyed it not long: for he dying without Issue, 
Robert Grubbe,
 who had married 
Margaret
 Sister and Co∣heir of the abovesaid 
VVilliam,
 entered upon the Possession. But he likewise con∣cluding in two Daughters and Coheirs: 
Agnes
 one of them by matching with 
Iohn Isaack
 annexed this to his Inheritance, and his Successor 
James Isaack,
 about

the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, conveyed it to 
George Guldford
 Esquire, who not long after transmitted the Interest, he had in this place by Sale to 
Betenham;
 in whom, the Possession was but of a frail and narrow Continuance, for from this Family, a Vicissitude like the former, about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, carried it away to Sir 
Christopher Hales,
 and his Son Sir 
James Hales
 not long after, demised it to 
VVilliam Bois
 Esquire, Ancestor to 
Jo. Bois
 of 
Fredville
 Esquire, who now holds the instant Signiory of it.


St. 
Albans
 is a third place in 
Nonington,
 which exacts our Notice: It is called so, because it was wrapped up in the Revenue of the Abby of St. 
Albans,
 and did partake of the like priviledges as that Monastery enjoyed; a Scale of which you may read of, recorded in the late printed 
Monasticum Anglicanum,
 too tedious here to recapitulate: It was in elder Times called 
Esole,
 and was held by one 
Edmund de Akcholt,
 in Knights Service, whose Arms in 
Nonington
 Church, 
videlicet, Quarterly Argent and Azure, over all a Bend componee, Or, and Gules,
 are yet visible and obvious: This Mannor upon the general Dissolution, in the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, being found involved in the Patrimony of the above said Abby, was in the thirty second year of that Prince, granted with all its Appendages to Sir 
Christopher Hales,
 and his Son Sir 
James Hales,
 about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the sixth, conveyed it to 
John Sticker,
 who in the fifth year of that Prince alienated it to Sir 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bedgbery,
 from whom not long after the same mutation trans∣planted it into Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 and he demised the propriety of it by Sale to 
Thomas Hamon
 Esquire, Auncestor to 
Anthony Hamon
 Esquire, who now enjoys the present Signory of it.


At the Borough of 
Wolwich
 in this Parish is a place called 
Oxendens,
 which was the Original Seminary and Fountain of those of that Name and Family in this County.


Ratling
 is another place in 
Nonington
 of principal Note: It contributed in Times of a more Venerable Date both Seat and Sirname to a Family of that Appellation. It would be too tedious and voluminous a Digression to recite all those whom Anci∣ent Records represent to be the possessors of this Place; I shall only take notice of 
Sayer de Ratling,
 Son of Sir 
Robert de Ratling,
 who was the last of the Name who enjoyed it, and had it in Possession at his Decease, which was in the tenth year of 
Richard
 the second, and left 
Joane
 his Daughter and Heir, who was matched to 
John Spicer,
 from whom the 
Spicers
 who were Owners of the Mannor of 
Sherford
 in 
Monks Horton
 in this County, were collaterally extracted: but it appears they were of no long residence at this Place; for this Man and his Name together went out in Co-heirs; so that 
Ratling
 fell under the Dominion of a new Proprietary, for by 
Cicely
 one of them it was knit to the Demeasne of her Husband 
John Izaack
 of 
Blackmanbery
 in 
Bredge,
 and by this Alliance the Title became tied to this Family, till 
Edward Izaack
 this mans Grand-child, in the Raign of 
Henry
 the seventh, by Sale collated his Right in it on Sir 
John Phineux,
 whose Successor in the next Age after, alienated it to 
Nevinson;
 from whom not so many years are yet elapsed, but that almost our Memory may attaque the time of the Sale. By the same Fatality, the Possession and Title was rowled into the enjoyment of the present Owner Sir 
William Cowper.


Oldcourt
 is a third place which may exact our Account, it was anciently parcel of the Demeasne of a good old Family, who derived their Sirname from the Parish of 
Goodneston,
 vulgarly called 
Gonston,
 by no far Distance removed from this place, and continued in an uninterrupted Series, from 
John, William,
 and 
Robert de God∣neston,
 of whom there is frequent mention in private Evidences, and who flourished in the Raigns of 
Henry
 the third, and 
Edward
 the first, as their Dateless Deeds do intimate, until the Raign of 
Edward
 the fourth, possest of this place, and then it went by 
Edith
 Daughter and Heir of 
Edward Godneston,
 in whom the Name was entombed to 
Vincent Engham,
 descended from the 
Enghams
 or 
Edinghams
 of 
Wood∣church,
 from whom it went away by Sale to 
John Sydley
 Esquire, Auditor to 
Henry
 the seventh, who added much to the Splendor and Magnificence of the 
Sydleys
 of 
Southfleet,
 by those additional improvements, with which he encreased the Patri∣mony of that Family. When this Name went out, the next Family which succeeded in the possession of this place by purchase, was 
Wild
 of 
Canterbury,
 descended ori∣ginally

from the 
Wilds
 of the County of 
Worcester,
 where they are entituled to an Extraction of deep Antiquity, whose Successor Sir 
John Wild
 of 
Canterbury,
 in that Age we call our Fathers, passed away his Right in 
Oldcourt
 to 
Mersh,
 who holds the instant Fee-simple of it.


Northbourne
 in the Hundred of 
Eastry,
 was given to 
Christ-church
 in 
Canterbury,
 by 
Eadbald
 King of 
Kent,
 (as the Records of that Church do assert) after his Return to the Christian Faith; for formerly by an open Desertion or Apostacy, he had re∣nounced those Principles of Religion, which originally had been infused into him. And being thus cast into the Revenue of the Church, it remained incorporated in its Patrimony, till the publique Dissolution made by 
Henry
 the eighth, dissevered it, and laid it up in the Lap of the Royal Demeasne, where it continued couched till Queen 
Elizabeth
 first granted it in Lease for Life, to her Foster-brother 
Saunders,
 so he was styled, because his Mother had been her Nurse, upon whose Decease it reverts to the Crown▪ and King 
James
 upon his first Ascending the English Throne, granted the Demeasne to Sir 
Edwin Sandys,


 a Person who had performed some ex∣emplary Service for him upon his first admission to the Scepter of this Nation, which obliged him to this Concession, from whom it is now by Descent transferred to his Grand-child, Son to Colonel 
Sandys,
 who in the late intestine Contests between the King and his two Houses, received a mortal wound in a vigorous encounter be∣twixt him and Prince 
Rupert
 at 
Worcester,
 of which some time after he languished away, and deceased.


There was when 
Leland
 made his Survey of 
Kent,
 which was in the Raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, the Reliques of an old Stone-house, which the Tradition of that Age did affirm to have been the Pallace of the above mentioned 
Eadbald.
 And there was, not many years before the same Author made this perambulation, as he in the same Manuscript does assert, a Wall broken down, by which Hole or Inlet was discovered a little Cell or Chamber into which it opened, where were found the Fragmentary Remains of two Children, who had in that gloomy Repository been (as was then conjectured) for many preceding Ages been mured up; and, which did improve the wonder, in one of these obsolete 
Skeletons
 was descried a stiff Pin of Latine.


Tikenhurst
 in this Parish, now by Corruption of the first Etymology called 
Tick∣nes,
 in elder Times was the Revenue of a Family known by that Sirname; some of whom are Witnesses to Deeds of a very high Date, now in the Hands of Mr. 
Richard Fogge
 of 
Dane-court
 in 
Tilmanston.
 After this Family which had left its Name ingrafted upon this place was worn out, which was before the Raign of 
Henry
 the sixth,

 the 
Stoddards,
 from whom the 
Stoddards
 of 
Modingham
 near 
Eltham,
 were originally extracted, became Possessors of the Fee, and in the Patrimony of this Family was the Title of this Place for several Generations involved, till in our Grand-fathers Memory, it was by Sale transplanted into the Propriety of 
Peyton
 of 
Knowlton,
 so that it is in Right of that Purchase now incorporated into the Income of Sir 
Thomas Peyton
 Baronet, who is the present Lord of the Fee.


Northfleet
 was alwaies a Branch of that Revenue which fell under the Spiritual Signory of 
Christ-church.
 By the Pages of Doomes-day Book, we may take a brief Prospect of what it was in the Time of the Conqueror. 
Northfleet
 (saies that Re∣cord) 
in T. E. R. se defendebat pro VI. Sullingis, & nunc pro V. & est manerium appre∣tiatum XX. & VII.
 
lb.
 That is, 
Northfleet
 in the Time of 
Edward
 the Confessor, did defend it self for six Sullings or Ploughed Lands; but now, that is in the Time of 
William
 the Conqueror, only for five, and upon the appraisment was rated at twenty seven pound; and thus did it continue riveted by the Charters of several Prin∣ces, which had confirmed the Patrimony of 
Christ-church
 in 
Canterbury
 into the Estate of the Church, till that Whitlwind which arose in the Time of 
Henry
 the eighth, threw it into the common Dissolution, and then by publique Authority it was uni∣ted to the Revenue of the Crown, and there was fixed, till the year One thousand six hundred and eight, and then the Title was torn off.


Ifeild, Well, Cosington,
 and 
Shinglewell,
 are four small Mannors which are circum∣scribed within the Limits of this Parish. They were in Ages of a more venerable

Aspect, the Patrimony of 
Hever
 of 
Hever: William de Hever
 had a Charter of Free-warren granted to his Lands at 
Ifield,
 and 
Shinglewell,
 and other Lands in 
Northfleet,
 in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the first, which was renued to 
Thomas de Hever,
 in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, but he left no Heits male, to en∣joy this priviledge; for he and his Name expired in Females, whereof 
Joan
 one of his Coheirs, was espoused to 
Reginald Cobham,
 who was summoned to Parlia∣ment by Writt as Baron of 
Sterborough,
 in the twenty second year of 
Edward
 the third, and the other was matched to 
Iohn Brocas,
 but his Estate at these above∣mentioned places, was upon the Partition annexed to the Patrimony of the Lord 
Cobham;
 from which Family about the raign of 
Henry
 the fourth, it came over to 
Iohn Rykeld,
 who with his Son 
William Rykeld,
 lyes entombed in 
Northfleet
 Church: but it seems this last mentioned 
William,
 deceased without Issue-male, for 
Rose
 his Sole Daughter and Heir, was married to 
Edward Limsey,
 descended from 
Ralph de Limsey,
 who held the Mannor of 
Budbrook
 in 
Warwickshire,
 the twentieth of 
William
 the Conquerour, as is testified by 
Dooms-day
 Book
 and this Man had Issue 
Iohn Limsey,
 to whom 
Ifield Shinglewell,
 and the other two places in right of his Mo∣ther, did successively devolve. But it seems the Title of 
Wells, Cosington,
 and 
Ifield,
 did not long dwell in 
Iohn Limsey;
 for in the first year of 
Richard
 the third, he alienated them to 
Iohn Young;
 from which Family in the middle of the raign of 
H.
 the eighth, they came back again to acknowledge the Signiory of 
Limsey,
 in whom again the Possession was as transitory as formerly; for before the latter end of 
H.
 eighth, they were conveyed to 
Rainsford,
 from whom, about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth
 they were by Sale passed away to Alderman 
Garret
 of 
London,
 and in this Family was the Inheritance lodged, untill allmost those Times which fell under the Cognisance of our Remembrance, and then they were disposed of, by Sale, to 
Child.


Derndale
 is another ancient Seat in 
Northfleet,
 which in old Evidences, some of which are not bounded with any date, is styled 
Derendale,
 as having in elder Times (as it appears by old Deeds) Possessors of that Name; and when they had deser∣ted the Possession, which was before the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, it be∣came the Inheritance of 
William Wangford,
 whose Son 
William Wangford,
 was Ser∣jeant at Law, and a great Benefactor to 
Rochester
 Bridge; and he being his Heir to this place, in the fifteenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, passed it away to 
John
 and 
William Flucke;
 from whom suddenly after it came over by purchase to 
Iohn Rouse,
 descended from 
William Rouse
 of 
Birling,
 whose Son 
Iohn Rouse,
 demised Land in 
Northfleet,
 as appears by an old Deed, to 
Iohn Rouse,
 in the thirty third year of 
Edward
 the third, and this above-mentioned 
Iohn Rouse,
 in the tenth year of 
Ed∣ward
 the fourth, demised his Right in this place to 
Thomas Wombwell,
 and 
Iohn Clifton
 Esquire, and this 
Iohn Clifton,
 dying without Issue, in the year 1471, be∣queaths his Interest in it by Will to 
Thomas VVombwell,
 and he because he was originally extracted, from a place in 
Yorkshire
 called 
Wombwell,
 erected a House here, which he adopted into his own Name, and styled it 
Wombwell
 Hall, which with 
Dernedale
 remained involved in the Possession of this Family, untill some few years the Title was by Sale transplanted into Mr. ......... 
Adye
 Esquire, Counsellor at Law, Son and Heir, to Mr. ........ 
Adye
 of 
Doding∣ton.


Shinglewell
 is another place in 
Northfleet
 which may deservedly be taken Notice of, because 
Hever
 is situated within the precincts of it, which was the Seminary or Seedplot of the ancient Family of 
Hever,
 and though 
Hever
 Castle by rea∣son of its 
Grandeur
 and Magnificence, was their capitall Mansion, yet this was the original Fountain or Cradle, from whence the Family primitively issued forth. 
W. de Hever
 was a person of note, and was engaged with 
R.
 the first at the Seige of 
Acon.
 In the seventh year of the raign of King 
Iohn,
 as appears by the Pipe-rolls of that Time, 
Hugh de Hever,
 and 
Walter de Hever,
 were 
Recognitores magnae Assisae,
 a place if we calculate it for the Meridian of those Times, of a very great Latitude of Power, Trust, and Concernment; for they were looked upon in all Causes either of Criminal or Civill Aspect, as the representative Body of the County; and from them it is possible our present Grand Juries, may seem to extract their first

Institution. 
Richard de Hever
 is found in the 
Kentish
 Register of those, who ac∣companied 
Edward
 the first, in the nineteenth year of his raign to 
New Castle,
 where he summoned the Pretenders to the 
Scottish
 Scepter, to give an Account of the Justice of their Title to that Diadem. 
Thomas de Hever
 obtained a Market to 
Shinglewell,
 and two Fairs, one at 
Michaelmas,
 which was to continue five Dayes, and the second at the Feast of St. 
Lawrence,
 which was to continue three, as ap∣pears, 
Chart.
 4. 
Edw.
 3. 
Num.
 9. After this Family was worn out, the 
Cobhams
 by a Right derived from 
Reginald de Cobham,
 who married 
Joane,
 one of the Co∣heirs of 
William de Hever,
 were invested in the Fee, and from them it passed away by Sale, about the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, to 
Rykeld,
 where the Possession was of no long Date; for 
Rose
 Sole Heir of 
John Rykeld,
 by matching with 
John Limsey,
 united this Mannor of 
Hever
 to his Patrimony, and in this Name was the Title re∣sident, until the midst of the raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was alienated to 
Rainsford,
 and from this Name the like Devolution, about the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 carried it away to 
Garth,
 who almost in our Fathers Memory conveyed it by Sale to Mr. ...... 
Child,
 from whom it is lately come over by pur∣chase to be the Inheritance of Mr. ...... 
Fortree,
 of 
Greenwich.


Norton
 in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 was, as high as I can track, the Inheritance of that Family, whose Sirname was 
de Campania,
 and whose Principal Seat was at 
Champions Court
 in 
Newenham. John de Campania
 had a Charter of Free-warren, granted by Royal Indulgence to his Mannor of 
Norton,
 in the thirty first year of 
Edward
 the first, and when this Name had deserted the Possession, the Title of this place came to own the Signory of 
John Boteler
 of 
Graveney
 Esquire, who flourished in the raign of 
Henry
 the fourth; but, it is manifest, was not very stable in this Name; for, by 
Boteler
 this mans Sole Heir, it was incorporated into the Patrimony of 
John Martin,
 her Husband, afterwards Judge of the Common Pleas; and in this Family was it resident, till the raign of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then it was conveyed away by Sale to 
Finch,
 issued out from the 
Finches
 of 
Groveherst
 in 
Milton.
 But the same Fatality which brought it over to 
Martin,
 carried it away from the Name of 
Finch:
 for this Family in our Grand-fathers Memory determining in a Daughter and Heir, she by matching with 
Sonds
 of 
Sonds
 Place at 
Darking
 in 
Surrey,
 linked 
Norton
 to the Demeasne of that Family; where, after the Possession had some Time been lodged, it went away by Sale, about the latter end of the raign of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 to Mr. 
Thomas Mills
 Esquire, who upon his Decease, which was in the entrance of the raign of King 
Charles,
 by some Addition of Estate still to support the Name, and improve the Luster of the Family, gave it to his Cozen 
Mills
 of 
Sussex,
 who in Right of that Testamentary Donation is the instant Possessor of 
Norton.


Provenders
 is an Ancient Seat in this Parish; once the Mansion of a Family of that Sirname, which though it be long since worn out at this place, yet it is still (under a Character of no despicable Account) in being, in 
Wiltshire;
 where for several Ages last past they have successively setled. I have seen a Deed without Date, which about the raign of 
Henry
 the third, fixes the possession of this place in 
John de Provender,
 and this agrees with 
Sidrach Petits
 Inquisition, who in his curious Survey of several 
Kentish
 Mannors, taken in the twenty eighth year of King 
Henry
 the eighth, re∣presents this place about the Time of 
Henry
 the third, to be in the Tenure of the above-said 
John de Provender.
 After the 
Provenders,
 the 
Quadrins
 were Possessors, and then successively the 
Goldwells
 of 
Goldwell,
 which was in the raign of 
Richard
 the second, were Proprietaties of 
Provenders,
 and remained many years invested in the Signory of it, till the common Devolution of Purchase translated the right of it to 
Dry∣land,
 a Family of much Splendor, and no lesse Estate in this Track: one of which Name, in the raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, passed away his Interest in it by Sale to 
Robert Atwater
 Esquire, Justice of Peace of this County in that Age, and he trans∣mitted it by Sale to Sir 
James Hales,
 Son of Sir 
John Hales,
 from which Family, in the Time of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 it went over by Sale to 
Sayer,
 in which Family, af∣ter the Propriety some few years had rested, it was almost within the Limits of our Remembrance, sold to Mr. 
Hugison
 of 
Dover,
 in Right of which Purchase, after the Decease of her Mother, it is to devolve to Mrs. 
Jane Hugison,
 descen∣ded

from a second Son of this Family, and lately matched to

 Mr. ...... 
Roberts
 of 
Canterbury
 Esquire.


Nutsted
 in the Hundred of 
Acstane,
 was in elder Times couched in the Patrimony of a Family called 
Gravesend,
 which was of no cheap or obscure Account in this Track; for Sir 
Stephen de Gravesend
 is in the Register or Inventory of those Knights which accompanied 
Edward
 the first, in his prosperous Expedition into 
Scotland,
 when by a succesful Reduction, he in the twenty eighth year of his faign subdued the strong Fortress of 
Carlaverock
 in 
Scotland. Richard de Gravesend,
 Bishop of 
London,
 the more to improve the 
Grandeur
 of 
Nursted,
 which then was entituled to his Name and Family, obtained a Charter of Free-warren to this Mannor, in the twenty seventh year of the above-said Prince. In the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Thomas de Gravesend
 died, concerned in an Estate here at 
Nutsted,
 as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 63. 
parte secunda.
 But not all the Mannor, for in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, Sir 
John de Beaumont
 paid respective Aide for Lands which he held at 
Nutsted,
 as appears by the Record, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third. But both these Families, before the end of 
Henry
 the fourth, were dislodged from the possession of this place, and then I find it cast into the Re∣venue of a Family called 
Middleton,
 who were not long Lords of the Fee: for in the raign of 
Henry
 the sixth, I find it in the Tenure of 
Thomas Frowick
 Esquire, and he by a Fine levied, in the thirty eighth year of that Prince, conveyed it to 
Hugh Brent,
 in which Name it was resident, until the beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then it was alienated to 
Martin;
 but 
William Martin
 great Grand-child of 
John Martin
 the Judge, dying without Issue-male, 
Margaret
 his Sole Daughter and Heir linked it unto the Demeasne of her Husband Mr. 
John Rogers,
 in which Family, after it had resided, until that Age which was encircled in our Fathers Remem∣brance, it was passed away by Sale to 
Sidley,
 and Sir 
John Sidley
 of St. 
Cleres
 Knight and Baronet, not many years since by the same Vicissitude conveyed it to 
John Adye
 of 
Dodington
 Esquire.






O. O. O. O.


OFham
 in the Hundred of 
Larkefeild,
 was Anciently divided between two Families 
Corton
 and 
Ditton: Richard de Corton
 held half a Knights Fee at this place, and paid respective Aide for it at making the Black Prince Knight, as ap∣pears by the 
Book
 of 
Aide,
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and 
Ralph de Ditton
 paid an auxiliary Contribution for the other Moity, which likewise was held by half a Knights Fee, at the Investiture above-said; but long it continued not to confess the Signory of these two Families: for 
Codwell
 which was part of the Man∣nor of 
Offham,
 was alienated by 
Richard de Corton
 to 
Thomas de Godchepe,
 and he was in the enjoyment of it at his Decease, which was in the one and thirtieth of 
Edward
 the third. After 
Godchepe
 had deserted the Possession, I find by some old Conrt-rols, that commence from the Raign of 
Henry
 the fourth, that one 
John Melford
 had the Possession, not only of 
Godwell,
 but of 
Snodbean,
 and 
Pepingstraw
 likewise, which his Father purchased of the Heirs of 
Ditton;
 but not long after this, was the Title of those places resident in this Family. For about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, I find one Moiety of them passed away to 
Browne,
 and the other to 
Colepeper:
 in 
Colepeper
 the Propriety remained, until the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then it was demised by Sale to 
John Leigh,
 and he and Sir 
Matthew Browne
 the descendant of 
Browne,
 who was invested by Purchase in the other Moiety, exchanged the whole Mannor with 
Henry
 the eighth, and he grants it to 
William Wilford, John Bennet,
 and 
George Briggs,
 and they in the thirty seventh year of the above-named Prince, convey one Moiety of 
Offham, Snodbean,
 and 
Peping straw,
 to 
John Tufton
 Esquire, Ancestor to the Right Honorable 
John Tufton,
 now Earl

of 
Thanett,
 the instant Possessor of it; And the other Proportion, in which 
God∣well
 was included, to 
Richard Nortop alias Clerk,
 a Name vulgarly impos'd upon him, which was originally borrowed from his Office, as being Clark of the For∣rest of 
Sherwood,
 in the County of 
Nottingham;
 yet this Name hath been so en∣tailed on his Successors, that it is now grown the paternal Appellation of the Family, they having many years wrot 
Clerk aliàs Nortop:
 But I have digressed. The last of this Family was ...... 
Clerk,
 who not long since, concluded in three Daughters and Coheirs: 
Frances
 one of which, was married to Mr. 
Thomas Do∣well
 lately deceased, who by purchasing the other Proportions allotted to his Wifes Sisters, hath now entituled the other Moietie of the Mannor of 
Offham,
 to his Descen∣dant now surviving.


The vulgar Tradition of this Parish, is, that 
Jack Straw
 that eminent Incendi∣arie of the 
Kentish
 Commons in the raign of 
Richard
 the second (who with 
Wat Tiler,
 who was born at 
Dartford,
 were the two principal Emissaries, which did foment and manage that portentous Commotion, which then brake forth like an Inundation, and threatned to over-whelme the abovesaid Prince) was born in a small Cottage, at 
Pepingstraw
 in this Parish, from whence he assumed his Sirname.


Ore
 in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 was, as the Book called 
Feoda Militum
 kept in the Exchequer, informs me, in the thirty eighth year of 
Henry
 the third, the Inheritance of 
Reginald de Cornhill,
 but it seems was by a Distance of no long Time constant to this Family; for in the raign of 
Edward
 the first, it became the Patrimony of 
Savage
 of 
Bobbing
 Court: for in the twenty third year of the above recited Prince, 
John de Savage
 obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of 
Ore,
 as it lay involved in his other Demeasnes, to which that Fran∣chise was granted in the Bulk or General. After 
Savage
 was worn away at this place, the 
Norwoods
 of 
Norwood
 in 
Milton,
 were established in one Moiety of it by purchase, and the 
Alephs
 of 
Colshall
 in 
Iwade,
 by the same Vicissitude were plan∣ted in the other; 
Northwood
 demised his Proportion by Sale to 
Tomlin,
 who for above an Hundred year, down till this instant, has been setled in the Possession; and the other Moiety did augment the Dowry of 
Margaret
 Daughter and Heir of 
Thomas Aleph,
 who was wedded to 
John Monins
 Esquire, whose Successor Sir 
William Monins,
 passed it away to 
Short
 of 
Tenterden,
 to which Family the Interest of that part of 
Ore,
 which was sold by 
Monins,
 is at this present uni∣ted.


Orpington
 in the Hundred of 
Rokesley,
 was in the twentieth year of 
William
 the Con∣querour, wrapped up in the Ecclesiastical Patrimony, and belonged to the Monks of 
Christ-church,
 and if you will make an Inspection into the Pages of 
Dooms∣day
 Book, and consult that general Register, you will find it at that Time thus rated: 
Orpindun,
 says the Record, 
est Manerium Monachorum, & de Vestitu e
rum, & in T. E. R.
 (that is, in the Time of King 
Edward
 the Confessor)

 XXV.

 From this Record I observe that 
William

Norman,
 sirnamed the Conquerour, possessing himself of the English Scepter and Diadem, by an infirme and crazy Title, sought afterwards to fortifie and improve it, by a soft Compliance with the Clergie, who had then the most powerfull Influence, on the Consciences of the Vulgar; and therefore where he found their Revenue moderately taxed in the Time of the Confessor, he confirms it, and where in his Estimate the Gabell or Imposition was scrued or wound up too much, he abates and mollifies it, by these Engagements perpetually for the future, to oblige and endear them, to assert and maintain his new atchieved Roy∣altie. But to return to my Discourse: In times of a more recent Inscription, that is, in the seventh year of King 
John,
 the Prior and Monks of 
Christ-church,
 obtained a Market to this their Mannor, to be observed weekly on the Wed∣nesday, as appears 
Carta de Anno septimo R. Joannis Memb. secund.
 with which Franchise it continued invested, untill the twenty ninth of 
Henry
 the eighth, and

then being by the Monks abovesaid with the Residue of their Revenue into the Hands of that Prince, it remained with the Crown untill the thirty second year of his Government; and then it was granted to 
Pereivall Hart,
 of 
Lullingston
 Esq; to whose pious and charitable Beneficence, the Almes Houses at this place, owe their original Foundation; and from him is the Propriety of it, now descended to his great Grandchild 
Will. Hart
 Esq.


Crofton
 in this Parish, did formerly swel into so much of Grandeur, and populacy that it was known for a Parish of it self, till by Fire it was entombed in its present Deso∣lations, and by the Violence of that wild and impetuous Element, reduced into a Heap of Flame and Ruines; and certainly those deplorable Remains which yet expose themselves to an Inquisitive Eye, and the Groundsells too, and scattered Foundations of Houses, which the Plough often raises, out of their Sepulcher of Rubbish, and represents to the publick View, do evince this Truth to us, that Towns and Villages, have their stated Period of Duration, and must at length find a Grave like Men. But though this Village be shrunk into this disordered Heap, yet still it preserves the Reputation of a Mannor, which it had anciently, when it was the Inheritance of 
Wibourn,
 a Family in elder Times of high Esteem, and a considerable Revenue in this Territory. 
Ralph de Wibourn
 held Lands here, and in other places of 
Kent,
 as appears by sundry ancient Deeds now in the Possession of 
Wibourne
 of 
Halkewell,
 in the raign of 
Edward
 the first; and did after execute a Deed, for Land in 
Wrotham
 Hundred, in the tenth year of 
Edward
 the second. And in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
John de Wybourne,
 paid respective Aid for his Lands here and at other places in this County, at the making the Black Prince Knight; after 
Wibourne
 had relinquished the Possession of this place, which was about the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, it went away by Sale to Sir 
Robert Belknap,
 who was attainted and banished, by that Factious Parliament, which was held in the tenth year of 
R.
 the second, for vigorously endevouring to vindicate and as∣sert his Prerogative, against the Invasions and Inroads which some of the turbulent Nobility of those times did attempt to make upon it: but this, though forfeited and escheated to the Crown upon his pretended Treason, was by 
Richard
 the second restor'd to 
Hamon Belknap
 Lord of 
Oston
 in the County of 
Warwick,
 and from him it was by Descent transferred to 
John Belknap
 his Son, who upon his Decease which was in the fifteenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, bequeathed it to Sir 
Henry Belknap,
 who determined in three Daughters and Coheirs, 
Alice
 married to Sir 
William Shelley, Anne
 matched to Sir 
Robert Wotton,
 and 
Elizabeth
 first wedded to Sir 
Philip Cook
 of 
Giddy-Hall
 in 
Essex,
 and after to 
I eonard Dannett
 of the County of 
VVorcester,
 who divided his Patrimony; but this upon ballancing the partition of the Estate, fell upon the poising of it in e∣quall portions, to be the Demeasn of Sir 
VVill. Shelley,
 who demised it by Sale to Sir 
Rob. Read
 Lord Chiefe Justice of the Kings Bench, and he in the raign of 
Henry
 the seventh, passed it away by Grant, to the Hospital of the 
Savoy
 in 
'London,
 where it has ever since, without any Interruption of the first Donation, remained successively resident.


Bark-hart
 has obtained a place in the Map of 
Kent,
 and therefore shall not want one in this Discourse. It was built by 
Percivall Hart
 Esquire, Father to the late Sir 
Percivall:
 but it was adorned with this Name by Queen 
Elizabeth,
 when she was magnificently entertained at this place, by the above said Gentleman. Upon her Reception, she received her first Caresses by a Nymph, which persona∣ted the Genius of the House, then the Scene was shifted, and from several Cham∣bers, which, as they were contrived, represented a Ship, a Sea Conflict was offe∣red up to the Spectator's View, which so much obliged the Eyes of this Princesse, with the Charms of Delight, that upon her Departure, she left upon this House (to perpetuate the Memory both of the Author and Artifice) the Name and Appella∣tion of 
Bark-hart.


There is a Tradition that 
Thomas de Beckett,
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 was born at 
Tubbingden,
 whose Demeasne is partly situated in 
Ferneborough,
 and part∣ly in this Parish. But to dissipate this received Fiction, I shall manifest out of an old Parliament Roll, of the thirty first year of 
Henry
 the sixth, the original Truth, that is, so much of it as concerns his Cradle or place of Nativity. The

Record in its own Dialect, speaks thus. 
James
 Earl of 
Wiltshire,
 and 
Ormond,
 whose Fader, and many of his Ancestors are lineally descended of the Blode of the glorious Martyr St. 
Thomas,
 sometimes Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury.
 The which glorious Martyr was born of his Moder, within the Ground where now is set the House or Hospital of the said Martyr, called St. 
Thomas Acres,
 now in the City of 
London,
 where the Body of the said Earl lies buried, and Dame 
Joane Beauchamp,
 late Lady of 
Burgavenny,
 Crandame to the said Earl of 
Ormond
 and 
Wiltshire.
 For 
Tubbenden
 it self; it was Anciently the Demeasne of a Family which was known by that Sirname: for by a Deed now in the Hands of Mr. 
Wittingham Wood
 of 
Can∣terbury
 Esquire, it appears 
Gilbert Saundre
 of 
Crofton
 did demise several parcels of Land to 
John de Tubbenden
 of 
Ferneborough,
 and to 
Richard, Philip, John,
 and 
Robert
 his Sons, in the twenty first year of 
Edward
 the first, which justifies it Anciently to be the Possession of one of that Name. After 
Tubbenden, Belknap
 was Proprietary of this place, and then successively by 
Alice,
 his Co-heir Sir 
William Shelley
 of 
Michelgrove
 in 
Sussex:
 from which Family it was brought down by Purchase in the beginning of the raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, to be the Estate of 
Posier,
 who after some few years continuance in the Possession, demised his Concernment in it by Sale to 
Dalton
 issued out from the 
Daltons
 of 
Yorkeshire,
 which Name suddainly re∣solved into a Female Heir, known by the Name of 
Anne Dalton,
 who by matching with 
Aunsell Beckett,
 linked it to the Demeasne of that Family: from whom it des∣cended to his Son 
Matthew Beckett,
 who upon his Decease bequeathed it to Mr. 
John Winterborn
 of 
London,
 who hath lately passed it away to Mr. ...... 
Gee
 of the County of 
Yorke
 Esquire.


St. 
Mary Crey
 in the Hundred of 
Rokesley,
 though it be a Market Town, yet is but a Chap
el of Ease to 
Orpington.
 Before the Conquest, one 
Elfgat
 held it (as 
Doomes-day
 Book which makes a Recapitulation of the first Owners informs us) of the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury:
 In the Conqueror's Time, 
Hugh
 Nephew of 
Herbert
 Bishop of 
Baion,
 possest it under the Notion of a whole Knights Fee. In Ages of a more modern Date, that is, in the raign of 
Henry
 the third, 
John de Maries
 descended from 
Thomas de Maries,
 who accompanied 
Richard
 the first to the Seige of 
Acon,
 enjoyed a whole Knights Fee at 
Ackmere
 and 
Sentling,
 two emi∣nent Mannors in this Parish, but about the beginning of 
Edward
 the first, had de∣serted the Possession and surrendered it to 
Gregory de Rokesley,
 Grand-child to 
John de Rokesley,
 who likewise was embarked with 
Richard
 the first, at the Seige of 
Acon;
 and he, in the ninth of 
Edward
 the first, obtained the Grant of a Market on the Wednesday, and a three Dayes Faire at the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin 
Mary,
 to St. 
Mary Crey,
 as appears 
Pat.

Edw.

Richard de Rokesley,
 who dying in the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the second, with∣out Issue-male by 
Agnes,
 one of his Daughters and Co-heirs to 
Thomas de Poynings,
 in which Name it continued, until the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, and then I find it possest by Sir 
Robert Belknap,
 who was attainted in the tenth year, and ba∣nished into 
Ireland
 for too vigorously attempting to boulster up the Majesty and Prerogative of that Prince, against the Assaults and invasions which were made upon it by a Factious Junto of the Nobility; yet it was suddainly after restored to his Posterity: for in the ninteenth of 
Richard
 the second, I find 
Hamon Belknap
 reseated in the Possession, by the Royal Concession and Indulgence of that Prince, and from him it did devolve to his Grand-child Sir 
Henry Belknap,
 which Family being enterred in Daughters and Co-heirs, Sir 
Robert Wotton
 by matching with 
Anne,
 that was one of them, entituled himself in her Right to the Inheritance of both these Places, and so by the Thread of a continued Descent, was it brought down to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Wotton,
 who settled them in Marriage upon his eldest Daughter and Co-heir Mrs. 
Katherine Wotton,
 who was espoused to 
Henry
 Lord 
Stanhop,
 Heir ap∣parent to 
Philip
 Earl of 
Chesterfeild.


Orlanston
 in the Hundred of 
Hamme,
 was the Inherirance of a Family of that Sirname. 
William de Orlanston
 is registred in the List of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who assisted 
Richard
 the first, at the Siege of 
Acon. William de Orlanston
 his Son

held it, in the raign of 
Henry
 the third, and obtained a Charter of Free-warren to it, in the one and fiftieth year of 
Henry
 the third, and more to improve the Grandeur of this his Mannor, with Additional Franchises, he likewise obtained a Market to be weekly observed here, and a Fair yearly, which was to continne by the space of three Dayes, at the Feast of 
Holyrode,
 as appears,

John Kemp
 Arch-bishop of 
Yorke,
 and after of 
Canterbury,
 in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the sixth. 
Willi∣am de Orlanston,
 this mans Grand-child, was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the second year of 
Edward
 the third, and had the Custody of the County some part of the year following, and died the thirty eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, and had Issue Sir 
John Orlanston,
 who was Burgess for 
Romeney,
 as appears by some old Records in 
Dover
 Castle, sundry Times, both in the raign of 
Edward
 the third, and 
Richard
 the second, and matched with the Daughter and Heir of Sir 
William at Capell,
 from which Alliance proceeded 
Richard Orlanston
 Esquire, who died possest of 
Orlanston,
 in the seventh year of 
Henry
 the fifth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 16. and left his Inheritance to be divided between his two Sisters and Co-heirs, 
Margaret
 matched to 
William Parker
 of 
Parkers
 in 
Werehorne,
 and 
Joane
 espoused to 
William Scott
 of 
Scotts Hall,
 who upon the Partition of the Ancient Patrimony, was invested in his Wife's Right, in this Mannor of 
Orlanston;
 from whom the Clew of many Descents hath trans∣ported the Propriety to the instant Possessor, Mr. 
Edward Scott
 of 
Scotts Hall
 Esquire.


Here were Lands divorced from this Place by no far Distance, called 
Oswareston:
 for I find 
Henry
 Earl of 
Augie,
 gave to the Monks of 
Bermondsey
 in 
Southwarke
 his Lands called 
Oswareston
 near 
Romelin,
 in the Parish of 
Lyda,
 and the Lands of 
John
 the Clerk in 
Bilsington,
 of which see 
Vincents
 Book of Nobility, 
Fol.
 190.


Westbery
 in this Parish, was, as high as the private Evidences of this Place can give us any Prospect to discover, the Propriety of a Family called 
Prisott,
 who was planted here as high as the Raign of 
Henry
 the fourth, and tis probable much higher, though the Deeds reach no farther. Of this Family was Sir 
John Prisot
 the Judge, of whom there is frequent mention in our Law Books, which have an Aspect upon the Raign of 
Henry
 the sixth, and in this Name was the Title of this Mannor car∣ried down to the eighth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was by 
Thomas Prisot
 passed away by Sale to 
George Hount,
 in whom the Possession had not many years been resident, but the same Fatality brought it over to 
Reginald Strogle,
 who was in the Commission of the Peace, in the Raign of 
Edward
 the sixth, and was des∣cended from a Family which was of a very high Original in 
Romney-Mersh,
 where there are some Lands yet which bear their Name. After 
Strogle
 had left it, it came by Purchase to Mr. 
Bennet Guildford,
 a Branch of the 
Guildfords
 of 
Hempsted,
 who in the beginning of the Raign of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 falling under the Censure and Penalty of a 
Pramunire,
 for refusing the Oath of Supremacy, and flying beyond Sea, forfeited this place to the Crown, and this Princesse immediately after passed it away by Grant to 
Walter Moile
 of 
Buckwell,
 from whom not many years after this original Concession, it went away by Sale to Mr. 
Francis Bourne,
 Grand-father to Mr. ...... 
Bourne
 the present Proprietary of it.


Ospringe
 in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 was anciently a Limb or Appendage of the Royal Revenue, until King 
Edward
 the thind, in the tenth year of his Raign, by Royal Concession or Grant, passed it away to 
John de Pultency,
 afterwards Lord Mayor of 
London,
 to hold it in Fee of the Crown, by the Service of a Rose, offe∣red up or presented as a Symbol of Annual Fealty, and with this Mannor he granted him likewise all the Advousons of-Churches, which formerly related to it, to hold in Soccage only by the former acknowledgement. In the nineteenth year of his Raign, the above said Prince grants this 
John de Pulteney,
 that 
Thomas
 Son of 
Willi∣am de Dene
 should be accountable to him for all those Knights Fees which lay in 
Throuley, Boughton, Malherbe,
 and 
Wormesell,
 and held of 
Queen Court
 and 
Ospringe:
 de died possest of both these places, in the twenty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third, as appears, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 43. and left them to his Kinsman Sir 
Nicolas Loveine
 (though some part of the Demeasne belonged to 
Poulteney,
 until the ninth year of

Edward
 the fourth) which Sir 
Nicholas
 obtained a an Exemplification by Patent in the thirty eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, how many Knights Fees which lay divided and dispersed into severall places, belonged to his Mannor of 
Ospringe;
 this Sir 
Nicholas
 had Issue 
Nicholas Loveyne,
 and 
Margaret Loveyne; Nicholas
 her Brother deceased without Issue, and so 
Philip St. Clere
 of 
Aldham St. Clere,
 who had matched with this his Sister, became his Heir, and she was found to be pos∣sest of these places at her Death, which was in the tenth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and in her Right did it descend with 
Queen Court,
 (which was leased out by 
Nich. Loveyne
 to 
Nicholas Potin,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 the twenty first of King 
R.
 the second, and held his Shrievalty at this place) to 
Thomas St. Clere
 who held it at his Decease, which was in the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 46. But after his Departure, I do not find it long knit to the Demeasn of his Family; for about the beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, I find it in the Possession of 
William Cheyney
 of 
Shurland
 Esquire, and from him was the Title of 
Ospringe
 and 
Queen Court
 derived by successive Right to his Grandchild 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney,
 who about the thirteenth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 passed them away to Mr. 
Rich. Thornehill,
 Great Grandfather to Mr. 
Richard Thornehill,
 Son and Heir of Colonel 
Richard Thornhill
 who is at this instant Proprietarie of it.


Plomford
 and 
Bavell,
 are two little Mannors in 
Ospringe,
 which belonged partly to the Nunnery of the 
Minster
 in 
Shepey,
 and partly to the Abby of 
Feversham,
 which upon the Suppression of those two Cloisters, were granted by King 
Henry
 the eighth, to 
Thomas Colepeper
 Esquire, and he not long after, alienated them to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney,
 whose Son 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney,
 passed them away in our Grand∣fathers Memory to 
Greenstreet
 of 
Clacksfield
 in 
Borden,
 and are still wrapt up in the In∣heritance of that Family.


The 
Maison le Dieu
 here at 
Ospringe,
 was founded by 
Lucas de Vienna,
 for the Knights Templers, and was one of those Mansions, where they reposed them∣selves in their progresse towards their other Demeasne, which lay spread into 
East-Kent,
 and 
Romney Mersh.
 The Revenue which was to support this Seminary, lay at 
Lurdenden
 in 
Challock,
 and at 
Hokeling, Radymersh, Ryde
 and other places in the Isle of 
Shepey.
 In the twenty fifth of 
Henry
 the third, 
Roger de Lingsted
 had a Grant of these Lands, for Terme of Life, as likewise of all the Fishery Messu∣ages, Reliese, Revenue, and Homage appertaining to them, as appears 
Pat. Anno
 25. 
Henrici tertii, Memb.
 30. In the forty second, and fifty first of 
Henry
 the third, there was a Confirmation of Land and Priviledges to this House, and in this Condition it continued, partly under the Knights Templers, and in lower Ages, under the Knights Hospitallers, untill the Tempest of the generall Disso∣lution, shook it into that neglected heap of Ruines, wherein at present the ancient Fabrick is visible.


Elverland
 in this Parish is a Mannor which for many Generations hath been annexed to the Demeasn of St. 
Johns
 Colledge in 
Cambridge.


Selgrave
 now corruptly called 
Selgrove,
 is another Mannor in 
Ospringe:
 It was a Branch of that large Inheritance, which lay scattered ore the Face of this Terri∣tory, and acknowledged the Dominion of the noble Family of 
Norwood: Roger de Northwood
 held it at his Decease, which was in the thirteenth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 25. And transmitted it to his Son 
Roger de Norwood,
 after whom I do not find the Possession was long permanent in this Family: for about the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, 
Ralph de Spigurnell,
 was concerned in it as Proprietarie, and he bequeathed it to his Wife 
Elizabeth Spigurnell,
 who sold it to 
John Winchelsey,
 and the Convent of 
Christ-church
 in 
Canterbury,
 in the six∣teenth year of 
Richard
 the second, in whom the Fee-simple continued, untill it was wrested away by the Generall Dissolution in the raign of 
Henry
 the eighth: and then that Prince, passed it by Grant to 
George Barley,
 who not many years after alienated his Interest in it to 
Sonds
 of 
Throuley,
 from whom in our Fathers Memory, it came by Sale to 
Cleve.


Ospringe,
 had anciently a House or 
Maison le Dieu
 so called, because it was a Receptacle for Leprous people, and other persons afflicted and assaulted with Dis∣eases, which in Times of elder Inscription, were still esteemed to be imposed by the

Finger of the Divinity, and this had a Confirmation of ample Immunities, and Li∣berties by Patent in the forty seventh, and which were renued in the fifty first year of 
Henry
 the third.


Otford
 in the Hundred of 
Codsheath,
 was given to the Church and Sea of 
Can∣terbury,
 by 
Offa
 King of the 
Mercians
 in the year 785, to expiate the Guilt of that Blood, which he had before drawn from the Veins of 
Aleric
 and his 
Kentish
 Men, in a Battell waged at this place, in the year 774, and which was aggravated because those he had slaughtered, had their Names enrolled in the Re∣gister of Christians. And which was granted in the originall Donation, 
ad Pascua Porcorum,
 to the Pannage of those Hoggs that fed in the Arch-bishops Chase; and in the Revenue of this Sea, was the Interest of this Mannor treasu∣red up, till about the Beginning of the Rule of 
Henry
 the eighth; and then some envious Eyes looking about with Regrett and Desire, upon the Diffused Patrimo∣ny of the Church, 
William Warham
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 to extinguish both the passions of these men, and their ravenous Appetite together, about the twelfth year of that Prince's Raign, exchanged this Mannor for other Lands, and so it became in∣corporated into the Revenue of the Crown.


There was a Chantry founded at 
Rye-house
 in this Parish, by 
Henry de Apul∣derfield,
 in the forty sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, as appears 
Pat. Anno.
 46. 
Edwardi tertii, Parte secunda Memb.
 19. Whose Revenue upon the Suppression, was by 
Henry
 the eighth, granted to 
Palmer,
 which Family had been of deep Anti∣quity before in this Parish, and from whence the 
Palmers
 of 
Snodland,
 and like∣wise of 
Howletts
 in 
East-Kent,
 were originally descended: but it seems the secu∣rity of this royal Patent, could not rescue it from being sold some years after to 
Bosvill,
 whose Descendant now holds the instant Fee-simple of it.


Otham
 in the Hundred of 
Maidstone,
 was a Branch of that Demeasne, which did in this Track acknowledge the Signiory of the ancient Family of 
Valoigns. William de Valoigns,
 is mentioned in the Book called 
Testa de Nevill,
 to have paid Aid for Lands at 
Petham, Ashford,
 and 
Otham,
 in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third, at the marriage of 
Isabell
 that Prince's Sister, and it is probable that this 
VVill. de Valoigns,
 dyed possest of 
Otham,
 in the tenth year of 
Edward
 the first, for his Name was 
VVilliam
 likewise, as appears by the escheat Roll, marked with the Number 54. after whom his Successor 
Stephen de Valoigns,
 held it, who was certainly a man of some important Account in those Times, for he was one of the Conservators of the Peace, in the raign of 
Edward
 the third. After 
Valoigns,
 the knightly Family of 
Pimpe,
 was by purchase invested about the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, both in the Possession of 
Otham
 and 
Gore-court,
 and to this Name was the Inheritance both of 
Otham
 and 
Gore-court,
 by a Chain of severall Descents, successively united; till at last the ordinary Devolution of purchase brought them over to 
Isley
 of 
Sun∣drich;
 and within the Circle of this Family, was the Propriety of them circum∣scribed, till the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 and then Sir 
Hen. Isley,
 being fatally engaged and entangled in the unsuccessefull Attempt of Sir 
Thomas Wiatt,
 could not unravell himself, untill he had satisfied the Justice of that Queen, with the forfeiture of his Life, and augmented the Revenue of the Crown, with the Con∣fiscation of his Estate: from which these two places, as being parcell of his es∣cheated Patrimony, were by Patent soon after, passed away to Sir 
Walter Henley,
 one of the Serjeants at Law, to the abovesaid Queen 
Mary,
 who dying without Issue-male, bequeathed 
Gore-court
 to 
Hellen
 his Daughter and Coheir, who was matched to 
Thomas Colepeper;
 and 
Otham
 to his Brother 
Thomas Henley;
 from whom it is come down to 
Walter Henley
 Esquire, who is the present Lord of the Fee: but 
Gore-court
 was by 
Colepeper,
 demised by Sale to 
Buffkin;
 where after the Pos∣session had for severall years been fixed, it was almost within the Pale of our Remembrance, by purchase made the present Inheritance of 
Tho. Floyd
 Esquire.


Stoneacre
 in this Parish is an Ancient Seat, which for some Centuries of years has acknowledged no other Proprietary then 
Ellys,
 but whether 
Burton
 in 
Kenington,
 or this Mansion were the original Fountain, from whence this Family did extract

its first Etymology is incertain, for once they had one and the same Possessor. The Deeds that fortifie their Interest in this place, reach as high as the Time of 
Edward
 the second, and instruct us, that 
Ellis
 which enjoyes it now, is by a stream of many unintercepted Descents issued out from 
John Ellis
 who possest it then.


There was the Foundation of a Religious Seminary of Canons, 
Praemonstratenses
 or white Canons, begun at 
Otham
 by 
Ralph de Dene:
 but the Situation of the Place, being not accommodated to Health, they were by 
Ela de Sackvil
 removed and trans∣planted into her new erected Priory at 
Begham,
 where till the common Suppression they continued undisturbed and fixed.


Otteringdon
 in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne,
 does represent to us in Prospect the Me∣mory of a Family, to whom it contributed in Times more Arcient both Seat and Sirname. 
Ralph de Ottringden
 held it at his Decease, which was in the fifteenth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 29. But in his Son Sir 
Lawrence de Ottringden,
 both the Name and Male Line failed together, for his Daughter and Heir brought it along with her to 
Peyforer,
 who about the latter end of the raign of 
Edward
 the third, was extinguished likewise by the same Fatality in 
Julian Peyforer,
 who was his Heir General, and she, by espousing 
Thomas St. Leger
 Esquire, intermixed the Right of this place with the Inheritance of this Family, and who lies entombed in this Church, with this Compendious Superscription endorsed upon his Grave∣stone, 
Hic jacet Thomas St. Leger de Otteringden, qui obiit
 1408. But a Revolution as suddain as the former, quickly snatched away 
Otteringden
 from the Patrimony of this Name; for by 
Joan,
 who was Co-heir to the above-mentioned 
Thomas St. Leger,
 it was rowled into the Revenue of 
Henry Aucher
 Esquire sprouted out from the Illustrious Stem of 
Aucher
 of 
Losenham,
 and in this Family was the In∣terest of this place successively laid up till the Time of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then the whole Demise was by Sale transmitted to 
Lewin,
 in whom a Descent or two after the Male-Line determining, the Female Heir brought it to 
Rogers
 of the 
West,
 from whom the like Fatality hath lately devolved it to 
Charles
 Lord 
Mansfeld,
 eldest Son to the Right Honorable 
William Cavendish,
 Marquess of 
Newcastle.


Putwood
 is another Mannor in this Parish, which in Times of elder Etymology, did acknowlede it self to be under the Signory of a Family, who extracted their Sirname from 
Vienne
 in 
Dauphine
 in 
France;
 and in several Deeds without Date, there is mention of 
William de Vienna,
 who was invested in Land here at 
Putwood
 and 
Ospringe,
 and in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Lucas de Vienna
 paid re∣spective Supply, at the making the Black Prince Knight, for Lands which he held at 
Putwood
 and 
Ospringe.
 After this Family was dissolved and gone, the 
Quadrings,
 which was about the beginning of 
Richard
 the second, were settled in the possessi∣on, where after some small Residence of the Title, it went away by Sale about the latter end of 
Henry
 the fourth, to the Ancient Family of 
Goldwell
 of great 
Chart:
 and here, after it had made some cursory aboad, the same Devolution cast it into the Inheritance of 
Dryland
 of 
Cokes-ditch
 in 
Feversham,
 to whose possession after the Title had, for many years cleaved, it was transported by purchase into the Patri∣mony of 
Atwater,
 so styled, because it is probable this Family had formerly their Residence near some Fountain or Stream, but their Original from whence they pri∣mitively issued, was from about 
Ospringe:
 for there I find 
Robert Atwater
 possest Land at his Death, which was in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the third, and in this Name did the Title of the place lie couched, until the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then by Sale it was incorporated into the Revenue of Sir 
James Hales:
 but long it remained not thus mingled, for the Fate of purchase untwisted it, and not many years after threw it into the Possession of 
Sayer,
 from whom in Times which almost bordered upon our Memory, it was by Sale wafted over to Mr. 
James Hugison
 of 
Dover,
 and he bequeathed it to a second Son, whose Female Heir Mrs. 
Jane Hugison,
 by lately matching with Mr. 
John Roberts
 Esquire, eldest Son to Sir 
John Roberts
 of 
Canterbury,
 hath entituled him to the Propriety of it.


Herst
 in this Parish, was the Ancient Demeasne of 
Filmer,
 and here were they seated, until by matching with the Heir of 
Argall,
 they were transplanted to 
East Sutton.
 I have seen an old Court-roll relating to the Mannor of 
Monkton
 in this

Parish, which by the Antiquity of it, seemed to commence from the raign of 
Edward
 the second, although the Date which stood in the Front, by the in urious Hand of Time, was almost expunged, and (so) hardly legible; wherein at the Foot of it, there is mention of one 
Edward Filmour,
 so he was written in that Age, from whom it is probable (though now the Name by Time and prescription be in the last Syllable of it something violated) the present Sir 
Edward Filmer,
 eldest Son to that Learned, Loyal, and Worthy Person Sir 
Robert Filmer,
 lately deceased, is primitively extracted, and this is confirmed by their own private Evidences, which represent them for many Cenerations, even till this present, Possessors of this Place, and wherein the Name is frequently written 
Filmor,
 aswel as in latter Escripts 
Filmer.


There is another Mannor in 
Ottringden,
 which anciently was reputed so, though now by Disuse and Intermission it hath lost that Estimate, and is called 
Hall-place,
 by a very Ancient Court-roll 
Sans date,
 now in the Hands of Mr. 
Paine.
 It is re∣presented, in those Times, when it had Tenants and Services belonging to it, to be the propriety of one 
Roger Rev,
 and in that Roll there is mention of one 
Thomas Franklin,
 who held some Lands of this Mannor, by paying yearly the Tribute or Rent-service of one Red Rose, as the Symbol of his Homage. And now for want of farther Light, from the Ancient Deeds and Evidences; I must make a leap to the raign of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then I find 
Eugenius Cock,
 in the nineteenth year of that Prince, sels it to 
John Bunce
 of this Parish Gentleman, in which Family the possession rested, until very lately it was by Sale alienated to Mr. 
Paine.


Monkton
 is the last place in this Parish of Note: It belonged before the suppressi∣on to the Nunnery of 
Davington,
 and was given to that Cloyster by 
Matthew
 Son of 
Hamon Atfrith,
 upon the first Erection of it, which was in the thirty ninth year of 
Henry
 the third. Upon the suppression and final Dissolution' of this Covent of 
Davington,
 by 
Henry
 the eighth, it was by that Prince granted to Sir 
Thomas Cheney,
 whose Son the Lord 
Henry Cheyney
 (so fugitive is the Tenure of Church-Demeasne) in the entrance into the raign of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 passed it away to 
Godden;
 who so small a space was resident in the possession, that he hath only left us Notice that he sold it to 
William Lewin,
 descended from the 
Lewins
 of 
Norfolk,
 whose Son Sir 
Justinian Lewin
 concluded in a Daughter and Heir, who was matched to 
Rogers
 of the County of 
Somersett,
 and so in her Right it became interwoven with his De∣measne: but remained not long thus involved in the Interest of this Name, for in our Memory he deceased, and left only a Daughter and Heir; who is lately matched to 
Charles Cavendish
 Lord 
Mansfeld,
 eldest Son to 
William
 Lord Marquess of 
New∣castle,
 so that 
Monkton
 in his Ladies Right is now united to his Inheritance.


There are two Chappels in the Parish Church of 
Ottringden:
 that on the North∣side of the Chauncel is called 
Ottringdens
 Chappel, where the Remains of several of the 
Ottringdens, St. Legers, Auchers,
 and 
Lewins,
 lie enterred: that on the South∣side is termed 
Bunces
 Chappel, where the Ashes and Reliques of several of that Fa∣mily slumber, who were of no contemptible Note in this Parish, where they had a Mansion, which in old Evidences is called 
Bunces
 Court, which hath been in their possession, as appears by their own Deeds, some Hundreds of years; and from hence are the 
Bunces
 of 
Throuley,
 likewise originally issued forth.






P. P. P. P.


PAdlesworth
 in the Hundred of 
Lovingborough,
 is so obscure and inconsiderable a Village, that it should not have filled a place in this Register, but that it was a portion of that wide Estate which lay spread over the Face of all the adjacent Ter∣ritorie, and acknowledged it self to be under the Jurisdiction of the 
Criolls. Ber∣tram de Crioll
 died about the middle of. 
Edward
 the first, and left 
Joan
 his Sole Heir, who had been before matched to Sir 
Richard de Rokesley
 of 
Rokesley
 Court in 
North∣crey,


and so 
Padlesworth
 became the 
Rokesley's,
 but did not long cleave to that Name, for he expired likewise in two Female Co-heirs, whereof one of them called 
Joan
 was matched to 
Thomas de Poynings,
 and he left Issue 
Michael Poynings,
 from whom it came down to his descendant 
Robert Poynings,
 who passed it away by Sale to 
Fogge
 of 
Sene
 in 
Newington,
 in which Family the Title for many Descents lay involved, even until our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was alienated to 
Dynley,
 who is the instant Lord of the Fee.


Padlesworth
 in the Hundred of 
Larkefeild,
 was, as high as the raign of 
H.
 the third, the Possession of a Family called 
Chetwind,
 who immediatly after exchanged it with 
Hamon de Gatton,
 for the Mannor of 
Hocklin
 in the County of 
Bedford,
 but kept it not long: for after it had continued some smal Interval of Time in this Family, it was alienated to the Noble Family of 
Huntingfeild,
 after whom succeeded 
Bele,
 and then it went away by Sale to 
Bullock,
 who by the same Devolution surrendred the possession to 
Diggs,
 where it had but a very transitory aboad, for he conveyed it away to 
Peckham,
 from whom the ordinary Mutation made by Purchase, brought it to own the Propriety of 
Vine∣ley,
 who translated his Interest by Sale unto 
William Clifford
 of 
Bobbing-court,
 and he about the beginning of 
Henry
 the fixt fixed the Title and Possession by Sale in 
Robert Bambergh.
 Where it is to be noted, that this quick and suddain Revolution of the Title of this place in those Families, which intervened between 
Hunting∣feild
 and 
Bambergh,
 happened in lesse then a Circle of fifty years, (as appears by the original Conveyances now in the Hands of Mr. 
Marsham.
) But to advance in that Discourse where I broke off; 
Robert Bambergh
 above-mentioned, was not long set∣tled in his new Acquists, but he deceased and left it to his Daughter and Heir, who was matched to 
Nicolas Wotton
 Esquire, from whom in a direct Line it came down to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Wotton,
 who settled it in Marriage upon his Daughter and Co-heir 
Katherine Wotton
 with 
Henry
 Lord 
Stanhop,
 eldest Son, and Heir apparent, to 
Philip
 Earl of 
Chesterfeild,
 and this Lady hath since passed it away to my Noble Friend, 
John Marsham
 of 
Whornes-place
 in 
Cuckeston
 Esquire, from whose Deeds and Pa∣pers I have drawn my present Intelligence.


Patricksbourn
 in the Hundreds of 
Bredge
 and 
Pet-ham,
 in Ancient Records hath still the Addition of 
Cheyney
 annexed to it: for indeed it was the first and original Residence of the 
Cheyneys,
 before they translated their Habitation to 
Shurland
 in 
Shepey,
 by matching with the Heir of 
Shurland. Alexander de Cheyney
 is registred in the Catalogue of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen who accompanied 
Richard
 the first to the Siege of 
Acon. In Testa de Nevill,
 an Ancient Book kept in the Exchecquer, there is mention of 
Gulielmus de Casineto
 (so they are written in Latine) that is, 
William de Cheyney,
 who paid respective supply, in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third, at the Marriage of 
Isabell
 that King's Sister, for his Lands at 
Patriksbourn Cheyney. Alexander de Cheney
 Grand-child to the above-said 
Alexander,


 is enrolled in the List of those eminent 
Kentish
 Persons, who in the forty second year of 
Henry
 the third, accompanied that Prince when he marched from 
Chester
 to suppress the emotions of the 
Welsh.
 Sir 
Alexander de Cheyney
 this mans Son was with King 
Edward
 the first in his victorious and triumphant Expedition against the 
Scots,
 in the twenty eighth year of his Raign (as appears by the Rolls of those 
Kentish
 Gentle∣men, who were embarked in that succesful Design with that Prince) and from this 
Alexander
 did the possession of this place, by an undisordered and even Thread of Descent, through all the Mazes of Time, transmit it self to 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney,
 and he having by his excess and exorbitancy embezelled an Estate of vast Extent and Grandeur; amongst the Rest passed this away, in the beginning of Queen 
Eliza∣beth,
 to 
William Partrich
 Esquire, whose Grandchild Sir 
Edward Partrich
 in that Age which was within the Verge of our Remembrance, alienated it to Mr. 
Arnold Brams.


Howletts
 in this Parish with 
Hode
 in 
Patricksbourn
 also, were the Ancient De∣measne of 
Izaack,
 and there is a Chancel in the Church, which formerly bore the the Name of 
Izaacks
 Chancel. 
John Izaack,
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third (as appears by the Book of 
Aide
) paid an auxiliary supply for his Lands at 
Pa∣triksbourn,


at the investing the Black Prince with Knighthood; 
John Isaack
 his Son lies entombed in 
Patricksbourn
 Church, with this Inscription upon his Grave∣stone, 
Orate pro Animabus Joannis Izaack Armigeri, & Ceciliae uxoris eius, qui obiit ...... Anno Domini
 1443. 
Thomas Izaack,
 as the private Annals of this Family do discover to us, had a Command in 
France
 under the Duke of 
Bedford,
 where he performed exemplary Service against the 
French.
 The last of this Family at this place, was 
Edward Izaack
 Esquire, who determined in two Daughters and Co∣heirs, 
Mary
 who was matched to 
Thomas Apylton
 of 
Waldenfield
 in 
Suffolk,
 and ano∣ther first wedded to ...... 
Sydley,
 and after to Sir 
Henry Palmer,
 to whose Son she gave 
Howletts,
 as being, upon the Division of her Fathers Estate, made her Inheritance: from whom Sir 
Henry Palmer
 now of St. 
Martins-hill
 in 
Canterbury,
 is descended, who hath lately alienated 
Howletts
 to Sir 
Robert Hales
 Knight and Baronet.


Peckham
 in the Hundreds of 
Twyford
 and 
Littlefeild,
 is distinguished from the other; first by its Bulk and Dimension, this being called commonly great 
Peckham;
 and then secondly by its Situation, being styled in Records 
East-Peckham.
 It was given to the Church of the 
Trinity,
 that is, 
Christ-church
 in 
Canterbury,
 by Queen 
Edgiva,
 to the Monks of that Covent, 
ad Cibum,
 for a support of their Diet and Alimony, in the year of Grace, nine hundred forty and one: and if you will see how it was rated in the great Register of Domes-day Book, take here a View of it; 
Peckham,
 saies that Record, 
Tempore Edwardi Regis se defendebat pro VI. Sullings,
 and so forth: 
Peckham
 in the Time of 
Edward
 the King, that is the Confessor, went for seven Plough-Lands, and defends it self now (that is, in the Time of the Con∣queror) after the same Estimate, and was rated upon the Appraisement formerly at twelve 
lb.
 but now is stated at eight. And, thus regulated, was it for many Ages fastned to the Patrimony of the Church, until the Dissolution, in the raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, unloosned the Cement, in the twenty ninth year of that Prince; who afterwards about the thirty sixth year of his Raign, grants this and divers other parcels of the Church-Demeasne to Sir 
Thomas Wiatt,
 who not long after by Livery and Seisin, passes away his Right in it to 
George Moulton
 Esquire: but because there was a Fine and Recovery wanting, the Sale was imperfect, so that he had it only in Abeiance (as the Law styles it) or in Expectance, so that the Crown, in the second of Queen 
Mary,
 upon the Defection and Attaint of Sir 
Tho∣mas Wiat,
 finding this in the Tenure of 
Moulton,
 seised upon it as parcel of 
Wiats
 Estate, because it had not been before legally conveyed. And here it rested, till Queen 
Elizabeth,
 in the second year of her raign, granted it to 
Anthony Weldon
 Esquire, one of the Justices of Peace for this County under the raign of Queen 
Mary,
 at which Time he became eminent, by his vigorous opposing Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 in that Design he was then embarked in; and in this Family (though not without some Struglings and Conflicts at Law, about the Title) does the Propriety of this Mannor at this instant reside.


There is an eminent Seat in this Parish called 
Roydon-Hall,
 which was before cal∣led 
Fortune,
 but was of no great Account, until about the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then 
Roydon
 of 
Suffolk,
 came into this County, and seated himself here, and erected this Pile, upon which he fixed his own Name, which it hath been known by ever since, though it hath changed its Possessor: for this Family was ex∣tinguished in a Daughter and Heir called 
Elizabeth,
 who was the only surviving Issue of 
Thomas Roydon
 Esquire, who by matching with 
William Twisden
 Esquire, made it the Inheritance of 
William Twisden
 Esquire Great Grand-father to Sir 
Roger Twisden
 Knight and Baronet, who obtained a Charter of Free-warren from the late King to re∣duce a certain proportion of Ground into a Parke which is that the House is surrounded with at present, though the House owe much of its Magnificence and Splendor to the Care and Expence of his Grand-father 
Roger Twisden
 Esquire, and his Father Sir 
William Twisden
 Knight and Baronet.


Alban
 vulgarly called 
Auburne,
 is another place of eminent Consideration in 
East-Peckham.
 This with 
Black-pits,
 in this Parish, was anciently the Inheritance of a Family called 
Pollard:
 for 
John
 the Son of 
John Pollard
 in the thirty forth year

of 
Edward
 the first, demises it to 
Alban de Wandesworth,
 who, it is probable, erected some Mansion House upon it, from whence Posterity took the Advantage to adopt it into his Sirname; and from him did it devolve by successive Right, to his Grandchild 
William de Wandesworth,
 who dying without Issue, gave it to his Widow 
Mabell Wandesworth,
 who was remarried to 
Richard Ryner;
 and they both by a joint Concurrence, in the second year of 
Richard
 the second, passed 
Albans
 and 
Black-pits
 away to 
John Mew:
 yet I find a Family called 
Onley,
 interessed in some part of both these Mannors, which was purchased of 
William de Wandeshine,
 in the raign of 
Henry
 the third; and in this Family was the Title lodged, untill the second year of 
Richard
 the second, and then 
Joan Only,
 in whom the Name and Possession both concluded, alienated her Proportion to the abovesaid 
John Mew:
 nor was some parcell of both these Mannors free from the claim of a Family cal∣led 
Goldsmith;
 for in the ninth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Richard Goldsmith,
 does devest himself of all Concernment in it, and by Sale transmitts it to 
John Mew,
 and from him, about the latter end of 
Henry
 the fourth, both these Mannors with all their Appendages, were passed away to 
Iohn Tutsham,
 and 
Nicholas Rem∣kin
 of 
Eastmere:
 but he determined in 
Alize Remkin
 his Sole Inheritrix, who by matching with 
Thomas Rolfe
 of 
Tunbridge,
 brought her Interest in 
Albans
 and 
Black-pits,
 to be the Inheritance of that Family, but long the Right of both these places continued neither in 
Rolfe
 nor 
Tutsham;
 for about the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, they were alienated by Sale to 
Thomas Stidulfe
 of 
Badsell
 Esquire; and he by Deed, bearing date 1463, that is, about the third year of 
Edward
 the fourth, settles them on his two Sons 
Robert
 and 
Henry Stidulfe;
 and in the Deed, there is a re∣membrance, that they were purchased of 
Rolfe
 and 
Tutsham.
 From 
Robert
 they descended to his Son 
Thomas Stidulfe,
 who was Heir both to his Father and his Uncle, but he concluded in a Daughter and Heir, who was matched (about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth) to 
Richard Vane,
 Ancestor to the right honorable 
Mildmay Fane,
 now Earl of 
Westmerland,
 who in Right of this Alliance, now en∣joys 
Black-pits:
 but 
Albans
 was by 
Henry Vane,
 Successor to the above-mentioned 
Richard,
 in the year 1589, passed away to 
Roger Twisden
 of 
Roydon
-Hall Esquire, Grand Father to the instant Proprietary Sir 
Roger Twisden
 Knight and Baro∣net.


Eastmere
 is another Mannor in 
East-Peckham,
 which acknowledged a Family called 
Remkin,
 anciently to be its Possessors: 
John Remkin,
 was Father of 
Christian Remkin,
 who held it, as appears by an ancient Court-roll, in the thirty fourth year of 
Edward
 the third; and from him, did it, by paternal Vicissitude, devolve to 
Nicholas Remkin,
 in whom the male-line failed: so that 
Alice
 his Sole Daugh∣ter became the visible Heir to his Estate, and she by matching with 
Thomas Rolfe
 of 
Tunbridge,
 knit this and other Land here at 
Great Peckham,
 to his Patrimony, but it did not long thus continue united, for 
John Rolfe
 his Son, in the sixth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, conveys it to 
Richard Ruyton,
 and he in the eighth year of the abovesaid Prince, alienated it to 
William Hextall:
 but he deceasing without Issue∣male, 
Margaret,
 his Sole Daughter, by her Inter-marriage with 
William Whetenhall,
 originally descended from the ancient Family of 
Whetenhall
 of 
Whetenhall
 in 
Cheshire,
 cast it into the Possession of that Name, from whom it is now descended to my worthy Friend 
Thomas Whetenhall
 of 
Hextall
 Court, Esquire.


Spilfted
 is a fourth Mannor in this Parish: It was the Inheritance for diverse Ages (as appears by the Evidences, now in the Custody of Sir 
Roger Twisden
) of an an∣cient Family called 
Cayser;
 the last of which Name, who enjoyed this place, was 
John Cayser,
 who went out in Daughters and Coheirs; one of which was wedded to 
Matthew Chetwind,
 to whom, this place, upon the Separation of the Estate in∣to parcells, in his Wifes Right accrued; and he after some small residence in the Possession, passed away his Right by Sale in the one and fortieth year of Queen 
Eliz.
 to 
Roger Twisden
 Esq. Grand-father to Sir 
Roger Twisden
 Knight and Baronet the instant Lord of the Fee, a Person upon whom I need drop no other Character, when I say, that in these times, when there is such a Damp, and Astonishment, by publick blastings and discouragements cast upon Literature, He is both a Gentle∣man and a Scholler.




Here is likewise a Seat in 
Peckham
 very venerable for its Antiquity, which in old Rolls, is called 
Hextall Court,
 and was the Mansion of Gentlemen of princi∣pal Account in this Track. In a Deed without Date, 
Simon de Hougham,
 does demise certain pieces of Land to 
John de Hextall,
 which lay within the Limits of the Parish of 
Hougham,
 where anciently this Family enjoyed no contempti∣ble Possessions, as well as at 
East-Peckham.
 The last of this Name at this place, was 
William Hextall
 who dyed without Issue-male, and left 
Margaret
 his only Heir, who was matched to 
William Whetenhall
 Esquire, in the raign of 
Henry
 the seventh, descended from the ancient and illustrious Family of 
Whetenhall
 of 
Wheten∣hall
 in the County of 
Chester,
 and so it was incorporated into the Income of that Family, where it hath ever since remained; so that it is now the present Inheritance of 
Thomas Whetenhall
 Esquire.


West-Peckham
 or 
Little Peckham,
 in the Hundreds of 
Twyford
 and 
Littlefield,
 was annexed to the Demeasne of the Knights Templars, when 
John Colepeper
 foun∣ded a Praeceptory here for them, in the year of our Lord 1 .... which upon the finall Extirpation, and Dissolution of their Order, here in 
England,
 in the second year of 
Edward
 the second, was granted to the Knights Hospitallers, and was sometimes called a Praeceptory, and sometimes a Commandry. Now a Praecep∣tory was a Benefice in Kind, and was termed so; because this, and all others of the same Capacity, were possest by the more eminent sort of Templars, whom the Chief Master created and called 
Praeceptores Templi;
 A Commandry was some principal Mannor of the Knights Hospitallers, wherein was placed some Brother of the Order, who could not dispose of the Profits of it, but was to mannage it only to the Use of the whole Fraternity, deducting so much of the Revenue, as might support his Livelyhood and Subsistence, of which see more in Dr. 
Cowells Interpreter,
 in his Notes and Comment upon the word Commaundry. This upon the Suppression, was by 
Henry
 the eighth, in the thirty second year of his raign, granted to Sir 
Robert Southwell,
 afterwards of the Privy Councell to King 
Edward
 the sixth, and Queen 
Mary;
 who not long after alienated it to Sir 
Edmund Wal∣singham
 of 
Scadbery,
 Lieutenant of the 
Tower,
 from whom it came down by Des∣cent, to my Noble Friend Sir 
Thomas Walsingham,
 his Great Grand-child, who not long since, passed it over by Sale, to his Son in Law Mr. 
James Masters.


Oxenheath
 is an ancient Mannor in 
West-Peckham,
 and was many Ages past the Demeasn of 
Colepeper, Walter Colepeper
 dyed seised of it, in the first year of 
Ed.
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 And from him, by Successive Transmission threaded together by many Descents, did it devolve to ...... 
Colepeper,
 who determined towards the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, in three Daughters and Coheirs: 
Margaret
 the eldest, was matched to 
William Cotton
 of the County of 
Cambridge; Joyce
 the second, was wedded to 
Edmund Howard,
 a younger Son of 
Thomas
 Duke of 
Norfolke,
 who was Father to 
Katharine Howard
 one of the infortunate Wives of 
Henry
 the eighth; and the third was espoused to 
Barham,
 of 
Barham-court
 in 
Teston,
 and these three Sisters shared his Inheritance, and this upon the Partition was annexed to the Demeasn of 
Cotton,
 whose Successor passed it away by Sale to 
Chowne
 of 
Faire-lane,
 in which Name it did not long continue; for Sir 
George Chowne,
 in our Fathers Memory, being desirous to abridge and contract all his Estate, in∣to the County of 
Sussex,
 alienated this Seat to 
Nicholas Miller
 Esquire, who up∣on his Decease, bequeathed it to his Nephew Sir 
Nicholas Miller,
 to whom we ascribe the new Additions, which are set out with all the Circumstances both of Art and Magnificence; and is now possest by his Son and Heir 
Hump. Miller
 Esquire.


Pencehurst
 is seated upon the utmost Boundary of the 
Lowy
 of 
Tunbridge,
 and was an eminent Mansion of a very Ancient Family whose Sirname was 
Penchester,
 of whom there is mention in the Great Survey of 
England,
 taken in the twentieth year of 
William
 the Conqueror, vulgarly called Doomes-day Book, and in this Family did the possession reside, until the two Daughters and Co-heirs of the famous Sir 
Stephen de Penchester,
 who was Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Constable of 
Dover
 Castle, in the Raign of 
Edward
 the second, and who died seised of it, in the year

of that Prince's Government, 
Rot. Esc. Numb.
 ... divided the Inheritance; 
Joane
 the eldest was matched to 
Henry
 Lord 
Cobham
 of 
Roundall
 in 
Shorne,
 and she car∣ried away 
Allington-castle, Alice
 the other Daughter and Co-heir was wedded to 
John
 Lord 
Columbers,
 and she had 
Pencehurst,
 and other Lands for her proportion. And he had Issue by her 
Thomas de Columbers,
 who by his Deed dated at 
Pencehurst,
 in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the third, passes away his Right in it to Sir 
John de Poultney,
 and he in the twelfth year of the above-mentioned Prince, obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of 
Pencehurst,
 and in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, paid 
Aid
 for it, at making the Black Prince Knight; and held it at his Decease, which was in the twenty third year of that Prince, and left it to his Son 
William Poultney,
 who immediatly after alienated it to 
Guy Lovain,
 who had Issue Sir 
Nicolas Lovain,
 who held 
Pencehurst,
 in the forty fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, and married 
Margaret
 eldest Daughter to 
John Vere
 Earl of 
Ox∣ford,
 re-married to 
Henry
 Lord 
Beaumont,
 and after to Sir 
John Devereux,
 Knight of the Garter, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Constable of 
Dover-castle,
 and Steward of the Kings House, in the eleventh year of King 
Richard
 the second. In the sixteenth year of whose raign, he had Licence by Letters Patents to fortifie and embattel his Mansion-house at 
Pencehurst.
 His Daughter and Heir was matched to 
Walter
 Lord 
Fitz-water,
 from whom the Earls of 
Sussex
 descended: and he had a Brother named Sir 
Walter Devereux,
 from whom the late Earl of 
Essex
 was de∣rived, and the Arms of this Sir 
John Devereux
 were not long since extant in a Win∣dow, on the North-side of 
Pencehurst
 Church; But he only enjoyed this Mannor in Right of his Wife, for after her Death it devolved to 
Philip St. Clere
 of 
Aldham St. Clere
 in 
Eightham,
 who married 
Margaret
 Daughter of Sir 
Nicolas Lo∣vain,
 above-mentioned, Sister and Heir to her Brother 
Nicolas Lovain,
 who died without Issue. And by her he had 
John St. Clere,
 who passed away his Right here to 
John
 Duke of 
Bedford,
 third Son to 
Henry
 the fourth, and he enjoyed 
Pencehurst
 at his Decease, which was in the fourteenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth: but dying without Issue, it came down to 
Humphrey
 Duke of 
Gloucester,
 fourth Son of 
Henry
 the fourth, who was strangled in the Abby of 
Bury,
 by the procurement and practises of the Duke of 
Suffolke:
 and he likewise going out without Posterity, it returned to the Crown. And 
Henry
 the sixth, in the twenty fifth year of his raign, granted it to 
Humphrey Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 whose infortunate Grand∣child, 
Edward
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 endeavouring by a specious Semblance of Vanity and Ostentation, guilded with all the Cunning and Pompe of Magnificence to make himself popular, and entering afterwards into Consultation with a Monk, and another, who pretended to the dark Art of Necromancy, about the Succession of the Crown, poured in so many Jealousies into the Bosome of 
Henry
 the eighth, which were multiplied to the height of Treason by the malice of Cardinal 
Wolsey,
 that nothing could allay or appease them, but the Effusion of this mans Blood, in the twelfth year of that Prince, upon a 
Scaffold.
 Upon whose infortunate 
Exit,
 this Mannor escheated to the Crown, and here it remained, until King 
Henry
 the eighth, granted it to his faithful Servant Sir 
Ralph Vane,
 who being entangled with 
John
 Duke of 
Somersett,
 in that obscure Design, which was destructive to them both, in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the sixth; this was again seised upon by the Crown, as escheated by his Conviction, and remained with its Revenue, until the above-said Prince, in the sixth year of his Government, by Royal Concession planted the Inheritance in Sir 
William Sidney
 his Tutor, who was likewise Lord 
Chamberlain
 of his Houshold, and one of his Privy Councel: from whom it is des∣cended to his great Grand-child, the Right Honorable 
Robert
 Earl of 
Leicester,
 de∣signed Lord Lievtenant of 
Ireland,
 by the late King 
Charles,
 and he is the instant Proprietary of it.


Pencehurst Halymote
 is another little Mannor in this Parish, and had still the same Owners with 
Pencehurst,
 and upon the Tragedy of 
Edward
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 devolving by Escheat to the Crown, lay couched in the Royal Revenue, un∣til the State not many years since, passed it away by Grant to Colonel 
Robert Gibbons.




Pepenbury,
 vulgarly called 
Pembury,
 is seated in the Hundreds of 
Watchlingston
 and 
Twyford,
 and contains within the Limits of it that noted Seat called 
Bayhall,
 which was the Ancient Seat of the Ancient Family of 
Colepepers.
 The first of which whom I find made eminent by Record, is 
Thomas de Colepeper,
 who was as appears by the Bundels of incertain years in the Pipe-Office one of the 
Recognitores Magnae Assisae,
 in the raign of King 
John;
 a place, if we consider the 
Meridian
 of those Times, for which it was calculated, that is, before the establishment of the Con∣servators of the Peace, of eminent Trust and Concernment. And certainly this man was Father of that 
Thomas Colepeper,
 who was brought upon the Stage, and his Tragedy represented at 
Leeds
 Castle, where he was sacrificed to the Anger of 
Edward
 the second, because he was a more faithful 
Castellan
 to the Lord 
Badelesmer,
 then he was a Loyal Subject to his Soveraign, and with his Life he lost his Estate here at 
Pepenbury:
 Yet I find by the close Rols of the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Memb.
 5. that there was much of his Land here, and in other places, by the Indulgence of that Prince, restored to his Son 
Thomas de Colepeper,
 but yet the Mannor and this Seat remained lodged in the Crown; yet certainly it was no contemptible parcel of Land, that was granted back: for 
Richard
 the second by Royal Concession gave Licence to 
Thomas Colepeper
 to inclose fifty Acres of Land into a Park at 
Pepenbury.
 But to advance: In the twenty fifth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, the Crown devests it self of its Right to both these places, and transplants it by Grant into 
Humphrey Stafford
 the Duke of 
Buckingham,
 from whom they des∣cended to his infortunate Grand-child, 
Edward
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 who lost both his Life and Estate, being attainted in the thirteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth: After his Tragedy, they continued until the twenty fourth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, in the possession of the Crown, and then they were passed away by Grant to Sir 
Edward Guldford,
 and again confirmed to him, in the twenty eighth year of that Prince's raign, and from him not long after by 
Joane
 his Female Heir, they increa∣sed the Patrimony of 
John Dudley,
 after Duke of 
Northumberland,
 and he in the thirtieth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, alienated them to 
Thomas Cromwell
 Earl of 
Es∣sex,
 whose Story, Tragedy, and Attaint, in the thirty second year of the above∣said Prince, are represented to our view in such obvious Characters, that I shall not need again to unvail them. Upon his ruinous Catastrophe, they revert to the Crown, and lay shut up in the Royal Revenue, until the thirty seventh year of 
Hen∣ry
 the eighth, and then they were made by a new Grant the Inheritance of 
William Wybourn
 and 
Anthony Brown
 Esquires; but that Proportion which was setled in 
Brown,
 was not long resident in that Family; for in the sixth year of Queen 
Eli∣zabeth,
 it was alienated to 
William VVybourn
 Esquire: nor was the Interest of these places of any long Date after this in 
VVybourn,
 for in our Grand-fathers Memory, the Fate of Sale annexed them to the Patrimony of 
Thomas Sackvill
 Lord 
Buckurst,
 whose Grand-child the Right Honorable 
Edward Sackvill
 Earl of 
Dorset,
 not many years since conveyed his Right in them to Mr. ...... 
Amherst.


Halkewell
 is an eminent Mannor in this Parish and was a Branch of that Demeasne, which fell under the Signory of the Priory of 
Begham,
 and so remained until the Dissolution, and then it was by 
Henry
 the eighth, about the Time of their suppres∣sion, that is, 1525. granted to 
John VVybourn,
 who was Tenant to that Abby upon the Suppression; but was Anciently seated at a place called 
Culverdens,
 whither they arrived from about 
Crofton
 in 
Orpington,
 where they originally were planted, about the latter end of 
Henry
 the third: and from this 
Iohn VVybourn,
 was Mr. 
Benjamin VVybourn
 descended, who upon his late Death hath left this Mannor to his Widow Mrs. 
Blanch VVybourn,
 eldest Daughter to Sir 
Iohn Philipott
 of the County of 
South-Hampton.


Bencrouch, Highlands,
 and 
Prigles,
 were Mannors which related to the Patrimo∣ny of the Abby of 
Rothers-bridge
 in 
Sussex,
 and in the year 1525, were pared off from the Ecclesiasticall Revenue by Cardinal 
Wolsey,
 when he layed the Founda∣tions of his Stately Colledge at 
Christ-church
 in 
Oxford,
 which, like some Em∣brio, for want of Maturity, became imperfect and indigested by his Death, and then these places, being found in his Hands at his Decease, were seised upon by

Henry
 the eighth, who in the twenty fourth year, granted them to 
George Guldford
 Esquire, who not long after, conveyed them by Sale to Sir 
Alexander Colepeper,
 who had a Confirmation of them from the Crown, about the thirty fifth year of that Prince's Government, and in this Family did they continue laid up, un∣till the Title was in our Fathers remembrance, dislodged, and by Sale resigned up to 
Nicholas Miller
 Esquire, who upon his Decease without Issue, left them to his Nephew, Sir 
Nicholas Miller;
 and he upon his late Decease, hath left them to his Son and Heir 
Humphrey Miller
 Esquire.


Preston
 situated in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 contains sundry places within the Boundaries of it, of no vulgar Account. The first is 
Makenade,
 which was the Mansion for many Ages, of Gentlemen of that Sitname, whereof 
VVilliam Make∣nade
 was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the thirty third year of 
Edward
 the third, and held his Shrievalty at this House, which then was of more Magnificence, though now it lye almost gasping in its own Ruines, being crushed into that Disorder by the rough Hand of Time; from this Man it descended to his Grandchild 
VVilliam Makenade,
 who in the eighth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, dying without Issue-male, 
Constance Makenade,
 his only Daughter became his Heir, who carried this Seat along with her, to her Husband 
John VVaterslip,
 by whom she had Issue 
Marga∣ret,
 matched to 
Henry London,
 and 
Joan
 wedded to 
Thomas Mathew,
 who upon the Division of the Estate, shared this House, and the Land which related to it; in which Family after the Inheritance had been for several years shut up, it at length by Sale went out to 
Maycot,
 who about the Beginning of Queen 
Eliza∣beth,
 passed it away by Sale to 
Martin James
 Esquire, Register of the Chance∣ry, whose Great Grand-child Mr. ....... 
James,
 enjoys the present Fee-Simple of it.


Perry Court
 in 
Preston
 was the Mansion of a good old Family called 
Barrett,
 who enjoyed this Seat as high as the raign of 
Edward
 the second, and then, I find it was under the Signiory of one 
Iohn de Perry,
 to whom, and to whose Family it seems, it afforded anciently, both Seat and Sirname: 
Valentine Barrett,
 who mat∣ched with 
Cicelie,
 Daughter and Coheir of 
Marcellus Att Leeze,
 and Niece of Sir 
Richard Att Leeze,
 was the last of the Name who held this place; for he deter∣mined in 
Cicelie
 his only Daughter and Heir, who was wedded to 
John Darrell
 of 
Cale-hill
 Esquire, for his first Wife, who was elder Brother of Sir 
William Darrell,
 under-Treasurer of 
England,
 branched out from the knightly Family of the 
Dar∣rells
 of 
Sesay
 in 
York-hire
 whose Heir General matched with the Ancestor of 
Dawney,
 now Proprietary of that place, and by this Alliance, 
Perry Court
 came to be knit to to the Demeasn of 
Darrell
 of 
Cale-hill,
 for many Descents, untill, in the raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, it fell to be divided between two Brothers, Sir 
James Darrell
 Knight, and 
John Darrell
 Gentleman. 
John Darrell
 in the first year of 
Henry
 the eighth, alienated his proportion to 
Stephen Jennins,
 and he in the sixth year of that Prince, conveyed it to 
Thomas Michell
 and he in the eighth of his raign, passed it a∣way to 
Robert Dokket,
 who two years after demised it to 
Alan Percy;
 and 
Alan Percy
 in the fourteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, transmitted it by Sale, to 
John Park,
 who likewise purchased the other Moiety, the same year of Sir 
James Darrell,
 and so be∣came sole Owner of 
Perry Court,
 from whom by 
Elizabeth
 his Sole Daughter and Heir, it was carried off, to 
John Roper
 of 
Lingsted
 Esquire, and he in the twen∣ty fifth year of Q. 
Eliz.
 transferred all his Concernment in it to 
William Finch,
 by whose Daughter and Coheir, it was annexed to the Inheritance of Sir 
Drue Drewry
 of 
Norfolke,
 and he in the Beginning of King 
James,
 passed it away to 
Thomas Bennet
 Esquire, whose Descendants are still entituled to the Possession of it.


Westwood
 is a third place in 
Preston
 not to be declined in our Account. It was, as high as I can trace out, under the Jurisdiction of the eminent Family of 
Poy∣nings. Michaell Poynings,
 who was Son of 
Thomas
 Lord 
Poynings,
 held it at his Death, which was in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 14. And from him did it by a constant Tide of uninterrupted Interest, sur∣render it self up to Sir 
Edward Poynings,
 who in the fourteenth year of 
Henry


the eighth, dyed without any lawful Issue, and as it appeared too then without any collateral Alliance, that could by any Title knit by never so far distant an Affinity to him lay the Foundations of any pretended Claim to his estare; so that it escheated to the Crown, and 
K.H.
 the eighth in the thirty second and thirty third of his Rule gran∣ted it to 
I. Limsey,
 who not many years after, passed it away to Alderman 
Garret
 of 
London
 Ancestor to Sir 
Iohn Garret
 of the County of 
Hertford
 Baronet, in whom the possession of this place is at this instant resident.


Preston
 in the Hundred of 
Wingham,
 was the Inheritance of the Lord 
Leybourn. William de Leybourn,
 had a Grant of a Market and a Fair, to his Mannor of 
Preston,
 in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the first; from whom it descended to his Son 
Roger de Leybourn,
 who went out in a Daughter and Heir called 
Juliana Leybourn,
 so often mentioned in this Discourse, who first matched to 
John de Hastings,
 a Kinsman of 
Laurence de Hastings
 Earl of 
Pembroke.
 That he was not his Son, is most evident, for then he must by Consequence, have been her second Husband: for 
William de Clinton
 who was her second Husband, and hath been by publike Records, al∣ways so reputed, deceased by the Testimony of all, in the twenty eighth of 
Ed∣ward
 the third: 
Juliana
 his Wife, in the forty third year of that Prince, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 57. And 
John de Hastings
 in the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, which upon a serious Computation of Time, makes it impossible that this 
John de Hasting,
 whom all conclude to have been her first Husband should be that 
John,
 who was Son to 
Laurence
 Earl of 
Pembroke;
 nor could it be any other 
William de Clinton,
 then this before mentioned. First, because he was the last Earl of 
Huntington
 of the Name. Secondly, if we should make him to be any other, he must be designed Husband for this 
Juliana,
 after the Death of this 
John de Hasting,
 who survived this 
Juliana
 six years, as appears by the former ballancing of Time, which will appear altogether absurd and impossible. Thirdly, all do concurre, that this 
VVilliam de Clinton
 who was her second Husband, was Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, in the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the third, Admiral of the Narrow-Seas Westward in the fifteenth year, and had the Custody of all the Kings Forrests Southwards beyond 
Trent,
 in the seven∣teenth year of that Prince's Government, which could be no other, than this 
VVilliam
 Earl of 
Huntington,
 who although he were fruitful in Offices, he was not so in Children, for he dyed without Issue by this Lady 
Juliana,
 who after his death re∣mained in the State of Widowhood (for ought I can yet discover) untill her decease: for in the Escheat-roll mentioned before, she is styled 
Comitissa de Huntington,
 upon whose death, none appearing either directly or collaterally, who justly could enti∣tle themselves to her Patrimony, the Crown claimed it as an escheat; and 
Richard
 the second, granted it to Sir 
Simon de Burleigh,
 Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, who being afterwards attainted, in the tenth year of that Prince it was re-invested in the royal Revenue, and was not long after by 
Richard
 the second, granted to the Abby of St. 
Mary Grace
 on 
Tower-hill,
 and some part of it to the Priory of 
Canons Langley,
 and sometimes written 
Childrens Langley:
 and here it dwelt untill the general Suppression, and then King 
Henry
 the eighth, in the thirty fifth year of his reign, granted it to Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 whose Daughter and Coheir 
Amy Motle,
 incorported it into the demeasne of her Husband Sir 
Thomas Kempe:
 where it had had no long aboad, when this Sir 
Thomas
 dyed without Issue-male, and left his estate to be divided between four Daughters and Coheirs: 
Anne
 one of whom, carried this a∣way to Sir 
Thomas Chichley,
 of the County of 
Cambridge,
 whose Son 
Thomas Chich∣ley
 Esquire, hath lately by Sale transmitted his Right in it, to Mr. ..... 
Spence,
 and Mr. 
Robert Spence
 of 
Baukham
 in 
Sussex.


Preston
 by 
VVingham
 had the Grant of a Market procured to it on the 
Monday,
 and a Fair of three days continuance, at the Feast of St. 
Crosse,
 in the thirty fifth of 
Edw.
 the first. Sir 
Simon de Burleigh,
 had the Grant of a Market renued to this place on the 
Friday,
 and a Fair by the space of three days at the Feast of St. 
Mildred
 the Virgin, in the tenth year of 
Richard
 the second.


Petham
 gives Name in part, to that Hundred wherein it hath its Position, being called the Hundred of 
Bredge
 and 
Petham,
 and was always a Mannor folded up in

the revenue of the Arch-bishop, though I confess I cannot trace out in the wilderness of Antiquity who was the first Donor. If you peruse the Pages of 
Doomes-day
 Book, you wil find it there thus represented; 
Petham est proprium Manerium Archiepiscopi & in Tempore Edwardi Regis se defendebat pro
 VII 
Sullings, & nunc similiter, & est appretiatum
 XX 
lb.
 And this is enough to refute that mistake in 
Eadmerius
 not long since printed by Mr. 
Selden:
 which I believe is only by Accident and not voluntary, which says that 
Anselm
 mortgaged or pawned 
Peckham
 to the Monks of 
Canterbury
 which was long before given to them by Q. 
Edgiva:
 Indeed it should have been printed 
Petham;
 that be∣ing always as you have seen a Mannor of the Arch-bishops, till it was engaged, which it seems was never redeemed; for it continued in the revenue of the Monks in 
Christ∣church,
 until the Dissolution; and then it was transplanted into the revenue of the Crown, and lay there until K. 
James
 in our Fathers memory granted it to 
Tho. Thompson
 Esq; Ancestor to Mr. 
Thompson
 Esq; who now enjoys the possession of it.


Swerdling
 is a Mannor in this Parish of as eminent Account as any in this Track, and was the Capital Mansion of the Noble and ancient Family of 
Valoigns. Ruallo de Valoigns
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the first year of 
Henry
 the second, and in the Pipe-rolls of that year, is written of 
Swerdling:
 and he was witness to King 
Stephen
's Char∣ter,

 whereby he grants the Mill at 
East-Bridge
 in 
Canterbury
 to the Monks of 
Christ∣church. Waretius de Valoigns
 is in the Catalogue of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen who assisted 
Richard
 the first at the Siege of 
Acon
 in 
Palestine. Robert de Valoigns
 had the Repute of a Baron in the thirteenth year of 
Henry
 the third, and under that Notion held the fourth part of a Knights Fee of 
Wallingford
 Castle. 
Allan de Valoigns,
 was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the thirty first, thirty second, thirty third, and thirty fourth years of 
Henry
 the third, and held his Shrievalty at 
Swerdling. Waretius de Valoigns
 in the forty fifth year of 
Henry
 the third, by his Deed remits divers Services to 
Cicely
 Wife of 
Robert de Grencbold
 which were due from her to his Mannor of 
Swerdling. William de Valoigns
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth years of 
Edward
 the first, and his Son Sir 
William de Valoigns
 was engaged with 
Edward
 the first at the Siege of 
Carlaverock
 in 
Scotland,
 and for some remarkable Service there performed, received the Order of Knighthood. 
Henry de Valoigns
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the four∣teenth year of 
Edward
 the third, and he had Issue 
Waretius de Valoigns,
 in whom the Male-line failed, so that his two Daughters, (one matched to Sir 
Thomas Fogge
 Grand∣child to 
Otho Fogge,
 who came out of 
Lancashire
 into 
Kent
 about the Beginning of 
Edw.
 the first, and the other wedded to 
Tho. de Aldon
) became his Heirs: and this upon the breaking of the estate into parcels fell to be the proportion of 
Fogge,
 in which Name after it had for divers ages continued fixed, it was in that Age we style our Grandfathers alienated to 
Spelman,
 and this Family not many years since determining in a Female Heir, it is now by matching with her become the Inheritance of 
Hadds.


Sapinton
 in 
Petham
 was the Inheritance of a Family called 
Bregge;
 for in the forty second year of 
Edward
 the third, I find 
Jo. Bregge
 conveys this Mannor to Sir 
Richard Atteleeze,
 and he dying without Issue, it descended to 
Marcellus Atteleeze,
 who was his Brother and Heir at Law; but he suddenly after expir'd, and with him the Name in Daughters and Coheirs, whereof 
Luce
 who was one of them, was first matched to 
John Norton
 Esq; and after to 
William Langley
 of 
Knolton,
 whose Heirs about the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, concurred in a joynt and mutual Bargain and Sale, and pas∣sed away their Interest in this Mannor; which was too much disordered and ravel'd whilst it lay thus mingled, to 
George Ballard
 Esquire; from whom by the Clew of seve∣ral Ages the Title went along to 
Nicholas Ballard
 Esquire, who about the latter end of 
Philip
 and 
Mary,
 alienated it to 
Langford,
 and from this Name the four Brothers joyning in the Sale; in that Age which was circumscribed within our Fathers Remem∣brance, it was carried off by Sale to 
Cranmer
 of 
Canterbury,
 whose Son Mr. ........ 
Cranmer
 is by Descent, successively entituled to the present Propriety of it.


Hauts-place
 in this Parish was the Fountain from whence that noble Family which fell under that Sirname originally streamed out, which afterwards dispersed it self in sub-divided Rivolets over the face of this County. 
Ivo de Haut,
 the first of this Name that ancient Record represents to us, is mentioned in a Book kept in the Exchequer called 
Liber de Terris Templariorum,
 which is a Survey of those Lands that Order held in 
England
 in the year of 
Grace
 One thousand one hundred and eighty; and there it is

affirmed that he held this Mannor of 
Temple Waltham,
 and from this 
Ivo de Haut
 did the Title in a never-ebbing Current of Descent glide down to Sir 
William Haut,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the sixteenth year, and then again promoted to that Office in the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and not long after deceased, and with him the Name found its Funeral in two Daughters and Co-heirs, one of which termed 
Elizabeth,
 was matched to 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bedgebury
 Esquire, to whom this place in the right of his Wife devolved. And from his Family in the Age within the con∣fines of our Grand-fathers Remembrance, it was passed away by Sale to 
Salkeld,
 who not many years since conveyed the Possession over to 
Bateman.


There was a Chauntry founded at 
Depden
 in this Parish (as appears by a Manuscript in the Hands of Mr. 
Thomas Den
 Recorder of 
Canterbury,
 lately deceased,) founded and endowed by 
William Gratian
 Priest in the Raign of 
Henry
 the fourth; Whose Re∣venue upon the Dissolution of this Chauntry in the second year of 
Edward
 the sixth, was granted to 
Jo. Come
 and 
Richard Almot,
 who not long after passed it away to 
Wilt. Forbrasse
 Yeoman, a Name in some old Deeds written 
Fortbrasse,
 which argues it to be of French extraction, and from this Family it was about the Beginning of K. 
James
 carried off by Sale to 
Gregory,
 who within the Verge of some few years fast past, alie∣nated the Title to 
Sladden
 of 
Liminge.


Postling
 lies in the Hundred of 
Hene,
 and was, in Ages of a very high Ascent, the Patrimony of the Noble Family of 
Columbers,
 a Name in Times of elder Cognisance of very great reputation in the 
West
 of 
England; Philip de Columbariis
 or 
Columbers,
 held it at his Decease, which was in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 5. But after him I discover no more of this Family at this place. The next that is repre∣sented to be Possessor of it, is 
Hugh de Audley,
 and he held it as appears by ancient Court-rolls in the raign of 
Edward
 the second, and 
Edward
 the third, and passed it a∣way to 
Delves
 of 
Delves Court
 in the County of 
Chester,
 where it seems it had no long aboad; for about the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
John de Delves
 alienates it to 
Richard
 Earl of 
Arundell;
 for which the Earl is pardoned, because he purchased it without License first obtained from the King as appears, 
Pat. de An
o
 43. 
Edw. tertii Parte secunda Memb. septim.
 And in this Family was it for many Generations fixed and resident; until the thirty eighth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was by Sale transmitted to Sir 
Anthony Aucher.
 But the Tenure of it in this Family was brief and Transitory; for about the Beginning of Q. 
Elizabeth
 it went away from this Name to 
Robert Cranmer
 Esquire, Nephew to 
Thomas Cranmer
 Arch-bishop of 
Can∣terbury,
 who expiring in a Female Heir, she brought it along with her to Sir 
Arthur Harris
 of 
Crixey
 in 
Essex;
 from whom it is devolved to his Son and Heir Sir 
Cranmer Harris,
 who holds the instant Possession of it.


Henewood
 is another Mannor in this Parish, from whence the 
Honywood
 of 
Elm∣sted,
 and those of 
Pett
 in 
Charing
 do extract their Sirname: And 
Edmund de Honywood
 who in the raign of 
Hen.
 the third is remembred in the Front and Van of those in the 
Leiger
 Book of 
Horton
 Priory, who were munificent Benefactors to that Covent, is set down there to have been of 
Postling,
 and as this Place was then, so is it still through all that Flux and Decursion of Time which hath since elapsed, wound up in that revenue, which acknowledges the Signorie and Jurisdiction of this ancient Name and Family.


Pluckley
 in the Hundred of 
Calehill,
 was originally a Mannor which owned the Arch-bishops of 
Canterbury
 for Lords of the Fee, until 
Lanfranc
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury
 gave it to 
William
 Brother of 
John de Cobham,
 who in the Grant is styled 
Miles Archiepiscopi;
 not that he was ever any Knight or Souldier that attended upon him; but that he granted him this Mannor to hold in Knights Service of him and his Successors, which was very usual and customary for the Arch-bishops and other great Prelates to do; until King 
Edward
 the first growing jealous of the Power and Gran∣deur of the Clergie, who endeavoured by their Bounty and magnificent Donations to oblige both the principal of the Nobility and Gentry, and chain them up by these extraordinary Engagements to their Devotion, caused the Statute called 
Quia emptores Terrarum,
 in the one and twentieth of his raign to be made, which restrains and

supersedes for the future all new Creations of Mannors. But to proceed, 
VVilliam de Cobham
 being thus enstated in this Mannor, in Gratitude to the first Donor, al∣tered his Name from 
Cobham
 to 
Pluckley.
 Sir 
Richard de Pluckley
 this mans Grand∣child, flourished in the raign of King 
Stephen,
 and 
Henry
 the second, and founded the Church at 
Pluckley;
 and from this man did 
VVilliam de Pluckley
 lineally branch out, in whom the Male-Line concluded, so that 
Agnes
 his Daughter and Heir, by matching with 
John Surrenden
 Esquire, cast 
Pluckley
 into the Possession of that Name and Family: where it had not long sojourned, when the same Vicissitude brought it over to 
Haut:
 for 
James Haut
 wedded 
Joan
 Heir General of 
John Surrenden,
 and so became Possessor of 
Pluckley;
 but in this Name the Title was as volatile and mu∣table as in the former: for this man went out in Daughters and Co-heirs, one of them was wedded to 
Gouldwell,
 and 
Christian
 the other was matched to 
John Dering
 Esquire, in whose Right he was entituled to the Signory of 
Pluckley.
 Now if you will inquire, where lay the ancient Land of 
Dering,
 if my Assertion might be cre∣dited, I should affirm, that it was at 
Stamford
 by 
Hieth,
 where they were Lords of some part of the little Mannot of 
Heyton:
 for by an old Roll, I find that 
Nor∣manus de Morinis,
 married 
Kineburga
 Daughter and Heir of 
Deringus,
 and his Son as was Customary in those Times, called himself 
Deringus de Morinis,
 and matched with 
Elveva
 Sister and Heir of 
Alanus de Heyton,
 and so was invested in the Proprie∣ty of the Mannor of 
Heyton,
 from whom it successively came down to 
Richard Fitz Dering,
 who was Son of 
Dering,
 and great Grand-child to this man, who was the first who deserted the Sirname 
de Morinis,
 and assumed that of 
Dering,
 and died possest of the Mannor of 
Heyton,
 in the forty second year of 
Henry
 the third. And from this 
Richard Fitz Dering
 is Sir 
Edward Dering
 Baronet, now lineally extracted, who is the instant Lord of 
Pluckley
 and 
Surrenden Dering,
 where Sir 
Edward Dering
 Knight and Baronet, not many years since deceased, raised that elegant Structure, as eminent for its Magnificence and Beauty, as it is for its Contrivance and Curio∣sity.


Pevington
 was formerly a Parish, and had a Church dedicated to St. 
Mary,
 though it be now languished into Dis-use, and grown an adjunct to 
Pluckley;
 The Patrons as well as Proprietaries of it were the 
Pevingtons,
 a Knightly Family, who borrowed their Sirname from hence. The first whom I meet with, is Sir 
Ralph de Pevington,
 who flourished here, in the raign of King 
John,
 and King 
Henry
 the third, and was Father to Sir 
William de Pevington,
 who likewise died possest of this Mannor, in the fifty fourth year of 
Henry
 the third, from whom descended 
John
 and 
William Pevington,
 who dying without Issue, in the seventh year of 
Henry
 the fourth, 
Amabilia
 their Sister, matched to 
John Gobion,
 became their Heir, and she lies buried in the Church of 
Austin-Friars
 at 
Canterbury,
 and is mentioned to have been a liberal Benefactresse to that Cloister, about the Time of her Decease, which was 1405. and had Issue by him 
Julian
 their only Daughter, who was about the twenty seventh year of 
Henry
 the sixth, matched to 
William Brent,
 from whom descended 
Thomas Brent,
 in whom the Name and Male-Line together was extin∣guished, so that 
Margaret Brent
 matched to 
John Dering,
 was the visible Heir of his Estate, amongst which this Mannor of 
Pevington,
 was enwrapped, which came down in Right of this Alliance to Sir 
Edward Dering
 Knight and Baronet, who up∣on his Decease gave it after the Death of his Mother, the Widow Dowager of Sir 
Anthony Dering,
 to Mr. 
Henry Dering,
 the eldest Son by his last Lady.


Malmains
 in 
Pluckley,
 was the Inheritance of a Family of that Sirname. 
Elea∣nor
 Wife of 
John de Malmins
 died seised of it, in the fourteenth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 51. And after by Court-rols, I discover 
Henry Malmains
 to be possest of it, from whom it descended to 
Richard Malmains,
 who died (as the Date upon his Tomb-stone in 
Plukley
 Church discovers to us) in the year 1440. and left 
John Malmains
 his Heir, after whom I descry no farther mention of this Family; at this place: The next Family which succeeded in the Inheritance was 
Dering,
 not by any Right derived from 
Haut:
 for they had espoused the Heir of that Name before 
Malmains
 was extinguished: nor could it be by any Female Heir atchieved, for there were but two Co-heirs of this Branch of 
Malmains,
 who were wedded to 
Monins
 and 
Gouldwell.
 And if it be answered that 
Dering
 married the

Heir of the eldest House: To that I answer, that 
Nicholas Malmains,
 who was of the elder Line, deceased in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 15. and left only a Daughter and Heir, who was matched to 
William de Grandison:
 so that it is evident by the Premises, that this Mannor of 
Malmains
 devolved to 
Dering
 the instant Proprietary, not by any match of 
Haut,
 or of this Family it self, by any Female Heir or Coheir of 
Malmains,
 but by Purchase only.


Shurland
 is the last place of Account: It hath been the Patrimony of 
Betenham
 of 
Be∣tenham
 in 
Cranbroke,
 for many Hundred years. 
Stephen de Betenham
 is mentioned in Court-rols, which take their Rise or Date from the Government of 
Hen,
 the third: and certainly this is that 
Stephen de Betenham,
 which is mentioned to be one of the 
Re∣cognitores Magnae Assisae,
 (an Office of very great Importance in elder Times) in those Pipe-rols, which relate to the raign of King 
John;
 and from this 
Stephen
 hath the Title of this place, by a constant and even Chain of Ages, threaded together into an unbroken Succession, come down to Mr. 
Betenham,
 who holds the present Sig∣nory and Possession of it.


Plumsted
 in the Hundred of 
Lesnes,
 was in the year of Grace 960. given by King 
Edgar,
 to the Abbot and Convent of St. 
Augustins
 in 
Canterbury
 (as 
Thorne
 their Chronicler testifies) under the Notion of four ploughed Lands, which afterwards 
Godwin
 Earl of 
Kent,
 violently tore from their Patrimony, and setled upon his Son 
Tostius:
 but it was restored to that Seminary by 
William
 the Conqueror, and remained fastned to their Revenue, until the rough hand of 
Henry
 the eighth, by a publick suppression unlinked it, and then it was by that Prince, in the thirty sixth year of his raign, granted to Sir 
Edward Boughton
 of 
Burwash-court,
 from whom it is now devolved by Descent to his Successor Mr. ...... 
Boughton.


The Abbot of St. 
Augustines,
 to adde more eminence to this Mannor, not only obtained a Charter of Free-warren to 
Plumsted,
 in the thirty sixth year of 
Henry
 the third; but likewise by Grant procured a Market to be held here weekly on the Tuesday, and a Fair yearly three Dayes, at St. 
Nicolas, videlicet,
 the Eve, the Day, and Day after; both which were allowed before the Judges Itinerant, in the seventh year of 
Edward
 the first.


Plumsted
 had anciently Laws and Ordinances for the better securing the Mounds and Banks of the Mersh, against the Eruptions and Inundations of the Thames, which almost were of the same Resemblance and Complexion with those of 
Romney
 Mersh. A Scale of several Statutes, are delivered to us by 
Rastall
 in his Abridge∣ment, which concerned the Inning and preserving of 
Plumsted Level.
 The first was enacted in the twenty second year of 
Henry
 the eighth, 
Cap.
 3. and was printed. The second was made in the fourteenth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and was never printed. The third was ratified in the twenty third of Queen 
Elizabeth Cap.
 13. and printed. The fourth and last was confirmed, in the twenty seventh year of Queen 
Elizabeth, Cap.
 27. and likewise printed.


Burwash-court
 is an eminent Seat in this Parish; made more illustrious by being wrapped up in the Revenue of the Noble Family of 
Burgherst
 or 
Burwash. Bartho∣lomew de Burgherst
 died possest of it, in the twenty eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 38. And left it to his Son 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Burwash,
 who in the forty third year of the above-said Prince, coveyed it with much other Land to Sir 
Walter de Paveley,
 Knight of the Garter, in which Family it continued, until the raign of 
Richard
 the second, and then it was alienated to 
VVilliam Chichley,
 Al∣derman of 
London,
 who left it to his Son 
John Chichley,
 by whose Daughter and Heir 
Agnes,
 it came to be possest by 
John Tattershal
 of 
VVell-hall
 in 
Eltham:
 who about the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, conveyed it to 
Boughton,
 in the Descendants of which Family, it had a permanent aboad, untill that Age that our Remembrance had an Aspect on, and then it was passed away to Mr. 
Rowland VVilson
 of 
London,
 and he upon his late Decease, gave it to his Daughter and her Heirs, who was first matched to Doctour ...... 
Crisp,
 and now secondly to Colonel ...... 
Row
 of 
Hackney.








R. R. R. R.


RAdigunds,
 vulgarly called the Abby of St. 
Radigunds,
 leads up the Van of this Register: It was founded by 
Hugh
 the first Abbot, who was before a Monk in the Priory of 
Christ-church,
 in the raign of King 
Stephen,
 as the Book of 
Christ∣church,
 and the Return into the Court of Augmentation made in the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, do both inform me. Their Rule was derived from 
Austin Bishop
 of 
Hippo,
 their Habit Black, whence they are sometimes styled Black-Canons, and sometimes Canons of St. 
Austins.
 The Revenue which appertained to this Cloi∣ster, lay not fat divided from this place, as namely at 
Alkham, Sotemore, Combe, Hawking, Padlesworth,
 and 
Pising,
 where they had a Mannor, as appears by an Inquisition, taken in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 147. This upon the Dissolution lapsing with all its Revenue to the Crown, King 
Henry
 the eighth, exchanged 
Pising
 with 
Thomas Cranmer
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury;
 but the Mannor of St. 
Radigunds
 it self, remained annexed to the Royal Revenue, until Queen 
Elizabeth
 in the thirty second year of her raign, granted it to 
Simon Edolph
 Esquire, descended from the 
Edolphs
 of 
Romney Mersh,
 where they were very an∣cient, in whose Successor, Sir ...... 
Edolph,
 the propriety of this place is still re∣sident.


Raculver
 in the Hundred of 
VVhitstaple,
 had a Monastery founded here, for Monks to live under the Rule of St. 
Bennet:
 But the Mannor it self was given with all its Train of Appendages, as namely, Pasture, Glebe, Mersh-land, and the adjacent Shore, and estimated at twenty five Mansions or Cottages, 
bis denis senisque estima∣tum Cassatis
 (those are the words of the Record by King 
Eadredus,
 in the year nine hundred forty and eight) to the Sea of 
Canterbury,
 in the presence of his Queen 
Edgiva,
 and Arch-bishop 
Odo:
 and if you will descry what Estimate it had in the Time of the Conqueror, 
Doomes-day
 Book will afford you a discovery.

English
 Pence) 
minus.


Though the Church be now full of Solitude, and languished into Decay; yet when 
Leland
 made his Perambulation, it was in a more splendid Equipage. If you please to hear him, he thus describes it; The old Building of the Abby Church, continues (says he) having two goodly spiring Steeples. In the entring into the Quire, is one of the fairest and most ancient Crosses, that ever I saw, nine Foot in height, it stan∣deth like a fair Columne. The 
Basis
 is a great stone, it is not wrought; the second Stone, being round, hath curiously wrought and and painted the Images of our Sa∣viour 
Christ, Peter, Paul, John
 and 
James; Christ
 saith 
Ego sum Alpha & Omega; Peter
 saith 
Tu es Christus Filius Dei vivi.
 The sayings of the other three, were painted, 
Majusculis Literis Romanis,
 but now obliterated. The second Stone is of the Passion, The third Stone contains the Twelve Apostles. The fourth hath the Image of our Saviour hanging and fastned with four Nails, 
& sub pedibus susten∣taculum:
 The highest part of the Pillar hath the Figure of a Crosse. In the Church is a very ancient Book of the Evangelies, 
in Majusculis Literis Romanis,
 and in the Borders thereof is a Crystal Stone, thus inscribed, 
Claudia Atepiccus.
 In the North-side of the Church, is the Figure of a Bishop painted under an Arch; In digging about the Church, they find old Buckles and Rings: The whole Print of the Monastery appears by the old Wall. And the Vicarage was made of the Ruines of the Monastery. There is a neglected Chappel out of the Church-yard, where some say was a Paroch-Church, before the Abby was suppressed, and given to the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury.
 Thus far he.


But the greatest Honor which in elder Times did accrew to this Village, was, that King 
Ethelbert,
 after he had founded the Abby of St. 
Austins,
 removed his Residence from 
Canterbury,
 and fixed his Pallace at this place, which his Successors the Kings

of 
Kent,
 enobled by their presence; but when this Kingdome was swallowed up in that of 
Mercia,
 and 
Mercia
 afterwards in that of the West-
Saxons;


 this Mansion of theirs found a Sepulcher likewise in their Ruines; so that now we can trace it out no where, but in Annals and History, since even the very Ruines of the Ruines them∣selves, have now got an unknown enterment.


Helburgh
 is an ancient Seat in this Parish: The first that I find possest it, was 
Ni∣cholas Tingewike,
 originally descended from 
Tingewick
 in the County of 
Buckingham,
 and who likewise held large possessions at 
Dartford,
 and he dyed seised of it, in the fourteenth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 182. After this Family de∣serted the possession, the 
Pines
 became its Proprietaries, of which Family was 
James de la Pine,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the twenty sixth, and twenty seventh years of 
Edward
 the third, and was in the possession of this place at his Decease, which was in the thirty third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 13. And left it to his Son 
Thomas Pine,
 after whom I meet with another 
James Pine,
 who about the Begin∣ning of 
Henry
 the fourth, passed it away to 
Cheyney,
 and in this Family did it reside, untill the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 and then the Lord 
Henry Cheyney,
 who then began to retail himself, and his estate out to Ruine in parcels, alienated this to 
Maycott,
 whose Son Sir 
Cavaliero Maycott,
 that eminent Courtier in the reign of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and King 
James,
 in the entrance of that Prince into his Govern∣ment, passed it away to Sir 
Christopher Clive;
 and he immediately after, conveyed it away to 
Contry,
 vulgarly called 
Cuntry,
 whose Son Mr. 
Thomas Contry,
 almost in our memory, cast it by Sale into the possession of Sir 
Edward Masters
 of 
Canterbu∣ry,
 whose Son 
Richard Masters
 Esquire, is entituled to the instant possession of it.


Reinham
 in the Hundred of 
Milton,
 with 
Mere-court
 was, in the reign of 
H.
 the first, the patrimony of the noble Family of 
Camville. Robert de Camville,
 was engaged with 
Richard
 the first, at the Siege of 
Acon
 in 
Palestine. Robert de Camville
 his Son,

 was an Assistant to 
Henry
 the third, in the forty second of his Rule, when he marched from 
Chester
 against the 
Welsh. Geffrey de Camville
 was frequently summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron, in the reign of 
Edward
 the first. After this Family was worn out, the noble Family of 
Leybourn
 of 
Leybourn
 Castle, was entituled to the Inheritance. 
Henry de Leybourn,
 held it in the twenty eighth year of 
Edward
 the first, and so did 
Thomas de Leybourn,
 in the thirty fifth year of that Prince's Government, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 10. And so did his Brother likewise, 
William de Leybourn,
 who held the grea∣test part of it at his Death, which was in the third year of 
Edward
 the second; and transmitted it to his Kinsman 
Roger de Leybourn,
 in whom the Male-line determined, and he left it in Dower to his Wife 
Juliana de Leybourn,
 who held it at her Death, which was in the third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 86. And after her Decease, it was enstated on his and her Daughter and Heir 
Juliana de Leybourn,
 who for her vast Income, merited the Title of 
Infanta
 of 
Kent;
 and she married for her first Husband 
Iohn de Hasting,
 a Kinsman of 
Laurence de Hasting:
 but he dyed without any Issue by her, upon whose Exit, she was espoused to 
William de Clinton,
 Earl of 
Huntingdon,
 Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, who likewise deceased without any posterity by her, in the twenty eighth year of 
Edward
 the third; after whose Decease she continued a Widow untill her Death, which was in the forty third year of the a∣bove-mentioned Prince, 
Rot. Ese. Num.
 57. And is styled in the Escheat-roll 
Comitissa de Huntington,
 which fortifies the former Assertion, that she continued in the State of Widowhood, till her dissolution; upon whose decease, the Crown upon an exact and solemne Inquisition, discovering none that could inforce any Claim either directly and lineally, or else by collateral deduction, entitled it self to her estate, as legally es∣cheated: and that Prince, in the fiftieth year of his reign, grants it to the Abbey of St. 
Mary Grace
 on 
Tower-hill;
 where it was fixt, until it was by the Suppression, wrested away, and then K. 
Edward
 the sixth, in the second year of his reign, granted it to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney,
 Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, and one of the Privy Councel to that Prince: whose Son 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney,
 in the thirteenth year of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 passed it away by Sale to 
Samuel Thornhil
 Esquire, who upon his decease, gave it by Testament to his second Son Sir 
Iohn Thornhil
 not many years deceased,

whose eldest Son 
Charles Thornhill
 Esquire, is the present Heir to the propriety of it.


Silham
 is a second place considerable. It was the Mansion formerly of a Family of no despicable extraction, whose Sirname was 
Donett: John Donett
 dyed possest of this and part of the Mannor of 
Reinham,
 in the thirtieth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 57. And left them to his Son 
Iohn Donett,
 who likewise was in the possession of them at his Death, which was in the thirty sixth year of the above-named Prince; and had Issue 
Iohn Donett,
 in whom the Male-line failed, so that his Lands at 
Reinham,
 and 
Silham,
 devolved by 
Margery
 his Sole Daughter and Heir, to 
Iohn St. Leger
 Esquire, Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the ninth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and was descended from 
Hugh St. Leger,
 who was one of the 
Recognitores magnae Assisae,
 (an Office of a very great Latitude and Circumference of power in elder Times) in the second and seventh years of King 
Iohn.
 In the 
St. Legers,
 the possession of these places rested not long; for not long after that Interest which he had in 
Reinham,
 to 
Cheyney,
 and 
Silham
 to 
Bloer; Cheyney
 transmitted his Concernment, with that part of 
Reinham
 that rela∣ted to the Priory of 
Leeds,
 to 
Sámuel Thornhill
 Esquire, who disposed of it upon his death, as is abovesaid: but 
Christopher Bloer,
 determined in 
Olympia Bloer,
 his Heir General, who brought it over to Mr. 
Iohn Tufton,
 in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth; from whom it is now come down, to the right honorable 
Iohn Tufton
 Earl of 
Thanett,
 who possesses the present Signory of it.


Reyersh
 in the Hundred of 
Lerkefield,
 though a Village of no great Account in it self,

 yet is disengaged of its original Obscurity, by the splendor and eminence of those who successively possest it. The first whom I find concerned in it, was 
Hugh de Crescie,
 originally, in all probability, extracted from 
Crescie
 who is mentioned in the Battle Abby-roll; and he dyed seised of it, in the forty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 42. After this Family was mouldered away, the 
Says
 of 
Cold∣ham
 were interessed in the possession, and 
Geffrey de Say
 possest it in the fifteenth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 20. The next Family in Succession to these was the 
Mowbrays,
 and 
Elizabeth
 Wife of 
Thomas
 Duke of 
Norfolk,
 and Daughter of 
Richard
 Earl of 
Arundell,
 held it at her Decease, which was in the third year of 
Henry
 the sixth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 25. And so did her Son 
John Mowbray
 Duke of 
Norfolke,
 who deceased in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the sixth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 129. And was descended from 
John Mowbray,
 who held it (as appears by ancient Court-rolls (as parcel of the Barony of 
Bedford
) in the reign of 
Edward
 the second. After the 
Mowbrays,
 the 
Nevill,
 Barons of 
Aburgavenny,
 were invested in the Fee, and remained seated in the possession, until the reign of Q 
Elizabeth,
 and then 
Henry
 Lord 
Nevill,
 in the twenty ninth year dying without Issue-male, it was disposed with much other Land to his Brother Sir 
Edward Nevill,
 from whom it is now brought down to his Grandchild 
John
 Lord 
Nevill,
 who enjoys the instant Inheritance of it.


Ridley
 in the Hundred of 
Acstane,
 acknowledges it self to have been anciently a Branch of the patrimony of the Lords 
Leybourn:
 and 
Rog. de Leybourn,
 in the 55
th.
 year of 
H.
 the third, sells 
Ridley
 excepting the Advowson, to 
Bartholomew VVodeton.
 In which Family the Title was not very permanent; for in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, I find the 
VVallis's
 to have been its Proprietaries; 
Augustin VVallis
 obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of 
Ridley
 in the twenty second year of 
Edward
 the third, and dyed possest of it, in the twenty eighth year of that Prince's Government, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 55. After the 
VVallis's
 were expired and vanished, the 
Rickhills
 held this Mannor, where it was not long constant; for 
VVilliam Rickhill
 about the sixteenth of 
Henry
 the sixth, conveyed it by Deed to 
Tho. Edingham
 or 
Engham;
 who again in the ninteenth year of the abovesaid Prince, passed it away by Fine to 
Robert Savery;
 from which Name not many years after, it came by the same Vicissitude, to be the Inheri∣tance of 
Bevill,
 in whose Descendants it remained, untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was by purchase fastned to the demeasn of 
Fitz:
 and 
VValter Fitz
 by Deed, whose dare commences from the twenty seventh of 
Henry
 the eighth, conveyed it to 
Will. Sidley
 of 
Southfleet
 Esq; Ancestor to Sir 
Charles Sidley
 Baronet, to whom upon

the late Decease of his Brother Sir 
William Sidley,
 it owns for its present Posses∣sor.


Ridlingswould
 is a Member of 
Dover,


 and was parcel of the Honor of 
Ful∣berts,
 and 
Fulbert de Dover
 held it, as appears by 
Doomes-day
 Book, in the twentieth year of 
William
 the Conqueror, in Ages of a nearer Approach to us, that is, in the raign of 
Henry
 the third. 
Richard de Dover,
 and 
Roesia
 his Wife were possest of it, as appears, 
Ex Bundellis Annor. incertorum Henrici tertii, Rot. Esc. Num.
 237. When this Family went out, the 
Badelesmeres
 stept in. 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 that powerful Baron, obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands here, in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the second, and was Steward too, to the Houshold of King 
Edward
 the second, as appears by a Confirmation of the Charter of the City of 
London,
 which bears Date from that year of 
Edward
 the second, and to which he as Teste writes himself Steward of the Kings Houshold; but not long after being entangled in that Combination, which was made by 
Thomas
 Earl of 
Lancaster,
 and sundry other Barons against that Prince, he forfeited both his Estate and Life, as the price of that seditious Attempt; but this with much other Land was restored to his Son 
Bar∣tholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 in the second year of 
Edward
 the third, but he died without Issue, in the twelfth year of that Prince, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 44. So that his large Revenue was proportionably divided between his four Sisters and Co-heirs, where∣of this was a Limb, and fell in upon the partition to the Inheritance of 
John Vere
 Earl of 
Oxford
 by 
Matilda de Badelesmer,
 and he held it at his Death, which was in the fortieth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 38. But in this Family it did not long continue after his 
Exit;
 for in the raign of 
Richard
 the second, I find 
Robert Belknap
 possest of it, and enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the second year of 
Henry
 the fourth, after his Return from his Exilement into 
Ireland,
 whither he was banished for his too active asserting the Prerogative against the Liberty of the Populacie, in the tenth year of 
Richard
 the second. In the second year of 
Richard
 the third, I find 
William Belknap
 Esquire, was in the Fruition of it at his Decease, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 16. and from him did it devolve to his Successor Sir 
Henry Belknap,
 in whom this Name was extinguisht, so that his Estate was resolved into several par∣cels, which came over to 
Alice
 his Daughter and Co-heir matched to Sir 
William Shelley, Anne
 married to Sir 
Robert Wotton,
 and 
Elizabeth
 wedded to Sir 
Philip Cooke
 of 
Giddie-hall
 in 
Essex,
 and in these Families did the complicated Interest of this place remain concentered, until that Age, which fell under our Grand-fathers Cognisance, and then it was by joint-Concurrence passed away to 
Edelph,
 from whom it is brought down to Sir ...... 
Edolph,
 who holds the present Signory of it.


Oxney-house
 in this Parish, was an Ancient Seat of the Noble Family of 
Criol. Matilda
 Widow of 
Simon de Criol
 died possest of it, in the fifty second year of 
Henry
 the third, and transmitted it to 
Bertram de Criol,
 who held it at his death, which was in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 After him his Son 
Bertram de Criol
 was setled in the possession, but was not long liv'd after his Fa∣ther, for he died in the thirty fourth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 37. and left it to his Brother 
John Criol,
 who dying without Issue, it was brought over to his Sister 
Joan Criol,
 who by matching with Sir 
Richard de Rokesley,
 made it the In∣heritance of that Name and Family, and was in possession of it at her Death, which was in the fifteenth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 95. From whom it came down to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Poynings,
 who had espoused 
Agnes
 one of the Coheirs of them two, and in Right of this Alliance was his Successor, 
Richard
 Lord 
Poyning
 found invested in it at his Death, which was in the fifteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Parte prima, Rot. Esc. Num.
 53. and left it to his Kinsman 
Robert de Poynings,
 who passed it away by Sale to 
Tame,
 and in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, 
Robert Tame
 paid respective 
Aid
 for it, at the Marriage of 
Blanch
 that Kings Daughter. After 
Tame
 was worn out, the 
Sidleys
 possest it, and 
John Sidley
 Esquire, who was Auditor to 
Henry
 the seventh, added much to this House, as well as to his Estate, and from him is it now descended to Sir 
Charles Sidley
 Baronet, whom it owns for present Lord of the Fee.




Ripple
 in the Hundred of 
Cornile,
 was a Mannor which alwayes related to the Abby of St. 
Austins,
 and was, in the Surrender of this Abby into the Hands of 
Henry
 eighth, in the twenty ninth year of that Prince, found to be involved in the De∣measne of that Covent, from whom it went over to the Crown, and remained there until Queen 
Elizabeth,
 in the thirty second year of her Government, passed it away to Sir 
John Hall,
 who not long after alienated his Interest here to 
Gokin,
 in which Family the Propriety hath ever since continued. But 
Watling
 was originally of se∣cular Concernment, and was wound up in the Patrimony of the Lord 
Leybourn. Thomas de Leybourn
 enjoyed it at his Decease, which was in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 10. From whom it went along with the Residue of his Estate to his Son Sir 
Roger de Leybourn,
 with whom the Male-Line sunk into his Se∣pulcher, and 
Juliana de Leybourn
 was his Sole Heir, and she was first matched to 
Iohn de Hastings,
 and afterwards to 
William de Clinton
 Earl of 
Huntington,
 but had no Issue by neither, nor was there any which could, by a Claim of collateral Affinity, stave off the Claim and pretences of the Crown unto her Estate; so that, upon her Decease, which was in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third, that Prince seised upon her Inheritance as an Escheat, and his Granchild 
Richard
 the second, granted this to the Abby of 
Chidrens Langley,
 upon whose suppression it devolved with all its per∣quisites to the Crown; and 
Henry
 the eighth, granted it in the thirty fifth year of his raign to Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 one of the Justices at that Time of this County, from whom by 
Amy
 his Daughter and Coheir, it was cemented into the Patrimony of Sir 
Thomas Kempe:
 but it was not long after unsodered, for in the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth
 it was sold to 
William Sherley
 of 
Sussex,
 who in our Grand-fathers Remembrance alienated it to 
Crayford
 of 
Mongeham,
 whose Successor (not with∣out an eager contest commenced with one 
Durbon
 and 
Kidder,
 by his Predecessor, who pretended an Interest in it, conveyed to them by an antecedent Judge∣ment, acknowledged by the above-said 
Shirley
) is now setled in the Possession of it.


River
 in the Hundred of 
Bewsborough,
 contains two remarkable places within the Boundaries of it. The first is 
Kersoney,
 which was the Inheritance of a Fa∣mily called 
Paganell,
 or more vulgarly 
Paynell. Isolda
 Wife of 
John Paynell,
 held it at her Death, which was in the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the second. In Times of a lower Descent, I find it in the Tenure of 
Phineux,
 the last of which Name at this Place was Sir 
John Phineux,
 Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, in the raign of 
Henry
 the seventh, and he determining in Daughters and Co-heirs, 
Jane
 one of them, by matching with 
John Roper
 of St. 
Dunstans
 Esquire, made it the Patrimony of that Family, from whom in our Grand-fathers Remembrance, it was passed away to 
Best,
 Ancestor to Mr. ...... 
Best
 of 
Can∣terbury
 Esquire, who is the instant Proprietary of it. The second is 
Archers
-Court, which gave both Seat and Sirname to a Family so called; one 
Nicolas Archer
 held it in the first year of 
Edward
 the second, and so did 
Thomas le Archer,
 in the third year of 
Edward
 the third, and left it to his Son 
William Archer,
 who paid respective 
Aide
 for his Lands here at 
River,
 and at 
Atterton,
 and 
Coperland,
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight. From 
Archer
 it came to a Family called 
Baudrede,
 and continued divers years in this Name, un∣til in the first year of 
Edward
 the fourth, it was conveyed by Sale with 
Coperland
 to 
Thomas Doilie
 Esquire. Afterwards, in the raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, it was ex∣changed with the Crown, and that Prince, in the thirty sixth year of his managing the 
English
 Scepter, granted it to Sir 
James Hales,
 in whose Family it remained un∣til almost that Time, which we entitle to our Fathers Remembrance, and then a part of it was passed away by Sale to 
Lee,
 but the other parcel continued constant to the Interest of 
Hales,
 until not many years since, not only that proportion, which was in the possession of 
Lee,
 but likewise that other above-mentioned, were both alienated by their respective Proprietaries to Sir 
Hardres Waller.


Rodmersham
 in the Hundred of 
Milton,
 was the Inheritance of a Family, whose Sirname was 
Pine: John de la Pine
 enjoyed it, in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the

third, as appears by private Evidences, and so did 
James de la Pine
 his Grandchild, who deceased in the thirty seventh year of 
Edward
 the third, and left it to his Son and Heir 
James de la Pine,
 a Child of nine years old, at his Fathers Exit; and he pre∣served it untill the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, and then it was transmitted by Sale to 
Podach,
 now called vulgarly 
Pordage,
 descended originally from 
John de Podach,
 who flourished as appears by an ancient Pedigree, relating to this Fami∣ly, in the raign of 
Henry
 the third, and held Lands in the County of 
Devon,
 which bore his Name, and was called 
Podach;
 and from this above-mentioned 
Iohn,
 is Mr. 
Tho. Pordage aliàs Podach,
 now of 
Rodmersham,
 by a multiplyed Efflux of many Descents lineally extracted, and bears now the 
Fesse
 in his Coat Armour, plain, whereas by anci∣ent Monuments, and Seals affixed to old Evidences it is manifest, his Ancestors bore it 
Checque.
 Upon what Grounds, the modern Alteration is establisht, I confesse I know not; it is enough, that the Dignity of the Family, is yet supported, by that ancient Inheritance, which they have for so many Ages, and yet do possesse, here at 
Rodmersham.


Pitstock
 in 
Rodmersham,
 is a little Mannor, which augmented the Revenue of the Nuns of 
Minster
 in 
Shepey,
 but when that ruinous Tempest broke forth in the raign of 
Henry
 the eighth, which like an 
Hurricano
 tore up by the Roots the Ecclesiastical Patrimony, this was supplanted and thrown into the Demeasne of the Crown, and then the abovesaid Prince, in the twenty ninth year of his Rule, granted it to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney,
 and his Son 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney,
 about the thirteenth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 alienated it to 
Samuel Thornhill
 Esquire, who upon his Decease, gave it to his second Son Sir 
Iohn Thornhill,
 from whom by descendant Right, it is now come over to his Son and Heir 
Charles Thornhill
 Esquire.


Newburgh
 is partly situated in 
Rodmersham,
 and partly in 
Lingsted,
 and anciently had the Estimate of a Mannor, and gave Name to a Family that was represented to the World, under that Notion, as appears, by very old Deeds without Date, in the Hands of Mr. 
Bartholomew May,
 too tedious here to recite. In the twenty fourth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Isabell,
 Wife of 
Henry de Apulderfield,
 held it at her Death, and in the Copy of the Inquisition Roll, it is called 
Manerium de Newburgh:
 but in Ages of a more modern Complexion, it fell from its former Reputation, and by Disuse shrunk into Neglect and Contempt, and is now only eminent, in that it was involved in that Estate, that by 
Elizabeth
 Coheir of Sir 
William Apulderfield
 devolved to Sir 
John Phineux,
 who finding his Sepulcher in Female Coheirs, 
Jane
 one of them, brought it over to her Husband 
John Roper
 Esquire, and from him by pa∣ternal Efflux, is the Title now wafted along, to the right honorable 
Christopher Roper,
 Baron of 
Tenham,
 removed by no wide Distance from this place.


St. Johns
 is the last Mannor in 
Rodmersham,
 to be taken Notice of; though the First in its Degree of Eminence because it was a principal place belonging to the Knights Hospitallers. An Order that was established and instituted by 
Gerardus,
 but fenced in, and empaled with New Orders and Rules, by 
Raimundus a Podio,
 lest, debauched and softned by secular Interest, in Decursion of Time, they might have sallied out into some Disorder and Excesse. At their first Installment, they were to be eighteen years of Age, at least, and none who were without the Verge of that Time, were capable of this Order: they were to be neither of Jewish nor Turkish Extraction, lest they might seem tacitly to wrap up those principles in their Blood, which by their Vow, they were engaged to destroy. Their Pedigree or Genealogie, was to be wholly Christian, and that of no coorse, but of a more refined Temperament; for their Birth or Parentage was to be noble, and that not to be sullied with the impure Tincture of Bastardy. Yet even this Restriction had a gentler sense quilted into it, for if they were the Natural Sons of Princes, their Birth was enobled, and the Rigor of the Rule, was by so eminent a Descent softned and allayed, and they made capable of this Order. Then they were by a general Obligation, to defend the Sepulchre of 
Christ,
 to protect Pilgrims, against the Eruptions of Infidels, in their visits made to the 
Holy Land,
 to foment no Clandestine Animosities, by engaging in private Duells amongst them∣selves, which were blasted with the Black Character of Illegality; and if the Princes of Christedome were entangled in intestine Dissentions amongst themselves, they were to shroud themselves, under an impartial Neutrality, lest they might destroy

that Christianity, which by Oath they were obliged to assert, if they should embark in any impious Sidings, or partial Combinations. Lastly, they were abstracted by their Vow of Poverty, Chastity and Obedience, from all secular Employments, or Negotiations, lest the Fumes of Temporal Interest might cloud their Eyes, in their prospect towards the Sepulchre; in order to which, they were not to exercise any Mercantile Affairs, or the Designs of Usury; they were, if possible, to receive the Sacrament thrice every year, and if not interrupted to hear Masse once a day. I have now done with the Ingredients which made up their Vow, I shall now come to the form of their Installment.


As for the Method of their Investiture, it was cast into this Mould. They had a Sword delivered to them, intimating they should fight with Magnanimity; and this was guarded with a Crosse Hilt, to declare that they were in all Encounters to vindicate and maintain the Crosse and Sepulchre of our Saviour. Then they were struck thrice over the Shoulders with that Sword they were invested with, to insinuate, that they should sustain all Contumelies and Indignities, for the Cause and Defence of Christian Religion. Then fourthly, this Sword was wiped, to instruct them that their Lives were to be assoiled from the Spot of all open and scandalous Impieties. Fifthly, they had guilt Spurs placed upon their Heels, to shew first, that all temporal Im∣provement of Wealth, was to be cast behind the Designs of Piety and Religion; or secondly, to demonstrate, that Riches were but the Glosse, or Parjet, but Ho∣nor and Vertue, was the Solid Body, designed by the Spur it self, that was to support and sustain it. Sixthly, they had a lighted Taper put into their Hands, by that, to discover, that by an eminent Integritie and exemplar Piety, like the Irradiation of that Luminary, they were to make themselves conspicuous to those who were involved in the Mists and Umbrages of a dark and gloomy Infidelity. Lastly, after these Formalities performed, they were obliged to repair to Masse, where I leave them.


Their Customary Habit was a black Cloak, being the best Ensigne, or Symptome of a solemne external Sorrow, and on this was a 
Crosse potent between four Crosses Patee,
 designing the five wounds of our Saviour; they wore constantly when they appeared in publique, a red Belt, intimating they were at all times ready to bleed, in Defence of the Crosse and Sepulcher, and on that was fixed a white Crosse, to manifest the Purity and Innocence of that Cause and Religion which was con∣tended for.


This Order was first brought into 
England,
 in the year of 
Grace
 1100, by 
Jordan de Briset,
 in some old Deeds written 
Brinset,
 Lord of 
Well-hall
 at 
Eltham
 in 
Kent,
 and 
Muriell
 his Wife, who founded a House for them at 
Clerkenwell,
 and dedicated it to St. 
John,
 which afterwards became the Head of their 
Alberge
 here in 
England,
 to which this Mannor continued united, as parcell of their Demeasne, untill the Dissolution in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, like a general Deluge, swept it away, and transported it into the Revenue of the Crown, and that Prince by Royal Con∣cession, made it the Estate of 
William Pordage
 Esquire, in whose Descendant, 
Thomas Pordage
 Esquire, the present Inheritance of it remains at this instant placed.


Rochester
 is a City which in elder Times, was as eminent for its Antiquity, as it was for its Strength and Grandeur; and had not those violent Impressions, which the rough hand of War formerly defaced it with, demolished its Bulke, and discomposed its Beau∣ty, it peradventure might have been registred at this day in the Inventory of the prin∣cipal Cities of this Nation. It was governed by a Port Reve, until King 
Edw.
 the fourth, in the second year of his Reign, raised it into a higher Dignity, and decreed by his royal Grant, that it should thenceforth be governed by a Maior and twelve Aldermen, and to this Monarch does this City owe much of its present Felicity, a Prince certainly he was, full of Complacence and Benignity, of a munificent Mind, and an obliging accostable Nature, guilty onely of some humane Frailties, common to all, and adorned with many signal Virtues, scarce resident in any one, who did not voluntarily sail into that Sea of Blood, which was let loose in the Civil War, commenced between Him, and the Partisans of the House of 
Lancaster,
 but rather was driven into it, by the Tempest of his ill Fortune.




Having represented the City in its Modern Face or Aspect, I shall now draw the Curtain something wider, and discover its Pourtracture in its calamitous Sufferings, occasioned by the Invasions, not only of an entaged Enemy, but likewise, which is worse, by the Onsets of its own incensed Prince; and these two mixing together have much disordered the Ancient Glory and Splendor of it.


In the year 680. 
Eldred
 King of 
Mercia
 harrassed 
Kent,
 and by an impetuous In∣road laid it wast. And as particular Lamentations are not distinguishable in universal Groans; so in this publick Depopulation of the County (then Kingdome,) the Tra∣gedy and Devastation acted by that Prince, at that Time, upon this City, was not resented with that Regret, as so deplorable Ruine might seem to exact, which had it been singly poured out upon this City, it could not have been repeated or re∣hearsed without a bleeding Heart, and a weeping Eye.


In the year 986. King 
Etheldred
 infested 
Rochester
 with a Siege, having entertain∣ed some discontent or disgust against the Bishop, and would not dissolve his Leaguer, until the said Bishop had expiated his Offence with the Sacrifice of an hundred pounds, a Sum of importance in those dry Times, though inconsiderable in these profuser ones of ours, where commonly the pecuniary Supply, that is extracted from the Subject, is steeped in his Tears.


In the year 999. the 
Danes
 invaded 
Canterbury,
 and though by the vigorous Re∣sistance and Magnanimity of the Defendants, their Assaults were made null, yet at length by the treacherous Combination of an insidious Party within, it was ra∣ther betrayed then subdued, and miserably depopulated by the Barbarous Adver∣sary, the Signatures of which Devastation are yet visible: and though the wideness of the Orifice, which that wound had made, be something closed up with the Hand of Time, yet there is a huge Scar left, to represent to Posterity the Greatness of the former Ruine. After they had thus harrassed and defaced that City, they (to improve 
heir Victory) advanced to 
Rochester,
 where the Inhabitants astonished with an Example of so much Terror, after some faint Opposition against the 
Danish
 Im∣pressions and Onsets, gave themselves up to Flight, and this City to a Calamitous Depopulation.


In the year 1130. 
Henry
 the first, with the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 were pre∣sent at the Consecration of St. 
Andrews
 Church in 
Rochester,
 which was then brought to perfection, having been before much empaired by the Iron Teeth of Time: But then the Fury of the Elements began to enter into a Corrivalship or Competition with the Fury of Enemies; for by a casual Eruption of an Accidental Fire, the whole City almost found an infortunate Sepulchre in its own Ashes: But it seems like a Phaenix, it rose again into new Beauty and Order out of these Ashes and Embers, but did not long continue in this Condition; for in the year of Grace 1177. which was in the Time of 
Henry
 the second, it was again assaulted by the Outrage and Fu∣ry of this implacable Element, the Impressions and remaining Signatures of which Conflagration, are obvious to the Inspection of an Inquisitive Eye, even until this Day.


In the year 1225. it was by the Indulgent Bounty of King 
Henry
 the third, in∣vested with a Wall, and that this Fortification might be of more Concernment, it was likewise secured or fenced with a Ditch.


In the year 1251. A Solemn Tornament was held at 
Rochester,
 wherein the 
English
 entered the Lists against those Strangers or Forrainers, (who having in that Age a great Concernment in the Eare of 
Henry
 the third, had likewise a strong In∣terest in his Heart, and by consequence a powerful Impression or Influence upon the publick Affairs of those Times) wherein they managed the Honor of this Nation, with so much Courage and Gallantry, that they forced them with Shame and Con∣fusion to retire into the City, and as if that were not a Shelter of sufficient Impor∣tance, to seek for their Security in the Castle.






The Castle.


THat there was in the Age before the 
Norman
 Invasion, the Rudiments, or, if I may so say, the 
Embrio
 of a Castle represented to the World under imperfect Lineaments or Dimensions, here at 
Rochester,
 is most certain; For the Records of the Cathedral inform us, that 
Egbert
 King of 
Kent,
 in the year 763. gave cer∣tain Lands to 
Eardulfe,
 Bishop of 
Rochester,
 situate within the Wals of the Castle of that City, which argues that there was some Trench or Fortification, even in those Times, which was in Strength by the Analogy of Proportion equivalent to the Fortresses of that Age, and so might merit by Resemblance the Name of a Castle, though the Bulk and Grandeur of it was added in Times of a more Modern extraction: For in the Time of the Conquest, I find that the Bishop of 
Rochester
 received Land at 
Alresford
 for Land at 
Rochester
 proportionate to it to erect a Castle on, which was in all probability, onely to enlarge the Boundaries of the old one, which peradventure was thought too contemptible in those active Times, to secure so important a Pass, as this of 
Rochester,
 was, without the Additional Supply of some new Strength. And that these Augmentations did acknowledge, if not for their Founder or Author, yet at least for their eminent Benefactor, 
Odo
 Bishop of 
Bajeux,
 and Earl of 
Kent,
 half Brother to the Conqueror, is without Controversie; a man who was afterwards dignified and adorned with the Office of Lord Chief Justice of 
England,
 a place of the most eminent Trust in that Age, and which was often managed by the Kings of 
England
 personally themselves, and from the Marble Seat in 
Westminster-hall,
 did deliver their Decisions and Determinations of Law, from whence in Ancient Seals and other Sculptures, they are often represented to us sitting in Judicature upon this Marble Seat, and hence result those Customary Ex∣pressions in Original Writs, and other Processes, 
Coram Nobis,
 and, 
Teste Rege,
 and sometimes, 
me Ipso apud Westmon.
 and some other Phrases and Tearms in our Ancient Law-books of the same Complexion, as namely such a one, 
Allocutus est Nobis sedentibus supra Sedem Marmoream:
 which justifies that the Kings of 
England
 did sometimes personally sit and assist in Judicature, in that Court we now call the Upper Bench, where like a great Orb or Glob of Light, they dispersed their Beams of Mercy and Justice into all the parts of our 
English Horizon,
 and dispelled all those Crievances, which, like so many Fogs or Clouds exhaled from corrupred Nature, seemed to eclipse the Serenity of this Nation. But I wander too much; I now return. This Accumulation of Offices and Dignities, could not so ingage this above∣mentioned 
Odo,
 to the Interest of 
William Rufus
 his Nephew; but that he first en∣wrapped himself in a Combination with some of the discontented Nobility, whose Endeavors were to ravish the Scepter out of the Hand of that Prince, and place it in the hand of 
Robert
 Duke of 
Normandy,
 his eldest Brother, and afterwards to fortifie this De∣sign, started out into an open Defection and seised upon this Castle of 
Rochester:
 but 
William Rufus
 with so much Expedition and Courage crushed these Attempts, that they became abortive: for in the year 1088. he besieges his Uncle 
Odo
 in this Fortress, and presses upon him with so much Vigor and Animosity, that he forces him to surrender to discretion, but though he took not away his Life, he did that of his Liberty, and sent him Prisoner to 
Tunbridge-castle,
 not under the Notion of Bishop of 
Bajeux;
 for that would have infringed and invaded the Franchises of the Church, but under that of the Earl of 
Kent.


After this there was by the mediation and umpirage of 
Robert Fitz Hamon,
 and 
Henry
 Earl of 
Warwick,
 a Composition made between 
William Rufus
 and 
Gundulphus
 Bishop of 
Rochester,
 the Result of which was this: The Prince was to confirm the Mannor of 
Hedenham
 to this Sea, and the Bishop, to ballance this Concession with something which had the Face of Retribution, was to expend sixty pound, in some additions to the Castle, and accordingly erected the great square Tower, a Mor∣sel which hath been too hard for the Teeth of Time, and by the vastness of the in∣stant remaining Skeleton, witnesses the strength of it to Posterity, when it was in

its primitive Grandeur, before the Rage of War, and the Fury of Elements threw it into this wild Disorder and Confusion; yet it is even in this shattered Condition, a better Alphabet to the Memory of the Bishop its first Founder, then his own Mo∣nument or Repository, for that lies entered in forgotten and neglected Ruines, but this still preserves his Name, and is called 
Gundulphus's
 Tower.


And being thus improved and fortified, with these new Accessions, it is not to be wondered at, that this Piece, was of that signal Estimate, in elder Times, that King 
Henry
 the first, by the Advice of his Councel, in the year 1126, granted the Custody of this Castle, and the Office of Castellan, annexed to it, to 
William
 the then present Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and his Successors, with free liberty to erect a Tower, that is another Fortresse, equivalent or Correspondent to 
Gundulphs
 Tower, which before was erected for the Defence of this City and Castle.


In Times succeeding to these, that is, in the year 1215, 
William de Albineto
 or 
Al∣biniaco,
 in the Latine of those Times, and written 
D' Albinet,
 in the Usage of ours, was Governour of this Fortresse, for the factious party of the mutinous Barons, who were then in actual Arms against King 
John,
 but this Prince invested it with a formal Leaguer, and after the bloody Debate of a three Moneths Siege, forces the above-mentioned 
D' Albinet
 to a Surrender, wherein though the Virtue of the Op∣ponent, was considerable, yet it was ruinous to him, and the Event hath left us Faith enough to believe, that Strength without the Concurrence of a Loyal Prin∣ciple which may support it, is like an 
Egyptian
 Reed, which ordinarily runs into the Fingers, and wounds them which lean upon it.


In the year after this, the Nobility, then combined and in Arms against King 
John,
 finding that their Forces were much empaired and diminished by severall un∣succesful Encounters with that Prince, and that they must be forced to resign them∣selves up to those rigorous Conditions that he would impose upon them, called in 
Lewis
 the 
Dolphin
 of 
France,
 who landing in the Isle of 
Thanett,
 with a considerable Army, advanced to 
Rochester,
 and by the concurrent Assistance of the Barons, who had united their strength with his, made such a furious Onset upon this Castle, that like a Tempest which bears down all before it, he carried it by Assault.


In the year 1264. broke out that fatal Contest between 
Simon Montfort
 Earl of 
Leicester,
 and 
Henry
 the third, the Foundation or Original of which was this. That Earl being the great Assertor of the 
English
 Liberty against the turbulent Eruptions of Forrainers, endeavoured to tear away those Strangers, that being placed too near the Royal Throne, had obstructed and forelaid all the Avenues and Passages both to the Heart and Eare of that Prince: and this dismal clashing (like the Collision of two Flints) was productive of so wasting and destructive a Fire, that it had like, not only to have consumed the Crown and Scepter, but likewise to have cast the whole Kingdome it self into a heap of Flame and Ruines, some Sparks of which were dart∣ed hither. For this Earl about the Time above specified begirt the City and Castle of 
Rochester,
 with a powerful Army, and that he might multiply all Advantages to himself, which might inforce his Design, and intercept the Succour intended the Besieged, he burned the Bridge, whose Frame was then made up of Wood, and destroyed a Fortress that was placed upon it, which was compounded of the same Materials, and having effected this, he pressed so hard upon the Castle, that he not only pillaged the adjacent Church and Abby, but likewise subdued the outward Ward or Gate, and had certainly by an absolute Conquest at chieved the whole, had not King 
Henry
 arrived most opportunely, and by a succesful encounter wrested both Earl 
Warren,
 who had so vigorously maintained it, and that likewise, from the Im∣pressions of his Fury.


After this, I find little of Moment to have been acted at this place, only I find the Castle to have been deposited in the Hands of several eminent Persons, who were extracted from Families, whose Blood was of as noble a Tincture as any in this County, and these held it under the Notion of 
Castellani
 or Guardians of it, an Office of a very important Concernment in elder Times. The first of which, who was entrusted with it, was 
William St. Clere,
 whose Ancient Seat, before his Suc∣cessor by the Match of the Coheir of 
Aldham
 removed to 
Ightam,
 was at 
Woodland
 in 
Kingsdown,
 and he died in the Tenure of this place, in the forty eighth year of

Henry
 the third. After him, I discover 
Robert de Hougham
 Lord of 
Hougham
 by 
Dover,
 to have had the Custody of it, and he died invested in this Office, in the second year of 
Edward
 the first, and in the next year after 
Robert de Septuans,
 from whom the 
Harfleets
 of 
East-Kent
 are descended, had the Care and Command of it. In Times of a nearer Approach to us, I find 
William Keriel
 or 
Criol,
 was entrusted with the Care and Government of it, and was possest of this Charge at his Death, in the first year of 
Henry
 the fifth. After whose 
Exit,
 the Custody was committed to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cobham,
 and he held it at his Decease, which was in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the fourth. But after this, it began so to languish away into its own Ruines, that it grew rather an Object of Pity, than of Envy, and rested amongst the Mannors of the Crown, untill King 
James,
 in the seventh year of his Reign, granted that goodly Skeleton of the Castle, which yet courts the Eye of the Beholder, to an Admiration of its former Strength, with all the Services annexed to it, to Sir 
Anthony Weldon,
 of 
Swanscamp,
 whose Son and Heir 
Ralph Weldon
 of 
Swanscamp
 Esquire, is the instant Lord of the Fee.


There is much Land in this County held of this Castle, whose Tenure is perfect Castleguard: for upon the Day prefixed for the discharge of the quitt-Rent, relating to it, there is a Banner displaid and hung out (anciently it was over the Castle-Wall) and all those who are Tenants to this Mannor, and are in Default by their non-Appearance, and do not discharge their Customary Duties, and Services, the Penaltie imposed up∣on their Neglect, is, that the Return of every Tide of the adjacent River which finds them Absent, doubles their Service or quitt-Rent.


The 
Bridge
 which is almost contiguous to the Root or Basis, was anciently, when the Frame was of Timber, removed to a farther Distance, and crossed the Stream, over against the Hospital of St 
Maries,
 at 
Stroude.
 But this was by 
Simon de Montfort
 when he besieged 
Rochester,
 ruined by Fire, and although it was re-edified and repai∣red not long after, yet some twenty years subsequent to this Misfortune, it was swept away by Ice, so that it appears the Elements entered into a Corrivalship or Compe∣tition, which should make the most ruinous Impression, on this infortunate Structure.


But after this, that is, in the raign of 
Richard
 the second, all those above-men∣tioned Dysasters and Inconveniences, which might again have assaulted the 
Bridge,
 were for the future prevented; for Sir 
Robert Knolles,
 a Person who had improved, and enhaunsed his Fame, to the highest Degree of Eminence, by his glorious and succes∣full Managery of the English Affairs, and Interest in 
France,
 seeking to make him∣self as usefull to his Friends, that is, his Contrymen, as he was before considerable to his Enemies, mastered the Course of the River, and somewhat nearer to the Castle as in a place more fit, both for the Soliditie, and fastnesse of the Soile, as likewise for the breaking of the impetuousnesse of the Current, erected the Bridge of Stone which is now visible, fixed, and established on one and twenty Arches, and by this Victory over the Elements, made his Triumphs more illustrious, than he had done before, by all the Conquests of his Adversaries: for in these he only seemed to have out-gone all others, but in this, to have outdone himself.


Being thus fixed and Strengthned, there was a Statute enacted in the one and twen∣tieth year of 
Richard
 the second, wherein there is Provision made for its future Securi∣ty, there being several parcells of Land, which are mentioned in that Act, tied and obliged for its continual Maintenance and Repair, whensoever the Injuries of Time, or those of the Elements, should deface or impair it.






The Chappel or Chantry in old Records, styled the Chantry of 
Rochester
 Bridge, was founded in the year 1399, by 
Iohn de Cobham,
 and was dedicated to the holy Trinity, and was called at the first Institution, 
All Souls
 Chappel, because Prayers and other Orizons, were there to be offered up, for the Redemption and Health of all Christian Souls, and likewise a Stipend or Exhibition was there setled, for the Support and Maintenance of three Priests, or Chaplains, particularly, to pray for the Souls of 
John de Cobham
 the Patron and Founder, Sir 
Robert Knolles,
 to whom the Bridge owed its primitive Establishment, 
William Wangford
 and 
Eleanor
 his Wife, 
Iohn Fre∣mingham
 and 
Alice
 his Wife, 
William Makenade,
 and Sir 
William Rickhil;
 and likewise for the Souls of some who were deceased before the Foundation of this Chappel, as

namely for the Soul of 
Iohn Buckingham,
 formerly Bishop of 
Lincoln,
 and Sir 
William Wall worth,
 the eminent Lord Maior of 
London,
 to whose Virtue and Valour, 
London,
 owes the Addition of the Dagger, which was annexed as an Augmentation to the Arms of the City.


The Priory was founded by 
Ethelbert
 King of 
Kent,
 and dedicated to the Honor of St. 
Andrew,
 and stored with Monks who were to live under the Rule of St. 
Benedict,
 though afterwards, as Mr. 
Lambert
 out of the Book of 
Rochester
 observes, they altered their Rule, and conformed themselves to the Canon of St. 
Augustine
 Bishop of 
Hippo,
 but were reduced again to the primitive Institution of St. 
Benedict,
 in the year 1080, by 
Gundulphus
 then Bishop of 
Rochester,
 in which Design, he was aided and supported by 
Lanfranc
 the active Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury.
 In Ages of an elder Inscription, there were several Contests brake forth between the Monks of 
Christ-church
 in 
Canterbury,
 and those of this Covent; the first Strugling, to bring the Election of the Bishop of 
Rochester
 into their Chapiter, which the last, Sticking close to their own inherent Rights and Priviledges, endevoured to disannul, and wholly to circum∣scribe his Election within the Precincts of their own Chapiter. Two Presidents, which represent to Posterity the whole State of this Controversie, do occur in Record. The first appears in the year 1227, when after the Death of 
Benedict,
 the Bishop of 
Rochester,
 elected to succeed him, 
Henry Sandford,
 a Man of exemplary Piety, so that he was inculpable for his Life, and of unfathomed Learning, so that he was in that Age, almost unparallelled for his Knowledge, which could not stave off the Monks of 
Christ-church,
 to justle the Election, pretending that the pastoral Staffe or Crosier of 
Rochester, de Jure,
 ought to have been brought to their House, after the Decease of the Bishop, and that the Election was to have been made in their Chapiter. This occasioned much Heat, for the Monks of 
Rochester,
 vigorously asserted their own Choice, so that it was referred to the Decision of the Arch∣bishop, and he again put it over to the Umpirage of Delegates, who hearing the parties concerned, and poising the Allegations, produced by either side to sustain the Justice of their own Cause; they by a finall Determination, declared the Right to reside in the Monks of 
Rochester.
 But it seems this Fire, was only allayed, not extinguished: for in the year 1238, it brake forth again, and the occasion which gave Fuell to it, was this. The Monks of 
Rochester,
 had elected 
Richard Wendover
 for their Bishop, which so exasperated and disgusted the Monks of 
Christ-church,
 that suspecting their own Power, they, more to inforce and mul∣tiply their Strength, and evacuate that Election, entituled Arch-bishop 
Edmund
 to their Cause. But the Monks of 
Rochester
 disclaiming, by a tame Remissenesse, either to foment or palliate their own undoing, appealed to 
Rome,
 where af∣ter the chargeable Commencement of a three years Sute, the Innocency and Justice of their Cause was recompensed with the Triumph of the Day, upon which they returned home exalted with the Joy of their Successe, and enacted in their Chapiter, that the annuall Feast of St. 
Cuthbert,
 on which Day they archie∣ved this signal Conquest, should be doubly solemnized, both in their Church and in their Kitchin. But as they were successefull in their rancounters with the Arch-bishop, so they were very infortunate in that intestine Discord, which burst out between them, and their own Bishop 
Gilbert Glanville;
 who not only forcibly wrung from them their Goods, Ornaments, Writings, and other Muniments, but likewise devested them of a considerable Portion of their Lands, Possessions, and Priviledges, which forced them to appeal to 
Rome
 for Redresse; where they em∣broiled themselves in a tedious Law-Sute, which engaged them to that vast ex∣pence, that they were constrained to coin the Silver of 
Paulinus
 Shrine into Money, to support them in so expensive and costly a Contest; and this much embased for the fu∣ture that Esteem which the World formerly had entertained both of the Piety and Sanctitie of the Monks of this Cloister.


But these Contests did not so much prejudice or endamage this Cloister within, though accompanied with much Heat, as the Devastation occasioned by the Ele∣ment of Fire without: for in the year 1130. when 
Henry
 the first, with a great Convention of the Nobility and Bishops was then present to solemnize the Conse∣cration of St. 
Andrews
 Cathedral and Church, which was then newly finished, a

suddain Flame broke out, whose Assaults upon this Covent, did much deface and empare the Glory of the Ancient Fabrick. And as if this impetuous Eruption had not been enough to diminish the Beauty of it, there was another Fire in the year 1177. which was about the latter end of 
Henry
 the second, which exercised its Fury upon it, even to a total Depopulation of this Cloister; yet after all these Disasters, wherein it is disputable, whether the Rage of men, or that of the Elements, were more destructive, by the Charitable Beneficence and Piety of that Age, it arose like a Phaenix, more Beautiful and vigorous, even out of its Embers and Ashes, and continued in that condition, until the general Dissolution, in the reign of 
Hen∣ry
 the eighth, and then that Prince having suppressed this Covent, and torn off their Revenue, upon their Ruines he established a Dean and twelve Prebends, and endowed them for their future support with that Demeasne, which for the princi∣pal part of it, as namely, 
Wouldham, Halling, Snodland, Trottescliff, Denton, Longfeild, Borestal, Lidsing,
 and 
Stoke,
 in the Hundred of 
Hoo,
 had been formerly annexed to the above-mentioned Cloister.


The Cathedral, with the Bishoprick of 
Rochester,
 united to it, were founded and established by that pious Monarch 
Ethelbert
 King of 
Kent,
 and the first Bishop to whom was entrusted the Pastoral Staffe or Crosier by 
Augustine,
 the Apostle of the 
Saxons,
 was 
Justus,
 the above-mentioned Prince, not only assenting unto this Election by his Presence, but likewise contributing to the Support of the Person so chosen, and his Successors by his liberal Beneficence. And indeed it is remarka∣ble, that in all those Revolutions and Vicissitudes, which have rolled and varied the Fate of things and Affairs, since the Seeds of Christianity were sown so plenti∣fully by the Hand of 
Augustine
 in this Island, that the Chair of this Bishoprick was still fixed at 
Rochester,
 whereas many others have in sundry parts of the Nation suffered divers Translations to other places then that where they at first were esta∣blished; and the Reason is, because by the Order of 
William
 the Conqueror, such Bishops as were before resident in Towns and Villages, were forthwith to transplant their Seat into walled Cities and places of Defence, the more to oblige the popu∣lacie, not only to repair thither for the Exercise of Devotion, but likewise to augment the Commerce and Bulk of those Cities, by such numerous Assemblies; but in this Command of his, 
Rochester
 could not be interressed or concerned, that was invested with a Wall, or something equivalent to it long before the Age of the Conqueror. I should now unfold a Catalogue of those Bishops that swayed the Cro∣sier of this Sea, beginning with 
Justus,
 and concluding with 
John Warner
 the in∣stant Bishop of this Diocess; but this is so obvious, both in 
Goodwin,
 and a late Manual, styled 
The Help to History,
 that I shall only historically Record the most eminent of them, and proceed. The first of whom I find to be 
Justus,
 who was translated from this Sea, to that of 
Canterbury,
 a Man whose Integrity of Life breathed out a noble perfume when he was living, and his Body, if we may credit the Fabulous and Superstitious Legend of that Age, no less grateful an Odour when he was Dead, for 'tis reported that his Reliques being to be removed after their En∣terment many years before, cast forth (not the Stench or Steam of Putrefaction) but a Sent so odorous and fragrant, that it did not annoy, but exceedingly delight the Nosthrils of those who were present; but indeed this might be possible without the Concurrence of a Miracle, if we consider that those Remains of his might be rescued from the Fate of Corruption, by the Adjuncts or Circumstances of Nard, Balm, Spicery, and Perfume; so that the Miracle seems to be imposed by the Monks on the Laity of that Age, only to excite both their Devotion and Benevo∣lence.


Paulinus,
 who was the third Bishop, who succeeded him, converted 
Edwin
 King of 
Northumberland,
 and 
Edelburga
 his Queen, to Christianity, and so justly meri∣ted the Title of Apostle of that Province, for which he was recorded after his Death in the Register of Saints, and had his Body so far ennobled, that it was wrapt up in a silver Shrine.


Ithamar,
 who next succeeded him, had his Reliques likewise enshrined in after Times by 
Gandulphus
 Bishop of 
Rochester,
 which was not only repaired, but very much adorned and beautified by Bishop 
John
 his Successor, because (as the Book of

Rochester
 intimates, he was redeemed, by touching his Reliques, 
ab acerrimo Oculo∣rum Dolore,
 from some sharp Distillation which did afflict his Eye.


Arnostus
 was present at 
Pinenden-heath,
 at the great Debate touching some Lands, which were unjustly ravished away from the Church.


Gundulphus
 his Successor erected the white Tower in 
Rochester-castle:
 and where∣as he at his first Instalment, found but six Canons in the Covent of St. 
Andrews,
 he so liberally endowed it, that he left it replenished with threescore Monks of the Order and Rule of St. 
Benedict.


Tobias,
 whom I should have mentioned after 
Ithamar,
 was (as 
Harp feild
 out of the 
Records
 of 
Rochester
) a man very dextrous and skilful in the Tongues, and a gene∣ral Magazine of all other Learning both Divine and Humane beside.


Walter de Merton,
 Lord Chancellor of 
England,
 did not only found the Colledge of 
Merton
 at 
Oxford,
 but likewise laid the Foundation of an imperfect Colledge at 
Maldon
 in 
Essex,
 which by his Death was left unfinished. He died in the year 1277. and lies buried in his own Church at 
Rochester,
 to which in his Life Time he had been a Munificent Benefactor. In Gratitude to whose Memory Sir 
Henry Savil,
 and the Fellows of 
Merton
 Colledge, erected a Magnificent Monument, in the year 1599. over his Ashes, which though it be much empaired both by Age, and the in∣jurious Affronts of these impious Times; yet shall the Name of this great man be the best Steward to his own Dust: and when his Sepulchre it self shall lie enterred in its own deplored Rubbish, this shall stand unto it self an everlasting Tomb and Epitaph.


Hamon de Heath
 was Confessor to 
Edward
 the second, and a liberal Benefactor to this Church; He built the House at the Mannor of 
Halling,
 which in some Ancient Records is styled his Pallace.


Joannes de Scapeia,
 or 
John de Shepey
 was Lord Treasurer of 
England
 three years.


Richard Young
 was a principal Contributor to the Reparation of the Church at 
Frendsbury,
 and wholly glazed the Windows: where not long since his pourtracture was exposed to the publick View; a good Index, not only to his Memory, but like∣wise to the Remembrance of so pious a Work.


John Lowe
 was born in the County of 
Worcester,
 and was a man in the Estimate of 
Bale,
 who writ his Life, not only of signal Piety, but likewise an Exchequer of all manner of Learning.


John Fisher
 was a man of vast Knowledge, which yet was Ruinous to him for as∣serting the Papal Supremacy, when it was invested in 
Henry
 the eight, by an Act of Parliament; he offered up his Life on a Scaffold, as a Sacrifice to that opinion.


Nicolas Ridley
 was a man of an inculpable Life, and of a wide Knowledge, who was so an irrefragable Assertor of the Protestant Religion, that he gave himself up at 
Oxford,
 to the Fury of Fire and Faggot for the Testimony of what he before had professed: and hath by his exemplary Life and Death, taught the Adversaries of Episcopacy this Lesson, that it is possible that the Seed may be pure as well as the Soyl; that is, the persons of the Men, as well as the Office, may be incorrupt.


John Warner
 is the last, who brings up this Catalogue, in whom the instant Title of this Bishoprick is resident, a man worthy of better Dayes, yet fit for these; who for his vast Encouragement of Learning in the best of Times, and his pious Support of it in the worst, cannot be mentioned without an Attribute.


There have in elder Times many Contests and Animosities broke out between the Bishops of 
Rochester
 and 
Worcester;
 and the Fuel which fomented and supplied this Fire of Contention, was, that both these Prelates pretended to the Support of the Crosier before the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury
 in all Processions, and other Acts of publick and signal Solemnity; but in Fine, the Crosier or Pastoral Staff was fixed or setled in the Hand of the Prelate of 
Rochester,
 and hath been by Prescription ever since united as a convicted and Inherent Priviledge to this Diocesse.


Before I wave my Discourse concerning this Bishoprick, I must inform the Read∣er, that there are some peculiars which are annexed to the Deanries of 
Croydon
 and 
Shorham,
 and this hath entangled and engaged many in much Difficulty to trace out the last Wils and Testaments of those who deceased within the Confines and Pre∣cincts

of these peculiars. To unravel therefore these Niceties for the future; I shall represent a just Scale of these excepted places, out of the original Records of the Church of 
Rochester
 themselves, that those which can find no satisfaction in the Registers of 
Canterbury,
 or Records of 
Rochester,
 may yet discover what they are in pursuit of, in that Office, wherein these are enrolled and filed. But before I unwind their Catalogue, I shall in brief wrap up what in former Times hath been delivered touching the Office of Rural Deans, by 
Duarenus
 and others, who have more co∣piously dilated themselves upon this Subject. This Officer was certainly brought into the Church to supply the place of those whom Antiquity styled the 
Chore-Episcopi,
 who were commonly Assistants to the Bishop: For indeed where the Diocesse was of that vast Latitude and Extent, that the Managery of so great a Trust was dispro∣portionate to the Discharge of one single Person, it was necessary that his Care should be supported by the mutual Counsel and concurrent Advice of others, whose prudence might improve the Affairs of the Church: and upon the going out of the above-mentioned Office, as being obsolete and antiquated, this of the Rural Dean came in. And to him did the Bishop entrust an Inspection into the Lives of the Clergy, and from him did receive an exact Account of Scandal in its whole Lati∣tude, and other vitious Excesses, which might by an impious Connivance have ad∣ded more blackness to the Cassock: He was likewise, by Delegation from the Bishop, to take Cognisance of all Errors and Deviations from that which in that Age was re∣puted Orthodox Doctrine, that neither the Foundation nor Superstructure of Reli∣gion might be assaulted. And lastly, where the Diocesse was wide, and of a large Territory, it frequently hapned that the Probate and Administration of sundry Te∣staments in divers places, was committed to his Care and Sway; and he was like∣wise entrusted with a Seal, with the Name of the Bishop, whose Office by Depu∣tation he was to discharge, and not his own, insculped upon it: which upon his Decease, or relinquishing this Office, was to be surrendered up into the Hands of the Bishop of the Diocesse for the Time being, that he might dispose of it as he should judge convenient. Thus much of the Rurall Dean: the Peculiars of which I before promised a Catalogue, are as follow:

Having done with the Church, I shall now descend to those Mannors which lie circumscribed within the Precincts and Verge of this City. The first is 
Borestall,
 which, as 
Textus Roffensis
 denotes and signifies unto us, was given to the Church and Monks of St. 
Andrews,
 by 
Kenulfus
 King of 
Mercia,
 and was, as the Records of that Church testifie, 
de Cibo eorum,
 to support their Table with a constant supply of Diet, and rested annexed to their Demeasne, until the Fatality of the General Dissolution ravished it away, and afterwards it was by 
Henry
 the eighth, when he established a Dean and Chapiter upon the Ruines of this above-mentioned Priory, linked unto that Revenue, which he granted them for their future subsistence.


The second is 
Great Delce,
 which had owners of that Sirname, as is evident by 
Testa de Nevill,
 and other Records both of a publick and private Stamp; but, it appears, was not of any permanent continuance in this Name: for before the middle of 
Edward
 the first, it was gon from that, and united to the Inheritance of 
Has∣pall.

Geffrey de Haspall,
 enjoyed it at his Death under the Notion of the fourth part of a Knights Fee, as appears by an Inquisition, taken in the fifteenth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 25. The next Family in Succession after this, which was entitu∣led to the Possession (as is evident by the original Deeds, now in the Hands of 
Lea
) was 
Molineux,
 derived from those of 
Sefton
 in 
Lancashire,
 but he remained so incon∣siderable a Space in the Inheritance, that like 
Cato
 in the 
Theater,
 he only stept into it, that he might go out again; for about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the third, as appears by the testimony of an ancient Court-roll, 
Benedict de Fulsham,
 was invested in the Patrimony of it in the thirtieth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 20. And from him, did it streame down in the Channel of successive Interest, to his Des∣cendant 
Richard Fulsham,
 who likewise was in the Enjoyment of it at his Decease, which was in the fifth year of 
Henry
 the fifth, 
Rot Esc. Num.
 17. But after his 
Exit,
 I find no farther mention of any of this Family, to have been possest of this place; for, in the ninth year of 
Henry
 the fifth, 
Reginald Love,
 died seised of it, and transmitted it to his Successor, who held it untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then the Revolution of Purchase, brought it to be the Demeasne of 
William Venour,
 and it was found to be his Possession at his Death, which was in the first year of 
Edward
 the fourth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 24. But after his Depar∣ture, the Title was very unsetled and inconstant; for within the Circle of some Moneths after, it was by Sale from this Name, rolled into the Tenure of 
Markham
 descended from the ancient Stem of the 
Markhams,
 of 
Nottingham-shire,
 where after a very transitory aboad, it was by the same Fatality, carried into the Pos∣session of 
Tate;
 who about the first year of 
Edward
 the fourth, passed it away to Sir 
Richard Lea,
 Lord Maior of 
London,
 descended from an ancient Family of that Name, in the County of 
Worcester,
 and his Son was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the nineteenth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, and held his Shrievalty at his new acqui∣red Mannor of 
Much Delce,
 and from him by an even thread of Descent, has the Title and Propriety been conducted down to 
Richard Lea
 Esquire, who is the instant Proprietary of it.


Horsted
 borrows its Name from 
Horsa,
 Brother to 
Hengist
 the Founder of the 
Sax∣on Kingdome
 here in 
Kent,
 who fell by the Sword of the Britons at 
Alresford,
 as an expiatory Sacrifice, to ballance the Losse of 
Cartigerne,
 Brother to 
Vortimer,
 General of the Confederate British Forces, who was offered up in that signal Encounter, as an 
Holocaust
 to the Saxon Fury; and there is something, which even at this Day, lies wrapt up in the Name, that induces us to believe, that 
Horsa
 after his slaugh∣ter, recieved the Rites of his Funeral at this place; and in our Grandfathers Me∣mory, there were the scattered Remains of diverse huge Massie Stones, which Storms and other Impressions of Time, have now altogether demolished: and these certainly were, in elder Times, composed into the Figure of a Monument, to shroud the Ashes of this 
Horsa;
 as those at 
Cits Cothouse,
 above 
Alresford,
 were framed in∣to the same Proportionate Mould, to secure the Dust, or at least to point out to Posterity the Memory of 
Cartigern.


The Mannor it self, was enwraped in the Patrimony of the noble and ancient Fa∣mily of 
Apulderfield. William de Apulderfield,
 obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at 
Horsted,
 in the thirty eighth year of 
Henry
 the eighth. In Times of a lower Descent, I discover it in the Possession of 
Warren;
 for 
John,
 Son of 
Edmund Warren,
 held it at his Death, which was in the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the third. After 
Warren
 had quitted the Inheritance, I find the 
Fulshams
 by Purchase to be en∣tituled to the Fee-simple of it; and 
Benedict de Fulsham,
 enjoyed in at his Decease, which was in the thirtieth year of 
Edward
 the third, and paid relief for this and 
Much Delce,
 under the Notion of the fourth part of a Knights Fee, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of the above-said Prince. After this Family was worn out, it had successively the same Possessors with 
Much Delce,
 so that it came with that Mannor by Purchase from 
Tate,
 to Sir 
Richard Lea
 Knight; and from him is the Title by successive Descent, transported to 
Rtchard Lea
 Esquire, the present Possessor.


Snodherst
 is another Mannor which lies partly spread into 
Chetham,
 and partly into the Limits of 
Rochester,
 was, as high as I can trace any Record, a Branch of that

Demeasn, which fell under the Dominion of 
Badelesmer,
 and though 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badēlesmer,
 had by his perfidious Disloyalty, forfeited it in the Reign of 
Edward
 the second; yet was it in the second year of 
Edward
 the third, restored to his Son 
Bartholomew Badelesmer,
 who in the twelfth year of that Prince, dyed without Issue, and left it to his Brother 
Giles Badelesmer,
 who likewise deceasing without Issue; Sir 
John Tiptoft,
 in Right of 
Margery
 his Wife, one of his Sisters and Coheirs, entered upon the Inheritance of it: but, before the twentieth of 
Edward
 the third, had alienated it to 
Benedict de Fulsham,
 for he in that year, as appears by the Book of 
Aid,
 paid respective relief for it, at the making the Black Prince Knight, After 
Fulshams
 were extinguished at this place, it had the Fate to own the Jurisdiction and Interest of those, who were the Successive Proprietaries of 
Much Delce,
 so that it is now knit to the present Inheritance of 
Richard Lea
 Esquire.


Little Delce
 is the last Mannor which is circumscribed within the Precincts of this City. It was, in Ages of a very high Calculation, the Possession of the no∣ble, illustrious, and ancient Family of 
Sherington,
 written in old Deeds, Pipe∣rolls, and other Evidences, 
Serington,
 and sometimes 
Scherington,
 but most fre∣quently 
Sherington:
 whose original and principal Seat, was at 
Sherington-hall
 at 
Cranworth
 in 
Norfolk,
 though they had other Mannors, which bore their Name, which anciently were folded up in their Demeasne, as namely 
Sherington
 in the County of 
Buckingham, Sherington
 in 
Sussex, Sherington
 in the County of 
Here∣ford,
 and 
Sherington
 in 
Lancashire,
 yet, as I take it, in their Possession. But to proceed, 
Odo de Serington,
 or 
Sherington,
 for the Names are 
Synonyma
 or coinci∣dent, held this Mannor in the thirty first year of 
Henry
 the first, and was enter∣red in the Cathedral of 
Rochester;
 and when 
Robert Glover Somerset Herald,
 col∣lected his 
Miscellany
 of Church-notes, in the Reign of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 there were some Reliques of his Monument, offered up to the Survey of a curious and Inquisitive Eye, which now the Sacrilegious Barbarity of impious Mechanicks, and the injurious Hand of Time together, have wholly dismantled. After 
She∣rington
 was worn out, I find a Family, called 
Pugeis,
 invested in the Inhe∣ritance, and there is mention in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the first, in 
Kirkbies Inquest
 (a Book kept in the Exchequet,) of one 
Richard Pugeis
 who then held it: but before the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, this Family had deserted the Pos∣session, and transmitted his Concernment in it by Sale to 
Richard Charles,
 and he enjoyed it at his Decease, which was in the fifth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num
 92. And so did 
Nicholas Charles
 his Successor, in the eleventh year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 16. And 
Robert
 was his Son and Heir, who dying without Issue, it was united to the Demeasne of 
Richard Ormes∣kirk,
 in right of 
Joan,
 Sister and Heir of the above-mentioned 
Robert;
 and he in the third year of 
Henry
 the fourth, alienated it to 
Henry Perey,
 Earl of 
Northum∣berland;
 and he not long after, passed it away to 
Rickhull,
 in which Family it rested, untill the seventeenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was by Deed conveyed from 
William Rickhull
 Esquire, to 
Thomas Glover,
 and 
Henry Hunt,
 who had then the Custody or Guardianship of 
Rochester-Bridge,
 and to the successive Wardens of it, towards the Preservation and Reparation of its Fabrick for ever; so that at this instant, it is parcel of that Revenue, which rescues this noble Structure from Decay and Ruin.


Nashenden
 next offers it self up to our Remembrance. In the raign of 
Edward
 the second, I find it entituled to the Possession of a Family called 
Aspall,
 and in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
John Aspall,
 paid respective Aid, at making the Black Prince Knight. But before the latter end of 
Richard
 the se∣cond, this Family, had surrendred the Inheritance of this place to 
Peckham:
 the last of which Name, which held it, was 
John Peckham,
 who (as the Records of 
Rochester-Bridge
 informs me) in the raign of 
Henry
 the sixth, made it part of that Demeasn by Sale, which was to support, with its Income, the Fabrick of 
Ro∣chester
 Bridge, in whose Revenue, you may at this instant, still find it re∣sident.




Rolvenden
 gives Name to the Hundred wherein it is placed, and is resolved into several places of eminent Consideration, which do not only call for a Survey, but even exact it: The first is 
Halden,
 called in Records the Mannor of 
Lambin, alias Halden,
 and the Reason of this Denomination is, because it assumed the first part of this Name from 
Lambinus de Langham,
 who held it under the Distribution of a whole Knights Fee (as the Book called 
Testa de Nevill
 demonstrates) in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third, at the Marriage of 
Isabell
 that Prince's Sister, at which Time he accounted so for it: After this Family was departed from the possession of this place, which was about the beginning of 
Edward
 the third, the 
Haldens
 were by purchase setled in the Possession, and 
William de Halden
 Son of 
John de Halden,
 died seised of it, in the fiftieth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 45. and left it to his Son 
John Halden,
 but he expiring, about the beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth, in 
Joan
 his Daughter and Heir, she by matching with 
John Guldeford
 Esquire, made it parcel of his Patrimony, and from him it devolved by Descent to Sir 
Richard Guldeford,
 who was Knighted at 
Milford-haven
 by 
H.
 the seventh, and was afterwards one of the Privy Counsel to that Prince. In the eighth year of his reign, he with Courage and Prudence opposed 
James
 Lord 
Audley,
 and his 
Cornish
 Squadrons, in that Erup∣tion which they made upon this County, and in the Battle waged near 
Deptford∣bridge,
 between King 
Henry
 the seventh, and those Rebels, represented such signal Testimonies of personal Magnanimity, that he was by that Prince made a Banne∣ret at 
Black-heath.
 His Son 
Henry Guldeford
 Esquire, in the first year of 
Henry
 the eighth, went into 
Spain,
 and engaged himself under 
Ferdinand
 and 
Isabella,
 King and Queen of 
Castile
 and 
Aragon,
 in their Wars commenced against the 
Moores,
 and demeaned himself with that Fidelity and exemplary Resolution in all Conflicts entertained with those barbarous Infidels, that upon the Reduction of the Province of 
Granada,
 the above-mentioned Prince, for his signal Service performed in his and the Christian Quarrel, added to his Paternal Coat as an Augmentation, 
A Pomgranet slipped upon a Canton,
 being the Arms of that regained Province, and like∣wise dignified him with the Order of Knighthood. In the fourth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, he was again invested with the abovesaid Order by that Prince, and in the fifth of his reign, he commanded one of the Royal Navy called the Regent, in which Ship he acted Things worth the future Remembrance in that Sea-fight, which was waged between the 
English
 and 
French
 near 
Brittain,
 and in the same year (as appears by the Original Patent bearing Date the twenty eighth of 
May
) he was made Standard-bearer of 
England,
 and carried it at the Siege of 
Terwin:
 His Son Sir 
Ed∣ward Guldeford,
 in the fifteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, received the Order of Knight∣hood, for his Service at 
Tourney,
 and was Captain of the Horse under the Duke of 
Suffolk,
 at the second Siege of 
Terwin,
 which was in the fifteenth year of that Prince, and not long after reduced 
Boghan-castle,
 taking the Advantage of the Win∣ter, which had sealed up the Marshes, which environed it, and made it almost in∣accessible in a Frost. In fine, this worthy Souldier and Patriot dying without Issue∣male, left this Mannor of 
Halden
 to be enjoyed by 
Jane
 his Sole Inheritrix, matched to 
John Dudley
 Duke of 
Northumberland,
 and he having unhappily engaged himself in that ruinous Design, which was to devest Queen 
Mary
 of the Royal Diadem, and place it on the Head of the Lady 
Jane Grey,
 wedded to his Son 
Guilford Dudley,
 was in the first year of that Queen, for that insolent Attempt, which proved un∣successful, attainted and beheaded, his Estate here being confiscated to the Crown, the Mannor was given by that Princess to Sir 
John Baker,
 her Attorney General, Ancestor to Sir 
John Baker
 Knight and Baronet, who at this Instant enjoyes the Mannor, but the Demeasne of it was granted to Sir 
Henry Sidney,
 whose Grand∣child 
Robert
 Earl of 
Leicester,
 not many years since conveyed it to Sir 
Thomas Smith
 of 
London,
 whose Grand-child 
Robert Smith
 Esquire, lately died possest of it.


There are twelve 
Denns
 which hold of this Mannor of 
Lambin, aliàs Halden,
 and at the Court-day elect twelve Officers, called 
Beadles,
 to collect the Quit-rents, which relate to it: The Names of them here ensue, 
Midsell
 in 
Rolvenden, Stal∣lenden
 in 
Rolvenden, Ramsden
 in 
Benenden, West Bishoppenden
 in 
Benenden, Folkinden
 in 
Benenden
 and 
Sandherst, Holnherst
 in 
Benenden, Elderherst
 in 
Halden
 and 
Tenterden,

Ilehinden
 in 
Woodchurch, Mensden
 in 
Tenterden, Strenchden
 in 
Tenterden, Smeeth
 in 
Stone
 in the Isle of 
Oxney, Blackbrooks
 and 
Pisenden
 in 
Witresham.


Casingham
 is a second place of Estimate. In Ages of a very high Ascent, I find it had Owners of the same Sirname; for, 
in Testa de Nevill,
 I find that 
William de Ca∣singham
 held the Mannor of 
Casingham,
 now corruptly called 
Keinsham,
 with 
Or∣lovingden,
 another inconsiderable Mannor annexed unto it, in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third, and paid respective 
Aid
 for it accordingly, under the Notion of the fourth part of a Knights Fee, at the Marriage of 
Isabell
 that Prince's Sister. In Times which were immediatly subsequent to the departure of this Family from this place, that is, in the Government of 
Henry
 the fourth, I find by an Ancient Court-roll, the 
Moores
 to have been possest of it, and kept it in their Inheritance, until the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was conveyed to 
Gibbons
 of 
Rolven∣den;
 from which Family, about the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 as appears by the Court-rols, now in the Hands of my Learned Friend Mr. 
Kilbourn,
 it went away to 
Hay
 or 
Hays
 of 
Sussex,
 and in this Name it remained until that Time which bordered upon our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was alienated to 
Everden
 or 
Everinden,
 descended from the 
Everindens
 of 
Everinden-house
 in 
Biddenden,
 where they are recorded by the private Deeds of that place, to have been resident many Hundred years, until in the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 it was passed away by Sale to 
John Mils,
 Ancestor to the present Proprietary. But to proceed, the Continu∣ance of this Family at this place, was but brief and transitory; for not many years since, it went away by Sale from this Name to 
Muns,
 where the Inheritance still continues.


Fresingham
 sometimes written 
Fersingham,
 and vulgarly called 
Frensham,
 is the last place of Account in 
Rolvenden.
 It had in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third, as appears by 
Testa de Nevill,
 a Family of that Name which was its Possessor; for 
John de Fresingham
 or 
Fersingham
 held it then, and paid for it after the Rate of the fourth part of a Knights Fee, at the Marriage of 
Isabell
 that Prince's Sister. And in this Family did it remain until the latter part of 
Edward
 the third, and then the Vicissitude of Purchase brought it to be the Demeasne of 
Norwood,
 and in this Name was it resident, until the reign of 
Edward
 the fourth, and then, as appears by the old Rols of this Mannor, it was conveyed to 
Guldeford,
 and Sir 
Henry Guldeford,
 up∣on his Decease, gave it to his second Son Sir 
George Guldeford,
 from whom it de∣scended to his Grand-child Sir 
Edward Guldford,
 who about the beginning of King 
James
 passed it away to Mr. 
Fowle,
 who bequeathed it to his second Son Mr. ...... 
Fowle,
 who sold it to Sir 
Edward Hales
 Knight and Baronet, Grand-father to Sir 
Edward Hales,
 who possesses the instant Signory and Fee-simple of it.


Hole
 in this Parish was a Seat which had Owners of that Sirname, for in the year 1340. 
Henry at Hole
 demises this place-by Deed to his two Sisters 
Honor
 and 
Alice;
 but for many Descents last past,

 it hath been the Patrimony of 
Gibbons,
 who held Land in this Parish in the year 1326. and was the Seminary or Original Seed-plot, whence all of that Name and Family in 
Kent
 primitively sprouted forth, and though Sir 
William Segar
 did assigne to Mr. 
Gibbons
 of 
Westcliff, A Lion Rampant between three Escollops,
 and to this Family, 
A Lion Rampant between three Ogrises,
 as their Coat-Armor, yet in ancient coloured Glasse at 
Hole
 now the Inheritance of Colonel 
Robert Gibbons,
 the paternal Coat of this Family is represented to have been, 
Or, A Lion Rampant Sables charged with an Escarbuncle Pomettee and Flourette of the first,
 which I mention that this Family now of 
Hole
 might receive no prejudice by his Mistake or inadvertency.


Fersham
 in this Parish, was (as appears by some dateless Deeds) the Patrimony of Sir 
John de Fersham. Stephen de Fersham,
 this mans Successor, in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the third, found a man at Arms for Guard of the Sea Coasts, which im∣plies he was of eminence in those Times: In Times of a latter Date; that is, in the reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, I find it possest by 
Guldeford,
 and remained with the Revenue of that Family until the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was passed away to 
Dike
 of 
Sussex,
 whose Descendants by their Trustees and Commissio∣ners, not many years since conveyed their joynt-Interest in it to Mr. 
Thomas Brom∣feild
 of 
London
 Merchant.




Old Romney
 in the Hundred of 
Langport,
 is eminent for two or three places which lie within the Confines of it, which are both of Spiritual and Secular Concern∣ment. The first is 
Agne-court
 and 
Orgarswike,
 not distant by any considerable Difference of space from this Town, and which was once a Parish entirely in it self, until, it is probable, the unhealthful Situation made the Inhabitants vary their Station and dislodge: which were both given by 
Offa
 King of the 
Mercians,
 in the year seven hundred eighty and one, to the Prior and Monks of 
Christ-church, ad Pascua Porcorum,
 say the Records of that Covent, that is, for the feeding or grazing of their Hoggs. And it is possible that the Foundation of this Grant was the profuse Effusion, not only of Christian, but of Innocent Blood, which had been so pro∣digally wasted, to be subservient and ministerial to the ambitious Interests and Passi∣ons of the above-mentioned Prince, and though peradventure he had endeavored to wash off those Crimson Stains which stuck upon his Hands, besmeared with the Blood of 
Ethelbert
 King of the 
East-Angles,
 and others, with penitential Pears; yet he deemed that an insufficient Expiation to assoil himself from his contracted Guilt, unlesse he made his Compunction more visible and conspicuous, by a Mu∣nificent Manifestation both of his Piety and Charity together.


Bere
 or 
Berry-court
 in 
Old Romney
 (for it carried the first Appellation in very Old Evidences) is a Mannot which hath contracted a Reputation from those large Quit∣rents and other Services which appertain unto it, rather then from the Dimension and extent of its Revenue, which is but narrow and circumscribed; 
Nicholas de Bere
 held it, in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third, as appears by an old Court-roll, which hath an Aspect upon that Time. He was Son of 
Richard de Bere,
 who was one of the 
Recognitores Magnae Assisae
 (an Office of a wide circumference of Trust in that Age) in the second year of King 
John,
 in the great Controversie which was started between 
Richard de Garwinton,
 and 
Theobald de Twitham,
 concerning Land at 
Ilding
 in 
Kingston.
 In the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, I find that 
Robert Forneaux, Robert Atwood,
 and 
Thomas Tutwise
 had some Interest in 
Berry-court,
 and paid respective 
Aide
 for it, as the Book of 
Aide
 informs me, at making the Black Prince Knight: But before the beginning of 
Richard
 the second, I find the Title wholly concentered in 
Belknap;
 for Sir 
Robert Belknap
 the Judge, did not only hold it in the first year, but likewise in the tenth of that Prince: at what Time being attainted and banished, by the Malevolent Concurrence of some ambitious Lords, whose Influence like a Confederacy of Malignant Aspects in the Stars, combined to Ruine him, this by Escheat was invested in the Crown, and was by Royal Con∣cession (as appears by the Original Patent) conveyed in the thirteenth of 
Richard
 the third; to 
John Brockman.
 In Times of a lower step, that is, in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, I find it in the Possession of 
John Newland:
 but whether by Purchase from 
Brockman
 or not, for want of Intelligence, I cannot discover. And in this Family the Propriety continued, until the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was conveyed to Sir 
George Perkins,
 from whom almost in our Memory the same Mutation brought it to confess the instant possession of Mr. ...... 
Aldridge
 of 
Tilers
 near 
Reding.


Rucking
 in the Hundred of 
Hamme,
 in Ancient Records written 
Roking,
 was, by the Piety and Charitable Munificence of King 
Offa,
 in the year seven hundred eighty and one, given to the Prior and Monks of 
Christ-church,
 and was in the Original Donation granted 
ad Pascua Porcorum,
 for the Pasture of their Hoggs, and it con∣tinued clasped up in their Revenue, until the Tempest of the general Dissolution arose and overtook it; for, there being a Surrender of the Revenue of this Covent, into the Hands of 
Henry
 the eighth, in the thirty third year of his reign, he united it to the Dean and Chapiter of 
Christ-church,
 which he shortly after established and moulded out of their Ruines, and here it continued until a late Storm arose again, and tore it off.


Barbedinden
 is another eminent Mannor within the Boundaries of this Parish, which had in Ages of a more Ancient Inscription Proprietaries of the same Deno∣mination; 
William de Barbodinden
 held it at his Death, which was in the ninth of

Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 3. And left it to his Son and Heir 
John de Bar∣bodinden,
 who in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, as appears by the Book of 
Aid,
 paid an Auxiliary supply for it at making the Black Prince Knight. After this Family was extinguished, 
Robert Belknap
 the Judge succeeded in the Possession of it: and I do not find, that, though the Crown upon his Attaint, seised upon much of his Estate, that ever his Interest here was ravished away from him; for he was in Posses∣sion of this place at his Death, which was in the second year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and disposed it by Will, to his Son 
John Belknap,
 who about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, alienates it to 
Engham:
 amongst whose Demeasne, the Propriety of this Mannor had not many years dwelt, but the Title was by Sale supplanted, and cast into the Possession of Sir 
Matthew Brown
 Knight, and his Son 
Thomas Brown
 Esquire, in the last year of 
Edward
 the sixth; passed it away by Sale to 
Anthony Lovelace
 Esquire, Ancestor to 
Richard Lovelace,
 who some few years since, alienated his entire Concern∣ment in it, to the late Possessor Mr. 
Richard Hulse,
 descended from the ancient Family of 
Hulse,
 of the 
Borough
 of 
Hulse,
 lying within 
Namptwich,
 in the County of 
Chester.








S. S. S. S.


SAltwood
 in the Hundred of 
Hene,
 hath an open Prospect into the Ocean, which flowed up much nearer, then now it doth, and imparted its Nature to its Name: for in Latin it is written 
de Bosco Salso.
 The Arch-bishops of 
Canterbury,
 had here formerly a magnificent Castle, which Time hath much dismantled; and a Park well stored with Deere, now vanished and gon. Many Mannors in this Track, are held of it by Knights Service, which justly made it to be counted and called an Honour. It was granted to the Church, in the year 1096, by one 
Halden,
 who for Grandeur and opulency, was reckoned one of the Princes of 
England.
 The Value and extent of it, are more particularly set forth, in the Records of the Church of 
Canterbury,
 in the Conquerour's Time, and they speak thus: 
In Limwarlaed in Hundred. de Hede, habet Hugo de Montfort de Terra Mouachorum
 I 
Manerium Saltwode de Archi∣episcopo, & Comes Godwinus tenuit illud, & tunc se defendebat pro
 VII 
Sullings
 (That was 
Godwin
 Earl of 
Kent,
 who by a possessory right, held many Towns along this Coast) 
& nunc sunt
 V. 
& tamen non Scottent, nisi pro
 III. 
Et in Burgo de Hede sunt
 CC. 
&
 XXV. 
Burgenses, qui pertinent huic Manerio, de quibus non habet Hugo nisi
 III. 
Forisfacta
 (for it lies in the Franchise of the five Ports, and the King was to have their Serice 
& est appretiatum
 XXVIII. 
lb.
 
&
 IIII. This was 
Hugh Mont∣fort,
 who was one of those powerfull Men, which entered 
England
 with 
William
 the Conquerour.


In the Time of K. 
Henry
 the second, 
Henry de Essex,
 Baron of 
Ralegh
 in that Coun∣ty, Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports 
(pro Tempore)
 and the King's Standard-bearer in right of Inheritance held this Castle of the Arch-bishop, who having in a leight Skirmish against the 
Welsh
 in 
Flintshire,
 not only cast away his Courage, but his Standard also; was appealed of high Treason, and in a legal Duell or Combate, vanquished by his Challenger, and being possest with regret and shame, contracted from this Defeat, shrouded himself in a Cloister, and put on a Monks Cowle for∣feiting a goodly Patrimony and Lively-hood, which escheated to King 
Henry
 the second. But 
Thomas Beckett
 acquainting the King, that this Mannor belonged to his Church and Sea; that Prince being beyond the Seas, directed a Writt to K. 
Henry
 his Son (the Draught of which is represented to us by 
Matthew Paris,
 whither I referre the Reader) for Restitution: But in regard of new emergent Contests, between King 
Henry
 the second, and that insolent Prelate, it was not re∣stored unto the Church untill the Time of 
Richard
 the second.


The Castle was magnificently inlarged and repaired by 
William Courtney,
 Arch∣bishop of 
Canterbury,
 in the Time of 
Richard
 the second, as his Will doth de∣clare,

and his Arms in Stone-work eminently demonstrate, and remained, after his Decease, annexed to the Archiepiscopal Revenue, untill 
Thomas Cranmer
 in the twen∣ty ninth of 
Henry
 the eighth, exchanged it with that Prince. And his Son King 
Edward
 the sixth, in the fourth year of his Raign, granted it to 
Edward
 Lor
 
Clinton,
 who not long after conveyed it to Mr. 
Henry Herdson,
 whose Grand∣child Mr. 
Francis Herdson,
 passed it away, about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 to 
Robert Cranmer
 Esquire, by whose Daughter and Heir, 
Ann Cranmer,
 it devol∣ved to Sir 
Arthur Harris
 of 
Crixey
 in 
Essex,
 whose Son Sir 
Cranmer Harris,
 not ma∣ny years since, alienated it to Sir 
William Boteler,
 Father to Sir 
Oliver Boteler
 Baronet, the instant Lord of the Fee.


There is an old vast Mansion House of Stone, at 
Brochull
 in this Parish, on the side of a Steep Hill, which was the Seat and ancient Residence of a Family as eminent for Antiquity, as any in this Track, and extracted their Sirname from hence, and were called 
Brochull,
 who flourished here in Knights Degree, and in some Parliaments in the Time of 
Edw.
 the third, and 
Edw.
 the fourth, sate there as Knights of the Shire. 
Margaret
 the Wife of 
William,
 builded, or caused to be built, an Isle on the Northside the Parish Church. You may rove at the Time by the rudenesse of the Words, which are here transcribed out of the East Window, where they stand engrossed, in an antiquated Character: 
Margareta La Famma Gillam de Brockhilla fio Fera sata Shapella.


From hence branched forth the 
Brockhills,
 or 
Brockhulls
 (for anciently they were written so, both ways) both of 
Cale-hill,
 and 
Aldington Septuans
 in 
Thurnham:
 But the Male Line fayling here in 
Thomas Brockhull, Elizabeth
 his Sole Daughter and Heir, brought it to be possest by 
Richard Selling,
 in which Family, after the Interest of it, stay∣ed untill allmost our Fathers Remembrance, it was by the same Devolution, carried off to acknowledge the Propriety of 
Tournay.


Sandhurst
 in the Hundred of 
Selbrittenden,
 was, with much other Land granted by King 
Offa,
 in the year 791, to 
Christ-church
 in 
Canterbury.
 But 
Betherinden
 was always of temporal Interest; for it afforded both Seat and Sirname, to a Fa∣mily of this Denomination, and 
John de Bethrinden,
 dyed seised of it, in the year of 
Edward
 the third: But not long, after, did it reside in this Family; for this Name expired in a Female Inheritrix, who was matched to 
Finch,
 who united this Seat to his Demeasne; and here it lay untill the Beginning of Queen 
Eli∣zabeth,
 and then it was rent off by Sale, and placed in 
Pelham;
 and from this Name a Mutation of the same Circumstance, took it away; and, in our Fathers Remembrance annexed it to the Inheritance of 
Fowl,
 and remains still with the Des∣cendants of that Family.


Aldrinden
 is a third place of Account in 
Sandhurst,
 had Owners of that Sirname: of whom 
Roger de Aldrinden,
 as the private Deeds of this place do inform me, was the last in the Male descent, who left it to his Daughter and Heir 
Christian Aldrin∣den;
 and she in the twenty second year of 
Edward
 the third, passed it away to 
John Sellbrittenden;
 who not long after, alienated it to 
Thomas Bourne,
 and he held it as appears by an old Court-roll, in the first year of 
Richard
 the second; and from him did it by the Chain of Descent, passe along, untill it arrived at 
John Bourn,
 who dying in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, settled it by Will, on 
Joan
 his Female Inheritrix, matched to 
Thomas Allard,
 and by this Alliance, did it descend to his Son 
Henry Allard,
 who had Issue 
John Allard;
 who alienated his Right in it by Sale, to 
John Twisden
 Gentleman, in the thirtieth year of 
Henry
 the eighth; from whom it came down to his Successor Mr. 
William Twisden;
 who about the Beginning of King 
James,
 sold it to Mr. 
Thomas Downton
 Esquire, Father of Mr. 
Richard Downton
 of 
Istleworth
 Esquire, Justice of the Peace for the County of 
Middlesex,
 now Proprietary of it.


Combden
 is another Mannor in this Parish, which was anciently possest by 
Fulk de Ballard;
 that 
Fulk,
 who, as appears by the Book called 
Testa de Nevill,
 in the Ex∣chequer, paid a respective supply for Land in 
Sandhurst,
 at the marriage of 
Isabell
 Sister to King 
Henry
 the third, in the twentieth year of that Prince: but not long did the Propriety of this place, rest in this Family; for in the reign of 
Richard
 the

second, I find it in the Possession of the 
Whitfields,
 an ancient Family, descended from 
Whitfield
 in 
Cumberland,
 of which Stock was Sir 
Ithan de Whitfield,
 who in behalf of the Barons, then knit together in an hostile confederacy against their Prince, (as an old 
French
 Manuscript informs me) 
tue Borough-bridge
 15. 
Edwardi secundi, il est oit contre le Roy,
 defended 
Borough-bridge
 against 
Edward
 the second. And ever since the Government of that Prince above-mentioned, was this place constantly fastned by the Thread of many Descents to the Patrimony, though not of this Fa∣mily, yet of this Name, until Sir 
Ralph Whitfield
 deceasing not many years since, bequeathed it by Will to his Daughter Mrs. 
Dorothy Whitfield,
 who hath now brought it by Marriage to be the possession of 
John Fotherly
 Esquire.


Here is a place in this Parish, which, however it be now under a cloudy and ob∣scure Character, was in Ages of a higher Gradation, the Inheritance of the Noble Family of 
Twisden:
 and certainly here they lived, when they writ, 
de Denna Fracta,
 and from them it hath borrowed the Title of 
Twisden-street
 or 
Borough,
 which it re∣tains to this Day. Indeed 
Twisden
 in the Original 
Saxon,
 imports no more but the broken Valley, or the Vale distinguished into two peeces,


Shadockherst
 in the Hundreds of 
Blackborn, Chart, Longbridge
 and 
Ham,
 was the Inheritance of a Family called 
Forstall,
 and sometimes written 
at Forstall,
 which were of no contemptible Extraction in this County; for in several Ancient Deeds, I find 
John at Forstall,
 and 
Richard at Forstall
 to be Witnesses, and it is probable they were Possessors of this Mannor, though the private Deeds reach out to our View, no higher discovery then the reign of 
Henry
 the fifth; for in the third year of that Prince's reign, 
Joan Forstall
 passes it away by Deed to 
Stokys,
 vulgarly called 
Stokes,
 and in that Family was the Interest of it many years clasped up, until at last the or∣dinary Vicissitude of Purchase brought it to be the Demeasne of 
Randolph,
 who had an Estate likewise about 
Burham
 near 
Maidstone.
 And from this Name, about the beginning of King 
Edward
 the sixth, it went away by Sale to Sir 
John Taylor,
 who in the twenty fifth of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 passed it away to 
John Taylor
 Esquire, Ancestor to 
Thomas Taylor
 Esquire, who is now invested in the Possession of it, and from whom I confesse I have received my Intelligence concerning those who were the former Proprietaries of it.


Criols-court
 in this Parish was one of those Seats which related to the Patrimony of 
Bertram de Crioll,
 and he died seised of it, in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first, and left it to his Son 
John de Crioll,
 who deceasing about the beginning of 
Ed∣ward
 the third without Issue, it devolved to 
Joan
 his Sister and Heir, who was matched to Sir 
Richard de Rokesley:
 but he likewise determined in 
Agnes Rokesley,
 who was one of his two Female Co-heirs, and she by matching with 
Thomas de Poynings
 entituled that Family to the possession of that wide Estate, which devol∣ved to her in Right of her Mother, and from him did it descend to his Successor Sir 
Edward Poynings,
 Son of 
Robert Poynings,
 a man very eminent in the Government of 
Henry
 the seventh. For this Sir 
Edward,
 in the first year of his Rule, immedi∣atly after he had triumphed over 
Richard
 the third in 
Bosworth-field,
 was chosen one of his Privy Councel to manage the publick Interest of the Nation: Afterwards he most vigorusly opposed 
James
 Lord 
Audley,
 and his 
Cornish
 Squadrons being then in Defection to 
Henry
 the seventh, in the tenth year of his reign. And this Sir 
Edward
 held it at his Death, which was in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, though his Office was not found until the fourteenth of that Prince, and then it being discove∣red that the whole Stock and Lineage of this Family were extinguished, and that there were none who were legally begotten (for Sir 
Thomas Poynings
 was his natural Son) that either in a direct or collateral Line, could pretend a Title to his Estate, it escheated to the Crown. And 
Henry
 the eighth afterwards passed it away by Grant to 
William Taylor,
 whose Sutcessor Mr. 
Thomas Taylor
 passed it away to 
George Taylor,
 and he had Issue Mr. 
John Taylor,
 who concluding in 
Anne
 his Sole Daugh∣ter and Heir, she by a Match with 
Whitfeild,
 annexed it to the Demeasne of that Name, from whom again, not many years since, it came over by Sale to 
More,
 who very lately hath alienated it to Mr. 
Thomas Taylor
 Esquire.


Mincing-court,
 vnlgarly so called, but Originally, and in Old Records styled

Minikens-court,
 is likewife circumscribed within the Verge of 
Shadock herst.
 It was parcel of that Income which did support in elder Times the Hospital of St. 
Jacobs
 in 
Tanington
 by 
Canterbury,
 which was founded to be a Receptacle of Leprous Women, and confirmed by 
Hubert
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 about the begin∣ning of King 
John:
 and to this Covent did it relate, until the reign of King 
Edward
 the sixth, and then though it had not been torn off from the Revenue of the above∣said Hospital, by the violent Hand of 
Henry
 the eighth; yet it was alienated by that Prince, and in the second year of his Rule it was granted to 
Robert Tatteshall
 Esquire, to hold of his Mannor of 
East-Greenwich, tantum per Fidelitatem Servitii,
 and from him immediatly after it came over by purchase to Sir 
Edward Wotton.
 And when Cardinal 
Poole
 visited 
Kent,
 in the year 1557. he was found invested in it, and from him did it by paternal Delegation devolve to his Successor 
Thomas
 Lord 
Wotton,
 who setled it upon his eldest Daughter 
Katherine,
 upon her Marriage with 
Henry
 Lord 
Stanhop,
 Son and Heir to 
Philip
 Earl of 
Chesterfield,
 and this Lady not long since hath alienated her Interest in it to Mr. 
Thomas Harfleet
 of 
Canterbury.


Stalesfeild
 in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 was a Limb of that vast Revenue which fell under the Jurisdiction and Signory of the Knights Templers, and is registred under that Notion, in that Book kept in the Exchequer, styled 
Liber de Terris Tem∣plariorum.
 And in Mr. 
Robert Glovers
 Church-Notes of 
Kent,
 there is in this Church represented the Pourtracture of a Chevalier maled in Armour, whose Face is only visible, and that pourtracted with a long Beard, which induces me to believe, that it was the Effigies of some eminent Person of this Order; for in all the Sculpture and Imagery of the Knights Templers, both Ancient and Modern, they are still delivered to Posterity under that Representation. And 
Peter Auger
 falling under the Censure of a Knight Templer, in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the second, though 
Valett
 to that Prince, because he nourished a long and diffused Beard, was absolved and discharged by his Master, by satisfying the publick, that though he wore a long Beard, he was no Knight Templer. But to advance in my Survey; Af∣ter that fatal Tempest, which was conjured up by the Magick of the Court of 
Rome,
 and its Emissaries, had, in the second year of 
Edward
 the second, shook this Order into a total Dissolution, this Mannor which lay clasped up in their Revenue, was united by Royal Concession to the Demeasne of the Knights of St. 
John
 of 
Jerusa∣lem,
 and there it dwelt, untill the general suppression, in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, dislodged it, and threw it into the possession of the Crown, where it lay involved, until King 
Edward
 the sixth, in the fourth year of his Government, by Grant planted the Propriety in Sir 
Anthony St. Leger,
 and he immediatly after pas∣sed it away to Sir 
Anthony Aucher,
 who was afterwards slain bravely disputing the Interest of the 
English
 Nation at 
Calais,
 against the Assaults of the 
French:
 and his Successor, about the beginning of King 
James
 alienated it to 
Salter,
 from whom it is now come down to Sir 
Nicholas Salter,
 who is entituled to the instant Fee-simple of it.


Darbies-court
 in this Parish gave Seat and Sirname to a Family, which was known to the World by no other Denomination, and certainly was a Family of generous Account in this Track; for in very ancient Registers and Rols of 
Kentish
 Gentry; I find this Coat to be borne by this Name, 
videlicet, Partie per Cheveron embattelled, Or, and Azure, three Eagles counterchanged:
 And of this Family was 
John Darby
 Esquire, who was Sheriff of 
London,
 in the year 1445. and built the South-Isle of St. 
Dionis Back-church
 near 
Lime-street,
 where the Windows represent to our View the above-mentioned Coat, as the best Index to the Memory of so munificent a Benefactor: But to proceed; Before the beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth, the Pro∣priety of this Mansion was by Sale conveyed from 
Darby
 to 
St. Leger,
 where its aboad was of as brief a continuance; for the Male-line failing in 
Thomas St. Leger
 Esquire, who bought it, by 
Joan
 his Daughter and Co-heir wedded to 
Henry Au∣cher
 Esquire, it came over to be the Inheritance of that Family, and in their Re∣venue was constantly fixed, until the Age and Remembrance of our Grand-fathers, and then it was alienated to Sir 
Michael Sonds
 of 
Eastry,
 from whom by hereditary Right it devolved to Sir 
Richard Sonds
 of 
Throuley,
 who in his Life-time passed it

away to his Son and Heir Sir 
George Sonds,
 now of 
Leeze
-Court in 
Shelvich,
 Knight of the Bath, to whom the Possession of this Mannor at this instant is en∣tituled


Stamford
 in the Hundred of 
Folkstone,
 is in it self, a small obscure Village, but made eminent by containing within the Limits of it, 
Ostenhanger,
 a Seat of as much Account and Eminence, as any in the County. The Demeasne which rela∣ted to it, was divided between the two noble Families of 
Crioll
 and 
Auberville: Bertram de Crioll,
 was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the twenty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third, and is written in the Pipe-roll of that year, of 
Westenhanger,
 a Name co∣incident with the other. Sir 
William de Auberville
 lived at the Borough of 
Westen∣hanger,
 when he founded the Abby of 
West-Langdon,
 in the Time of 
Richard
 the first: he had 
Hugh de Auberville,
 who likewise (as appears by the 
Leiger
 Book of that Covent, being, a liberal Benefactor to that Cloister) was his Son and Heir, and he had Issue Sir 
William de Auberville,
 in whom the Male-Line determined, and he had only a Female Inheritrix, espoused to 
Nicholas de Crioll,
 whether of a. Younger House, or else a Younger Son to 
Bertram de Crioll
 above-mentioned, I cannot discover: 
Bertram de Crioll,
 had Issue 
Bertram de Crioll,
 who dyed possest of a great Proportion of 
Ostenhanger,
 in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first, as appears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 48. And left it to 
Joan
 his Daughter, married to Sir 
Richard de Rokesley,
 who upon the Decease of her only Brother 
John de Crioll,
 without Issue, became his Sole Heir. This Sir 
Richard de Rokesley,
 was one of those eminent 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, that accompanied King 
Edward
 the first into 
Scotland,
 and for his signal Service performed at the Siege of 
Carlaverock,
 was made a Banneret by that Prince:

 but he likewise expired in two Daughters and Coheirs; 
Agnes
 one of them, was wedded to 
Thomas de Poynings;
 and 
Joan
 the other, was matched to 
Walter de Pateshull.
 Upon the Partition of the Estate, 
Rokesley's
 Interest in 
Westen∣hanger
 wholly accrued to 
Poynings,
 and he had Issue 
Nicholas de Poynings,
 who was summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron, the thirty third year of 
Edward
 the third: 
Michael Poynings,
 who was likewise summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron, the forty second year of that Prince; and thirdly 
Lucas de Poynings,
 who in the year a∣bovesaid, was honored with the same summons. Upon the Devision of the Estate, 
Westenhanger
 was annexed to the Demeasne of 
Michaell de Poynings,
 and he had Issue 
Thomas de Poynings,
 who was summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron, in the sixth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, his Son and Heir was 
Robert Poynings,
 who in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, with 
Iohn Perry,
 were designed by Authority, to take the Sub∣scriptions of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who were summoned in, to renounce the Title of the House of 
York,
 which it seems was then in secret Agitation, to be set up against she House of 
Lanc
ster;
 and this 
Robert,
 was oftentimes summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron in the reign of that Prince. The last time I find him sum∣moned, was in the twenty third year of his Government, and his Son and Heir was 
Robert Poynings,
 who was likewise summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron in the reign of the above-mentioned Monarch, and deceased the eighth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, and left his Estate here to that worthy Person his Son and Heir Sir 
Edward Poynings,
 of whom more hereafter. I shall now discover, how that Division of 
Ostenhanger,
 which devolved to 
Nicholas de Crioll,
 by the Heir of 
Auberville,
 was passed away: 
Nicholas de Crioll,
 had Issue 
John de Crioll,
 who in the nineteenth year of 
Edward
 the third, obtained a Licence, to found a Chantry in the Chappel of St. 
Johns
 in 
Ostenhanger,
 and endow it with one Messuage, forty five Acres of Glebe, and six Acres of Pasture situated in 
Limn,
 as appears 
Prima Parte Pat. de Anno
 19. 
Edwardi tertii Memb.
 4. And before, in the seventeenth year of that Prince, was permitted by Grant from the Crown, to embattle, and make Loop-holes in his Mansion house at 
Ostenhanger,
 as is manifest, 
secunda Parte Pat. de Anno
 17. 
Edwardi tertii Memb.
 34. And he left it secured and invested, with these new ac∣quired Franchises, to his Son Sir 
Nicholas de Crioll,
 and he dyed seised of it in the third year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 40. And from him did it suc∣cessively devolve to Sir 
Thomas Keriell
 or 
Crioll,
 who was slain at the second Battle of St. 
Albans,
 in the thirty eighth of 
Henry
 the sixth, whilst he asserted

the Quarrel of the House of 
Yorke,
 and dying without Issue-male, 
Thomas Fogge
 Esquire, in his Wife's Right, who was one of his Daughters and Co-heirs, ente∣red upon his Estate here at 
Ostenhanger,
 and about the latter end of 
Edward
 the fourth, passed it away to his eldest Brother Sir 
John Fogge
 of 
Repton,
 who died possest of it, in the seventeenth year of 
Henry
 the seventh, and bequeathed it by Testament to his Son and Heir Sir 
John Fogge,
 who about the beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, de∣mised his Concernment here to Sir 
Edward Poynings;
 which 
Edward Poynings
 was one of the Privy Councel to 
Henry
 the seventh, and lived here, when he so vigo∣rously in the tenth year of that Prince, opposed the proceedings of 
James
 Lord 
Audley,
 who was afterwards defeated at 
Black-heath,
 and likewise was Lord De∣puty of 
Ireland,
 and Knight of the Garter, and by his Influence on that Nation, was that eminent Statute enacted, which ever since hath been adopted into his Fa∣mily, and called 
Poynings-Law.
 He was likewise at the Siege of 
Terwin,
 with 
Hen∣ry
 the eighth, and was there for his eminent Service created Knight Banneret, and Governour of that Town. He died in the twelfth year of King 
Henry
 the eighth, and was found after a serious Inquisition taken after his Death, in the fourteenth year of that Prince, to have neither any Issue lawfully begotten, nor any collate∣ral Alliance, that could by any remote Affinity eptitle themselves to his Estate, and so by Escheat it became invested in the Crown: but King 
Henry
 the eighth, out of his indulgent Bounty, by Royal Concession made it the Inheritance of his natural Son 
Thomas Poynings,
 who was a Person of excellent and elegant Composure, and eminent Merit, and was made Knight of the 
Bath,
 at the Coronation of Queen 
Anne,
 in the twenty fourth of that Prince's reign, and afterwards having represen∣ted to the World signal Demonstrations in a publick Joust or Tournament, of a re∣markable Strength and Courage, was in the thirty sixth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, called to sit in Parliament, as Baron 
Poynings
 of 
Ostenhanger:
 but in the thirty se∣venth of that Prince's reign, deceased without Issue, upon whose 
Exit
 this Man∣not reverts to the Crown, and there lay couched, until the first year of 
Edward
 the sixth, and then it was granted to 
John Dudley
 Earl of 
Warwick,
 afterwards Duke of 
Northumberland:
 upon whose Attainder, in the first year of Queen 
Mary,
 it be∣came again parcel of the Royal Patrimony; and afterwards Queen 
Elizabeth,
 about the beginning of her reign, passed it away by Grant to her Kinsman Sir 
Thomas Sack∣ville,
 and he not long after, alienated it by Sale to 
Thomas Smith
 Esquire, vulgar∣ly called 
Customer Smith,
 who much enhaunsed the Beauty of the Fabrick, which had been empaired and defaced with Fire, with magnificent Additions: from whom it is now transmitted by paternal Descent to his great Grand-child, the Right Hono∣rable 
Philip Smith
 Viscount 
Strangford,
 who hath made it his principal Residence.


The Mannor of 
Heyton,
 lies likewise in 
Stamford,
 which was anciently possest by a Family of deep Antiquity, which was known to the World by that Sirname, and bore for their Cognisance in Ancient Armorials, 
Gules three Piles Argent. Alanus de Heyton,
 called in some old Records 
Alanus Vicecomes,
 because he was joyned as an Assistant to 
Ralph de Picot,
 Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the execution of his Office, in the third, fourth, and fifth years of 
Henry
 the second, held a whole Knights Fee of 
Gilbert de Magninot,
 in the Government of that Prince, but deceased without Issue; so that 
Elveva
 his Sister matched to 
Deringus de Morinis
 Son of 
Norman de Morinis,
 became his Heir, from whom the Mannor of 
Heyton
 descended to his Son 
Deringus de Morinis,
 who still writ himself in his Dateless Deeds, 
Dominus de Hey∣ton,
 and so did

 
Richard Fitz-Dering
 his Grand-child, who died possest of it, in the forty second year of King 
Henry
 the third, and left it to his Son 
Peter Dering,
 who likewise held this Mannor almost all the reign of 
Edward
 the first, and from him did it descend to his Son and Heir 
Richard Dering,
 who was Brother to Sir 
Ro∣bert Dering,
 who was one of the Knights of St. 
John
 of 
Jerusalem:
 and this 
Richard,
 about the eighth year of 
Edward
 the second, passed it away to 
William Scot
 of 
Smeth,
 from whom by an uninterrupted and unbroken Clew of many Generations, was the Possession carried down to those 
Scots,
 who were Proprietaries of it in that Age, wherein our Grand-fathers flourished, and then it was demised by Sale to 
Smith,
 which Family it still confesses for Possessors.




Stansted
 in the Hundred of 
Wrotham,
 represents to our Remembrance an Ancient Family called 
Grapinell,
 who were once Owners of this place, and flourished here under the Scepter of 
Henry
 the third, and 
Edward
 the first: but going out in Daugh∣ters and Co-heirs, 
Margeria
 one of them, by marching with 
William de Inge,
 who was a Judge, in the raign of 
Edward
 the second, knit this Mannor to the Inheri∣tance of this Family, and he died seised of it, in the fifteenth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 42. and left it to his only Daughter and Heir, in an old Pedigree called 
Isolda:
 but more truely 
Joan;
 for in the Inquisition taken after the Death of 
Eudo la Zouch,
 to whom she, was matched, which was in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 31. it is found that he held this Mannor in Right of his Wise 
Joan,
 Sole Heir of 
William de Inge.
 And from this 
Eudo
 did 
Thomas la Zouch
 Baron of 
Haringworth
 descend, who died possest of it, in the sixth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 17. and so did his Son 
Henry
 Lord 
Zouch,
 who was the last of this Name who was possest of this place at his Decease, which was in the twenty sixth of 
Henry
 the sixth. After the 
Zouches
 the 
Colepepers
 were by purchase from them entituled to the Possession, and 
Richard Colepeper
 was found to hold it at his Death, which was in the second year of 
Richard
 the third, and from this Family, about the beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, it passed away to 
Thomas Leigh,
 whose Son 
John Leigh
 gave it to his natural Son 
Richard Leigh,
 in the year 1575. and he not long after alienated it to 
Bing
 of 
Wrotham,
 from which Family it is very lately carried away to 
William James
 of 
Ightam
 Esquire, one of the Justices of the Peace of this County, a Person who for his Affection to Learning and Anti∣quity, cannot be mentioned without an Attribute.


Soranks
 in this Parish, was the Seat of a Family, which borrowed its Sirname from hence, and had the Repute of a Mannor, in the reign of 
Edward
 the third. For 
Roger de Sorancks
 held this Mannor (as is evident by the Book of 
Aide
 kept in the Exchecquer) in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, by Knights Service of the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury.
 But after the reign of that Prince, it was not very constant to the Interest of this Name; for about the beginning of 
Richard
 the se∣cond, I find it in the possession of 
Thomas Mortimer,
 Lord of the Mannor of 
Mor∣timers
 in 
Cowling,
 and he in the twentieth year of the abovesaid Monarch, passed it away to 
William Skrene,
 and when this Name was worn out at this place, the Fa∣mily of 
Wood
 was ingrafted in the possession, and rested there until the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then it was by 
Thomas Wood
 passed away to 
Robert Bare∣foot,
 in which Family the Title was as transient; for 
Thomas Barefoot
 this mans Son, in the third and fourth of 
Philip
 and 
Mary,
 alienated it to 
Henry Fanshaw,
 who almost in our Fathers Remembrance conveyed the Fee-simple unto 
Launce.


Stansted
 had the Grant of a Fair obtained by 
William de Inge
 the Judge, in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the second, to be held yearly, for the space of three Dayes, at the Assumption of the Virgin 
Mary,
 as appears, 
Cart.
 9. 
Edwardi secundi Num.
 40.


Stapleherst
 in the Hundred of 
Twyford,
 was as appears by Ancient Deeds and In∣quisitions, as to some part of it, folded up in the large Patrimony of 
Fremingham,
 whose capital Residence was at 
Fremingham
 or 
Farningham,
 where I have treated more largely of them: but when the Male-line of this Family determined in 
John de Fremingham, Joan
 his only Sister matched to 
John Isley
 Esquire, Son of 
Isley
 was found to be his Heir, in the second year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and in her Right 
Ro∣ger Isley
 Son and Heir of this 
John,
 entered upon it, and from him the Land here, by a successive Thread of Descent, was wafted down to the Noble, but infortunate Sir 
Henry Isley,
 of whom more presently: but another parcel of this Mannor did acknowledge the Signory of 
Pimpe
 of 
Nettlested,
 and 
William Pimpe
 died possest of it, in the year of our Lord 1375. as part of his Knights Fee called 
Pimps:
 and in his Line did the Title flow constantly along, until it devolved to 
Reginald Pimpe
 Esquire, who about the twelfth year of. 
Henry
 the seventh, demised it by private Deed to 
John Isley
 Esquire, from whom it came down to his Grand-child Sir 
Henry Isley,
 who being entangled too fatally in the ruinous Design of Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 was in

the second year of Queen 
Mary
 attainted, and his Interest in this Mannor connsca∣ted to the Crown, which was granted out of it again that present year to Sir 
John Baker,
 Ancestor to Sir 
John Baker
 Baronet, who is still entituled to the Propriety 
Isley
 had formerly in this place.


Boxley
 Abby was formerly concerned in some Demeasne likewise here at 
Stapleherst,
 as appears by an Inquisition taken in the third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 134. which upon the suppression of that Abby, it was with the Mannor at 
Boxley
 relating to that Convent, by 
Henry
 the eighth, granted to Sir 
Thoma. Wiat,
 who being attainted, in the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 it escheated to the Crown, and then it, was by that Princess the same year granted to her Atturney General Sir 
John Baker,
 whose Successor Sir 
John Baker
 of 
Sisingherst
 now enjoyes it, as couched in his Mannor of 
Stapleherst.


Newsted
 is a Mannor in this Parish, which was annexed to the free Chappel erect∣ed at this place by 
Hamon de Crevequer,
 and invested with ample Privileges, which Donation of his, and all the Franchises united to it, was confirmed (as appears by the first Book of Compositions kept in the Registers Office at 
Rochester
) in the forty first year of 
Edward
 the third: But when the Statute in the first year of 
Edward
 the sixth, had overturned all Chauntries, this Mannor was swallowed up in the Revenue of the Crown, and then the abovesaid Prince, by his Royal Concession planted it in the Patrimony of Sir 
Edward Wotton,
 Ancestor to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Wotton
 of 
Boughton Malherbe,
 who setled it in Marriage on 
Katharine-Wotton
 his eldest Daughter and Co-heir espoused to 
Henry
 Lord 
Stanhop,
 and she by her Feoffees in Trust hath demi∣sed the Fee-simple to Mr. 
Robert Oliver
 of 
Leybourn.


Loveherst
 is another Mannor in this Parish, was parcel of that Estate, which by its Income supported the Priory of 
Leeds,
 and upon the Suppression, was by 
Henry
 the eighth granted to Sir 
John Gage,
 in the thirty fourth year of his reign, and he in the thirty sixth of that Prince, demised it to 
Thomas Colepeper
 Esquire, who not long after alienated it to 
Thomas Wilford
 Esquire, from whom about the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 it passed away by Sale to Mr. 
John Baker,
 in whose Descendants the Title is yet resident.


Engeherst
 presents it self next to our View, it is now vulgarly called 
Henherst,
 in Ages of an higher Ascent 
Engeherst,
 for some old Deeds without Date bounding some Land in this Parish of 
Stapleherst,
 make it situated 
juxta Terras Osberti de Heng∣herst supra Dennam de Engherst,
 and from this Den or Vally, did that Ancient Fa∣mily, called 
Engherst
 or 
Hengherst,
 take the first Extraction of its Name, who bore, as appears by several Seals, for their paternal Armory, 
Barrie of six peeces,
 and having continued in the possession of this place for many Descents, at last the In∣heritance was transmitted to 
Henry Hengherst,
 and he in the twenty third year of 
Henry
 the sixth, by his Feoffees in Trust, setles it on his Kinsman 
John Nash,
 and in his Family, I find it in the reign of 
Edward
 the fourth, and 
Henry
 the seventh; and here for want of clearer Intelligence, I must leap to the reign of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then the Fee-simple was invested in 
Roberts,
 and from this Family, about the latter end of that Princess, it went away by purchase to 
Moodye,
 who in our Fathers Memory alienated it to 
Samuel Ovenden,
 by whose Daughter and Co-heir 
Elizabeth Ovenden,
 it is now come to own the Heirs of her late Husband Mr. 
Partrich Tindall.


Spilsill-court
 is the last place of Account in this Parish, it was (as appears by very An∣cient Deeds) the Residence of a Family of that Name, which before the end of King 
Edward
 the second, was crumbled into Decay, and then the 
Stangraves
 suc∣ceeded in the Possession; for 
Robert de Stangrave
 at his Decease held some Estate at or in 
Spilsill,
 in the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 52. But a∣bout the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, this Family was likewise mouldered away, and then it came to own the Signory of 
Maynie,
 descended from 
Walter de Medua∣na
 or 
Maynie,
 a man of that Repute, as appears by the red Book in the Exchecquer, 
Fol.
 84. that he held twenty Knights Fees in this County: but 
Mayneys
 situated in 
Bredgar,
 was the Ancient Seat of this Name, who having possest for so many Successions and Descents this Seat, did not many years since transplant their Interest in it by Sale to 
Sharpeigh,
 by whose Daughter and Heir it is now become the Inheritance of Mr. 
George Thompson
 of 
London.




Swalcliff
 in the Hundred of 
Blengate,
 was given by 
Eadbald
 King of 
Kent,
 as 
Thorn
 the Chronicler of St. 
Augustins
 informs me, to the Cloister of St. 
Mildred,
 at 
Minster
 in 
Thanett;
 and was, when her body was translated, by King 
Canutus,
 to the Abby of St. 
Augustins
 in 
Canterbury,
 brought over along with it, and knit to the Patrimony of that Cloister: and the Monks of that Covent, granted it away to be held in Fee, by a Family which took its Denomination from thence, and were called 
Swalclive,
 and they held it the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third, as 
Testa de Nevill
 informs me, and paid an auxiliary Contribution for it, at the Marriage of 
Isa∣bell
 that Prince's Sister; but before the end of 
Edward
 the first, this Family was expired and then the Family of St. 
Lawrence
 was setled in the Possession. 
Thomas de St. Law∣rence
 held it, as appears by the Book of 
Aid,
 kept in the Exchequer, in the twen∣tieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at making the Black Prince Knight, and dyed possest of it, in the twenty second year of that Prince, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 9. And from him did it descend to his Grandchild 
Thomas St. Lawrence,
 who setled it in Marriage with 
Katharine
 his Daughter and Heir, matched to Sir 
William Apulder∣field,
 who determining in Daughters and Coheirs, 
Elizabeth
 one of them, espoused to Sir 
John Phineux,
 Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, brought it to confesse the Signory of that Family: but, he deceasing without Issue-male, 
Jane
 his only Daughter and Sole Inheritrix, being matched to 
John Roper
 Esquire, this Mannor became by this Alliance, inoculated into his Patrimony, and was resident in this Name untill the Beginning of King 
James;
 and then it was conveyed to Mr. 
Benedict Barnham,
 by one of whose four Daughters and Coheirs, its Right and Title devol∣ved to 
Soam
 of 
Suffolk,
 who not many years since, alienated his Concernment in it to 
Perry,
 who hath lately transmitted it by Sale to 
Gould.


In the year 946. King 
Eadred
 gave Land at 
Swalclive
 to 
Heresigus
 one of his Ser∣vants, and he again gave it to the Abby of St 
Augustins
 conditionally, that a place of Sepulture might be reserved for him within their Cloister.


Snave
 in the Hundreds of 
Aloes-Bridge, Ham
 and 
Newchurch,
 was as high as I can discover, a Portion or Member of that Patrimony, which confessed the Sig∣nory of 
Haut;
 and so continued, untill 
Joan
 Daughter and Coheir of Sir 
William Haut
 being made the Wife of the unhappy Sir 
Thomas Wiatt,
 a man of an unstained, though an unsuccesseful Virtue, this by Female Right became parcel of his Demeasne: but when he and his Patrimony were demolished by that impetuous Gust of Mis∣fortune, which sunk them both into a heap of Ruines, in the second year of Q. 
Mary,
 this upon his Conviction of high Treason, being escheated to the Crown, that Princesse in the third year of her Government, passed it away to Sir 
Henry Sidney,
 Knight of the Garter, and Lord Deputy of 
Ireland,
 whose Successor the Right Honorable 
Robert
 Earl of 
Leicester
 not many years since conveyed it to Sir 
George Stonehouse.


Snavewick
 in this Parish, was anciently wrapped up in the Demeasn, of the Abby of St. 
Augustins,
 but being pared off in the general Suppression, by the rough Hand of 
Henry
 the eighth; It was in the thirty fifth year of his reign, granted for Life only, to Sir 
Walter Henley:
 but upon his Decease it returned to the Crown, and lay there untill the late King 
Charls,
 about the Beginning of his reign, gran∣ted it to Mr. 
Patrick Black
 a Scotchman, who not long after, granted it in Lease to Sir 
Edw. Yates
 of 
Barkeshire,
 and conveyed the Fee-simple in Reversion to Mr. 
Rob. Austin
 now of 
Hall-place
 in 
Bexley.


Swanscamp
 in the Hundred of 
Acstane,
 hath contracted an eminent Character of Reputation, since 
Sueno
 or 
Swain
 fixed here his Camp, when he invaded 
England,
 to expiate by a plenary Revenge, that Blood, which in so prodigal an Effusion, was by 
Etheldred
 let loose from the Veins of his Danish Subjects, universally in this Nation; and certainly it was this 
Swain,
 that erected the Castle here to pre∣serve a Winter Station for his Ships, and though it now lye gasping in its own Rubbish, yet there are yet some Characters and Signatures remaining, which evidence and declare to us, that there was once a Fortresse there, where there is nothing

now but dismantled Ruines. The Tradition of the Country is, that, that Val∣ley which interposes between that Hill, which ascends up to 
Northfleet,
 and that which winds up to 
Swanscamp,
 was once covered with Water, and being locked in on each side with Hills, made a secure Road for Shipping, which invited the Dane to make it a Winter-Station for his Navy: and the same Report will tell you likewise, of Anchors which have been digged up about the utmost Verge of that Mersh, which is contiguous to the 
Thames,
 and certainly if we consider the Position of this Valley, which is nothing but a Chain of 
Mershland,
 interlaced with a Stream called 
Ebbs fleet,
 which swells and sinks with the Flux and Reflux of the adjacent River, and the Dimension of their Ships, then at that Time in use, which were not of any extraordinary Bulk, this Tradition is not improbable.


Near this place, 
Stigand
 the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and 
Egelsine
 Abbot of St. 
Augustines,
 assembled the 
Kentish
 Men into an Army, pretending it was better to dye like Men in asserting and vindicating their Native Liberties, with. Swords in their Hands, then like Slaves to prostitute themselves to the Insolence of the Con∣querour, by a cheap and tame Submission with Halters about their Necks: which had so great an Influence and Impression upon their Spirits, that they resolved their Fran∣chises and themselves should find one Tomb together, rather then they would give up both, to the Sword and Will of an imperious Victor; and indeed soon after they ma∣naged their Stratagems with that Successe, that 
William
 Sirnamed the Conquerour, advancing with his 
Normans
 into 
Kent,
 to reduce 
Dover-Castle,
 which was then made good against him, he and his Army dropped into those Ambushes, which the 
Kentish
 Inhabitants had strewed for him, where he had indisputably perished, had he not by Charter fortified and confirmed those Immunities, they then contended and strug∣led for, and which remain unviolated either by any forrain or domestick Eruption even untill this Day.


The Mannor of 
Swanscamp
 it self, was, as farre as Record can guide us to disco∣ver, the Inheritance of the 
Montchensies,
 called in the Latine, Repertory 
de Monte-Canisio:
 and 
Hubert de Montchensey
 (as appears by 
Dooms-day
 Book) was the first of that Name of any Eminence, who was Lord of the Fee; and after him his Son 
William de Montchensey,
 by paternal Right held it, and so dyed in Possession of it, in the year 1287; from whom it descended to 
Dionis
 his Daughter and Heir, and in Re∣lation to her, to her Husband, 
Hugh de Vere,
 who became by this Addition of Estate, thus accruing, Baron of 
Swanscamp,
 and sat, under that Notion, in the Parlia∣ment, which was summoned in the first year of 
Edward
 the second: but he dying without Issue, 
William de Valence
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 claimed it in Right of his Wife, Daughter and Heir to 
John de Montchensey,
 second Brother to 
William de Montchensey
 who was Father in Law to 
Hugh de Vere
 above-mentioned; from whom it descended to his Son 
Aymer de Valence,
 who dying without Issue, in the seventeenth year of 
Ed∣ward
 the third, 
Isabell
 his Sister matched to 
Lawrence de Hastings,
 became his Heir, who in her Right was Earl of 
Pembroke,
 and Baron of 
Swanscamp;
 and left it to his Grandchild 
John de Hastings,
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 who dying without Issue, in the four∣teenth of 
Richard
 the second; in the fifteenth year of that Prince, 
Reginald Grey,
 and 
Richard Talbot
 in respect of Marriage, were found to be his Heirs, and upon the Partition of the Estate, this was united to the Demeasne of 
Talbot,
 in which Family, after it had rested untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, it was conveyed to Sir 
Thomas Brown
 of 
Bechworth
 Castle, whose Son Sir 
William Brown,
 in the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, surrendered them into the hands of 
Edward
 the fourth, for the use of his Mother 
Cicely
 Dutchesse Dowager of 
York,
 upon whose Decease it returned to the Crown, and lay there untill the first year of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was granted to 
Ralph Weldon
 Esq; great Grand-father to Colonel 
Ralph Weldon
 the in∣stant Lord of the Fee.


Alcharden alias Combes
 is another place in this Parish, worthy this Survey. It was, many Hundred years since, the Inheritance of a Family called 
Cumbe
 or 
Combe,
 who continued resident in the Possession, untill the reign of 
Edward
 the fourth, and then it went away from them, by Sale to 
Swan
 of 
Hook
-House in 
Southfleet,
 in which Family it was fixed, untill the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was convey∣ed to 
Lovelace,
 who not long after, passed it away to 
Carter,
 and he alienated it to

Hardres,
 from whom, about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 the Vicissitude of Sale carried it off to 
Fagge,
 who in the tenth year of King 
James,
 transmitted it by Sale to 
Hudson,
 whose Descendant not many years fince, demised it by Sale to Mr. 
Richard Head
 of 
Rochester.


Ince-Grice
 is the last place considerable in 
Swanscampe.
 It related before the gene∣ral suppression to the Priory of 
Dartford:
 but being torn off by King 
Henry
 the eighth, it was by 
Edward
 the sixth, in the fifth of his reign, granted in Fee-Farm to 
Martin Muriell:
 but the Fee-simple remained in the Crown, until Queen 
Elizabeth,
 in the fifth year of her Rule, passed it away to 
Edward Darbishire
 and 
John Bere,
 who not long after jointly conveyed it to 
Jones,
 who in our Fathers Memory alienated it to 
Holloway,
 whose Son and Heir Mr. 
Thomas Holloway
 hath lately demised his Interest in it to Captain 
Edward Brent
 of 
Southwarke.


Staple
 in the Hundred of 
Eastry,
 hath two places memorable: First, 
Crixall
 which was Anciently written 
Crickleaddshall,
 when in Ages of a higher Ascent it confessed the Family of 
Brockhull
 for its Owners, which were Lords of it but until the twenty eighth of 
Edward
 the first, and then it was setled upon a Daughter: but whether she brought it or not by Marriage to 
Wadham,
 which Family I find about the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, to have been possest of it, I cannot discover; and where the Light of Record is dim, I must acquiesce in silence. 
William Wadhaem,
 as I trace out by an old Pedigree of 
Fogg,
 lived in the reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, 
Henry
 the fifth, and 
Henry
 the sixth, under the Scepter of which Princes he managed the Office of Justice of the Peace for the County of 
Somerset,
 and left his Estate here to his Son and Heir Sir 
Nicholas Wadham,
 who determined in a Daughter and Heir, match∣ed to Sir 
William Fogg,
 by which Alliance this Mannor came to be ingrafted into the Inheritance of that Family, and rested there until the first year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was passed away by Sale from Sir 
John Fogg
 Knight, to 
Ralph Banister.
 In Times of a lower Descent, that is, about the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 I find it by Court-rols possest by 
Tucker,
 who about the latter end of that Princess alienated his Concernment in it to 
Smith,
 who in our Fathers Remembrance trans∣planted the Title by Sale into Doctour 
Fotherbie
 Dean of 
Cantorbury,
 whose Son Mr. 
Charles Fotherbie
 continues now Proprietary of it.


Secondly, 
Grove-place
 offers it self up to our Notice, as being the Habitation of a Knightly Family, called 
Grove,
 who in old Deeds are sometimes written, at-
Grove,
 and sealed, as appears by the 
Labells
-affixed to their Evidences, with 
three Escollops upon a Cheveron:
 In the reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, I find it devolved by Descent to Sir 
John Grove,
 who was a great Benefactor to the Church of St. 
Peters
 in 
Sandwich,
 where he lies buried with the Arms above-mentioned upon his Shield: but not long after, this Family determined in a Daughter and Heir, who linked this Seat to the Inheritance of St. 
Nicholas,
 who about the latter end of 
Edward
 the fourth, con∣veyed it to 
Quilter,
 in which Name it was resident, until the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was passed away to 
Linch,
 and hath remained ever since in∣corporated into the Revenue of that Family: so that at present it is come down to Mr. 
John Linch,
 a Noble Confessor for the Interest of the Church, and Protestant Religion.


There is a Family in this Parish called 
Omer,
 which as appears by old Court-rols, Tombs, Deeds, and other Evidences, have been constantly resident almost four Hundred years.


Seasalter
 in the Hundred of 
Whitstaple,
 did belong to the Priory of 
Christ-church:
 but by whom it was given, the Records of that Covent are silent: only I find that it was part of that Revenue which supported their Diet and Table, and likewise I discover that Pope 
Gregory
 the ninth, in the tenth year of his Papacy, by his Bull appropriated the Parsonage to the Priory above-mentioned, and likewise was granted for the better improving their Lively-hood and Subsistence. If you will see under what Notion it passed, in the twentieth year of 
William
 the Conqueror, 
Doomesday
 Book will inform you, that it was valued upon the Terrier at two Carucats of Land, and upon the Appraisment was rated at five pound. This Mannor upon the Resigna∣tion

of that Estate, which related to the Convent abovesaid, into the Hands of 
Henry
 the eighth, was setled by that Prince on the newly erected Dean and Chapi∣ter of 
Christ-church,
 and there it remained, until these calamitous Times.


Ellenden
 in this Parish belonged to the Abby of 
Feversham,
 and was (as the Lieger Book of that Covent informs me) given to the Monks of that Cloister by 
John Ellen∣den,
 and here it was incorporated and fixed, until the publick Dissolution unhinged, and unrooted it, and planted it in the Crown: and afterwards King 
Henry
 the eighth, in the thirty fifth year of his Government granted it to Mr. 
Thomas Arden,
 misera∣bly afterwards assassinated by his Wife at 
Feversham;
 and he the same year conveyed it to 
John Nedeham,
 from whom it came over to his Son and Heir 
John Nedeham
 Gentleman, and he in the thirty second year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 alienated it to Mr. 
Michael Beresford
 of 
Westerham,
 who not long after passed it away to Sir 
George Newman
 Doctour of the Civil Law, and Knighted in the sixteenth year of King 
James:
 and from him by successive Right, it is now descended to his Son and Heir 
George Newman
 of 
Rochester
 Esquire.


Seale
 in the Hundred of 
Codsheath,
 was a Mannor which belonged to the Crown until the first year of King 
John,
 and then it was passed away by Grant to 
Baldwin de Betun
 Earl of 
Albemard;
 and 
Hawis
 his Daughter and Heir, by matching with 
William Mareschall
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 incorporated it into his Demeasne: but 
Gilbert Ma∣reschall
 this mans Successor deceasing without Issue, 
Roger de Bigod
 Earl of 
Norfolk,
 in Right of 
Mawde
 his Mother, who was Sister and Heir General to the abovesaid 
Gilbert,
 was setled in the possession of this Mannor, and he in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the first by Gift or Donation transmits it to 
Otho
 Lord 
Grandison,
 a man certainly of great power in those Times; for, as it appears, 
Pat.
 4. 
Edwardi primi,
 he had a certain Agreement woven. of sundry Articles, and made between 
Henry
 the third, and the King of 
Castile,
 deposited in his Custody, in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the first; And in the fifth year of that Prince, as appears 
Pat.
 5. 
in seedulâ,
 he had the Government of 
Jersey,
 assigned to his Care during Life; After this Fa∣mily of 
Grandison
 went out, which was about the Beginning of 
Richard
 the se∣cond (for 
Thomas de Grandison,
 dyed possest of 
Seale,
 in the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Parte prima Num.
 62) the noble Family of 
Brian
 of 
Holoway
 in 
Devon,
 was invested in the Possession, and Sir 
William Brian
 or 
Briene,
 for so he is styled on his Tomb, dyed possest of it in the year 1395, and lyes buryed in 
Seale
 Church, mailed in Armor, with a Huntsmans Horn at his Head: upon which the Conjecture of the Country is, that he was a great Hunter, when the Truth is, it was placed there, to signifie or denote the Tenure of some part of his Land, which was in 
Cornage.
 But to return: the next Family which succeeded 
Brian,
 in the Inheri∣tance of 
Seale,
 was the ancient Family of 
Fiennes,
 and this as I find by some Court-rolls, was in the reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, and 
James Fiennes,
 second Son of 
William Fiennes
 Esquire, was, the first of 
March,
 in the twenty fifth of 
Henry
 the sixth, summoned to the Parliament at 
Bury,
 as Baron of 
Say
 and 
Seale:
 but this place, after this newly atchieved Honor, continued not long in this Name; for 
William
 Lord 
Say,
 in the second year of 
Edward
 the fourth, passed it away to 
Geffrey Boleyne,
 Grand-father to Sir 
Thomas Boleyne,
 who was made Knight of the Garter, and Treasurer of the Kings House in the fifteenth, created Viscount 
Roch∣ford
 in the seventeenth, and lastly raised to the Earldome of 
Wiltshire,
 and 
Ormond
 in the twenty first of 
Henry
 the eighth: but his infortunate Son 
George
 Viscount 
Rochford,
 being beheaded and leaving no Issue, it devolved to Queen 
Elizabeth,
 in Right of Queen 
Anne
 her Mother one of the Sisters and Coheirs, and she in the first year of her reign, passes it by Grant to her Kinsman 
Henry Cary,
 whose Grandchild 
Henry Cary
 Earl of 
Dover
 alienated it by Sale to 
Richard Sackvill
 Earl of 
Dorset,
 who passed it away in our Fathers Memory to 
Richard Smith,
 vulgarly called 
Dog Smith,
 and he not many years since deceasing without Issue bequeathed the Fee-simple of it to St 
Thomas
 Hospital in 
Southwarke.


Hall-place
 in 
Seale
 is a second place of Account, It was in the thirty sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, as an old Rentall discovers to me (and farther none of the an∣cient Evidences do reach) the Patrimony of 
Thomas Champneys,
 and he makes it over

in part to Sir 
William Wroth
 of 
Enfield,
 and he in the second year of 
Richard
 the se∣cond, alienated all his Right and Interest in it to 
Thomas Lovell,
 but some part remained unsold untill the nineteenth of the abovesaid Prince, and then it was wholly invested by Sale from 
Robert Champneys,
 in the aforesaid 
Thomas Lovell,
 and he by his Feoffees in Trust, as namely 
John Osborne, John Arnold, Richard Marshall,
 and 
John Atsheath,
 conveyed it in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the fourth, to 
Thomas Theobald
 or 
Tebald,
 and 
Mawde
 his Wife, and so by this Purchase, did it become the Inheritance of this Family, and made its aboad here, untill the twenty fourth year of 
Henry
 the seventh; and then 
John Theobald
 alienated it to 
William Porter,
 which Family it is probable were concerned in it before: for in the tenth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, I find 
John Alphey
 releases by Deed his right in 
Hall,
 to 
William Porter
 Esquire; and from 
William Porter
 abovesaid, did the Title slow down in the Chanel of paternal Right, to Mr. 
Andrew Porter,
 who concluding in a Daughter and Heir called 
Elizabeth,
 it is now by matching with her, become the Patrimony of Mr. 
Peter Stowell,
 Register of the Diocesse of 
Ro∣chester.


Stidulfe
 is a third Mannor in 
Seale,
 which afforded both Seat and Sirname to a Fa∣mily so called. 
Robert de Stidulfe,
 is mentioned in Deeds without Date to have held this, and much other Land in 
Seale.
 In the thirty sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, I find, 
Reginald Stidulfe
 of 
Stidulfe,
 accounts with 
Thomas Champneis
 for Land held of his Mannor of 
Hall.
 And lastly I discover, that 
William Stidulfe,
 about the ele∣venth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, by Sale, conveyed it to 
William Quintin,
 whose Son 
William,
 changed the Name of 
Quintin
 into 
Oliver,
 upon what Grounds I have dis∣covered at 
Leybourn;
 and in this Name was this Mannor lodged untill the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 and then it was passed away to 
Richard Theobald,
 whose Son 
John,
 exchanged it with his Kinsman 
Stephen Theobald,
 who dying without Issue-male, left two Coheirs, 
Katharine
 matched to 
Edward Michell,
 and 
Mar∣garet
 wedded to 
David Polhill,
 who shared his Inheritance, and this upon the Division of the Estate, augmented the Revenue of 
Michell,
 and his Descendant Mr....... 
Michell,
 is now the Heir apparent of it.


Sedingbourn
 in the Hundred of 
Milton,
 hath several places in its confines remark∣able, whereof 
Bayford
 and 
Goodneston
 first claim our Notice, the last of which had a Castle, whose Banks and Ruines are yet visible; it anciently acknowledged the Family of 
Nottingham,
 who likewise in elder Times were possest of 
Bayford
 for Proprietaries. 
Robert de Nottingham
 flourished in the reign of 
Edward
 the first, and dates several of his Deeds in the Beginning of that Prince's Rule, 
apud Ca∣stellum suum de Goodneston. Robert de Nottingham
 his Successor, was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 the forty eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, and held his Shriovalty at 
Bay∣ford
 in 
Sedingbourn,
 in which year he dyed, and was found to have held at his Death, Lands at 
Sharsted, Pedding
 in 
Tenham,
 a place called 
Newland,
 and ano∣ther called 
la Herst, Higham
 in 
Milsted, Bixle
 in 
Tong,
 now called 
Bex,
 and last∣ly 
Goodneston
 and 
Babford,
 now named 
Bayford
 in this Parish, all which descended to his only Son 
John Nottingham;
 whose only Daughter and Heir 
Eleanor Not∣tingham,
 was matched to 
Simon Cheyney,
 second Son of Sir 
Richard Cheyney
 of 
Shurland,
 who brought all this spreading Revenue, to acknowledge the Signory of this Family, and the Coats of 
Cheyney
 and 
Nottingham, viz. Azure six Lions Argent, a Canton Ermin and Gules, two Pales wavee Argent
 stand empaled in 
Mil∣sted-church,
 in coloured Classe. But this Alliance, though it much enhaunsed by ad∣ditional improvement the Patrimony of 
Cheyney,
 yet could not so strongly entwine the Interest of 
Bayford
 and 
Goodneston
 with this Name: but that about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, they were conveyed away by Sale to 
Lovelace;
 for 
Richard Lovelace
 of 
Queenhith
 in 
London,
 a younger Branch of the 
Lovelaces
 of 
Bethersden,
 made his Will the first of 
Aprill
 1465, and there ordained that his Feoffees should make an Estate of his Mannors of 
Bayford
 and 
Goodneston
 in 
Sedingbourn,
 which he had purchased of 
Cheyney,
 to 
John Lovelace
 his Son and Heir, which accordingly was performed, and he invested in the Possession of them; and from him did they by Descent devolve to his Crandchild 
Thomas Lovelace,
 of 
Kingsdown,
 who in the

tenth year of Queen 
Elizabeth
 passed them away to Mr. 
Ralph Finch;
 from which Fami∣ly they went away by the same Revolution, almost in our Fathers Memory to Alderman 
Garret
 of 
London,
 who had Issue Sir 
John Garret,
 of the County of 
Hertford,
 whose Widow Dowager the Lady ..... 
Garret
 by right of Jointure, now enjoys the Profits of both these Mannors.


Chilton
 is another Mannor in 
Sedingbourn,
 which had Owners of this Sirname, who likewise held another Mannor of this Name in 
Ash,
 both which places 
William de Chilton
 held at his Death, which was in the thirty first of 
Edward
 the first: but after his 
Exit,
 it did not long confesse the Propriety of this Family; for about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the third, it was demised by Sale to 
Corbie,
 and 
Robert Corbie
 was possest of it at his Decease, which was in the thirty ninth year of that Prince, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 9. and he had Issue 
Robert Corbie,
 whose Sole Daugh∣ter and Heir, 
Joan Corbie
 espoused Sir 
Nicholas Wotton,
 twice Lord Maior of 
Lon∣don,
 by whom this Mannor and much other Land, came by a fruitfull Augmentation, to swell the Inheritance of this Family, yet I find the Interest in 
Chilton
 was not solely lodged in 
Corbie;
 for by ancient Deeds I discover that an old Family cal∣led 
Maris
 was concerned in some part of it likewise. 
John de Maris
 held a Knights Fee in 
Wicheling,
 and much other Land at 
Herietsham,
 the twentieth year of 
Ed.
 the third, as likewise the Mannor of 
Ackmere
 in St. 
Mary Crey
 in Castle-guard of 
Dover-castle:
 and his great Grand-child 
William Maris,
 was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the twenty first year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and was Esquire to 
Henry
 the fifth, and after∣wards to 
Cardinall Kemp,
 and lyes enter'd in 
Preston
 Church, with so much of the Inscription left, as may instruct the Reader, that his Ashes slumber beneath the Tomb-stone: yet before his Decease he had alienated his share in this Mannor to 
Nicholas Wotton
 Esquire, from whom the united Interest of this place came down to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Wotton,
 who not many years since setled it in Marriage on 
Katherine
 his eldest Daughter, matched to 
Henry
 Lord 
Stanhop,
 Son and Heir to 
Philip
 Earl of 
Chesterfeild
 lately deceased, who still enjoyes the propriety of it.


In the year 1232. 
Henry
 Bishop of 
Rochester,
 as 
Thomas Rudborne
 a Monk of St. 
Swithens
 in 
Winchester
 does relate, came on a Sabbath Day with much exultation out of 
Sedingbourn
 Church, and desired the people to express their Joy, because on that Day by the efficacious prayers of the Church, 
Richard
 the first, formerly King of 
England,
 and many others, were ransomed from the Flame and Torment of Pur∣gatory.


In 
Sedingbourn
 Church there was a Monument of Sir 
Richard Lovelace,
 inlayed richly with Brasse, who was an eminent Souldier in his Time, and Marshal of 
Ca∣lais,
 under 
Henry
 the eighth, with his Pourtraiture affixed in Brass, which the In∣juries of Time, and the Impiety of Sacrilegious Mechanicks, have utterly dis∣mantled and defaced.


Selling
 in the Hundred of 
Boughton,
 did in Ages of the highest Discovery, acknow∣ledge the Signory of the 
Putots,
 and 
William de Putot
 was in Possession of it at his Death, which happened in the thirteenth year of 
Henry
 the third. After the 
Pu∣tots
 the Lords 
Badelesmer
 were invested in the possession. 
Guncelin de Badelesmer
 was possest of it, in the twenty ninth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 50. and left it with a spatious Inheritance to his Son 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 who having involved himself in a ruinous Combination with some others of the mutinous Nobility against 
Edward
 the second, lost both his Life and Estate in that unsuccesful Defection, but this Mannor was restored to his Son, in the second year of King 
Edward
 the third, and was known by the Name of 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer:
 but did not long enjoy his new acquired Inheritance; for in the twelfth year of the above-mentioned Prince, he died without Issue, and left his Estate to be shared be∣tween four Sisters and Co-heirs, whereof 
Margaret
 the eldest was espoused to Sir 
John Tiptoft,
 and he in her Right entered upon the possession of this place, and died possest of it, in the thirty third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 39. from whom the Title came down to 
John Tiptoft,
 created Earl of 
Worcester,
 in the year 1450. and invested afterwards with the Office and Dignity of Lord Treasurer and Lord Constable of 
England:
 but asserting too eagerly the Cause and Quarrel of the

House of 
Yorke,
 he was crushed and overwhelmed with that weight, with which the Partisans of the 
Lancastrian
 Faction did endevour to sink and oppresse the Sup∣porters of that Family, and was offered up a Victime to the successful Fury of 
Richard
 Earl of 
Warwick,
 who being an Apostate of the House of 
Yorke,
 was the principal Engine upon whom the Designs and Interess of the 
Lancastrian
 Party then moved: Upon the untimely Death and attaint of this Earl, which was in the year 1570. this Mannor was annexed to the Revenue of the Crown, and though 
Edward Tiptoft
 this mans Son, was the next year after his Fathers unhappy 
Exit,
 restored by 
Edward
 the fourth, both in Blood and Dignity; yet I do not discover any Restitution made of 
Selling;
 so that it rested in the Crown, until 
Edward
 the sixth, in the fourth year of his reign, granted it to Sir 
Anthony St. Leger,
 who immediatly after passed it away to Sir 
Anthony Sonds
 of 
Throuley,
 one of the Justices of the Peace of this County, and Gentleman of the Bed-chamber to this Prince, and his Father 
Henry
 the eighth, from whom it is now come down by Paternal efflux of the Title to Sir 
George Sonds
 Knight of the 
Bath,
 who is entituled to the present possession of it.


Oven-court
 in this Parish anciently gave both Seat and Sirname to a Family, which was known by that Denomination; but whether they were extracted from the 
Owens
 of 
Wales,
 and contracted this Name of 
Oven
 by vulgar Acceptation, no Record does manifest; certain it is they were, as appears by old Rentals and other Muniments, possessors of this place, as high as the reign of 
Henry
 the third.


The next Family which (after this was worn out) did step into the possession, was 
Drilond
 of 
Cookes-ditch
 in 
Feversham,
 a Name of generous Extraction; for in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, 
John
 the Son of 
Stephen de Drilond,
 demises some Land at 
Crouchfeild
 in 
Feversham,
 by a Deed bearing Date from the twenty fifth year of that Prince, to 
William de Makenade,
 and in that Instrument he writes himself Knight. After 
Drilond
 was extinguished, which was about the beginning of 
Edward
 the fourth, the 
Foggs
 became Proprietaries of it, and remained for divers years Lords of the Fee, until at last the alternate Devolution of Purchase brought it to be the Inheritance of 
Crouch,
 where it did not long fix, for in the year 1588. 
Giles Crouch
 alienated it to 
Michael Sonds
 Esquire, afterwards Knighted, from which Family in our Fathers Memory it was conveyed by Sale to 
Franklin,
 from whom the same Devolution hath brought it now to 
Lambe,
 who holds the instant Signory of it.


Before I passe from 
Selling,
 I must inform the Reader, that the greatest Honour which this Town acquired, was, that it was the Cradle of 
William Selling
 bred up amongst the Monks of 
Christ-church,
 who obtained Licence from the Chapter of that Covent, to travel into 
Italy,
 and prosecute his Studies at 
Bononia,
 where he arrived to that perfection of Knowledge, that he was advanced to be Prior of 
Christ∣church,
 and was after sent by 
Henry
 the seventh, in whose Eyes his Worth was very visible, as his Embassador to the Pope. Those incomparable Books, which were placed in the Library, which related to the Covent, by his Care and Munificence, amongst which was 
Tullies
 invaluable 
Tractate de Republica,
 not long after his Death, by an Accidental Fire, found an unhappy Sepulchre in their own Ashes. He died as full of Fame as of Years, in the year of 
Grace
 1494. And hath his Epitaph re∣gistred by the industrious Pen of Mr. 
Somner
 in his Survey of 
Canterbury.


Smerden
 in the Hundreds of 
Calchill, Blackborne,
 and 
Barckley,
 did Anciently relate to the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and was part of that Revenue which did keep up the Grandeur and Magnificence of that Sea, rescuing it from all cheapness and contempt, which induced 
John
 then Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 this being so eminent a part of the Spiritual Patrimony, to obtain a Grant of a Market to be observed here weekly on the Monday, as appears, 
Pat.

 47. But the principal place, which was alwayes of secular Interess within this Parish, is 
Romden,
 which was the Patrimony of an Ancient Family, called 
Hengherst,
 and in more modern Times 
Henherst,
 who were entituled to large Demeasnes at 
Wood∣church, Stapleherst, Yalding,
 and other places in this County; but made no long aboad here at 
Romden,
 for 
William
 Son of 
Osbert de Hengherst,
 so he cals himself in his Deed without Date, demised it to 
John de Calch,
 and in this Family it continued until the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, and who after 
Calch
 succeeded in the In∣heritance,

because I can collect no farther Knowledge from original Evidences; I confess I am ignorant, so that I am forced to leap over divers Kings reigns into that of King 
Henry
 the eighth, and then in the twenty fourth year of that Prince, I find that 
John
 the Son of 
Stephen Rogers
 alienates it by Sale to 
Stephen Drayner,
 and it is probable 
Rogers
 purchased it of 
Norton,
 which Family, as appears by the 
Feudaries
 Book, held much Land here at 
Smerden,
 and at or near 
Romden:
 But to return; In 
Drayner
 the Interest of this place was fixed, until the seventeenth of Queen 
Eliza∣beth,
 and then 
William Drayner
 passed it away by Sale to Sir 
Roger Manwood,
 and he in the eighteenth year of that Princess, alienates it again to 
Martin James
 Esquire, Remembrancer of the Exchecquer, and from him by the Devolution of successive and paternal Right, it is now come down to acknowledge the Propriety of Mr. .... 
James.


Snergate
 in the Hundred of 
Aloe bridge
 celebrates the Memory of an Ancient Fa∣mily styled 
Alarar. Gervas Alarar
 was Captain and Admiral of the Fleet of Ships set forth and furnished by the Cinque-ports, in the fourteenth year of 
Edward
 the first, and 
Gervas Alarar
 was his Grand-child, whose Widow 
Agnes Alarar
 was in possession of it at her Death, which was in the forty second year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 1. But before the end of 
Henry
 the fourth, this Family was shrunk into an Expiration, and then 
Walter Moile,
 who was a Judge in the reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, succeeded in the Possession, and he by a Fine, levied in the thirtieth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, demises it to 
Hugh Brent,
 from whom about the latter end of 
Edward
 the fourth, it was conveyed to 
Cheyney,
 and in this Name it was fixed, until 
Hen∣ry
 Lord 
Cheyney,
 in the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 alienated it to 
Henry Nevill
 Lord 
Aburgavenny,
 who in the twenty ninth year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 dying with∣out Issue-male; 
Mary Nevill
 was found to be his Sole Inheritrix, and she by match∣ing with Sir 
Thomas Vane
 knit this Mannor to his Patrimony: and his Son 
Francis Vane
 created Earl of 
Westmerland,
 in the twenty second of King 
James,
 alienated it in our Fathers Memory to 
Jackman,
 who not long after sold it to Sir 
Edward Hen∣den,
 one of the Barons of the Exchecquer, who upon his Decease gave it to his Ne∣phew Sir 
John Henden,
 whose Son and Heir 
Edward Henden
 Esquire, now enjoyes the Signory of it.


Smeth
 in the Hundred of 
Bircholt,
 hath in the Limits of it 
Scots-hall
 which is now and hath been for divers Descents the Inheritance of eminent Gentlemen of that Sirname, whom I dare aver, upon probable Grounds were originally called 
Balioll. William Balioll,
 second Brother to 
Alexander de Balioll,
 frequently writ his Name 
William de Balioll le Scot,
 and it is probable, that upon the Tragedy of 
John
 Earl of 
Atholl,
 who was made prisoner by 
Edward
 the first, and barbarously executed, in the year 1307. (whilst he endevoured more nobly then successfully to defend the gasping Liberty of 
Scotland,
 against the Eruptions of that Prince;) this Family to decline the Fury of that Mo∣narch, who was a man of violent passions, altered the Name of 
Balioll,
 to that of their Extraction and Country, and assumed for the future the Name of 
Scot.
 That the Sirname of this Family was originally 
Balioll,
 I farther upon these Reasons as∣sert. First, the ancient Arms of 
Balioll
 Colledge in 
Oxford,
 which was founded by 
John Balioll,
 and dedicated to St. 
Katharine,
 was a 
Katharin-Wheele,
 being still part of the paternal Coat of this Family. Secondly, 
David de Strabogie,
 who was Son and Heir to the infortunate Earl abovesaid, astonished with an Example of so much Terror, altered his Name from 
Balioll
 to 
Strabogie,
 which was a Signory which accrued to him in Right of his Wife, who was Daughter and Heir to 
John Comin
 Earl of 
Badzenoth
 and 
Strabogie,
 and by this Name King 
Edward
 the second, omitting that of 
Balioll,
 restored 
Chilham-castle
 to him for Life, in the fifteenth year of his reign. Thirdly, the Earls of 
Bucleugh,
 and the Barons of 
Burley
 in 
Scotland,
 who derive themselves originally from 
Balioll,
 are known at this instant by no other Sir∣name; but 
Scot,
 and bear, with some inconsiderable Difference, those very Arms which are at present the paternal Coat of this Family of 
Scots-hall.
 Having thus traced out the Name, I shall now represent a Scale of those eminent Persons, who have either directly or collaterally been extracted from 
Scots-hall.
 Sir 
William Scot,


who was knighted the tenth of 
Edward
 the third, was Lord Chief Justice, and Knight Marshal of 
England,
 in the reign of that Prince. Sir 
Robert Scot
 was Lieutenant of the 
Tower,
 in the year 1424. Sir 
John Scot
 was Comptroller of the House, one of the Privy Councel to 
Edward
 the fourth, and Marshal of 
Calais. Thomas Scot
 who was first Bishop of 
Rochester,
 next of 
Lincolne,
 Provost of 
Beverley,
 Arch-bishop of 
York,
 Lord Chancellor of 
England,
 and Privy Councellor to King 
Edward
 the fourth, altered his Name from 
Scot
 to 
Rotheram,
 as being the place of his Education and Na∣tivity; but, it is probable, originally issued out from this Family. Sir 
William Scot,
 who was Son to Sir 
John
 above-mentioned, was Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports. Sir 
John Scot
 his Son, was knighted by the Prince of 
Castile,
 for signal Service perfor∣med by him, against the Duke of 
Gueldres.
 Sir 
Reginald Scot
 was Captain of the Castle of 
Callis.
 Sir 
Thomas Scot
 was Commander in Chief of the 
Kentish
 Forces, who assembled upon the plains by 
Northbourn,
 to oppose the Spanish Invasion, in the year 1588. All of which were either directly or collaterally Predecessors (being of the same Family) to 
Edward Scot,
 now Proprietary of 
Scots-hall
 Esquire, who was Son and Heir of Sir 
Edward Scot,
 who was made Knight of the Bath, at the Coro∣nation of K. 
Charles.


Thevegate
 is a second Mannor in this Parish, which was in elder Times, the Inheri∣tance of Gentlemen, of no mean Account in this Track. 
Robert de Passeley
 or 
Passelew,
 (for they are promiscuously so written) was Treasurer of 
England,
 under 
Peter de Rivallis,
 in the reign of 
Henry
 the third, as 
Mat. Paris
 in the Life of that Prince does record. 
Edmund de Passeley,
 was with 
Edward
 the second, at 
Borough-Bridge
 in the seventeenth year, as the Pipe-roll of that Time, discovers; and probably was instrumental in the Defeat, given there to the Nobility then in Arms against that Prince; and from him this Mannor did descend to 
John Passeley
 Esquire, who in the reign of 
Edward
 the fourth, determined in 
Elizabeth
 his sole Heir, matched to 
Reginald Pimp
 Esquire, who likewise had the Fate to conclude in a Female Inheritrix called 
Ann,
 who was wedded to Sir 
John Scot,
 of 
Scots-hall,
 and Shee united 
Thevegate,
 to the Revenue of that Family; and from him is the Right of it by Descent transportted to his Successor 
Edward Scot
 of 
Scots-hall,
 Esquire.


Smeth
 had the Grant of a Market procured to it by the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury
 in the tenth year of 
Edward
 the third,


Shepebourn
 in the Hundred of 
Wrotham,
 was the Patrimony of an ancient Fa∣mily called 
Bavent,
 whose principal Estate lay in 
Sussex
 and 
Surrey. Adam de Ba∣vent,
 in the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the first, obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of 
Shepbourn,
 and in the thirteenth year of that Prince's reign, had as appears 
Pat.
 13. 
Edwardi primi, Memb.
 28. a Grant of a Market weekly to this place, to be held on the 
Monday,
 and a Fair for three Days Space, at the Feast of St. 
Giles;
 and this 
Adam de Bavent
 or else his Son, was one of those eminent 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who was embarked with 
Edward
 the first, in his Expedition into 
Scotland,
 and was one of those who were created Bannerets at the Siege of 
Carlaverock
 in the twenty eighth year of his reign. 
Roger de Bavent,
 was sum∣moned in the fourteenth year of 
Edward
 the second, to sit in Parliamennt as Ba∣ron; After whom I find no more mention of this Family, as Possessors of this Man∣nor: for it is probable, the Religion and muffled Perswasion of those Times, had so warped the Piety and Devotion of this Family, that they setled it on the Pri∣ory of 
Leeds:
 for by an old Rental of that Covent, I find it wrapped up in their Demeasn, in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, and remained parcel of their Income, until the general Shipwrack in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth; and then it was in the thirty sixth year of that Prince, granted to Sir 
Ralph Vane,
 and 
Anthony Tustham
 Esquire, who not long after having passed away his Interest in it, to Sir 
Ralph Vane,
 it hath continued ever since, to acknowledge the absolute Signory of this Family so that the right of it now rests in Sir 
Henry Vane,
 Son and Heir to Sir 
Henry Vane
 Se∣cretary of Estate to his late Majesty.


Fairlane
 is an eminent Seat in this Parish, which likewise did confesse the Signory of the Family of 
Bavent;
 but before the latter end of 
Edw.
 the third, they had abandoned the

Possession of it, and then it came to confesse the Signory of 
Colepepers,
 who remained Lords of the Fee, untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the fourth; and then it was trans∣mitted by Sale to 
Chown;
 in which Family after the Propriety had been constantly resident, untill that Age which almost was circumscribed within the Verge of our Remembrance, Sir 
George Chown
 the last of this Name at this place, desiring to con∣tract his Revenue solely within the Confines of 
Sussex,
 alienated his Estate here to Sir 
Henry Vane,
 Comptroller of his late Majestie's Houshould, and principal Secreta∣ry of Estate, who having much beautified and adorned the ancient Fabrick with new Additions, upon his late Decease, bequeathed it to be enjoyed by his Lady Dowager.


Stelling
 in the Hundred of 
Lovingborough,
 was with 
Wadenhall
 (which lyes partly in this Parish, and partly in 
Petham
) parcell of the Inheritance of the illustrious Fa∣mily of 
Haut;
 and 
William de Haut
 had 
Stelling
 and 
Wadenhall
 in the first year of 
Ed.
 the first, and this above-mentioned 
VVilliam
 founded a Chappel at 
VVadenhall,
 and de∣dicated it to St. 
Edmund
 the Saxon King of the East Angles, and in this Family these Mannors continued untill the latter end of the reign of 
H.
 the sixth, and then 
VVill. Haut,
 lineally extracted from the above-said 
VVilliam,
 conveyed 
Stelling
 to 
Humphrey Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham:
 and this being forseited to the Crown, upon the At∣tainder of his Grandchild 
Edward Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham
 in the thirteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, this lay enwrapped in the royal Revenue, untill Queen 
Mary,
 in the first year of her reign, granted it with much other Land to 
Edward
 Lord 
Clin∣ton,
 who about the last year of that Princesse, alienated it to Mr. 
Henry Herdson,
 whose Grandchild Mr. 
Francis Herdson,
 about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 passed it away to Mr. 
John Herdson
 his Uncle, who dying without Issue, disposed of it by Will to his Nephew Sir 
Basill Dixwell
 of 
Terlingham
 in 
Folkstone;
 from whom by descendant Devolution, it is now come down to his Heir General Mr. 
Basill Dixwell
 of 
Broom
 in 
Barham.
 But 
VVadenhall
 remained in the Name of 
Haut,
 untill by the Steps of several Descents, it was wafted along to Sir 
VVilliam Haut,
 one of whose two Daughters and Coheirs called 
Elizabeth,
 being wedded to Sir 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bedgebury,
 brought it to acknowledge the Interest of that Fa∣mily; and he having exchanged it with 
Edward
 the sixth, it confessed the Signory of the Crown, untill Queen 
Elizabeth,
 in the forty second year of her reign, granted it to Sir 
John Sotherton,
 Baron of her Exchequer, whose Heir, in the memory of these Times, gave up his Right in it by the Fatality of Sale, to Mr. 
Benjamin Pere
 of 
Canterbury.


The Advowson of the two Parsonages, or Rectories of 
Stelling
 and 
Ʋpper Hardres,
 were granted to the Priory of 
Tunbridge,
 in the twenty sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Pat.

Selling
 in the Hundred of 
Street,
 hath several places in it which cannot be declined without some Memorial: 
Willmington
 and 
Somervill,
 are the first that occurre, and they gave Seat, and one of them Sirname, to a Family of Repute in that Age, be∣cause I find they had Land in other places in the County. 
Roger de Wilmington,
 held the Possession of them at his Death, which was in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the third, and left his Estate here and elsewhere, to be shared between his four Daugh∣ters and Coheirs, matched to 
Ordmere, Bromming, Brockhull
 and St. 
Laurence;
 but upon the Division of the Estate, these accrued to St. 
Laurence,
 and in Right of pa∣ternal Devolution, 
John St. Laurence,
 Son of 
Thomas St. Laurence,
 held these at his Decease, which was in the tenth year of 
Richard
 the second, and from him their right devolved to his Son 
Thomas St. Laurence,
 whose Sole Daughter and Heir 
Katharine,
 brought them to be the Inheritance of Sir 
William Apulderfield;
 who about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, passed them away to 
Ashburnham
 and 
Till:
 and the first of those, having wholly setled his Right in them by Sale in 
Till,
 they rested in this Family, until the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then 
Peter Heyman
 Esquire, having wedded the sole Inheritrix of 
Till,
 they were transplanted into the Patrimony of that Family; and from him the Propriety descended to his great Grandchild my worthy Friend Sir 
Henry Heyman
 Baronet, lately deceased.




Haringe
 is a second place of Consideration: it was, as high as any Clew of Record can lead us, the Possession of the 
Gurneys. Hugh de Gurney,
 who is in the Register of those who entered 
England,
 with 
William
 the 
Norman,
 held it under his Scepter. In Ages almost of the next Step or Descent, the 
Sharsteds
 had it; and 
Robert de Shar∣sted,
 who flourished under 
Edward
 the first, 
Edward
 the second, and dyed in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the third, was possest of it at his Decease; but this Name was suddenly worn out, for in the Time subsequent to this, 
Henry Brockhull
 of 
Brockhull
 in 
Saltwood
 enjoyed it, who likewise had some Interest in 
Wilmington
 and 
Somervill,
 which his Successor sold to 
Ashburnham;
 and here the Propriety made its aboad, un∣till the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was conveyed to 
Inglethorp;
 and to the Demeasne of this Name it was linked, untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh; and then it was wafted over by Sale to 
Morton;
 and here the Title lodged untill our Grand-fathers memory; and then it was alienated to 
Willonghbie;
 and Sir 
Francis Willoughbie,
 sold his Concernment in it to 
Ralph Heyman
 Esquire; from whom it came over to his Son and Heir Sir 
Peter Heyman,
 who some years since upon the Marriage of his second Son 
Peter Heyman,
 setled it on him, whom yet it owns for, Proprietary.


Hodiford
 is the last place of any Estimate: In elder Times a Family was setled here which borrowed its Sirname, as it did its Residence, from this Mansion; for 
John Ho∣diford
 or 
Hodinorth,
 was Lord of the Demeasne: but when this Name departed from this place, the 
Cardens
 were the next in order, who were Possessors of the Fee; from whom by the Vicissitude of Sale, it was transmitted to 
Cobbe,
 where the Title had not long been lodged, but it was by the like Devolution, conveyed by 
James Cobbe
 the last of the Name who enjoyed it, to 
Thomas Godfrey
 Esquire; a Person to whom by several Engagements both of Learning and Friendship, I stand now ob∣liged.


Shelvich
 in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 was formerly the Patrimony of 
Atleeze,
 a Family of no contemptible Value in this Circuit, who layd the Foundation of a House near the 
Leas,
 and from its Situation extracted their Sirname: but the greatest Honor which accrued to this House in elder Times, was, that it was the Cradle of Sir 
Richard Atleeze,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, and several times a Member or Burgesse of those Parliaments, which assembled in that Age: but dying without Issue, 
Marcellus Atleeze,
 his only Brother be∣came his Heir, but he not long after made his 
Exit,
 in two Daughters and Co∣heirs, whereof 
Lucy
 the eldest was matched to 
John Norton
 Esquire, and 
Cicely
 the youngest, was wedded to 
Valentine Barret
 of 
Perry-court:
 but 
Norton
 upon the Divi∣sion of the Estate, was in his Wifes Right, entituled to this Mannor; and in this Family, after the Title had for many discents resided, it was by an ever Thread of Succession, gui∣ded down to Sir 
Thomas Norton
 of 
Milton;
 who not many years since, passed it away to Sir 
Richard Sonds,
 originally extracted from an ancient Family, which about the reign of 
Henry
 the third, had their Habitation at 
Sonds-place
 at 
Darkin
 in 
Surrey,
 whose Son and Heir Sir 
George Sonds,
 Knight of the Bath, by Discent from him, claims the Interest and Signory of it, and hath upon the old Foundation of 
Leeze
-Court, erected a Pile so set out with all the cunning and Pomp of Magnificence, that it is scarcely to be out-rivalled by a Fabrick of that Bulk, in any part of the 
English
 Nation. Sir 
Richard Atleeze,
 lyes entombed in 
Shelvich
 Church, under a fair Gravestone, with his Portraicture in Brasse annexed, as likewise that of his Lady, as fairly insculped, with this Epitaph affixed to both their Figures. 
Hic jacet Dominus Ricardus Atleese Miles, ac Domina Dionisia uxor ejus, qui quidem Ricardus obiit Anno Dom.
 1394.


Coperhams-Sole
 in this Parish, for several Centuries of years, hath confessed the 
Belks
 to have been its Proprietaries: who it is probable extracted their Name out of 
Denmark,
 where the Name is yet spreading, and the Family noble and numerous. 
Stephen de Belk
 is mentioned in 
Testa de Nevill,
 a Book kept in the Exchequer, to have paid respective Aid for Land which he held in this Track, at the Marriage of 
Isabell
 Sister to 
Henry
 the third, in the twentieth year of that Prince's reign, which is enough to justifie the Antiquity of this Family in this Track.




Shepeards Forstall
 was for many Descents the possessionof a Family called 
Ruck,
 one of whom lies entombed at 
Rye,
 and was an eminent Person, in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, being Bow-bearer to that Prince, and bore for his Coat Armour, as it appears affixed to his Grave-stone, 
Sables a plain Crosse Argent between four Flower de Lis Or.
 The last of this Name which held this place, was 
Nicholas Rucks,
 who about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 dying without Issue, gave it to his Nephew Mr. 
Nicholas Oliver,
 who hath lately passed it away by Sale to the Colledge of 
Al∣soules
 in 
Oxford.


Lords
 is the last place of Account in 
Shelvich:
 in the reign of 
Edward
 the second, and 
Edward
 the third, it had Owners of that Sirname: but ever since the latter part of 
Richard
 the second, it hath constantly acknowledged the Family of 
Giles,
 until this present, to have been its successive proprietaries. One of this Family, called 
Alexander Giles,
 was Steward to the Abbot of 
Lesnes,
 in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, and I have seen a Release under his Hand and Seal, given to one 
John VValden
 of 
Erith,
 in the twenty fifth of the abovesaid Prince, for some Services due from that Person of the Covent abovesaid.


Sevington
 in the Hundreds of 
Chart
 and 
Longbridge,
 was, in Ages of as high as any Record can step to, the 
Barrie's,
 a Family of great Antiquity in this Track. Sir 
Robert de Barrie
 is in the Register of those, who were engaged in 
Ireland,
 under 
Henry
 the second, where he was the first, as Mr. 
Camden
 reports, which man'd and brought the Hawk to hand; and grew up to that Repute, as he was called by the 
Irish Barriemore,
 or the great 
Barrie. William de Barrie,
 this mans Successor, was one of the 
Recognitores Magnae Assisae,
 for this County, in the Time of King 
John,
 and lived at the 
Moat
 in this Parish, where many of his Successors, who were Lievtenants of 
Dover-castle,
 and Conservators of the Peace in 
Kent,
 had their Re∣sidence: the last of whom was 
Robert Barrie,
 whose Female Heir brought this Man∣nor to 
Radcliff,
 and he not many years since conveyed the 
Moat
 to 
Alcock,
 by whose Daughter and Heir it is now united to the Demeasne of 
Bois.


Sevenoke
 is like a Fountain which streams into several places of Note, which we cannot passe by without some Consideration. The first is 
Blackhall,
 which was the pos∣session of a Family called 
Totihurst:
 the first whom I find possest of it was 
William de Totihurst,
 and he flourished here, as appears by the ancient Court-rols, a great part of the reign of 
Edward
 the third, and 
Richard
 the second. The next whom I find by the same Evidences setled in the Inheritance, is 
Thomas Totihurst,
 and he held it in the reign of 
Henry
 the fifth, and 
Henry
 the sixth, and had Issue 
Robert Totihurst,
 who was, as appears by an Inscription upon his Tomb, Servant to Cardinal 
Bour∣chier,
 and died possest of this Mannor, in the year 1512. and transmitted it to his Son 
Thomas Totihurst
 Esquire, Justice of Peace of this County, who about the be∣ginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 alienated it to Sir ...... 
Boswell
 Grand-father to Sir 
Leonard Boswell,
 who dying without Issue, his Sister the Lady ...... 
Boswell,
 Widow of Sir 
William Boswell,
 as Heir General to her Brother, is now entered up∣on it.


Brabourne
 is the second place of Account. The first whom I find possest it, was 
Baldwin de Betun
 Earl of 
Albemarle. Falcatius de Brent,
 who so vigorously asser∣ted the Cause and Quarrel of King 
John
 against his Barons, and afterwards merited very much of his Son 
Henry
 the third, at the Battle of 
Lincolne,
 where a considera∣ble part of those Forces which 
Lewis
 the 
Dolphin
 of 
France
 had transported into 
En∣gland,
 to support the Confederacie of the Seditious Barons, was dissipated and dis∣comfited. But afterwards, all National Animosities being charmed into Slumber by a general Peace, he desiring still to improve the Flame of War since from that he expected both Heat and Light, seised on the Castle of 
Bedford,
 which was not wrung from him without the Expence of much Blood and Treasure: to expiate which Crime, his Estate here and else where, was in the fifth year of 
Henry
 the third, forfeited to the Crown, as being the Price of so great an Insolence: And then the abovesaid Monarch granted it wholly to 
Baldwin de Betun
 Earl of 
Albemarle:
 and 
Hawis
 his Daughter and Co-heir, brought it to her Husband 
William Mareschall
 Earl of 
Pembroke:
 but 
Gilbert Mareschall
 this mans Successor, dying without Issue,

Roger de Bigod
 Earl of 
Norfolk;
 in Right of 
Mawde
 his Mother, who was his Sister and Heir, entered upon it, and he, in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the first, gives it to 
Otho
 Lord 
Grandison.
 After this Family was worn out, I find by an ancient Court∣roll, one 
Walter de Pevenley
 or 
Pemley,
 possest of it, in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, and he it is possible erected the House, which in old Deeds is written 
Peven∣ley
 or 
Pemley-court.
 But, before the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, this Family was extinguished and gone, and then the 
Ashe's
 were the succeeding Proprietaries, a Fa∣mily which before were Lords of much Land in this Track, and in ancient Deeds were written 
de Fraxino,
 from their Habitation near some place planted with those Trees; and it is probable derived their Descent from 
Thomas de Esse,
 who was one of the 
Recognitores Magnae Assisae,
 in the fourth year of King 
John,
 as appears by the Pipe-rols of that Time: and certainly to this Name did a considerable part of the Fabrick of the House owe its first Original, as appears by the Coat in divers of the Windows, 
videlicet, Azure three Cheverons Argent.
 In fine, after this Seat and Mannor had for many years been resident in this Family, it was about the beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 alienated to Sir ...... 
Boswell,
 whose Grand-child dying without Issue, his Sister the Lady 
Margaret Boswell,
 is now become the Heir Ge∣neral of this place.


Rumpsted
 and in very old Evidences written 
Rumpshot,
 was the Inheritance of a Family, which was known by that Sirname. It is superfluous to inform the World how many, by old Deeds, are represented to have been possessors of this place, a∣mongst whom Sir 
William de Rumpsted
 is most eminent, who flourished here, in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, and, as the constant and successive Tradition of the Inha∣bitants of this Parish is, was Foster-father to 
William de Sevenoke,
 who was found a desolate and forlorn Orphan in the hollow Body of an Oake, and received both Reception and Education from the Charity and Benevolence of the above-mentioned Person: In whose Lineage the propriety of this place did not long after settle; for by an old Court-roll, I find it in the reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, in the Tenure of 
Ni∣sell:
 but this Family not long after determining in a Female Heir, she by matching with 
Bere,
 brought it to acknowledge it self to be of the Interest of this Family, but staid not long in the Name; for about the beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, it was made by purchase the possession of 
Peckham,
 from whom not many years after, by the same fatality it went away to 
Bedell. Nicholas Bedell,
 in the third and fourth of 
Philip
 and 
Mary,
 demised it to 
John Stacy
 of 
Hollenden,
 and 
John Stacy,
 in the fourth and fifth of 
Philip
 and 
Mary,
 conveyes it to 
Richard Lone,
 and his Successor Mr. 
Richard Lone
 hath very lately by Sale transmitted his Interest here to 
Thomas Lambert,
 formerly of 
West-Combe
 in 
Greenwich
 Esquire.


Knoll
 is the last place of Account in 
Sevenoke:
 It had, in Times of elder Inscription, the same Owners with 
Brabourne,
 and 
Seale,
 not far distant, as namely, 
Falcatius de brent, Baldwin de Betun
 Earl of 
Albemarle, William Mareschall
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 and 
Roger de Bigod
 Earl of 
Norfolk,
 who in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the first, granted it with 
Seale,
 and much other Land, which devolved to him in Right of 
Mawde
 his Mother, who was Sister and Heir to her Brother 
Gilbert le Mareschall
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 to 
Otho de Grandison,
 and in his Descendants did it continue until the beginning of 
Richard
 the second, and then it was conveyed by Sir 
Thomas Grandison
 to 
Geffrey de Say;
 yet I do not find that the possession of this place was entirely plan∣ted in 
Grandison,
 for an Inquisition taken after the Death of 
Reginald de Cobham,
 in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 62. 
Parte primâ,
 represents him to have had some share or concernment in it; yet how ever it were thus broken into parcels, the Inheritance of this Mannor, was wholly, after this, placed in 
Geffrey de Say,
 as appears by some Court-rols, which commence from the reign of 
Richard
 the se∣cond: but he determining in Daughters and Co-heirs, 
Joan
 one of them upon the Division of his Estate, brought this as an Addition to the Patrimony of her Husband Sir 
William Fiennes:
 and in this Family, when the possession had had a Respite, un∣til the reign of 
Edward
 the fourth, it was by Sir 
William Fiennes
 passed away by Sale to 
Thomas Bourchier
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 who added much of Pompe and Magnificence, by a new Supplement or Superstructure to the ancient Pile or Fabrick, and dying bequeathed it to the See of 
Canterbury,
 as a convenient Pallace for his

Successors: but when 
William Warham
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, saw that the Grandeur of this Mansion was looked upon both with an Eye of Emulation and Envy, by the Laity of those Times, he to allay that Murmure and Regret, in the twelfth year of the abovesaid Prince, exchanged it with the Crown: and here it rested, until 
Edward
 the sixth, in the second year of his reign, granted it to 
Edward Seymour
 Duke of 
Somerset,
 Protector of the Realm, in the Minority of that Prince. Who being convicted of Felony, in the fourth year of that King, it escheated back to the Crown: and then it was in that year, by a new Grant, setled on 
John Dudley
 Duke of 
Northumberland:
 but he being intoxi∣cated with the Fumes of Ambition, broke out into such treasonable and seditious practises, against the Right and Title of Queen 
Mary,
 that they could not be ex∣plated, but with the Losse of his Life, and Forfeiture of his Estate: and then this Seat upon his unsuccessful 
Exit,
 returning to the Crown, it was by the abovesaid Princess granted to her Cousin 
Reginald Poole
 Cardinal, for his Life, and a year after, as he should by Testament dispose. After his Death, it reverts again to the Crown, and then Queen 
Elizabeth,
 in the third year of her reign, grants it to 
Robert Dud∣ley
 Earl of 
Leiceister,
 and he the same year resigning it back into the Hands of his Soveraign, it was by Lease made over to 
John Lennard
 of 
Chevening
 Esquire: but the Fee-simple was by Royal Concession invested, in the seventh year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 in 
Thomas Sackvill
 Lord 
Buckhurst,
 and his Grand-child 
Richard Sack∣vill
 Earl of 
Dorset,
 almost in our Remembrance, conveyed the Fee-simple (reser∣ving it yet still in Lease to himself and his Heirs, paying such a Rent-charge, as is there specified, for ninety and nine years) to Mr. 
Richard Smith,
 vulgarly called 
Dog-Smith:
 who upon his Decease, not many years since, setled the propriety of it for ever upon St. 
Thomas
 Hospital in 
Southwarke.


The Honour of 
Sevenoke
 was granted by Queen 
Elizabeth,
 to her Kinsman 
Henry Carey
 Lord 
Hunsdon,
 in the first year of her reign, from whom it devolved to his Grand-child 
Henry Carey
 Earl of 
Dover:
 he passed it away by Sale to 
Richard Sackvill
 Earl of 
Dorset,
 who alienated his Interest in it to Mr. 
Richard Smith,
 who upon his above-mentioned Decease, gave it with 
Knoll,
 which both were exchanged, and so united to the Royal Demeasne by 
William Warham,
 to the Hospital of St. 
Thomas
 in 
Southwarke.


Kepington
 is the last place considerable in this Parish, which was wrapt up in that Demeasne, which owned the Signory of the Lords 
Cobham
 of 
Cobham,
 as appears by an Inquisition taken, in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 62. 
Parte secundâ,
 and after a Decursion of several Descents, came by the Heir Ge∣neral of this Family, to be possest by 
Brook,
 whose Descendant, about the begin∣ning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 conveyed it to 
Burges,
 and by his Sister and Heir it came over to 
Hanger,
 who alienated it to 
Cowper,
 and he not long since to Mr. 
Thomas Farnaby.


Spelherst
 in the Hundreds of 
Somerden, Codsheath,
 and 
Watchling stone,
 hath many places in it of Repute. First, 
Grome-bridge
 which is a Chappel of Ease belonging to 
Spel∣herst,
 and is dedicated to St. 
John:
 it is in old Registers written 
Gromen-bridge,
 and 
Gormen-bridge
 from some 
Saxon,
 who was anciently Owner of it, as 
Godmanchester
 in 
Huntingtonshire,
 upon the same Account, in old Orthography, bears the Name of 
Gormonchester,
 a 
Saxon
 having been possessor of it of that Denomination. This Mannor in elder Times confessed the Dominion and Title of the Noble Family of 
Cobham: Henry de Cobham,
 and 
Joan
 his Wife, obtained a Market to be observed weekly on the Thursday, and a Fair three Dayes yearly, 
videlicet,
 the 
Vigil,
 the Day of St. 
John Port-latine,
 and the Day after, as is manifest from an old Charter, which I have seen, whose Date commences from the fourteenth year of 
Edward
 the first, the Market and Fair were kept, where now the new Chappel is erected by the piety and expence of that Worthy Patriot 
John Packer
 Esquire, late one of the Clerks of the Privy Seal. After the 
Cobhams
 were departed from the possession of this place, the Lords 
Clinton
 became, by purchase, Proprietaries of it: and 
John de Clinton,
 who was often summoned to fit as Baron in Parliament, in the Time of 
Richard
 the second, died possest of it, in the twenty second year of that Prince,

Rot. Esc. Num.
 16. from whom the Title flowed in this Family, until the latter end of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then it was passed away to 
Waller
 of 
Lamberherst,
 where, and in 
Sussex
 they were before Masters of very ample Possessions; for 
Thomas Waller,
 and 
Katharine
 his Wife, granted to 
Thomas Waller
 of 
Lamberherst
 his Father, 
Richard Brenchley
 and 
John Brook,
 all his Lands, Messuages, and Tenements, in the Villa∣ges and Parishes of 
Rotherfeild, Witheham, Wadhurst; Lamberhurst, Little Horsted, Alfricheston,
 and 
Bucksted,
 together with the moiety of the Advouson of the Church of 
Little Horsted,
 as appears, 
Claus.
 11. 
Richardi secundi in Dorso Memb.
 35. 
Richard Waller
 Esquire, was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 the sixteenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and kept his Shrievalty at 
Grome-bridge,
 and was before Sheriff of 
Surrey
 and 
Sussex,
 in the twelfth year of that Prince. This is that renowned Souldier, that in the Time of 
Henry
 the fifth, took 
Charles
 Duke of 
Orleans,
 General of the 
French
 Army Prisoner at the Battle of 
Agin-court,
 brought him over into 
England,
 and held him in honora∣ble Restraint or Custody at 
Grome-bridge,
 which a Manuscript in the Heralds-Office notes to be twenty four years: in the Time of which his Recess, he newly erected the House at 
Grome-bridge
 upon the old Foundation, and was a Benefactor to the re∣pair of 
Spelherst
 Church, where his Arms remain in Stone-work over the Church∣porch: but, lest such a signal peece of Service might remain entombed in the Se∣pulchre of unthankful forgetfulness, the Prince to convey the Memory of this glo∣rious Action to Posterity, assigned to this 
Richard Waller,
 and his Heirs for ever, an additional Crest, 
videlicet,
 the 
Arms
 or 
Escocheon
 of 
France,
 hanging by a 
Labell
 on an 
Oake,
 with this 
Motto
 affixed, 
Hae Fructus Virtutis.
 This 
Richard
 was great Grand-father to 
William VValler
 of 
Grome-bridge
 Esquire, Sheriff of 
Kent,
 the twen∣ty second of 
Henry
 the eighth, and he was Father to Sir 
VValter VValler,
 who was Grand-father to Sir 
VVilliam VValler
 now possessor of 
Winchester-castle,
 and Father of Sir 
Thomas Waller:
 which Sir 
Thomas,
 almost in our Fathers Memory, passed away 
Grome-bridge
 to 
Thomas Sackville
 Earl of 
Donset,
 whose Grand-child 
Edward
 Earl of 
Dorset,
 not many years since conveyed it to 
John Packer
 Esquire, Father to ...... 
Packer
 Esquire, now possessor of this place.


There was a Chauntry founded at 
Grome-bridge,
 in the thirty eighth year of 
Henry
 the third, by 
VVilliam Russell,
 and 
Hawis
 his Wife, as appears by the first Book of Compositions 
in Registro Roffensi.


Hollands
 in this Parish next cals for a View: It was, in Ages of a very high Date, the Patrimony of a Noble Family of that Sirname, and are in the Chartularies of this Parish, recorded to have been great Benefactors to the Church of 
Spelherst,
 and were allied to 
Thomas Holland
 Earl of 
Kent,
 who matched with 
Joan
 Daughter of 
Edmund
 of 
VVoodstock:
 but, before the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, this Family was worn out, and vanished, and then the 
VVallers
 stepped into the possession, in which Family the Right of it did many years reside, until it was in our Fathers Memory alie∣nated to 
Thomas Sackville
 Earl of 
Dorset,
 from whose Successor it passed away by Sale to 
Lindsey,
 and from him, not many years since, the like Revolution carried it off to 
Caldicot.


Ferbies
 is another Seat of no vulgar Consideration in 
Spelherst,
 if we consider that it gave Sirname to a Family of important Account in this Track, who had their ancient Residence at this place, and sealed as high as 
Edward
 the third, with a 
Fesse Ermin between three Goats heads erased, in Labells affixed to their Deeds,
 which was the Paternal Coat-Armour of 
John de Fereby
 (for so is the Name written in ancient Muniments) who flourished, in the reign of 
Edward
 the second, and 
Edward
 the third. But this mans Posterity being desirous to transplant themselves to 
Pauls Crey,
 where they had before purchased Lands, called-
Hokinden
 of 
Dynley,
 about the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, conveyed that Estate they had here, about the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, to 
Waller
 of 
Grome-bridge,
 and continued for many years folded up in the Revenue of that Family, until very lately it varied its Possessor, being by pur∣chase made the Inheritance of Alderman 
Chiverton
 of 
London.


Rust-hall
 in this Parish, had likewise Proprietaries of that Sirname, one of which Family called 
John Rust,
 was Maior of 
Feversham,
 in the raign of 
Henry
 the sixth, and there lyes entombed, and about that Age. this Family surrendered their Concernment here by Sale to 
Waller,
 in which Name it resided, untill the forty second

year of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 and then it was conveyed by 
Richard Waller
 Esquire, to Mr. 
George Stacy;
 who not long after passed it away to 
Bing,
 in which Family the Possession is at this instant fixed.


Ewherst
 is the last place which must be mentioned, and indeed it is worth our Re∣cording, because this and 
Read
 in 
Marden,
 was the ancient Patrimony of 
Read,
 many Discents before. Sir 
Robert Read
 Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, in the reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, transplanted himself to 
Chiddingstone,
 by matching with the Coheir of 
Alphew,
 yet still remained Possessor of this place, which he transmit∣ted with 
Katharine
 one of his four Daughters and Coheirs, matched with Sir 
Thomas Willoughbie,
 and after the Title had been knit to this Family, by the Links of some Discents, it was by Sale not long since transferred to 
Knight.


Siberts-would
 vulgarly called 
Shepeards-well,
 lies in the Hundred of 
Bewsborough,
 and hath two places in it worth our Notice. The first is 
West-court,
 which was given (as the Records of 
Christ-church
 testifie) to 
Alfric
 the Abbot, by King 
Etheldred
 in the year 944, and conveyed not long after by 
Scotlandus
 the Abbot his Successor, to the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and hath been ever since as a Limbe or Branch of that See.


Upton-court
 is a second place of Repute. Several old datelesse Deeds discover to us, that it was in elder Times the Patrimony of a Family called 
Ʋpton:
 from whom it is probable, that the 
Ʋptons
 of 
Feversham,
 who for many years have flourished there under a fair Estimate of Antiquity, were originally descended: but before the end of 
Edward
 the third, this Family was crumbled away at this place, and then the 
Golds∣burghs
 or 
Goldsboroughs,
 were invested in the Possession, and remained Masters of this Seat, untill the Beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then this Name began to moulder away into Decay and Oblivion, and surrendred their Interest here by Sale to 
Guldford,
 in which Name it found an aboad, untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was conveyed to 
John Bois
 Esquire, Ancestor to 
John Bois
 of 
Fredvill
 Esq; now Lord and Proprietary of it.


Swink-field
 in the Hundred of 
Folkstone,
 was originally, and as high as any Evidence will leave us any Track or Print to walk by to a Discovery, the Possession of the noble Family of 
Crioll,
 who held here two little Manors called 
Bouington alias Bointon,
 and 
Northcourt,
 which were both given by 
Nicholas Keriell
 or 
Crioll,
 in the third year of 
Richard
 the second, to one 
John Phineux
 Esquire, for that Protection and Shelter, which he by a Magnanimous and vigorous Assistance supplied him with, even to the saving of his Life, at the Battle of 
Polcteirs,
 and being thus fastned to this Family, the Interest of both these places, continued intermingled with their Inheritance, untill they came, by successive Discent, to be possest by 
John Phineux
 Esquire, extracted from a Son by a second Wife of Sir 
Jo. Phineux
 the Judge, who determined in a Daugh∣ter and Heir, matched to Sir 
John Smith,
 who in her right was invested in the Proprie∣ty of both these places, from whom they are now come down to his Grandchild 
Philip Smith
 Viscount 
Strangford.


There was a Praeceptory here at 
Swingfield,
 which belonged to the Knights Hospital∣lers, of the Nature, Capacity, and Condition of which I have spoken before at 
Little-Peckham,
 which upon the Suppression of their Order here in 
England,
 was by 
Henry
 the eighth, in the thirty third of his reign, granted to Sir 
Anthony Aucher;
 who not long after passed it away to 
Palmer,
 descended from an ancient Family of that Sirname in 
Sussex,
 so that it is now the Inheritance of Sir 
Henry Palmer
 of 
Wing∣ham
 Baronet.


In the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
John Monins
 held Land here, and paid respective Aid for it, as the Book of 
Aid
 informs me, at making the Black Prince Knight. I should not have mentioned this Record, but to shew, that this noble and eminent Family, (I am bold to call them so, since the above-mentioned 
John Monins,
 is styled in the former Record, Esquire) can put in its claim to as high and illustrious Descent, as the most of the Families of this County can justly and primi∣tively entitle themselves to.




Snodland
 in the Hundred of 
Lark-field,
 was given to the Priory of St. 
Andrews
 in 
Rochester,
 by 
Egbert
 King of the 
West-Saxons,
 in the year 838, and is an Appendage to 
Halling,
 being setled by 
Henry
 the eighth, upon the Suppression of the former Covent, on the Dean and Chapiter of 
Rochester.


The 
Courtlodge
 by the Church, was, as high as I can by the Guide and Direction of Evidence trace out, the 
Palmers,
 who, as appears by very ancient Deeds, sealed with a 
Cheveron between three Palmers Scrips. William le Palmer,
 who was Owner both of this and 
Rye-huose
 in 
Otford,
 flourished here in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, and stood depicted in the Church-Window, with the above-recited Arms on his Tabard or Surcoat, untill some rude hand defaced the Signature. Another of this Name, lies entombed in 
Snodland
 Church, whose Epitaph alluding to his Name, is registred by 
Weaver,
 amongst his printed Monuments, of the Diocesse of 
Rochester;
 and after this Name was extinguished at this place, the 
Leeds's
 were the next Family, who by purchase entituled themselves to the Possession of it and I remember amongst some Church-notes of this County, collected by the eminent 
Robert Glover
 Esquire, there is mention of one 
Will. Leeds,
 who lyes enter'd in 
Snodland
 Church, with his Armes 
viz, A Fessee between three Eagles,
 affixed to his Graves-stone: but it seems the Date, Pourtraicture, and Coat, being insculped in Brasse, were by sacrilegious Handstorn off: for now there is no appearance of them, nor of this Family neither, who not ma∣ny years since, dispossessed themselves of their Interest in this place, and by Sale gave it up to 
Whitfield
 of 
Canterbury.


There is a second Seat in 
Snodland
 called 
Holoway-court,
 and in the Book of 
Aid,
 mention is of one 
Henry de Holoway
 that held it in elder Times, about the Begin∣ning of 
Henry
 the third: but upon a serious perusal of the evidences, and Muniments, which did relate to this Mansion, I found it, as high as they reached, that is, to the reign of 
Edward
 the third, to be the Inheritance of the 
Tilghmans:
 and seve∣ral very old Panes of Glasse are coloured with that Coat of Arms, which the 
Tilghmans
 are entered with, in the last Visitation of 
Kent,
 and in this Name was the Possession for many Descents permanent, till some forty years since, or more, it was by Sale conveyed to 
Clotworthy,
 extracted from the 
Clotworthies
 of 
Devon,
 who by Testamentary Donation, transmitted the Interest of it to his Sisters Son Mr. 
Thomas Williams.


Stone
 in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 was, when it flourished most, but a Chap∣pel of Ease to 
Tenham;
 but it is grown up to some Repute, since 
Simon de Lang∣ton,
 Arch-deacon of the Church of 
Canterbury,
 Brother to 
Stephen de Langton,
 the Arch-bishop, gave to the Monks of 
Christ-church
 in 
Canterbury,
 in the year 1227, 
omnes Decimas Majores & Minores, de Copton & Eylwarton, infra Limites Capellae de Stone.
 Now this 
Copton
 and 
Eylwarton
 were Mannors, anciently given to the Monks of 
Canterbury,
 by 
Edmund
 Son of Q. 
Edgiva, ad victum corum
 for the supply of Diet in the year of our Lord 980.


Wildemersh
 in this Village deserves a Remembrance; in that it was part of the Pa∣trimony of the ancient Family of 
Donett;
 for it was in the enjoyment of 
John Donett
 at his Death, which was in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third. But not long did it fixe there; for 
J
mes Donet
 his Successor, dyed without Issue-male, and left only a Daughter and Heir called 
Margery,
 who being married to 
Iohn St. Leger,
 this in her right went into the Possession of that Family; from whom the ordi∣nary Revolution of Sale, conveyed it to 
Richard Dryland,
 from which Name by the like Chanel, the Inheritance slowed into Sir 
Anthony Aucher,
 Predecessour to Sir 
Anthony Aucher
 of 
Bourne:
 and here for ought I yet can collect, is the Fee-simple of it setled.


Stone
 in the Hundred of 
Acstane,
 had formerly a Castle, which acknowledged the 
Northwoods
 for its founders, as their Arms insculped in the old Stone-work now dismantled did easily demonstrate. In the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Iohn de Northwood,
 paid respective Aid at making the Black Prince Knight, for his Mannor and Castle, and although it now lye wrapped up in its own Ruines, yet the Shell or Skeleton of it, within which Sir 
Richard Wiltshire
 laid the Foundation

of that Frabrick now extant represents to the eye some symptoms of its former strength and magnificence. From 
Northwood,
 it passed away by Sale to 
Butivant
 corruptly called 
Bonivant,
 and from this Family a Fatalitie like the former carried it down to 
Cholmley:
 from him by as quick a Current the Fee simple was transported to 
Chapman,
 whose Wi∣dow 
Elizabeth Chapman,
 being re-married to 
Jo. Preston,
 he in her Right as I find by some Court-rolls was possest of it; but her Son 
Thomas Chapman
 about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth concluded in 
Anne
 his Sole Heir who by matching with Mr. 
William Carew
 devolved the right on his Family; from whom, in right of that Alliance it is now descended to his Successor Mr. 
Henry Carew.


Littlebroke
 in this Parish did first own a Family of that Sirname, as is evident from ancient Dateless Deeds, wherein 
Laurence at Broke
 is re-presented to have been Possessor of it; but this Family before the end of 
Edward
 the third, had deserred the Possession, and transplanted it by Sale into 
Northword;
 and 
John Northwood
 about the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, passed it away to 
Roger Apylton;
 which 
Roger
 lies buried (as the Date on his Tomb informs us) in 
Crayford
 Church, in the year 1400. And from him does Sir 
Henry Apylton
 Knight and Baronet, not onely claim his Descent, but his Interest in this Mannor also.


The Mannor of 
Cotton
 is embraced within the Precincts of 
Stone
 likewise: It was, as high as any private or publick Record can conduct us on to a Discovery, the Possession of 
Killingworth
 of 
Hackstaple,
 at 
Sutton at Hone,
 and in this Family was the Title by a successive Derivation of several Descents preserved, until the entrance of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was conveyed by 
George Killingworth
 Esquire, to Sir 
Richard Wiltshire;
 from which Family not long after, the Propriety of this place was, by a Fate proportionate to this, planted in 
Apylton,
 Ancestor to Sir 
Henry Apylton
 Knight and Baronet, now Lord of the Fee.


Stoke
 in the Hundred of 
Hoo,
 was given to the Priory of St. 
Andrews
 in 
Rochester,
 by 
Eadbert
 K. of 
Kent,
 in the year 762. And upon the suppression being surrendred to the Crown, it was by 
Henry
 the eighth setled on his newly erected Dean and Cha∣piter of 
Rochester.
 But here are two places which are of secular Interest. The first is 
Malmains,
 which yielded both Seat and Sirname to a Family which fell under that Denomination; for I find 
John de Malmains
 Son of 
Henry
 died possest of it, in the tenth year of 
Edward
 the second, and in this Family it remained until the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, and then it was conveyed to 
Iden,
 a Family of generous Rank in elder Times about 
Rolvenden,
 and here it lay couched in the Demeasn of this Family until the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was passed away to 
Jo. Park,
 who dying without Issue Male, setled it on 
Elizabeth
 his Sole Heir matched to 
John Roper
 Esquire; from whom by paternal succession the Inheritance is come down to his Descendant 
Christopher Roper
 Baron of 
Tenham. Tuders
 is the second, which anciently confessed a Family of that Appellation to be its original Possessors, whose Name was in all probability primitively 
Theodore;
 for I have seen an ancient Roll of 
Kentish
 Arms, wherein 
Tuder
 of 
Stoke
 bears the same Coat with 
Owen Theodore
 vulgarly called 
Tuder, viz. Azure a Cheveron between three Helmets Argent:
 But to proceed: When this Family dislodged from this place, for want of Intelligence I con∣fess I know not, onely in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth I find it possest by 
Woodward,
 in which Family the Title remained invested until the entrance of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was conveyed to 
Wilkins,
 from whom by a quick Alienation it went away, and resigned up its Interest by Sale to 
Bright,
 and in the Revenue of his Descendant is the Proprietie of it yet wrapped up.


Stourmouth
 in the Hundred of 
Blengate,
 was a piece of that large Revenue, which owned the Signory of 
Hussey.
 In the fifty fifth year of 
Henry
 the third, 
Henry le Hussey
 obtained a Charter of Free-Warren, to his Mannor of 
Stourmouth,
 and his Grand∣child 
Henry le Hussey
 died possest of it in the sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, but, alass, neither the Nobleness of the Name, nor wideness of the Franchise, could keep this Family from departing from this place; for about the latter end of 
Henry
 the fourth, I find it in the Tenure of the eminent Family of 
Apulderfield;
 but setled not long here; for Sir 
William Apulderfield
 about the middle of 
Edward
 the fourth concluded

in 
Elizabeth Apulderfield,
 who was his Sole Daughter and Heir, who by matching with Sir 
Jo. Phineux
 Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, in the Reign of 
Henry
 the seventh made it his Demeasn: but the Title of this place did not long fix here; for, he dying without Issue Male, 
Jane
 his only Daughter, became his only Heir, who by espou∣sing of 
Jo. Roper
 Esq; of St. 
Dunstans
 in 
Canterbury,
 linked it to the Demeasn of this Fa∣mily; from whom in a continued Current of descent the Proprietie of it is now flowed down to 
William Roper,
 a Cadet or younger Branch of this Stem.


Shorne
 in the Hundred of 
Shamell,
 was, as high as the Reign of K. 
John,
 the Patrimony of the Noble Family of 
Nevil. Jordanus
 and in some old Deeds written 
Jollanus de Nevil
 held the Mannor of 
Shorne
 as appears by the Pipe-Roll of that year, and 
John de Nevil
 was his Son and Heir, who held this Mannor in the thirtieth year of 
Henry
 the third, but after him I can track no farther Mention of this Family at this place; for in the fifty fourth of 
Henry
 the third, as appears by the Pipe-roll of that year, I discover 
Roger de Norwood
 to be Lord of the Fee, this was that 
Roger de Norwood,
 who disdaining to have his Lands held in that Lazy and sluggish Tenure of Gavelkind, changed it into the more active one of Knights Service in the fourteenth year of 
Henry
 the third, still reserving to himself by that Licence by which he ob∣tained a Grant of the first, to reserve the ancient Rent whereby his Lands held even in the Time of the 
Conquerour:
 and he in the thirteenth year of 
Edward
 the first, died possest of this Mannor and all its Perquisites at 
Oisterland
 in 
Cliff
 and other places, and left it to his Son and Heir Sir 
John de Norwood,
 who together with his eldest Son Sir 
John de Norwood
 accompanied that triumphant Prince 
Edward
 the first in his Victorious Design undertaken against the Scots in the twenty eighth of his Reign. The Mannor of 
Shorn
 holding by this Tenure, 
viz.
 to carry a White Banner forty Dayes together at their own Charges, whensoever the King should commence a War in 
Scotland,
 as appears by an Inquisition taken after the Death of 
Roger de Norwood
 in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third; 
Rot. Esc. Num.

Parte secundâ.
 And this was customary not onely in 
England,
 but elsewhere; for Mr. 
Selden
 in his 
Titles of Honour
 observes out of 
Prelusius
's his Discourses upon the State of 
Poland,
 in the year 1530, 
Albert
 Marquess of 
Brandenburg
 and Mr. of the 
Teutonick
 or 
Dutch
 Or∣der in 
Prussia,
 receives his Investiture into that 
Dutchy, per Vexilli Traditionem,
 by the Delivery of a Banner from the Hands of 
Sigismund
 K. of 
Poland,
 and his Brother. 
George
 at his being enstated in that Signory by this Ceremony, was 
suo & Fratrum No∣mine Vexillum contingere,
 in his own, and the Name of his Brother, to place his Hands upon the Banner: and when the above-mentioned Banner was delivered to an Heir who had not his Title and Right free from the Claim of an ambiguous and perplexed Competition, he was onely admitted 
ad Contactum Extremitatum Vexilli ejusdem
 to touch the utmost or extream parts of this Banner. The Tenure which was annexed to this Investiture was this, to assist the K. of 
Poland
 with an hundred Horse, whenso∣ever he should personally advance into the Field against an enemie.


But to return: 
John de Norwood
 was the last of this Name whom I find setled in the Inheritance of 
Shorne
 and he enjoyed it at his Decease, which was in the second year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 35. But before the latter end of the Reign of that Prince, it was removed from the possession of 
Norwood,
 and by Sale plac'd in the Noble and ancient Family of 
Savage
 of 
Bobbing Court;
 but not long after Sir 
Arnold Savage
 determining in 
Eleanor
 his Sole Inheritrix, who was first wedded to Sir 
Reginald Cobham,
 by whom she had no Issue; and after to 
William Clifford
 Es∣quire, she by this Alliance united it to the patrimony of this last Family, and here it lay involved until the beginning of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was passed away by 
George Clifford
 to 
Nicholas Lewson
 Esquire, Grand-father to Sir 
Richard Lewson
 of the County of 
Stafford,
 who desiring to circumscribe and collect his scattered Interest which lay dispersed in several parcels in this County, into the closer circumference of 
Staffordshire;
 alienated this Mannor, almost in our Remembrance with all its Adjuncts, at 
Oisterland
 in 
Cliff
 and other perquisites and out-Skirts to Mr. 
Woodier
 of 
Rochester,
 in whose Lineage and Name the Title of it at this instant lies treasured up.




Ockington
 in this Parish was a Limb that made up the Body of that Revenue which anciently did swell into so vast a Bulk and Dimension in this Track, and acknowledged for proprietaries the Noble Family of 
Cobham,
 as appears by an Inquisition taken in the sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 45. where 
Stephen de Cobham
 was then found to have been possest of it at his Death; and from him was the Title in a suc∣cessive stream of Descent wasted down to the Reign of 
Hen.
 the seventh, and then it was by Sale transplanted into Sir 
Henry Wiat,
 where it flourished being supported with the Sap and Verdure of so Noble a Family, until the fourth year of 
Edward
 the sixth, and at that Time it was by Sale torn off from this Name, for then Sir 
Thomas Wiat
 alienated it to Sir 
Anthony St. Leger,
 and he passed it away to 
George Brooke
 Lord 
Cobham
 about the seventh year of 
Edward
 the si
, whose great Grand-child Sir 
William brooke
 Knight of the 
Bath,
 dying in the year 1643, without Issue Male it ce∣scended to Sir 
John Brooke
 restored to the Barony of 
Cobham
 by the last King in the year 1644, as being Reversioner in entail.


Roundal
 though now shrunk into neglected Ruines, was in elder Times the first Seat of the noble Family of 
Cobham,
 from whence upon its Decay they were trans∣planted to 
Cobham Hall,
 and was the Cradle of Men very eminent in their respective Generations of whom take this brief prospect.

 
Henry de Cobham
 is enrolled in the List of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen who were concerned with 
Richard
 the first at the Siege of 
Acon.

 Reginald de Cobham
 accompanied 
Henry
 the third in his expedition against the 
Welch
 in the forty second year of his Reign. Sir 
Henry,
 Sir 
Reginald,
 Sir 
Stephen,
 and Sir 
Henry de Cobham
 who lies buried here at 
Shorne,
 are in the Catalogue of those 
Kentish
 Knights, who supported the Cause and Quarrel of 
Edward
 the first, at the Siege of 
Carlaverock
 in 
Scotland,
 in the twenty eighth year of his Reign. 
Jo. de Cobham
 was frequently summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron, in the Reign of 
Edw.
 the third. 
Richard de Cobham
 was made Knight Banneret by 
Edward
 the third, for his exemplary Service performed against the 
Scots,
 as appears 
Pat. Edw. tertii Parte secunda Memb.
 22. This Mannor escheating to the Crown upon the Attainder of 
Henry
 Lord 
Cobham
 in the second year of K. 
James,
 it was by that Prince granted to 
Lodowick
 Duke of 
Lenox,
 who upon his Decease bequeathed it to his Nephew 
James
 Duke of 
Lenox,
 who being lately dead, 
Esme
 Duke of 
Lenox
 his onely Son is now heir apparent of it.


Stowting
 lies in a Hundred which borrows its Name from this place. In the reign of K. 
Iohn,
 sundry ancient Records which have an Aspect upon that Prince's Time inform us that 
Stephen de Haringod
 was Lord of this Mannor, and had the Grant of a Market to be held weekly at this place on the 
Tuesday,
 and a Fair to be observed yearly for the space of two dayes, 
viz.
 the Vigil and Day of Assumption of the Virgin 
Mary,
 as is manifest,

Joan. Num.
 43. and died possest of it in the forty first of 
Henry
 the third. But after this mans 
exit,
 I can track no more of this Stem or Stock, to have been proprietaries of it. The next Family which was successively entituled to the possession was the noble Family of 
Burghurst
 or 
Burwash,
 the first of which, whom by some old Deeds I discover to have held this place, was 
Bartholomew de Burwash,
 who received the Order of Knighthood by 
Edward
 the first; for his Noble and generous Assistance given to that Prince at the Seige of 
Carlaverock
 in the twenty eighth of his Reign, and he had Issue 
Stephen de Burwash,
 who obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Mannors 
Stowting, Sifleston, Ditton,
 and 
Burwash
 in 
Chiddington,
 in the first year of 
Edward
 the third, and died possest of this Mannor and Hundred in the third year of that Prince's Government, as appears, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 41. and from him did it descend to his Grand-child 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Burwash
 who in the forty third of the abovesaid Monarch conveyed this Mannor with much other Land to Sir 
Walter de Paveley
 Knight of the Garter, in which Family the possession was constant, but until the beginnning of 
Richard
 the second, and then it was passed away by Sale to 
Trivet;
 from whom the same Fatalitie about the fifteenth year of that Prince brought it over to Sir 
Lewis Clifford,
 and by Descent this devolving to his Successor 
Lewis Clifford,
 he in the twelfth year of 
Hen.
 the sixth, conveyed it by a Fine then levied to 
William Wenlock,
 who not long after alienated his Right in it to 
Richard beauchampe
 Baron of 
Aburgavenny,
 who had Issue 
Richard Beauchampe
 in whom the Male Line

determined, so that 
Elizabeth
 his onely Daughter and Heir being matched to 
Edward Nevill,
 brought this Mannor and the Barony of 
Aburgavenny
 to be united to that Family, and continued linked to the Demeasn of this Name, until it was by De∣scent brought down to 
Henry Nevill,
 Baron 
Aburgavenny,
 who about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, passed it away to Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 whose Daughter and Co∣heir 
Amy Moile
 united it to the Inheritance of her Husband Sir 
Thomas Kempe,
 whose Son Sir 
Thomas Kempe
 setled it on his Brother 
Reginald Kempe,
 and from him it de∣scended to his onely Son Mr. 
Thomas Kempe,
 who dying without Issue, it came to be shared by his two Sisters and Co heirs matched to 
Denny
 and 
Clerk,
 and they not many years since by mutual Concurrence and Assent, alienated their joynt Interest here to 
Jenkins
 of 
Aythorne.


Stockbery
 in the Hundred of 
Milton
 celebrates the Memory of the illustrious Family of 
Crioll,
 who lived here in Reputation amongst the eminent Gentry of this County, and in the Recital of their Possessions in this Parish, their Mansion was called a Castle, and divers of their old Deeds bore 
Teste
 at their Castle of 
Stockbery.
 Sir 
Ni∣cholas de Crioll
 was the first that brought this Family into Repute and Eminence; for he was one of those who accompanied 
Edward
 the first in the twenty eighth year of his Reign in his fortunate Attempt upon 
Scotland,
 when after a pertinacious Siege he reduced the Castle of 
Carlaverock,
 a piece in the repute of those Times, held almost inexpugnable; and for his signal Service in that Expedition, was created Knight Ban∣neret, and died possest of this place in the thirty first of 
Edward
 the first: and in this Name and Family did the Title of this place by an uninterrupted Current of De∣scent, stream down to Sir 
Thomas Crioll
 Knight of the Garter, eminent for several Services performed under the Scepter of 
Henry
 the sixth, who being infortunately beheaded at the second battle of St. 
Albans,
 whilst he endeavoured to support the Title of the House of 
York
 in the thirty eighth year of 
Henry
 the sixth determined in Daughters and Co-heirs, one of which was wedded to 
Edward Bourchier
 who cast this Mannor into his possession, and he in her Right died seised of it in the fourteenth year of 
Henry
 the seventh; but after this it was not long constant to the Interest of this Family; for in the twenty third year of the abovesaid Prince, 
Robert Tate
 died seised of it, by right of purchase. And in the Descendants of this Name was the Possession involved, by a long Series of years, until those Times which almost fell under our Cognizance, and then this Mannor was conveyed to Sir 
Edward Duke
 of 
Cosington
 in 
Alre sord;
 whose Lady Dowager, in Right of Joynture, hath now the enjoyment of it.


The Mannor of 
Gillested
 in this Parish, did formerly relate to the noble Family of 
Savage,
 and was wrapped up in those Lands to which 
John de Savage
 Grand-child to 
Rafe de Savage,
 who was with 
Richard
 the first at the Siege of 
Acon,
 obtained a Charter of Free-Warren in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first: and 
Arnold Savage
 Son of Sir 
Thomas Savage
 died possest of it in the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, and left it to his Son Sir 
Arnold Savage,
 whose Daughter and Heir 
Elizabeth Savage
 was first matched to 
Reginald Cobham,
 by whom she had no Issue, and after to 
William Clifford
 Esquire, second Brother to 
Robert Clifford,
 who was often Knight of the Shire in the Reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, whose Posterity in Right of this Alliance were possest of this place, until the latter end of 
Hen.
 the eighth, and then it was altenated to 
Knight,
 Ancestor to Mr. 
William Knight,
 upon whose Decease his sole Daughter and Heir Mrs. 
Frances Buck,
 Widow of Mr. 
Peter Buck
 of 
Rochester
 lately deceased, is now entred upon the Possession of it.


Cowsted
 is another place of Account in 
Stockbery:
 It was in Times of an elder In∣scription written 
Godsted,
 as giving Seat, and yielding a Sirname to a Family so called. 
William de Codested alias Godsted
 held it at his Death, which was in the twenty seventh year of 
Edward
 the first, and had Issue 
William de Codested,
 who was likewise in posses∣sion of it at his Death, which was in the Enjoyment of it in the ninteenth year of Issue 
Richard de Codested,
 who was in the Enjoyment of it in the ninteenth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 43. which was the time of his Decease: and from him it descended to 
John de Codested
 styled by the vulgar 
John de Cowsted,
 who bare for his Arms 
Gules three Leopards heads Argent,
 which was assumed by 
Higham,


who about the beginning of 
Richard
 the second, matched with the Sole Heir of this Family, and in this Name it remained, until the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was partly by Sale, partly by marching with a Daughter of this Family en∣stated upon 
Petit,
 in which Family the Title of this place was fixed and permanent, until those Times which came within the precincts of our Grandfathers Remem∣brance devolved it to 
O borne:
 but 
Edward O borne,
 not many years since, determining in 
Mary
 his Sole Heir, she by espousing of 
William Fagge,
 hath knit it to that Revenue, which now confesses his Descendants for proprietaries.


Stodmersh
 in the Hundred of 
Downhamford,
 was innobled anciently, by being parcel of the Revenue of the 
Saxon
 Kings of 
Kent,
 and rested in their Demeasne until 
Lotharius,
 one of the 
Kentish
 Kings, made 
Godd
 his Heir, and as 
Thorne
 re∣cords in his Annals, setled it on the Abby of St. 
Augustins,
 and remained succes∣sively interwoven with the Patrimony of that Convent, until the publick Suppression, in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, rent it away: and then that Prince, in the thirty seventh year of his reign, granted it to 
John Masters,
 and he upon his Decease set∣led it on his Son Mr. 
Thomas Masters,
 and he dying without Issue-male, left it to his Daughter and Co-heir 
Elizabeth Masters,
 who by matching with Mr. 
William Courthop
 knit the propriety of it to his Inneritance, and he had Issue Mr. 
Thomas Courthop,
 who, in Right of this Alliance, is now entituled to the instant possession of it.


Stroude
 in the Hundred of 
Shamell,
 was granted in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the third, by the same Prince, 
Magistro & Fratribus Militiae Templi Solomonis,
 that is, to the Knights Temples, who had here an eminent Mansion, which from its being of their possession, hath ever since acquired the Name of the Mannor of 
Tem∣ple.
 After the suppression of this rich and magnificent Order, in the second year of 
Edward
 the second, upon what pretences, and colourable Insinuations, I have dis∣covered in my Description of 
Temple Ewell,
 this Mannor was united to the Crown. And though a principal part of the Lands, which related to this Order in this Coun∣ty, before their Dissolution, was by that Act of Parliament, called, 
Statutum de Terris Templariorum,
 setled on the Knights Hospilaters; yet this was lodged in the Royal Revenue, until the twelfth year of 
Edward
 the third, and then he conferred it by Grant on 
Mary
 Countess of 
Pembroke,
 who about six years after bestowed it on the Abbess and Sisters Minorites of the profession of St. 
Clare,
 at the Abby of 
Denney
 in 
Cambridgeshire,
 to which place she had removed them from 
Waterbeach,
 where they were first planted by her. And here did this Mannor reside, until ano∣ther Tempest, more fatal and ruinous then the former, arose in the reign of 
Henry
 the eight, which like a Whirl-winde ravished it away from the Revenue of the Church, and then that Monarch in the thirty second year of his reign, made it the propriety of 
Edward Elrington
 Esquire. But it seems the Title of Church-Land is stuck so thick with the Curses of the first Donors, that it becomes like a Moath re∣ceived into a Garment, which like an ingrateful Guest, commonly destroyes the House which entertained it, and so it was here; for, in the same year it was granted, the abovesaid Person alienated it to 
George Brook
 Lord 
Cobham,
 whose infortunate Grandchild 
Henry
 Lord 
Cobham,
 was enwrapped in that obscure and mysterious De∣sign of Sir 
Walter Rawleigh,
 which was muffled up in such a complicated Veile of that magical Mist called Reason of State, and other Intrigues of wrested policy, that it remains dark and perplexed, until this Day; indeed the Crimes of this un∣happy Gentleman, were by the mercenary Tongues of some Lawyers, who were in pension to the Interest of those, who then steared the Helm of State, and who like some Trumpeters, knew how to sell their Breath to the best advantage, aggra∣vated and multiplied to that Bulk and Dimension, that he was convicted of high Treason, in the beginning of King 
James,
 and though he lost not his Life, he did that of his Estate, here at 
Stroude,
 which was by the abovesaid Prince conferred by Grant on 
Robert Cecill
 Earl of 
Salisbury,
 principal Secretary of Estate, in Respect he had matched with 
Elizabeth Brook,
 Sister to this infortunate Lord, from whom it descended to his Son, the Right Honorable 
William Cecill,
 Captain of the Band

of Pensioners to his late Majesty, and Earl of 
Salisbury,
 who in our Fathers Memo∣ry, passed it away to Mr. 
Bernard Hide
 Esquire, one of the Commissioners of the Custome-houes, to the late King 
Charles,
 and he upon his Decease gave it to his third Son Mr. 
John Hide,
 who not many years since alienated it to 
James
 Duke of 
Lenox,
 from whom after some brief possession, it was conveyed to Mr. 
Blague,
 whose Son Mr. 
Izaack Blague
 by Descendant Right is now entituled to the Propriety of it.


The Chappel of St. 
Nicholas
 in 
Stroud,
 was by 
Gilbert Glanvill
 Bishop of 
Rochester,
 with the Consent of the Prior of 
Rochestor, William
 Arch-deacon of the same See, and likewise of the Parish Priest of 
Frendsbury
 (within the Precincts of whose Vil∣lage, Church, and Congregation, it was in elder Times circumscribed) erected, and improved into a Mother-church, and that for these two Reasons. First, it was divided by too great Distance from the Church of 
Frendsbury:
 And secondly, the Inhabitants began to multiply to that Number, that it was probable that in Decur∣sion of Time, the above recited Church would be in no Capacity for the Reception of so great a Conflux: and therefore it was judged convenient by the Authority of that Age, to establish 
Stroud
 into a Parish, independent to 
Frendsbury,
 and assign to it not only a Church-yard, for the Sepulture of their Dead, but likewise a Com∣petency of Tiths (
exceptâ solummodo Decimatione Bladi,
 that is, I conjecture, the Tithery of Grasse only excepted) for the Support of the Incumbent for the Time being, as the Records of the Church of 
Rochester
 inform us.


Shorham
 in the Hundred of 
Cods-heath,
 hath several places within the Verge of it, which may deserve our Notice. The first is 
Preston,
 which was the Seat of an emi∣nent Family, called 
Buckland,
 who bore for their Cognisance 
Argent an Eagle Sa∣bles beaked and ungued, Or. Alan de Buckland,
 was a noted Person in the Time of King 
John,
 and being Lievtenant of 
Dover-castle,
 that Prince directs a Command to him, and 
William de Brewer,
 who was joyned in Commission with him, to surrender 
Dover-castle
 to 
Hubert de Burgh
 for his Service. Sir 
Thomas de Buck∣land
 of this place had 
Buckland
 in 
Maidstone,
 and 
Buckland
 likewise in 
Ludsdown,
 and flourished in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, and in several Deeds, to which he was witness, subscribes himself 
Miles.
 In brief, after this Family had continued pos∣sessors of this Mansion, until the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, it devolved to 
Thomas Buckland,
 who dying without Issue-male, 
Alice
 his only Daughter and Heir, by matching with 
Thomas Polhill
 of 
Polhill-street
 in 
Detling,
 cast it into the Inheritance of that Family, from whom it came down to Mr. ...... 
Polhill,
 who being not many years since deceased, his Widow Mrs. ...... 
Polhill,
 is now in the enjoy∣ment of it.


Palstres alias Planars
 and 
Sepham,
 are two ancient Seats, likewise situated within the Confines of 
Shoreham,
 and had both Owners of that Sirname. 
William de Pla∣nar,
 as appears by Deeds without Date held the first, and so did 
John de Planar,
 in the reign of 
Edward
 the first, and died possest of it, in the forty seventh year of that Prince's reign, and in this Family did it continue, until the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was conveyed to 
Sepham
 of 
Sepham,
 an eminent Family in this Parish, who bore for their Coat-Armour, 
Argent three Cinque Foils pierced Sables,
 and were descended from 
William de Sepham,
 who died possest of this place, in the fifteen year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 12. and having continued Lords of both these Mannors, of one by Descent, and of the other by purchase, until the lat∣ter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, Mr. 
John Sepham,
 who had in the fifth year of that Prince, made an acknowledgment for them to the then Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 of whom it seems they both held, passed away 
Sepham
 to 
William Martin,
 and 
Palstres
 to 
Cobbe,
 in which Families after they had remained, until the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, they were both demised to Mr. 
Francis Sandbach,
 by whose Sole Heir 
Alice Sandbach,
 they came to be the possession of 
David Polhill,
 Ancestor to Mr. 
David Polhill,
 who upon the late Death of his Grand-father Mr. 
David Polhill
 is invested in the Tenure of them.


Vielston
 now by vulgar Acceptation of the Name, called 
Vilson,
 is another Seat of eminent Account in 
Shoreham.
 It primitively gave Seat and Sirname to a Fami∣ly

which radically was as deeply planted in Antiquity, as any Family which then flou∣rished on this part of the County, some of the old Evidences, now in the Hands of my Cozen Mr. 
Thomas Petley,
 reach as high as the Government of the reign of 
Henry
 the third, and then 
Hamon de Vielston,
 demises several parcels of Land to 
Sepham
 of 
Sep∣ham, Timberden
 of 
Timberden Farm
 in this Parish likewise, and several others of obscu∣rer Account, whose names are too tedious to recite, by Deeds not circumscribed with any Date, which argues him to be a Man in that Age illustrious, both for Descent and Demeasn. In Times which approached neerer to ours, 
John de Vielston,
 who paid respective Aid at making the Black Prince Knight, for his Mannor of 
Vielston,
 was eminent and was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nine∣teenth, and twentieth years of 
Edward
 the third; and he left Issue 
John Vielston,
 who deceasing without Issue, 
John Ross
 his Sisters Son, about the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, became his Heir, and he had Issue 
John Ross,
 who dyed about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, without any Posterity, so that he bequeathed it to his Kins∣man 
John Berd;
 who in the fourteenth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, sold it to 
John Pal∣mer;
 from whom it went away by Sale in the eighteenth year of the above-mentioned Prince, to 
Richard Page,
 where it made its aboad, till the nineteenth year of 
H.
 the se∣venth; and then 
Edmund Page
 this Mans Son, cast it by Sale into the Inheritance of 
Richard Wood,
 who in the fourth yeer of 
Henry
 the Eighth, alienates the Fee-simple to 
Robert Blague,
 and he in the sixth yeer of that Prince demises it to 
William Petley
 of 
Halsted,
 and he upon his decease bequeaths it to his second Son Mr. 
Thomas Petley,
 from whom in a direct Line is my Cosin Mr. 
Thomas Petley
 descended, in whom (by original derivation from him) the Interess and Right of this ancient Seat is at this instant invested.


The Castle of 
Shorham,
 was, if not built by, yet certainly very anciently in the Possession of the Family of 
Aldham,
 of 
Aldham St. Cleres
 in 
Kemsing,
 one of which Name was Castellan of this place, in the eighth year of 
Henry
 the third, and was Ancestor to Sir 
Thomas de Aldham,
 who flourished in the reign of 
Edward
 the second, and 
Edward
 the third, in whom the Male-line ended, so that his three Daughters matched to 
Francis St. Clere, Martin de Peckham,
 and 
John de Novoburgo
 or 
Newborough
 of 
Newborough
 in the County of 
Dorset,
 became his Coheirs, and this Castle upon the Distinction of his Estate into parcels, was annexed to the Demeasn of 
Newbo∣rough;
 in which Family, after the Title had as in a constant Chanel flowed untill the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, it was diverted by Sale into 
Polhill,
 in which Family and Name, the Propriety hath ever since, untill this instant, been fixed and per∣manent.


Southfleet
 in the Hundred of 
Axstone,
 did belong to the Priory of St. 
Andrews
 in 
Rochester,
 and was given to that Covent by 
Hamo de Heath,
 in the year of our Lord 1346, which was not long before his Decease, and I find by an old Manuscript which represents to us the Liberties and Franchises which were setled upon this Cloister, that the Prior had by Prescription a Charter of Free-warren, to his Mannor of 
Southsleer:
 yet though it were fortified with this Priviledge,

 it could not be secure from that Tempest which arose in the reign of 
Heury
 the eighth; which like a Whirlwind ravished it a∣way from the Patrimony of the Church, and lodged it in the Revenue of the Crown, where it dwelt untill the thirty seventh year of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 and then it was by Concession from that Princesse, passed away to 
William Peter
 of 
Writtle
 Esquire, who was Son to Sir 
William Peter,
 Secretary of Estate to King 
Edward
 the sixth, Q. 
Mary,
 and Q. 
Elizabeth;
 and he immediately after alienated it to Alderman 
Garret
 of 
London,
 whose Successor in our Fathers Remembrance, conveyed it by Sale to Sir 
William Sid∣ley
 of 
Scadbery,
 from whom it is now come down by a Chain of Descent to his Grand-child Sir 
Charles Sydley
 Baronet, the present Lord of the Fee.


Pole
 vulgarly called 
Poole,
 is another Mannor in 
Southfleet,
 And was in elder Times the Inheritance of a Family called 
Berese,
 for I find by a fine levyed in the thirty seventh year of 
Henry
 the third, that 
Richard de Berese,
 fells this Mannor under the Notion of a Carucate of Land to 
Reginald de Cobham
 of 
Roundall
 in 
Shorne;
 and from him did it by a continued Thread of Succession, devolve to 
John Cobham
 Esquire, in whom the Male-line of that Name ended, and he dyed seised of it in the ninth year of

Henry
 the fourth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 10. And lett it to 
Joan
 his Sole Inheritrix, who, by 
Reginald Braybrook
 her third and last Husband, had Issue 
Joan
 her only Daughter and Heir, who brought this Mannor and a liberal Revenue besides, to her Husband 
Thomas Brook
 of the County of 
Somerset
 Esquire, Grand-father to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Brook,
 who about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, passed it away to Sir 
Henry Wiat,
 one of the Privy Councel to that Monarch; from whom it descended to his noble but infor∣tunate Grandchild Sir 
Tho. Wiat;
 who in the second year of Q. 
Mary,
 forfeited this and his Life together; so that from thenceforth, it was clasped up in the Income of the Crown, untill Queen 
Elizabeth,
 in the twenty fifth year of her reign, restored it to his Widow the Lady 
Joan Wiatt,
 and 
George Wiat
 Esquire his Son and Heir, father to Sir 
Francis Wiat,
 who upon his Decease, left it to his Widow Dowager the Lady ..... 
Wiatt,
 who is now in possession of it.


Scadbery
 in 
Southfleet
 hath been for some Centuries of years, the possession of the Family of 
Sidleys,
 who were in Times of very high Ascent, seated in 
Romney Mersh;
 for there are some Lands there, which at this Day they call by the Name of 
Sidleys,
 and 
Sidleys Mersh.
 In this Mansion there is a Room, whose sides are covered with Wain∣scot, and on one of the Plates or Pains, which appears to be exceeding ancient, the Arms of 
Sidley
 are carved in embost-work, 
viz, A Fesse wavee between three Goats heads erased,
 and these Letters underneath, 
W.
 and 
S.
 with the year of our Lord affixed in Figures, whose Date commences from 1337. And although the Structure of this House, hath like a Snail shifted its ancient Shell, yet in all its Mutations, and Vicissi∣tudes, which must certainly have very much disordered the Fabrick, when it was cast into a new mould and frame, and ravelled and discomposed the Materials: yet this Panel of Wainscot, hath been, like a Relique, religiously preserved, to justifie not only the Antiquity of this Seat, but of the Family of 
Sydley
 also, which is presumed to have been resident at this place, before the above-mentioned Calculation: from whom Sir 
Charles Sidley
 Baronet, claims the Original of his Title to this Mansion, and his Extraction or pedigree likewise, untwisted, into many Descents, and now at last wound up in him.


Shouldon
 in the Hundred of 
Deal,
 hath two remarkable places which are situated within the Limits of it. First, 
Hull
 presents it self to our View, it was formerly un∣der the Signory of the illustrious-Family of 
Ratling
 or 
Retling
 in 
Nonington. Thomas de Retling
 paid respective Aid for this, and divers other Lands of ancient Inhe∣ritance in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight, and left it to his Son Sir 
Richard de Retling,
 whose Widow the Lady 
Sarah Retling,
 and afterwards Wife of 
John de St. Laurence,
 died possest of it in the tenth year of 
Richard
 the second, and left it to 
John Spicer
 who had married 
Joan
 Daughter and Heir to her first Husband: but he concluding in a Daughter and Heir, by this his first Wife called 
Cicely,
 who was Heir to her mother 
Joan Spicer,
 shee by matching with 
Iohn Isaack,
 knit it to the Propriety of that Family. But before the twenty first of 
Henry
 the sixth, he had fixed the Inheritance in 
Iohn Bresland,
 in whom it was not long resident; for he suddenly after altered his right, and about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the fourth, put it over by Sale to 
Phineux
 of 
Swink-field,
 whose Successor 
Ro∣bert Phineux,
 by as quick and early a Vicissitude, placed the possession about the Be∣ginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, in 
George Monins
 Esquire; whose Successor in that Age which was circumscribed within the Pale of our Fathers Remembrance, passed it away to 
Crayford
 of 
Great Mongeham.


Secondly, 
Cotmanton
 puts in its Claim for some memorial likewise, even in this respect, that it was the Demeasne of the noble Family of 
Crioll
 or 
Keriell,
 who were of some considerable Repute in this Track, as appearsby by the Book styled 
Testa de Ne∣vill
 kept in the Exchequer, where they are represented in the twentieth year of 
Henry
 the third, to have held Land in this Skirt of the County, and in Ages of a modern Aspect, that is, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, I find 
Iohn de Criol,
 gave a pecuniary supply at the making the Black Prince Knight: but before the end of 
Edward
 the third, he was departed from the possession of this place, which by Sale was resigned up to 
Roger Digge,
 and he dyed in the possession of it in the third year of 
Ric.
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num
 19. And in this Family it continued, untill the reign of

Henry
 the seventh, and then it was alienated to 
Barton,
 descended from the ancient Family of 
Barton,
 of 
Barton-hall,
 in the County of 
Lancaster;
 from whom the like Mutation about the latter end of 
H.
 the eighth carried it off, to the Family of 
Brown;
 and from them it passed away by Sale into the Possession of 
Richardson,
 upon whose go∣ing out, the Family of 
Smith,
 by a Devolution like the former, not many years since, stept into the Inheritance of it.


Sundrich
 in the Hundred of 
Codsheath,
 was the Possession (as high as any Light, collected from Antiquity, can waft us to a Discovery) of an Ancient Family called in Latine-Records 
de Insula,
 and in English 
Isley. Iohn de Insula,
 obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at 
Sundrich,
 in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the second, and he had Issue 
Iohn Isley,
 who married 
Joan,
 Daughter to Sir 
Ralph de Fremingham,
 and by her had Issue 
Roger Isley
 Esquire, who in Right of his mother, be∣came Heir to his Uncle 
Iohn Fremingham
 Esquire, who deceased without Issue, in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and this 
Roger Isley,
 had Issue 
William Isley
 Esquire, who was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the twenty fifth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and he had Issue 
John Isley
 Esquire, who was Justice of the Peace, and Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the fourteenth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, and deceased in the year 1484, as appears by an Inscription affixed to his Monument, yet extant (notwithstanding the late general Shipwrack of the Remains of Antiquity) in 
Sundrich-church,
 and he had Issue 
Thomas Isley
 Esquire, Father of Sir 
Henry Isley,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the thir∣ty fourth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and again in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the sixth: but being unhappily entangled, in the dysastrous Attempt of Sir 
Thomas Wiat,
 was upon the frustrating of that Designe and the Dissipation, and Discomfiture of those Forces who were to support it; in the second year of Queen 
Mary,
 convicted and attainted of high Treason, and executed at 
Sevenoke;
 upon whose Tragedy this Mannor with all its Appendages escheated to the Crown: but was the same year restored to his Son 
William Isley
 Esquire, who was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 part of the seventh year of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 after whose decease, the Title of this place, which had so many Centuries of years like an Inmate dwelt in this Name and Family, ebbed a∣way to another Proprietary; for in our Fathers Memory it was alienated by Sale to 
Brooker,
 who not many years since, passed it away to Mr. 
John Hide,
 second Son to Mr. 
Bernard Hide,
 one of the Commissioners of the Custome-house to his late Majestie.


Brook-place
 in 
Sundrich,
 so called from its contiguous Situation neer some Drill of Water, did acknowledge for many discents, the Signory of 
Isley,
 the last of whom who dyed possest of it, was 
William Isley
 Esquire, who held it at his Decease, which was in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 34. After whose 
Exit,
 it came to 
John Isley
 Esquire, who not long after, passed it away to 
John Alphew,
 and he determinig in two Daughters and Coheirs, one of them by matching with Sir 
Ro∣bert Read
 Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, in the reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, linked it to his Patrimony: but he likewise went out in four Daughters and Coheirs, 
Katharine
 one of which, was matched to Sir 
Thomas Willoughbie,
 Lord Chief Justice likewise, of the Common Pleas, and so he in her right was possest of this place; from whom it came down to his Successor, 
Thomas Willoughbie
 Esquire, who about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 conveyed it by Sale, to Mr. 
Hoskins
 of 
Oxted
 in 
Surrey,
 descended from an ancient Family of that Name in 
Hereford-shire,
 whose Successor Mr. 
Charles Hoskins,
 being lately deceased, the Fee-simple rests now in his Son and Heir.


Hethenden
 or 
Henden
 is another Mannor in 
Sundrich,
 which was folded up in the De∣measn of the powerful and illustrious Family of the 
Clares,
 who were Earls of 
Gloucester
 and Lords of 
Tunbridge
 by whose Heir general it devolved to 
Audley:
 and this Family by the same Fatality, languishing into a Female Inheritrix, she by matching with 
Stafford,
 cast this Mannor into his Revenue, and in this Name was the Propriety resi∣dent, untill, 
Edward Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 was infortunately attainted, in the thirteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, it was by escheat, annexed to the Demeasn of the Crown, and made its aboad there, untill King 
Henry
 the eighth, in the thirty fifth year of his reign, granted it to Sir 
John Gresham,
 and he dyed possest of it, in the first

year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 after whose Decease it remained constant to the Interess of this Family, until the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was alienated to Sir 
Thomas Hoskins
 of 
Oxsted
 in 
Surrey,
 in the Descendants of which Family the Signory and Propriety is at this instant remaining.


The 
Roman Fosse
 or Way which extended or stretched out it self from 
Oldborough
 in 
Igtham
 to 
Baston
 in 
Heys,
 and afterwards to 
Woodcot
 in 
Surrey,
 did cut thorough this Parish; for not many years since, in digging near 
Come-banke,
 a Seat so called, which did formerly relate to the 
Isleys,
 and is situated in 
Sundrich,
 were discovered many 
Roman
 Urns of an antick Shape and Figure, from whence we may probably collect thus much, that there was formerly erected some Fortresse, at or near 
Combe-banke
 (its Situation being fitted for such a Design) by the Roman Generals, to secure their forces in their March to 
Noviomagum
 or 
Woodcot,
 against any Impression or Eruption of the 
Britons.


Sturrey
 in the Hundred of 
Blengate,
 was a Mannor by a Prescription of many Ge∣nerations wrapt up in the Patrimony of 
Apulderfeild,
 a Family whom we shall have occasion often to mention thoroughout the Body of this Survey, and here it conti∣nued till this Name met with its Tomb in a Daughter and Heir, known by the Name of 
Elizabeth,
 who was wedded to Sir 
John Phineux:
 and although he likewise con∣cluded in a Female Heir, matched to 
John Roper
 Esquire, who drew along with her a great portion of the Estate, yet this still remained fixt in this Name and Fami∣ly, even till our Fathers Memory; and then 
John Phineux
 Esquire died, and left this, and other vast possessions to his Daughter and Sole Heir 
Elizabeth Phineux,
 who brought them over to her Husband Sir 
John Smith,
 eldest Son of Sir 
Thomas Smith,
 and Grand-father to 
Philip Smith
 Viscount 
Strangford,
 who by Right planted in him by so worthy a Predecessor, does entitle himself to the Interess and possession of it.


Mayton
 in this Parish, though now of no great Importance, yet formerly gave both Seat and Sirname to a Family that passed under that Appellation, from whom by Sale the Inheritance was transplanted into 
Diggs,
 where for some Descents, without any Interval it made its abode, till it was by 
Leonard Diggs
 Grand-father to Sir 
Dudley Diggs,
 sold to 
Goodhugh,
 by whose Daughter and Heir it became the Demeasne of 
Baggs,
 which Name likewise going out here into a Daughter and Heir, she by matching not long since to 
Farmer,
 has made it to own him for its in∣stant proprietary.


Sutton
 by 
Walmer
 lies in the Hundred of 
Cornilo,
 and was the Inheritance of a good old Family, called 
Stroude.
 Peradventure it assumed its Denomination from the Shore not far distant, and was sometimes, in the 
Saxon
 Denomination, cal∣led 
Strond,
 and as often 
Stroude; John de Stroude
 held it, as the Book of 
Aide
 denotes, in the reign of 
Edward
 the first, and when this Family was worn out, the next who were invested in the possession, were the 
Criols,
 and 
Nicholas Criol
 or 
Ke∣riel,
 held it at his death, which was in the third year of 
Richard
 the second, whose Grand-child Sir 
Thomas Keriel
 being an active Champion of the Cause and Quarrel of 
Edward
 the fourth, against the House of 
Lancaster,
 was slain in the second Battle of St. 
Albans,
 where the Title of both Parties was put to the bloody decision of a Field, who leaving only two Daughters and Co-heirs, one matching with 
John Fogge
 Esquire, incorporated this into his Revenue, from whom by purchase, the Right was setled in 
Whitlock,
 where it tarried not long, but was by the like devolution trans∣planted into 
Maycot,
 from which Name the same Fate of Sale carried it into the possession of 
Stokes,
 who in our memory by the like alienation, transmitted his In∣teress here to 
Meryweather.


Sutton,
 commonly called 
East-Sutton,
 lies in the Hundted of 
Eyhorne,
 and was formerly the 
Braybrookes; Henry de Braybrooke,
 one of the Lord Wardens of the Cinque Ports, had Lands here; and in this Track (as the Book of 
Aide,
 and the Book called 
Feoda Militum,
 in the Exchequer, do both inform us) his Son was 
Gerard Braybrooke,
 and his Grand-child was 
Reginald Braybrooke,
 whose Heir 
Joan

Braybrooke
 married to 
Thomas Brooke
 of the County of 
Somerset:
 but whether this 
Reginald Braybrooke
 gave this Mannor to pious Uses, or not, and principally to the Abby of 
Leeds
 adjacent, I cannot positively determine, upon the Suppression it was granted (as being parcel of the Demeasne of the Convent of 
Leeds
) by 
Henry
 the eighth, in the thirty seventh year of his reign to 
John Tufton
 Esquire, who pas∣sed it away by Sale to Mr. 
Richard Argall,
 whose Heir 
Elizabeth Argall,
 being mar∣ried to 
Edward Filmer
 Esquire, made it the possession of that Family, and by a com∣municative Right from him, does his Grand-child Sir 
Edward Filmer,
 Son to Sir 
Robert Filmer
 lately deceased, now hold the possession and propriety of it.


Sutton Valence,
 and 
Chart
 by 
Sutton,
 both lie in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne:
 the last of which contracted the Appellation, from formerly owning 
William de Valence
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 to be Lord of the Fee, who certainly instituted that Castle, that now even in its Reliques and Fragments with much of venerable Magnificence overlooks the Plain: And when 
Aymer de Valence
 his Son concluded in a Female Heir 
Isabell,
 she was wedded to 
Lawrence
 Lord 
Hastings,
 who in relation to her became not only Earl of 
Pembroke,
 but Lord of 
Sutton-Valence
 also, and from him did it des∣cend to his Grand-child 
John Hastings
 Earl of 
Fembroke,
 the last Earl there of that Name, who transmitted his Title of that place to 
Reginald Grey,
 and 
Richard Talbot,
 who flourished here about the reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, and they had this Man∣nor by Testamentary Donation, in the fourteenth year of 
Richard
 the second. In the next Age subsequent to this, I find the 
Cliffords
 of 
Bobbing-court,
 to be the Pro∣prietaries, and to this Family was the Inheritance in a constant Union fastned, till 
Nicholas Clifford
 Esquire, deceased without Issue-male, and left only one Daugh∣ter and Heir, called 
Mildred,
 who was first married to 
Harper;
 secondly, to 
More;
 thirdly, to 
Warren;
 and lastly, to 
Blount:
 but she had only Issue by 
Har∣per
 and 
More;
 for in her Right 
Edward
 Lord 
More
 of 
Mellifont
 in 
Ireland,
 and Sir 
Edward Harper
 divided the Possession: but the first desiring to contract his whole Revenue into 
Ireland,
 and the other to make this adjacent to his principal Seat of 
Ruspar-hall
 in the County of 
Derby,
 Sir 
Edward Harper
 alienated this to Sir 
Ed∣ward Hales
 Knight and Baronet, and the Lord 
More, Chart
 by 
Sutton
 to the same worthy Person, Grand-father to Sir 
Edward Hales
 Baronet, who not only enjoyes the Title of his Ancestors Dignity, but that of the Possession in these places like∣wise.


Cheyneys-court
 in this Parish hath been adopted into that Name, since it for many Descents acknowledged the Jurisdiction and propriety of that Family: and I could unravel a Successive Series of many of that Name (but that it is superfluous) who were Lords of the Fee; it is enough, that Sir 
Thomas Cheyney
 sold it to 
Iden,
 which Name suddenly after resolving into two Daughters and Co-heirs, one matching with 
Brown,
 and the other with 
Barton,
 the last made it parcel of the Patrimony of that Family, and when some years it had been continued in the possession of 
Barton,
 it was in our Memory by Sale brought over to be the Demeasne of 
Wollett,
 and it is now (but whether by Purchase, or by the Right of a Female Heir or not, I cannot ascertain my self) the propriety of 
Jordan.


Sutton
 at 
Hone
 lies in the Hundred of 
Acstane,
 and gives Denomination to the whole 
Lath
 wherein it is situated. It was long since a Mannor relating to the Re∣venue of the Knights Hospitallers, who had here a Mansion-house, called St. 
Johns,
 where they often made their Retreat, when they visited their other Demeasne Land, which lay circumscribed within the Verge of this County: but their Estate here was much inforced and improved by the Addition of the Mannor of 
Grandison,
 which whether it came to them by Purchase or Donation from 
Thomas
 Lord 
Grandison,
 who died the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, is incertain. Upon the Sup∣pression of the 
Alberge
 of these Knights of St. 
John
 of 
Jerusalem
 here in 
England,
 their Revenue was assumed into the possession of the Crown: and King 
Henry
 the eighth, bestowed by Grant on Sir 
Maurice Dennis
 St. 
John's;
 and to him does that magnificent and elegant Pile, where now the Countess of 
Leicester
 makes her Resi∣dence, owe the first Institution of its Shape and Beauty, though it has been since

extreamly inlarged by the Additions both of Bulk and Ornament by Sir 
Thomas Smith.
 But to proceed, St. 
Johns
 was conveyed from Sir 
Maurice Dennis
 by his Co∣heir to 
Thomas Cranfeild,
 whose Grand-child 
Vincent Cranfeild,
 has lately alienated his Right to Mr. 
Hollis
 of 
London
 Merchant.


Haly Sawters
 is another Mannor in 
Sutton
 in 
Hone:
 a place though now obscure in it self, and not re-presented to our Remembrance but by Annals and Record, yet in elder Times it was raised up to a higher degree of Estimate, when it had Proprietaries, whose Nobility and Title added both Value and Lustre unto it. The first of which Register whom I trace in Record to be entituled to the Possession was 
Laurence de Hastings
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 and he died seised of it in the twenty second year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 47. from whom the Title came down to his Son 
John de Hastings,
 and he likewise was in the enjoyment of it at his Decease, which was in the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 70. After this Family, had deserted the Inheritance, I find 
Richard Fitz Allen
 Earl of 
Arundel
 to be invested in the Possession, and he died in the Tenure of it in the one and twentieth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 2. From whom it devolved to 
Joan
 his Daughter and Co-heir matched to 
William Beauchamp
 Baron of 
Aburgavenny,
 whose Son 
Richard
 Lord 
Beauchamp
 dying without Issue Male, 
Elizabeth
 his Sole Daughter, espoused to 
Edward Nevill
 Baron of 
Aburgavenny
 in her Right be came his Heir, and he in the sixteenth year of 
Edward
 the fourth died possest of this Mannor of 
Sawters.
 And here for want of Light both from publick or private Record; I cannot discover to my Reader or my self whether or not it passed away immediately from 
Nevill
 to 
Maio,
 whom I find about the beginning of Q. 
Elizabeth
 to be planted in the Possession, though the Affirmation of some old people of this Parish, who derived that Know∣ledge they have of it from the Tradition of their Ancestors that assert it did. 
Thomas Maio
 in the twenty eighth of Q. 
Elizabeth
 passed it away to 
Rich. Paramour,
 and he presently after disposed of it by Sale to Sir 
Henry Brooke,
 who conveyed it to 
Robert Wroth
 Esquire, and he to 
Edmund Hunt
 Esquire, who alienated 
Haly
 and 
Sawters
 to Mr. 
William Hewson
 in the thirty fourth year of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 whose Son Mr. 
William Hewson
 of 
London
 transmitted 
Haly
 with 
Sawters
 by Sale, some few years since, to Mr. 
Edward Badbie.


Grandisons
 is the last place remarkable in this Parish: It was the ancient Inheritance of the noble and illustrious Family of 
Grandison;
 before 
Otho de Grandison,
 who was Governour of 
Jersey
 for life by Grant from 
Edw.
 the first in the fifth year of his Reign, did transplant himself to 
Seale,
 which he had purchased in the thirteenth year of that Prince. 
William de Grandison
 this mans Son was likewise Lord of this place, to whom K. 
Edward
 the second assigned the Value of 44 
lb.
 yearly Rent out of his Mannor of 
Dartford,
 in Exchange for the Mannor of 
Iden
 and other Lands in 
Sussex,
 and from this Man did the Signory of this Mannor accrue by Descent to his Grand-child Sir 
Thomas Grandison,
 who dying without Issue in the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 62. left it partly to 
John de Northwood,
 who had married 
Agnes
 his Sister and Co-heir, and partly to 
Margaret
 his Lady Dowager, who died possest of it in the eighteenth year of 
Richard
 the second: but after her 
Exit,
 the Title was not long permanent in 
Northwood;
 for in the twenty first year of the Prince abovesaid, 
Richard Fitz Allen
 Earl of 
Arundel
 held it, and died that year possest of it: And here I confess for want of Light and just intelligence I must make a Leap to the Reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then I find it in the Tenure of 
Richard Nevill
 Earl of 
Warwick,
 and it is probable it devolved to him by the Heir of 
Beauchampe.
 After his Decease it became the Possession of 
George Duke
 of 
Clarence,
 who had matched with 
Isabel
 his Daughter and Co-heir, by whom he had Issue 
Edward Plantagenet
 Earl of 
Warwick,
 who was offered up on an early Scaffold, to the waking suspitions, and weary Jea∣lousies, of those two politick Princes, 
Henry
 the seventh, and 
Ferdinand
 of 
Castile,
 being invited to an escape, from his long Duress in the 
Tower,
 by the Arts and Stra∣tagems of that eminent Impostor, 
Perkin Warbeck:
 But indeed those who have cal∣culated this Action, and surveyed the whole Scene of this Tragedy, have discovered that his nearness to the Crown, as being the last Relick of the Male-Line of 
Plantagenet,
 was the cheiefest Ingredient in the severe Sentence, of this infortunate Gentleman. After his expiration, this Mannor came over to be the Patrimony of his

Sister, 
Margaret
 Countess of 
Salisbury,
 who was matched to Sir 
Richard Poole,
 by which marriage this Mannor was annexed to his Demeasn, and he had Issue by her 
Henry Poole,
 who with his Mother was attainted in the Reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, upon whose fatal Shipwrack, 
Grandisons
 was in the thirty fifth of that Prince placed by Grant in his Brother 
Geffrey Poole,
 who not long after passed it away to Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 by whose Daughter and Co-heir it came to be the Inheritance of Sir 
Thomas Kempe,
 and he about the tenth year of Q. 
Elizabeth
 conveyed it to Mr. 
Jo. Mabbe,
 who not long after transmitted it by Sale to Sir 
Christopher Heron,
 who about the be∣ginning of K. 
James
 alienated his concernment here to 
Cole,
 by whom not long after it was demised to Sir 
Thomas Smith,
 second Son of Customer 
Smith
 of 
Westenhanger;
 in the Heirs and Descendants of which Name and Family, the Possession is still resi∣dent.


Hackstaple
 is likewise within the Bounds of this Parish: and was, as high as the reach either of private or publick Evidence can bring down any light to our know∣ledge the 
Killingworth
's; and here, for an indivisible succession of Ages, did the Pos∣session fix, and reside, until at last the common Fate of Families, brought this Name here at 
Hackstaple
 to find its interment or Grave in a Daughter and Heir; for 
George Killingworth
 had an onely She-Inheritrix whose name was 
Elizabeth,
 and she was matched with 
Christopher Eglesfield
 Gentleman, so that 
Hackstaple
 in her right, was intermingled with the Demeash of this Family: and here some years did it by this Conjugall Knot appear fastned, till lately the Possession received an alienation; for 
Francis Eglesfield
 of 
London,
 Son to 
Christopher Eglesfield
 some few years since sold it to Mr 
Christopher Searle.






T. T. T. T.


TAningnton
 is situated in the Hundred of 
Bredge
 and 
Petham,
 and in Times of a very ancient Inscription did own the Name and acknowledge the Signory of a Family called 
Wallis. Richard de Wallis
 held it in the twenty first of 
Edward
 the first, and as it appears by the Pleas of that year had a signal Contest with the Prior of St. 
Gregories
 in 
Canterbury,
 about his Right to the Presentation of that Church. After 
Wallis
 was worn out, it fell under the Signory of a Family called 
Mesingham,
 but it seems was not long resident in their Possession: for about the beginning of 
Richard
 the second, 
Nicholas Mesingham
 releases to 
Thomas Chich
 all his Interess and Right in 
Tanington,
 and other Lands situated in 
Heckington
 and other places, but here likewise was the Possession as brief and inconstant; for before the Expiration of the Reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, I find it by purchase from 
Chich
 and 
Wallis,
 setled in the Tenure of 
Geo. Ballard;
 and he died seised of it in the eighth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and in this Family did continue until the reign of 
Edward
 the sixth, and then it was alienated by 
Nicholas Ballard
 Esquire, to Sir 
James Hales
 of the Dungeon; from whom the right by Successive Delegation is now transmitted to Sir 
James Hales
 the instant Lord of the Fee.


Terstan
 in the Hundred of 
Twyford,
 was involved in the Revenue of the Crown; until 
Eleanor
 Q. of 
England
 exchanged this and 
West-Farleigh
 with the Monks of 
Christ-Church
 for the eminent Port of 
Sandwich:
 which Exchange 
Edward
 the first (as appears by the Records of that Cathedral) by his Charter fully strengthened and confirmed. Yet though it was prop'd and supported by that Authority, yet it could not be so fastened and riveted into the Ecclesiastical Patrimony, but that, that storm which arose in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, tore it away: and then that Prince in the thirty fifth year of his rule passed it away to Sir 
John Baker;
 from whom it is now devolved by successive right to his descendant Sir 
John Baker
 of 
Sisingherst
 Knight and Baronet; and he hath lately passed it away to Mr. 
Jasper Cleyton
 of 
London.




Barham Court
 in this Parish re-presents to our remembrance, that it was once the Mansion or ancient residence of the noble and illustrious Family of 
Barham:
 this Name was, in Times of a very reverend Inscription, written 
Fitz-Urse. Randal Fitz. Urse
 was one of those four who were concerned in the Assassination of that turbulent and ambitious prelate 
Thomas Becket
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 who though perad∣venture for his violent invasion made upon the royal prerogative of his Soveraign 
Henry
 the second, might have deserved the Guerdon of an exemplary Death; yet the manner of taking him off cartied with it so deformed an Aspect in those times which were wholly consecrated and offered up to a superstitious Adoration of his memory, and contracted so black a Character on those who were interessed in his extra-judicial ruine, that 
Randal Fitz-Ʋrse
 fled into 
Ireland,
 and there altered his Name to 
Mac-Mahon,
 which in 
Irish
 imports as much as the Son of the Bear; upon his recess, 
Robert de Barham
 his Kinsman entred on his Estate here at 
Terstan,
 and from him did it de∣scend by paternal Devolution to his great Grand-child 
John de Berham,
 who was by 
Henry
 prior of 
Christ-Church
 created publick Notary of the Diocess of 
Canterbury
 in the year 1309, an Office of as much Eminence as it was of Trust and Concernment, and which the abovesaid 
Henry
 received by Commission to invest any with, whom he should discover to be fortified with Abilities, proportionate to so illustrious an em∣ployment from 
Bassianus de Alliate Count Palatine
 of 
Millaine:
 and he again was im∣powered and commissionated to grant it to any whom he should judge meet to receive it, by Authority delegated and transmitted to him originally from the Emperour, and it is probable that it was the above mentioned 
John de Berham
 or his Son who paid an Auxiliarie supply for his Lands at 
Terstan
 as appears by the Book of 
Aid,
 at the making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third: and in that Roll kept in the Exchequer wherein there is mention of all those of this County who paid respective Aid in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, at the Marriage of 
Blanch
 that Monarch's Daughter; there is a Recital of 
Nicholas Berham,
 who contri∣buted a supply for his Lands at 
Terston,
 and from him by an un-interrupted Line of succession was the Title of this place conducted down to 
Thomas Berham
 Esquire, who determined in a Daughter and Heir called 
Anne Berham,
 who by her intermar∣riage with Sir 
Oliver Boteler
 descended from an ancient Family of that Name in the County of 
Bedford
 made this Seat which had been so many centuries of years in the Tenure of this Family, alter its Proprietary, and become the Patrimony of another Name; Sir 
Oliver Boteler
 had Issue Sir 
William Boteler
 Knight and Baronet, who fell a Sacrifice to the late King's Quarrel, whilst he vigorously asserted his Cause and Interest at 
Cropredy Bridge;
 but left Issue the instant Proprietary Sir 
Oliver Boteler
 Baronet, whose Ancestors in 
Bedford hire
 were descended from 
Thomas Pincerna,
 who flourished in the reign of King 
John,
 and did Seal with a Covered Cup, with this In∣scription (as appears by the old Deeds of this Family) encircling the Seal, 
Sigillum Thomae Pincernae
 and it is possible was chief Butler to the abovesaid Prince; from which eminent Office of his, his Successors assumed the Sirname of 
Boteler.


Tenham
 contributes and affords a Name to that Hundred where it is placed, but is of more Eminence and repute, since it was given to 
Christ-Church
 in 
Canterbury,
 at the Intreaty of 
Athelard,
 by 
Cenulfe
 K. of the Mercians by the Estimate of twelve Plough-Lands; for the like Proportion of Land in Ballance to the exchange in 
Creges Emeline,
 that is, the Isse of 
Elmely
 by 
Crogdepe
 that is the water which parts the Royaltie of 
Swale
 between 
Tenham
 and 
Feversham.
 And in the Patrimony of the Church did it lie wrapt up till the suppression of all Frieries, Abbies, and other Religious Convents by 
Henry
 the eighth: and then 
Thomas Cranmer
 finding that the spreading Demeasn of the Church, was in danger to be torn off by the tallons of Avarice and Rapine, he to mortifie the growing Appetite of Sacrilegious Cormorants, in the first of 
December
 and in the twenty ninth year of that Prince's Government, exchanged it with the Crown, and thenceforth it was accounted a Limb of the Royal Revenue until King 
James
 by grant invested Sir 
Iohn Roper
 in it, and presently after created him Baron 
Roper
 of 
Tenham,
 (in Gratitude it seems for that Service he performed, in being the first who openly proclaimed him King in the County of 
Kent
) and by successive Deriva∣tion from him does his great Grand-child 
Christopher
 now Lord 
Roper
 of 
Tenham,


not onely possess the Dignitie, but the Royaltie of this Mannor likewise.


There is another Seat in this Parish, called 
Frogenhall,
 which in elder Times had the repute of a Mannor, though since by Disuse, that Character is almost shrunk away from it. That it was a Mansion of the 
Frogenhals,
 is most evident; for 
Richard Frogenhall
 was seised of it at his Death, which was in the thirty third year of 
Edward
 the third, and 
Thomas Frogenhall
 was his Son and Heir, who resigned up his Interest in it, with 
Anne
 his Daughter and Heir to 
Thomas Quadring:
 and not long after by the same Mutation, was the Interest of it by this man, with his Daughter and Heir 
Joan Quadring,
 given up to 
Richard Dryland
 Esquire, who likewise not many years after going out in a Daughter and Heir, called 
Katharine,
 she by being wedded to 
Reginald Norton
 Esquire, by that Conjugal Union, knit 
Frogenhall
 to the Interest of that Family, where after it had been some Ages fixt, it was by purchase brought to be the Inheritance of 
Greene,
 who (upon what Exigent or Occasion I know not) in the Conveyance is called 
Greene, alias Norton:
 but in this Name it made no permanent Residence; for even in our Memory, from 
Greene
 by Sale the Title and Right of it was translated into 
Clerke.


Tenham
 had the Grant of a Market procured to it on the Tuesday, and a Fair to continue yearly three dayes, at the Assumption of the Virgin 
Mary,
 by 
Boniface
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 as appears, 
Pat.

Tenterden,
 in the Hundred of 
Tenterden,
 had its denomination, as some vulgar Phansies conjecture, from the tenderness of the Soile adjacent to it: but indeed it was in elder and more true Orthography, written 
Theinwarden,
 that is, the 
Thanes
 or 
Theins, Ward,
 or 
Guard
 in the Valley; for it was very probable it was subservient to that Signory or Dominion, which the Governour of 
Andredswaldt
 (so called by the 
Saxons:
 but 
Anderida
 by the 
Romans
) did exercise, and pretend to, in this Track of the County. Now if you will question where this Castle of 
Anderida
 or 
Andreds∣waldt
 was placed; I answer, it was upon 
Reding-hill,
 not far removed from this place, a Fortress in those Times of eminent Value and Reputation, though since by the multiplied Onsets of Time upon it, it lies forgotten in its own neglected Ruines; yet though this be languished away both in Fame and Fabrick, 
Tenterden
 has sundry Seats in it, which may make it eminent enough. First, 
Heronden
 resigns it self up to an Inquisition, though now it be scattered into severall parcels, yet anciently it was collected, as into one Name, so into one possession likewise; and the ancient Ordinaries in the Heralds Office, do assign a Coat to this Name, something pro∣portionate to it, that is, 
an Heron rising upon its wing, and gaping for Breath:
 but when Time began to invade this Family, and break it into parcels, one part of this Seat was sold to Sir 
John Baker,
 Predecessor to Sir 
John Baker,
 who is now the possessor of it: but the other parts of it stayd longer in this Name; for 
Heronden
 not long since sold some part of it to Mr. 
John Austin
 lately deceased, and the Re∣mainder was passed by the same conveyance to Mr. 
Short.


Pitlesden
 is the second which requires our Notice, it gave Seat to a Family so called, which remained in possession of it, till 
Stephen Pitlesden
 died and left a Daugh∣ter and Heir, whose Name was 
Julian,
 who by marrying with 
Edward Guldeford,
 made this parcel of the Revenue of that Family, and here without any Interruption was the Inheritance planted, till 
Iohn Guldeford
 Esquire transferred his Right by Sale, to Sir 
Iohn Baker,
 one of the Privy Councel to Queen 
Mary,
 whose Grand∣child Sir 
Iohn Baker
 Knight and Baronet, Father of Sir 
Iohn Baker
 Baronet now of 
Sisingherst
 in 
Cranbroke,
 did some years since alienate the possession of it to Mr. 
Jasper Clayton
 of 
London
 Mercer.


Lights Notinden
 and 
East. Asherinden,
 are two other Mannors in 
Tenterden,
 which belonged partly to a 
Chauntry,
 founded here by 
Iohn Light,
 and partly to 
Brooke
 near 
Wye,
 and were, upon the suppression of the One, and Dissolution of the Priory of 
Christ-church
 to which 
Brooke
 related, granted by 
Henry
 the eighth, to Sir 
Iohn Baker
 Atturney General to that Prince, 
Edward
 the sixth, and Queen 
Mary;
 and from him are they now devolved by paternal Right to Sir 
Iohn Baker
 of 
Sisingherst
 Baronet.


There is a place in this Parish, called 
Finchden,
 which in our Grand-fathers Me∣mory

was purchased by Sir 
Edward Hales,
 Ancestor of the Family of 
Finch;
 from which Mr. 
Edward Finch,
 now of 
Tenterden,
 is originally descended, which in Times of an elder Character, gave Sirname to a Family called 
Finchden:
 one of whom called 
William
 de 
Finchden
 was Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, in the Time of 
Edward
 the third, and sometimes in the old Law-books, which have an Aspect on his reign, is written 
Finchden,
 and sometimes contractedly 
Finch;
 and it is probable the Name was originally 
Finch,
 only 
Den
 was added to it (which was customary and usual in elder Times) because this Family had their Dwelling in some Habitation, whose Situation was near some Valley.


Tenterden
 was governed by a Port-reve or Bayley, as the original Patent in∣forms me, from the thirty sixth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, until the forty third year of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was by Patent from that Princesse ordered to be governed by a Major and Jurates, and so it hath ever since continued.


I had almost forgot 
Elarinden,
 which is the last place of Note in 
Tenterden,
 and celebrates it self to be parcel of the Mannor of 
Frid
 or 
Frith
 in 
Bethersden,
 and was involved in that Revenue, which did confess the Signory of the Noble Family of 
Mayney,
 and was found to be in the possession of 
John de Mayney,
 at his Decease, which was in the fiftieth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 39. and lay couched in that Demeasne, which related to this Name, until the reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was passed away to 
Darell,
 and remained involved in the Pa∣trimony of this Family, until the seventeenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was alienated by 
John Darell
 Esquire, to Sir 
John Hales,
 one of the Barons of the Exchequer, and from him by a Devolution of successive Descent, is it now come down to Sir 
Edward Hales
 of 
Tunstall
 Baroner.


Tilmanston
 in the Hundred of 
Eastrie,
 has divers Seats within the Verge and Boundaries of it, not only of Reputation and Account, in Respect of their own Antiquity; but likewise in Relation to those Persons who were possest of them. First, there is 
North-court
 and 
Dane-court,
 both were anciently under the Domini∣on of one Person, and continue interwoven still, though they have borrowed these several Names in Respect of their opposite Situation. 
John de Sandherst
 made a Claim of Liberties in 
North-court,
 the sixth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Christian
 his Daughter and Heir was married to 
William Langley
 of 
Knowlton,
 who in her Right possest this Mannor, and by a new Ins
ection had the former Liberties exemplified, the thirty seventh year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Pat.
 37. 
pars prima Memb.
 21. and after that the possession of this place had by an even Line of Descent been drawn thorough this Family, it did at last by an Heir General devolve to 
Peyton,
 and by a Derivative Title from him, does Sir 
Thomas Peyton
 of 
Knowlton
 Baronet, hold the instant en∣joyment of it. But 
Dane-court
 was passed away by 
Langley
 to 
Fenell,
 and from him by the like Transition, it came over to 
Thomas Cox
 Customer of 
Sandwich,
 and he by Sale invested the Interest of it in 
Fogge,
 Ancestor to my Noble Friend 
Richard Fogge
 Esquire, now Possessor of 
Dane-court,
 a Person to whom for that Intelligence he has contributed to me in Relation to the Noble Families of 
Crioll
 and 
Valoignes,
 whose Heirs General matched with 
Fogge,
 and who formerly by those Alliances, annexed a vast Revenue in this County to this Name, I am signally obliged.


South-court
 in this Parish was in Times of eldest Inscription, as appears by a Sur∣vey of this Parish, taken in the eighteenth year of 
Edward
 the third, and which lies now in the Hands of Mr. 
Anneslow Gardiner
 of 
Haling
 in 
Croyden,
 Sir 
John de Tittesden:
 but certainly the possession was not long resident here; for not long af∣ter, I find the Lord 
Martin
 of 
Devon
 to be Proprietary of it, from whom in the reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, the Right of it was by Sale conducted down to 
John White,
 after made Sir 
John White,
 a Merchant of the 
Staple
 at 
Canterbury,
 and when this Name deserted the possession of this place, the next who succeeded in the subsequent Se∣ries was 
Cox,
 from whom by purchase the Right came into 
Fogge,
 and from that Name, by the Fate of Sale, was it made the Inheritance of 
Peyton,
 from whom by Communicative Derivation and Descent, it is incorporated into the Demeasne of Sir 
Thomas Peyton.




Toniford
 in the Hundred of 
West-gate,
 did afford both Seat and Sirname to a Fa∣mily, which came under that Appellation; and there is mention in the Book of 
Aide
 of 
John Toniford,
 who lived here about the beginning of 
Edward
 the third: but this Family was worn out, about the latter part of that Prince's Reign, And the next in Order, who was Lord of the Fee, was Sir 
Thom is Fogge,
 who flouri∣shed here in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, and 
Richard
 the second, and after it had been for sundry Descents fixt in this Name and Family, the Interest which they had here, was by purchase brought over to claim 
Vane
 for its Possessor, where likewise the Title was as unstable: for not many years are consumed, since it was alienated from their Revenue, and made by Sile the Demeasne of Captain 
Collin,
 or 
Seding∣bourn.


Tong
 in the Hundred of 
Milton,
 was anciently called 
Thewng
 and 
Thawng,
 which import as much in 
Saxon,
 as 
Thong
 in 
English;
 for the common Opinion derived from a universal Tradition, and that asserted and justified by an uninterrupted Assent of elder Times, is, That 
Vortiger
 the 
British
 King, gave 
Hengist
 and 
Horsa,
 as a Symbol and Pledge of his Affection, so much Land to erect a Fortress on, as could be environed and circumscribed, by the Hide of a Beast cut into Thongs, which accordingly was performed, and the Castle thus established, in Memory of the original Donation, was in the 
Saxon
 Dialect styled 
Thwangceoster
 or 
Thong-castle:
 and this Story is made more probable and plausible, because 
Matthew
 of 
Westminster
 affirms that 
Aurelius Ambrosius
 by many provocations endevoured to engage 
Hengist,
 and his 
Saxons
 to a Battle at 
Tong
 in 
Kent:
 and that there was a Castle here, the Fragments and Remains of some Fortifications near the Mill, do easily evince; though they lie now gasping in so deplored an heap, that only the Rubbish of its Ruines are dis∣cernable; yet certainly in elder Times it was a Fortress of Importance; for the Moat of the Castle is yet so wide and deep, that it contributes Water enough to drive a Mill. But to proceed; After the Conquest, it constantly acknowledged the powerful and eminent Family of 
Badelesmer,
 and 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badclesmer
 obtained the Grant of a three Dayes Fair at St. 
Giles,
 to be observed at 
Tong,
 as appears, 
Pat.
 9. 
Edwardi secundi Num.
 57. But when he, by his Defection, in the sixteenth year of 
Edward
 the second, had forfeited this, and the residue of his Pa∣trimony to the Crown, this by the indulgent favour of 
Edward
 the third, was in the second year of his reign, restored to his Son 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 who died possest of it, in the twelfth year of the abovesaid Prince, and left it to his Brother 
Giles de Badelesmer,
 who dying without Issue, it accrued upon the Division of the Estate, to be the Portion of 
Edmund Mortimer
 Earl of 
March
 and 
Ʋlster,
 who had matched with 
Elizabeth
 Widow of 
William Bohun
 Earl of 
Northampton,
 and Sister and Co-heir of the abovesaid 
Giles,
 and he in the fifth year of 
Richard
 the second, was found in her Right to have died possest of it, as appears, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 43. and from him it descended to his Grand-child 
Edmund
 the last Earl of 
March,
 who being embarked in that War, which was commenced by 
Henry
 Lord 
Percy,
 Sir∣named the 
Hotspur
 of the 
North,
 against 
Henry
 the fourth, made Shipwrack of his Estate here at 
Tong,
 and was seised on as an Escheat by the Crown, and lay involved in the Royal Revenue, until 
Henry
 the sixth, in the twenty seventh year of his reign, granted it to Sir 
Thomas Browne of Bechworth-castle,
 both Controller and Treasurer of his Houshold: but his Son Sir 
George Browne,
 in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the fourth, surrendered it back to the Crown, for the Benefit and Use of 
Cicely
 Dur∣chess Dowager of 
Yorke,
 Mother of the abovesaid Prince: After whose Decease it reverts and flows back into its ancient Channel, and was esteemed a Limb of the Royal Patrimony, until the first year of King 
Edward
 the sixth, and then it was by that Prince granted to Sir 
Ralph Vane,
 as a Guerdon of that eminent and signal Ser∣vice he performed in 
Scotland,
 when he was employed thither with Sir 
Ralph Sadler,
 by King 
Henry
 the eighth: and he not long after conveyed his Interest here to Sir 
Rowland Clerke,
 and from him in the fourth year of the abovesaid Prince, it passed away by Sale to 
Salomon Wilkins,
 in which Family it remained until the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was alienated to Mr. 
William Pordage
 of

Rodmersham
 Ancestor to Mr. 
Thomas Pordage,
 who still is in possession of it.


Cheeks-Court
 is a second place of Importance in 
Tong,
 it was anciently written 
Checks Court,
 as indeed affording both Seat and Sirname to a Family, which in very old Deeds, and other Monuments, is frequently named 
At Check,
 and sometimes 
de Check
ell;
 In the reign of 
Edward
 the second, I find 
William de Cre
 entituled to the possession, but held it not long: for in the ninth year of that Prince, I find the Signory invested in 
Peyforer,
 who died that year possest of it, as appears, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 43. But before the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, this Family determined to 
Julian Peyforer
 a Sole Heir, who brought it along with her to her Husband 
Thomas St. Leger
 of 
Ottringden
 Esquire, who concluding in two Daughters and Co-heirs matched to 
Ewias
 and 
Aucher,
 his Estate came, in the renth of 
Henry
 the fourth, to be shared by those two Families, who not long after passed away their right here and in 
Elmeley
 to 
Cromer,
 in which Family the Propriety remained until the Beginning of King 
James,
 and then it was sold by Sir 
James Cromer
 to 
Allen.


Throuley
 in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 was the capital Mansion of the 
Gattons;
 for 
Hamon de Gatton,
 had it in possession at his decease, which was in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the first,

 and 
Elizabeth Gatton
 was found upon the Inquisition to be his Sole Heir, who married 
William de Dene,
 and so by this Alliance it came to own the possession of that Family: and this 
William
 had a Charter of Free-warren granted to his Lands here in the tenth year of 
Edward
 the second, and after him 
Thomas de Dene
 held it at his Death which was in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the third. And 
William de Dene,
 by right from him, possest the Inheritance; whose Daughter and Co∣heir, 
Benedicta Dene,
 being married to 
Iohn Shelving,
 it went into the patrimony of that Family, which shortly after determined likewise in Daughters and Coheirs: one of which called 
Joan,
 was matched to 
Iohn Brampton alias Detling,
 of 
Detling-court,
 and so it was made a Limb of his Domeasne: but here it stayed not long neither, for this Name quickly sunk into a Female Heir, known by the Name of 
Benedicta Bramp∣ton, alias Detling,
 who was wedded to 
Thomas At Town,
 who had much Land about 
Charing:
 but 
Throuley
 being in his Wifes right, incorporated into his Revenue, he transplanted himself into this Parish, and here erected a Seat, which he adopted into his own Name, and called it 
Town-place:
 but suddenly after, he concluded in three Daughters and Coheirs; 
Eleanor
 married to 
Richard Lewknor
 of 
Bodshead
 in 
Chal∣lock, Benet
 married to 
William Watton
 of 
Addington;
 and 
Elizabeth
 wedded to 
Will. Sonds
 of 
Sonds-place
 at 
Darking
 in 
Surrey,
 who divided 
Towns
 Estate: and 
Throu∣ley,
 with 
Town-place
 it self, upon the partition, sell to be the Lot or portion of 
Richard Lewknor,
 who sold them to 
Edward Evering,
 from whom by 
Mary
 his Daughter and Heir, married to 
Iohn Upton
 of 
Fever ham, Town-place
 went into the possession of that Name; and from 
Ʋpton,
 by Sale, it was carried over to 
Shilling,
 where after some few years the Title had rested, it was by a Revolution of the same Nature and Semblance, transplanted into 
Sonds:
 from which purchase Sir 
George So
s
 Knight of the 
Bath,
 now derives his Right and Inheritance, in the Mannor and Signory of 
Town-place.


VVilderton
 in 
Throuley
 was eminent formerly, for being marshalled under the Revenue of 
Giles
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 Father to 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmer,
 who by his opposing of 
Edward
 the second, at 
Leeds Castle,
 forseited this and his Life, together, to the offended Justice of that Prince: but when his Sons 
Barth.
 and 
Giles
 Lord 
Badelesmer
 were by 
Edward
 the third, restored to their former Dignity, and likewise to a principal part of his Estate, this was folded up in that Restitution; for when these above-mentioned Brothers deceased without any lawfull Issue, their Sisters were found to be their Coheirs, and 
Margery
 one of them, being married to 
William
 Lord 
Rosse,
 brought this to a piece of his Revenue; from whom by Sale it went into the possession of 
Lewknor
 of 
Bodshead
 in 
Challock.
 And when this Family was de∣vested of it, the Inheritance was by purchase, setled in 
Evering,
 descended from the 
Everings
 of 
Everings-court
 in 
Alkham
 by 
Dover,
 where after it had some years found a continued Residence, the Name and Title dissolved together: for 
Edward Evering,
 left only 
Mary Evering
 his Sole Heir, who matching with 
John Upton
 Gentleman, that Alliance fixed 
Wilderton
 in the Possession of that Name: and part

of it, was in some years subsequent to this Match, sold away to 
Arnold Terrey
 of this Parish, but the Residue is yet constant to the Interess of Mr. 
Ʋpton
 of 
Feversham,
 a person in whom the Scholler and Gentleman, are so evenly mixt, as to a Com∣position of Perfection, that it is yet a Question, which of them is the most pre∣dominant.


There was a religious House in 
Throuley,
 which was a Cell to St. 
Bertins
 at St. 
Omer
 in 
Flanders:
 but when 
Henry
 the fifth, perceived the ill Consequences of having Frater∣nities, and other religious Cells and Covents in this Nation, which had in a manner their dependances upon other States, contrary peradventure in Interess and Affection to this; he suppressed this, and many other of the like Condition, and out of their Ruines and Revenue, he erected the magnificent Monastery at 
Shene,
 whose first Foundation entitles it self to his Piety and Munificence.


Thurnham
 in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne,
 was the Patrimony of an ancient and Knight∣ly Family of that Sirname, made more eminent by the production of Sir 
Robert de Thurnham,
 a person of considerable Account in the reign of 
Richard
 the first, which Prince he accompanied to the holy War, having before his designing himself to that Quarrel, disposed his Estate to pious Uses, whereof this at 
Thurnham
 was setled on the Colledge of 
Lingfield
 in 
Surrey,
 and having thus disroabed himself of his secular Inheritance, he with much Vigor and Alacritie assumed the Crusado or Vow to rescue the Sepulcher of our Saviour out of the possession of Infidels, which reso∣lution he so nobly prosecuted, that he offered up his Life as an Oblation to the Justice of that cause which he had before so generously asserted; After his Decease this re∣mained cloistered up in the patrimony of the Colledge of 
Lingfield,
 untill the ge∣neral suppression, and then growing parcel of the royal Revenue, it lay there until King 
Edward
 the sixth granted it to Sir 
Edward Wotton,
 whose Anceftor Sir 
Nicholas Wotton
 was invested long before in some part of this Mannor, which did acrue to him in the reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, by 
Joan
 Sole Heir of 
Robert Corbie,
 and from this Sir 
Edward
 above mentioned, was it entirely transmitted to his great Grand-child 
Thomas
 Lord 
Wotton,
 who having setled it in Marriage on his eldest Daughter 
Katherin Wotton
 matched to 
Henry
 Lord 
Stanhop,
 she by Sale hath lately given up her right to Mr. ..... 
Godden
 of 
London.


Binbery
 is an eminent Mannor in this Parish, which, as high as the Testimony of any either publick or private Evidences can instruct me, did own the Signory of 
North∣wood. Roger de Northwood
 held it at his Death, which was in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third, and so did his Successor 
Roger Northwood
 in the last year of 
Henry
 the fifth. But after this I do not find it long constant to the Interest of this Family; for about the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, I find by some ancient Court-rolls that it was passed away to 
Iohn Thwaits;
 and he in the eighth year of that Prince, conveyed his right in it to 
William Gascoigne,
 in which Family the Title continued until the beginning of 
Edward
 the fourth, and then it was transplanted by Sale into 
Cut,
 or 
Cuts,
 and in this Name the Interest of this place was constantly lodged, until the beginning of King 
James,
 and then it was demised to Sir 
Samuel Lennard
 of 
West-Wickham,
 whose Son Sir 
Stephen Lennard
 is at this instant by paternal Right invested in the possession of it.


There was a Dysastrous Accident happen'd here at 
Binbery
 and it was this, as the Tragedy is represented to us out of the old Evidences of the Lord 
Wotton.
 The Lady 
Northwood
 in the Time of 
Edward
 the third, standing on the precipice or hanger of a Hill to see a Fox digged out which had earthed himself there, the Foundation being loose and Sandy sunk under her, and the hanging Hill shot down so much earth upon her that she was stifled to Death with the unequal pressure, e're they could dis∣engage her from that weight, which crushed her into this early Ruine.


Upon the Brow of the Hill not far removed from this place, are the Ruines of an ancient Fortress called 
Godward
 Castle, which Mr. 
Darell
 in his Tract. 
De Costellis Cantii
 conjectures might borrow its Name from 
Godar dus
 a 
Saxou,
 whereas it is more probable it did extract its etymology from the goodness and eminence of its situation, as those Intrenchments at 
Stowting
 derive their Denomination from their tenable force and fortitude: and certainly this is adequate to reason and its own elevated

position it being so setled, that it did not onely secure the way which led from the 
Roman
 Colony at 
Newington
 by 
Rainham,
 but it is possible was a speculatory station much in use amongst the 
Romans,
 to survey the Approaches of enemies, in the Valley below.


Aldington Septuans
 in 
Thurnhem,
 was the Cradle of an ancient Family of that Sirname.

 
Robert de Septuans
 is inserted in the Register of those noted 
Kentish
 per∣sons, who were engaged with 
Richard
 the first at the Siege of 
Acon.

 Rob. de Septuans
 his Son was embarqued with 
Henry
 the third in his expedition against the 
Welch,
 in the forty second year of his Reign. Sir 
Rob. de Septuans
 was his Son and Heir, who was honoured with that Dignity by 
Edward
 the first for his exemplary Service per∣formed at the Siege of 
Carlaverock,
 in the twenty eighth year of that Prince, and he was father to 
Will. de Septuans
 who was seised of it when he deceased, which was in the twenty fifth year of 
Edw.
 the third, but it seems it was not long permanent in the Tenure of this Name; for immediately after the 
Gowers
 had it, and 
Iohn Gower
 when he died was in the enjoyment of it, which was in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third; from whom not many years after, it was by purchase transported to 
Iohn Brockhul
 Esquire, and with the Demeasn of this Family did the right of this place many years appear to be interwoven, till 
Anne
 Daughter and Heir of 
Henry Brockhull,
 married to Sir 
Iohn Taylor,
 and then both the Name and Estate were swallowed up in this Fa∣mily, where the possession for sundry Ages remained, till lately it was conveyed by Sale to 
Freake
 issued out from the 
Freakes
 of the County of 
Dorset,
 who by marrying the Darghter of Sir 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Hollingbourne
 has planted himself in this County.


There was a 
Castle
 anciently in 
Thurneham,
 which as 
Darel
 affirms in his Tract 
de Castellis Cantii,
 had both its Name and Foundation, from 
Godardus
 a 
Saxon,
 being called 
Godard
 Castle, which is so despicable an Heap, that not the least Crums or Frag∣ments continue of the Ruines, which might signifie to us the lest symptome of its former strength and Grandeur.


Tunstall
 in the Hundred of 
Milton,
 did about the twenty ninth of 
Henry
 the third, confess it self to be under the Dominion of 
Walter de Grey,
 who was Lord 
Paramont
 of this place, but long did not remain invested in the Signory of it; for in the forty fourth year of 
Henry
 the third, I find 
Iohn de Burgh
 descended from 
Hubert de Burgh,
 in the possession of it: and he that year by the favourable compliance of that Prince, obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Mannors of 
Norton
 and 
Tunstall;
 but before the latter end of 
Edward
 the first this Family had deserted the Inheritance of this place, and then the next which succeeded proprietarie of it was 
Thomas de Brotherton
 Earl of 
Norfolk,
 who ending in Daughters and Co-heirs, 
Margaret
 one of them (being first matched to 
Iohn de Segrave,
 and afterwards to 
Walter de Mayney
 descended from 
VValter de Meduana
 or 
Mayney,
 who held twenty Knights in this County, in the reign of 
Henry
 the third) brought this to be the Demeasn of her second Husband, 
Walter de Mayney,
 a person on whom the Beams of Majestie reflected with so vigorous impression, that he was summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron in the reign of 
Edw.
 the third; and in whom that Prince reposed so great a confidence, that as 
Daniel
 re∣presents to us in his Chronicle, he and his Son 
Edward
 the Black Prince, fought under his Colours in a private Habit against 
Monsieur de Charmy
 a 
Frenchman
 near 
Calais
 in 
Picardy,
 in the twenty third year of his reign, and deceased full of Fame and of Years in the forty fixth of that Prince: but determined in 
Anne Mayney
 his Sole Inheritrix, who by matching with 
John Hastings
 Earl of 
Pembroke
 linked this Mannor to his Inheritance; but he dying in the thirteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Reginald Grey,
 and 
Richard Talbot
 were found to be his Heirs, and they bring a pleading, in the fif∣teenth year of the Prince abovesaid, against 
John le Scroope,
 who pretended some Title to his Estate; and having rescued it from collateral Claim about the beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth, conveyed it to Sir 
Robert Knolles,
 who in the seventh year of that Prince, passed it by Fine then levied to Sir 
William Cromer
 Lord Maior of 
London;
 his Son 
William Cromer
 Esquire, who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the twenty third year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and was afterwards in the twenty seventh year of that Prince bar∣barously assassinated by 
Jack Cade,
 whilst he endeavoured to impeach that Arch-In∣cendiarie

in his March towards 
London.
 He married 
Elizabeth
 Daughter of 
James Fiennes
 Lord 
Say
 and Seal, by whom he had Issue Sir 
James Cromer
 Father of Sir 
Will. Cromer,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the ninteenth year of 
Henry
 the seventh, and the first year of K. 
Henry
 the eighth, and 
George Cromer
 who was Arch-Bishop of 
Armagh
 in 
Ireland.
 This Sir 
William
 had Issue 
James Cromer
 Esquire; from whom descended 
Will. Cromer
 Esq; his Son and Heir who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 the ninth and twenty seventh of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and had Issue Sir 
James Cromer
 of 
Tunstall
 Knight, Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the second year of K. 
James,
 in whom the Male-line determined; so that 
Francis
 his Daughter by his first Wife matched to Sir 
Mathew Carew, Elizabeth
 his Daughter by his second Wife wedded to Sir 
Iohn Steed
 of 
Steed-hill,
 and 
Christian
 born like∣wise by that Venter, married to Sir 
Iohn Hales
 eldest Son to Sir 
Edward Hales
 of 
Wood-Church,
 became his Co-heirs. Upon the partition of the Estate, 
Tunstall
 was shared by Sir 
Iohn Hales;
 from whom it is now descended to his Son and Heir Sir 
Edw. Hales
 Baronet, who lately hath begun to erect, upon the ancient Foundation, a Frabrick of that stupendious Magnificence, that it at once obliges the eye to Admi∣ration and Delight.


Ʋfton
 is a place of Repute Seated in this Parish: but it is raised up to a higher esti∣mate, since we find it was anciently parcel of the patrimony of 
Shurland;
 for 
Robert de Shurland
 had a concession by Charter of Free-Warren to sundry of his Lands in 
Kent,
 amongst which, there is a recital of 
Ʋfton:
 afterwards in Times subsequent to this, by the Heir General of 
Shurland
 it was cast into the possession of 
Cheyney,
 and 
Will. de Casineto
 (for so this Name is rendred in Latine Records) or 
William Cheyney
 held it at his Death, which was in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the third; and after for many Descents it had layn included in the Interest and proprietie of 
Cheyney,
 it was by a Daughter and Heir put into the Demeasn of 
Astley;
 from whom again the like flux of Circumstances bore away the Inheritance, and transferred it to 
Harlackenden,
 the instant Lord of 
Ʋfton.


Gore-Court
 in this Parish in Times of elder Derivation was the Seat of a Family whose Sirname was 
At-Gore,
 and sometimes in ancient Court-rolls written 
De la Gore,
 called so from their Habitation, which was situated near some publick way; 
Gare, Gate,
 and 
Gore,
 importting no more in the 
Saxon
 Dialect then some common passage. But to proceed: 
Henry At-Gore
 held 
Gore-Court
 when he deceased, which was in the thirty first year of 
Edward
 the third, and for several Generations was the Inheritance knit to his Name till the common Fatalitie of Time, brought it to expire in 
Alice Gore
 the Heir General of this place, and of 
Iohn Gore
 the last of the Male-line who enjoyed it; and she disposed of her Concernment in it to 
Will. Croyden
 in which Family after the possession had resided, it was alienated to 
Wood,
 descended from the 
Woods
 of 
Muston
 in 
Hollingbourne,
 in whom the right of 
Gore-Court
 continues still invested.


Tunbridge
 gives Name to that we style the 
Lowy
 of 
Tunbridge,
 and is a small Ter∣ritory within it self, called in old Latine Records 
Districtus Leuca de Tunbridge,
 and was formerly subservient to the Dominion of those noble Persons, who were Lords of the Fee. The first of which, was 
Richard de Clare
 Earl of 
Brionie
 in 
Normandy,
 to whom it was by 
William Rufus
 granted upon this emergent Occasion. This 
Richard
 was an earnest Abettor and supporter likewise of the Designes of this Prince, upon his Brothers Territories in 
Normandy,
 and so by consequence an active partisan of his, which made the Breast of 
Robert Duke
 of 
Normandy
 to boile with such Animosity and passion against Him, that the Flame of his Hatred kindled the Flame of a War which could not be extinguished, but by the Depredation of this Earl's Estate, and the utter subversion of his Castle of 
Brionie,
 which was left an Heap of Flame and Ruines, which caused 
William Rufus
 to risent his Calamitous Condition with so much Regret and Commiseration, that he granted him as much Land here at 
Tunbridge,
 as would spread into a League both in the Extent and Longitude of it, and in the Breadth and Latitude of it likewise; and 
Gemeticensis
 reports that this 
Richard
 brought over the Rope with which he was to measure it, in the same Ship which transported him and his Retinue. From this 
Richard
 who founded the Castle, the right of 
Tunbridge
 was by Descent translated into his Son 
Gilbert de Clare
 the first Earl of 
Hertford
 and here did the Signory many years find a residence, till 
Isabel
 Sister and Coheir of 
Gilbert de Clare
 by matching with 
Hugh Audley,
 brought this to be the Inheritance of

that illustrious Family, where it had not long remained, but 
Margaret
 Daughter and Heir of 
Hugh Audley
 by marrying with 
Ralph Stafford
 made it a Branch of their pa∣trimony: nor did it depart from this Family, till the Vanitie of 
Edward Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham
 embarked him in that Design, which the Malice of Cardinal 
Wolsey
 aggravated with those Circumstances of Hatred, by blowing of wild Conjectures into the Ears of 
Henry
 the eighth, who was naturally a jealous Prince, and emu∣lous of any new blooming Glory, that he was stained with the black Tincture of Treason, which sunk him into an untimely Sepulcher, and his Estate by forfeiture into the possession of the Crown. 
Edward
 Duke of 
Buckingham
 being thus convict∣ed, in the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, there was a great Controversie started forth, in the thirteenth year of that Prince's reign, as appears by our Law-books, in the Parliament then convened, whether or not there were ground enough in the Crimes objected against him to establish an Attainder upon: and it was carried in the Affirmative that there was; upon which this Castle, with all the Mannor of 
Dach∣hurst, alias Hilden-borough,
 with all the appendant Services and Quit-rents united to them, did escheat to the Crown, and remained there, until Queen 
Elizabeth
 dissevered the Mannor of the Castle from her Interest, and made it by Grant the possession of her Kinsman 
Henry
 Lord 
Hunsdon,
 whose Son 
George
 Lord 
Hunsdon,
 about the beginning of King 
James,
 passed it with his Daughter and Heir to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Berkley,
 who conveyed it to Sir 
John Kenedie,
 from whom not long after, by the same Conveyance it fell under the divided Signory of 
Ferrers, Gosson,
 and 
Johnson,
 and they by a mutual Consent sold their Interest in it to Sir 
Peter Vanlore,
 by whose three Daughters and Co-heirs, matched to Sir 
Henry Zinzin,
 Sir 
Alex∣ander Sterling,
 and 
Robert Crooke
 Esquire, it is now divided between those three Fa∣milies. Although the Onsets of Time, and the Assaults of Enemies together, hath thrown the Beauty and Strength into such a rude Confusion, that it now lurks in its own Rubbish; yet formerly it was eminent for being the Scene of much Feude and Contention, between the Kings of 
England,
 and the Barons then in Arms against them.


In the year 1088. 
Odo
 Bishop of 
Bajeux
 and Earl of 
Kent,
 making a Defection from 
William Rufus,
 to those Barons who sought to support the Title of his eldest Brother 
Robert,
 placed one 
Gilbert
 in this Castle, for the Defence of it, which enforced that King to invest it with a Siege, and compelled the 
Castellan
 to a Sur∣render, and afterwards having taken 
Odo
 himself, imprisoned him in this Fortress, from whence he afterwards made a successful Escape.


In the year 1215. 
Falcatius de Brent,
 during the Military Contests King 
John
 had with his Nobility, by Force wrung this Castle from the Earl of 
Gloucester,
 and maintained it for some Time with signal Evidences of Magnanimity to the Kings Behoof and Use.


In the year 1231. upon the Decease of 
Gilbert,
 the then Earl of 
Gloucester,
 seised the Wardship of his Heir, and entrusted the Custody of this Castle to 
Hubert de Burgh
 Earl of 
Kent.
 This occasioned an eager and impetuous Contest between the King, and 
Richard
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury;
 the Arch-bishop pretended, be∣cause the Castle held of his See, therefore he, 
de Jure,
 ought to have the Custody of the Heir in his Wardship. To which the King replyed, that the whole Earl∣dome held of him, and that he might commit the Custody of the Lands to whom∣soever he pleased. This caused the Arch-bishop, boyling with much Heat and Passion, to Appeal for Redress to 
Rome,
 where he managed this Controversie with that vigorous dexterity, that the Pope issued out a solemn determination on his be∣half: but his Decease in his Journey homewards, superseded the Execution of the Papal Sentence.


The above-mentioned King 
Henry,
 in the year 1259. granted Licence to 
Richard de Clare
 Earl of 
Gloucester,
 to wall and embattle his Town of 
Tunbridge,
 in these Words in that Charter, 
Claudere Muro et Kernellare,
 which latter Word being made Latine out of the French 
Charneaux,
 imports that indented Form of the Top of a Wall, which hath Vent and Crest, commonly called embattelling, very ser∣viceable to the Defendants within, not only to annoy the Enemy, but likewise to shroud and secure himself from the Fury of any outward Assault.




This Mode of Fortification was in elder Time with much Caution prohibited within this Nation, out of a Jealousie that it might foment any inward Sedition, and was therefore, amongst many other Articles, inquirable before the 
Escheator de Domibus Kerneliatis.
 But the War breaking out not long after this, between the King and 
Simon de Montfort,
 to whose Interest the Earl of 
Gloucester
 was by a So∣lemn Combination closely united, the Grant of the above-mentioned King was made ineffectual, and not the least Symptoms of the intended Wall are at this in∣stant visible.


In the year 1263. the War growing hot between 
Henry
 the third, and 
Simon de Montfort,
 the King sets down before 
Tunbridge-castle,
 and forces it to snrrender to discretion; and therein found, amongst others, the Countess of 
Gloucester.
 From whence I collect, that in those Times it was esteemed, if not the only, yet at least a principal Mansion, of those great Lords of 
Tunbridge,
 the Earls of 
Glou∣cester.


In the first year of 
Edward
 the first, there was a Summons issued forth by 
Hugh de Bigod
 Earl of 
Norfolk,
 and Governour of the Hundred of 
Hoo,
 to injoyn 
Richard de Clare
 Earl of 
Gloucester,
 to appear before him to assoil himself from such Accu∣sations, as should be objected against him, which principally had an Aspect upon the War waged by him and 
Simon Montfort
 against 
Henry
 the third. To which he alleadged in his Defence, that he ought not to answer, but before the Kings Justices of 
Eyre;
 upon which a Commission was issued out, in the third year of 
Edward
 the first, to heare and decide the Controversie, and Sir 
Stephen de Penchester,
 and 
John de Rigate,
 were the two Justices appointed by the King for the final determination of it: and they upon a serious winnowing of the whole Matter in Debate, did absolve the said 
Richard
 from the Crimes with which he had been unjustly bespattered; and the ra∣ther, because as to the principal part of them, they had been before entombed in the pacification of 
Killingworth,
 made in the fiftieth year of 
Henry
 the third.


After this, I cannot find by that ancient Manuscript, they style the Chronicle of 
Tunbridge,
 that there was any signal Action commenced at this place, because the Castle with all its perquisites, not long after by the Heir of 
Audley,
 coming into the possession of 
Stafford,
 they planted themselves at 
Stafford-castle,
 their principal residence; and so this Fortress being neglected and deserted, languished away in∣sensibly into decay and ruine: only in the reign of 
Edward
 the first, I find that upon an Inquisition or Survey of the Priviledges of the Earls of 
Gloucester,
 as they were Lords of 
Tunbridge,
 it was concluded that the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury
 had no∣thing to do within the 
Lowy
 or 
League:
 That the Earl had Return of Writs, Crea∣tion of certain Officers, an especial Sessions in 
Eyre;
 all which by Intermission are shrunk long since into disuse.


In the year 1264. to allay all emergent Controversie for the future; 
Boniface
 the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and 
Richard
 Earl of 
Glocester,
 decreed that there should be a Perambulation made concerning their respective Bounds: and it was not long after likewise concluded between the patties abovesaid, that Earl 
Richard
 should hold his Mannor of 
Tunbridge,
 and other Lands of the Arch-bishop by the Service of four Knights Fees, and to be high Steward, and high Butler, which Office was likewise to be transmitted to his Successors, at the Feast of the Arch-bishops Inthro∣nization, taking for their Service in the Stewardship, seven competent Robes of Scarlet, thirty Gallons of Wine, thirty pound of Wax for his Lights, Livery of Hay and Oats to feed fourscore Horse for two Nights, the Dishes and Salt which should stand before the Arch-bishop in that Feast; and at their departure, the Diet of three Dayes at the Sole Expence of the Arch-bishop, at four of their Mannors, in any of the four Quarters of 
Kent,
 wheresoever they pleased to fix 
ad minuendum sanguinem;
 so they repaired thither with fifty Horses only. To his Office of chief Butlership was allotted seven Robes like the former, twenty Gallons of Wine, fifty pound of Wax for furnishing out of Lights, Livery for sixty Horse for two Nights, the Cup wherewith the Arch-bishop should be served, all the empty Hogs∣heads of Beer, and for six Tun of Wine, so many as should be drunk under the Bar also. The Articles of which Composition in Times subsequent to this Compact, were punctually performed between the Successors of either Party.




First, in the year 1295. between 
Gilbert
 Earl of 
Gloucester,
 and 
Robert Winchel∣sey;
 next, between the said Earl, and Arch-bishop 
Reynolds;
 then between 
Hugh Audley
 the Earl of 
Gloucester,
 and the Arch-bishop 
John Stratford;
 after that, be∣tween 
Hugh Stafford
 Earl of 
Stafford,
 to whom the Castle and Mannor of 
Tun∣bridge,
 did devolve in right of the Heir General of 
Audley,
 and 
Simon Sudbury;
 and lastly, between 
William Warham
 the Arch-bishop, and 
Edward Stafford
 the last Duke of 
Buckingham
 of that Name, in whose untimely Sepulcher these two great Offices found their final Enterment, and he executed the Stewardship in his own person, and the Butlership by his deputed Delegate Sir 
Thomas Bourchier
 Knight.


The Priory of 
Tunbridge
 was founded by 
Richard de Clare,
 in the year of 
Grace
 1191. and stored with Canons Regular, or Canons of St. 
Augustins,
 and dedicated to St. 
Mary Magdalen,
 which upon the Petition of the Founder, was confirmed by Pope 
Celestin,
 in the same year it was erected.


In the year 1353. an unhappy Fire seised upon it, which almost reduced the whole Structure into Ashes: to ballance which Dysaster, the Church of 
Leigh
 was appro∣priated to this Covent, that by this additional support, this Cloister thus defaced with Flame might again recover its former, not only Bulk, but Splendor like∣wise.


Somerhill
 is now an eminent Seat in this Parish, and was certainly in elder Times allotted, as a Mansion, or place of Residence by the Earls of 
Gloucester
 to those Gentlemen who were Bailiffs of their great Chase called 
South-Frith,
 one of whom was 
Richard de Philpot
 of 
Philpots
 in 
Leigh,
 not far distant, who flourished here, in the reign of 
Henry
 the third, and is written in an old Deed, 
Balivus Forestae de Tun∣bridge sub Ricardo Comite de Clare.
 After him I find, one 
Nicholas Charles
 exercised this Office, and flourished in it, in the reign of 
Edward
 the second: and when he went out, divers of the Family of 
Colepeper
 and 
Vane,
 who were Lords of much Land here about 
Tunbridge,
 were successively invested in it, whose Names it would be too tedious and impertinent to enumerate. But to return: That this Seat was anciently destined and devoted to the Uses above recited, is very probable, be∣cause it is situated on the Verge and exterior Margent of the Forrest, and so by its commodious position, had a peculiar Aspect upon those Affairs, wherein this Chase and its Jurisdiction was concerned. In fine, after it had been subservient and mi∣nisterial for many hundred years to the successive Signory of the several Families of 
Clare, Audley,
 and 
Stafford,
 it was in the thirteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, by that infortunate person 
Edward Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 who was crushed into an heap of Ruines, by those dark and black Engins, which Cardinal 
Wolsey,
 that subtle Artificer of Mischief, had raised upon him, was with much other Land forfeited to the Crown, and Queen 
Elizabeth
 about the middle of her reign, by Royal Con∣cession made it the Demeasne of her faithful Servant Sir 
Francis Walsingham,
 princi∣pal Secretary of Estate, who dying without Issue-male, left it to his Daughter and Heir 
Frances,
 who was first matched to the Invaluable Sir 
Philip Sidney;
 secondly, to 
Robert
 Earl of 
Essex;
 and thirdly, to 
Richard Burgh
 Earl of 
Clanrickard,
 created Earl of St. 
Albans, August
 the twenty third, in the year 1628. to whose Son 
Ʋlike Burgh,
 lately Earl of St. 
Albans
 and 
Clanrickard,
 she bequeathed this Mannor of 
Somerhill.


Hilden
 is another Mannor in 
Tunbridge,
 and was, as high as I can track any Record, the possession of the Noble Family of 
Vane,
 who are written in very old Deeds, 
A Vane,
 and was certainly their ancient Seat; before, by matching with the Heir of 
Stidolfe,
 they became possessors of 
Badsell. Henry A Vane
 makes his Will in the year 1456. He was the Son of 
John A Vane,
 who flourished at this place, in the reign of 
Edward
 the third: but his Predecessors enjoyed it, as appears by Original Evidences, many years before. From 
Henry Vane
 it came over to 
John a Vane,
 whose Son 
John Vane,
 in the tenth year of 
Henry
 the seventh, conveyed it by Sale to 
Dixon,
 descen∣ded originally from the 
Dixons
 of 
Scotland,
 Gentlemen of no despicable Account in that Nation, and in their possession hath it, ever since the first purchase, been con∣stantly setled.


Dachurst, aliàs Hilden-borough,
 had the same Possessors still with 
Tunbridge,
 and being forfeited, in the thirteenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, by 
Edw. Stafford
 Duke

of 
Buckingham,
 its Demeasne was in the fourteenth year of that Prince, granced to 
William Skeffington
 Esquire, in whose Descendant the propriety is yet resident: but the Mannor it self rested in the Crown, until not many years since it was con∣veyed by the State to Colonel 
Robert Gibbons
 of 
Hole
 in 
Rolvenden.


Bardens
 and 
Hadloe
 are two little Mannors in 
Tunbridge,
 both which had Owners of that Sirname. 
John de Barden
 held the first, as the Book of 
Aide
 informs us, and paid respective 
Aide
 for it, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third: and the dateless Evidences relating to 
Hadloe,
 do assure us both of the Antiquity and Truth of the second. And in the Tenure of the first did 
Bardens
 remain, until the reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then changed its Owner, and came entirely to be possest by 
Hadloe,
 but remained not long in his Name; for 
John Hadlow
 dying without Issue, 
Alice
 his Sister married to 
John Woodward,
 be∣came his Heir; and she in her Widowhood, about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, passed away 
Bardens
 to 
John Hopdey,
 and he in the thirty eighth of 
Henry
 the sixth, alienated his Right to 
William Hextall:
 but 
Hadloe
 devolved to 
John Woodward,
 Son of 
John Woodward
 abovesaid, and he in the thirty seventh of 
Henry
 the sixth, demi∣ses all his Interess in 
Hadloe
 to 
William
 and 
Henry Hextall:
 and he the same year by Deed releases all his Right in 
Hadloe
 to 
William;
 which 
William,
 not many years after dying without Issue-male, 
Margaret
 his Sole Daughter and Heir, brought these two Mannors to be the Inheritance of her Husband 
William Wherenhall
 Esquire, whose Son 
William Whetenhall
 Esquire, about the middle of 
Henry
 the eighth, passed away 
Bar∣dens
 to 
Andrew Judde
 Esquire (who erected the Alms-houses here at 
Tunbridge
) and 
Hadloe
 to 
William Waller
 Esquire. 
Judde
 died without Issue-male, and left his Estate to 
Alice
 his Sole Heir, matched to 
Thomas Smith
 Esquire, vulgarly called 
Customer Smith,
 and he upon his Decease gave 
Bardens
 to his second Son Sir 
Thomas Smith
 of 
London,
 in whose Descendants the Title yet is resident: but 
Hadloe
 descended to 
Richard Waller,
 Son to 
William
 abovesaid, who about the forty second year of 
Elizabeth,
 alienated it to 
George Stacy,
 and he about the beginning of King 
James,
 demised it again to 
Bing,
 whose Successor Mr. 
John Bing,
 in our Remembrance passed it away to Mr. 
David Polhill
 Esquire, whose Grand-child Mr. 
David Polhill,
 upon the late Decease of that his Grand-father is now entituled to the possession of it.


Hollenden
 is the last place in 
Tunbridge
 to be taken notice of, which spreads its appendant Demeasne into the Parish of 
Leigh,
 and was in Ages of a very high Gra∣dation, parcel of the Patrimony of the ancient Family of 
Fremingham:
 for in the fifty fifth year of 
Henry
 the third, I find that 
Ralph de Fremingham
 obtained a Charter of Free-warren to several of his Mannors in 
Kent,
 in the Register of which was 
Hollenden.
 In Times of a more modern Aspect, that is, about the reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, I find it by some old Court-rols to be the 
Cheyneys,
 and there are several parcels of Land that relate to this Mannor, which are adopted into their Name, and are called 
Cheyneys
 Fields; and in this Family did the Mannor continue, until the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was alienated to 
Waller,
 to whose Inhe∣ritance it continued united, until that Age which fell within the Circle of our Fa∣thers Cognisance, and then it was passed away to 
Crittenden,
 which Family at this instant is entituled to the Signory of it. But part of the Demeasne which is spread into 
Leigh,
 was about the beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, conveyed to 
Stacy,
 whose Successor almost in our Remembrance alienated it to 
Turner,
 and he not many years since demised it to 
James Pelset.


Tuydley,
 anciently written 
Twidley,
 lies in the Hundreds of 
Wachlingstone
 and 
Twy∣ford,
 and was not worth the Consideration, were it not for 
Badsell;
 where a Fa∣mily who extracted their Sirname from hence, had long since their Habitation, from whom by a Daughter and Co-heir the Inheritance went into 
Stidulph,
 from whom the 
Stidulphs
 or 
Stidolfes
 of 
Surrey
 are originally branched out; a Noble Fa∣mily certainly, and of eminent Genealogy, there being frequent mention in that Book, which they call the Survey of the 
Lowey
 of 
Tunbridge,
 taken in the fourteenth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, of this Name and Family: but when the successive mu∣tation of Time had crumbled the Name of 
Stidolfe
 at this place into a Daughter and Heir, called 
Agnes,
 upon her espousals with 
John Vane, Badsell
 became incorpora∣ted

into the Interest and Concernment of that Family, and by a Communicative Right issuing out from this Alliance, does 
Milmay Fane
 now Earl of 
Westmerland
 entitle himself to the instant proprietie and possession of 
Tuydley
 and 
Badsell.


Kippings Crosse
 in 
Tuydley
 hath been (as appears by several old Dateless Evidences and other Monuments) for many hundred years the Seat and Inheritance of 
Kippings,
 who bore for their Coat Armour, as it appears exemplified and confirmed to 
Robert Kipping
 of 
Brenchley
 Gentleman the fifth of 
September,
 in the thirty seventh year of 
Henry
 the eighth, 
Loringeè Or and Azure upon a chief Gules A Lion passant Or langued and armed Azure.
 But this Family after such a vast continuance here and at 
Brenchley,
 not many yeart since determined in two Daughters and Co-heirs: 
Dorothy
 the eldest was married to 
Edward Darrell
 Esquire, second Son to Sir 
Robert Darrell
 of 
Calchill,
 and Mr. 
James Darrell
 fourth Son of Sir 
Robert
 above mentioned, and now secondly to 
Thomas Henshaw
 of 
Kensington
 Esquire, descended from the ancient Family of 
Hen∣shaw
 of 
Henshaw
 in 
Cheshire.

ULcomb
 in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne
 was the patrimony of 
St. Legers
 (writen in Latin Records 
de Sancto Leodegario.
) Sir 
Robert de Sancto Leodegario
 entred into 
England
 with 
Will.
 the Conquerour, and was of that high repute, that, according to the received Tradition of this Family, he with his Hand supported that Prince, when he first went out of his Ship to Land in 
Sussex;
 afterwards, when in the twentieth of that King's Government, there was an universal Survey taken of each Mans particular Demeasn, thoroughout the Nation, who was of any Account or Eminence, which we call 
Dooms-day
 Book, there is a recital of the above mentioned 
Robert de St. Leger
 to have held Lands at 
Ulcomb,
 which the Evidences of this Family do inform us, were taken from a Pagan Dane whom he before had conquered, and who inhabited at this place. 
Guy de St. Leger,
 as Mr. 
Fuller
 discovers to us in his 
Ecclesiastical History,
 was appoin∣ted by 
William
 the Conquerour to be an Assistant Knight to 
Adelmere
 one of the Monks of 
Ely. Raefe de St. Leger
 is registred in the Roll of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who accompanied 
Richard
 the first to the Siege of 
Acon,
 and, as the Inscription on his Lea∣den Shroud in the Vault of this Church does signifie, was engaged in the Holy Quar∣rel fifteen years. Another 
Rafe St. Leger,
 and 
Hugh St. Leger
 were 
Recognitores magnae Assisae
 in the second year of K. 
John.
 Sir 
Rafe de St. Leger,
 Sir 
Jo. de St. Leger,
 and Sir 
Tho. St. Leger,
 were with 
Edw.
 the first at the Siege of 
Carlaverock
 in the twenty eighth year of his Reign; and for their signal Atchievements there received the Or∣der of Knighthood. Indeed in times subsequent to this there was scarse almost any noble and generous undertaking, but the Annals of our 
English
 History represent a 
St. Leger
 concerned and interessed in it. And for their Collateral Alliances by which they became knit in Consanguinitie to several illustrious Families, none in that par∣ticular have been more Successeful then themselves: Sir 
Thomas St. Leger
 second Brother to Sir 
Rafe St. Leger
 married 
Anne Dutchesse
 of 
Exeter,
 Sister to King 
Edward
 the fourth, and so became twisted into the Family of that Prince, by a Nearness of Alli∣ance, as he had before been taken into his Bosome by a union of Friendship, by whom he had only 
Ann
 his Daughter and Heir, who was wedded to Sir 
George Manners
 L. 
Rosse;
 from whom the Earls of 
Rutland
 are in a direct Line branched out: Sir 
James St. Leger
 this mans Brother matched with 
Anne
 one of the Co-heirs of 
Thomas Boteler
 Earl of 
Ormond;
 from whom the 
St. Legers
 of the County of 
Devon
 were extracted; out of which Stem was Sir 
William St. Leger,
 who was Lord President of 
Munster
 in 
Ireland,
 one thousand six hundred forty and two: Sir 
Anthony St. Leger
 Father of Sir 
Warham,
 was Lord Deputy of 
Ireland,
 which place he managed with much of Prudence and Mag∣nanimity; his second Son Sir 
Anthony St. Leger
 Father to Sir 
Anthony St. Leger
 now of 
Wierton
 House in 
Boughton Monchensie,
 died Master of the Rolls in 
Ireland;
 which Office he discharged with a great deal of Faith and no less integrity; Thus have I in

Landskip pourtraied this noble Family, which in an undivided Chain of Descent was setled at 
Ulcomb
 from the Conquerour's Time even till of late, and then Sir 
Anthony St. Leger
 alienated his right in it, which was grown reverend by a prescription of so many Ages, to Serjeant 
Clerk
 of 
Rochester,
 Father to Mr. 
Francis Clerk,
 de∣scended from 
Henry Clerk,
 who was second Brother to Sir 
John Clerk,
 who took the Duke of 
Longuevil
 prisoner at the Battle fought between Bomy and Spours.


The Church of 
Ulcomb
 belonged to 
Christ-Church
 in 
Canterbury
 and being Snatched away was restored by K. 
Edmund
 in the year 941. And about 430 years since was made a Collegiate Church by 
Stephen Langton
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and the Head there∣of was called Arch-presbyter.


Boycot
 is another Mannor in 
Ulcomb,
 which afforded both Seat and Sirname to a Fa∣mily of that Denomination, as appears by several old Deeds, some of which are without Date, which remember 
Stephen de Boycot, John de Boycot,
 and 
Alexander Boycot,
 which last flourished here in the Reign of 
Edward
 the third, and 
Richard
 the second; and from him did it by paternal Delegation devolve to 
John Boycot;
 and he had Issue 
John Boycot
 and 
Stephen Boycot,
 one which sold his Proportion which accrued to him by the custome of Gavelkind to 
Richard Hovenden,
 and the other by the like aliena∣tion transmitted his Interest in it to 
William Adam,
 from whom it came over by Dona∣tion to 
Thomas Glover,
 as is specified in the Deed of Sale, by which the above-men∣tioned person in the first year of 
Henry
 the seventh, alienates it to 
Richard Hovenden.
 After 
Hovenden
 was crumbled away, it came by purchase to be the possession of 
Clerk
 of 
Wood-Church,
 the last of which Name which was entituled to the Inheritance was 
Humphrey Clerk
 Esquire, who in the ninteenth of Q. 
Elizabeth
 alienated it to 
Thomas Sands,
 and he in the twentieth year of the abovesaid Princess, conveyed it to the Lady 
Elizabeth Berkley,
 whose Grand-child Mr. ....... 
Berkley
 Esquire, is now proprietarie of it.


Kingsnoth
 is the last Mannor in 
Ʋlcomb:
 It was part of that Demeasn which re∣lated to the Abby of 
Feversham,
 and continued united to its patrimony, until the publick Dissolution filed it off, and then it became the Interest of the Crown, until 
Henry
 the eighth in the thirty second of his reign granted it to Sir 
Anthony St. Leger
 Knight of the Garter, Lord Deputy of 
Ireland,
 and one of his Privy Councel, whose Son Sir 
Warham St. Leger
 in the tenth year of Q. 
Elizabeth
 conveyed it to 
William Isley
 Esquire, who not long after passed it away to 
Anthony Sampson,
 who in the twenty first year of Q. 
Elizabeth
 alienated it to 
James Austin;
 and he in the year 1599 sold it to 
Robert Cranmer,
 who dying without Issue Male, 
Anne
 his Daughter and Heir brought it along with her to her Husband Sir 
Arthur Harris
 of 
Crixey
 in 
Essex,
 who upon his Decease gave it to his second Son Mr. 
John Harris
 and his Son and Heir Mr. 
Cranmer Harris
 of 
Lincolns Inne
 enjoys the instant Inheritance of it.


Ʋp-Church
 in the Hundred of 
Milton,
 was in elder Times in the Register of those Lands, Mannors, and Hereditaments, which owned the dominion of the illustrious Fa∣mily of 
Leybourn. Rog. de Leybourn
 in the fiftieth year of 
H.
 the third had a Grant to hold his Lands at 
Hartlip, Reinham,
 and 
Up-Church,
 by the fourth part of a Knights Fee, and from him did the Clew of successive Descent in a continued Track transport it to his Great Grand-child 
Juliana de Leybourne
 Widow of 
John de Hastings
 (not Father of 
Laurence de Hastings
 E. of 
Pembroke,
 as some have erroneously printed, but his Kinsman) and next of 
William de Clinton
 Earl of 
Huntington,
 whom she survived, and died possest of this Mannor in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third, and as the inquisition after her Decease informs us, without any Issue or kindred who might supersede the Interest of the Crown, by pretending a direct or Collateral Title to her Estate: so that King 
Edward
 the third by escheat became invested in this Mannor, as a Limb of the Estate thus acquired, who in the fiftieth year of his reign, setled it on the Abby of St. 
Mary Grace
 on 
Tower-hill,
 of his Foundation and Endowment; and having re∣mained treasured up in the Revenue of that Cloister, untill the general suppression, it was then plucked off, and by King 
Henry
 the eighth granted in the thirty first of his Reign to 
Thomas Green
 Esquire, whose Descendant in our Fathers memory passed away his Concernment in it to 
Apsley.




Ham, Sharpenash,
 and 
West-court,
 are three little Mannors situated within the Circuit of this Parish, and were parcel of that Patrimony, which related to the Abby of St. 
Augustins:
 which upon the Dissolution of that Fraternity (the vast Demeasn which appertained to it, being more hainous in the Eyes of 
Henry
 the eighth, than those Crimes and Offences though peradventure of a Complexion dark enough, which were charged upon the Covent;) He, I mean the Prince abovesaid, ravished them away from the patrimony of the Church, to incorporate and interweave them with the Revenue of the Crown, where their Title and proprietie was not long lodged; for K. 
Hen.
 the eighth conveyed them by Grant to 
Will. Hach,
 descended from 
Hach
 of 
Aller
 in 
Devon,
 who not long after passed them away to 
Tho. Green
 Esq; written in his Deeds, 
alià Norton:
 where, after the possession of them, had some years continued the Interest of all these Mannors, was by the Mutation of Sale, transported into 
Aldersey,
 Ancestor to Captain 
Terry Aldersey
 of 
Swanton Court
 in 
Bredgar,
 now Lord of the Fee and Signory of these above recited places.

WAldershare
 in the Hundred of 
Eastry,
 was in elder Times the Seat of an emi∣nent Family called 
Malmains. John de Malmains
 is recorded in an Ancient Roll of those Gentlentemen which entred 
England
 with 
William
 the Conquerour, and engaged with him at the Battle of 
Battle. John de Malmains,
 as Mr. 
Fuller
 in his 
Ecclesiastical History
 does represent to us was Standard Bearer to the 
Norman
 Footmen, and was joyned by 
William
 the Conquerour as an Assistant Knight to 
Otho
 one of the Monks of 
Ely. Henry Malmains
 is registred in the Bed-roll of those 
Kentish
 Gentle∣men who assisted 
Richard
 the first at the Siege of 
Acon.

 John de Malmains
 is registred in the Pipe rolls amongst those who were 
Recognitores Magnae Assisae
 in the reign of K. 
John,
 a place of that Latitude of Trust and Authority, that those who managed it were frequently selected out of the chiefest Knights and most eminent Gentlemen of the County. Sir 
Nicholas de Malmains
 was engaged with 
Edward
 the first at the Siege of 
Carlaverock
 in 
Scotland
 in the twenty eighth of his reign, and for his worthy under∣taking there received the Dignity of Knighthood, and from him did 
Waldershare
 de∣scend to 
Nicholas de Malmains,
 who died possest of this and much other Land in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 160. and from him descended 
Henry Malmains
 his Grand-child, who dying about the beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth without Issue Male left his Estate here at 
Waldershare
 to 
Agnes
 his sole Daughter and Heir matched to 
Thomas Goldwell
 of 
Great Chart:
 yet had this 
Henry
 a Kinsman called 
Thomas Malmains
 Son of 
John Malmains,
 who had a considerable share of this Mannor of 
Waldershare,
 which by his Heir General devolved to 
John Monins
 Esquire, who about the beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, purchased all that Demeasn and Interest which 
Tho. Goldwell
 was entituled to here, and so became sole Lord of 
Waldershare.
 This 
John Monins
 was descended from 
John Monins,
 who in the twentieth year of 
Edw.
 the third held Lands at 
Swink-field,
 as appeats by the Book of 
Aid,
 by the Title of Esquire, and was allied to 
William Monings
 or 
Monins,
 (for in old Records they are written so promiscuously) who was several times Knight of the Shire for 
Norfolk,
 as appears by the Record in the 
Tower,
 whose Title is 
De Expensis Militum
 in the time of 
Richard
 the second; and 
John Monins
 this Mans Son was a person of so eminent Notice in this County, that he obtained an Indulgence under the Seal of 
Sixtus
 the fourth, bearing Date 1474, to carry along with him a Priest and a portable Altar for celebration of divine Offices in his necessary Journeyings; and 
John Monins
 this Man's Grand-child, and Son of 
Robert,
 compounds with 
Tho. Hobbys
 in the twentieth year of 
Hen.
 the seventh for ten Marks as part of his Fine to be excused from being made Knight of the 
Bath
 at the creation of 
Henry
 his Son Prince of 
Wales: Edward Monins
 Esq; was Justice of the Peace for 
Kent
 the latter part of the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth: and he was Ancestor to Sir 
William Monins,
 who was made Knight and Baronet the

twenty ninth day of 
June
 in the ninth year of K. 
James
 by the Name of Sir 
William Monings
 of 
Waldershare,
 and from him is not onely this Title, but likewise the sig∣nory of this Mannor now devolved by paternal right to his Son and Heir 
Edward Monins
 Baronet.


Walmer
 is a Member of 
Sandwich,
 and so in no Hundred: It was one of those princi∣pal Seats which owned the jurisdiction and signory of the noble and spreading Family of 
Crioll,
 written frequently likewise 
Keriel.
 The first, whom I find to be possest of it, was 
Matilda de Criol
 Widow of 
Simon de Crioll,
 and she in right of Dower was in possession of it at her Death, which was in the fifty second of 
Henry
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 34. The next of this Name whom the Beams of publick Record represent to me to be possessor of it, was 
Nicholas de Crioll,
 who enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the thirty first of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 39. In Ages of a nearer Ap∣proach unto us, 
Iohn de Crioll
 in the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third died seised of it, and so did 
William Keriell
 in the first year of 
Henry
 the fifth; 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 21. and left it to his Son Sir 
John Crioll
 of 
Sarre
 in 
Thanet,
 (who, as an old Pedigree of this Family informs me) was in eminent Command under 
Henry
 the fifth in his suc∣cessful Expedition into 
France,
 having the Conduct of several 
Kentish
 Squadrons at the Battle of 
Agincourt,
 and died laden more with Honour then with Years in the ninth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and left Sir 
Thomas Crioll
 or 
Keriell,
 Knight of the Gatter, Heir both of his Estate and Virtues: of whom because our Chronicles speak so much, I shall not be silent. He was Governor of 
Gourney
 in 
Normandy,
 in the ninth year of 
Henry
 the sixth under 
John Duke
 of 
Bedford
 the Regent; not farre from which Place, he defeated the Earl of 
Britaine
 and in that discomfiture slew six Hundred, and took two Hundred Prisoners. In the fourteenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, the Duke of 
Bur∣gundy
 infested 
Crotoy
 with a Siege, which being successefully raised by the Lord 
Talbot,
 Sir 
Thomas Keriell
 assaults his Rear with that Courage, that he forced that Duke to a Disorderly Retteat, leaving his Canon and Carriages behind him, as the Reward of his Valour and Fortune. In the twenty seventh year of 
Henry
 the sixth, he was sent over into 
France
 with fifteen hundred men as a fresh supply to buoy up the sincking Affairs of the 
English
 in that Nation, with which he recovered many pieces of strength: but overlaid with Multitude in an Encounter at 
Formigney
 by the Earl of 
Clermont
 and the Constable of 
France,
 after he had with unparallel'd Testimonies of personal Cou∣rage endeavoured to preserve the Fortune of the Day, he received a Defeat; the Ene∣my buying his Victory at so dear a rate, that it almost undid the Purchaser. Lastly, his Fate cast him into that Civil Contest, which broke out between the two Houses of 
York
 and 
Lancaster,
 and being satisfied with the Justice of those principles upon which the first had engaged in Arms, became an eager Assertor of its Claim to the Diadem, and having enbarked himself with 
Richard
 Earl of 
Warwick
 then the Atlas of that Faction, in defence of it, at the second Battle of St. 
Albans
 perished in the Ruines of that Field, and by an unstained though a Calamitous Fidelity, became the great Example of Loyalty to the House of 
York.
 And he dying without Issue-male, one of his Daughters and Co-heirs, by matching with 
John Fogge
 of 
Repton
 Esquire, brought this Mannor upon the partition of the Estate between 
Fogge
 and 
Bourchier,
 who wedded the other, to be annexed to the Demeasn of that Family, and upon his De∣cease it descended to his Son 
Thomas Fogge
 Serjeant Porter of 
Callis,
 who dying with∣out Issue-male, 
Anne Fogge
 who was one of his two Daughters and Co-heirs,

 first matching with 
William Scot,
 and afterwards to 
Henry Isham,
 brought this to be parcel of the Inheritance of her second Husband; but his Son 
Edward Isham,
 about the latter end of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 concluding in 
Mary Isham
 his onely Inheritrix, she by espousing Sir 
George Perkins
 united it to his Patrimony and he setled the Reversion of it after his Wives decease upon 
Mary
 his Daughter married to Sir 
Richard Minshull
 of 
Cheshire,
 created Baron of 
Minshull
 1642, (descended from that emi∣nent Souldier 
Michael de Minshul,
 who for his glorious service performed in the Quarrel of 
Richard
 the first at the Siege of 
Acon,
 had the assignment for ever of the Crescent and Star for the Coat-Armour of this Family.) And he and the Lady 
Mary Perkins
 concurring in a joynt Sale, passed it away in the second of King 
Charles
 to 
James Hugison
 of 
Lingsted,
 whose Son 
John Hugison
 Esquire, by descendant right is entituled to the Possession of it.




Waltham
 (in the Hundreds of 
Bredge, Petham,
 and 
Stowting
) was anciently a Mem∣ber of that Revenue; which acknowledged the Interess of the Knights Templers, as appears by a Survey taken of this Mannor, in the year of 
Grace,
 one thousand one hundred and eighty, and registred in the Book styled 
de Terris Templariorum,
 which is preserved in the Remembrancers Office in the Exchequer: and in that Sur∣vey, there is mention made of 
Ivo de Haut,
 who held Lands at that Time of 
Temple Waltham,
 lying at 
Petham
 not far distant, which justifies the Antiquity of that Name in this Track. Upon the total suppression and extinction of this Order here in 
En∣gland,
 on pretence of some prodigious Crimes stuck upon it (which whether they were imaginary or real, must be discussed in that Critical Day, when the secrets of all Hearts, and the Bottome of all Secrets shall be opened;) this Mannor of 
Waltham,
 was in the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the second, by Grant invested in the Knights of St. 
John
 of 
Jerusalem,
 commonly called the Knights Hospitalers, and here in this Order it rested, until the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth: and then being dissolved, by that impetuous Tempest, which like a 
Hurricano,
 fell upon this and all other Conventual Orders in this Nation, it was swallowed up in the Revenue of the Crown, and there lay couched, till the latter part of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 and then it was, in the forty second year of her swaying the 
English
 Scepter, granted to 
John Manwaring
 Esquire, from whom by 
Hope Manwaring
 his Daughter and Heir, the Interess went to 
Humphrey Hamond:
 upon whose Decease, she was re-married to Sir 
Robert Stapylton,
 a Person who hath erected his own everlasting Tomb and Epitaph, in those exquisite Translations of his, of 
Pliny's
 Panegyrick to 
Trajan, Juvenal's
 Sa∣tyrs; and lastly, 
Strada's
 History of the Wars, and other Transactions of the Low Countries, who by purchase from his Son in Law Mr. 
Manwaring Hamond,
 holds the instant Fee-simple of it.


Eshmerfeild
 is another eminent Mannor in 
Waltham,
 and cals for some Respective Account; because in Ages of a higher pedigree, it confessed it self in the Revenual of the signal Family of 
Crioll;
 for 
Bertram de Crioll,
 possest it at his Death, which was in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first, and though he expired in a Daughter and Heir, yet it continued still in the Tenure of a younger House, until 
Bennet
 Daugh∣ter and Co-heir of Sir 
Thomas Crioll,
 who was slain at the second Battle of St. 
Al∣bans,
 brought it to her Husband 
John Fogge
 Esquire, whose Son 
Thomas Fogge,
 about the beginning of 
Henry
 the seventh, alienated his Right and Concernment in it to Sir 
Thomas Kempe,
 in which Family the Inheritance remained until the lat∣ter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was passed by Sir 
Thomas Kempe
 this mans Grandchild to 
Roger Twisden
 Esquire, whose Grandchild Sir 
Roger Twisden
 Knight and Baronet, conveyed it to Sir 
John Ashburnham:
 to whose Widow the Lady 
Ash∣burnham
 it accrued upon his Decease, as having been before by speciall Compact made part of her Dower, so that she at this instant, hath the Use of the emergent profits and income of it.


Whetacre
 is another small Mannor, that lies within the Circle of this Parish, not worth the memorial, were it not for a Family which extracted its Sirname from hence; for I find 
Nigellus de Whetacre
 mentioned in the Book of 
Aide,
 to have held Lands here, in the twentieth of 
Edward
 the third: In Times of a lower Date, that is, about the reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, I find the Family of 
Hels
 or 
Hils,
 des∣cended from the 
Hels
 of 
Hels-court
 in 
Woditon
 to be planted in the possession: and in this Name was the Interest of it constant, until the beginning of 
Edward
 the sixth, and then it was alienated to 
Prude,
 whose Successor couveyed it to Alderman 
Cockain
 of 
London,
 from whom the same Stream of Vicissitude carried it into 
Beacon.


Watringbury
 in the Hundred of 
Twiford,
 was, in Ages of a very high Gradation, the Patrimony of a Family which enjoyed that Sirname, and held not only the Mannor of 
Watringbury
 it self: but 
Chart
 and 
Fowls,
 which lie within the Precincts of this Parish likewise; and bore for their Coat-Armous 
Argent six Lionceux Rampant Sables:
 in assimilation, I believe, of the Lord 
Leybourne
 his Neighbour, who was a Person of a vast power, and no less Estate in this Track: but before the latter end of 
Henry
 the third, this Family was extinguished and vanished, and then the next Family which

stept into the possession of these places, upon the extinction of this, was the No∣ble Family of 
Leybourne
 of 
Leybourne-castle. Thomas de Leybourne
 held it at his De∣cease, which was in the first year of 
Edward
 the second, and transmitted them to his Successor 
Roger de Leybourne,
 who died seised of them, in the beginning of 
Ed∣ward
 the third, and left only one Daughter and Heir, called 
Juliana Leybourne,
 who in Relation to that vast proportion of Revenue which accrued to her upon his De∣cease, was styled the 
Infanta
 of 
Kent,
 she was first married to 
John de Hastings
 a Kinsman of 
Lawrence de Hastings
 who was Earl of 
Pembroke,
 who dying with∣out any Issue surviving by this Lady, upon his Decease she chose for her second Husband, 
William de Clinton
 Earl of 
Huntington;
 but by him likewise had no Issue as ap∣pears by the Inquisition taken after her Death, which was in forty third year of 
Ed∣ward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 57. nor could there be any discovered, that by col∣lateral Affinity to this Lady by her Fathers side could elude the Escheat, by pretend∣ing a Title to the Estate, so that it devolved to the Crown, as the Common Heir, 
Jure patronatûs,
 as the Civillians call it, by Right of patronage and protection: and King 
Edward
 the third, in the fiftieth year of his reign, granted 
Watringbury, Chart,
 and 
Fowles,
 which were parcel of the above-mentioned Revenue of 
Leybourne
 to the Abby of St. 
Mary Grace
 upon 
Tower-hill:
 in whose Revenue they lay couched till the general suppression, in the twenty ninth of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then they were by that Prince, in the thirty sixth year of his reign, granted to 
Giles Bridges,
 and 
Robert Harris,
 who immediately after passed them away to Sir 
Robert Southwell,
 from whom by as quick a Transition they went away to Sir 
Edward North,
 and he alienated them to Sir 
Martin Bowes,
 from whom they passed away to Sir 
Iohn Baker,
 who suddainly after devested himself of his Right to them, and sold them to 
Nevill de la Hay;
 where it is to be noted that these Revolutions of the Title fell out in less then thirty year. 
Nevill de la Hay
 had Issue 
George de la Hay,
 who about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 passed away 
Watringbury
 to 
Wilkinson,
 and 
Chart
 and 
Fowles
 to 
Roger Twisden
 Esquire; 
Wilkinson
 in our Fathers Memory conveyed 
Wa∣tringbury
 by Sale to Sir 
Tho. Stile
 Knight and Baronet, Father to Sir 
Tho. Stile
 Baronet the instant proprietary of it. 
Chert
 and 
Fowls,
 descended to Sir 
William Twisden
 Knight and Baronet, Father to Sir 
Roger Twisden,
 now possessor of them both, to whose Papers I owe for the latter part of my Intelligence concerning the successive Possessors of these above recited Mannors.


I had almost forgot to inform the Reader, that in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the second, 
Henry de Leybourne,
 obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at 
Wa∣tringbury;
 amongst which 
Chart
 in this Parish is particularly recited.


Westbery
 is another Mannor in this Parish, which had anciently proprietaries of that Sirname; the last of which Name was 
Iohn Westbery,
 who deceased without Issue, and so transmitted his Right in it by Testament to 
Agnes Ellis
 his Neece, and she in the twenty third year of 
Henry
 the sixth, alienated her Interess in it to 
Richard Fishbourne,
 in whom it was not long resident; for he in the thirty third year of that Prince, conveyed it by Sale to Sir 
Thomas Browne
 of 
Bechworth-castle
 in 
Surrey,
 Controller of the House, and Privy Councellor to 
Henry
 the sixth; from whom by an even Stream of Descent the Title flowed down to his Successor Sir 
Thomas Browne,
 who in the twenty fifth year of Queen 
Elizazeth,
 passed it away to 
Roger Twisden
 Esquire, Grand-father to Sir 
Roger Twisden
 Knight and Baronet, in whom the pre∣sent proprietie of this place is resident.


Canons
 is the last Mannor in this Parish. It is called so, because it anciently be∣longed to the Prior and Canons of 
Leeds;
 and, after it had for many Ages rested in the Demeasne of this Convent, it was by the Dissolution, in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, which like a general Inundation broke in upon the Patrimony of the Church, swept away: but was by Grant from that Prince suddainly after setled on the Dean and Chapter of 
Rochester,
 and made a Branch of their Revenue.


Watringbury
 had the Grant of a weekly Market on the Tuesday, and a three dayes Fair at the Feast of St. 
Iohn Baptist,
 both procured to it by 
Hugh de Leybourne,
 in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the second.




East-Well
 in the Hundred of 
Wye,
 was anciently the possession of a Family, which extracted its Sirname from hence, 
Matilda de Eastwell
 held it at her Decease, which was in the fifty second year of 
Henry
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 32. But soon after this, this Family was faded away at this place, and then it devolved to be a Limbe of that Revenue, which acknowledged the Jurisdiction and possession of 
Bertram de Crioll,
 and he held it, in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first: but his Son 
John Crioll
 dying without Issue, about the beginning of 
Edward
 the third, it came down to 
Richard de Rokesley,
 Seneschall and Governour of 
Ponthieu
 and 
Monstreul,
 as appears, 
Pat.
 1. 
Edwardi secundi,
 in the reign of 
Edward
 the second, who had married 
Joan
 Sole Daughter, and now Heir of 
Bertram de Crioll:
 but the same Vicissitude, not long after carried it off from this Name; for he went out likewise in two Daughters and Co-heirs, one of whom called 
Agnes,
 by matching with 
Thomas de Poynings
 emtombed the Name in his Family, and the Estate here at 
East-well,
 and else-where, in his Patrimony: but (as one ingeniously observes) the World it self, is but a great Ball cast down into the Aire to sport the Stars, and all the depopulations of King∣domes, and ruine of Empires, is but their pastime; so I may likewise infer, that great Families, from their tumblings and rollings, are but the mockery and disports of Time, and so it appeared here; for 
Richard
 Lord 
Poynings,
 Successor to the abovesaid 
Thomas,
 died the eleventh year of 
Richard
 the second, and left his Estate here to his Sole Daughter and Heir, 
Eleanor
 matched to 
Henry Percy
 Earl of 
North∣umberland,
 in whose right he became Lord 
Poynings,
 and so 
Eastwell
 became linked to his Revenue, and dwelt in this Name, and supported the Signory of 
Percy,
 un∣till the Fate of Sale dissodged it; for in the twenty third year of 
Henry
 the eighth, 
Henry
 Earl of 
Northumberland
 passes it away to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney, William Walsing∣ham,
 and 
William Fitz Williams,
 and they not long after conveyed it to Sir 
Christopher Hales,
 Attorney General to 
Henry
 the eighth, and he died possest of it, in the thirty third year of that Prince, and left it to his Son Sir 
James Hales,
 who not long after alienated it to Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 Chancellour of the Court of Augmen∣tations, who erected almost all that stupendious Fabrick, which now so obliges the Eye to Admiration, and left it to Sir 
Thomas Finch,
 who had married 
Katharine
 his Daughter and Co-heir, a Gentleman who merited a calmer Fate, and a Nobler Tomb; for after many gallant Archievements performed at 
Newhaven
 in 
France,
 he suffered Shipwrack in his return to 
England,
 and left it to his Son Sir 
Moile Finch,
 who very much inlarged 
Eastwell-court,
 with both sumptuous elegant and conveni∣ent Additaments, and left it in Dower to his Widow 
Elizabeth Finch,
 Daughter and Heir of Sir 
Thomas Heneage
 first created Viscountess 
Maidstone
 by King 
James,
 and after Countess of 
Winchelsey,
 in the year 1638. by King 
Charles:
 from whom both the Honour, and 
East-well
 descended to her Son 
Thomas
 Earl 
Wenchelsey,
 and from him to his Son, the Right Honorable 
Heneage Finch
 now Earl of 
Winchelsey,
 and Vis∣count 
Maidston.


Since I am so happily engaged to a Discourse of this eminent Family of 
Finch,
 I shall discover in Landskip the deep Antiquity of their first Extraction. They were originally descended from 
Henry Fitz-Herbert,
 Chamberlain to King 
Henry
 the first, who married the Daughter and Heir of Sir 
Robert le Corbet,
 and had Issue by her a Son named 
Herbert,
 and he was Father to 
Herbert Fitz-Herbert,
 who by his first Wife 
Lucy
 Daughter and Co-heir of 
Milo
 Earl of 
Hereford,
 and Lord High Consta∣ble of 
England,
 had Issue a Son named 
Peter Fitz-Herbert,
 from whom the 
Herberts
 Earls of 
Pembroke
 originally issued out, and by his second Wife 
Matilda
 (after his Deeease, remarried to the Lord 
Columbers
) he had Issue 
Matthew Fitz-Herbert,
 who was one of the 
Magnates
 or Barons, at the compiling of 
Magna Charta,
 and was one of the powerful Partisans of King 
John,
 at the making the accord between that Prince and his Barons, at 
Running-Mead,
 between 
Windsor
 and 
Stanes;
 his Son likewise called 
Matthew Fitz-Herbert,
 was the fourth Baron mentioned in the Roll of that Parliament, which was convened at 
Tewksbury.
 The alteration of this Name into 
Finch,
 was about the tenth of 
Edward
 the first, at which Time 
Herbert Fitz-Herbert
 purchased the Mannor of 
Finches
 in 
Lidde,
 of which being entire Lord, as he was not of 
Netherfeild,
 he assumed his Sirname from that, as many other Fa∣milies

fell in that Age, under the same Mutation, and borrowed Sirnames from those places which were wholly under their possession and Signory. In the eighth year of 
Edward
 the second, there was a 
Supersedeas
 issued out, mentioning that 
Herbert Fitz-Herbert,
 called 
Finch,
 was a Ward, in the twenty eighth year of 
Ed∣ward
 the first, and so could not personally serve with the King in his Wars in 
Scotland,
 and therefore was released of his Escuage for all his Estate in 
Kent
 and 
Sussex,
 which together with some of the ancient Patrimony, and several Knights Fees at 
Nether∣feild
 in 
Sussex,
 and elsewhere, are not yet departed from this Noble Family.


Westwell
 in the Hundred of 
Calchill,
 was confirmed to the Monks of 
Christ-church
 in 
Canterbury,
 for a supply in their Diet, in the year 1241. But it seems they were questioned, 
Quo Warranto
 they possest this Mannor, and after a Solemn Decision, 
per patriam,
 it is affirmed and attested in the Confirmation of the abovesaid Prince, that it was enstated upon them by his Predecessors, and continued afterwards un∣questionably parcel of the Demeasne of the Cloister abovesaid, until it was resigned by the Monks of 
Christ-church,
 into the Hands of 
Henry
 the eighth, and so it rested in the Crown, until not many years since, it was granted to Sir 
Nic. Tuston
 of 
Hothfield.
 The Parsonage anciently belonged to the Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 until 
Thomas Arundell
 the Arch-bishop gave it, in the year 1397. to the Monks of 
Christ∣church,
 to counterpoise those vast expences which they were to be at in re-erecting the Nave or Body of the Cathedral, (called 
Aulam Ecclesiae
 by 
Eadmerus
) which 
Si∣mon de Sudbury
 plucked down, and had intended that it should like a Phoenix, have rose more glorious out of its Ashes: but was intercepted in his Design by a suddain Death, being beheaded by 
Wat Tiler,
 and the confluence of his impious and bar∣barous Complices. This Church thus appropriated, was confirmed to the Monks abovesaid, in the year 1400. by King 
Henry
 the fourth, and upon the suppression was re-enstated upon the Dean and Chapiter of 
Christ-church
 by 
Henry
 the eighth.


Ripley-court
 is a Seat of good Antiquity in this Parish, and more eminent, be∣cause it afforded a Sirname to Gentlemen of good Ranke in this Track, of which Number was 
Richard de Ripley,
 who died seised of this Mannor, in the thirtieth year of 
Edward
 the first, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 91. and in an old Deed is called 
Miles Ar∣chiepiscopi,
 that is, he held this Mannor of the Arch-bishop by Knights Service: but before the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, this Family was vanished, and then the 
Brockhuls
 and 
Idens
 succeeded in the possession: the last of which was a Family of great Antiquity, and no lesse Revenue, about 
Iden
 in 
Sussex,
 and 
Rolvenden
 in this County. For in the year 1280. as appears by a Fine levied that year; 
John
 the Son of 
Thomas de Iden,
 passes away Lands to 
John de More.
 And of this Family was 
Alexander Iden
 Esquire, Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the thirty fourth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, who in the twenty eighth year of that Prince, slew 
Jack Cade,
 who had borrowed the disguised Person of 
Mortimer,
 excited thereunto, as was the Opinion of those Times, by the Suggestions of 
Richard
 Duke of 
Yorke,
 to fathom the Peo∣ples Affections to that man, in the strength of whose Title he intended in the future to claim the 
English
 Diadem. But the Attempts of 
Cade
 being disappointed by the formerly infatuated, but now disenchanted Multitude's deserting of him, who be∣gan to risent his Fraud and Imposture upon their total Dissipation, shrowded him∣self in some of those Grounds which belonged to 
Ripley-court,
 and lay not far distant from 
Hothfeild,
 and were then in the Tenure of 
VVilliam Iden
 Justice of the Peace, and Father of the abovesaid 
Alexander:
 where being discovered, he was by that Worthy Person, offered up a Sacrifice to the Justice of 
Henry
 the sixth. But I have digressed, I now return: After this Seat had for so many Descents been the Re∣sidence of this Family, and the Cradle and Seminary of many Worthy Persons, who had been subservient and ministerial to the Honour and Interess of this County, by their Magnanimity and Prudence; it went away from 
Iden
 by Sale to 
Darell;
 and 
George Darell,
 in the last year of 
Edward
 the sixth, conveyed it to 
Baker,
 Ancestor to Mr. ...... 
Baker
 of 
VVindsor,
 now proprietary of it.


Diggs-court
 is another eminent Seat in this Parish, which was the Mansion of the Noble Family of 
Diggs
 or 
Digge,
 who promiscuously writ themselves in elder Times sometimes of 
Barham,
 and sometimes of 
VVestwell,
 as appears by many of their an∣cient,

Evidences and other Muniments yet extant. In the reign of 
Edward
 the third, there was one 
Adomarus de Digge,
 who frequently writ himself of 
Westwell:
 but whe∣ther it were he that was the Judge, or not, I cannot positively aver. In fine, after this place had for many Ages acknowledged the Signory of this Family, it came down to 
John Digge,
 in whom the Male-line ended; so that his Female Heir being wed∣ded to 
Henry Aucher,
 annexed it to the Revenue of that Family, and from him hath the Title by a Thread of many years, been guided down to Mr. ...... 
Aucher.


Dean-court
 may be registered likewise in the Catalogue of the principal Mannors of this Parish. It was in Times of elder prescription the Inheritance of 
Hussie,
 who likewise was entituled to the possession of 
Dean-court
 in 
Wingham,
 now the Mansion of the 
Oxendens,
 by purchase from this Family. 
Henry Hussie,
 a man of great pow∣er, as appears by that large Estate he was Lord of, both at 
Wingham, Lenham, Bough∣ton, Malherbe,
 and elsewhere, died possest of this Mannor, in the eighteenth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Numb.
 36. and from him did it in an even and an un∣divided Current glide along in this Name, until the latter end of King 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was passed away by Sale to 
Milan,
 in which Family the proprie∣ty of this place is now resident.


Nash-court
 is the next place in 
Westwell,
 that cals for our Survey; in old Deeds I find a Family that sometimes writ 
At Ash,
 and sometimes 
Nash,
 into which the for∣mer Name resolved, who were possessors of it: In Times of a lower Step, that is, in the thirty second year of 
Edward
 the third, as appears by the close Roll of that year, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 94. 
Alanus de Hanekin
 held it: but before the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, this Family had quitted the possession by Sale to 
Brockhull
 of 
Calchill,
 and was not long after, that is, about the twelfth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, by 
Henry Brockhull,
 conveyed to 
John Darell
 Esquire, Sheriff of 
Kent,
 in the ele∣venth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, and Brother of Sir 
William Darell,
 under-Treasurer of 
England,
 and in this Name it was permanent, until the last year of 
Edward
 the sixth, and then it went away by Sale to 
Sharpe
 of 
Nin-house
 in great 
Chart,
 and hath been now for five Descents resident in that Family.


Beamonston,
 vulgarly called 
Beamston,
 is partly situated in 
West-well,
 and partly spread into 
East-well:
 but the greatest part of the Demeasne is circumscribed within the Bounds of this Parish. And in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, as appears by the Book of 
Aide,
 was held by 
Thomas at More,
 at making the Black Prince Knight. But before the fourth year of 
Henry
 the fourth, this Family was extin∣guished; for at the Marriage of 
Blanch
 that Prince's Daughter, as appears by the Roll of 
Blanch
 Lands kept in the Exchequer, 
John Amias
 was possest of it, and paid respective 
Aide
 for it, as having purchased it of 
At-More:
 and in this Name did it reside, until the reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then it was conveyed by Sale to 
John Moile
 Esquire, Father to Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 who left this, with much other Land to 
Katharine
 his Daughter and Co-heir matched to Sir 
Thomas Finch,
 in Right of which Alliance, it is now devolved to be the Inheritance of his great Grand-child 
Hencage Finch
 the instant Earl of 
Winchelsey.


Perytowne
 lies likewise within the Limits of 
Westwell,
 and is registered in the Ca∣talogue of those Lands that 
William de Aldon
 died possest of, in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third; and continued chained to the Inheritance of this Family, until about the twenty seventh of 
Henry
 the sixth, it was passed away with much other other Land to Cardinal 
Kempe,
 who setled it in the twenty eighth year of that Prince, on his newly erected Colledge of 
Wye,
 and rested there until the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was resigned into the Hands of that Prince, and he in the thirty eighth year of his reign, granted it to 
Thomas Cawarden
 or 
Carden
 Es∣quire, and he not long after conveyed it by Sale to Sir 
John Baker
 of 
Sisingherst,
 whose Successor Sir 
John Baker
 Baronet, hath this present year 1657. alienated it to 
Na∣thaniel Powell
 of 
Ewherst
 in 
Sussex
 Esquire.


Woditon
 or 
Wolton,
 is the last place of any Note in 
Westwell:
 It was originally par∣cel of the Inheritance of a Family called 
Wolton
 or 
Woditon. Ivo de Woditon
 held it in the year 1236. and left it to his Son 
John de Wolton,
 who had Issue 
Richard de Wodi∣ton
 or 
VVolton,
 a man of principal Note, in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, who held both this Mannor, and 
VVoditon
 by 
Berham,
 which he held of the Arch-Bishop

of 
Canterbury
 by Knights Service at making the Black Prince Knight. And in this Man's Successors did the Propriety constantly reside until the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then some part of it was conveyed to 
John Hampton,
 and he about the beginning of 
Edward
 the fourth passed it away to 
Richard Rasel,
 who died possest of it, as appears by his Will in the twentieth of that Prince; but there was some part remained unsold, until 
William Wolton
 dying 1540, ordered it by his Deed to be passed away to Feoffees in Trust to discharge Debts, which accordingly was performed and the Remainder conveyed to 
Rasell,
 in the Descendants of which Name and Family the entire proprietie is at this instant remaining.


Werehorne
 in the Hundreds of 
Ham
 and 
Blackbourne,
 was partly under the Jurisdiction of the Church, and partly under the Signory of temporal and Lay Proprietaries: that Moitie of it which was of secular Interest, belonged to a Family called 
Bedford. Rich. de Bedford
 obtained a Grant of a Market to it weekly on the 
Tuesday,
 and a Fair of three days continuance at the Feast of St. 
Matthew,
 as appears 
Cart.
 52. 
Henrici tertii Memb.
 12, which was renued and confirmed to the abovesaid Person in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the first; and he in the seventeenth year of that Prince died possest of it, as is manifest, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 20. But after him it was of no long date in the Tenure of this Family; for in the reign of 
Edward
 the second, I find it in the possession of 
Hugh de VVindlesore
 or 
VVindsor;
 but was not long chained to their Patrimony neither; for about the beginning of 
Edward
 the third, it was alienated to 
Moraunt
 of 
Moraunts Court,
 but about the beginning of 
Richard
 the second, Sir 
Thomas Morant
 (Son of 
VVilliam Moraunt
 Sheriff of 
Kent
 the twelfth and thirteenth year of 
Edward
 the third, to whom that Prince issued out a Mandate, that but one Bell should be rang in any Steeple towards the Sea-Coast in 
Kent
) determined in a Female Heir, who was matched to 
James Peckham
 of 
Yaldham
 Sheriff of 
Kent
 the third and twelfth of 
Richard
 the second, and was as the private evidences of this Family inform me, originally descended from 
Hugh de Peckham,
 who was Constable of the Castle of 
Rochester
 under K. 
John
 in the first year of his reign; and he in her right became entituled to that Interest 
Moraunt
 had in this place: and in this Family it remained until those Times which approached near the Confines of our Grand-fathers remembrance, and then it was passed away to 
Ellis;
 from whence in Opposition to the other Moitie which was of spiritual Concernment it was called 
Werehorne Ellis,
 and from this Fa∣mily not many years since it was carried off by Sale to 
Tufton,
 in right of which purchase the right honourable 
John
 Earl of 
Thanet
 is now invested in the possession of it.


The other Moietie which belonged to the Church, was given in the year of 
Grace
 1010, by 
Elphegus
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury
 to the Monks of 
Christ-Church,
 and was for the provision of their Garments. And if you will discover how this was rated in the twentieth year of 
VVilliam
 the Conquerour, the Record of 
Dooms-day
 Book will discover: 
In Limwarled,
 says the Note, 
& in Hundred de Hamme habent Monachi Sanctae Trinitatis de vestitu eorum
 1. 
Manerium de VVerehorne
 1. 
Sulling, & est appretiatum LXs.
 This Mannor being by the Monks and Prior of the Convent aforesaid sur∣rendred into the Hands of 
Henry
 the eighth in the twenty ninth year of his reign, it lay couched in the Demeasn of the Crown, until the seventh year of K. 
James,
 and then it was by Grant passed away to 
Tho. Paget,
 and 
Thomas Twisden
 who in opposition to the other Moity which was of temporal Interess, called this, 
Werehorn Twisden:
 and they not long after passed it away to Sir 
Thomas Tufton,
 Grand-father to the right ho∣nourable 
John
 Earl of 
Thanet
 the instant Possessor of it.


Tinton
 in 
VVerehorne
 was a Mannor which anciently belonged to the Priory of 
Horton
 near 
Hieth;
 but upon the suppression all its Demeasn being annexed to the Crown, this was lodged there until the beginning of K. 
James,
 and then it was by that Prince conveyed by Grant to Sir 
VVilliam Sidley
 of the Frierie in 
Alresford,
 Grand-father to Sir 
Charles Sidley
 Baronet the present Lord of the Fee.


Capell
 in this Parish gave Seat and Sirname to a Family so called, whose Demeasn lay spread into 
Ivie-Church, Linton, Boxley, Horsmonden, Capell
 by 
Brechley, Capell
 in the Isle of 
Shepey
 and this Parish. 
John de Capell
 flourished here in the reign of 
Henry
 the third, who was (as appears by the 
Leiger
 Book of 
Boxley
) an eminent Benefactor to

that Covent; and from him descended Sir 
VVilliam at Capell,
 an eminent Knight of this County, in the reign of 
Edward
 the third and 
Richard
 the second, who left it to his Son 
Richard at Capell:
 and he dying without Issue, in the fifteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, Sir 
John Orlanston
 in right of his Wife, who was his Sister and Co-heir entred upon his Inheritance at this place, and left it to his Son 
Richard Orlanston
 Esq; who deceased without Issue in the seventh year of 
Henry
 the fifth: and so upon the Division of the Estate, 
VVilliam Scot
 who had espoused 
Joan
 one of the Sisters and Co-heirs, was planted in the Inheritance of this place; and from whom it is now devolved to be the possession of 
Edward Scot
 of 
Scots-Hall
 Esquire.


Ham
 is another eminent Mannor in this Parish which gives Name to the whole Hundred, and was, as high as the Ray of any Intelligence will guide us to discover, folded up in the paternal Demeasn of the ancient Family of 
Orlanston. VVilliam de Orlanston
 obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Lands at 
Orlanston, VVerehorne,
 and other places, in the fifty first of 
Henry
 the third, and being fenced in with this Immunity, it came along by the Steps of Several Descents to 
Richard Orlanston
 Son of Sir 
John Orlanston,
 who dying without Issue in the seventh year of 
Henry
 the fifth, as is manifest, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 16. 
Joan
 one of his two Sisters matched to 
William Scot
 of 
Scots-Hall;
 and 
Margaret
 the second, wedded to 
William Parker
 of 
Parkers
 in this Parish, became his two Co-heirs: and upon breaking the Estate by mutual Division into parcels, this in the second year of 
Henry
 the sixth was annexed to the Patrimony of 
Scot,
 and from him did the Thread of successive Descent transmit to Mr. 
Edward Scot
 of 
Scots-Hall
 Esquire, who still by paternal right enjoys the Inheritance of it.


Parkers
 is another Mannor which next summons our remembrance, which afforded a Sirname, as it gave an Habitation to a Family so styled. 
Edward Parker
 held Lands in 
Werehore, Westerham,
 and other places at his Decease, which was in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the second, as appears, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 1.14. and in this Name was the Title and Inheritance constant until the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then I find by several Court-rolls one 
John Engham
 to be fixed by purchase in the possession: and in this Family did it remain uninterrupted until the beginning of K. 
James,
 and then it was by Sale conveyed to 
Taylor,
 who not long after demised it to 
Collins;
 from whom not long since it came by purchase to 
Squire,
 and he not many years since passed it away to Dr. ...... 
Kingsley
 Arch-Deacon of 
Canterbury,
 in whose Descendants the Proprietie of it, is still resident.


Hampton Coclescombe
 is the last place considerable in 
Werehorne;
 which gave Name originally to a Family which here had their Habitation, and likewise were possessors of much Land at 
Westwell,
 and other places; and having lived here many Descents, the possession of this place at last devolved to 
John Hampton,
 who about the latter end of 
Edward
 the fourth passed it away to 
John May
 of 
Bibrook:
 whose successor 
John May
 concluding about the latter end in a Daughter and Heir called 
Alice
 matched to 
John Edolph
 it came to be the Inheritance of that Family; but did not long con∣fess the Signory of it; for this 
John Edolph
 deceased without Issue-male, and left it to his sole Daughter 
Elizabeth
 matched to 
William Wilcock,
 who expiring likewise in two Female Heirs, 
Martha
 matched to 
Edward Ratcliff
 Doctor of Physick, and Physitian to Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and K. 
James;
 and the second matched to 
William Andrews,
 they divided this Mannor as parcel of his Inheritance. 
William Andrews
 in the twenty ninth year of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 demised his proportion to 
Rowland Bridges
 and 
Robert Philipson.
 And 
Edward Radcliff
 alienated that part of it which accrued to him in the forty third year of Q. 
Elizabeth
 to 
Edward Rolt
 and 
Andrew Mersh.


Westerham
 gives Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is placed, and was in elder Times the patrimony of a Family called 
Camville,
 which was of some eminence in this Track. 
William de Camville,
 and 
G. de Camville
 entred 
England
 with 
VVilliam
 the Conquerour. 
Thomas de Camville
 was one of the 
Recognitores magnae Assisae
 in the seventh year of K. 
John:
 and 
Geffrey de Camville
 was with 
Edward
 the first at the Siege of 
Carlaverock
 in 
Scotland;
 in the twenty eighth year of his reign, and there received the Order of Knighthood, and here this Family concluded: for afterwards I find this Mannor in the Hands of the Abbot of 
VVestminster,
 who obtained a Market weekly to be held at this place on the 
Munday
 and a Fair yearly upon the Vigil, the

day, and day after the Nativity of our Lady, as appears, 
Pat.
 25. 
Edwardi tertii Num.
 32. And here it remained with their revenue, untill the Suppression of that Cloi∣ster in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth; and then being rent away by that Tempest, it was in the thirty second year of that Prince, granted to Sir 
Iohn Gresham,
 which Con∣cession was again confirmed to the Lady 
Beatrix Gresham,
 Widow of Sir 
Thomas Gresham
 his Son by Queen 
Elizabeth,
 from whom it is now devolved to 
Marmaduke Gresham
 Esq; the Heir apparent of the Family.


Broxham
 is a place of eminent Account in this Parish. 
Iohn de Insula
 or 
Isley,
 was Lord of this Mannor, and obtained a Charter of Free-warren here, in the ele∣venth year of 
Edward
 the second. After the 
Isleys
 were gon out, the 
Ashways
 suc∣cessively stept into the possession. 
Stephen de Ashway
 obtained a Licence to inclose a Park here in the forty first year of 
Edward
 the third, the Characters and Reliques of which are not so generally demolished and disparked by Time, but that they are still obvious to a Curious eye▪ yet this Priviledge could not fix it long in this Family; for about the latter end of 
Richard
 the second, I find it by Sale cast into the possession of 
Edward
 Lord 
Clinton,
 who held it at his Decease, which was in the first year of 
Henry
 the fourth, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 16. But here likewise the Title was as volatile and transitory; for about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, 
Iohn
 Lord 
Clinton
 passed it away to 
Thomas Squerie,
 who was Lord of 
Squeries-court
 in this Parish, and was des∣cended from 
Iohn de Squerie:
 whom I find by some old Evidences to have lived at 
Westerham,
 in the Reign of 
Henry
 the third, and it is possible, either erected or very much augmented the Seat called 
Squeries-court.
 The Arms 
viz. a Squirrel brousing on a Hasell-nut,
 are depicted in very ancient coloured Glasse in 
Westerham-church:
 but this 
Thomas
 above-mentioned, dying in the seventeenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, without Issue-male, 
Margaret
 his eldest Daughter matched to Sir 
William Cromer,
 and 
Dorothy
 his youngest, wedded to 
Richard Mervin
 of 
Fontels
 in 
Wiltshire,
 became his two Coheirs: and upon the division of the estate, 
Squeries-court
 and 
Broxham
 were annexed to the patrimony of 
Cromer,
 in which Family they made their aboad until the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth; and then 
VVilliam Cromer
 Esquire, having by some Delinquencie forfeited them to the Crown, that Prince granted them to 
Thomas Ca∣warden
 or 
Carden
 Esquire; from which Family about the middle of Queen 
Elizabeths
 reign, they went off by Sale to 
Beresford,
 who almost in our memory sold 
Squeries-Court
 to Sir 
George Stroud,
 and he some few years since, alienated it to 
Thomas Lambert
 Esquire, who hath lately demised it to Mr...... 
Leech:
 but 
Broxham
 was conveyed to Mr. 
Tho. Petley
 of 
Ʋilston,
 whose Grandchild Mr. ..... 
Petley
 is the Heir apparent of it.


Well-street
 and 
Gaysam
 in this Parish, did anciently confess the two Families of 
At∣well
 and 
Shelley
 for its proprietaries. 
William Atwell
 held 
Wellstreet,
 as appears by an ancient Court-roll, in the thirty fifth of 
Edward
 the third, and 
Thomas Shelley
 in the forty sixth year of the same Monarch, settles 
Gaysam
 by Testament on 
Thomas
 his Son and Heir, who in the eighth year of 
Richard
 the second, conveys it to his Son 
Thomas Shelley,
 whose Descendant about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, demised it to 
John Potter;
 and his Successor about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth, purchased 
VVell∣street
 of the Heirs of 
Cothull,
 and is in the List of five of this Family who lye bu∣ried in 
Westerham-church,
 and this Branch of the Name here, was descended from 
Iohn Potter,
 who held Lands at 
Dertford
 the twelfth of 
Edward
 the second, and whose posterity continued Lords of these two places, untill the Beginning of King 
James,
 and then ...... 
Potter
 dying without Issue-male, his only Daughter and Heir brought them to be the Inheritance of Sir 
Iohn Rivers
 of 
Chafford,
 who not many years since, demised his Interest in 
Well-street,
 to Mr. 
Thomas Smith
 of 
Milk-street
 in 
London
 Scrivener.


Valons
 in this Parish was formerly the Mansion of a Family called in old datelesse Deeds 
de Valoniis,
 and in English 
Valons:
 but the greatest Honor which accrued to it, was, that 
Islip
 Abbot of 
VVestminster,
 bought it in the reign of 
Henry
 the seventh of 
Casinghurst,
 a Family which had been possest of it many Descents before, and gave it to his Servant 
VVilliam Middleton,
 who much improved it with Building. And in his Family it was resident untill the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was conveyed to 
James Verseline
 descended out of 
Flanders,
 who gave it with his Daugh∣ter 
Anne Verseline,
 to 
Peter Manning,
 from which Family not many years since it

passed away to Mr. 
Randall Manning
 of 
London,
 whose Son and Heir Mr. 
Thomas Manning
 is now in the enjoyment of it.


Werd
 or 
Werth
 in the Hundred of 
Eastry
 is a Parish if you consider it in its precincts, but narrow; if in position, low and unhealthful, or, if again in its number of Com∣municants, not considerable; but yet there are two places within the Ambuts and Boundaries of it which claim some consideration. The first is the Mannor of 
San∣downe,
 which was anciently the 
Perots,
 who held this Mannor as the private Deeds of this Name and Family inform me, as high as the Reign of 
Henry
 the third. 
Thomas de Perot
 died possest of it in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 31. and then it was found fenced in, and fortified with these priviledges; It had 
Infangthef
 and 
Outfangthef, Toll
 and 
Theam, Sac
 and 
Soc, Tumbrell
 and 
Pillory
 and other Franchises of the like Complexion; but after this, the Tenure was but of a brief Duration in this Name; for the Female Heir of 
Perot
 brought this Mannor with much other Land to 
Langley
 of the County of 
Warwick,
 and about the Reign of 
Henry
 the fifth there was a match between this Family and 
Peyton
 of the County of 
Cambridge,
 which match at length brought this Mannor to descend to this Family. For 
Edward Langley
 of 
Knolton
 Esquire, deceasing about the beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth with∣out Issue; Sir 
Robert Peyton
 of 
Peyton
 Hall entred upon this and other Lands as his Heir at Law; and he assigned it to his second Son 
John Peyton
 Esquire, from whom it is now descended to Sir 
Thomas Peyton
 Baronet, the instant proprietary of it.


Before I leave this Discourse of 
Sandowne,
 I must inform the Reader that the Fa∣mily of 
Peyton
 above mentioned and that of 
Ufford
 were primitively one, and bore the same paternal Coat, were known by the same Name, and were both deduced from the same Root and Original,

 onely 
Peyton
 was the elder House. Now the ground on which the Mutation of the Name was established, was briefly this; 
John de Peyton
 flourished in the reign of 
Henry
 the second, and left four Sons; whereof the three eldest were named 
John, Robert,
 and 
John:
 to 
John
 the eldest, he gave his Mannor of 
Peyton
 lying extended into 
Stoke Neyland, Boxford,
 and 
Ramsholt
 Parishes in 
Suffolk:
 to 
Robert
 his second Son he gave his Mannor of 
Ufford
 lying in 
Suffolk
 likewise, who altered his Name from 
Peyton,
 and assumed that of 
Ufford,
 a Name borrowed from that Signory of which he was become newly possessor, and from him the Name of 
Ufford
 was communi∣cated to the Earls of 
Suffolk
 and other persons of eminent Repure in those Generations wherein they flourished. 
John de Peyton
 the third Brother, by Deed without Date demises all his Interest in 
Boxford
 to his elder Brother 
John de Peyton
 (by that Name he there calls him:) which justifies nor only the Antiquity but the Seniority of this Family of 
Peyton
 before that of 
Ufford.
 And from 
John de Peyton
 the elder above mentioned are the 
Peytons
 of 
Cambridgeshire,
 and Sir 
Tho. Peyton
 of 
Knolton
 Baronet ori∣ginally descended.


Lidde
 in ancient Records written 
Hlyden
 is a second Mannor in 
Werd
 of considera∣ble Account, ever since it was given at the Request of 
Janibert
 the Arch-Bishop by K. 
Offa
 in the year 874 to the Monks of 
Christ-Church
 (as the Records of that Church discover to me) under the Notion of three Sullings or Ploughlands. And the Instrument which confirmed this Donation, was signed with the Marks that is Crosses of 
Offa
 the King, 
Janibert
 the Arch-Bishop, 
Kenedrith
 the Queen, three other Bishops, five other Abbots, Duke 
Edbald,
 and eleven other principal Persons or Noblemen. And that this was the manner of Signature in elder Times, that is, the affixing of Crosses to all publick Instruments and other original Donations, is most certain; For Sealing came into 
England
 with 
Edward
 the Confessor, who being bred up in 
Normandy,
 in which Province, and in 
France
 the Use of affixing Seals to Deeds had been in Use long before his Time, introduced that Custome and way of Signa∣ture into this Nation, as being more conspicuous and distinguishable than that of Crosses, or those other wayes of confirming of Grants of Land, either to the Church or to secular Uses, which was either 
per Collocationem Gladii seu Cultelli supra Altare,
 by the placing or laying a Sword or Knife upon the Altar, whereby those which did make Donations of Land did tacitly insinuate that their Honour was involved in their Conscience, or else 
per Traditionem Surculi vel stipitis,
 which Custome is yet observed in our Copy-hold Land, where Surrenders are made by delivery of a Turfe, Twig, or

white Wand. But sealing with Coats of Arms, was not brought in, untill the reign of 
Edward
 the first, but were borne by persons of Honor on their Tabards or Sur∣coats: two Examples of which I have seen, one of 
William Warren
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 who in the second year of 
Henry
 the second, sealed with the Figure of a 
Chivaler on Horseback;
 his Caparisons, Tabard, and Shield, being all 
Checquee,
 the paternal Coat of this Family; the other was of 
Richard Curzon
 of 
Croxall
 in 
Derbyshire,
 who in the reign of King 
John,
 stands in a Window pourtrayed in his Surcoat, surmounted with a 
Bend,
 charged with a 
Martlet.
 And this was done in Imitation of the Heralds, who wore the Arms of those Princes they serv
d on their Tabards, as Bad∣ges to distinguish them from the Heralds of other Princes, either in the Time of War or Peace. Indeed Seals in higher Ages, were of that sacred Estimate, that be∣ing lost, they were decryed by the owners, least they might be affixed to any surrep∣titious Instrument, which might prejudice either their Fame or Estate. And in the interval of their Absence or Losse, the Owners abovesaid were accustomed to Seal with the Seal of the Bishop of the Diocess, or else with that of the next adjacent Abbot, all Deeds and Instruments, either of Publick or private Interess. But to re∣turn: this Donation of 
Offa's,
 though thus secured and strengthned, could not shel∣ter this Mannor, from the Rage of ahat Tempest, which, in the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, like a Whirlwind caught it up in the Patrimony of the Church, and drop'd it into the Revenue of the Crown, where it lay untill Queen 
Elizabeth,
 in the Beginning of her Raign, passed it away by Grant to 
William Lovelace
 Esquire, Ser∣jeant at Law, whose Son Sir 
William Lovelace,
 not long after, demised it by Sale to Sir 
John Smith,
 Grand-father to 
Philip
 Viscount 
Strangford,
 who now enjoys it.


Wickham Brews
 in the Hundred of 
Downhamford,
 distinguished from other places of that Name, by the Addition of the Sirname of 
Brews,
 which Family were Lords thereof. In the twentieth year of 
William
 the Conquerour, 
Odo
 Bishop of 
Baion
 and Earl of 
Kent,
 held this place of the Gift of his half Brother which was that Prince; and 
Trendle Park
 adjoyning there, was a Composition between the Arch-bishop and this Man, for certain Land of the said Arch-bishop, to be inclosed and included within the said Park at 
Trendley:
 which signifies thus much unto us, that 
Woodstock
 which boasts it self, to be the first inclosed Park of 
England,
 was not so ancient as this at 
Trendley.
 In Times of a more modern Character, that is, in those which commence from the reign of 
Henry
 the third, it acknowledged the 
Brewses
 Barons of 
Brember
 in 
Sussex
 to be its proprietaries, who engrafted their own Name upon it, which hath sprouted out, and flourished upon it untill this Day. 
William de Brewosa
 or 
de brewe
 held it, and was several times summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron, in the reign of King 
Edward
 the first, and 
Edward
 the second, and dyed in the ninth year of the last Prince, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 204. After this Family had deserted the possession, which was about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the third, it became the Inheritance of many of the most eminent Nobility of this Kingdome. I shall represent them out of some ancient Court-rolls in a Compendious Series. 
Edmund Plantagenet
 Earl of 
Kent
 held it in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the third. 
William Longspey
 had it in the the twentieth year of the abovesaid Prince, and paid an auxiliary supply for it at making the Black Prince Knight. 
John
 Earl of 
Kent
 dyed seised of it in the twenty sixth year of 
Edw.
 the third. 
Thomas Holland
 Earl of 
Kent,
 and 
Joan
 his Wife, Sister and Coheir of the abovementioned Earl, were possest of it in the thirty fifth year of 
Edward
 the third. 
Lucie
 Wife of 
Edmund Holland
 Earl of 
Kent,
 was seised of it in the second year of 
Henry
 the sixth. After whom it devolved to 
Edmund Mortimer
 Earl of 
March,
 and he held it in the third year of 
Henry
 the sixth. 
Joan
 the Wife of Sir 
Iohn Grey
 one of the Sisters and Coheirs of the abovesaid 
Edmund,
 was invested in the possession in the fourth year of the abovesaid Prince. Not long after this, it came to own the Signory of the 
Tiptofts,
 and continued fastned to their patrimony, until the renth year of 
Edward
 the fourth. When 
Iohn Tiptoft
 Earl of 
Worcester,
 being empeached of close Confederacy and Combination with the abovesaid Prince, then forced into Exile, was by the Parliament then principally moulded out of the Lancastrian Faction, attainted and beheaded, and his estate here confiscated to the Crown, and there was lodged un∣til

the first year of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 and then it was granted to 
Anthony Brown
 Vis∣count 
Montague,
 who in the year 1592 deceased, and left it to his Son and Heir 
An∣thony Brown
 Viscount 
Montague,
 and he setled it upon his second Son Mr. 
Stanislaus Brown,
 who now is in the enjoyment of it.


East-wickham
 is situated in the Hundred of 
Little
 and 
Lesnes,
 and celebrates the me∣mory of the noble Family of 
Montchensey,
 and was wrapped up in their Demeasn. 
William de Montchensey,
 held it at his Death, which was in the fifty second year of 
Henry
 the third, and left it to his Sole Daughter and Heir 
Dionis,
 matched to 
Hugh de Vere,
 but he dying without Issue in the seventh year of 
Edward
 the second, as ap∣pears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 51. the Title and possession diverted to 
VVilliam de Valentia
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 half Brother by the Mothers side to 
Henry
 the third, who had mat∣ched with 
Joan
 Sister and Heir to 
VVilliam de Montchensey
 before named; from whom it descended to his Son 
Aymer de Valence,
 who dying without Issue, 
Isabell
 one of his Sisters and Coheirs who was affianced to 
Laurence de Hastings,
 summoned to sit in Parliament by 
Edward
 the third, as Earl of 
Pembroke,
 upon the approportioning the estate, entituled her Husband to this Mannor; and from him was the Title carried down, to his Grandchild 
Iohn de Hastings
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 who was in possession of it at his Decease, which was in the thirteenth year of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 30. And 
Reginald Grey
 was found to be his Heir, in which Family it remai∣ned, until the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth; and then it was passed away to 
VVilliam
 Lord 
Lovell
 who was often summoned to sit as Baron in Parliament, in that Prince's reign: and from him it came down to his Grandchild 
Iohn
 Lord 
Lovell,
 summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron in the second year of 
Edward
 the fourth; and he about the Beginning of his reign, passed it away to 
Iohn
 Lord 
Howard,
 afterwards created Duke of 
Norfolk,
 who being a close and eager Complice of 
Richard
 the third, sunk in his Ruines, in the Battle commenced at 
Bosworth;
 and 
Henry
 of 
Richmond,
 having by that successeful Combat ascertained himself to the 
English
 Scepter, seised upon this Mannor by Escheat, in the first year of his Reign, as relating to a person who had actually appeared in Arms against him: and being thus united to the Crown, it lay cou∣ched in its Revenue, untill the seventh year of 
Edward
 the sixth; and then it was gran∣ted to Sir 
Martin Bowes;
 who not long after passed it away to Alderman 
Oliff
 of 
Lon∣don,
 who left it to 
Joan
 his Sole Daughter and Heir, matched to 
John Leigh
 Son and Heir of 
Nicholas Leigh
 of 
Addington
 in 
Surrey
 Esquire, Father to Sir 
Oliff Leigh,
 who much enhaunsed the Magnisicence of the ancient Fabrick, with increase of Building, and left it to his Son Sir 
Francis Leigh,
 whose Widow the Lady 
Christian Leigh,
 in Right of Dower, is now in Possession of the Signory of it.


VVest-Wickham
 in the Hundred of 
Rokesley,
 is much enobled by being anciently en∣tituled to the possession of the eminent Family of 
Huntingfield. Peter de Hun∣tingfield,
 held it, who was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth years of 
Edward
 the third, and is registred in the Scroles of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who accompanied 
Edward
 the first, in his Victorious Expedition into 
Scotland,
 in the twenty eighth year of his reign, when he reduced 
Carlaverock
 by a successeful Seige, for which his merit was repayed with the Honour of Knighthood, his Son and Heir was 
Walter de Huntingfield,
 who in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the second, obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of 
West-Wickham,
 a Market weekly on the Monday, and a Fair yearly on the Vigil and day of St. 
Mary Magdalen,
 as appears 
Pat.
 11. 
Edwardi secundi, Num.
 23. And left it invested with these Priviledges to his Son and Heir Sir 
John de Huntingfield,
 who paid Aid for three Knights Fees, which he held in this County, at making the Black Prince Knight, and was a Man of that Emi∣nence, that he was summoned to sit as Baron in Parliament, the thirty sixth year of 
Edward
 the third, and several other Times, during the Raign of the above-named Prince. 
William de Huntingfield
 this mans Son, was summoned likewise many Times to sit as Baron in Parliament about the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, but dyed with∣out Issue, so that 
Joan
 and 
Alize Huntingfield
 his Cozens, matched to 
Copledike
 and 
Nor∣wich,
 were his Heirs: and by an old Deed, I find that one 
John Copledike
 held this Man∣nor by Right of Partition, the last year of 
Richard
 the second; but it was not long af∣ter

this fixed in the Patrimony of this Family; for in the seventeenth year of 
Flenry
 the sixth, 
Thomas Squerrie
 died possest of it, and left it to his Son and Heir 
John Squerrie,
 who dying without Issue in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the fourth. 
Dorothy
 one of his two Sisters and Coheirs entituled her Husband 
Richard Mervin
 upon the Division of the Estate to the proprietie of this Mannor; and he not long after passed it away to 
Richard Scrope,
 who in the seventh year of 
Edward
 the fourth alienated it by Fine to 
Ambrose Creseacre,
 who not long after transmitted it by Sale to 
Henry Heyden
 Esquire, to whom the principal part of the ancient. Pile now visible, ows its Erection, and from him did it devolved to that eminent Scholler and Souldier Justice of the Peace, and Captain of the trained Bands of this County in the Reign or Queen 
Elizabeth,
 Sir 
Christopher Heydon,
 who about the latter end of that Princess passed it away to Sir 
Samuel Lennard,
 Father to Sir 
Stephen Lennard,
 who is entituled to the present propriety of it.


Wymingswould
 in the Hundred of 
Wingham,
 contains within the Circuit or Limits of it an ancient Seat called 
Nethersole,
 from its situation near some Pool or descending Pond; and was as high as the Time of K. 
John
 and 
Henry
 the third, the possession of a Family which was represented to the world under this Sirname; for as it appears by the Original Deeds and Evidences which fortifie the Title of this Mansion, 
Richard de Nethersoll
 flourished here about the Government of the abovesaid Monarchs, and from him was it by a perpetuated Succession chained together by an uninterrupted Link of Descent brought down to the days of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then I find by a Roll of the 
Nethersolls
 in the Hands of Mr. 
Nethersoll
 of 
Canterbury
 not long since deceased, that it was the Inheritance of one 
John Nethersoll
 Esquire, one that re∣tained to the Court of 
Henry
 the eighth, and a person whom that Prince did by e∣special Indulgence license even in his presence for some distemper in his Head occa∣sioned by some accidental Circumstances, 
indutum esse Pileo,
 to be covered with a Cap, which certainly both in elder and modern times, was a symptome either of Ho∣nour or Liberty. For the snatching off the Cap or 
Pileus
 of 
Tarquinius Priscus
 by an Eagle, and the placing it on his Head again, was by the 
Augurs
 interpreted as a pre∣sage of his future possessing the Roman Diadem. When slaves received their manu∣mission they were said to be 
ad Pileum vocati,
 their liberty was demonstrated to be compleated by putting on a Cap. The 
Gladiators
 anciently for their magnanimity or personal Courage exprest in mutual Conflicts between themselves in publick Theaters were rewarded as a Guerdon of their Victory 
vel Palmâ, Rude, seu Pilo.
 The 
Lacones
 being made free Denisons of 
Sparta
 more to exemplifie their atchieved Liberty, never went into the Field against the Common Enemy but 
Pileati:
 Amongst the 
Africans
 the placing of the 
Pileus
 or Cap upon the top of a Spear was a tacit citation or sum∣mons to Liberty, and an Intimation to shake off the Fetters of Tyranny. 
Erasmus
 in his Chiliads calls the Cap 
spectatae virtutis Insigne,
 and from this he conjectures, that the putting on of Caps on the Heads of Judges, Doctors and Masters of Art, when they were invested with the above mentioned Degrees, derived its first Original, which cu∣stome is still in Force in our publick 
Comitia,
 or Commencements at the two Univer∣sities of 
Cambridge
 and 
Oxford;
 and likewise in our Courts of Judicature at the Crea∣tion or Investiture of Serjeants at Law: But to return into that Track from whence this Discourse hath made me straggle: As the Seat was anciently folded up in the Re∣venue of 
Nethersoll;
 so it is still, mauger all the vicissitudes of Chance, wrapped up in that Propriety which relates to the Descendants of this Name and Family.


Wingham
 gives Name to the whole Hundred where it is placed, and was in elder Times one of those eminent Mannors, which augmented the Revenue of the Arch-Bishops of 
Canterbury,
 and being by an unjust Detention ravished away, it was by the indulgent Piety of K. 
Edmund
 restored in the year 941. If you will see how it was rated in the Time of the Conquerour, 
Dooms-day
 Book will give you this Prospect of it. 
Wingham
 (says that Record) 
est Manerium Archiep. & T. E. R. defendebat se pro
 XL 
Sullings, & nunc pro
 XXX 
& valet
 C 
lb.
 I find nothing memorable of this Mannor after this, but that it was enchanged in the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, by 
Thomas
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury
 for other Lands with the Crown; and

continued with the Royal Demeasn until the middle of K. 
James,
 and then it was conveyed by Sale to the City of 
London,
 which City not many years since passed it a∣way to the instant Owner Sir 
William Couper
 Knight and Baronet.


Wingham
 had the Grant of a Market procured to it in the seventh year of 
Hen∣ry
 the third, by the mediation of 
Stephen Langton
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury.
 The Colledge of 
Wingham
 was founded by 
John de Peckham
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canter∣bury
 in the year 1278, to be a Colledge or Seminary of Secular Priests, the Head of which Fraternity was called 
Praepositus.
 This upon the suppression being with its whole Revenue invested in the Crown, K. 
Henry
 the eighth granted the Colledge to Sir 
Henry Palmer
 (descended from an ancient Family of that Sirname in 
Sussex
) An∣cestor to Sir 
Henry Palmer
 Baronet, now proprietary of it.


Wenderton
 is an ancient Seat in this Parish (eminent for its excellent Air, Situation, and prospect) which for many hundreds of years had owners of that Sirname, one of whom called 
John Wenderton
 is famous in 
Fox
's Martyrologie for the pennance imposed upon him by 
William Courtney
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 at his Castle of 
Saltwood,
 in the year 1390 for being refractory in the Discharge of some Services which were due to his Mannor of 
Wingham.
 The last of this Name which enjoyed this Seat was 
John Wenderton,
 who in the first year of 
Henry
 the eighth passed it away to 
William Warham
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and he upon his Decease which was about the year 1533 gave it to his Brother 
Hugh Warham,
 and his Successor 
Hugh Warham
 a∣bout the beginning of K. 
James
 transplanted his right in it by Sale into 
William Manwood
 Esquire, and he about the beginning of K. 
Charles
 conveyed it to 
Vincent Denne
 Gentleman, who left it to his Nephew Mr. 
Thomas Denne
 of 
Grays Inne,
 who dying without Issue settled it by Will on his Brother 
John Denne
 of the 
Inner Temple
 Esquire, who likewise deceased without Issue, and bequeathed it to his four Maiden Sisters. 
Roger Lukyn
 Gentleman who matched with one of them purchased the Re∣mainder of the other three, and so is become now sole Proprietary of it.


Twitham
 in this Parish gave Seat and Sirname to an eminent Family in this Track; 
Alan de Twitham
 is recorded in the Register of those remarkable 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who supported the Cause and Quarrel of 
Richard
 the first at the Seige of 
Acon;
 and having continued many Descents Possessors of this Mannor, the Name at last deter∣mined in a Female Heir called 
Isabel,
 who by matching with 
Richard Oxenden
 united 
Twitham
 to the Demeasn of that Family, where the Title hath ever since made so constant and uninterrupted an abode, that it is still the Inheritance of Mr. 
Henry Oxenden
 of 
Brook place.


Brook place
 is the last place of estimate in this Parish, which in elder Times was wrapped up in the Inheritance of 
Wenderton,
 and having continued many Descents interlinked with this Family, the Name and Title found one Sepulcher together for 
Jane Wenderton
 the Heir General of the Family by matching with 
Richard Oxenden
 Gentleman fixed it in his Inheritance, and he much enhaunsed this ancient Seat with Additional Improvements, and from him the Right of Descent hath now made it the Patrimony of Mr. 
Henry Oxenden.


Whitstaple
 gives Name to the whole Hundred which surrounds it, and was a Branch of that ample Patrimony, which encreased the Revenue of 
Alex. de Baliol,
 E. of 
Atholl,
 and he held this and a place called 
Grafton
 in this Parish, as likewise a wood called 
Northwood
 not farre distant, in the Reign of 
Henry
 the third, and left it to his Son and Heir 
John Earl
 of 
Athol,
 who having with an unsuccessful zeal endeavoured to support the sinking Interest of the Kingdome of 
Scotland,
 against the violent Eruptions of 
Edw.
 the first, which like an impetuous Inundation, sought to bear down all the Glory of that Nation, into an irrecoverable Ruine, was in an infortunate Encounter made Captive by that Prince, and being attainted of high Treason, and Executed, his Estate here by Escheat devolved to the Crown, and was by 
Edward
 the second, in the ninth of his reign granted to 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Badelesmere:
 but he having again lost it by his Re∣volt and Defection in the sixteenth and seventeenth years of that Prince, it revolved to the Crown and continued there, until K. 
Edward
 the third in the second year of his Reign restored it to 
Bartholomew de Badelesmer
 his Son, who died in the twelfth year of the abovesaid Prince, and left it to his Brother 
Giles de Badelesmer,
 and he deceasing

without Issue it accrued by 
Mawde
 one of his Sisters and Coheirs to be the Inheritance of 
John Vere
 Earl of 
Oxford,
 and he held it at his Death, which was in the thirty fourth year of 
Edw.
 the third, and to this Family it remained by the Links of many Descents successively fastned, until at last that Revolution which is made by Sale cast it into the possession of 
Phineux;
 the last of which who enjoyed it was 
John Phineux
 Esquire, who concluded in a Daughter and Heir called 
Elizabeth,
 who by matching with Sir 
John Smith
 of 
Ostenhanger,
 knit it to his Estate, from whom by the Devolution of Descent it is now come to confess for proprietary the right honourable 
Philip
 Viscount 
Strangford
 his Grand-child.


Secondly, there is 
Chestfield,
 which was the Mansion of a Family which bore that Sirname, and although I can trace none higher by any publick Record then 
James Chestfield,
 who paid respective Aid for it at the making the Black Prince Knight, as is manifest by the Book of 
Aid
 collected in the twentieth of 
Edward
 the third, yet it is upon possible Conjectures to be argued that they were farre more ancient here, because they assumed their Denomination from this Seat; from 
Chestfield
 about the latter end of the Government of 
Richard
 the second, it came over by purchase to 
Henry Reyner;
 but whether he issued from 
Borden,
 or the 
Reyners
 of 
Borden
 from him, I cannot dis∣cover; but it is very probable he determined in four Daughters and Coheirs matched to 
Edmund Meade, Jo. Badkin, John Reynolds,
 and 
John Springate,
 who concurred in one united Consent, and by one common conveyance demised their Interest in it to 
John Roper
 of St. 
Dunstans;
 from whom 
Edward Roper
 Esquire, now of 
Well-hall
 in 
Eltham,
 claims the instaut Demeasn and Signory of it.


The third is 
Grimgill
 so vulgarly called, but originally and more properly 
Greenshield,
 for so it is in Records of an elder Aspect alwayes written. It was the Seat of a Family that was known by that Appellation, and although the Breviat of the private Evidences which relate to it, discover to us owners of the Name no higher then 
John Greenshield,
 who flourished here about the entrance into the reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, and who was Father to 
Henry Greenshield,
 whose Will is Registred at 
Canterbury,
 and which bears Date from the last of 
Edward
 the fourth; yet it is more then probable that they were eminent here long before, because the above-recited 
John
 and 
Henry Greenshields,
 were Lords of no despicable or narrow fortune not onely here, but about 
Sandwich
 and 
Wodnesborough
 likewise; from 
Greenshield
 by sale the propriety passed over to 
Quekes
 of 
Quekes
 in 
Birchington,
 who suddenly after being extinguished in a Daughter and Heir, all his Interest in 
Grimgill,
 was with her transported in Marriage to 
Crispe,
 originally extracted out of the County of 
Glocester;
 and 
Nicholas Crispe
 Esquire held his Shrievalty here, which was in the second year of Q. 
Elizabeth;
 from 
Crispe
 it was by purchase conveyed into the Revenue of 
Paramour,
 where after it had for several years been fixed, it was very lately taken off from this Family, and by Sale made the Possession of Mr. 
Twiman
 of 
Canterbury.


Fourthly, here was 
Condies-place
 which was the Residence of 
John Condie,
 who had in the reign of 
Edward
 the third contracted upon himself, (which is yet indelibly fixed upon his Memory) a Character of high Account, because he had made an emi∣nent Enemie of the Kings Captive 
in Congressu Bellico,
 those are the words of the Record in a personal Combat; for which he had thirty pound 
per Annum
 setled upon him out of the Kings Profits of the 
Staple
 at 
Canterbury
 by Charter or Grant from 
Edward
 the third dated the seventh day of 
July
 in the fourteenth year of his reign. Now if you will know, where this memorable Action was commenced, the same Record will in∣form you, that the Scene of it was laid at 
Swine
 in 
Normandy:
 But to proceed: this Man not long after he was thus adorned with these Tophies of Honour, paid that Debt to Nature, which we all owe, and left 
Condies Hall
 to his Son 
William Condy,
 who dying without any lawful Issue, 
Margaret Condy
 one of his Sisters became his Co-heir, who by her espousals with 
Robert Grubbe
 made 
Condies Hall
 parcel of his Demeasn; but he likewise in the Age subsequent to this determining in Females, 
Agnes
 one of his Co∣heirs being wedded to 
John Isaack
 of 
Blackmanbery
 in 
Bridge,
 did much swell and improve his Patrimony, with that Additional Estate she united to his, and here in this Name was the possession for sundry Descents resident, even till our Fathers Memory. But here for want of Intelligence, I can proceed no farther; and indeed the Place being fallen from its original Name by Disuse, and that Repute it was under, when it was

possest by so noble proprietaries, is now onely fit to find the Common Sepulcher of Oblivion.


Wicheling
 in the Hundred of 
Eyhorne,
 was folded up in the Patrimony of the noble Family of 
Cobham
 of 
Sterborough
 issued out f
om the 
Cobhams
 of 
Cobham Hall,
 and of this Family was 
Reginald de Cobham,
 who was frequently summoned to sit in Parlia∣ment as Baron, in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, and from this worthy person did this Mannor by successive Devolution come down to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cobham
 of 
Sterborough,
 who deceased in the eleventh of 
Edward
 the fourth, and left his Estate here and else∣where, to 
Anne
 his sole Daughter and Heir marched to 
Edward
 Lord 
Borough
 called to sit in Parliament as Baron of 
Sterborough
 and 
Gainsborough,
 in the reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, and from him both the Title of Baron and of this Mannor flowed down successively to his Grandchild 
Thomas
 Lord 
Borough,
 who passed away the Inheritance to 
Edward Filmer
 Esquire, whose Grand-child Sir 
Edward Filmer
 in relation to that purchase, challenges the instant right and revenue of it.


Willesborough
 in the Hundreds of 
Chart
 and 
Longbridge
 has nothing to make it me∣morable but that it was a principal piece of that revenue which in this County related to the noble and ancient Family of 
Brent;
 of which was 
Falcatius de Brent,
 a man whom our 
English
 History pencils out to us under a Character of the most perfect Courage and Magnanimity, though disordered with some wild Sallies and Excesses: which peradventure may be attributed to the Evaporations of youth, which is alwayes volatile and airy, rather then to any setled and contracted Habit of vitious Distem∣pers, and mutinous passions which was lodged within Him. But to proceed: when 
Willesborough
 had by a successive thread of many Ages been guided along through seve∣ral Descents down to 
John Brent,
 he died and left 
John Brent
 his Heir, who expiring without Issue, 
Margaret
 his eldest Sister became the Inheritrix of all his possessions, and she being matched with 
John Dering
 Esquire of 
Surrenden Dering,
 this place by Female right became transplanted into the Patrimony of that Name and Family, and Sir 
Edward Dering
 about the year 1635, conveyed it to 
Robert Scot
 of 
Canterbury
 Esquire, whose Son and Heir 
Thomas Scot
 of 
Canterbury
 Esquire is now proprietary of it.


Wilmington
 in Hundred of 
Dartford
 resolves it self into two Mannors which exact a peculiar Cognisance, and the first is 
Rue Hill
 (so it was anciently written though now by vulgar Acceptation it is called 
Rowe Hill.
) It was in Ages of a higher Track, the pa∣trimony of an illustrious and generous Family called 
Gise,
 who were in those times as eminent for the largeness of their possessions, as they were for the Antiquity of their Extraction; and from hence were the 
Gises
 of the Counties of 
Hereford
 and 
Gloucester
 originally sprouted out. 
Anselmus de Gise
 had a Charter of Free Warren granted to his Lands at 
Rue Hill
 in 
Wilmington,
 in the twenty second year of 
Edward
 the first; but it appears the Possession of this place, invested and fortified with this Grant was not long after united to this Family; for 
John Gise
 this mans Grand-child sold it to 
Nicholas Brember,
 who in the twelfth year of 
Richard
 the second, being blasted with an impeachment of high Treason, fell an Oblation to the fury of those Lords, who upon pretence of asserting the publick Liberty, sought to fetter up the majesty and prerogative of their Prince, within those narrow Restraints, and Limits which they prescribed to empale it in, and pare off the power of the Crown (which like 
Sampson
's Locks being shaved Kings remain like other men.) Upon his attaint 
Rue Hill
 resolved into the revenue of the Crown, and King 
Richard
 the second in the fourteenth year of his reign granted it to 
Adam Bamme
 of 
London,
 and in his Lineage was the Inheritance of it sundry Generations wrapt up, till in our Grand-fathers memory it was alienated to 
Brett;
 from whose successor the same Alteration rowled the possession not many years since into 
Smith.


The second is 
Highlands
 which was parcel of the Demeasn of the Knights of St. 
John
 of 
Jerusalem,
 and upon the Dissolution of their Alberge here in 
England,
 was gran∣ted about the thirty fifth year of 
Henry
 the eighth to Sir 
Thomas Moile,
 and Sir 
Maurice Dennis;
 the last of which passed away his Concernment in it to Sir 
Thomas Moile
 by whose Daughter and Co-heir called 
Amy Moile,
 it came to be possest by

Sir 
Thomas Kempe;
 who left it to his Son and Heir Sir 
Thomas Kempe
 who conveyed it to his Brother Mr. 
Reginald Kempe,
 who in our Fathers memory passed it away to 
Lancelot Bathurst
 Esquire, Father to Sir 
Edward Bathurst,
 who is the instant proprietary of it.


Wodnesborough
 lies in the Hundred of 
Eastrie,
 and spreads it self into many places of no despicable Account. First there is 
Shelving,
 which was as high as any Evidence, can waft us to discover, the Demeasn of 
Houghham
 of 
Hougham
 by 
Dover,
 a Family rooted in as deep Antiquity as any in this Track. 
Robert de Hougham
 is enrolled in an ancient Register of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who supported the cause and Quarrel of 
Richard
 the first at the Seige of 
Acon.
 Sir 
Robert de Hougham
 his Son died possest of it in the second year of 
Edward
 the first, and left 
Robert Hougham
 his Heir, who de∣termined in Daughters and Co-heirs; so that 
Benedicta Houghham
 one of them being married to 
John Shelving,
 this became his Demeasn, where he erected a House, upon which he fixed his Sirname, and called it 
Shelving,
 which in those Times was of con∣siderable Repute, though since by the frequent impressions of Age, it is shrunk into De∣cay and Obscurity, from 
Shelving
 one Moitie of it by Sale was transmitted to 
St. Leger,
 and so continued distinguished in the Interest of it, till both 
Shelving
 and 
St. Leger
 did by a mutual Concurrence pass away their joynt right in it to 
Dynley:
 where it had not long been Seated, but the like Fatality transferred the Possession of it to 
White;
 and here the Title of it was as unfixt and unstable also: for from this Family by purchase it was carried into the Revenue of 
Knight,
 who in our memory altered his Interest in it by Sale to Mr. 
Solomon Hougham
 of 
Sandwich,
 primitively issued out in a Collateral Line from Sir 
Robert Hougham,
 upon whose late Decease his Son and Heir Mr. 
Richard Hougham
 is now possessor of it.


Ringleton
 does secondly exact some Remembrance: It was anciently the Interest of 
Perot;
 for 
Thomas Perot
 held it at his Death, which was in the fourth year of 
Edward
 the third; but when this Name was extinguished in a Daughter and Heir, 
William Langley
 by matching with Her entituled himself to the Possession of this place, in which Family the Inheritance for sundry Generations was settled, till the Vicissitude of Time by Sale conveyed it into the Demeasn of 
John White,
 who was originally a Mer∣chant of the 
Staple,
 and did by several Acts of exemplary Munificence, evidence him∣self to be a liberal Benefactor to 
Canterbury.
 But long it was not fastned to the Possession of this Name; for his Successor alienated it to 
Butler
 of 
Heronden
 in 
Eastrie,
 from which Family 
Ringleton
 by the same Mutation was brought to own the Possession of 
Neame,
 and his Son 
Daniel Neame
 sold it to 
Spencer
 of 
Sandwich,
 whose Successor 
Nicholas Spencer
 dying without Issue, his Sister who was wedded to 
Hughs
 descended from 
Hughs
 of 
Middleton Stony
 in the County of 
Oxford,
 who was branched out from the 
Hughs
 of 
North-Wales,
 by a Relative right deduced from that Alliance, has planted the present Possession in the Patrimony of that Name and Family.


Thirdly upper 
Hamwold
 may fall under a Disquisition, because it was wound up in the Estate and Propriety of 
Greenshield,
 whose principal residence was at 
Greenshield
 in 
Whitstaple,
 corruptly called 
Grimgil,
 where I have spoken more largely of this Family: onely this I shall add, that 
Henry Greenshield,
 who died in the last year of 
Edward
 the fourth, was a munificent Benefactor to the poor and other indigent and necessitous people of the Town of 
Sandwich,
 to whom he bequeaths by his last Testament very libe∣ral Donations for their relief and support: After this Family of 
Greenshield
 was moul∣dered away at 
Hamwold,
 I find the 
Elis's
 invested in the Possession, but whether by Alli∣ance or Purchase I cannot discover. After they went out, the Family of 
Francis
 was by Purchase from them, seated in the Inheritance, to whose Interest it was not many years united, for from them it passed away by Sale to 
Wilson,
 where the Title was not less violate, and cursory; for from 
Wilson
 the like Alienation translated the right of it into 
Parboe,
 whose Widow Mrs. 
Parboe
 does now enjoy it, as being made part of her Jointure when first she matched with 
Parboe.


Fourthly, 
Grove
 and upper 
Hamwold
 are two little Mannors circumscribed likewise within the Limits of 
Wodnesborough;
 and were in the thirty second year of 
Ed.
 the third the Inheritance of 
Pet. de Goldesburgh,
 or 
Goldesborough,
 but the Title made no long abode in this Name after this Man's 
Exit;
 for both, about the latter End of 
Richard
 the second,

were conveyed to 
Langley
 of 
Knowlton,
 from whom as suddain a Devolution, about the latter end of 
Henry
 the fixth, passed them over to Sir 
John White
 of 
Canterbury
 a Merchant of the 
Staple,
 and he died possest of them in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, as appears, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 25. After this Family was worn out, I find 
Stokes
 planted in the Possession; from which Name about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, they came over by Purchase to one 
Nicholas Mois
 Gentleman, and when that Family deserted the Possession which was in our Grand-fathers Remembrance a Fatality pro∣portionate to the former, made them both parcel of the Patrimony of 
Everard,
 by whom not many years since, they were alienated to 
James
 to the Inheritance of which Family they remain yet linked and united.


Fifthly, 
Poltmans
 vulgarly called 
Poultmans
 yielded both Seat and Sirname to a Fa∣mily of some Estimate in this Track, who had here a Castellated Mansion, invested with a Moat, and continued Lords of this Habitation, until 
Peter Poltman
 by descen∣dant right came to be possest of it, and he about the fifteenth year of 
Richard
 the second conveyed it by Fine to 
Langley
 of 
Knowlton,
 in whom the Propriety was setled but until the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, and then it was passed away by Sale to Sir 
John White:
 who, dying seised of it in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the fourth, by Testament ordered it to be sold for the improvement of Acts of Charity, and pious Uses, and was according to the Tenor of his will conveyed by Sale to 
Boteler
 of 
He∣ronden
 in 
Eastry,
 and there it made its abode until our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was passed away to 
Benskin,
 in which Family the Title is yet permanent.


Woditon
 in the Hundred of 
Kinghamford
 hath three places in it of considerable Estimate. The first is 
Gedding
 which K. 
Cedwall
 and 
Keneldrith
 his Queen, in the year of 
Grace
 693 gave to 
Theodore
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and the Covent of 
Christ-Church
 in 
Canterbury,
 free (as the original Donation informs me) as 
Adesham,
 and was by them afterwards assigned to the Sacrist or Sexton of 
Christ-Church,
 for his lively∣hood and Subsistance, an Office in elder Times of no contemptible Account in the Repute and Vogue of the Monks of that Cloister; for the sacred Utensils of the Church were not only committed to his Care and Custody, but he was likewise to make Preparation for the Celebration of the Mass, and the performance of other divine and sacred Officers, and because he might be more active and vigorous in the Managery and execution of his Trust, these under-Officers were to be subservient and and ministerial to him, their Catalogue sollows.

For which last (the rest being of easie understanding,) I conceive it was one that either wrought the Church Vestments, or Hangings, and the like, in Gold, or that re∣freshed them, when they were dim or tarnished. But to proceed: this Mannor being with the Remainder of the Revenue of the Priory of 
Christ-Church,
 surrendred into the Hands of 
Henry
 the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his reign, who afterwards in the thirty first of his Government granted it to Mr. 
Edward Foch
 of 
Hells Court
 in this Parish; from whom it descended to 
Thomas Foch
 of 
Monkton
 in the Isle of 
Thanet
 Esquire, who deceasing not many years since gave it to his second Son Major 
John Foch
 of 
London,
 and he hath lately passed it away to his elder Brother 
Thomas Foch
 Esquire.


Hells
 is a second place of Note, which for divers Descents, until the reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, confessed no other Proprietaries, but 
Hells
 of 
Hell. Court
 in 
Ash:
 and then, they abandoning the Possession, it came to be enjoyed by 
Merywether,
 and remained linked to the Patrimony of this Name, until the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then by a Female Inheritrix is came to confess the Signory of 
Foch,
 in

Right of which Alliance it is now the Inheritance of 
Thomas Foch
 Esquire.


Wickham Bushes
 is another Mannor which has its Situation within the Limits of 
Woditon,
 and was, as the Light of the most ancient Evidences does guide us to believe, the Patrimony of 
Guldeford;
 for 
Henry de Guldeford,
 (as the Book of 
Aid
 discovers to us) did hold it by Knights Service, of 
Geffrey de Say,
 in the twentieth year of 
Ed.
 the third; but in a Descent or two after, this Family was shrunk away from the posses∣sion of this place, and then the ancient and illustrious Family of 
Digge
 of 
Digge's Court
 in 
Berham,
 was the next which succeeded in the Propriety and Inheritance, and to this Name was the Title of this place, by a successive Series of many Generations fastned, till in our Fathers Memory it was by sale rent off, and by that Alienation linked to the Revenue of 
Coppen,
 in whose Demeasn the Interest of it at this Day con∣tinues included.


Woodchurch
 in the Hundred of 
Blackbourn,
 was the Habitation of a Family of as deep Root in Antiquity as any in this Track, who extracted their Sirname, as well as borrow∣ed their first Original, from this place. 
Roger de Woodchurch
 is the first who does occurre, who in the ancient Evidences and the Deeds of this place, which are not cloistered within any Date finds a frequent Mention, and from him (as appears by an old Pedigree of this Family) did it devolve to his Grandchild Sir 
Simon de Woodchurch,
 who is in the Register of those eminent Persons who accompanied 
Edward
 the first in his Victori∣ous and triumphant Expedition into 
Scotland,
 where his Victories entailed upon his Memory the Character of 
Malleus Scotorum,
 but in this Sir 
Simon:
 the Name though not the Male Line determined, for he by matching with 
Susan,
 Heir of 
Henry le Clerke
 of 
Munfidde,
 brought a large Inheritance to own the Signory of 
Woodchurch;
 and his Successors in Gratitude to a Family which had added so much of splendor, and annexed so plentiful a Revenue to this Name, altered their paternal Appellation from 
Wood∣church
 to 
Clerke;
 and so in all their Deeds subsequent to this Match, have written 
Clerke
 aliàs 
Woodchurch
 ever since. But as all Families have their Descent and Period, as well as Gradation and Ascent, so had this; for after this Mannor had for so many hundred years continued in this Family which had been productive of Men which had been planted in places of the greatest Eminence, by which they were obliged to per∣form Service to their Country, it came down at last to 
Humfrey Clerk
 Esquire, who about the year 1594, passed it away by Sale to 
Walter Harlackenden
 Esquire; by whose Daughter and Heir called 
Deborah Harlackenden,
 it was united to the Revenue of Sir 
Edward Hales
 Knight and Baronet: upon whose late Decease it is now descended to his Grand-child Sir 
Edward Hales
 Baronet, who is entitled to the instant Signory of it.


Pleurinden
 in this Parish is a Branch of that Estate which fell under the Signory of the ancient and Knightly Family of 
Engham,
 very frequently in old Deeds and other Monuments written 
Edingham,
 and sometimes 
Hengham:
 In a Deed wherein there is mention of a Match between ....... one of the Co-heirs of Sir 
Stephen de Penchester,
 and 
Henry de Cobham,
 and wherein some Land is conveyed over to 
Cobham,
 there are these Persons recorded to be 
Testes
 to it, 
William de Savage, William de Oure, Otho de Grandison,
 and 
Roger de Hengham.
 The Deed is very ancient, and though not con∣fined to any strict or precise Date, yet commences from the reign of 
Edward
 the first, and from this 
Roger
 did 
Vincent Engham
 Esquire lineally descend, who in the ....... year of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 passed it away by Sale to 
Roger Twisden
 Esquire, Grand-father to Sir 
Roger Twisden
 Baronet, in whom is fixed the instant Propriety of it.


Tounland
 is another Mannor in 
Woodchurch
 which had anciently Owners of that Sir∣name. 
Rafe de la Thun
 died seised of this Mannor and other Lands in 
Woodchurch
 the for∣ty third year of 
Hen.
 the third: After him I find 
Richard de Tunland
 possest of it in the reign of 
Henry
 the third, and 
Edward
 the first; and had Issue 
Thomas de Tunl
nd
 who died seised of it in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 13. and left it to his Son and Heir 
John de Tunland,
 who was an eminent Benefactor to the priory of 
Leeds,
 to which Covent he added this Mannor to improve their Revenue at the time of his Decease, which was in the forty seventh year of 
Edward
 the third, and here it remained until the Dissolution, and then it was granted by 
Henry
 the eighth to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Cromwell:
 and after his Attaint in the thirty second year of his reign, being

escheated, it was in the thirty fifth of 
Henry
 the eighth regranted to Sir 
Thomas Moile
 Chancellor of the Court of Augmentation, and he in the thirty sixth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, passed it away by Sale to 
William Goodwin,
 and 
Tho. Ancos,
 and they not long after alienated their Right in it to 
Lucas:
 in which Family it continued but un∣til the Beginning of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was conveyed by Sale to 
Thomas Godfrey,
 whose Son 
James Godfrey
 in the tenth year of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 transferred it by the like Devolution to 
Mary Guldford;
 and she again in the eleventh year of that Princess demised it to 
Richard Guldford,
 and he not long after sold it away to 
Shelley
 of 
Michel∣grove,
 and 
John Shelley
 as I find by a Court Roll relating to this place, held it in the eighteenth of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 and in the Descendant of this Name and Family is the In∣heritance of it, if I be not misinformed, at this instant placed.


Henherst
 is the last place considerable in 
Woodchurch,
 which was the possession of a Family of that Denomination, of whom I have spoken at 
Stapleherst,
 where they en∣joyed another Mannor of this Name, and of which Family this here was but a Cadet or younger Slip, and was written sometimes 
Henherst,
 and as often in old Deeds 
Eng∣herst,
 and continued Owners of this place, until the reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then it devolved to Sir 
Thomas Hengherst,
 who was the last of that Name which held this place, for he dying without Issue Male, 
Humfrey Wise
 who had matched with his Daughter and Heir in her right was invested in the Inheritance of it, but he deceasing likewise without Issue Male, his sole Inheritrix united it by marriage to the Revenue of her Husband Mr. 
Robert Masters,
 Great Grand-father to Mr. 
Edward Masters
 of 
Canterbury;
 in whom the propriety of this place is at this prefent continued.


Henden
 likewise is an Appendage to 
Woodchurch,
 from whence certainly the Name of 
Henden
 originally streamed out, though it be brought down to our Times in so crooked and perplexed a Chanel, that we cannot discover it in all the wandrings and Digressions of it, though the Family was made more conspicuous, by Sir 
Edward Henden
 one of the Barons of the Exchequer to the late King 
Charles:
 who for his clear speculation and insight into the deepest and most mysterious Intrigues of the Mu∣nicipal Law of 
England,
 was commonly called the Picklock of it. But this is a Diver∣sion: The ancient Proprietaries of 
Henden,
 represented to us by the eldest Records, were the Lords 
Burwash,
 very frequently written 
Burghherst,
 and 
Bartholomew
 Lord 
Burwash
 had a Charter of Free Warren granted to 
Henden,
 in the eighteenth year of 
Edward
 the third. And when this Family had deserted the Possession of this place, the next which successively held it were the 
Capells
 of 
Capells Court
 in 
Ivie-Church,
 and 
Richard Capell
 died seised of it in the fifteenth year of 
Richard
 the second: and here, after it had been for some Generations fixed, the Name resolved into a Daughter and Heir, who was matched unto 
Harlackenden,
 and so it became twisted into the Revenue of that Family, and so remained till 
Deborah Harlackenden
 the Heir General of 
Walter Harlackenden,
 a Branch of this Stock, by being wedded to Sir 
Edward Hales
 Knight and Baronet, Grand-father to Sir 
Edward Hales
 now of 
Tunstall
 Baronet, wound it up in the Demeasn and Interest of that Honourable Family.


The 
Borough
 of 
Harlackenden
 is situated in this Parish, and has been for many hun∣dred of years the Patrimonial Demeasn of that Name and Family, as appears by a Tomb in the Church of 
Woodchurch,
 whose Inscription signifies that one of them lies enterr'd there a little after the Conquest: and though the Character be in the proporti∣on and Shape of it very much like that which was in use in the reign of 
Hen.
 the fourth, and 
Henry
 the fifth, and so makes the Truth of it disputable, yet to this 'tis answered, that there was an old Tombstone there before, with the same Inscription upon it, in∣sculped peradventure in a 
Saxon
 Character, or such an one as was proportionate to that time in which that person died, who lies there entombed: which being decayed his Successors to perpetuate and inforce the Memory of so ancient a Predecessor, fixed this Stone upon his Grave, and, to make the Memorial more obvious, did cause the Epitaph to be engraven in such a Letter, as was Customary to the Time of that Prince, in whose reign it was laid upon the Ashes beneath. In 
Greys Inne
 Hall by particular Inspection I have observed the Arms of this Family, 
viz. Azure A fesse Ermin between three Lions Heads erased Or,
 to be painted in an upper Window, which appears to be of very venerable Antiquity, and this justifies those fair Attributes of Noble, Ancient, and Illustrious, which may with very good Reason be entituled to this Family, of

which is 
Thomas Harlackenden
 Esquire, who by inherent right transmitted to him by a never-ebbing stream of so many multiplied Descents is the instant proprietary of this 
Borough.


Edingham,
 vulgarly called 
Engham,
 is the last place of Account within the Verge of 
Woodchurch,
 and was, in Times of elder date, before they transplanted themselves to 
Singleton
 in Great 
Chart,
 the Mansion of the 
Enghams:
 who as they placed here their Seat, extracted from hence to their Sirname a Family doubtless of profound Antiquity, and no less Reputation; as may appear by those large Possessions which they were interessed in, in several parts of 
Romney Mersh,
 written in old Records sometimes 
Edingham,
 and by Contraction 
Engham,
 and very frequently 
Hengham.
 And it is very probable from the Identity of the Name, that 
Rafe de Hengham
 the eminent Lord Chief Justice in the reign of 
Edward
 the first was of this Family.

 Sir 
Audomer
 (or 
Aymer
) 
de Engham
 was Justice of 
Chester
 in the second year of 
Edward
 the third, and was issued out originally from this Family, and it is possible 
Audomar
 or 
Odmer de Hengham
 who lies buried in 
Christ-Church
 at 
Canterbury
 in the year 1411 was his Son and what much enhaunses the Honour of this Family, he is written in the Latin In∣scription affix'd to his Tomb 
Audomarus Hengham Armiger:
 and in this Name was the Inheritance of this place conducted along through many Generations of the 
Enghams,
 even till our Grand-fathers Memory, and then it was by sale alienated to 
Baker,
 who is now the Possessor of that Seat which formerly made the Name of 
Engham,
 so con∣spicuous in this County.


Wolwich
 has been in elder Times written 
Wolnewich,
 is in the Hundred of 
Lesnes,
 and was the propriety of 
Gilbert de Marisco,
 who stands first in the Inventory of those who were its former possessors, and he held it about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the first, and assumed this Name 
de Marisco,
 from that Estate which he enjoyed in the 
Mersh
 beneath this Town: and it seems his Fortune was of no narrow Dimension, for he held this Mannor under the Notion of half a Knights Fee, in the above men∣tioned Prince's reign of 
Warren de Montchensie
 Baron of 
Swanscampe:
 After him 
Sabina de Windlesor
 possest it about the seventeenth year of 
Edward
 the second, by the fourth part of a Knights Fee also, of the Barony of 
Montchensie
 at 
Swanscampe.
 And then next successively to her did 
John de Pultney
 hold it in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, as this Lady had held it before by the fourth part of a Knights Fee, and of the Ho∣nour of 
Montchensie
 in like manner: from whom it passed away to 
William Chichley,
 a Kinsman of that eminent Prelates 
Henry Chichley
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury.
 And this man had Issue 
John Chichley,
 who deceased without Issue Male, and left onely 
Agnes
 his Heir matched with 
John Tatersal,
 who flourished here in her right much of the Rule of 
Henry
 the sixth, and some of that of 
Edward
 the fourth, and then a∣lienated the Interest of this place to 
Boughton,
 in which Family the Interest of it re∣mained, til by sale it was divided from it, and united to the patrimony of 
Heywood,
 where it seems the Title was supported with no constant possession; for shortly after, almost in less then our Fathers Memory the right of it was by the former Fatality translated into Sir 
Nicholas Gilbourne
 Father to 
Henry Gilbourne
 Esquire, to whom this Mannor gives up the right of its present possession.


It appears that the Commissions of Sewers which are now yearly issued for to make a diligent Inspection into those Banks and the Defects of them, which protect and se∣cure the adjacent Mershes from the encroachments, and eruptions of the Thames was of authentick and ancient use; for a Commission went out (as is manifest by 
Pat.
 17. 
Edwardi secundi
) for repairing a very great Breach the waters by an Inundation had made into the Mershes which lie extended between 
Wolwich
 and 
Greenewich.


Wrotham
 gives Name to the whole Hundred where it is seated, and is registred in the List of those Mannors which formerly encreased the revenue and supported the Digni∣ty of the Arch-Bishops of 
Canterbury;
 and if you will see how it was rated in the Time of the Conquerour, consult 
Dooms-day
 Book, and that speaks thus, 
Wrotham est Manerium Archiepiscopi & T. E. R. defendebat se pro
 VIII 
Sullings & est appretiatum
 24 
lb.
 and continued treasured in their patrimony until the twenty ninth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was exchanged by 
Thomas Cranmer
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury


with the Crown, and lay clasped up in the Kingly revenue until the sixth year of 
Edw.
 the sixth, and then it was granted to Sir 
William Mason,
 who partly passed it away by sale, and partly gave it in Dower with his Daughter matched to 
Robert Bing
 Esquire, whose Successor Mr. 
John Bing
 hath lately passed away his entire Interest in it to

 
William James
 of 
Eigtham
 Esq; descended from an ancient Family called 
Haestrecht
 near 
Ʋtrecht:
 to which Family 
Will. Camden Clarenceux
 King of Arms through mistake and inadverten∣cy assigned 
Argent a Cheveron be∣tween three Mill Rinds Sables
 as the paternal Coat of this Family; whereas, had he made a serious Review, he would have discovered that the Original Coat of 
Hae∣strecht,
 was 
Argent two Barrs Cre∣nellee Gules three Pheons in chief Sa∣bles;
 which mistake, that I may the better rectifie, I have represented both in Sculpture, to the view of the Reader.


Wrotham
 had a Market procured to it by 
Walter Reynolds
 Arch-Bishop of 
Canterbury
 in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the second.


Wingfield
 is a second Mannor in 
Wrotham
 which in Times very ancient acknow∣ledged the propriety of 
Quintin
 a Family though not of signal, yet of no cheap Ac∣count in this Tract; and was by 
Gilbert Quintin
 and 
Joan
 his Wife in the thirty first year of 
Henry
 the eighth, passed away by Fine to 
James Peckham,
 from whom by a Clew of several Generations it was conducted down to 
James Peckham
 Gentleman, who about the beginning of K. 
James
 conveyed it to 
Nicholas Miller
 of 
Horsnells Crouch
 Esq; who deceasing without Issue bequeathed it to his Nephew Sir 
Nicholas Miller;
 upon whose late paying that Debt we all owe to Nature, it is now 
Humf. Millers
 Esquire.


Yaldham
 or 
Aldham
 is another Seat of considerable Account in 
Wrotham,
 especially since it celebrates the Memory of 
Thomas de Aldham,
 who by a pious Assistance supported the Arms and Cause of 
Richard
 the first when he was engaged at the Siege of 
Acon:
 and from him it descended to Sir 
Thomas de Aldham,
 who determining in three Daughters and Coheirs, 
Margery
 one of them by matching with 
Martin de Peckham,
 descended from 
John de Peckham
 (who likewise fills up the Catalogue of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who by their signal Courage made themselves considerable under 
Richard
 the first at the Siege of 
Acon.
) did augment his Patrimony by the Union of hers at this place to it. And from him hath an undisturbed Channel of many Descents flowing through sundry worthy persons of very remarkable Repute in their respective Generations, brought it down to confess the Signory of 
Reginald Peckham
 Esquire.


Barsted
 is the last Mannor in 
Wrotham
 which accrued to 
James Peckham
 by matching wich the Sole Heir of Sir 
Thomas Moraunt,
 and hath lain ever since wrapped up in the Demeasn of that Family, so that at present it is part of the patrimony of 
Reginald Peckham
 of 
Yaldham
 Esquire.


Ford
 in this parish has been for some Centuries of years the possession of 
Clerk,
 very frequently written in old Evidences 
le Clerk. John Clerk
 Son of 
John Clerk
 was the second Baron of the Exchequer about the beginning of the reign of 
Henry
 the sixth, from whom in a lineal succession Sir 
William Clerk
 did descend: who when this Nation was engaged in the Flame of the late Civil Contention, offered up his Life to the Commands of his late Majesty, in that signal Confflict which was commenced between Sir 
William Waller
 and the Royal party at 
Cropreadie Bridge:
 and, which is more remarkable, after he had received a mortal Wound, as if he had had a greater Care of his Friend's Security then of his own, poured out his last Breath in this Expression, Look to Sir 
William Butler,
 for I saw him fall. After whose Decease the right of this Mansion being included in the jointure of his Lady Dowager, she in Relation to that first set∣tlement now holds the possession of it.




Pleckston
 was formerly a Borough appertaining to 
Wrotham:
 but by an ordinance of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, bearing Date from the year of our Lord, 1647, it was enacted, there should be a Collection thoroughout this County, towards the erecting a Parochial Church at this place, and the establishing a Congre∣gation proportionate to it, which was effected accordingly; so that now it hath the Repute of a Parish, seperate and distinct from 
Wrotham,
 and contains within its Limits the Mannor of 
Sore,
 which was in times of a more ancient Complexion par∣cel of the patrimony of the 
Colepepers
 of 
Preston
 in 
Alresford;
 for 
Walter Colepeper,
 dyed possest of it, in the first year of 
Edward
 the third, from whom an uninterrupted flowing of Descent, wafted the Title down to Sir 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Preston,
 who passed it away to 
Nicholas Miller
 Esquire, of 
Horsnells Crouch
 in 
Wrotham,
 and he upon his decease, disposed of his Right in it to his Nephew Sir 
Nicholas Miller
 of 
Oxenhoath,
 upon whose late Decease, it descended to his Son and Heir 
Humphrey Miller
 Esquire.


Wormsell
 is a small despicable Parish, in the Hundred of 
Eyhorn,
 and was ever esteemed an Appendage to the Mannor of 
Boughton Malherbe,
 and had ever the same Proprietaries, as namely, 
Gatton, Dene, Corbie,
 and lastly 
Wotton;
 in which last Family it remained untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth; and then it was passed away to 
Dynley,
 where it rested untill our Fathers Memory; and then it was con∣veyed to 
Sydley,
 so that it now owns the propriety of Sir 
Charles Sydley
 Baronet.


Wouldham
 lies in the Hundred of 
Larkefield,
 and was given to 
Ernulf
 Bishop of 
Rochester,
 by 
Ethelbert
 King of 
Kent,
 in the year 762, who for this and other his Munificent Donations, by which he so much enlarged, and multiplyed the Revenue of the Sea at 
Rochester,
 is represented to us at this day, by the Records of that Church, under the Character and Pourtraicture of 
pius Ethelbertus:
 but the Steeple, and much of the Fabrick of the Church, owe their original to the Charity and Beneficence of 
Stephen Slegge,
 who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the twenty seventh year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and bequeathed by his Will in the thirty sixth year of that Prince's reign, a 100. Marks, to be disbursed and expended on the Church and Steeple of 
Wouldham.


Rings
 is a small Mannor that spreads it self partly into 
Wouldham,
 and partly into the Parish of St. 
Margarets
 not far distant, but was eminent formerly, because it was the Demeasn in part of the noble Family of 
Cosington
 of 
Cosington
 in 
Alresford,
 the other Moiety acknowledging the Signory of 
Carter; Cosington
 sold his proportion to 
Whorne
 of 
Whornes-place
 in 
Cuckston;
 and 
Carter
 alienated his to 
Laurence,
 who not long after, by a mutual Deed of Conveyance, passed away their joynt Interest in it to 
Hadds
 of 
Meriam-court
 in 
VVicheling,
 who was scarce setled in his new purchase, but he by Sale transplanted his right in it into 
Thomas Roydon
 of 
Roydon-court
 in 
Peck∣ham,
 who was one of those, who in the thirty first year of 
Henry
 the eighth, altered, by Act of Parliament, their possessions from the Nature and Tenure of Gavelkind to that of Knights Service. From 
Roydon,
 this place (as appears by the private Eviden∣ces of Mr. 
John Marsham
) by the former Alienation, was carried into the Demeasn of 
Brockhull
 of 
Aldington Septuans
 in 
Thurnham,
 where the possession was not long resident; for 
Henry Brockhull
 conveyed it away to 
Nicholas Lewson
 of the County of 
Stafford,
 whose Grandchild Sir 
Richard Lewson,
 desiring to circumscribe his Revenue within the more close circumference of 
Staffordshire,
 sold his Concernment here to 
John Marsham
 Esquire, originally extracted out of 
Norfolk:
 to whose Name, those learned pieces which he hath made publick, as namely his accurate Disquisitions upon 
Daniel;
 and his elaborate Preface, prefixed to the monastick Survey, styled 
Monasti∣cum Anglicanum;
 shall stand in future Ages, both Urn and Epitaph.


Starkeys
 is another place wholly involved within the Limits of 
VVouldham,
 but formerly it was not known by this Name: for in Times of elder Aspect I believe it could scarce entitle it self to any Mansion though it had the Repute of a Mannor, and under that Notion is it mentioned to be held by Sir 
John Buckland,
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, as appears by the Book called 
Feoda Militum
 kept in the Exchequer, where it is styled the Mannor of 
Little-VVouldham.
 After this Family

was worn out, the 
Newmans
 were the next; who, by purchase from them, became possessors of the Fee, but stayed not long in the Tenure of it; for in a Descent or two after, 
Henry Newman
 alienated the Inheritance to 
Humphrey Starkey
 one of the Barons of the Exchequer, in the reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, who erected here that House, which ever since hath been adopted into his Name; he was descended from the 
Starkyes
 of 
VVrenbery
 and 
Oulton
 in 
Cheshire,
 and lyes entombed under a fair Mo∣nument, in the Parish Church of St. 
Leonards Shorditch
 in 
London,
 which the Inju∣ries of time, and impious Mechanicks together have much empaired, but it seems the Name of the House could not entail it on his posterity, for his Successor sold it to Sir 
John Rainsford,
 a man of great Demeasne about 
Lose, East
 and 
VVest-Barming,
 and of no lesse Authority with 
Henry
 the eighth; who not long after conveyed it over to 
Lambe;
 from whom the Fate of Sale, brought the Inheritance to 
Nicholas Lewson
 Esquire, whose Grandchild Sir 
Richard Lewson,
 upon those motives which incited him to alienate 
Rings,
 which was to contract his whole De∣measne into 
Staffordshire,
 transferred his Right in this likewise, to 
Jo. Marsham
 Esq; formerly one of the six Clerks: of whose Learning and Merit I have spoken, when I treated of 
Rings.


Beaulies-court
 is the last place of Note in this Parish to be discoursed upon: it was formerly in Records written 
Sellers,
 and gave Sirname to a Family known by that Appellation; for 
John at Seller
 (under that Orthography he is recorded in the Book of 
Aide
) held this place by Knights Service of the Bishop of 
Rochester
 in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third; and the Arms of this Family, stand depicted in an old pane of Glasse, yet remaining in 
VVouldham-church, videlicet Argent a Salteir between four Mullets Gules,
 and is now quartered by 
Beauly;
 for when this Name con∣cluded in a Female Heir, she by her espousals with 
Beauly,
 knit this Seat and the pro∣priety of it to their patrimony; who, for some Additions they angmented the House with, changed the Name of 
Sellers
 into 
Beaulies-court,
 and by a Right brought down to him by a Chain of Sundry Generations from the former Alliance, does Mr. 
Thomas Beauly,
 now of 
London
 Merchant, claim his present Interest in it.


VVye
 gives Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is placed, and is in Latine Re∣cords frequently called 
Vaga,
 or wandring, and in the British Dialect it imports as much, from whence they imposed the Name of 
VVye,
 on a noted River in 
Herefordshire,
 from its crooked and perplexed Digressions. It was a Mannor which belonged to the Crown before the Conquest, and King 
VVilliam
 the first, gave it to 
Battell
 Abby: I recite the Donation, because it reserves the Earl of 
Kents Deniers
 or 
tertium Denarium,
 a sin∣gular Testimony of grounding and conferring the Dignity, and justifies the unparal∣lelled Title it hath, of being called 
Regale Manerium de VVye,
 The Royal Mannor of 
VVye;
 for the Signory of 22 Towns lying crosse the Country from hence to 
Battell
 pertain unto it.


Aldons, Dods, VVest-Sture, Bromsford, Shotenton,
 with the Mannor of the Vica∣ridge were given by 
John Kempe,
 first Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and Lord Chancel∣lor of 
England,
 and after Cardinal to the Colledge of 
VVye,
 which he had erected and dedicated to St. 
Martin
 and St. 
Gregory;
 which, upon the Suppression, were setled in the patrimony of the Crown, till Queen 
Elizabeth
 granted them to her Kinsman 
Henry Cary
 Baron of 
Hunsdon,
 whose Grandchild 
Henry
 Earl of 
Dover,
 not many years since conveyed them to Sir 
Thomas Finch
 Earl of 
VVinchelsey,
 whose Son 
Heneage
 Earl of 
VVinchelsey,
 has the instant Signory of them.


Ollantigh
 was a place of no Account, till Cardinal 
Kemp
 instituted here an Oratory or Chappel, which is yet annexed to the House, but the Mansion it self was built by Sir 
Thomas Kempe,
 made Knight of the 
Bath,
 at the marriage of Prince 
Arthur,
 eldest Son to 
Henry
 the seventh, and in this Name the possession continued, till Sir 
Thomas Kempe
 this mans Successor deceased without Issue-male, and left four Daughters and Coheirs, matched with 
Diggs, Cutts, Chichley,
 and 
Skipwith;
 who all by mutual Consent did devest themselves of their right to this place, and by Sale transmitted it to Sir 
Timothy Thornhil,
 whose Grandchild Mr. 
Hen. Thornhil
 (though not without much strugling and Contest, there being lately another Title derived from 
Reginald Kempe,
 Brother to Sir 
Tho.
 set up against his) does hold the instant propriety of it.




Wilmington
 is an ancient Seat in this Parish which had formerly the Reputation of a Mannor, and was parcel of the Revenue of the noble Family of 
Corbie;
 for 
Robert de Corbie
 did enjoy it at his Death, which was in the thirty ninth year of K. 
Edward
 the third: and after this Family was dislodged from the Possession, the 
Chivalers
 came in and enjoyed the Inheritance, for 
William Chivaler
 held it at his Decease, which was in the first year of 
Richard
 the second, after whom 
John Mowbray
 Duke of 
Norfolk,
 possest it about the year 1461, who dying without Issue, 
John Howard
 his Kinsman was invested with the Title of Duke of 
Norfolk,
 as being descended from the Lady 
Margaret
 Daughter of 
Thomas de Brotherton
 first Duke of 
Norfolk
 in the first year of 
Richard
 the third, and with his Title he had the Inheritance of 
Wilmington,
 which did not remain knit any long space to his Name: for in the year 1486, he found an un∣timely Sepulcher with his Master 
Richard
 the third in the Ruines of 
Bosworth Field,
 where he offered up his Life to the Cause of that Prince, as a grateful Expiation of those Favours which he had received from his Bounty, after whose Decease this place by Escheat was swallowed up in the revenue of the Crown, where the Possession slum∣bered, till K. 
Edward
 the sixth about the second year of his reign granted it to 
Edward Paget
 Esquire, in which Family it resided until our Fathers Memory, and then it was conveyed to 
Barrow.


Bilting
 is another place in 
Wye
 of no vulgar Estimate. It lies partly in 
Godmersham,
 and partly in this Parish, and was for many hundred years the patrimony of a Family which bore that Sirname, and remained linked to their Demeasn, until the ninth year of Q. 
Elizabeth:
 and then 
William Bilting
 deceasing without Issue, 
Arthur Franklin,
 and 
Richard Vidian
 were found to be his Heirs, and upon the Division of the Estate into parcels, this swelled the Estate of 
Franklin
 with a new Addition, and continued in that Name, until not many years since partly by Sale, and partly by Marriage it was settled upon Mr. 
William Cowper
 of 
Maidstone,
 upon whose late Decease it is now devolved by successive Right to his Descendant Mr. ....... 
Cowper
 now in his Mi∣noritie.


Perry Court
 is the next place which obliges us to a Consideration. It was wrapped up, in that Demeasn which related to the Colledge of 
Wye,
 and was purchased by Cardinal 
John Kempe
 of 
Thomas Aldon
 (whose Ancestors had held it many De∣scents before) in the twenty eighth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, and by him annexed to the Colledge above mentioned, of his own Institution and Foundation: But the publick Dissolution in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth having snatched it away, it was by the Grant of that Prince made the Inheritance of Mr. 
John Buckler,
 who about the beginning of 
Edward
 the sixth, passed it away to Sir 
William Damsell
 emploid as Agent from that Prince to the Crown of 
France,
 and he going out in four Daughters and Coheirs, one of them by matching with 
Burston
 made it upon the disunion of the the Body of the Estate into parcels, a Limb of his patrimony; and remained so, until our Fathers remembrance, and then it was conveyed to 
Moil
 of 
Buckwell,
 and was not many years since conveyed by 
Robert Moile
 Esquire, alienated by Sale to Sir 
Thomas Finch,
 afterwards Earl of 
Winchelsey,
 Father to 
Heneage Finch
 Earl of 
Winchelsey
 now Proprietary of it.


Raymonds
 is the last place of Account in 
Wye,
 which afforded a Seat, and gave a Sirname to a Family so called, and were eminent in this Parish many hundred years since, as being Stewards to the Abby of Battle for Lands near this place, and it is probable this place was the original Seminary or Fountain from whence the 
Raimonds
 of 
Essex, Norfolk,
 and other Counties in this Nation, deduced their primitive Ex∣traction: But to advance in my discourse: this Family of 
Raymond
 having long since abandoned the Signory of this place, it hath been for sundry Descents the Inheritance of 
Beck,
 and is still entituled to the propriety of one of this Name and Family.








Y. Y. Y. Y.


YAlding
 in the Hundred of 
Twyford:
 It was in old 
Saxon
 Orthography written 
Ealding
 from the Watry Situation of the Meadows. It was made eminent by being parcel of the Inheritance of the Earls of 
Gloucester
 whose Sirname was 
de Clare,
 un∣der whose Signory it remained till 
Gilbert de Clare
 Earl of 
Gloucester
 and 
Hertford,
 who deceased in the eighth year of 
Edward
 the second, and left 
Margaret de Clare
 his sole Heir, who was married to 
Hugh de Audley,
 who became, in right of his Wife, Lord of the propriety of 
Yalding,
 and Earl of 
Gloucester
 likewise; but enjoyed neither no con∣siderable space of Time; for he died in the twenty first year of 
Edward
 the first, and left no Issue Male: so that 
Margaret Audley
 became his Heir, who by matching with 
Rafe
 Earl of 
Stafford,
 cast it into his patrimony; and he at his Death, which was in the forty sixth year of 
Edward
 the third in her right was found to be possest of it; and in this Family did the Inheritance fix it self till the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then 
Edward Stafford
 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 descended in a direct line from the above∣said 
Rafe Stafford,
 having by his own improvidence and miscarriage laid himself open to the Malitious Assaults of Cardinal 
Wolsey,
 He by blowing of wild Conjectures into the Ears of King 
Henry
 the eighth, blew up the fire of his rage into that height and fury, that nothing could extinguish it but the Blood of this Peer poured out by an untimely Effusion upon the Scaffold: upon whose infortunate Decease his Estate by Forfeiture and Escheat devolved to the Crown. And K. 
Henry
 the eighth suddenly after granted 
Yalding
 to his Kinsman 
Hen. Somerset
 E. of 
Worcester,
 whose Father 
Charles Somerset
 he in the seventh year of his Government by a new Creation had adorned with that Title; from whom not long after it was by purchase incorporated into the Patrimony of 
Nevill
 Baron of 
Aburgavenny,
 whose Successor is 
John Nevill
 both in the Barony, and in the Inheritance of 
Yalding.


Woodfold
 is a place not to be declined without some Consideration; because it was a place formerly of no contemptible repute: for 
Anselmus de Quintin,
 originally issued out from the ancient Family of 
Boupton
 in 
Wiltshire
 held it in the twentieth year of 
Edward
 the third, by the fourth part of a Knights Feee, (as the Book of 
Aid
 testifies) at the making the Black Prince Knight; and here after the Possession divers years had resi∣ded, it shrunk away from this Family, and by purchase was carried into the Inheritance of 
Burton,
 where likewise it was some Generations settled, till the same Vicissitude, made it as inconstant here, as it had been to the former Family, and by Sale transported the right of it to 
Vane,
 a younger Branch of 
Vane
 Earl of 
Westmerland,
 in whose Name and Posterity the Patrimonial Interest of it continues still wrapt up.


Lodingford
 is another mannor in 
Yalding,
 which belonged to the priory of 
Bermond∣sey,
 and upon the Suppression of that magnificent Cloister, was annexed to the revenue of the Crown, but made no long abode there: for 
Henry
 the eighth granted it to 
Tho. VVood
 Esquire, and he not long after alienated it by Sale to 
George Fane
 Esquire, An∣cestor to the right Honourable 
Mildmay Fane,
 now Earl of 
VVestmerland,
 the instant Lord of the Fee.


Yalding
 had the Grant of a Market to be observed there weekly, procured to it by 
Hugh de Audley;
 and a Fair to continue three Days yearly, 
viz.
 the 
Vigil,
 the Day of 
St. Peter
 and 
Paul,
 and the subsequent to it, as appears, 
Pat.

The Description of the ISLANDS.


ELmeley
 is an Island not farre removed from 
Feversham,
 but yet is situated in the Hundred of 
Milton,
 it was in elder Times parcel of the Demeasn of 
Peyforer. Fulk de Peyforer
 held it at his Death, which was in the fifth year of 
Edward
 the first, from whom it was transported by Descent to his Son 
Fulk de Peyforer,
 who like∣wise was in possession of it at his Decease, which was in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the second: but before the latter end of 
Edward
 the third, this Name and Family was shrunk into a Daughter and Heir called 
Julian,
 who by matching with 
Thomas St. Leger,
 annexed that Interess that Family had in this Island to his Inheritance, and from him the like Vicissitude carried it off to 
Hen. Aucher,
 who had espoused 
Joan
 his Coheir; but before the latter end of 
Hen.
 the fifth his right in 
Elmeley
 was by Sale transplanted into 
Cromer
 of 
London,
 who likewise before had purchased some proportion of Estate which the Heirs of

 
Hastings
 had in this Island by a right deduced from 
Mayney;
 for Sir 
VValter de Mayney
 Knight of the Garter, died the forty ninth year of 
Edward
 the third, and left onely a Sole Daughter and Heir called 
Anno,
 who by matching with 
John Hastings
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 brought 
Tunstall
 and much other Land here in 
Elme∣ley
 and elsewhere, to be the patrimony of that Family: But to proceed: 
Elmeley
 being thus entirely made the Demeasn of 
Cromer,
 continued linked, to this Family many Descents, until Sir 
James Cromer
 the last of this Name almost in our memory died and left three Daughters and Coheirs surviving (for 
Martha
 the fourth died unmarried) to share his Estate. 
Frances
 was matched to Sir 
Mathew Carew, Elizabeth
 married Sir 
John Steed,
 and 
Christian
 espoused Sir 
John Hales;
 and so these three dividing 
Elmeley▪
 the Descendants which claimed from 
Carew
 and 
Steed,
 have very lately by Sale conveyed theirs, and so by Consequence the Sole Interest of this Island unto Sir 
Edward Hales
 of 
Tunstal.


Graine
 Island lies in the Hundred of 
Hoo,
 and had still the same Owners with the Mannor of 
Malmains
 in 
Stoke
 not farre distant. 
Nicholas Malmains
 held it at his Death which was in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the third, and from him did the Title stream in this Family until the beginning of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then it went away by Sale to 
Iden
 of 
Ripley Court
 in 
Westwell,
 and in this Family did the Possession dwell, untill the beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then it was alienated to 
John Parks
 Gentleman, and he not long after dying without Issue Male, 
Elizabeth
 his Sole In∣heritrix, who was wedded to 
John Roper
 of 
Bedmaneore
 in 
Lingsted
 Esquire united it to his Patrimony, and from him is it now descended to his Successor 
Christopher Roper
 the instant Baron of 
Tenham.


Hartie
 lies in the Hundred of 
Feversham,
 and did anciently acknowledge the Do∣minion of the Abbot and Covent of 
Feversham,
 until 
John,
 Abbot of that place in the tenth year of 
Henry
 the eighth obtained a Licence from the Crown to alienate it to 
Thomas Colepeper
 Esquire; but here its abode was of no long Moment; for about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth it was transmitted by Sale to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney,
 whose Son the Lord 
Henry Cheyney
 about the middle of Q. 
Elizabeth
 passed it away to 
Samuel Thornhill
 Esquire great Grand-father to Mr. ....... 
Thornhill,
 the instant Owner of it.


Oxney
 Island is an Hundred within it self. The first place of eminence which offers it self to a Survey, is 
Witresham,
 which anciently belonged to the Monks of 
Christ∣church,
 and was given to that Cloister, in the year 132, by 
Edsin
 Bishop of St. 
Martins
 without 
Cant.
 but upon the Suppression of that Covent in the reign of 
Hen.
 the eighth, this Mannor with all its appendant was Immunities granted to 
Hen. Crispe
 Esq; whose Son 
Nicholas Crispe,
 held it the sixth of Q. 
Eliz.
 and after him 
James Hales
 Esquire: and he in the thirteenth of that Princess alienated it to 
Freak,
 in which Family it re∣mained

untill the Beginning of King 
James;
 and then it was conveyed by Sir 
Thomas Freak,
 to Sir 
Thomas Bishop,
 and he in the sixteenth year of the abovesaid Prince, gave it in marriage with his Daughter Mrs. 
Jane Bishop,
 to 
Edward Alford
 Esquire; and she in right of that original Settlement does now hold this Mannor.


Palstre
 is another Mannor in 
Witresham,
 which represents to us the memory of 
John de Palstre,
 who was anciently Lord of the Fee: but before the end of 
Edward
 the third, this Family was vanished; and then the 
Charles's,
 a Family of generous rank at 
Addington
 were setled in the possession, and 
Richard Charles
 held it, in the fifth year of 
Richard
 the second, and so did 
Nicholas Charles,
 who dyed possest of it in the ele∣venth year of that Prince, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 16. And from this Family by 
Alice
 one of the Coheirs, it devolved to 
William Snath,
 and he concluding in a Daughter and Heir, she by matching with 
Watton,
 brought it to be united to the patrimony of this Family. And here it made its Re dence untill the reign of 
Heury
 the sixth; and then it was passed away to 
Robert Rudston
 Esquire, who being embarked in the reign of Queen 
Mary,
 in the Design of Sir 
Thomas Wiatt,
 although he did not forfeit his Life, yet he did that of his Estate, which by the special Indulgence of that Princesse, was granted back to him, in the second year of her reign, in which this was involved, which remained with this Family untill allmost our Time; and then it was passed a∣way to Sir 
Edward Henden,
 one of the Barons of the Exchequer, who dying not long since without Issue, gave it to his Nephew Sir 
John Henden,
 Father to 
Edw. Henden
 Esq; the instant Lord of the Fee.


Owlye
 is another Mannor in 
Witresham,
 which anciently was written 
Ovely,
 as having owners of that Sirname, who stayed not here untill the Beginning of 
Richard
 the second, but were extinguished, and left the possession to 
Ao Odiarne,
 a Family ancient∣ly of good Note. After whom I cannot (because the private Evidences are embezel'd) discover what Families were successively planted in the possession. Only I find it about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, in the possession of 
Mayney
 of 
Biddenden,
 in whom the Interest continued, untill some few years since it was alienated by Sir 
John Mayney
 of 
Linton
 Knight and Baronet, to 
Peter Ricaut
 Esquire, who hath lately alie∣nated his right in it to Mr. 
Menell
 of 
London.


Ebeney
 was given to the Monks of 
Christchurch
 in 
Canterbury,
 by K. 
Athulfus,
 at the particular entreaty and instigation of 
Ceolnoth
 the Arch-bishop, in the year 832, to the Reparation of their Cloister and Cathedral. The words registred in the Latine Record are these, 
Anno Domini
 832, 
Rex Athulfus instinctu Ceolnothi Archiepiscopi dedit Ebeneyam ad opus Monachorum, Libere sicut Adisham.
 But when the Im∣pieties of the Monks, who had cloistered up Religion it self in a Lazy Cell, grew so clamorous, that they called for Vengeance upon their Seminaties, that Storm arose in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, which by the Dissolution of their Covents, expiated their Irregularities; this Mannor was surrendered to the Crown, and the abovesaid Prince, in the thirty second year of his Government, granted it to Sir 
Walter Henley
 Serjeant at Law, who dying without Issue-male, his three Daughters, namely 
Eliza∣beth
 married to 
William Waller
 Esquire, 
Hellen
 first wedded to 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Bedge∣bury
 Esquire; secondly to Sir 
George Somerset;
 and thirdly to 
Thomas Vane
 of 
Burston
 Esquire; and 
Anne
 matched to 
Richard Covert
 of 
Slaugham,
 as his Coheirs entered upon his Inheritance, and then this place upon the Division of his estate, increased the Demeasn of 
Richard Covert
 Esquire, from whom by the Devolution of a descendant right, the title is now lodged in his Successor Mr...... 
Covert.


VVoodrove
 in 
Ebeney,
 acknowledged in elder Ages a Family for proprietaries, known by the Name of 
Mocking,
 who had a revenue likewise about 
Milton, Stockbury, Hartlip
 and 
Shepey,
 of no despicable Bulk. 
John Mocking
 Son of 
VVilliam Mocking
 flourished under the Scepter of 
Edward
 the first, 
Edward
 the second, and held this Mannor at his Decease, which was in the eleventh year of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 75. And in this Family did the possession fix, untill the reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then it began to ebbe away from this Name, and flow by the conveyance of Sale into 
Guldford:
 and in a very old Schedule which enumerates the Mannors, which related to 
John Guldford,
 who lived under the Government of 
Henry
 the fourth and 
Henry
 the fifth, this is registred in the Catalogue; and from him did it come down to Sir 
Edward Guldford,
 whose Daughter and Heir 
Joan,
 brought it to be the

patrimony of 
John Dudley
 Duke of 
Northumberland,
 and he gave this Mannor with no small demeasn at 
Halden,
 in Dower with 
Mary
 his Daughter, matched to Sir 
Hen. Sidney
 Lord Deputy of 
Ireland,
 and Knight of the Garter, a person of that Value and Eminence, that he that would discover him represented in his best Features and proportion must view him in his Worthy and Signal undertakings in 
Ireland,
 where he will find him better pourtraid, than he can be by any faint or drowsie Attributes, that drop from my humble and unequal pen; and from him did this Mannor in right of this Alliance, descend to his Grandchild the right honorable 
Robert
 Earl of 
Lei∣cester,
 who not many years since passed it away to Sir 
Edward Hendon,
 one of the Barons of the Exchequer, who upon his Decease gave it to his Nephew Sir 
John Hondon
 of 
Biddenden,
 and he not long since alienated it to Mr. 
John Austin
 of 
Tenter∣den;
 from whom it is lately devolved by Death, to be now the possession of his second Brother Mr. 
Rob. Austin
 of 
Hall-place
 in 
Bexley.


Brocket
 is another Mannor in 
Ebeney
 which had possessors as appears by ancient Deeds of that Name, who likewise were written in Evidences 
Brocket;
 but whether the 
Brockets
 of 
Brocket-hall
 in the County of 
Hartford,
 were descended from these, or these from them, I cannot discover: But the greatest honor which this obscure Mannor hath acquired, is, that ever since the reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, untill the thirtieth year of 
Henry
 the eighth, it acknowledged the noble Family of 
Guldford;
 and then it changed its proprietaries: for that year it was by 
John Guldford
 Esquire, conveyed to Sir 
John Hales
 Baton of the Exchequer, from whom it is now come down to own the proprietary of his Descendant, Sir 
Edward Hales
 of 
Tunstall
 Baronet.


The Island of 
Shepey,
 comes next to be treated of: It called by 
Ptolomie Toliatis,
 in Latin 
Insula Ovium,
 in Saxon 
Sceapige,
 all agreeing in their Verdict, that it was so named from its plenty of Sheep. It is environed with the mixed Waters of the 
Thames,
 and 
Medway
 on the West, the 
Swale
 or 
Genlade
 on the South, and the Main Ocean beats on the East and North; more celebrated for the fertility of the Soil, then Salurbity of Air which is grosse and thick, causing Aguish Infirmities, that keep long Residence, they get possession,


Quinborough,
 or rather originally 
Kingsborough,
 as 
Konisbergh
 in 
Prussia,
 is now cor∣ruptly called 
Quensborough,
 acknowledged King 
Edward
 the third for the Founder, who (having wedded 
Philippa
 Daughter of 
William
 Earl of 
Henault
 and 
Holland,
 and his oc∣casions often calling him to passe into her Fathers Dominion, whose Aid and Assistance he required in the great enterprise, for the Recovery of his undoubted right to the Diadem of 
France
) heerected this strong and stately Fottresse for defence of the mouth of the 
Thames,
 and his own secure Accomodation. And because the Situation of this place was unhealthy, he (to allure Inhabitants) in the year 1366, enobled the Town with a Charter of Incorporation, wherein he indulges by Grant ample priviledges and Immunities unto it, as namely to hold two Mercates weekly, one on the Munday and the other on the Thursday; and two Fairs yearly, one at the Feast of St. 
James,
 the other on the twenty fourth of 
March,
 and to make Choice of Burgesses to send to Parlia∣ment. The principal Architect and Surveyout of the work, was 
William Wickham,
 after Bishop of 
Winchester,
 who had been formerly employed in that kind, at the re∣edifying 
Windsor-castle,
 when his good patron 
John de Vuedal,
 was Constable there. This man used to inscribe on the edifices thus erected, this Inscription, This made 
VVickham,
 whereby some conceived, he arrogated to himself the Cost and payment of the Structure, and informed the King thereof: but his ingenious exposition satisfied that Prince, when he shewed him that by his Inspection and Insight into those matters, he had obtained both his Ecclesiastical and secular promotions, being made Bishop of 
Winchester,
 first Keeper of the privy Seal, and then of the King's Conscience, his last Gradation or Ascent being to be Lord Chancellor of 
England.
 When King 
Edward
 had perfected this Castle, he instituted a Chief Governour, who was for the future, to carry the Title of Constable, like as at 
Dover-castle,
 and elsewhere. The Catalogue of those who succeeded in that Command, I have set down. The care and cost of King 
Henry
 the eighth, in the year 1536 to repair this place, when he erected Fortresses for Defence of the Sea Coast, drew this Eulogie from the Pen of 
Leland,

Minster
 is the next place of Account in this Island, and is contracted from the Latin Word 
Monasterium,
 from whence this Town hath its Appellation, and may chal∣lenge the third place amongst our 
English
 Nunneries. For 
Sexburga
 Daughter to 
Ercombert
 King of 
Kent
 (to whom and the Virgin 
Mary,
 the Church of this Parish is devoted and dedicated) in the year 664, erected a Religious House at this place, and liberally endowed it, for the Sustentation of vayled Virgins. The second was founded by 
Eanswith
 Daughter of 
Eadbald
 King of 
Kent,
 at 
Folkston.
 And the first had its Institution at 
Liminge,
 likewise in this County, by 
Eadburga,
 and erected to the Honor of the Virgin 
Mary
 and St. 
Mildred.
 But the Antiquity of this Cell, and the Sanctity attributed to it by elder times, could not so skreen or rescue it from the Heat of War, but it was thrice sacked and dismantled by the barbarous irruptions of the 
Danes,
 within lesse then an Age, which by usual Account is said to be thirty year. The first mis∣fortune happened to it in the year 832, when thirty five Sail of them rived here and rifled it. The second and third time, was in the year 851 and then again in the year 855, by the Armies of them who wintered their Ships within this Island. Besides these depredations the complices of Earl 
Godwin,
 and his Sons, in the Time of their proscription and exile, which was in the year 1052, landed in this Island, and mi∣serably harrassed it, by filling all places with Ruine and Devastation. Indeed Reli∣gion when it glitters with a splendid and full revenue, is like the Pictures of the an∣cient Saints, apparelled in rich Garments, which some have been enticed to rob, not out of ill Will to their Sanctity, but love to their Shrines, and Beauty of their Cloaths; Persecution and the Robes of Humility were the Attire of the primitive Church, and when she is dressed up in gaudy Fortunes, it is no more then she merits: Yet sometimes it occasions the Devil, to cheat her of her Holinesse; and impious men by an unjust and injurious Sacriledge, to cheat her of her riches. But I have digressed: I now return into the Track of my Discourse, and must inform my Reader, that although the Glory of this Cloister, was so bowed down and broken with these misfortunes, that it appeared almost sunk in its own Calamities: yet by the piety of subsequent Ages, it was buoyed up again: but more especially by the indulgent Charity of King 
Henry
 the fourth, who in the first year of his reign confirmed their old priviledges, and to those added by patent many new. And in this Condition it

continued untill the general Dissolution or Deluge, and then it was by 
Henry
 the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his reign granted to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney:
 and his Son 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney,
 having in the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 exchanged it for other Lands with that Princesse; she regranted it to Sir 
Edward Hobby,
 who had matched with her Kinswoman 
Margaret,
 Daughter of 
Henry
 Lord 
Hunsdon,
 and his Son Sir 
Edward Hobby,
 about the middle of King 
James
 passed it away to Mr. 
Hen. Richards,
 and he upon his Decease bequeathed it to 
Gabriel Livesey
 Esquire; and he, almost in our Remembrance, conveyed it to Sir 
John Heyward,
 who setled it upon his two Feoffees in Trust, Sir 
Francis Buller
 of 
Cornwall,
 and Serjeant 
Clerk
 of 
Roche∣ster,
 for such Charitable Uses, as they should think proportionate to that Convey∣ance,


The Mannor of 
Northwood,
 is situated in this Parish, which was the Inheritance of 
Jordanus de Scapeia,
 for so he is written in old datelesse Deeds, and he had Issue 
Stephen de Northwood,
 who was the first whom I find in Record, to have assumed this Appellation, and he was Father to Sir 
Roger de Northwood,
 who lies buryed in 
Minster
 Church, with an Inscription affixed to his Monument, which seems by its more mo∣dern Character, to have been corrupted; It is this: 
Hic jacet Rogerus Northwood, Miles, sepultus ante Conquestum.
 Indeed his Figure is fairly insculped in Brasse, with that of his Lady 
Bona
 lying by him, who was Sister and Heir of 
William de Wauton.
 The vulgar upon a credulous errour every where affirm, that all those who are thus buryed, were enterr'd after the Conquest; when it is certain that many were entom∣bed in this posture, many years before the Conquerour, that had obliged themselves by Vow, to defend the Crosse and Sepulcher of our Saviour, against the Fury and Assaults of Infidels. Sure I am, the Tomb next to this appears to be far more ancient, and of so venerable a Form, that its like doth not occurre in any other place; there is not any Letter of Inscription left, only the Coat is a sure Testimony, that it was one of the Ancestors of the Family of 
Northwood.
 But to proceed: 
John Norwood
 one of this House, as the private Records of the Family testifie, feasted 
H.
 the fifth, at the 
Red Lion
 in 
Sedingbourne,
 and the Wine amounted upon the wole account but to 9. s. and 9. d. Wine being then rated but at a penny the pint. 
W. Northwood
 another of this Name, and Family, did signal Service at the Battel of 
Agincourt,
 and afterwards at the Battel of 
Vernoile,
 which was managed by 
John
 Duke of 
Bedford,
 Regent of 
France.
 He was Kinsman of 
John Northwood,
 who was the last of this Name at this place; for he a∣bout the latter end of 
Edward
 the fourth, alienated it to 
VVilliam VVarner
 Esquire; whose Son and Heir 
VVilliam VVarner,
 about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the eighth, de∣mised it to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney,
 and his Son Sir 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney,
 having exchanged it for other Lands with Queen 
Elizabeth,
 it remained with the Crown, untill King 
James
 in the second year of his reign, granted it to the right honorable 
Philip Herbert
 Earl of 
Montgomery,
 and afterwards Earl of 
Pembroke.


Newhall
 is another little Mannor in 
Minster,
 which 
Fulke Peyforer
 dyed seised of, in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the second; and from him it devolved by descent to be the pa∣trimony of his great Grandchild 
Fulk Peyforer,
 and his Sole Heir 
Julian
 carried it a∣way to 
Thomas St. Leger
 of 
Ottringden,
 whose two Female Coheirs being matched to 
Aucher
 and 
Ewias,
 shared his Inheritance, and about the reign of 
Henry
 the fifth, passed it away by Sale to 
Cromer,
 whose Successor 
VVilliam Cromer,
 having about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, by some misdemeanor, forfeited it to the Crown, it was granted to one 
Stephen Graine,
 in which Family it remained untill the Begin∣ning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and then it was alienated to 
Small;
 from which Name, the same Vicissitude not many years since carried it off to 
Luck;
 who transmitted his Right in it to Mr. 
Henry Newton,
 who hath lately demised it to Mr. 
Josias Gering
 of 
London.


Rishingdon
 is the last place of Account, which is circumscribed within the Limits of 
Minster.
 It was in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first, wrapped up in the patrimony of 
Savage:
 for at that time 
John de Savage
 obtained a Charter of Free∣warrren, to several of his Mannors in 
Kont,
 in the Number of which this is registered for one; but in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, the possession was departed from this Family, being purchased by 
Philippa
 Wife and Queen to 
Edward
 the third, and setled upon the Hospital of St. 
Katharines
 neere the 
Tower,
 in whose demeasn it hath layn

involved ever since. In the fourteenth year of the reign of 
Richard
 the second, 
John
 of 
Gaunt
 Duke of 
Lancaster,
 the King's Uncle, was Lessee to that Hospital, as ap∣pears 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 113. Which I mention to discover to the Reader, that even in those Times, Persons of the greatest eminence did not disdain to be Tenants for an Estate to an Hospital.


East-Church
 is the next place which comes to be considered: Which though ob∣scure in it self, yet is made eminent by 
Shurland,
 which is a Limb of this Parish, and anciently did own a noble Family which bore that Sirname; the last of which was Sir 
Robert de Shurland,
 who was one of those 
Kentish
 Bannerets, which were made by King 
Edward
 the first, at the Siege of 
Carlaverock,
 in the twenty eighth year of his reign, and to whom the former Prince, as a farther Symbol or Testimony of his Merit, granted a Charter of Free-warren in the twenty ninth year of his reign, to his Mannor of 
Shurland:
 not long after which he deceased, and lies entombed under an Arch in the Southwall, with his pourtraicture insculped in a Marble, in 
Minster
 Church, whose Tomb is become the Scene of much Falshood and popular errour; the vulgar having digged out of his Vault, many wild Legends and Roman∣ces, as namely that he buryed a Priest alive, that he swam on his horse two miles thorough the Sea, to the King, who was then neer this Island on Shipboard, to pur∣chase his pardon; and having obtained it, swam back to the Shore: where being arrived, he cut off the head of his said Horse, because it was affirmed, he had acted this by Magick: and that riding on hunting a twelvemoneth after, his horse stumbled and threw him on the Scull of his former Horse, which blow so bruised him, that from that Contusion he contracted an inward impostumation, of which he dyed; and in memory of which, an Horse Head is placed at his Feet; which fictitious Story, is rent into the disunion of so many absurd circumstances, that I shall represent to the Reader, the Founda∣tion on which this fabulous Natrative was formerly established, which is no more but this. Sir 
Robert de Shurland
 above-mentioned, being Lord Warden of the Cinque∣ports, and a man of eminent Authority under 
Edward
 the first, obtained Grant of pri∣viledge by Charter, to have wrack of Sea upon his Lands confining on the Sea Shore, neere 
Shurland:
 now the extent of this Royaltie is evermore esteemed to reach as far into the Water, upon a low ebb, as a man can ride in, and touch any thing with the point of his Launce, and so you have the explication of this marvel; and the cou∣ching either of whole Creatures, or part of them, at the Feet of worthy personages, is most frequent both now and in elder Times, that these inanimate Representations might be the Symbols or Hieroglyphicks, to intimate to posterity those Virtues which were resident in them when alive. But to proceed: the abovementioned Sir 
Robert de Shurland,
 having improved his Reputation with many noble and worthy Actions, left That only to perpetuate his Name to posterity, having no Issue-male to continue it: for he left only one Daughter and Heir, matched to 
W. de Cheyney
 of 
Patricksbourn Cheyney,
 who was son and heir to Sir 
Alexander de Cheyney,
 who is in the Inventory or List of those Knights Bannerets, who were ennobled with that Dignity, by 
E.
 the first, at the Siege of 
Carlaverock,
 in the twenty eighth year of his reign, and in Right of this Match, dyed possest of it, in the eighth year of 
E.
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 58. And from him did it come down to his great Grandchild, Sir 
John Cheyney
 who was Knight of the Garter, and frequently Knight of this Shire, in sundry Parliaments, under the Government of 
Henry
 the fourth, in the first year of whose reign, as our Chronicles inform us, he was sent Embassador to several forreign Princes, to represent to them the Reasons or Motives which induced him to assume the 
English
 Diadem, and in the first and second year of that Prince, he was chosen Speaker of Parliament. Sir 
William Cheyney
 another of this Family of 
Shurland,
 was first a Judge, and secondly Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, in the reign of 
Henry
 the fifth: but the greatest Honour this Mannor atchieved, was when it came to be possest by Sir 
Thomas Cheyney
 who was Knight of the Garter, Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, Constable of 
Quinborough
 Castle, and one of the Privy Councel to 
Henry
 the eighth, and he had Issue Sir 
Henry Cheyney,
 created 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney
 of 
Tuddington
 by Queen 
Eliza∣beth,
 who having exchanged this Mannor of 
Shurland
 with that Princesse, it remai∣ned with the patrimony of the Crown, untill the second year of King 
James;
 and then it was by royal Concession from that Prince, made the Inheritance of 
Philip
 Earl

of 
Montgomery,
 and after of 
Pembroke,
 upon whose late decease it is now come to con∣fesse the Signory of his second Son Mr. 
James Herbert.

 is another Mannor in this Parish, whose Name tacitly intimates to us, that it was involved formerly in the Revenue of the Crown, and was the place which the Inhabitants frequented, not only for the holding of a Court, for the choice and election of the Constables of the Island: but likewise here assembled to nomi∣nate and appoint those Wardens or Bailiffs, that were to take Cognisance or Charge of the passage called 
King ferry;
 which divides the Island, and the main Land of me County; this Mannor after it had for many Generations layn folded up in the royal Demeasne, was by Queen 
Elizabeth,
 granted to Mr. 
Henry Cary;
 who about the Be∣ginning of K. 
James,
 passed it away to 
Swaleman,
 whose Descendant is still entituled to the propriety of it.


Leisdon
 next offers it selfe up to our view, which was parcel of that estate which acknowledged the noble and ancient Family of 
Grey
 or 
Rotherfield
 in 
Sussex
 for its an∣cient Owners, The first which made this Family eminent was 
John de Grey,
 who was frequently summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron, in the reign of 
Edward
 the third, and dyed possest of this Mannor in the thirty third year of that Prince, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 38. And so did 
Robert Grey
 his Successor, in the second year of 
Henry
 the fourth. After his 
Exit,
 I do not find it long constant to the Signory of this Name: for about the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth it was alienated to 
Lovell;
 and by virtue of this pur∣chase, Sir 
William Lovell
 held it at his Death, which was in the twenty third year of 
Henry
 the sixth. After this Family had abandoned the possession, the 
Cheyneys
 of 
Shurland
 were by purchase planted in the Inheritance, and remained setled in the Fee-simple of it, untill Sir 
Henry
 Lord 
Cheyney,
 exchanged it with Queen 
Eli∣zabeth.


Nuts
 called so vulgarly, but in the ancient Court-rolls named 
Notts,
 as being the Inheritance of a Family called 
Nott,
 is a little Mannor in 
Leisdon,
 which after it had for many descents acknowledged no other proprietaries, but this Family, about the Beginning of 
Edward
 the fourth, was rent from them by purchase, and transplanted into 
Bartholomew,
 a Family which were Owners anciently of much Land about 
Ling∣sted, Throuley,
 and other places in that Track, and continued Masters of this Lordship, untill the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth; and then it was conveyed to Sir 
Thomas Cheyney;
 whose Son Sir 
Henry Cheyney
 about the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 passed it away to 
Sampson,
 a Family which had been possessors of 
Sampson-court,
 not far distant many hundred years; and were descended from 
William Sampson,
 who was frequently sum∣moned to sit in Parliament as Baron in the reign of 
Edward
 the first. From 
Sampson
 it was again in our Fathers Memory carried off to 
O
borne,
 in the Descendants of which Family the right is still fixed.


Werdon
 is the last place of Account in this Island; It was in times of an elder In∣scription involved in the Inheritance of 
Savage
 of 
Bobbing,
 and in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the first, Sir 
John de Savage
 obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of 
Werdon:
 But before the middle of 
Edward
 the third, this Family had surrendered their Interest here to 
Fremingham;
 for 
John de Fremingham
 dyed seised of it, in the twenty third year of 
Edward
 the third: but whether it devolved with other Land by the Heir general of 
Fremingham
 to 
Isley
 or not, is incertain, because those privtae evidences which relate to this Mannor, extend no higher then the reign of 
Edward
 the fourth; and then I find the propriety of it in 
Norton,
 in which Family after the pos∣session had resided untill our times, it was conveyed to 
Edmund Tooke
 of 
Dartford
 Esq; Barrister at Law, now proprietary of it.


Thanet
 lies, if not all, yet most part of it, circumscribed within the Hundred of 
Ringleslow:
 It is styled in Greek by ancient Authors 
, in Latine 
Thanetum,
 and in the Saxon it is curtailed into 
Thanet,
 which an old Manuscript which I have seen, de∣duces from two Saxon Words 
Thane
 and 
Yete,
 which in that Language then implyed as much as the Lords-Entrance: but for my particular, I believe that the Saxons, when upon the Donation of it to them by 
Vortiger,
 they first entered into this Island, fin∣ding that 
Thanetum
 was a Latine Name imposed upon it by the Romans, who had but newly then deserted the Protection of this Island, new-softned the Name by contra∣cting

it, and then quilted it into the Alphabet of their own Language, and called it 
Thanett;
 and that this is probable, I shall evince from circumstances, 
Punio
 in La∣tine signifies to punish, from whence the 
Saxons
 styled that place by 
Maidstone,
 where they punished Malefactors 
Pinandun Hoath:
 So 
Castrum
 was a Name used by the Ro∣mans to signifie or expresse any Castle or Fortresse, which the 
Saxons
 upon their ad∣mission into this Island, finding it to be imposed upon all places of strength and im∣portance, adopted it into their Dialect, and from the word 
Castrum
 extracted the word 
Ceaster.
 I could instance in many other particulars, but that I should both weary my Reader, and clog this Discourse with Superfluities: I shall therefore from the untwi∣sting the Name, descend to the Description of the Island.


Serre,
 now vulgarly called 
Sarre,
 is the first place of Note which offers it self up to a view: It was anciently a Parish, untill peradventure the unhealthinesse of the Soile; for it now confines upon Marishes (where formerly glided that Gullet of Sea-water, now wholly stifled with Sand) which made 
Thanett
 an Island, as may plainly appear by an ancient Mapp, printed by the original, and now extant in the Book called 
Monasti∣cum Anglicanum
) or else from the insalubrity of the Air, which being polluted with those black and foggie vapours which ascend from a loose and soggie earth, very fre∣quently leave a venomous Tincture upon the Blood and Spirits of those Inhabitants, who are subject to the impression of such pernicious exhalations, forced those who dwelt in 
Serre,
 to abandon so sickly a Habitation; and so the Parish by degrees, began to languish away into that Solitude, we see it is shrunk into at present. The Church was dedicated to St. 
Giles,
 but at present lies entombed in such forgotten Ruines, that scarce the least Remains are visible. The Mannor it self was one of the ancient Seats of the noble Family of 
Crioll. Bertram de Crioll
 augments the Register of those 
Kentish
 Gentlemen, who were with 
Richard
 the first at the Siege of 
Acon
 in 
Palestine. Bartho∣lomew de Crioll
 another of this Name and Family, was Lieutenant of 
Dover-castle
 under the abovesaid Prince. 
Simon de Crioll
 was with 
Edward
 the first, at his prosperous Siege of 
Carlaverock,
 and for his generous Assistance there, received the Order of Knight∣hood, and from him it came down to Sir 
William Crioll,
 Father to Sir 
John Crioll
 who held it in the Beginning of 
Henry
 the sixth, as appears 
Pat.
 9. 
Hen.
 6. 
Par. prim. Memb.
 19. And from him was it transmitted to his Son Sir 
Thomas Keriell,
 Knight of the Garter, a Man of that worth and eminence, in that time he lived in, that I might seem something to obscure his Glory, if I should not represent to the Reader, some of those honorable Atchievements, which he performed in 
France,
 the Relation of which I have omitted in my Description of 
Stockbury
 and 
Walmer.
 In the ninth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, he being Governour of 
Gourney
 in 
Normandy,
 issuedout of that place, and harassed not only that Province, but fought with the Earl of 
Bretaigne,
 who was sent to oppose his Eruptions, and after a sharp Combat gave him a remark∣able discomfiture, killing about six hundred, and captivating two hundred Soldiers. In the fifteenth of 
Henry
 the sixth, he seised upon the Duke of 
Burgundie's
 Carriages and Cannons leaving 
Cretoy
 (a Fortresse then in possession of the 
English,
 and not long before distressed by the abovesaid Duke) furnished with victual for six hundred men, for the space of a twelvemonth. And lastly in the twenty seventh year of 
Henry
 the sixth, he was sent over into 
France,
 with a supply of 1500 men to recruit the 
English
 Army, where he did as much with so small a quantity of men, as could be expected from humane Courage, and having reduced some pieces of strength, he encountered the Earl of 
Clermont
 at a place called 
Formigney,
 where being overlaid with Multitude, after he had given most signal Testimony of his valour, and discharged all those duties which might have secured and preserved the Honor of the 
English
 Nation, and the Glory of the day, by which he declared himself to be not only a prudent Man, but an expert Commander, he was defeated: But to proceed, after the Family of 
Crioll
 went out from the possession of this place, which was before the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, 
John White
 Esquire, became Lord of the Fee, and held it at his Death, which was in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the fourth: but after his Decease it was not long re∣sident in this Name: for in the reign of 
Henry
 the seventh, and 
Henry
 the eighth, I find it the Inheritance of 
Bere,
 and was fixed in this Family, untill the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 and then it was passed away by Sale to 
Rush,
 ancestor to Sir 
Fran∣cis Rush,
 who not many years since concluding in two Daughters and Coheirs, one of

them by matching with Sir 
George Wentworth
 of 
Wentworth Woodhouse
 in 
York-shire,
 third Brother to Sir 
Thomas Wentworth,
 late Earl of 
Stafford,
 hath made it his instant patrimony.


Downebarton
 is the next place which occurs, and challenges our Survey. There was a Family Sirnamed 
Exeter,
 that had large possessions at or neer this place, and were planted in the Tenure of them many Centuries of years: In the fourth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, 
Margaret
 Widow of 
John Exeter,
 held Lands at 
Downebarton
 in Right of Dower, as appears by an Inquisition taken after her death, which commences from that time. But the principal Honor this place anciently recieved, was, that it was a Mannor which fell under the Signory of the Arch-bishops of 
Canterbury,
 as is mani∣fest by an Inquisition taken in the twenty first of 
Richard
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 7. Which represents to posterity what Lands and Mannors 
Thomas
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury
 held at that time; nor did it depart from the revenue of this Sea, until the 29. year of 
Henry
 the eighth; and then being exchanged with the Crown by 
Tho. Cran∣mer
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 it was granted away to 
Henry Crispe
 Esquire; in which Family it was fixed untill those times which were circumscribed within the Verge of our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was conveyed to 
Paramour,
 from which Name not many years since, the vicissitude of purchase carried it away, and hath now made it part of the demeasn of 
Daniel Harvey
 of 
Combe-nevill,
 in 
Kingston
 upon 
Thames
 Esquire.


Quekes
 in 
Birchington
 was the ancient Seat of an ancient Family which bore that Sir∣name, and after it had for many descents acknowledged it self to have related to that Name, it devolved by paternal descent to 
John Quekes,
 who about the Beginning of 
H.
 the seventh, expired in a Daughter and Heir who was matched to....
Crispe,
 extra∣cted from the 
Crispes
 of 
Oxfordshire,
 who had flourished there many Generations before, (as appears by an old pedigree now in the hands of Sir 
Nicholas Crispe
 of 
London
) under the Notion of Gentlemen of the best Rank; nor did this Family wither by being thus transplanted, and inoculated upon a forraign Stem, but rather did gather new Sap and Verdure, which made it so exceedingly sprout forth, that 
Henry Crispe
 Esquire, who was Sheriff of 
Kent
 in the thirty eighth of 
Henry
 the eighth, and was afterwards honoured with Knighthood, did shoot up to that power, and grew so tall in Title, that he was in the dialect of those Times called 
Regulus Insulae,
 or the Governour of the Isle of 
Thannet;
 and from this worthy person, is 
Henry Crispe
 Esquire, Heir to Sir 
Henry Crispe
 not long since deceased, and now proprietary of 
Quekes,
 originally de∣scended.


West-gate
 in 
Birchington
 was wrapped up in that vast demeasn which was entituled to the possession of the noble and powerful Family of 
Leybourn
 of 
Leybourn
-castle. 
Will. de Leybourn
 Son of 
Roger de Leybourn,
 held it at his Death, which was in the third year of 
Ed.
 the second, 
Rot. Esc. Num.
 56. And left it to 
Roger de Leybourn,
 from whom with the rest of his diffused patrimony in this County, it came to his only Daughter and Heir 
Juliana de Leybourn,
 first matched to 
Iohn de Hastings,
 Brother or Kinsman to 
Laurence de Hastings
 Earl of 
Pembroke,
 and then to 
William de Clinton
 Earl of 
Hunting∣don,
 but survived them both, and dying without Issue in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third, she made God her Heir to this Mannor, and gave it to the Abby of St. 
Au∣gustins,
 and in the patrimony of that Cloister did the Title of this Mannor lie locked up, untill the general Dissolution in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, unloosened it, and then linked it again by a new Augmentation to the demeasn of the Crown; and then the abovesaid Prince, in the thirty fifth year of his reign, granted it to Sir 
Tho. Moile,
 who not long after passed it away to 
Bere,
 a Family of good account in this Island, as being descended from 
Richard de Bere,
 who was one of the 
Recognitores magnae Assisae
 for 
Kent,
 in the second year of King 
John,
 as appears by the Pipe-roll of that time; and from this Name about the latter end of Q. 
Elizabeth,
 did it by purchase come over to 
Denne
 of 
Denne-hill
 in 
Kingston,
 whose Successor Mr. 
Thomas Denne
 of 
Denne-hill,
 Reader formerly of the Middle-Temple, and Recorder of 
Canterbury,
 dying lately without Issue-male, his four Daughters (
Thomazin
 married to Sir 
Nicholas Crispe, Bridget
 matched to Sir 
Iohn Darrell
 of 
Calehill, Dorothy
 wedded to Mr. 
Roger Lucan,
 and 
Mary
 espoused to 
Vincent Denne
 Esquire) became his Coheirs, and and this upon the division of his Estate, augmented the patrimony of Sir 
Nicholas Crispe.




Dandelion
 in the Parish of 
St. Johns,
 was the Seat of a Family in elder times called 
Dent de lyon,
 as appears by divers ancient Deeds, some without dare, some as high as 
Edward
 the first: but about the Government of 
Henry
 the fourth, the Name was mel∣ted down, and made more soft and easie, and transplanted into 
Dandelion,
 as appears by several Deeds of one 
John Dandelion,
 which commence from that Kings reign, and the reign of 
Henry
 the fifth, and he had Issue 
John Dandelion,
 who about the Begin∣ning of 
Edward
 the fourth, determined in a Daughter and Heir, matched to 
Petit
 of 
Shalmesford
 neer 
Chartham,
 and lies buryed under a fair Marble in 
St. Johns,
 with a plate of Brasse (if the Barbarity of these times, have not ravished it away) affixed to it, designing the time of his death, and by a Right fortified and made firme, from this Alliance, does this ancient Seat now acknowledge the Signory of Mr. 
Henry Petit.


Nash-court
 in the Parish abovesaid, was anciently the possession of the 
Garwintons,
 of whom I have spoken at 
Bekesbourn,
 where was their capital Mansion, and went a∣long with the Interest of this Family, untill 
William Garwinton
 the last of this Name dying without Issue, in the eleventh year of 
Henry
 the fourth, bequeathed this and much other Land to 
Richard Haut,
 who had married 
Joan
 his nearest Kinswoman and Heir general of the Family; and he left it to his Son 
Richard Haut,
 who left only one Daughter called 
Margery,
 who was his Heir, and she by marching with 
William Isaack
 made it parcel of his Inheritance; and in memory of this Alliance, the Windows of this Mansion, are in several Pannels of Glasse adorned with the Arms of 
Haut
 and 
Isaack,
 and near them are placed the Armes of 
William Warham
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 empaled with those of his Sea; for of him, and his Predecessors did this Mansion hold. After 
Isaack
 was gone out, which was about the latter end of 
Henry
 the eighth, the 
Lincolnes
 by purchase became Lords of the Fee, and held it untill the midst of the reign of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 and then it was passed away for some Courtesies obtained by the Heir of this Family, to Sir 
Roger Manwood
 Chief Baron of the Exchequer; and his Son Sir 
Peter Manwood
 alienated it in our Fathers Memory to 
Cleybrook,
 from whom it descended to his Son Mr. 
William Cleybrook,
 who upon his decease left it to his Widow Mrs. 
Sarah Cleybrooks
 remarried to Mr. 
George Somner
 slain at 
Wye-bridge,
 in the year 1648, and now lastly to Mr. 
James Newman,
 and after her decease the Re∣version to his Kinsman Mr. 
Alexander Northwood
 and his Heirs.


Dene
 and 
Hengrove
 are two Mannots circumscribed likewise within the precincts of 
St. Johns,
 and were involved in the spreading Demeasn of the powerful Family of 
Leybourn,
 as appears by a solemn Inquisition taken after the decease of 
William de Ley∣bourn,
 who dyed possest of them in the third year of 
Edward
 the second; and from whom they came to his Grandchild, 
Juliana
 Sole Heir of 
Roger de Leybourn,
 who ha∣ving no Issue, in the forty third year of 
Edward
 the third, either by 
John de Hastings,
 or 
William de Clinton
 Earl of 
Huntingdon,
 constiuted the Abby of St. 
Augustins,
 her heir to both these places (a more certain Inheritor then any loose Unthrift in the devout estimate of those Times) with this Clause annexed, that the Brotherhood of that Covent, should pray for the Souls of 
John de Hastings, Laurence de Hastings
 Earl of 
Pem∣broke, John de Hastings
 his Son, and lastly for that of 
William de Clinton
 Earl of 
Huntingdon;
 Which grant of hers was confirmed (as appears by 
Thorne
 the Chronicler of St. 
Augustins
 lately printed) by 
Edward
 the third, in the year 1363, and it is probable that those two Chappels, which the fabulous Tradition of the Island is, were erected at the two abovesaid places, by two Virgins, were built by the beforementioned 
Juliana,
 for two Chauntry Priests, to celebrate Masse for the Souls of her two deceased Husbands. But to proceed, upon the Suppression of the Abby of St. 
Augustins,
 by 
Henry
 the eighth, these two Mannors being united to the demeasn of the Crown, the Fee-simple was lodged in the Royal patrimony, untill King 
James
 in the Beginning of his reign, granted them to Mr. 
William Salter,
 who demised them to Mr. 
Manasser Norwood,
 whose Grandchild Mr. 
Alexander Norwood,
 for ought I know, is yet the proprietary of them.


Salmeston
 is the last place of account in 
St. Johns,
 and did belong, as appears by a 
Quo Warranto,
 cited at large in the late printed Chronicle of 
Thorne,
 to the Abby of St. 
Augustins,
 in the year 1362, and remained treasured up in the Demeasn of that Co∣vent, untill its final Suppression in the reign of 
Henry
 the eighth, and then being rent

away from the Church, it was by a new settlement enstated again upon the Church, being granted by the abovesaid Prince, in the twenty ninth of his Rule, unto 
Thomas
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury,
 and is at present held in Lease for Life, by the Lady 
Mary St. Leger,
 Widow of Sir 
Warham St. Leger,
 who had it in Exchange when he passed away the Mannors of 
Bersted
 and 
Leeds
 Castle, to Sir 
Thomas Colepeper
 of 
Hollingbourne.


Fleet
 is a place of Account which is situated partly in the Parish of St. 
Johns,
 and partly in St. 
Peters,
 and was the Inheritance, in Ages of a very high Extraction, of a Family who were written in Latine-Records 
de Fleta,
 and were planted here, as ap∣pears by their datelesse Deeds, about the reign either of King 
John,
 or 
Henry
 the third. And when in times of a more modern Inscription, they began to seal with Coats of Armes, appendant to private Muniments and Evidences; I find the parer∣nal Coat of this Family, to have been 
Checqueè ....... upon a Canton a Lion Rampant
 ....... which still lies registred in all old Ordinaries and Alphabets of Arms, and other ancient Rolls and Records of the 
Kentish
 Gentry: but as all Families have their Ebbings and Vicissitudes, so had this. For in our Fathers Memory, one of this Fami∣ly expired in a Daughter and Heir, who was matched to 
Philipott;
 and in our Memory another of this Name concluded in two Females, married to 
Smith
 and 
Pomflet,
 and so the ancient patrimony of 
Fleet,
 being thus crumbled into parcels, is now divided be∣tween these three Families.


Dane-court
 is another Seat of good Antiquity, and is placed likewise in Sr. 
Peters;
 It afforded both Seat and Sirname to a Family called 
Dane,
 who bore for their Coat Armour 
Gules four Flower de Lis, Or.
 But the Custome of Gavelkind having split this Family into two branches, and consequently rent the estate into two parcels, one of these branches withered away, before the end of 
Henry
 the fourth, and went out in a Daughter and Heir called 
Margaret
 married to 
John Exeter,
 and she by paternal right held some Lands here at 
Dane-court,
 at her decease, which was in the fourth year of 
Henry
 the sixth. But the other branch of this Family flourished something longer; for about the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth, 
John Dane
 the last of this Family at this place, determined in a sole Daughter and Heir, who was matched to 
Denne
 of 
Den-hill,
 who had in her right 
Dane-court:
 but possest not long his new Acquists, for about the latter end of 
Edward
 the fourth, I find it the 
Norwoods;
 from whom in the Chanel of successive Interest the Title flowed down to Mr. 
Alexander Northwood,
 who hath lately alienated all his Concernment in it to Mr...... 
Smith.


Ellington
 is an ancient Seat in the Parish of St. 
Lawrence,
 which was the Residence many Ages since, of a Family called 
Ellington,
 some of which lay buried under very ancient Gravestones, in this Church of St. 
Lawrence,
 with Inscriptions too upon them, as Mr. 
Sprackling
 not long since deceased informed me: but the Injuries of time and barbarous Hands, have now so violated those Remembrances, that even the memory of this Family, were it not for private Evidences which still preserve Life in it, would have found a Tomb in Oblivion, as well as their Ashes: But to proceed: After this Family had been fixed here for many Descents, about the latter end of 
Edward
 the fourth, it vanished away from this place, being succeeded in the possession by 
Thatcher,
 a Family of an high Antiquity, as to the Name, both here in 
Thanett,
 and at 
Canter∣bury.
 For in the Crown-Office, I discover, as the Record is cited by Mr. 
Somner
 in his Survey of that City, 
Pag.
 77. that a dysastrous Accident brought an untimely Fate to one of this Name; for 
Simon
 the Son of 
Adam de Colynham,
 and 
Henry
 the Son of 
Henry Thetcher,
 in the seventeenth year of K. 
Edward,
 Son of 
Edward
 the King that is (
Edward
 the second, Son of 
Edward
 the first) were sitting in a place beneath the Ground, at 
Monks∣dane
 neer 
Canterbury,
 and were preparing of Lime-stones, 
quos per infortunium Terra supercidit, it a quòd corpora eorum conquassabantur, unde moriebantur incontinenter,
 says the Latine-roll: That is, the earth sunk in upon them, and crushed them into the disor∣ders of an early Sepulcher. But to return: After this Seat had rested in this Name, untill the Beginning of Queen 
Elizabeth;
 it was passed away to 
Spracklin
 and remains part of the Demeasn of Mr. ..... 
Spracklin,
 Fellow of 
Peterhouse
 in 
Cambridge
 at this instant.


Manston
 is another ancient Seat in St. 
Laurence,
 which was the Inheritance of 
Manston
 for many Generations. 
Richard de Manston,
 as I find by the Bundles of in∣certain

years, kept in the Pipe-Office, was one of the 
Recognitoros magnae Assisae
 in the Time of King 
John:
 from whence we may conjecture, that even in those times of so high an Ascent, this Family was under no narrow or contemptible Character or Re∣pute. In latter times, that is, in the fourteenth year of 
Henry
 the sixth, I find 
William Manston
 was Sheriff of 
Kent,
 and held his Shrievalty at this place: and he had Issue 
Nicholas Manston,
 who matched with 
Eleanor,
 only Daughter of 
Edmund Haut
 Esq; and had Issue 
Julian
 his Sole Heir, who was matched to 
Thomas St. Nicholas
 of 
Thorn
 in the Parish of 
Minster
 in 
Thanett,
 which Seat accrued to his Grandfather, by the Heir of Sir 
John Goshall.
 This 
Thomas St. Nicholas,
 dyed in the year 1474, and by his last Will recorded in the Prerogative at 
Canterbury,
 he disposes his Body to be buryed before the Image of St. 
Nicholas,
 in the Chancel of 
Thorn
 at 
Minster,
 and 
Roger St. Nicholas
 was his Son and Heir, who determined in a Daughter and Heir called 
Eliza∣beth,
 matched to 
John Dynley
 of 
Worcestershire.
 Whose Successor about the latter end of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 conveyed his Right in 
Manston, Powcies,
 (which likewise was annexed to the revenue of 
St. Nicholas
 by the Heir of 
Goshall
) and 
Thorne
 in 
Minster,
 to Sir 
John Roper
 afterwards created Baron of 
Tenham,
 by King 
James,
 whose great Grandchild the Lord 
Christopher Roper,
 does still enjoy 
Manston
 and 
Thorne,
 but 
Powcies
 is lately passed away by Sale to 
Edward Monins
 of 
Waldershare
 Baronet.


Ʋpper-court
 is a third place in St. 
Laurence,
 which may exact our Notice, because it augmented the demeasn for many Generations, of the illustrious Family of 
Crioll,
 of whom I have spoken before in 
Sarre,
 and remained parcel of their Inheritance, until the latter end of 
Henry
 the sixth; and then it was passed away by Sir 
Thomas Crioll,
 to 
John White
 Esquire, and he dyed possest of it in the ninth year of 
Edward
 the fourth: but before the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, the possession of this place had deserted this Name, and was cast by Sale into the Revenue of 
Bere,
 and was constant to their Signory, untill almost the times which bordered upon our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was by Sale conveyed to 
Johnson,
 in which Family it is at this instant resident.


Nether-court
 is the last Seat in St. 
Laurence,
 which calls for our remembrance; It was in Times of an elder Inscription wrapt up in the Inheritance of the ancient and knightly Family of 
Goshall
 of 
Goshall
 in 
Ash,
 and continued in their possession untill the reign of 
Henry
 the fourth, and then this Family going out in a Daughter and Heir, she by espousing 
St. Nicholas,
 made it come to acknowledge the Signory of that Family, and was permanent in their Name, untill the latter end of 
Henry
 the seventh, and then a Vicissitude proportionate to the former, made it parcel of the Demeasn of 
John Dynley
 of the County of 
Worcester
 Esquire, who matched with 
Elizabeth,
 Sole Heir to 
Roger St. Nicholas,
 and remained united to their Interest untill the Beginning of the reign of Q. 
Eliz.
 and then the right this Family held in it, was by Sale transplanted into 
Maycott;
 from whom not long after the same Devolution brought it to 
Lucas,
 where after some small aboad, the Title discarded that Name, and came by purchase to own 
John Anthony
 for proprietary; and he in our Fathers Memory passed it away to Mr.... 
Johnson,
 in whose descendants the Jurisdiction and possession of this Mansion remains still concentered.


Minster
 is an eminent Mannor which anciently belonged to the Abby of St. 
Au∣gustins,
 being fenced in, and invested with several Franchises, and signal Immunities; and when King 
Canutus
 translated the Body of St. 
Mildred
 to 
Canterbury,
 and deposi∣ted it in a peculiar Shrine in the Chappel of St. 
Augustin's
 Abby, a Draught of which is represented to the Readers View, in Mr. 
Somners
 Survey of 
Canterbury;
 this Mannor with all those Appendages (which like so many Limbs, made up the Body of that demeasn, which supported the Cloister of St. 
Mildred,
 as namely the Mannors, of St. 
Johns
 and St. 
Peters,
 and St. 
Laurence
) was translated by that Prince likewise, and linked by his Confirmation, to the Abby of St. 
Augustins.
 But how both 
Minster
 and those other Mannors abovesaid, came originally to be the ecclesiastical patrimony, shall be now my task to discover.


Egbert
 or 
Egbright
 the third Christian King of 
Kent,
 after 
Ethelbert
 had by a tacit Consent or Connivance, permitted one 
Thunner,
 to paddle in the Blood of his two Kinsmen; or, as 
William
 of 
Malmesbury
 will have it, his Brothers called 
Ethelbert
 and 
Etheldred,
 persons of a pregnant (hope who like two early Stars, as soon as they began

to glitter and shine, fell suddenly into Umbrage, and were hid and eclipsed, with their own Ruines;) he to assoil his hands from those stains, this murder might seem to have bespattered them with, and to make some Recompence or Expiation for so barbarous and clandestine an Assassination, made an 
Herodian
-oath, that he would give 
Domneva,
 Mother of these slaughtered Innocents, whatsoever she would demand of him; and she, biassed and warped by the Advice of the Monkish Counsellors of those times asked of him as much Ground to endow an Abby with, as a tame Deer, which she had nourished, could Run over at a Breath: to which the King had immediately con∣sented had not one 
Timor
 opposed this design, saying, It was too great a Boon for her to ask, or for him to grant, upon which the earth opened, (says 
Thorne
 the fabulous Chronicler of St. 
Augustins
) and swallowed him up, and became both his Grave and Executioner: and the place where he sunk in, was (as the abovesaid Author asserts) untill the reign of 
Richard
 the second, which was the time he lived in, called 
Timors-leap Well.
 The King amazed with this stupendious Accident, assented to her Demand, and the Deer being let loose ran forty eight Ploughlands over, before it de∣sisted.


And thus 
Domneva,
 by the Aid and Concurrence of the King, erected within the precincts of 
Minster,
 a Monastery for veiled Nuns, over which she constituted 
Mil∣dred
 the first Abbesse, who was Daughter to 
Wolfchere
 King of 
Mercia:
 and she ga∣thered to her Assistance an Assembly of seventy Virgins, who being defirous to re∣nounce the World, were here vailed for Nuns, by 
Theodorus
 then Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury.
 And it seems this 
Mildred
 was a Virgin of that austere, regular, and in∣culpable Life, in the Vogue and verdict of those cloudy times, that her name is re∣gistred in the Calender of 
English
 Saints, and had that Title attributed to her, both whilst her Body lay at 
Minster,
 and after its translation to St. 
Austins.
 He that will survey the Bed-roll of her Miracles recorded at large (one of which was, that when the 
Danes
 in the reign of King 
Etheldred,
 harrassed this Island, and put this Cloister at 
Minster
 into a heap of flame and ruines, her Body remained entire, amidst the Embraces and Scorchings of that devouring and ravenous Element) let him read 
Thorne
 lately printed, and the Book called 
Nova Legenda Angliae;
 and when he hath done, he will find that wise-men will laugh, not in Applause, but in Contempt of such religious Romances. But I return to 
Minster,
 which, as I said before, being transplanted into the patrimony of St. 
Augustins
 by 
Canutus Hugh,
 the Abbot of that Cloister, to rescue this Town from that decay which menaced it, upon the removal of the Body of St. 
Mildred;
 in the year 1116, obtained from 
Henry
 the first, a Char∣ter to hold a Market weekly at his Mannor of 
Minster,
 which by disuse and intermission, shrunk into neglect and oblivion: But the greatest blow which was given to it, was the final suppression of the abovesaid Abby; and then it was rent from that Covent, and came to own the Signory of the Crown, and was lodged in its revenue, untill the ninth year of King 
James,
 and then it was with the appendant Mannors of St. 
Johns,
 St. 
Peters,
 and St. 
Laurence,
 granted to Sir 
Philip Cary,
 and 
John Williams
 Esquire, whose Sons and Heirs Sir 
John Williams,
 and 
John Cary
 Esquire, do now divide the Inhetitance of it.


Sheriffs-court
 in this Parish (but more anciently styled in old Records 
Sheriffs-hope
) was the possession of 
Reginald de Cornhill,
 who had the Custody of this County so long, that it was almost hereditary to him; so that he lost his own Name, and assu∣med that of 
le Sheriff;
 from whence this place borrowed the Appellation of 
Sheriffs∣hope:
 but this could not so fence-in the title or chain the possession to this Family, but that about the Beginning 
E.
 the third, it came to confesse the 
Corbies
 for proprietaries; and 
Robert de Corbie
 held it at his death, which was in the thirty ninth of 
Edward
 the third, 
Rot. Esc. Num
 9. and had Issue 
Robert Corbie,
 in whom the Male-line was wound up, so that 
Joan
 his Daughter and Heir, by matching with Sir 
Nicholas Wotton,
 twice Lord Maior of 
London,
 annexed it to the demeasn of that Family, and from him did the title by an unintercepted Current of Descent, glide down to 
Thomas
 Lord 
Wotton,
 who setled it in marriage upon his eldest Daughter 
Katharine Wotton
 wedded to the Lord 
Henry Stanhop;
 and she, not many years since, conveyed it by Sale to Mr. 
Hen. Paramour,
 lately deceased, Brother to Mr. 
Thomas Paramour
 now Lord of the Fee.




Monkton
 is a Mannor, that almost from the first Infancy of Christianity in this Island, was wrapped up in that demeasn, which was under the Signory of the Monks of 
Christ-church
 in 
Canterbury,
 and, as the Book of 
Christ-church
 informs me, was given to that Church by 
Ediva
 or 
Edgiva
 mother of 
Edmund,
 and 
Eadred
 or 
Edred,
 both Kings, in the year 961. And if you will see how it was rated in the Conquerours time, the Pages of 
Dooms-day
 Book will inform you. 
Monkton
 (says that Register) 
est Manerium Monachorum sanctae Trinitatis
 (that is 
Christ-church,
) 
& est de Cibo eorum, & in tempore Edwardi Regis, se defendebat pro
 XX 
sulling is, & nunc se defendebat pro
 X 
&
 VIII, 
& est appretiatum
 XL 
lb.
 This upon the surrender of the patrimony of 
Christ-church
 by the Monks of that Cloister, into the hands of 
Henry
 the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his reign, was by him not long after, enstated on his new erected Dean and Chapi∣ter of 
Christchurch,
 and continued untill these Times, annexed to their Reve∣nue.


Monkton
 had Liberty to keep a Market weekly, which was obtained by Grant from 
Henry
 the sixth, in the seventeenth year of his Rule, by 
John Salisbury
 then Prior of 
Christ-church.


Stonar
 is the last place to be taken Notice of in this Island, and although it be a Parish now without Inhabitants, and a member of the Cinque-ports belonging to 
Sandwich,
 and hath not enough left of its former Buildings, to direct you to its ori∣ginal Situation; yet was it formerly a Haven-Town, and had a Fair held there yearly five Days together, before the Feast of the Translation of St. 
Austin
 which was gran∣ted to this place in the year 1104. In the reign of 
William Rufus,
 about the year 1090, there arose a Suit in Law, between the Londoners, and the Abbot of St. 
Augustins,
 (to whom this Mannor was given, with the residue of that revenue, which belonged to the Nunnery at 
Minster
 by King 
Canutus,
 upon the translation of the Body of St. 
Mildred
 to that Cloister) as touching the right of the Haven of 
Stonar,
 wherein by the favourable Aid of the Prince, the Citizens (as 
Spot
 Chronicler to that Abby re∣ports) had the overthrow. But the utter ruine and subversion of the Town, happened in the year 1385, about the ninth of 
Richard
 the second, at what time the 
French
 with 18 Sail of Gallies, designing to infest the Maritine parts of 
Kent,
 landed and layed this Town of 
Stonar
 in Ashes, which ever since hath found a Sepulcher in its own Rubbish. And accuses the bad Government of Sir 
Simon de Burley,
 the then Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, and Constable of 
Dover
-Castle as cheif Author thereof. For when his demands were utterly refused and denyed, and not suffered to have the inestimable Or∣naments and Riches of St. 
Thomas Beckets
 shrine, and the Jewels of St. 
Augustins
 re∣moved to 
Dover
-Castle, upon pretence of safe-keeping them there, then he grew slack and remisse in securing the Sea-Coast, and Isle of 
Thanett,
 so that when the Abbot of St. 
Augustins
 had raised a considerable Strength of his Tenants about 
Northburn,
 and, bending towards the Island, endeavoured to have passed over at 
Sandwich;
 Sir 
Simon de Burley
 would not permit him, so that he was constrained by a long and redious March all Night, to go about by 
Fordwich
 and 
Sturrey
 into the Island, and made such vigorous resistance, that the Enemies fled to their Gallies, without doing any farther prejudice to the Islanders. Then Sir 
Simon
 procures the King to send out his Mandate under the great Seal of 
England,
 requiring all that had Lands, or belonged to 
Sandwich,
 to be Commorant there, and to find competent Arms, according to the Quality of their Estates and Faculties, upon pain of Imprisonment, and Forfeiture of all they had to loose. And sends in the Kings Name to the Abbot to remove with his Forces from 
Thanet,
 to the Guard of 
Sandwich,
 as a place of more Importance: But the Abbot (saith 
Thorne
 that continued the Chronicle of 
Spot
) neither astonished with the power of the Enemy, nor seduced with the Inticements, or terrified with the Menaces of the Traytor 
Burley,
 remained in the Island to defend his own and his Tenants posses∣sions. After this, there is nothing observable at this place, untill the Suppression of the Abby of St. 
Austins,
 and the Resignation of its Revenue, into the hands of 
Henry
 the eighth, when this Mannor with the rest of their demeasn, having improved the patrimony of the Crown, it was in the fourth and fifth of 
Philip
 and 
Mary,
 granted to 
Nicholas Crispe
 Esquire, from whom it is now descended to Mr. 
Nicholas Crispe
 his Successor, the instant Lord of the Fee.




There was in elder times a Guard assigned for the security of the passage between 
Sand∣wich
 and 
Stonar;
 for I find that 
Ed.
 the second granted 
VVill. Turke
 for Life in the seventh year of his reign, the passage between 
Stonar
 and 
Sandwich,
 and the Perquisites and Emoluments emergent from it; which Grant, was in the eighteenth year of that Prince, renewed by Patent, and invested for Life, with all its adherences, in 
Ralph St. Laurence
 of the Isle of 
Thanet.
 And then again in the thirteenth year of 
Edward
 the third, I find that that Prince grants 
John Giboun, Marmario suo,
 those are the words in the Latine Record: but what they import in 
English,
 I confesse I am ignorant of the profits of the passage betwen 
Sandwich
 and 
Stonar,
 for the defence and protection of it.


I shall wind up this Discourse, with informing the Reader, that the cheifest Scenes both of War and Peace, have been laid in or neer this Island. 
Rutupis
 or 
Richborough
 on the opposite Shore, was an eminent Fortresse of the Romans, and the first presidiary Station that Antiquity represents them to have erected within 
Britain.
 When 
Hengist
 arrived with his 
Saxons,
 to support the harrassed and afflicted 
Britons,
 against the eruptions of the 
Picts,
 he first landed in this Island, and when his Forces were broken by 
Vortimer
 at the Battle of 
Alresford,
 he made 
Thanet
 his Retreat and Shelter; When 
Austin
 the Monk arrived here in 
England
 with the light of Truth, to dispel the mists of Paganisme and Infidelity, and disseminate the Christian Religion amongst the 
Saxons,
 he found his first Reception in this Island. How often the 
Danes
 made 
Thanet
 a Winter Station for their Navies, when they made their barbarous Impressions on the Maritime Coasts of this Nation, I think our Chronicles do sufficiently inform us. And lastly, when 
Lewis
 the 
Dolphin
 was called in by the mutinous 
English
 Barons, to assert their Quarrel with additional Supplies against King 
John,
 he laid the first Scene of that War in this Island, which he afterwards scattered on the Face of this unhappy Nation.

Thames
 and 
Medway.


Shamell,
 written in 
Saxon, Scamell,
 is dedu∣ced from

 a Stool, and it is possible there was much Fish and Flesh exposed here to Sale on such Seats.

Dooms-day
 Book,

Felborough
 gives name to an Hundred; but where the place is cannot I yet discover: near to 
Chilham
 it must be, and if I should shew you my conceipt of the place, you might haply descant as much on me, as I do on it. Yet in regard the Barrow or grave where 
J
l
us Laberius,
 Fieldmar∣shall to

Barrow
 is used for a grave or little hill where burials have been.

 King to

Lyminge,
 which 
Edmerus
 a Monk of

 in 
Canterbury
 calls 
Lovingborough
 and the Records of that Church.

 was forlet and forlorn, and
