¶ To the Right Honorable-Lord,
 the Lord Charles Haward, Baron of Effingham, Lord high Admirall of England, &c.


R
Ight Honorable, for so much as my selfe, with the whole progeny of our name, haue beene alwayes exceedingly bounde, Next to the Right Honorable our good Lord the Lord Burleigh, Lord high Treasurer of England, Vnto the late right Honorable Sir Fraunces Knolles the elder Knight, Treasurer of her highnesse most honourable household, deceased, in regard of their sinceare iustice, and charitable respect of most iniurious and wicked practises heretofore vehemently prosecuted a∣gainst vs, for no lesse then the liuing we all pos∣sessed. Both whome therefore (vnder your Lordships good fauour) I can not, but in all my best indeuours, during life remember, Not for∣getting as in duty I am bound, the Right Ho∣norable Sir William Knolles Knight, now Con∣troller of her Maiesties sayd most honorable household, and such other his right worship∣full

 and honorable minded off-spring, as still re∣maine our good fauorers. Amongst whom, the right Worship. M. Robert Knolles more then a yeare passed of his accustomed kindnes aduer∣tised me, that your L. I know not by what meanes, vnderstanding of my indeuors in these Mathematick Sciences, was pleased to take fur∣ther notice of me by my personall presence. For the which, as the time hath not bin fitting by reason of your L. most serious important & honorable imployments, aswell to the seas as o∣therwise this yeare 1596 well knowne to the whole world. So haue I bin willing to catch hold of the opportunity thereof so far: as in the meane time to hammer out (if selfliking deceiue me not) a rare piece of Mathematicke stuffe, to bring vnto your L. view, together with my self: tending both to the profit and pleasure of all worthy english Gent. that either addict them∣selues to contemplacion at home, or to Marine traueyles abroad. Which if it may receiue fauo∣rable allowance at your good L. hands, I shall thinke my selfe suffiiciētly defended against all ignorant or malignāt detractors, and be the ra∣ther hereafter encouraged to go forwards with like matters. Thus praying vnto God for the long preseruacion of your Honour, I cease.


Your Lordships most humble, Iohn Blagraue.








To the curteous Reader.


G
Entle Reader, the eares of my guilty conceit being continually troubled with such a noyse and clamor for my (Organum Vranicum,) and the second part of my Mathematicall Iewell, so long and largely promised, as the greedy Auditors are woont to make at a Stage-play: calling, Come away howe, with boyes thro∣wing vollyes of stones ratling at the gates of my otherwise buisied imployments, for staying so long: Maketh me heere in haste (God graunt to your liking) to come vp the Stage, with a little, but rare piece of Mathematicke Musickly pleasure, not impertinent to the matter to be acted: to stay your langui∣shing expectations, both woorth the acceptacion (which I dare boldly aduouch against the doggedst detractor that shall contradict) and sufficient to entertaine the time vntill Midsomer or Michelmas Terme at the farthest, when as (if God permit) the stately Comedy of Queene Vranya hir Pageants, shall abundantly offer themselues to your pleasant viewe, Sollace your selues I pray you heerewith the whiles, and be bold with me if in any thing you doubt. You shall haue me God willing once euery Terme in London ready to your wish, at a poore lodging within Maister Greenes Wharfe neere vnto Charing Crosse: and at Maister Ralfe Iacksons at the signe of the Swan in S. Paules Churchyard, or at Maister William Matts Stationer, at the signe of the Plough, ouer a∣gainst S Dunstons Church in Fleetestreete, who hath the Impression of this Booke, you shall euer know whether I be at any time in the Citty: With whome, I haue taken order to furnish with these In∣struments and their supplements any that shall want them.

Astrolabium Ʋranicum Generale.
 Heere followeth the booke of the vse of the 
Ʋranicall Astrolabe,
 Newly deuised by Iohn Blagraue of Reading, Gentleman.




Cap. 1. ¶ Of the partes of this new Astrolabe.


T
His 
Astrolabe
 hath three generall partes, that is to say, the 
Celestiall,
 the 
Zenitfer
 with his 
Cursor,
 and the 
Almicantifer
 with his 
Pointer.


I call that part the 
Celestiall
 heere, which in other Astrolabes is called the 
Mate
,
 of which I will largely speake in the next Chap.


The 
Zenitfer
 beeing but as a playne rule of one ynch bredth, mooueth vpon the 
Celestiall
 in stead of a 
Reete
 vsed in other Astrolabes: and hath a circular Lymbe thereto annexed neere vnto the Centre, which I call the 
Circulus horarius,
 or houre circle, with the 24. houres, and their partes thereon, as you see. Neither is it materiall of what quantity that houre circle or lymbe be of, so it be con∣centricke to the Astrolabe, and placed so, that it hide fewest Starres in his moouing. And for seruice of this circle, there is written at the vpper end of this Zenitfer 
Meridies,
 and at

 the lower end 
Media nox,
 and therefore the fiduciall line thereof from the Centre vpwards to 
Meridies,
 is generally called the 
Noone line,
 the other part from the Centre downe∣wardes vnto 
Media nox
 the 
North line.
 Then hath it 90 
Zenith lines
 standing in ascents one aboue another like Or∣gan pipes, in stead of the 90 generall 
Horizons
 before time vsed, issuing or growing out of the 90 
Zenith points:
 for the lowest points of these 90 lines neerest vnto the centre vnto which their numbers are set from 0 to 90, do represent the true 
Zenithes
 of all places. These 90. 
Zenith lines,
 are by certaine thwart curued lines parted euery one into 90 vn∣euen parts, of which some run out infinitely, and those partes I call the 
Altitude rootes,
 or the 
Almicantare rootes,
 and for breuities sake sometimes 
Rootes
 without any addition. These 
Rootes
 do helpe vs to generall 
Almicantares,
 or circles of Altitude for any Latitude by a rare deuise by me first found out. They are numbered on the outer side of the 
Zenitfer
 from their extreame points inwards towards their sayd 
Zenith points,
 ending at them with 90. Also to the Fiduciall line of this 
Zenitfer
 is anexed a scale, in which are planted the Ra∣diall degrees of the proiectement on both sides of the Scale, because they require double numbering for sundry purposes. And of those which bound on the Fiduciall line, those at the noone line are numbered from the Equinoctiall intersection both waies, 
vz.
 towards 
Meridies,
 as farre as the 
Zenithfer
 will giue leaue, which are about 36, and towards the Centre, ending there at 90. which 90 radiall degrees of the noone line towards the Centre do serue (with the other 36) to descry the declinations of the fixed Starres and Planets, but chiefely they serue for the 90 Zenithes which appertaine to the 90 generall Horizons, and for distinction sake I call them the 90 
Verticall points,
 and they exactly answere vnto the 90. lower ends of the 90 
Zenith lines,
 which before I called the 90 
Ze∣nith points,
 in so much that the fiduciall line of the 
Cursor
 in his moouing, cutteth the 
Zenith point,
 and the 
Verticall point


 of any latitude both at once. The other 
Radiall
 degrees in the 
North line,
 are numbred from the centre towards 
Media nox,
 ending at the Equinoctials intersexion therewith at 90, and do serue for the 90 intersections of the 90 generall 
Horizons
 therewith, and therefore I call them the 90 
Horizontall points.
 And of those radyall degrees which bound on the other side of the Scale, which indeede serue to the getting of the 12 houses generally, as is shewed in the 27 Cap. The Norther 90 towards 
Media nox
 are numbred inwards to∣wards the Centre, ending there at 90 contrary to the former. And the Souther of those radiall degrees are numbred from the Centre outwards towards 
Meridies
 two to one, as farre as they will go, (that is to say) euery 10 make but 5, and these do serue but in stead of rootes to the other, and there∣fore I call them the 
Domifieng rootes.
 Also there adioyneth vnto the Radiall scale of the North line betweene the centre and the Zenith lines a certaine scale of slope lines numbered in the middest, beginning but from 60 and ending at the centre with 90, which I call the 
Domifieng Scale,
 for that the two extreames of euery of those slope lines, do help to get 8 of the 12 houses in that latitude, whose number it sheweth, as in the 27 Cap. is manifested: and vnto the outer edge of this 
Domifieng scale,
 are also anexed part of the former ra∣diall degrees, all hauing relacion to them on the North line. Then hath this 
Zenitfer
 a certaine runner or 
Cursor,
 whose fiduciall line alwayes runneth exactly square to the fiduciall line of the 
Zenitfer.
 And at the common meeting of both those fiduciall lines, this 
Cursor
 hath iointed vnto him a kinde of Labell or loose scale, which I call the 
Almicantifer,
 who to supply the generall vse of the 
Almicantares,
 hath no manner of matter on him but another 
Cursor,
 which I call a 
Pointer.


But now for any man that desireth to haue this Astro∣labe more particularly commodious for one latitude, 
vz.
 for the countrey or place of his abode, then shall he haue a kinde

 of Reete or moouer made, carying a circle or limbe of houres of equall diametre to the 
Celestiall,
 and within it the 
Horizon
 circle of that place particularly described after 
Stophlerus,
 and graduated into his 360 prospectiue degrees, as in the fourth booke 4. Cap. of my Iewell is taught, toge∣ther with the arches distinguishing the 12 houses, as in 
Stoph. lib.
 1. 
propo.
 6. is taught, writing to each house his number and significations. And vnto the noone-line furni∣shed with the former radiall degrees, numbred from the 
Ho∣rizon
 circle, into twise 90. both ending at the 
Verticall
 point, you shall neede to annexe but only one of the 90 Zenith lines, 
vz.
 that which serueth to your latitude and his rootes, with the 
Cursor:
 Neither neede your 
Almicantifer
 haue his sliding pointer, but in stead thereof, the particuler degrees of altitude seruing to that latitude, which are compounded of his 90 Zenith rootes, and the 90 radiall degrees in the North line, as in the 19 Cap. is taught, all which shall better appeare by such Astrolabes as I meane to set abroade ready furnished.






Cap. 2. ¶ Of the Celestiall proiectment in this new Astrolabe, and how the longitudes and latitudes of the Starres are thereby had.


N
Eedlesse it is to stand vpon the Fa∣brication, or long particularizing of this Instrument or his partes, since they are but the 
Copernician
 representation of the constellations fixed, and the 90 generall 
Horizons
 moouing.


The Fixed part which in other Astrolabes is called the 
Mater,
 I call for breuities sake the 
Celestiall,
 For that in it I haue

 prospectiuely proiected the Globe Celestiall, that is to say, the Globe of the fixed Starres, with the 
Zodiack,
 and his North Pole (marked with 
D
) the Images of each constel∣lation, and the Starres appertaining, in such sort as in the Globe they are vsuall, with each fift circle of Longitude and Latitude of the Zodiacke, Euery sixe of those fiues of the Longitude including a signe in the heauens, being 12 in the whole, which 12 are distinguished with twisted lines some∣what bigger from the rest, and vnto them neere vnto the Limbe are written the names of the 12 Signes as they passe in order, 
Aries, Taurus, &c.
 together with their natures and quallities. Also, those three Signes of the watry triplicitie are filled vp with waues, and the three fiery with flames, and the three earthy with bigge prickes, and the three ayry left white. Then are there seuen seuerall magnitudes of Starres, each bigger and brighter then other, whose fashions are set downe with their numbers in the Signe ♊ before the brest of 
Orion,
 by which they are easily heerein descryed. The excentricke circle 
Orbs
 or Lymbe, lying wholy within it, is the Zodiacke deuided into his 12 Signes by the fore∣sayd 12 mayster circles of longitude, and euery Signe into his 30 prospectiue degrees. Also the degrees are made with, diuers distinguishments, for the 
Gradus masculini, feminini, lucidi, tenebrosi, vacui, fumosi, puteales, fortunam augentes, & debilitantes,
 all which are sufficiently to be descryed by the two 
Directoria Zodiaci
 there placed. Then is there a little within the Zodiacke a rowe of Carecters of the Planets pla∣ced at euery 10 circle of longitude, signifying the faces of the Planets, and likewise another rowe without the Zodiacke at the beginning of the termes of the Planets, euery face and terme continuing vnto the carect next him in 
sequens
 of the Zodiacke, all which will better appeare, if you ioyne vnto this booke 
Claudius Dariot
 his introduction to the iudge∣ment of the Starres, which by good hap is now newly im∣printed in english together with this, and a second part there∣with,

 which at the first impression was omitted. And speci∣ally you must note and remember well, that the very outer∣most circle of this Zodiacke, is the clipticke circle, within which is contayned the North-halfe or Hemispheere of all the Starres and Constellacions in the heauens, and without it so many of the South Starres and Constellacions, as the proiectment would admit. Then is there also lying within this Astrolabe a blacke concentricke circle, representing the 
Aequinoctiall
 circle, and proiector of this worke, but without any diuisions, because they are better supplyed by the limbe. Also there is a scale of the radiall degrees, where∣on this proiectement is made, placed at the master circle of longit. beginning the Signe ♋ numbred from the Equi∣noctiall both wayes, which Equinoctiall cutteth the sayde eclipticke circle in the pointes 
B
 and 
C
 beginning ♈ and ♎, and those points are called the two 
Aequinoctiall Inter∣sectiones
 which do mooue vppon the poles of the 
Zodiacke
 backwards, or 
in precedentia,
 of the Signes euery 67 yeares almost a degree equally: carying about with them all the foresayde circles of Longitude and Latitude, leauing the Starres stocke still in their places, By which meanes it commeth to passe, that although the fixed Starres haue no manner of motion at all, yet they seeme from time to time to haue gone as is sayd euery 67 yeares almost a degree for∣wards, as the auncient Astronomers thought: where as in very deede (as 
Copernicus
 sheweth) the 
Zodiacke
 and all his circles do slide so much backwards from them: And by reason this sliding backe of the 
Aequinoctiall
 points, is as I haue sayd performed on the poles 
D
 and his opposite of the clipticke, therefore it commeth to passe that the fixed Starres could thereby neuer change theyr Latitudes, but keepe the same Latitudes as euer they did. This sliding backe, is called 
Precessio Aequinoctiorum,
 of which wee will in∣treate more in the 30 Cap. And now will returne to this proiectement: In which it is very easye to imagine euery

 square into fiue equall partes, and so thereby to knowe the Longitude and Latitude of any Starre therein sufficient for any common vse. As for example, the great Starre in the left foote of 
Orion,
 placed in the Signe ♊, if you imagin the spaces betweene each fiue circles of Longitude and Lati∣tude deuided into fiue partes, then shall you conceaue that the middle pricke of this Starre is heere in longitude about 9 degrees 30 minut. of ♊, and in latitude South from the clipticke circle about some 31 degrees 30 min. and so for any of the rest.






Cap. 3. ¶ Of certaine abbreuiated termes or phrases of arte, appertayning to this new Astrolabe.


B
Ecause this Astrolabe is newly de∣uised and his tackling, much diffe∣ring from all other heeretofore both in fashion, vse, and names, I haue therefore heere thought good to pre∣mise certaine abbreuiated termes thereunto fitly appertaining, least otherwise such long iteracion of di∣uers circumstances as at euery time I mention them I should be driuen to vse, should make my writings yrkesome, and my booke ouer long. Which tedi∣ousnes to auoyde, I haue further not onely couched diuers precepts and propositions almost into euery Chapter, but al∣so incorporated the examples with them, yet in another let∣ter, to the end you may if you list first reade ouer euery Chap∣ter, leauing out the example euen as though it were not. And if you vnderstand it so, it is well, if not, then reade it, and practise the example withall.






Are all one in signification, but in this practise the one is taken in the noone line, the other in the Zenith line of the place, as in the 1. Cap. is noted.



The Verticall point,
 


The Zenith point,






The Horizontall point,
 is alwayes that radiall degree of the north line, reckned from the centre which is equall to the latitude, or poles eleuation, explaned both in the 1. & 10. Cap.


The Zenith line,
 explaned in the 1. and 10. Cap.


The North
 and 
South degrees,
 are the 90. radiall degrees on the noone and north lines, on each side of the 
Verticall point
 explaned in the 10. Cap.


The East
 and 
West Hemispheares
 are thus, in euery con∣stitucion of this Astrolabe, the Fiduciall line of the 
Zenitfer
 deuideth the 
Celestiall,
 in halfe of which, that halfe East∣wards of the noone line towards vi. of the clocke in the mor∣ning, I call the 
East Hemisphere,
 the other halfe I call the 
West Hemispheare.


To play the Almicantifer
 in the East or West 
Hemisphere
 is as much to say, as to keepe him moouing wholy on the East, or West side of the noone line accordingly.


To apply the pointer
 to any Starre or Carect, is to leade the 
Zenitfer,
 and the 
Almicantifer
 about, till you may cause the 
Apex
 of the pointer to touch the carect, or the middle prick of the Starre.




To labell the Hower
 to the Sunne or Starres, or them to the hower. explaned in the 13. Cap.


To prepare the Zenitfer
 to any altitude. explaned in the 13. Cap.


To prepare the Zenitfer
 to the 
Horizon,
 is explaned in the 17. Cap.


To prepare the Almicantifer to a particular latitude,
 expla∣ned in the 19. Cap.




Also when it is sayd, 
Place the Zenitfer, or Labell to any Planet, Starre, or point:
 it is meant, that you must place the siduciall lines thereunto, and that with relation to the centre.

 The complement of any degree is so much as it lacketh of 90. degrees.


Lastly, you shall vnderstand, that in writing of this whole worke, my meaning was that euery man should haue the fur∣niture of this Astrolabe (whether generall or particular) made of mettall, as commonly the furnitures of Globes are, For which, if any man shall repaire or send vnto me either by him selfe, or by Maister 
Matts
 the bookeseller, dwelling at the signe of the Plough ouer against 
S. Dunstons
 Church in Fleet∣streete, who shall easily at all times send any letter or notice weekely vnto me by our Carryers, I will take such order that he shall haue them as reasonably done as may be. And to the ende that euery man may see how it ought to be made in mettall, I haue caused a rude patterne of each furniture in mettall to remaine with the sayd Maister 
Matts.
 Notwith∣standing, for such as will not go to that little charge, I haue vpon better aduisement caused the 
Zenitfer
 and 
Cursor
 to be imprinted with the 
Astrolabe,
 to be set either on pastboord, or cuttlers scale to serue the turne: But in stead of the 
Almi∣cantifer
 and his 
pointer,
 then must they vse a thred and pearle, which shall do in a manner as well, for the pearle shall in all actions supply the steede of the 
pointer.
 And in steede of the ledge of brasse in the beginning of the next Cap. mentioned, he may haply cause a breadth of lantornes horne to be riuetted ouer the 
Zodiacke,
 vnder which to place the Carects of the Planets, made of paste-boord, quilles, or such like.






Cap. 4. ¶ How to place Carects of the Planets in this Astrolabe, to serue there the whole weeke after.


F
OR this purpose you shall take a paire of Com∣passe, and pitch his one foote in the line begin∣ning ♑ at 25 degrees from the-cliptickes pole, and extend the other in the same line vnto 7 de∣grees

 of latitude, and with that quantity describe a blinde circle, on wh ch blinde circle so made you shal place a narrow hoope of lattin brasse, riuetted on the 
Mater
 with 4 or 8 riuets at the most, with so many thin bouisters vnder euery riuer, that the hoope presse not hard on the 
Mater,
 to the end that you may thrust vnder it some 9 Carrects, 5 of them carying two 
Apices
 or pointers ioynted together, made all of thin mettall and very narrow, 
vz.
 7 for the 7 Planets, and 2 for the Moones 
cap,
 and 
Cau. draconis,
 there to sticke very fast till they be weekely remooued, and let one of the 
Apices
 of each Carect be lesse and sleighter then the other, which you shall better vnderstand by such as I haue, and shall cause to be ready made to your hand then by manifold words.


These things prouided for, then at the beginning of any weeke of any yeare proposed (
Admit for the beginning of the first Sunday in March, which shall be Anno Domini
 1598.) you shall then by my 
Organum Vranicum,

) and to those places accordingly sought in this Astrolabe, you shall set the petty 
Apices
 of each Carect. There shall they serue you for all that weeke to singuler ef∣fects, and presently you may note thus much, that if the petty 
Apex
 happen to be thus placed in 
sequens
 of the 
Zodiacke
 from the chiefe 
Apex,
 then be sure the Planet is direct, if in 
precedens, (as in
 ☿) then is he 
Retrograde,
 if iust one vppon another, then 
Stationary.
 And full easy will it be to imagin the spaces betweene the two 
Apices
 of each Planets carect, into seuen equall partes for the seuen dayes of the weeke included betweene them, as in the 2. Cap. you imagined the Squares into fiue partes, and so reddily to conceiue where each Planet is any of those seuen dayes, which in none of them can exceede twise 7 Degrees, (the Moone ex∣cepted) whose gate in common accoumpt is euery two houres one whole Degree, and euery foure and twenty houres twelue Degrees. Wherefore for her, eyther you must relye vppon your Almanacke, or haue foure single Carects at the least to be set two dayes in sunder apeece, that is to saye, the one to bee set at the Moones place

 for Sunday noone (for Astronomers alwayes begin their day at noone, because the Meridian is 
Horizon rectus
) the second to be set for Tewsday noone, the third for Thursday noone, and the fourth for Saterday noone, and so by adding or subducting of 12 degrees for a day, and two degrees for an houre, her place shall sufficiently well be had. Her motion is very swift, and her 
Prosthapheresis,
 or 
Aequacions,
 caused by her epicicles, may happily breede error of 7 or 8 degrees in one weeke, from that common accoumpt of two houres to a degree, otherwise two Carects might haue sufficed, but in two dayes her greatest gate being but 12 degrees either be∣fore or behinde one of the carects, can breede no error to be regarded, if you recken it from that carect vnto which she is neerest.






Cap. 5. ¶ How by this new Astrolabe to finde the true place of the Sunne perpetually.


I
N my 
Organum Vranicum
 shortly like to come foorth, you shall haue the Kalender of the yere, the Cicle of the Sunne, and all such necessary supplements. And therefore in this Astrolabe, which I do appoint to be alwayes anexed thereunto, and to be but the back side, or 
Dorsum Vranici,
 I haue framed no Kalender at all or Theoricke of the ☉ as commonly all other Astrolabes haue. Yet to serue the turne vntill the 
Vranicum
 come foorth, or for them that would content themselues without the other, as happily some will in regard of the charge of the other, which can not well be framed but of mettall, I haue in the 12 Signes of the Zodiackes 
Orbs
 placed the 12 letters of the 12 Moneths, 
vz. I
 for Ianuary, 
F
 for February, &c. at such degree and minute of the-clipticke as they doe make their entraunce the 
Radicall
 yeare of my sayd 
Vranicum,
 being the

 yeare after Christ 1600. by help of which you shall for euer it you will, finde the true place of the Sunne within 3 or 4 minutes, so you regard but three obseruaunces which I shall heere deliuer you. The first is, concerning the Leape yeare, and is remedied by rebating some quarter of a degree for euery yeare following the Leape yeare till it be Leape yeare againe. The second is, concerning the fiue odde dayes in the yeare aboue 360. and is remedied by rebating for euery day of the moneth, proposed but one minute. The third is, con∣cerning ages past or to come, the remedie whereof, I will shew in the end of this Cap. Now therefore for the time pre∣sent, 
vz.
 for some 20 yeares if neede be before or behinde the yeare 1600. it serueth fitly as it is vpon euery Leape yeare, (because his roote 1600 is a Leape yeare) without any obser∣uacion more then for the fiue odde dayes which is generall in euery yeare: and for any common yeare with very little trouble, as I shall shewe in this manner: Wherefore if you will know what degree and minute the Sunne is in vpon any day and yeare assigned. First, seeke by the 
Zodiacke
 for the letter of the Moneth in which your day is (
vz. For the let∣ter I seruing for Iune, which is placed at the
 20 
degree and somewhat more in
 ♊, 
and the number
 6 
ascribed thereto, signifieth
 6 
minutes more then the
 20 
degrees, the exact place of that letter I.
) And from that letter 
(vz. I)
 number for∣wards so many degrees of the Clipticke as your day (
the
 8 
of Iune
) proposed is within your moneth 
(Iune)
 proposed, rebating so many minutes, according to the second obser∣uaunce before mentioned (
vz. for your
 8 
dayes, recken
 8 
de∣grees in sequens of that
 20 
deg.
 6 
min. of
 ♊ 
lacking
 8 
min.
) and where that accoumpt falleth out (
which you shall finde vppon that reckning and rebating of
 8 
minutes, to be
 27 
de∣grees
 58 
minutes of
 ♊.) there shall be the true place of the ☉ if it be a Leape yeare (
as this yeare
 1596 
is
) and there (
vz. at the saide
 27 
degrees
 58 
minutes of
 ♊) you may place the Carect of the Sunne for that day, as in the last Chapter is

 taught. But if it shall be the first yeare after the Leape yeare, then shall you rebate a quarter of a degree, or 14 ⅓ min. (if you will be precise) if the second yeare, then rebate halfe a degree, if the third, rebate ¾ of a degree, and then euery Leape yeare it returneth to his owne place againe. And this for almost twenty yeares eyther before or behinde the 
Radi∣call
 yeare 1600 shall serue passing well and reddye within some foure or fiue minutes, but for any time after the yeare 1600 you shall neede but adde, and for any time before sub∣tract some halfe quarter of a Degree (or 8 ¾ minutes if you will be precise) for euery 20 yeares. (
As for Example for the place of the
 ☉ 
the
 8 
day of March in the yeare
 1700. 
be∣cause betweene the yeare
 1600 
and
 1700, 
there are fiue times
 20 
yeares, therefore I adde fiue diquarters of a degree (or to be precise fiue times
 8 ¾ 
minutes which maketh
 44 ¾ 
minutes) vnto the foresaid
 27 
degr.
 58 
min. in
 ♊, 
and it maketh
 28 
de∣grees,
 42 ¾ 
minutes, which is the true place of the
 ☉ 
on the
 8 
day of Iune, Anno.
 1700.) And because you shall worke the more certaine, I haue to euery of the 12 letters of the mo∣neths, set the number of the minutes of that degree where his right place should be, which place is also descryed by a little stroke or string cutting the true place of the same Degree, and leading thence to the letter, if it be not placed directly therewith.


Also you must not forget for ages past or to come, to adde or subtract the 
Aequacion
 of the 8 Speere, as in the 30 Cap. shall be shewed according to the words 
Adiectiue
 or 
Abla∣tiue
 there mentioned, for that will from time to time alter this true place of the Sunne, euen vnto 1 ⅙ Degrees, about 800 yeares to come, or passed. Although some others haue ouerslipped in their Theoricks of the ☉ both this, and the third obseruacion before. (
For example you shall by the
 30 
Cap. finde the
 8 
Speares Aequation
 12 ¼ 
minutes ablatiue for the yeare
 1700, 
and so will the true place then be but
 28 
de∣grees
 30 ½ 
minutes for the
 8 
of Iune.
)




After many words thus spent, the precept is briefely thus: Suppose euery degree of the-clipticke to be a day of the yeare, rebating for euery day a minute, and for euery of the three common yeares 14 ⅓ minutes, and thus farre it serueth for all times. But now i
 your time be after 1600, you must for the 
motus equalis compositus
 adde 8 ¾ degrees for euery 20 yeares, and for euery 20 yeare before 1650 adde 5 min. for the 8 spheeres equation: and contrariwise, if being before 1600 and after 1650 you must subduct as much. Note, that I haue been sithence enformed that our honourable Lords de∣parted the 3 of Iune, but let the 8 of Iune now stand for the example, nothing hurtfull.






Cap. 6. ¶ How to rectifye the true place of the Sunne to all places of the world.


M
Y good meaning determining this 
Astro∣labe
 as a fit recreacion or play-game for trauellers by Sea, to driue away the tedi∣ousnes of their iourneying, may soonest of all deceiue them in getting the true place of the ☉, whether by the 
Ephemeris,
 or by the last Cap. or by my 
Organum Vranicum,
 if they haue not a speciall regard to the changing of their 
Meridians
 as they trauayle: for which cause, I haue caused a new description of the terestriall Globe to be made after my fashion in one face, where others make them still in two faces: and both that terestriall and this celestiall, are principally meant by me to serue vnto my 
Vranicum,
 and to be placed in the inner sides of his case as necessary appendices, though of it∣selfe it bee an Instrument sufficient without these. Of this terestriall I doe at this time (although hauing ma∣nye extraordinary conceites to applye him for Nauigati∣on, and other necessities to write of) determine to deli∣uer but this Chapter, therein to let you vnderstande,

 that in the limbe circle about it which representeth the 
Ae∣quinoctiall
 circle at the Meridian cutting vpon 
London,
 I haue placed a rundle with a crosse, and at the opposite Meri∣dian the number of 12. signifying 12 houres, and betweene these on both sides are 11 other rundles for houres, so is that whole circle deuided into twise 12 houres, and numbred both wayes from the crosse rundle, signifying how many houres the Sunne or any Planet or Starre hath to go from our Meridian at 
London
 (when any of them come vnto it) before it can come to the Meridian of another place, or being in a∣nother place, how many houres it must go ere it come to ours. And in regard that the gate of the ☉ is euery 24 houres a de∣gree of the-clipticke, therefore you must adde or subtract from his place found either in the last Cap. or the 
Ephemeri∣des,
 or my 
Vranicum,
 according to the rate thereof, 
vz.
 for euery 12 houres, about 30 minutes of a degree, and for 6 houres 15 minutes, &c.


As for example, admit you being a trauayler should be the fift day of March 1598 in the 4. Cap. mentioned in the great City of 
Quinsay
 in the countrey of 
China,
 and there seeking for the true place of the Sunne at noone, had found it 25 de∣grees 3 minutes in ♓ as in the 4. Cap. it was. Now because the Meridian of 
Quinsay
 appeareth in this Terestriall by the said houre rundles almost 9 houres distant from the Meri∣dian of 
London
 or rather of 
Anwerp
 if you worke by 
Stadius Ephemerides,
 or the last Cap. and that towards the East: Therefore the ☉ commeth so much sooner to the meridian or noone at 
Quinsay,
 for which cause you must in this case re∣bate so much of the Sunnes diurnall gate of 60 minutes, as 9 houres commeth to, 
vz.
 22 minutes, so will the Sunne that day at noone in that countrye be but 24 degrees 41 min. in ♓, which in the 4 Cap. was found to be 25 degrees 3 minutes in ♓. And if your place had beene so much West∣wards, then should you haue added 22 minutes vnto 25 de∣grees 3 minutes in ♓. You may also performe the same

 reddily by the next Cap. applying the Labell vnto 30 minut. of the sextans, for so much is the semidiurnall gate of the Sunne commonly.






Cap. 7. ¶ How to rectifye the place of the ☽ or of any other Planet to any other Meridian.


T
Here is more neede to haue regard of this matter for the ☽, because her motion is very swift euen euery two houres about a degree, then in any other of the Planets: and for reddyer performance heereof, the 
Horarium Planetarium
 in the 29 Cap. mentioned, shall yeeld you speciall helpe, if you imagine the 10 houres of the Arch of the sextans to be 10 degrees, and cause the planetary Index to be numbred for this purpose into 12 houres from the Centre outwards.


Now when you will rectifie the true place of any Planet (
admit of the
 ☽) at noone any day proposed (
admit the
 5. 
day of March
 1598) to another Meridian 
(admit to the Meri∣dian of Quinsay.)
 First you shall get the semidiurnall gate of the Planet by taking the motion of the day proposed (
vz.
 2 
degr.
 40 
min. in
 ♋) out of the motion of the day following (
being the
 6 
day of March, and the Moones place or motion then
 15 
degr.
 1. 
min. in
 ♋) and take halfe the remaine (
vz.
 6 
degr.
 10 
min.
) which you shall seeke in the arche of the sextans (
as though they were
 6 
houres
 10 
min.
) and thereto set the Index, there let him stay. Then as in the last Cap. is taught, seeke the houre distaunce of the Meridian of the other place 
(vz. of Quinsay)
 from yours, 
vz.
 from that of 
Anwerpe
 (for 
Stadius
) but for my 
Vranicum
 from 
London, (admit the houre distaunce
 8 
houres and an halfe
) and that distaunce seeke in the Index planted as before by the numbers reckned from the Centre outwards vnto 12, and marke what paralell

 cutteth the Index there (
vz. at the sayd
 8 ½ 
houre thereof
) and follow it to the arche of the 
Sextans,
 which shall there shew you (4 
degrees
 30 
minutes
) the motion of the Planet answerable to that houre distaunce of their Meridians, which if it be Westwards from your Meridian, you shall adde to, if Eastwards 
(as heere it is)
 then subtract out of the place of the Planet found (
vz. out of
 2 
degrees
 40 
minutes of
 ♋) and so shall you haue (28 
degrees
 10 
minutes in
 ♊) the true recti∣fied place of the Planet to that Meridian proposed.


Note, that for ♄, ♃, ♂, ♀, ☿, and the ☉, whose semi∣durnall gates seldome exceede minutes, you may take 3 or 4 houres of the 
Sextans
 for one degree, and worke as before most exact.






Cap. 8. ¶ How to know the declinacion and right ascen∣cion of any Planet, fixed Starre, or point of the heauens, and their degree of Culminacion.


T
Here are in the 
Mater,
 or 
Celestiall
 of this 
Astrolabe,
 to auoide confusion, only two sorts of circles delineated, & those are the circles of the-clipticks longitude and latitude in the 2. Cap. mentioned, issuing from his Pole 
D
 to his opposite. And the very like vnto those ought to haue been delineated, issuing from the Poles of the world, limitting the right assentions and declinations of the Starres, in regard of the Equinoctiall, and are commonly called Meridians and Paralells, which because the nature of this proiectement doth cast the Meridians into streight lines issuing from the Poles, both lodged in the Centre vnto euery of the 360 degrees of the Equinoctiall, or rather of the limbe and the parallells into concentricke circles, they are therefore supplyed by playing about the radiall degrees

 of the noone-lines on the Centre, by the degrees of the limbe, and might as well be done by a thred & pearle applyed to the radyall degrees of the Scale planted at the beginning of ♋.


Further you shall vnderstand that countrey is sayd to haue a right 
Horizon,
 vnto which some one of the Meridians is 
Horizon,
 that is to say, where the 
Aequinoctiall
 passeth by the 
Zenith
 or point directly ouer head, called the 
Verticall point,
 and both the poles of the world euen with the 
Horizon,
 and neither of them eleuated, all other 
Horizons
 where either Pole is eleuated, are called oblique 
Horizons.


Now therefore when you are to get the right ascension of any Planet-Starre, or point of the heauens assigned, you are but to learne what Meridian and Paralell cutteth the same, and if you do but lay the noone-line thereon, it sheweth you in the limbe the right ascention, and in the scale of the Radiall degrees on the noone-line the declinacion. For ex∣ample, the Sunnes 
Apex
 placed at the 26 degree 3 minut. of ♓ by the 2 cap. lay the noone-line thereto, and it shall shewe you in the limbe 356 degrees 25 minutes his right as∣cencion, and among the radiall degrees of the noone-line 1 degr. 30 min. his declinacion, and that Southwards of the Equinoctiall. For the 5 day of March 1598 likewise apply the noone-line vnto the chiefe Carect of ♄ there placed at 2 degr. 27 min. in ♎, and in latitude 2 degr 44 min. North, and it shall shew you in the limbe 182 degrees his right as∣cencion, and among the radiall degrees, 1 degr. 10 min. his declinacion South from the equinoctiall the same 5 of March 1598. Againe, if for any Starre, as admit the great Starre of the first light in or neere the eye of the Bull, called 
Ocu∣lus tauri,
 the noone-line layd thereon, sheweth in the limbe 63 degrees 30 min. his right ascencion, and 16 degrees his declinacion North from the equinoctiall, though he be in lati∣tude South from the-clipticke, and it cutteth in the 
Zodiacke
 the 5 degree 35 min. of ♊ his degree of culminacion: for al∣wayes y
e
 degree of the-clipticke which coascendeth or cutteth

 any Meridian or right 
Horizon
 with any Starre, or other point of the heauens, is called the degree of his 
Culminacion,
 because the Meridian of any place is called 
Culmen Celi.






Cap. 9. ¶ How to finde the true Meridian in any countrey by helpe of this Astrolabe.


T
HE Meridian circle of any latitude, is that great circle of the Spheare which passeth by the 
Zenith
 or verticall point of that place, and a line drawne by his two intersections with the 
Horizon
 there, is called the Meri∣dian line. Also, that Starre which in this Astrolabe you see in the outermost tip of the tayle of 
Vrsa Minor,
 is commonly called the Pole starre, in Latin 
Stella polaris,
 or 
Cinosura,
 which in this age is some 3 ½ degree di∣stant from the true North point or pole of the world, although the ordinary sort take it to be the Pole it selfe, yet in euery age to come by reason of the foresaid sliding backe of the equi∣noctiall points, he shall draw neerer and neerer to the Pole vntill the yeare 2220 after Christ, and then shall he be but 30 minutes from the Pole, and his longitude shall be then 0 in ♋, from whence he will then begin to elongate againe from the Pole till he come to 0 in ♑ about the yeare 15120, at which time his distance from the Pole shall be 47 degrees 30 minutes. And whereas 
Petrus Nonius
 sayth, that in times past he hath been 12 degrees 24 minutes from the Pole, and is now 3 degrees 30 minutes, happily he meaneth from the creation of the world.


This Pole-Starre in our age is found to culminate with the 6 degr. 20 min. of ♈, and to be 88 degr. 24 min. declining North from the equinoctiall: on which 6 degr. 20 min. of ♈ if you lay the Noone-line, you shall first thereby see what

 Starres do continually culminate or come vnto the Meri∣dian with it, and you shall finde it to cut on the faire Starre of the third light, in the pummell of the chayer of 
Cassiopeia,
 and another of the same light the northermost of the girdle of 
Andromeda,
 and in the opposite part, 
vz.
 by the North line, you shall see the 60 degr. 20 min of ♎ to culminate almost with the innermost of the three in the tayle tayle of 
Vrsa ma∣ior
 called 
Alioth,
 and two of the Starres of ♍, But that of 
Cassiopeia,
 and that of 
Vrsa maior
 are best for this purpose. Hauing thus by your Astrolabe found out a Starre or two which haue the same degree of culminating any Meridian as the Pole-Starre hath, now shall you neede but in any starry night to hang vp some line, or erect some round pole or staffe perpendiculer to your 
Horizon,
 and then watch the going about of the Starres, vntill some one of those two Starres come with the sayd Pole-Starre very euen and di∣rectly with your perpendiculer, for then be sure that those two are both directly in the Meridian: Wherefore you shall then speedily plant another perpendiculer iust betweene your first and the sayd two Starres, and there let them remaine continually, for they shall serue you for many good purposes at any time after both day and night, in stead of a Meridian, I could set you downe many wayes more, but this is most pertinent to this Instrument, and is of all other the readyest, especially whē as by the 22 Cap. following you shall before∣hand know what houre these Starres will come to the Me∣ridian, that you neede not watch long for them.






Cap. 10. ¶ How to attaine the latitude or Poles eleuation in any Countrey vnknowne, and to choose out the Verti∣call point in the noone-line, the Horizontall point in the North line, with the Zenith line seruing thereunto.




T
He Latitude of any place, is the distaunce of his Verticall point from the 
Aequinoctiall,
 counted by the degrees of his Meridian circle on the South part, and is alwayes equall to the eleuacion of the Pole of the world aboue the 
Horizon
 counted in the same 
Meridian
 on the North part, either of which can neuer exceede 90 degrees: for which cause, there are in the 
Zenitfer
 90 Zenith lines described, to serue euery turne. And the reddiest and most sure way to get the latitude in any strange place, hauing by the last Cap. setled your Meridian, is to take the Meridian altitudes of some one North Starre that neuer commeth South of the Zenith there, both aboue and vnder the Pole, then take the greater Altitude out of the lesser, and of the remaine adde the one halfe to the lesser, so haue you the latitude or Poles Eleuauion sought, whose complement is the Equinoctials eleuacion aboue the South point of the 
Horizon.


For example, admit the first Starre of the tayle of 
Vrsa maior
 called 
Alioth,
 if you obserue his comming to the 
Me∣ridian
 aboue the Pole-Starre, and there finde his altitude to be 84 degrees high, and afterwards finding him againe in the 
Meridian
 vnder the Pole (which will be some 12 houres betweene) and there but 19 ⅓ degrees high, then take 19 ⅓ out of 84 there resteth 64 ⅔, halfe that being 32 ⅓ added to 19 ⅓ maketh 51 ⅔ our eleuacion heere at 
Reading,
 and so much is our Zenith, or Verticall point, all is one, distant from the Equinoctiall, and that 51 ⅔ taken out of 90, leaueth the complement 38 ⅓ the Equinoctials height aboue the Horizon in our Meridian.


Now, if you will choose out in the noone-line of the Zenit∣fer the 
Verticall point
 fitting thereunto, recken thereon from the Equinoctialls intersection, with the noone-line by the

 radiall degrees and numbers thereon set betweene the Centre and 
Meridies,
 your latitude found, for there shall be your 
Verticall point
 desired (
vz. for our Eleuacion heere at Reading, the Pole being
 51 ⅔ 
degrees high, I reckon that by the numbers in the noone-line, and there I conclude is our Verticall point, or of any Countrey hauing like la∣titude.
) Likewise reckon on the North line from the Centre towardes 
Media nox,
 your sayde latitude founde (
vz. the said
 51 
degrees
 40 
minutes,
) and there shall be the place or point of your Horizons intersection, with the North part of your Meridian (51 
degrees
 40 
minutes vnder the Pole
) which I call the Horizontall point. And betweene the Ver∣ticall and Horizontall points thus founde, you shall alwaies finde 90 Radiall degrees complete and no more, which 90 degrees are the true intersections or crossings of the 90 
Al∣micantares
 of that latitude with the North part of the Meri∣dian, which for breuities sake I will heereafter call the North degrees, and those 90 degrees of the noone-line from the Verticall point towards 
Meridies,
 I will call the South degrees, both which in a particular would be numbred from the two Horizontall points, vnto the Zenith or Verticall point, there ending at 90 accordingly.


Now for the Zenith line in the Zenitfer appertaining to your latitude found, it is easily chosen by the numbers ascri∣bed to the inner ends of those 90 Zenith lines, as in the 1 cap. is shewed, which 90 inner ends are y
e
 90 Zenith points, and do answere by the fiduciall line of the Cursor, vnto the 90 Ver∣ticall points of the noone-line, (
vz. the
 51 ⅔ 
Zenith line must be chosen for our latitude heere at Reading,
) euery of them carrying his 90 
Almicantare
 rootes distinguished by the cur∣ued lines, and numbred from their outermost end inwards to∣wards their Zenith points, as in the 1. Cap. is shewed.


Your Verticall point, Horizon
 po
, and your Zenith line appertaining thus found, you must in any wise marke them specially from the rest except your memory be good, the reddier to finde them in all your actions.








Cap. 11. ¶ How to take the Meridian Altitude of the Sunne, or any Planet or Starre, and thereby to get the latitude in any Countrey.


I
T is a matter very easy and common, either by a Quadrant with a line and plummet, or by the circle or this Astrolabe hanged per∣pendiculer, furnished with a rule and two sightes to take an altitude: for the Sunne, by suffering the Sunne-beames to pearce the sight-holes, and for Starres by applying the sightes to your eye, which altitude of the Sunne or any Starre being taken in the direct South or North by help of your Meridian set by the 9 cap. is called the Meridian altitude. But if you haue no Meridian set, place your Quadrant or Astrolabe to∣wards the South or North, and thereby obserue the seuerall altitudes of the Sunne or Starres as they rise higher and higher, and the highest shall be the Meridian altitude. Where note, that such Starres whose declinacions exceede the lati∣tudes complement, do come twise vnto the Meridian at 12 houres betweene, yet neuer come South of the Zenith, or Verticall point.


The Meridian altitude thus had (
As for example heere at Reading the
 2 
of October
 1596 
about
 3 
of the clocke in the morning, I obserued the comming of the Starre oculus Tauri to the Meridian, and there tooke his Meridian Altitude by a Quadrant
 54 ⅓ 
degrees
) take it out of 90 degrees (
vz.
 54 ⅓ 
out of
 90) so haue 
 (35 ⅔) the complement or verticall distance of the Planet or Starre (
oculus
 ♉) proposed, from the Zenith of your being. Now if this Meridian Altitude happen on the North from your Zenith, then must you place

 the North line of your Zenitfer on the centre of your Planet or Starre found out in this Astrolabe: but if it happen South of your Zenith, (
As heere this Meridian altitude of ocul.
 ♉ 
did from our Zenith at Reading
) then bring the noone-line there∣to. And from that touching of the Starres centre therewith, (
which you shall finde to touch at
 16 
degrees, as they are on the noone-line there numbered
) you shall recken inwards towards the centre of the Celestiall so many degrees as the sayd verticall distaunce amounteth vnto, (
vz. the saide
 35 ⅔ 
degrees
) and the end of that reckoning shall assuredly shewe you (51 ⅔) in the noone-line the Zenith point of your being, whose number ascribed (
vz. the saide
 51 ⅔) is your latitude desired, (
thereby I might conclude, that the latitude heere at Reading was
 51 ⅔ 
degrees
) whose Horizontall point and Zenith line you may easily finde out by the last Cap.






Cap. 12. ¶ How to know what day of the yeare it were if it were forgotten.


G
Et the Latitude by the 10 or 11 cap. (
admit our latitude
 51 ⅔ 
degrees
) and the meridian altitude of the ☉ by the last cap. (
admit
 25 
degrees
) recken the complement thereof (
vz.
 65 
degrees
) in the noone-line from the 
Verticall point
 towards 
Meridies,
 and looke what radiall degrees it falleth at (
you shall finde it at
 13 ½ 
degrees Southwards from the Equinoctialls intersection
) and apply that degree by moouing about the 
Zenitfer
 vnto the clipticke circle, according as you gesse the time of the yeare to be, 
vz.
 If you thinke it to be betweene Midsomer and Christmas, then apply the same 13 ⅓ 
degr.
) vnto the autum∣nall hemicicle, where ♋ ☊ ♍ ♎ ♏ & ♐ are, (
where it must needes touch vpon the
 24 
degree of
 ♒) if betweene Christ∣mas

 and Midsomer then vnto the vernall hemicircle of the others Signes (
where it must needes our the
 6 of ♏) and there shall most assu
edly be th
 tru
 
 the Sunne for that day. Which bring had: then you may easily by the 5. Cap. euersed as well finde the day answerable thereto, as there you found the Sunnes place answerable to the day 
vice versa.
 Prouided that the Sunnes place be rectified as in the 6. Cap. if neede be.






Cap. 13. ¶ How to know what it is a clocke at any time either night or day, by the S
nne, Planets, or Starres.


Y
Ou must alwayes intend that the Planets are weekely placed, as in the 3. Cap. is taught. Also obserue this rule generall, to keepe the noone-line of the 
Zenitfer
 still vp∣wards, by turning about your 
Astrolabe,
 imagining your face turned still to the South, except when you are specially to deale with the North line, then keepe him vpwards, and then imagine your face turned towards the North. Now when you de∣sire to knowe the houre of the day or night, you shall as in the last Cap. is mentioned, either by a Quadrant, or this Astro∣labe, take the Altitude of the Sunne at any time in the day or in the night of any Starre. (
For Example this yeare
 1596 
the
 2 
of October in the morning at my poore house at Swal∣lowfeyld by Reading, to see how the time passed, I tooke the altitude of the Sunne
 15 
degrees high, And the same euening I tooke the altitude of the great Starre Arcturus
 10 
degrees high towards the West
) Which had, then shall you prepare your 
Almicantifer
 vnto that altitude, thus: In the Zenith line chosen by the 7. Cap. for your place 
(vz. in the
 51 ⅔ 
Zenith line for vs heere about Reading)
 seeke out a∣mong his Almicantare rootes the number of that Altitude

 taken, (
vz. in the morning I sought
 15 
for the
 ☉, 
and at night
 10 
for Arcturus
) & there plant the Cursor, then reckon on the North line frō your 
Horizontall
 point found by the 7 inwards towards the centre the same altitude againe (
vz. frō the Hori∣zontall point of our latitude, being the
 51 ⅔ 
deg. of the North∣line counted from the center, I reckoned inwards for the
 ☉ 15 
degrees, and for Arcturus
 10 
degrees, the one fell out at
 36 ⅔ 
degrees from the center, the other at
 41 ⅔) and there∣to, set the pointer of the 
Almicantifer,
 which poynter and Cur∣sor so set, I call the 
Almicantifer
 prepared: Then leade about the 
Almicantifer,
 which must also leade after him the noone-line, vntill the pointer come to touch exactly either the 
Apex
 of the Sunnes Carect, or the very centre of the Starre by which soeuer you deale, and this I call the applying of the pointer to any Planet or Starre: There hold the Zenitfer fast, and slide downe the Cursor to the centre, applying there his Fiduciall line labell-wise to the Sunne, which shall shew you in the houre circle the houre desired, and this I call labelling of the Sunne to the houre circle: Yet vpon these condicions, that if you deale for the East Hemispheare, that is to say, if your altitude taken were on the East part of the Meridian, 
vz.
 betweene the North and South Eastwards (
as for the
 ☉ 
it was
) then in this leading about shall the 
Almi∣cantifer
 play leftwards of the noone-line towards 6 of clocke in the morning of the houre circle which I call the East He∣mispheare, and so to leade the noone-line after it leftwards, but if your altitude taken were on y
e
 West part 
(as for Arctu∣rus it was)
 then shall the 
Almicantifer
 play and keepe on the right side of the noone-line towards 6 of clocke at night, and leade him about rightwards after him (
According to which precept, the said
 2 
of October in the morning, I applied the Almicantifer his pointer prepared as is said vnto
 15 
deg. to the Apex of the
 ☉ (
placed as is said at
 20 ⅓ 
of
 ♎) 
in the East He∣mispheere, and there did I labell to the Sunne, which shewed me halfe an houre past
 8 
in the morning, the houre desired.

 Likewise at night I applied the pointer prepared, and planted for
 10 
degrees vnto Arcturus in the West Hemispheare, be∣cause Arcturus was in the West, and then againe I labelled to the
 ☉ 
which shewed me in the Houre circle halfe an houre past
 7 
of the clocke at night, the houre desired:
 For alwayes 
(Locus Solis ostendit horam.)
 And I dare boldly say, that ne∣uer was seene before this more facillitie to know the houre by the Starres, by any other Astrolabe, or Instrument whatsoeuer.






Cap. 14. ¶ Another more easy way to finde the houre by the Starres.


H
Auing your Meridian planted about your dwelling place, as in the 6 Cap. is taught, see into the element if any Starre you know well (as by the 25 Cap. you shall easily know hem all) be euen therewith either on the South or North part. And vpon that Starre sought in the Celestiall, place accordingly the North line or noone line (either of them now esteemed from the Zenith point) and there labell to the ☉, so shall the houre sought shew it selfe in the houre circle vnder the fiduciall line of the Labell or Almicantifer now vsed Labell-wise after the woonted manner, this needeth no example.


If you haue no Meridian perpendiculers set, you may at any time presently set them with two stickes by the Pole-Starre it selfe sufficient for this purpose. I my selfe alwayes kept a standing marke ready set in such sort, that some tree, chimney top, or gable end, should be directly South from the same. If no Starre be in the South or North, it is not hard to gesse the distaunce of the neerest you see, and place your noone or North line accordingly, especially by two Starres, on either side one, to marke what part of their distance your

 Meridian cutteth, and accordingly to place the noone or North line betweene them.






Cap. 15. ¶ Another easy way by the ☽.


T
Ake the houre which the shade of the ☽ giueth on any Sunne-dyall, seeke the same houre in the houre circle, and labell it to the Moones Carect planted by the 3. Cap. and then holding fast the 
Zenitfer,
 labell to the Sunnes Carect, which shall shew in the houre circle the houre desired.






Cap. 16. ¶ How to know the meridian Altitude of the Sunne, or any other Planet, Starre, or point of the heauens in any countrey, and what houre of the day or night any of them shall culminate, or come to the Meridian of that place.


T
HE Carects being planted by the 3 Cap. you shall but applye the noone-line to the Apex or Centre of the Planet, Starre, or point desired, and the degrees there∣on found betweene the Verticall point and it taken out of 90, leaueth the Meridian al∣titude desired, whether it be North or South, and there also if you labell to the Sunne, it shall shew you in the houre circle the time when that Planet, Starre, or point, commeth to the Meridian. (
For example, the noone-line brought to the Sunnes chiefe Apex, being planted by the
 3 
cap. at
 263 
min. in
 ♓, 
his place for the
 5 
of March
 1598. 
you shall finde him

 by the degrees of the noone-line
 53 
degrees distaunt from our Verticall point heere at Reading therein, vz. from the
 51 ⅔ 
degr. thereof, which
 53 
taken out of
 90, 
leaueth
 37 
the Meri∣dian altitude.
 In like manner for any Starre, 
Admit oculus tauri the noone-line applyed to his middle pricke, you shall finde it distaunt from our Verticall point
 35 ⅔ 
degr. that taken out of
 90, 
leaueth
 54 ⅓ 
his Meridian altitude,
 As if you make tryall by obseruacion, as in the 8 Cap. is taught, you shall finde it so. 
And if you there labell to the
 ☉, 
you shall finde it to cut in the houre-circle
 4 
of clocke in the after noone, and almost halfe an houre past, which is the time that oculus tauri shall come vnto the Meridian the sayd
 6 
of March
 1598. But when you worke for the Sunne as before, he onely is himselfe the pointer of houres, and therefore must needes be in the Meridian at Noone, or 12 of clocke. But if it be for any North Starre that neuer setteth, and that you would know his meridian altitude vnder the Pole, apply the North line thereto, and the degrees thereof betweene it and the 
Ho∣rizontall
 point is your desire, and there also labell to the Sunne, and it shall shew you the houre.






Cap. 17. ¶ How to know the houre of Sunne-rising and setting, and the length of the day and night, together with his oblique ascencion, and his dif∣ference of ascencion any day in the yeare.


Y
Our day and yeare proposed (
Admit the said
 8 
day of Iune this yeare
 1596 
in the
 3 
Cap. mentioned, when our most noble Lords lanched from Plimmouth towardes Spayne
) and the Sunnes 
Apex
 placed by the 3 cap. (
vnto
 27 
degrees
 58 
min. of
 ♊) Then shall you set the Cursor vnto the outer end of the Zenith

 line of your countrey, (
vz. vnto the
 0 
almicantare roote of the
 51 
Zenith line being for the latitude of Plymouth,
) and there fastening the Cursor apply the pointer vnto the 
Hori∣zontall
 point (
of Plimouth, being the
 51 
degree of the North line
) and this I call preparing of the Zenitfer to the Horizon. Now, first to begin for the Sunne-rising, being thus prepa∣red, you shall according to the precept in the 9 Cap. let the 
Almicantifer
 play on the East Hemicicle, and there apply his pointer to the Sunnes Apex (
at
 27 
degr.
 58 
min. in
 ♊) there hold fast 
 Zenitfer and Labell to the Sunne, so shall ap∣peare in 
 
oure circle (4 
of clock in the morning, and som∣what lesse
) the time of the Sunne-rising for your (8 
of Iune
 1596 
at Plimouth
) day and yeare proposed. And if there also you labell to the East point or 6 of clock in the morning of the houre circle, it shall shew you in the limbe of the Celestiall (56 
degr.
 20 
min.
) the oblique ascencion of the Sunne for that time and place he is in, which taken out of the right ascencion of his place (
of
 27 
degr.
 58 
min. of
 ♊, 
being
 87 ½ 
degr.
) had by the 8 Cap. there shall remaine (31 
deg.
 10 
min.
) the diffe∣rence of ascencion. In the very like manner worke for the Sunne-se
ting, by letting the 
Almicantifer
 to play on the West Hemicicle, and there apply the pointer againe to the Sunnes Apex (
vz. to the foresaid
 27 
degr.
 58 
min. of
 ♊) and there labell to the ☉, so shall you see in the houre circle 
(some
 10 
min. after
 8 
of clocke at night)
 the houre of Sunne-set: and the space of houres numbered betweene Sunne-rising and setting (
being
 16 
houres
 ⅓) is the length of the day, and those (16 ⅓ 
houres
) takē out of 24 houres, leaueth (7 ⅔ 
houres
) the length of the night. Also the houre of Sunne set (
vz
 8 ⅙ doubled any day, maketh (16 ⅓ 
houres
) the iust length of the day as before. And heere also if you labell to the West point of the houre circle, it shall shew you in the Celestialls limbe (118 
deg.
 30 
mi.
) the oblique descencion (
in the said
 51 
lati∣tude
) As for the difference of descencion, it is all one with the difference of ascencion.




This Chapter is most easily to be performed by the parti∣cular moouer in the 1 Cap. mentioned: For if you mooue it about leftwards (
vz.
 from West towards East, according to 
Copernicus Hipothesis,
 and contrary to all other Astrolabes) till the East part of the particular 
Horizon
 come to the Sunne, the Labell layd thereon, sheweth the houre of rising, and continuing that moouing till the Wester part of the 
Horizon
 come to the Sunne, the Labell there applyed, shew∣eth the Sunne setting: yea, and more then that, the Labell there at both places sheweth the amplitude of the Sunne ri∣sing and setting, by the prospectiue degrees of the 
Horizon.
 Note, that if you would be curious, you should at Sunne ri∣sing apply the Labell a quarter of a degree short, and for the Sunne setting a quarter of a degree further on in the-clip∣ticke, then the Sunnes Apex is planted in regard of the Sunnes diurnall motion, being euery 24 houres almost a de∣gree, for that the Apex is set but iust for noone, the reason whereof is shewed in the 6. Cap. Note also, that for the rising and setting of Starres, and the other Planets, they are to be done by the particular in all respects as for the Sunne, sa∣uing that you must remember 
semper locus solis ostendit horam:
 Also, the getting of the assencions and descencions haue all one working with the generall.






Cap. 18. ¶ To know the houre of rising or setting of any other Starre, Planet, or point in the Heauens, and their diurnall and nocturnall arches, and their oblique assencions and difference of assencion in any Countrey.


I
N all these cases where we intreate of the houre, it is intended that the Sunnes place is set by the 3. Cap. (
admit at
 26 
degr.
 3 
min. in Pisces, for the


 5 
day of March
 1598.) Now to knowe the time of rising or setting of any Planet, Starre, or point proposed 
(admit the great Starre Arcturus)
 for any time and place proposed, you shall prepare the Almicantifer to the Horizon proposed in all respects as in the last Cap. you did (
vz. the Cursor planted vnto the outermost end of the
 51 ⅔ 
Zenith line, and the poin∣ter vnto the
 51 ⅔ 
Horizontall point seruing with vs heere at Reading.
) And then for the time of rising, you must let the 
Almicantifer
 play on the East Hemicicle, and there apply the pointer to the centre of 
(Arcturus)
 the Starre or point propo∣sed, and there holding fast the 
Zenitfer,
 labell to the Sunne, so shall you finde cut in the houre circle (
about
 20 
min. past
 6 
of clocke in the afternoone
) the houre and time of his rising. And there also if you labell to the East point of the houre-circle, it sheweth in the limbe of the Celestiall (280 ⅓ 
de∣grees
) the oblique ascencion of the same Starre or point 
(Arcturus)
 in the (51 ⅔) latitude proposed, which taken out of the right ascencion (209 ⅓) had by the 8 Cap. leaueth (19 
degrees
) the difference. Note, that if happily you thinke your houre circle with the smallest to direct you to the ob∣lique ascencion exactly when you lay the Labell on the East or West points, know that he must cut the like part of the Degree where he lighteth as the noone-line or North-line do in the degrees where they are. Note also, that to knowe the oblique ascencion, is as much to say, as to know what d
gree of the 
Aequinoctiall
 doth rise with any Starre or Planet on any oblique 
Horizon.
 As for the houre of setting, let the 
Almicantifer
 prepared as before, play on the West He∣micicle, and aply the pointer there againe on the said Starre 
(Arcturus)
 or point proposed, where if you labell to the Sunne (
at
 26 
degrees
 3 
min. in
 ♓,) it shall shewe you in the houre-circle (20 
min. past
 10 
the next morning
) the time of his set∣ting: and the houres reckoned on the houre-circle betweene his time of rising and setting (
being
 16) is his diurnall arch, which taken out of 24, leaueth (8 
houres
) his nocturnall arch.








Cap. 19. ¶ How to set perticular degrees on the Almican∣tifer, for any perticular latitude.


I
 Do not stand making speciall Chapters of the vse of the perticular moouer in the 1 Cap. mentioned, because it consisteth but of the very same Horizon circle and 12 hou∣ses of one perticular latitude, which old 1 
Stophlerus,
 and our old english Laureat 
G. Chaucer,
 haue so largely and plainely written of: withall, being a thing most commonly in vse, and differing in no∣thing, but that they according to the auncient Astronomers, appointed the Starry Heauens to mooue rightwards from East towards West, vppon the earth or fixed Horizon of the place. And I according to 
Copernicus
 cause the earth or Horizon to moue leftwards from West towards East, vppon the Starry Firmament fixed: In so much, that if in this my Astrolabe you hold still that perticular moouer with one hand, and with your vnder hand turne about the Celestiall, then is it iumpe 
Stophler
 againe. In which motion (a pretty thing to note) one that standeth by shall hardly perceiue any other but that the Reete mooueth, although in deede you turne a∣bout the Mater, strongly confirming 
Copernicus
 Argument, who sayth, that the weakenesse of our senses do imagine the Heauens to mooue about euery 24 houres from East to West by a 
Primum mobile,
 where as in deede they haue been alwayes fixed, and it is the earth that whirleth about euery 24 houres from West to East, of his owne propper nature allotted vnto him, as most fit for the receptacle of all tran∣sitory things, being appointed in a place where nothing is to stay him from his continuall moouing: but of those things I haue more iust occasion to intreate of in my 
Organum V∣ranicum


 very shortly to come foorth. But now if the sayd particular moouer should also haue his perticular Almican∣tares like the Reete of my Iewell tediously cut out, they would much obscure this faire face of the Celestiall, very needlesse: because the perticular Zenith-line of the place, with his 90 rootes annexed to the noone-line for the Cursor to play vppon, and the perticular degrees by this Cap. pre∣pared on the Almicantifer, shall serue in all respects as well or rather better. And the manner of preparing them is in a manner already set downe in the 13 Cap. Yet is it more easily to be done by a perticular, whose radyall degrees on the North line, which before I haue tearmed North degrees, are or should be ready numbered from the Horizontall point, towards the Verticall point, ending there at 90 degrees, which in the generall can not be suffered. Wherefore kee∣ping the fiduciall line of the Almicantifer euen with the North line, then sliding the Cursor from roote to roote of the 90 rootes of your perticular Zenith line, set nickes in the Almicantifer at euery degree, from degree to degree of the 90 North degrees, numbered from the Horizontall point, towards the Verticall point, correspondent to each roote as they passe in order, till the whole 90 particular degrees be in manner as in the 13 Cap. is shewed by those nicks placed on the Almicantifer, and then distinguish them by tennes, and set numbers vnto them accordingly, so are they very ready for diuers speciall purposes in one latitude, and if neede were, a man may by the two edges on both faces set the like in for foure latitudes, and those will neere be suffi∣cient for any one region or prouince, or else he might haue it made with some chanell to receiue a slip of velome or paste-boorde, whereon with pen and inke speedily to pre∣pare it for any latitude.








Cap. 20. ¶ How to know the amplitude of the rising or setting of the Sunne or Starres.


T
HE true East and West points of any Ho∣rizon are the Intersections of the Equinoc∣tiall therewith: and that is the cause why in describing the generall Horizons, they make them all to meete at two points which are those, and for that cause it is manifest, that there can no Planet, Starre, or point of the heauens, rise or set directly in the true East or West points of any Horizon, but only such as are scituate for the time being in the 
Aeq
i∣noctiall
 circle. Wherefore those that are North from the Equinoctiall, must needes rise and set Northwards from the true East and West points, and those that are Southwards▪ rise and set Southwards, and that more or lesse, according to their distaunce, and the obliquitie of the Horizon proposed. And the degrees of the Horizon circle betweene the true East and West points, and their rising and setting, are called the amplitude of rising and setting, which in the perticular moo∣uer are immediately seene by the degrees of the Horizon circle, as in the 17 Cap is sayd: but by the generall it as∣keth a little paines in this manner. Get the oblique ascencion of the Sunne, Starre, or point proposed for the time and place▪ by the 17 or 18 Cap. 
(which for the Sunne was in the Horizon of Plymouth the day of the prosperous setting foorth of our saide noble Lords, founde in the
 17 
Cap.
 56 
degrees
 20 
minutes of the Celestialls limbe,)
 and thereto apply the noone-line, and there hold the Zenithfer fixed: where it you haue the Almicantif
r by the last Cap prepared for the first latitude, 
vz.
 vnto the Zenith line, neerest vnto the noone-line,

 whose Horizontall point is in the centre of the Astrolabe, and then running the Cursor downe by the rootes of the same first Zenith line, keeping the fiduciall line of the Almicantifer still on the Sunne, Starre, or point proposed, vntill the Cursor among the rootes, and the ☉ or Starre among the prepared degrees doe cut like number, for then is the complement thereof, the degrees of the amplitude sought. But if your Al∣micantifer be not prepared, th
n must you prepare him and his pointer as in the 13 Cap. is taught, first to one degree of altitude, then to another, making still proffers to the ☉ or Starre, till the pointer touch vppon it, (
which will fall out at
 41 
degrees of that first Zenith line and latitude
) and the de∣grees so found, taken out of 90, leaueth (49 
degrees
) the am∣plitude (
of the
 ☉) sought.






Cap. 21. ¶ To know what Starres do neuer rise or set in any latitude, and which do once a day touch the Zenith point, or the Horizontall point.


T
His matter is most easy, (your Verticall point and Horizontall point chosen by the 10 Cap.) to be done by the bare moouing a∣bout of the Zenitfer, for in that motion, such Starres 
(as the tayle of Vrsa maior, and the head of Perseus, and such like)
 as touch the Verticall point be sure (
in our
 51 ⅔ 
latit. heere at Reading
) do come once in 24 houres to the Zenith of that place: And such as do not reach vnto the (51 ⅔) Horizontall point, (
as all Vrsa maior but
 2 
Starres Vrsa minor, Cassiopeia, Cepheus &c
) do n
uer et▪ And such as touch vppon the Horizontall point, 
(as Caput Me
se lucida lyre, the ring of Andromedaes cheine &c.)
 do once in 24 houres touch vppon the Horizon of

 the (51 ⅔) latitude proposed, yet do not set vnder it. By the particular moouer, these things are most plainely percei∣ued, and reddily done by the moouing of the Horizon circle about.






Cap. 22. ¶ To know any day and houre what Starres or points in the Heauens are in or neere the Meridian, or do rise or set in any Latitude.


T
His matter is as easy as the last. Labell the Sunne (
admit placed at
 20 
degrees
 10 
min. in
 ♎ 
for the
 2. 
of October
 1596) to any houre in the houre circle (
admit to
 8 
of clock at night
) and so shall the noone-line of the Zenitfer shew 
(the two Starres, called Caude Capricorni, and Lucida Hidri, but a little past, &c.)
 such Starres as are the same instant in the South, and the 12 degree of 
Aquarius
 in the 
medium Celi
 vnder the noone-line. And there holding fast the Zenitfer, being prepared vn∣to the Horizon (51 ⅔ 
heere at Reading
) proposed, leade the Almicantifer about the East Hemispheare, and looke what Starres 
(as part of Perseus, one of the heads of
 ♊, 
the Bulles head, the sinne of the Whale, &c.)
 you shall finde the poin∣ter to touch vppon: the same assuredly, do euen that moment emerge and rise on the Horizon. That done, the Zenitfer still remayning and prepared to the Horison as before, leade the Almicantifer about the West Hemispheare, and you shall finde the pointer to touch vppon such Starres 
(vz. one in the arme pit, another in the bowe of
 ♐, 
&c.)
 as are euen then ready to set and go downe vnder the Horizon. This is also most easy by the Horizon circle of the particular, which being but set to the houre, the Starres rising appeare in the East Hemispheare, and those setting: in the West and those in the Meridian: vnder the noone-line.








Cap. 23. ¶ How to know the houre distance of any Planet, Starre, or point of the Heauens from the Meridian, any day and yeare pro∣posed, and in any latitude.


T
Hat is to say, how many houres any Planet, Starre, or point 
(admit oculus Tauri)
 not being in the South at any time assigned, (
admit at
 10 
of clocke at night the
 5 
of March
 1598.) will be before he come to the Meridian of any place (
admit our Meridian heere at Reading in the
 51 ⅔ 
latitude
) proposed, or if he be past, how many houres he is past: You shall labell the houre giuen in the houre-circle (
vz.
 10 
of clocke at night
) to the ☉ planted as in the 3 Cap. (
at
 26 
degr.
 3 
min. of
 ♓) there holde fast the Zenitfer, and labell to your Starre 
(oculus Tauri)
 or point proposed, so doth the labell shew in the houre-circle (
fiue houres
 ⅔ 
almost Westwards, and therefore past the Meridian
) the houre and part that the Starre or point is distant, which if it be on the East part, then is not that Starre or point come to the Meridian, if Westwards 
(as heere it was)
 then is he past the Meridian (5 ⅔ 
houres
) so many houres.






Cap. 24. ¶ How to know the height of the Sunne, or of any other Planet or Starre, for any houre of the day any yeare in any latitude.


SEeke your houre proposed (
admit
 10 
of clock in the mor∣ning the
 2 
of Octob.
 1596 
in our
 51 ⅔ 
lati.
) in the houre-circle, & labell it to y
e
 Suns carect (
at
 20 
d.
 10 
mi. in
 ♎)

 there hold the Zenitfer fast. Now if the particular degrees be planted on the Almicantifer, as in the 19 Cap. is taught, you shall, (keeping the fiduciall line of the Almicantifer on the Starre or Sonnes Apex,) neede but to slide the Cursor too and fro on the Zenith line of the (51 ⅔) latitude proposed, vn∣till the Cursor among the rootes of that (51 ⅔) Z
nith-line, and the Sunnes Apex or centre of the Starre (
admit of ocu∣lus
 ♉) among the particular degrees of the Almicantifer, do cut like number, (
which you shall finde for the
 ☉ 
to be at the
 25 
roote, and
 25 
particular degrees, and for oculus tauri at the
 3 ½ 
roote, and
 3 ½ 
particular degrees,
) for those shall be the de∣grees of the Sunne or Starres altitude sought. But if your Almicantifer haue not the particular degrees, then must you as in the 13 Cap. is taught, prepare it to some degree at a venture, and make a proffer to the Sunne or Starre, to see if the pointer will touch it: if it do not, prepare it againe and againe if neede be, further off, or neerer, as the cause requi∣reth, till it do hit, as in the 20 Cap. you did, which with a very little practise will be as easy as the particular. This and the 20 are the onely two hardest in the booke, and there∣fore spare not so little paines as they require.






Cap. 25. ¶ How you shall most easily learne to know all the Constellations and Starres in the element it selfe.


E
Ven as a lofe of dowe or paste, after it is new moulden round and copped, if you then put it into a presse, will become a flat cake: Euen such a cake made of the round Spheare or Globe pressed, is the Celestiall of our new Astrolabe, which I would haue you now for this purpose imagine to be a lofe or round Globe againe: and that euery of his circles

 had their due conuexities in such sort, that a little pretty fel∣lowe like 
Tom Thumbe
 might easily seate himselfe vnder them as vnder a Canapy in the very centre of the concauity, with this conceite, if at any houre of any night giuen (
admit at
 10 
of clocke at night the saide
 5 
of March
 1598) you hauing first placed that houre of the houre-circle vnto the Sunnes Carect placed by the 3 Cap. (
vnto
 26 
degr.
 3 
min. of
 ♓,) there fastning the Zenithfer: And then going abroade, by help of your Meridian set, as in the 9 Cap. do place your Astrolabe flat on some stoole, plaine leuell with the Horizon, with his noone-line directed towards the South, euen with the saide Meridian line, and the North line towardes the North. Then with a priuy skonce and candle, one while viewing your Astrolabe, another while hiding the light, and viewing the element, you shall soone perceiue all the Starres of any constellacion in the heauens which are then aboue your Horizon, in the like proportion one from another, and differing in their magnitudes, as in the Celestiall they are described: in so much, that your little pretty fellow sitting in the centre vnder this conceited canapy of Starres and ima∣ges, if it were transparent as glasse or crystall, should there plainely see the Starres in the element, each answering his match in this canapy, by the visuall lines from his eye, espe∣cially if the noone-line be eleuated according to the Equi∣noctialls height, or latitudes complement, because the pro∣iectment is polare.


But if this do not satisfye you sufficiently, then is best for you hauing placed your Zenitfer as before by the houre propo∣sed, to see by the 22 Cap. what Starres are vnder or neere the noone-line, and of which magnitude they are, (
you shall finde at
 10 
of clocke the
 5 
of March
 1598 
the great Starre of the first magnit. in the brest of the Lyon, called Cor Leo∣nis, directly vnder it, and the bright Starre of Hydra of the
 2 
magnitude not much past
) and by the 16 Cap. learne their meridian altitude (
which for Cor Leonis, you shall by the


 16 
Cap. finde
 52 
degrees, and for lucida hidri
 33 
degrees,
) which had, go foorth with an Astrolabe or Quadrant with his fightes set to that altitude directly towards the South, and you shall wellneere finde your Starres desired euen with your sight holes, and you be not too long about it. Also at any time you may lay the noone-line to any Starre 
(admit Arctu∣rus)
 you desire to know, and then labell to any houre of the night proposed, (
admit
 10 
of clocke
) then marke what de∣gree of the clipticke the labell there cutteth, (
you shall finde
 1 
degr.
 30 
min. in
 ♊) and seeke by the 5 Cap. what moneth and day thereof that the Sunne commeth to that degree, (
you shall finde on the
 12 
day of May anno
 1598) for on that day be sure to finde that Starre in the South at 10 of clock at night, where you may make triall of his Meridian altitude as before. And hauing thus or any other way attained the perfect knowledge of some fewe, you shall easily by them de∣scrye the rest by their scituation vnto them, and imagined distaunces to others, some being in streight lines from two other, some making a triangular, some a quadrangular forme of sundry shapes: And this shall suffice an ingenious conceit in a fewe nightes to learne to know most of the constellacions and their Starres, who shall the whiles finde the time spent in heauenly pleasure and delightes.






Cap. 26. ¶ Of the 4 Cardines, and the sundry rising and setting of the fixed Starres with the Planets.


T
HE Meridian and Horizon of euery place do alwayes crosse each other in halfe on the North and South points of the same Hori∣zon: which crossing, maketh of those two circles 4 semicircles, which are called the 4 
Cardines.
 Vnto either of which when any

 Planet commeth, especially if he be accompanyed or strongly aspected with some other forcible Planet, Starre, or constel∣lacion, he worketh speciall effects, whether it be in natiuities or other causes, especially at any such time, looke assuredly for some present alteracion of the weather in that Horizon, because there they do strongly affect and aspect the ascendent Horizon and Climat, either by coniunction, opposition, or quartile, which are the strongest: the other, as the △ and ✶, are counted of lesse force. And whosoeuer will take vpon him to iudge of Aspects or Eclipses, if he haue not an eye whether they aspect the Climat, or to iudge of the weather, and not specially regard the effects of the fixed Starres with the Planets, shall finde it to prooue but lost labour, and happily be counted a common lyar, as some of our vnskilfull Progno∣sticators are, and the rest little better thought of, because of their negligence or ignorance. But to come to my purpose a∣gaine, you shall vnderstand, that when any Starre riseth together with any Planet on the Horizon (if with the ☉, then is it called the 
Cosmicall rising
 and if setting at Sunne ri∣sing the 
Cosmicall setting,
 if rising the Sunne setting, the 
Acronicall rising,
 if setting with the ☉, the 
Acronicall set∣ting.
) The Cosmicall rising is easily knowne by applying the Almicantifer prepared to the Horizon vnto any Planet in the East Hemicicle: there hold fast the Zenitfer, and play a∣bout the Almicantifer, and looke what Starres the pointer toucheth on in the East Hemicicle, be sure those do rise at the same time Cosmically with that Planet, and those he toucheth on in the West Hemicicle, do then Cosmically set with the same Planet, then rising. Likewise, if you put ouer the Almicantifer so prepared, causing the Planet to lye in the East Hemicicle, applying the pointer there∣to, and there holding fast the Zenitfer, do leade the Almi∣cantifer about, then be sure that such Starres as the poin∣ter lighteth on in the East Hemicicle, shall rise acronically with that Planet setting, and those in the West Hemicicle,

 shall set acronically together with the Planet setting: and what time of the yeare any of these shall happen, is easily con∣ceiued by that hath been said in the last Cap. and elsewhere: For vnto the Starre proposed, if you apply the pointer prepa∣red to the Horizon, & there holding the Zenithfer, do remooue the Almicantifer till the pointer touch or cut the Clipticke either in the East or West Hemicicle. Then by the 
Ephe∣mer.
 or my 
Vranicum
 you may easily know when & what day any Planet shal come vnto those points of the-cliptick so cut, and the degree of the ☉ for that day also labelled, sheweth there in the houre-circle the houre of the day (the Zenitfer be∣ing neuer stirred all the while) when any such rising or set∣ting shall happen.


For example, this yeare 1596 some 5 or 6 dayes together before the end of September, after long sitting all day wri∣ting this present booke, I was in the euenings hindred of my recreating walks by sodaine rising of the winde with showres of raine, though the dayes were reasonable faire, I therefore sought this my new Astrolabe, and found the 
Pleiades
 or 7 Starres to rise in the euenings cosmically with 
Iupiter,
 being retrograde all the while, ♀ also being then retrograde, for re∣trogradacion causeth rayne, especially in ☿ without all fayle more or lesse as he shall be affected or aspected. Also the 2 of October 1596 I was sodeinly ouertaken riding from 
Rea∣ding
 to my poore house at 
Swallowfeild
 at euen, with a most stormy rayne that continued an houre or two after very ex∣treame, it made me looke my Astrolabe againe, where I found 
spica virguis
 the Sunne ♂ and ☿ had set all together acroni∣cally within one halfe houre or lesse that this storme began, and then an houre after that 
Iupiter
 was to rise as before cos∣mically with the 
Pleyades.
 Now I leaue it to our sufficient Prognosticators to iudge whether these might be efficient causes sufficient or no, and do commend this my Astrolabe vnto them as a most needfull thing for them, wishing them to haue a speciall regard of the rising, setting, and culminating

 of the fixed Starres. The common countreyman seeing any day inclined to moysture, can say, that it will surely rayne when the Sunne and the winde come together, neither will it indeede rayne till then for the most part, how likely so euer. And wherefore then should not we beleeue the learned, that affirme the rising of 
Orion, Arcturus, Corona, &c.
 to prouoke tempestious weather, the Kid and Goate windes, the 
Hiades, Pleiades
 and 
Succule
 rayne, and especially happening with any forcible Planet or strong aspect, the more violent. Were it not for consuming the time, I could recite examples of all these and diuers other that I haue vpon like occasions noted to my selfe, but dare presume no further, least I should be billed amongst the common liers, as others are happily cause∣lesse: for no doubt the Almighty hath the raigne in his hand, to alter all at his pleasure when they haue all done their best. Yet that which is most to be condemned in them is, that they agree seldome in one coniecture, which must needes bewray shamefull ignorance in some of them at the least.






Cap. 27. ¶ Of the 12 houses, and setting the Figure.


L
Earned men considering the Sunne not only at his comming vnto the 4 chiefe points of the-clip∣ticke, 
vz.
 the two Equinoctiall and the two Sol∣stitiall points, to cause the Spring, 
Autumne,
 Sommer and Winter, but also that in euery other of the 12 Signes he maketh some alteration of the yeare and seasons. Euen so, finding such speciall effects to happen by the com∣ming of the Planets vnto the 4 
Cardines,
 either with the fixed Starres or without, as in the last Cap. is touched, they did imagine that the Planets and Starres might haue also some forces and effects in other meane places betweene: and there∣fore tooke vpon them to adde 8 semicircles more vnto the 4

 
Cardines,
 crossing with them at the two meridian Horizontall points, making vp the number of 12, which they call the 12 houses. Those on the particular moouer are ready drawne, so that applying but the houre in y
e
 moouers limbe to y
e
 Sunne, your Figure is set immediately and most excellently by this Astrolabe, fully fraught with all his needfull tackling, 
his Lords, termes, faces, triplicities, aspects, Planets and Starres in their places, natures of the
 12 
houses, and of the
 12 
Signes, the gradus masculini, feminini, lucidi, tenebrofi, vacui, fumo∣si, &c.
 and what not? appertaining to the Iudiciary arte, as if you reade 
Alkabitius, Claud. Dariotus
 which is englished, 
Gwydo Bonatus,
 and others their introductions to that arte, comparing the 2 Cap. therewithall, you will easily conceiue.


But to finde these 12 houses in any countrey 
(admit heere at Reading)
 by the generall for any day and yeare proposed, (
admit at
 10 
of clocke the
 5 
day of March
 1598) you shall labell the houre proposed (
vz.
 10 
of the clocke
) sought in the houre circle vnto the Sunne, placed by the 4. Cap. (
at
 25 
de∣grees
 3. 
min. in
 ♓) there doth the noone-line shew you (22 
degr.
 30 
min. of
 ♒) the degree of the-clipticke, beginning the 10 house and the North line (22 
degr.
 30 
min. in
 ♌) the degree beginning the 4 house, where also (holding fast the Zenitfer) play the 
Almicantifer
 prepared to the (51 ⅔) Hori∣zon, on both sides of the noone-line, so shall the pointer cut the clipticke in the East Hemicicle at (28 
degr.
 30 
min. in
 ♊) his degree beginning the first house commonly called the ascen∣dent or 
Horoscope,
 and in the West Hemicicle at (28 
degr.
 30 
min. in
 ♐) the descendent or degree beginning the 7 house, so haue you the 4 
Cardines, Angles,
 or principall houses of any figure in a manner as ready, as by the particular moo∣uer, which (hauing as the common manner is, drawne your 
Scheame
 or Figure for the 12 houses) you shall plant there∣in accordingly.


But now for the other 8 houses, marke where the Hori∣zontall point (
vz. the
 51 ⅔ 
degr. of the North line
) toucheth

 on the Celestiall, and thereto set a marke, or rather the Apex of some loose carect prouided of purpose, 
(which will happen betweene the two neere feete of Vrsa maior)
 and there let him rest till anon. And now shall you choose out in the domifying scale annexed to the North line, which slope line serueth vnto your latitude (
vz. the
 51 ⅔ 
slope line
) as in the 1 Cap. is tou∣ched: vnto whose two extreames or ends, you must seuerally prepare the 
Zenitfer
 by the domifying rootes, or double radiall degrees numbered in the noone-line scale outwards with Ca∣pitall letters in stead of Figures, in all respects as in the 13 Cap. you did for the degrees of altitude: That is to say, setting the Cursor to the like number among the said domi∣fying rootes as the radiall degree, (which also for this purpose is numbered with Capitall letters annexed to the inner ende of the slope line (
vz. to the
 42 ⅙ 
radiall degr. of the North line reckned by the capitall numbers toward the centre
) sheweth: wherunto the pointer must be set, if you work for the 2, 8, 6, or 12 houses, or to the outer ende of the slope line furthest frō the centre (
vz. to the
 57 ⅔ 
radiall degr. numbered also by the capi∣tall letters on the outside of the Zenitfer
) if for the 3, 9, 5, or 11 houses. And first being prepared as is said to y
e
 outer end, thē to get the 6 & 12 houses, you shall apply the pointer in the West Hemic. to y
e
 Horizon point before left at y
e
 carect or Apex 
(be∣twene the two neere feete of vrsa maior as is said)
 & there hold fast the Zenitfer, and then playing about the Almicantifer, his pointer shall cut the clipticke on the West Hemicicle, at the (16 
de.
 30 
mi. in
 ♏) beginning of the 6 house, and in the East Hemicicle at the (16 
de.
 30 
mi. in
 ♉) degree for the 12 house, set those two into your figure, and then remouing the Zenitfer, aply again the pointer in the East Hemicicle, to y
e
 same Hori∣zon point at the Apex, & there the Almicantifer still prepared as before plaid about, his pointer shal cut in the cliptick on the West Hemicicle the (20 
de. of
 ♑) degree for the 8 house, & the (20 
deg. of
 ♋) degree Eastwards for the 2 house, then place those two also in the Figure, so haue you 8 of the 12 houses.

 Now for the other 4, you shall new prepare the Zenitfer to the inner ende of the slope line seruing the 5, 9, 3, and 11 houses, (
vz. by placing the Cursor at the
 57 ⅔ 
domifying roote in the noone-lines scale, and the pointer at the
 57 ⅔ 
radiall domi∣fying degree of the North line, answering the inner end of the
 51 ⅔ 
slope line
) and then apply his pointer in the West Hemicicle vnto the foresaid Horizon point left at the Apex, and there holding the Zenitfer fast, and playing about the Al∣micantifer: his pointer shall cut in the-clipticke on the West Hemicicle, the (5 
degree
 30 
min. of
 ♒) beginning of the 9 house, and in the East Hemicicle the (5 
degree
 30 
mi. of
 ♌) beginning the 3 house. That done, then remoue the Zenithter (30 
degrees further
) by


astrological diagram


Fig: Celi 5: Martij Hor: 10 1598


 applying the pointer a∣gaine to the sayd Hori∣zon point in the East Hemicicle, & there play∣ing the 
Almicant.
 it shal shew you on the East the (22 
degr. of
 ♍) for the 5 house, and on the West the (22 
degr. of
 ♓) de∣gree for the 11 house, now set them all into your scheame, and so is your Figure set.


Note, that if in playing about the 
Almicantifer
 you chance to meete with any notable fixed Starre any thing neere, it shall not do amisse to set him also in your figure. Also I am to note vnto you, that there are two things that fall out vn∣luckily in this practise, which you shall thus salue. The first is, that the breadth of the Zenitfer hideth from the pointer the Horizon point set at the Apex in the East Hemicicle. This is salued two wayes: the one is, when the Almicantifer is pre∣pared to set the Cursor at so many degrees of the North line.

 as he is at in the Noone line, and so will the East and West points of the houre-circle change their places for the time: The other way generall to all foure remooues of the Zenith∣fer. For so soone as you had gotten the 4 Cardines, if you had made in the Celestialls limbe on each side of the noone-line two markes, the one 30 the other 60 degrees distant from it, that shall serue as well and in stead of the foure times, applying of the pointer to the Horizon point before vsed, as if you trye both wayes you shall finde, and produce one truth.


And whereas for diuers latitudes, some of the domifying rootes do go out of the Zenitfer, those may easily be supplyed with help of a threed and pearle added to the pointer, or with helpe of a paire of compasses thus: First, cast away 45 out of your radiall number shewed by the slope line (
vz. out of the
 57 ⅔ 
casting
 45, 
there remaineth
 12 ⅔) and set y
e
 Cursor vnto twise so many of the domifying rootes of the noonelines scale as the remaine commeth vnto, (
vz. vnto the
 25 ⅔ 
domifying roote
) and there apply the pointer vnto the like number of the domifying radiall degrees of the North line (
vz. vnto
 25 ⅓ 
degr. reckoned on the North line from the equinoctials inter∣section towards the centre
) and then the Cursor remayning, do apply the fiduciall line of the Almicantifer euen with the fiduciall noone-line of y
e
 Zenitfer outwards, there doth y
e
 poin∣ters Apex shew y
e
 true place of y
e
 roote wanting, where if you pitch one foote of your compasse, or fasten a threed, and with the other or with the pearle extended to the domifying ra∣dyall degree of the slope line, (
vz. vnto the
 57 ⅔ 
radiall domi∣fying degree,
) offer to describe a circle, it shall cut the-clip∣ticke as before the pointer did at 22 degrees of ♓ and of ♍, so the noone-line stand at his due place as before, 
vz.
 at 30 or 60 degrees of the Celestialls limbe from the first consti∣tution.








Cap. 28. ¶ Of the aspects of the Planets, and how to finde them.


T
Here are in Astronomy three chiefe cardinall aspects (as I may tearme them) 
vz.
 the Con∣iunction marked thus ☌, and is, when as two Planets meete in one degree and minute of longitude. The Opposition marked thus ☍, when as they are iust sixe signes in sunder. The Quartile marked thus □, when as they are three signes distant. Also, there are two other of lesse force, 
vz.
 the Trine marked thus △, and is at foure signes distaunce. And the Sextile marked thus ✶, at two signes distaunce. Which aspects are easily descryed euen by the very view on this Astrolabe, when as the Planets are thereon planted by the 4 Cap. for who can not espye quickly when any Planet is coniunct, or 2, 3, 4, or 6 signes off from any other, or from any notable fixed Starre. And yet for your better vnderstanding, I haue from the beginning of ♑ drawne the radiall lines of each aspect, and set the Carecters on them: But now 
Alkabi∣tius Bonatus,
 and 
Dariottus
 will tell you, that the Tryne and Sextile are good, the □ and ☍ bad, the coniunction of good Planets good, of euill Planets bad, and that the coniunction and ☍ may be allowed so long as they are within one degree of another, and the △ □ and ✶ when they come one within daunger of anothers beames, which for ♄ or ♃ is at 9 degrees before and behinde for ♂ at 8 degrees, ♀ and ☿ at seuen, the ☽ at 12, the ☉ 15 degrees, and so farre off their application and separation begnneth and endeth, &c. Also 
Io. Stophlerus
 noteth in this place, 
propos.
 55. that though a Planet might haue 10 degr. of latitude, yet could it not make 30 min. diffe∣rence in the aspect, and that only in the ✶ or △ and not to be

 regarded. Also aspects are said to be dexter aspects, when the beames proiect in 
sequens
 of the-clipticke, and 
Sinister
 when in precedens.






Cap. 29. ¶ A new deuise of the Author to get the Planetary houres in all latitudes, and of their Lords regnant.


T
Hose houres which in these dayes we call Planetary houres, for that Astronomers haue held opinion the Planets to haue their seuerall dominions in euery of them, haue beene sometime called 
Horae inequales,
 and 
Horae temporariae.
 Their nature is to diuide euery naturall day betweene Sunne-rising and setting into 12 equall partes, and euery naturall night into other 12. But because in all oblique 
Horizons
 the dayes and nightes lengthen and shorten with the Sommer and Winter, there∣fore these houres growing great and lesse according to the time and latitude, are called 
Inequales
 and 
Temporariae,
 they are numbered in the day time from Sunne-rising, ending at Sunne-set with 12, and there the houres of the night begin∣ning, do end the next morrow at Sunne-rising with 12.


Th
se houres are most easily had by a speciall Instrument called 
Horarium Planetarium,
 which I my selfe haue newly deuised, generall to all 
Horizons,
 which was neuer done be∣fore me that I haue seene, and placed it at the top of the Cele∣stiall, comprehended in the Sextans of a circle, whose arche containeth the houres of Sunne-rising and setting, and with∣in, it is filled with a number of streight lines, all parallell to the base of the Sextans, representing the common, equall, and vsuall houres either of day or night, which are numbe∣red on the Sextans side downewards to 12, for the houres going before the sixt Planetary houre, and thense backe

 againe outwards for the houres after. And it must haue ri∣ding on his Centre a Labell or Scale of the Planetary houres of equall length to the side or base, deuided into sixe equall parts, numbered from the outer end inwards, ending at the Centre with 6, and thense backe againe, ending at 12 where it began. This Labell or Index is also numbered from the Centre outwards vnto 12 for the vse of the 7 Cap. Now when the common houre of any day or night is giuen, 
(admit
 10 
of clocke
 40 
minutes afternoone the
 12 
of De∣cember
 1583, 
being the houre of the natiuity of my neere kinseman Maister Walter Seint-Iohn, sonne and heyre to Sir Iohn Seint-Iohn Knight of Lyddiard in the County of Willshire deceased)
 and that you would know the Planetary houre, you shall by the 17 Cap. first get the houre and minute of y
e
 Sunne setting that day, if the houre giuen be of the day or of the Sunne rising, if the question 
(as that natiuity was)
 be of the night 
(vz. you shall finde it about
 8 ¼ 
of clocke in the morning)
 and vnto that houre (
vz.
 8 ¼) sought in the 
Sextans
 arche, set the fiduciall line of the Planetary Scale, where immediately you shall see the houre-line equall to your houre giuen 
(vz. the
 10 ⅔ 
houre-line reckoned in the Sextans side inwards for that midnight will be the
 6 
Plane∣tary houre)
 to cut off in the Planetary Scale the Planetary houre desired. 
(vz. it shall cut
 ⅔ 
partes of the
 9 
Planetary houre.)
 And if now you desire to knowe what Planet bea∣reth dominion that houre, resort vnto the domineering Table which I haue placed at the lower corner of the Celestiall, and therein seeke the day or night of the weeke proposed, accounting Sunday for the first, Munday the second, &c. wherein your houre was giuen, 
(vz. Thursday night being the
 5 
night I seeke the figure
 5 
by the title (Noctes)
 and fol∣low that range of Carects vntill you come vnder your Pla∣netary houre founde, (
vz. vnder the houre figure of
 9) and there shall you finde ♄ the Planet domineering that houre.


Note, that if you had no domineering Table, you might

 easily make it by hart, beginning the first houre on Sunday with the ☉, and then reckoning the Planets on your fingers ends thus, ☉, ♀, ☿, ☽, ♄, ♃, ♂. ☉, ♀, ☿, ☽, ♄, &c. till you haue done 24, so shall you finde the 25 in this accoumpt to be ☽, and thereof Munday is called 
dies Lune,
 and on Tewsday will fall out ♂ if you reckon on, and thereof called 
dies Mar∣tis,
 euen so Wensday, 
dies Mercurij,
 of ☿, Thursday 
dies Iouis,
 of ♃, Friday 
dies Veneris,
 of ♀, Saterday, 
dies Saturni,
 of ♄, and all by reason of this accoumpt of the 7 Planets.






Cap. 30. ¶ How you shall knowe to set forwards and back∣wards any of the fixed Starres vnto their true places for any age past, or to come.


I
 Haue in the 2 Cap. sufficiently shewed by what meanes the fixed Starres are in ap∣parance from age to age, forced out of one signe and degree into another, through the sliding backe of the Equinoctiall intersec∣tions with the-clipticke: preceeding orderly and equally almost euery 67 yeares a degree, which is called the 
Medius,
 or 
Aequalis motus precessionis seu fixarum.
 The gate whereof, how much it is in one day, in one yeare, in 4, in 20, in an 100, and in a 1000 yeares, is set downe in the first columne of the 
Tabula Radicalis,
 in the left corner of the Celestiall. Wherefore if you would knowe where the equall place of any Starre 
(admit of Arcturus)
 shall be any time to come, 
(admit for the yeare after Christ
 2000 
compleate)
 take 1650 (for that all the North Starres are in this Celestiall placed and rectifyed for that yeare) out of the yeare proposed, and by that first columne gather the equall motion aunswe∣rable to that remayne. 
(vz.
 1650 
taken out of
 2000 
leaueth


 350, 
for which
 350 
yeares, I take in the said columne the mo∣tion of one
 100 
yeares three times, and of
 20 
yeares twise, and of
 4 
yeares twise, and of one yeare twise, for that three times
 100, 
and twise
 20, 
and twise
 4, 
and twise one, do make
 350, 
and of that collection there amounteth
 4 
deg.
 53 
min. almost.)
 And so much can I say that those North Starres will then be gone forwards from their places, where now in the Cele∣stiall they are set in regard of their equall motion. But now there is found out by skilfull artes-men a certaine librament or ballaicing of the Equinoctiall and the Poles of the world, as the studyed in the Theoricks well knowe, which at one time helpeth forwards this equall motion, and at another time pulleth it backe againe, euen vnto 71 min. or 1 degr. 11 min. all is one, making by that meanes the true motion vne∣quall. Therefore I haue within the Radicall table placed an instrument of my deuise to equate the same, which consisteth (as the Radicall table doth) of two partes, the one for the ablatiue 
Aequations,
 the other for the 
Adiectiue,
 each part hauing two limbes ioyning together, the outermost carrying the sayd 71 minutes two wayes for the ballaicing too and fro: the innermost being double, in which are written the yeares from Christes birth for 3440 yeares after, numbered from the ✿ twise about, for that in so many yeares the 
Ano∣malye
 of this ballaicings compleateth twise, & therefore that inner limbe is double. Wherefore if now you would knowe this 
Aequacion
 for any yeare (
admit the yeare
 2000) seeke the same yeare 2000 in that double limbe, & you shall finde in the outer limbe the minutes of equation that answere thereunto 
(vz. almost
 70 
min. ablatiue)
 to be added or subducted too or from the equall motion before gotten according as the words 
Adiectiuae
 or 
Ablatiuae
 do admonish. 
(vz. whereas the equall motion of the fixed Starres was before found for the yeare af∣ter Christ
 2000 
compleate to be gone forwards
 4 
deg.
 53 
mi. you must now pull out
 70 
minutes, so will there be left
 3 
deg.
 43 
min. their true motion in that
 530 
yeares, according to

 which, the true place of Arcturus, which for the yeare
 1650 
is placed in this Celestiall
 18 
degr.
 55 
min. in ♎, shall then be
 22 
degr.
 38 
min in ♎. And so for any other North Starre, for they all remooue alike.)
 And likewise for any of the South Starres, but that you must for them worke vpon the yeare 1570, as before you did by 1650. Also for any age past 
(as if it had beene for
 350 
yeares before
 1650. 
vz. the yeare after Christ
 1300 
compleate)
 you should haue found the Equation as much adiectiue, and by that meanes the true motion of 350 yeares backwards 6 degr. 3 min. to be pulled backe from their now place, 
(so that Arcturus was then but
 12 
degrees
 52 
min. in
 ♎.






Cap. 31. ¶ How by help of this Astrolabe to get the longi∣tude and latitude of any Planet, yea, or of any Starre or Comet seene.


H
Auing a Meridian exactly set as in the 9 Cap. is taught, you shall obserue the comming of any Planet, Starre, or Comet to the Meridian either in the South or North partes, 
(as for example the
 2 
of October
 1596 
I obserued the comming of ♃ to our Meridian heere at Reading)
 and there take his meridian altitude 
(which I found
 50 ½ 
deg.)
 as is taught in the 11 Cap. and presently (except you haue some clocke or watch truly set) get the houre and minute if you can by taking the altitude of some knowne Starre, as in the 13 Cap. is taught, 
(I found it a quarter of an houre past one and better after midnight)
 which done, seeke that houre and minute in the houre circle, and labell it to the ☉ planted by the 4 Cap. (
at
 20 
de.
 10 
min. of
 ♎) & there hold fast the Zenitfer, & number the verticall distance or complement of the Merid. alti. before-taken 
(vz.
 39 ½ 
de.)
 on y
e
 nooneline frō y
e
 Zenith point towards 
Meridies,
 if your Merid. alti. taken were South, or towards

 
Media nox,
 if North, (
which heere being South, will fall out at the
 12 ¼ 
radiall degree numbered from the Aequinoctiall
) where make a pricke on the Celestiall, for there shall be the true point or place of the (♃) Starre, Planet, or Comet, ob∣serued for that instant, and the circles of the-clipticks longi∣tude and latitude cutting that point, shall shew you his longi∣tude and latitude sought (
vz. the circle of longitude passing by that verticall distance or pricke made, shewed me in the clipticke
 8 
degrees
 30 
minutes almost of
 ♉, 
the longitude of
 ♃, 
and the circle of latitude cutting that pricke, shewed me almost
 2 
degrees Southwards from the-clipticke his latitude.
) And this serueth for the ☽, or any Planet, Starre, or Comet seene. And now by helpe of this latitude thus gotten, you may as easily get the true places of the Starres seene in any other place as well as in the Meridian perpetually, for that their latitudes neuer alter, and of ♄, ♃, or ♂, 20 or 30 dayes af∣ter: for that theirs altereth little in that time, and of ♀ for a day or two after, but not for the ☽, because her latitude chan∣geth swiftly, neither for ☿, because in our Clymat we neuer see him: In this maner.


Take the altitude of any Starre, Planet, or Comet, whose latitude is foreknowne either by this Cap. or otherwise at any houre and minute knowne, taking good heede whether he be in the East or West Hemispheare. Then prepare the Zenitfer to that altitude taken, then labell the houre and minute to the ☉, and there hold fast the Zenitfer. Which done, apply the pointer to the circle of latitude of the Starre or Planet either in the East or West Hemicicle, according as the Starre or Planet was at taking his altitude, so shall the circle of longitude passing by the pointer so applyed, shew the longitude of the Starre or Planet in the-clipticke.


Note, that 
Io. Stophlerus lib.
 2. 
prop.
 38. reciteth 7 propo∣sitions which some lying Astronomers (as he tearmeth them) haue taken vpon them to teach on the Astrolabe, which he there condemneth to be most false, and not possible, and there∣fore

 spendeth a Chapter to forewarne euery man to take heede and not to meddle with them. And these are the 7, the first, to knowe the longitude of the ☽, the second, the longi∣tude of ♄, ♃, ♂, ♀, or ☿, the third, to get their latitudes, the fourth, to know whether a Planet be direct or retrograde, the fift, to know the longitude of any Starre in the Reete, the sixt, the latitude of fixed Starres, the seuenth, the longi∣tude of Starres not in the Reete. And now I am to rewarne all men, that they are all possible by this Astrolabe, and by my Iewell also, and the whole 7 sauing the 4, are performed by this one Chapter: because I would not haue them now daunted with that 38 
propos.
 of 
Stophler
 who meant it no doubt only, by that Astrolabe whereof himselfe wrote.






Cap. 32. ¶ A ready way by helpe of this Astrolabe, heereafter to obserue the motions of Comets.


B
Ecause I haue seene some 4 or fiue yeares past a booke entituled 
Noua theoria Cometarum
 as I remem∣ber, set foorth by one 
Reslyn,
 who taking occasion vppon that great Comet or Blazing-Starre, which 
Anno
 1570 was seene so long in the Constellation of 
Cassiopeia,
 in a manner fixed without motion, to imagining therefore that Comet to happen in the very Pole of the 
Theoricke,
 and that to be the cause why he mooued not, thereupon runneth on a course, with recitall of diuers Co∣mets and their motions, but concluded no certaintie to my remembrance, ending his booke with this saying, 
Est quo∣dam prodire tenus si non datur vltra.
 But our late learned

 countreyman, Mayster 
Digges,
 in his 
Scala Mathematica
 found, because he had no Parallax, that he must needes be beyond the Speere of the ☽. Well no doubt there can not any weighty thing come to perfection at the first, second, or third assay, and therefore to the end it may be a generall care to obserue the motions of Comets when they happen, I haue thought good to aduertise euery man in this Cap. that either on this Astrolabe or on the Globe, it is a most easy matter when any Planet appeareth, to pricke downe his place euen by the very view of his scituation among the fixed Starres, seeing by the 25 Cap. before you may so easily learne to know them all.


As for example in Iuly this yeare 1596 there appeared a Comet with a streaming tayle vpwards in the North-west, which vpon Tewsday the 20 of Iuly aforesayd, about 9 of the clocke at night, I first tooke heede of betweene the two hin∣der legs of 
Vrsa maior
 almost in a streight line, (but some∣what lower, and two parts of the way) between the Starre of the fourth light in the neere hocke of the neere hinder legge, and the two Starres of the third light in the further foote behinde, according whereunto I made a pricke in the Celestiall of this Astrolabe. The 21 of Iuly the same houre, I sawe him directly in the streight line aforesayde, and distant from the sayd two Starres twise their distance. The 22 day the same houre I sawe him a little aboue the streight line, and but their distance off. The 23 of Iuly the night was darke. The 24 of Iuly I sawe him aboue those two Starres of the third light, and to make an equilater triangle with them: all which, I noted downe euery night with pricks, then followed a fewe clowdy and darke nights, and after that 24 day he was no more seene. This Comet was seene of many others some fortnight before I sawe him, as neere as I could gesse by their relacion euen about the brisket of 
Vrsa maior,
 a little behinde the hocke of the neere legge afore, which also I pricked downe: and haue caused

 those pricks and the trayle of his gate to be grauen in the Celestiall, in the Constellacion of 
Vrsa maior
 if you marke it, (though not done fully to my purpose) to the end to incite others heereafter to do the like, that posterity at the last may finde out whether there be any regularity in their motions. If the Comet chaunce to come to the Meridian either in the North or South (as this did not in sight) then by the last Cap. you may get his longitude & latitude euery night, and so pricke downe euery dayes motion the more exactly.




FINIS.
