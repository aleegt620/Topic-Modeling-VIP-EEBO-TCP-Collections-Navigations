THE
PREFACE
To the
READER.


THE Design of this small Tract
is to give an easie and clear
Account of these Parts, which are
now the Seats of Noble and Heroick
Actions; in which every Thing is so
well Contrived, and set in such good
Order and Method, as I believe will
give due Satisfaction to all such as are
Curious and Inquisitive after the Af∣fairs
of these Times.


All the Towns of Note are here
mentioned, and their Situation so well
designed, that they may very easily
and quickly be found in any good
Map; but especially by the help of
the Index, where their Longitude and
Latitude is also set down, (according
to 
F. de Wits
 Maps, the first Me∣ridian


beginning at 
Tenneriff)
 which
is a great help towards the easie find∣ing
of a Place.


Those Towns that are of greatest
Note, and those that are Frontiers, and
probably may be places of Action, are
here very exactly and particularly
described; more largely and better
than are in the vulgar Geographies:
And such Descriptions as these are
both Pleasant and Profitable, and ve∣ry
much needed in these Times.


In short, Reader, here is scarce any
thing wanting that may be reasonably
expected from such a Volumne; and if
it should afford you any Profit, or
one or two hours Divertisement, is
all that I Desire; and shall think my
time not ill bestow'd if it shall deserve
your Perusal.


Vale.












FLANDERS,
OR,
The Spanish-Netherlands
Accurately Described.


Of FLANDERS in General.


THE 
Spanish Netherlands,

or the 
Catholick Provinces,

commonly called by the
general Name of 
Flan∣ders,

(the Principal of
these Provinces) are bounded on the
East, with 
Germany;
 on the West, or
rather North-West, with the 
German
Ocean,
 which parts 'em from 
England;

on the North, with 
Holland,
 or the

Vnited Provinces;
 and on the South
and South-West, with 
France.



The whole is of a kind of a Trian∣gular
From;
 being in length from the
most Eastern parts of 
Luxemburg,
 to
the most Western parts of 
Artois,
 about
192 Miles; and in breadth, from the
most North parts of 
Brabant,
 to the
most South parts of 
Luxemburg,
 about
155 Miles; the whole Circumference
being scarce 600 Miles: containing,
according to 
Sellers
 Account, 7197000
of Acres.


The Principal Rivers in these Pro∣vinces,

are, 1. 
Maes,
 which (besides
its course in 
France)
 passes through

Namur, Liege
 and 
Gelderland,
 wash∣ing
the Towns of 
Charlemont, Dinant,
Namur, Liege, Maestricht, Ruremond,
Venlo, Grave
 and 
Dort,
 below which
it falls into the Sea. 2. 
Scheld,
 or

Escaut,
 passing through 
Cambray, Hai∣nault

and 
Flanders;
 washing the Towns
of 
Cambray, Valenciennes, Tournay; Ghent,

and 
Antwerp,
 a little below which it
falls into the Sea. 3. 
Lys,
 passing
through 
Artois
 and 
Flanders;
 and wash∣ing
the Towns of 
Air
 and 
Courtray,
 and
at 
Ghent
 falls into the River 
Scheld.

Those of less Note shall be spoken of
afterwards.



This is but a small spot of Land,

but exceeding populous, full of excel∣lent
Towns and Villages, and most
plentifully endowed with all things
necessary either for Pleasure or Profit.
So very rich, that at once the King of

Spain
's Revenues from thence (when
he had all) was greater than any
Prince in Christendom, the King of

France
 excepted; but at present the
charge of keeping is much greater
than the Revenues. The Strength of
these parts are very great, and were it
not for the vast increase of the French
Power, and the decay of the Spanish,
it would be thought much greater:
But for a long time the Spaniards
have not been able to keep those they
have still, without great help from
others.


The Traffick in these parts have
been always very great;
 but now no∣thing
so much as formerly, by reason
of the prodigious increase of the 
Vni∣ted
Provinces
 in these late years. It
chiefly consists of several sorts of
Manufactures, as rich Tapestries, fine
Camlets, Serges, coloured Says, Mock-Velvets,
great Quantities of fine Lin∣nen,
Damasks, Cambricks, Taffaties,


and strip'd Stuffs for Beds, which sell
well in many Countries; all sorts of
Ribbons, Bastard Sattins, and many
other things of this Nature, made at
the Cities of 
Mons, Gaunt, Brusselles,
Ypres, Lille, Bruges, Valenciennes, &c.


The Inhabitants of these parts con∣sist
of Flemmings,
 Walloons, Spaniards,
with some intermixture (more espe∣cially
at present) of French, Dutch,
and English. The Religion among
them may be said to be various, accor∣ding
to their several Nations; but
howsoever that of the Roman Church
is only publickly allowed. The Pro∣testants
(which are of no small Num∣ber
in many of the chief Cities) are ra∣ther
suffered out of Policy. The Arch∣bishopricks
and Bishopricks are all Ro∣man
Catholick.


The Languages most generally used
in these parts are the Walloon and
Flemmish;
 the Walloon is a corrupt
French, spoken in 
Artois, Hainault,
Namur, Luxemburg, French Flanders,

some of 
Brabant,
 and the Bishoprick
of 
Liege.
 The Flemmish or Low-Dutch,
is a Dialect of the German,
spoken in the 
Marquisate, Mechlin,
 the
rest of 
Brabant, Flanders,
 and the Bi∣shoprick


of 
Liege.
 The Spanish is al∣so
much in use among the King of

Spain
's Subjects, and the French a∣mong
the better sort. English and
Latin is here well understood by ma∣ny.


In these Provinces are two Archbi∣shopricks,


viz. Cambray
 and 
Mechlin;

and eleven Bishopricks, 
viz. Antwerp,
Boisleduc, Bruges, Ghent, Ruremond
 and

Ypres,
 under 
Mechlin; Namur, Arras,
St. Omers,
 and 
Tournay,
 under 
Cambray;

and 
Liege
 under 
Cologne
 in 
Germany.

Here are also 155 Cities or Walled
Towns, (besides those in 
Cambray
 and
part of 
Gelderland)
 and 6867 Villa∣ges,
besides the Castles, Forts, and
Noble Mens Houses, which are al∣most
innumerable. The chief City of
the whole is 
Antwerp;
 but 
Brussels
 be∣ing
the Seat of the Spanish Governor,
and the Heart of the Country, I shall
reckon the distances from that. The
chief City of the French is 
Mons;
 of
the Hollanders, is 
Boisleduc,
 or 
Mae∣stricht;

and of the Bishop of 
Liege,
Liege.


The Provinces are in Number 10;


viz. 1. Flanders, 2. Artois, 3. Hainault,
4. Namur, 5. Brabant, 6. Marquisate
 of


the Empire, 7. 
Mechlin,
 8. Bishoprick
of 
Liege, 9. Limburg,
 and 10. 
Luxem∣burg;

to these may be added that part
of 
Gelderland
 that is under the Spani∣ards,
and the Dutchy of 
Cambray.
 Of
these, 
Flanders
 borders on the Sea; 
Bra∣bant,

on the 
Vnited Provinces;
 (as like∣wise
does 
Flanders;) Artois
 and 
Hai∣nault,

on 
France,
 (with the Dutchy of

Cambray)
 Bishoprick of 
Liege, Lim∣burg,

and part of 
Gelderland,
 on 
Ger∣many;
Luxemburg,
 on 
France
 and 
Ger∣many:
Namur,
 the 
Marquisate
 and

Mechlin
 are Midland Provinces.


The Government of these Provin∣ces
should be all under the Spaniards;

but at present they have only 
Namur,

the 
Marquisate,
 nigh three quarters of

Brabant,
 nigh half of 
Limburg
 and

Flanders,
 and a quarter of 
Hainault,

with some of 
Gelderland.
 The French
have 
Artois, Luxemburg, Cambray,
 three
quarters of 
Hainault,
 a third part of

Flanders,
 and a quarter of the Bishop∣rick
of 
Liege.
 The Hollanders have
above half of 
Limburg,
 above a quarter
of 
Brabant,
 a sixth part of 
Flanders,

and a small part of the Bishoprick of

Liege.
 The Bishop of 
Liege
 has nigh
three quarters of that Provice.






1. Earldom of FLANDERS.


FLanders

 It is in length about 90
miles, and in breadth 60.


It is a very fine and rich Country,

and accounted the Noblest Earldom
in all Christendom, and is in most pla∣ces
exceeding fertile, and withal so
populous, that the whole may be rec∣koned
but as one City. It has in it
35 Cities or Walled Towns, and 1178
Villages. The chief City of the whole

 (on the 
Scharp.)
 These are all
under the French.




Ghent.


GHent,
 or 
Gaunt,
 the chief City of
this Province, commodiously seated
on the Banks of the Rivers 
Scheld
 and

Leye,
 which run through it, and di∣vide
it into 26 Islands which are joy∣ned
together with 98 Bridges. It is
accounted one of the largest Cities in
the Low-Countrys, being seven miles
in Compass within the Walls, but now
rather decays than encreases. It is well
Walled and Trenched about; and the
private Buildings are for the most part


fair and stately, and the Streets hand∣some
and clean kept. It has seven
Churches, and 55 Religious Houses.
The Cathedral is a most stately Stru∣cture;
and the Tower 
Bellefort
 is a∣bove
400 Steps high. The Castle,
which is the Princes Palace, contains
three hundred Chambers. The Cit∣tadel
consists of four Bastions, which
are but little, and look on one side
upon the City; and on the other to∣wards
the Fields; and tho' this For∣tress
be of a regular form, yet it is
not so convenient as many others in
these parts. The Trade of this place
consists (besides Corn) in Cloths,
Stuffs and Silks, of which there are so
great quantity made, that among the
Fifty Companies of Tradesmen, those
relating to Commodities of this nature
make one third.






Bruges.


BRuges
 or 
Brugge,
 the Second City
in 
Flanders,
 so called from the
multitude of Bridges. It is situated
in a large Plain, about Eight miles
from Sea, and the Walls on the inside


are somewhat above four miles in
Compass; the City being of a round
form, and well Walled and Fortified
with Works of Earth and deep Ditches.
The River 
Rey
 runs through it with a
muddy and heavy stream. The City
it self is exceeding neat, tolerably popu∣lous,
and very well built, many of
the Houses being four or five, and
some six Stories high. It is one of
the most considerable places that the
Spaniards have left; and notwith∣standing
it comes vastly short of its
former Trade, it may well challenge
place among the Cities of the Second
rate in 
Europe.
 The Market place has
a Commodious and Pleasant Situation,
being the Centre where six of the
principal Streets, running from as ma∣ny
of the chief Gates of the City, are
terminated.


Here are Seven Parish Churches,
(that of St. 
Johns
 is Cathedral) 60
Religious Houses, and three Colleges
of Canons, and also a fine College for
the Jesuites. The Chief Trade of
this place is now in Spanish-Wool.
It stands 24 miles nigh West of

Ghent.








Doway.


DOway
 or 
Dovay,
 is a remarkable
place under the French, on the
Borders of 
Artois
 and 
Hainault.
 It is
situated upon the River 
Scharpe,
 and
is of considerable Strength, and has a
fine Magazine very well furnished. It
is likewise considerable for its extent,
ancient Buildings, 
September
 Fair, and
Traffick upon the 
Scheld;
 but more
especially for being an University,
and a Seminary for the English Roman
Catholicks. The Fort stands about a
Cannon-shot below the Town upon
the 
Scharpe,
 and judged by its situa∣tion
among Marshes, by means of its
Sluces, whereby it can drown all the
Country about, to be impregnable.
The chief Trade of this Place consists
in fine Woolen-Camlets, sent into
many Parts. It stands 56 miles almost
South of 
Ghent,
 and 34 West of

Mons.


The next places here discribed, are,
the Five Ports,
 
viz. Dunkirk, Ostend,
Nieuport, Sluys,
 and 
Graveling.








Dunkirk.


DVnkirk,
 or 
Duynskerke,
 is a very
considerable Place of the French,
seated on the Sea, and judged to be
about the bigness of 
Cambridge.
 Be∣yond
the Old Town, there have been,
since it came into the Hands of the
French, great Works drawn, which
augment the Town above one half.
There is a New Trench cut for a
Mile together through the Splinter-Sands,
which will, upon the Head of
the Tide, receive 150 Vessels of 70
Guns apiece; and on the West-side of
this Harbour is raised a vast pil'd and
plank'd Work, to intercept and lodge
the Sands. It is a Place of very great
Strength, but much added by the late
Fortifications, which are very large,
and the Bastion towards the North is
most stately. It is well built and po∣pulous,
and particularly commended
for the Neatness and Regularity of
the Streets. Here is an English Nun∣nery,
and 
Franciscans
 have a Cloyster
for Persons of both Sexes. At the
Mouth of the Haven stands a strong


Castle, on which are planted 200 Pieces
of Cannon. It stands 54 Miles West of

Ghent.






Ostend.


OStend
 stands on the Sea-shore in the
midst of a Moorish Ground, and
among divers Channels; but is chiefly
environed almost on all sides by two
of the greatest of them, by which the
Sea enters into the Land, and grows
so high when at full Tide, that the
Town seems rather to be buried, than
situated in the Sea. It has been more∣over
so exactly and regularly fortifi∣ed,
that it is taken to be one of the
strongest Towns in the 
Low-Countries;

having also a safe and capacious Har∣bour,
(which it is said can never be
blocked up) well defended, and deep
enough to receive Ships of the great∣est
Burden. The Buildings of the
Town are not very tall, but they are
handsom and uniform; the Streets be∣ing
regular, well pav'd, exactly level
and strait; this Regularity is to be at∣tributed
to its being built altogether.
This Town stands 35 Miles almost
West of 
Ghent.








Nieuport.


NIeuport,
 or 
Newport,
 between 
Dun∣kirk

and 
Ostend,
 a small distance
from the Sea-shore, a little River run∣ning
on the one side of it, which tho'
but a mean Channel, yet where it falls
into the Sea, makes a considerable
long and secure Haven, especially at
high Tides; and yet the same (tho'
provided of a good Key) is hardly ca∣pable
of Ships of any great Burden.
The Town it self is a place of good
Strength, having broad and strait
Streets; but the Houses are general∣ly
but low built, and those for the
most part of Timber. It has also a
strong Castle. The Inhabitants of
this Town maintain themselves chiefly
by the Fishing Trade. This Town
stands about 40 Miles West of 
Ghent.






Sluys.


SLuys,
 or 
Sluce,
 stands some distance
from the Sea shore, and is not a∣bove
one of thier Miles in compass,


nor is all that place thorowly Inha∣bited,
though its Situation and Forti∣fication
be such as render it one of the
strongest Places that belong to the
Confederate States in this Province,
being much stronger by reason of the
Isle 
Cadsand
 nigh adjoyning. It was
in former Ages an exceeding wealthy
Place, enjoying that Trade which af∣terwards
removed from hence to

Bruges,
 and from thence to 
Antwerp,

and has still the largest Haven in all

Flanders,
 the same being capable of
Five Hundred good Ships. This
Town stands 22 Miles North West of

Ghent.






Graveling.


GRaveling
 stands nigh the Sea, upon
the Mouth of the River 
Aa,
 which
parts 
France
 from 
Flanders,
 and being
a Frontier Town, upon the approach
of Strangers towards the Gate, notice
is given of their numbers by a Toll
of a Bell for every Horse. It stands
in a low and plashy level, and is en∣viron'd
with so many Outworks, and
Ditches of Water, (having five strong


Bulwarks, and a Cittadel) that it seems
strange that it should be in so short
time delivered up to the English and
French in the year 1658. As for the
Town it self, it is neither large nor
well built, and being moreover not
many years ago but thinly Inhabited.
This Town stands about 64 Miles
West of 
Ghent.


The next Places here described are
the six Frontier Towns;
 the three first
of the French, the rest of the Spani∣ards:
They are 
Lille, Ypres, Tournay,
Courtray, Oudenard,
 and 
Dixmude.






Lille.


LIlle, l'Isle,
 or 
Ryssel;
 the Chief Town
in that part of 
Flanders
 which is
called 
Galligant,
 or 
Walloon.
 It is Si∣tuated
among Pools, Ponds, and Marshes,
but dried up, and firm Land, by the
Earl 
Baldwin de Barbu.
 It is a great
strong and populous Place▪ It was
some years ago accounted the third
Place of Traffick in the Low-Coun∣tries
next 
Amsterdam
 and 
Antwerp:

The Invention of laying on Colours
with Oyl, making of Worsted Sayes,


and many other Stuffs being imputed
to this City. The Inhabitants have
of late employed themselves in Wea∣ving
of Silks, which has much Inrich'd
them; insomuch the French have cal∣led
this Place 
la petit Paris
 for its
Beauty. Here is a good Castle, and
the Ruins of an old one called 
Buck

This Town stands 36 Miles South
West of 
Ghent.






YPres.


YPres, Ypren,
 or 
Ipres,
 stands in a
fruitful Plain, upon a River of the
same Name. It is very strong, said
to be almost impregnably Situated,
and has a new Citradel. It is a well
built place, though Wooden Fronts
take something away from the Beauty
of the place; which are Universally
so well served with Water convey'd
to them in leaden Pipes, that the Foun∣dations
are usually said to be of that
Metal. Its Market-place is one of the
fairest and largest in all these Coun∣tries;
and here stands their Hall or
Repositary for Wool, which, though
old, is nevertheless a handsom piece


of Building. Here are several Con∣vents
in this Town, and among the
Churches, the Cathedral of St. 
Martin

has the Preheminence. It is very Rich,
driving a good Trade (especially in
the Annual Lent-Fair) with its Sayes,
and half Silks, and the like Commo∣dities.
This Town stands 35 Miles
nigh South West of 
Ghent.






Tournay.


TOurnay,
 or 
Dornick,
 is on all sides
surrounded with Fruitful and
Pleasant Fields, and thorough the midst
of it, under divers Bridges, runs the
River 
Schelde,
 which in this place be∣gins
to be Navigable. It is a very
strong place, and has a Noble Castle.
It is a place of great Note, as well for
its Antiquity, as for its being furni∣shed
with People, Traffick, and hand∣some
Buildings; among which are se∣veral
stately Churches and Religious
Houses, and also Honoured with an
Episcopal See; taken by the French in
the year 1667. This Town stands 30
Miles nigh South of 
Ghent,
 and 24
North West of 
Mons.








Courtray.


COurtray,
 or 
Cortryck,
 is Seated upon
the River 
Lys,
 and comes in the
next rank to the Capital Places in these
Provinces, and is reckoned one of the
ancientest Towns in all these Parts.
It is a Place well built, and of great
Strength both by Art and Nature,

OVdenard
 is a Frontier Town of
the Spaniards, (as was 
Courtray
)
Situated upon the River

 It is ac∣counted
one of the fairest Towns
in these Parts, both for Situation,
Traffick, and number of Inhabitants.


It is strengthned by a Castle cal∣led

Pamele,
 which is joyned to the
Town by a fair Bridge; but its
being commanded by a very high
Hill towards the North East, takes
away very much from its Strength.
This Town stands sixteen Miles South
of 
Ghent.

 or 
Dixmuyde,
 is another
of the Frontier Towns of the
Spaniards against the French; Situ∣ated

of the French. This Town
stands between 
Ghent
 and 
Dunkirk,

Thirty four Miles from the former,
and Twenty from the latter.

very strongly fortified with good Bul∣warks,
deep and broad (tho' dry)
Ditches. The Streets are broad and
fair, adorned with a spacious Market-Place.

Castle. The Chief Trade of this
Place consists in making of vast quan∣tities
of Rich Tapestries, and Arras
Hangings, Says, and many such like
Commodities.

 or 
St. Omer,
 is the second
City in this Province, situated up∣on
the River 
Aa,
 by the Borders of

Flanders.
 It is well Fortified with


Walls, Bastions, Half-Moons, Ditches,
Marshes, and Lakes; in the latter are
certain little floating Islands, affording
good Pasture for Cattle, and shelter
for Fish, which in great numbers seek
Covert under them in the extremity
of Heat and Cold. The Riches of
the Inhabitants, the Canal for Com∣merce,
called the New 
Fosse,
 the Ab∣by
of St. 
Bertin,
 and more especially
the English Seminary of Jesuits, have
render'd it a place of publick Note.
and of no common Fame throughout
the World. It stands 36 Miles North
West of 
Arras.






Aire.


AIre
 or 
Arien,
 is situated upon the
River

by 
Charles
 the Fifth. in the year 1554,
nigh the place where old 
Hesdin
 stood,
but enjoys a far better Situation, and
is now a very regular Hexagon, so
well contrived and Fortified, that it is
esteemed one of the strongest Holds
in all the Countries; yet was it taken
by the French in the space of six
Weeks. This Town stands nigh the
Borders of 
France,
 26 Miles nigh West

Mons.


MOns,
 
Monts,
 or 
Berghen,
 is the
Chief City in this Province, and
one of the principal throughout the
Low-Countries. It stands upon a
higher Ground, but with a gentle As∣cent,
except one corner of it, which
is very high, upon which lies a spaci∣ous
Plain, (a place used for Games
and Pastimes) affording a most deli∣cate
prospect This place is wonder∣fully
strong by its very Situation, the
Country round about being easily
overflown for a great space by the
Waters of the 
Haisne
 and 
Trulle,
 nigh
the confluence of which two Rivers,
the City stands, the latter of these
two cutting it through on the lower
side. It is surrounded by a very good
Stone Wall, with a threefold broad
Ditch, and is defended by a strong
Castle. The Buildings of the Town
are both Stately and Beautiful, the
Streets being large, and the Market∣place
spacious; and scarce any place


is better provided of Conduits, which
continually supply the Inhabitants
with Water. Here is a famous
College of Cannonesses, who have
free leave to depart, and Marry
when they shall think fit. This is
also a place of good Trade, which
consists in divers Commodities and
Manufactures, especially in Sayes,
Grograms, and such like.






Ualenciennes.


VAlenciennes
 is a French Frontier,
the second in this Province; It
stands on the River 
Scheld,
 (over
which are Ten Bridges, upon them
stand Stately and Commodious Houses)
incompassed and divided by so many
interspersed Channels, that the place
is rendered exceeding Defensible, by
Reason of the great quantity of
Water which can soon drown the
Country round about. Besides this,
it is Fortified strongly with excellent
Walls and Rampiers incompassed
with extraordinary broad and deep
Ditches; and by Reason of the great
difference of Situation in several parts


of the City, it cannot well be Be∣sieg'd
with less than three Armies
at once. Here are several fine
Buildings in it, as the great Church
of our Lady, the large Convent of
the 
Franciscans,
 and another for the

Dominicans;
 the Town House with
many Building for Publick Use.
This Place has the Staple of French
Wines; and here is also made fine
Linnen Cloth, equalling that of

Cambray,
 with Water-Tabbies, and
such like Commodities. This Town
stands seventeen Miles almost West of

Mons.






Marienburg.


MArienburg,
 Built by 
Mary
 Queen
of 
Hungary,
 Sister to 
Charles

the Fifth, in the year 1542. It is a
French Frontier, situated on the Ri∣ver

Blanche.
 It was (besides the Si∣tuation
so advantagious) so excellent∣ly
well Fortifi'd at first with a very
strong Wall, and four good Bul∣warks,
that it was looked upon as
impregnable, if provided of a suffi∣cent
Garison of Couragious Men, the


loss of it (to the incredible preju∣dice
of these Countries) being impu∣ted
to the base and unworthy Beha∣viour
of the Defendents. This Town
stands Twenty eight Miles South East
of 
Mons,
 and (as I take it) is now Dis∣mantled.






Phillipville.


PHillipville,
 is another French Fron∣tier
Town, Bordring on 
Liege,

built by 
Phillip
 the Second, King of

Spain,
 for a Bulwark against the
French, and Honoured with his own
Name. It is but a small place, but is
a very strong Fortress, strengthned
with five Royal Bastions, besides Walls
and other good Works fit for Defence.
This Town stands about Twenty eight
Miles South East of 
Mons.

 which here
washes 
Charleroy,
 and falls into the

M
es
 at 
Namur.



The Towns in this Province are
thus situated:
 1. 
Charleroy,
 the most
Western Town (on the 
Sambre
) by
the Borders of 
Hainault. 2. Namur,

the Metropolis, 17 Miles East of

Charleroy,
 (on the 
Maes
 and

) by the Bor∣ders
of

Namur.


NAmur
 is the Chief City of this
Province,
 situated in a flat Bot∣tom
between two Hills, upon the
Confluence of the 
Maes
 and 
Sambre,

which divides the Town into two un∣equal
parts, the passage over both of
them being by two Stone-Bridges,
which make the place both more com∣modious


and more beautiful. The
City is adorned with a fair Market∣place,
a Guild-Hall, divers Churches,
& a great Number of very good Stone-Buildings.
Here is also a stately and
strong Castle, standing upon a very
high Hill, the Situation of which ren∣ders
it very defensible, and much con∣duces
to the strength of the Town.
Here are several Religious Houses, of
which that of the 
Franciscans
 is Chief.
This City is rich, and inhabited for
the most part by Nobility, well train∣ed,
and of a Martial Discipline, ha∣ving
but few Merchants and Artifi∣cers
among them.






Charleroy.


CHarleroy
 is a Frontier Town in this
this Province, which was built by
the Spaniards in the year 1666. (in
Honour of the present King of 
Spain
)
seated upon a rising Ground in the ex∣terior
and Western Angle, made by
the meeting of the Rivers 
Pieton
 and

Sambre.
 Soon after it was built it
was quitted by the Spaniards; and by
the French soon after so fortified, that


it became one of the most considera∣ble
Holds in all these Countries, as it
is still. It was restored to the Spani∣ards
in the year 1679. This Town
stands 14 Miles West of 
Namur,
 and
21 East of

CHarlemont
 is also a Frontier Town
of the Spaniards in the Bounds of
this Province, which was built in the
year 1555. by 
Charles
 the Fifth, (from
whom it took its Name.) It is very
conveniently seated upon a Hill, near
the left Bank of the River 
Maes,

(which affords it a good Trade) and
is a very strong Fortress, (though
but a small Town) and of very exact
and regular Fortification. This Town
stands 20 Miles South of 
Namur.








Bovines.


BOvines,
 or 
Bovigne,
 is another
Frontier Town, (but whether of
the French or Spaniards I am a little
uncertain) situated on the West-Bank
of the 
Maes,
 scarce two Miles from

Dinant
 on the other side of the River.
It is but a small Town, and of no ve∣ry
great Strenght, but is chiefly con∣siderable
for its being a Pass between

Namur
 and 
Luxemburg,
 and for That
it deserves here to be taken Notice of.
It stands 11 Miles South of 
Namur.

 is another Fron∣tier
of the Hollanders, of singu∣lar
importance by Reason of its Situa∣tion
between 
Brabant, Flanders, Hol∣land,

and 
Zealand;
 and the greatest part
of the Country about it lies very low,
and is Habitable only by Banks. It is
certainly at present a place of exceed∣ing
Strength; for besides its Wall and
Trench, it is provided of Half Moons,
Hornworks, and other Structures of
Defence, contrived by such as are
most Skilful in the Art of Fortifica∣tion.
The Buildings of the Town
are very fair and handsome; and its
three Market Places are large and ca∣pacious.
Amongst the Edifices, the
Church of St. 
Lambert,
 and the Mar∣quesses
Palace deserves Observation.
This Town stands Forty two Miles
North of 
Brussels,
 and Eighteen of

Antwerp.








Gemblours.


GEmblours,
 a Frontier Town of the
Spaniards on the Borders of 
Na∣mur,

situated upon the steep of an
Hill; being environ'd by Precipices
and deep Vallies on all sides but to∣wards
the East, which it is overtop'd
by the highest point of the said Hill,
at the Foot whereof runs the small
River 
Lorn.
 This Town is but small,
and is most remarkable for the fa∣mous
Abby of St. 
Benedict,
 the Ab∣bot
whereof is Temporal as well as
Spiritual Lord of the Town. This
Town stands 20 Miles South-West of

Brussels.






Niville.


NIville,
 another Spanish Frontier on
the Borders of 
Hainault.
 It is
but a small place, but well fortified,
and enjoys several ample Priviledges.
It is most remarkable for the famous
Nunnery, and the great Quantities of
fine Linnen Cloth, said to equal that


of 
Cambray.
 This Town stands 13
Miles South of 
Brussels.








6. The MARQUISATE.


THe 
Marquisate
 of the Holy Empe∣ror,

is a very small Province, ac∣counted
one of the Four Quarters or
Tetrarchies of 
Brabant,
 bounded on
the West with 
Flanders,
 from which
separated by the River 
Scheld,
 and
on all other sides by 
Brabant.
 It is
much smaller than it was formerly,
not being above seven Miles long,
and four broad; yet it is reckoned a
distinct Province from the rest of the

Netherlands.


The Chief Rivers are,
 1. 
Scheld,

which washes 
Antwerp,
 and divides
this Province from 
Flanders,
 and then

Brabant
 from 
Flanders. 2. Schynt,

which also runs by 
Antwerp,
 and there
falls into the 
Scheld.



The chief and only place of Note
in this Province is 
Antwerp,
 the Me∣tropolis
of all these Provinces. It
stands on the River 
Scheld
 on the Bor∣ders
of 
Flanders,
 22 Miles North of

Brussels,
 and 75 South of 
Amsterdam.

it is now under the subjection of the
Spaniards. I find no Villages in this
Province.




Antwerp.


ANtwerp
 was formerly one of the
most famous places in 
Europe,
 and
still a Noble City, deservedly counted
the chief of these Provinces. It is
nigh eight Miles in Circuit, and is
compared to a Bow, the string of
which is represented by the River

Scheld,
 on which it stands. It is en∣compassed
with vast strong and beau∣tiful
Walls, being 110 Foot broad on
the top, upon which are four or five
Rows of 
Linden
 Trees regularly plant∣ed;
the Walls themselves being ex∣cellently
faced with Stone, having
eight strong Bulwarks contrived with
great Art for mutual Defence, and 13
fine Gates for entrance. The Streets


are straight and large, and the Build∣ings
more Stately and Magnificent,
for Beauty equalling, if not surpassing,
any in all 
Europe.
 On the South side
of the City stands the Cittadel, an
incomparable Work, about a Mile in
Compass: It is a Pentagon composed
of five Royal Bastions, the best con∣trived
of all Modern Fortifications,
commanding both City and Country.
To describe all the Churches, publick
Buildings, 
&c.
 would take a Volume.
For matter of Trade it once surpassed
any place in the World, but now
much declined, though still of vast re∣sort,
by reason of the excellent River
which bears Ships of the greatest Bur∣then
close up to the very shore.










7. Seigneury of MECHLIN.


MEchlin,
 or 
Malines,
 is another
very small Province, bounded
on every side with 
Brabant,
 and is
nigh the middle of it, though not far
off the Borders of 
Flanders.
 It is in
length about eight Miles, and in
breadth six.


It is a distinct Province from the
rest, and Residence for the Parliament
for these Countries, but has not those
Priviledges that 
Brabant
 has; for that
Reason the Women here when they
are ready to Lie-in, go into 
Bra∣bant

to be brought to Bed, that their
Children may enjoy their Privi∣ledges.


In the compass of this Province
lies one City,
 or Walled Town, and
nine Villages. The City is called

Mechlin,
 on the River 
Demer,
 four∣teen
Miles almost North East of 
Brus∣sels,



and as many South East of 
Ant∣werp,

and under the Spaniards.


Chief Rivers are, 1. 
Demer,
 which
runs through the middle, and washes

Mechlin,
 and then into 
Brabant,
 and
falls into the 
Scheld. 2. Senne,
 which
here falls into the 
Demer.


To this Province is usually joyned
(by Geographers) the Dukedom of

Aerschot,
 lying Eastward of 
Mechlin,

about thirteen Miles long, and four
broad. The Chief Place is 
Aerschot,

thirteen Miles East of 
Mechlin,
 (on the

Demer)
 under the Spaniards.




Mechlin.


MEchlin,
 or 
Malines,
 is very com∣modiously
seated on the River

Demer,
 which runs through the
midst of it, dividing the City into
divers Islands, which are united in
several Places by a great number
of Bridges. It is a place of con∣siderable
Strength, being Fortified
with good Walls, but much more
defenseable by Reason of its own
level Situation, and the flatness of


the adjoyning Country, which up∣on
every little occasion, may be laid
under Water. The Houses are ve∣ry
neatly built, and considerable
both for Beauty and largeness of
Structure. It is divided into seven
Parishes, each of which have a Mag∣nisicent
and Stately Church; that
of St. 
Rumbald
 being Chief, ha∣ving
a very lofty Tower. The
Chief Trade of this Place consists in
Tanning, making of Linnen Cloth,
and casting great Artillery and
Bells.










8. Bishoprick of LIEGE.


LIege,
 has on the East, 
Limburg
 and

Juliers
 in 
Germany;
 on the West
and North, 
Hainault, Namur
 and

Brabant;
 and on the South, 
Luxem∣bourg.

It is part of the 
Westphalian

Circle in 
Germany,
 though annexed
to these Provinces, and is in length
about 74 Miles, and in breadth 35.


The Soil is very fruitful,
 produ∣cing
great plenty of Fowl and Veni∣son,
Mines of Lead and Iron, with
large Quarries of Marble of all sorts,
and Alablasters, which very much en∣riches
this Country. It has in it 24
Cities or Walled Towns, and 1800
Villages. The Chief City is 
Liege.


Chief Rivers are, 1. 
Maes,
 which
here washes 
Dinant, Hoey, Liege, Mae∣stricht,
Stochem
 and 
Maeseyck,
 and
runs into 
Gelderland. 2. Demer,
 which
here washing 
Bilsen
 and 
Huffelt,
 runs


into 
Brabant. 3. Jecker,
 which washes

Tongres,
 and falls into the 
Maes
 at

Maestricht. 4. Wesdret,
 which washes

Viviers,
 and falls into the 
Maes
 at

Liege.


The Towns in this Province are
thus situated:
 1. 
Hamont,
 the most
North Town. 2. 
Peer,
 nine Miles
South-West of 
Hamont. 3. Brey,
 se∣ven
Miles East of 
Peer. 4. Maeseyck,

11 Miles East of 
Brey,
 (on the 
Maes)

bordering on 
Juliers. 5. Stochem,

five Miles South of 
Maeseck,
 (on the

Maes▪) 6. Herk,
 25 Miles nigh West
of 
Stochem,
 (on the 
Herk) 7. Haf∣felt,

five Miles East of 
Herk,
 (on the

Demer.)
 8. St. 
Truyen.
 eight Miles
South-West of 
Haffelt. 9. Tongeren,

10 Miles East of St. 
Truyen. 10. Bil∣sen,

five Miles North-East of 
Tonge∣ren.
11. Maestricht,
 six Miles East
of 
Bilsen,
 (on the 
Maes,)
 by 
Limburg.

This is under the 
Hollanders. 12. Liege

or 
Luyck,
 the Metropolis, 13 Miles
South of 
Maestricht,
 (on the 
Maes.)
13. Hoey,
 on the same River, 14
Miles South-West of 
Liege. 14. Chi∣ney,

17 Miles nigh South-West of

Hoey.
 These are all (except 
Mae∣stricht)



under the Bishop of 
Liege.
15. Dinant,
 10 Miles South-West of

Chiney,
 (on the 
Maes.) 16. Floren∣nes,

10 Miles West of 
Dinant. 17.
Walcourt,
 or 
Valencourt,
 seven Miles
West of 
Florennes. 18. Thuin,
 10
Miles nigh West of 
Walcourt.
 These
are all under the 
French.




Liege.


LIege,
 or 
Luyck,
 is the Principal Ci∣ty
in this Province, situated in a
pleasant Valley environed with Hills;
the River 
Maes
 entring it in two
Branches accompanied with lesser
Streams, which make many delight∣ful
Islands. It is above four Miles in
Circuit, but inferiour to several o∣thers
in these parts for Beauty or Ri∣ches,
the Houses being for the most
part built of Timber, some of them
being covered with Boards, and some
with Slates; and the Streets are nei∣ther
broad, nor cleanly kept. On
the Brow of a Hill which hangs over
it, stands the Citadel or Castle of
great strength, built to Command the


Town, without which it would be
but of small Consequence. It is a fa∣mous
University, Endowed with large
Ecclesiastical Revenues. Here are
eight Collegiate, and 32 Parochial
Churches; of these most are fair and
stately. The whole Town is made
up of Thirty Two Companies of
Freemen, among whom the Gold∣smiths
have the Preheminence.






Maestricht.


MAestricht
 is the second City in
this Province, subject to the

Hollanders.
 It is situated upon the
River 
Maes,
 by which it is cut tho∣row,
not in the midst, but on one
side by the said River, and the lesser
part which lies towards 
Germany
 is
called the 
Wick.
 It is fortified with
good Works, besides a strong Wall
and Trench, and the 
Wick
 is said to
be stronger than the Town. To∣wards
the South-East lies a Hill,
which rises gently, and overlooks
part of the Town, under which is
one of the Noblest Quarries of Stone


in the World: To prevent this Dis∣advantage,
the Bastion answering to
it is built very high. One Advantage
to the Besieger is the Nature of the
Earth, which is very Minable, and
Commodious for Intrenching. The
private Houses are generally covered
with black Slate, otherwise not very
beautiful. The Town-House is a
very fair Structure; and the Stone-Bridge,
which joyns both parts of
the City, has nine Arches, and is ve-beautiful.
Here are nigh Twenty
Monasteries, and three Dutch Chur∣ches;
and one common to the Eng∣lish
and French.








Dinant.


DInant,
 is a Frontier Town of the
French in this Province, on the
Borders of 
Namur.
 It stands on the
East-Bank of the River 
Maes,
 (scarce
two Miles from 
Bovines
 on the other
side) over which it has a Stone-Bridge.
It is but a small place, but yet of
account; and was formerly of
vast Trade, but it has been so often
destroyed, that the Trade have been
extreamly hindred; but however the
Inhabitants have a considerable Re∣venue
from Black Marble, Iron and
Brass. This Town stands 38 Miles
South-West of 
Liege,
 and 14 South
of 
Namur.










9. Dukedom of LIMBURG.


LImburg
 has on the East,
 
Juliers

in 
Germany;
 on the West, the
Bishoprick of 
Liege;
 and the North,
part of 
Liege
 and 
Juliers;
 and on
the South 
Luxemburgh.
 This is also
accounted a part of the Circle of

Westphalia
 in 
Germany,
 being in length
about Thirty eight Miles, and in
breadth Thirty.


This Province produces all neces∣sary
Commodities,
 except Wine,
which defect is Recompensed with
excellent Wheat, great store of Fewel,
and plenty of the best Iron Mines
in all these Countries. It has in it
five Cities or Walled Towns, and
123 Villages. The Chief City in

Limburg.


Chief Rivers are,
 1. 
Maes,
 which
runs but through a little part of
this Province. 2. 
Geul,
 which washes



Valkenburg,
 and falls into the 
Maes
3. Wesdret,
 which watereth 
Limburg,

and runs into 
Liege. 4. Bervine,

which washes 
Dalem,
 and falls into the

Maes.


The Towns of these Province are
thus Situated. 1. 
Remborch,
 the most
North Eastern Town on the Borders
of 
Juliers. 2. Rolduck,
 four Miles
South ot 
Remborch,
 on the Borders
of 
Juliers. 3. Falkenburg,
 or 
Fau∣quemont,

thirteen Miles West of 
Rol∣duck,

(on the 
Geul.
) 4.

Miles nigh South West of 
Valkenburg,

(on the 
Bermine
) these are all under
the Hollanders. 5. 
Limburg,
 the Me∣tropolis,
15 Miles nigh South East
of 
Dalem,
 (on the 
Wesdret
) and
70 nigh East of 
Brussels.
 This is
under the Spaniards, and is the on∣ly
place of Note that they now have
here.






Limburg.


LImburg
 is the Chief City in this
Province,
 which is Situated upon
a Rock, which overlooks all the
Country round about; at the bot∣tom
thereof runs the River 
Wesdrit,

almost round it among several shady
Woods. It is but a small City, for
it chiefly consists of one broad short
Street; neither is it considerable for
its Beauty, for the Building are for
the most part of Wood, but it is of
no small Consideration for its Strength,
for it is encompassed with a strong
Wall and a Trench, and the access
to it, which is on the North side, is
extreamly difficult, lying all along
upon the edge of the Rock; from one
side thereof to the other the Gate of
the Town (over which are the Go∣vernors
Lodgings) spreeds it self, and
quite Locks up and Commands the
whole Passage.








Ualkenburg.


VAlkenburg,
 or 
Vauquemont,
 is reck∣oned
the Second City in 
Limburg,

said to belong to the Bishop of 
Liege,

though now under the Hollanders.
It is situated upon the River 
Geul,
 and
is large, and indifferent neatly Built,
as well as tollerably Fortifi'd; but
the Castle, which stands above it, up∣on
a steep Rock, is a place of more
than ordinary Strength, being inac∣cessible,
and impregnable to an E∣nemy
that brings not Cannon along
with him: In it are said to be certain
Caves of so prodigious a Bigness, that
a whole Army may be well hid in
them. Yet in the year 1672, upon the
News of the French coming, it was
immediately quitted. It stands 20
Miles North of 
Limburg.

VVest of 
Bastoigne. 2. Buillon,
 or 
Bo∣villon,

19 Miles nigh South-VVest of
St. 
Hubart.






Luxemburg.


LVxemburg,
 or 
Lutzenburg,
 is the
Principal City of this Province,
and is commodiously seated in respect
of Strength, upon the little River 
Al∣stitz,

which divides it into two equal
parts; the best part of it stands on
the top of a Hill, and is surrounded
with very good and defensible Walls,
and other proper Fortifications there∣to
belonging. It is of great compass,
and is indifferently stored with good
Stone-Buildings, but by reason of the
many Hazards of War it has gone
through, many of the Houses were
not only neglected, but deserted by
the Owners. The Old Town, which
in former times was a large and well-built
City, is now but only the Su∣burbs
to the New. Here is a Cloister
of 
Franciscans,
 said to be founded in
the Life-time of St. 
Francis.
 It has
been under the French ever since the
year 1684. who since their late posses∣sion
have much added to its Fortifi∣cations.








Thionville.


THionville
 is the second City in this
Province, commodiously seated
upon the Western Bank of the River

Moselle.
 It is a place of very great
Strength, encompassed with a Brick
and Stone VVall, having six Bul∣warks,
and strengthened with four
large Hornworks; the broad and
deep Ditch which surrounds it not be∣ing
destitute of VVater even in the
greatest Drought in Summer. The
outward sloping Curtain is all along
thick set with strong Stakes or Palli∣sadoes;
and before the Gate that
opens towards 
Luxemburg,
 is more∣over
raised a vast Hornwork. This
Town stands 14 Miles South of 
Lux∣emburg.








Montmedy.


MOntmedy,
 deserves to be menti∣oned
here, though it is a place
of no great bigness, yet it is always
reckoned a place of great strength. It
is very conveniently situated upon the
top of an high Hill, the foot whereof
is watered by the River 
Chier.
 It has
been oftentimes taken by the French
in the Wars of these later Ages, which
was generally imputed to its want of
Provisions, and a sufficient Garison.










GELDERLAND.


GElderland,
 (I mean only that part
which is subject to the Spaniards)
or the Quarter of 
Ruermond,
 has on
the East, and North, 
Cleves
 in 
Ger∣many;

on the West, 
Brabant;
 and
on the South, 
Juliers
 in 
Germany.
 It
lies some distance from the rest of

Gelderland,
 being 36 Miles long, and
28 broad.


The Soil is Fruitful,
 and bears all
sorts of Grains; abounding moreover
with rich Pasture Grounds, which
Fattens great droves of Cattel, which
are sent from many far places.


Chief Rivers are, 1. 
Maes,
 which
runs through the midst of this part,

washing 
Ruermond
 and 
Venlo,
 and so
passes on, dividing 
Brabant
 from the
rest of 
Gelderland. 2. Niers,
 which
washes 
Gelders,
 and runs into 
Cleves.



The Cities or Walled Towns are
only three,
 and are thus situated.
1. 
Gelders,
 the Metropolis nigh the
Borders of 
Cleves,
 (on the 
Niers
) a∣bout
Eighty four Miles North East of

Brussels. 2. Venlo,
 ten Miles South
West of 
Gelders,
 (on the 
Maes
) nigh
the Borders of 
Juliers. 3. Ruermond,

or 
Roermond,
 eleven Miles South of

Venlo,
 (on the 
Maes
) likewise by the
Borders of 
Juliers.
 These are all
Subject to the Spaniards.




Gelders.


GElders,
 the Chief City in this part,
and gives Name to the whole
Province; It is a place of no very
great bigness, seated in a very conve∣nient
place, and receives the little
River 
Niers
 into its Trenches. It has
a Castle of great Antiquity, the antient
Seat of those who were Governors of
this Province, under several Titles;
which together with the City it self,
is strongly Fortified by the Marshes
that encompass them both; but whe∣ther
it may be imputed to this, or to


the firm Loyalty of the Inhabitants,
that it was never yet brought under
the Jurisdiction of the 
Vnited Pro∣vinces,

I shall not presume to deter∣mine.
This Town stands 26 Miles
nigh South East of 
Nimigen,
 the Chief
of the Province.






Ruermond.


RVermond,
 or 
Roermond,
 which gives
Name to this Quarter or Part, is
situated on the River 
Maes,
 where it
receives the 
Roer,
 very convenient for
Defence. It is a rich and well Peopled
City, and is remarkable both for the
Strength of its Walls, and the neat∣ness
of its Buildings. It is a Bishops
See, and is Cathedral Church, is de∣dicated
to the Holy Ghost; here is al∣so
an ample and wealthy Monastery
of the 
Carthusians,
 so much commen∣ded
by Travellers. This Town stands
21 Miles South of 
Gelders.










Archbishoprick of CAM∣BRAY.


CAmbray,
 or 
Cambreses,
 was some
times reckoned a part of 
Hainault,

but distinct, bounded on the North
and East with 
Hainault;
 on the West
with 
Artois;
 and on the South, 
Pi∣cardy

in 
France.
 It is length 32 Miles,
and in breadth 18.


The Soil of this Province is extra∣ordinary
Fruitful,
 producing great
quantities of Corn, Grains, and seve∣ral
Fruits, but is not altogether so
good for Wines. The Archbishop of
this Province was sometimes reckoned
a Prince of the Empire.


The Chief Rivers are,
 1. 
Scheld,

which here washes 
Crevecoer
 and

Cambray,
 and then runs into 
Hainault

and 
Flanders. 2 Selle,
 which here
washes 
Chateau Cambreses,
 and runs
into 
Hainault. 3. Sambre,
 which go


through a little part of this Province,
and runs into 
Hainalt.


The Cities or Walled Towns are
here but three in Number, and are
thus situated: 1. 
Cambray,
 58 Miles
South-East of 
Brussels,
 (on the 
Scheld▪
)
2. 
Crevecoer,
 five Miles South of 
Cam∣bray,

(on the 
Scheld.
) 3. 
Chateau Cam∣breses,

12 Miles East of 
Crevecoer,
 (on
the 
Selle.
) These are all under the
French.




Cambray.


CAmbray,
 or 
Camerick,
 is the Chief
City in this Province, by the Bor∣ders
of 
Hainault.
 It is situated upon
the River 
Scheld,
 which runs through
it, and fills all its Ditches. It is said
to be of greater Importance than al∣most
any other in the 
Low-Countries;

being regularly fortified with Ram∣parts,
Bastions, Half-Moons, and two
good Forts; and is commanded by a
Citadel of Square Figure; and is
moreover placed in a most advanta∣gious
Situation; having on the West∣side,
and in a low bottom, exceed∣ing


large Suburbs, with delicate Mea∣dows
and Gardens lying all along the
River. The private Buildings are ve∣ry
fair, and the publick much fairer.
It contains nine Parishes, and has three
Abbies, with a great Number of Re∣ligious
Houses, besides Hospitals and
other publick Buildings. Here are
many Rich Merchants, and the prin∣cipal
Trade consists in making that
fine Linnen called Cambrick. It stands
32 Miles South-West of 
Mons,
 and 94
North of 
Paris.












BEcause Calais is a Frontier
Town, and a place of great
Importance, I think it will be
convenient to give a Description
of it, though it be in no part of
Flanders.




Calais.


CAlais,
 or 
Calis,
 a very strong Town
in the Province of 
Picardy
 in 
France,

once belonging to the English, and
held by them 210 years; but regain∣ed
by the French in the Reign of
Queen 
Mary;
 the loss of which grie∣ved
her so much, as it was thought
the cause of her death. It is very
advantagiously situated for Defence
nigh the Sea; now very strongly for∣tified
after the Modern Fashion, with
an impenitrable Wall and Bastions of
Earth, a deep Trench full of Water
to the Landward, and a large Citta∣del.


The Wall and Cittadel were
built about 65 years since. The old
Stone-Wall and Ditch are still re∣maining,
but enclosed with the new.
The Town is somewhat bigger than

Dover
 in 
England,
 from which it stands
opposite, and is very populous, and
well frequented, by reason of its be∣ing
the immediate Port from 
England,

and for that Reason called the Key of

France.
 It hath a large square Piazza
or Market-Place, wherein are two
great Markets weekly kept, the one
on 
Tuesdays,
 the other on 
Saturdays.

The Government is by a 
Mayor
 and
four 
Eschevins,
 chosen annually by the
Burgesses or Freemen.
