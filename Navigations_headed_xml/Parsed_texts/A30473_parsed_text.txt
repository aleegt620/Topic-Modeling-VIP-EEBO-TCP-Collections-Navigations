The Stationer to the Reader.


I Can give no other account of these 
Letters,
 but
that they were communicated to me, by a person
of known Integrity; who assured me, that he who
made these 
Observations,
 is a man of great vertue,
and considerably learned: who has been long and
much in 
Italy:
 who is both capable of looking nar∣rowly
into matters, and is of such severe morals,
that one may safely depend on all he says. This was
enough for me; so without making any further en∣quiry,
or knowing any thing of the 
Author,
 I have set
about the printing of them.


VALE.












A
LETTER
Writ from
ROME,
To one in Holland, concerning the
QUIETISTS.


SIR,


Y
Our desire of being informed
particularly by me, of the state
of 
Religion
 and 
Learning
 in 
Italy,

and chiefly here at 
Rome,
 has
quickned my curiosity, and has
set an edge upon a humour that is of it self
Inquisitive enough: and tho I am not so
much in lo
 with writing, as to delight in
transmitting you long 
Letters,
 yet I find
I have matter at present for a very long one;
chiefly in that which relates to the 
Quietists:

for you observe right, that the short hints
that 
Dr. Burnet
 gave of their matters in his

Letters,
 did rather increase the curiosity of


the 
English,
 than satisfy it. He told as much as
was generally known in 
Rome
 at that time,
concerning them; but as a longer stay might
have discovered more particulars to him, so
there have fallen out since that time such
new and surprising accidents, that there is
not more hearkning after new 
Evidence
 in

England,
 upon the breaking out of 
Plots,

than there was at 
Rome
 upon the Impri∣sonment
of so great a number of persons in

February
 and 
March
 last; the number alone
of 200 
persons,
 was enough to raise a great
curiosity; but this was much encreased by
the quality of the persons that were clapt
up, who were both for Rank, for Learning,
and for Piety, the most esteemed of any in

Rome.
 So I was pusht on by my own Incli∣nations,
as well as by your Entreaties,
to take all the pains that was possible for me,
to be well Informed of this matter. The
particular Application with which I had read
some of the Books of Devotion writ in this
method, and the pleasure, and, I hope, pro∣fit,
that I had found in it, made me still
the more earnest to know this matter to the
bottom. It is true, it was hard to find it out:
for those who have been in 
Rome,
 know with
how much caution all people there talk of
matters that are before the 
Inquisition:
 those
are like the Secrets of state elsewhere:
of which a man cannot talk much without


incurring some Inconvenience; and there is
no Inconvenience that is more terrible at

Rome,
 than the falling into the hands of the

Inquisitors:
 for besides the Danger that a
man runs, if the suspitions are well founded,
the least ill effect that this must have, is the
cutting off all a mans hopes of Preferment;
for what a Suspition of 
High Treason
 is else∣where,
the Suspition of 
Heresy
 is at 
Rome;

and where there are many Pretenders, and
there is so much to be expected, you may
imagine that Hope and Fear working at the
same time so powerfully, it must be very hard
to ingage such persons as probably know the
secret of things, to trust themselves upon so
tender a point, to strangers. The truth is,

Learning
 is so low in 
Italy,
 and the Opinion
that they have of the Learning of 
Strangers,

chiefly of 
Hereticks,
 is so high, that they do
not willingly enter either on Subjects of 
Lear∣ning

or of 
Religion
 with them; and on the
other hand a 
Stranger
 and a 
Heretick,
 who is
considered as a 
Spye,
 or a fair Enemy at best,
will not find it convenient to thrust on
such subjects of conversation, as are tender
and suspitious. All this is to prepare you
for a relation which you will perhaps think
defective, yet is as full a I could possibly ga∣ther,
out of all the Hints and Informations
that some moneths stay at 
Rome
 procured
me.



The first thing that surprises a 
stranger

in 
Rome,
 is the very unequal mixture of

Wealth
 and 
Poverty,
 that he sees here, as well
as in all the parts of 
Italy;
 yet it is more con∣spicuous
here, than elsewhere: for as the

Wealth
 of the 
Churches, Palaces
 and 
Convents

is astonishing, so the 
Poverty
 of the 
Inhabi∣tants,

and the meanness of the ordinary Buil∣dings,
is extremely unsuteable to the magni∣ficence
of the other. When a man sees what

Italy
 was an Age or two ago, not to go back
so far as to remember what 
Rome
 was once;
he can hardly imagin how such a fall, such
a dispeopling, and such a poverty could be∣fall
a 
Nation
 and 
Climate,
 that Nature has
made to be one of the richest of the world, or of

Europe
 at least; if the PRIESTS had not at
the same time a secret to make the 
Natives

miserable, in spite of all that Abundance
with which Nature has furnished them. It
were not able to withstand even an ordinary
Enemy, and it can scarce support it self. Those

Italians
 that have seen the Wealth and
Abundance that is in 
England
 and 
Holland,

tho their 
Sun
 is less favorable, and their 
Cli∣mate

is more unhappy, and that come home
so see their 
Towns
 deserted, and their 
Inha∣bitants

in Raggs, speak of this sometimes
with an Indignation that is too sensible to
be at all times kept within bounds. They
speak of the difference betweeen 
Holland
 and



Italy,
 like men affected when they compared
the 
two
 soils and Climates together. The
one is a 
soil
 divided between 
sand
 and 
turff,

preserved from the Innudations of 
Land-floods,

and the overflowing of the 
sea,
 at a
vast Charge, suffering often such losses as
would ruin other 
states,
 and paying great
and constant Impositions: and yet with all
these Inconveniences, and all the disadvan∣tages
of a feeble 
sun,
 a stagnating and phleg∣matick

Air,
 violent 
Colds,
 and moderate,
or at least very shorts 
Heats,
 this 
Countrey
 is
full of 
Wealth
 and 
People;
 and there is in it
such an abundance of great 
Towns
 and con∣siderable

villages,
 and in all these there appear
so many marks of 
plenty,
 and none at all of

Want:
 and the 
other
 has a kind 
sun,
 long and
happy 
Summers,
 and mild 
Winters:
 a fruit∣ful
and rich 
soil,
 and every thing that the 
In∣habitants

can wish for on Natures part, to ren∣der
them the Envy of the World: whereas
they are become the 
Scorn
 and contempt
of all that see them. And as much as the

Dutch
 seem to have acted in spite of Nature
on the one hand, in rendring themselves
much more considerable than she has Intended
they should be; so the Government of 
Italy

seems to have reversed the design of Nature
as much on the other hand, by reducing
the 
Inhabitants
 to such a degree of Misery,
in spite of all her Bounty: upon this subject


the 
Italians
 will talk more freely than upon
matters of 
Religion:
 and do not stick to say,
that it flows from the share that PRIESTS
have in the Government, and that not only in
the 
Popes
 Territory, but in all the other

Courts
 of 
Italy,
 where they have the main
stroke. They will tell you, that 
Priests

have not Souls big enough, nor tender
enough, for Government: they have both a
narrowness of spirit, and a sourness of mind,
that does not agree with the Principles of
human Society: Their having so short and
so uncertain a time of governing, makes
them think only on the present, so that they
do not carry their prospect to the Happiness
of, or misery that must be the consequences
of what they do, at any considerable di∣stance
of time: nor have they those Com∣passions
for the Miserable with which wise

Governours
 ought to temper all their Coun∣sells;
for a stern sourness of temper, and an
unrelenting hardness of heart, seems to be∣long
to all that sort of 
men
 in 
Italy.
 What∣soever
advances their present Interests, and
inriches their families, is preferred to all
wise, great or generous councells. Now tho
the 
Natives
 dare not carry this matter fur∣ther,
yet a 
stranger,
 that thinks more freely,
and that has examined matters of Religion,
in a more Inquisitive manner, sees plainly
that all these errors in 
Government,
 are the


effects of their 
Religion,
 and of that authori∣ty
which they believe is lodged in the 
Pope,

chiefly and of which every 
Priest
 has so con∣siderable
a share, that he is easily able to
make himself master of every mans Consci∣ence
that lets him into it, and that believes
those 
three
 great branches of their power:
that 
they can pardon their sins, make their
God,
 and 
secure them both from Hell and Pur∣gatory.

These are things of such a mighty
operation, that if it is not easy to imagine how
they should be so easily believed, yet suppo∣sing
once the belief of them, all other
things flow very naturally from thence: men
are not convinced of these errors till it is too
late to come and undeceive others. It is true,
many of the 
Italians
 believe these things
as little as we do; yet this is in them rather
an effect of a loose and libertine temper, than
of study and enquiry, in a 
Countrey
 where
not only 
Heretical books
 would endanger a
man, but the bare reading even of a 
Latin

New 
Testament
 would give some suspition.
But the thinking men among them are led to
doubt of all things, rather from a principle of

Atheism,
 than of searching into matters of
Controversy: the one is much less dangerous
there, than the other would be. And indeed
as soon as a man becomes a little familiar with
any of the 
men
 of freer thoughts here, he will
soon see that the belief of their 
Religion
 has


very little power over many of those who are
the most zealous to support it, only because
their Interest determins them. When a man has
lived some time at 
Rome,
 and has known a lit∣tle
of the Mysteries of the 
Conclave,
 with the

Character
 both of the present and the late 
Popes,

particularly the weakness and Ignorance of 
him

that now 
reigns,
 who does not so much as
understand 
Latin;
 when a man sees how mat∣ters
are carried in that 
Court,
 what are the 
Ma∣ximes

they go by, and the 
Methods
 that they
take; when he sees what a sort of men the 
Car∣dinals

are, men indeed of great Civility, and
of much Craft; but as to the matters of 
Reli∣gion,

men of an equal sise both of Ignorance
and Indifference: when a man sees how all
preferments are obtained, but chiefly how the

purple
 is given, and how men rise up to the

Triple Crown:
 when, I say, a man has seen
and observed all this a little, he cannot wonder
enough at the 
Character
 that so great a part of
the World sets on that 
Court.
 The plain and
simple Arguments of Common sense work so
strong, that 
Transubstantiation
 it self is not har∣der
to be believed, than that this man is Christs

Vicar,
 a man of 
Infallibility,
 and the source or
channel at least of divine 
truth.
 So that a
man that has given himself the opportunities
of observing these matters Critically, will feel
a persuasion of the falsehood of those preten∣sions
formed so deep in him, that all the Sophi∣stry


of Argument will never be able to over∣throw
it: for the plain sense of what he has
seen will apparently discover the delusion of
those Reasons, which perhaps he is not lear∣ned
enough to answer: for let men say what
they will, it is no easy matter to believe in a
Contradiction to the clear Evidence of sence:
and I cannot make my self so much as doubt,
but that as 
Cato
 was wont to wonder how it
came that every one of the 
Heathen Priests
 did
not laugh when he saw another of the 
Trade,
 so
the 
Cardinals
 when they look on one another,
and a 
Pope
 even as Ignorant a one as the 
present
Pope
 is, when he receives the submissions that
are offered him by all who are of that 
Com∣munion,

must laugh within himself when he
sees how lucky that Imposture is, which has
subdued the World into so much respect for
him, and to so great a dependance on him.
A 
man
 who sees all these things upon the place,
and is of an Age capable of making solid
Reflections, and has a due portion of Lear∣ning,
must return amased, not so much at those
who being already under the 
Yoke,
 have nei∣ther
knowledge nor courage enough to shake
it off, nor at those who go into it because they
find their account in it, and so hope to have a
good share of the spoil, as at 
those
 who have
shaken off the Yoke, and have got into more

Liberty
 and more 
Knowledg,
 and feel the hap∣py
Influence of their deliverance even in their



Civil Liberties
 and other 
Temporal
 Concerns, if
they should ever come so much as to delibe∣rate
whether they ought to return and serve
their old and severe 
Masters,
 or not. For
my part, I speak freely to you, that I could
sooner bring my mind to believe that there
is no such thing as 
Instituted Religion;
 and
that it is enough for men to be just and honest,
civil and obliging, and to have a general re∣verence
for the 
Deity,
 than ever to think that
such 
Stuff
 as the 
men
 of the 
Mission
 would im∣pose
on the World can be true. Chiefly in
that part of it which relates to the 
Popes
Authority,
 after all that I have seen and
known.


You will perhaps think, that this is a long
digression, or at least a very improper intro∣duction
to that which I told you I would
offer to you, since the relation that all this
has with the matter of the 
Quietists,
 does not
appear to be so very proper. Yet you will
perhaps change your mind, when I tell you,
that the Miseries of 
Italy,
 that the Aversion
that all men of sense there have to the Ar∣tifices
of their 
Religion,
 and chiefly to the
conduct of the 
Regulars,
 and above all, of
the 
Iesuites,
 is believed the true reason that
led such numbers of 
men
 of all sorts to be
so favourable to 
Molinos:
 to which this was
rather to be ascribed, than to any Extraordi∣nary
Elevation of Piety or Devotion, of which


so little appears in that Country, that nothing
which touches only upon that Principle can
have great effects among them. Men that
are sick, turn to all sorts of remedies: and
those who are discontented, do naturally go
into every new thing that either promises re∣lief,
or that wounds those that displease them.
The present state of things in 
Italy
 being such
as I have described it, you need not wonder
to find so many ready to hearken after any
thing that seemed both 
new
 and 
safe.
 For
as the Novelty gave that curiosity which
might draw in many, so the safety that see∣med
to be in a Method of Devotion in
which so many of the Canonised 
Saints

had gone before them, and which appeared
at first authorised by the Approbation of so
many 
Inquisitours,
 made them apprehend
that there could be no danger in it. In the
recital that I am to give you, I do not pre∣tend
to tell you all the whole affair: nor
will I assure you of the truth of all that you
will find here. For in matters of this nature,
in which Interest and Passion are apt to
work so strongly, there are alwayes so ma∣ny
false Reports spread, and matters are so
often aggravated on the one hand, and dimini∣shed
or denied on the other, that I will not say
but there may be some things here that upon
a stricter inquiry will perhaps appear not to
be well founded; yet of this I will assure


you very positively, that I have Invented
and added nothing my self. I leave those
arts to the 
Italians,
 and the 
Court
 of 
Rome:

therefore I will tell you things nakedly
and simply, as I found them, without adding
so much as one Circumstance out of my
own Invention. I also made as much use
of my Judgment as was possible for me to do,
both in considering the Circumstances of those
with whom I talked on those heads, and the
things themselves that they said to me; so I let
pass all that seemed to be the effect of Pas∣sion
or Prejudice, and only marked down
that which seemed to be true, as well as that
which I had from men whom I had reason to
believe. My 
Informers
 were men of Pro∣bity
and of Sense; they were not indeed ea∣sily
brought to talk of this 
Subject,
 and they
spoke of it with great Reserves: so that
there may be many defects, and possibly
some mistakes in the account that I am to offer
you; yet you must be contented with it;
for it is all that I could gather; and it is
not corrupted with any mixture of my
own.


Michael de Molinos
 is a 
Spaniard,
 of a
good and Opulent Family. He entred into

Priests Ordors,
 but had never any Ecclesiasti∣cal

Benefice:
 so that he seemed to have dedi∣cated
himself to the service of the 
Church,

without designing any Advantage by it to


himself. He passes in 
Italy
 for a man both
of 
Learning
 and of good 
Sense.
 His course
of life has been exact, but he has never practi∣sed
those Austerities that are so much mag∣nified
in the 
Church
 of 
Rome,
 and among the
Religious 
Orders:
 and as he did not affect to
practise them, so he did not recommend
them to others; nor was he fond of those
poor 
Superstitions
 that are so much magni∣fied
by the trafficking men of that 
Church

But he gave in to the Method of the 
Mystical.
Divines,
 of which, since your studies have
not perhaps lien much that way, I shall give
you this short account.


That sublime, but mysterious way of 
De∣votion,

was not set out by any of the first

Writers
 of the 
Church;
 which is indeed a
great Prejudice against it: for how many
soever they may be, who have followed it in
the latter Ages, yet 
Cassians Collations,

which is a work of the midle of the 
fifth

Century, is the antientest Book that is writ
in that strain: for the pretended 
Denis
 the

Areopagite
 is now by the consent of all learned
men thought no Elder than the end of the
fifth or the beginning of the sixth Century.
Yet after these 
Books
 appeared, very few
followed the elevated strains that were in
them: the latter was indeed too dark to be
either well understood or much followed. So
that this way of 
Devotion,
 if it was practised


in 
Religious Houses,
 yet was not much set
out to the World before 
S. Bernards
 time,
whose melting strains, tho a little too much
laboured and affected, yet have something
in them that both touches and pleases: after
him many began to write in that sublime
strain; such as 
Thauler, Rusbrachius, Har∣phius,
Suso,
 but above all 
Thomas a Kempis.

And when for some considerable time that
way of 
writing
 was discontinued, it was again
raised up in the last Age, with much luster
by 
S. Teresa;
 and after her by 
Baltasar Alva∣res

a 
Iesuit:
 and as 
England
 produced a 
Car∣thusian

in King 
Henry
 the sixths time, one

Walter Hilton,
 who writ the 
Scale of Perfe∣ction,

a Book Inferior to none of these I
have cited, and more simple and natural than
most of them; so of late F. 
Cressy
 has published
out of F. 
Bakers
 Papers, who was a 
Benedi∣ctine,

a whole body of that method of 
Divini∣ty

and 
Devotion.
 The right notion of this
way of Devotion is somewhat hard to be
well understood, by those who have not stu∣died
their 
Metaphisicks,
 and is entangled
with too many of the terms of the School; yet
I shall give it to you as free of these as is
possible.


With relation to 
Devotion
 they consider a
man in 
three
 different degrees of Progress
and Improvement: the first is the 
Animal,

or the Imaginative state: in which the Im∣pressions


of 
Religion
 work strongly upon a
mans Fancy, and his sensitive Powers: this
state is but low and mean, and suteable to
the Age of a Child; and all the 
Devotion
 that
works this way, that raises a heat in the
Brain, tenderness in the Thoughts, that
draws Sighs and Tears, and that awakens ma∣ny
melting 
Imaginations,
 is of a low form, va∣riable,
and of no great force. The second
state is the 
Rational,
 in which those Refle∣ctions
that are made on Truths, which con∣vince
ones 
reason,
 carry one to all suteable
Acts: this they say is dry, and without mo∣tion:
it is a Force which the Reason puts
upon the Will, and tho upon a great Variety
of Motives, and many 
Meditations
 upon
them, the mind goes thro a great many
Performances of 
Devotion,
 yet this is still a
Force put upon the 
will.
 So they reckon
that the third and highest state is the 
Contem∣plative,

in which the 
Will
 is so united to
God, and overcome by that Union, that in
one single Act of 
Contemplation,
 it adores
God, it loves him, and resigns it self up to
him: and without wearying itself with a dry
multiplicity of 
Acts,
 it feels in one Act of Faith
more force than a whole day of Meditation
can produce. In this they say that a true 
Con∣templative
Man,
 feels a secret Ioy in God,
and an acquiescing in his Will; in which the
true elevation of 
Devotion
 lies; and which is


far above either the heats of 
Fancy,
 which ac∣company
the 
first
 state, or the Subtilty of 
Me∣ditation,

that belongs to the 
second
 state: and
they say, that the perfection of a 
Contemplative
state
 above the others, appears in this, that
wheras all men are not capable of forming
lively 
Imaginations,
 or of a fruitful Invention,
yet every man is capable of the simplicity of

contemplation:
 which is nothing 
but the silent
and humble adoration of God, that arises out of
a pure and quiet mind.
 But because all this
may appear a little Intricate, I shall illustratte
it by a similitude, which will make the diffe∣rence
of those 
three states
 more sensible; 1. A 
man

that sees the exteriour of 
another,
 with whom
he has no acquaintance, and is much taken
with his face, shape, quality, and meen,
and this has a blind prevention in his favour,
and a sort of a feeble kindness for him, may be
compared to him whose 
Devotion
 consists in
lively 
Imaginations,
 and tender Impressions
on his lower and sensible Powers: 2. A 
man

that upon an acquaintance with 
another,

sees a great many reasons to value and esteem,
both his parts and his Vertues, yet in all
this he feels no inward Charm that over∣comes
him, and knits his soul to the other;
so that how high soever the esteem may be, yet
it is cold and dry, and does not affect his
heart much, may be compared to one whose

Devotion
 consists in many Acts, and much



Meditation.
 But 3dly, when a 
man
 enters into
an entire friendship with 
another,
 then one
single Thought of his Friend, affects him more
tenderly, than all that variety of reflections,
which may arise in his mind, where this U∣nion
is not felt. And thus they explain the
sublime state of 
Contemplation.
 And they
reckon that all the common methods of 
De∣votion,

ought to be considered, only as steps
to raise men up to this state: when men rest
and continue in them, they are but dead and
lifeless Forms: and if they rise above them,
they become Cloggs and Hindrances, which
amuse them with many dry Performances,
in which those who are of a higher Dispen∣sation
will feel no pleasure nor advantage.
Therefore the use of the 
Rosary,
 the daily
repeating the 
Breviary,
 together with the
common 
Devotions
 to the 
Saints,
 are ge∣nerally
laid aside by those who rise up to the

Contemplative
 State; and the chief business to
which they apply themselves, is 
to keep their
Minds in an inward Calm and Quiet,
 that
so they may in silence form simple 
Acts
 of
Faith, and feel those 
inward Motions
 and

Directions
 which they believe follow all those
who rise up to this Elevation. But be∣cause
a man may be much deceived in those
Inspirations, therefore they recommend to
all who enter into this method, above all o∣ther
things, the choice of a 
Spiritual Guide,



who has a right sense and a true tast of those
matters, and is by Consequence a Competent
Judge in them.


This is all that I will lay before you in ge∣neral,
for giving you some tast of 
Mo∣linos's

Methods; and by this you will both
see why his 
Followers
 are called QUIE∣TISTS
and why his 
Book
 is Entitled 
il Gui.
da Spiritualc.
 But if you Intend to Inform
your self more particularly of this matter,
you must seek for it, either in the 
Authors

that I have already mentioned, or in those of
which I am to give you some account in the

equel of this Letter. 
Molinos
 having it
seems drunk in the principles of the 
Contem∣plative
Devotion
 in 
Spain,
 where the great
Veneration that is payed to S. 
Teresa
 gives
it much reputation, he brought over with
him to 
Italy
 a great Zeal for propagating it.
He came and setled at 
Rome,
 where he writ
his 
Book,
 and entred into a great commerce
with the 
men
 of the best Apprehensions, and
the most Elevated thoughts that he found
there. All that seemed to concur with him
in his design for setting on foot this sublimer
way, were not perhaps animated with the
same principles. Some designed sincerly to
elevate the World above those poor and trif∣ling

Superstitions,
 that are so much in vogue,
among all the 
Bigots
 of the Church of 
Rome,

but more particularly in 
Spain
 and 
Italy,
 and


which are so much set on by almost all the

Regulars,
 who seem to place 
Religion
 chiefly
in the exact performing of them. It was
thought that others entred into the design up∣on
more Indirect motives. Some perhaps from
the aversion that they bore the 
Regulars,
 were
disposed to entertain every thing that might
lead mens 
Devotions
 into other Channells, and
to a conduct different from that prescribed by

Friers
 and 
Iesuites.
 Some perhaps had under∣standings
good enough to see the necess
ty
of correcting many things in their Wor∣ship,
which yet they dur
t not attack as
simply unlawful: so that it might appear
more safe to expose these things to the Con∣tempt
of the World, by pretending to raise
men far above them: and thus they might have
hoped to have Introduced a 
Reformation
 of
many Abuses without seeming to do it. 
In
fine,
 some who seemed to enter into this mat∣ter,
were men that aspired to fame, and ho∣ped
by this means to raise a Name to them∣selves;
and to have a Party that should depend
upon them: for in such great numbers as see∣med
to imbark in this design, it is not to be
imagined that all were acted by the same mo∣tives,
and that every man had as good Inten∣tions
as it is probable 
Molinos
 himself
had.


In the year 1675. his 
Book
 was first pu∣blished
with 
five Approbations
 before it. One


of these was by the 
Archbishop
 of 
Rheggio;

another was by the 
General
 of the 
Franciscans,

who was likewise one of the 
Qualificators
 of
the 
Inquisition:
 another was by Fa. 
Martin de
Esparsa
 a Jesuit, that had been Divinity 
Pro∣fessor

both at 
Salamanca
 and at 
Rome;
 and was
at that time a 
Qualificator of the Inquisition.

As for the rest, I refer you to the 
Book
 it self.
The 
Book
 was no sooner printed, than it was
much read and highly esteemed both in 
Italy

and 
Spain.
 It was considered as a 
Book
 writ
with much Clearness and great simplicity; and
this so raised the Reputation of the 
Author,

that his Acquaintance came to be generally
much desired: those who were in the greatest
credit in 
Rome,
 seemed to value themselves
upon his friendship. 
Letters
 were writ to
him from all places: so that a correspondence
was setled between him and those who appro∣ved
of his 
method
 in many different places of

Europe.
 Some secular 
Priests
 both at 
Rome

and 
Naples
 declared themselves openly for it:
and consulted him as a sort of an Oracle upon
many occasions. But those who joyned them∣selves
to him with the greatest Heartiness and
Sincerity, were some of the 
Fathers
 of the 
Ora∣tory,

in particular 
three
 of the most Eminent
of them, who were all advanced at the last

promotion
 of Cardinals, 
Coloredi, Ciceri,
 but
above all 
Petrucci,
 who was accounted his

Timothy.
 Many of the 
Cardinals
 were also


observed to court his Acquaintance: and they
thought it no small Honour to be reckoned in
the number of 
Molinos's
 Friends. Such were

Cassanata Azolini
 and 
Carpegna;
 but above
all Card. 
d'Estrees.
 The last you must needs
know, is a man of great Learning: he was Am∣bitious
to be thought a 
Reformer
 of some of
those Abuses, which are among them, that
are too gross to pass upon a man of his freedom
of spirit; who had been bred up in the 
Sorbon,

and had conversed much with Mr. de 
Launay.

He therefore seemed the most zealous of all
others to advance 
Molinos's
 Design: so that he
entered into a very close commerce with him.
They were oft and long together: and not∣withstanding
all the distrust that a 
Spaniard

has naturally of a 
Frenchman,
 and that all
men have of one another, who have lived long
at 
Rome,
 yet 
Molinos,
 who was sincere and
plain-hearted, opened himself without reserve
to the 
Cardinal:
 and by his means a Corre∣spondence
was setled between 
Molinos
 and
some in 
France:
 for tho the spirits of those of
that 
Nation
 go generally too quick for a way
of 
Devotion,
 that was setled and silent, yet
some were strongly Inclined to favour it even
there. Perhaps it might be considered as a
method more like to gain upon 
Protestants,

and to facilitate the Design of the 
Re-union,

that was so long talked of there. All these
things concurred to raise 
Molinos's
 Cha∣racter,


and to render his person so considera∣ble.
When the 
Pope
 that now 
reigns,
 was ad∣vanced
to the 
Throne,
 which was, you know,
in the year 1676. that he took most particular
notice of him: and made it Visibly apparent,
that even in all that Exaltation, he thought
it might contribute to raise his 
Character,
 if
he were considered as a friend of 
Molinos's
 and
an Encourager of his Design: For he lodged
him in an Appartment of the 
Palace;
 and put
many singular Marks of his Esteem on him.
This made him become still the more Con∣spicuous,
when he had the advantage of 
Fa∣vour

joyned to his other Qualities: tho he nei∣ther
seemed to be fond of it, nor lifted up with
it. His Conversation was much desired; and
many 
Priests
 came not only to form them∣selves
according to his 
Method,
 but to dispose
all their Penetents to follow it: and it grew
to be so much in vogue in 
Rome,
 that all the

Nuns,
 except those who had 
Iesuites
 to their

Confessors,
 began to lay aside their 
Rosaries,
 and
other 
Devotions,
 and to give themselves much
to the practice of 
Mental prayer.
 This 
way
 had
more Credit given to it by the translation of a

French Book,
 that was writ upon the same
subject, which Cardinal 
d'Estrees
 ordered to
be made. It was writ in the form of a 
Dialogue,

and was printed in 
France
 in the year 1669. by
the 
Approbation
 of some of the Doctors of
the 
Sorbon.
 I am able to give you no other ac∣count


of the 
Author,
 but that in the 
Italian

Translation he is called 
Francis Malleva
la,

a blind Clergy-man. The 
Book
 being chiefly
formed upon the model of 
S. Terese,
 the
Translation of it was dedicated to the 
Discal∣ciate
Carmelites
 of her Order. This did not
contribute a little for raising the credit of

Molinos's Method,
 since it appeared to be ap∣proved
both in 
Italy, France
 and 
Spain.
 At
the same time 
Fa. Petrucci
 writ a great many

Letters
 and 
Treatises
 relating to a 
Contempla∣tive
Staete:
 yet he mixed in many of them,
so many Rules relating to the 
Devotions
 of
the 
Quire,
 that there was less occasion given
for censure in his 
Writings:
 They are a little
too tedious; but they were writ chiefly for

Nuns
 and others, that perhaps could not have
apprehended his meaning aright, if he had
expressed himself in a closer stile, and in sewer
words. Both the 
Iesuites
 and the 
Dominicans

began to be alarmed at the progress of 
Quie∣tism:

they saw clearly, that their trade was
in a decay, and must decay still more and
more, if some stop was not put to the pro∣gress
of this 
new Method:
 in order to this,
it was necessary to decry the 
Authors
 of it:
and because of all the Imputations in the
world 
Heresy
 is that, which makes the grea∣test▪
Impression at 
Rome, Molinos
 and his

Followers
 were given out to be 
Hereticks.
 It
being also necessary to fasten a particular


Name to every 
new Heresy,
 they branded
this with the Name of 
Quietism.
 Books were
also writ by some 
Iesuites
 against 
Molinos

and his Method; in which there appeared
much of that Sourness and Malignity that is
thought to be peculiar to the 
Society;
 they
were also writ with their usual candor and
sincerity. One of the Fathers 
Segueri
 took a
more dectrous Method to decry it. He be∣gan
his Book magnifying the 
Contemplative
State
 highly, as Superiour to all others;
and blaming those who had said any thing
that seemed to detract from it: yet he corre∣cted
all this, by saying, 
that very few were
capable of it;
 and 
that none ought to pretend to
it, but those who were called by God to so su∣blime
a State:
 and by this he seemed only to
censure the Indiscretion of those 
Spiritual
Guides,
 who proposed this way of 
Devotion

to all persons, without distinction. He also
believed, that such as were at some times
called to it, could not remain long in so high
a state, to which God called men rather for
some happy Minutes, than for a longer con∣tinuance:
therefore he thought that such per∣sons
as were raised to it, ought not to fancy
that they were now got so far above all their
former helps, as never to need them any more:
so he proposed to them the accustoming
themselves still to 
Meditation,
 and to support
themselves by that when they could not



contemplate.
 He censured severely some of

Molinos's
 expressions, such as that, 
He who
had God, had Christ;
 as if this were an aban∣doning
of Christs Humanity: he also insisted
much on that of 
a fixed looking on God,
 and
the 
suspending of all the Powers of the Soul:

but that on which he insisted most, was
the 
Molinos
 (whom he never named, tho
he cited his Words, and described him very
plainly) made the Quiet of 
Contemplation
 to
be a 
State
 to which a man could raise him∣self;
whereas he maintains, that in this Quiet
the 
Soul
 is 
passive,
 and as it were in a rapture;
and that she could not raise her self to it, but
that it was an Immediat and Extraordinary
Favour, which was only to be expected
from God, and which an humble mind could
not so much as ask of him.


These Disputes raised so much noise in

Rome,
 that the 
Inquisition
 took 
Notice
 of the
whole matter: 
Molinos
 and his 
Book,
 and

F. Petrucci's Treatises
 and 
Letters,
 were
brought under a second and severer Exami∣nation;
and here the 
Iesuites
 were considered
as the Accusers. It is true, one of the 
So∣ciety,

as was formerly told, had approved

Molinos
's Book; but they took care that he
should be no more seen at 
Rome:
 for he was
sent away, and it is not known whether, it is
generally believed that he is shut up within

Four Walls;
 but what truth soever may be in


that, he is no more visible, so careful are
they to have all their 
Order
 speak the same
Language; and if any speak in a different stile
from the rest, they at least take care that he
shall speak no more; yet in this 
Examen
 that
was made, both 
Molinos
 and 
Petrucci
 justi∣fied
themselves so well, that their Books
were again approved, and the Answers
which the 
Iesuites
 had writ, were censured
as scandalous: and in this matter 
Petrucci
 be∣haved
himself so signally well, that it raised
not only the Credit of the Cause, but his
own Reputation so much, that soon after
he was made 
Bishop
 of 
Iessi,
 which was a
new Declaration that the 
Pope
 made in their
Favours: their 
Books
 were now more esteemed
than ever, their Method was more followed,
and the Novelty of it, the opposition made to
it, by a 
Society
 that his rendred it self odious
to all the World, and the new 
Approbation

that was given to it after so vigorous an Ac∣cusation,
did all contribute to raise the Cre∣dit
and to encrease the Numbers of the Party.

F. Petrucci's
 behaviour in his 
Bishoprick,

contributed to raise his Reputation still
higher, so that his Enemy's were willing to
give him no more Disturbance; and indeed
there was less occasion given for Censure by
his 
Writings,
 than by 
Molino's
 little 
Book;

whose succinctness made that some Passages
were not so fully nor so cautiously expressed,


but that there was room for making Excep∣tions
to them: on the other hand, 
Petrucci

was rather excessively tedious, so that he had
so fully explained himself, that he very easily
cleared some small difficulties that were made
upon some of his 
Letters:
 In short, every body
was that thought either sincerely devout,
or that at least affected the Reputation of it,
came to be reckoned among the 
Quietists:

and if these persons were observed to become
more strict in their 
Lives,
 more retired and
serious in their mental 
Devotions,
 yet there
appeared less 
Zeal
 in their whole deportment
as to the exteriour parts of the 
Religion
 of
that 
Church.
 They were not so assiduous at

Mass,
 nor so earnest to procure 
Masses
 to be
said for their Friends: nor were they so fre∣quently
either at 
Confession
 or in 
Processions:

so that the Trade of those that live by these
things was sensibly sunk: and tho the new

Approbation
 that was given to 
Molinos's
Book
 by the 
Inquisition
 stopt the Mouths of
his Enemies, so that they could no more
complain of it, yet they did not cease to
scatter about Surmises of all that sort of men,
as of a 
Cabale,
 that would have dangerous
consequences; they remembred the story of
the 
Illuminated Men
 of 
Spain,
 and said, here
was a Spawn of the same Sect: they insinuated,
that they had ill Designs, and profound Se∣crets
among them; that these were in their


Hearts Enemies to the 
Christian Religion;
 and
that under a pretence of raising men to a
most sublime strain of 
Devotion,
 they in∣tended
to wear out of their minds the sense of
the Death and Sacrifice of 
Christ,
 and of the
other Mysteries of 
Christianity:
 and because

Molinos
 was by his birth a 
Spaniard,
 it has
been given out of late, that perhaps he was
descended of a 
Iewish
 or 
Mahometan
 Race,
and that he might carry in his Blood, or in his
first Education, some Seeds of those 
Religions,

which he has since cultivated, with no less
Art than Zeal: yet this last Calumny has gai∣ned
but little Credit at 
Rome;
 tho it is said,
that an Order has been sent to examine the
Registers of the Baptism, in the place of his
Birth, to see if his Name is to be found in it
or not.


Thus he saw himself attacked with great
vigour, and with an unrelenting Malice. He
took as much care as was possible to prevent,
or to shake off these Imputations; for he
writ a Treatise, of 
frequent and dayly Com∣munion,

which was likewise approved by
some of the most learned of the 
Regulars
 at

Rome,
 among whom one is 
Martinez
 a 
Ie∣suite,

the Senior 
Divinity Reader
 in their Col∣ledge
at 
Rome.
 This was printed with his

Spiritual Guide,
 in the year 1675. and in the

Preface
 he protests, that he had not writ it
with any design to engage himself into mat∣ters


of Controversy, but that it was drawn
from him, by the most earnest Solicitations
of some Zealous Persons. In it he pressed a

daily Communion,
 by a vast number of Pas∣sages
that he cited both out of the Ancient 
Fa∣thers,

and the 
Schoolmen;
 yet he qualified
this and all his other directions in the matters
of 
Devotion
 by that which he constantly re∣peats,
which is the necessity of being con∣ducted
in all things by a 
Spiritual Guide:
 whe∣ther
he intended to soften the aversion that
the 
Iesuites
 had to him, by refuting some
parts of Mr. 
Arnaud's
 famous Book of 
Fre∣quent
Communion
 or not, I cannot tell, but
in this Discourse he answers some of the Ob∣jections
that Mr. 
Arnaud
 had made to 
Fre∣quent
Communion,
 and in particular, to that
which he makes one main ground of restrai∣ning
men from it, which was the obliging
them to go thro with their Penitence and Mor∣tifications,
before they were admitted to the

Sacrament;
 whereas 
Molinos
 makes the
being free of 
Moral Sin,
 the only necessary
qualification. In this Discourse one sees more
of a heated Eloquence, than of severe or so∣lid
Reasoning: yet it presses the point of

daily Communion,
 and of 
an inward applica∣tion
of Soul to Iesus Christ, and to his Death,

so vehemently, that it might have been ho∣ped
that this should have put an end to those
Surmises, that had been thrown out to de∣fame


him; as if he had designed to lay aside
the Humanity of our Saviour, by his way
of 
Devotion:
 but there is no cure for Jea∣lousy;
especially when Malice and Interest
are at bottom: so new matter was found for
censure in this Discourse. He had asserted,
that there was no other Preparation necessary,
but to be free of 
Mortal Sin:
 so it was given
out, that he intended to lay aside 
Confession:

and tho he had advised the use of a 
Spiritual
Guide,
 in this, as well as in all other things;
yet the necessity of 
Confession
 before 
Commu∣nion,

was not expressed: so that by this peo∣ple
seemed to be set at Liberty from that Obli∣gation:
and it was said, that what he advised
with relation to a 
Spiritual Guide,
 lookt ra∣ther
like the taking some general Directions
and Council from ones 
Priest,
 than the co∣ming
alwayes to him as the 
Minister
 of the
Sacrament of 
Pennance
 before every 
Com∣munion;

and to support this Imputation, it
was said, that all of that 
Cabale
 had set
down this for a Rule, by which they con∣ducted
their Penitents, that they might come
to the Sacrament, when they found themselves
out of the state of 
Mortal sin,
 without going
at every time to 
Confession;
 but I will not in∣large
further upon the matters of 
Doctrine
 or

Devotion,
 in which you may think that I
have dwelt too long, for a man of my Bree∣ding
and Profession: and I should think so


my self, if I were not consining my self ex∣actly
to the 
Memorials
 and 
Informations
 that
I received at 
Rome.
 You will see by the 
Ar∣ticles

objected to the 
Quietists,
 and censured
by one of the 
Inquisition,
 which I send you
with this 
Letter,
 what are all the other
points that are laid to their charge. Only I
must advertise you of one thing, that their
Friends at 
Rome
 say, that a great many of
these 
Articles
 are only the Calumnies of their
Enemies, and that they are disowned by
them: but that they have fastned these things
on them, to render them odious, and to
make them suffer with the less Pitty: which
is the putting in practice the same Maximes
which we object to their Predecessors, who
condemned the 
Waldenses
 and 
Albigenses
 of a
great many Errors of which they alwayes
protested themselves Innocent: yet the Ac∣cusing
them of those horrid Opinions and
Practices, prevailed upon the Simplicity and
Credulity of the Age, to animate them with
all the Degrees of Rage against a Sect of men,
that were set forth as Monsters: the same
Maximes and Politicks are still imputed, and
perhaps not without reason to that severe
Court, which if you believe many has as
little regard to Justice as it has to Mercy.
Some have carried their Jealousies so far a∣gainst
the 
Quietists,
 as to compare their
Maxims to those of 
Socrates
 his 
School,
 and


his 
Followers
 after his death, when they saw
what his Freedom in speaking openly against
the establisht 
Religion
 had cost him: they re∣solved
to comply with the received Customs
in their exteriour, and not to communicate
their 
Philosophy
 to the Vulgar; nor even to
their Disciples, till they had prepared them
well to it, by training them long in the pre∣cepts
of 
Vertue,
 which they called the 
Pur∣gative
State:
 and when men were well tried
and exercised in this, then they communicated
to them their sublimer Secrets: the meaning
of all which was, in short, that they would
not discover their Opinions in those points
that were contrary to the received 
Religion,

and to the publick 
Rites
 to any, but to those
of whom they were well assured, that they
would not betray them: and therefore they
satisfied themselves with having true and just
notions of things; but they practised out∣wardly
as the Rabble did. They thought it
was no great matter what Opinions were en∣tertained
by them, and that none but 
men
 of

Noble
 and elevated Tempers deserved that
such sublime Truths should be communicated
to them, and that the herd of the 
Vulgar
 nei∣ther
were worthy nor capable of Truth,
which is too pure and too high a thing for such
mean and base minds. The Affinity of the
matter makes me remember a conversation
that I once had with one of the wittiest



Clergy-men
 of 
France,
 who is likewise estee∣med
one of the 
Learnedst Men
 in it; He said,

The World could not bear a Religion calculated
only for
 Philosophers: 
The people did not know
what it was to think▪ and to govern themselves by
the Impressions that abstracted thoughts made on
their minds: they must have outward things to
strike upon their senses and Imaginations, to a∣muse,
to terrify and to excite them: so
 legends,

dreadful
 stories 
and a pompous
 Worship 
were
necessary to make the Impressions of
 Religion 
go
deep into such course souls: for a Lancet,
 said
he, 
can open a vein, but an Axe must fell
down a Tree;
 so he concluded, 
that the
 Refor∣mation

had reduced the
 Christian Religion 
to
such severe terms, that among us it was only a

Religion 
for
 Philosophers: 
and since few were
capable of that strength of thought:
 he conclu∣ded,

that if the
 Church 
of
 Rome 
had perhaps
too much of this exteriour pomp, those of the
 Re∣formation

had stript it too much, and had not
left enough of garnishing, and of the bells and
feathers for amusing the rable.
 The speculation
seems pretty enough, if 
Religion
 were to be
considered only as a contrivance of ours, to be
fitted by us to the tempers and humours of

People;
 and not as a Body of 
Divine Truths,

that are conveyed to us from heaven.


Thus was 
Molinos's
 method censured or
approved in 
Rome,
 according to the different
Apprehensions and Interests of those that


made Reflections upon it. But the 
Iesuites
 fin∣ding
they were not so omnipotent in this 
Pon∣tificate,

as they have been formerly, resolved
to carry their point another 
way.
 I need not
tell you how great an Ascendant 
F. la Chaise

has gained over that 
Monarch,
 that has been
so long the 
terrour of Europe:
 and how much
all the 
Order
 is now in the Interests of 
France.

The 
Zeal
 with which that 
King
 has been extir∣pating

Heresy,
 Furnishes them with abun∣dance
of matter for high 
Panegyricks;
 since that
which in the opinion of many will pass down
to posterity, for the lasting reproach of a

Reign,
 which in its former parts has seemed
to approach even to 
Augustus's
 Glory, but
has received in this a stain, which with Indif∣ferent
men passes for a blind, poor-spirited and
furious 
Bigottry,
 and is represented by 
Prote∣stants

as a complication of as much Treachery
and Cruelty as the World ever saw; yet
among the 
bigots
 it is set forth as the brightest
side of that Glorious 
Reign:
 and therefore it has
been often cited by them with relation to the
cold correspondence that is observed to be be∣tween
the 
Courts
 of 
Rome,
 and that at 
Versailles,

that nothing was more Incongruous, than to
see the 
Head of the Church
 dispute so obsti∣natly
with its 
Eldest son
 such a trifle, as the mat∣ter
of the 
Regale,
 and that with so much ea∣gerness;
and that he shew'd so little regard
to so great a 
Monarch,
 that seemed to sacrifice


all his own 
Interests
 to those of his 
Religion▪

It is believed, that the 
Iesuits
 at 
Rome,
 propo∣sed
the matter of 
Molinos
 to 
F. la Chaise,
 as a fit
reproach to be made to the 
Pope,
 in that 
Kings

name, that while he himself was Imploying
all possible means to extirpate 
Heresy
 out of his

Dominions.
 The 
Pope
 was cherishing it in his
own 
Palace:
 and that while the 
Pope
 preten∣ded
to such an unyielding 
Zeal
 for the 
Rights

of the 
Church,
 he was entertaining a person
who was corrupting the 
doctrine,
 or at least
the 
devotion,
 of that 
Body,
 of which he had
the honour to be the 
Head.
 But here I must
add a thing which comes very uneasily from
me, and yet I cannot keep my word to you,
of giving you a faithful account of all that I
could learn of this matter at 
Rome,
 without
mentioning it. I do not pretend to affirm it
is true, for I only tell you what is believed at

Rome,
 and not what I believe my self, nor
what I would have you to believe; for I know
you have so high an esteem of Cardinal 
d'E∣strees,

that you will not easily believe any thing
that is to his Disadvantage. It is then said,
that 
he
 being commanded by the 
Orders
 that
were sent him from the 
Court
 of 
France,
 to
prosecute 
Molinos
 with all possible vigour, re∣solved
to sacrifice his old 
Friend,
 and all that
is sacred in 
Friendship,
 to the Passion he has for
His Masters 
Glory;
 finding then that there
was not matter enough for an Accusation


against 
Moliuos,
 he resolved to supply that
defect himself; so that he, who was once as
deep as any man alive in the whole Secret of
this Affair, went and Informed the 
Inquisition

of many particulars, for which tho there was
no other evidence but his Testimony, yet that
was sufficient to raise a great Storm against

Molinos;
 and upon this delation, 
he
 and a
few others of his friends were put in the 
Inqui∣sition;

but this was managed so secretly, that
all that is pretended to be known concerning
it, is, that upon a new Prosecution both 
Mo∣linos

and 
Petrucci
 were brought before the

Inquisition
 in 1684. 
Petrucci
 was soon absolved;
for there was so little objected to him, and he
answered that with so much Judgement and
Temper, that he was quickly dismissed; and
tho 
Molinos's
 matter was longer in agitation,
yet is was generally expected that he should
have been acquitted. In conclusion, a Corre∣spondence
held by him all 
Europe
 over, was
objected to him: but that could be no Crime,
unless the matter of that Correspondence
was Criminal: some suspitions papers were
found in his Chamber, but as he himself ex∣plained
them, nothing could be made out of
them, till Cardinal 
d'Estrees
 delivered a 
Let∣ter

and a 
Message
 from the 
King
 of 
France
 to
the 
Pope,
 as was formerly mentioned: and
that the 
Cardinal
 added, that he himself could
prove against 
Molinos,
 more than was ne∣cessary


to shew that he was guilty of 
Heresy.

The 
Pope
 said not a word to this, but left the
matter to the 
Inquisitors;
 and the 
Cardinal

went to them, and gave other senses of those
doubtful Passages, that were in 
Molinos's
Books
 and 
Papers,
 and pretended that he knew
from himself, what his true Meaning in them
was. The 
Cardinal
 owned, that he had lived
with him in the Appearances of Friendship:
but he said, he had early smelled out an ill de∣design
in all that matter; that he saw of what
dangerous consequence it was like to be; but
yet, that he might fully discover what was at
the bottom of it, he confessed, he seemed to
assent to several things, which he detested:
and that by this means he saw into their secret,
and knew all the steps they made, he still cau∣tiously
observing all that past among them till
it should be necessary for him to discover and
crush this Cabal. I need not tell you how
severely this is censured, by those who be∣live
it. I would rather hope, that it is not
true, how positively soever it may be affir∣med
at 
Rome;
 but tho it is hard to reconcile
such a way of proceeding with the common
rules of human Society and of Vertue, yet at

Rome
 a 
Zeal
 for the 
Faith,
 and against 
Heresie,

supersedes all the Bonds of 
Morality
 or 
Hu∣mainty,

which are only the common 
Vertues
 of

Heathens.


In short, what truth soever may be in this


particular, relating to the 
Cardinal,
 it is cer∣tain
that 
Molinos
 was clapt up by the 
Inquisi∣tion

in 
May
 1685. and so an end was put to all
Discourses relating to him: and in this silence
the business of the 
Quietists
 was laid to sleep,
till the ninth of 
February
 1687. that of a sudden
it broke out again in a much more surprising
manner.


The Count 
Vespiniani
 and his 
Lady,
 Don

Paulo Rocchi,
 Confessor to the Prince 
Borg∣hese,

and some of his family, with several
others, in all 70 
persons,
 were clapt up. Among
whom many were highly esteemed both for
their 
Learning
 & 
Piety.
 The things laid to the
charge of the 
Churchmen
 were their neglecting
to say their 
Breviary;
 and for the rest, they
were accused for their going to 
Communion

without a going at every time first to 
Confes∣sion:

and in a word, it was said, that they ne∣glected
all the exterior parts of their 
Religion,

and gave themselves up wholly to Solitude and

inward Prayer.
 The Countesse 
Vespiniani
 made
a great noise of this matter; for she said, she
had never revealed her 
Method
 of 
Devotion
 to
any Mortal, but to her 
Confessor,
 and so it
was not possible that it could come to their
knowledge any other way, but by his be∣traying
that 
Secret:
 and she said, it was time
for people to give over going to 
Confession,
 if

Priests
 made this use of it, to discover those
who trusted their 
secretest
 Thoughts to them;


and therefore she said, that in all time coming,
she would make her 
Confessions
 only to God.
This had got vent, and I heard it generally
talked up and down 
Rome:
 so the 
Inquisitors

thought it more fitting to dismiss 
Her
 and her

Husband,
 than to give any occasion to lessen
the credit of 
Confession;
 they were therefore
let out of prison, but they were bound to ap∣pear
whensoever they should be called upon.
I cannot express to you, the Consternation
that appeared both in 
Rome
 and in many other
parts of 
Italy,
 when in 
a months
 time about 200

persons
 were put in the 
Inquisition:
 and that
all of the sudden, a 
Method
 of 
Devotion,
 that
had passed up and down 
Italy
 for the highest
Elevation to which mortals could aspire, was
found to be 
Heretical,
 and that the chief
promoters of it were shut up in 
prison.


But the most surprising part of the whole
story, was, that the 
Pope
 himself came to be sus∣pected
as a favourer of this new 
Heresy:
 so
that on the 13th. of 
February
 some were de∣puted
by the 
Court
 of the 
Inquisition
 to exa∣min
him, not in the quality of 
Christs Vicar,

or 
St. Peters successor,
 but in the single quality
of 
Benedict Odescalchi:
 what passed in that
Audience, was too great a Secret for me to be
able to penetrate into it: but upon this there
were many and strange Discourses up and
down 
Rome:
 & while we 
Hereticks
 were upon
that asking, where was the 
Popes Infallibility?



I remember a very pretty 
Answer
 that was
made me. They said, the 
Popes Infallibility

did not flow from any thing that was Personal
in him, but from the care that Christ had of
his 
Church:
 for a 
Pope,
 said one, may be a

Heretick
 as he is a private man: but Christ,
who said to 
St. Peter, feed my sheep,
 will cer∣tainly
so order matters that the 
Pope
 shall never
decree 
Heresy,
 and by consequence shall never
give the flock 
Poyson
 instead of the 
Bread
 of

Life;
 while the 
Popes Heresy
 was only a perso∣nal
thing, it could have no other effect but to
damn himself: but if he decreed 
Heresy,
 this
corrupted the whole 
Church:
 and since Christ
had committed all the 
flock
 to the 
Popes
 care,
it ought to be believed, that he would never
suffer them to pronounce 
Heresy ex Cathedra,

as they call it. This had some colour in it,
that was plausible: but the shift of which ano∣ther
served himself, seemed Intolerable. He
said, the 
Pope
 could never decree 
Heresy:
 for
which he argued thus: he must be a 
Heretick
 be∣fore
he can decree it; and upon that he gave me
many Authorities to prove, that in the minute
that the 
Pope
 became 
a Heretick,
 he fell 
ipso
facto
 from his Dignity; and therefore he said,
the 
Pope
 could not decree 
Heresy;
 for he must
have fallen from his 
Chair,
 and have forfeited
his Authority, before he could possibly do it:
so that he was no more 
Pope.
 This lookt so
like a Juggle of the 
Schools,
 that I confess it


made no great Impression on me. Imagine
what a thing it would be, to see a 
King
 accused
of 
Treason
 by one of his own 
Courts;
 and then
you have fancied somewhat that comes near
this attempt of the 
Inquisition's:
 which being
a 
Court
 authorised by the 
Pope,
 yet had the
Boldness to examin himself: and it had cer∣tainly
been an odd piece of News, if upon the

Popes
 Answers, the 
Inquisition
 had stained him
with the Imputation of 
Heresy,
 and had lodged
him in the 
Minerva.
 Upon the discourse to
which this gave occasion, I have heard the
Authority of the 
Court
 of 
Inquisition
 magnified
to so Extravagant a degree, that some have
asserted, it was in some respects 
superiour

even to the 
Pope
 himself. Two days after
that, the 
Inquisition
 sent a Circular 
Letter
 to
Card. 
Cibo,
 as the chief 
Minister,
 to be sent
by him all about 
Italy,
 of which I send you a
Copy in 
Italian:
 for tho it ought to have been
writ in 
Latin,
 yet I do not know how it
came to be writ in 
Italian:
 for the writing it
in the Vulgar language, was censured not
only as an Indecent thing, but as that which
made the matter more publick; it was ad∣dressed
to all 
Prelats;
 and it warns them,
that wheras many 
Schools
 and 
Fraternities

were formed in several parts of 
Italy,
 in which
some persons, under a pretence of leading
people into the 
Wayes of the Spirit,
 and to the
prayer of 
quietness,
 they instilled in them many


abominable 
Heresies;
 therefore a stricte charge
was given to dissolve all these 
Societies:
 and
to oblige all the 
Spiritual Guides
 to tread in
the known Paths: and in particular, to take
care, that none of that sort should be suffered to
have the Direction of the 
Nunneries,
 Order
was likewise given to proceed in the way of
Justice against those who should be found
guilty of these abominable 
Errors.
 After this
a strict enquiry was made into all the 
Nunne∣ries

of Rome; for most of their 
Directors
 and

Confessours
 were found to be engaged into this
new 
Method.
 It was found that the 
Carmelites,

the 
Nuns
 of the 
Conception,
 of the 
Palestrina,

and 
Albano,
 were wholly given up to 
Prayer

and 
Contemplation,
 and that instead of their

Beads,
 and their 
Hours,
 and the other Devo∣tions
to 
Saints,
 or 
Images,
 they were much
alone, and oft in the Exercise of 
Mental
Prayer:
 and when they were asked, why they
had laid aside the use of their 
Beads,
 and their
antient 
Forms;
 their Answer was, that their

Directors
 had advised them, to wean them∣selves
from these things, as being but Rude
Beginnings, and Hindrances to their further
progress: they justified also their Practice
from those 
Books
 that had been lately publi∣shed
by the approbation of the 
Inquisitors

themselves, such as 
Molinos
 and 
Petrucci's

Books. When report was made of this mat∣ter
to the 
Inquisition,
 they sent Orders to take


out of the 
Nuns
 hands all those 
Boaks,
 and
such Forms of 
Devotion
 as were written in
that strain; and they required them to return
again to the use of their 
Beads,
 and their other
abandoned 
Forms,
 which was no small morti∣fication
to them. The Circular 
Letter
 pro∣duced
no great effects; for most of the 
Italian
Bishops
 were either extream unconcerned in
all those matters, or were Inclined to 
Molinos
's

Method:
 and whereas it was Intended, that
this as well as all the other 
Orders
 that come
from the 
Inquisition,
 should he kept secret,
yet it got abroad, and 
Copies
 of it were in all
peoples hands, so that this gave the 
Romans

the more occasion to discourse of these mat∣ters,
which troubled the 
Inquisitors
 ex∣treamly,
who love not to have the World
look into their Proceedings, nor to descant
upon them: they blamed Card. 
Cibo,
 as if
this matter was grown so publick by his means:
but he on the other hand blamed the 
Inquisi∣tors

for it, and his 
Secretary
 blamed both.
It was also said, that the 
Pope
 was not plea∣sed
with Card. 
Cibo's
 conduct, and that he
thought he had suffered this matter to go too
far, without giving a check to the 
Inquisi∣tors,

when it might have been more easily
done; wheras now matters are gone to
that height, that many think they cannot
end without some very great Scandal.
For the 
Quality
 of the 
Prisoners
 is considerable;


some of Cardinal 
Petrucci's Domesticks,
 and
both his 
Secretary
 and his 
Nephew
 were of
the Number; and tho the 
Cardinal
 himself
came to 
Rome
 soon after, yet he was there
for some time 
Incognito.
 It is generally belie∣ved,
that both he and the Cardinal 
Caraffa,

and Cardinal 
Ciceri,
 who is Bishop of 
Como,

are in great apprehensions of a storm from
the 
Inquisition:
 and the Ceremony of giving
them their 
Hats
 being so long delayed, was
generally ascribed to some complaints that
it seems the 
Inquisitors
 made; yet in Conclu∣sion
they appeared in 
Publick,
 and had there

Hats
 given them. The Duke of 
Ceri, Don
Livio,
 that is the 
Popes Nephew,
 is believed
to be deeply engaged in the matter: for the
Count 
Vespiniani,
 who was first seised on, is
his particular Friend and Favorite: and is a
sort of a Domestick of his. 
Don Livio
 him∣self
is likewise a person of a Melancholy
Temper, that is much retired; and this at
present is enough to make a man pass there
for a 
Quietist.
 He went from 
Rome
 to a
House he has not far from 
Civitavecchia,
 to
avoid, as was thought, the falling into the
hands of the 
Inquisitors.
 The 
Pope
 writ oft
for him, before he could prevail with him
to return; and it was said, that he did not
think himself secure even after all the Assu∣rances
that the 
Pope
 gave him, that no harm
should come to him; for it might be justly


enough apprehended, that the 
Inquisitors,

who had been so hardy as to examin the

Pope,
 would make no Ceremony with his

Nephew,
 if they found matter against him.


But among all that were clapt up, Father

Appiani
 was the man that surprised the 
Ro∣mans

the most: he was seised on the first Sun∣day
of 
April;
 he was esteemed the learnedest
and Eminentest 
Iesuite
 that was in the whole

Roman Colledge.
 This did not a little morti∣fie
the 
Society;
 one of their 
Fathers
 had
approved of 
Molinos
's Book, and now ano∣ther
was found to be engaged in this matter:
upon which a 
Priest,
 that was indeed no
Friend to their Order, said to me, 
that this
was their true Genius, to have men among them
of all sides;
 that so which side soever pre∣vailed,
they might have some among them,
that should have a considerable share in the
Honour of the Victorious. And thus if 
Mo∣linos
's
Method had been established, then
they would have gloried as much in 
Esparza

and 
Appiani,
 as they are now ashamed of
them. It is likely that they had not discovered

Appiani
's favouring the party, otherwise no
doubt they had been before-hand with the

Inquisition,
 and had shut him up as they did

Esparza;
 and so have covered themselves
from the reproach of having a man that fa∣voured

Heresy
 among them. But the Con∣fidence
of that 
Society
 is an Original; and since


I have this occasion to mention them, I will
here digress a little from the business of

Quietism,
 to give you account of some of their
Practices at 
Rome,
 with relation to 
English
Affairs,
 with which I was made acquainted
during my stay there.


There is a 
Iesuit
 belonging to the 
English

House, F. 
Cann,
 well known in 
England,
 by
some of his 
Writings,
 and in particular by
one against the 
Oath of Allegeance,
 in which
he pleads for the 
Popes
 Power of deposing

Princes;
 it seems he was sorry to see that the
Discourse which he had writ against the ta∣king
that 
Oath,
 had no better effect, and that
the 
Papists
 generally took it: so he resolved
to carry this matter further, therefore tho
he had no other Character but that of a 
Fa∣ther

of the 
Society;
 he proposed at 
Rome,
 that
a formal 
Oath,
 abjuring the 
Oath of Alle∣geance,

should be taken by all who had ta∣ken
the other; and that for all that should
be received to be 
Students
 in that House, in
all time coming, they should be bound by an

Oath
 never to swear the 
Oath of Allegeance:

since he said, a time might come, in which it
should be necessary for their Interests, that
they should be under no such tie to a 
Here∣tical
Prince:
 But because it was not safe for
them to enjoin any new 
Oath,
 without an
order from the 
Court
 of the 
Rota,
 according
to the Forms there, it was necessary to pre∣sent


a 
Memorial
 for this: and that ought to
come from the 
Protector of the Nation con∣cerned:

So he ought to have addressed him∣self
to Cardinal 
Howard;
 but the 
Cardinal
's
temper, and his principles, with relation to
Civil Obedience, were so well known, that
F. 
Cann
 thought to carry the business without
his having any share in it. Yet he found him∣self
mistaken; for the 
Iudges
 of the 
Rota
 were
surprised at the Proposition; and gave notice
of it to the 
Pope,
 who lookt upon it as a
thing of very bad consequence: and askt
Cardinal 
Howard,
 if it had been set on by
any direction from him; for it seems his Name
was made use of, tho without his know∣ledg.
The 
Cardinal
 was surprised at it, and
highly resented the Impudence of F. 
Cann:

He sent a Complaint of it to the 
General
 of
the 
Society,
 who, to give the 
Cardinal
 some
content, gave 
Cann
 a Reprimand, and sent
him out of 
Rome:
 But the 
Iesuites
 carry a
Grudge in their Hearts to the 
Cardinal
 for
this, and other things: and this appeared
very visibly during the Earl of 
Castlemain's

Embassay: for tho he lodged for some time in
the 
Cardinal's Palace,
 yet he gave himself up
so intirely to the Conduct of the 
Iesuites,

that the 
Cardinal
 was quite shut out of the
Councils: and while Fa. 
Morgan
 came at all
hours to the 
Ambassadour,
 even in his night
Gown and Shippers, which was thought


an unusual thing at 
Rome,
 where publick
persons live in an exactness of Ceremony:
once the 
Cardinal
 was made to wait in the
Antichamber, while the 
Father
 was within
entertaining the 
Ambassadour
 in this lasy
dress, who coming out in it, the 
Cardinal

was so provoked at this Indignity, that was
done him, and at the 
Iesuites
 Insolence, that
he threatned to sling him down stairs, if he
ever presumed to come within his House a∣gain
in that Habit: and indeed, a 
Cardinal

makes so great a figure in 
Rome,
 that such an
usage of him was thought a little Extraordi∣nary,
but the 
Cardinal
 is of so mild a temper,
and the 
Iesuites
 are so violent, as to be rec∣koned
the 
Horns of the Beast,
 that no won∣der
if a Sympathy of temper made the

Ambassador
 fall in more naturally with them.


But I will now return to the 
Quietists,

from whom, the particular regard that I hear
to the Order of the 
Iesuites,
 has diverted me
so long. The 
Prisons
 of the 
Holy Office
 were
full, and the Terrour of this matter had
struck so many, that no body could guess
when or where it should stop. It is said, that
the 
Inquisitours
 have found in some of their
Examinations, that they have to do with
men that are learneder than themselves: and
that their Prisoners are steady and resolute. It
is also said, that their Friends abroad have ex∣pressed
a great concern for them, and for


the cause of their Sufferings, and that many
Letters have been writ to the 
Inquisitors,

wishing them to consider well what they do
to their Prisoners; and assuring them, that
they will maintain their Interests: and that
they are ready to seal them with their Blood.
It is certain, the 
Pope
 and Cardinal 
Cibo
 are
much troubled, to see that this matter is
gone so far, and is now so much talked of.
Cardinal 
Petrucci
 is still much in the 
Popes

favour, and was suffered not long ago to go
visit 
Molinos,
 with whom he had a long con∣versation
all alone, but the subject and the
effects of it are not known: yet a severe Sen∣tence
is expected against 
Molinos.
 Those
that speak the mildest, think he will be a
Prisoner for life: but a little time will shew
more than I can presume to tell you. It is a
terrible thing to have the whole body of the

Regulars
 against one, who according to the
estimate that is made at 
Rome,
 are about
500000. Persons, and of that number it is
said the 
Iesuites
 make 40000. In the City of

Naples
 alone it is believed the 
Regulars
 and
other Ecclesiasticks amount to 25000. so it is
very likely, that when such Bodies, and 
Mo∣linos

are in the ballance, 
Cajaphas
's Resolution
may once more take place: 
It is expedient that
one man should die, rather than that those Nati∣ons
of Regulars should perish,
 or their Trade
and Profits be lessned. But to come to an end,


the 
Inquisitors
 have prepared the world for any
Judgments that they may pass in this matter,
by ordering one of their number, to draw up
a Censure of 19. Articles, which he pretends
to have collected out of the 
Writings
 and

Doctrines
 of the 
Quietists,
 and thus by repre∣senting
them so odiously, they have as much
as in them lies, prevented those Compassions
which may perhaps be kindled by the suffe∣rings
of those whom they may condemn as
guilty of those censured Opinions. I have
now given you all the Informations that I
could pick up of this matter, with all possi∣ble
sincerity; for I have represented this bu∣siness
to you, just as it was set before my self,
without making any Additions to it, or inter∣posing
my poor judgment in such a matter,
which I leave to you, and to such as you are.
I conclude, referring you for a further light
into this Affair to the Censure of the 
Inquisi∣tors,

which I procured in 
Italian,
 for tho pro∣bably
it is written Originally in 
Latin,
 yet I
could not get a Copy of the 
Latin
 Censure,
and so was forced to content my self with
this that follows. It appears by it, how low
the study both of 
Divinity
 and of the 
Scrip∣tures

is sunk at 
Rome:
 some few strictures
will be found on the Margin of the 
English
Translation
 of this 
Censur,
 which I have ad∣ded,
because some perhaps may desire to see
this, who do not understand 
Italian.

s'intenda con quelle provisionali, che ella sarà per
fare preclusa la via di procedere, anche per via di
giustitia: quando si scoprissero in qualche persona

ali errori non escusabili. In tanto si và quì digeren∣do
la materia, per poter à suo tempo auvertire il
Christianesimo degli errori da evitarsi.

THE
CIRCULAR LETTER,
Put in English


Most Eminent, or Most Reverend Lord:


THIS Holy 
Congregation,
 having re∣ceived
Advertisement, that there are some


in divers places of 
Italy,
 that by little and
little are erecting, or perhaps that have alrea∣dy
erected, some 
Schools, Companies, Frater∣nities,

or 
Assemblies,
 under some other De∣nomination,
either in 
Churches, Chappels,

or in private 
Houses,
 under the pretence of

Spiritual Conferences;
 and these consisting
either only of Women, or only of Men, or of
both Sexes together, in which some 
Spiritual
Guides,
 that are unacquainted with the true

way of the Spirit,
 in which the Saints have
trod, and that are perhaps men of ill designs,
do under the pretence of leading Souls by the

Prayer of Quietness,
 as they call it, or of 
Pure
Inward Faith,
 or under any other name, in
which tho in the beginning that they carry
men, by Maxims that are of the highest
perfection, yet at last they by certain principles,
that are ill understood, and worse practised,
do insensibly infuse into the minds of the sim∣ple,
divers grievous 
Errors,
 that do break
out into open 
Heresy,
 and to abominable
Practices, to the irreparable prejudice of those
Souls, who out of their single Zeal to serve
God well, put themselves in the hands of such
simple 
Directors,
 which is too notoriously
known to have fallen out in some places. In
consideration of all this, my most Eminent

Lords
 and 
Colleagues,
 the 
Inquisitors General,

have thought fit to signify this to you, by this
Circular 
Letter,
 which is sent to all the 
Or∣dinaries



of 
Italy,
 that so you may be pleased,
to watch over all such new Assemblies, that
are different from those that are practised and
approved in other 
Catholick
 places: and that
where you find any such, you abolish them
entirely, and suffer them not to be any further
advanced; and that you take care that 
Spiri∣tual
Directors
 shall tread in the 
beaten Paths
of Christian Perfection,
 without affecting any
Singularity in the 
Wayes of the Spirit:
 and that
above all other things, you take care, that no
person suspected of these Novelties, be suf∣fered
to thrust himself into the direction of

Nunneries,
 either by Word or Writing: that
so this Pest may not enter within those Houses;
which may too much corrupt the Spiritual In∣tention
of those 
Spouses
 of 
Christ.
 All this is
referred to your prudence: but with all this
provisional care, it is not to be understood as
if hereby the proceedings in the way of Justice,
were to be hindred, in case any persons are
found to hold inexcusable Errors. In the
mean while, care is taken so to digest this mat∣ter,
that 
Christendom
 may be in due time ad∣vertised
of those Errors that are to be avoided.

THE
CENSURE
OF THE
Opinions of the Quietists,
Prepared for the Inquisition.




Errori principali di quelli, che esercitano
l'Oratione di Quiete, co' le Risposte.


I. LA Contemplatione, o vero Oratione di Quie∣te
consiste in constituirsi alla presenza di Dio,
con un atto di Fede oscura, pura, & amorosa, e di∣poi
senza passar più avanti, e senza ammettere dis∣corso,
specie, ò pensiero alcuno, starsene cosi otio∣so;
par esser contrario alla riverenza dovuta à Dio il
replicare quel purissimo atto, il quale però è di tanto
merito, e vigore, che contiene in se, anzi supera
con gran vantaggio tutti insieme li meriti delle altre
virtù, e persevera tutt' il tempo della vita, mentre
non si ritratti con un atto contrario: Onde non è
necessario reiterarlo, e replicarlo.






CENSURA e RIS POSTA.


Niun' atto di Fede ci constituisse presenti à Dio,
il quale è dentro à noi per indispensabile necessità
della 
ua Immensit à, e però spesso dicevano Elia,
Michea, & altri Proseti: 
Vivit Deus in cujus conspectu∣sto.



E con Agostino dicono i Teologi: 
In Deo vi∣vimus,
movemur, & sumus.
 Dunque l'atto di Fede, per∣che
suppone l'estere della Creatura, suppone questa
già prima nella presenza di Dio, e solamente sará
rassegnatione di Spirito nelle braccie della Divinitá.
Intorno à questa all' hora sará contemplatione, quan∣do
l'Anima contemplarà, e non sarà otiosa, doppo
il primo atto di Fede oscura, pura, & amorosa. E
poifalfità evidente il dire, che non sono necessarii
altri buoni atti. L'Atto buono, per es
er finito, è
migliorabile, per mezzo della continuatione di simili
atti. Ne' la moltiplicatione di atti virtuosi e'con∣trario
alla riverenza dovuta à Dio, perche Iddio
non si tedia, ò impedisce, essendo libero da'ogni
passione, & in tanto non conviene replicare atti
riverentiali a' Maggiori del Mondo, in quanto, che
questi, secondo che porta l'esperienza, sono alterabili,
impedibili, ó tediabili della vista di simili atti fre∣quentati.
L'atto dunque in se stesso buono, molti∣plicato
sarà un buono maggiore, e però da' Dio ap∣provato,
a più rimunerabile, che un' atto solo.
Nella Contemplatione poi si stà in atto di operare, e
non ostinatamente sopra l'attopassato, essendo il
Contemplare l'operare mentalmente, ancorche altro
anco vi si richieda.






II. Senza la Contemplatione, per mezzo della
meditatione non può darsi un passo nella Perfet∣tione.






R
 Per meditarsi dal Christiano precisamente la
Passione di Christo, si riflette, che per amor dell'
Huomo tanto pati un Dio, unde può risolvarsi à ria∣marlo,
e volerlo obedire in che commanda, e met∣tere
in prattica (con la gratia di Dio, che sempre è in
Noi) tal santa deliberatione. Dunque permezzo della
Meditatione può bene incaminarsi l'Anima alla per∣fettione.
Anni senza contemplare, e senza meditare,


purche s'opri secondo li Leggi, con l'ajuto di Dio
fi puo ogn' uno salvare; non si salva poi chi non è
perfetto, & Amico di Dio. Dunque è falsissima
l'opinione contenuta nel secondo Capo.






III. La Scienza, e Dottrina anche Teologica, e
Sacra, è d'impedimento, e repugnanza alla Con∣templatione,
della quale non possono dar giuditio
gli Huomini Dotti, mà solo li Meditativi, e Con∣templativi.






R
 La Dottrina Teologica notifica stabili in noi
l'Oggetto della Contemplatione, che dicono i
Quietisti esser la Divina Essenza. Dunque in noi
è compinibile con la Contemplatione, alla quale
se la Teologia repugnasse l'istesso sarebbe esser
Contemplativo, e nulla saper d'Iddio Teologal∣mente,
e cosi Agostino, e gli altri Santi Dottori,
e Luminari della Chiesa, perche erano scientifici,
si doverebbero incapaci esser stati della Contem∣platione.
Il che è falso, imperoche Dio, che in∣stitui
il Sacerdotio, come Ministero il più degno,
non v'è ragione, che habbia voluto i Sacerdoti,
ma' che non fossero Contemplativi, già che volse
col Sacerdotio unita la Scienza, mentre nella Sa∣cra
Scrittura minaccio per Osea Profetta à chi di∣sprezzatore
della Scienza esercitava il Sacerdotio.

Tu repulisti scientiam, & ego repellam te, ne Sacerdotio
fungaris mihi.
 E tralascio altre Scritture, e raggioni,
perche mi viene incaricata la breuità. In quanto
poi al che si dice in questo 3. cap. che della Con∣templatione
non possono dar giuditio li Dotti, si
vede apertamente, che l'ignoranza di questi spi∣ritelli
senza intelligenza hà una temerità di non
volar soggiacere all' emenda, per mezzo dell' Infal∣libile
sentimento de' Scientifici.






IV. Non può darsi perfetta Contemplatione, se
non circa la sola Divinità. I Misteri dell' Incarna∣natione,


Vita, e Passione del nostro Salvatore non
sono oggetto di Contemplatione, anzi l'impedis∣cono,
onde devono dà Contemplativi tenersi lon∣tani;
ò solo considerarsi spregiatamente.






R
 Se la Contemplatione è un affettione dell'
Intelletto, e della Volontà con l'Ogetto, mediante
la gratia di Dio, in un raccoglimento di Spirito,
potrà la vita di Christo contemplarsi, perche à
quella il Christiano può farsi presente in Spirito, &
affettive con atto di Fede, & Amore. Aggiongo
che se Christo venne à piantar Paradisi in terra
per commissione dell' Eterno Padre, come disse
il Profeta Isaia, 
Posui verbum meum in ore tuo, ut
plantos Coelos, & fundes terram.
 Dove la Parafrase
Caldea cosi legge: 
Ut plantes Coelos in terra:
 Come
dire (si come l'intese Girolamo) che piantasse le
contentezze negli Huomini disgratiati per il pec∣cato
originale: E se i Contemplationi si portano
sopra se stessi alla Consolationi Divine nella loro
Contemplativi, perche si deve disprezzare, e te∣ner
lontano Christo, che è l'immediato Datore?
Christo non impedisce l'atto del Contemplatione
se ve
ne à compartirci perfettioni, e contenti
spirituali, che sono il fine de' Contemplativi.






V. Le Penitenze corporali, l'austerità della vita
non convengono alli Contemplativi, anzi meglio
si comincia la conversione dalla vita contemplati∣va,
che dalla Purgativa, e dalle Penitenze. An∣cora
gli effetti della Divotione sensioile, la tene∣rezza
del Cuore, le Lagrime, e Consolationi spiri∣tuali
si devono fuggire, anzi dispreggiare da' Con∣templativi,
come cose repugnanti alla Contempla∣tione.






R.
 Le Mortificationi dispongono lo Spirito, ac∣ciò
viva sopra le motioni del senso, e perciò tutti i
santi cominciarono à viaggiare verso la Perfettione


con discipline, Digiuni, &c. Dunque se i Con∣templativi
hanno per fine anco la perfettione, ben
li convengono le Penitenze, perche più spedito si
renda alla Contemplatione, chi più tiene domate
le alterationi del senso. E se Dio promette nelle
Scritture pardonar al Peccatore piante, che saran∣no
dà lui le colpe, mà in nessun luogo del vec∣chio,
ò nuovo Testamento, per essersi posto nella
Contemplatione. Dunque meglio si comincia la
conversione dalla vita purgativa, e dalle Penitenze,
che dalla contemplatione.






VI. La vera Contemplatione deve fermarsi nel∣la
pura Essenza d'Iddio, spogliata delle Persone, e
degli Attributi, e l'Atto di Fede di Dio cosi conce∣pito,
è più perfetto, e meritorio di quello, che ri∣guarda
Dio con le Persone, & Attributi.






R.
 Le Persone Divine, egli adorabili Attributi
di Dio hanno la raggione formale d'esser Oggetti
di Fede, ed'Amore nel racoglimento delle nostre
potenze, e nella rassegnatione dello Spirito, per∣che
sono verità rivelate, e come Predicati Divini
suoni buoni in se stessi, & alle Creature. Donde può
darsene vera contemplatione. Che poi l'atto di
Fede di Dio senza le Persone, & Attributi conce∣pito
sia più perfetto, e meritorio di quello, che ri∣guarda
Dio con le Persone, & attributi è falsità.
Perche se già il credere che Dio sia Trino, e sia
giusto è atto di fede perfetto, e meritorio, e cre∣dere
Dio vero nell' Essenza anco è atto meritorio
e perfetto, sarà l'atto con cui si crede Dio vero
erino, e giusto, più perfetto, e meritorio d'un
altro atto, con cui solamente si crede uno nell'
Essenza, perche si merita più per due atti dell'
istessa virtù, che per un solo di questi. (Havendoci
Dio communicate le virtù supranaturali non per
sar un atto solo virtuoso, mà per avanzarsi col' eser∣citio



li tali doni) Un' atto di fede, che equivale 

due è più meritorio, e perfetto di un solo atto delli
due: onde ben si conclude contra la prima pro∣positione
di questo 6. Cap. che la vera, e perfetta
contemplatione per essere megliore deve fermarsi
nella pura Essenza di Dio, mà questa nella Persone,
e negli Attributi.






VII. Nella Contemplatione s'unisee l'Anima
immediatamente con Dio, onde non vi si richiedè
Fantasmi, ò Imagini, ò specie di sorte alcuna.






R.
 Nella Contemplatione ancorche in un certo
modo s'unisca l'Anima immediatamente con Dio,
cio è effettiye, perche vi concorre l'intelletto a mi∣rar
Dio semplicemente, però si richiede qualche
specie per sollicitare l'intellettuale habilità natura∣le
à portarsi nella consideratione di Dio, servendo
la specie per oggetto mottivo all' Intelletto.






VIII. Tutti i Contemplativi nell' atto della
Contemplatione patiscono pene, & angoscie si gra∣vi,
che pareggiano, anzi superano, li tormenti dell

istessi Martiri.






R.
 Se (come dicono i Quietisti nel primo capo)
la Contemplatione consiste nel farsi presente à Dio
con un atto di Fede amorosa, e poi starsene in
otio, non è formalmente essere tormentato, e
patire pene più delli Martiri. E quantunque ad al∣cuno
spesso succeda nella Contemplatione ango∣scie,
e dolori, ciò proviene da' altra causa ò dal
Demonio, permettendolo Dio, ò da' fiachezza
di natura, che consuma il Corpo, ò da' motivi di
Malenconia, ò da' soverchio sangue, che sormon∣tato
alla testa caggiona dolore. Mà moltissimi al∣tri
si sono visti nell' atto della Contemplatione,
circondati di luce con fronte serena, é bocca ri∣dente,
come Francesco di Paola fu osservato dà
Luiggi XI. Ré di Francia, e finita la Contempla∣tione


restar tutti inondati di allegrezza, perche in
quella vennero à vista (semplicemente ben si) li
sposi, per restar concertato il Matrimonio frà Dio e
l'Anima.






IX. Nel Sagrificio della Messa, e nelle Feste
de' Santi, è meglio applicarsi all' atto di pura fe∣de,
e Contemplatione, che alli Misteri di esso
Sacrificio, ò à considerare le attioni, ele cose ap∣tenenti
alli medesimi Santi.






R.
 Vive ingannato chi giudica entrare nella
Contemplatione senza buona dispositione dell' A∣nima;
e perche la consideratione delli Mister
 del∣la
Messa, e dell'esempio de' Santi è preparamento
spirituale, ancorche remoto, perciò stimarsi deve
meglio, prima applicarsi il Christiano alla conside∣ratione
de i Misteri della Messa, e delle attioni de'
Santi, e poscia darsi alla Contemplatione con più
Adobbo nell' Anima.






X. La Lettione spirituale de' libri, le Prediche,
l'Orationi vocali, l'Invocationi de'Santi, e cose si∣mili,
sono d'impedimento alla Contemplatione,
overo Oratione di Quiete, alla quale non si deve
premettere preparatione alcuna.






R.
 Se in ogni professione, e' maggiormente in
quella della vera, e non fintionata spiritualità:

Nemo repente sit summus,
 come l'esperienza dimo∣stra,
perche è ordine della nostra fiacca natura,
co' cui si và accommodando la gratia per il nostro
camino all' ultimo termine dell' Eternità, che à

facilioribus sit incipiendum;
 che perciò è grand' igno∣ranza,
e presontione entrare nell' Oratione di
Quiete, prima d'altri esercitii, e senza preparatione.
Chi cosi entra, uscirà ancora senz' aleun profitto.






XI. Il Sacramento della Penitenza, avanti la
Communione non è per l'Anime interiori, e con∣templative,
mà per l'esteriori, e meditative.







R. I contemplativi hanno solamente un' Anima
che è può meditare, e può contemplare, & anco
può star in peccato. Dunque il Sacramento della
Penitenza prima della S. Communione, è necessa∣rio
all' Anime contemplative.






XII. La Meditatione non riguarda Dio col lu∣me
della Fede, mà con il lume naturale in Spirito
e verità, e però non hà merito appresso Dio.






R.
 Se la meditatione non fosse meritoria appres∣so
Dio, 
(saltem aliqualiter de congruo)
 no' sarebbe
cosi famigliare alle Religioni, dove furono, e
sono grand' Huomini fanali della S. C. R. ne sa∣rebbe
incaricata da' SS. Patriarchi, e da' Sommi
Pontefici rimunerata con Indulgenze plenarie, co∣me
esercitio spirituale, proportionato alli Amici di
Dio, & à quelli, che abandonano le fallacie del
mondo. Di Dio, come si può conoscere l'esistenza
col lume naturale, e con la fede sopranaturale, cosi
può darsi Meditatione che lo riguardi naturalmen∣te,
e Meditatione che lo riguardi con fede pura, e
sopranaturale.






XIII. L'Imagini non solo interne, e mentali,
mà anco l'esterne solite venerarsi da' fedeli, come
sono quelle di Christo, e de' suoi Santi, sono dan∣nose
a' Contemplativi, onde devono fuggirsi, e to∣glier
via, accio non impediscano la Contempla∣tione.






R.
 Quanto decretò, e decretarà la S. Madre
Chiesa, à cui presiede Direttore lo Spirito Santo
tutto giovevole all' Vassallaggio di Christo; però se
a' Fedeli la Chiesa ordina l'adorationi delle SS. Im∣magini,
non devono queste s
uggirsi, ò toglier
via, come nocive alla Contemplatione: nulladi∣meno
alcuni sguardi alla sfuggita verso dette Im∣magini
non sono valevoli à far perdere la Contem∣platione,
overo Oratione di Quiete al Contem∣plativo,


quale se in ogni caso la perde, proviene
dalla sua troppa imbecillità, e per altro poi e più
ampia l'Anima raggionevole; e maggine la gra∣tia,
che l'assiste di quello che suppone queste
13. Cap. Anzi la moderata consideratione di dette
Imagini serve à formar nell' Anima l'interno ra∣coglimento,
perche il contemplativo si faccia rego∣lare
dalla Gratia.






XIV. Chi una volta si è applicato alla Contem∣platione
non deve piu ritornare alla Meditatio∣ne,
perche sarebbe un passare dal meglio al peg∣gio.






R.
 E vero che è cosa mala passare dal meglio al
peggio, mà spesso conviene non possedendo attual∣mente
it meglio incaminarsi à posseder il buono.
E vero ancora, che essendo pontualmente nella
Contemplatione, non si deve lacciar questa à fine di
mettarsi nella Meditatione. Ancorche la Contem∣platione
sia migliore, non ritrovandosi il Christiano
attualmente nella Contemplatione, non opera in∣convenientemente
applicandosi à meditare, perche
conviene, che per ogni via, che Dio si può mira∣re
dall' Anima, sia da questa riverentemente esse∣quiata.






XV. Se nel tempo della Contemplatione vengo∣no
pensieribrutti, & osceni, non si deve usar dili∣genza
alcuna in scacicarli, no' riccorrer ad alcu uno
buon pensiero, mà compiacersi di essere da' quelli
molestato.






R.
 Per non perdersi l'unione effettiva con Dio,
che nella formale contemplatione si trova, è atto di
prudenza toglier via l'occasione, come è atto di scio∣peraggine
il trattenersi con compiacenza, perche
come dice S. Tomaso d'Aquino, 
qui vult causam, ex
quanecessariò, vel regulariter sequitur affectus, vult vir∣tualiter
effectum,
 E lo Spirito Santo. 
Qui amat peri∣culum


peribit in illo.
 Dunque sentendo in noi la re∣bellione
del senso nella Contemplatione, ancorche
fidati in noi stessi, dobbiamo usar ogni diligenza
per superarla. Dovemo però raccommandarci alla
Divinità, e chieder la sua gratia, per tranquillare i
mali pensieri, diffondere le sue gioie nell' Anima,
incalmare i sensi alterati, 
& ut sint aspera in vias
planas.






XVI. Niun' atto ò affetto nostro interno, benche
formato per mezzo della fede, e puro, ne piace a'
Dio, perche nasce dall' Amor proprio, mentre
non vi sia infuso dallo Spirito Santo, sensa nostra
industria, e diligenza alcuna, onde quelli, che stan∣no
nella Contemplatione ò in Oratione d'affetti,
devono stare otiosi, ò aspettando l'influsso dello
Spirito Santo.






R.
 A Dio solamente piacciono i' suoi Doni, mà
tutte quelle nostre Operationi, che da' Noi si fanno
con la sua Santa Gratia. Quindi tanto pier, pro∣fetta
sara' la Contemplatione, quanto meno sarà
otiosa, purche il Contemplatore non si lasci da' qual∣che
sensibile trasportare, preche perderia la Con∣templatione,
e gli succederabbe come alla Moglie
di Loth, che per mirar indietro perse il Camino.
E poi temerità aspettarè in otiosità l'influsso miraco∣sa'
dallo Spirito Santo, perche a' quei, che sono
nell' Oratione di Quiete non si deve il camino pas∣sivo,
mentre non hanno condegnità sopra i doni
della Spirito Santo. Bensi succede alle volte che
lo Spirito penetri l' Anima di chi stà nell' Oratione
d'affetti, mà per gratia particolare. Aggiongo con∣tro
la prima propositione di questo 16. capo. Li Quie∣tisti
dicono nel 12. capo che la Meditatione non hà
merito appresso Dio, perche non lo riguarda col
lume della fede, dunque l'atto formato per mezzo
della fede hà merito appresso Dio, dunque è puro,
e gli piace.







XVII. Quelli che stanno nell' atto della Contem∣platione,
ò dell' Oratione di Quiete, ò siano Per∣sone
Religiose, ò figli di famiglia, ò altri, che vi∣vono
sotto l'altrui commando, non devono in quel
tempo obedire & eseguire gli ordini della Regola,
ò de' superiori, per non interrompere la Contem∣platione.






R.
 La contemplatione ancorche sia in noi di gran
perfettione, perche non ci viene commandata da'
Dio, interrompendosi non si pecca, mà essendoci
commandata da' Dio l'Obedienza a' Genitori, & à
superiori, si deve obedire a' questi, anco con 
las∣ciare
l'attual Contemplatione, perche in riguardo
dell' ordine divino l'obedienza è preferibile nella
prattica, ancorche la Contemplatione sia mol∣to
più considerabile nella sua perfettione objettiva.






XVIII. Devono i Contemplativi esser total∣mente
spogliati dell' affetto di tutte le Cose, che ri∣gettino
a' se, e dispreggino li Doni, e favori di
Dio, e si disaffettionino dell' istessa virtù, ò per
maggiormente spogliarsi d'ogni cosa, e viver meglio
a'
se medisimi, fare ancora quello, che ripugno
alla modestia, & all' Honestà, purche non
sia espressamente contro liprecetti del Decalogo.






R.
 Iddio favorisce i Contemplativi con la Com∣municatione
de' suoi boni, non per essere questi
disprezzati, mà per abbellirgli l'Anima, e fortifi∣cargli
l'habilità naturale all' esercitio della virtù.
Dvnque ancorche i Contemplativi non se ne debba∣no
insuperbire, devono sopramodo stimarli, ò ser∣virsene
con humiltà di spirito: E se Dio vuole l'ho∣nestà
come buona, sono in obligo anche i Contem∣plativi
esser honesti, perche Iddio non hà fatto de∣creto,
che privilegiasse i Contemplativi à non esser
sogetti alla raggione, su là quale si fonde la Mode∣stia,
e l' honestà della Vita.







XIX. Li Contemplativi sono sogetti alle Violen∣ze,
per le quali restano privi dell' uso del libero ar∣bitrio,
si che se anco bene gravissimamente pecca∣no
esteriormente, nondimeno interiormente non
fanno peccato alcuno; onde ne anco devono Con∣fessarsi
di ció, che hanno fatto. Ciò si prova con l'e∣sempio
di Giob, il quale con tutto che non solo
ingiuriasse il Prossimo, mà anco bestemmiasse em∣piamente
Dio, in ogni modo non peccava, perche
tutto questo faceva per violenza del Demonio. E
per dar giuditio di queste violenze, non serve la
Teologia Scolastica, e morale, mà è necessario
Spirito sopranaturale, il quale in pocchissimi si
trova, & in questi s'hà dà giudicare non l'interno
dall' esterno, mà l'esterno dall' interno.






R.
 Che in questo Cap. 19. non solamente 
latet
Anguis sub herha,
 mà apertamente si vede, che
sotto nome di Contemplativi spirituali, vogliono
i Quietisti essere debacanti sensuali. L'esempio,
che adducono di Giob ben dimostra che no' hanno
intelligenza della Scrittura. Mai Giob peccò este∣riormente
nè contro il Prossimo, nè contro Dio,
quando parlò nel cap. 19. nel 6. vorso, come ben
dimonstra, anco per mezzo del senso litterale Pi∣neda
tom. 11. sopra Giob c. 35. nè peccò contro
il Prossimo, come nell' istesso può vedersi, sempre
fondata su la Dottrina de' SS, Padri, che delle
Scritture, e insegnano il vero senso. E per dirla in
poche parole con altre raggioni, la gratia con la
quale Iddio sempre ci assiste, unita con la nostra
cooperatione può superare ogni assalto nemico. E
Christo lo disse à t
tti in persona di S. Paolo: 
Suffi∣cit
tibi gratia mea.
 Dunque il Contemplativo non e
violentabile de venghi necessitato al peccato este∣
iori,
&c.










THE
PRINCIPAL ERRORS.
Of those who Practise,
The Prayer of Quietness,
Censured and Refuted.




I. ERROR.


COntemplation, 
or
 the prayer of Inward
quietness, 
consists in this,
 that a man puts

imself in the presence of God, by forming an

bscure Act of Faith, full of Love, tho simple,
and stops there, without going further: and
without suffering any Reasoning, the Images
of any things, or any Object whatsoever to

nter into his mind: and so remains fixed and

nmoveable, in his Act of Faith: it being a

ant in that Reverence that is due to God,

o redouble this simple act of his: which is a

hing of so much Merit, and of so great force,

hat it comprehends within it self, and far ex∣
eeds
the merit of all other vertues, joyned

ogether: and it lasts the whole course of a mans


life, if it is not discontinued by some other Act,
that is contrary to it; therefore it is not ne∣cessary
to repeat or redouble it.






The CENSURE and REFUTATION.


It is not an Act of Faith that puts us in the
Presence of God: for he is within us by a
necessary effect of the Immensity of his na∣ture:
therefore 
Elias, Micaiah,
 and the other
Prophets said, 
Vivit Deus in cujus conspecto
sto. The Lord lives in whose presence I stand:

and it is upon the same reason that the Di∣vines
have said after S. Austin, 
In Deo vivi∣mus
movemur & sumus; In
God we live, we move, and
have our being:
 so that an Act
of Faith, that presupposes
that the Agent is in being,
supposes likewise that it is in
the presence of God; & is in∣deed
nothing else but a Re∣signation
that the Creature
makes of it self to God.
Therefore 
Contemplation,

even during that first ob∣scure
Act of Faith, that i

simple and full of love, is car∣ried
on by the Soul while
she looks at God, and not
at all while she continues
in an unmoveable state. It is then an Evident
Falsehood to say, that other good actions are


not at all necessary: any good act being of its
nature finite, may become alwayes better, by
being often reiterated, and the multiplying the
Acts of vertue cannot be contrary to the Re∣verence
that is due to God, who being exempt
from all passion, can never be troubled or
wearied with Importunities, as great men
are apt to be, who as Experience teaches,
are often changed, disturbed, and be∣come
uneasy, when the same things are too
often repeated to them. But with relation
to God, when an act is in it self good, the re∣peating
it is a progress in good; which is ap∣proved
of God, and becomes more merito∣rious
in his sight. Therefore the Soul in Con∣templating,
continues her Acts, and does
not stick obstinatly to one single Act, 
Con∣templation

being still an Operation of the
Mind, tho other things are likewise neces∣sary.






II. ERROR.


One cannot make one step towards Perfe∣ction
by meditation, that being to be obtained
entirely by Contemplation.






REFUTATION.


A Christian by meditating seriously on the
Passion of Christ, and teflecting on that Love
that made a God suffer so much for Mankind,
may upon that resolve to love him again, and
to obey all his Commands: and he may by the
grace of God which is ever present to us, put


those good purposes in Execution: so that the
Soul may well advance towards Perfection by
Meditation: It may be also done without Me∣ditation:
for every one that lives according
to the Laws of God, may work out his
own Salvation by the help of God. Now
since no man can be saved but he that is Perfect,
and a Friend of God's, then this 
Article
 is most
certainly false.






III. ERROR.


All Study and Learning, even in sacred
Matters and in Divinity, is a Hindrance to
Contemplation: of which learned men are not a∣ble
to make a true judgment, that being only to
be expected from those that are given to Medi∣tation
and Contemplation.






REFUTATION.


The Study of 
Divinity
 makes known to us
the Object of 
Contempla∣tion:

which as the 
Quietists

say, is the 
Divine Essence:

therfore it consists well with

Contemplation:
 and if the
Study of Divinity were op∣posit
to this, then the igno∣rance
of it is necessary to
make a man Contempla∣tive:
and thus since 
S. Austin
 and all the other
holy Doctors and Lights of the Church, were
men Learned in this study, they must be looked
on as men that were Incapable of rising up to


Contemplation: which is false: because God,
who has appointed the Priesthood as the highest
degree of service done him, cannot be suppo∣sed
to have Intended that the Priests should not
be Contemplative persons; and it is plain,
that God will have his Priests to be knowing:
since in the Scriptures he threatens by 
Hosea

the Prophet such as despised knowledg, and yet
were in the Priesthood. 
Turepulisti scientiam
& egorcpellam te ne sacerdotio fungaris. Thou
hast rejected knowledg, and therefore I have re∣jected
thee from the Priesthood.
 I pass over other
Arguments from scripture and reason, be∣cause
I am ordered to be short: and as for
what is said in this 
Article,
 that the 
Learned
cannot Iudge of Contemplation,
 it shewes
plainly, that the Ignorance of those spiritua∣lists
carries them to this boldness, of not
being willing to submit to that Correction,
which they might expect
from that Infallible mean of
the Judgment of the Lear∣ned.






IV. ERROR.


There is no Contemplation that is perfect,
but that which regards God himself; the My∣steries
of the Incarnation, and of the Life and
Passion of our Saviour, are not the Objects of
Contemplation: on the contrary, they hinder
it: so that Contemplative persons must avoid


them at a great distance, and think of them
only with Contempt.






REFUTATION.


If Contemplation is an affection that is
raised in the understanding or the Will by its
proper object by the help of the Grace of
God, and that consists in an Inward Re∣collection
of the mind, then the Life of Christ
is a proper Object for it, since a Christian
can present this to his thoughts, and raise
upon it an Act of Faith and love. Besides,
Christ came by a Commis∣sion
from his Eternal Father
to plant Paradise here on
earth,
 according to that of
the Prophet Isaias, 
Posui ver∣bum
meum in ore tuo ut plantes
Coelos & fundes terram; I
have put my word in thy mouth
that thou may plant the Heavens
and establish the earth; or
 as
the Chaldee Paraphrase hath
it, 
ut plantes Coelos in terra,
that thou may plant the Heavens in the Earth;

as if he had said (as 
S. Ierome
 understood
the words) that thou may plant true joy in
those minds, that were debased by Origi∣nal
sin; and how can it be imagined, that
Contemplative persons can rise above them∣selves
in their Contemplations to tast of Di∣vine
Joy's, if they must keep at such a di∣stance


from Jesus Christ, who is the Imme∣diat
giver of them; and despise him? Christ
is so far from hindring of Contemplation,
that he came into the world to distribute all
those Perfections and spiritual Joys to which
the Contemplative aspire.






V. ERROR.


Corporal Penitences and Austerities do not
belong to Contemplative Persons: on the Con∣trary,
it is better to begin ones Conversion by a
state of Contemplation, than by a State of Pur∣gation
or of Pennance; and Contemplative
Persons ought to avoid and despise all the effects
of sensible Devotion, such as Tenderness of Heart,
Tears, and Spiritual Consolations, all which
are contrary to Contemplation.






REFUTATION.


Mortifications dispose the Spirit to rise
above the motions of sense; and therefore it
is that all the Saints have begun their course
towards Perfection with Fasting and Disci∣pline.
And therefore if these Contempla∣tives
design Perfection, they must practice
Pennance: since nothing renders a man so fit
for Contemplation, as to rise above all the
Disorders of Sense. God in the Sciptures pro∣mises
to forgive the mourning Sinner; but
this is not promised to the Contemplative
in any place either of the Old or New Testa∣ment.
Therefore it is better to begin ones


Conversion with purgative Exercises and
Pennances, than with Contemplation.






VI. ERROR.


True Contemplation must keep it self fixed only
to the essence of God, without re∣flecting
either on his Persons or
his Attributes.
 And an Act of
Faith thus conceived, is more
perfect and meritorious than
that which considers God with
the Divine Attributes, or with the Persons of
the Trinity in it.






REFUTATION.


The Persons of the Trinity, and the At∣tributes
of God, are the proper Objects of
Faith and love, while we recollect all the
Powers of our Souls, and resign our selves
to God: for as these are divine Truths, that
are revealed to us, so the Attributes of God
are both good in themselves, and good to
us, so that they are proper to raise in us a
true Contemplation. It is also false, that an
Act of Faith, that has God for its Object,
without considering his Attributes, or the
Persons of the Trinity, is more perfect than
that which regards God in conjunction with
them. For if to believe that God is one,
and that he is Just, is a perfect and a merito∣rious
Act of Faith,

and to believe that
God is true in his


Nature is also a perfect and meritorious Act;
then the Act by which God is believed to be
true, just and Three in One, is a more per∣fect
and a more meritorious Act, than that
in which he was considered only as one in
Essence. Because a man merits more by two
Acts of the same vertue than by a single one
only: for God has communicated supernatu∣ral
helps to us, not only for doing one Act
of vertue, but that we may make an advance
in such Acts. Therefore one Act of Faith,
that is equivalent to two others, is more me∣ritorious
and perfect than any one of these
two. Therefore we may justly conclude a∣gainst
the first branch of this 
Article,
 that
true and perfect Contemplation raised to its
highest pitch, must not only regard God in
his Essence, but likewise in his Persons and
Attributes.






VII. ERROR.


The Soul becomes immediatly united to God
in Contemplation; so that there is no need of
Phantasms, Images, or any sort of Representa∣tion.






REFUTATION.


Tho it is true, that the Soul in some sort
unites her self immediately
to God in Contemplation,

that is, by a Union of Affe∣ctions;
for the Understan∣ding
beholds God simply, yet some Ideas are


necessary for exciting the natural force of the
Understanding, and to carry it to look at
God: which Idea is a sort of Object that moves
the Understanding.






VIII. ERROR.


All contemplative persons suffer in the Act
of Contemplation such grievous Torments, they
seem to surpass even the sufferings of the Mar∣tyrs
themselves.






REFUTATION.


If Contemplation consists (as the 
Quietists

pretend it does) in this, that
the Soul puts her self in the
presence of God,
 by an act of
Faith, full of Love, and after
that continues idle: this is
not the being formally tor∣mented,
or the enduring
more than the Martyrs suf∣fered:
and tho it is true in
some sort, that Pains and
Miseries come after Con∣templation,
this flows either
from the Devil, to whom upon that occa∣sion
God gives leave to try those persons, or
from some weakness in Nature, that oppresses
the Body, from Melancholy, or an abundance
of Blood, that raises Headaches, or from
some other unknown Cause. But many others
have appeared to be in the very Act of Con∣templation,
as it were environed with Light,


and have looked with a serene, and sometimes
with a smiling countenance; which 
Lewis

the XI. of 
France
 observed in 
Francis a Paula;

and they have been as it were overflown with
Joy, when the Contemplation was over; ha∣ving
been admitted in it, to see their Bride∣groom
in that simple Act, in which there
passes as it were a Marriage between God
and the Soul.






IX. ERROR.


During the Sacrifice of the Mass, and on the
Festivals of the Saints, it is better to apply ones
self to an Act of pure Faith, and to Contem∣plation,
than to the Mysteries of that Sacrifice,
or to consider the Lives of those Saints.






REFUTATION.


He is much deceived, who thinks to arrive at
Contemplation without a
due disposition of Soul for
it:
 and therefore the con∣sideration
of the Mysteries
of the Mass, and of the Ex∣amples
that the Saints have
set us, is a spiritual prepa∣ration
for it, tho it may be
only a remote one: therefore a Christian
ought to set himself first to consider the My∣steries
of the Mass, and the Lives of the
Saints, and then apply himself to Contem∣plation,
having prepared his Soul duly for
it.








X. ERROR.


The reading of Spiritual Books, Sermons,
Vocal Prayer, the Invocation of Saints, and
all such things, are hindrances to Contempla∣tion,
which is only attained by the 
Prayer
 of

Quietness,
 to which it is not necessary to premise
any preparation whatsoever.






REFUTATION.


If in every profession, but chiefly in a true
and unfainedly spiritual Tem∣per,

that Maxim holds good,

Nemo repente sit summas,
 No
man attains to the height all
of the sudden, which daily
experience demonstrates,
then it is but suteable to the
feebleness of our Nature, to
which the Divine Grace accommodates it
self, that in our Journey towards that heighth
of Eternity, 
as facilioribus sit incipiendum,

we must begin with those things that are ea∣sier;
therefore it is great Ignorance or pre∣sumption
to enter into the 
Prayer of Quiet∣ness

before other exercises, and without due
preparation. And he who begins his course
thus, will end it without any fruit.






XI. ERROR.


The Sacrament of Pennance before Commu∣nion,
is not for contemplative Souls, that live
in this inward state; but only for those that
are in the Exteriour and Meditative state.








REFUTATION.


These Contemplative persons have but
one Soul, which at some times
meditates,
 and at other times
contemplates: and that may
come to be in a state of sin. Therefore the
Sacrament of Pennance is necessary even for
those Contemplative Souls, before they go
to Communion.






XII. ERROR.


Meditation does not look at God with the
Light of Faith, but only in a natural Light,
in Spirit and in Truth: and therefore it is not
meritorious before God.






REFUTATION.


If Meditation were not in some sort at least
in the way of Congruity, me∣ritorious
before God;
 it could
not be so much practised in
all Religious Orders, from
whence there have come, and
daily there does come, so many of the shining-lights
of the Holy 
Roman Church:
 nor would
it have been set on so much by their Holy

Patriarchs,
 nor rewarded by the 
Popes
 with
Plenary Indulgences, as a spiritual Exercise
suteable to the Friends of God; and to those
who had abandoned the Snares of this pre∣sent
World. But as one may know the Exi∣stence
of God by the Light of Nature, as well
as by a supernatural Faith, so likewise some


Meditations look at God, only with the Light
of Nature; and others are Acts of a Superna∣tural
Faith.






XIII. ERROR.


Not only inward and mental Images, but
those outward ones which are worshipped by the
Faithful, such as the Images of Christ and of his
Saints, are hurtfull to contemplative Persons,
and they ought to be avoided and removed, that
so they may not hinder Contemplation.






REFUTATION.


All things are useful to the Service of
Christ, that either is de∣creed,

or that may be de∣creed
by the Holy 
Mother
Church:
 in all whose Con∣sultations
the Holy Ghost
presides and directs them.
Therefore if the Church
appoints the 
Adoration of
Images,
 none of the Faith∣ful
ought to avoid them,
or remove them as hurtful to Contemplation,
and some secret looks towards these Images,
is no way likely to make a man fall from the
heighth of Contemplation; or the 
Prayer of
Quietness;
 from which if he falls at any time,
it flows from his own great Instability, since
the reasonable Soul is a Nobler being, and
the Grace that it receives, is of a higher na∣ture,


than is supposed in this Article.
Therefore a moderate regard to 
Images
 will
serve to confirm the Soul in her inward Re∣collection,
if a Contemplative man regulates
this by the help of the Grace of God.






XIV. ERROR.


He that has once applyed himself to Contem∣plation,
must never return to Meditation; for
this were to fall from a better State to a
worse.






REFUTATION.


It is true, that it is an ill thing to go from
better to worse; but it is oft
times good for a man,
 that
cannot attain to that which
is 
better,
 to content himself
with that which is 
good.
 It
is also true, that while a man
is in Contemplation, he ought not to let
that go that he may turn himself to Medita∣tion.
Yet tho Contemplation is still the bet∣ter
State, when a Christian is not actually in
Contemplation, it is not Inconvenient for
him to apply himself to Meditation: because
the Soul ought to follow God with all due
Reverence, in all those ways in which he
may lead her.






XV. ERROR.


If foul and impure Thoughts come into the
mind while one is in Contemplation, he ought to
take no care to drive them away: nor to turn


himself to any good thoughts, but to have a com∣placence
in the trouble that he suffers from
them.






REFUTATION.


It is a piece of prudence in a man who
being in Contemplation,
would not lose that union
by which he is united to
God,
 to avoid every thing
that may occasion it; as on
the contrary, it is a strong
piece of neglect to enter∣tain
that with complacence
which must make one lose
it, as St. 
Thomas
 of 
Aquin

says, 
He that loves the cause
from which any effect fol∣lows,
either naturally, or at least commonly, does
vertually love the effect it self:
 And the
Holy Ghost says, 
He that loves danger, shall
perish in it.
 Therefore a man who being in
Contemplation, feels the Rebellion of the
sensible part, he ought to use all diligence
to overcome in whatsoever a state he may be
in. He ought therefore to recommend it to
God, and to implore his Grace to quie

all those evil thoughts: that so his joy being
spread abroad in the Soul, all the disorderly
motions of sense may be calmed, 
& ut sine
aspera in vias planas,
 That what is rough may
be made smooth.








XVI. ERROR.


No inward Action or Affection, tho formed
by the vertue of Faith, is pure or pleasing to
God: because it rises out of self-love, unless it
is unfused in us by the Holy Ghost, without any
Industry or Diligence used by us: therefore they
that are in the state of Contemplation or of
Prayer, or inward Affections, ought to continue
in a state of suspence, waiting for the miracu∣lous
Influence of the H. Ghost.






REFUTATION.


God is not only pleased with all his own
Gifts, that are in us, but with
every thing that is done by us,

with the help of his Grace:
therefore our Contemplation
will be so much the more per∣fect,
the less inactive we our
selves are: provided that the
Contemplative person does
not suffer himself to be carried away by any
sensible Object; for by that he would fall
from that State, and become as 
Lot's
 Wife,
who was stopt short, because she looked be∣hind
her. It is then a rashness to keep our
selves in an unactive state, and in it to look
for the miraculous Influence of the H. 
▪
For all that are in the 
Prayer of Quietness,

must not expect to be led into this Passive
State, since they have not a Condignity sute∣able


to those Gifts. Tho sometimes the
H. Ghost does penetrate the Souls of those
who are in this prayer of inward affection,
but this is the effect of a particular Grace:
I add against the first branch of this 
Article

that the 
Quietists
 say in the 
12th Article,
 that
Meditation is of no merit in the sight of God,
because it does not look at him with the
Light of Faith; from which I infer,
that an Act formed by the Power of Faith,
is meritorious before God, and by conse∣quence,
it is pure and acceptable to him.






XVII. ERROR.


Those who have arrived at the State of
Contemplation, and the Prayer of inward
Quietness, being Religious Persons, or being
under the Authority of Parents, or any other
superiours, are not bound to observe their Rules,
or to obey their Superiours, while they are in
Contemplation, lest that Interrupt it.






REFUTATION.


Altho Contemplation is an Act of high
Perfection, yet since it is not
commanded by God,
 it may
be interrupted without sin:
and since Obedience to Pa∣rents
and superiours, is commanded by God,

 ought to take place, and even Contem∣plation
ought to be discontinued in order to
it. And therefore considering the Order that
God has setled, that Obedience ought to be


preferred to Contemplation, tho the latter is
as to its objective Perfection much more va∣luable
than the former.






XVIII. ERROR.


Contemplative persons ought to divest them∣selves
of all affections to all
things:
 they ought to reject
and despise all Gods gifts
and favours, and to strip
themselves of all Inclinations
even for vertue it self; and in
order to this totall abnega∣tion
of all things, and that
they may live better within
themselves, they ought even
to do that which is contrary to Modesty and de∣cency;
provided that it be not expresly contrary
to some of the ten Commandments.






REFUTATION.


When God favours Contemplative Persons
so far, as to communicate any of his bles∣sings
to them, these things ought not to
be despised, but to be considered as Fa∣vours
that tend both to beautify the Soul,
and to fortify her in the exercise of Ver∣tue:
so that tho Contemplative Persons
ought not to be lifted up with them,
yet they ought to value them highly, and
to make use of them with all Humility of
Spirit: and since God considers 
Decency
 as a
sort of Goodness, Contemplative persons


ought to be 
decent
 in all things: for God has
not by any special Decree exempted them
from the Rules of Reason, upon which all
the 
Modesty
 and 
decency
 of Life is foun∣ded.






XIX. ERROR.


Contemplative Persons are subject to violent
Commotions, by which they lose
the exercise of the Freedom of
their Will.
 So that tho they may
fall into most grievous Sins, as
to the exteriour Act, yet they
do not at all sin inwardly: And
so they are not bound to confess
that which they have done. All this is proved
by the example of 
Job,
 who tho he not only said
things that were very Injurious to his Neigh∣bour,
but had blasphemed God most Impiously,
yet he did not sin in all this: because all was done
by the Violence of the Devill. In order to the judg∣ing
of these Violences, neither the Learning of
the Schoolmen or of the Casuists, is of any use:
but a supernatural Spirit is necessary, which is
to be found in very few persons: now these
are the only Competent Iudges, who must not
judge of the Internal by the External; but on
the contrary, of the External by the Inter∣nal.








REFUTATION.


In this Article the Snake does not hide him∣self
in the Grass, but shews
himself very visibly:
 since by
this it is plain, that the 
Quie∣tists

will be sensual 
Libertines

under the name of Spiritual
and Contemplative Persons.
The Example that they
bring of 
Iob
 shews clearly
how little they understand
the Scripture. 
Iob
 did not
sin outwardly, neither
against his Neighbour nor against God in
what he said, cap. 19. ver. 6. as 
Pineda (tom. 2.
in Iob 235)
 has evidently proved from the
literal sense of the words: he did not sin against
his Neighbour, as appears by the Expositions
of the Holy 
Fathers,
 from whom we are to
learn the true sense of the Scriptures. And
to end this matter in a few words, that Grace
with which God assists us at all times, is such,
that we co-operating with it, may over∣come
all the Temtations of our Enemies. And
Christ has said to all in the person of 
S. Paul,
My Grace is sufficient for thee:
 therefore a Con∣templative
Person cannot be pushed on by any
violence or necessity whatsoever, to any Ex∣ternal
Act of Sin.



It is not easie to judge whether these 
Arti∣cles

are faithfully drawn out, or truly repre∣sented:
for it is probable, that 
Malice
 has a
large share in some of them, chiefly in this last,
which leads to down-right 
Libertinage;
 tho
others have rather suspected, that all tended
to an Elevated 
Deism:
 yet it is certain, that
if there is much Poison in these 
Articles,
 the
Antidote of the 
Censure
 is so feeble, that it
cannot have a strong Operation; and it shews
how little the 
Scripture
 and true 
Divinity
 is
understood at 
Rome.










POSTSCRIPT.


IN the former 
Letter,
 I told you all that I
could learn of this matter, during my stay
at 
Rome,
 but having left in 
Iuly,
 I prevailed
with one to give me an account of the Con∣clusion
of this Affair, of which I send you a
Copy: for tho I know all the 
Gazettes
 of

Europe
 will be full of the Decision and end
that is believed to be put to the business of

Quietism,
 yet you know too well, how
little one ought to depend on such Relations:
all the news of this matter, will either be
that which is writ by the direction of the

Inquisition,
 or by the Strangers that are there,
and pick up such things as they find among
the 
Romans,
 who are ever true to the old


Character that 
Iuvenal
 gave of that 
City,


Sequitur fortunam, ut semper, & odit
Damnator.


Therefore I will give you an account of
this business, on which you may depend, in the
words of a Letter writ me from 
Rome.


Now this great Affair, upon which men
have so long lookt with so much expectation,
is at an end: and a party that was believed to
be a Million strong, is now either quite extin∣guisht,
or at least oppressed with a great deal
of Infamy: and Mr. 
Molinos,
 who has lived
above twenty years in this 
City,
 in the highest
Reputation possible, is now as much hated
as ever he was admired: he is not only consi∣dered
as a Condemned, and an Abjured 
Here∣tick,

but he is said to have been convicted of
much Hypocrisy, and of a very Iewd course
of life; which is so firmly believed by the

Romans,
 that he was treated by them on the
day of his Abjuration, with all possible In∣dignities;
but the people as they shewed their
affections to him, by their cries of 
Fire, Fire,

so were ready to have sacrificed him to their
rage, if he had not been well defended by the

Sbiri
 and Guards that were about him. And
it would be a crime enough at present, to re∣commend
a man to the care of the 
Inquisitors,

if he should seem to doubt either of his Here∣sy,
or of the Scandals of his life. All the
party is extreamly sunk: Cardinal 
Petrucci



himself lives in 
Rome
 as if he were in a desert;
for no Body goes to visit him, and he stirs as
little abroad: nor is it thought that he will
escape: there are four sent by the 
Inquisition

to his Diocess of 
Iessi
 to examin his beha∣viour
there: there is also a discourse, that has
lately appeared at 
Rome,
 that was secretly prin∣ted,
of which he is suspected to be the Author,
which is an 
Apology for Quietism,
 that gives
great offence. It is said, that the 
Inquisitors

had full proofs against 
Molinos,
 by fourteen
Witnesse; of whom eight indeed came and
offered their Depositions of their own accord,
and the other six were forced to declare the
truth, which raises the Credit of their Testi∣mony:
since his Abjuration, it is said that ma∣ny
of his Followers have abjured in private,
and that besides the Prisoners that are in their
hands, great numbers come in every day to
accuse themselves, and to offer themselves to
pennance, these are all very gently dismissed
by the 
Inquisitors,
 who are now as much cen∣sured
by the 
Romans
 for their excessive mild∣ness,
as ever they have been blamed by others
for their rigour: and those secret Abjurations
are believed to be all the Severity that they
will practise on this Occasion; for it is said that
even 
F. Appiani
 the 
Iesuite
 will be abjured in
secret; tho some say, he is madd, others that
he is become deaf and dumb, and not a few
believe that he is dead: so uncertain are all


Reports at present. In a word, the hatred of the
present 
Pontificate
 appears very visibly upon
this Occasion: the 
People
 affecting to shew a
very extraordinary rage against a person, and a
party, that has been so much favoured and sup∣ported
by the 
Pope:
 so that this matter comes
clearly home to him, and wounds his Repu∣tation
extreamly; all this raises the credit of the

Iesuites,
 who value themselves upon the zeal
and the conduct of their 
Society
 upon this Oc∣casion.
All the 
Popes
 Enemies, the 
Iesuites,

the 
French Party,
 and the body of the 
People,

that are Malecontented and weary of him,
and his long and dull 
Reign,
 shew the Plea∣sure
they have in aggravating this matter a∣gainst
him: they say, this is the first time
that ever any 
Heresy
 made 
Rome
 its Seat,
where it choosed to nestle it self; but it is
yet more strange, that it should have conti∣nued
there above twenty years, notwithstand∣ing
all that multitude of 
Spyes
 that the 
Inqui∣sition

has every where; that the 
Pope
 should
have shut his Ears against all Complaints,
so that this Doctrine had gained so great Au∣thority,
that those who attackt it, passed for

Hereticks,
 or Calumniators at least, and that
even after all the Discoveries that have been
made, that the 
Pope
 was known to favour

Molinos
 secretly, and was so hardly brought at
last to consent to the Condemnation, in which
it is said, that nothing prevailed on him till


the 
Cardinal's
 informed him of the Scandals
of 
Molinos
's Life, that were proved: this
was indeed a matter that could fall within the

Popes
 understanding; for the points of Do∣ctrine
are believed to be above it. All these
things concur to increase the Contempt un∣der
which the present 
Pontisicate
 lies; yet as
for those Scandals of 
Molinos
's life, I do not
know what to believe: many will not believe
them, and think they are only Impostures
given out to render him odious; for if they
had been true, and well proved, it is said,
that the 
Censure
 would have been severer; for
a perpetual 
Imprisonment,
 and the saying his

Credo,
 and the fourth part of the 
Rosary
 every
day, are mild Punishments, if he is found
to have been so flagitious a man, and so vile
a Hypocrite, as is given out. His own Be∣haviour
at the 
Minerva
 did not look, either
like a Man, that was much confounded with
the Discoveries that had been made, or that
was very Penitent for them, or for his 
Heresy:

so that the Mildness of the 
Censure,
 to a Man
that shewed to little humility or repentance,
seems to flow rather from the Defectiveness
of the Proofs, than from the gentleness of the

Tribunal.
 I confess, I was not a Witness to
what passed in the 
Minerva;
 for as I would
not venture in the Crowd, so both Money
and Favour was necessary to accommodate a
man well on that occasion, where not only


a general Curiosity brought a vast confluence
of People together, to see the issue of a Busi∣ness
that has been so long in suspence, but a
particular Devotion: for the 
Pope
 had granted
a 
General Indulgence
 to all that should assist in
that Solemnity: but I will give you the ac∣count
as I had it from Eye-witnesses. 
Moli∣nos

was well dressed, new trimm'd, in his
Priestly Habit, with a cheerful Countenance,
that as was said by his Enemies, had all the
Charmes on it, that were necessary to re∣commend
him to the fair Sex. He was brought
from 
Prison
 in an open Coach, one 
Domini∣can

being with him in it. He was at first
placed for some time in one of the 
Corridori of
the Minerva:
 he looked about him very freely,
and returned all the Salutes that were made
him: and all that he was heard say, was,

That they saw a man that was defamed, but that
was Penitent (Infamato ma Pentito.)
 After
that he was carried to dinner, where he was
well treated, that being to be his last good
Dinner. After Dinner, he was brought into
the 
Church,
 as in a Triumph, carried on the
shoulders of the 
Sbiri
 in an open Chair: when
he was brought to his place, as he made his
Reverence very devoutly to the 
Cardinals,
 so
there was no shew of Fear or of Shame, in
his whole Deportment. He was chained, and
a Wax Light was put in his hand, while two
strong-lung'd 
Fryers
 read his 
Process
 aloud,


and care had been taken to lay matters so, that
as some of the 
Articles
 were read, all should
cry 
Fire, Fire.
 When he came back to 
Prison,

he entred into his little Cell, with great
Tranquillity, calling it his 
Cabinet,
 and
took leave of his 
Priest
 in these words, 
Adieu
Father, we shall meet again at the Day of Iudg∣ment,
and then it will appear on which side
the Truth is, whether on my side, or on yours.
 So
he was shut up for 
Life.
 Yet after all I find
none of the wise men here think that the
thing is at an end; but that the Fire which
seems to be now extinguished, will break
out with more violence; for one of his 
Fol∣lowers

had the boldness to tell the 
Inquisitors

to their face, that they were a Company of
Unjust, Cruel, and Heretical men; and
compared their Treatment with that which
Christ had met with, and yet even he has
escaped upon an Abjuration, as is pretended.
The Reasons that are given for this extraor∣dinary
Gentleness of the 
Inquisitors,
 who are
seldom accused for erring on this side, are
both the Numbers of the 
Party,
 who might
be much irritated by publick Examples, and
also the great Credit that their 
Doctrine
 has
from the 
Mystical Divinity,
 that is autho∣rised
by so many 
Canonisations:
 for it is said,
that from several parts the 
Inquisitors
 have
brought together above twenty thousand of

Molino
's 
Letters:
 whose Correspondence


was so vast, that some give out, that the

Post
 of the 
Letters,
 that were brought him the
day in which he was seised on, rise to twenty
Crowns. And I heard a 
Divine
 of 
Rome
 con∣fess,
that they have such 
Authorities
 for most of
their 
Tenets,
 that they will never be beat out
of them, by the force of their 
School Divinity,

therefore he thought it was necessary to con∣demn
them by a formal Sentence, in which
the Authority of the Church was to be inter∣posed.
Most of the condemned 
Articles
 are
nothing but an Invidious Aggravating of
the Doctrine of 
Predestination
 and 
Grace
 Ef∣ficacious
of it self, and of Immediat Inspira∣tion:
for all the hard Consequences that are
pretended to be drawn, either from the one
or the other of these Opinions, are all turned
into so many 
Articles,
 and condemned as so
many Impious Doctrines; but you will be
better able to judge of this matter when you
see all that the 
Inquisitors
 will think sit to
print concerning it.










A SECOND
LETTER
Writ from
ROME,
Containing some Particulars, relating
to the
INQUISITION▪


SIR;


MY last to you, together with the

Advertisement
 which was sent me
from 
Rome,
 related wholly to the
Affairs of the 
Quietists;
 but be∣cause
I know your Curiosity will perhaps go
further, and that you expect such 
Observations

from me, as you fancy me capable to make,
in a 
Countrey
 where I have now made so long
a stay, that it is my own fault, if I have not
been able to see a little further than Common



Travellers
 do, therefore I will try what I
can say that may please you.


I am, as you know, no Searcher into 
Manu∣scripts,

or the Curiosities of 
Libraries,
 nor
can I bring my self to so dry a study as is that
of 
Medals,
 or 
Inscriptions.
 I had rather be
beholding to the Labours of others, for the
Discoveries they have made in those mat∣ters,
than wear out my Eyes and spend my
Time in the reading and Deciphering those

Remains
 of Antiquity. I love all that know∣ledg,
which, with how much difficulty soe∣ver
it may be acquired, feeds the mind with
some useful Ideas: but as for that knowledg
which carrys one no further, then that such
a 
Word,
 or such a 
Hierogliphick
 signified such
a 
thing,
 and that gives the mind no matter to
work on, and raises no game at which it may
fly, it has not charm enough to work on so
lasy a man as I am. I confess, my studies, and
my way of Life would have carried me more
naturally into matters of 
Religion,
 or into
the 
Politicks:
 but as to the former, 
Italy
 is
not a Country, where a man either can or
dare reason upon these Subjects: for their
Ignorance is such, that no man can profit
much by their conversation on those heads:
besides that, it is not safe to do it. The 
Ita∣lians

are too well bred, to attack a man on
that Argument; and they know their own
Ignorance so well, and have so high an Opi∣nion


of the 
Learning
 of the 
Hereticks,
 that they
are sure never to provoke any of them: and
he were a very bold and Indiscreet man, that
would begin the dispute with them: so after
all, 
Newes
 and 
Politicks
 is all that Remains,
and you know I am idle enough both to
think and to talk of these upon occasion: yet
I must confess, that I find so many of my

Reflections
 in Dr. 
Burnets Letters,
 that I have
got sent me from 
Leghorn,
 that if I had not
seen these, I had very likely writ you a great
many of those that are already set out by
him, with so much advantage, that I find the
best part of all my 
Observations
 are already
made by a better Pen: but I, who have as great
an Aversion from copying, as he says he has;
will avoid the saying any one thing that I find
in his 
Letters:
 and will only speak of those
Places that he did not see, or of those matters
which he had not time enough to enquire af∣ter,
or to observe; and since the former 
Let∣ter,

contained such a long and serious recital
of a matter, that if it fixed your attention, yet
must have wearied it, I will now divert you
a little, with some 
Storys,
 that will be more
agreeable; and then I will return to more se∣rious

Subjects.
 I will begin with some relating
to the 
Inquisition.
 I told you in my former

Letter,
 of a great many 
Prisoners
 in the 
In∣quisition,

but among all the 
Prisoners
 that are
there, none will surprise you so much as


when I tell you that there is a 
Cruxifix
 kept
there, which is called, 
our Saviour in the In∣quisition:

when this was first told me, I durst
not speak out that which naturally occur∣red
to my thoughts, which was, that our 
Sa∣viour

and the 
Truth of his Gospel,
 was indeed
shut up with so much severity by the 
Inquisi∣tors,

that it was no wonder if he were recko∣ned
among the 
Prisoners
 of that severe 
Court.

But this story is less serious, and more Comical.


You know that in all the bigotted 
Towns,

the 
people
 are sorted in several 
Fraternities,

and every one of these, has their peculiar

Churches, Altars, Images
 and 
Relicks,
 to
which they pay a more extraordinary devo∣tion:
so there was one in 
Florence,
 among
whose favourite 
Images
 a 
Crucifix
 hapned to
be one: a 
Woman
 (that had a fair 
Daughter
)
fell sick: and as she had payed many Devo∣tions
to that 
Image,
 so she came to fancy,
that in her sickness she had the Returns of
very extraordinary Favours from it. The
truth of the matter was, that one who had a
mind to have frequent access to her 
Daugh∣ter,

made a shift to deceive the poor 
sick
Woman:
 for he appeared in such a disguise
to her, that she believed it was the 
Image

that came to comfort her. And that which
was the most acceptable part of the Impo∣sture
was, that the 
Impostor
 knew by her

Daughters
 means, every thing that she wan∣ted,


and took care to provide it for her,
so that at every visit that he made her, he
brought along with him, all the things that
she needed: this was sensible; so the credulous

Woman
 believed all this came from her be∣loved

Image:
 and she was now as gratefull as
she had been before devout: she told all that
came to see her; how careful and bountiful
that 
Image
 was to her: and shewed them
how well she was supplied by it. In short,
this came to be generally believed: for when
the least 
story
 of this kind gets vent, and is
well received by the 
Priests,
 the 
People
 run
in so headlong to it, that it would pass for
a Crime capable enough of ruining one in the
Spirit of the 
Inquisitors,
 to seem to doubt
of it; but much more if one studied to unde∣ceive
others: therefore things of this nature
kindle the minds of a superstitious multitude
so quick, that in a few days a whole 
Town

will seem as it was out of its Wits: which
appeared signally on this occasion at 
Florence:

for now the whole 
Town
 entred into this 
Fra∣ternity.

The 
Great Duke
 himself came into
the number, and all were studying what new
Honours should be done to an 
Image
 that had
been so kind to one of its 
Worshippers.
 But some
that were wiser than the rest, saw thro the
Cheat, and Informed 
P. Innocent
 the 
10th.
 of
it, who was resolved to put a stop to the cur∣rent
of this 
Superstition:
 yet he saw it was ne∣cessary


to do it with some address: It fell out
to be the year of 
Iubily
 1650. so the 
Pope
 writ
to 
Florence,
 that he had heard of the 
Miracles

of that 
Image,
 to which he desired earnestly to
do his own 
Devotions,
 therfore he intreated
them to bring it to 
Rome;
 that so the 
Image

might have the addresses of all the 
Pilgrims,
 as
well as his own made to it. Upon this the
more bigotted of the 
Fraternity,
 would needs
accompany the Charitable 
Image:
 so they
carried it in 
Procession
 to 
Rome:
 and did not
doubt but that the 
Pope
 and 
Cardinalls
 with
the 
Clergy
 of 
Rome
 would have come out in 
Pro∣cession

to meet them and their 
Image:
 The sur∣prise
was no doubt very great, when instead of
all this, they found a Company of 
Sbirri
 stay∣ing
for them at the 
Porta dell Populo;
 who
took their 
Image
 from them, and carried it
away to the 
Inquisition;
 and sent them away
not a little mortified at the Disgrace, that
had befallen their 
Crucifix,
 who has been
ever since a 
Prisoner
 in the 
Inquisition.


I was told of another 
Prisoner
 there of a
later date, but not much unlike this. You
know the legend of the 
Plague
 that was in

Rome,
 as I remember in S. 
Gregory the great's

time, that was stopt by an 
Angel,
 that as was
pretended came down, and stood over that

Castle,
 which was formerly called 
Moles Ha∣driani,

but has carried the name of 
Castro S.
Angelo
 ever since. The 
Fryers
 of 
Ara Coeli
 had


got a 
Stone,
 upon which there was an Im∣pression
like the print of a 
Foot:
 so they had
put this in some part of their 
Church,
 and
gave it out that this print was made by the

Foot
 of that 
Angel;
 tho one can 
hardly
 Ima∣gine
how they fancied that an 
Angel
 treads so
hard. This 
Stone
 had many 
Devotions
 payed
it. The learned Sig
r.
 
Pietro Bellori,
 who is
without dispute the best 
Antiquary
 in 
Rome,

being once in that 
Chappel
 at his Devotions;
observed a great many praying about this

Stone,
 and kissing it with great Respect and
Affection; so he came to look upon it, and
having examined it carefully, he saw clear∣ly
it was a fragment of a Statue of the Goddess

Isis;
 the 
Greek
 Characters were legible, and
many things concurred to make a man of his
Learning and Exactness conclude, that the

Devotions
 were mis-applied that were payed
it; so he went to one of the 
Fathers
 of the

House,
 and acquainted him with his Observa∣tion:
and wished that they would remove
that mistaken Object of Worship, lest some
of the learned 
Hereticks
 that passed thro 
Rome,

might discover and reproach the 
Church
 with
it. But the 
Fathers
 of the 
House
 found their
account in this matter, so they were so far
from following his good Advice, that they
aspersed him that had given it, so as to accuse
him of Impiety for diverting the Devotions
of the people: the Imputation was carried so


far that he was brought before the 
Inquisition

to clear himself, which he did so fully, that
he not only got safe out of their hands, but
which was more, he convinced them that he
was in the right: so the 
Stone
 was removed,
and keeps the 
Crucifix
 company in the 
Inqui∣sition.


But by these two Storys, you will perhaps
imagin that I design to beget in you a good
Opinion of that 
Court;
 but I will now tell
you another, that will soon bring you back
to your old thoughts of that Tribunal. 
Burrhi

is a man so famous in the World, that one
that has looked into Natural 
Philosophy
 and

Chimistry,
 could not be long in 
Rome
 with∣out
making an acquaintance with him: but
to tell you truth, I neither found him to
be so great a 
Chimist
 as he fancies himself to
be, nor so great a 
Heretick
 as the 
Inquisitors

have made him. I tell you this the more par∣ticularly,
that you may upon it judge how
far you are to believe the account that the

Inquisitors
 may give of their proceedings a∣gainst

Molinos:
 since you may conclude from
what was done to the 
one,
 what may be ex∣pected
in all cases that are brought before
them. 
Burrhi
's Story is in short this; He is a
Gentleman of the 
Millanese,
 who was born
to an Estate of 8000. 
Crowns
 a year: In his
youth he had travelled, and had got into his
head the Notions of the 
Now Philosophy
 and


of 
Chimistry:
 so at his return to 
Milan,
 he
began to propogate the 
new Philosophy,
 and
to form a Conference upon those matters:
the 
Priests
 it seems suspected, that there might
be somewhat under this, so he was put in
the 
Inquisition,
 but nothing could be made
out against him, he was let out: after that
he went and stayd for some years in 
Germany

and 
Holland;
 and it is very probable that he
might have expressed himself concerning the

Courts
 of 
Inquisition,
 as a man that had no
great opinion either of their Justice, or of
their Mercy. And as he has gone into all the
high pretensions of the 
Chimists,
 so it is pro∣bable
enough that he has talked of matters
of 
Religion
 in that Mysterious unintelligible

Iargon,
 that is used almost by all the men
that are of the highest Elevation of 
Chimistry,

but chiefly by 
Paracelsus
 and 
Van Helmont.

In short, some Accusations were given in to
the 
Inquisitors
 against him, who complained
of him to the 
Emperour,
 and had so much cre∣dit
in his 
Court
 that he strained his power to
the utmost, and seised on him, and sent him
to 
Italy,
 where those good 
Fathers
 were re∣solved
not to give him a second occasion of
boasting, that he had got safe out of their
hands: strange things were objected to him;
and as is pretended, they were proved against
him; as that the 
B. Virgin was God equal with
the Son; and that the H. Ghost was incarnate in


her, as well as the Eternal Word was in her
Son: that the three Persons in the Trinity were
the
 first, 
the
 second, 
and the
 third 
Heavens:
that the Son was from all Eternity discontented
with the Father, for not making him equal to
him: that the Consecrated Hosty had in it the
Body of the Mother as well as that of the Son:
and that the putting the pieces of it together in
the Chalice, demonstrated the Vnion between
the Mother and the Son.
 These Opinions were
all proved against him: tho he protests that
he never thought of them, yet he was forced
to abjure them in the year 1668. and was up∣on
that condemned to perpetual Imprison∣ment;
he continued in the Prison of the 
In∣quisition,

till within these five or six years,
that the Duke 
d'Estrees
 being sick, procured
an Order for having 
Burrhi
 to come and treat
him; and in gratitude to 
Burrhi,
 who cured
him, he got his Prison changed to the Castle
St. 
Angelo:
 where he now entertains himself
with 
Chimical
 Processes. It is indeed very
probable, that he had provoked the 
Inquisition,

by speaking severely and reproachfully of
them, and this was all his Crime, unless an∣other

Article
 against him might be his 
Estate;

for of his 8000. 
Crowns
 a year, there is but
3000. left him; for the good 
Fathers
 have
had the Charity to take 5000. to themselves:
and his 3000. is so eat up by them, thro whose
hands it comes to him, that he has not 1500:



Crowns
 a year payed him: and from this you
may see what credit you ought to give to the

Processes,
 the 
Articles,
 and the 
Abjurations

that are made before that 
Court.


If instead of that Zeal which animates
them against 
Heresy,
 they would purge their
own 
Church
 of those Disorders, which they
themselves acknowledg to be corruptions,
they would sooner bring themselves again in∣to
credit. The scandalous 
Pictures
 that are in
many 
Churches
 of 
Italy,
 are things that might
deserve their care, if they would turn it to
that hand. Is it not a shameful thing, that
there has not been a great 
Master
 in 
Painting

who has not put that Complement on his

Mistress,
 as to paint her for the 
Virgin?
 so
that the most celebrated 
Madonna's
 of 
Italy

are known to have been the 
Mistresses
 of the
Great 
Painters.
 The 
Postures,
 the 
Looks,
 and
the 
Nakedness
 of many of the 
Church-pieces,

are Monstrous Indecent things. The great
design of the 
Cupulo
 at 
Florence,
 is such a Re∣presentation
of 
Vice,
 that all that can be pre∣sented
by a defiled Imagination, comes short
of what is to be seen there: and tho the 
Scrip∣ture

speaks but of one Apparition of the 
Holy
Ghost
 in the shape of a 
Dove;
 one shall find
this Dove on the Head, at the Ear, and the
Mouth of I know not how many of their

Saints;
 and as one finds in many 
Pieces,
 that
their 
Masters
 have resolved to perpetuate


their own Amours in them, so Amours are
every day managed by the same methods: for
while I was at 
Rome,
 I discovered an Intrigue
between a 
Fryer
 and a 
Nun,
 by two 
Pictures,

that were drawn for them: the 
Fryer
 was
drawn as a S. 
Anthony,
 and the 
Nun
 as a S.

Katherine of Siena:
 these they were to ex∣change,
and so to feed their passion under this
disguise of Devotion.


But to return to Indecent 
Pictures,
 there
is nothing more scandalous, than the many
various Representations of the 
Trinity,
 which
must needs give to all 
Iews
 and 
Mahometans

as well as to 
us,
 that pass for 
Hereticks,
 a
strange horror to a 
Religion
 that suffers those
odious Resemblances, that give such gross
Ideas of the 
Deity,
 and of the 
Trinity:
 and
that which is yet the most scandalous part of
those 
Pictures,
 is that the Representation of

God the Father
 is often diversified according to
the caprice of the Painter; and he is to be seen
in the Habits of the several 
Orders
 of that

Church,
 and indeed both Features, Hair, Ha∣bit,
and Postures, have all the diversity in
them that is necessary to feed an 
Idolatry,
 that
is as Extravagant as it is gross.


The Picture of the B. 
Virgin,
 with the 
Or∣der

of the 
Capuchins
 under her Petticoat, is
not very apt to raise Chast Idea's in those who
look upon it. In short, whereas the Rule of
the Antient 
Architecture
 of 
Churches,
 was to


below and dark, which was thought the most
proper, for the Recollection of a man's Fa∣culties,
and by consequence for 
Devotion,
 is
now quite altered: and great 
Cupulos
 with a
vast Illumination, are necessary to shew the
Beauty of those rich Pieces, which would be
lost in 
Churches
 built as dark as the Antient
Ones were.


I confess, those Pictures are charming
things, if they were any where else than in

Churches:
 but the pleasure they give, does so
possess a man that begins to understand them,
that it will kindle any thoughts in him, sooner
than devout ones. I will not here let my
Pen carry me into a Subject that must needs
set all my thoughts on fire; and speak of the
great 
Pieces
 of 
Painting
 that are in 
Italy,
 and
of the many 
Masters
 that it produced in the
last Age: who as they were such Extraordi∣nary
men, so they lived within the Compass of
one Age; as if the Perfection in that amasing
Art had been to dye with them, as well as it
was born with them; this, I say, would make
one think, that there are Revolutions and
Aspects in the Heavens that are favorable or
cross to Arts or Sciences: and that then, the
most favourable Aspect for 
Painting
 that ever
was, produced those astonishing perfor∣mances.
For tho the great decay of Learning
that is every where, may be reasonably e∣nough
resolved in this, that whereas in the


last 
Age
 many great 
Princes
 were either 
Learn∣ed

themselves, or at least they made it a
Maxim to protect and encourage 
Learning;

but this having at last grown to an excess of
Rudeness and Pedantry, and Princes beco∣ming
generally extream Ignorant, it came to
pass for a piece of breeding, to say nothing that
was beyond their pitch, or that seemed to
reproach their Ignorance: and those who
could not hide their Learning, were called

Pedants:
 and pedantry was represented so
odious, that Ignorance being the lasiest as
well as the surest way to avoid this, all men
took that very naturally; and when other
methods are as effectual to raise men to the
highest preferments either of the 
Barr
 or of
the 
Pulpit
 as true Learning or reall Merit,
few will choose the long and tedious, and often
the most uncertain way, when the End that
they propose to themselves, may be cer∣tainly
compassed by a more effectual and ea∣sier
one. Flattery and Submissions are sooner
Learned and easier practised by men of low
and mean souls, than much hard and dry
study: thus, I say, the decay of 
Learning
 is
very easily accounted for, in the 
Age
 in which
we live: but as for the Art of 
Painting,
 it
is still in such esteem, and great pieces go
still at such vast rates, that if the Genius
and capacity for it were not lost, there is
encouragment enough still to set it a going:


but I leave this subject not without putting
some constraint on my self; for who can think
of such Wonderful men as 
Correge, Michael
Angelo, Raphael, Paulo Veronese, Iulio Ro∣mano,
Carrache, Palma, Titian
 and 
Tintoret,

without feeling a concern at every time that
he reflects on the Wonders of their pencils:
St. 
Lukes
 pretended work, and even the sup∣posed
performances of 
Angels,
 are sad things
set near their 
pieces.
 One, whose thoughts are
full of the Wonders of that 
Art,
 that are to
be seen in 
Florence,
 goes into the 
Annunciata,

and sees not without Indignation, that ado∣red

picture
 of the 
Virgin,
 which, as the fond
people there believe, was finished by an 
An∣gel,

while the 
Painter
 that was working at it,
and that could not animate it as he desired,
fell asleep, who as soon as he awaked, saw
his piece finished. This fiction of the 
painters,

to raise the credit of his 
picture,
 is so well be∣lieved
at 
Florence,
 that he 
presents
 made to
enrich the 
Altar
 and 
Chappel,
 where it stands,
are Invaluable: & yet after all, the 
Angel's
 work
is still no better than the common 
painting
 of
that time: and that 
Angel-painter,
 was but a
bungler if compared, to the great 
Masters.
 In
a word, what can be thought of humane na∣ture,
when in so refined a place as 
Florence,

so course an Imposture has been able to
draw to it, such an Inestimable stock of
Wealth.



All these things are so many digressions
from my main subject, which was, to shew
you how much matter the 
Inquisitors
 might
find, if they would use any exactness in redres∣sing
those Abuses which they themselves will
not defend in common conversation: and yet
tho the smallest thing, that seems even at the
greatest distance to go against their Interest,
is lookt after with a very watchful care; yet
the grossest of all Impostures, that proves
profitable to them, is much encouraged by
them.


The fable of 
Loretto,
 is so black and so ri∣diculous
a piece of Imposture, that I never
saw a man of sense, that cared to enter upon
that subject. I was once in Company where
I took the liberty to propose two modest
Exceptions to it: the one was, that about
200 
years
 after the rest of the Angelical La∣bour
in carying about that 
Cottage
 is preten∣ded
to have fallen out, 
Vincent Ferrrier,

whom they believe a great Saint, not only
sayes nothing of its being then in 
Italy,
 but
sayes expresly, that it was then in 
Nazareth,
 &
that many 
Miracles
 were wrought about it.

Antonin
 of 
Florence;
 who is also the most Im∣pudent
Writer of 
Legends
 that ever was, say's
not a word of it some Ages after they say that
it was at 
Loretto.
 All the answer that I had
to this was, that it was no Article of Faith,
but whether it was true or false, the Devo∣tion


of the People was still entertained by it:
and this, they said, was as much meritorious,
tho founded on a Fable, as the giving of Cha∣rity
to one who is believed a fit object, but yet
is indeed a Cheat, is acceptable to God: and
thus he who gives upon a good inward motive,
will be rewarded according to the Dispo∣sition
of his Mind, and not according to the
Truth or Falsehood of the 
Story,
 that wrought
upon him. I durst not press this matter too
far: otherwise I would have replied, that
how excuseable soever the Superstition of
Ignorant 
People
 may be, yet this does not at
all justify the Cheat that the 
Church
 puts upon
her so easily deluded children. The truth is,
the 
Romans
 themselves have not such stiff
notions of all the points of 
Controversy
 as we
are apt to Imagine: this makes me remember
a conversation that past some years ago, be∣tween
an 
Abbot
 & one of our 
Clergymen,
 that
was then a Governour to a 
Person
 of Quality,
that in his 
Travels
 stayed for some time at

Rome.
 The 
Abbot
 seeing the 
Governour
 was con∣sidered
as a man of 
Learning,
 desired to be In∣formed
of him, what were the 
Points
 in diffe∣rence
between the 
two
 Churches: so the Go∣vernour
told him, that 
we
 had our 
worship

in a known tongue; that we gave the 
Cup
 in
the Sacrament; that we had no 
Images,
 and
did not pray to 
Saints:
 all this did not disturb
the 
Abbot,
 who said, that these were only


different 
Rites
 and 
Ceremonies,
 which might
be well enough born with: when the other
added, that we did not believe 
Transubstan∣tiation

nor 
Purgatory,
 the 
Abbot
 said, these
were the subtilties of the School: so he was
very gentle till the 
Governour
 told him, that
we did not acknowledge the 
Pope;
 then the

Abbot
 was all on fire, and could not compre∣hend,
how men could be 
Christians,
 that did
not acknowledge Christs 
Vicar,
 and S. 
Peter's
Successor:
 and it is very plain at 
Rome
 at this
day, that they consider the 
Conversion
 of 
Na∣tions,

only as it may bring in more profit into
the 
Datary Court,
 and raise the value of the 
Offi∣ces

there; for when I seemed amased in con∣versation
with some of them, to see so little
regard had to the 
Ambassadour
 of 
England,
 and
to every thing that he proposed; they told me
plainly, that perhaps the Angels in Heaven re∣joiced
at the conversion of a sinner upon the
pure motives of perfect Charity, but they at

Rome
 looked at other things. They saw no

profit
 like to come from 
England;
 no 
Bulls

were called for, and no 
Compositions
 like to be
made; if those things should once appear, then
an 
Ambassadour
 from thence would be treated
like the penitent Prodigal, especially if he
were a little less governed by the 
Iesuites,

who were believed to have managed our 
Am∣bassadour

a little too absolutely: and here it
will be no unpleasant digression if I tell you


the true reason that retarded the 
Promotion
 of
the Cardinal 
d'Esté
 so long.


The 
Pope
 himself saw what the 
Vncle
 of this

Cardinal
 did at 
Rome,
 in P. 
Alexander
 the

7ths
 time, upon the business of the 
Corsis,
 and
the affront that was put on the Duke of 
Crequy,

which made so much noise. That 
Cardinal

being then the 
Protector
 of the 
French Nation,

offered first to the D. of 
Crequy,
 to go with
him, accompanied with 500 Men, that he
knew he could raise in 
Rome,
 to the Palace of

Dom Mario Chigi,
 and to fling him out at
window: but the D. of 
Crequy
 thinking that
such a revenge went too far, the 
Cardinal

himself went accompanied with his 500 Men
to the 
Palace,
 and expostulated the matter
with the 
Pope,
 and demanded Reparation; and
when the 
Pope
 put it by in some general an∣swers,
he prest him so hard, till the 
Pope
 threat∣ned
to pull his 
Cap
 from him, but he answered,

that he would clap a Head-piece on it, to defend
it, and that he would never part with that, till
he had pulled the Tripple Crown from his head:

This was vigorous, and the 
Cardinal
 had a
mind to perpetuate the memory of it, for he
made himself be drawn with a 
Headpiece
 by
him, his hand pointing towards it, which I saw
at 
Modena;
 and it is plain by their way of spea∣king
of this matter, that they were proud of it.
The present 
Pope
 being at that time a 
Cardinal,

saw this disorder, and so he was resolved never


to raise one of that 
family
 to the 
Purple:
 yet the
earnest and repeated Instances from 
England,

overcame him at last.


But now again I return to that from which I
have digressed so often, which is the work that
the 
Inquisition
 might find in 
Italy,
 even with∣out
departing from any of their received Prin∣ciples.
That scandalous Imposture of the 
blood

of S. 
Ianuary
 at 
Naples,
 that seems to be firm &
dry in the 
Vial,
 and that dissolves and moves
as it is brought near his Head, which is so firmly
believed by all the bigots there, must needs give
an Indignation to all that love Truth, when
they see such gross Deceptions put upon the
World. I will not take upon me to say how
it is managed; but nothing is more easy than
the ordering of this matter may be. For if that

Vial
 be filled with tinctured liquor, the 
Vial

being put in Ice and Salt, will freese in an In∣stant;
and it being again in the air, may return
very quickly to its former state, so that there
is no need of any great skill for the conducting
this matter: and it is so much their Interest,
who have the keeping of this pretended 
Blood,

to keep the secret very religiously, that it is
no wonder if it is not discovered. He indeed
who either doubts of it, or would adventure
to discover it, must resolve to go and live some
were else than in 
Naples,
 where this passes for
the chief Glory, as well as the greatest bles∣sing
of their 
City:
 and the 
people
 there are so


extreamly credulous, & the 
Priests
 are so very
Insolent, that this has appeared of late in such
Instances, that if the 
Viceroy
 of 
Naples,
 were
not both a very extraordinary man, and most
excessively esteemed and beloved there, he
could not have stood his ground in the 
Dispute

which is now on foot, and of which tho all the

Gazettes
 make mention, yet I may perhaps
tell you some particulars, that may be new to
you, for I was in 
Naples
 while this matter was
in its greatest heat.


The business of the 
Ecclesiastical Immunities,

is carried so high here, that the 
General
 of the

Horse,
 who is by birth a 
Flemming,
 had almost
felt it to his cost; there were two under him,
that had quarrelled, but were made Friends;
and one of these meeting the other some days
after that, he embraced him with all the shewes
of Friendship, but having a 
stiletto
 in his hand,
he managed it so fatally, that under all the ap∣pearences
of tender Embraces, he killed him
out-right, and presently he took Sanctuary in
a 
Church,
 that was hard by; the 
General
 hear∣ing
of this, resolved he would make an Exam∣ple
of the 
Murderer:
 but not daring to drag
him out of the 
Church,
 he set a Sentinel to the
Doors, reckoning that hunger would soon
force him to come out: and tho the 
Priests

that belonged to the 
Church,
 carried him in
some Provisions, yet that could not serve him
long. But the General was forced to discharge


the 
Sentinels:
 for he was Informed, that an

Excommunication
 was coming out against
him, for distrurbing the devotions of those
that went to the 
Church:
 and he knew that if
the 
Excommunication
 should be once given
out, no body would so much as talk with him
or come near him after that: so he would not
run that risque: and this 
Assassinate
 had a fair
occasion given him to make his escape: this
was a good Essay of the Zeal for the 
Immunity

of 
places.
 Another fell out about the same time
near 
Leghorn,
 in which the sacredness of ex∣empted

persons
 was asserted in a manner that
was no less scandalous; a 
Priest
 was seised on,
for a most horrid Crime, either a 
Rape or
 a

Murder,
 I do not remember which: but he
who had no mind to be taken, defended him∣self;
and shot one of the 
Sbiri,
 upon which the
rest run away. So he apprehending that a
stronger party would be sent, that would be
too hard for him, went and retired into a
Wood, with his Fusee; and some being sent
to find him out, he had 
shot
 six or seven of
them; yet after all the sacred Character was
like to save this execrable man; for while I
was at 
Leghorn
 I was told that an 
Excommuni∣cation

was coming out, against all that should
violate the 
Ecclesiastical Immunities
 in his
Person: and no doubt the 
Great Duke
 will
give way to this: for he is so entirely deli∣vered
up to his 
Priests,
 and is become so


excessively scrupulous, that to deliver himself
from those Troubles of Conscience, which
many things, in the Administration of the 
Go∣vernment

are apt to give him, he has found out
an easy receipt, which if all other 
Princes
 can
be brought to follow, it will be very happy for
their 
Ministers.
 He then considers, that the only
sure way to be Innocent in the Conduct of Af∣fairs,
is not to know them at all: but to devolve
them entirely on his 
Ministers,
 who do all, with∣out
so much as communicating matters to him.


But the 
Viceroy
 of 
Naples
 is not so very tra∣ctable
in those matters, as appears by the vi∣gour
with which he has supported the 
secular
Tribunal
 against the Invasions of the 
Ecclesia∣stical
Court.
 That which gave the rise to the
dispute, was, a 
sute
 that was between a 
Lay¦man

and a 
Church-man,
 before one of the

Iudges
 of 
Naples,
 who decided in favour of
the 
Layman;
 upon which it was pretended,
that this was a Violation of the 
Immunities
 of
the 
Church:
 so the 
Iudge
 was 
Excommunicated;

And upon it no body would willingly appear
before him, or so much as speak to him, so ter∣rible
a thing is that Thunder there: but the

Viceroy
 has shewed on this occasion, that firm∣ness
that has appeared in all his other Actions:
and has also received 
Orders
 from 
Spain
 autho∣rising
him to keep his ground. The 
Iudge
 is
not only maintained in what he has done, but
continues still to sit on the 
bench,
 all people are


forced to bring their causes before him; & his
Sentences are executed with resolution. This
Contempt put on the 
Ecclesiastical
 Censures
by a 
Minister
 of 
Spain,
 and at a time in which
the 
Pope
 is so much in their 
Interests,
 is a little
Extraordinary. But the affront that the 
Vice∣roy

put on an 
Auditor
 of the 
Nuntio's,
 was
yet much more provoking, for it was managed
with a particular care to make the Scorn very
wounding as well as it was publick. The 
Nun∣tio

is believed to do ill Offices in this matter;
and his 
Auditor
 was known to be a man of 
Li∣berties;

it was found out that he went often to
a 
Bordello;
 the 
Viceroy
 therefore gave order to
watch him so carefully, that the 
Sbiri
 should
be sure to find him in such circumstances, as
should make his shame very Conspicuous: so
he was taken, and carried before the next

Iudge:
 the thing was laid before hand, and the

Iudge
 refusing to medle in it, the 
Sbiri
 (a sort
of men like our 
Bailiffs
) carried him to ano∣ther,
and so made the round of all the 
Iudges

in 
Naples;
 and every one of them refusing to
medle with the 
Auditor,
 the 
Sbiri
 let him go,
when the matter was made sufficiently pu∣blick,
by their carrying him about to so man∣ny
places. The 
Nuntio
 complained of the Vio∣lation
of the Rights of a 
Publick Minister,
 e∣specially
of so sacred a one. But the Reparation
that the 
Viceroy
 made, was a redoubling of
the Affront: for he ordered the 
Sbiri
 that had


taken the 
Auditor,
 to be carried about all

Naples
 with an 
Inscription
 writ in Capital
Letters, both on their Breasts and on their
Backs, mentioning the Crime for which
they were thus led about, 
which was their
having disturbed the Nuntio's Auditor in his
pleasures.


You will easily imagin that this was consi∣dered
at 
Rome
 as a most outrageous Affront;
and indeed the 
Pope
 has carried the matter of
the 
Regale
 in 
France
 so very far, that it is hard
to tell to what a degree this breach in 
Naples

may be also carried: for tho the 
Pope
 is most
excessively ignorant in all those Matters, yet
he has another Quality, that is the only thing
that is great in him, and that would indeed
become him very well, if he had a little more
Knowledg to govern it: and that is, 
that he
is the wilfullest man alive;
 and his temper is
fearless enough to make him shut his Eyes
upon all Danger.


It cannot be denied, but it is the Interest
of the 
Pope,
 as he is a 
Temporal Prince,
 to be
of the side that is now the weakest; and that
needs his support the most: and therefore it
is no wonder if he is so favourable to the
Crown of 
Spain,
 and the House of 
Austria:

but after all, his carrying the business of the

Regale
 so far, against so great a 
King,
 and
a 
King
 that has merited so much from that

Church,
 by his zeal against 
Hereticks,
 is


somewhat unaccountable: After all the Ha∣vock,
that has been made both by 
Princes

and 
Popes
 of the true Liberties of the 
Church,

and particularly after that shameful Bargain
that was made between them in the 
Concor∣date,

it has a very ill grace to see a 
Pope
 make
this the subject of so great and so long a Di∣spute;
and that the factious Clamours of a
few ill-natured and angry 
Priests,
 should
have been so much considered, as to inter∣rupt
the good understanding of the 
Courts
 of
the 
Vatican
 and 
Versailles.
 All this flowed
from the ill opinion that the 
Pope
 had of the

Iesuites,
 which being known in 
France,
 the

Iansenists
 thought it was high time for them
to recommend themselves to the 
Court
 of

Rome,
 in hope of mortifying the 
Iesuites:

yet they could not with any decency carry
the 
Papal Authority
 high, after they had
with so much force both of reason and lear∣ning,
depressed it as they had done: so they
betook themselves to the first thing that of∣fered
it self, that they knew would be very
acceptable in 
Rome,
 which was the asserting
the 
Liberties
 of the 
Church,
 and the dispu∣ting
the 
Kings
 Imposing the 
Rights
 of the

Regale
 (that is, the mean profits of 
Bishopricks,

and the 
Collating
 to 
Benefices
 without 
Cure,

during the Vacancy) on the four southern

Provinces
 of 
France.
 I will not say more of
a matter that is so well known, only I will tell


you, what a 
Doctor
 of the 
Sorbon
 said to me
upon this subject; I found he did not believe
the 
Pope's Authority
 more than I did my self;
and yet he was one of those that indirectly op∣posed
the 
Articles
 of the 
Clergy,
 and the con∣demnation
that was past on the Bishop of

Strigonium
's Censure of those 
Articles;
 for
his Authority and Learning gave a great turn
to that matter: so when I seemed amased at
this, that a man of his Principles, had acted
as he had done upon that occasion, he told me,
he had no other Consideration before him in
that matter, but to mortify the 
Clergy
 of

France,
 and to maintain the Dignity of the

Sorbon.
 It was not long since that in the Di∣spute
about 
Iansenius's
 matter, they had
made the 
Pope
 not only 
Infallible
 in matters
of 
Right,
 but of 
Fact:
 and now because the

Pope
 was not in the Interests of 
France,
 the
dispute of 
Infallibility,
 and of the Councils
of 
Constance
 and 
Basil,
 were again set on foot;
all which would be given up, and the 
Pope

would be considered 
Infallible
 to morrow, if
he were once more in the Interests of 
France;
 &
the 
Clergy,
 who had neither learning nor vertue,
but made up all Defects, by a slavish Obsequi∣ousness,
would be then as forward to magnify
the 
Infallibility,
 as they are now to depress it.


How far the 
Pope
 will embroil himself in
this new business of the 
Franchises,
 I do not
know: he has expressed a great steadiness in


it; and the truth is, 
Rome
 is now so sunk
from what it was, and the 
Franchises
 are so
considerable a part of the City, that their
being covered from the 
Execution,
 both of
Civil and Criminal 
Iustice,
 is a most horrible
Disorder: and it seems reasonable enough,
that as in all other Courts, there is nothing
now under the 
Ambassadours
 Protection, but
that which is within his Gates, so the same
Regulation should be made in 
Rome;
 where
the extent of those priviledged Places is very
great: yet afterall, if the 
French Ambassadour,

that is now on his way thither, has positive
Orders to maintain them, and has mony e∣nough
to list men, if the matter goes on to a
more obstinate Dispute; It will be no hard
matter for him to raise such a Revolt in 
Rome,

that neither the 
Popes Guards,
 nor those in the
Castle of St. 
Angelo,
 will be able to subdue
it: and if this matter goes on so far, the

French
 will very probably cut off all 
Annates,

and find a shorter way of granting of 
Bulls

within the 
Kingdom.
 It is said, that while some
have represented the apparent Inconveniences
of a Rupture with 
France
 to the 
Pope,
 and
that he was in no condition to resist that migh∣ty
Power: He answered, 
that he would suf∣fer
Martyrdom in maintaining the Rights of

St. 
Peter.
 It must be confessed, that there
was something in this saying that was
more Magnanimous, than prudent. And in∣deed


the 
Popes
 way of treating with 
Am∣bassadours,

has somewhat in it that comes
neerer the simplicity of the Fishermen, the
more modern Politicks. His dry Answer to
our 
Ambassadour,
 when he threatned him
that he would leave 
Rome,
 and go back to

England,
 if he were not better used; 
Lei e
Badrone; You are Master of that as you please;

had an air in it that I should have been much
pleased with, if it had fallen on any other than
on the 
King's Minister.


His Conduct of the 
Revenue
 is an unac∣countable
thing; for if there is not a vast

Treasure
 laid up, or a most prodigious deal of

Wealth
 secretly conveyed to his 
Family,
 it is
not to be imagined what has become of all
that 
Revenue
 that he has raised, in which the
Income is so vastly disproportioned to the ex∣pence,
that the most prying men do not know
what is become of it. The War with the

Turks
 has not cost him so much as is believed;
on the contrary, many think that he has got
by it; and that the 
Taxes
 which he has laid
on the 
Clergy
 of 
Italy
 amount to more than he
has laid out upon it: It is certain, it has not
cost him very much. He retrenched all Ex∣pences
to so great a degree, that even the pu∣blick

Charities
 were lessened: for in 
Lent,
 there
is a weekly Charity of a 
Iulio,
 or a six pence,
to all the 
poor
 that come and ask it: and the
poor commonly brought their Children with


them, so that they got as many 
Iulio's
 as
they brought 
Children;
 but the 
Pope
 limited
this, that no Charity should be given to any
under such an Age, as I remember it was be∣low
ten year old. The Administration of the

Revenue
 is indeed the only thing that he un∣derstands,
and in which he imploys all his
thoughts: and it was believed, that the true
Secret of the greatest number of the 
Cardi∣nals

in the last 
Promotion,
 was the Advantages
that he made by the sale of the 
Offices
 which
they held, and that fell to the 
Pope
 upon their
Advancement; out of which it was thought
that he gained above a 
Million:
 and upon
this I will tell you, what I have learned con∣cerning
the aversion that two of the 
Cardinals,
Taia
 and 
Ricci,
 expressed to the 
Purple
 in the

Promotion
 that was made five year ago; this
was magnified in several Books, that were
printed out of 
Italy,
 as somewhat that seemed
to approach to the best Ages of the Primitive
Times, when men refused to accept of so
great a 
Dignity,
 that brought them within a
step of the 
Supream Elevation:
 but the truth
of this matter was, they were both men of

Fourscore,
 and not like to live long; as they
both died within a year of their Preferment:
they had very good Imployments, which
they had bought, and which by their accep∣ting
the 
Purple
 were to fall into the 
Popes

hands: besides that, the new 
Dignity
 was not


to be entred upon without a great Expence:
so all this being considered, the vertue of re∣fusing
so chargeable a 
Dignity,
 in men that
were more concerned for their 
Families,
 than
for that small remnant of life that was before
them, was not so very Extraordinary.


But since I am upon the discourse of 
promo∣ting

of 
Cardinals,
 I will tell you a remarkable
Instance of a 
Promotion,
 that I do not remem∣ber
to have met with in any 
Book;
 and the Dig∣nity
of the 
Person
 and of the 
Family
 descended
from him makes me think it worth the rela∣ting;
and the rather because I had it from no
ordinary person, but from one of the exactest
men in 
Rome,
 and who has taken the greatest
pains to be well Informed in the 
Modern Hi∣story.

I had seen several pictures of 
Clara Far∣nese,

for there are more than one of them in the

Palestrina:
 so I knowing nothing concerning
her, asked her story, which in short was this:
that she was P. 
Paul
 the 
3d's Sister,
 and the
person to whom he owed his 
Cardinals Cap,

and by Consequence all that followed upon it,
tho he rewarded her ill for it; for he 
poysoned

both 
her
 and his 
Mother,
 that he might have
all their Wealth; their 
Father
 was a poor
man, that went about selling 
Saucidges
 and
such sort of stuff. 
Clara
 was married young,
and was soon a 
Widdow;
 she was a lovely wo∣man,
but no Extraordinary beauty: her 
Bro∣ther

was bred to Letters, and was one of those


poor 
Churchmen,
 that was looking about on all
hands where he might find a Patron; when of a
sudden his 
Sisters
 charms and her artifices toge∣ther
raised him to a height, to which he was far
enough from pretending at that time. On a
great occasion 
Clara Farnese
 was so near P. 
A∣lexander

the 6
th
, and was so much in his Eye &
in his thoughts, that he ordered one that was
about him, to enquire who she was, and where
she lived: Instruments upon such occasions are
never wanting to great Persons: and notwith∣standing
the 
Popes
 great Age, yet his Vices
hung still so close to him, that he could have
no quiet till 
Clara Farnese
 was brought him.
She resolved to manage her self on this occa∣sion,
and to raise her price all that was possi∣ble,
so a 
Cardinals Cap
 to her Brother was
both asked and granted: a promise of it was
made at least, upon which she came and atten∣ded
on the old leud 
Pope:
 yet when the next

Promotion
 came to be in agitation, the Propo∣sition
for 
Abbot Farnese
 was rejected by 
Cesar
Borgia
 with scorn; he had never been a slave to
his word, and he had no mind that his 
Father

should observe it on this occasion.


The way of a 
Promotion
 is this, the 
Pope

setles the 
List
 of the 
Cardinals,
 and writes
down all their names in a paper with his own
hand; and in a 
Consistory,
 when all other business
is ended, he throws down the 
Paper
 on the Ta∣ble,
and say's to the Cardinals, 
habetis Fratres;


you have now some Brethren.
 One of the 
Se∣cretaries

upon that takes up the Paper, and
reads the 
Names
 aloud; and the 
Sbiri
 are at
the door, and as soon as one is named, they run
for it, to see who shall be able to carry the first
newes of it to the party concerned.


Upon this occasion, the 
Pope
 after he had con∣certed
the 
Promotion
 with his 
Son,
 writ down
all the names. 
Clara Farnese
 was in great appre∣hensions
for her 
Brother,
 so she being to pass
that night with the 
Pope,
 rise when the old
man was fast asleep, & searched his Pocket, &
found the 
Paper,
 but her 
Brothers
 name was
not in it: then she set her self with great care to
counterfeit the 
Popes hand;
 and writ her 
Bro∣thers
name
 the first in the 
List:
 next morning
she kept the 
Pope
 as long in bed as was possi∣ble;
till word was brought him, that the 
Con∣sistory

was set, and that the 
Cardinals
 were all
come: for she reckoned that the less time that
the 
Pope
 had for being drest, there was the
less Danger of his looking into his 
Paper:
 So
without ever opening it, he went into the

Consistory,
 and according to Custom, he threw
down the 
list
 on the Table: but to the great
surprise of him, and of all that were upon his
Secrets, the first name that was read, was that
of 
Abbot Farnese;
 and it seems the 
Pope

thought it better to let the matter pass, than
to suffer the true secret of the business to break
out. It is well that the Doctrine of the Inten∣tion,


does not belong to the Creation of 
Car∣dinals,

otherwise here was a Nullity with a
Witness. Thus begun that long course of
P. 
Paul
 the 
thirds
 greatness, who lived above
50 
years
 after this, and laid the Foundation of
the Family of 
Parma,
 which he saw quite
overthrown, his 
Son
 being assassinated in his
own time; and both his 
Grand-children
 having
revolted against him, which, as was believed,
precipitated his death, tho he was then 
Four∣score.


But now I return to the present 
Pope;
 for I
have writ you a very loose sort of a 
Letter,
 all
made up of digressions. His aversion to the

Order
 of the 
Iesuites
 is very visible; for he takes
all occasions to mortify them; and every thing
that is proposed to him, thrives the worse
for their sakes, if he believes they are concer∣ned
in it; which was given by all at 
Rome,
 as
the true reason of the cold usage that the 
En∣glish
Ambassadour
 found there. Indeed the

Pope
 is not singular in the hard thoughts that
he has of that 
Order:
 I never saw an Indiffe∣rent
man in all 
Italy,
 that was of another mind:
they do generally look upon them as a Cove∣tous,
Fraudulent, Intriguing, and turbulent
sort of people; who can never be at quiet, un∣less
they 
reign:
 who are men of no Morals,
that will stick at nothing that may raise the
Wealth and Power of their 
Order:
 and at

Rome
 they do not stick to say, that all the con∣cerns


of the 
Roman Catholick Religion
 must
needs miscarry in 
England,
 because the 
Iesu∣ites

are so much in credit there. And indeed
the Extravagantly vain 
Letters
 that they write
to 
Rome
 out of 
England,
 are such contextures
of 
Legends,
 that ever since I saw them, I know
what value I ought to put on their 
Letters
 that
come from the 
Indies
 and other remote Coun∣treys;
for when they take so great a Liberty
when the Falsehood is so easily found out,
what must me think of the 
Relations
 that come
from places at such a distance, that they may lie
with more assurance & less hazard of discovery.


The 
Letter
 that was writ in 
February
 last
from 
Liege
 to the 
Iesuites
 at 
Friburg,
 of which
so many 
Copies
 were given, that it got to the
Press at last, was a good Instance of their Va∣nity,
and of the small regard that they have
to a 
Prince,
 that has as they give out, so much
for them. Their representing the 
King,
 as
so concerned in the 
Interests
 of their 
Order,

that he espoused them all as if they were his
own, that he was now become a 
Son of the
Society,
 and that he was received into a com∣munication
of the Merits of the 
Order,
 (tho
a share in their Treasure upon Earth were a
much more considerable thing, than of their
Treasure that is Invisible,) Their setting out
the 
Kings Zeal
 for their 
Religion,
 in such high
terms, that they say he is resolved to die a

Martyr
 rather than not to succeed in his de∣sign



of changing the Religion,
 and 
converting
the Nation:
 and this at a time when the 
King

was declaring himself so much for 
Liberty of
Conscience:
 and their affirming that the 
King

is become bigotted to so high a degree, as to
refuse to suffer a 
Priest
 to kneel down and do
the duty of a 
Subject
 in kissing his Hand,
and to tell him, 
that he himself ought rather to
kneel down, and to kiss his Hands:
 all these
are such Extravagant strains, that by the
boldness of them it is Evident, that they were
writ by a 
Iesuite,
 and my 
Copy
 came to me
from so good a hand, and so near the source,
that how many Falsehoods soever may be
in that 
Letter▪
 I can assure you, it is no Im∣posture,
but was really 
writ
 by those of 
Liege.


In a word, all the 
Romans
 have so very ill
an Opinion of the 
Iesuits,
 that as soon as any
piece of 
Newes
 comes from 
England,
 that is
not favourable to their Affairs, one finds all,
from the highest to the lowest, agree in the
same short reflection; 
Thus it must ever be,
where the Iesuites have such a share in the
Councils.
 A man long practised in the 
Court

of 
Rome,
 told me, it was impossible it could be
otherwise, for all the chief men of that 
Or∣der

are kept teaching in their 
Schools,
 till
they are almost forty 
years
 of age; and by
that means Pedantry, a disputatious and
Imperious humour, and a peevish littleness
of soul, becomes natural to them, so that an


Eminent man here said to me, 
It was Impos∣sible
that matters could go better than they did
in
 England, 
as long as the Morals and the Poli∣ticks
of the
 Jesuites, 
and the Vnderstandings
and Courage of the
 Irish, 
were so much relied
on.


But besides all these General Considera∣tions,
there are some things in the Constitu∣tion
of the 
Order
 of the 
Iesuites
 that give
those at 
Rome
 reason enough to be on their
Guard against them. There are two things
peculiar to this 
Order
 that make it very for∣midable;
the one is, that those who have
made the fourth 
vow
 are capable of no Pre∣ferment,
unless it be to be 
Cardinals,
 and
then they are indeed capable of 
Bishopricks.

In most of the other 
Orders,
 every man has his
own private Interest, and his particular
views; so that they are not always looking
after the concerns of their 
Order.
 But a

Iesuite
 can receive no Honour but from his

Order,
 therefore he Consecrates himself to
it, and advances the 
Interests
 of the 
Society

with all possible zeal, knowing that there
is no other way left him to advance his own

Interests,
 but this. So that Hope being one
of the great Springs of humane Nature, a

Iesuite,
 who hopes for nothing but from his

Order,
 must be extreamly devoted to it. Be∣sides
this, a 
Iesuite
 fears nothing but from
his 
Order:
 They have not a 
Cardinal Pro∣tector,



as the other 
Orders
 have, to whom
an Appeal lies from the sentence of the 
Ge∣neral

of the 
Order:
 but the 
Iesuites
 are a body
more shut up within themselves; for the
sentence of the 
General
 is definitive, and can
never be reviewed, no 
Appeal
 lying from it:
whensoever a 
Pope
 comes that dares mortify
them, he will open a way for 
Appeals,
 for
till that is done, the 
General
 of the 
Iesuites
 is
the most Absolute and the most Arbitrary
Soveraign that is in the World.


All these things concur to Unite almost
all the several 
Interests
 in 
Rome
 against this

Society,
 which yet is strong enough to sup∣port
it self against them all: they have the

Mission
 generally in their hands; for the Con∣gregation

de Propaganda,
 payes a small pen∣sion
of 20 
Crowns
 to all the 
Secular Priests

that are on the 
Mission,
 whereas the 
Iesuites

bear the expences of their own 
Missionaries,

to whom they allow an 100 
Crowns
 a year: &
so those of the 
Propaganda
 being willing to be
eased of a charge, accept of the 
Missionaries

that the 
Iesuites
 offer them: and they find
their account in this. Their 
Missionaries
 are
powerfully recommended, so they are quickly
received into 
Families,
 especially where there
are yong 
children
 to be bred up, or 
Estates

to be managed: for in these two lies their
strength: but they never forget their 
Order,

for which they are as so many 
Factors
 every


where: and they draw vast Presents from all
places to the 
House
 that returns them their
Appointments; wheras the poor 
Secular Priest

must make a shift to live out of the small al∣lowance
that he has from the Congregation

de Propaganda fide,
 and out of what he can
raise by his 
Masses.
 Therefore there is nothing
that they desire so much, as to see 
Protestant
States
 that give a Tolerance to 
Popery,
 grow
once so wise as to shut out all the 
Regulars,
 and
above all the 
Iesuites;
 and to admit none but

Secular Priests:
 for the former, as they are
so many 
Agents,
 to return all the wealth that
they can possibly draw together, to the 
house

to which they belong, so they are united to∣gether
in one Body, under a most strict O∣bedience
to their 
General,
 which may be as
great a prejudice to the Peace and Security of
a 
Countrey,
 as the other is to its Wealth and
Abundance: on the other hand, the 
Secular
Priests
 are generally good-natured men, who
are only subject to their 
Bishop,
 and that have
no designs upon the 
Government,
 nor the Con∣cerns
of any 
House
 that is in 
Forreign Parts

lying upon them: so that since those of that
Communion have the full exercise and all the
Consolation of their Religion from 
Secular
Priests,
 even those in 
Rome
 it self wonder at the
Error of 
Protestant States,
 who have not
Learned long ago to make this difference in
the Toleration that they allow: And one that


has been almost 
50 years
 in the most refined
practices of the 
Court of Rome,
 said to me
with a very sensible concern, 
how happy
would we here reckon our selves, if we
could have a Toleration of our Religion allo∣wed
in
 England, 
tho it were with an Eter∣nal
Exclusion of all Regulars and Iesuites?
 and
added, that if he saw good grounds for ma∣king
it, he himself would go and carry the
Proposition to those of the 
Propagan∣da.


And now I am sure, I have rambled over
a great Variety of matter, and have made
a shift to bring in to one place or other
of this 
Letter,
 a great many particulars,
that I could have hardly brought out in an
exactness of Method, without a much grea∣ter
compass of words, and a greater stifness of
form: but I thought it was more natural, and
by consequence, that it would be more accep∣table
to you, to make them follow one ano∣ther,
in an easy and unforced contexture. I
have discoursed all these matters often over
and over again since I came into 
Italy:
 but
I have read very little concerning them; there∣fore
there may be many things here, that
I mention because they were new to me,
that perhaps are no newes to those that are
much more Learned than my self. I have told
you all that I could gather upon these sub∣jects
from the wisest and worthiest men that


I found here: I have writ of all matters
freely to you, because I am in a Countrey
where freedom of discourse, in matters of

State
 especially, is practised in its utmost
extent.


I have yet matter for another long 
letter,

in which the matters of 
Religion
 will have
no share; for I will end all these in this:
and therfore there is one piece of the 
Super∣stition

of 
Lombardy,
 that affected me too sen∣sibly,
not to lead me to bestow a severe cen∣sure
upon it. I went through that Coun∣try
in 
October
 and 
November,
 and was often
in great distress, because it was not possible
to find a Glass of 
Wine,
 that could be drunk,
all being either dead or sour. At 
Parma
 I
waited on an Eminent 
Person,
 and lamented
to him the misery of 
Travallers,
 since no

Wine
 was to be found that could be drunk:
he told me, the 
Natives
 felt this much more
sensibly than 
Strangers
 did, with whom it
was soon over, but they were condemned
to suffer that every 
year;
 and tho he himself
had 
Vineyards,
 that produced much more
Wine than he could consume, yet he could
not be Master of a good Glass of 
Wine,
 for a
great many 
Months
 of the year; since all
the 
people
 were possessed with this 
Superstition,

that it was Indispensably necessary to mix it
with 
Water
 in the 
Cask,
 that by this means
it drunk 
dead
 or 
sour
 for so great a part of the



year:
 and all that could be said could not beat
this out of the heads of those that dressed their

Wine:
 but he added, that the 
Priests,
 who con∣firmed
the 
vulgar
 in this Conceit, had found
a Device to excuse their own 
Wine
 from this
hard fate: for they said, it must needs be kept
unmixed, since in the 
Sacrament
 the 
Wine
 must
be pure, and is then only to be mixed with

Water;
 and thus in all their 
Cellars
 good 
Wine

is to be found, where there is not a drop any
where else that can be drunk: one would think
that this is to abuse the Weakness and Credu∣lity
of the 
People,
 a little too grosly, when
they condemn all the 
laity
 to drink ill 
Wine,

whereas they themselves drink it pure, which
is felt more sensibly by the 
Laity,
 than the
depriving them of the 
Chalice,
 and the en∣grossing
it to the 
Priest
 in the 
Sacrament.

Yet the 
Excise
 that is laid on the 
Wine
 in

Florence,
 has taught the Inhabitants a point
of Wisdom, that those on the other side of
the 
Appenins
 are not capable of; for the

Excise
 being raised upon all their 
Wine,
 the

People
 who have no mind to pay 
Excise
 for

Water,
 keep their 
Wine
 pure, so perhaps
some such severity in the Government in

Lombardy,
 may likewise reform them in this
piece of absurd 
Superstition,
 which I felt too
sensibly with all the effects that naturally fol∣low
the drinking of sour Liquor, not to Insist
upon it with some more than ordinary con∣cern.



But since I am upon the point, of the 
Arts

that the 
Convents
 have to live easy, I will end
this 
Letter
 with an account of a 
House
 that
was very Extraordinary, which I saw in my
way to 
Italy
 thro 
Bavaria; Etal,
 an Abbey
of 
Benedictines,
 that by its foundation is
bound only to maintain an 
Abbot
 and 25

Monks.
 It was founded by 
Lewis
 Duke of

Bavaria,
 that was 
Emperour:
 the building
is not answerable to the Endowment, which
is so vast, that they keep a 
stable
 of 150 
horses,

which is indeed one of the best in 
Germany,

the 
horses
 are of great value, and well kept:
they hunt perpetually, and live in as great an
abundance of all things as the 
Duke
 of 
Ba∣varia

himself can do; and yet these are

Religious men,
 that are dead to the World.


I cannot forget to tell you a very beau∣tifully
diversified 
prospect
 that we had at

Burgo,
 a little 
Town
 in the hills of 
Trent,
 as
we lookt out at window, We saw before
us a lovely 
Meadow
 in all the Beauty and
Pride of the 
Moneth
 of 
May:
 a little beyond
that was a rising 
Bank
 all covered over with

Trees
 in their full verdure: beyond that the
ground rise higher, and the 
Trees
 had not
yet put out their leaves, and things lookt
dead and dry, as after Harvest: and beyond that
there was a huge 
hill,
 all covered on the top
with 
snow:
 so that here we saw in one pro∣spect
all the 
seasons
 of the 
year:
 upon which


one of the Company made this reflection,
that if any 
Painter
 should in one 
Landskip;

mix all these things, that were then in our
eye, he would be thought a man of an Ir∣regular
fancy, whose designes did not agree
with nature; and yet we had them all then
before us. I will make no Excuses nor Com∣pliments:
for those things do not mend
matters, and therefore I send you my 
Let∣ter,

such as it is, just as it has grown under
my Pen: and so 
Adieu.




POSTSCRIPT.


I find I have forgot to mention one very
extravagant piece of 
Devotion,
 to which
I was a Witness at 
Rome,
 on the 17 of 
Ianuary,

which is St. 
Anthonys day,
 that was the great

Father
 of the Monastick 
Orders,
 whose Life
is pretended to be writ by S. 
Athanase;
 all 
Hor∣ses

and other Beasts of Burden are believed to
be in an especial manner under his 
Protection:

and the 
Monks
 of his 
Order,
 have a House
near 
St. Maria Maggiore;
 thither all the 
Hor∣ses,
Mulets
 and 
Asses
 of 
Rome,
 and all round
the 
City,
 are brought that day to the door of
the 
Church,
 where some 
Monks
 stand with a
Broom in 
holy water,
 and sprinkle it upon
them all: many 
Doggs
 and 
Lambs,
 and other


favorite 
Animals,
 are also brought to share
in this 
Aspersion:
 which is believed to have
a most special vertue: the force of this hallo∣wing
is believed to be such, that if any should
fail to bring his 
Horses
 thither, all the Neigh∣bourhood
would look on those that have no
portion in it, as accursed 
Animals,
 upon
whom some unlucky Accident were hanging;
which is so firmly believed, that none would
hire a 
Horse
 or a 
Mulet,
 that had not been so
sprinkled. So that from the Popes 
Horses

down to the poorest man in 
Rome,
 all are
brought thither; but this is not all, the profi∣table
part of this piece of Folly is, that every
one brings a Present; the richer sort send
Purses of 
Money;
 some give great Wax-
Lights,

all stuck full of 
Testons
 (a piece of
20 pence) the poorer bring either smaller
pieces of 
Money,
 or Presents of 
Wine, Oyl,
Bread,
 or such things as they can afford: but
in a Word, no man comes empty; so that
this is the Market-day of those 
Monks,
 in
which for some 
Gallons
 of 
Water
 and 
Salt,

they get more Presents, than would serve
to maintain them for seven 
years:
 they quick∣ly
convert all that is not necessary for
them into 
Money:
 and by this means they
are vastly rich. When I saw all this, I
could not but think that 
men
 must become
first 
Beasts
 themselves, before things of this
kind could pass upon them: but since I have


added this in a 
Postscript,
 rather than give my
self the trouble to make it come in perti∣nently
into my 
Letter
 I will add another par∣ticular
that is writ me from 
Rome
 the sixth of

October
 1687.


I am told, that men are now more puzled
in their thoughts with Relation to the business
of 
Molinos
 than ever. It was Visible that his

Abjuration
 was only a pretended thing; for
in effect he has abjured nothing: his party be∣lieve,
that they are very numerous, not only
in 
Rome, Italy, Spain,
 and 
France,
 and in
all these parts of the world, but that they
have many followers even in 
America
 it self:
one sees now in almost all the 
Churches
 in

Rome
 some of them 
praying
 in corners, with
their Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven,
and all in Tears, and Sighs; which is no
small trouble to those who thought they had
quite routed them: but find they are not so
much quasht as it was thought they would
have been by the mock Triumph that was
made upon 
Molinos.
 Nor do they believe a
word of those Reports that are spread of his
Leudness: they say, there was no Proof ever
brought of it; and that there are many 
thou∣sands

in 
Rome,
 of both sexes, that conversed
much with him, who have all possible reason
to conclude, that all these stories that were
given out concerning him, are Impudent Ca∣lumnies,
set about only to blast 
Him
 and his



Doctrine:
 and the truth is, this seems to be
much confirmed by the 
Bull
 that condemns
his 
Books,
 and his 
Doctrine;
 in which no
mention is made of his ill 
Life
 and 
Hypocrisy,

which had been very probably done if the
matter had been well proved: since this would
not only have satisfied people, with relation
to him, but would have very much confir∣med
the Accusations of those horrid 
Opinions

that are laid to his Charge, Which had ap∣peared
with much more Evidence, if it had
been found that his 
Life
 had agreed with
those 
Tenets:
 for tho it had not been a just
Inference to conclude him guilty of those
things, because they were charged on him
in the 
Bull,
 yet one may reckon it almost a
sure Inference, that he is not guilty of them,
since the 
Bull
 does not tax him for them.










A THIRD
LETTER,
Concerning some of the
STATES
OF
ITALY;
And of their present Interest and
Policy.


SIR;


I
 Threw into my former 
Letter,

all those general 
Reflections
 on
the State of 
Religion,
 and the
Maxims of the 
Romans,
 con∣cerning
it, that I could gather
together during my Stay at 
Rome.

Now I quit that subject, and shall at present


entertain you with some 
Political Observa∣tions,

which will be so much the more accep∣table,
because I fancy they will be new to
you.


But before I go so far as 
Italy,
 I will give
you an account of a very curious 
Salt-work,

that I saw in my way to 
Italy,
 at 
Sode
 near

Francfort.
 It belongs to Mr. 
Malapert,
 and
has been wrought above 60 
years;
 but the
present Master of it, as he is a man of great
worth, so he is very Ingenious, and has
much perfected that, which was managed at a
much greater Expence before he undertook it.
There rises at the foot of some little 
Hills,

which produce a very good 
Wine,
 a 
Spring
of Water,
 that is so very little brackish to the
tast, that one will hardly think it possible to
fetch much 
Salt
 out of it; yet it has such a tast
of 
Salt,
 that there was room for Industry to
prepare this 
Water,
 so that without such an
expence in Fire as should eat out the profit,
it might turn to a good account; which Mr.

Malapert
 seems to have carried as far as is
possible. The 
Meadow
 that lies in the levil
with this 
Spring,
 is Impregnate with 
Salt,
Iron, Nitre,
 and 
Sulphur:
 but 
Salt
 is that
which prevails: 
first
 then, a Pump is put upon
this 
Spring,
 which is managed by a Water∣mil,
and throws up the Water about fifteen
Foot high; and then it goes by a Pipe into
vast 
Machines,
 that are made to receive it.



There is a great piece of ground Inclosed,
in which there are 24 vast 
Chests
 or 
Cisterns
 for
the 
Water,
 in two 
stories,
 12 in a story, the
one just over the other; they are about 
seventy

foot long, 
twelve
 broad, and 
two
 deep; over
every one of these, there is a roof of boards,
supported by wooden Pillars, of 12 foot high;
which covers them from 
Rain
-water, but yet
the water within them is in a full exposition
to the Sun; those roofs are hung with straw,
upon which some that manage the work, are
often throwing up the 
Water,
 so that a great
deal of the 
Phlegme
 is Imbibed by the Straw,
and the more fixed parts fall down: according
to the heat of the Season, this Evaporation of
the watry parts, goes quicker or slower; there
is a 
Gage,
 by which they 
Weigh
 the Water;
and so they know how the Evaporation
advances; it is of 
Silver,
 and is so made, that
according to the weight of the 
Water,
 it sinks
in it to such a depth; & so by the degrees markt
upon it, they know how heavy the 
Water
 is:
according then to the heat of the season, and
the progress of the Evaporation, they let the

Water
 out of one 
Cistern
 into another, by a

Pipe,
 and when it has past thro the 12 that are in
the upper story, then it is conveyed down by

Pipes
 into the 12 that are below, and in them
all they continue still to throw up the water
upon the Withs of Straw, that are over head.


In a word, this 
Evaporation
 discharges the



Water
 of so much of its 
Phlegin,
 that the same
quantity of water, that weighed one ounce
when it was drawn from the 
Spring,
 weighs
six ounces in this last Chest: and all this rolling
about of the Water from Chest to Chest lasts
sometimes not above twenty 
day's;
 but if
the season is only moderately hot, it will be
longer a doing; sometimes it will not be done
in a 
month's
 time: after that the 
Water
 is
brought to a very considerable degree of 
Salt∣ness,

it is conveyed into two great 
Cauldrons,

that are 13 foot long, ten broad, & 3½ deep; un∣der
which there are vast 
Furnaces,
 where in a
most violent 
Fire
 of 11 or 12 hours continuance,
the 
Water
 receives its last Evaporation; & when
that is done, the 
Salt
 which is become thick,
but is still moist, is taken up in Baskets of
Willows, and placed about the wall of the

Furnace:
 and so the humidity that remains in
it drops out, and it is brought to its last degree
of perfection: out of it, a 
Tyth
 is payed; of
which the 
Elector
 of 
Ments
 has one half, and
the 
City
 of 
Francfort
 the other. This 
Salt
 is
exceeding good and pleasant to the tast. It
is much solider and more like the 
Portugal
Salt,
 than like our 
Newcastle salt.
 It ser∣veth
very well all the uses of the 
Kitchin,

and 
Table:
 but it has not strength enough to
preserve things long. There are vast quanti∣ties
made of it in hot and dry Summers: for
the 
Chests
 are always kept full: and thus all



Franconia
 is furnished with 
Salt
 of its own
Production at very moderate rates; for there
is so great a lessening of the Expence of the
fire by this conveyance of the water thro so
many Chests, that it is afforded very cheap.
This I thought deserved well that I should
Interrupt the earnestness in which you be, to
hear what I have to tell you concerning 
Italy,

so that I hope you will not be ill pleased with
it, especially if your curiosity after the Histo∣ry
of nature is as great as it was.


I now go over in one step all the 
Iourney

that I made from hence to 
Italy,
 which is cer∣tainly
the 
highest
 scituated Country in 
Europe:

for as the 
Rhine
 and 
Danube,
 that rise in the

Alpes,
 and run down to the 
Ocean
 and the

Euxine,
 shewes you that all that tract of
ground to those Seas is a constant descent,
so when one comes to the 
Alpes,
 either on the

French
 or on the 
German
 side, he is a great
many days in climbing up those vast 
moun∣tains,

but the descent on the 
Italian
 side is
very Inconsiderable. This appears yet more
sensible when one comes from 
Turin,
 where
the ascent up Mount 
Senice
 is but a work of
a few hours: and yet from the height of that

hill,
 one is in a constant descent till he comes
to 
Lions.
 I will not carry you about 
Italy,
 to
tell you the remarkable things that are there;
but will only tell you some particulars that
made the greatest Impression on my self, and


which were not seen by Dr. 
Burnet.


In my way from 
Parma
 to 
Mantua,
 I past at

Guastale,
 which is half way between them, 18
miles distant from both; where I saw a scene
that surprised me. This 
Town
 is situated on
the southside of the 
Po,
 at half a miles distance
from it: It was a considerable branch of the
Territory of 
Mantua,
 that was given off to one
of the 
Cadets
 of that 
Family,
 and was setled in
an intail to the 
Heir male.
 The best part of
the Revenue of this small 
Principality,
 was a
Duty that was payed for all 
merchandises
 that
went or came upon the 
Po,
 which when the
Trade of 
Italy
 was in a more flourishing condi∣tion
than it is at present, was farmed for above
Threescore thousand 
Crowns.
 The situation
of this 
place
 makes it yet much more conside∣rable
than it is in it self; for as it lies in the
neighbourhood of the Principalities of 
Parma

and 
Modena,
 and is not far from the 
Popes

Territory, so if this place is Master of the 
Po,

by crossing it, the detachments that may be
sent out from it are not only in the Territory
of 
Mantua,
 but they may be also in a very few
hours both in the 
Milanese
 and in the 
Vene∣tian

Dominion; so that 
Guastale
 in some respect
may be esteemed the 
Center
 of all the 
States
 of

Lombardy.
 The Duke of 
Mantua
 married
the Daughter of the last Duke of 
Guastalé,

who died in the year 1680. and his 
Nephew

Don 
Vespasiano Gonzaga,
 who was then in


the 
Spanish
 service, was acknowledged to be
his undoubted 
Heir:
 so he came & took peace∣able
possession of his 
Dutchy:
 He was ex∣treamly
much beloved by his 
Subjects,
 and
thought himself at quiet in the enjoyment of
his new Dignity: but all this was soon over∣turned;
for one came to him from the 
Court
of France,
 to let him know, that that 
Great
King
 could not be wanting to his 
Ally
 the
Duke of 
Mantua,
 to whom 
Guastale
 be∣longed
of right, his 
Dutchess
 being the
Daughter and 
Heir
 of the late 
Duke,
 and that
therefore since he had usurped the just right
of another, the 
French King
 warned him, that
if he did not withdraw of his own accord, he
would give order to put the D. of 
Mantua
 in
possession. It was to no purpose to argue
against all this, and to shew the Messenger
that 
Guastale
 was a 
Fee
 intailed on the 
Heir
male,
 of which there had never been the least
dispute: But reasons taken from the equity
of the thing, are seldom thought strong
enough to hold the ballance against reasons
of State: so the poor 
Prince
 being in no con∣dition
to resist so powerful an Enemy, was
forced to abandon his Right, and to with∣draw,
and he was again entertained by the

Spaniards.
 For tho there was a sort of a 
for∣tification

cast about 
Guastale
 50 or 60 year
ago, yet as that was at best an Inconsidera∣ble
defence, so even that was now quite rui∣ned.


Upon his retiring there came a detache∣ment
of 300 Men from 
Cassale,
 who took pos∣session
of 
Guastale,
 and continue there to this
day: but this had been no great matter, if it
had not gone further: some years passed
after the new 
Duke
 was driven away before
the true design of this matter appeared. The
world was first to be laid to sleep. The 
Town

it self is composed of about six or seven thou∣sand

Inhabitants;
 and so the small 
Garrison
 in
it seemed of no great Consequence, and was
rather an Advantage than a prejudice to the

Town;
 they were kept in very good order, and
they payed punctually for every thing that
they called for: only they brought the place in∣to
the Method of a 
Garrison;
 for all must come
in and go out of the 
Town
 only at one Gate.


But in the beginning of the year 1686. the
mystery of this matter begun to appear: for
Mr. du 
Plessis,
 a French 
Engineer,
 came
thither, under the pretence of repairing the
old 
Fortifications,
 and designed a Noble and a
Regular 
Fortification:
 It is to be a 
Hexagone,

with all necessary Out-works; and there is a
great 
Splanade
 that is to be made round the
place, and all the houses or trees that are with∣in
a considerable distance are to be beat
down. In a word, the design is great, and will
be executed in all the exactness of the 
modern

Fortification; so that the advantage of the

situation,
 will make it the most Important


place of 
Italy,
 and that which will bridle all

Lombardy,
 and be able to put it all under Con∣tribution
upon every occasion. The Works
were begun in April 1686. and ever since they
have kept 400 
men
 constantly at work, upon
the pay of a 
Iulio
 a day: another year will go
near to finish it. And yet tho here the justest
ground possible, is given to alarm all 
Italy,

none seems to be so much as concerned at it.
The 
Venetians,
 that have at all other times,
valued themselves upon their prospect of Dan∣ger,
even at the greatest distance, either do
not see this, or dare not own their fear. It
is true, all this is carried on in the name of
the D. of 
Mantua:
 but it is as certain, that
tho it lies so near him, he has never been at
the pains to go and see it: It has never been
so much as once considered by his 
Council;
 nor
is his 
Revenue
 in such a condition as to bear
such an encrease of Expence: and yet it passes
among the people there, that this is a great
strength, that is to be made to keep the 
French

out of 
Italy;
 and some 
Priests
 that are corrup∣ted
to serve the 
French Interests
 promote this
Fiction. If the 
Venetians
 look on till this is fi∣nished,
they will do very well to assure them∣selves
of their new Conquests in the 
Morea,

for their Antient ones in the 
Terra firma
 of

Italy
 will probably fail them very quickly.


All those of the 
Territory,
 who know well
that their 
Princes
 name is only made use of,


for the 
fortifying
 this place, look on with
great regret, while they see a Work advan∣cing
so fast, that is to be a 
Citadel
 upon all their

Countrey:
 of which an Ancient 
Person
 of 
Qua∣lity,

that is there spoke to me with so much
feeling, that he could hardly forbear weeping,
when he shewed me that Yoke of Slavery un∣der
which they were falling. I saw, during
my stay in 
Mantua,
 how much all the sensible
people there, are concerned to see their 
Prince

deliver himself up so blindly to the 
French In∣terests:

they told me, that since his 
childhood

he has been so beset with the 
Instruments
 and

Agents
 of that 
Court,
 that his Inclinations for
them are become as another nature in him: he
was not out of 
Childhood,
 when almost all
his 
Domesticks,
 and his 
masters,
 both for 
Lan∣guages

and 
Armes,
 were furnished him from
thence. His putting 
Cassale
 in the hands of
that 
Monarch,
 was one good Evidence, and
now the business of 
Guastale
 is another, to
shew that they have gained such an Ascendant
over his Spirit, and have Insinuated them∣selves
so much into him, in all those fatal
hours of Liberty which he allows himself, that
it is not thought he will stick at any thing that
they demand of him, unless it be at his own
going into 
France;
 to which he has been
much solicited: but it is not so much as doubt∣ed,
that if he goes once into that 
Countrey,

he will never come out of it again. So he is


not like to be wrought on so far; and if it
were not for some such apprehension, it is
like enough that he might undertake the
Journey; for he does not love staying in his

Principality
 so well, but takes pleasure to
ramble about; and he devests himself often
of the Ceremonies of his 
Greatness,
 that so he
may take a freer career in those 
Exerci∣ses,

that he loves better than his 
Affairs:

and a 
Prince,
 whose 
Revenue
 is none of the
greatest, and whose expence is often Irregular,
who has an active 
Envoy
 always near him,
and who is ever ready to furnish him with

Money,
 falls naturally into a great dependence
on that 
Court.


Of this a very Extraordinary Instance ap∣peared
not long ago, in the Disgrace of the
Marquisses of 
Cannosse
 and 
Palliotti:
 the first
of these is his 
Kinsman,
 and has served him
now for many years, with as much Fide∣lity
as Affection; the second was 
Captain
 of
his 
Guards,
 and 
Governour
 of the Castle of

Mantua
 which commands the 
Town.
 These
then had the Courage as well as the Fidelity,
to lay before him the Ruin that he was like
to bring upon himself as well as upon all 
Italy,

by delivering himself up so intirely to the

French Councils,
 and by putting them first
in possession of 
Guastale,
 and now suffering
then to 
Fortify
 it, which was in effect the
delivering up of his 
Principality,
 and of all


his 
People
 to them; who looked upon them∣selves
as brought already under a 
Forreign

Yoke: they also represented to him the dan∣ger
of having almost no other 
Domesticks
 but

Frenchmen
 about him, who were all as so
many 
Spies
 upon him, and upon all that were
near him, and that were very exact in giving
the 
French Envoy
 Mr. 
Baumbeau
 an account
of every thing that he either said or did. These
Demonstrances made some Impressions on the

Duke,
 and he promised to them to find out
an effectuall Remedy to all those Evils:
But this was not a secret very long; 
Money

and 
Spies
 find out every thing; and it is possible
that they who gave the 
Duke
 these faithfull
Advices might have been engaged to it, either
by some Instruments of the Court of 
Spain,

or of the Republick of 
Venice:
 yet the truth
of this is not known, but the 
French Envoy

made a shift to charge them so heavily, that
he got them 
both
 to be made close 
Prisoners;

in this condition they were when I was at

Mantua,
 and no body durst so much as men∣tion
their Names, much less Interpose for
them.


All the 
Princes
 of 
Italy,
 are as 
Absolute

in their own 
Dominions,
 and as much de∣livered
from all the bonds of 
Law,
 as some
greater 
Kings
 are, so their 
subjects
 are at their
Mercy, both for their 
Lives, Liberties,
 and

Estates:
 and this is that from which one may


take a sure measure of the weakness of 
Italy.
Subjects
 that retain still all the due liberties of
humane nature, and that are not under an

Arbitrary
 but a 
Legall
 Government; fight for
themselves, as well as for their 
Prince;
 but if
they are already as miserable as they can be,
so that a change may perhaps put them in a
better condition, but can hardly put them in
a worse, they will not much concern them∣selves
in their 
Princes
 Quarrel, since they only
fight for the continuance, if not for the en∣crease
of their Slavery.


But now to return to the Duke of 
Mantua;

the 
French Envoy
 has since that time stuck
closer to him than ever; he indeed waits
always on him, sometimes acting like an 
Officer

of his Houshold, and at other times like the

Governour
 of his Person: he made the tour of

Italy
 with him this 
year,
 and waited on him
to 
Millan, Genoa, Florence, Rome, Naples

and 
Venice,
 where they passed the 
Carnavall

together: and he took a most particular care
that the 
Duke
 should meet with none in all
those places, that might open his eyes, to
let him see the Ruin that he is bringing upon
himself; yet after all, one of his 
Secretaries,

had still the Integrity and Courage to give
him such faithful Councels, as had been fatal
to others: yet the 
Duke
 used him better than
he had done the two 
Marquisses:
 for tho the

French Spies
 discovered him likewise, yet,


nothing could be done to hurt him in the

Dukes
 good opinion, therefore it was resolved
to take another method to tear so dangerous
a man from him; so he being sent to negotiate
some business at the 
Court
 of 
Turin,
 was often
invited to go a Hunting, which he resisted for
a great while, tho the 
French Ambassadour

pressed him much to it; at last he was over∣come,
but his sport was fatal to him; for he
was seised on, and carried by a small 
Party

sent from 
Pignarol
 as is believed. In short,
he is in the hands of the 
French,
 and it is said
in 
Italy,
 that he is clapt up in St. 
Margarite
 one
of the little 
Islands
 in the 
Mediterranean sea.

This matter was at first highly resented by
the 
Duke,
 but a little time will shew whether
the earesses of the 
Court
 of 
France
 can soften
him in this matter or not; for if they can lay
him asleep after such an Attempt, then all
persons will conclude that he is so much in
their power, that none will dare to run
the hazard of undeceiving him any more.


Those in the 
Mountferrat
 feel what a Neigh∣bour

Cassal
 is to them; that Imperious way
of proceeding, without having any great re∣gard
to Justice, or to Contracts and Aggree∣ments,
that is practised in 
France,
 begins to
be felt here likewise: of which many smaller
Instances were given me, but I will tell you
two that were more remarkable; when the

Garrison
 was first setled in 
Cassal,
 those of the



Mountferrat
 held the price of their 
Corn
 so high,
that it was hard to furnish the 
Garrison
 with

Bread:
 so some of 
Piedmont
 undertook to sup∣ply
them for two years at 21 
Livers
 the 
Ra∣tion,

and the bargain being made▪ they
bought in great stores, and so they quickly
filled their 
Granaries:
 upon this some in the

Mountferrat
 came and offered to serve the
Garrison at 
14 Livers
 the 
Ration,
 upon which
the other bargain tho made as sure as any such
contract can possibly be made, was broke,
and the undertakers were ruined by it. The
other story was, that in order to the building
the 
Fortifications,
 some 
Masons
 made a bargain
at 
32 Livers
 such a measure, so they brought
together a great number of Workmen, and
were at work; when others came and offer'd
to perform the work at 
28 Livers,
 for which
the others had 
32 Livers,
 only they deman∣ded
a considerable advance; so the first Bar∣gain
was presently broken, to the great loss of
the Undertakers: but the 2d Undertakers, that
had 
Money
 advanced them, found they had
made a Bargain that was too hard for them to
execute, so they ran away with the Money,
to the great joy of the Countrey. He that
told me this, said, that perhaps it surprised the

Italians,
 who were not yet acquainted with
such things; but nothing of that kind would
seem extraordinary in 
France,
 which was so
much accustomed to such a way of proceeding


that he gave me a particular account of so
many, that he had reason to know well, as
would fill a Book: but that which touched
him most sensibly, was the 
Fonds
 that was made
for an 
East-India Company,
 to which the 
King

gave in 
three Millions,
 with this positive
Assurance, that all the Losses and Dammage
of the 
Company
 should fall on that 
Stock.
 This
was a great encouragment to draw in men, to
put 
Money
 into the stock, and the 
Court
 set on
the Project with so much Zeal, that 
Letters

were writ to all the great Bodies and Towns
of 
France,
 that were considered rather as
Commands than Desires: yet after all were
engaged, upon the first occasion the 
Kings

three 
Millions
 were taken out of the stock,
and the rest were left to shift for themselves.


But I must here give you an account of a
very Extraordinary Transaction in the 
Court

of 
Turin,
 which is likewise thought an effect
of the Authority that the 
Councils
 of 
France

have likewise there. The Marquis 
de Pianesse

the 
son
 of him that set on the 
Massacre
 of the

Protestants
 in the Valleys of 
Piedmont
 34 years
ago, was in great favour with the late Duke
of 
Savoy,
 but the war of 
Genoa
 miscarried so
in his hands in the year 1672 that the 
Duke

could never forgive him that matter; of which
the Resentments were so quick when he
died, that he left a charge on 
Madame Royale,

never to forgive him, nor to Imploy


him: he upon his Disgrace retired into

France
 and was so well entertained there, that
he had Interest enough to procure a Recom∣mendation
from the 
King
 to the Dutchess of

Savoy
 in his favour; but her Excuse was so rea∣sonable,
being founded on the Orders she
had received from the 
Duke
 on his Death bed,
that there was no reply to be made to it: yet
afterwards a 
Nephew
 of his, the Count 
Massin,

was so happy in the 
Dutchesses
 favour, that he
found he only wanted a Head as able as his

Vncles
 was to support him in that credit, which
her favour gave him: and he was so much in
the good graces of 
Mad. Royale,
 that he at last
prevailed with her to bring his 
Vncle
 into the
chief 
Ministry;
 he being certainly one of the
ablest men that belongs to that 
Court;
 and the
pretence found to bring this about decently,
was, that the 
Dutchesse
 did secretly Intimate
to the 
Court
 of 
France,
 that she found it ne∣cessary
to Imploy the Marq. 
de Pianesse,
 and
therfore she desired that the 
King
 would renew
his recommendation of him, which being
done, he was received into the 
Ministry,
 and
had the chief stroke in all Affairs: he placed
another of his 
Nephews
 about the 
Duke,
 and
supported him so that he got very far into his
favour, so Mr. 
de Pianesse
 observing great
Disorders in the 
Government,
 and a great and
useless Consumption of the 
Revenue,
 he In∣structed
his 
Nephew
 that was about the 
Duke



so well, that he entertained the young 
Duke

often upon these heads, who was not then
15 year 
old:
 he shewed him how his 
Countrey

was ruined by his 
Mothers
 ill conduct, and
was always suggesting to him the Necessity
of his assuming the 
Government,
 and putting
an end to his 
Mothers
 Regency, which is a
discourse to which all Persons of that Age
have such a natural Inclination, that it was
no wonder if both 
Vncle
 and 
Nephew
 came
to believe that the 
Duke
 hearkned to the Pro∣position:
but the 
Duke
 thought it too hardy
a thing to venture on it, without consulting
it with some wiser heads; upon which Mr.

de Pianesses Nephew
 told him, that he would
bring his 
Vncle
 to him, who would conduct
the matter for him; for tho he had great obli∣gations
to 
Madam Royale,
 yet his Fidelity
to his 
Prince,
 and his Affection to his 
Countrey

overcame them all. This was a great sur∣prise
to the 
Duke,
 who looked on Mr. 
de
Pianesse
 as the person in the World, that
was the most obliged to his 
Mother,
 and
that was the most in her 
Interests:
 and it was
believed that the prejudice which this gave
him, blasted this whole design: yet he gave
him several Audiences in secret, and had
concerted with him the whole method, both
of assuming and managing the 
Government:

which was carried on so secretly, that there
was no suspition of the matter, till the day


before it was to break out, and that the 
Duke

was to withdraw himself from his 
Mother:

but then it was discovered, and the 
Duke
 to
reconcile himself to his 
Mother,
 sacrificed
the 
Marq. de Pianesse
 to her resentments:
he was not only Disgraced, and put in Pri∣son,
but his processe was made before the
Court of 
Parliament
 of 
Chambery,
 for ha∣ving
endeavoured to throw the 
Government

into a Confusion, by sowing of Division be∣tween
the 
Duke
 and his 
Mother:
 yet he defen∣ded
himself so well that he was acquitted, but
he continues still a Prisoner: upon his Dis∣grace,
there was none that durst oppose him∣self
to 
Mad. Royale,
 or offer any advices to the

Duke,
 so that the 
Court
 of 
Turin
 was as abso∣lutely
governed by the Directions that were
sent from the 
Court
 of 
France,
 as if the one
had been the 
Vassal,
 if not the 
Subject
 to the
other.


I will not prosecute this discourse to tell
you that which all 
Europe
 knows, of the de∣signed
Match with the 
Infanta
 of 
Portugal,
 by
which 
Savoy
 and 
Piedmont
 would have un∣doubtely
fallen into the hands of the 
French.

The breaking of this, and the 
Dukes
 being

Poysoned,
 as well as his 
Father
 had been, tho
his youth carried him thro it, are things too
well known, for you to be Ignorant of them.
It is true, those who 
Poysoned
 the present

Duke,
 have not been yet Discovered and pu∣nished,


as those were who poysoned his 
Fa∣ther.

While I was at 
Turin,
 there was a
discourse, that the 
Duke
 was reflecting on
the Wise Advices that Mr. 
de Pianesse
 had
given him, and that he Intended not only to
bring him out of 
prison,
 but to receive him
again into the 
Ministry,
 which is confirmed
to me since I left those parts. There is no∣thing
more Visible, than that the 
Dukes
 of

Savoy
 have sunk extreamly in this 
Age,

from the figure which they made in the 
last;

and how much soever they may have raised
their 
Titular
 Dignity, in having the Title
of 
Royal Highness
 given them, they have lost
as much in the 
Figure,
 that they made in the
affairs of 
Europe:
 and it is now almost too
late to think of a Remedy: for 
Pignerol
 and

Cassal
 are two very Inconvenient 
neighbours.

The truth is, the Vanity of this 
Title,
 and the
expenceful humour that their late 
Marria∣ges

with 
France
 has spread among them, have
undone them, for instead of keeping good

Troops
 and strong 
places,
 all the 
Revenue

goes to the keeping up of the Magnifi∣cence
of the 
Court;
 which is indeed very
splendid.


I will not ingage in a 
Relation
 of this last
Affair of the 
Valleys
 of 
Piedmont;
 for I could
not find particulars enough, to give you that
so distinctly as you may perhaps desire it. It
was all over, long before I came to 
Turin?



but this I found, that all the 
Court
 there, were
ashamed of the matter: aud they took pains
upon Strangers, not without some affectation,
to convince them that the 
Duke
 was very hard∣ly
drawn to it: that he was long pressed to it, by
the repeated Instances from the 
Court
 of

France;
 that he excused it, representing to
the 
Court
 of 
France
 the constant Fidelity of
those people ever since the last 
Edict
 of 
Paci∣fication,

and their great Industry, so that
they were the profitablest Subjects that the

Duke
 had, and that the body of men which
they had given his 
Father
 in the last War with

Genoa,
 had done great Service; for it saved
the whole Army: but all these Excuses were
without effect; for the 
Court
 of 
France
 having
broken its own 
Faith,
 that had been given to

Hereticks,
 and in that shewed, how true a
respect it pays to the 
Council
 of 
Constance,
 had
a mind to engage other 
Princes
 to follow this
new Pattern of 
Fidelity
 that it set the world:
so the 
Duke
 was not only pressed to extirpate
the 
Hereticks
 of those 
Valeys;
 but this
Threatning was added, that if he would not
do it, the 
King
 would send his own 
Troops
 to
extirpate 
Heresy;
 for he would not only not
suffer it in his own 
Kingdom,
 but would even
drive it out of his 
Neighbourhood.
 He who
told me all this, knowing of what Countrey I
was, added, that perhaps he would within a
little while send the like Messages to some o∣thers
of his Neighbours.



But to return to the expence that is made
in the 
Court
 of 
Turin,
 I cannot forget a dis∣course
that I had on this subject with a 
German,

that was a man of very good sense: he told me,
that nothing ruined the 
Empire
 so much, as
the great Magnificence which all the 
Princes

affected to keep up in their 
Courts;
 and the
Luxury in which they begun to live, which
had much corrupted the Antient Simplicity
and Gallantry of that great and Warlike

Nation.
 Not only the 
Nobility,
 but their very

Princes
 travel into 
France;
 and are so much
taken with the Splendor & Luxury that they
see there, that they return home quite spoiled
with the ill Impressions that this makes on
them. They carry home with them 
French-Cooks,

and all the contrivances of Pleasure
that are so much studied there, for the vitia∣ting
the minds of their 
Countreymen:
 and by a
vast Expence, they not only exhaust their

Revenue,
 and ruin their 
Subjects,
 but they
become so liable to corruption, that if their
Income at home cannot support their charge,
both their 
Princes
 and their 
Ministers
 are re∣duced,
as it were to the necessity of taking
Pensions, from those whose Instruments have
set on this Luxury, and whose Pensions will
still support it, till the 
Germans
 are suffi∣ciently
enervated by the Feebleness into
which all that Luxury must needs throw
them, and then they will despise and trample


upon them, as much as they do now Court
them. He who told me all this, added, that
the little 
Princes
 of the 
Empire,
 affected now
as much Splendor in their 
Courts
 as the 
Ele∣ctors

did in the last 
Age,
 and that the 
Electors

lived now in as much Magnificence as

Crowned Heads
 did formerly. But he carried
his Observation further, and having staied
some considerable time both in 
Switzerland

and 
Holland,
 he added, that Luxury and Ex∣pence
were wicked things even in 
Monar∣chys,

but they were fatal and destructive when
they got into 
Common-wealths;
 of which
the History of 
Lacedemon, Athens,
 and above
all of 
Rome,
 give proofs that are beyond
exception; for there is a 
Humility,
 a 
Sobriety,

and a 
Frugality,
 that is so necessary for their
preservation; that 
Kingdomes
 can be better-maintained
without 
Troops
 and strong 
Places,

than 
Common-wealths
 without these. An E∣mulation
in Expence, a Vanity in Clothes,
Furniture, or Entertainments, are so con∣trary
to all the principles upon which a 
Com∣mon-wealth

must be either built or preserved,
that he said, he thought that the 
Dutch
 had
lost more of their real Strength, by the Pro∣gress
that this Pest makes among them, than
by all the Expence of the 
last War,
 of
which they complain so much: and indeed
the men of Luxury and Vanity ought to be
driven out of 
Common-wealths,
 as publick


Enemies to the Constitution of the 
Govern∣ment:

since an irregular Profusion throws
them into Injustice and Oppression, and may
in time expose them to the Corruption of o∣ther

Princes,
 and dissolves that Industry and
Application for Affairs by which only they
can subsist: for all the 
Maximes
 that relate to
a 
Common-wealth,
 there is none more Indi∣spensable,
than 
that all men regulate their Ex∣pence,
so that it may not exceed their Income:

and therefore he admired that part of the

Venetian
 Constitution, that regulates the
Expence of their 
Nobility;
 and concluded,
that if the 
States
 and the 
Cantons
 did not put
an effectual stop to the Progress of those Dis∣orders
among them, the 
Figure
 that they had
made in all the Affairs of 
Europe,
 as it was in
a great degree already Eclipsed among the

Cantons,
 so would sink apace even in the

States;
 and this was all that was wanting,
to set up a 
new Monarchy
 in the 
West.


But I have got such a trick of making Di∣gressions,
that I find it is hardly possible for
me to hold long close to a point: there is
something in travelling, I fancy, that makes a
mans thoughts reel; and that leads his Pen to
wander about as much as his Person does: yet
I remember still what drew me into all this
ramble; It was the business of 
Guastale,
 and the

Court
 of 
Mantua
 that led me so far about. I
will say no more to you of the rest of 
Lombar∣dy;



nor will I enter into any description of

Tuscany;
 but shall only tell you one thing,
which both touched me much and pleased me
extreamly.


I need not inlarge to you on the Poverty &
Misery that appears in 
Pisa,
 where there re∣mains
yet enough to shew what they once
were, and how much they are now sunk from
what they were while they were a 
Free State:

but all this is much more sensible, when one
goes from hence to 
Lucca,
 which tho it has
not the advantage of situation that 
Pisa
 has,
yet is quite another sort of a place. The 
Town

is well built, full of 
People,
 and as full of 
Wealth:

the whole soil of this small 
State
 is well Culti∣vated
and is full of 
Villages,
 all the marks and
effects of 
Liberty
 appear, in an Universal Ci∣vility,
& a generous and frank way of living:
This is also the place of all 
Italy
 that is freest
of all Crimes and Publick Vices; they value
themselves upon nothing but their 
Liberty,
 of
which the 
State
 is so Jealous, that the frequent
change of their 
Magistrates,
 from two
Moneths to two Moneths, & the Restraint
in which they are kept while they bear 
Office,

they being indeed honorable Prisoners all the
while, have preserved that here, which so▪
many of their Neighbouring 
States
 have lost:
and as 
Liberty
 is engraven in 
Capital Letters,

upon the Publick Buildings of this 
State,

so it appears to be much deeper in all their


Hearts. One sees the Effects of their 
Wealth,

in all their 
Publick
 works, as well as in the

Fortifications
 of this place, which are much
better, and better kept than in any place I
saw in 
Italy,
 except 
Genoa.
 There is on the
inward side of the 
Ramparts,
 a noble 
Planta∣tion,

which is one of the beautifullest Deco∣rations
that belongs to this place; for as there
is a considerable space left void between the

Ramparts
 and the 
Buildings,
 so this is planted
all about the whole Town, with several
rows of Trees, which afford pleasant Walks,
and a lovely Shade, which is no small mat∣ter,
where they are exposed to so hot a
Sun.


I come in the last place to give you an account
of 
Genoa,
 which tho it is not able now to Com∣pete
as it did some Ages ago with the 
Repu∣blick

of 
Venice,
 yet is still a great Body and
full of Wealth; one that comes out of the

Popes Patrimony
 and 
Tuscany,
 into this nar∣row
border that lies between the 
Hills
 and the

Sea,
 should expect to find as great a diffe∣rence
between their abounding in People and
Wealth, as there is between the soil of these
two 
Countries:
 but he finds the change just
contrary to what in reason he ought to expect:
for all this edge of soil, is so full of 
Villages

and 
Towns,
 and there is so great a plenty of

Money
 and of every thing else here, that it
Amases a 
Traveller
 no less, than the abando∣ned
state of those other places.



The numbers of the subjects of this 
Repu∣blick,

are estimated to 330000 
Persons;
 which
are thus reckoned up; In the Town of 
Genoa

it self there are about 80000. 
Persons:
 in the

Villages
 and 
Towns
 that lie 
Westward
 there
are 120000. and 30000. in those that lie to
the 
East:
 and the 
Inhabitants
 of the Island of

Corsica
 are reckoned to be 100000. They keep
two small 
Forts
 in 
Corsica,
 one at 
Calvi
 on
that end that looks to 
Genoa,
 and another
at 
Boniface
 on the other end that looks
to 
Sardinia;
 for they have let S. 
Fiorenza
 and
some other small places go to ruin. These
two are considerable in themselves, and com∣mand
two very good Harbours; yet as the
building in 
Calvi
 are too much exposed and
too high, so 
Boniface
 is under a high Ground,
that is within musket shut of it, and that com∣mands
it: these places are now in a sad condi∣tion,
ill kept, and ill furnished both with
Men and Animunition, so that they could not
make a great Resistance, there being but
150 men in 
Calvi,
 and 200 in 
Boniface;
 and it
is believed, that the reason of their letting
S. 
Fiorenza
 go to ruin, is, the Greatness of
the Place, and the Expence of keeping it. The

Corses
 are extreamly brave, and have a Rage
in their courage, that would be much more
valueable and usefull than it is if they were
more governable, and could be brought un∣der
an exact Discipline: but they are unruly,


and as apt to Mutiny, when they see no Ene∣my,
as to fight well when it comes to that.
The compass of the 
Fortification
 of 
Genoa
 is
an amasing thing; for it runs all along the hills
in a compass of many miles, I was told it was
above 15 mile, & in the Expence that has been
laid out on this and on the two 
Moles,
 chiefly
the new one, one sees that this 
State
 spares
nothing which Publick safety or the Conve∣nience
of Trade do require: these Publick
Works has run the 
Republick
 into a vast debt;
for they owe above Nine Millions of 
Crowns

that are upon the 
Bank,
 besides several other
debts, in particular their great Debt to St.

Georges House;
 the greatest part of the 
Re∣venue

of this 
State
 stands engaged for the 
In∣terest

that they pay, so that tho the whole

Revenue
 amounts to 1200000 
Crowns,
 they
reckon that 900000 
Crowns
 of this is engaged,
so that they have only three hundred thou∣sand

Crowns
 clear for their whole Expence,
which is so small a matter, that it is no won∣der
if they are in a low condition, and can do
little upon so narrow a fond: their 
Revenue
 rises
chiefly out of an 
Excise
 that falls so equally
upon all the 
Subjects
 of this 
State,
 that they
reckon that every man in 
Genoa,
 payes six

Crowns
 a year to the 
State.
 The whole Land

Forces
 of this 
State
 were but 3500 men, yet
of late they have raised them up to 4000 men;
of which 2500 are the Garrison of the 
City,



and there are 600 in 
Savona,
 which after the

City
 it self is the most Important place that
belongs to this 
State:
 the extent of the whole

Countrey,
 that goes by the name of the 
River
of Genoa,
 is 180 
miles,
 of which 120 lie 
West∣ward,

and 60 lie 
Eastward;
 the 
Mountains

that are almost Impassible are thought a suf∣ficient
Defence to cover them from their
Neighbours in 
Lombardy,
 and from the Duke
of 
Savoy,
 and the State of 
Millan.
 It is true,
they have one 
Fort
 called 
Gavi,
 that is 25
miles distant from the 
Town,
 which has all
the advantages of sitution that are possible for
keeping the Passes thro the Mountains: but
as they keep only a Garrison of 120 men in
it, so all things in it are so neglected, that
it could make no considerable Resistance to
an Enemy that could attack in vigorously.
In short, the strength of this 
State
 is very
Inconsiderable, their 
Souldiers
 are ill Disci∣plined,
their 
Officers
 want Experience, and
they have no good 
Engineers;
 the New 
Mole

is indeed a vast work, built out into the 
Sea

seven fathom deep, and there are an hundred
pieces of 
Cannon
 on it to defend the Old Mole;
their Naval forces consist in six 
Galleys,
 and
and two Men of 
War;
 but these are not kept
as Ships of War, but are Imployed rather as
Merchant-men, so that they not only bear
their own Expence, but bring in an Over∣plus
to the 
State.




Finale,
 which is the only Seaport that belongs
to the State of 
Millan,
 is a poor abandoned 
Vil∣lage

without either Fortification or Garrison,
nor do the 
Spanish Galleys
 come there any
more; but make 
Genoa
 it self their Step, and
Passage between 
Spain
 and 
Millan:
 so that an
attempt upon 
Genoa
 was indeed the taking
of all the 
Milanese,
 since the communication
between 
Spain
 and it, being now thro 
Genoa,

whensoever this Republick falls into the
hands of the 
French,
 all the 
Millanese
 must
fall of it self, or rather indeed all 
Italy,
 must
needs fall with it.


This is as far as I could understand it the
outward force of 
Genoa:
 for it can expect
little from its 
Allies,
 it having none at all be∣side

Spain:
 and the Slowness and Feebleness
of that 
Court,
 are too visible to give any 
State

great Courage that has no other support be∣sides
this to depend on: As for their Neigh∣bours
in 
Italy,
 they have no sort of Com∣merce
with them; for they pretend to a de∣gree
of Precedence, equal to the 
Venetians:

and to have the respect of a 
Crowned Head

pay'd to them, and this cuts off all Commu∣nication
with the other 
Courts
 of 
Italy,
 who
consider 
Venice
 in another manner than they
do 
Genoa.
 As for 
Spain,
 they have all possible
Engagements with it: many of the richest Fa∣milies
of 
Genoa
 have great 
Estates
 in the 
Mila∣nese,

and the other Dominions of the 
King
 of



Spain;
 so that they must upon their own ac∣count
be true to the Interests of that Crown,
and 
Spain
 is as much concerned in their pre∣servation
as in any of its own Provinces,
since it defends their Empire in 
Italy;
 so
that 
Genoa
 and 
Spain
 are now inseparably
united to one another, by their mutual In∣terests.


But I come next to give you some account
of the Inward state of 
Genoa.
 It is known,
that the Liberty was restored to them, by the
most earnest Intercession of that great 
Cap∣tain,

and gallant Countrey-man, 
Andreas
Doria,
 whose Statue, in remembrance of this,
is set up in an open place in their 
Town:
 this
was in the year 1528. yet tho from that time
they had their Government in their own
hands, they were still obliged to let a Squa∣dron
of the 
Spanish Gallys,
 stand in their 
Ar∣senal,

who kept then a Fleet of about 80.

Gallys,
 so that till 
Spain
 was so much sunk
from its former Greatness, that it was no
more a Terrour to any of its 
Neighbours, Ge∣noa

was still in great dread of having their
Liberty swallowed up by them, and therefore
they do not reckon their entire Liberty but
from the year 1624. or 1625. that they saw
themselves out of all Danger from any of
their Neighbours: 
France
 was not then be∣gun
to grow strong at Sea, and 
Spain
 was
strong no where; so that since that time, till



France
 began to put out great Fleets, and
that they had such a dreadful Neighbour of

Touloun,
 they were safe and at quiet: but they
fell under the common Disease of all 
Common-wealths,

when they are long in Peace, and
while their Commerce flourishes; a Spirit
of Insolence and of Faction began to spread it
self over the whole 
Town,
 which was grown
to such a height, that in the 
Project
 that was
offered to the 
Court
 of 
France,
 shewing the
easiness of this Conquest (of which I have
seen the Copy) the Divisions and Factions
amongst them are proposed, as the chief
ground upon which they founded the Proba∣bility
of the ruin of that 
Common-wealth.


There are 
three
 sorts of Persons in 
Genoa,

the 
Nobility,
 the 
Citizens,
 and the 
Inferior
People.
 There are two Ranks of 
Nobility,
 the
one is of the more 
Antient Families,
 the o∣ther
is of those who have been chosen and
raised up to that Dignity of late. It is true,
the Aggreement that was made in the year
1576. between them, is exactly observed, by
which the Government and the Publick Im∣ployments
are to be equally divided between
them: but yet there is so great a height of
Pride kept up among the Ancient Families,
that they will not Inter-marry with the other,
and think it a diminution to them, to enter
into any Familiarity with them, and even to
keep them Company: this on the other hand


kindles an Indignation in those latter 
Families,

when they see themselves so much despised
by the other. The Ancient 
Families
 have a
necessary Dependence upon the 
Crown
 of

Spain,
 by the great Estates that they have in
their Dominions; but the others, whole
Estates lie rather in Money, which either is
in the Bank, or that runs out in Exchange
or Trade, they are concerned in nothing but
in the preservation of their 
Bank,
 and by con∣sequence
in their Liberty; for none can
doubt but that if they fell in the power of
another 
Prince,
 the Debts on the 
Bank
 would
be but ill payd. Thus the 
Nobility
 stand di∣vided
into two Factions, which discover
their Animosities to one another upon very
many occasions: for 
Publick Imployments
 are
sought after here, with as much Intrigue as
elsewhere. I will give you only one Instance
of this, because it is both very refined, and
it related to that 
Doge,
 whose Government
was so unhappy both by the 
Bombarding
 of

Genoa,
 and by his own going to 
Versailles

to ask Pardon. He himself was a Man of a quiet
temper, that did not aspire; but his 
Wife
 could
not be satisfied till he was 
Doge,
 and she 
Do∣gesse:

so she set so many Machines at work,
that after the several tours, that the matter
made in the many 
Ballottings,
 it came to the
fixing of the last 
three
 out of whom the

Doge
 was to be chosen: and her Husband


was one of them; but there being one of
the three, of whom she was very apprehen∣sive,
she engaged one of her Friends, to seem
so assured of his 
Election,
 as to lay considera∣ble
wagers with several of the 
Electors,
 who
were likeliest to favour him, that he should be
chosen: now they having a greater mind to
win their Betts, than to promote their Friend,
gave their 
Votes
 in favour of him, that was
upon that made 
Doge.


The 2
d
 body in 
Genoa
 is that of the 
Citizens,

who seem to be extreamly weary of the In∣solence
of the 
Nobility;
 and there are many
among them, that think themselves no way
Inferiour to them, neither in the Antiquity,
nor in the Dignity of their 
Families.
 They
do also complain of a great Injustice done
them by the 
Nobility;
 for in the agreement
made between the 
Nobility
 and the 
Citizens,

in the year 1528. one 
Article
 was, that every
year 
ten Citizens
 should be according to their
merit received into their body. It is certain,
that if this had been observed, the 
Nobility
 of

Genoa
 had become by this time so common,
that this would have sunk its dignity ex∣treamly:
but instead of doing this 
yearly,

it is now done but once in 30 
years:
 so the

Citizens
 complane much, that this Encourag∣ment
and Recompence of 
Merit
 is now with∣drawn.
The 
Nobility
 pretend on the other
hand, that by that Agreement, they are


only enabled to make an 
Annuall
 promotion,
but that they are not obliged to it: and I was
told, that the Originall 
Record
 of that Agree∣ment,
could not be found now; and no doubt
it has been destroyed by the Order of the 
Se∣nate.

In short, the 
Citizens
 have so great an
aversion to the 
Government,
 that it was ge∣nerally
thought that they would easily be
prevailed on to shake it oft, and to throw
themselves rather into the Armes of another

Prince,
 who would certainly have very soon
trampled upon them all equally; for it is too
common a thing, to see in all those Intestine

Factions,
 that angry and ill-natured men,
consider the last Injury, more that all other
things: and are ready to sacrifice all to their
Resentments: and are so intent upon their

Revenges,
 that often they will not look
into the Consequences of what they do,
but go on, which way soever the Anger of
the 
Faction
 drives them: and those who are
wise enough, to make their own Advantage
of those Quarrels, and that are dextrous
enough to manage them artificially, make
commonly those 
parties
 take their turns in
using one another ill, in which they know
how to find their account: and as this ob∣servation
holds often in 
Colder Climates,
 so
in a 
Countrey
 where revenges are very much
studied and gratified, no wonder if this was
much relied on. The third rank is of the

Trades men
 and Rabble, who have their chief,


dependance upon the great 
Nobility:
 but they
are a Vicious and dissolute sort of 
People,
 as
any are in the world. And indeed all 
Genoa
 is
so extreamly corrupt, so Ignorant, and so
brutal, and so little acquainted with the true
Notions of 
Government,
 that here is a 
Com∣mon-wealth

degenerated to such a degree, that
it cannot resist a considerable shock. The 
Sub∣jects

are excessively Rich, tho the 
State
 is
Poor: and this appears both in the Magnifi∣cence
of their 
Buildings,
 which is beyond
Imagination, and in the great 
Wealth
 that is
in their 
Churches
 and 
Convents,
 which see∣med
to me to be beyond what is in 
Venice
 it
self.


A sensible man that I knew there told me,
that as there was among them a sort of Impu∣nity
to all Kind of Vice, so their gross Igno∣rance
made them Incapable to conduct their

State;
 for while their 
Wealth
 blew them up,
with that Pride that it commonly produces
in mean Souls, and when their Intrigues
brought them into a considerable share of
the 
Government,
 they satisfied themselves
with carrying on the Interests of their own

Cabal,
 and depressing those that opposed
them, without opening their minds to so
great a thought, as that of correcting or se∣curing
their 
Common wealth.
 They neither
had Heads nor Hearts capable of a vigorous
Defence: and they knew nothing of what
was doing abroad; but contented themselves


with minding the Interest of their 
City Fa∣ctions.

He added, that when a 
Common-wealth

fell once into this Disease, it was in
a much worse state, than any to which
the Rigour even of an unhappy War, could
reduce it: as a man whose Vitals are In∣wardly
corrupted, is in a much worse condi∣tion,
than he that has received many Wounds;
Nature may bring him thro the one, tho
he had lost ever so much blood; whereas it
must sink under the other: so all the mischief
that could befall a 
Common-wealth
 could
hardly destroy it, if it retain'd the Inward
vigour of its first 
Maximes
 and 
Constitution:

and he did not stick to say, that as high as
the 
States of Holland
 were now in holding
the 
ballance of Europe,
 if their 
Towns
 fell once
into established 
factions,
 if 
Learning
 sunk
among them, so that their 
Magistrates
 grew
Ignorant, chiefly of the 
Affairs
 of 
Europe,

if they came to have a 
Magistracy,
 that had
not the right understanding of 
War,
 and the
Courage with which some practice in 
Mili∣tary

matters Inspire men, and if their 
Wealth

swelled them up to an Unreasonable Pride,
and that men rise more upon the little In∣trigues
of 
City Factions,
 than upon true merit;
whensoever, he said, the 
States
 fell into this
disease, then the strength of that 
Republick

was gone; and tho they might subsist after
that longer or shorter, according to the Con∣juncture
of Affairs, yet one might reckon


them to be in their decline, which must end
in a most certain Ruin to them, either within
doors, or from abroad.


I have now told you enough to let you
see how reasonable a Project it was to send a

fleet
 against so feeble a 
body;
 which without
most prodigious Errors in the management,
could not have miscarried: and this is so clear,
and so confessed by every man in 
Genoa,
 that
one rather Wonders how they found a way to
conduct it so ill. The 
man
 that formed the
whole project was 
Stiven Valdyron
 of 
Nismes,

and a 
Protestant,
 who is a person of a very good
Understanding, and having lived above 12
years in 
Genoa,
 had time enough not only to
raise a very good Estate out of his Trade,
but to see into the whole Feebleness of that

Government.
 I conversed long and much with
him: and having since that time been in 
Ge∣noa

it self, I have seen so clearly the truth of
all that he told me, that I may now assure
you of all that I learnt from him. He had
a strange affection to his 
Great Monarch,

and fancied that the obligations of raising

his Glory,
 was superiour to all other: and no
doubt he reckoned to find his own account
in it, if he could have been the occasion of
making the 
King of France
 Master of 
Genoa:

therefore he drew up the whole 
Project,
 and
shewed both of what Importance the thing
was; and how easily it might be executed:
for I have a 
Copy
 of the whole 
Scheme,
 which


Mr. 
St. Olon
 sent to the 
Court of France,
 of
which Mr. 
Valdyron
 was indeed the 
Author;

the design being entertained, 
St. Olon
 had
an Intimation given him, to withdraw some
day's before the 
French fleet
 came before
the 
Town.
 But 
Valdyron
 was left to try his
hard fate; for as soon as the 
Fleet
 began to do
Acts of Hostility, 
Valdyron,
 who had been
known to be much with 
St. Olon,
 was clapt
in 
Prison,
 and while he was in it, a 
Bomb

broke thro his Prison, but did him to hurt,
only the violent noise it made weakned the
Tympan of his 
Ear
 so much, that he lost
his hearing of one side.


But he, as well as all 
Genoa,
 fancied they
were lost, and that the 
French
 must be cer∣tainly
Masters of the 
Place
 in a few hours.
The Consternation and Confusion was so
great, that if at first a great shower of 
Bombs

had been thrown into the 
Town,
 and a de∣scent
had been made, they had certainly suc∣ceeded;
for the 
people
 were in such a disorder,
that the 
Magistrates
 were not regarded; and
indeed many of them shewed as much fear
as the rabble did. But the 
French,
 instead
of beginning vigorously at first, threw in

one
 Bomb, and after some hours 
another;

and so went on slowly for a day or two; in
which time, the 
People
 began to get into or∣der,
and to take heart: and now their first
fear, turned to a Rage against the 
French;

so that when they made a descent, they found


such a Resistance, that they were forced to
go back to their 
Ships,
 having left behind
them 500 of their best 
Men:
 and the 
Fleet

continued 
Bombarding
 the 
Town,
 till they
had shot all their 
Bombs;
 and when their
store was spent, they sail'd away, having laid a
great many noble 
buildings
 in ruines.


The 
morality
 of this way of proceeding,
was somewhat hard to be found out: the

Italians
 do not stick to say, it was an 
As∣sassinat,

when without Warning or procee∣ding
in the way of a fair 
War,
 a 
fleet
 came
and surprised and burnt a 
Town:
 but the
Conduct was as extraordinary, as the Action
it self was honorable and worthy of a MOST
CHRISTIAN KING.


It was pleasant to hear a 
Spaniard,
 that
belonged to the Count of 
Melgar
 talk of this
matter: he said, that in this, 
France
 had acted
as it had done on many other occasions, in
which tho it had the favourablest conjuncture
possible, it had done nothing suteable to what
might have been expected; for tho they had
here a calm 
Sea,
 for four dayes, which is a
very Extraordinary thing in the 
Bay
 of 
Genoa,

that is almost alwayes in a 
Storm,
 and tho they
had surprised the 
Town,
 that had not the
least apprehension of such a Design, and found
them in a condition not likely to have resisted
a much smaller Force; yet he said, that Feeble∣ness
which had appeared upon many other
occasions, shewed it self likewise here, since


this great Expedition failed, and the Re∣proach
of first attempting it, and then
Miscarrying in it, was studied to be carried
off by this, that the design was only to

Chastise Genoa,
 at which there is not a 
man

in the 
Town
 that does not laugh. He upon
this took a great compass for these last twenty

years
 backwards, to shew that there was no∣thing
extraordinary in all this 
Reign,
 that had
been the Subject of so many 
Panegyricks,
 un∣less
this may be reckoned extraordinary, that
there has been so little progress made, when
they had the fairest opportunities possible: an
Infant 
King
 of 
Spain,
 and a feeble 
Council,

and a Distraction in the 
States
 of 
Holland;
 so
that the first Successes that were the Effects
of the weakness and surprise of those that
were attackt, are rather a Reproach than a
Glory to a 
Reign,
 that has understood so
ill how to serve it self of those advantages,
that had nothing of the Greatness of a 
Con∣quering

Genius in it; and where the 
Ministry

shewed rather an exactness in executing little
Projects, than a largeness of Soul in laying
vast ones. I could not but be pleased to see a

Spaniard,
 find somewhat that entertained his
Pride in the Contempt of the 
French,
 at the
same time that the low estate of their Af∣fairs,
made him feel the depression of their
own 
Empire
 as much as the progress of the
Great Monarch of 
France.


But now I cannot but tell you the rest of



Valdyron's
 Story: as soon as the 
French
 were
gone, the Government of 
Genoa
 began to
examin him, but he stood to his denial, and
said, he knew nothing: all his 
Effects
 were
seised on and dissipated, and he himself was
four or five times put to the strapado, which
was done by tying his hands behind his back,
and fetching them over his Head, which dis∣joynted
his Armes and Shoulder-blades, in a
most terrible manner, yet he had the firm∣ness
to stand it out: and so they could draw
nothing from him: but as soon as the 
Court

of 
France
 understood, that both he, and seve∣ral
other 
Frenchmen,
 that lived in 
Genoa,

were put in Prison, the 
Resident
 of 
Genoa

was clapt up at 
Paris:
 and when the Over∣tures
were made to accommodate this matter,

Valdyron
 was no more ill used, and after
some Months he was set at Liberty: but
his 
Estate
 was quite lost: yet he came to

France,
 not doubting but that so great a Ser∣vice,
and such severe Suffering, would have
procured him some considerable Reward:
but after he had languished there above a
year, he got a 
Pension,
 that was just enough
to keep him alive, of two hundred 
Crowns:

and even that was stopt, as soon it was known
that he was of the 
Religion,
 till he changed.
This piece of Gratitude for such a Service,
that had cost him so dear, was no extraordi∣nary
Encouragement for others to venture as
he had done. Yet I who knew him well, for


almost two years, could not but admire the
wonderful Zeal he had for the Glory of his

King;
 for in the midst of all his Misery, and
of all the Neglect he met with, having fallen
from so flourishing a condition, he could ne∣ver
be brought to think that he had done foo∣lishly:
but was rather proud of it, that he
had formed so sure a Scheme, for putting 
Ge∣noa

into his 
Masters
 hands: & this he said often
to me, when he was so poor, that he did not
know where to dine. The affinity of the
matter, makes me call to mind a conversation
that I had at 
Rome,
 with two of the Old 
Ma∣gistrates

of 
Messina;
 who had been men that
bore a great stroak in that 
Town,
 during the

Revolt:
 and were then reduced to the misery
of accepting a Charity. They told us, that
all the 
Oaths,
 that Mr. 
de Vivonne,
 and Mr.

la Fueillade,
 swore to them in the 
Kings
 name,
as well as in their own, never to abandon
them, which were made upon the 
Sacrament,

besides whole Valleys of 
Oaths,
 that Mr. 
la
Fueillade
 made them from morning to night,
while he was among them, it seems went for
nothing, but matters of form: yet they said,
they thought the 
French Ministry
 would have
considered the 
Kings Interests,
 if they had no
regard to his 
Honour.
 They added, that if the

King
 of 
France,
 when he found the War of

Messina
 lay heavy upon him, had sent to 
Spain,

and offered to that 
Court,
 as a pledge of the
Peace that he was offering them at 
Nimmegen,



to put 
Messina
 again in to their hands, provided
they would grant an 
Indemnity
 for what was
past, and a Confirmation of their Antient

Priviledges,
 of which he himself would be
the 
Garand,
 this they said the 
Spaniards
 would
have without doubt, accepted as something
come to them from Heaven: and if the mat∣ter
had ended thus, as it would have been
highly honourable for the 
King,
 so it would
have given him the dependance both of 
Sicily

and 
Naples,
 and have kept them still in a
disposition to throw themselves into his
hands: whereas in the way that their business
ended, if there should be in any time hereafter,
a provocation given in those parts to 
revolt,

they would sooner throw themselves into the
Armes of the 
Turk,
 if he should be again
in a condition to protect them, than of those
who had abandoned them in so strange a man∣ner,
taking no care neither of the 
Priviledges

of the 
Town
 in general, nor of those particu∣lar

Persons,
 who had rendred themselves un∣pardonable
to the 
Spaniards.
 It is true, some
were brought away to 
France,
 the 
two
 that
I have mentioned were of that number, and
had small 
Pensions
 assigned them, which were
but ill payed: and because some of them had
not patience enough to bear such an unlooked
for Usage, but complained freely of it, a pre∣tence
was taken from thence, to 
banish
 them
all out of 
France;
 so that ever since they have
suffered a great deal of Misery. I will not


digress so far as to give you an account of
that whole 
Revolt,
 which they justified to us,
from the great 
Priviledges
 of their 
Town,

which were indeed such as made it a sort of
a 
Common-wealth:
 that had a right to defend
it self against those manifest Infractions with
which they charged the 
Spaniards.
 They
told us, that the Confiscations of 
Messina
 had
amounted to twenty 
Millions:
 and yet for all
that the 
King of Spain
 was not much the ri∣cher
by their Ruin; for the 
Vice-Roy
 and

Government
 of 
Sicily,
 pretended to exhaust all
by a 
Citadel
 that they are building: and by
some other publick Works. In Conclusion,
the two poor 
Messinesses,
 seeing a 
Dutchman

in our Company, turned the Discourse to
him, and wished him to warn his 
Countrey∣men,

by their Fate, how much some 
Courts

ought to be relied on.


And now I have done with all the 
Political
Observations,
 that I could make in 
Italy.
 But
as I begun this 
Letter
 with one piece of 
Na∣tural
History,
 I will end it with another. The

first
 was a way of preparing of 
Salt,
 and the

second
 is a new way of preparing of 
Vitriol,

which was lately set up in the 
Sulfatara,

near 
Puzzolo.
 It has not been long enough
a going, to enable one to judge how it will
succeed; but yet all things are very promi∣sing;
and that which gives a good Prospect
of it, is, that all is done without the expence
of any 
fire.
 The Method of it is this. There


are several 
Cistorns
 made in that great Bot∣tom
of the 
Sulfatara,
 of great 
stones
 Cemented
very close: into these all the 
Rain
 both of
that Bottom, and of the little Hills that are
round it does fall, which is impregnated
with 
Vitriol:
 they do also lay a great many
Tiles and Bricks before all those Vents, that
the Fire which is in this Soil makes: and where
the Smoke comes out, with so rapid a vio∣lence;
so that this Smoke passing thro these
Bricks, leaves a great deal of 
Sulphur
 and 
Vi∣triol

upon them: and these Bricks are washed
in those 
Cisterns,
 and by this means the 
Wa∣ter

becomes impregnated with 
Vitriol:
 then
they put the Water into 
Coppers,
 which they
set over those violent hot Eruptions; so that
this serves as a Fire, to evaporate the Phlegm,
and so they find quantities of 
Vitriol.
 The
revenue of this goes to the 
Annunciata
 of 
Na∣ples:

and they begin to promise themselves
great advantages from it: but a little time
will shew this, as well as greater matters. I
will add no new trouble, to that which the
length of this 
Letter
 must needs have given
you: so I will conclude, without any other
Formality, but that of assuring you that I
am,


SIR,


Your most humble Servant.






POSTSCRIPT.


SInce I added a 
Postscript
 to my 
two
 former

Letters,
 I intend to make this so far of a
piece with them, as to conclude this likewise
with one; for I find, looking over the little
Notes that I took, a Particular that had esca∣ped
me, and yet it seems to deserve to be men∣tioned:
and since I have not brought it into my

Letters,
 I have resolved to make a 
Postscript

express for it.


There is a little 
Town
 in the 
Appennins,

about 25 miles from 
Rome,
 called 
Norcia,

near which there is a considerable 
Abbey,

which belongs now to a 
Cardinal.
 This

Town,
 tho it lies within the 
Popes
 Territory,
yet has such great Priviledges still reserved
to it, that it my pass in some sort for a free

Common-wealth.
 They make their 
Lawes,

and choose their own 
Magistrates;
 but that
which is the most extraordinary part of their
Constitution, and that is the most exactly
observed, is, that they are so jealous of all

Priests,
 and of their having any share in their

Government,
 that no man that can either
read or write is capable of bearing a share in
their Government: so that their 
Magistracy,

which consists of 4 
Persons,
 is alway's in the
hands of 
Vnlettered
 Men, who are called there

Li quatri Illiterati:
 for they think the least


tendency to Letters, would bring them under
the ordinary Miseries that they see all their
Neighbours are brought under by the cre∣dit
in which both the 
Robes
 are among
them. And they are so shy of all 
Churchmen,

and so jealous of their 
Liberty,
 that when
the 
Cardinal
 comes during the Heats of the
Summer sometimes, to his 
Abbey,
 they take
no notice of him, nor do they make any sort
of Court to him. One that has been oft
there, told me, that by divers of their Cu∣stomes
they seem to be of the race of the old

Latines;
 and that their Situation and their
Poverty had at all times preserved them: yet
they are not such Strangers to the manners
of the rest of the 
Italians
 as not to take plea∣sure
in severe revenges, of which this Instance
was given me. The 
Abbot
 that was the 
Car∣dinals

Predecessor, had an 
Auditor
 who was
much in his favour, that made love to the

Wife
 of one of the 
Magistrates
 of 
Norcia,
 which
she discovered to her 
Husband;
 he ordered her
to give the 
Auditor
 an Appointment; but
provided a good 
Surgeon
 and all other things
that were necessary to put the 
Auditor
 out of
all danger of breaking his Vow of Chastity:
for he was a 
Churchman;
 and the 
Auditor
 not
failing to observe his rendezvous, was caught,
and the operation was performed with all pos∣sible
care: and he was treated very well till he
was quite cured, and then he was sent back to
his 
Patron.
 The 
Abbot
 was highly offended


with this affront that was done him: and it
may be easily believed that the 
Auditor
 was not
well pleased with this forced Chastity that was
now Imposed on him: so they sent an Informa∣tion
of the matter to the 
Rota;
 and asked their
opinion: but the 
Court
 of the 
Rota
 was wiser
than to suffer a matter of this nature to become
publick. To this I shall add a pleasant thing
that was told me concerning 
Priests
 that fell
under the misfortune of this 
Auditor.
 It is
known, that according to the 
Canon Law,

the one Indelible Character defaces the other:
and that a 
Priest
 so treated can no more say

Mass:
 yet I was told that this distinction was
used, that if the 
Priest
 had 
all
 that was taken
from him restored to him, so that he could car∣ry
it in his 
Pocket,
 he was still esteemed 
entire,

and might say 
Mass;
 but unless he could have
the consolation of carrying those things 
dead

about him, that had been perhaps too 
quick

before, the Character was lost, or was at least
under a totall suspension: If all this is a little too
pleasant and too natural, a little good humour
must be forgiven to a 
Traveller,
 whose Spirits
are too much in motion, to be so setled and so
grave as they ought to be.
