Paget

Right Worthy and much honoured,


IF the Dedication of this poor Work unto you, may carry with it any intimation of the great Respect and Honour I have for you, I desire the world should understand the ground of it; which is not so much the emi∣nency of your Quality and outward Condi∣tion (though that also deserves its due value and regard) as your eminent Piety and Vertue, which renders you truly honourable, and at∣tracts the esteem of all good men. And truly I cannot but look upon it as a great testimony of the Divine favour to that 
Noble Family
 to which you are all so nearly related, and a great honour to it, That in an Age so corrupt and depraved as this is, there should be found in it

 so many Persons more 
ennobled
 by their 
Virtue
 than their 
High Birth;
 and more 
great
 in 
Good∣ness
 and 
real Worth,
 than in 
Estate.
 May the Blessing of God Almighty ever rest on You and your Families, and make you still great Examples of all that is good and praise-worthy, in the places where you live; that when you shall have finished your course, and served your Ge∣neration here according to the will of God, and are entred into your everlasting Rest, your Names may be to the succeeding Age as a 
Per∣fume
 poured forth.


As for what concerns this Work, you may please to understand, That it is the fruit of some of my hours of leisure and retirement, of which I have had more of late years than ever I desired or expected. And surely 
tam otii quam negotii reddenda est ratio,
 as he said: We must give account to God of our times of leisure, as well as of those of publick and visible em∣ployment. For those several years last past, wherein I have been confined to privacy, I have addicted my self to the serious study of the Holy Scriptures, not finding any way wherein I could better employ my time. For where can we find that profit, that delight, that comfort in afflictions, which may be reaped from a diligent perusal and serious meditation on those Sacred and Divinely-inspir'd Writings? I have often thought with my self, that a short and plain Analytical Paraphrase and Exposi∣tion of them, might be of great use to those

 who have not leisure to read larger Comments. And accordingly I have bent my pains to serve them therein, as I was able. If my poor endea∣vours may be any ways serviceable to the Church of God, I shall rejoyce. However, as our blessed Saviour said in excuse of 
Mary
 when she was blamed for pouring her Box of precious Ointment on his Head (
Mar.
 14.4, &c.), 
Let her alone, she hath done what she could;
 intimating, that if she had known how to ex∣press her high veneration and affection to Him in a better manner, she would have willingly done it: So I hope I may in some measure of sincerity and uprightness say, that 
I have done what I could.
 If I had known how to do any thing better for the service of God and His Church, in the Circumstances wherein I have of late years been cast, I hope I should have readily done it. But seeing I did not, I have (humbly imploring the Divine Assistance) ad∣ventured on this.


'Tis well known, that there is nothing in this world more pleasing and cheering to the eyes, than 
Light;
 insomuch that one elegantly calls it 
The smile of Nature.
 And in like manner, to the Mind and Understanding of man, there is nothing more pleasing and delightful than a clear discovery of 
Truth.
 But of all Truths, there are none can be so acceptable, so delight∣ful and ravishing, as 
those glorious Truths
 revealed by God in his holy Word, which tend so much to the bettering of 
man
 here, and to the bring∣ing

 of him to eternal happiness hereafter. And truly I am very confident, would Persons of Quality and Education more diligently read and study the Holy Scriptures, they would find such incomparable delight, sweetness, and comfort in them, that 
Play-books
 and 
Romances,
 and such corrupting and effeminating Trash (which consume the precious hours of too many of our Gentry) would seem vile and contemptible in their eyes. But I need not say these things to you, who know how better to employ your time, and have learned to prefer 
Manna
 before Onions and Garlick.


All that I shall further trouble you with, is only to acquaint you, That se
 
 ventu∣ring this poor thing of mine into a World so full of Censure and Prejudice, I find my self inclin'd to put up some such Petition unto God for it, as that excellent person, Mr. 
Herbert
 put up for his Divine Poems:


Turn their eyes hither who will make again:


Theirs, who will hurt themselves or me, refrain.


And thus (honoured Friends) wishing very heartily unto You, and all yours, all manner of prosperity, I remain,


Your very humble and affectionate Servant, 
SA. CRADOCK.

THE PREFACE TO THE READER.


Courteous Reader,


HAving lately published the intire History of our 
Bles∣sed Lord and Saviour,
 from his Birth to his glorious 
Ascension
 to Heaven; it will not be, I hope, unaccep∣table to thee, if I here present thee with the History of the 
Church
 immediately succeeding; and give thee a Narrative of the 
Acts, Labours, Travels, Sermons, Discourses, Miracles, Suc∣cesses,
 and 
Sufferings
 of the Holy Apostles, as they are record∣ed by the Evangelist 
Luke
 in that Divine Book of his, call'd the 
Acts of the Apostles.


And that my Design in this undertaking may the more clearly be discerned, be pleased to understand, that I have digested the whole Work into 
Seven Chapters.


The FIRST CHAPTER contains the Acts of all the Apo∣stles 
joyntly,
 from our Saviour's Ascension to 
Saul
's 
Conversion;
 and shews what was done by them 
before
 the Feast of Pente∣cost, 
at
 the Feast, and 
after
 it. (1.) 
Before the Feast;
 it shews how they continued in joynt-devotion for ten days together at 
Jerusalem,
 in expectation of the great 
promised effusion
 of the Spirit; and during that time, called 
Matthias
 by lot to the Apostleship in the room of 
Judas [Acts
 chap. I.] 2. 
At the Feast;
 it shews how they received a 
plentiful effusion
 of the Spirit, and spake 
divers Tongues;
 at which some of the 
Jews
 mocking, 
Peter
 preached an excellent Sermon to them, which had such wonderful success, that by his own and the other A∣postles endeavours, about Three thousand were that day con∣verted to Christ [
Acts
 Chap. II.]. (3.) 
After the Feast;
 it relates how 
PETER
 going up to the Temple with 
John,
 he there

 miraculously cured a 
Cripple.
 The people being filled with amazement and astonishment at this 
miracle, Peter
 informs them, That it was not wrought by any power of his own, but by the power of Jesus Christ. And from hence he takes occasion to preach Christ to them (Chap. III.). The 
Rulers
 of the Jews being offended at his Sermon (though a great number of the people were converted thereby), apprehend 
him
 and 
John,
 and bring them before the 
Council,
 who after examination dis∣miss them, yet with a charge not to preach any more in the Name of Jesus. The Church hereupon betake themselves to prayer, and receive a present and gracious answer from the Lord. Next it shews, how holy and gracious the conversation of this Infant Church was, who convers'd together with great concord and charity, the rich selling their goods for the su∣stentation of the poorer so
 [
Acts
 Chap. IV.] 
 
es the fraud and hypocrisie of 
Ananias
 and 
Sapph
 
 dreadful punishment; as also the many wond
s 
 wrought by the Apostles, to the terror of some, and 
e con∣version of others; and their couragious persisting to preach Christ, notwithstanding they were persecuted, imprisoned, and beaten for it [
Acts
 Chap. V.].


In the next place it sets forth how the Apostles appointed Seven 
Deacons
 to take care of the poor, whereof 
Stephen
 and 
Philip
 were the most eminent, whose particular acts are 
ia∣ted; as namely, 
Stephen
's disputing with some of the S
nagogue of the 
Libertines,
 who (not being able to 
resist the wisdom and spirit by which he spake
) drew him before the 
Council,
 and and there falsly accused him [
Acts
 Chap. VI.]. 
Stephen
 in a long and grave Oration defends himself, and pleads his Cause; but they interrupt him, and fall upon him, and stone him [
Acts
 Chap. VII.].


Immediately after 
Stephen
's Martyrdom, a violent Persecution arose, which scattered the Disciples at 
Jerusalem. Philip
 here∣upon went and preached Christ at 
Samaria,
 and did many Miracles there, and baptized many; and among the rest, 
Simon Magus.
 The Apostles that were left at 
Jerusalem,
 hearing of 
Philip
's good success at 
Samaria,
 send 
Peter
 and 
John
 thither to confirm those new Disciples, and to enlarge the Church. These two Apostles coming thither, they by 
prayer
 and 
imposition of hands
 conferr the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost on the true believers there; which 
Simon Magus
 seeing he offered the Apostles money to enable him to confer the like gifts on whomsoever he pleased: for which impiety 
Peter
 sharply reproves him. Lastly, It sets forth how 
Philip
 was sent to instruct and baptize the Eunuch [
Acts
 Chap. VIII].


The SECOND CHAPTER contains more particularly the History of those two great Apostles 
Paul
 and 
Peter,
 though there is inserted also something concerning 
Barnabas
's journey to 
An∣tioch,
 and the Martyrdom of 
James.


Now concerning 
PAƲL,
 these things are here related: (1.) His

 miraculous Conversion. (2.) His Vocation to the Apostleship. (3.) His Preaching Christ first in the Synagogues of 
Damascus,
 and then in 
Arabia
 for the space of three years. (4.) His re∣turn to 
Damascus
 and escaping the hands of the Jews that there conspired to kill him.


Concerning 
Peter,
 these things are recorded: (1.) The 
Mira∣cles
 he wrought, namely, his healing 
Aeneas
 of the Palsie at 
Lydda,
 and raising 
Tabitha
 from the dead at 
Joppa [Acts
 Chap. IX.] (2.) The 
Doctrine
 he preached to 
Cornelius
 (a 
Gentile
) and his company, upon a particular vision and command from God; whereupon the Holy Ghost falleth on them, and they are baptized [
Acts
 Chap. X.]. This converse and communi∣on of his with the 
Gentiles,
 he vindicates to the 
Jews,
 who were scandaliz'd at it, by a narrative of the whole matter. Here also is inserted a narration, how the Gospel being spread into 
Phoenice, Cyprus,
 and 
Antioch,
 by those Disciples who were dispersed upon the fore-mentioned persecution, 
Barnabas
 was sent from 
Jerusalem
 to confirm them. 
Barnabas
 being at 
Antioch,
 s
ds for 
Paul
 to come to him thither; where they both stre∣nuo
sly preach Christ, and there the 
Disciples
 were first called 
Ch
 stians [Acts
 Chap. XI.]. About this time 
Herod
 persecu∣ted the Ch
tians at 
Jerusalem,
 and killed 
James
 the brother of 
John.
 (3.) Here are related the 
sufferings
 which 
Peter
 un∣der-went under 
Herod,
 who imprisoned him with an intent to put him to death; but he was delivered by an Angel upon the prayers of the Church. Whereupon the anger of the King falls heavy upon his Keepers. 
Herod
 shortly after goes down to 
C
sarea;
 and in his pride taking to himself the Ho∣nour due to God, he is stri
ken by an Angel, and dyeth mise∣rably. After which, the Gospel prospereth [
Acts
 Chap. XII.]. This is the last we hear of this 
great Apostle
 (excepting his be∣ing present at the Council at 
Jerusalem,
 Act. 15.) till we come to his Epistles. As for 
Paul,
 the remainder of his story falls within the time and compass of his travels, and those Five re∣markable Journeys of his which are described in the Five en∣suing Chapters.


The THIRD CHAPTER contains a Narration of 
Paul
's 
First Journey
 from 
Antioch
 with 
Barnabas,
 to preach the Gospel to the 
Gentiles, John-Mark
 being their Minister: At which time they travelled to 
Cyprus, Pamphylia, Lycaonia, Pisidia,
 and other Provinces of 
Asia
 the Less. And therefore this Journey we may call for distinction-sake, 
Iter Asiaticum;
 It is described 
Acts
 Chap. XIII, XIV.


The FOURTH CHAPTER contains 
Paul
's 
Second Journey
 with 
Barnabas,
 and 
Titus,
 and others, from 
Antioch
 to that fa∣mous 
Council
 at 
Jerusalem,
 which we may therefore call 
Iter Hierosolomitanum.
 It is described 
Acts
 Chap. XV. from ver. 1. to 36.


The FIFTH CHAPTER contains 
Paul
's 
Third Journey,
 be∣ing accompanied with 
Silas
 and 
Titus,
 to visit and confirm the

 Disciples in those Cities where 
He
 and 
Barnabas
 had before preached the Gospel; which done, they were called by a Vi∣sion over into 
Macedonia,
 and so passed into 
Europe,
 and travel∣led to 
Philippi, Beroea, Thessalonica, Athens, Corinth,
 and so by 
Ephesus
 returned into 
Syria
 and 
Judea,
 and then came back a∣gain to 
Antioch.
 This Journey we may call 
Iter Graecum
 sive 
Macedonicum.
 It is described from 
ver.
 36 of Chap. XV, to 
ver.
 23 of Chap. XVIII.


The SIXTH CHAPTER contains 
Paul
's 
Fourth Journey,
 which he began from 
Antioch
 in 
Syria,
 from whence he went to 
Ephesus,
 according to his promise, and staying the 
greatest part
 o
 his time in that City, we may from thence call it 
Iter Ephesinum.
 From thence he went to visit the 
Europaean Chur∣ches;
 and at last from 
Macedonia,
 through 
Asia the Less,
 and 
Syria,
 he returned into 
Judea,
 where by the 
Jews
 he was ac∣cused, and by the Roman 
Officers
 taken into custody. Which Journey is described from 
ver.
 23 of Chap. XVIII, to Chap. XXVII


The SEVENTH CHAPTER contains 
Paul
's 
Fifth
 and 
Last Journey
 from 
C
sarea
 to 
Rome,
 which we may therefore call 
Iter Romanum,
 It is described 
Acts
 Chap. XXVII, and XXVIII.


In 
these Seven Chapters
 I have comprised the Divine History of the 
Acts of the Apostles.
 Possibly some may now ask How it can be properly so called, seeing it chiefly relates the story of 
Peter
 and 
Paul;
 and of the 
former
 but sparingly, and insists principally upon the Acts of the 
later,
 mentioning but little what the other Apostles 
did,
 or what Churches they 
planted,
 or what 
death
 they died. For answer to which, this is all that can be said, That it seemed good to the Spirit of God to have only 
so much
 written as he saw conducing to our edification; and in that we are to acquiesce. Besides, 
Luke
 who wrote the 
Acts of the Apostles,
 was a disciple and follower of 
Paul,
 and his Companion in most of his Travels; and therefore no won∣der if he designed principally to write 
his Story.
 To all which we may add, That as 
Paul
's 
Conversion
 was more miraculous than the conversion of any other of the Apostles, so the course of his Ministry was more illustrious. 
He laboured more abun∣dantly than they all,
 1 Cor. 15.10. 
Hierom
 thinks, 
Luke
 wrote this History at 
Rome
 in the 
second
 year of 
Paul
's imprisonment there, and at the request of the Brethren in that City, and by the direction of 
Paul
 himself; but principally, by the peculiar guidance of the Holy Ghost. He is thought to have written it in the 62 year of Christ, and the 6th of 
Nero.
 We have there∣fore in this Divine Book set before us, an History of the 
rise, growth, state, and practice of the primitive Church, in the purest Apostolical times;
 and a declaration of the 
pure doctrine then de∣livered, and of the pure Worship and Church-Government and Dis∣cipline then practised.
 All which may be a pattern to succeeding Churches in all ages. And agreeably hereunto I find a learned

 man expressing himself; 
I have often thought with my self
 (says he) 
that the Divine Scheme given to
 Moses 
in
 Mount Sinai, 
was not more a pattern to erect the ancient Tabernacle by, than the History of the
 Acts of the Apostles 
is a form and type according to which all that are thereunto called, must build and govern the Church under the New Testament, in which certainly there is not the least appearance of that Hierarchical Tyranny which the Court of
 Rome 
endeavours to force upon us by fire and sword, nor any men∣tion of
 Peter
's being Bishop of
 Rome, 
which is the only Foundation the Popish-Creed is built upon.


In this Divine Book also we may see how Christ subdued the World to the obedience of the Gospel, by a 
few illiterate
 men again
 all the malice of Satan labouring to suppress it, 
 raising slanders and persecutions against it; and when 
 
d not prevail with violence, raising 
Hereticks
 to corrupt 
 
ere we have examples of the 
prudence, faithfulness,
 and 
di∣l
nce
 of the Holy Apostles: Here we may see 
how they lived, w
at they taught, how they dealt with the obstinate, how with the 
irm, and how they acted in the doubtful and controversal Cases of the Church.


A
 we go 
long in this History, we come to the 
particular times
 wherein the 
Apostolical Epistles
 were written; and then we shew 
e 
particular occasions
 of writing of them, and 
by whom,
 and from 
what places
 they were sent; giving a short Analysis and Pa
aphrase of them, which I hope will give much light to them, and serve also to illustrate many passages in this 
Aposto∣lical History.


For the 
Chronotaxis,
 or disposition of the things contained in this History, into the proper times wherein they were acted, there being so great diversity of opinions among 
Chronologers
 and Learned men, I have followed what I thought best, leaving others the liberty of their own judgments.


As for the Apostolical Epistles (which are in number 21), ac∣cording to the best conjectures we are able to make, they were written in this order of Time, according to this ensuing Table.

Thus 
(Courteous Reader)
 I have given thee a brief view or pro∣spect of this whole History; for a better understanding of which, I have added a Map of the Apostle 
Paul
's Trayels. And lastly▪ for a close I have added a short description of the De∣struction of 
Jerusalem,
 which may be as a Comment not only to 
 passages in this History, and in the Apostolical Epistles, but in th Gospels also.


About 23 years after this dismal Destruction, in the 14 year of 
Domi
ian, John the Evangelist
 had the 
Revelation
 in the Isle of 
Patmos.
 And this is all I thought fit to advertise thee of by way of Preface. Only I shall add, If thou desirest to reap any benefit by my Paraphrase on the Epistles, I entreat thee to take thy Bible, and to read the Text along with the Paraphrase. It is not un∣known to any who have ever attentively read over the Apostoli∣cal Epistles, that there are abundance of 
dark and obscure passages in them;
 abundance of 
, 
things hard to be understood,
 as the Apostle speaks, 2 
Pet.
 3.16. I may truly say, I have not wil∣lingly or knowingly passed over any of them untouch'd, but said something (according to my poor Talent) either in the Paraphrase, or in the Notes, tending to the clearing of them. And so heartily praying and desiring that from the whole, God may receive glory, and the ingenuous 
Reader
 benefit, I bid thee farewell.


Thine in Christ Jesus,

 To young Scholars who should be directed in Chronologie, and how to reduce the passages and transactions of the Apostolick Times, to their due and proper places, and should be guided in a right way and method of studying the holy Scriptures.

 'Tis a Book sit for Parents to give to their Children that are grown up, to bring them to a love and delight in the Scriptures, they being made plain, and facile, and intelligible in this Para∣phrase.


6.
 The Notes in the Margin are very useful for Scholars to give them an account of the particular interpretations that the Au∣thor giveth of sundry difficult places; and yet they are so ordered, that they will not disturb the 
unlearned
 in reading either the Apo∣stolical History, or the Paraphrase on the Epistles.


7.
 The Map of 
Paul
's Travels is useful and delightful, not only for the clearer understanding how 
that blessed Apostle
 planted the Gospel up and down in the world; but it may be useful also for the understanding of several passages in the History both of the Old and New Testament.




Lastly,
 The History of the Destruction of 
Jerusalem,
 may give much light to many passages not only in the Apostolical Epistles, but in the Gospels also.


And therefore we commend this Reverend Author's design of helping us to know the Scriptures, to the blessing of Him who inspired those that wrote them. And this we do the more
 hopefully, 
because it hath been the observation of the most
 pi∣ously considerate, 
That God hath in all Ages made those La∣bours of his Servants most eminently acceptable, which have been employed in the profitable explication of any part of the Scripture; as if He, who hath imprinted such a
 Majesty 
upon the Text, delighted also to reflect an honour upon the Inter∣preters thereof; and to make mens Works
 illustrious, 
by their
 illustrating 
the Word of God, and directing others in the paths that lead to blessedness.

THE Apostolical History.




CHAP. I.
 Containing a Narration of the 
Acts
 of the 
Apostles
 (jointly considered) from 
Christ
's Ascension to 
Saul
's Conversion.




SECT. I.


THE Holy Evangelist 
Luke
 having in his former Trea∣tise written the History of 
Our Lord and Saviour,
 (wherein he had spoken 
of all things
, 
that Jesus both did, 
nd taught,
 so far forth as the Holy Ghost hought fit to dictate to him, and to injoyn 
im to publish) he now proceeds to write the History of his 
Apostles
. And in the first place, to connect this History with his former, he shews, That after our 
Saviour
 was 
risen from the dead,
 he continued Forty days on the earth, and in that space of time appeared often to his chosen Apostles
, giving them many sure Evidences, that it was truly He, 
their Lord and Master;
 and by the direction of the Holy Ghost (where∣with his Human Nature was full) he gave them many Precepts and Commandments, touching the discharge of their Function and Office; acquainting them with the things appertaining 
to the Kingdom of God,
 viz 
the Kingdom of his Grace,
 which is erected, and set up in the Hearts of men by the prea∣ching of the Gospel. And having now ga∣thered

 them together
, that they might behold his 
Ascension,
 he commanded them▪ that they should not disperse themselves, not depart from 
Jerusalem,
 but stay the
e, and expect the performance of the 
Promise
 made by the 
Father
 of a 
great
 and 
plentiful Effusion
 of his Spirit upon them [
Joel
 2.28.] of which he had often before told them, as we may see, 
Luk.
 24.29. & 
Joh.
 14. and 
ch.
 15. and 16. And though they had been before baptized by 
John,
 who baptized
 with 
water,
 but could not confer the Spirit
 with the outward Ordinance, yet now they shouldst be baptized with the 
Holy Ghost ten days
 hence; not but that they had received the Spirit before in 
some measure,
 but now this Spirit should be poured forth in a more large, and plentiful manner upon them, to 
confirm
 them more assuredly in the Doctrine of the Gospel, to 
sanctifie
 them more abun∣dantly, to 
seal
 to them, and bear 
witness
 with their Spirits, that they were the adop∣ted children of God, 
Eph.
 1.13. 
Rom.
 8.16. And lastly, to 
confer
 those gifts upon them, which were requisite for the execution of their Office, namely the gifts of 
Tongues, Prophecies,
 and 
Miracles,
 that they might divulge and proclaim his Doctrine and Gos∣pel not only in 
Judea,
 and 
Samaria,
 but e∣ven to the uttermost parts of the earth. The Apostles hearing him discourse of this 
ex∣traordinary effusion of the Spirit,
 and ima∣gining (as it seems) it would be an 
intro∣duction
 to the glorious temporal kingdom of the 
Messiah,
 (which still ran in their minds,) they asked him, 
whether he would at this time restore the Kingdom to
 Israel 
or no?
 having an eye, (as 'tis probable) to that place, 
Dan.
 7 27. 
And the kingdom, and dominion, and the greatness of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, shall be given to the people of the Saints of the most High, whose Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and all Dominions shall serve and obey him.
 To whom he replies. That they ought to be contented with the knowledg of such things as the Father hath thought fit to reveal to them: but for other things which he is pleased to keep secret, they should not pry into them, the knowledg of them being neither necessary, nor profitable for them. And this might abundantly satisfie them, that they should shortly be endued with such power, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, where∣by they should be rendred fit to preach the Gospel, and to testifie
 to the uttermost

 parts of the earth (even both to the 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles
) that 
he was the true Messias,
 and 
Saviour of the world.
 Having thus spoken unto them, he led them forth to that part of Mount 
Oli∣vet
 which is neer 
Bethany
, and there 
lifting up his hands, he blessed them,
 and as he blessed them he was 
parted
 from them, and 
carried
 up into heaven, a 
cloud recei∣ving him out of their sight.
 They standing amazed at this wonderful sight, and earnest∣ly looking after him towards heaven, 
two Angels
 
in white robes
 appeared to them, and assured them, that he would so come to judgment, as they had seen him go to heaven, to wit, 
visibly,
 and in the 
same bo∣dy
 with which he ascended; at which time he would appear in the clouds again with great Majesty and Glory.


Acts
 1. 
v.
 1. The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus,
 of a
l that Jesus began both to do and teach.


v.
 2. Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen.


v.
 3. To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion, by many in∣fallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:


v.
 4. And being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, 
saith he,
 ye have heard of me.


v.
 5. For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the holy Ghost, not many days hence.


v.
 6. When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?


v.
 7. And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the sea∣sons, which the Father hath put in his own power.


v.
 8. But ye shall receive power after that the holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.


v.
 9. And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was ta∣ken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.


v.
 10. And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven, as he went up, be∣hold, two men stood by them in white apparel,


v.
 11. Which also said, Ye men of Gallilee, Why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.








SECT. II.


THe Apostles having seen our Saviour thus gloriously ascend into Heaven (worshipping, and adoring him in Spirit, as their Lord, and Saviour, 
Luk
 24.52.) returned to 
Jerusalem,
 and according to his command
 conti∣tinued there in joint devotion in an 
upper∣room
 for ten days, together with many o∣ther men, (whereof some were of the kin∣red
 of Jesus) and some pious women, who had followed him; among whom was 
Mary
 his mother; their whole number being about 
Sixscore;
 and there they ex∣pected the great, and large effusion of the Spirit, which was promised unto them.


Acts.
 1. 
v.
 12.
 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath days Journey.


v.
 13. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholom
w, and Matthew, James 
the son
 of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas 
the brother
 of James.


v.
 14.
 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.








SECT. III.


DUring this time of their abode together, 
Peter
 rose up, and made a motion to the rest of the disciples there present, that one should be chosen into 
Judas
's place; who having formerly had the honour to be one of Christs Apostles had by his late treachery against his Lord, and Master
 (being guide
 to them that took him, as the Holy Ghost
 had long ago predicted by the mouth of the Prophet 
David, Psal.
 41.9.) fallen from that digni∣ty; He tells them that this 
Judas
 received from the chief Priests and the Rulers of the Jews a reward for his Treason, yet it did not at all profit him, but only gave occasion to them, with that money, to purchase the Porters field
 called from thence 
Aceldama,
 to his everlasting infamy. He farther shews, that this 
wretched man
 having through re∣morse, and anguish of Spirit for that his hainous fact, hanged himself,
 the rope, or that to which it was fastned breaking, he fell down headlong, and burst asunder, and his bowels gushed out
, and so he went to his own place
. These things having thus happened to 
Judas,
 he exhorts them to chuse another into his room, shewing the necessity of such a choice for the fulfilling those Scriptures, 
viz. Psal.
 65.25. and 109.8.
; which foretold he should be spoiled of what he had so wretchedly got, and that his office should be void and conferred on another. And he further declares unto them what manner of Person was to be chosen namely one of those, who had followed Jesus 
from the time that he was baptized by John, and began to gather disciples
 (at which time the Baptist gave such a publick testimo∣ny of him, that some of his own disciples, and several others began to follow him) unto the day of his 
Ascension,
 that so he might be a more competent and authentick witness, not only of his Doctrine and Miracles, and the other actions of his life, but of his Re∣surrection also
.




The Apostles agreeing to this motion, put two men in election viz. 
Barsabas
 and 
Mathias,
 and praying unto God to direct the Lot, and to shew which of them he was pleased to chuse, and appoint to this office, the Lot fell on 
Mathias,
 and he was accor∣dingly numbred among the Apostles
.


Acts
 1. 
v.
 15. And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of th
 Dis
i∣ples, and said, (The number of names together were about an hundred and twenty.)


v.
 16.
 Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.


v.
 17. For he was numbred with us, and had obtained p
rt of this mini∣stery.


v.
 18.
 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity, and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gush∣ed out.


v.
 19. And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem, insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.


v.
 20. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolat
 and let no man dwell therein: And his bishoprick let another take.


v.
 21. Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,


v.
 22. Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.


v.
 23. And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was called Justus, and Matthias.


v.
 24. And they prayed, and said, Thou Lord, which knowest the heart
 of all men, shew wh
ther of these two thou hast chosen.


v.
 25.
 That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression f
ll, that he might go to his own place.


v.
 26. And they gave forth their l
ts, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbred with the eleven ap
stles.








SECT. IV.


THe Apostles, and the forementioned number o
 Disciples having been thus employed for the first 
ten days
 after our Saviours Ascension, and 
Pentecost
 being now come, as they were with one ac∣cord assembled together, suddenly there came a sound from heaven of a 
rushing migh∣ty
 wind (representing the efficacy of the Spirit of God now descending) and an ap∣pearance of 
cloven fiery tongues
 lighted upon each of them, and they were now all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with 
strange tongues,
 such as they ne∣ver had before learnt (see 
Mark
 16.17.) and other miraculous powers were confer∣red upon them.


The fame of this being instantly spread abroad, and there being present at that time great multitudes of Jews, who had come up from all parts of 
Judea
 to the 
feast;
 and also many other Jews
 and Profelytes born in divers o∣ther nations, some whereof probably were Students there, and others had come up at this time to worship the 
true God
 at 
Jerusa∣lem;
 they were all much amazed to hear such unlearned men, as the Apostles were, speak the languages of their several nations. But some among them 
derided
 the miracle, and imputed it to drunkenness. Hereupon Pe∣ter standing up with the rest of the Apostles in a grave Oration confuted this calumny, shewing the unre
sonableness of it, seeing it was now but the third hour of the day, or nine a clock in the morning
; and then declares unto them, that that which was now

 done was the completion of a famous Prophecy uttered by the Prophet, 
Joel cap.
 2. from 28. to the end; the meaning of which was this, that in the 
last days,
 viz. 
the days of the Messias
 there should be a large, and remarkable effusion of the Spirit of God 
upon all flesh;
 (that is, upon 
Gentiles
 as well as 
Jews
) yea, upon all sorts of persons among them, without distinction, namely, upon 
old
 and 
young, sons
 and 
daughters, bond
 and 
free;
 whereby they should be endued with such an excellent measure of knowledg touching the mysteries of salvation, and with such an ability to instruct others, in them, as might well be compared with the 
Prophe∣cies
 *,
 
Dreams and Visions
 imparted by God to some of the ancient Prophets; and after this great effusion of the Spirit there should be many fearful 
stupendous sights
 and 
prodi∣gies
, and many great slaughters in 
Ju∣dea,
 as fore-runners and presignifications of the 
great
 and 
dismal destruction
 that should come upon 
Jerusalem,
 and the people of the Jews for their crucifying the 
Lord of Life;
 and that the only way to escape in the time of those fears, dangers, and destructions was 
to repent,
 and to 
own Christ
 and believe in him, and to call upon the name of the Lord
 in faithful and fervent prayer.


Having thus washed off this 
unjust aspersion
 of drunkenness by interpreting and applying this Prophecy, he proceeds on to shew them, That 
Jesus of Nazareth
 was the 
true Messias
 promised by all the Prophets. And first he speaks of his 
person and life
 shewing that by those many miracles wrought by him in the midst of them, he was plainly demonstrated
 to be a person sent from God and approved of him; Secondly, he speaks 
of his Death,
 how God having determined and decreed he should be put to death for the sins of men; and by his fore-knowledg discerning this the fittest expedient to bring about that great design of saving sinners, he had per∣mitted him to fall into their power: who having maliciously accused, and condemned him
, at last by their vehement importu∣nity prevailed with the 
Romans
 to put him

 to death, and so had by their wicked hands crucified him, 
v.
 22, 23. Thirdly, he speaks 
of his Resurrection
 how God 
raised him again,
 loosing the bands of death, it being impossible as 
David
 had praedicted, that he should be holden of it. For though those words, 
Psal
 16.8. 
&c.
 in a 
lower sense
 had reference to 
Davids
 person, yet they were more fully, and ultimately to be fulfilled in the 
Son
 of 
David, The eternal word
 of God, The 
Messias
 of the world; and that not only because 
David
 was a Type of him, and did represent his Person, but also because he was now in 
his loins,
 according to the flesh. As these words therefore refer to 
David
 they may be thus Paraphrased; 
I have set the Lord always before me,
 i. e. I have set my thoughts continually on God, as being ever present with me; and because 
he is at my right hand
 ever ready to assist and support me, 
I shall not be moved,
 that is, not swallowed up of my sorrows nor removed from my constant obedience to his will. And upon this account, 
my heart is glad and my tongue rejoyceth, my flesh also shall rest in hope
, that is, When my body shall be laid to rest in the earth, it shall not be with∣out hope of a joyful Resurrection. 
For thou wilt not leave my Soul
 
in Hell,
 that is, my dead body in the grave; nor suffer me utterly to perish in the Pit of corruption so as never to rise again. 
Thou wilt shew me the path of life,
 that is, how I shall after my resurrection live for ever in thy glory, 
Thou wilt make me full of joy with thy countenance,
 that is, In thy presence I shall have fulness of joy forevermore. But these words in their proper and literal sense could not be spoken of 
David,
 because 
David
's body was left in the grave and was there corrupted [See 
Act.
 13.36.37. compar'd with 1 
King.
 2.10.] and therefore they must needs have refe∣rence to Christ, who (as 
David
 saw by the Spirit of Prophecy) was to spring from his Loins. (See 2 
Sam.
 7. and 
Psal.
 132.) and so by the same Spirit he saw also that he was soon to 
rise again from the dead,
 as the 
head
 of his mystical Body, and by virtue of 
his resurrection,
 his members were to rise also.

 And that God had assuredly according to 
David
's Prophecy raised this Jesus from the dead, 
Peter
 declares that he and his fellows could, and did bear their Testimony
. Fourthly, he then speaks to them of his 
Ascension,
 and how after his 
resurrection
 he was exalted to the right hand of God: the consequent of which was, that having received authority and commission from the Father to prour forth his holy Spirit in a plentiful manner, [which he had often before spoken to them of, as in 
Joh.
 14.26. and 15.26. and 16.13, 14.] he had now accordingly done it, and this strange thing of 
their speaking divers tongues,
 (which was so much wondred at by them) was an effect thereof. He further shews that 
David
 never 
ascended,
 or went bodily to Heaven, and so cannot be said to be 
exalted to Gods right hand while his enemies were made his Footstool.
 And therefore the 
person
 of whom that was praedicted, 
Psal
 110.1. (and whom 
David
 there calls 
Lord
) could be no other than 
Christ.
 For Conclusion, he bids all the house of 
Israel
 know assuredly that God the Father had ordained, and appointed 
this Jesus,
 whom they had crucified, to be the 
Head,
 and 
Saviour
 of his Church, and had instated him in the true 
kingly office
 of the 
Messiah
.


A great multitude of the 
Auditors
 were so affected with this Discourse, that being touched with an in∣ward remorse
 for their sins, they ask'd 
Peter
 and the rest of the Apostles 
what they should do? Peter
 exhorts them to 
repent
 and to 
own Christ
 for the true 
Messias,
 and to 
be∣lieve
 in him, and to be 
baptized in his name,
 and then they should be made partakers of the holy Ghost; and some of them possibly, of those miraculous gifts and powers, which they now saw and admired in the Apostles. For upon their 
believing
 in Christ, the pro∣mise made by God in the New Covenant of remission of sins [
Jer.
 31.34. 
Zech.
 13.1.] appertained to 
them,
 and 
to their children
, and to as many of the 
Gentiles
 and 
their Chil∣dren,
 as the Lord should effectually call to 
faith in his Son,
 and therefore they ought to receive 
Baptism
 the 
Seal
 thereof. And with many other words he exhorted them to with-draw, and separate themselves from that untoward generation of the Scribes and Pharisees [See 
Mat.
 3 and 
ch.
 12. and 
ch.
 16.] who so desperately opposed Christ, and his Gospel, and by their autho∣rity and example strove to keep people off from embracing the only way of Salvation opened by him. 'Tis probable, whilst 
Peter
 preached thus to the Jews of 
Judea
 and 
Jerusalem
 in the 
Syriack
 tongue others of the Apostles spake at the same time, and to the same purpose * to several there present of other nations,
 and the success of their preaching was that Three thousand were that day

 converted to Christianity, and by their hands immediately bap∣tized
.


These 
new converts
 being now added to the Church, continued and faithfully persevered in the Apostles Doctrine, and fellow∣ship (performing all Christian offices of love one to another) and in the religious exercise of the duties of Gods Worship, such as 
receiving the Holy Supper, Prayer
 and 
Praising God.
 And a great asto∣nishment seized the people to see the wonderful things that were done by the Apostles. This also is further recorded of these new Converts, that they had their goods (as to the use of them) in common
 in that time of the Churches necessities, and the richer sort sold and par∣ted with some of their possessions and goods to help and relieve the poorer. And fur∣ther their practice was daily to frequent the Temple at the usual hours of prayer, and privately in particular houses to celebrate the Lords Supper. And thus conversing to∣gether with great simplicity and sincerity, they went on cheerfully in their Christian course praising and blessing the Lord for all that he had done for them: and their inno∣cent and harmless conversation procur'd them favour with the generality of the peo∣ple, who had not their hearts prepossess'd with prejudices against Christ, and his Gos∣pel. And thus we have seen what were the first fruits of the Apostles ministry, whose endeavours it pleased God so to bless, that there were daily more and more Converts added to the Church
.

 10. Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and in the parts of Libya, about Cy∣rene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,




v.
 11. Cretes, and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the won∣derful works of God.


v.
 12 And they were all amazed and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?


v.
 13. Others mocking, said, These men are full of new wine.


v.
 14 But Peter standing up with the eleven, lift up his voice and said unto them, Yemen of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:


v.
 15. For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.


v.
 16. But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel,


v.
 17. And it shall come to pass in the last days, (saith God) I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesie, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:


v.
 18. And on my servants, and on my hand-maidens, I will pour out in those days of my Spirit, and they shall prophesie:


v.
 19. And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth be∣neath: blood and fire, and vapour of smoak.


v.
 20. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, be∣fore that great and notable day of the Lord come.


v.
 21. And it sh
ll come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the Name of the Lord, shall be saved.


v.
 22. Ye men of Israel, hear these words, Jesus of Nazareth, a man ap∣proved of God among you, by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye your selves also know:


v.
 23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel, and foreknow∣ledg of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:


v.
 24. Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death, be∣cause it was not possible that he should be holden of it.


v.
 25 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be mo∣ved.


v.
 26. Therefore did my heart rejoyce, and my tongue was glad: more∣over also my flesh shall rest in hope;


v.
 27. Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine holy One to see corruption.


v.
 28. Thou hast made known to me the ways of life, thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.


v.
 29. Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch Da∣vid, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.


v.
 30. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne:


v.
 31. He seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his fl
sh did se
 corruption.


v.
 32. This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.


v.
 33. Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having re∣ceived of the Father the promise of the holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.


v.
 34. For David is not ascended into the heavens, but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,


v.
 35. Until I make thy foes thy footstool.


v.
 36. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.




v.
 37. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the Apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?


v.
 38. Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the holy Ghost.


v.
 39. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.


v.
 40. And with many other words did he testifie and exhort, saying, Save your selves from this untoward generation.


v.
 41. Then they that gladly received his words, were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.


v.
 42. And they continued stedfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.


v.
 43. And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs 
 done by the Apostles.


v.
 44. And all that believed were together, and had all things common:


v.
 45. And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.


v.
 46. And they continued daily with one accord in the temple, and break∣ing bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and single∣ness of heart.


v.
 47. Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the Church daily such as should be saved.










































SECT. III.


ABout the same time 
Peter
 and 
John
 went up to the Temple about three a Clock in the afternoon (being one of the hours of prayer) and there in the 
name of Christ
 they heal
 a cripple lying at the gate of the Tem∣ple (called 
Beautiful
)
 to ask alms,
 who had been lame from his birth, and was now about Forty years old (See 
ch.
 4. 22.) The people being amazed at this mi∣racle flock'd in great multitudes about the Apostles in 
Solomons-Porch,
 earnestly gazing on them, and wondring at this strange cure wrought by them; and the man that was cur'd kept close to them, having received so great a benefit by them. 
Peter
 seeing this, address'd himself to the people shew∣ing them that they were much mistaken, if they thought that this Miracle was wrought by any power, or virtue, that was in such mean men, as they were. No, they durst not arrogate so much to themselves. He assures them it was wrought by no o∣ther power, than that of 
Jesus Christ▪
 whom they had wickedly crucified (preferring 
Barabbas
 a murderer before him): but God had 
raised him from the dead,
 and of his resurrection 
they his Apostles
 were sure, and faithfull witnesses. He shews them it was

 by 
faith,
 and relyance on his power
 (which faith was also his gift, and wrought in them by his Spirit) that they had wrought this cure on this Cripple. He tells them that though they had done very hainously in thus putting to death the 
Prince of life,
 yet he was perswaded
. that most of them did it 
ignorantly,
 not being thorowly convinc'd (though they had evidence enough to have convinced them, had they duly attended to it) that Jesus of 
Nazareth
 was the 
very Messias;
 yet however hereby they had ac∣complished what was praedicted in the Scrip∣tures concerning the sufferings of Christ. He exhorts them therefore to 
repent
 and 
turn to God,
 laying hold on his Grace and Mercy offered in Christ, that their 
sins might be blotted out,
 seeing those blessed
 
refreshing Gospel-times,
 which he had long ago promised, were now come, and he had sent his Son
 into the world, whom the Pro∣phets long ago foretold, and preached of. This Saviour being now ascended he tells them the Heavens must contain (having re∣ceived hi
 Humanity) until the accomplish∣ment
 of all things, which God had spoken by the mouth of all his holy Pro∣phets since the world began; such as are, 
Christs victory over Satan
 in the Salvation of all his people, the Calling of the Jews, and his conquest of the last enemy 
Death, &c.
 He further sheweth them that 
Moses
 had prophesied of this 
Christ,
 under the title of the great Prophet, commanding he should be 
heard and obeyed in all things, Deut.
 18.15.18, 19. and that all the Prophets from 
Sa∣muel
 as many as have spoken have also fore∣told of these days; They therefore should consider that 
they
 were the children of the Prophets, that is, the people to whom God primarily and chiefly sent the Prophets, and the People to whom the 
promise
 and 
cove∣nant
 which God made with 
Abraham, That in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed
 (namely, by giving the Messias to spring from his loins) did primarily apper∣tain. And this Jesus, being that 
promised Messias
 God had now sent into the world, whom, being put to death, he had raised again, and now 
in the power and ministry

 of his Gospel
 had 
first
 sent again to them, to 
bless them
 by turning them from their sins by the powerful operation of his Spirit, and to offer himself unto them as the only Sa∣viour, and Redeemer; and therefore they ought in point of gratitude with all rea∣diness to receive, and embrace him.


Act.
 3. 
v.
 1. Now Peter and John w
nt up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.


v.
 2. And a certain man, lame from his mothers womb, was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entred into the temple.


v.
 3. Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked an alms.


v.
 4. And Peter fastening his eyes upon him, with John, said, Look on us.


v.
 5. And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.


v.
 6. Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, give I thee: In the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.


v.
 7. And he took him by the right hand, and lift him up: and immedi∣ately his feet and ancle-bones received strength.


v.
 8. And he leaping up, stood and walked, and entred with them into the the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.


v.
 9. And all the people saw him walking, and praising God.


v.
 10. And they knew that it was he, which sate for alms at the beautifull gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had hapned unto him.


v.
 11. And as the lame man which was healed, held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them, in the porch that is called Solomons, greatly wondering.


v.
 12. And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?


v.
 13. The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers hath glorified his Son Jesus, whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.


v.
 14. But ye denied the holy One, and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you:


v.
 15. And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead, whereof we are witnesses.


v.
 16. And his Name, through faith in his Name, hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him, hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.


v.
 17. And now brethren, I wote that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.


v.
 18. But those things which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.


v.
 19. Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blot∣ted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.


v.
 20. And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you.




v.
 21. Whom the heaven must rec
ive, until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.


v.
 22. For Moses truly said unto the Fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; Him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you.


v.
 23. And it shall come to pass, that every soul which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.


v.
 24. Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.


v.
 25. Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the Covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kinreds of the earth be blessed.


v.
 26 Unto you first, God having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.






























SECT. IV.


AS the Apostles were thus going on in instructing the People, the 
Priests,
 and 
Sadduces,
 and 
Captain
 of the Roman Band (that was placed in the Tower 
Antonia
 for the guard of the Temple) came upon them, and being greatly enraged
 at the Doctrine they preached, they took them and put them in custody
 that night; yet 
Peter
's Sermon had had so good an ope∣ration upon the people, that with the Three thousand which were before converted 
ch.
 2.41. the number of believers in Christ was now come to be about Five thousand
 The next day the Council being met toge∣ther (in which were 
Annas
 and 
Caiaphas,
 and some others, that were descended of High Priests) the Apostles are now called in question about the 
Miracle,
 they had wrought, and required to give an account by what 
power
 or 
authority
 they had done it. Then 
Peter
 being filled with the Holy Ghost, and an extraordinary measure of Courage, told them plainly, that by the power and authority of Jesus of 
Nazareth
 (whom they had crucified and God had raised from the dead) and by Faith in him, they had wrought this miraculous cure. This he tells them was the Stone
 spoken of, 
Psal.
 118.22. and 
Isa.
 28.16. (which could be meant of no o∣ther than the Messias) who was now re∣jected and dis-esteemed of them who would be accounted the builders of the Church of God with sound Doctrine; yet notwithstanding their rejecting of him he tells them he is certainly 
the head of the corner
, and the principal Stone, or chief part of the whole spiritual building, his true Church being the Person in whom the strength of the building lyes, and by whom the two walls of the building, 
viz. Jews
 and 
Gen∣tiles
 are joined together, and made up into one House and Church; neither is Salvati∣on to be attain'd 
by
 or 
through
 the mediati∣on of any other person whatsoever. From 
v.
 1. to 13.




The Council much marvelled at this boldness, and freedom of speech, wherewith the Apostles expressed themselves, seeing their education had been such as could not raise them above mean and ordinary men. But then they were told, or else some of them remembred, that they were such as had attended upon Je∣sus in his life time. However though they were convinced of the truth of the Miracle wrought by them, yet after they had debated upon the matter among themselves, they judged it fit strictly to prohibit them to preach any more in 
the name
 of Je∣sus; which injunction the Apostles would by no means yeild obedience unto, alledging that it was much more right and fit 
to obey God, than them;
 and declared, that they could not choose but proclaim for the benefit of others those truths concerning Christ of so high importance, which themselves had certain know∣ledg of, being eye and ear-witnesses of them. However not∣withstanding this rational Plea, the 
Council
 added some further threatnings to terrifie them, and so dismissed them, having no∣thing to lay to their charge, but only that for which the people looked on them with admiration and glorified God for working by them. From 13. to 23.


The Apostles being thus dismiss'd, went immediately to their own company (that is the Society of those Hundred and twenty mentioned 
ch.
 1.15.) and acquainted them with what had happened unto them. 
The Brethren being much affected herewith betake themselves, by fervent prayer unto the Lord, ac∣knowledging that what he had long ago praedicted by his Pro∣phet 
David
 
Psal.
 2.1. concerning the Messias, was now come to pass. For the Jews had highly opposed him, the 
anoint∣ed
 of the Lord, and invented false things against him, and the Roman Gover∣nours in 
Palestine, Herod,
 and 
Pontius Pilat
 had combined against him, and the Jewish 
Sanhedrin
 had joined their malicious Coun∣sels to destroy him, and in opposing him, had also opposed God the Father who sent him. All this they had done, and thereby had been instruments to act that which God before determined 
(h), viz.
 that his Son should be put to death for the sins of men. And now God having raised him again from the dead, and commanded his Apostles to preach him to the world, these Jews had with great threatnings forbidden them: Whereupon they humbly beseech the Lord

 to enable them his Servants, and Ministers to preach his word with all boldness and courage▪ and to give them power to work miraculous cures in the name of Jesus for the confirmation of the Gospel.


Upon this prayer of theirs there came a 
wind
 from heaven like to that mentioned Chap. 2.2. and shook the place where they were assembled, and special eminent gifts
 of the Spirit fell upon them, and especially they were indued with a greater measure of boldness to preach the Gospel even in the midst of persecution, and this was such a confirmation to them, that despising the ter∣rors of the Jews, they with greater confi∣dence publish'd the Gospel of Christ than before. This also is further to be observed concerning this infant Church, and these primitive disciples, that they maintain'd a great union and concord
 among them∣selves both in Doctrine and Opinion, in Heart and Affection, and had such enlarged bowels toward one another, that no man esteemed what he had his own when the Churches necessity required it for the help of such among them as were in want.


The Apostles also with great authority and assurance gave testimony to the 
Resurrection
 of Christ, and their Doctrine found great favour and acceptation with the People. And those of the disciples, that had possessions sold them
 and laid down the mony received for them, at the Apostles feet to be distributed by their advice, and counsel, to every one as they had need. In which business 
Bar∣nabas
 a 
Levite
 gave an eminent example, who having a piece of Land of his own (not part of the 
Levites
 portion, which he might not alienate, but probably somewhat, which belonged to him in 
Cyprus
 where he was born) made sale of it, and brought the full price of it, and put it wholly in the Apostles power to dispose of, and to

 distribute as they saw occasion among those of the Church that were in want and necessity.


Act.
 4. 
v.
 1. And as they sp
ke unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple, and the Sadduces came upon them.


v.
 2. Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.


v.
 3. And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now even-
ide.


v.
 4. Howbeit, many of them which heard the word, believed, and the number of the men was about five thousand.


v.
 5. And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,


v.
 6. And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kinred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.


v.
 7. And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power or by what Name have ye done this?


v.
 8. Then Peter filled with the holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel.


v.
 9. If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole.


v.
 10. Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.


v.
 11. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.


v.
 12. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.


v.
 13. Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned, and ignorant men, they marvelled, and they took knowledg of them, that they had been with Jesus.


v.
 14. And beholding the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.


v.
 15. But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves.


v.
 16. Saying, What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.


v.
 17. But that it spread no furth
r among the people, let us straitly threa∣ten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this Name.


v.
 18. And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach in the N
me of Jesus.


v.
 19. But Peter and John answered, and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judg ye.


v.
 20. For we cannot but speak the things which we have s
n and 
rd.


v.
 21. So wh
n they had further threatned them, they l
t t
m go, fi
ding nothing how they might punish them, b
c
use o
 th
 p
ople, for all men glorifi
d God for that which was done.


v.
 22. For the man was above fourty years old, on whom this mi
cle of healing w
s sh
w
d.


v.
 23. And b
ing let go, th
y went to th
ir own comp
ny, and rep
rted all that the chi
f priests and elders had said unto th
m.


v.
 24. And when th
y heard that, they li
t up their voice to God with

 one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God which hast made heaven and earth and the sea, and all that in them is,


v.
 25. Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?


v.
 26. The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered to∣gether against the Lord, and against his Christ.


v.
 27. For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel were gathered together.


v.
 28. For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.


v.
 29. And now Lord, behold their threatnings, and grant unto thy ser∣vants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,


v.
 30. By stretching forth thine hand to heal: and that signs and wonders may be done by the N
me of thy holy child Jesus.


v.
 31. And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.


v.
 32. And the multitude of them that believed, were of one heart, and of one soul: neither said any of them, that ought of the things which he possessed, was his own, but they had all things common.


v.
 33. And with great power gave the Apostles witness of the resurrecti∣on of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.


v.
 34. Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands, or houses, sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,


v.
 35. And laid them down at the Apostles feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.


v.
 36. And Joses, who by the Apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation) a Levite, and of the countrey of Cyprus,


v.
 37. Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the Apostles feet.






















SECT. VII.


ANanias
 and 
Sapphira
 his wife pretending to follow this example fraudently kept back by joynt consent part of the price for which they had sold a possession, and yet pre∣tended to lay down all the price it was sold for at the Apostles feet. For which Hypocrisie, and lying to, or in the presence of the Holy Ghost, and thinking to go undiscovered of that Spirit, which wrought so powerfully in the Apostles, and to impose upon God himself, as if he saw not what men secretly did, and presumptuously tempting him, and trying (as it were) whether he would be so severe to punish it, or no, they are stricken dead, and great fear fell on all that heard of these things.


Act.
 5.1. But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,


v.
 2. And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the Apostles feet.


v.
 3. But Peter said, Ananias, Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lye to the holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?


v.
 4. Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.


v.
 5. And Ananias hearing these words, fell down and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.


v.
 6. And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.


v.
 7. And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife not knowing what was done came in.


v.
 8. And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for 
o much. And she said, Yea for so much.




v.
 9. Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of them that have bu∣ried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.


v.
 10. Then fell she down straitway at his feet, and yeilded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.


v.
 11. And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.














SECT. VIII.


THE Apostles having thus manifested the power of Christ, and his Justice in this example of 
Ananias
 and 
Sapphira,
 they also manifested his graciousness and mercy in working ma∣ny miraculous cures in his Name, in healing the diseased, and delivering the possessed; insomuch, that the people brought forth their sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at least the 
Shadow
 of 
Peter
 pas∣sing by, might overshadow some of them. And these acts of mercy were as necessary for the propagating of the Gospel, and to invite people to believe in Christ, as those other of severity were for the restraining those corruptions wherewith Satan would otherwise have infected the Church in its minority; and to prevent the intrusion of Hypocrites
. The Apostles and Believers had at this present their place of meeting and assembling to preach the Gospel in 
So∣lomon
's Porch
, which was the East-Cloy∣ster of the Mount of the Temple [See 1 
King.
 6.3.], in part of which the 
Sanhe∣drim
 used to sit, and yet they are not afraid to come so nigh unto them. But such of their hearers as were not sincere, durst not join themselves to them, having seen the severity on 
Ananias
 and 
Sapphira
 for their Hypocrisie; yet multitudes of others were added to the Church daily; and the common people seeing the wonders that were done by them, and their eminent gifts and endowments, could not but extol and magnifie them
. 
From ver.
 12, 
to
 17.


Hereupon the High-Priest, and those that were with him (most of them of the Sect of the 
Sadduces
) set themselves ve∣ry zealously against them; and apprehending them, put them into the common Gaol; from whence being freed the night follow∣ing by an Angel, they are commanded by Him to go again, and preach boldly in the 
Temple
 the Doctrine of Christ, which de∣clares unto men the right way unto eternal life
. The Council meeting next morn∣ing, sent to the Prison for them, but find them not there; for they were preaching in the Temple; from thence they are brought before them by the Captain and Officers, yet without violence: for they feared the people would stone them, if they used such per∣sons harshly who had done so many cures among them. Being

 now again brought before the Council, they are here accu∣sed of two things. 1. Of 
Contumacy,
 in persisting to preach the Gospel, notwithstanding they were strictly forbidden. 2. Of 
Sedition,
 as if they endeavoured to stir up the people to avenge the blood of Jesus upon the Rulers, perswading them it was by them most unjustly shed. 
Peter,
 in the name of the rest, answers to the first of these, acknowledging they had not obeyed them in that their Injunction, because they had commanded that which was contrary to God's Com∣mand; and in such a case it was just and reasonable, that God should be obeyed, and not they. He tells them, That though they had dealt most injuriously and maliciously with Jesus of 
Nazareth,
 and had crucified him; yet God had raised him again from the dead, and exalted him
 to his 
ight hand in Heaven, and instated him in his Regal Power, that he might, as a 
Spiri∣tual Prince,
 rule and protect his Church; and, as a 
Saviour,
 send his Spirit into the Hearts of Sinners, to draw them to Re∣pentance, and belief in himself
 that so they might receive remission of sins, and all the blessed consequents thereof. He de∣clares, that 
they his Apostles
 did bear their testimony to the truth of these things; and so did the 
Holy Ghost
, who descending up∣on them, and others also (who believed in Christ, and yielded obedience to him), en∣dowed them with extraordinary gifts
, and enabled them to do miraculous cures: And if their testimony were false, certainly it would never have been so confirmed. From 
Ver.
 12, 
to
 30.


These words so enraged
 the Coun∣cil, and cut them to the heart, that they presently entred into consultation of put∣ting the Apostles to death; but were divert∣ed from that wicked intendment, by the advice of 
Gamaliel,
 a learn'd and grave Se∣nator, and of much repute among them; who told them, that 
if this work were of men, it would come to nought;
 as he proves by two instances, one of 
Theudas
, who gave him∣self out to be some excellent person sent of

 God for the delivering of the Jews; and the other, of 
Judas of Galilee
, who in the time of the 
Tax
 laid by 
Augustus
 rai∣sed a Sedition, disswading the people from paying it; Both which persons he tells them gathered many followers after them, but miserably miscarried in their enterprize. But he further shews them that if this work were of God, they could not possibly overthrow it, neither ought they to attempt it, least therein they should shew themselves to be fighters against God.


This advice being so 
rational,
 it prevailed with them to desist from their former intention. Yet notwithstanding sending for the Apostles again into the Court they appointed them to be scourged
, and strictly charging them not to preach any more in the name of Christ
, dismissed them. But they were so far from being discouraged
 by these things, that they went away rejoycing, that they were counted worthy
 to suffer shame for his sake. And daily both in the Temple, and in private houses they ceased not to preach Jesus Christ.


Act.
 5. 
v.
 12. And by the hands of the Apostles were many signs, and wonders wrought among the people (And they were all with one ac∣cord in Solomons porch.


v.
 13. And of the rest durst no man joyn himself to them: but the people magnified them.


v.
 14. And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women)


v.
 15. Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by, might overshadow some of them.


v.
 16. There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Je∣rusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one,


v.
 17. Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him. (which is the sect of the Sadduces) and were filled with indignation.


v.
 18. And laid their hands on the Apostles, and put them in the com∣mon prison.


v.
 19. But the Angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,


v.
 20. Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.


v.
 21. And when they heard that, they entred into the temple early in the morning, and taught: but the high priest came, and they that were

 with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.


v.
 22. But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,


v.
 23. Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.


v.
 24. Now when the high priest, and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.


v.
 25. Then came one and told them, saying. Behold, the men whom ye put in prison, are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.


v.
 26. Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence (For they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned)


v.
 27. And when th
y had brought them, they set them before the coun∣cil, and the high priest asked them,


v.
 28. Saying, Did not we straitly command you that you should not teach in this Name? And behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this mans blood upon us.


v.
 29. Then Peter, and the other Apostles answered, and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.


v.
 30. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.


v.
 31. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Sa∣viour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.


v.
 32. And we are his witnesses of these things, and so is also the holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.


v.
 33. When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took coun∣sel to slay them.


v.
 34. Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel a doctor of law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the Apostles forth for a little space.


v.
 35. And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to your selves, what ye intend to do as touching these men.


v.
 36. For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be some∣body, to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joyned them∣selves: who was slain, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.


v.
 37. After this man rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished, and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.


v.
 38. And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought.


v.
 39. But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.


v.
 40. And to him they agreed: and when they had called the Apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the Name of Jesus and let them go.


v.
 41. And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoycing that that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his Name.


v.
 42. And daily in the temple, and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.
















SECT. IX.


THe number of Believers now increasing at 
Jerusalem,
 there arose (as it commonly happens among a multitude) a murmuring of the 
Hellenists
 (that is such Jews as were dispersed among the 
Grae∣cians,
 and were born, or lived in Heathen Countries, and used the Greek Translation of the Old Testament, and the Greek Tongue, yet savouring something of the Hebrew Phrases and manner of speaking) against the Hebrews (who were such Jews as inhabited 
Judea,
 and spake the Syriack Language) because their Widdows
 were neglected, and received less, than the Widdows of the Hebrews, in the daily distribution of the Churches moneys. The Apostles desiring to have the poor well provided for, yet being them∣selves taken up with dispensing the word, (the food of the soul,) and so not at leisure to attend that other service; by their ad∣vice, and the suffrages of the Church, there were Seven men of good report for wisdom and the endowments of the Spirit, cho∣sen out of the Hundred and Eight, mentioned before, 
ch.
 1. to be Stewards of the Churches stock
, unto which they were ordained by the imposition of hands
. Among those 
Stephen,
 and 
Philip
 were the most eminent, whose story is particularly related. Thus the Gospel went on successfully, and the num∣ber of the Disciples increased daily, yea some of the Priests
 themselves (formerly bitter enemies to Christ) now embraced the faith, and were joined to the Church.


Act.
 6. 
v.
 1. And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplyed, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the He∣brews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.


v.
 2. Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.


v.
 3. Wherefore brethren, look you out among you seven men of honest report, full of the holy Ghost, and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.




v.
 4. But we will give our selves continually to prayer, and to the ministery of the word.


v.
 5. And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen a man full of faith, and of the holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch.


v.
 6. Whom they set before the Apostles, and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.


v.
 7. And the word of God increased, and the number of the disciples mul∣tiplied in Jerusalem greatly, and a great company of the priests were obe∣dient to the faith.








SECT. X.


STephen
 being thus chosen to be one of the first Deacons, and being a man full of Faith, and power
 to work Miracles, he accordingly does many wonders among the people, and stoutly defends the cause of Christ against several persons of the Sy∣nagogue of the Libertins
, and of some other Synagogues, that disputed with him, who when they were not able to resist the wisdom, and spirit, by which he spake, they falsly accus'd him, and bringing him before the Council, set up false witnesses
 a∣gainst him, who declared they heard him speak blasphemous words against 
Moses,
 and against God, and that he should say that Jesus would destroy the Temple, and City
, and change the Customs, and Rites which 
Moses
 had instituted,
 and commanded from God.




v.
 8. And Steven full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.


v.
 9. Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the syna∣gogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia, and of Asia, disputing with Steven.


v.
 10. And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.


v.
 11. Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blas∣phemous words against Moses, and against God.


v.
 12. And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the Coun∣cil:


v.
 13. And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.


v.
 14. For we have heard him say, That this Jesus of Nazareth shall de∣stroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.








SECT. II.


STephen
 being thus brought before the Council, his face
 appeared full of Majesty, and Splendor, not unlike possi∣bly to that which 
Moses
's face had, 
Exod.
 34.30. or such as the Angels appeared with, 
Mat.
 28.3. An argument of a clear consci∣ence, and of the divine assistance, and pre∣sence. Being permitted to speak for him∣self, he in a long and grave oration ap∣plyes himself to answer the charge that was brought against him. And because these his accusers, and others of the Jews (as it seems) imagined that God was so delighted and pleased with the Temple, and the Temple-Service, and the Mosaical, Rites that he in∣tended always to continue and perpetuate them, and that no other way of Worship could be acceptable to him; therefore by an historical deduction he shews them that God was worshipped aright before either Tabernacle or Temple was made, or any of the Mosaical Rites instituted or ordained, and therefore the true Worship of God was not necessarily, and inseparably annexed to any of these things. For the proof of this he begins at 
Abra∣ham,
 and shews them how that he living of old at 
Ʋr
 of the 
Chaldeans
 in the midst of Idolaters [
Josh.
 24.2, 3.] God was pleased of his free mercy to manifest himself to him
 about the seventieth year of his age, and effectually to enlighten him by his grace, and savingly to draw him to own, and worship him the true God: and commanding him to leave his native Country, and go into a land which he would shew him, he promised to make of him a great nation, and that 
in him, all the families of the earth should be blessed. Abraham
 obeying this command, drew on his father 
Terah
 also with him; and so they came from 
Ʋr
 to 
Charran,
 where he served God till the death of his father, which was about five years after. His father being dead he was again called by God to leave that Country, and to go into 
Canaan,
 which accordingly he did, and there God promised 
that to his seed he would give that land,
 but they must first endure a long servitude in 
Egypt.
 Af∣ter he had a good while sojourned in 
Canaan,
 when he was Nine∣ty nine years old
 God made a Covenant with him, and in∣stituted Circumcision as the Seal thereof, so that from his first Call from 
Ʋr,
 when he was seventy years of age to this time when he was Ninety nine, he had served God faithfully, yet without 
cir∣cumcision
 to this present time. After this, 
Abraham
 begat 
Isaac,
 and 
Isaac
 begat 
Jacob,
 and 
Jacob
 the Twelve Patriarchs: and the Patriarchs moved with envy sold 
Joseph
 into 
Egypt,
 where the Lord was with him, and by his wonderful providence rai∣sed him up to be chief Governour of the country under 
Pha∣raoh,


 so that in the time of the Famine he sent for his father, and his family, being Seventy five souls, to come down into E∣gypt, and nourished them there. 
Jacob,
 after some time spent there, died in Egypt, and so all the rest of his sons after him, and in testimony of their Faith, and belief of the Promise, that God had made unto 
Abraham
 of giving the land of 
Canaan
 to his Seed, they commanded that their bones
 should be carried into the land of 
Canaan,
 and buried there.


The Children of Israel now growing, and encreasing to a vast multitude in Egypt, in tract of time, there arose a 
Pha∣raoh,
 that 
knew not Joseph,
 who fearing the number, and strength of the Israelites, exceedingly oppressed them; and to prevent their encreasing, made a barbarous Edict, that their male chil∣dren should be killed as soon as they were born, or else drowned in the river*. In the time of this Edict, 
Moses
 was born to 
Am∣ram
 and 
Jochebed
 his wife, who being a very lovely child, his Parents hid him three months in their house; but at last not da∣ring to conceal him any longer, they put him in a basket of Bul∣rushes, daubed over with flime and pitch, and laid it in the flags by the side of the River. Here the Kings Daughter finds him; and moved with compassion towards the Infant, nourisheth him up for her own son, putting him out to his own Mother to nurse: and caused him to be educated in all the 
learning
 of the 
Egypti∣ans,
 so that he proved a person of great abilities above other men, being very able both to give counsel, and to act any great affair. When he grew to the age of Forty, it came into his mind to visit his brethren the Israelites; and among other things that evidenced to him their sad condition, he saw an Egyptian smiting an Israelite, which so stirred up his spirit, that he slew the Egyptian who did the wrong, thereby giving the Israelites the first intimation, that God would deliver them by his hand, (which it seems God had by instinct, or revelation made known unto himself,) but they understood it not. The next day seeing two Israelites at variance, he would have made them friends, and set them 
at one
 again. But he, who did the wrong upbrai∣ded him for it, and said, 
Who made thee a ruler, and a judg over us? wilt thou kill me as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday? Moses


 perceiving hereby, that what he had done to the Egyptian was known, and that the King hereupon would seek his life, he fled from thence into the land 
Midian,
 where he spent other Forty years of his life, and married 
Zippora, Jethro
's daughter, and by her had two Sons. The children of Israel continuing still under sore bondage in Egypt; it pleased the Lord now at length to com∣passionate them, and to resolve to deliver them. Wherefore, when 
Moses
 had been Forty years in 
Midian,
 as he was keeping his father-in-laws sheep about 
Horeb,
 or 
Sinai,
 the Angel of the Lord appeared to him out of a burning Bush, and called him to go to 
Pharaoh,
 requiring him to deliver his people Israel. 
Moses
 after he had shewed many signs and wonders in 
Egypt
 at last brought them out. And leading them through the red Sea, he brought them into the wilderness to Mount 
Sinai,
 where God gave them his law, and appointed 
Moses
 to make a Tabernacle for his worship according to the pattern he had shewed him in the Mount. So that to this day for above Four hundred years, he shews them, the Fathers had worshipped God without any Tabernacle at all.


He further shews them, that though 
Moses
 was a person high∣ly to be regarded, whose memory ought always to be precious to them, having had intimate converse with God, and having received the law from his mouth, yet they might remember to their humiliation how their impious Ancestors would not obey him; but contrary to his mind, during his absence in the Mount, made a golden Calf
 and ador'd it. They might also call to mind how 
Moses
 told them before hand, of a 
great Prophet
 the Lord would raise up in due time, whom they were to hear, and obey in all things. And 
this great Prophet,
 who was no other person than the 
Messias,
 was now come. Moreover they might consider how that when the Tabernacle was made by 
Moses,
 and all the worship of God appertaining to it appointed, their rebellious Ancestors not∣withstanding, did not long continue faith∣full to it, but God for their sins leaving them to themselves, and to their own hearts lusts, they fell to worship the Host of Heaven
 the 
Sun, Moon, and Stars,
 upon which it was that the Lord so highly expostulates with the people of Israel, 
Amos
 5.25. de∣nying that their Ancestors offer'd such sa∣crifice to him in the wilderness as was plea∣sing in his sight.
 And though they made shew of serving him by carrying his Taber∣nacle, and all things belonging to it, yet they hankred after their Idols, which they not only bare in their hearts, but also car∣ried

 about with them representations of them. For it seems they had gotten the Shrines, or Chaplets, wherein the mages of 
Moloch
 and 
Saturn
 were kept and inshrined, and carried them about with them, and wor∣shipped them. Which Idolatry of their An∣cestors not sufficiently bewailed, and repent∣ed of, together with the consequent sins of their children in succeeding ages, at last pro∣voked God to bring the captivity of 
Babylon
 upon them
. But to return to the Ta∣bernacle, (where God used to witness, and evidence his glorious presence, and where the Ark of the Covenant was, and the Law, and the Testimonies, evidences of Gods will how he would be served) he shews, their Fa∣thers indeed carried it with them all along through the wilderness, and at last brought it into 
Canaan,
 where it continued all the days of 
David,
 and to the beginning of 
Solomons
 reign; and then it ended, and gave way to the Temple: which though 
David
 desired to build for the Service of God, yet that honour was reserved for 
Solomon
 his Son, who accordingly built it in a very sump∣tuous and magnificent manner. Now when the Temple was built, God himself declared by the mouth of his Prophet 
Isaiah, ch.
 66.1, 2. That he delighted not to dwell in Temples made with hands, as if he were in∣cluded therein, and bound thereto. And therefore they were not fondly to conceive that after the Temple was built the worship of God was so tyed to that place as he could not be worshipt ac∣ceptably any where else —. As 
Stephen
 was thus going on, and (as 'tis probable) would have spoken much more fully to the point in hand, the Council it seems interrupted him, apprehen∣ding him to speak in a way of diminution of the Temple. There∣fore breaking off his former discourse, and turning his speech to them, he sharply reprehends them for several things
. 1. For their rebellion, and resisting the Spirit of God, which spake to them by the Apostles and by him. 2. For their imita∣ting their cruel Ancestors, who killed the old Prophets in killing the Lord of life. 3. For their horrible violating the holy law of God given them by the glorious ministry and proclamation of Angels
. At these words they were extreamly inraged at him, and gnashed on him with their teeth. But he being full of courage and faith looked up to Heaven, and had an extraordi∣nary Vision of the glory of God, and of Jesus Christ standing on his right hand, and accordingly declared unto them what he saw. They hearing this, without any more ado, in a violent furious manner ran upon him as a Blasphemer: and though the

 Romans permitted them not to put any man to death, yet in a popular rage, they hurried him away out of the City, and there stoned him. And they that witnessed against him
, (and were therefore by the Law to cast the first stone at him, 
Deut.
 17.7.) put off their upper garments to sit themselves for the work, and a young man called 
Saul
 undertook to look to them, who consequently had an hand in stoning of him. 
Stephen
 devoutly commending his Soul into the hands of Christ, and praying for his murderers, that this sin might not be laid to their charge so as to obstruct their repentance
, gave up the Ghost.


Act.
 6. 
v.
 15. And all that sit in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an Angel.


Act.
 7 
v.
 1. Then said the high priest, Are these things so?


v.
 2. And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken: The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,


v.
 3. And said unto him, * G
t thee out of thy country, and from thy kin∣red, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.


v.
 4. Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Char∣ran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell.


v.
 5. And he gave him none inheritance in it, no not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.


v.
 6. And God spake on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into bondage, and intreat them evil four hundred years.


v.
 7. And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage, will I judg, said God: And after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.


v.
 8. And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day: and Isaac begat Ja∣cob, and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.


v.
 9. And the patriarchs moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,


v.
 10. And delivered him out of all his affliction, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt: and he made him gover∣nour over Egypt, and all his house.


v.
 11. Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers found no sustenance.


v.
 12. But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.


v.
 13. And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren, and Josephs kinred was made known to Phraoh.


v.
 14. Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kinred, threescore and fifteen souls.


v.
 15. So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers.


v.
 16. And were carried over into Sichem, and laid in the s
pulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emor the father of Sichem.


v.
 17. But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,


v.
 18. Till another King arose, which knew not Joseph.




v.
 19. The same dealt subtilly with our kinred, and evil-intreated our fa∣thers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.


v.
 20. In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair: and nou∣rished up in his fathers house three months:


v.
 21. And when he was cast out, Pharaohs daughter took him up, and nou∣rished him for her own son.


v.
 22. And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.


v.
 23. And when he was full fourty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.


v.
 24. And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:


v.
 25. For he supposed his brethren would have understood, how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.


v.
 26. And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren, Why do ye wrong one to another?


v.
 27. But he that did his neighbour wrong, thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judg over us?


v.
 28. Wilt thou kill me as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday?


v.
 29. Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Ma∣dian, where he begat two sons.


v.
 30. And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai, an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.


v.
 31. When Moses saw it, he wondred at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,


v.
 32. Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.


v.
 33. Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.


v.
 34. I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them: And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.


v.
 35. This Moses whom they refused, saying. Who made thee a ruler and a judg? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer, by the hands of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.


v.
 36. He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness fourty years.


v.
 37. This is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me: him shall ye hear.


v.
 38. This is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel, which spake to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who re∣ceived the lively Oracles to give unto us.


v.
 39. To whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,


v.
 40. Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: For as for this Moses which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.


v.
 41. And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol; and rejoyced in the works of their own hands.


v.
 42. Then God turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have

 ye offer'd to me slain beasts, and sacrifices, by the space of forty years in the wilderness?


v.
 43. Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made, to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.


v.
 44. Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen:


v.
 45. Which also our fathers that came after, brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David.


v.
 46. Who found savour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.


v.
 27. But Solomon built him an house.


2.48. Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as saith the prophet,


v.
 49. H
aven is my throne, and earth is my foot-stool: what house will ye build me, saith the Lord? or, what is the place of my rest?


v
 50. Hath not my hands made all these things?


v.
 51. Ye stiff-necked, and uncircumcised in heart, and ears, ye do always resist the holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.


v.
 52. Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? And they have sl
in them which shewed before of the coming of the just One, of whom ye have b
en now the betrayers and murderers:


v.
 53. Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.


v.
 54. When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.


v.
 55. But he being full of the holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into hea∣ven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand o
 God,


v.
 56. And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.


v.
 57. Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord.


v.
 58. And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young mans feet, whose name was Saul.


v.
 59. And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus receive my spirit.


v.
 60. And he kneeled down, and cryed with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.








































SECT. XII.


STephen
 becoming thus the Protomartyr, and first, that under the Gospel sealed the Doctrine of Christ with his blood, he was carried to his burial by devout men, who made great Lamen∣tation
 over him. But the spite and cruelty of the Jews was not quenched by the blood of 
Stephen,
 but rather inflamed. For immediately after this, they raised a great persecution against the whole Church at 
Jerusalem,
 wherein 
Saul
 (the young man before mentioned) was very active. This mans Parents were both 
Jews,
 so that he was an 
Hebrew
 of the 
Hebrews;
 he was of the Tribe of 
Benjamin
 born
 at 
Tar∣sus
 in 
Cilicia;
 by Sect a 
Pharisee,
 and the Son of a 
Pharisee
, and studied at that time (as it seems) at 
Jerusalem,
 and frequented the School of 
Gamaliel
 a famous Doctor among the 
Pharisees.
 He was a ve∣ry strict observer of the Law of 
Moses,
 and of the Traditions delivered to the Fathers, but a bitter, and fierce enemy against the Doctrine of Christ, and all those that owned him, and professed to believe in him. This man having received Commission from the Chief Priests impowring him to do this wretched work, made miserable havock of the Church: for entring into Houses, he ha∣led thence both men and women, that be∣lieved in Christ, and bound them, and put them in Prison, and often caused to be bea∣ten and scourged in the Synagogues; and used all scourged in the Synagogues; and used all rigid means to make them deny Christ, and blaspheme him (as it seems) he himself did [1 
Tim.
 1.13.]: And such as were constant to the faith, he forced to fly to heathen Cities, and then pursued them thither also.


Act.
 8. 
v.
 1. And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem, and they were all scattered abroad thorowout the Regions of Judea, and Samaria, except the Apostles.


v.
 2. And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great la∣mentation over him.


v.
 3. As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entring into every house, and hailing men and women, committed them to Prison.




Phil.
 3. 
v.
 5. Circumcised the eighth day, of the flock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the law, a Pharisee.


v.
 6. Concerning zeal, persecuting the church: touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.


Act.
 22. 
v.
 3. I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zea∣lous towards God, as ye all are this day.


v.
 4. And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering in∣to prisons both men and women.


v.
 19. And I said, Lord, they know I imprisoned and beat in every syna∣gogue them that believed on thee,


v.
 20. And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.


Act.
 26. 
v.
 9. I verily thought with my self, that I ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jesus of Nazareth:


v.
 10. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints did I shut up in prison; having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.


v.
 11. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.


Gal.
 1. 
v.
 13. For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:


v.
 14. And profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.


v.
 23. But they had heard only, that he which persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith, which once he destroyed.


Act.
 9. 
v.
 13. Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:


v.
 21. But all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this Name in Jerusalem, and came hi∣ther for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?








SECT. XIII.


THis persecution dispers'd in a manner the whole body of the Church, and scattered both the Members and Tea∣chers thereof, (excepting the Apostles
) into divers Countries, which tended greatly to the advantage of the Gospel. For the Apostles (who had an extraordinary Functi∣on, and therefore were bound to shew more than ordinary courage) remaining at 
Jeru∣salem,
 and sticking to their work there, till they should be more manifestly called by God from thence; the rest of the Disciples (of which there were now some thousands, as appears 
Act.
 2.41. and 
ch.
 4.4.) were scattered some into the Regions of 
Judea
 and 
Samaria,
 who spread the Gospel wheresoever they came; some went to 
Da∣mascus,
 among whom was 
Ananias
 a devout and religious per∣son, 
Act.
 9.10. & 22.12. Others, it's like, went to 
Rome,
 and among them 
Andronicus
 and 
Junia,
 who were of note among the Apostles, and kinsmen of the Persecutor 
Saul,
 and had em∣braced the faith before him, as himself testifieth, 
Rom.
 16.7. Others travelled as far as 
Phoenice,
 and 
Cyprus,
 and 
Antioch,
 preaching the Gospel to the 
Jews
 only [
Act.
 11.19.] namely to those 
Jews,
 that were dispersed among the 
Gentiles,
 as may be gathered from 
Jam.
 1.1. and 1 
Pet.
 1.1. Among them that went to 
Samaria, Philip
 was one, (the second in order after 
Stephen
 among the seven Deacons). He coming into that City, preached Christ so effectually, that the people with one accord gave heed to the Doctrine he delivered, and seeing the Miracles
 wrought by him, they were perswaded to embrace the Gospel. For out of many that were possessed, he cast un∣clean Spirits who at their coming out, made loud acknowledg∣ments of the irresistableness of the power by which he acted. And others, that were taken with Palsies, or were lame he cu∣red. Before this time, there had been in the City, one 
Simon
 a Magician, who had by Sorcery, and the help of the Devil done some strange things among them, which so affected the igno∣rant people, that they cryed him up as a person in whom the great power of God did wonderfully manifest its self. But they now seeing far greater Miracles done by 
Philip,
 they were converted to Christianity, and many among them, both men and women be∣lieving, were baptized by him in the name of Christ. And a∣mong others 
Simon Magus
 himself was convinced, and belie∣ved
, and was also baptized.




Act.
 8. 
v.
 1. And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusa∣lem, and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Ju∣dea, and Samaria, except the Apostles.


v.
 4. Therefore they that were scattered abroad, went every where prea∣ching the word.


v.
 5. Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.


v.
 6. And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.


v.
 7. For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with Palsies, and that were lame, were healed.


v.
 8. And there was great joy in that city.


v.
 9. But there was a certain man, called Simon, which before time in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one.


v.
 10. To whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.


v.
 11. And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had be∣witched them with forceries.


v.
 12. But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the Name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.


v.
 13. Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondred, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
















SECT. XIIII.


THe Apostles which remained at 
Jerusalem
 hearing of the success of 
Philip
's preaching at 
Samaria
 thought fit to send 
Peter
 and 
John,
 to confirm the new Converts there in the Faith, and to settle all convenient order among them. They accordingly coming thither, by their prea∣ching and exhortation confirmed them in the Doctrine of the Gospel. These believing 
Samaritans
 had received the grace of the Spirit, whereby they were enabled to believe in Christ; but the miraculous gifts of the Spirit were not as yet fallen upon any of them; whereupon the Apo∣stles by their earnest prayer unto God obtained this mercy for them, and accordingly by the imposition
 of their hands upon certain persons among them, whom they were directed by the Holy Ghost to lay their hands upon (as those God had appointed to be prea∣chers, and ministers of the Gospel, and whom by these their gifts he would enable to understand the language and sense of the Scripture, and to be instructors of the peo∣ple) those miraculous powers were confer∣red on them. 
Simon Magus
 seeing this, and being touched with a secret Ambition to get this power of conferring these miracu∣lous gifts of the Holy Ghost upon whom∣soever he pleased, (which would have made him famous and renowned in the world) he offered the Apostles a sum of 
(c)
 money to inable him to do it. 
Peter
 inflam'd with an holy indignation at this wretched moti∣on, said unto him, 
Thy mony perish with thee.
 Assure thy self, 
No share, or portion of so glorious a priviledg as this is, belongs unto thee.
 For I perceive thou art not upright before God, but thy 
hypocrisie
 and 
ambiti∣on,
 by which thy heart is as it were bound and fettered, is as odious to him as the bitterness of Gall can be to any mans taste. Repent therefore, and humble thy self un∣feignedly before the Lord for this wicked project of thine, and earnestly seek his pardon, which if thou wilt do sincerely 'tis not impossible but thou mayst obtain it. 
Simon
 at this besought 
them
 that they would pray for him, that God would pardon this wick∣edness of his, and not inflict on him such punishments as they see∣med to intimate, were like to fall upon him.


When these two Apostles had finished their ministry in those parts they returned to 
Jerusalem
 preaching, and disseminating

 the Gospel, in the Villages of 
Samaria
 as they passed along.


Act.
 8. 
v.
 14. Now when the Apostles which were at Jerusalem, heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John.


v.
 15. Who when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the holy Ghost.


v.
 16. (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were bapti∣zed in the Name of the Lord Jesus)


v.
 17. Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the holy Ghost.


v.
 18. And when Simon saw that through laying on of the Apostles hands, the holy Ghost was given, he offerred them money,


v.
 19. Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the holy Ghost.


v.
 20. But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.


v.
 21. Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.


v.
 22. Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.


v.
 23. For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.


v.
 24. Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things, which ye have spoken, come upon me.


v.
 25. And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.






















SECT. XV.


FRom 
Samaria, Philip
 is warned of an Angel
 in a Vi∣sion, that he should go to 
Gaza,
 but he must not travel the ordinary road; but the other way which was through the desart, and lay through the mountains. In this way he meets with a 
great man
 an 
Eunuch,
 Treasurer of 
Can∣dace
 Queen of the 
Aethiopians
 return∣ing in his Chariot from 
Jerusalem
 where (being as it seems a proselyte) he had been to worship
 at the feast of 
Pentecost. Philip
 by the instinct, and motion of the Spi∣rit joining himself to his Chariot, finds him well imployed
 namely reading the Fifty third Chapter of the Prophet 
Isaiah,
 and being courteously invited by him to come up into his Chariot
 and to in∣terpret that Scripture to him, (which he acknowledges he did not well understand) 
Philip
 accordingly expresses himself ready to serve him therein. The words
 the 
Eunuch
 was reading are the seventh and eighth verses of that Chapter. 
He was led as a sheep
, 
so opened he not his mouth.
 The next clause in the Hebrew Text was this. 
He was taken from prison, and from judg∣ment
, that is, hurried from thence to execution; but the Septuagint (which 
Luke
 follows, and possibly the 
Eunuch
 at this time read) hath inlarged the sense, by change of the phrase, reading it thus, 
In his de∣pression, or humiliation, his judgment was ta∣ken away,
 that is, his 
right
 was taken away, and no right at all done him, and 
Who can sufficiently declare the wickedness of that ge∣neration, which dealt so unjustly with him, as to take and cut him off from the land of the living, who was so innocent a person. Philip
 shews him that the Prophet in this place speaks not of any other person but the 
Messias,
 who was now come into the world, and had done and suffered all that was prophesied of him. And having large∣ly instructed him in the Doctrine of Christ, and (as 'tis proba∣ble) concerning Baptism also, the 
Eunuch
 desired to be baptized, professing his Faith in Christ. Thereupon 
Philip
 immedi∣ately baptized him, which when he had done, he was strait-way transported, and carried out
 of his sight by the Spirit


 of the Lord (which might be an evidence to him, that he was sent to him of God, and was no mercenary person, seeing he staid not to receive any reward) and found himself set down at 
Azotus
 or 
Ashdod,
 one of the five Cities of the 
Philistins
 [See 
Josh.
 15.47.] The 
Eunuch
 went on his way rejoycing at this won∣derful mercy of God in revealing Christ to him, in whom he be∣lieved for the remission of his sins; But 
Philip
 passing through the Country, whither the Spirit had carried him, he prea∣ched the Gospel in all the Cities and Towns thereof, through which he went, till he came to 
Caesarea Stratonis
 
here it seems he stayed a great while. For fourteen years after t
 
ul
 coming with the collections of 
Asia,
 and 
Achaia
 to carry t
 
 o 
Jeru∣salem
 he found 
Philip
 there with his whole Family, 
 lodged with him, See 
Act.
 21.8.


Act.
 8. 
v.
 26. And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the South, unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.


v.
 27. And he arose, and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, an 
unuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who h
d the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship;


v.
 28. Was returning, and sitting in his chariot, read Esaias the prophet.


v.
 29. Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go neer, and joyn thy self to this chariot.


v.
 30. And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?


v.
 31. And he said, How can I except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip, that he would come up, and sit with him.


v.
 32. The place of the Scripture which he read, was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before the shearer, so o∣pened he not his mouth:


33. In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away; and who shall de∣clare his generation? For his life is taken from the earth.


v.
 34 And the Eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, Of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?


v.
 35. Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same Scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.


v.
 36. And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the Eunuch said, See, here is water, what doth hinder me to be bapti∣zed?


v.
 37. And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayst. And he answered, and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.


38. And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the Eunuch, and he baptized him.


v.
 39. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoycing.


v.
 40. But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing thorow, he preached in all the cities, till he came to Cesarea.














CHAP. II.
 Containing the Acts of the 
Apostles,
 from 
Saul
's Conversion to his First Journey with 
Bar∣nabas.




SECT. I.


SAul
 having for some time made havock of the Church, and still breathing out threatnings and slaughter against the Disciples of Christ, went at length to the 
Sanhedrim
 the supream Council at 
Jerusa∣lem,
 wherein the Priests made a great part, and were the most active men, (which C
uncil had the Cognizance, and supream Judgment of all matters appertaining to the 
Jewish
 Religion and that in the Synagogues, which were without
 the land of 
Judaea,
 as well as those within) and obtained of them 
letters of Commission
 to the Synagogues of 
Damascus
, that if he found any there that p
ofest Christ, he should bring them bound to 
Jerusalem,
 that they might be punished. And journeying towards 
Damascus
 to prosecute this cruel design, when he came nigh to the City, at mid∣day, a Light from Heaven above the bright∣ness of the Sun, shone round about him
, and those that journyed with him. When they were all fallen prostrate on the earth, he heard a voice speaking to him
 in the Hebrew tongue, 
Saul▪ Saul, why persecutest thou me? Saul
 trembling, and full of fear, said, 
Lord, Who art thou?
 The Lord said, 
I am Jesus whom thou persecutest; 'Tis hard for thee to kick against the pricks. Saul
 said, Lord what wilt thou have me to do? Je∣sus answered, 
Arise go into the City, and there it shall be told thee what thou must do.
 The m
n, that journeyed with 
Saul
 rising up from the earth were greatly amazed, and stood speechless, having seen indeed a great Light, and heard a sound of words
, but neither saw Christ who spake, (as 
Saul


 did) nor understood 
distinctly
 any thing he spake. 
Saul
 also being risen up, there were Seals
 come over his eyes, so that when he op
ed them, he could see nothing; Christ teaching him by this bodily blindness the blindness of his soul in spiritual things, which he was before insensible of. Being led therefore by the hand into 
Damascus
 he was there 
three days
 without sight, and did neither eat, nor drink
, (men being better able in those hot Countri
s to en∣dure long fasting, than in our colder Climate) and probably he spent a great part of that time in prayer, and humbling his Soul before the Lord for his former sins, and particularly his vio∣lent persecution of the Church of Christ. And in this time, (as some learned
 men think) he had that 
extasie,
 and was rapt up into the third Heaven, where he saw, and heard, what was not lawful for him to utter, 2 
Cor.
 12.2, 3, 4. For from his Con∣version to the writing of that Epistle, fourteen years inter∣curr'd.


Now there was at this time a certain Disciple at 
Damascus,
 named 
Ananias
 to whom the Lord spake in a Vision
, that he should go into the street that is called 
Straight
 and inquire in the house of 
Judas
 for 
Saul,
 telling him that he was then in prayer, and had it revealed to him he should receive his sight. 
Ananias
 is startled at this command, being a∣fraid to go to him, because of his former violent persecution of the Saints, and his present commission and authority from the chief Priests to pursue that bloody design; but Christ tells him, he was a chosen Vessel, one whom he had chosen to conveigh the Divine Treasure of his Gospel, not only to the 
Jews
 but the 
Gentiles
 also, even to the greatest and highest among them, and that he should 
do
 and 
suffer
 great things for his Name sake. 
Ana∣nias
 hereupon went to him, and laying his hands on him, said, Brother 
Saul,
 the Lord Jesus who appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hither, hath sent me to thee, that thou shouldst receive thy sight
; and be filled, and en∣dued with those admirable gifts of the ho∣ly Ghost, which may enable thee in the discharge of that divine Office to which thou art called, and confirm thee in the faith and belief of Jesus. Arise therefore, and be baptized for a Sign and Seal
 that thy sins are washed away in the blood of Christ▪ and by such an open owning and professing of him, declare thy self to be his true Disciple, 
Ananias
 having thus spoken, straitway there fell from 
Sauls
 eyes as it were Scales, and he received his sight, and was baptized, and

 when he had received meat he was strengthened. And then he continued with the Disciples there certain days.


Act.
 9. 
v.
 1. And Saul yet breathing out threatnings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,


v.
 2. And desired of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.


v.
 3. And as he journeyed, he came neer to Damascus, and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven.


v.
 4. And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?


v.
 5. And he said, Who art thou Lord? And the Lord said, I am Je∣sus whom thou persecutest: It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.


v.
 6. And he trembling and astonished, said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.


v.
 7. And the men which journeyed with him, stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.


v.
 8. And Saul arose from the earth, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Da∣mascus,


v.
 9. And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.


v.
 10. And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias, and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.


v.
 11. And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas, for one called Saul of Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth,


v.
 12. And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and put∣ting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.


v.
 13. Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:


v.
 14. And here he hath authority from the chief priests, to bind all that call on thy Name.


v.
 15. But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my Name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel.


v.
 16. For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my Names sake.


v.
 17. And Ananias went his way, and entred into the house, and putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord, (even Jesus that ap∣peared unto thee in the way as thou camest) hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the holy Ghost.


v.
 18. And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales, and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.


v.
 19. And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the Disciples, which were at Damascus.










Act
 22. 
V.
 5. As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of th
 elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to D
m
scus to bring them which were there, bound unto Jeru∣salem, for to be punished.


v.
 6. And it came to pass, that as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto D
m
scus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.


v.
 7. And I f
ll unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, S
ul, why p
rs
cu
est thou m
?


v.
 8. And I 
nswered, Who art thou, Lord? and he said unto me, I am Jesus of N
zar
th whom th
u p
rs
cutest.


v.
 9. And they that w
re with the law indeed the light, and were afraid; but they he
rd not th
 voice of him that spak
 to me.


v.
 10. And I said, Wh
t shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and g
 into D
s
us, and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for th
 to do.


v.
 11. A
d when I co
ld not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of th
m that were with me, I came into Damascus:


v.
 12. And one An
ni
s, a devout man according to the law, having a good r
port of all the J
ws which dwelt there,


v.
 13. Cam
 unto me, and stood, and sa
d unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.


v.
 14. And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldst know h
s will, and see that just One, and shouldst hear the voice of his mouth


v.
 15. For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and h
ard.


v.
 16. And now, why tarriest thou? Arise, and be baptized, and wash a∣way thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.


Act.
 26. 
v.
 12. Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and com∣mission from the chi
f pri
sts,


v.
 13. At mid-day, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me, and them which journeyed with me.


v.
 14. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, S
ul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.


v.
 15. And I said, Who art thou Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.


v.
 16. But arise, and stand up upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witn
ss, both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee.




v.
 17. Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I now send thee,


v.
 18. To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.






SECT. II.


THe Lord now reveales to 
Saul
 what he would have him do; and among other things, he was taught that he should not confer with flesh and blood, nor debate the matter, either with himself or others, (who might cause him to question the reality of his Call, or discourage him from yielding obedience to it, by representing dangers to him); nor go to 
Jerusalem
 to those that were Apostles before him (to consult with them and be in∣structed by them, or to obtain a permission or commission from them to discharge his Office, he being so extraordinarily, and im∣mediately called, and instructed by Christ himself) but that he should go for some time into 
Arabia,
 and the places near 
Da∣mascus.
 Being now therefore well instructed in the Doctrine of the Gospel, he begins straitway to preach 
Christ
 in the Sy∣nagogues of the 
Jews
 in that City, and to declare to them, and convince them by plain demonstrations, that he is the 
true Messias,
 and the Son of God; the praedi∣ctions of the Prophets, concerning the 
Messias
 being exactly fulfilled in his person. They that heard him were amazed at this thing, knowing what he had done at 
Jerusalem,
 and with what intent he came up to 
Damascus.
 When he had for some time preached Christ here, he went into 
Arabia,
 where for the space of about three years he preached the Gospel, and then return∣ing to 
Damascus
 again, and strenuously preaching the Doctrine of Christ in that City, the 
Jews
 being enraged at him consul∣ted to kill him, and being encouraged by the Governours un∣der 
Aretas
 King of 
Arabia,
 (who kept the City with a Garri∣son) they watched the gates day and night, that they might take him, and put him to death; but he being let down by the Disciples in a Basket
 over the Wall in the night, escaped their hands.


Gal.
 1. 
v.
 11. But I certifie you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me, is not after man.


v.
 12. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.


v.
 13. For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews re∣ligion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:


v.
 14. And profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.




v.
 15. But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mothers womb, and called me by his grace,


v.
 16. To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the hea∣then, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.


v.
 17. Neither went I up to Jerusalem, to them which were Apostles be∣fore me, but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.


Act.
 9. 
v.
 20. And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.


v.
 21. But all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this Name in Jerusalem, and came hi∣ther for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?


v.
 22. But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.


v.
 23. And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him.


v.
 24. But their laying await was known of Saul, and they watched the gat
s day and night to kill him.


v.
 25. Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a bask
.


Act.
 26. 
v.
 19. Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.


v.
 20. But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and Jerusalem, and tho∣rowout all the coasts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.


2 
Cor.
 11. 
v.
 32. In Damascus the governour under Aretas the king, kept the city with a garison, desirous to apprehend me:


v.
 33. And thorow a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.






SECT. III.


SAƲL
 escaping in this manner at 
Damascus,
 he goes from thence to 
Jerusalem,
 to visit 
Peter
, and the other Apostles, in the fourth year after his Conversion; but essay∣ing to join himself to the Disciples there, they were all afraid of him, not believing him to be a true Disciple, and sincere Con∣vert, till 
Barnabas
 bringing him to 
Peter,
 and 
James
 the Kinsman of Christ (for of the rest of the Apostles he saw none, they being as it seems at this time gone abroad to pro∣pagate

 the Gospel) declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, who had spoken to him from heaven, and that he had boldly preached in the name of Christ at 
Damascus
 with the hazard of his life, and so he was set right in their opinion, and con∣versed familiarly with them. Whilst he is here, he preaches Christ undauntedly, and disputes with the 
Hellenists
, (or 
Jews
 that cohabiting among the 
Greek
 Nations, used the 
Greek
 Tongue, and the 
Septuagints
 Tran∣slation of the Old Testament) proving to them that Jesus was the true 
Messias,
 who were so enraged at him, that they went about to kill him. But being in the Tem∣ple in prayer, he fell into a trance, wherein he saw Christ, who bad him make haste out of 
Jerusalem,
 for there they would not receive his Testimony. Against this, he humbly argued with the Lord, alledging, That his former zeal against Christ, and his Doctrine having been so remarkable, and notorious a∣mong the Jews in this place, it might be an argument to them, that so strange a change as this was not wrought in him but up∣on great and sufficient grounds and reasons, and so he might in all likelyhood be a more fit instrument to propagate the Gospel here, by how much the more he had opposed it formerly. But this did not prevail for staying at 
Jerusalem,
 but Christ commands him to depart from thence, telling him, he would send him to preach to the 
Gentiles. Saul
 hereupon readily obeys, and forth∣with departs from thence having stayed there only Fifteen days; several brethren that dwelt at 
Jerusalem
 accompanying him as far as 
Caesarea,
 from whence he sailed to 
Tarsus
 his own City, the Metropolis of 
Cilicia;
 and from thence was shortly after fetch∣ed by 
Barnabas
 unto 
Antioch,
 the Metropolis of 
Syria;
 being all this while not so much as known by face to the Churches of 
Judeae,
 which had embraced the Faith; only they had heard of his preaching the Doctrine of Christ, which before he had per∣secuted, and they glorified God for his Grace so powerfully ma∣nifested in him.


Act.
 9. 
v.
 26. And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to joyn himself to the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.


v.
 27. But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the Apostles, and declared unto them, how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the Name of Jesus.


v.
 28. And he was with them coming in, and going out at Jerusalem.


v.
 29. And he spake boldly in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.


v.
 30. Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Ce∣sarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.




Gal.
 1. 
v.
 18. Then after three years I went to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.


v.
 19. But other of the Apostles saw I none, save James the Lords bro∣ther.


v.
 20. Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God I lie not.


v.
 21. Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia,


v.
 22. And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea, which were in Christ.


v.
 23. But they had heard only, that he which persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith, which once he destroyed.


v.
 24. And they glorified God in me.


Act.
 22. 
v.
 17. And it came to pass, that when I was come again to Jerusa∣lem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance,


v.
 18. And saw him saying unto me, Make haste and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me,


v.
 19. And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every sy∣nagogue them that believed on thee.


v.
 20. And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was stan∣ding by and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.


v.
 21. And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.






SECT. IV.


NOw after 
Sauls
 miraculous Conversion, the Churches which were planted by 
Philip,
 and others (who fled from 
Jeru∣salem
 upon the persecution raised by him, 
Act.
 8.1.) through all 
Judea, Samaria,
 and 
Galilee,
 had 
much rest
 and 
peace,
 and were greatly edifyed, and built up in Knowledg, Faith and Love, the Graces and Comforts of the Spirit daily increasing in them, and the number of believers was daily augmented. In this time 
Peter
 went forth to visit the Churches newly plan∣ted in those parts, and to confirm them in the Faith. Who com∣ing at last, to the Saints which dwelt at 
Lydda,
 he there in the Name, and by the Power of Christ heals 
Aeneas,
 who lay sick of the Palsey, and had kept his bed Eight years. Upon this Miracle the inhabitants of 
Lydda
 and 
Saron
 generally received the Faith, seeing this man to be so strangely, suddenly, and per∣fectly cured. From thence he goes to 
Joppa,
 where he finds a very good woman full of good works (whose name in 
Syriac
 was 
Tabitha,
 but in 
Greek Dorcas,
 signifying a 
Roe
) newly dead
 whom they had washed
, and laid out according to the mannner of the Ancients, who as some think did thereby intend to signifie their hope of a Resurrection. 
Peter
 being brought up into the Chamber where

 she lay, the poor Widdows, which had been cloathed by her liberality came weeping to him, and shewed him the evidence
 of her Charity, the 
Coats
 and 
Garments
 which she made, or caused to be made for them. Upon this 
Peter
 putting them all forth knee∣led down, and prayed, and then raised her to life
 again
. And by these miracles very many in those Quarters were brought to believe in Jesus.


Act.
 9. 
v.
 31. Then had the churches rest thorowout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, and were edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the holy Ghost, were multiplied.


v.
 32. And it came to pass, as Peter passed thorowout all quarters, he came down also to the Saints which dwelt at Lydda.


v.
 33. And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsie.


v.
 34. And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.


v.
 35. And all that dwelt at Lydda, and Saron, saw him, and turned to the Lord.


v.
 36. Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: This woman was full of good works, and alms-deeds which she did.


v.
 37. And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper Chamber.


v.
 38. And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.


v.
 39. Then Peter arose and went with them: when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber. And all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.


v.
 40. But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed, and turning him to the body, said, Tabitha, Arise. And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.


v.
 41. And he gave her his hand, and lift her up: and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.


v.
 42. And it was known thorowout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.


v.
 43. And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa, with one Simon a tanner.








SECT. V.


DUring 
Peter
's stay at 
Joppa, Cornelius
 a 
Roman
, and Captain of a Band of 
Italian
 Souldiers, who with others kept Garrison for the 
Romans
 at 
Caesarea
 (being a very pious and religious
 per∣son, and one that worshipped the true God, with all his Family, and was very charita∣ble to the poor, 
though only a Proselyte of the Gate
 (as they called them), 
and un∣circumcised
) had in that City, as he was Fasting and Praying, about three of the Clock in the afternoon
 a Vision of an holy Angel, (not in an extasie or rapture of Spirit, or in a dream, but waking, 
ocu∣larly
 and 
sensibly
) who appearing
 to him, told him, that his prayers and alms
 had found acceptance with God. And the Lord designing to manifest his Grace now in a more especial manner unto him, com∣manded him to send to 
Joppa,
 to inquire for one 
Simon Peter,
 who should come un∣to him and further instruct him
 con∣cerning the Mind and Will of God toward him. 
Cornelius
 immediately yeilds obedi∣ence hereunto, and accordingly sends two of his Domestick Servants, and a devout Souldier that constantly attended him, to 
Peter
 who was now at 
Joppa. Peter
 about the time that 
Cornelius
 his messengers drew near the City, knowing nothing of their coming, went up of his own accord, about noon to the Battlements of the house as a place of privacy to pray in; and be∣ing there he became very hungry and desi∣red to eat: but whilst they made ready, he fell into a trance, such as in which men were wont to receive Visions from Heaven. And in a Vision of his Spirit
 (without the help of his outward Senses) he saw a 
great sheet
, full of all sorts of living crea∣tures, 
clean
 and 
unclean,
 let down unto him from Heaven, and a voice spake to him, that he should eat 
freely
 and 
indifferently
 of any of them: which he doubting to do, the Voice spake again to him, saying, 
What God hath cleansed call not thou common.
 By which Vision he is taught that he should not

 despise the 
Gentiles
 nor account them un∣clean, but converse with them and preach freely unto them as well as to the 
Jews;
 and hereby also was intimated that God had taken away those 
interdicts
 and prohi∣bitions concerning some 
meats,
 and conse∣quently those differences and separations between 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles
 signified by them, and therefore he was not to make a di∣stinction where God now made none. Whilst 
Peter
 thought on these things, 
Cornelius
's messengers were come to the house where he was, and asking for 
Peter
 delivered their M
ss
ge unto him: The Apostle the next d
 very readily went along with them, (b
ing incouraged thereto by an inward rev
la
ion or affla
ion of the Spirit
) and some other believing 
Jews
 also accom∣panied him to 
Caesarea.
 When he was come thither, 
Cornelius
 being stricken with an extraordinary reverence at the presence of so great a S
rvant of God, and exceeding the bounds of meer civil respect, fell down at his feet and worshipped him. But 
Peter
 would by no means receive that honour from him, but told him that he was an ordi∣nary man, such an one as himself; though thus employ'd at present in Gods message unto him. Then entring into the house he found many of 
Cornelius
's Kinsmen and Friends there met together; to whom ad∣dressing himself, he spake after this man∣ner, 
Ye all know that its counted unlawful
 
for us Jews to converse familiarly with you Gentiles, but God hath now by a Vision from Heaven, and the inspiration of his Spi∣rit, shewed me that I should not make any difference between Jews and Gentiles.
 For I perceive
 that the Partition wall is now broken down, and that national Preroga∣tives or personal excellencies find no accep∣tance with God, but any man of any Na∣tion whatsoever, if 
he fear God and work righteousness, is accepted with him.
 Hear ye therefore the Doctrine
 which God appointed his Prophets of old to publish to the Children of Israel, to wit, that of 
reconciliation and peace between God and man by Christ Jesus,
 (who is Lord of all). Which Doctrine, was first published in 
Ga∣lilee,


 presently after 
John Baptist
 began to preach and baptize, which you cannot but have heard of, and how God indued the humane nature of Christ with the fulness of the graces of his Holy Spirit and with power to work Miracles, and anointed and consecrated his whole person to the the office of the 
Mediator,
 which he ac∣cordingly executed with much tenderness and compassion, going about 
doing good, curing diseases and casting out Devils,
 for God was with him in the 
fulness of the Deity,
 as he was his eternal Son [
Col.
 2.9.] and in 
power, grace,
 and 
favour,
 as he was 
man
 and 
Mediator [Joh.
 8.29. & 16.32.] And though the 
Jews
 put him to death and cru∣cified him, yet God raised him up the third day and manifested him openly, not to all the 
Jews,
 but to his Apostles and Disciples that attended on him, who were chosen for this end that they might testifie what Di∣vine Doctrine he preached and what Mi∣racles he wrought, and might be witnesses particularly of his 
resurrection,
 having had the honour to eat and drink with him and to see him eat and drink after he rose from the dead. To these he gave command that they should preach his Gospel to the world, and should testifie that he is appointed of God, to be Judg of all men, even of all that shall dye before, or shall be found a∣live at his Coming. And he further shews them, That this Jesus is 
he
 whom all the Prophets foretold as the sole Author of Reconciliation with God, and Remission of sins 
through faith
 in him.




Whilst 
Peter
 was thus preaching to 
Cornelius
's family and those other persons there present, they were by the powerful work of the Spirit of God converted to Christ, and the holy Ghost by his wonderful Graces and Gifts, 
viz.
 of Illuminati∣on, Regeneration and the gift of Tongues descended on them all, of his own accord, without any laying on of hands by 
Pe∣ter,
 to the great wonder and astonishment of the believing 
Jews,
 that had accompanied the Apostle thither, who thought this Promise, of sending down the holy Ghost, belonged only to the House of 
Israel.
 Then 
Peter
 seeing what was done, and how these 
Gentiles
 had been baptized with the holy Ghost, concluded that they ought to be baptized with Water, and re∣ceive the external sign or seal of incorporation into Christs Bo∣dy, the Church; therefore commanding all things to be made ready, either He baptized them himself, or gave order that some of those who accompanied him (who probably were Mi∣nisters and Teachers), should do it. This done, they desi∣red him to stay some days with them, that they might be fur∣ther instructed confirmed and comforted by his Ministry.


Act.
 10. 
v.
 1. There was a certain man in Cesarea, called Cornelius, a cen∣turion of the band, called the Italian band,


v.
 2. A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.


v.
 3. He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day, an an∣gel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.


v.
 4. And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.


v.
 5. And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose sirname is Peter.


v.
 6. He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner whose house is by the sea-side; he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.


v.
 7. And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius, was departed, he called two of his houshold servants, and a devout souldier of them that waited on him continually.


v.
 8. And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.


v.
 9. On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the house to pray, about the sixth hour.


v.
 10. And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,


v.
 11: And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet, knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:


v.
 12. Wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.


v.
 13. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter: kill and eat.


v.
 14. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.


v.
 15. And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed that call not thou common.




v.
 16. This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.


v.
 17. Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen, should mean: behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius, had made enquiry for Simons house, and stood before the gate,


v.
 18. And called, and asked whether Simon which was sirnamed Peter, were lodged there.


v.
 19. While Peter thought on the vision, the spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.


v.
 20. Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.


v.
 21. Then Peter went down to the men, which were sent unto him from Cornelius, and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?


v.
 22. And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel, to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.


v.
 23. Then called he them in, and lodged them: And on the morrow Pe∣ter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompa∣nied him.


v.
 24. And the morrow after they entred into Cesarea: and Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.


v.
 25. And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.


v.
 26. But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up, I my self also am a man.


v.
 27. And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.


v.
 28. And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation: but God hath shewed me, that I should not call any man com∣mon or unclean.


v.
 29. Therefore came I unto you without gain-saying, assoon as I was sent for. I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?


v.
 30. And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was falling until this hour, and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold a man stood before me in bright clothing,


v.
 31. And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.


v.
 32. Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose sirname is Pe∣ter: he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner, by the sea-side, who when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.


v.
 33. Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou hast well done, that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.


v.
 34. Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons.


v.
 35. But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.


v.
 36. The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, (he is Lord of all).


v.
 37. That word (I say) you know which was published thorowout all Judea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached:


v.
 38. How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the holy Ghost, and with pow
r, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: for God was with him.




v.
 39. And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem, whom they slew and hanged on a tree:


v.
 40. Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly.


v.
 41. Not to all the people, but unto witnesses, chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.


v.
 42. And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testifie that it is he which was ordained of God to be the judg of quick and dead.


v.
 45. To him give all the prophets witness, that through his Name who∣soever believeth in him, shall receive remission of sins.


v.
 44. While Peter yet spake these words, the holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.


v.
 45. And they of the circumcision which believed, were astonished, as many as came with Peter; because that on the Gentiles also was pow∣red out the gift of the holy Ghost.


v.
 46. For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnifie God. Then answered Peter,


v.
 47. Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the holy Ghost as well as we?


v.
 48. And he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.




































SECT. VI.


THe Apostles and Brethren that were in 
Judea,
 namely Those that had been converted out of 
Judaism
 to Christ hearing of this, when 
Peter
 came shortly after to 
Jerusalem,
 began to quarrel with him, that he had conversed with 
Ʋn∣circumcised
 persons, and eaten with them. But when he had declared unto them the whole matter (which he confirmed by the Testimony of those six persons that accompanied him to 
Caesarea
), they were satisfied, and glorified God, who also has given unto the Gentiles 
repentance unto life,
 graciously chan∣ging their hearts, and drawing them to believe in Christ.


Act.
 11. 
v.
 1. And the Apostles, and brethren that were in Judea, heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.


v.
 2. And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,


v.
 3. Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.


v.
 4. But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,


v.
 5. I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from hea∣ven by four corners, and it came even to me.


v.
 6. Upon the which when I had fastn
d mine eyes, I considered, and saw four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.


v.
 7. And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise Peter, slay and eat.


v.
 8. But I said, Not so, Lord, for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entred into my mouth.




v.
 9. But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath clean∣sed, that call not thou common.


v.
 10. And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.


v.
 11. And behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Cesarea unto me.


v.
 12. And the spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. More∣over these six brethren accompanied me; and we entred into the mans house:


v.
 13. And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose sirname is Peter:


v.
 14. Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.


v.
 15. And as I began to speak, the holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.


v.
 16. Then remembred I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the holy Ghost.


v.
 17. Forasmuch then as God give them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ: what was I that I could with∣stand God?


v.
 18. When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.






SECT. VII.


A Door being thus opened for the promulgation of the Gospel to the Gentiles, some Disciples born in 
Cyprus
 and 
Cyrene,
 who after the martyrdom of 
Stephen
 were disper∣sed and went about publishing the Gospel, but hitherto to the Jews only; now understanding (as it seems) what had passed between 
Peter
 and 
Cornelius
 and the liberty granted unto them, began to preach Christ to the Greeks
 at 
Antioch
 in 
Syria,
 who were Gentiles. And God prospered their endeavours exceeding∣ly and brought in many Converts
 to them daily. The Apostles that remained at 
Jerusalem
 hearing of it, sent 
Barnabas
 to con∣firm those Disciples there in the Faith, (See 
Sect.
 13. of 
ch.
 1.) who coming and seeing with what good success, the Gospel had been preached among them was exceeding glad and exhorted them stedfastly to hold fast to Christ. For he was a very pious person, a man of excellent gifts and graces, and by his means also many others were won to the Faith of Christ. And having great a desire that the Gospel might still be more and more propagated, he went to 
Tar∣sus
 to seek out 
Saul,
 (knowing as 'tis probable, that he was de∣signed for minister to the Uncircumcision) that they might joyn together in the work of Christ. And having found him he brought

 him with him to 
Antioch,
 where for a whole year they instructed the Church in that City, and taught much people. And the Dis∣ciples (
viz.
 such as had received the Faith of Christ, being formerly called by the Jews, 
Nazarites
 or 
Galilaeans;
 but a∣mong themselves, 
Disciples, Believers, Saints, Brethren,
 and 
those of the Church
), did now first in this place obtain the name of 
Christians.


Act.
 11. 
v.
 19. Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecu∣tion that arose about Stephen, travelled as far as Phenice, and Cy∣prus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none, but unto the Jews only.


v.
 20. And some of them were men of Cyprus, and Cyrene, which when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.


v.
 21. And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number be∣lieved, and turned unto the Lord.


v.
 22. Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church, which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.


v.
 23. Who when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.


v.
 24. For he was a good man, and full of the holy Ghost, and of faith, and much people was added unto the Lord.


v.
 25. Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul.


v.
 26. And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people, and the disciples were called Christi∣ans first in Antioch.














SECT. VIII.


ABout this time certain persons who had the gift of Pro∣phesie, and foretelling future things; came from 
Jeru∣salem
 to 
Antioch;
 one of whom (by name
 
Agabus
) by revelation from the Spirit of God, foretold that there would shortly be a great famine
 over all 
Judea,
 and several other parts of the world,
 which according∣ly came to pass in the reign of the Emperor 
Claudius;
 The Christians therefore of 
Antioch,
 resolved to send relief to their Brethren the Christians in 
Judea,
 in this time of dearth
; and having gathered it, sent it to the Elders
 of those Churches
 by the hands of 
Barnabas
 and 
Saul;
 who having performed this their charge, returned again to 
Antioch
 taking with them 
John
 whose sirname was 
Mark,
 Nephew to
 
Barnabas.


Act.
 11. 
v.
 27. And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto An∣tioch.


v.
 28. And there stood up one of them, named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit, that there should be great dearth thorowout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Cesar.


v.
 29 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judea.


v.
 30. Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Bar∣nabas and Saul.


Act.
 12. 
v.
 25. And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose sirname was Mark.

 great part of his Grandfathers Dominions of 
Claudius
 the Em∣peror, came into 
Judea,
 to take upon him his Government, about the latter end of the first, or beginning of the second year of 
Claudius;
 and being willing to gratifie the 
Jews,
 (who he saw desperately hated the Christians), he began to vex and persecute certain of the Church at 
Jerusalem;
 and in that per∣secution he slew 
James
 Brother of 
John,
 and Son of 
Zebedee
 with the Sword
, who was called 
Boanerges (Mark
 3.16.) because he was a zealous and thundering Preacher against the Vices of the Times. And per∣ceiving that the 
Jews
 were well pleased there∣with, He proceeded further and apprehen∣ded 
Peter
 also, the 
Passeover
 of the 
Jews
 be∣ing then at hand. And having imprisoned him, he set sixteen
 Souldiers to guard him, 
four
 at a time, and to take their turns in the 
four watches
 of the night, meaning after the Feast of the 
Passeover
 was over to bring him forth to the 
Jews,
 and probably (if they desired it) to put him to death also.


Peter
 being thus cast into prison, fervent and importunate prayers were made by the Church to God in his behalf. He continues there till the very night
 before 
Herod
 intended to bring him out to the peo∣ple; at which time sleeping between two Souldiers to whom he was bound with two Chaines, and the Souldiers keeping watch before the door, an Angel came to him, and the light with which he appeared shone in the prison, who rai∣sing him up and causing his Chaines to fall off from his hands, He commands him to make himself ready to go out immediate∣ly with him; which accordingly he does, but as yet was not assur'd that this was really done, but in this transport, appre∣hended he had been in a dream or trance. And the prison, as it seems, being in the Suburbs, after they were out of prison, they past thorow two watches, or wards which stood every night without the gates of the City, and at last came to the 
Irongate,
 which leads into the City, which opened to them of its own ac∣cord, and when they had passed together thorow one street, the Angel left him, and departed. 
Peter
 now perceiving that it it was no vision, but a real deliverance, said within himself, Now I see clearly that God hath sent his holy Angel and hath deli∣vered me from the hands of 
Herod
 and from the malice of the 
Jews.
 And when he had considered what course was fittest for him to take, he resolved to go to the house of 
Mary, Mark's


 mother, where many Christians were met together at this very time of the night to seek the Lord in prayer for him: And as he knocked at the door, a Damosel came to ask 
Who was there?
 and knowing 
Peters
 voice, she stayed not to open the door for gladness, but ran in and told them 
Peter was there.
 They at first thought she spake idly, but she persisting in it, they then said, 
It is his
 
Angel;
 that is, some Messen∣ger come from him, who mentioning his name, the Maid by mistake, concludes it to be 
Pe∣ter
 himself; or else possibly by 
his Angel
 they might mean that some holy Angel
, had assumed his shape and voice, and stood at the gate in his resemblance. But whilst they thus debated the matter, 
Peter
 continued knocking, and when they had opened the door, they were amaz'd to find that it was indeed 
Peter
 himself. Then he related to them how miraculously the Lord had deli∣vered him, and giving order, that 
James
 the less (the Son of 
Alpheus,
 called the 
bro∣ther,
 that is, the 
kinsman
 of the Lord, 
Gal.
 1.19.) and the rest of the Brethren in that City should be certifi'd of the manner of his deliverance; he withdrew himself to some more secure place, (probably to 
An∣tioch
) not being willing to put himself in∣to the same danger again, out of which God had so wonderfully delivered him, [See 
Mat.
 10.23.]


In the morning there was a great stir among the Souldiers, what was become of 
Peter.
 And 
Herod
 not finding him, strict∣ly examined the Watch, and being frustrated of his intention against the Apostle, he vents his rage against the Souldiers, and commanded they should be carried away
 either to prison or to execution, and to be punished as malefactors.


Act.
 12.1. Now about that time, Herod the king stretched forth his hands, to vex certain of the church.


v.
 2. And h
 killed James the brother of John with the sword.


v.
 3. And b
cause he saw it pleas
d the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread)


v.
 4. And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and de∣livered him to four quarternions of souldiers to keep him, intending af∣ter Easter to bring him forth to the people.


v.
 5. Peter therefore was kept in prison, but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.




v.
 6. And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Pe∣ter was sleeping between two souldiers, bound with two chaines, and the keepers before the door kept the prison.


v.
 7. And behold, the 
ngel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shi∣ned in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.


v.
 8. And the angel said unto him, Gird thy self, and bind on thy sandals, And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garments about thee, and follow me.


v.
 9. And he went out, and followed him, and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel: but thought he saw a vision.


v.
 10. When they were past the first and the second ward, they came un∣to the iron gate that leadeth into the city, which opened to them of his own accord, and they went out, and passed on thorow one street, and forthwith the angel departed from him.


v.
 11. And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.


v.
 12. And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose sirname was Mark, where many were gathered together, praying.


v.
 13. And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.


v.
 14. And when she knew Peters voice, she opened not the gate for glad∣ness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.


v.
 15. And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.


v.
 16. But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.


v.
 17. But he beckning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, de∣clared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison: and he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.


v.
 18. Now assoon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soul∣diers, what was become of Peter.


v.
 19. And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he exa∣mined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death.








SECT. X.


HErod
 shortly atfer goes from 
Jerusalem
 to 
Caesarea
 and abode there: And being highly displeased with the 
Ty∣rians
 and 
Sidonians
 he intended to make war
 upon them. They being sensible, that their own narrow circuit of Land was not sufficient to maintain them, and that they depended on 
Galilee
 and 
Judea,
 (now under 
Herods
 jurisdiction) for a great part of their provisions, they judged it their wisest course to seek peace with him. Having therefore gratifi'd 
Blastus
 his Chamberlain, and got him to be their Friend, they sent their Commissioners to request the King that he would be graciously pleased to be reconciled to them. 
Herod
 being a proud Prince

 and pufft up with his prosperity, on a solemn, day appointed (as 'tis like) for the audience of these 
Tyrian
 and 
Sidonian
 Commissioners, being clad in a 
Royal Robe
 all glistering with Silver (whereon the Sun shone, and so made it more glorious and illustrious, as 
Josephus
 reports, 
lib.
 19. 
Antiq. ch.
 7.), and sitting upon his Throne, made a speech unto them to shew his magnificence and eloquence, and possibly extoll'd his own cle∣mency, that having a just cause to chastize them with his arms, yet he was graciously inclin'd to spare them. At this the peo∣ple gave a shout and with impious flattery, cry'd out, 
It is the voice of a God and not of a man. Herod
 priding himself in this acclamation and assuming this divine honour to himself, imme∣diately the
 Angel of the Lord smote him with a loathsom disease, so that he was eaten up either of 
lice
 or 
worms,
 and dyed misera∣bly. And this Tyrant and Persecutor of the Church being thus removed, the Gospel prospered exceeding∣ly, and was preached up and down with great success.


—And he went down from Judea to Cesarea, and there abode.


v.
 20. And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and having made Blastus the kings chamberlain their friend, desired peace, because their country was nourished by the kings countrey.


v.
 21. And upon a set day Herod arayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them.


v.
 22. And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.


v.
 23. And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory, and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.


v.
 24. But the word of God grew, and multiplied.










CHAP. III.
 Relating 
Saul
's first journey from 
Antioch
 with 
Barnabas,
 to preach the 
Gospel
 to the 
Gen∣tiles, John Mark
 being their Minister, which for distinctions sake we call, 
Iter Asiaticum.




SECT. I.


BArnabas
 and 
Saul
 having carried the Alms sent from the Disciples in 
Antioch
 to their Brethren in 
Judaea
 in the time of the dearth (as we have seen 
Sect.
 8. of 
Chap.
 2.), returned to the Church at 
Antioch
 again; in which there were at that time se∣veral 
Prophets
 and 
Teachers,
 and among others one very eminent, 
viz. Manaen,
 who was a person of that high rank and quality, that he had been brought up with 
Herod An∣tipas,
 and yet contemning the world, had em∣braced the Gospel, and thought it no dis∣paragement to him to be a Teacher there. Thus God manifests the freedom of his Grace, in effectually calling some of all sorts and ranks of men to a participation of the bene∣fits offerr'd 
in
 and 
by
 his Son.


Barnabas
 and 
Saul
 had not been long in that City, before the holy Ghost on a day when the Church fasting and praying, by some instinct or revelation to one or more of the 
Prophets
 and 
Teachers
 there, commanded that these two, 
viz. Barnabas
 and 
Saul
 should be separated
 from the service of that Church (where there were for the present Teachers enough) and sent to preach the Gospel in other parts. The Church here∣upon with 
prayer
 and 
fasting
 commended them to God, and by 
imposition of hands
 set them apart to this particular employment. Thus having recei∣ved their Commission from the holy Ghost, they set forth for the work to which they were designed
, taking 
John Mark
 along with them, to be assistant to them, and a fellow-labourer in the work of the Lord, and to be by them sent to any part of their charge, whither they themselves could not go. Having begun their journey, they first

 came to 
Seleucia
 a port in 
Syria
 and from thence sailed to 
Cyprus
, 
Barnabas
's own Country [
Act.
 4.36.], and at 
Salamis
 one of the Cities of that Island, they 
first began to preach
 the Gospel in the Synagogues of the 
Jews.
 For though these two holy men were sent to the 
Gentiles,
 yet were they so far from forbearing to preach to the 
Jews,
 that they constantly began with 
them
 first in all places where they came. And travelling over that Island as far as 
Paphos,
 they there found a false Prophet a magical 
Jew
 [See 
Act.
 19.13. & 
Mat.
 24.24.], called 
Bar-jesus
, and sirnamed 
Elymas
 or 
Magus,
 who opposed them, and particularly endeavoured to hinder and di∣vert 
Sergius Paulus
 (who govern'd that Island for the 
Romans
) from hearing them and from embracing the faith. 
Saul
 seeing the wick∣edness and malice of this man and having a great incitation of the Spirit of God upon him, looked earnestly on him, and spake to him to this purpose, 
O thou vile sorcerer, who like the Devil by whom thou workest, shewest thy self and an enemy to the truth and to all goodness; wilt thou not cease to lay false imputations on the gospel, and the way of salvation to hinder and discourage men from embracing of it? It is most just that thou that shuttest the eyes of thy mind so perversly against the light of the Gospel, shouldst lose thy outward sight; and therefore by the immediate power of God it shall be taken from thee for some time;
 and immediately 
Elymas
 was struck blind and was not able to go without leading. The 
Governour
 seeing this miracle, and hearing the Doctrine of the Gospel opened and explained, and perceiving it accompanied with so much power, was converted to the Faith. And from this time forward 
Saul
 was always called 
Paul
, which name possibly was first given him by the houshold of 
Sergius Paulus.
 So that though he was called 
Saul,
 so long as he con∣vers'd among the 
Jews, Syrians
 and 
Arabians,
 yet afterwards, when he was by Gods special Call principally sent to the 
Gen∣tiles, viz.
 to the 
Greeks
 and 
Romans,
 he then had the name of 
Paul
 given unto him, that being a name more agreeable unto them. From 
Paphos, Paul
 and his company went to 
Perga
 in 
Pamphilia,
 a Country in 
Asia
 the less, at which place 
John Mark
 (possibly being weary of those travels or having and earnest desire to visit his mo∣ther and friends) left them (which 
Paul
 took very ill) and returned to 
Jerusalem,
 where he stayed till 
Paul
 and 
Barnabas
 came thither again: in whose place (it seems) 
Paul
 took 
Titus,
 for he was with him, when after he had finished this peregrination, he went up to the Council at 
Jerusalem.




Act.
 13.1. Now there wee in the church that was at Antioch, certain prophets and teachers: as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen which had been brought up with He∣rod the tetrarch, and Saul.


v.
 2. As they ministred to the Lord and fasted, the holy Ghost said, Sepa∣rate me Barnabas and Saul, for the work whereunto I have called them.


v.
 3. And when they had fasted, and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.


v.
 4. So they being sent forth by the holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia, and from thence they sailed unto Cyprus.


v.
 5. And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the Synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their Mi∣nister.


v.
 6. And when they had gone thorow the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus.


v.
 7. Which was with the deputy of the countrey Sergius Paulus, a pru∣dent man: who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.


v.
 8. But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) with∣stood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.


v.
 9. Then Saul (who also is called Paul) filled with the holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,


v.
 10. And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?


v.
 11. And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness, and he went about, seeking some to lead him by the hand.


v.
 12. Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.


v.
 13. Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphilia: and John departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.












SECT. II.


PAul
 and 
Barnabas
 from 
Perga
 go to 
Antioch
 in 
Pisidia
 (a Country of the lesser 
Asia
) and entring into one of the Synagogues of the 
Jews
 on the Sabbath day, after the rea∣ding of some portions or sections in the Law and Prophets
 (as their manner was every Sabbath, See 
v.
 17. & 
ch.
 15.21.) they are invited by the 
Rulers
 
of the Synagogue
 to give a word of instruction
 unto them if they were pre∣pared so to do. Hereupon 
Paul
 standing up, and bespeaking all both 
Jews
 and 
Proselytes
 to give audience, in a most excellent Sermon he setteth forth the mercies of God to the Children of Israel, in chusing them at first for his own peculiar people and exalting them thereby above all the Nations of the World, and delivering them by his Almighty power from the bondage of 
Egypt,
 exercising longsuffe∣ring, and forbearance towards them, notwithstanding their pro∣vocations Forty years in the wilderness, and driving out the 
sea∣ven nations
 out of the Land of 
Canaan,
 and giving it to them for a possession. And after his providence had been thus over them for about the space of Four hundred and fifty years; He gave them 
Judges
 and spirited them for their places, and raised up some particular eminent persons to rule over them, and to fight their battles: which way of Government lasted to the time of 
Sa∣muel,
 who being a Prophet, ruled them in Gods name, and stood for some years. After this, they desired a King, and God gave them 
Saul,
 whose reign, (reckoning in also the precee∣ding government of 
Samuel
), continued for the space of Forty years
; and after him, he gave them 
Da∣vid
 a man after his own heart and ready to perform
 what he enjoyn'd him in gover∣ning the people. Of this mans seed he shews, God according to his promise [
Isa.
 11.1.] had raised up to Israel, 
Jesus
 a Saviour. To whom 
John Baptist
 bare witness, preaching the Doctrine of Repentance and pressing con∣trition, humiliation, and brokenness of heart for sin, that so there might be stirr'd up in the people a hunger, and thirst, and earnest de∣sire after Christ, who was then ready to ap∣pear, and to enter on his prophetick office. He shewed that 
John
 did not only exhort to repentance in his Sermons, but by administring the ordinance of 
Baptism
 he obliged them to it, and to an humble acknowledgment and confession of their sinfulness and impurity, which 
washing with water
 might suggest unto

 them. And as 
John
 went on fulfulling his ministry, he was so far from arrogating to himself the Title of the Messias, that he avowed himself only for his 
forerunner,
 declaring, that shortly the Messias would come in person and preach among them, which accordingly he did. Now this Gospel and Word of Salvati∣on, which Christ brought into the World (he shews) is sent, and is to be proclaimed and made known unto them. He ac∣knowledges the 
Sanhedrim,
 and people that then dwelt at 
Jeru∣salem,
 did not indeed understand him to be the 
Messias
 as they might have done, had they considered the Predictions of the Prophets, contained in those Sections and Portions of Scripture which every Sabbath-day are read in their Synagogues; but in∣stead thereof, they adjudged him to death, and in so doing, fulfilled those very prophesies they understood not. And though they found not in him any cause of death, yet they desired 
Pi∣late,
 that he might be slain. But after he was crucifi'd and bu∣ried, he shews them, that God raised him from the dead, and for Forty days he continued upon the earth, and was several times seen by his disciples and divers others who from the be∣ginning attended on him, who do now with great assurance testifie these things unto all the Jews. He further shews, that now God had actually fulfilled his promises made unto their fathers, in that he had sent 
his son
 into the world to be incarnate, and to accomplish the work of our redemption, whom he had rai∣sed from the dead, after he had been crucifi'd according to the promises and predictions that are recorded of him in sundry places of Scripture, as particularly in 
Psal.
 2.7. where Christ is said in the day of his 
resurrection, to be be∣gotten
 
of the Father,
 because he was then most eminently declar'd to be the Son of God [
Rom.
 1.4.] And in 
Isa.
 55.3, God not only promises to raise him from the dead, but to secure him from ever dying any more, say∣ing, 
I will give you the sure mercies of David,
 that is, perform unto you the gracious promises made to 
David.
 Now it was promised to 
Da∣vid,
 that 
of his seed should arise the Messias,
 who should have an everlasting Kingdom, and who should not see corruption, as 'tis 
Psal.
 16.11. If therefore God should suffer his Son to return again to the place of corruption, 
viz.
 the grave, how could he make good the promises he had made to 
D
vid.
 For these words cannot be applyed personally to 
David;
 for 
David
 after he had served his generation, dyed and never rose again▪ but his body putrified in the earth. But Je∣sus in whom this prophesie is compleatly fulfilled, was raised again from the dead, and saw no corruption▪ nor was his body putri∣fied in he earth. This therefore he shews is the Gospel that they preached unto them, namely, that 
this Jesus
 is the 
true Messias,
 by whose 
merits
 and 
intercession,
 remission of sins is to

 be obtained and whosoever 
believes in him
 shall certainly be freed from the wrath of God, and the punishments attending sin in another world; from which the 
law of Moses
 could not of it self, by all its ceremonies, washings, and sacrifices, purge or cleanse, or free, any person whatsoever. For the Law of 
Moses
 had only a 
shaddow
 of the good things which were to be performed by Christ. Upon the whole matter therefore he ex∣horts them that they should take heed lest by their obstinate re∣sisting and rejecting this way of Salvation, now preached to them, they should bring a remarkable astonishing destructi∣on upon themselves, such as God threatned to bring upon the Jews of old from the 
Caldaeans [Hab.
 1.5.] where he speaks to them to this purpose, 
Behold ye despisers, and be amazed, and cover or hide
 
your selves, for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe if any man declare it unto you.
 And as the 
Caldaeans
 demolished their first Temple and ruin'd their City, for their impenitent going on in their sins, against all the messages sent them from God by the Prophets; so he advises these pre∣sent Jews to take heed, lest by despising Christ and his Gospel, they bring upon them∣selves a like destruction.


The Apostle having ended his Sermon, as they went out of the Synagogue, the 
Prose∣lytes
 (who were of 
Gentile
 parentage, but had embraced the Jewish religion, and though uncircumcised, frequented their religious as∣semblies) desired to hear more of this sub∣ject the next Sabbath. And some pious per∣sons of the Jews, together with these religi∣ous Proselytes, followed the Apostles to their Lodging, who exhorted them to continue stedfast in the doctrine of the Gospel. And the next Sabbath day came almost the whole City to hear the Gospel preached by them. But the 
chief
 men of the Jews, seeing how the people thronged to hear the Apostles, were horribly enraged at it, and contradicted, and cavilled at the doctrine they preached, and reviled and calum∣niated their persons. However, this nothing discouraged 
Paul
 and 
Barnabas;
 but putting off all fear, they openly declar'd, that they had performed their charge from Christ of preach∣ing the Gospel first to the Jews; but seeing they beha∣ved themselves so obstinately and perversly, and by their con∣tempt thereof shewed and declared themselves unworthy of so great a blessing, they were now by Gods appointment to leave them, and to preach to the 
Gentiles.
 For this was the directi∣on of God, that the Gospel being first preached to the Jews, and rejected by them, it should then be preached to all other people of the world. And this is the sum of that old prophe∣sie, 
Isa.
 49.6. 
I have set thee to be a light to the Gentiles, to give

 the people that sate in darkness knowledg of the way to eternal life.
 When the 
Gentiles
 heard this good news, and understood their own interest in it, they rejoyced exceedingly, and magnified, and highly approved the Gospel and word of the Lord, and as many as were chosen of God, and by the conviction of his Spi∣rit, prepar'd and dispos'd to seek after eternal life, 
believed.
 And the Gospel was preached over the whole Country. But the Jews being enraged hereat, stirred up and exasperated some of the 
female proselytes
 of honourable quality (who were led with a blind zeal against the Gospel, which they understood not, and accordingly, as it seems, stirred up their husbands against it), and other chief persons in the City against the Apostles, and drave them out of their Coasts; who shaking off the dust of their feet against them (as our Saviour had commanded, 
Mat.
 10.14.), departed and went to 
Iconium,
 a City of 
Lycaonia,
 in the lesser 
Asia.
 Yet the Disciples in this City, and the parts adjacent, were nothing discouraged with the Jews Blasphemies, calumnies, and oppositions, but were fill'd with spiritual Joy that they had embrac'd the Gospel, and went on couragiously in their profession of it.


Act.
 13. 
v.
 14. But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.


v.
 15. And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.


v.
 16. Then Paul stood up, and beckning with his hand, said, Men of Is∣rael, and ye that fear God, give audience.


v.
 17. The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people, when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.


v.
 18. And about the time of fourty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.


v.
 19. And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land to them by lot.


v.
 20. And after that he gave unto them judges, about the space of four hundred and fifty years, untill Samuel the prophet.


v.
 21. And afterward they desired a King, and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.


v.
 22. And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king, to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the Son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall ful∣fill all my will.


v.
 23. Of this mans seed hath God, according to his promise, raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:


v.
 24. When John had first preached before his coming, the baptism of re∣pentance to all the people of Israel.


v.
 25. And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not h
. But behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoos of his feet I am not worthy to loose.


v.
 26. Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoso∣ever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.




v.
 27. For they that dwelt at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets, which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.


v.
 28. And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.


v.
 29. And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.


v.
 30. But God raised him from the dead:


v.
 31. And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.


v.
 32. And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,


v.
 33. God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again, as it is also written in the second Psalm: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.


v.
 34. And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption; he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.


v.
 35. Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine holy One to see corruption.


v.
 36. For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption.


v.
 37 But he whom God raised again saw no corruption.


v.
 38. But know 
 
nto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this m
 is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins.


v.
 39. And by him all that believe, are justified from all things, from which you 
 not be justified by the law of Moses.


v.
 40 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophets;


v.
 41. Behold ye despisers, and wonder and perish: for I work a work in in your days, a work which you shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.


v.
 42 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gen∣tiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.


v.
 43. Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who speaking to them, perswaded them to continue in the grace of God.


v.
 44. And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.


v.
 45. But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with en∣vy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contra∣dicting, and blaspheming.


v.
 46. Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judg your selves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.


v.
 47. For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.


v.
 48. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed.


v.
 49. And the word of the Lord was published thorowout all the region.


v.
 50. But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barna∣bas, and expelled them out of their coasts.




v.
 51. But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came un∣to Iconium.


v.
 52. And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the holy Ghost.






























SECT. III.


AT 
Iconium
 they continue long and preach
 powerfully and with good success, the Lord giving testimony to the Gospel (which is the word of his Grace), and working many Miracles by their hands; insomuch that great store both of the 
Jews
 and of the 
Greeks
 that were Proselytes (and frequented the Synagogues of the Jews) re∣ceived the Faith. But here some 
refractary
 unbelieving Jews exasperated the minds of the Gentiles against the Apostles, and all others who had re∣ceived the Faith of Christ by their Ministry. So there grew a division
 in the City, some taking part with the 
persecuting Jews,
 and some with the 
Apostles.
 At last the rage of the 
unbelieving Gentiles
 and 
Jews
 proceeded so far, that they were bent to use the Apostles despitefully and stone them; which they having notice of, slipt away to 
Lystra,
 according to our Savi∣ours command, 
Mat.
 10.23. See 
Act.
 8.1. 
Act.
 9.25.


At 
Lystra
 they preach the Gospel, and 
Paul
 cures a 
Crip∣ple
 (that had been so from his infancy) by a word of his mouth, perceiving that he had a Faith wrought in 
, that he should be healed of this his malady, which was discovered to the A∣postle,

 either by divine revelation, or some external signs
 thereof. The 
Lystrians
 are so affected with this miracle, that they cryed out, 
The Gods
 
are come down to us in the shape of men.
 And they call'd 
Barnabas, Jupiter,
 (which the Heathen held for their highest God); and 
Paul, Mercurius;
 whom they held for the In∣terpreter and Messenger of the Gods, because 
Paul
 here appeared the 
chief speaker.
 And the Priest of 
Jupiter
 (whose Temple, Altar, or Statue stood, as it seems, without the Ci∣ty) came presently to the gates of the House where the Apostles lodged, and brought 
Oxen
 trimmed and adorned with Garlands of Flow∣ers (according to their Heathenish rites) verily purposing to offer sacrifice unto them. Which when the Apostles understood, they rent their Clothes in detestation and abhorrence of such vile Idolatry, and told the people, 
they were meer men of like passions with themselves,
 and in the same condition of mortality; and preached to them to turn from Idols (which are no Gods, what∣ever they accounted them, but meer vanities and nothing, 1 
Cor.
 8.4.) to the living God, who created Heaven and Earth, and all the Creatures therein; who in times past, in a just judgment, left the Gentiles to their own blind Wor∣ships and Idolatries, and yet whilst he did so, left not off to evidence himself sufficiently to them, to be 
the true God,
 in the works of his 
wisdom, power,
 and 
providence,
 and by that great goodness of his, in giving them 
rain
 and fruitful seasons, and the like; which are acts of his particular Power and Boun∣ty [
Rom.
 1.19.]; thereby filling their hearts with gladness, from the abundance with which he crowned the years, and by these means inviting and drawing them off from their impieties and idolatries. All which discourse of the Apostles could yet hardly restrain them from sacrificing to them. Not long after this, some unbelieving Jews from 
Antioch
 of 
Pisidia
 and 
Ico∣nium,
 who had driven the Apostles out of their own Cities (as we have seen before) came hither, and by fair words gai∣ned the inconstant multitude, who even now would have sa∣crificed to the Apostles, to be on their side and to joyn with them against them: So that being desperately enrag'd, in a fu∣rious tumultuary manner, they threw stones
 at 
Paul
 as a Blasphemer [
Lev.
 24.16. 
Deut.
 13.10.] and thinking they had killed him, dragg'd him as a dead man out of the gates of the City [See 2 
Cor.
 11.25.]. But as the Disciples came about him, think∣ing, as it seems, solemnly to 
interr
 him, if he were dead, or to administer help to him if there were any life yet remaining in him; by the wonderful power of God he re∣viv'd again, and rose up in the midst of them, and returned

 into that injurious City to refresh himself, and the next day he went with 
Barnabas
 to 
Derbe.


Act.
 14.1. And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews, and also of the Greeks believed.


v.
 2. But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil-affected against the brethren.


v.
 3. Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and won∣ders to be done by their hands.


v.
 4. But the multitude of the ci
y was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the Apostles.


v.
 5. And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and al∣so of the Jews, with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them.


v.
 6. They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra, and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lyeth round about:


v.
 7. And there they preached the gospel.


v.
 8. And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mothers womb, who never had walked.


v.
 9. The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and per∣ceiving that he had faith to be healed,


v.
 10. Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he lea∣ped and walked.


v.
 11. And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lift up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.


v.
 12. And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.


v.
 13. Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen, and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.


v.
 14. Which when the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,


v.
 15. And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you, that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein.


v.
 16. Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.


v.
 17. Nevertheless, he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.


v.
 18. And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.


v.
 19. And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who perswaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.


v.
 20. Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and came into the city, and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.




















SECT. IV.


AT 
Derbe
 they preach the Gospel, and instruct many; Among others that there gave their Names to Christ, 
Timothy
 was one, with his holy Mother 
Eunice,
 and Grandmother 
Lois,
 who had taken great care of his education and had instructed him in the Scriptures from his infancy. He was well acquainted with the sufferings of his 
spiritual
 Father 
Paul
 at 
Antioch
 of 
Pisidia, Iconium,
 and 
Lystra,
 as 
Paul
 afterwards intimates, 2 
Tim.
 3.10, 11. The Apostles went no further than this City at this time, but returned the very way they came, travelling back again to 
Lystra, Iconium,
 and 
Antioch
 of 
Pisidia, confirming
 in the Faith, as they went along, those whom they had before converted to Christ [See 
Act.
 15.32, 41. & 18.23.], and exhorting them to 
persevere,
 and to make account that they must 
meet with many tribulations
 in the way to the Kingdom of Heaven. And in all the Churches they 
constituted (a) Elders
 by fasting and prayer to teach and guide them. And having commended them to the care of Christ, on whom they believed, they took their leaves of them.






Then travelling over 
Pisidia,
 they came to 
Pamphylia,
 and ha∣ving preached the word at 
Perga,
 they went down unto 
Atta∣lia,
 and thence sailed to 
Antioch
 in 
Syria,
 (from whence they set out two years before, when they were by the prayers of that Church commended to the Grace and Assistance of the Spirit of God, to be carried on in this great work of conver∣ting the Gentiles. And being come thither, and calling the Church in that City together, they declared what God had done by them, and how he had co-operated with them in their Ministry, and how he had opened a door of Faith to the Gen∣tiles, so that great numbers of them came in, and believed in Christ.


Act.
 14. 
v.
 21. And when they had preached the Gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch.


v.
 22. Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to con∣tinue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.


v.
 23. And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.


v.
 24. And after they had passed thorowout Pisidia, they came to Pam∣phylia.


v.
 25. And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia.


v.
 26. And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been re∣commended to the grace of God, for the work which they ful∣filled.


v.
 27. And when they were come, and had gathered the church toge∣ther, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.


v.
 28. And there they abode long time with the disciples.


















CHAP. IV.
 Relating 
Paul
's second Journey or Peragration with 
Barnabas
 and others,
 from 
Antioch
 to that famous 
Council
 at 
Jerusalem,
 which we call, 
Iter Hierosolymitanum.




SECT. 1.


PAul
 and 
Barnabas
 stayed now with the Disciples at 
Antioch
 a great while. After which, as it seems, 
Paul
 propagated the Gospel as far as 
Illyricum,
 (a Country lying on the 
Adria∣tick
 Sea, bordering on 
Macedonia,
 now call'd 
Slavonia
) prea∣ching such things to them, concerning Christ, as they never heard before; as he himself testifies, 
Rom.
 15.19, 20, 21. 
Through mighty signs by the power of the spirit of God, so that from Jeru∣salem, and round about Illyricum, I have fully preached the Gos∣pel of Christ: yea so have I striven to preach, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another mans foundation. But as it is written [Isa.
 52.15.] 
To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see, and they that have not heard, shall understand.


During this time, 'tis probable, he suffered some of those things, which in his second Epistle to the 
Corinthians, ch.
 11. 
v.
 24, 25. he makes mention of, to wit, that 
he had five times received forty stripes save one from the Jews
 [See 
Deut.
 25.3.] and 
thrice been beaten with wands,
 probably, by the 
Lictors
 or 
Roman officers
 at the command of the Gentiles; and 
had thrice suffered ship∣wrack,
 in one of which it seems, he was 
a day and a night floa∣ting in the Sea,
 and yet by the wonderful power and provi∣dence of God, was preserved and delivered out of that extream danger.






SECT. II.


ABout this time, it seems, certain Jews of the 
Sect
 of the 
Pharisees,
 who had embraced the Gospel, came down from 
Judea
 to 
Antioch,
 and taught, that the 
Gentiles,
 conver∣ted to Christianity, ought to be 
circumcised,
 and keep the Law of 
Moses,
 if they would be saved; disturbing and disquieting the Consciences of many of the Brethren in 
Syria
 and 
Cilicia,


 by this their perverse Doctrine
. Against these 
Paul
 and 
Barnabas
 stilly oppose them∣selves, and not without great reason. For many of the 
Jews
 were yet zealous for the observance of the Ceremonial Law, as ap∣pears 
Act.
 21.20. And th
y were not only hard to be brought off themselves from those Rites wherein they had ever been trained up, but they would have imposed them upon the 
believing Gentiles
 also. This bred great disturbance at present, and in time an 
Apostacy
 of very many from the Gospel. 
Paul
 and 
Barnabas
 therefore (who had chiefly to deal in the ministration to the 
Gentiles
) are now sent 
from Antioch
 to consult the 
Apostles at Jerusalem
 about this case. This is the journey that is spoken of, 
Gal.
 2.1. 
Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jeru∣salem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me: and I went up by revelation,
 &c. Not but that he was sent by the Church, but the Church was directed 
by a special revelation
 from God, (ei∣ther first signified to them, or else to 
Paul
 immediately, and by him made known to them) to take this course for the settling this Question.


Paul
 and 
Barnabas
 being brought on their way and accom∣panied by some of the Brethren of 
Antioch
 (that it might ap∣pear they went not of their own accord, but as sent by that Church), they declared, as they passed along, to the Brethren, every where, for their comfort and confirmation, what great things God had done by their ministry, in the conversion of the 
Gentiles.
 When they came to 
Jerusalem
 (being kindly re∣ceived by the Apostles, and Elders, and the Church there), They began to open their Message, acquainting them what suc∣cess God had given to their preaching among the 
Gentiles,
 and how wonderfully his Spirit had co-operated with them; Yet so it was, that some 
Judaizing
 Christians of the Sect of the 
Pharisees
 coming to 
Antioch
 had taught, that such 
Gentiles who embraced the faith,
 ought to receive Circumcision, and were ob∣liged to the observation of the Ceremonial Law. So that 
faith in Christ
 was not judged sufficient (by these men) to justifica∣tion, but according to them, 
Circumcision,
 and an observation of the Ceremonial Law must be joyned with it. These things they intimate had bred a difference among them: They were therefore come thither from the Church at 
Antioch
 to consult the Apostles in this case; and to desire their determination therein. Hereupon the 
Apostles
 and 
Elders
 of the Church at 
Jerusalem,
 met 
in Council
 to consider of this matter
. After there had been much dis∣putation and reasoning 
pro
 and 
con;
 at length 
Peter
 stood up, and declared his judg
 in this case, shewing them, that a good while ago, God made choice of him among all the Apostles 
first,
 To preach the Gos∣pel to the 
Gentiles,
 as particularly to 
Cornelius
 and his Family


[
Act.
 10. See 
Sect.
 5. of 
Chap.
 2.] And God who alone knows all hearts, and can alone judg of the purity of them, bare witness to those 
Gentiles,
 that they were accepted of him, though they were not Circumcised; a clear evidence of which was his giving them the Gifts of his Holy Spirit, both 
ordinary
 and 
extraordinary [Act.
 10.44.] as he had done before to the A∣postles themselves. Neither made he any difference between the 
Jews
 and them, as to the Gifts and Benefits which are com∣mon to those who believe in Christ; but instead of the exter∣nal purifications of the Law of 
Moses,
 he hath purified the hearts both of believing Circumcised 
Jews,
 and believing Uncircum∣cised 
Gentiles, by faith in his Son,
 whose blood cleanses from all Guilt, and whose Spirit sanctifies and purifies the Heart and Conscience from dead works. He demands therefore why they did press 
that
 which was so contrary to the Will of God, and refus'd to 
believe that,
 which was so plainly testified to be his Will, namely, that the 
believing Gentiles were pure,
 though 
uncircumcised,
 so that the 
Jews
 might freely converse with them. He further shews, this was a provoking of God, To impose upon the believing 
Gentiles
 the 
yoke
 of the 
Mo∣saical
 Law, [See 
Gal.
 5.3.] which never be∣longed to them, and which the 
Jews
 them∣selves were never able to bear, nor so to per∣form as to be justified thereby. But as our Fathers (saies he) were not saved by the works of the Law [
Gal.
 3.11. 
Rom.
 3.20.] but by the Grace and Favour of God meri∣ted by the righteousness and sufferings of the 
Messias,
 in whom they believed [
Heb.
 11. 
Rom.
 3.25. 
Rom.
 10.8.]; so do we expect to be saved by the same Grace, and no otherwise.


Peter
 having ended his Speech, 
Paul
 and 
Barnabas
 declared what Wonders and Miracles God had enabled them to do, in the converting of the 
Gentiles,
 which was another argument from Heaven, that God was well-pleased with their Ministra∣tion to the 
Gentiles,
 and that the 
Gentiles
 were accepted by him, though 
uncircumcised,
 seeing they had received the Gifts of the Spirit, as well as they of the 
Circumcision.


Next after them, 
James
 the Son of 
Alphaeus
 [See of him 
Act.
 12.17. & 
Sect.
 9. of 
Chap.
 2.] began to speak, saying, 
Simon
 
Peter
 hath sufficiently demonstra∣ted, that it pleased God sometime since, to look down in mercy upon the Uncircumci∣sed 
Gentiles,
 and out of them to take a peo∣ple to himself, to bear his Name, to acknow∣ledg and worship him for their only God. And this is agreeable to what was foretold by the Prophet 
Amos ch.
 9:11, 12. where God declares, that 
in the latter days, viz.
 the days of the Gospel, he will raise up and restore the 
house


 or 
tabernacle
 of 
David,
 (though at present it was low, by the falling off of the Ten Tribes, and other breaches that were made upon it) and change it into a spiritual and everlasting Kingdom under the 
Messias
 (of whom 
David
 was a Type), which shall comprehend and take in, 
all the chosen Gentiles;
 yea, even some of their greatest enemies (typified by 
Edom
) shall be brought under the obedience of Christ by the preaching of the Gospel, and operation of the Holy Ghost; so that this Kingdom in this sense, shall be in a more flourishing estate, than in the days of old, [See 
Ephes.
 3.5, 6. & 
Eph.
 2.12, 13, 
&c.
] And this though it were not brought to pass actually, till these latter days, was yet fore∣seen and predetermined by God long ago, and accordingly fore∣told by that Prophet. Therefore thus I judg (says he), and this is my opinion in this matter that we ought not to impose 
Cir∣cumcision
 upon the converted 
Gentiles,
 nor lay Yokes and Burdens on them, which Christ hath freed them from. Yet that the 
Jews,
 who are so zealous to have these Yokes imposed, might have less offence, and the 
Gentiles
 no burden neither; he pro∣poseth this temper, 
viz.
 That the 
believing Gentiles
 for avoid∣ing of scandal to the weak 
Jews,
 be required to observe these Four things. First, To refrain 
from eating things offered to Idols,
 because it is a kind of participation in that Idolatry, [See 1 
Cor.
 10.19, 20, 21, 22. & 1 
Cor.
 8.10.] Secondly, From 
fornicati∣on
, which though against the Moral Law, yet the Gentiles, (it seems) for the most part held to be no sin, or at least no great sin, be∣ing practis'd out of marriage [See 1 
Cor.
 6.13, 14, 15.]. Thirdly, 
From things strang∣led,
 that is, from eating of Beasts which dy∣ed without letting blood, which was an abo¦mination to the 
Jews [Gen.
 9.4. 
Lev.
 17.14.]. Fourthly, 
From blood
, namely, separated from the Beast, whether congealed, or not congealed; which God had (as some think) forbidden, to affright men from all cruelty and blood-shedding, [See 
Lev.
 3. 17.] And besides, 
blood
 being, among the 
Jews,
 destina∣ted to 
sacrifices,
 and to represent the blood of the 
Messias
 that makes attonement for sin [
Lev.
 17.11.], the common use of it was very odious to the 
Jews.
 These 
Four things
 he advises, that the 
converted Gentiles
 be required to forbear, that they might not give offence to the 
Jews,
 who could not but have a great ab∣horrence for them, they hearing 
Moses
's writings read in their Synagogues every sabbath day, wherein they are so strictly for∣bidden.

 Therefore he thought it fit for the present, That the 
Gentiles
 should in a charitable compliance so far condescend to the 
Jews
. This proposal of 
James,
 the rest of the 
Council
 readily agreed unto. And the matter being thus determined, by the ac∣quiescing of all in the judgment of 
James,
 the Apostles and Elders thought fit (the whole Church thereunto consenting) to send 
Judas
 and 
Silas,
 (two of their own number, and men eminent among them) along with 
Paul
 and 
Barnabas
 to 
Antioch▪
 that by the Testi∣mony of their own Commissioners, and the 
Letters
 and 
Decrees
 of the Council, the 
false Teachers
 might be silenced, and the 
believing Gentiles
 confirm'd in the truth, and assured that the Apostles and Church at 
Jerusalem
 held the same Doctrine, that 
Paul
 and 
Barnabas
 had before preached; and that these their 
Commissioners
 might also help to compose the minds of those, who by the Adversaries had been disturbed and disquieted. By 
these four
 therefore, they send their Letters and Decrees to the Churches in 
Antioch,
 and also in 
Syria
 and 
Cili∣cia.
 (For among them also, the false Teachers had spread their 
leaven,
 which afterwards diffused it self further as may appear by 
Pauls
 Epistles to the 
Romans, Galatians,
 and 
Philippians,
 &c.). In their Letters, they give them to understand that they had re∣ceived advertisement, that some 
Judaizing
 Christians which went from thence, endeavoured to subvert them, teaching 
new do∣ctrines,
 which they never commanded them to teach, mingling the Legal Ceremonies, and the Judaical Observances with the Gospel, and injoining them as necessary to justification: Where∣fore they thought fit, to send two eminent men of their own number to them to accompany 
Paul
 and 
Barnabas
 (who were persons with whom they fully agreed in this matter of difference, and such to whom they could not but give this Testimony, That in preaching the Gospel, they had behaved themselves with great sincerity and uprightness, and had run the hazard of their Lives for the service of Christ). With them therefore they had sent 
Judas
 and 
Silas,
 that they might tell the Churches by word of mouth, more largely, what here they had written but brie∣fly. They further tell them, that they had determined in this Case as they were guided by the Spirit
 of God, whose Inspiration and Conduct they had followed, and therefore had decreed, That the 
believing Gentiles
 should not be ob∣liged to 
Circumcision,
 or other Judaical ob∣servances, but only to those Four necessary things before mentioned; whereof, though 
abstaining from fornication,
 and 
eating things offered to Idols,
 as such▪ (which was a kind of participation in that Idolatry) be only sim∣ply and absolutely necessary, as being for∣bidden

 by the moral Law) yet the 
other two
 are necessary in respect of the 
present time;
 and for the 
peace, unity,
 and 
edification
 of the present Church, and to avoid giving scandal to the 
weak
 believing Jews: so that there was an 
accidental
 and 
temporary
 necessity only of abstaining from them, till the infirm Jews were better inform'd, and better understood their liberty in Christ. For afterwards▪ 
Paul
 sheweth that nothing is 
unclean
 that God hath made for mans use; as we may see, 1 
Cor.
 8.8. & 10.19. 1 
Tim.
 4.4. 
Tit.
 1.15.


These 
four persons
 therefore being dismiss'd by the Council at 
Jerusalem,
 came with the 
decretal Epistle
 to 
Antioch,
 and cal∣ling the Church together, presented it to them; which when they had read, they much rejoiced, that their practise was ap∣proved by the 
Apostles,
 and received the 
exhortation
 given them in that Epistle with much gladness. Here 
Judas
 and 
Silas
 (be∣ing men of eminent Gifts in teaching and interpreting the Scrip∣tures) employed themselves in confirming and building up the Brethren in the Faith. After they had stayed at 
Antioch
 some∣time, they were with all kindness dismiss'd of the Church there, to go back to 
Jerusalem;
 but it seems, for some particular rea∣son, 
Silas
 was not willing to return yet, but chose to stay with 
Paul
 and 
Barnabas,
 who continued at 
Antioch,
 instructing those who had received the Faith, and so likewise did many others also.


Act.
 15. 
v.
 1. And certain men which came down from Judea, taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Mo∣ses, ye cannot be saved.


v.
 2. When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissention and dis∣putation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and cer∣tain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem, unto the Apostles and Elders about this question.


v.
 3. And being brought on their way by the Church, they passed thorow Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles, and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.


v.
 4. And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the Church, and of the Apostles and Elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.


v.
 5. But there arose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees, which belie∣ved, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.


v.
 6. And the Apostles and Elders came together for to consider of this matter.


v.
 7. And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them; Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the Gospel, and believe.


v.
 8. And God which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the holy Ghost, even as he did unto us,




v.
 9. And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.


v.
 10. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?


v.
 11. But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved, even as they.


v.
 12. Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought a∣mong the Gentiles by them.


v.
 13. And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me.


v.
 14. Simon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his Name.


v.
 15. And to this agree the words of the prophets, as it is written.


v.
 16. After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of Da∣vid, which is fallen down, and I will build again the ruines thereof, and I will set it up:


v.
 17. That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom my Name is called, saith the Lord, who doth all these things:


v.
 18. Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.


v.
 19. Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them which from among the Gentiles are turned to God.


v.
 20. But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.


v.
 21. For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.


v.
 22. Then pleased it the Apostles, and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas: namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men a∣mong the brethren,


v.
 23. And wrote letters by them after this manner, The Apostles, and Elders, and brethren, send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia.


v.
 24. Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us, have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law, to whom we gave no such commandment:


v.
 25. It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you, with our beloved Barnabas, and Paul.


v.
 26. Men that have hazarded their lives for the Name of our Lord Je∣sus Christ.


v.
 27. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.


v.
 28. For it seemed good to the holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden then these necessary things:


v.
 29. That ye obstain from meats offered to Idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep your selves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.


v.
 30. So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the Epistle.


v.
 31. Which when they had read, they rejoyced for the consolation.


v.
 32. And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.




v.
 33. And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the Apostles.


v.
 34. Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.


v.
 35. Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preach∣ing the word of the Lord, with many others also.


Gal.
 2. 
v.
 1. Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.


v.
 2. And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that Gospel, which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run in vain.


v.
 3. But neither Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:


v.
 4. And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage.


v.
 5. To whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour, that the truth of the Gospel might continue with you.


v.
 6. But of these, who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me, God accepteth no mans person) for they who seemed to be somewhat, in conference added nothing to me.


v.
 7. But contrariwise, when they saw that the Gospel of the uncircum∣cision was committed unto me, as the Gospel of the uncircumcision was unto Peter,


v.
 8. (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the Apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me towards the Gentiles)


v.
 9. And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, per∣ceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barna∣bas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.


v.
 10. Only they would that we should remember the poor, the same which I also was forward to do.






SECT. III.


PEter
 (as it seems) about this time came from 
Jerusalem
 to 
Antioch,
 and for a while using his 
Gospel-liberty
 did eat, and familiarly converse with the believing 
Gentiles;
 but cer∣tain Brethren of the 
Jews,
 that were Friends
 of 
James,
 and very tenacious of the Ce∣remonial Law, coming thither from 
Jerusa∣lem;
 He for fear of offending these men, or incurring their ill will, withdrew himself from the 
Gentiles,
 as if it had been unlawful to have any fellowship with 
uncircumcised
 persons; the lawfulness of which converse, he very well knew, and therefore feigned, and dissembled in this matter. And some other 
Jewish Converts
 of the Church of 
Antioch
 followed this Example, insomuch that 
Barnabas
 also was carried away with their cowardise and dissembling. 
Paul
 not brooking this, as contrary to the Gospel liberty, did by virtue of his Apostolick Office, and with authority, rebuke 
Peter,
 and openly and freely opposed himself against him in this

 matter, expostulating with him, that he being a 
Jew
 (and so more bound to observe the Ceremonial Law, which was given to the 
Jews,
 and not to the 
Gentiles
), had cast off that Yoke himself, and yet should go about to inforce it upon the 
Gen∣tiles.
 And as far as appears, 
Peter
 did yield to 
Paul
 in this de∣bate, as having truth on his side.


Gal.
 2. 
v.
 11. But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.


v.
 12. For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gen∣tiles: but when they were come, he withdrew, and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.


v.
 13. And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him, insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.


v.
 14. But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews: why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?






SECT. IV.


ABout this time 
Paul
 (who desired not only to plant Chur∣ches but also to water them) propounded to 
Barnabas,
 that they might go and visit the Churches which they had plan∣ted in several Countries, and see whether they did thrive and grow in the knowledg of Christ, and obedience to him, and ac∣cordingly might exhort, and confirm them. To this 
Barnabas
 readily agreed, only desired that they might take his Nephew 
John Mark
 along with them
. This 
Paul
 was by no means willing to, because he had deserted them before at 
Pamphylia,
 and had not accompanied them constantly in their work of preaching the Gospel to the 
Gentiles
 [See 
Sect.
 1. of 
Chap.
 3.]. 
Barnabas
 took this very ill, that such a blot should rest on his Sisters Son. The contention hereupon grew so sharp between these two holy men, and proceeded to such an exasperation
 (they therein shewing them∣selves to be men of like passions with others) that 
Barnabas
 went away with 
John Mark
 to his own Country 
Cyprus,
 and 
Paul
 chose 
Si∣las
 to go along with him. Yet God (who useth to bring good out of evil) turned this to the best; for though they differed about 
John Mark,
 yet neither of them forsook his office or ministry, and though they were separated as to their 
persons,
 yet not as to 
Faith
 or 
Doctrine
 and being thus parted the one from the other, the Gospel was published by them in more places.




v.
 36. And some days after, Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.


v.
 37. And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose sirname was Mark.


v.
 38. But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who de∣parted from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.


v.
 39. And the contention was so sharp between them, that they depar∣ted asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus.


v.
 40. And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.










CHAP. V.
 Containing 
Paul
's Third Journey being accom∣panied with 
Silas,
 to visit the Brethren in th
se Cities, where He and 
Barnabas
 had before pre
ched the Gospel. Which we call, for di
inctions sake, 
Iter Graecum,
 sive 
Macedonicum,
 His 
Macedonian
 Journey.




SECT. I.


PA
l
 being accompanied by 
Silas,
 and 
Titus,
 and re∣commended to the blessing of God, by the prayers of the Church, travels thorow 
Syria
 and 
Cilicia,
 to confirm those Churches which he and Barnabas in their first jour∣ney to
ther had planted. And as they passed thorow the Cities they delivered them the 
Decrees
 to observe, which were or∣dai
ed by the Apostles and Elders, met in the 
Council
 at 
Je∣rusalem,
 whereby those Churches were established in the Faith, and many more every day converted unto Christ.


Act.
 15. 
v.
 40. And Paul chose Silas, and d
parted, being r
commended by the brethren unto the grace of God.


v.
 41. And he went thorow Syria and Cilicia, confirming the Chur∣ches.


Act.
 16. 
v.
 4. And as they went thorow the Cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the Apostles and Elders, which were at J
rusalem.


v.
 5. And so were the Churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.






SECT. II.


ABout this time, as 'tis probable: From 
Tarsus
 a Haven in 
Cilicia, Paul
 sailed to 
Crete,
 and there having for some

 time preached the Gospel, left 
Titus
 to set in order the things that for want of time were unsetled by him.


Tit.
 1. 
v.
 5. For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee.






SECT. III.


FRom 
Crete
 sailing back to 
Cilicia:
 At 
Lystra
 he sound (a∣mong other Disciples) 
Timothy
 born of a Father that was a 
Greek,
 though his Mother 
Eunice
 was a 
believing Jew,
 2 
Tim.
 1.5. This young man had been religiously educated by the care of his pious Mother and Grandmother, being from a Child trai∣ned up in the knowledg of 
the holy Scriptures
 [2 
Tim.
 3.14, 15.], but was not 
circumcised
 in his infancy, after the custom of the 
Jews.
 He was well-reported of by the brethren at 
Lystra;
 and some remarkable 
prophecies,
 and 
predictions
 had passed concer∣ning him, what an eminent instrument he should prove in the Gospel, 1 
Tim.
 1.18. 
Paul
 intending to take him along with him, as his Companion, and to imploy him in preaching the Gospel, that his ministry might not be ineffectual among the 
Jews,
 (who knew him to be 
uncircumcised,
 and the Son of an 
uncircumcised
 Father, and thereupon would not admit him to speak in their Synagogues) he took and 
circumcised
 him. The Apostle and his Companions desired now to propagate the Gospel into the other Provinces of 
A∣sia, properly so called,
 (to wit, that part of it which lay about 
Ephesus
) but when they had passed thorow 
Phrygia
 and 
Galatia,
 (where 
Paul
 was most kindly received and welcomed by them, even as if he had been an Angel from heaven, 
Gal.
 4.14, 15.) they were forbidden by some 
revelation,
 or in∣ward speaking of the holy Ghost to them, for that time
 to go any further. For this blessed Spirit prescribed to them, what order and course they should hold in preach∣ing the Gospel, directing them to go to one people first, and then to another. Therefore being come to 
Mysia,
 they purposed to go into 
Bithynia,
 but the 
Spirit
 suffered them not, intending to hasten them into 
Macedo∣nia,
 to a new work; so that passing by 
Mysia,
 they came to 
Troas,
 where 
Paul
 had by night a 
Vision
 from God, and saw a man in a 
Macedonian
 habit stand by him, 
who prayed him to come over in∣to that countrey to help them;
 the like call he had not in all his travels to any other place. Hereupon he determined to pass from 
Asia


 into 
Europe,
 concluding that God had cal∣led him to preach the Gospel in 
Macedonia.
 And here 
Luke
 seems to have join'd himself to 
Paul,
 and ever after to have been his constant Companion. For having spoken in the third person before, he speaks in the first here.


Act.
 16.1. Then came he to Derbe, and Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was th
re, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewesse, and believed; but his father was a Greek:


v.
 2. Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.


v.
 3. Him would Paul have to go forth with him, and took, and circum∣cised him, because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.


v.
 6. Now when they had gone thorowout Phrygia, and the region of Galati
, and were forbidden of the holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,


v.
 7. After they w
re come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spiri
 suffered them not.


v.
 8 And they 
sing by Mysia, came down to Troas.


v.
 9. And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: there stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.


v.
 10. And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the Gospel unto them.












SECT. IV.


PAul,
 and 
Silas,
 with 
Luke,
 and 
Timothy
 now loosing from 
Troas,
 came with a very fair gale to 
Samothracia,
 an Island in the 
Aegean
 Sea, not far from 
Thracia,
 and thence to 
Neapolis
 (a City on the borders of 
Thracia
 and 
Macedonia
), and from thehce they pass'd to 
Philippi
 the chief City of that part of 
Macedonia,
 and a 
Roman
 Colony. Here on the Sabbath day,

 they went out of the City to a place, where a 
house of prayer
 was appointed by the Law to be by the River side. In this place, 
Paul
 preached the Gospel to several women there met together, the men it seems refusing to hear him. And in the time of his preaching, 
Lydia
 a stranger, born in 
Thyatyra
 (a City that lay on the borders of 
Mysia
 and 
Lydia
), a Proselyte of the 
Jews,
 had her mind enlightened by the Spirit
 of God, and her heart graciously inclin'd to embrace the Gospel, and to believe in Christ.


Whereupon she her self was forthwith baptized, and desiring to consecrate all within her Family to Christ, her whole hous∣hold was baptized also. Then to testifie her gratitude, she cour∣teously entertained 
Paul
 and his Companions in her house.


After this, as they went again toward the place of Prayer, a certain 
maid servant
 that was possessed with a Devil (who speaking from within her, revealed secret, and future things, and thereby gained much to her Masters) followed them, crying out, 
These are the servants of the most high God, who declare unto us the way of salvation. Paul
 not brooking that the truth should be thus rendred suspected by the Testi∣mony of the Father of Lyes, commanded the unclean Spirit, in the Name of Christ, to come out of her, and he came out immediately. The Masters of the Maid seeing their gain, which came in by her divination, now at an end, they drew 
Paul
 and 
Silas
 before the principal Rulers and Commanders of the Co∣lony there, telling them that these men being 
Jews,
 did much disquiet and disturb the City, teaching a religion contrary to theirs, and to the 
Roman
 Laws, which permitted the practice of no Worship, but what was approved by the Senate of 
Rome.
 The multitude also being by this suggestion enraged against them, the Rulers commanded them to be stript, and beaten, and cast into prison; where they were harshly used by the 
Gaoler,
 being thrust into the inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks. At midnight as they were praying and singing 
Psalms
 (rejoycing that they suffered for Christs sake), there was a great Earthquake, and the prison doors were thrown open, and all the prisoners bands were loosed. The 
Goaler
 awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, and appre∣hending his prisoners had made an escape, was ready to have laid violent hands on himself, But 
Paul
 cryed out to him that he should not harm himself; for they were all there. Then he came trembling in, and fell at the Apostles feet, as one that would intreat pardon for his hard usage of them; and bring∣ing them out of the inner prison, he spake to them to this pur∣pose. 
Sirs, I now see and acknowledg that the doctrine taught by you is the truth of the Eternal God, and he hath by this mi∣racle testified to me, that you are his true and faithful servants. Tell me therefore I beseech you, what I must do to be saved.
 They

 tell him, 
He must believe
 
on the Lord Je∣sus Christ,
 which if he, and his Family 
(b)
 shall do, they shall be saved. Then they more largely opened to him and his houshold the Doctrine of the Gospel, and he to testi∣fie his love and thankfulness to them washed their stripes, and used the best remedies he could to asswage the pain,
 and heal the wounds and soreness, that remained to them from their scourging: Then immediately the 
Goaler
 and 
all his houshold,
 were baptized un∣to Christ, and dedicated unto his service. And further to testifie his respect and kind∣ness to the Apostles, he set meat before them to refresh them, and rejoiced exceedingly that 
he
 and 
his
 had obtained so great mercy from God, as to be brought to 
believe in Christ.
 When it was day, the Magistrates (possibly being terrified with the Earthquake, or considering how injuriously they had used the Apostles, only for casting out a Devil) sent their Serjeants to release them (yet 
privily
) out of prison. The 
Goaler
 be∣ing glad of their release, chearfully brought them the news of it. But the Apostles refused
 to be thus privily released, alledging that the Rulers had without any legal tryal scourged them, who were not only innocent persons, but 
free men of Rome,
 and had the right and pri∣viledg of the Citizens thereof; and so by the 
Valerian
 Law, might not be 
bound;
 and by the 
Sempronian
 might not be scourged with∣out a legal Processe [See 
ch.
 22.25.]. The Governours understanding this, and know∣ing that the punishment was great for any man to injure a Citizen of 
Rome,
 they came themselves, and brought them out, and be∣sought them to depart. And from the prison they went to the house of 
Lydia,
 and having spent some time in confirming and strengthning the brethren, they departed thence.


Act.
 16. 
v.
 11. Therefore loosing from Tarsus, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis:


v.
 12. And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding cer∣tain days.


v.
 13. And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made, and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.


v.
 14. And a certain woman, named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatyra, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.


v.
 15. And when she was baptized, and her houshold, she besought us, say∣ing,

 If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.


v.
 16. And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination, met us: which brought her masters much gain by sooth-saying.


v.
 17. The same followed Paul and us, and cryed, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.


v.
 18. And this did she many days: but Paul being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the Name of Jesus Christ, to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.


v.
 19. And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the market-place unto the rulers,


v.
 20, And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,


v.
 21. And teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.


v.
 22. And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and comm
nded to beat them.


v.
 23. And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jaylor to keep them safely.


v.
 24. Who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.


v.
 25. And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.


v.
 26. And suddenly there was a great earth-quake, so that the founda∣tions of the prison were shaken, and immediately all the doors were opened, and every ones bands were loosed.


v.
 27. And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.


v.
 28. But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thy self no harm, for we are all here.


v.
 29. Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas.


v.
 30. And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be sa∣ved?


v.
 31. And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thin
 house.


v.
 32. And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.


v.
 33. And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was baptized, he and all his straightway.


v.
 34. And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.


v.
 35. And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.


v.
 36. And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul: The magi∣strates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.


v.
 37. But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondem∣ned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison, and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily, but let them come themselves, and fetch us out.


v.
 38. And the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans.




v.
 39. And they came, and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.


v.
 40. And they went out of the prison, and entred into the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
























SECT. V.


FRom 
Philippi
 (where they had been thus ill used, See 1 
Thes.
 2.2.), they came to 
Thessalonica
 the chief City in 
Mace∣donia;
 and here being a Synagogue of the 
Jews, (Paul
 as his manner was) went unto them, and first preached the Gospel to them, and for three Sabbath days together, plainly shewed them, that it was foretold in the Scriptures, that the 
Messias
 promised to the 
Jews,
 must 
suffer death
 and 
rise again,
 and that this 
Jesus
 whom he preached, is, that 
long expected Messias.
 Some of the 
Jews
 hereupon were perswaded to believe and embrace the 
Faith,
 and associated themselves with 
Paul
 and 
Silas,
 and so likewise did many of the 
Greeks
 that were 
Proselytes,
 and ma∣ny women also of the better quality. Here 
Paul
 instructed them, not only concerning 
faith in Christ,
 but also concerning 
Antichrist,
 and when he should be revealed (as appears from 2 
Thes.
 2.2, 3, 4, 5.). And here also he received relief from the believing 
Philippians,
 once and again for the supply of his necessities, as he testifies, 
Phil.
 4.16. But several of the 
Jews
 in this city, continuing in their unbelief, and being enraged at the Apostles, took to them certain lewd people of the Town, and assaulted the house of 
Jason,
 where they lodged, intending to drag them out to the people, and possibly to stone them. But finding them not there, they haled 
Jason,
 and some other

 believers, who, as it seems, had newly receiv'd the Gospel, before the Magistrates vehemently accusing the Apostles and their followers, as 
disturbers
 of the peace, and enemies to 
Caesar;
 whereas they only endea∣voured to advance the 
spiritual kingdom
 of Christ, without doing any injury to the 
Ro∣man
 Empire. However these (though false) suggestions and criminations much troubled the people and the Magistrates. But when they had received satisfaction and security from 
Jason,
 and the rest that they would appear when called for, they dis∣missed them. However the Brethren immediately sent away 
Paul
 and 
Silas
 by night
 unto 
Beraea;
 whi∣ther being come they found there, persons be
ter bred, and of a more ingenuous tem∣per than those they had met with in 
Thessa∣lonica,
 and who examined whether the Doctrines taught by 
Paul
 were agreeable to what the Scriptures foretold of the 
Messias,
 
or no: and here thier endeavours were bless
d with the Conversion of many of the 
Jews,
 and likewise of the 
Gentiles,
 and several of them were persons of the bet
r sort. But the unbelieving 
Jews
 of 
Thessalonica
 hear∣ing of this, follow the Apostles hither also, with their persecu∣tion. Hereupon the Christians of this place (to cause these Persecutors to give over their pursuit), sent 
Paul
 towards the Sea-side, as if he meant to take ship, and to go quite away out of those parts: In the mean time some of them conducted him to 
Athens.
 But 
Silas
 and 
Timothy
 not being so much known or malic'd, as 
Paul
 was, stayed a little while longer, further to edifie the believers here.


Act.
 17. 
v.
 1. Now when they had passed thorow Amphipolis, and A∣pollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews.


v.
 2. And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures.


v.
 3. Opening and alledging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and ri∣s
n again from the dead: and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you, is Christ.


v.
 4. And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas: and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.


v
 5. But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lew
 fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.


v.
 6: And when they sound them not, they drew Jason, and certain bre∣thren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down, are come hither also.


v.
 7 Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying, T
t th
re is another King, one Jesus.


v.
 8. And they troubled the people, and the rulers of the City, when they heard these things.




v.
 9. And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.


v.
 10. And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews,


v.
 11. These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they re∣ceived the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.


v.
 12. Therefore many of them believed: also of honourable women, which were Greeks, and of men not a few.


v.
 13. But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledg that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.


v.
 14. And then imm
diately the brethren sent away Paul, to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.


v.
 15. And they that conducted Paul, brought him unto Athens, and recei∣ving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus, for to come to him with all speed, they departed.




























SECT. VI.


PAul
 being come to 
Athens,
 he sends for 
Silas
 and 
Timo∣thy
 speedily to come to him, foreseeing a need of more Labourers in that place
. In the mean time, he diligently views and observes their 
 their 
Temples, Idols
 and 
Al∣tars,
 and takes notice how that City was 
 more full of Idolatry than any o∣ther. At this, his Spirit was much stirred within him, a holy indignation being kind∣led in his breast, to see their horrible Idola∣try and Superstition. He therefore sets himself to reform this great evil. And first, he applies himself to the 
Jews,
 and 
re∣ligious proselytes
 there, teaching Christ in their Synagogue. Then in the Market-place, and such places of publick concourse, he took occasion to make known the Doctrine of Christ to such as he met with there. And some of the 
Philosophers,
 of the Sect of the 
Epicureans,
 and 
Stoicks,
 encountred him and dis∣puted with him; and some of them derided and slighted him, calling him 
Babler:
 Others said, he was a 
publisher
 and 
setter forth of strange Gods,
 because he preached 
Jesus,
 and the 
resur∣rection.
 Hereupon they brought him to 
Areopagus,
 the place of Judicature in 
Athens,
 and examined him more strictly, what 
new religion
 it was he taught; the temper of that people being very inquisitive after new things.


Paul
 being brought before the 
Judges
 in 
Areopagus
 spake to them, to this purpose, 
Ye men of Athens, I look upon you, as those which are generally given to the worship of more
 
gods or Daemons than other cities are.
 For as I passed up and down in your City, beholding your Altars and Images, I found an Altar with this Inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD: Whom ye profess to worship, and yet know not, him do I preach unto you, namely, The invisible God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, who cannot be con∣tained in any Shrine, or Temple of mans framing. Nor can any Image made by mans hands be a proper instrument to re∣present him; Neither does he need any of the Sacrifices, or Gifts that are offered to him by men, seeing he gives to all their very life, and all that they have. And of 
one man
 and 
woman, viz. Adam
 and 
Eve,
 hath he made the whole race of mankind, and hath ordained their time, and place, when, and where, they shall dwell on the face of the earth: And the end of all this is, That they might seek after Him, that crea∣ted them, and worship him sincerely. And though they were lest through their fall, and degeneracy from Him, as in the

 dark yet is this 
invisible God
 palpably to be discerned, and his glorious wisdom, power and goodness (manifest
d in his works of Creation and Providence), distinctly, and clearly to be known, if men would but seek and grope after him. And indeed we need not go out of our selves to find him, for he is very near every one of us. For our 
life, motion,
 and 
subsistence
 is wholly by him, and by his power, according to that which 
Aratus
 (a 
Poet
 of your own who hath written of the course of the Heavens) once delivered, saying, 
We are also his offspring,
 that is, we are descended from God by Creation. God therefore being our 
Creator,
 can in no rea∣son be supposed to be the work of our hands, as an Image of Gold, or Silver, or Stone is: And how irrational is it for man, the Image of God, to adore an Image, or work made by his own hands, which falls so short of representing the infinite, and invisible God, that it cannot represent the Spirit and Soul, the Reason and Understanding of man. And though God in his infinite patience hath long born with the world, thus lying in ignorance, and going on in such prodigious conceits, yet now he causeth his Gospel to be preached to all Nations, and thereby calls and invites them to repentance, and to forsake their Idols and sinful ways, which they ought seriously and speedily to do, because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judg the world in righteousness by his Son Jesus Christ, of which he hath given assurance by raising him from the dead. [
vid. Act.
 10.42.]


When 
Paul
 had mentioned the 
resurrection
 of the dead, some of those learned men (probably those of the Sect of the 
Epicureans
 who denyed all 
uture life) fell a scoffing; but some others of them desired to hear him again concerning those matters. So for the pres
nt he left them, having performed his part in sowing the good seed of the Gospel among them. And though we read not of any great success 
Pauls
 ministry had in this famous University, yet it pleased God to incline the hearts of some in this place to believe, and embrace his Doctrine, and to adhere to him. Among whom were 
Dionysius
 (one of the 
Areopagites,
 or 
Senators
 and 
Judges
 in 
Areopagus
), and a wo∣man call'd 
Damaris
 with some others.


Act.
 17. 
v.
 16. Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.


v.
 17. Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.


v.
 18. Then certain Philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountred him: and some said, What will this babl
r say? Other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.


v.
 19. And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know, what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?




v.
 20. For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.


v.
 21. (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there, spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing).


v.
 22. Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars-hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.


v.
 23. For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an Altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.


v.
 24. God that made the world, and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth, dwelleth not in Temples made with hands.


v.
 25. Neither is worshipped with mens hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things.


v.
 26. And hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation.


v.
 27. That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us.


v.
 28. For in him we live, and move, and have our being, as certain also of your own Poets have said, For we are also his off-spring.


v.
 29. for as much then as we are the off-spring of God, we ought not to think that the God-head is like unto gold, or silver, or stone graven by art, and mans device.


v.
 30. And the times of this ignorance God winked at, but now command∣eth all men every where to repent:


v.
 31. Because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judg the world in righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.


v.
 32. And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mock∣ed, and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.


v.
 33. So Paul departed from among them.


v.
 34. Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius, the Arcopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and o∣thers with them.




































SECT. VII.


SIlas
 and 
Timothy
 being now come to 
Paul
 from 
Beroea,
 He sends 
Timothy
 to the 
Thessalonians
 to confirm them in the Faith. For he bare a great love to them, and had a great de∣sire to have gone to them himself, but was hindred, 1 
Thes.
 2.18. 
& ch.
 3. 1, 2. Which journey 
Timothy
 performing and re∣turning again to him, e're he left 
Athens
 [1 
Thes.
 3.6, 7.] and bringing him good tydings of their perseverance in the faith and growth in grace, he sends 
him
 (together with 
Silas
) again in∣to 
Macedonia
 further to confirm the Churches there [
Act.
 18.5.] ordering them to come to him to 
Corinth,
 whither he was now going.






SECT. VIII.


PAul
 now leaving 
Athens
 comes to 
Co∣rinth
, where he found 
Aquila
 a Jew of the Province of 
Pontus
 in 
Asia
 and 
Priscilla
 his wife, who were come lately from 
Italy,
 because 
Claudius
 had by his decree banished all 
Jews
 from 
Rome.
 He being there in a strange place, and out of moneys, be∣takes himself to work with his own hands for his subsistence. It seems he had learn'd the 
trade of tent-making
 before he set him∣self to his studies, it being the Custom of the 
Jews
 to learn some trade
, yea, though they were to be Students. He had indeed power and warrant to challenge maintenance for his preaching, as he intimates many times in his Epistles. But there was not yet any Church at 
Corinth
 to maintain him; and be∣sides the 
Corinthians
 being ordinarily very 
covetous
, and 
greedy of gain,
 he would not take any thing of them, lest it should have hindred the success of his ministry. He therefore being of the same trade with 
Aqui∣la
 and 
Priscilla,
 he took up his lodging with them, and wrought at their trade. On the Sabbath-days he went into the Synagogue of the 
Jews,
 and reasoned and discoursed with them concerning the 
Messias
 promised to the Fathers, and endeavoured to perswade both

 
Jews
 and 
Proselytes
 to embrace his Doctrine. But when 
Silas
 and 
Timothy
 were come to him, and had brought him tydings of the great proficiency and growth of the 
Macedonian Churches,
 he was then pressed in Spirit, and grew more earnest, to bring on the 
Jews
 of 
Corinth
 to embrace the Gospel, and accordingly te∣stified to them that 
Jesus
 was 
the Christ,
 the 
true Messias
 whom they had so long expected. But they vehemently opposed him and railed at him and his Doctrine most contumeliously. Where∣upon he shook his Garments, and told them plainly, 
Their blood was upon their own heads
 (See 2 
Sam.
 1.16.) and that they were guilty of their own destruction [See 
Act.
 13.46, 51.]. And seeing they were so obstinate, he would now leave them, and with 
Silas
 and 
Timothy
 go preach to the 
Gentiles.
 And so go∣ing out of the Synagogue, he went into the house of one 
Ju∣sius,
 (by birth a 
Gentile,
 but a Jewish Proselyte) whose house, it's probable, he chose as a fit place to preach the Gospel in, to such as would be willing to heat him And his endeavours here were not without success. For 
Crispus
 the chief Ruler
 of the Synagogue, and his houshold were brought to believe, with several others, among whom were 
Gaius,
 and the houshold of 
Stephanas,
 whom He baptized, 1 
Cor.
 1.14, 16. But notwithstanding this good success, the Apostle (as it it seems) was now through human frailty possessed with some fear and apprehension of danger to his person from the 
Jews,
 and therefore had thoughts of going thence, and leaving the City. But whilst he was agitating these things in his mind, it pleased God to speak to him in a 
Vision by night,
 that he should fear nothing, for He would be present with him to secure him from all harm, and bad him go on confidently to preach the Gospel there, for he had 
much people in that City,
 whom he in∣tended effectually to call by his ministry. Hereupon he conti∣nued there 
a year and half,
 preaching the Gospel; and as we may gather from 2 
Cor.
 12.12. he wrought many miracles for Confirmation of his Doctrine, and converted many.


Act.
 18. 
v.
 1. After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth,


v.
 2. And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome) and came unto them.


v.
 3. And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought (for by their occupation they were tent-makers).


v.
 4. And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and perswaded the Jews and the Greeks.


v.
 5. And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in spirit, and testified to the Jews, that Jesus was Christ.


v.
 6. And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads, I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.


v.
 7. And he departed thence, and entred into a certain mans house, na∣med Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joyned hard to the synagogue,




v.
 8. And Crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord, with all his house: and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptized.


v.
 9. Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:


v.
 10. For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee, to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.


v.
 11. And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
















SECT. IX.


DUring his abode here, in his own name and in the names of 
Silas
 and 
Timothy
 he writes his First Epistle to the 
Thessalonians.


In which Epistle there are these 
two principal parts.




First,
 He endeavours to confirm them in the 
Faith
 of Christ, and to assure them of his sincere affection to them, and encourages them to constancy in the profession of the Gospel, notwithstanding the ma∣ny afflictions they met with, on that account, 
Chap.
 1.2, 3.


Secondly,
 He instructs and exhorts them to 
holiness
 of life and conversa∣tion, inserting a 
consolatory discourse
 touching the 
resurrection
 of the dead, 
Chap.
 4, 5.




IN the 
First part,
 (After his Apostolical Salutation to the Church of the 
Thessalonians,
 which by the Grace of God, and Gospel of Christ preached unto them, had been converted to the 
Faith,
 and which was established in the 
Faith
 and belief of God the Father
 and J
sus Christ, whom he hath sent), he declares,


1.
 H w th o
f
l he was to God for their sincere conversion, and how he daily m
d
 m
ntio
 f th
m in his prayers, humbly bes
eching the L
rd th
y might p
rse
re. And how j
yfully and continually he remembred 
that good work of th
ir s
ith,
 by which they so c
uragiously embraced the Gospel of Christ, 
that exc
lent ch
rity
 which they had t
stified by their care, and pains, and industry for the go
d 
f the Saints, 
that patience
 and 
constancy
 which their 
hope
 in C
ri
 
d w
ught in them; all which graces, as 
they
 had manifested (by their 
ff
) 
re men▪ so h
 doubted not, but they endeavoured to approve their h
ts to G
d
 in the exercise of th
m (as became good Children to their 
 F
th
r), in wh
se sight tho
e graces are highly pleasing, 
v. 2, 3.


2ly.
 He pr
f
ss
s his firm b
li
f 
f their 
Election,
 which was manifested to him by many cl
r signs th
re
f 
1.
 His 
ministry
 among th
m had been accompa∣ni
 with 
xtra
dinary and miracul
us gifts, and the powerful operation, and 
ff cacy of the H ly Ghost in their heartt, so that they were fully assur'd and per∣su
d of the truth of the Gospel which he had preached unto them. And they th
ms
lves might rem
mber what 
manner
 of entrance, 
he,
 and 
his fellow-labou∣rers
 in the G
sp
l had among them, in so much, that they not only embraced the Doctrine 
f Christ, but firm
y adhered to it, though attended with persecution, and that with demonstration of such a
 joy, which none but the H
ly Ghost could produce in th
m; by which things they rendred themselves in a sort like unto the Lord Christ, and like unto his servants the Apostles who suff
red for the truth, and preached the Gospel with joy in the midst of afflictions. 
2.
 Their 
exemplariness
 to the neighbour-Chur∣ches in 
Macedonia
 and 
Achai
.
 For the G
spel which he had preached am
ng them, was, by means of their 
tra∣fiquing
 people carried not only into the neighbour-Countreys, but into th
se that are far distant, so that th
ir conversion to God, and faith in Christ was so famous, and spread into so many pl
c
s of the world that 'twould be superfluous for him to say any thing more of it, the thing ne
ding no other testimony than it self. And fur∣ther

 he shews, that the 
faithful
 far and wide tell the history of the 
Thessalo∣nians
 conversion, and declare how the Apostles entrance among them was strangely and singularly blessed to the turning of them from 
dead idols
 to serve the true and everliving God, and to 
believe
 in his Son Jesus Christ, whom the 
Father
 hath raised from the dead, and to 
expect
 his second coming, (namely, to judg∣ment), at which time he will reward their faith and patience; having by the me∣rit of his death and passion delivered all that believe in him, f
m the 
wrath to come.
 From 
v. 4. to the end.


3dly.
 He sets before them the 
sincerity
 and 
uprightness
 of his ministry a∣mong 
 them, and the successfulness of it. For though he had been b
fore very ill used at 
Philippi
 for preaching Christ 
[Act. 16.],
 yet, (trusting in the assi∣stance of God), he boldly published the Gospel unto 
them,
 though he met with much contention and opposition from the 
still-necked Jews,
 and ignorant 
Gentiles.
 In the preaching of which, he had no design to seduce or corrupt any, by instilling any false doctrine into them, or to incourage them in any impure courses of life, (as the manner of false Teachers is); nor to procure to himself esteem, or any worldly advantage thereby. But as God was graciously pleased to chuse him to be an Apostle, and to approve him and think him meet for so great a trust; so he had endeavoured to approve his heart to God in the discharge of it, not accommodating his doctrine to the pleasing of mens humours, but preaching such things as are agreeable to the wil
 
f God, whose eye pierceth into the heart, and discovers the secretest intentio
 thereof. He sh
ws he never used to flatter them or soothe them in th
ir sins, 
 themselves could t
stifie, nor carried any covetous d
sign under a Cloak of piety, as God kn
w, to whom he could appeal. Neither was he ambitious of vain glory and esteem among men, as false-Teachers are wont to be. And where∣as he might have exercised severity, and authority
 among them as an Apostle of Christ, yet he had not done it, but had used such mildness and tenderness towards them as a nurse does to a little child whom she feeds and cheri∣shes. He was so affectionately desirous of their eternal welfare that he was not only willing to impart the Gospel to them, but to have laid down his very life for them if it had been necessary for the procuring their salvation. And as an evidence of his cordial affection to them and earnest desire of their good, they might remember that he had wrought with his own hands, not only in the day-time but sometimes part of the night, to get something to maintain him
, that he might not be chargeable to them. He appeals to 
them,
 who saw his outward actions, and to 
God
 who saw his heart, how 
holily, justly,
 and 
unbl
meably
 he had behaved himself among them. They could not but be sensible, that he had carried himself towards them as a 
Father
 towards his Children, exhorting them to do their duty, and comforting and encouraging them in the performance of it, and testifying unto th
m all that they ought to 
walk worthy of God,
 that is, as be∣comes those that know God and profess his name, who had called them by his grace to a participation of his kingdom and celestial glory. From 
v. 1. to 13.


4ly.
 He mentions (with great thankfulness to God) some other evidences of the divine favour towards these 
Thessalonians;
 As 
first,
 their receiving the Gospel
 not as the 
word of man,
 but as 
the word of God,
 which testifyed it self to be divine, by its efficacious operation in the hearts of believers. 
2.
 They shewed them∣selves like to the Christian Churches in Judea in patient suffering persecution from their own 
friends, kinsfolks,
 and 
fellow-citizens,
 as 
they
 did from the unbe∣lieving 
Jews;
 whom he d
scribes as the most perverse enemies of the Gospel of any other, setting out their wickedness in several particulars, declaring how, 
They kil∣led Christ, and before him, their own Prophets that were sent unto them
 [Math. 
23.31, 37.], and now they persecuted the Apostles; they shewed themselves adversaries to God in persecuting his servants; they were ene∣mies to mankind by endeavouring to obstruct the Gospel which brings sal∣vation

 to men.
 They forbad the Apostle to preach to the Gentiles; and so daily more and more filled up the measure of their sins, in so much, that the 
wrath of God seems come upon them to the uttermost
 in their judicial obduration. From 
v. 13. to 17.


5.
 He labours to assure them that he had a great love and affection to them, though he did not as yet come to them (as they might expect) to strengthen and comfort them in their afflictions. He tells them, he was not absent from them in heart and affection, though in body; and the more he was hindred from coming to them, the more earnestly he desired to see them. He designed to come to them once and a∣gain, but Satan still cast in impediments in his way. He tells them, he had great reason highly to value them, for he accounts them among the chi
fest Churches con∣verted to the faith by his ministry, and so he hopes they will be found, when Christ shall come to judg the world, and will be his 
crown
 and
 
joy
 at that day. From 
v. 17. to the end.


 
6.
 He goes on to give them further assurance of his love to them, and to esta∣blish them in the faith of Christ. 
1.
 He tells them that being no longer able to bear the vehement desire he had of hearing how things went with them, he had sent 
Ti∣mothy
 unto them, and was content to deprive himself of the company of a person very dear to him, and to stay at 
Athens
 alone, that they by him might be comfor∣ted and confirmed in the faith; and that n
ne of them might be troubled at the affli∣ctions which the profession of the gospel exposed them unto, as if some strange thing had happened to them. For they themselves could not be ignorant that this is the condition unto which all true believers are call'd, God having ordained that they should first partake of the sufferings of Christ, before th
y partake of his glory: and they had been hereof before advertised by him, when he was with them (that they might prepare for sufferings) and it hath accordingly so come to pass; so that now they know it by experience. Having therefore so great sollicitude in his mind for them, he could not any longer forbear the sending of 
Timothy
 to them, to know the state of their faith, and to know whether they continued constant in it, or whether the Devil and the world bringing persecutions upon them on that account had not caused them to warp under those trials, and so rendred all his labours among them fruitless. But when 
Timothy
 return'd and brought him the welcom news of the firmness and constancy of their faith, and of the continuance of their charity, and of their kind remembrance of him, and great desire to see him, this, he tells them, was matter of exceeding great joy unto him; and the testimony he heard of their faith, did more comfort him, than all the afflictions which he suffer'd did deject him. For now 
we live
 (says he), that is, are 
lively, chearful,
 and 
couragious,
 if ye stand fast in your faith in Christ. He tells them he knows not how to be sufficiently thankful to God for their perseverance, and for giving him occasion to rejoyce so sin∣cerely before him for their proficiency. He further acquaints them that he daily pray'd unto the Lord that he might see their faces again, and might be instrumental more perfectly to instruct them, and to increase the measure of their faith by opening to them more fully the mysteries of the gospel. He accordingly prays for a prosperous journey to them, and that the Lord would grant that they may increase, and abound in love one towards another, and towards all men, as he did towards them. And lastly that their hearts may be established in holiness, unblameable before God (who is our rec
nciled Father in Christ) and that continuing so, they at the coming of Christ with all his Saints and Angels to judgment may not be ashamed
. From 
v. 1. to the end.




He comes now to the second part of his Epistle which contains exhortations, and 
 precepts to duties of holiness. The doctrine concerning the 
Resurrection of the dead,
 and 
last judgment
 being by the way taken in.


In the 
First
 place, he tells them, He exhorts and intreats them in the name of the Lord Jesus, that as they had received of him how they ought to walk, and please God, so they would labour daily to excel and advance therein. They might remember what Commandments he had given them from Christ. Particularly, 
1.
 That they should pre∣serve themselves in Chastity, and purity from the sins 
f the flesh. For this was the 
will of God
 that they should be 
holy
 both in 
soul
 and 
body,
 and that they should abstain from 
fornication,
 and continually keep their bodies as 
vessels consecrated
 to the Lord, and not defile them; whereby they would distinguish themselves from the 
Gentiles,
 who know not God, but live in impure lusts. 
2.
 That they should not 
defraud
 any man; for God will avenge such kind of injuries as he had before assur'd, and warn'd them. And they should remember, that the end of Gods cal∣ling them to the Grace of Christ, is, that they should not defile themselves with any kind of sin
. And he that rejecteth these whole∣som exhortations, he shews is guilty of rejecting the divine authority 
f God, by the inspiration of whose holy Spirit, he had given them th
se precepts. 
3.
 Touching 
brotherly-love,
 and how it is to be exercised, he tells them, he need not write much; for he found they were eminently taught, and inclin'd by the Spirit of God to the exercise of that grace, and that they manifested it not only at home but towards the 
Brethren
 round about in 
Macedonia.
 And he desires they may daily more, and more increase and excel therein. 
4.
 He exhorts them to use their best en∣deavours
 to 
live quietly,
 and to follow their own bu∣siness 
[See 2 Thes. 3.12.],
 and to 
work with their own hands
 (as he had commanded them when he was with them), that by imploying themselves in honest labour, they may both preserve their reputation among the 
Gentiles
 (who will think ill of Christianity if it make men idle
, and that they may 
earn
 so much by their labour as may sup∣ply all their wants and necessities that they may have no need of help or relief from others. From 
v. 1. to 13.


2.
 He advises them not to mourn 
immoderately
 for their deceased Christian friends as 
Heathens
 do, that have no hope of a resurrection. He tells them he would not have them carry themselves as if they were ignorant of the happy state of those that dye in the faith of Christ. For as they believe, that Christ is risen from the dead, so they ought also to believe that those who have dyed in the faith of Christ, God will bring forth, and cause to appear with him, in the day wherein he shall judg the world, having first raised their bodies from the graves, and united them with their souls. And he tells them by revelation from the Lord, that the 
change
 of the 
faithful
 that are alive at his Coming shall not 
prevent
 the resurrection of those that are 
dead in Christ.
 For when Christ shall appear in that his great glory, and shall by the voice or trump of the Arch-Angel raise the dead, then the 
dead in Christ
 shall rise before the 
living
 be changed. And the 
faithful
 that are then alive being suddenly changed from mortality to an immortal glorious condition, shall be caught up together with the Saints that are raised from the dead, to meet the Lord in the air, and there being acquitted and absolved by the sentence of the Judg, shall enter into the kingdom pre∣pared for them, and so shall remain for ever with the Lord

 in endl
ss bl
ss. As for the 
wicked
 he says nothing of them, s
ing h
 had 
¦w
rd of Comfort for them. But as for the 
other
 he bids them 
comfort one ano∣th
r with these words,
 that is, draw matter of consolation to themselves against the l
ss of th
ir d
ce
s
d friends from the consideration of the resurrection, and the future 
y. 
From v. 13. to the end.


 
3dly.
 He tells th
m that if any among them did curi
sly inquire into the 
pre∣cise time
 of Chri
ts c
ming to judgment, it was to no purpos
 for him to write any thing about it, seeing it was not revealed
. How∣s
v
r this th
y could not be ignorant of, (having so often h
ard it from hims
lf and his associat
s) that Christ will c
me sudd
nly, and unexpectedly, as a 
thief in the night,
 and will surprize secure impenitent sinners 
unawares.
 But 
believers
 need not fear that day because th
y 
sleep
 n
t in the darkness of sin and ignorance; The last day c
n∣not as a thief in the night surprize them, because they are 
children of the light,
 and of the 
day,
 living and walking in the light of Gospel-truth, and in holin
ss 
f conversation. 
From v. 1. to 6.


4ly.
 Having thus spoken of the 
manner
 of Christs coming to judgment. He takes occasion from thence to exhort them to 
watchfulness
 and 
sobriety,
 that they may n
t f
ar b
ing surprized by that day. Let us not therefore (says he) live in car∣nal s
curity as 
infidels
 do, but be 
vigilant
 and 
sober;
 for they that sl
ep s
cure∣ly, or give themselves to drunkenness usually do it in the nig
t and darkn
ss, but such a course as this, would ill become us who are Christians, and the children of the day, and live in the light of the knowledg 
f Christ; we ought to be s
ber, and watchful remembring our life is a 
spiritual warfare,
 and therefore we ought al∣ways be upon our guard, having on a 
breast-plate
 compos'd of 
faith
 and 
charity
 to defend us against the assaults of 
Satan,
 and on our head 
the hope of salva∣tion
 for an 
Helmet.
 And this should further 
ncourage us in the doing of our duty, because God hath not appointed us to be 
vessels
 of his wrath, but hath c
l∣led us to the obtaining of salvation 
in
 and 
through his Son,
 who dyed for us, that whether we 
wake
 or 
sleep,
 that is, 
live
 or 
dye,
 we should live with him, namely, a 
spiritual life
 here, and hereafter an 
eternal life
 of glory. From the wh
le he exhorts them to comf
rt and build up one another in faith and holin
ss. 
From v. 6. to 12.


5ly.
 He comes n
 to direct the 
people
 how to carry themselves t
wards their 
Pastors
 and 
spiritu
 Guides,
 who labour among them, and faithful
y admonish and couns
l them (as their need requires) and are 
over them in the Lord,
 by vertue of his c mmission and authority in the things appertaining to their souls. He injoyns them to give th
m 
due respect
, thank∣fully to acknowledg their pains, and highly to esteem and love them on that account; and that they should live in peace and concord among themselves, and especially with their Pastors. 
V. 12.13.


6ly.
 He directs the 
Ministers
 how to carry themselves towards the 
People,
 nam
ly, that they should 
admonish
 th
se that are 
unruly,
 and w
lk dis
rderly, that they should 
comfort
 the 
feeble-minded,
 and such as are dejected under their afflictions, that they should 
bear
 with the 
weak
 and 
infirm in the saith,
 that they should be 
patient
 towards all. 
V. 14.


7ly.
 He gives now general directions to all. 
1.
 That they 
abstain from all private revenge,
 not rendring evil for evil, but ever following that which is good both among themselves, and t
wards th
se that are 
without. 2.
 To 
rejoyce evermore
 in the sense of Gods love to them 
in Christ,
 upon which account, they should be of good courage, and well content, even in the midst of all tribula∣tions. 
3ly.
 To 
pray without ceasing,
 that is, upon every occasion, in all their

 nec
ssities, and in every business, as the matter required, yet not so as never to 
in∣termit;
 but so, as not to give quite over, but to return to it again. 
4ly. In every thing to give thanks,
 in adversity, as well as prosperity. For so gracious is the will of God in Christ towards them, that they have reason so to do. 
5ly.
 To take heed of 
quenching
 
the gifts
 and 
graces of the Spirit
 in themselves, but to labour to stir them up by pray∣er, and the due exercise of them. 
6ly.
 That they con∣temn not, nor neglect those 
holy, publick exercises
 wherein the Ministers of the Gosp
l do interpret the Scrip∣tures by the singular revelation of the Spirit, and speak unto men to 
edification, exhortation
 and 
comfort [See 1 Cor. 14.3.]. 7ly.
 To 
prove all doctrines
 and 
opinions,
 and to examine them by the 
rule of the word,
 and 
analogy of faith,
 and to 
hold fast
 that which is good rejecting that which is otherwise. 
8ly.
 That they 
abstain from all sorts of evil,
 and the 
very appearance of it. From v. 15. to 23.


Lastly,
 He concludes his Epistle solemnly praying for them, that God who is the author of all true peace and comfort, would please to sanctifie them in every part, namely, that their 
Spirit
 [that is their intellectual part, their understanding and will], and their 
Soul,
 [that is, their affections and appetite], and their 
body,
 and 
outward man,
 may be kept immaculate, so that if it should so happen, that they should live to the Coming of Christ to judgment
, he may find them in this excellent condition at his Coming. He declares his confidence that he who hath called them to a participation of his grace, will carry on his own 
good work
 in them
; and having begun to sanctifie them, will continue to do it; for he is faithful, and 
his gifts
 and 
calling are without repentance. See 1 Cor. 1.8. Phil. 1.6.
 And so desiring their 
prayers
 for him, and injoyning them to 
salute
 one another, with the 
kiss
 of 
peace
 and 
charity
 (as believers were wont to do in those times, according to the custom of those countreys). He strictly charges them that this Epistle be read to the 
whole church,
 to 
all the holy Brethren
, and so shuts up all with his Apostolical benediction. 
From v. 23. to the end.








SECT. X.


PAul
 thus going on couragiously with his Ministry, the 
Jews
 were so horribly enraged at him, that they banded against him, and brought him before the Tribunal of 
Gallio
 the 
Pro∣consul
 of that Province, accusing him that he taught another way of worshipping God, than what the Law of the 
Jews
 pre∣scribed, and according to which the 
Romans
 had permitted them to live. But 
Gallio
 told them, if it were a matter that ap∣pertained to the civil government, it was but reason he should hear them, and do them justice; but seeing the Question betwixt them, was concerning things appertaining to their Religion, he would be no judg in such matters. The 
Jews,
 as it seems, were not satisfied with this answer, but press'd him again with vehe∣ment and somewhat uncivil importunity, that he would take some course with 
Paul; Gallio
 being offended at this their carriage, by his Officers drave them out of the Court. But they continuing yet to be troublesom and importunate, some of the Natives of 
Co∣rinth,
 fell upon 
Sosthenes
 (one of the Rulers of the 
Jewish
 Consistory, who probably was their Captain and Leader in this complaint against 
Paul
) and beat him in the place; the 
Pro-consul
 taking no notice of it, or reproving it.


Act.
 18. 
v.
 12. And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judg∣ment seat,


v,
 13. Saying, This fellow perswadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.


v.
 14. And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong, or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you.


v.
 15. But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it: for I will be no judg of such matters.


v.
 16. And he drave them from the judgment seat.


v.
 17. Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat: and Gallio cared for none of those things.
















SECT. XI.


ABout this time, as it seems, a certain 
Egyptian
 came into the Province of 
Judaea,
 who termed himself a 
Prophet,
 and gathered together Four thousand men, and brought them from the wilderness to the 
mount of Olives,
 and there told them, that by his command, they should see the walls of 
Jerusalem
 fall down, by which they might enter into the City.


But the insurrection of this 
Egyptian
 and his Complices com∣ing to 
Faelix
 the 
Roman
 Governours ears, he brake in upon them with his 
Roman
 Horse and Foot, and killing Four hun∣dred, he took Two hundred Prisoners, and dispersed the rest; but their Prophet and Leader escaping, it was not known what became of him.

Of this man 
Lysias
 the Captain spake, when he said to
 
Paul, Art not thou that Egyptian, who before these days, mad'st an up∣roar, and leddest out into the wilderness four hundred men, that were murderers.






SECT. XII.


PAul
 tarried a good while at 
Corinth
 after he had been brought before 
Gallio,
 and had came off so well. During which time 'tis probable, he wrote his Second Epistle to the 
Thessalonians.
 For having in his 
former
 expressed his longing desires to visit them [1 
Thes.
 3.10, 11.] and finding by the inter∣vention of other affairs, and perhaps of dangers, that he was still hindred, he hastened to send this Second Epistle to supply the want of his presence.




In which Epistle there are these parts.


1st.
 AFter his 
inscription
 and 
salutation
 (which are the same with that in 
 his former Epistle), He labours to comfort and strengthen these 
Thessa∣lonians,
 against those pers
cutions and afflictions, which he understood they were exposed to, for the profession of Christ and his Gospel.


The Arguments he uses, in order hereunto, are these; 
1.
 He shews the Con∣dition of their Church was very happy, because their 
faith
 did daily grow and in∣crease; and 
love
 did so much abound among them. 
2.
 Their 
faith
 and 
pa∣tience
 was so eminent that he gloried in them, and set them forth as a pattern to other Churches. 
3.
 The afflictions they so unjustly suffered from their unreasona∣ble Persecutors, were a manifest demonstration, that there will be a 
day of Judg∣ment,
 wherein God will give to every one according to their works. And He in his infinite wisdom sees it good to suffer them his servants, here to be sorely affli∣cted that they may be meet
 and fitly qualified accor∣ding to His order and constitution (who hath appointed that they should suffer with Christ, before they be glorifi∣ed with him), to enjoy the kingdom of Heaven, for the obtaining of which they suffered such hard things. And at the 
great day,
 He will manifest his righteous judgment in punishing their 
oppressors
 and 
persecutors,
 and will give them (together with the Apostles, and other Martyrs of Christ), 
rest
 and 
refreshment
 from all their trou∣bles and miseries. And this they may assuredly expect when Christ shall visibly come from heaven royally attended with all his glorious Angels, and shall in a terrible manner execute vengeance on all that regarded not to know God, nor to worship and serve him as they ought, and obstinately refused to entertain and obey the Gos∣pel of his Son. These shall be punished with everlasting perdition, when they shall appear before Christ the Judg, and shall see his glorious power
. And in that day wherein he shall thus pu∣nish his adversaries, he shall be highly glorifyed in the glory, which he shall impart to his Saints; the measure of which shall be so great, that it shall fill them with won∣der and admiration, they finding their expectation so much exceeded. And this he tells them, he spake for their comfort, because 
his testimony
 (that is, the Evan∣gelical doctrine he had preached) had found belief and entertainment among them. He further tells them, that he daily prayed for them, that the Lord would vouch∣safe to make them 
meet
 for that glory, to the participation of which he had so graciously called them 
(see Eph. 4.4.);
 and that he would accomplish all things which according to his good pleasure and bounty he had determined to do for them; and that he would powerfully compleat the grace of 
faith,
 which be himself had wrought in them; that the name of Christ may be glorifyed by them here, and they be glorified by him in that 
happy day,
 and all according to the riches of his free grace and mercy manifested in his Son. 
From 1. to the end.


 
2d.
 He rectifies a mistake which he understood they were in, concerning the 
day of Judgment,
 as if it were now 
at hand,
 and would happen presently in that age. He beseeches and obtests them, that as touching
 
Christs second coming,
 and the Saints gathering to∣gether from all quarters of the world, at that time, to meet him, [of which he had spoken in his former Epistle, 
Chap. 4. v. 15, 16, 17.
] they would not be soon shaken and dri∣ven from what
 he had taught them by any 
seducers
 whatsoever, who either by some pretended revelation from the 
spirit,
 or some 
speech
 of the Apostle (which they pretended they had heard, or from some passages in his former Epistle (which they mis-understood), endea∣voured

 to perswade them, that the 
day of judgment
 was at hand. He tells them there are several things which must 
pr
cede
 Christs 
second coming,
 which he will acquaint them with, that they may not be deceived. 
1.
 A great and general 
Apostacy
 from the faith 
[see 1 Tim. 4.1.]. 2.
 The revelation of the 
great
 and 
chief Antichrist,
 whom he characteri∣zeth after this manner, calling him the 
man of sin,
 the 
son of perdition,
 one who 
opposeth
 and 
exalteth him∣self above Christ,
 (who is very God), in all his offi∣ces, 
Regal, Sacerdotal,
 and 
Prophetical,
 yea exalteth himself above every thing that is 
worshipped,
 that is, above 
magistrates
 [who in Scripture are called 
Gods, Psal. 82.6.
], and are 
 
August,
 or 
illustrious.
 Yea, who exalteth himself above 
all that is cal∣led God;
 one way or other [that is, above 
all powers
 whatsoever], arroga∣ting such things to himself, as only belong unto 
God,
 and thereby endeavouring (as it were) to d
clare that he is 
God.
 He sits and rules in the 
Temple
 of God, that is, among the 
people that bear the name of Christ,
 the visible external Christian Church, (the society that profess themselves the 
Temple
 of God), he tells them, he 
fits
 and 
rules,
 and exalts himself, as if he were 
God,
 uncon∣troulably, antiquating, or dispensing even with the laws of God himself. All which things they might remember he had acquainted them with before. He comes there∣fore now to shew them what it was that 
with-held,
 and 
hindred,
 and stayed his 
revealing
 and manifesting of himself for the present, so that he could not pub∣lickly appear as yet, nor should before that time and season, which the divine pro∣vidence had appointed. That which hindred (as it seems) was the 
entireness of the Roman Empire,
 which (probably) he had hinted to them before, but mentions not here (possibly) that he might not provoke the present 
Roman
 power against the Christians, who promised themselves that their Empire should never have an end. And if any should enquire whether 
Antichrist
 was not yet in the world, he answers, the 
mystery of iniquity
 was even now working, that is, there was something now working in the world, that was a 
type
 and 
figure
 of 
that
 which should shew it self more plainly in the great 
Antichrist, viz.
 the 
spirit of conten∣tion
 for rule and priority
. This bore some similitude with the 
spirit
 of the 
great Antichrist,
 who should appear in his season. But this 
Antichristian
 heat of ambition must play at lesser game, till the 
 the 
Roman Emperor
 be removed, who possess'd 
Rome,
 which was to be the 
Seat
 of 
Antichrist;
 which 
Seat
 being once void, 
Antichrist
 would enter, and discover himself, and advance himself above all 
laws,
 both divine and humane
. So that this 
man of Sin
 is to be understood of 
one
 that is to appear after the 
breaking of the Roman Empire
 in pieces
. The Apostle further shews, that Jesus Christ our Saviour shall destroy this 
Antichrist
 by the 
sword of his mouth,
 that is, by the preaching of his Gospel, and the power of his spirit concurring therewith, and by the 
brightness of his coming,
 that is, by clear and convictive reasons and arguments divulged by such, as shall speak by the spirit of Christ. He further declares that the 
coming
 of 
this Antichrist,
 his 
raising,
 and 
first advancement
 to his kingdom, will be with 
such kind of working,
 as Satan is wont to use to seduce men, name∣ly, with the power of 
signs,
 and 
wonders,
 and 
diaboli∣cal illusions,
 which Satan will produce to confirm the do∣minion, and false doctrine of 
Antichrist;
 and which are beyond 
humane,
 but not 
Angelical
 power; and with all unjust and fraudulent dealing and deceit, with all arts and tricks of cosenage, that the Devil himself can invent, which will take place and prevail in such whom God (because they received not the truth in the love of it, but had pleasure in unrigh∣teousness) will 
judicially
 give over to strong delusions, to their perdition and dam∣nation. 
From v. 1. to 13.




3dly.
 Having uttered this sad prophesie; lest the 
Thessalonians
 should be startled at it, he tells them 
they
 need not fear seduction by this 
Antichristian spirit,
 because God had chosen them to salvation 
through sanctification of his spi∣rit, and belief of the truth,
 having effectually called them by the Gospel, which he had preached unto them, that they might obtain the glory purchased by Christ. Wherefore he exhorts them to 
constancy
 in the faith, and to maintain the 
tradi∣tions,
 instructions, and doctrines delivered to them by him, and which they had received either by his 
preaching
 or 
writing.


Lastly,
 he earnestly prays for them, that Jesus Christ 
our Lord,
 and God our 
gracious father
 in him, (who hath given all true believers solid grounds of perpetual comfort, and good hope of eternal life through his free grace
), would comfort their hearts in all their afflictions, and strengthen them unto every good 
word
 and 
work
, that is, that they might so 
speak
 and so 
act
 as may be most pleasing, and acceptable in his sight. 
From v. 13. to the end.


 
4ly.
 In the close of his Epistle, he exhorts them to pray earnestly, that the Gospel may have a 
free course
 and be glorified by the 
conversion
 of the uncon∣verted, and by the 
edification
 and further improvement of those that are effectu∣ally called, as it was among them; and that himself and other preachers of it might be delivered from 
unreasonable
 and 
absurd
 men, who perversly opposed it. And of that sort of men, he tells them, there be too too many in the world, among whom the Gospel will not be entertained, nor meet with 
faith
 and 
obedience.
 However as to them, he de∣clares his confidence, that God who hath effectually called them, and who is constant and faithful in promoting his own work, will establish them in 
faith
 and 
holiness,
 and will defend them against the evils, dangers, and tempta∣tions of Satan and his instruments; and that which further encouraged him to hope it, was their ready obedience to his injunctions. He prays that the Lord would by his Spirit 
direct
 and 
incline
 their hearts to express that ardent love to 
him∣self
, which they of duty owe him, and to an imitation of the 
patience
 of Christ
. 
From v. 1. to 6.


5ly.
 He prescribes the practice of 
Church-discipline,
 towards such as walk 
disorderly
 among them, and not according to the 
rule
 and 
doctrine
 by him de∣livered. He forbids them all 
familiar
 converse with such that they may be 
asha∣med,
 and (reflecting upon their evil courses) may 
repent
 and 
reform.
 By the 
disorderly,
 he means, such as liv'd idly, and were busy-bodies
 in other mens matters; which kind of course, he shews, was very contrary to his practise among them, who did not eat any mans bread 
gratis,
 but wrought with his own hands
 in the day time, and sometimes part of the night, at his trade of 
Tent-making [see Act. 18.3.],
 that he might not be chargeable to any of them, though he had power to have challenged mainte∣nance for his preaching the Gospel among them, as other Apostles did 
[see 1 Cor. 9.3, &c.].
 But he had departed from his right, and had done 
that
 to which he was not bound, to incite them by his own example to labour, each one in his Calling very diligently. For this he injoyned them, when he was with them, that if any lived idly, and would not 
work,
 [having health, strength, and opportunity for it], they should not 
eat,
 namely be relieved by the 
Charity of the Church,
 who are only to take care of those that are indigent and necessitous. He there∣fore

 exhorts the 
disorderly,
 and commands them in the name of Christ to 
reform,
 and to live peaceably upon the fruit of their own labour. As for those of them that were free from these misdemeanors, he exhorts them to go on constantly in their duty, and not to be weary of doing that which is good. And if any 
disorderly
 persons among them would not obey these admonitions, given in this Epistle, he in∣joyns, that they should be 
noted
 as persons not fit to be conversed familiarly with, that so (entring into a consideration of their evil ways) they may be brought to repentance. Yet he tells them, they must dispense this severity with 
wisdom,
 not reckoning these offenders as enemies
, (as of whose repentance and reforma∣tion they despaired), but as long as they made profession of the Christian Religion, they should consider them as 
lapsed brethren,
 and accordingly exhort and admonish them as those they desired and endeavoured to reduce and reform. 
From v. 6. to 16.


He shuts up the Epistle praying for them, that God, who is the 
author of peace,
 would give them peace, at 
all times
 and 
in all places (f),
 and 
every manner of way,
 namely with himself and with one another.


The Conclusion of the Epistle (wherein he salutes them), he wrote with his own hand, that they might discern it from any counterfeit, that might be carried about in his name. 
Vers. 17.18.








SECT. XIII.


THE Apostle having continued a year and half at 
Corinth,
 and fairly planted a Church there (though it were mise∣rably degenerated soon after) he now determines to sail to 
Ephesus; Aquila
 and 
Priscilla
 resolving to accompany him: And having taken his leave of the Brethren there; at 
Cenchrea
 a Haven on the East side of that City, 
he sha∣ved his head
. The reason of which, pro∣bably was this: He had (it seems) before ta∣ken upon him, for some time, the Vow of the 
Nazarites,
 whereby he was obliged to ab∣stain 
from wine,
 and 
shearing his head,
 and 
tou∣ching of the dead.
 But having now accomplish'd his Vow, he shore his head, and returned to the common way of living, according as was prescribed, 
Numb.
 6.18, 19, 20. The reason of this Vow we may gather from 1 
Cor.
 9.20. namely, in things indifferent he was willing to comply with the weak 
Jews;
 to shew, that he was no con∣temner of the Law: And for the same reason he caused 
Timothy
 to be circumcised; and for the same reason, purified himself in the Temple at 
Jerusalem, Act.
 21.23, 24.


The Apostle being now come to 
Ephesus,
 he taught in the Synagogue of the 
Jews;
 but thought not fit (though desired) to stay long there then, being prompted (as it seems) by some secret instinct of the Spirit, now to go up to the approaching 
Feast
 at 
Jerusalem;
 not that he now took himself obliged to observe the 
Feasts,
 or 
antiquated Ceremonies
 of the Law, (see 
Gal.
 4.10. 
Col.
 2.16. 
Rom.
 14.5.) but he was willing to go to this 
Feast,
 that he might in that 
great solemnity
 and con∣course of people, have more advantage to spread the Gospel among the 
Jews.
 Leaving therefore 
Aquila
 and 
Priscilla
 at 
E∣phesus,
 he sailed thence to 
Caesarea,
 and thence went up to 
Je∣rusalem;
 where it seems he stayed not long, finding possibly not such success of his endeavours as he expected and hoped for. Whereupon he hastened from thence and went down to 
Anti∣och
 in 
Syria,
 where he stayed for some time.


Act.
 18. 
v.
 18. And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila: having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.


v.
 19. And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself en∣tred into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.


v.
 20. When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consen∣ted not:


v.
 21. But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh, in J
rusalem; but I will return again unto you, if God will: and he sailed from Ephesus.


v.
 22. And when he had landed at Cesarea, and gone up, and saluted the Church, he went down to Antioch.










CHAP. VI.
 Containing 
Paul
's Fourth Journey, which he began from 
Antioch
 in 
Syria;
 which we call 
Iter Ephesinum,
 His 
Ephesine
 Journey.




SECT. I.


PAul
 having spent some time at 
Antioch,
 he departed thence; and went thorough 
Galatia,
 and 
Phrygia,
 and travelling from place to place, as he went along, he visited and confirmed the Disciples in those parts. When he came among the 
Gala∣tians,
 he was received by them with all imaginable joy and gladness, they being not only not offended at the tribulation which was outwardly brought upon him, but they gladly and kindly received him as if he had been an Angel of God, nay even as the Lord Jesus himself, 
Gal.
 4.14. Among other things which he now injoyneth them, he appointeth that they should make collections, and set apart their Charity for the poor eve∣ry Lords day, 1 
Cor.
 16.1, 2.


Act.
 18. 
v.
 22. And when he had landed at Cesarea, and gone up, and sa∣luted the Church, he went down to Antioch.


v.
 23. And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the countrey of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.






SECT. II.


IN the mean time, whilst the Apostle is thus confirming the Churches formerly planted in 
Galatia
 and 
Phrygia
 (see 
Chap.
 16.6.), a certain man born of 
Jewish
 Parents at 
Alexandria
 in 
Egypt
 by nam
 
Apollos,
 being a 
judicious, learned
 and 
elo∣quent
 man, and 
mighty
 in the Scriptures, and something instru∣cted in the 
way of the Lord,
 that is, the Doctrine of the Gospel (though as yet but imperfectly), came to 
Ephesus,
 and being of great zeal and fervency o
 spirit, he taught boldly in the

 
Jewish
 Synagogues, the Doctrine of the Gospel according to his knowledg: for he knew only so much of it, as 
John Baptist
 had taught his Disciples, and confirmed and sealed with Baptism, by which the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost were not im∣parted, as they were to many by the Baptism of the Apostles 
Act.
 8.15, 16, 17. And possibly he had been in 
Judaea
 in 
John Baptists
 time, and so either was baptized by him, or else by some of his Disciples, who were now dispersed abroad. 
Aquila
 and 
Priscilla
 hearing him preach, and perceiving that he wanted something of that knowledg, that they had attained to, they took him home to them, and in private conference informed him more 
fully
 and 
clearly
 concerning Christ and the Gospel; shewing him what Christ had done and suffered to save sinners, and what was required of those that shall be saved by him. 
Apollos
 being thus more full
 instructed in the Doctrine of the Gospel desires to travel into 
Achaia (viz.
 to 
Corinth,
 the chief City thereof), that he might preach the Gospel there. The Brethren therefore at 
Ephesus,
 incouraging him in this design, and accompanying him with their Letters Testimonial to the Bre∣thren at 
Corinth;
 when he was come thither, he 
watered what Paul had before planted
 [1 
Cor.
 3.6.]; and much confirmed the Disciples in that place; and mightily convinced the 
Jews
 (who were his great opposers), that 
Jesus
 was the 
true
 and only 
Messias
 promised to the Fathers.


Act.
 18. 
v.
 24. And a certain Jew, named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.


v.
 25. This man was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, know∣ing only the b
pti
m of John.


v.
 26. And he b
gan to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of G d more perfectly.


v.
 27. And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, ex∣horting the di
cipl
s to receive him: who when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace.


v.
 28. For he mightily convinc
d the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures, that Jesus was Christ.










SECT. III.


VVHil'st 
Apollos
 was thus imployed at 
Corinth, Paul
 ha∣ving visited the Churches in 
Phrygia
 and 
Galatia,


 came to 
Ephesus
, (according to his pro∣mise made to them, 
chap.
 18. 
v.
 21.), and there he found 
Twelve Disciples,
 no further instructed in Christianity than the Doctrine by 
John;
 having received Baptism from him, or some of his Disciples scattered abroad, as was the case of 
Apollos
 before mentioned. 
Paul
 asks them whether they had received the Ho∣ly Ghost? They answer, they had not so much as heard 
whe∣ther there were any Holy Ghost;
 that is, that there were now any miraculous Gifts imparted by the Holy Ghost. In which words, they seem to speak after the common Tenet of the 
Jewish
 Na∣tion, which was, That after the death of 
Ezra, Haggai, Zachary,
 and 
Malachi
 the 
Holy Ghost
 departed from 
Israel;
 and they pro∣fess they never heard of his being a new given, with his mira∣culous Gifts. He asks them then, 
Ʋnto what were ye baptized?
 they say, 
unto Johns baptism;
 that is, into the Doctrine which 
John
 taught, and sealed by Baptism; which being published to them, and by them own'd and profess'd, they were baptized; by which Baptism, the extraordinary Gifts of the Holy Ghost were not given or imparted to any. To this 
Paul
 replies, that the ministry of 
John
 was not to gather Disciples to himself; but he exhorted his hearers to repent and 
believe in him that was shortly to appear and manifest himself, viz.
 in Christ Jesus, and to expect remission of sins only by Him. Which 
they,
 to wit 
Johns hearers, understanding and consenting unto,
 they were baptized by him in the Name of the Lord Jesus.


Paul
 having thus instructed them concerning the true tenden∣cy of 
Johns
 Baptism, and how it pointed to Christ, he laid his hands on them, and the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghost were immediately conferred on them. And they spake divers Tongues, which before they understood not, and were indued with the Gift of prophesying, that is, of declaring things to come and interpreting the writings of the Prophets, that they might be fit Teachers of others.


Act.
 19.1. And it came to pass, that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul ha∣ving passed thorow the upper coasts, came to Ephesus, and finding cer∣tain disciples,


v.
 2. He said unto them, Have ye received the holy Ghost since ye belie∣ved? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any holy Ghost.


v.
 3. And he said unto them; Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto Johns baptism.


v.
 4. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the p
ople, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.


v.
 5. When they heard this, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus.


v.
 6. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the holy Ghost came on them, and they sp
ke with tongues, and prophesied.


v.
 7. And all the men were about twelve.












SECT. IV.


THE Apostle after this private instruction of these Twelve Disciples, having a long time to stay at 
Ephesus,
 for the first three months he preached the Gospel in the Synagogue of the 
Jews,
 labouring to convince them; but when instead of be∣ing convinced, he saw them remain obdurate and refractory, and not only not to embrace the Gospel, but to oppose it, and speak contumeliously of it, and vehemently to contend with him for preaching of it (which as some conceive he calls, 
his fighting with beasts
 
at Ephesus,
 1 
Cor.
 15. 
v.
 32.), he left them, and separated the Christians of that place from them, whom with o∣thers that came to hear him he daily instructed in a certain place, called the
 
School of Tyrannus;
 and this he did for the space of two years: so that the sweet savour, and report of the Gos∣pel was spread abroad thorow all 
Asia, properly so called
 (namely, which lyes a∣bout 
Ephesus
), both among 
Jews
 and 
Gen∣tiles
 [1 
Cor.
 16.9.]. And it pleased the Lord greatly to confirm the Doctrine of the Gospel here preached by the Apostle, by en∣abling him to work many Miracles
 in this place. For he did not only cure those that came to him, but by 
his touching linnen clothes
 and sending them to those that were sick, or possessed with Devils, they were thereupon immediately cured. Some 
Jewish
 exorcists
, the Sons of
 
Sceva,
 who went about preten∣ding to cure diseases, and cast out Devils; seeing what great miracles 
Paul
 wrought in 
the Name of Jesus,
 they likewise attempt∣ed to cast out a Devil out of a man possessed, by using 
the same name,
 though in 
Jesus
 they believed not. But the Devil would not o∣bey them
, as not having any authority from Jesus as 
Paul
 had, though they us'd his Name: Nay, he was so far from obeying them, that he made the 
man
 that was possessed, fall violently on them, and tear off their Clothes

 and wound them; so that they were forced to run away. Which thing being once noised abroad, 
fear
 fell both upon 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles,
 and many were hereby brought to believe in Christ. And several that were thus wrought upon, came to the Apostles, and acquainted them with the actions and courses of their for∣mer lives, and desired advice and counsel from him. And many that had practised 
magick
 and 
sorcery,
 & such like wicked Arts, brought out, & publickly burnt their 
conjuring Books,
 though they were of very high value and price in that City, so much given to Magick; and if estimated by what they might have been there sold for, the price would amount to about a Thousand five hundred pounds of our money. So mightily the Gospel prevail'd upon the A∣postles preaching.


Act.
 19. 
v.
 8. And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and perswading the things concerning the kingdom of God.


v.
 9. But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the dis∣ciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.


v.
 10. And this continued by the space of two years, so that all they which dwelt in Asia, heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.


v.
 11. And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul,


v.
 12. So that from his body were brought unto the sick, handkerchiefs, or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.


v.
 13. Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits, the Name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.


v.
 14. And there were seven sons of one Sceva a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.


v.
 15. And the evil spirit answered, and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?


v.
 16. And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leapt on them, and over∣came them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked, and wounded.


v.
 17. And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus, and fear fell on them all, and the Name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.


v.
 18. And many that believed, came, and confessed, and shewed their d
s.


v.
 19. Many also of them which used curious arts, brought their books to∣gether, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of th
m, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.


v.
 20. So mightily grew the word of God, and prevailed.














SECT. V.


VVHilst the Apostle is thus imployed, he understands, that since his departure from the 
Galatians,
 some 
cor∣rupt
 and 
false
 teachers coming from 
Judaea,
 had crept in among them, who professing Christ in outward shew, taught, that the observation of the 
Mosaical
 institutions ought to be joined with Faith in Christ as necessary to Salvation: These false Teachers had infected most, if not all the Churches in that region with their erroneous Doctrine, And they, it seems, pretended to be sent thither by those three eminent Apostles 
Peter, James,
 and 
John,
 and that they taught nothing but what was agreeable to their minds. These Apostles they highly magnified, as having seen Christ in the flesh, but vilified 
Paul,
 not allowing him the 
name
 or 
right
 of an Apostle, nor granting that he was ever cal∣led by Christ, or owned for an Apostle by the other Apostles. Hereupon 
Paul
 thought it necessary to write an Epistle to the 
Galatians;
 wherein his scope is to convince them of their er∣rors, to reduce them to the right way again, and to instruct them in the duties of a holy life.




In which Epistle there are these three parts,




1. The 
Preface.


2. The 
Body of the Epistle.


3. The 
Conclusion.




IN the 
Preface
 he declares, he was a 
true Apostle,
 not call'd or commissi
na∣ted 
 by any meer man, but by 
Jesus Christ,
 after he was raised from the dead, and had ascended into Heaven: And his calling was so much the more excellent, be∣cause Christ, who called him, was then invested with greater and more excellent glory, than when he was upon the Earth. And he was called also by 
the will of God the Father
, who raised Jesus Christ his Son from the dead, and gave all power unto him for the governing of his Church.


And that he might make this his admonition and address to the Churches of 
Ga∣latia
 more effectual, he joins all the rest of the faithful Brethren that were with him in it, wishing unto them in his 
own
 and 
their names
 abundance of 
grace
 and 
peace
 from God the 
Father
 (the Fountain of all blessings), and from Je∣sus Christ the 
Mediator
 (who is the Conduit pipe by whom they are conveyed); which Jesus, he shews, gave himself unto death for the 
expiation
 of our sins, and to redeem us and recover us out of that sinful and miserable state wherein the world lies, according to the gracious appointment of God the Father, who is worthy to receive all honour and glory from us, for so inestimable a benefit thorow all eter∣nity. 
From Verse 1. to 6.


He now c
mes to the 
Body
 of his Epistle, wherein we may observe these parti∣culars.


1. He sharply reprehends these 
Galatians,
 that they had so soon forsaken God who ha
 
ad
d them t
 a participation of the grace of Christ [to save them by his 
race 
 the w
rks of the Law] and had embraced a new strange Doctrine 
 Gospel f
gn
d by men. He tells them, that there was no other Gospel than that true Gospel of Christ which he had preached among them. Only there were some seducers, who had crept in among them, who disturbed their peace, and quite perverted and changed the Doctrine he had preached to them, mingling the righteousness of 
works
 with the righteousness of 
faith,
 and maintaining, that 
justification
 is n
t by 
faith
 only, but also by the observation of the 
Mo∣saical rites,
 and the works of the 
Law.
 He tells them, that he had taught the Gospel of Christ so sincerely and so certainly, that whosoever should teach them 
ano∣ther Gospel
 not agreeing thereto, whether he were 
Angel
 or 
Man,
 they ought 
 hold him as a person deserving to be abhorr'd hath of God and all good m
n. And that he might shew them, he spake it not from any perturbation of mind, but deliberately, he repeats it again, to fasten it the more upon their minds. 
From Verse 6. to 10.


2. He endeavours to convince them of their 
great error
 in forsaking the Gos∣pel preached unto them by him, and undervaluing his Apostleship, shewing them. 
1.
 The 
integrity
 he had used in his Ministry. For he did not perswade that 
men
 but that God should be heard and obeyed, that so their saith might be founded on 
divine
 authority, and n
t 
n 
humane,
 nor did he aim at pleasing men but Christ Jesus. For should he now study to please men, as he did in times past, when he was a 
Pharisee
 (when to please the 
high Priest
 and 
Jews
 he persecuted the Church), he could not be a faithful servant of Christ, but might justly be reckon∣ed the servant of those whom he endeavoured to please. 
2.
 He sets before them the 
divinity
 of his Doctrine, which he assures them was not given him, or taught

 him by 
man,
 nor did he receive it at the second hand, only by 
tradition;
 but it was immediately revealed to him by Jesus Christ. And that they might the more readily be perswaded hereof, he tells them, that they cannot but have heard of his former enmity and h
stility against the Gospel and Church of Christ before his con∣version
, and how he had attained to a great measure of knowledg in that re∣ligion which he then p
s ssed; and had ability to defend it beyond many of those that were equal in a
 with him; and how he was as strict a maintainer of the 
Jewish
 cust
m
s, and of the 
unwritten traditions
 of the Fathers (which they super∣added to the 
Law
), as an
 man what ever.


Now they could 
, 
n imagine, that so great a change could be wrought in him by any 
dinary m
ans, but must needs be from God, who (acc
rding to the rich
s and 
 
s his 
ace), having determined even from his infancy to set him 
art f
r his 
 service, in his due time actually and effectually called him, and illumi
d his mind with th saving knowledg of his Son, appointed
 that he should 
r
ch him and make him known to the 
Gentiles.
 He shews, that being thus miraculously call
d and commissionated to preach the Gospel, he immediately set about it, not consulting with any man living whether he were rightly in
tructed in the Gospel, or wh
ther he had power sufficient to preach it. Neither went he up to 
J
rusalem
 to consult 
Peter,
 or 
James,
 or any of the 
twelve,
 that were in∣stated in that 
ff
 bef
 him, but went presently from 
Damascus
 into 
Arabia,
 and there preached the G
sp
l for 
three years,
 and so return'd to 
Damascus
 a∣gain. After th
 h
 w
nt up to 
Jerusalem
 to 
see
 and 
visit Peter
, but he ab
d
 with him only 
 days, and besides him, he saw no other of the Apostles there, save only 
, Chri
 
insman,
 the rest (probably) being gone out to preach the Gospel abroad. N was t
 the truth of what he here delivered, (it being a matter of gr
at import 
 and 
 which the success of his Ministry much depen∣ded, that these things sh
ul
 
 
lieved concerning him), he solemnly 
calls God to witn
ss,
 confirming it by a
th. After this (he tells them) he preached in 
Syria
 and 
Cilicia,
 with the approbation of the Apostles and Churches of 
Judea,
 that received 
nd, 
 the Christian faith, who knew him not so much as by f
ce, (so far was he 
 being in
tructed by them), but hearing of him, and be∣ing certified of his wand
ful conversion, and how he was turned from being 
 
p
r∣secutor
 to be a 
preacher
 of the Gospel, they glorified God for his grace s
 extra∣ordinarily manifested towards him. 
From Ver. 10. to the end.


 
3.
 He farther sh
ws them, that fourteen years after, being m
ved by an extra∣ordinary ins
, and command from God, he went up to 
Jerusalem
 again with 
Barnab
s
 and 
Titus,
 and there did particularly
 acquaint them st
eminent of the Apostles with the Doctrine which he had pr
ached among the 
Gentiles,
 that by their consenting unto it, as 
the fame
 which th
y themselves did preach, his 
by∣past
 and 
future
 labours might have the more success; which otherwise (as it seems) were in danger to be hindred and fru
trated by the Calumnies of his ad∣versaries, who affirmed, that the Apostles at 
Jerusalem
 did not approve of the Do∣ctrine which he preached. Therefore as a testimony of their agreement with him, (he tells them) the other Ap
stles did clearly j
in with him, in the point contro∣verted between him and his adversaries, judging 
Circumcision
 t
 be a thing 
not necessary
 to salvation, else they would have required 
Titus
 (who came with him, and was born of 
Gentile
 Parents) to be circumcised, which 
t they did not. And the reason why they did it not, he shews, was, because s
m
 
 
brethren
 that 
 gr
at urgers 
f the necessity of 
Circumcision,
 and the other 
Levitical
 ordin
nc
s (and were brought in to be members of the Church of 
Jerusalem
 by fr
ud, and h
 reason of their large pretences t
 piety), had secretly convey
d them∣s
l
s that m
ting which he had with the other Apostles, and that pur
s
ly to see
t
h th
 he would, before them, stand to, and defend that 
liberty
 and 
free∣dom
 
 the Ceremonial Law, which he had preached among the 
Gentiles,
 as a part of Chri
 purchase. If he had 
d ne it, they w
uld have triumph
d ver him as 
 it had 
eanted bef
re the Ap
stl s, what he had before others affirm
, and

 so would have endeavoured, to bring back the 
Christian Gentiles
 and the 
whole Church
 to the bondage of the Ceremonial Law. And hence it was, that neither he nor the other Apostles would yield to the importunate desire of these 
false Brethren,
 no not for an 
hour,
 (that is, so far as to use 
Circumcision,
 that one time), and that because this had been to subject the Apostles and the 
truth
 to their adversa∣ries, and so the purity of the Gospel Doctrine would not have been maintained a∣mong the Churches of Christ, and particularly not among the 
Galatians.
 And as a further evidence, that his 
calling
 and 
office
 were from God, he shews them, that at 
that meeting
 which he had with those Apostles, who were looked upon as the 
chief
st,
 viz. 
Peter, James,
 and 
John,
 and which his adversaries boasted of as his Superiors, when they had heard his Doctrine, they corrected nothing in it, nor added any thing to the knowledg he had before. And for their 
personal priviledg s, viz.
 that they had 
seen Christ in the flesh,
 and were Apostles be∣fore him even when he was a Persecutor, 
&c.
 these things he took no notice of, because G
d regards no man for external things, by which they are outwardly va∣lu
 or esteemed among men; and can make use of the meanest as well as the most excellent instruments in his service. But on the other side, when those same Apo∣stles who were deservedly reputed 
pillars
 of the Church (as being under God great upholders of it by their gifts, dilligence, and fidelity) had by certain evidences found, that the 
Apostolick
 office to preach to the uncircumcised 
Gentiles
 was committed to him, as the 
Apostolick
 office to preach to the 
Jews
 was committed to 
Peter,
 and that the like assistance, blessing, and success did accompany the la∣bours of the one as well as of the other; these 
three Apostles
 (perceiving the grace and gifts, both ordinary and extraordinary which were bestowed upon him, fitting him for the 
Apostolick
 office), they did, without much more ad
, acknow∣ledg him and 
Barnabas
 for their 
Collegues
 or 
fellow-Apostles,
 giving them the 
right hand,
 in testimony thereof. And as a token of their mutual agreement in dividing their Charge, they consented that 
Paul
 and 
Barnabas
 should go to the 
Gentiles,
 and that 
they three
 would go to the 
Jews
. And as a further testimony of their agreement, these 
three Apostles
 did earnestly recommend to 
Paul
 and 
Barnabas
 the collecting of some charitable contribution among the Chur¦ches 
f the G
ntiles
, for the supply of the p
or Christian 
Jews
, which they very readily agre
d to, and diligently performed, as we may see, 
2 Cor. ch. 8. & ch. 9. L
t y,
 to evidence yet further the 
divine authority
 of his office unt
 them, and that he was n
t inferiour to the other Apostles, he tells them, that as an Apostle 
f Chri
t, and by vertue of his 
Apostolick
 office, he did with authority 
, and boldly and freely oppose himself to 
Peter,
 one of the chief Apostles, when in his practice at 
Antioch,
 he declined from the Doctrine taught by him∣self, concerning the abrogation of the Ceremonial Law. For whereas bef
re s
m
 
J
ws
 (that w
r friends 
f 
James
)
 came from 
Jerusalem, Peter
 did h
ld fellowship with the Christian 
Gentiles,
 and did eat freely with them (which h
 di
 agreeably t
 the Doctrine of Christian Liberty, by which all differences 
f m
ts and nations were removed under the Gospel, as 
Peter
 himself was instru∣ct
d by Vision, 
Act. 10.15.
), but when th
se 
Jews
 were come, he separated him∣self from the 
Gentiles,
 as if it had been unlawful for him to eat with them, and this thorough fear of offending those f
re mentioned 
Jews
 (who were tenacious of the Ceremonial Law); by which bad example of his, some of the other Christian 
J
ws,
 that were at 
Antioch,
 were drawn aside, yea and 
Barnabas
 also was drawn into the same 
dissimulation,
 carrying it so, as if 
fellowship
 with the Christian 
Gentiles
 had been unlawful, whereas both hims
lf and 
Peter
 very well knew the contrary. Now when 
Paul
 saw that they walk
d not uprightly according to the true D
ctrine of the Gospel, he publickly expostulated with 
Peter,
 and de∣manded of him, why he (being a 
Jew
) had cast off the Yoke of the Ceremonial Law, and us
d hss Christian Liberty, (living after the manner of the Christian 
Gen∣tiles
 when he saw occasion) and yet inf
rced this yoke on the 
Gentiles,
 endea∣vouring thereby to induce them to think that it was 
n
cessary
 now for them under the G
spel, to 
bserve th
 C
rem
ial law whereas it was never given unto them,

 nor they ever obliged to observe it, no not before the coming of Christ. Ʋpon the whole matter, for ought that appears to the contrary, 
Peter
 did herein yield to 
Paul
 as having truth on his side. 
From Ver. 1. to the 15.


4.
 He comes now to assert and confirm the 
Gospel-doctrine of Justification by Faith in Christ,
 (which he had before preached to them), against the 
cor∣rupt Doctrine
 of his adversaries, who urged the strict observation of the 
Cere∣monial Law
 as necessary thereunto, by vertue of a Divine Precept standing yet in force, as may be gathered from the Ap stles reasoning. 
Chap. 3.19.25. & Chap. 4.3, 4, 5.


And that he may strike at the root of this most dangerous error, he excludes 
all works
 in general, not only those of the 
Ceremonial Law,
 but of the 
moral
 also, yea 
all works of our own
 whatsoever, from having any influence upon 
our Justification.
 This he proveth, 
1.
 Because they that were 
Jews
 by birth, and so 
faederally
 the holy people of God, (and not such profane idolatrous sinners as the 
Gentiles
 were, who were ignorant of the Law of God, and strangers from the Covenant of God), found it necessary to renounce the works of the 
Law
 in point of 
Justification,
 and to seek 
righteousness
 only thorow 
Faith in Christ;
 there∣fore much more ought 
they Galatians,
 and other 
Gentiles
 so to do, and espe∣cially seeing the Spirit of God affirmeth, 
Psal. 143.2.
 That no man, whether 
Jew
 or 
Gentile
 shall be justified, to wit, 
by the works of the Law
. 'Tis therefore by the Faith of Jesus, or by Faith receiving and resting on Jesus Christ, and that most 
perfect righteousness of his,
 that we are justified. But here he prevents an Objection which he foresaw some of the adversaries of this Doctrine would be apt to make. They will say, that if we seek to be justified by 
Faith in Christ alone,
 and not by the works of the Law, then people may live as they list, and freely indulge themselves in sin. He answers, That though it should so happen, that some who profess to seek 
Justification
 by 
Faith in Christ alone,
 should be found notorious sinners
, yet it would not from thence follow that Christ is the 
Minister, Author,
 or 
Teacher
 of sin. That inference, he rejects with abhorrence and detestation. For he had in delivering this Doctrine of 
Justification
 unto them, shewed, That the same Faith, that lays hold on Christ for 
righteous∣ness,
 doth rest upon him also, for 
grace,
 and 
strength
 to subdue corruption, and he had by many seri
us admonitions strove to b
at down sin among them, there∣fore if he should now, by any thing he should preach, enc
urage sin, he should trans∣gr
ss against the Laws of 
uprightness,
 which ought to be found in every faithful Teacher. And that this Doctrine doth not of it self encourage to sin, he proves by his own example. For (says he) 
I thorow the Law am dead to the Law
 
that I might live unto God;
 that is, by the knowledg of the 
spirituality
 of the 
Law,
 and the 
perfection
 it requires, I have learned, that I am a great sin∣ner, that I have not power perfectly to perform it, that I am therefore subject to the Curse of it, and so I cannot be justified by it. I am so far 
dead
 to the 
Law,
 as not to put any confidence in my 
obedience
 to it, for my 
justification
; yet I am not 
so
 dead to it, as to look upon my self as freed fr
m it, as it is a rule of holy living: But despairing of obtaining Justification and Salvation by my obedience to it, I am forced to fly to Christ, that from him I may receive not only 
Justification,
 but 
grace
 and power to inable me to 
live unto God.
 And as Christ was crucified on the Cross, so by grace derived fr
m him, I crucifie my corruptions, and s
 I live a new and spi∣ritual life, not having this life from my self, but from Christ, who liveth in me by his spirit. And he being the 
root
 and 
spring
 of this new life, I derive it from him by vertue of my union with him; and the 
band
 of my union with him, is my faith in him. And the consideration of his great love in dying for me, is a strong induce∣ment to me, to endeavour to live 
holily,
 that so I may please him. He further sh
ws that if we should be justified by the 
law,
 or 
works
 d
ne in obedience to it, we should frustrate and make v
id the 
grace
 of God. For if Justification be by 
works,
 it cann
t be by 
grace,
 Rom. 
11.6.
 And lastly, Christ's death had been in vain, if the Justification of a Sinner could have been obtained by his own works, 
from ver. 15. to the end.




5.
 Having sharply reproved these 
Galatians
 for their defection from the 
truth,
 
 (among whom Christ had been so evidently preached, and his sufferings, with the causes of them, so clearly opened and set forth, as if all had been done before their eyes); he useth several other arguments to reduce them, and to demonstrate to them, that 
justification
 was by 
Faith
 and not by 
Works.
 And in order here∣unto, he 
first
 appeals to their own experience, and demands of them, whether the 
gifts
 and 
graces
 of the Spirit, both 
ordinary
 and 
extraordinary,
 that were now found in their Church, were conferred on them till the Gospel was preached among them?
 He asks, whether they received them by the 
works of the Law,
 [that is, by hearing the Doctrine of 
justification by works
 preached], or by the 
Hearing of Faith
, that is, by hearing the Doctrine of 
justification by Faith
 preached. And if so, Was there any reason, that having by the preaching of the Gospel (which is a ministery of the Spirit) received such great benefits, and so 
begun
 to be a Christian Church, they should now think it necessary to take in the 
Law?
 Would they now 
end in the flesh,
 and return to those external Mosaical carnal Rites, as if their 
justification
 could not be perfected without them? This he shews would be a point of great folly and absurdity in them. 
2.
 If they should seek 
justification
 by 
works,
 or partly by 
faith,
 and partly by 
works,
 they would lose all the fruit of their former 
sufferings
 for the truth; which would have been rewarded if they had proved constant to the last; but now they will be in danger not only of losing their reward, but of incurring fur∣ther danger
, and bringing a heavier condemnation upon themselves f
r their defection. 
3.
 He resumes and amplifies his first argument, shewing, that the Lord had not only accompanied this Doctrine of 
justification by faith,
 with the saving graces of his Spirit among them, but also with other 
extraordinary gifts,
 such as the working of Miracles, speaking with strange Tongues, curing of Di∣seases; which were so many confirmations, that this Doctrine was of God. 
4.
 Ha∣ving put a close to that argument brought from their 
own experience,
 he adds another, brought from the 
example of Abraham,
 who though he did abound with many virtues and good works, yet he was not justified by those, but by 
faith
 only; which he proves from 
Gen. 15.6.
 where 'tis affirmed that 
Abraham
 be∣lieved in the Lord for the accomplishment of that 
prime promise
 of the Cove∣nant made unto him, that in the Messias (who was to come of him), 
he him∣self
 and 
all the nations of the earth should be blessed, Gen. 12.3.
 And the multiplication of his Seed was promised as a means to bring it about. This 
faith
 of 
Abrahams
 laying hold on the meritorious obedience of the 
Mediator,
 the blessed seed promised; he shews, was imputed or reckoned to him for 
Righteous∣ness,
 or accepted of God for his 
justification.
 And hence he inferreth, that only they 
who are of the faith
 (or seek after 
justification by faith
), are the 
true Children of Abraham,
 who following his steps, shall succeed him in the inhe∣ritance of that great Blessing, 
viz.
 of 
gratuitous righteousness
 and 
justification
 thereby, which he by 
faith
 obtained, 
See v. 9.
 And the Spirit
 (who speaks in the Scriptures) knowing this to be the Counsel of God, that the 
Gentiles
 also should be justified by 
faith,
 he revealed this promise
 (which is called the 
preaching of the Gospel
) to 
Abraham
, 
viz.
 that 
In his seed,
 that is, 
Jesus Christ,
 (who was to come of him, 
Gen. 22.18.) all nations should be blessed.
 So that all that are of 
faith
, or 
true believers,
 whether 
Gentiles
 or 
Jews,
 do partake 
by faith
 of all those saving blessings, which believing 
Abra∣ham
 did partake of; among which, 
free justification
 is the chief. 
5.
 He shews, that they who are of the 
works of the Law,
 that is, who seek to be justified by works done in obedience to the law, are under the 
curse
 of God, and so not justified; the 
Law
 pronouncing a 
curse
 upon every one who fulfilleth it not in eve∣ry particular, 
Deut. 27.15, 16, 26. 6.
 He further adds that no man can be justified by his personal obedience to the 
Law,
 because 
righteousness
 and 
life
 co∣meth by 
faith,
 as he proveth from 
Hab. 2.4.
 
The just shall live by faith.
 Now the way of 
justification
 which the 
Law
 requireth, cannot consist with the way of 
justification
 by 
faith (t).
 For the 
Law
 promiseth life to him only who

 performs exactly what it prescribeth, and so hath a perfect inherent righteousness in himself, as he proveth from 
Lev. 18.5.
 where the 
voice
 of the 
Law
 is, 
The man that doth them (viz.
 those things which the 
Law
 requires) 
shall live in them
 or attain eternal life by them: But the 
voice
 of the 
Gospel
 is, that 
They that believe in Jesus shall be saved. 7.
 He shews not only, 
That we are justified by Faith,
 but 
How Faith doth justifie, viz.
 not for any 
merit
 or 
worth
 in it self, but as it 
closes with Jesus Christ,
 whereby all the blessings purchased by Him, are made over to us: for Christ hath delivered us from the Curse of the 
Law,
 by taking up
n him the Curse due to us, and subjecting himself to death, even the cursed death of the Cross for our sakes, 
Deut. 21.23.
 And from his death, he shews, a double benefi
 d
d flow: First to the 
Gentiles,
 the 
blessing of Abraham
 coming upon them, 
viz.
 the blessing of Church-priviledges, divine ordinances, of re∣conciliation with God, adoption, 
&c.
 which before the time of Christs death they were Strangers unto: The Second to the 
Jews jointly with the Gentiles,
 who be∣ing by Christs death joined in one body, and bec
me 
one seed
 of 
Abraham
 do by 
Faith
 in Christ receive a plentiful communication of the Spirit
 promised in the times of the Gospel. 
8.
 He reasons from humane
 transactions, 
viz.
 From 
Covenants
 made among m
n which if solemnly confirm'd by Oath and other u∣sual solemnities cannot without injustice be broken or disannul
'd, nor any condition de∣structive to them be afterwards superadded. In like manner he shews, God made a 
Covenant
 with 
Abraham,
 and his 
spiritual seed,
 wherein he promised spi∣ritual and eternal blessings, to all those that shall believe in his Son, the promised 
Messias.
 Now 
Abraham
 had 
two seeds
 *, a 
spiritual
 (represented by 
Isaac
) who seek 
justification by Faith
 only; and a 
carnal
 (represented by 
Ishmael
), who seek 
justification by the works of the Law.
 He shews, that the 
Cove∣nant
 was not made with 
Abraham
 and 
both these seeds,
 but only with 
one
 of them, that is, with 
all true believers,
 who are the 
mystical
 Body of Christ, and by virtue of their union with him, 
collectively
 called here by his 
Name.
 This 
Covenant
 he shews, was made and confirmed unto Christ
 or with res∣pect unto Christ, and to all true believers in him both 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles
 (of whom he is the head) four hundred and thirty years before the 
Law
 was given. And therefore if any should say, The way of 
justification by Faith
 in the promise, did h
ld go
d before the 
Law
 was given; but when the 
Law
 was given, that way was altered, and 
justification by works
 established: this he shews, cannot be, seeing the 
Law
 was given so many years after the 
Covenant
 was confirmed
; and therefo
e cannot v
cuate or disanull it. If therefore the inheritance of eter∣nal l
fe (whereof the Land of 
Canaan
 was a type and pledg) be to be obtain'd by 
obdience
 to the 
Law,
 it cannot be obtain'd 
by Faith,
 whereby the grace and blessing promised in Christ is received. For these two cannot stand together. Now God gave it to 
Abraham freely,
 and of 
pure grace,
 promising it unto him on condition of his 
Faith
 without any merit on his part. And in like manner all that desire to approve themselves the true Children of 
Abraham,
 must obtain it, seeing there is but one way of Salvation. 
From v. 15. to 19.


6ly.
 He comes now to answer some Objections, which might be made against what he had said.


Object. 1.
 If 
works
 done in obedience to the 
Law
 do not justifie, then the 
Law
 upon Mount 
Sinai
 seemeth to be given in vain. For why was the 
Law
 given, enjoining so many 
moral, judicial,
 and 
ceremonial
 duties, promising life unto the obedient 
[Lev. 18.5.],
 and threatning Gods 
wrath
 and 
curse
 to the dis∣obedient 
[Deut. 27.26.],
 if the inheritance come not by the 
Law?
 In answer hereunto, the Apostle sheweth, that one main end why the 
Law
 was added to the 
Promise
 was to 
discover sin [Rom. 3.20.],
 and 
restrain
 from Sin, and to make men seek out for a remedy, and so to be a 
Covenant subservient
 to the 
Cov
nant of Grace.
 And this dispensation (as having more of terror than love in it) was to continue during the 
infant-state
 of the Church, 
ven till Christ should come in the flesh, to whom the inheritance was promis
d, as being 
Head
 of all those that shall be heirs, and 
by whom
 they shall obtain it. And

 this God shewed by the glorious and dreadful manner of his giving the 
Law,
 by the ministry of 
Angels,
 and his appearing then in such terror that there was no access for sinful man to him, but by a 
Mediator;
 and therefore upon the peoples request, 
Moses
 was appointed the 
Mediator
 between God and them at that time 
[Exod. 20.19. Heb. 12.19.];
 being therein a 
type
 of Christ, the only 
Media∣tor
 of 
Propitiation.
 Now he shews, that there is no need of a 
Mediator,
 but when there is a disagreement or difference between two parties
. And God is 
one party
 of the 
two
 here, who is offended with sinful man, and is to be 
aton'd.
 Since therefore the people by reason of their great guiltiness, and manifold violati∣ons of Gods 
Law
 were not able to make atonement for themselves, they might from hence learn how much they needed a 
Mediator
 to make atonement for them.


Object 2.
 Then it will he said, that the 
Law
 is against the Promises of God. He answers, No. For the 
Law
 was not given on Mount 
Sinai
 to afford 
life
 and 
justification
 by obedience to it (seeing it could not perfectly be kept); but rather to 
convince of sin,
 and condemn for sin, that men, dispairing of any help in them∣selves, might speedily betake themselves to Christ for life. So that the 
Law
 is not contrary unto, but 
subordinate
 and 
subservient
 to the Promise. For God in the Scriptures
, (or in the legal dispensation of the Covenant of Grace, which stood in force during the time of the Old Testament), hath 
concluded all under sin,
 that is, hath declared all men 
by nature,
 since the 
Fall,
 to be 
under sin,
 that so laying aside all confidence in themselves, they may fly 
by Faith
 to Christ for righteousness and salvation, which are the great things promised in the Covenant of Grace. 
From v. 19. to 29.


Object. 3.
 Seeing the 
Law,
 or that 
legal dispensation
 of the Covenant of Grace was so useful to the antient Church, and so subservient to the 
Promise,
 Why then did 
Paul
 cry down the use of it, especially the practice of the Ceremonial 
Law,
 now? He answers, that, Before 
Faith
 came [that is, the Object of 
Faith, viz. Christ Jesus
, or the more clear and full manifestation of the Doctrine of 
Faith,
 which was about the time of Christs death and ascension], the 
Law
 was very useful to the 
Jews,
 because they were by it, as by a 
military Guard,
 kept from being mix'd with other Nations in Religion, and were 
shut up
 thereby as in a prison under 
sin,
 and the 
curse
 due to 
sin,
 that so they might be the more prepa∣red, and as it were necessitated, to embrace the Doctrine of Salvation by 
Faith in Christ
 (which was, during that dispensation, but darkly revealed), when it should be more clearly discovered; the full revelation whereof they were by this means kept more intent upon. So that the 
Law,
 that is, 
Moses
's Oeconomy, confin'd them with∣in the bounds of 
Faith,
 that they should not seek for 
justification
 by their own inhe∣rent righteousness, or works, or any other way than only by 
Faith
 in the 
Messias.
 Yea the 
Law
 was their 
School-master
 in their minority, to instruct them to repair to Christ for pardon. Thus (he shews) the 
legal dispensation
 of the Covenant of Grace was of good use to the 
ancient Church;
 but denies that the use of it ought to be continued now, when the Doctrine of 
Faith
 is so clearly manifested: Yea on the contrary, (he declares), that it is now to be abrogated, and the Chri∣stian Church freed from the observation of it, because it was to exercise the office of a 
School-mast r
 only over 
Children
 in their minority; but can have no autho∣rity over 
believers
 now, who in comparison of them, are to be l
oked upon as 
grown men.
 For the Christian Church, 
viz.
 all true believers, whether 
Jews
 or 
Gentiles,
 and in particular, all the faithful among the 
Galatians
 were now like a Son come to age by reason of their 
Faith
 in Christ (who is now come in the flesh) and therefore are not under the 
childish paedagogy
 of Ceremonies, or the 
Mosaical
 outward legal dispensation of the Covenant of Grace.


Object. 4.
 But false Teachers might here object, that though it be admitted, that the 
Law
 or 
Mosaical dispensation
 given on Mount 
Sinai
 was added to the

 Promise to be subservient to it; yet 
Circumcision
 was given to 
Abraham
 with the Promise, as the i
itiat
ry seal of it, 
Gen. 17.10.
 Therefore though the 
Law
 or legal dispensation be abrogated; yet 
Circumcision
 was to be kept in the Church, as 
that
 which was given before it, and without which none can be ac∣counted 
Abraham
's Seed, or Heirs according to the Promise. The Apostle answers, that 
Baptism,
 which signifieth and sealeth our ingrafting into Christ 
[Rom. 6. 4.5.]
 was substituted in the place of 
Circumcision,
 and is sufficient for compassing all those ends for which 
Circumcision
 was instituted; because they who are 
bap∣tized into Christ do put on Christ,
 and so are incorporated and made one body with him; they carry his 
Name,
 pr
fess to be 
his,
 are esteemed to be 
in him
 as members of his 
ody. And all that have true Faith in Christ are thus really in∣corporated into him, and made one body with him, of what Nation or Condition soever they be. So that 
Circumcision,
 which by virtue of its institution, did serve to keep up a 
distinction
 between 
Jew
 and 
Gentile [Exod 12.48.]
 cannot here be useful, seeing now all distinctions are to be removed, and 
Circumcision,
 being one main part 
f the partition wall betwixt 
Jew
 and 
Gentile,
 was not any longer to stand in f
rce. For whatsoever Nation, Rank or Sex any be of, it is all one in this matter. None are debarred from Christ, n
r yet the more accepted by him, for any of these things. And all Believers of what condition soever, are all 
one body
 in Christ Jesus; and if they be Christs, and by 
Baptism
 ingrafted into him, they are true Children of 
Abraham,
 though they be not circumcised, and apparent heirs of the heavenly inheritance, given unto 
Abraham
 by Promise. 
From v. 23. to the end.


 
7ly
 He goes on further to clear the freedom of Christians from the 
Mosaical O
conomy
 by the similitude of an Heir, who while he is a 
minor,
 and 
under-age,
 is n
 at his own liberty or disposal, but in point of subjection, like a servant under the Guardianship of 
Tutors
 or 
Governours,
 until the time appointed by his Father be come out; longer than which, he is not to remain in the state of subjection. So says he, Gods Church (whereof we are members) formerly was kept in bondage and subjecti∣on under that strict and rigid administration of the 
Mosaical Oeconomy,
 and tyed to a number of Ceremonial observances
 and bodily significant 
rites
 and 
figures
 whereby G
d instructed the former age of the World, and which were a kind of bon∣dage and slavery to the outward man. But when the 
fulness of time
 was come, which God had appointed for the finishing this 
Oeconomy;
 he sent his Son into the W
rld, who was 
incarnate,
 and subjected himself both to the Precepts and Curse of the 
Law,
 that he might redeem 
them
 that truly 
believe in him
 from the Curse of it, and the 
whole Church
 in general from that 
rigor
 and 
servitude
 under which they formerly had been, as to their outward estate 
[Eph. 2.15.],
 and that they might attain to the 
adoption of Sons grown up.
 And as a Testimony of their Adoption, and 
dvancement to the priviledg of 
Sons now grown up,
 God had sent forth the 
Spirit of his Son
 into their hearts
 clearly testifying this to them, and inabling them (tog
ther with other Sons of God, both among 
Jews
 and 
 
tiles
), with a cheerful voice to call God 
Father
. And as to this, they mi
ht consult their own experience. They might therefore assure themselves they were no more in that 
servile condition
 under the Yoke of Ceremonies, but in a 
free state,
 as 
Sons
 grown up, and 
Heirs
 actually partaking of their Fathers Goods, (
viz.
 of his 
spiritual Graces
), and that in a larger measure than the ancient Church enjoyed before; and all 
thorow Christ
 who hath merited and procured these blessings for us. 
From v. 1. to 8.


8ly.
 Having now sufficiently proved by 
Scripture
 and 
Reason
 the freedom of Christians from that ancient 
legal dispensation,
 and more especially from the Yoke of the 
Ceremonial Law,
 he endeavours further to fasten this truth upon their minds, both by 
sharp reproofs,
 and most affectionate insinuations. And 
first,
 he shews them, that when that 
legal dispensation
 was in force, 
they (viz.
 the 
Galatians
 who were 
Gentiles
) were ignorant of the true God, and worship∣ped

 dumb
 Idols, and consequently were not born, or brought up under th
 
pae∣dagogy
 of the 
Law
 as the 
Jews
 were, wh
 therefore might pretend some excuse for their unwillingness to depart from it. But afterwards by the preaching of the Gospel (which God of his free and rich mercy sent unto them, and not for any desert of theirs), they were brought off from their ignorance; and came to know the true God: whereas, before they look'd not after him, but lay immers'd in their Idolatry: and they were not only brought to know him, but to be 
known of him
, that is, to be acknowledged and owned for 
his:
 whereas before their Conversion, they were not known of God in this sense. And being thus brought into the Liberty of 
Sons grown up,
 he wonders at their folly and ingratitude, that they would subject themselves to the bondage of the 
Mosaical Elements
 or 
Cere∣monies,
 which had now no 
figurative
 or 
sacramental
 signification as formerly they had (when they were shadows of Christ to come), and therefore were 
weak,
 yea 
poor
 and 
beggarly,
 not being able to afford any solid consolation to th
se who observed them. He wonders that they who had been in bondage formerly unto 
Ido∣latry,
 should desire to be in bondage again
 
viz.
 to those 
weak
 and 
poor
 Elements, under subjection to which they never had been before. He instances in some of those Elements unto which they had turned. He tells them, he under∣stands they observed
 (after the manner of the carnal 
Jews
 expecting to be justified thereby) their 
Sabbaths, New-moons, Anniversary Feasts,
 as 
f the 
Passeover, Pentecost,
 and 
Tabernacles,
 and the 
Year of Release
 which was the 
Seventh,
 and the 
year of Jubilee
 which was the 
Fiftieth.
 Which things made him fear he had preached the Gospel and the Doctrine of 
free Justification by Faith in Christ
 in 
vain
 among them. 
From v. 8. to v. 12.


9ly.
 He lovingly exhorts them to return to that wholesom Doctrine of 
Justifica∣tion by Faith,
 without the works of the 
Law. Brethren I beseech you
 (says he), 
be as I am, for I was as you are
, that is, Take me for your ex∣ample, who was once as zealous for those Legal Rites, as any of you are at this pre∣sent. But now I count them, and all things else, but 
dung
 in comparison of the excellent knowledg of Christ 
[Phil. 3.9.].
 He tells them, that they had no rea∣son to suspect that what he spake proceeded from any ill will towards any of them, or from any particular resentment; for they had not done him any personal injury. H
 only pl
aded the cause of Christ, and did not vent any private passion of his own. Nay he was so far from apprehending any injury from them, that he acknow∣ledges they had shewn much love, and respect to him, when being infirm in body, and much broken with afflictions, he came first to preach the Gospel unto them; and yet by those trials
 wherewith it pleased God to exercise him, they were not tempted to despise his 
Person
 or 
Doctrine,
 but received him as if he had been one of the 
holy Angels
 of God, nay as Jesus Christ himself. He asks them, where is that
 blessedness now, which they once thought they enjoyed by his coming am
ng them! Time was, when they thought themselves so blessed by his presence, that th
y could then even almost have plucked out their 
eyes
 for him, to have done him good. And (says he) am I, who formerly was so preci∣ous to you, become now your enemy, because I declare the truth of God to you? As for the 
false Apostles,
 they indeed 
pretend
 great love to you, and zeal for you; but what 
 their ends therein, but that they may exclude us
 that you may affect them. He tells them, they were once zealously affected towards him and his D
ctrine; and 'tis good (he shews th
m) to be 
constantly
 zealous in a good thing, and so he would have them to be, and that as well what he was absent from them, as when he was present with them. He further tells them, they were his 
Children,
 whom with much pains and travail he had brought forth to Christ, and had brought them to take on them the Christian profession, but now they h
d shamefully fallen off from it, so that he was in travail and pain a second time, till the pure Doctrine of Christ be again established among them, and till they receive again the right shape of Christians. He tells them, he much desired to be with them, that being fully acquainted with their state he might accommodate himself accord∣dingly

 to th
m, either in 
meekness
 or 
severity:
 and might 
change his voice,
 either by turning his complaints into praises; or his speech into groans, and his words into tears to bewail their 
Apostacy:
 and by those true significations of his affection, perswade them to return to their former profession; for now he was some∣what perplexed and p
z
d how to deal with them. 
From Ver. 12. to the 21.


10ly.
 He comes now further to clear the Doctrine of 
Justification by Faith,
 and not 
by works,
 from an instance taken from 
Abrahams
 Family, where by a 
typical Allego
y,
 this whole matter is represented. The plain import of which is this, that 
they
 who seek 
Justification by works
 are in a 
servile, misera∣ble,
 and 
cursed
 condition, and at last shall be cast out from the presence of God, and the Society of the Saints; and 
they
 that seek 
Justification by Faith in Christ
 are 
ree Sons
 of the Family of God, and 
blessed,
 and shall at last cer∣tainly attain to an inheritance of life eternal. He exp
stulates therefore with the 
Galatians,
 that they should affect this 
servile, miserable
 and 
cursed
 con∣dition. And 
first,
 He cites his Adversaries, and all others who (contrary to G
ds command) did voluntarily again put themselves under the Yoke of the 
M
sai∣cal Law,
 and sought to be justified by 
works,
 to hear what the 
Law
 it self (or that Collection of the five books of 
Moses,
 which is called the 
Law
) doth say, 
that is,
 to consider the 
sense
 and 
scope
 of the 
Law
. Then he propounds the 
typical History
 of 
Abrahams
 Family, taken from 
Gen. ch. 16. & 21.
 the sum whereof is this; namely, That 
Abraham
 had 
two Sons
, to wit, 
Ishm
el
 and 
Isaac,
 whose condition did differ in 
two
 things; 
1. Ishmael
 was born 
f a 
Bondwoman
 or Servant, 
to wit, H
gar [Gen. 16.1.15.];
 and so he was but as a servant himself, and not the Heir 
[Gen. 21.10.]:
 but 
Isaac
 was born of a 
Free-woman, viz. Sarah [Gen. 21.2, 3.],
 who had never been a Servant, but was the Mistris, and therefore 
Isaac
 himself was no Servant but a 
Free-man,
 and the Heir to his Father, 
v. 22.
 A 
second
 diffe∣rence there was in the 
principle
 of generation and birth: For 
Ishmael
 was born 
after the flesh,
 or by the ordinary strength of Nature, his Mother 
Hagar
 being a young Woman, and fit for conception; but 
Isaac
 was not conceived or born from any such principle, 
Sarah
 his M
ther being Ninety years old when she conceived him 
[G
n. 17.17.],
 and so according to the course of Nature, unfit for con∣cepti
 
[Heb. 11.12.],
 but he was born 
by Promise,
 or by virtue of that pro∣mise made t
 
A
raham, Gen 17.16.
 Which Story, the Apostle shews, was an 
alleg
y,
 that is, besides the 
literal sense
 of the words, God intended they should shaddow forth the 
st
te of his Church
 in the following particulars; namely, 
Abrahams two wives
 should represent the 
two Covenants,
 to wit, the 
old Covenant,
 or the 
old Administration
 of the Covenant of Grace, 
Heb. 8.7.
 (which 
Covenant
 was greatly mistaken by the 
Jews,
 and did degenerate into a plain 
Covenant of works
 in the sense of many who did adhere to it); and the 
n
w Covenant,
 or the 
new Administration
 of the C
venant of Grace, 
Heb. 8.8.
 The 
first
 of which C
venants was prefigured by 
Hagar
 the 
B
nd∣woman;
 and d
scribeth it, 
1.
 From the place where it was given, 
viz.
 upon Mount 
Sinai, 2.
 From the lik
 effect produced by it, as by 
Hagar,
 to wit that as 
H
gar,
 so 
this Covenant
 (especially as it was g
nerally mistaken for a Cove∣nant of 
works
) did beget Children 
unto bondage,
 that is, they who adhered to it (as so understood) were not thereby freed from their bondage to Sin, Satan and Gods Wrath 
(S e Gal. 3.10.),
 but were of a 
servile
 mercenary dispositi∣on, doing what they did in Gods service, not from 
love,
 but slavish 
fear,
 and thinking to merit Heaven by their 
works. See Mar. 10.17.


And having, as it were in a Parenthesis, shewed the fitness of the former re∣semblance (because M u
t 
Sinai,
 where the old Covenant was first given, is cal∣led
 
Agar
 by the 
Arabians
), h
 further describeth 
this Covenant
 by con∣sidering the condition of those wh
 now did tenaciously adhere to it. And 
first,
 he shews them, that the 
earthly Jerusalem,
 or the 
Jewish
 Church (not as she was in her best times, but as she was 
then
 in that present age), did answer or

 bear a kind of resemblance with 
that Covenant,
 because 
that Church
 and her Children did remain in a servile condition, which was the fruit of their adhering to this Covenant, as it was mistaken, and misunderstood for a Covenant of 
works. 2ly.
 He shews, that the 
new Covenant,
 or the 
new Administration
 of the Covenant of Grace was prefigured in 
Sarah,
 and that they who adhere to it are called the 
Jerusalem that is from above;
 and all those who are the 
truly rege∣nerate
 of the Christian Church, and make claim to life, according to the tenour of the 
Covenant of Grace,
 are to be reckoned as belonging hereunto. And this Church is here called 
Jerusalem,
 because that City was a Type of the true Church by reason of its compactness and order, 
Psal. 122.3.
 and beauty, 
Psal. 48.2.
 and the divine protection that was over it, 
Isa. 31.5.
 And is said to be 
from above,
 because her Original is from Heaven 
[Jam. 1.17, 18.],
 and the Mem∣bers thereof have their Conversation in Heaven, 
Phil. 3.20.
 He further shews, the happy state wherein those are who adhere to this Covenant; nam
ly, in a state of freedom from sin 
[Rom. 6.18.],
 and the Curse of the 
Law [Rom. 8.1.],
 and the Yoke of that ancient legal dispensation 
[Eph. 2.15.]. 3ly.
 He shews, who are the 
Children of this Covenant
 [or Members of the true Church adhering to this Covenant], even all 
sincere Believers,
 whether 
Jews
 or 
Gen∣tiles. 4ly.
 He confirmeth the truth of the former mystery, by a quotation out 
Isa. 54.1.
 Which words in their 
first sense
 are a Prophecy of the joy∣ful deliverance of the 
Jews
 out of the 
Babylonish Captivity,
 and call upon the 
material City
 of 
Sion
 or 
Jerusalem
 as on a Woman that had been Barren to 
rejoice,
 because though all the time of the Captivity she had been empty of 
Jews,
 yet now she should be m
re populous than ever she was at any time before her Capti∣vity, or than other Nations were, that had not been led into Captivity. This the Apostle excellently 
adapteth
 to the 
new Covenant,
 which when Christ was here on the Earth had but 
few
 Children, few that were brought forth by it, but after his death, upon the preaching of the Gospel by his Apostles to the 
Gentiles,
 it had 
very many,
 so that the 
Jews
 in comparison of the Christians were but few. 
Lastly,
 The Apostle applies this Typical History, and partly 
comforts
 the truly faithf
l among the 
Galatians
 thereby, and partly 
instructs
 them In order to which, he represents to them these particulars. 
1st.
 As 
Isaac
 by virtue of the Promise, above the power of nature, being born of a 
Free-woman,
 was Heir to his Fathers goods; so all they who seek Salvation, not by the 
Law,
 but by 
Faith in Ch
st
 are supernaturally begotten by the power of Gods Spirit, and by Grace are the 
tree
 Children of God, and such to whom eternal life is promised
, and are Heirs of it, as 
Isaac
 was of his Fathers estate. 
2ly.
 He shews them, that by suffering pe
s
cution by false Brethren (Patrons of Righteousness by Works), they therein were like to 
Isaac,
 whom 
Ishmael
 persecuted with bitter mocking, 
Gen 21.9. 3ly.
 As 
Hagar
 and 
Ishmael
 were cast out of 
Abrahams
 House, (at first by 
Sarah, Gen. 21.10.
 and the sentence afterwards confirmed by God himself, 
v. 12
); so they who seek 
Justification by works
 (prefigured by 
Hagar
 and 
Ishma
l
) shall be cast out of the Church of God, (the Society of the Saints, 
v. 31.
) and shall not obtain the inheritance of eternal life: but they who seek Salvation 
by Faith in Christ,
 shall abide therein, and shall be eternally saved. 
Lastly,
 he shews them, that all true faithful Christians are not Children of the 
Bond-woman
 but of the 
Free;
 and all that desire to approve themselves to be such, mu
t take heed of that error of seeking 
Righteousness by the works of the Law,
 but mu
t hold fast the Doctrine of 
Righteousness
 by Grace through 
Faith in Jesus Christ,
 if they would not exclude themselves from the heavenly inheritance. 
From Ver. 21. to the end.


Having spoken thus much in the vindication of the Doctrine of 
Justification by Faith alone,
 he shuts up the whole disputation with a double exhortation. 
1.
 That 
 they would 
stand fast in their Christian liberty,
 without subjecting themselves again to the 
Mosaical
 Yoke. Which exhortation he enforceth more 
directly
 by six Arguments. 
1.
 Because Christ had purchased this freedom for his Church by

 his own blood. 
2.
 The holding 
Circumcision
 necessary, and as a part of mans Righteousness, doth cut off the 
observer
 of it from all benefit by Christ; because to maintain 
Circumcision,
 is by consequent, to maintain the whole bulk of the 
Mosaical rites
 to be in 
force,
 and so in effect to declare, that Christ is not yet come, seeing all those things were to be done away at his coming 
[Heb. 9.10.].
 And Christ must either be our 
whole Righteousness,
 and our compleat Saviour, or not at all 
[Act. 4 12.]. 3ly.
 He testifies that they that engage themselves to observe 
Circumcision
 (in the way wherein it was urged by the false Apostles, 
Act. 15.1.
), d
 hereby engage themselves to perform the 
whole Law, viz. Ce∣remonial
 and 
Judicial, (Circumcision
 being the initiatory Sacrament engaging the Receiver to the whole 
Mosaical
 Paedagogy, 
Exod. 12.48.
), and 
the whole moral Law,
 and that under the penalty of condemnation. For no less then 
uni∣versal
 and 
perfect
 obedience to the 
Law
 in all its precepts, is required unto 
Justification by works. 4ly.
 He shews, that whoever among them observe the Levitical Ordinances, as they were pressed by the false Apostles, or sought
 to be 
justified
 by observing of them; in so doing, they renounced Christ, and all benefit by him, and were falen away from the Doctrine
 of 
free Grace.
 For 
works
 and 
Grace
 are not consistent in the matter of 
Justification. 5ly.
 He declares that he 
himself
 and other 
Jews
 (who before their Conversion to the Christian Faith were circumcised), being now savingly 
taught
 and inlightened by the Holy Ghost, did renounce all confidence in their own 
works
 or 
carnal pri∣viledges,
 and did look to obtain heaven, (here called their hope
, because the object of their hope, 
Tit. 2.13.
) only by virtue of the 
Righteousness
 which is laid hold on 
by Faith. 6ly.
 In the state of the Church, under the Gospel, since Christ was manifested in the Flesh, he shews, that neither the 
observing of Circumcision,
 nor the 
omitting of it,
 does of it self commend a man to God: but that which he now requires, is a true 
lively Faith
 
in his Son,
 evidencing it self to be 
such,
 by the fruits of true 
love to God
 and our 
Neighbour,
 which is called the 
fulfilling of the Law, Rom. 13.10.
 Yet this is not 
so
 to be under∣stood, as if the use of the 
Sacraments
 of the New Testament or other pieces of 
instituted worship
 were hereby excluded and declared useless, they being helps of 
our Faith,
 with 
ut which, it is impossible to perform any duty of 
love
 to 
God
 or our 
Neighbour,
 sincerely and acceptably. 
From Ver. 1. to 7.


Secondly,
 He further presseth this his exhortation by other arguments, and that as it were by the 
By. 1.
 He commends them for their form
r 
forwardness
 in embracing this 
now controverted truth,
 (which he calls a Running well), and he sees no reason why they sh
uld depart from it. 
2ly.
 Lest they should say, they were fully 
perswaded
 in their Consciences, that 
this way
 they were brought into by their 
new Apostles
 was the way of God; He tells them, that what per∣swasion soever they may have of that kind, it is but a meer 
delusion,
 and comes not from God (who had called them to true Christian Liberty), but from the Devil and his Instruments. 
3ly.
 Lest they should say, he needed not make so much ado about this matter, seeing they had not embraced the whole body of the 
Jewish
 worship, but only observed some particular 
Ceremonies
 there∣of, and as to other things they practised as the Christian Faith required: He an∣swers, that a 
little Leaven,
 a little false Doctrine entertained 
[Mat. 16.12.]
 may easily in time corrupt a mans judgment in other points, and a small number of such 
seduced
 persons may easily infect the whole Church 
[1 Cor. 5.6.]. 4ly.
 He expresses his confidence (grounded upon Charity) that through the Lords gra∣cious assi
tance, they should be 
reclaim'd
 from this their err
r and brought to embrace the same truth again, which he had preached to them; and that he that thus troubled and perverted them (whoever he be) should hear his own 
judgment
 and 
punishment
 from God, except he repent. 
5ly.
 He presses his exhortation by confuting a 
Calumny,
 which (as it seems) his adversaries mad use of, to perswade the people, that he by 
circumcising Timothy
 to prevent the stumbling of the 
weak Jews [Act. 16.3.]
 had declared himself to be of the same judg∣ment

 with them in the present c
nt
oversie. In answer to this, he gives them to understand, that he did not 
rge 
Circumcision
 to be observed by the 
Gentiles
 at all 
[Act. 21.25.],
 nor all
w it to be us'd by the 
Jews,
 in the sense of his Ad∣vers
s, 
 as mi
ht appear t
 them by these two Reasons: 
1.
 If he had preached 
Cir
cisi
n,
 the 
Jews
 would not have persecuted him as they did. 
2.
 They would not h
e 
 s
ch 
ffence at his preaching Salvation through Christ crucified as they did, which is called here the D
ctrine of the Cross, 
1 Cor 1.18.
 For that D
ctrine m
st 
nded them, because by it, 
Circumcision
 and the whole frame of the old 
al Administration (under which they were born and educated) was laid asid
 
[S
e Act. 21.28.]. 6ly.
 He wishes that their 
prime Seducers,
 (who troubled their outward and inward peace) were cut off from Communion with the Church, by the Sword of 
Excommunication,
 because they did burden them with the observation of such things, as were contrary to 
Evangelical liberty,
 to the en∣joyment whereof they were called by God. 
From Ver. 7. to the middle of the 13th. v.


He c
mes now to the 
second part
 of his 
Exhortation;
 namely, That they take heed 
l
st they abuse their Christian liberty
; as if they were freed from all obligation to serve 
God
 or 
man
 in the duties particularly required of them. He gives them therefore these two Rules; 
1.
 That they would not take encourage∣ment from this D
ctrine to give licence to sin and corruption within them, to break all b
nds and to fulfill its lusts and inordinate desires. 
2.
 That they would by 
love serve one another;
 that is, That every one, notwithstanding this Liberty, would from a 
principle of Love,
 imploy himself in all the duties of Love for the bring∣ing about the 
a
d of his Neighbour, and accordingly would either strengthen or in∣large himself in the use of it, as might be most c
nducing to his Neighbours spiri∣tual 
ood and edification, and not by an indiscreet use of his Christian Liberty of∣fend his weak Brethren 
[R
m. 14.13, 15. 1 Cor. 8.9.].
 And 
this serving one another in Love,
 he shews, is the most compendious way to 
keep the whole Law
 which is sum'd up in that one 
word
 or Precept, 
Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self.
 For 
true
 and 
regular
 Love to our 
Neighbour
 supp
seth Love to 
God,
 and springeth from it, as its Fountain 
[1 Joh. 5.1.],
 and is a great 
evid
nce
 of it 
[1 Joh 4.21]
 But he tells them, If there continue bitter strifes and h
ck-bitings among them, they will in all likelyhood, come at last to devour, and d
troy one another. And that he may further press his 
first Rule,
 to wit, That 
t
y should not use their Liberty for an occasion to the flesh,
 he ex∣h
rts them, to 
walk in the Spirit,
 that is, to follow the guidance and motions of the sanctifying Spirit of God, and these benefits would 
ccrue to them hereby. 
1.
 So the 
Lusts of the flesh
 should not rule over them, but they should be victo∣rious in the contest betwixt the 
fl sh
 and the 
Spirit
, that is, betwixt the 
corrupt
 nature, and the 
renewed
 part. For the 
Spirit
 will mortifie and keep un∣der the 
flesh;
 so that though the first motion of imbred Corruption be not totally supp
ssed, yet they shall not be 
fulfilled,
 or brought into act with deliberation and c
ns
s For as the 
evil lustings
 of the fl
sh will strive and struggle against the 
g
od motions
 and inclinations which the Holy Ghost stirreth up; so the 
Spirit
 or 
ren
wed part
 struggleth against the 
flesh
 and the 
evil motions
 thereof, lest
 the 
regenerate
 should do the things which their corrupt nature (that still dwel∣leth in th
) would 
therwise incline them unto. 
2ly.
 Th
y that are led by the 
Spirit
 and inward principle of grace within, are not under the 
condemning power
 of the Law, though they are under it as a 
Rule,
 which their 
renewed part
 complies with. But the Law doth manifestly condemn the Works of the Flesh, (of which he rec
s up a Catalogue of Seventeen, p ssibly too commonly practised Ly
me in th
se Regions and Countries), and those who practise them, he shews, (
xc
pt they repent) shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.


3ly
 If they follow the 
Spirit,
 and exercise the graci
us virtues thereof (of which he reckons up Nine), they will not have the 
Law
 against them, to 
curse
 or 
condemn
 them. For 
such virtues
 and 
gracious qualities,
 the 
Law
 is so

 far from condemning, that it 
enjoins
 them, c
mmands them, and encourageth in the practice of them. He further shews, that 
all they
 who are 
Christs
 (one as well as another) have in 
some good degree
 (though not equally) 
crucifi
d the flesh,
 with its corrupt affections and lusts. For they fetch virtue from Christ crucifi'd for that purpose: Christs death for their sins, strongly obliges them to it. And th
y are not only b
und to it but they actually endeavour it, through the assi
tance of the Spirit of Christ, who dwelleth in them. In Conclusion, he shews, that they that are raised up by the power of the 
Spirit
 of God from the death of sin unto 
 new life, ought in their lives and conversations t
 manif
st it, and to endeavour to walk Christianly and Spiri∣tually
. 
From the middle of v. 13. to v. 26.


He comes now to d
h
rt these 
Galatians
 from some 
particular sins
 (which it seems were too rife among them), and to exhort them to some 
particular duties,
 which they needed to be exhorted unto.


1.
 He d
h
rts them from 
Ambition
 and its evil attendants, 
Reproach
 and 
Envy;
 which Evils, possi
ly, their Church at that time was infected with. 
Ver. 26.


2ly.
 He exhorts th
se among them, who were 
spiritual
 (that is, who had received 
 a larger measure of Grace, and are called 
strong, Rom. 15.8.
 and 
perfect,
 to wit, c
mparatively, 
Phil. 3.15.
), to endeavour to restore and reclaim those who were overtaken with 
any sin,
 and that with the spirit of meekness, considering their own frailty, and how 
easily,
 under a temptation, they themselves might also fall into the like sin
. He shews, this is the end of 
reprehension,
 namely, to raise up our Brother that is fall'n, and not proudly to insult over him. He exhorts them therefore, to 
bear one anothers burdens
, that is, to have compassion on their Brothers failings and infirmities, which lie upon him as a heavy l
ad and
 burden) and to use the best means they can to ease and relieve him, and by discreet reprehensi
n to amend him; and so they shall put in practise 
that command
 of Christ, which 
He,
 n
t only by his Precept but by his Example, so effectually recom∣mended to his Disciples, 
Joh. 13.34. & ch. 15.12. (f).
 And he that insulteth over others that are overtaken, and thinketh himself more strong, deceives himself, and may possibly be found among the weakest when he is tempted. He adviseth them therefore, n
t to compare themselves with others that are 
worse
 than them∣selves (which may stir up pride and arrogancy in them), but to compare them∣selves with those that are better than themselves, that so they may be humbled. L
t 
very one (saith he) try their 
own works
 by the 
rule
 of Gods W
rd, and not by the Works of others, and so they shall find matt
r of rejoicing in themselves alone 
(g),
 that is, in the testimony of their own Consciences, and shall not need to borrow matter 
f rejoicing from the faults and sins of others; for every man shall bear his own burden, that is, give an account of his Works to God, who will 
absolve
 or 
condemn
 men, not as they have done 
better
 or 
worse
 than others, but as they shall be found in 
themselves,
 absolutely considered. 
From Ver. 1. to 6.


3ly.
 He exhorteth the people to exercise 
liberality
 towards their 
Teachers
 and 
spiritual Guides,
 by whom they were taught and instructed. For men shall reap according to what they have sown, whether it be 
much
 or 
little, good
 Seed or 
bad:
 and more particularly, as they have employed their temporal goods, either for 
pious
 uses, or for 
pampering
 their fl
shly Lusts; so they may expect an answerable reward or punishment from the Lord. They that spend 
their Means
 and 
Estates
 upon the service of their fl
shly Lusts, shall of this abuse of their goods, reap 
corruption
 (that is, eternal perditi
n as 'tis here opposed to eternal life): but they that b
st
w their goods to advance the 
work of the Spirit
 in themselves and others, (to further Gods Glory, and Mans Salvation) shall 
of the Spirit
 (that is forasmuch as they have 
mpl
yed their goods ab
ut 
spiritual things
) be gra∣ciously reward
d with eternal life. And in duties of Charity, he tells them, they should n
t be discouraged, though th
y meet not presently with their reward; for in due time they shall gather the fruit which God hath promised. He closeth the

 exhortation to 
beneficence,
 exhorting them while they have opportunity to do good 
to all
 (according to their ability), 
specially to all 
faithful Christians,
 and much m
re to their 
faithful Pastors. From Ver. 6. to 11.


In Conclusion; for a testim
ny of his sincere aff
ction to them, he tells them, he had written this 
whole Epistle
 with his own hand. 'Tis true, he wrote 
larger
 Epistles to some Churches, yet he never wrote 
with his own hand
 any so large as this. As for his 
Adversaries,
 he shews, they were not acted with sincere inten∣tions in urging 
Circumcision
 upon them, but with 
hypocrisie,
 or a desire only to make a 
fair outward shew of Religion,
 by observing that 
fl
shly
 and 
carnal rite,
 and that they might escape pers
cution from the 
Jews,
 (and from the Civil Powers, who were instigated by them, 
Act. 18.12, 13);
 which we, says he, that preach the sincere D
ctrine of the Gospel concerning Christ crucified are exposed unto. For the fury of those 
Persecutors
 was much abated towards 
such Chri∣stians
 as did observe the 
Ceremonial
 Law of 
Moses.
 He further sheweth, that these 
false Apostles,
 that so vehemently urged Circumcision upon them, did not themselves, in other points, observe the 
Law,
 but 
dispensed
 with it among them∣selves where they knew there were none like to publish their doings abroad 
[Mat. 23.4.]:
 yet they urged 
Circumcision
 upon them, that they might be able to boast of the multitude of their Proselytes among them; and that so many received 
Cir∣cumcision
 in their flesh, at their instigation, and carried it as a mark of their in∣structi
n. But as for 
himself,
 he shews them, the matter of his 
Gloriation
 was only the 
Cross of Christ,
 that is, that he had preached up the 
all-sufficient, expiatory,
 and 
satisfactory
 Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross. And for the sake of 
Christ crucified,
 all honour, favour, and respect with men was despised by him, as he for his zeal for Christ was despis'd, persecuted and cast off by the World, 
1 Cor. 4.12, 13.
 And the reason why he gloried in the 
Cross of Christ,
 and not in any 
fleshly priviledges,
 was, because in the 
Kingdom
 or 
Church
 of Christ neither 
Circumcision availeth any thing,
 nor 
Uncircumcision,
 without Regeneration and renewing of the Soul by the Holy Ghost. And to as many as walk 
according to this Rule
 (that is, this pattern of Doctrine which he had taught in this Epistle) concerning 
Mans Justification before God,
 concerning 
Christian Liberty,
 and a 
Christian Conversation,
 he heartily wishes 
peace
 and 
mercy,
 that is, all manner of 
spiritual Blessings;
 they being
 the 
true Israel
 of God. In the close of all, with an 
Apostolick
 authority, he forbids his 
Adversa∣ries
 to make him any further work or trouble, either by 
gainsaying
 his Doctrine, or by 
detracting
 from his Authority, because he bare the 
marks
 of a Servant most faithful, and m
st devoted to Christ; namely, those 
stripes
 and 
wounds
 he had r
c
ived for the name of Christ, 
2 Cor. 11.23, &c.
 He shuts up his Epistle with his accustomed Seal, wishing that the 
grace
 and 
favour
 of Jesus Christ might reside (both as to the effects and sense of it) in their 
Spirits
 and 
Souls,
 to enlighten and sanctifie them more and more, that from thence they may draw Consolation both in Life and Death. 
From Ver. 11. to the end.












SECT. VI.


THe Apostle during his abode at 
Ephesus,
 had a purpose in hi
 mind 
o visit the Churches in 
Macedonia
 and 
Achaia,
 and from 
nce to go up to 
Jerusalem.
 But 
ist he intended to go to 
Corinth,
 and from thence into 
Macedonia,
 and from 
Macedonia
 to 
turn 
 to 
Corinth,
 and so to go to 
Jerusa∣lem
 [
 
Cor.
 15 1
] to which place he had appointed the God 
 the 
oor 
aints in 
Judaea
 to be sent: and from th
nce 
 
ght to go to 
Rome,
 and so to take a Journey in∣to 
Spain▪ R

mo

 and 
Erastus
 into 
Macedonia,
 he himself staying in 
Asia
 for the pr

p

Ephesus,
 by the sp

Nine months;

SECT. VII.


ABout this time there arose a 
Schism
 in the Church of 
Co∣rinth:
 some of them, contentiously preferring their own Teachers (from whom they denominated themselves) be
ore others; some s
ying, they were of 
Paul,
 some of 
Apollos,
 some of 
Cephas,
 and some that they owned none for their Teacher but 
Christ,
 1 
Cor.
 1.11, 12.




Upon this difference, and some others, 
Apollos
 with certain other Brethren came with Letters from the Church there to the Apostle now at 
Ephesus,
 to desire his advice, concerning several weighty matters and Cases of Conscience, relating to the pre∣sent state of their Church.


Paul
 joining 
Sosthenes
 with him (that he might be a witness to this his admonition, and so by two witnesses this his Testimony might be confirm'd), wrote his 
First Epistle to the Corinthians,
 and sent it by 
Stephanus, Fortunatus,
 and 
Achaicus,
 who, with 
Apollos,
 were the Messengers of the 
Corinthians;
 But 
Apollos
 refused to return at that time with them [1 
Cor.
 16.12.]; pos∣sibly because he would not countenance a faction, there begun, in part under his Name.




Which Epistle consists of these Three parts.




1. 
The Preface.


2. 
The Body of the Epistle.


3. 
The Conclusion.




IN the 
Preface
 we may take notice of the 
Writers
 of the Epistle, namely 
Paul
, (called by the will and appointment of God to be an Apostle of Jesus Christ), and 
Sosthenes
, whom he joins with him, as a witness to this his Admonition, that by 
two witnesses
 his Testimony might be confirm'd.


The Epistle is addressed and directed, not only to the 
Church of Corinth,
 but to all the Christians of 
Achaia
, to all that are sanctified by the Spirit of Christ, to all that are 
Saints
 by effectual Vocation, to all that have the Name of Christ called on them
, to all that in any place own him, profess him, and seek to him for help; who is the Lord of all true Believers every where. To all such he wishes, that abundance of Grace and Peace may flow from God the Father as the 
Fountain,
 and from Jesus Christ as the 
Conduit-Pipe.


And in the first place, he declares, How thankfull he was to God for the riches of his Grace bestowed on them through Jesus Christ and the preaching of his Gos∣pel among them. For they were endowed with all manner of spiritual Gifts per∣taining to the knowledg and preaching of the Gospel; namely, with the knowledg of the mysteries of the Christian Faith, and the gift of Tongues 
(d).
 So that the divinity of the Gospel (which testifies of Christ), was by these Gifts strongly at∣tested and confirmed among them. He tells them, they wanted no spiritual Gifts, which other Christians enjoyed, tending to their edification, or confirmation, only they should look that they improv'd them well, assuredly expecting Christs second Coming. He was perswaded God would
 confirm them, and cause them to perse∣severe in Grace, that they may be found blameless, and unreproveable in the day of Christs appearing. For having effectually called them to a participation of the benefits of his Son, he is faithful and will not forsake them [see 
Jer. 32.40.
], but will carry on his own work in them. 
From Ver. 1. to 10.


He comes now to the 
Body
 of the Epistle: wherein,


1. He Pathetically exhorts them to 
Unity;
 beseeching them, for the sake of Christ, that they would all agree in the Doctrine of Salvation, and use one man∣ner of speaking of the same 
Faith;
 that there be no 
Schisms
 among them; but that they be compacted, and united as members of the same Body, in the same belief, judgment, and affections. And this exhortation, he supposes they had need of, because he had been informed by some of 
Cloe
's
 Family, that there were 
Schisms
 among them: and some
 pretended, that the Doctrine they had recei∣ved, was peculiarly taught them by 
Paul
, and so declared themselves to be his Disciples: Others cried up 
Apollo,
 as being instructed by him, after 
Paul
's departure: Others that came from 
Judea,
 and p ssibly had been taught by 
Peter,
 cried up 
Peter:
 Others professed themselves only the Disciples of 
Christ,
 and would not take any factious Names of other T
ach
rs upon them, and therein did well. Hereupon be reproves their 
divisions,
 and exhorts them to Ʋnity. And that he might the better perswade them to it, he demandeth of them, whether Christ, (though he hath divers ministers and instruments) hath any more than 
one Church, one Body,
 and 
one Kingdom;
 and if so, whether one part of the Church should be n
m
d from 
Christ,
 and the other parts from 
Paul, Peter, Apollos,
 or other Teachers? He asks, whether 
Paul
 was 
crucified
 for them? Or whether they were 
baptiz d
 in the Name of 
Paul,
 so as they should 
deno∣minate


 themselves from 
Paul.
 As for himself, he was so far from pretending (as some of their 
vain-glorious Teachers
 did) by baptizing of many, to bind them unto himself, (that they might acknowledg him for their head) that he baptized none am
ng them, but 
Crispus
 and 
Gaius
, (that he remem∣bred), and the Houshold of 
Stephanus.
 For Christ did not send him principally to 
baptize,
 (which others might do as well), but to 
preach the Gospel
 to those who never heard of it before. And this he was to perform in a 
plain
 and 
serious
 way, and not to set himself to attract men to the 
Faith
 by the power and artifices of humane Eloquence; lest the Doctrine of 
Christ crucified
 should be rendred sus∣pected, by such a pompous way of preaching it. He acknowledges, that the plain preaching of a 
crucified Saviour
 may seem a ridiculous thing to impenitent sin∣ners; but unto such who have been brought by Faith to embrace Christ, and have thereby part in eternal life, 'tis the glorious evidence of the 
power of God
 in thus bringing about their Salvation.


What therefore the Prophet 
Esay
 threatned against the men of his time 
[Isa. 29.13, 14];
 he applies to all Contemners of the Gospel now, namely, that 
God would turn their wisdom into foolishness, who contenting themselves with an outward formal devotion in their addresses to Him, regarded not inward sanctification, nor those things wherein the power of godliness consists.


And he further tells them, they might consult their own experience, whether God in the Calling of the Church, did ordinarily make use of the 
Philosophers
, or the 
learned Heads
 of the World, or the 
Jewish Rabbies,
 those 
mystical
 and 
allegorical Interpreters
 of the Scripture? Nay, whether he did not make their 
wisdom
 to appear stark 
folly,
 in comparison of the glorious effects 
the preaching of the Gospel
 produced. And seeing by the glorious 
wisdom
 of God, which shi∣ned in his works of 
Creation
 and 
Providence,
 the 
Heathen World
 (notwith∣standing all their Wisdom and Philosophy) were not brought to know God 
aright,
 so as to glorifie him; it pleased God, by 
such preaching
 as seem'd to them 
foolish∣ness,
 to save those who were thereby brought to believe in his Son. For as the 
carnal Jews
 require some sign or prodigy from Heaven to be shewed them, to per∣swade them of the truth of the Gospel: So the 
Greeks
 look for profound 
Philo∣sophy
 in the Gospel, and scorn it because they think they find it not there. But we, says the Apostle, are nothing discouraged hereby, but go on in our course, prea∣ching 
Christ crucified;
 which Doctrine, is to the 
Jews
 (who looked for a victo∣rious 
M
ssias,
 who should rescue them out of the power of their enemies) a 
stumbling block;
 and to the 
Gentiles
 (who are gratified with nothing but Eloquence and Phi∣losophy) 
meer foolishness.
 However, unto them that are 
effectually called
 both among 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles
 this Doctrine is deservedly acknowledged to be the great evidence of the 
power
 of God, and the manifestation of the wisdom of God above all worldly wisdom. Neither ought this to seem strange, for the institutions of God (though they may seem weak and foolish to the World) are more efficacious and powerful then all the wisdom and power of wordly men. And as God in 
calling
 of men, (as they might observe), does not, for the most part, call the 
wise,
 and 
noble,
 and 
great,
 but 
meaner
 persons; so likewise he hath not made choice of the 
lofty strain
 of preaching to serve his glorious ends in converting sinners, but the 
plainer
 way. He hath chosen 
the way
 which the World will count 
foolish,
 on purpose that by the 
success
 of it, the wise men of the World may be put to shame, (being so much deceived in their expectation); and he hath chosen 
that way
 which the World counts 
weak,
 that he may make it appear, how much more power there is in it (when his blessings concurs with it), than in those ways they account most excellent and powerful: and lastly, he hath chosen 
such means
 for the bringing a∣bout his glorious ends, which to the men of the World seem despicable, and abject, that it may appear how empty all those things are which are so much valued in the World, when these which they so much despise, shall be manifested to be more effectu∣al than they. And this he does, that no man may have any reason to boast of his wis∣d
m before him; but may be forc'd to ascribe all glory to him. And he tells them, that it is of 
his working alone,
 that they are now 
in Christ Jesus,
 that they believe

 in him, and are by Faith ingrafted into him, whom God hath made to all true Believers 
the Author
 of all spiritual blessings; 
viz. Wisdom
 by the revelation of the mystery of Salvation; 
Righteousness
 by his full satisfaction and perfect obe∣dience; 
Sanctification
 by the gift of his Spirit; and 
full Red
mption
 from all evils and mis
ries both of Soul and Body; That so 
all this great good
 may be thankfully acknowl
dged to come from God alone, and none else, as of due it ought; according to 
Jer. 9.23, 24. From Ver. 10. to the end.


 To the intent therefore that the glory of God may not be obscured, he sheweth, he had not used 
Eloquence
 of Words, in publishing the Gospel, whereby God 
t
sti∣fies
 and reveals his Will concerning the way of saving sinners. Wherefore he thought it not fit to profess, or teach any other Doctrine among them, then 
that of Christ crucified.
 And when he was with them, being under some p
nsiveness
 of mind, and fear of danger from enemi
s, h
 was far from s
tting forth h
ms
lf with ostentation or pride, as their vain-glorious Teachers now did. Neither was his publick preaching or private exhortations garnished with humane eloqu
nce but though plain, yet were they accompanied with a 
s
cret p
wer
, and 
con∣viction
 of the Spirit, inlighting the mind, and perswading the Conscience. And he used such plainn
ss, that their 
Faith
 might not be grounded meerly on humane perswasion, but on the 
divinity
 of the Doctrine, witn
ssed to their hearts by the convictions of the Spirit of God. But though h
 us
d such plainness, yet his pr
a∣ching was not void of all wisdom; for the Doctrine he preach
d, was 
true
 and 
divine▪
 wisdom, and appeared to be so, to all true and 
sound
 Believers, who have arriv'd to a higher pitch of wisd
m than others. These appreh
nd, ad∣mire and magnifie it, though it be of a different strain from the wisdom of the World and the Politick Maxims of the Princes and Rulers of the World who

 (neglecting Christ) with all their worldly wisdom and policy dye and perish. But that which he preach'd was the 
wisdom
 of the eternal God, touching the redemp∣tion and salvation of man, hidden formerly under holy mysteries
 and 
Jew∣ish
 Types, and but darkly spoken of by the Prophets, which God d
termined in himself, before the World began, to manifest in the Gospel, that by the knowledg thereof all true Believers might attain eternal glory, This wisdom few
 of the 
chief men
 among the 
Jews
 or Rulers of the 
Gentiles,
 had any clear under∣standing of; for had they known it, out of reverence to the divine power, they would have been afraid to crucifie 
the Lord of Glory,
 who plainly appeared, by the 
voice
 from Heaven, and his 
miracles,
 t
 be 
God himself
 c
me down from Heaven, though cloathed with our nature. Neither is it to be w
ndr
d at, that these 
witty men
 could not perceive this wisd m; for those things that the G
spel reveals, pass all mens understandings except they be supernaturally inlightn
d. For (to accommodate the words of the Prophet 
Isaiah ch. 64.4.
 to our present purpose), 
Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man, naturally to perceive the glorious things that God has prepared, and holds forth in the Gospel, to them that love him.
 But (says he) God hath revealed these excellent things to us 
who believe,
 by his 
Spirit,
 who knows
 all the secret Counsels of God, as being of the same essence with the Father and the Son. As the 
thoughts
 and 
designs
 of a man, none knoweth but his 
own Spirit;
 so these 
divine matters,
 none can know or reveal to us, but the 
Spirit
 of God. And this 
holy Spirit
 (and not the Spirit that acts the men of the world, which suggests only worldly things) is given to us 
who believe,
 that we may certainly know 
the things
 that are freely given us of God, for our Comfort and Salvation, 
viz.
 Christ and his benefits. And these spiritual things being made known to us, we desire to 
manifest them,
 not with the painted language of mans wisdom, but in a style and words which the Holy Ghost teacheth, adapting
 spiritual language, to spiritual things. But 
such things
 as th
se, they that are led only by the light of humane
 reason, do absolutely despise, and cannot apprehend or approve: for 
spiritual
 things are only 
spiritually
 discerned; namely, by a spiritual light, which the meerly rational unregenerate man is destitute of. But he that is spiri∣tual (that is, that is inlightened and renewed by the Spirit of God) discerneth 
all these things
 of which we speak; so that he cannot be convinced of any error in his discerning or judging of them, by any man that is not spiritual
 and rege∣nerate. And what 
carn
l
 man can be imagined to know the mind of the Lord so well, as to be fit to inform and counsel the 
spiritual
 man, or to convince him of any error? But for us Ap
stles (says he), we have had the mind of Christ re∣vealed to us by his Spirit, therefore none can teach you more of the truth of God than we, 
From Ver. 1. to the end.




 He proceeds to shew a further reason, why he used such plainness when he was among them, namely, because he could not look upon the greatest part of them, as other than 
Babes in Christ,
 and 
carnal
 (if compared with those who have further progress and improvement in Christianity), and therefore judged they had need of 
milk,
 and not of 
strong meat,
 which they c
uld not at 
that time
 bear, neither indeed could they 
now.
 And that they were yet 
something car∣nal
 (and had not attain'd to the true Christian temper), he shews, the 
envy, strife
 and 
contentions
 that were among them, did too much evidence; which while they continued in, they walked as 
carnal
 and 
unregenerate
 men: yea, their 
denominating
 themselves from cert
in 
Teachers,
 and making a 
Schism
 about them, and holding with th
m against others, did plainly argue them to be 
car∣nal.


And by this means, he shews, they attributed more to their Teachers then was meet. For what, says he, are 
Paul
 and 
Apollos
 but only 
Ministers
 and Instru∣ments of your Conversion and Faith, as far as God is pleased to furnish them with Gifts, and enable them in his work; and their labour, either as to 
Conversion
 or 
Edification,
 is no more available without the blessing of God, than the 
planting
 or 
watering
 of the Gardiner is, if God give not the increase. 
From Ver. 1. to 8.


He now uses another Argument against this 
Schism
 taken from the 
unity
 that ought to be among their Teachers; who in 
office, labour
 and 
teaching
 ought to be 
one,
 and therefore neither 
by them,
 nor 
for them,
 is the Church to be di∣vided. Indeed their 
labour
 is not 
one,
 neither shall their 
reward
 be 
one:
 but their 
work
 is 
one,
 for they are by their office to be 
co-workers
 together with God in his 
husbandry,
 and in his 
building.
 And for his own particular, he shews, he had been a 
builder
 (under God) am
ng them, and as became a 
pru∣dent
 and 
faithful Master-builder,
 he had laid the 
foundation,
 and by prea∣ching the Doctrine of 
Christ crucified,
 had begun a Church among them, and o∣thers have come in since, and have superstructed on this foundation; but he ad∣vises such Teachers, to take heed they superstruct no other Doctrine upon it, than that which agrees with it. If they do, they will do it at their own peril. For he having laid the only 
sure foundation
 among them, 
viz.
 the 
Doctrine of Christ crucified,
 no Teachers whatsoever, ought to teach any thing contrary thereto, nor go about to direct sinners to seek for the remission of their sins any o∣ther way, then by Faith in Christ. Now whether a man build upon this foun∣dation, 
Gold, Silver, Precious Stones,
 (that is, 
pure, solid D
ctrine
), or 
Wood, H
y, Stubble,
 (that is, 
vain curious Subtilties,
 and 
philosophical Conceits,
 t
nding more to ostentation than edification, which though they do not destroy the foundation yet disfigure it) every mans work shall be made manif
st of what sort it is: for 
time
, and the 
light
 of Gods Word will manifest the

 verity, or vanity of Doctrines delivered by Preachers. And if any mans Doctrine he like 
good metal
 that will endure the Furnace or trial without being consumed, he shall receive a reward for his faithfulness. But if his Doctrine will not endure the trial (as Wood, H
y, Stubble, and Dross will not) he shall lose his labour, so as it shall not be accepted or rewarded by God. Notwithstanding for his own person, if he hath held firm to the foundation, and be otherwise found sincere in the Faith of Christ, he shall be saved
, yet with difficulty, even as a man that hardly 
scapeth out of the fire
. 
From Ver. 8. to 16.


Another Argument which he uses to move them to take heed of bringing in any false Doctrines among them, is this: All, says he, that are brought effectu∣ally to believe in Christ, are the 
Temple of God,
 a Church of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in them. Now if any man defile the Temple or Church of God, by bringing in any impure Doctrine or Practises among them, he must ex∣pect that God will severely punish him, except he repent and amend. And all you that are 
true
 and 
real
 Christians, make up this Temple or Church, 
V. 16, 17.


And lest any of their vain-glorious Teach
rs (being puft up with a c
nceit of their worldly wisdom) should notwithstanding all his admonitions, resolve to go on in their way, he advises them to take heed, that this their 
carnal wisdom
 deceive them not. For says he, I tell you, if any man among you seemeth to himself to be wise, according to the wisdom that acts the men of this world, his best way is to deny his own 
carnal wisdom,
 and submit himself to the wisdom of God, and the plain Doctrine of the Gospel, which the World accounts 
foolishness,
 and then he shall approve himself truly wise towards God, and in the matters that concern his Soul. For God accounts carnal wisdom 
foolishness,
 especially when it rejects his institutions, or (despising the simplicity of them) sets up its own inventions, which will not further a man to true happiness. So that according to the words of 
Eliphaz, Job 5.13. God catcheth the wise in their own craftiness;
 and according to 
Psal. 94.11.
 God manifests 
the thoughts of the wolrdly wise to be vain. From Ver. 18. to 20.


From all that he hath before said, he infers, that they should not glory in their 
Teachers,
 nor ascribe too much to them, nor depend on them, as if they were 
Lords


 of their Faith. For all of them, even the 
greatest
 as well as the 
least,
 even the 
Apostles themselves,
 and all their gifts are ordained of God for the use and service of the Church. Yea al
 things in the World, 
life, death, things present, things to come,
 are all appointed to promote, advance, and accomplish the eter∣nal happiness
 of those that are the 
true members
 of Christ. And they being Christs 
redeemed ones,
 ought to reckon themselves his 
Flock,
 and to de∣pend on him, and obey him; as Christ himself, the well beloved Son of God, resigned up himself to the will of his Father. 
From Ver. 20. to the end.


 He proceeds to sh
w, h
w he would have them judg of him, and other faith∣ful Ministers of Christ, namely, not as 
Masters of their Faith,
 but as 
Ministers
 of Christ, and 
Stewards
 and Dispensers of the Mysteries of G
d [
viz.
 his 
Word
 and 
Sacraments]
 wherein faithfulness is especially requir'd. He de∣clares how little he valued their
 judgment of him, who preferr'd their elo∣quent Teachers before him. He shews, he dare not judg himself, whether he had greater Gifts than they, nor determine how much he was to be esteemed 
above
 other Teachers, or 
below
 them; much less should they judg him, who knew him not so well. For though he was not c
nscious to himself of negligence or unfaith∣fulness in his ministry, yet he durst not justifie himself, or think himself free from all blame, and so determine of his own desert. This he left wholly to the judg∣ment of the L
rd, who knows all things, and the very secret intentions of mens hearts, and at his Coming, will reward every man according to his works; and th
n those who have 
done ill
 shall be ashamed, and those who have 
done well,
 shall be commended and rewarded. 
From Ver. 1. to 6.


He concludes this whole Discourse, and shews the scope of it to be, that none of them should glory in their 
Teachers,
 or set them up 
so,
 as to disparage o∣thers. He shews, how he had used his prudence in this business, 
concealing the names
 of their ambitious Teachers; and transferring the whole matter by a 
fi∣gure
 upon 
himself
 and 
Apollo,
 not that 
they
 had any part therein, but he did it to this end, that the 
Corinthians
 might from them and their example, learn to think 
soberly
 of all Ministers, and esteem them no more than 
Stewards
 (as he had written to them before at the first verse), who were to distribute to them, what Christ had intrusted them with. For if they were not to frame 
Sects
 to themselves under the Name of 
Paul
 and 
Apollos;
 much l
ss ought they under the Names of others, who could not be supposed to excell in such extraordinary Gifts. And what Teacher (says he) is there, that hath cause to boast, and lift up himself above another? Who is it that 
differenceth
 him from another, but God only? And if so, he ought to think modestly of himself, and not to despise others. But ye 
Co∣rinthians,
 says he, are so proud of the parts and gifts of your Ministers, and think your selves so full, and rich, and furnished with all kind of knowl
dg, that you fancy to your selves that you reign like Kings, without 
us,
 as if you were not beholding 
to us before,
 nor 
now
 stood in any need of 
us
 (your Apostles and spiritual Fathers), who first converted you to the Faith. And I wish for my part, ye were in such prosperity and felicity as you dream of, that so 
we,
 who are so sharply persecuted, might come to you, as to a 
refuge,
 and enjoy some part of that pros∣perity with you. But I think God hath 
set us forth
 (who are the 
last
 
Apostles,
 and called since Christs ascension) as a spectacle
 to the World, to Angels and men [to 
good Angels
 and 
good men,
 as those who compassionate

 us; so 
evil Angels
 and 
evil men,
 as those that delight in our sufferings]. I say God hath 
set us forth,
 as those that are to conflict with all s
rts of miseries, and death it self. We are accounted 
Fools,
 both by the World, and perhaps 
by you,
 because we run so many hazzards for Christ; but you count your selves 
wise,
 and sufficiently skill'd in the Doctrine of the Gospel, whilst you mingle your worldly wisdom with it, and hazzard nothing for it. We are 
weak
 and 
broken
 with afflictions, but ye are 
strong
 as keeping your selves out of the reach of tribulation. Ye are 
honourable,
 we are 
despised;
 We are expos'd to wants of several sorts; We labour with our own hands, and suffer injuries and reproaches, and are reckoned as the 
filth
 and 
off-scouring
 of the world to this very day; and yet, as our Sa∣viour has enjoined us, We pray for our Persecutors, and return good for evil. 
From Ver. 6. to 14.


He comes now in the last place, to mitigate his sharp reprehension of them, tel∣ling them, his intent therein was only to 
warn
 them, not to 
shame
 them, and that he did it out of his fatherly affeciion to them, whom he truly loved as his spi∣ritual Children, begotten by the Gospel which he had preached among them. For though others had since instructed them, yet they might remember that he 
first
 preached the Gospel unto them. Wherefore he exhorts them to be obedient to him as their 
spiritual Father;
 which that they might be, he tells them, he had for the present sent 
Timothy
 to them, who exactly knowing his whole course of 
Life, Doctrine,
 and 
Practice,
 and what 
Way
, and 
Rule
 he followed in teach∣ing the Churches, should put them in remembrance of th
se things that concerned them. He tells them, he hears, some among them were puffed up by reason of his absence, and despised him, as if he would not come again among them, and so they should escape censure. But he acquaints them, that he intended (with the Lords leave) to come speedily unto them, and would then try, whether in those their Teachers they so much boasted of, there be only eloquence of words, or whether their preaching be accompanied with
 power and efficacy, so as to work on the hearts of the hearers. For the 
Kingdom of God
 is not set up in the hearts of men by eloquence, but by the power of the Spirit, accompanying the Word.


Lastly, he asks them, whether they desired he should come 
to their correction,
 with the authority of Church-censures (which he resolved to do if they persisted in their Schism); or whether he should come to their 
comfort
 in the Spirit of love and meekness, which he intended, if they reformed? 
From Ver. 14. to the end.


He comes n
w to the 
second part
 of the Epistle, wherein he reprehends several 
 
vices
 among them in the two following Chapters; and then satisfies some 
Q
e∣stions
 or Cases of Conscience propounded unto him. And in the first place, he in∣timates to them, that they had no great reason to glory or boast of their prosperous con∣dition, seeing they had so many things among them, for which they ought to be humbled.


As particularly, 
1.
 For their neglect of 
Church-discipline,
 in not excommu∣nicating an 
incestuous
 person. He tells them, that it is commonly reported, that there is such 
Fornication
 committed among them, which is not so mu
h as na∣med among Heathens without abhorrence and detestation, 
viz.
 That one should

 marry his 
Mother-in-Law,
 and that during his Fathers life, as seems to be in∣timated, 
2 Cor. 7.12.
 And whereas they should have mourned, and been great∣ly humbled, that so scandalous a sin was committed among them; and should, with the open expressions of sorrow
 and grief (as was usual in the Church), have proceeded to 
excommunicate
 the offendor, they were puffed up
, and gloried in their present condition; or possibly, one party insulted over the other, whose Teacher this 
offender
 was. He tells them, that though he was not 
perso∣nally
 present with them, ye he was in 
heart
 and 
spirit [see Col. 2.5.],
 and by vertue of that authority that belonged to him, he had already passed sentence on that 
ossend
r;
 namely, that in a publick Assembly, gathered in the Name of Christ, (in which they were a
so to supp
se him, their Apostle, in heart and spirit present among th
m), they sh uld by the authority of Christ (committed to him and them) proceed t
 
mmunic
te and deliver up into the power of Satan 
this incestuous person,
 that he may inflict some disease upon him, that may be a means to humble him, and bring him to the sight of his sin, and to repentance for it, and so be a means to save his soul at last, 
1 Tim. 1.20.
 He tells them, their glorying and insulting one against another, on occasion of this miscarriage, was very evil and vile. F
r they should consider that sin like 
leaven
 is of a spreading nature, and ther
f re they sh
uld purge out from among them (by the dreadful sentence of 
excommunication
) this incestuous person, and all other scandalous sinners, that their Church might be a pure and clean body (a holy Society in truth and reality), as by profession they were Saints and unleavened. And he draws an argument from the custom of the ancient 
Jewish
 Church, in the celebration of their 
Passeover,
 who were then oblig'd to purge out all 
leaven
 among them, and during the whole Feast (in commemoration of their deliverance out of 
E∣gypt
) to eat none but 
unleavened
 bread: so (says he) we that are Christi∣ans, Christ our 
Pascal Lamb
 being sacrific'd for us, should pass our whole time; and all our days, as a perpetual celebration and commemoration of that great re∣demption wrought for us by Him, keeping this 
spiritual Feast
 continually, so as not to allow 
in our selves,
 or to tolerate among us the 
leaven
 of naughtiness and wickedness, of uncleanness and vilany; but to practise all Christian purity, and to hold fast the truth that hath been delivered to us. 
From Ver. 1. to 9.


2.
 He tells them he had wrote to them in a former Epistle
 to forbear all fami∣liar converse with 
Fornicators,
 and to avoid them, as scandalous flagitious per∣sons. But he would not have them understand it of 
Heathens
 among them, who had not given up their Names to Christ; n
r that they should only avoid 
Hea∣thens,
 that were guilty of those other scandalous sins of 
Covetousness, Extor∣tion,
 or 
Idolatry.
 For the 
Corinthians,
 being for the most part 
Infidels,
 were many of them 
such,
 with whom they must needs have a civil converse whilst they liv'd among them. But he would have them to understand it of 
Christians.
 For what had 
his
 or the 
Churches
 censures to do with those that are not members of the Church? These were the only persons they were to 
judg
 and censure (as they knew by their own practice) and to leave all others to Gods tribunal. And accor∣ding to these rules, he orders them to proceed against this incestuous person. 
From Ver. 9. to the end.




3.
 He reproves their contentious 
Law-Suit
s,
 and impleading one another be∣f
re 
 Infidels, rather than submitting themselves to the judgment of Christians, This he disswades them from, by several Arguments,


1.
 The Saints at the day of Judgment, being acquitted themselves, shall, at 
Assessors
 with Christ, and 
approvers
 of his righteous Judgment, judg the World
, and Apostatiz'd Angels, therefore surely they are worthy to decide temporal differences in this life. He tells them, they had better, if their D
ctors and Teachers be not at leisure to end their differences
, refer them to the deter∣mination of some honest, pious, though poor
 Christians, than bring them be∣fore Infidels. He tells them, they shame their own Society, whilst they betake themselves to the Judicatories f Heathens, as if there were never a 
wise man
 am
ng themselves. He shews them, that seeing they are Brethren, they ought not to vex one another with Law-Suites, especially before Heathens. It would be much more decent for them to suff
r injury and wrong, than with scandal to con∣tend. And yet, those among them that were most forward to go to Law, were com∣monly the injurious persons, and such as had no Right on their side. And the 
root
 of these disorders, was want of love, mutual forbearance, meckness and righte∣ousness. He testifies t
 them, that these 
unjust contendings,
 as well as other scandalous wickednesses, and abominable impurities (which he there reckons up) will keep men out of Heaven, except they repent. And seeing that some of them had formerly been defiled with those, or at least with 
some
 of those vices, before their conversion, but were now (as he did in Charity judg) changed persons, washed
 in the blood of Christ from the guilt of their sins (of which Bap∣tism is the Sacramental Sign and Seal), and justified by Faith in him (there being no other Name
 under Heaven by which they can be saved), and sancti∣fied by the Spirit of God, therefore they ought to take heed of defiling themselves again with scandalous 
contentions,
 or with any other of the Vices there named. 
From Ver. 1. to 12.


4ly.
 He comes now to reprehend the growing Heresie of the 
Nicolaitans,
 which allow'd the 
Eating things sacrific'd to Idols,
 and 
Fornication,
 as things in∣different. And First, he grants, that all 
indifferent
 things are lawful, and may be used; but with two restrictions, or cautions. 
1.
 When they are 
expedient,
 and may be done or made use of, without hurting our selves or our Neighbours. 
2.
 When they do not get such a d
minion over us, as to inslave us to an intemperate use of them. He instances particularly in 
meats,
 and shews the difference between the 
free use of them,
 and 
Fornication.
 He grants, that it is lawful to use any kind of meat, because God hath ordained it for the good of mans nature. Meats are or∣dain'd for the belly, and the belly for meats; but yet with a temporary conjunction: for as God will destroy meats, so he will destroy the belly also, as to the use it now hath: therefore for the sake of the belly we ought not to endanger our eternal Sal∣vation, or the Salvation of others, eating 
so,
 as may tend to enc
urage them in sin. But now for 
Fornication
 (he shews) the case is otherwise. This he proves, to be utterly unlawful, and that for six reasons. 
1.
 The body was not made for Fornication (as the belly was made for meats), but for the service of Christ, and ought to be imployed to his glory, who is ordained to be the 
Head of man,
 to govern both his Soul and Body, that both may be kept holy. For Christ was sent to redeem and sanctifie the Body, at well as the Soul, and consequently to rule and

 command it, being 
Lord
 of both. 
2,
 Our Bodies are not to be abolished and ut∣terly destroyed, but to be rais'd up to glory at the last day (as Christs Body was raised up) if we be such as truly believe in him, therefore they ought not to be 
defiled
 now, with Fornication. 
3.
 The faithful are 
Members
 of Christ, therefore they ought not to make themselves members of an Harlot. For as 
Wedlock
 makes Man and Wife one Body 
lawfully,
 so 
Fornication
 makes the Fornicator and the Har∣lot one Body 
unlawfully.
 As on the other side, he that is by Faith united to Christ is 
one Spirit
 with him, that is, is led and governed by one and the same Spirit, and becomes a Member of his spiritual and mystical Body. Therefore such a conjunction ought to be kept inviolable. 
4.
 Other sins abuse (chiefly and prin∣cipally) some object, that is, 
without
 the Body, (as the Drunkard 
wine, &c.
) but Fornication injuries the Body, that acts it, and that more than other sins. 
5.
 The Bodies of Believers are 
Temples of the Holy Ghost,
 (who dwells in them, being freely given them of God), and therefore they ought to be kept pure and undefiled. 
6.
 All true Believers and faithful Christians are not 
their own,
 but purchased with the Blood of Christ, therefore they should endeavour to glorifie God their 
Redeemer
 (whose they are) both in their Bodies, and in their Souls. 
From Ver. 12. to the end.


 Having done with the 
reprehensory
 part of his Epistle. He now resolves di∣vers 
Cases of Conscience;
 about which the 
Corinthians
 had written to him. As in the first place, concerning 
marriage,
 touching which he declares; 
1.
 That for those that have the gift of Continency, and can live pure, and chast without marrying, 'tis better for them so to do. But for the avoiding all sorts of unclean∣ness and p
llution, 'tis generally most safe, that men and women should betake themselves to the conjugal state. 
2.
 He shews, that married persons ought not to abstain from the conjugal society of Bed and Board, except it be by mutual consent, f
r a time only, and that upon great and extraordinary occasion; namely, when they desire to give themselves more solemnly to 
fasting
 and 
prayer;
 which time being ended, they should come together again; lest by long abstinence, Satan should gain advantage over them. But as to 
that
 which he had said before, 
viz. that it was
 (generally speaking) 
most safe that men and women do betake them∣selves to the conjugal estate,
 he would have them so understand him, that he spake it by way of 
permission,
 allowing 
them
 to marry that found their condition to re∣quire it; but not by way of 
precept,
 as if he commanded 
any
 to marry. For he could wish (if it were the will of God), that the 
Corinthians
 (who moved this Question), had the like gift of Continence which God had bestowed on him. But seeing this gift is not given to all, every one should consider how he is quali∣fied by God, as to this matter, namely, whether with ability to live chastly in a single life, or else had inclinations to marry; and accordingly should dispose of himself. Therefore to sum up what he had said, he tells them, that as to the 
unmarried
 and 
Widows,
 it was convenient they should abide in that estate, (if they could contain), because of the advantages of the single life; but if not, then it was better to marry, than to live inflam'd with sinful lusts. 
From Ver. 1. to 10.


2ly.
 He comes now to answer their other Case, about 
divorce,
 namely, whe∣ther it be lawful, where the occasion is not 
adultery,
 but, 
1.
 Only some disagree∣ments and discontents between the parties where both are Christians: or 
2.
 Because a Believer is yoked or married to an Infidel. For the 
first,
 he says, it is 
not lawful;
 in which decision, he only repeats an old command given by the autho∣rity of God, who in the institution of marriage established, that the married should be 
one flesh,
 and therefore should so continue: and not separate one from the o∣ther, 
Math. 19.6.
 Wher
fore he commands, that the Wife should not depart from her Husband, on the account of disagreements between them. But if she, pretending necessary reasons of departing, as 
danger of her life, &c,
 shall for a

 time depart, he commands, that either she endeavour to be reconciled to her Hus∣band, and so come to him again, or else abstain from a second marriage. And the Husband likewise, he commands, not to put away his Wife 
on any such account,
 or to give her cause to depart. For the second Case, seeing (as it seems) some among them held themselves polluted by being married to 
unbelievers
 (whom they had married before their conversion), and thought therefore of parting from them; He tells them, 
God
 had not determined in the 
Law,
 what should be done in such a Case, but 
he,
 by special revelation from the Lord, and the assistance of his Spi∣rit would determine it, namely, that 
they should dwell together, unbelief
 be∣ing no sufficient ground of parting. For the conjugal society of the 
unbelieving
 party is 
sanctified
 (that is, made lawful and allow'd) to the 
believing
 party, (to the pure, and believing all things being pure, 
1 Tim. 4, 5.
); and this he proves, because the Children born of such Parents, whereof the one is a Believer, and the other not, are 
federally holy,
 and are to enjoy the like priviledges, as if both Parents had been Believers
. But if the unbelieving party will not co-habit, but will depart, and on his side make void the bond of marriage out of hatred to the 
Faith,
 he declares that in such a case, the Believer or innocent party is free, and not bound by the bond of marriage any longer. But he tells them, God re∣quires that we should endeavour to live peaceably with all, and therefore the Be∣liever should use all peaceable endeavours to retain the unbeliever, and not give occasion of difference or departure; because by a peaceable dwelling together, the 
Believer
 may gain the 
unbeliever
 to the Faith of Christ, and be an instrument of his Salvation, 
[1 Pet. 3.1.]. From Ver. 10. to 17.




And now taking occasion
 from what he had said, concerning the conjugal state, namely, that 'tis not to be deserted, because of the infidelity of one of the parties, he disgresses to a 
general Doctrine,
 concerning the 
outward condition
 and 
state
 of men; and shews, that every one should be content with the lot and condition which God hath distributed
 unto him, and should frame himself to walk Christi∣anly in it, as he taught in all Churches.


Particularly he shews, that if any person that was before 
circumcised,
 be converted to Christianity, he should never trouble himself to get off that mark from his flesh, as some it seems did: nor on the other side, if any man that is 
uncir∣cumcis'd,
 be converted, he need not receive 
Circumcision,
 as some it seems re∣quired, 
Act. 15.1.
 For such outward things as these, he tells them, avail no∣thing now under the new Testament, or in the Church of Christ, who looks not on the outward condition of men, but on their obedience to his commands. Therefore he advises, that every one should abide contentedly in the Calling wherein he was called, and not think that 
Christianity
 frees him from any obligation that lay on him before. If a 
bond-man
 be converted, he should not think it a disparagement to his Chri∣stianity to continue a 
servant
 still, nor be solicitous of changing his condition: yet if by any fair regular means, he can obtain his freedom, he may make use of it. However let him know, that he that is called to believe in Christ, being a ser∣vant, is by the Lord freed from the bondage of sin and Satan; and he that is called being (as to his civil and outward estate) a 
free-man,
 is yet not exempt∣ed from subjection to Christ. In short, he tells them, that being dearly bought with a price by Christ
, they should not serve men in things repugnant
 to his commands, nor submit themselves to such a servitude, as their high-flown Do∣ctors
 would impose upon them.


Lastly, He urges again his former exhortation, that every one should content∣edly continue in the outward state wherein he was, when he was called, and not think of changing it, meerly on the account of Christianity, but holding to it, abide

 with God, and continue faithful to him in his Church, in which he reigns. 
From Ver. 17. to 25.


3ly.
 He comes now to the third Inquiry, that the 
Corinthians
 made to him, namely, concerning 
Virgins, Male
 and 
Female.
 And first, concerning such as are at their own disposal, whether they should marry or no? To which Question, before he gives his answer, he pr
mises, that he had no special command whereby the state of Virginity was either injoined or prohibited, but he would sincerely give his advice, as became him to whom God had vouchsafed mercy to be faithful. Then he gives his answer in three Propositions. 
1.
 That by reason of the present di∣stress, and danger of persecution, 'twas m st convenient, that those that were 
single,
 should so continue, if they have the gift of Continence. 
2.
 He declares, that if they marry they do not sin, only they will be like to meet with more troubles. But he would spare to speak any more to them of that matter, lest he should seem to disswade them from marriage more than was fit. However in this advice, he consulteth their qui
t and advantage. 
3.
 He advises, that whether they mar∣ried or not, they should consider, that the time is now but 
short,
 before persecu∣tion will arise, (possibly he means that under 
Nero
); insomuch, that they ought to have their affections very much moderated to all things in the world: Those that have Wives, should be as if they had none; those that weep, like those that do not; those that rejoice, as those that rejoice not; those that buy and purchase, as if they possessed nothing; and those that use this World
, as not using it
. For as a 
Scene
 which is soon changed, and shews a new face, so the fashion and shape of this present World is passing away, and the times are turning into very troublesome. He gives another reason, why the single life is to be preferr'd before the conjugal, namely, because single persons (comparatively) are more free from cares and distractions, and have (ordinarily) more time and lei∣sure to attend upon the Lord in religious exercises than the married have. For he that is 
unmarried,
 hath but one obligation of care, namely, how he may serve God most acceptably; but he that is 
married,
 hath another care on him, 
viz.
 how he may, in lawful things, please his Wife. And the like difference there is (as to this matter) between 
married
 Women and 
Virgins.
 A 
Wife
 is usually combred with houshold cares, and must, in lawful things, endeavour to please her Husband; and is not, upon that account, so free for holy exercises; but the 
Virgin
 (that has no family to care for) being freed from such distractions, and endeavouring to approve her self more eminently 
holy
 both in Soul and Body, she hath more leisure to attend on the Lord in holy and religious exercises. And what he spake concerning the advantages of a 
single life,
 he shews, he spake not that he might cast a snare upon them, or precisely to bind them to abstain from marriage, if they had not the gift of Continency, but to lead them to that which is 
fit
 and 
comely,
 that they may attend upon the Lord without distraction. 
From Ver. 25. to 36.




4ly.
 He comes in the next place to speak concerning Virgins, 
who are under the power of Parents and Guardians;
 and to answer the Question, Whether those Parents or Guardians may advise
ly give their Virgins in marriage? In an∣swer to this, he says, that if there be these three things in the case, 
1.
 If any Pa∣rent or Guardian be suspected to detain his Virgin longer from marriage than is ex∣pedient. 
2.
 If she have passed the fl wer of her age, and begin to be more than of ripe years. 
3.
 If he see the mind of the Virgin much inclin'd to marriage, then 
he advises,
 that the Parent or Guardian should please her therein, and consent that she should marry, and in so doing he sinneth not. But if the Parent or Guar∣dian be stedfastly perswaded in his mind, that he wrongs not his Daughter, or Pu∣pil, in declining to marry her, and sees no necessity to seek a Husband for her, so that he hath power over his own will
, (that is, liberty to determine of her, as to this case, how he pleases), by purposing in his heart to keep her unmarried, he says, he doth a thing very praise-worthy. Whereupon he concludes, that he that gives the Virgin in marriage (if the case be, as is before supposed), doth 
well.
 But if it be not, the Parent or Guardian doth 
better,
 that is, he d
th that which is more behoveful to the benefit of the Virgin, if he keep her unmar∣ried. So that there is sin in neither way, only greater conveniency on the one side than on the other. 
From Ver. 36. to 39.


5ly.
 A 
fifth case
 they propounded to the Apostle, was, Whether 
second mar∣riages
 of Widows were lawful, or no? He answers, 
they were:
 provided, 
1.
 The Widow marry 
in the Lord,
 that is, 
holily,
 and in the fear of God; and with such an one, whom she may marry by the Law of God; and with whom she may probably expect the blessing of God: but, 
2.
 Though it be lawful for her to marry again, yet by reason of the present danger of persecution, he thinks, she will be more happy and free from troubles, if she continue in her Widowhood. And he modestly insinuates, that his counsel is not less than 
divine,
 whatever their vain∣glorious Teachers might think of him. 
From Ver. 39. to the end.


6ly.
 A sixth Case of Conscience that they propounded to him, was, concerning 
 
eating things offer'd to Idols;
 which case he resolves, by answering three things that might be brought in the defence of it. 
1.
 They might suppose that they were all sufficiently instructed in the liberty allowed them by the Gospel, so that they might lawfully eat things offer'd to Idols. 
Answ.
 He answers, that a false opi∣nion of knowledg, or knowledg which is not temper'd with Charity, for the most part, occasions men to be proud, and to despise their weak Brethren; but know∣ledg join'd with Charity, applieth it self to the instruction of others, and accommo∣dates it self to the 
good
 and 
edification
 of others that are weak; and considers what is fit to be done in reference to them. And if any man hath such a kind of knowledg, that is not accompanied with Charity, he knoweth not 
all his duty,
 nor to what end he ought to refer his knowledg, nor how to use it as he ought; and so, up
n the matter, knoweth nothing in such sort, as he ought to know. But he that knows 
God,
 and truly loves 
him,
 and his 
Neighbour
 (according to his command), the same is known and approved of God. 
Ver. 1.2, 3.


2.
 They might say, They knew an Idol to be 
nothing,
 that is, 
no God,
 nor to have any divine power in it, and therefore meats cannot be made 
holy
 or 
pro∣phane
 by being offered to an Idol.




Answ.
 He acknowledges that an Idol is 
nothing
. For says he, though in the vain opinion of men, there be many caelestial and terrestrial Gods, and many Lords, or 
Baalim;
 notwithstanding 
we,
 that are divinely inlight∣ned, acknowledg but 
one
 
true God,
 the Father, by whose almighty power all things were made, and 
we
 for him
, that is, for his glory and service; and 
one Lord Jesus Christ,
 by whom are all things, namely, as co-working with his Father, 
Joh. 1.3. & 5.19.
 and we 
by him,
 namely, are redeemed and purchased. But all have not this knowledg, that 
an Idol is nothing
 but some even to this day, do Eat things offer'd to Idols, their Consciences sug∣gesting to them, that an Idol is 
something
, and that, things offer'd to them are thereby rendred the more 
holy,
 and so their weak and ill instructed Consciences, are (by so doing) defiled and polluted. 
From Ver. 3. to 8.


3ly.
 They might say, Meats are things 
so indifferent
 that neither eating bet∣te
, nor not-eating makes us worse; so that neither the 
one,
 nor the 
other,
 ma
s us more acceptable to G
d.


Answ.
 Th
 
 true indeed▪ unless in case of 
scandal;
 for in such a case, he sins who uses his lib
ty so, as it becomes a stumbling block to his weak Brother, and s
, is he doth thereby build him up, and encourage him in sin. As in the f
r
nt
t
 case, ly he that is weak, see another that hath knowledg, sit at meat, that is, at 
east in the Idol Temple, shall not the Conscience of that weak Christian be 
 
y the others example, to go on in this evil way? And so he is in dang
 of b
g encouraged in his 
heathenish error,
 and sin, and to have his mind by degrees a
i
nat
d from Christianity; whereas before, whilst he professed to be a Christian, he was in the judgment of Charity to be esteemed one of those, for whom Christ died. Now this confirming a man in his sin, and encouraging him to his after-commissions, whose Conscience was before erroneous, and his practice sinful, is, as if instead of curing a sick man (which Charity requires us to do), we should wound and hurt him more; which is not only an act of great unchari∣tableness against our Brother, but an act of injury and robbery against Christ, in betraying a soul to ruin (as much as in us lyes) and hindring his salvation, for the saving of whom Christ died
. He concludes, that he had rather for ever abstain from all kind of flesh, than be the occasion of the ruin, or damnation of any weak Christian; much more would he deny himself the use of his Christian liberty in 
indifferent
 things, in respect of the 
weak,
 (though not of the obstinate and wilful) and abstain, at a certain time, and place, from flesh offered to Idols. 
From Ver. 8. to the end.


 He further shews 
his readiness
 to abridg himself in his Christian liberty, and therefore exhorts them, by his 
example
 that they would do the like, especially in th
se things that appertain to the 
Belly,
 and particularly in eating things offer'd to Idols. The sum of his argument is this, I being an 
Apostle,
 and no less free than any other, do not only abstain from things lawful and profitable to me, but also accommodate my self to the infirmities of all; yea I keep under my body, by abstinence for the service of the Gospel. Therefore ye Corinthians ought to do the like. The 
Antecedent
 be proves from 
v. 1. to 24.
 The 
Consequent,
 is an exhortation carried on, 
to the end of the Chapter.


1.
 He shews that he had as much right to Christian liberty as any other, for he was an 
Apostle,
 he had been honoured with the sight of Christ, and was per∣sonally spoken to by him out of Heaven 
[Act. 22.18. 2 Cor. 12.2, 4.],
 and was immediately called by him to the Apostleship, and he had a Testimony thereof in

 their conversion, which was as a 
Seal
 confirming his Apostleship (at least among them), and afforded him a defence against those that called his Apostleship into Question. 
Ver. 1.2, 3.


2.
 He shews, he had power to eat and drink at the cost and charge of the Church, as well as others; that he had liberty to marry, and to take a wife, and lead her about with him, as some other Apostles had done, (particularly, those that were Christs Cousin-Germans, and Peter, 
Mat. 8.14.
): That he and 
Barnabas
 had power, as well as others, to forbear working with their hands at manual Trades, to get a livelihood; and might require maintenance from the Churches; it being a debt justly due to the Preachers of the Gospel; as be proves by several Arguments. 
1.
 By the 
Law of Nations,
 which appoints and allows to 
Souldiers, Vine-dressers,
 and 
Shepherds,
 and those that labour for the use of others, in their respective Callings, a due 
reward
 and 
wages:
 Why therefore should there not be a reward by the same reason, due to the Ministers of the Gospel. 
From Ver. 4. to 8.


2.
 He shews, he does not ground this, only upon 
human reason, equity,
 or 
custom,
 but upon the Provision made by God himself in the 
Levitical Law
 for the 
Ox that treadeth out the Corn.
 Now the end of Gods Law
 is not only to shew and prescribe how 
Oxen should be fed,
 but to enjoin, that 
equity
 should be used, in the just rewarding those that labour for us; that he that ploweth, and thresheth in hope of reward, should partake of his hoped-for reward, which encourages him in his work. Why then should not they that labour in the Gospel, partake of the fruit of their labours? 
3.
 From common justice. If the Apostles have sown unto them spiritual things, 'tis nothing but justice they should, instead thereof, reap of their carnal things. 
4.
 From the example of their 
other Teachers
 at 
Corinth,
 who made use of this power, which was as law∣ful for him to do, as for them; but he had forborn it, lest he should hinder the course of the Gospel. 
5.
 From the example of the 
Levites,
 to whom 
mainte∣nance,
 and a part of the Sacrifices was given by God for their ministry. Even so hath Christ ordain'd, (says he), that 
they who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel
. 
From Ver. 8. to 15.


Having thus asserted his 
liberty,
 he shews, his 
moderation
 in the use of it. He tells them, he had not h
¦therto made use of this power among 
them,
 (though from other Churches he sometimes received some liberality, 
2 Cor. 11.8.
), nor desir'd to do it; nor did he write these things, that 
that
 should be done for 
him,
 that was done for other 
Teachers;
 for he had rather dye, than that false Teachers should be able to take this honour from him, which was so justly due to him, namely, 
That he had preached the Gospel for sincere ends, and not sought what was due to him for his pains.
 He shews, that if he had preached the Gospel, meer∣ly out of respect to profit, he had had no cause to boast. For he was obliged to preach it by virtue of his office, and the command of God, which he must not dis∣obey; but if he hath done it 
willingly,
 and without respect to any worldly pro∣fit thereby, it will be rewardable. But if he hath done it unwillingly
 (as they do, who preach not out of any love to God, or desire of the conversion of Souls, and would not do it, if it were not for lucres sake) then it may be said, that a dispensation or office hath been com∣mitted to him, from which he is not to expect any glory or reward. This therefore was that which gave him hopes of a reward from God, namely, that he had preached the Gospel to the 
Corinthians,
 without being chargeable to them. For if he had received maintenance there, where his 
Reproachers
 endeavour'd to bring an ill report upon him, to the prejudice of the Gospel which he had preached
, then

 he should have abused his liberty in receiving of it. 
From Ver. 15. to 19.


He goes on to shew, how he did abridg himself in the use of his Christian Li∣berty; for though he was as 
free
 as any man, (being bound to none), yet he had made himself a servant to all, that he might gain the more to embrace the Gospel. For he had in a charitable condescention compli'd with the 
Jews
 (in cer∣tain external Ceremonies, 
Act. 21.21, 24, 25.
 who thought themselves bound to observe the Ceremonial Law), and that he did by the advice of the Council at 
Jerusalem,
 which left to the 
Jews
 (born under that yoke) a liberty to use those Ceremonies for a time, but in no wise to impose them on the 
Gentiles.
 When he had to deal with the 
Gentiles,
 (that were not born under the Ceremo∣nial Law), he abstained from the use of those Ceremonies, as if he had been without the Law, as they were; yet as to the 
Moral Law,
 or 
Law of Love,
 (which is the perpetual Law of God, and re-inforc'd by Christ, and requires us to love God above all, and our Neighbour as our selves), he did never account himself free from 
that,
 but only from the 
Ceremonial Law,
 from which indeed he was freed, and when he saw it for the advantage of the Gospel, he did freely abstain from the observance of it. When he had to deal with those that were 
weak,
 and doubted of their liberty, he abstain'd from things lawful, as they did. Finally, in all things 
indifferent,
 he accommodated himself to 
all men,
 that he might gain 
as many
 as possible he could, at least-wise, 
some.
 And this he did, that the Gospel might be better esteem'd among all, and more propagated, and that he himself might partake of the glorious eternal rewards promised therein, together with them to whom he had preached it, and who had effectually entertain'd it. 
From Ver. 19. to 24.


Hitherto he hath set before them his own example; now he c
mes to the ex∣hort
n which he infers from thence, namely, that the 
Corinthians
 would imi∣tate him in denying themselves. And particularly, that they would labour after 
emp
nce, and not so mind their Bellies, as to eat with offence 
that
 which was offerr'd to Idols. To th
s end he shews them, that Christianity is a 
race,
 and they must run carefully this race; in which, not only one (as was usual in their common races), but all that run (according to the Laws
 of God) shall be Crowned. And as those that contended in those famous Games (whether 
run∣ning
 or 
combating,
 usually celebrated neer to 
Corinth
), did not indulge them∣selves in gluttony and pleasures, but were temperate in all things, inuring them∣selves to a spare diet, by way of preparation, that the conquering Crown might be won by them: After the same manner, he would have the 
Corinthians
 to be moderate in the use of worldly things, and to abstain from whatsoever may hin∣der them in their Christian course, that they may attain an incorruptible and an eternal Crown.


And to press his exhortation yet further, he propounds his own example again, who first did so 
run,
 not as at 
uncertainties,
 or as if he did not aim at a certain Goal, or as if he knew not his reward, if he ran well; and secondly, did so 
fight
 (not as making a flourish only in the air like a fencer), but he did fight in good earnest, against the body
 of sin, and the old man, and the lusts of the flesh, that they might be subdued in him; and he denied himself in some 
indifferent liberties,
 that his body might be subject to his spirit: And all this, lest having prescribed to others the way of 
striving
 and 
getting the Crown,
 he himself should at last prove a 
Castaway
, or one unworthy to be approved or rewarded by God. 
From Ver. 24. to the end.


He comes now to treat of the 
eating of things offered to Idols
 under a 
 
twofold difference;
 the one 
publick
 in Idol Temples, simply 
unlawful. From ver. 1. to 23.
 The other 
private,
 in private houses, which (when there was no scandal in the case) was 
lawful,
 otherwise not, and accordingly he dehorts them from it. 
From ver. 23. to the end.




1. He disswades from a publick eating of things offered to Idols in 
Idol-Tem∣ples
 by several Arguments. 
1.
 If they preceed to be present at 
nd t
 partake of such id
latrous Feasts, they will be in danger to fall into such kind 
f sins, as the Israelites, on such an occasion fell into, and so consequently will expose them selves to such punishments as they suffered. He tells them that the Israelites
 (who came 
ut of 
Egypt
 with 
Mo∣
) were such to whom God vouchsased many high dig∣nations; as particularly they had the favour of the 
Cloud
 t
 over shad
w them 
[Exod. 13.21.]
 which was their protection and conduct, and they all passed through the red sea, 
Exod. 14.22.
 And by the 
Clouds
 
ver∣shad
ning them, and by their passage through the 
red Sea
 (both which possibly sprinkled them) they were 
baptiz
d,
 as it were, and 
confirm'd
 in a belief
 of 
Moses
 (the Typical Mediator) as a person imploy'd by God, and were obliged to obey his Doctrine, and the com∣mands which he should give them from God. And this w
s a figure to which our Baptism answers, by which we are confirm'd in the Faith of Christ, and obliged to profess him, own him, and obey him. He farther shews, that God fed them with 
Manna
 from Heaven, and gave them for drink, the 
water
 that flowed out of the Rock (which he caused to follow their Camp). And this 
Manna
 and 
water,
 he calls 
spiritual meat
 and 
drink,
 because they had a spiritual meaning, and did figure and signifie the same grace and benefits of Christ, which the 
Supper of the Lord
 doth to us; yet notwithstanding all this, he shews, that many of th
se 
Israelites
 (by reason of their inordinate lusts) perished in the Wilderness. N w th
se things, he tells them, were to be examples to the 
Corinthians
 and other Christians, that they do not indulge themselves in 
fleshly Lusts,
 as those ancient 
Israelites
 did, nor frequent 
idolatrous Feasts,
 (made in the honour of any Idol) lest they suffer the like punishment the 
Israelites
 did, who sacrificed to the honour of the Golden Calf, and rose up, and danced before it, 
Exod. 32.
 And they should take heed, that they mix not with 
Idolaters
 in their Feasts, lest they should be given up to 
Fornication,
 as the 
Israelites
 were in the Wilderness 
[Numb. 25.]
 with the Daughters of 
Moab,
 and so fell in one day three and twenty
 thousand. Further they should take heed of 
tempting
 Christ, and trying, as it were, how long his patience will last; as the 
Israelites
 provoked the 
Angel of the Cove∣nant,
 or 
Christ
 (who went before them in the Wilder∣ness, 
Numb. 8.21.
), and so perished by fiery Serpents. And Lastly, they should take heed of 
murmuring,
 because 'tis not lawful for them, by the Christian Religion, to be present at the Idolatrous Feasts of their Friends in the Idol Temples, lest they should perish with the murmuring 
Israelites,
 who for that sin were destroyed by the Angel of God, and perished by the plague, 
Numb. 14.37.
 Now he shews, that all these sins and judgments of the 
Israelites
 are 
Emblems
 of 
their
 state, and shew what will befall 
them,
 that do not beware of such sins; and these judgments are set down in the old Testament for warnings to Christians, who should live in the latter times. Wherefore he adviseth them to take heed of vain-confidence in themselves, and that those among them that seem∣ed to themselves to stand firmest, should be sensible of their danger, if they fed se∣curely upon things offered to Idols, in Idol-Temples. 
From Ver. 1. to 13.


But h
re they might object, that if they abstain'd from idolatrous Feasts, there was d
nger hung over their heads from their 
Fellow-Citizens,
 (that were Ido∣laters) who would interpret this forbearance, as an abhorring of their society. He answers, that 
that temptation
 was no other then what was ordinary to men. But God was faithful who would not permit them to be tempted above their strength, but w
uld open a way for them to escape those dangers, if they continued faithful to him, or else would so strengthen them that they should be able to bear whatsoever bef
ll them. Therefore he exhorts them to fly from that Idolatry which

 is join'd to the publick eating of things offered to Idols. And to excite their 
ttention, he tells them, he would make them Judges themselves (who were understanding men) in this matter, whether they must not necessarily commu∣nicate in th
t Idolatry, for which these Feasts were instituted, if they join∣ed in those Feasts: And first he reasons from the example of Christians com∣municating in the Lords Supper. For as all that partake in that 
Sacrament
 d
 pr
fess themselves, in that act, to have c
mmunion with 
Christ,
 and with 
such
 as profess Faith in him. S
 communicating in th
se 
Idol-Feasts,
 is no less a sign, and prof
ssion of communion with those 
Idols,
 to whom the Sacrifice was offered, and with 
those Idolaters
 that worship them. For as Christians, though many, yet by virtue of their society in the same worship, are compacted together, as it were, into 
one Loaf
 or 
Lump,
 that is, into one 
mystical Body
 (whereof Christ is the Head) in that they partake of 
one
 and the 
same
 Sacramental Bread; so those that communicate with Idolaters (in participating of idolatrous Sacri∣fic
s), by virtue of their Society in the same worship (signified by their idolatrous f
ting together in Idol-Temples) are compacted together, as it were, into one body, forasmuch as they communicate in 
one
 and the 
same
 Sacrifices.


2.
 He reasons from the like example of the 
present carnal
 
Jews,
 who had their Temple yet standing, and their 
Jewish
 worship in use. For as they, cating of the Sacrifices, did, in 
that,
 communicate with the 
Altar,
 and profess themselves Members of the 
Jewish
 Church, and worshippers of that God, whose the 
Altar
 was: So they that eat of Idol Sacrifices, in the idolatrous Feasts, have communion with those 
Idols,
 to whose honour they were instituted, and with 
those
 that w
rship them. He shews, he need not affirm, that an Idol was 
any thing,
 that is, had any thing of divinity in it, or that 
that which was offered in Sacrifice to Idols,
 was in it self, at all different from any other ordinary meat
. But the plain truth was, Those Sacrifices of the Heathens were Sacrifices to 
D
vils [2 Chron. 11.15.],
 and whosoever did eat of those 
Feasts,
 was supposed to join in those 
Sacrifices,
 and so to do service to Devils. Now the communicating with Christ in the Lords Supper, could not consist with communi∣cating with Devils in 
Idol-Feasts;
 for this were to do homage to 
two
 Lords, 
God
 and the 
Devil,
 and profess service to both. He concludes this matter, by sh
wing what desperate madness it was, to provoke the omnipotent God to jealousie, by j
ining Devils in competition with him. 
From Ver. 13. to 23.


Having thus resolved the case concerning 
publick
 eating of things offered to Idols, namely, in the Idol-Temples; He comes now to answer another Case con∣cerning 
private buying,
 and 
private eating
 of things offered to Idols. And first he pr
mises that all things (that are of an 
indifferent
 nature) are 
lawful,
 unless when it was not expedient in respect of our weak Brother to use them, or when they edifie not. And in the use of liberty, we must regard, rather the 
Sal∣vation
 of another, than our own temporal profit. Having premised this, he tells them, They may lawfully buy what is sold in the shambles
, and freely eat thereof, without any scruple of Conscience. And he gives them this reason for it, 
because, the earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof,
 that is, those things that are sold for food in the Market, are to be look'd upon as the Creatures of God, made for the use of man, and so lawful to the 
faith∣ful,
 if they be received with thanksgiving, 
1 Tim. 4.4.
 And the Devil hath no power over them, to contaminate or defile them by his Idols, if man himself do n
t do it, by same sin, and particularly by that of Idolatry. And therefore if any 
Believer
 be invited to a Feast, in the private house of an 
Unbeliever,
 he de∣clares, Th
 Christian may eat without scruple, any meat that is set before him: But if the Master of the Feast, or any other there present, shall suggest to him, that some part of the meat had been offered to Idols; in that case, he wills him to forbear, l
st he should encourage any man in idolatry. And the reason he gives is this, 
For the earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof,
 that is, there is

 plenty of other meat to be had, which God the Creator of all things, the Lord of the whole Earth hath allowed us the free use of, so that we may well let the 
Idol-Sacrifices
 alone. In such a case, the Christian should abstain for the sake of the 
other man's
 Conscience, lest he should, by his Example, be encouraged in Ido∣latry. But in other cases, where there is no such danger, they may freely eat without scruple, and none will have cause to blame them for it. If any do, their liberty 
allowed them by Christ,
 is unjustly condemn'd by such a mans Conscience. For if they, through the grace and favour allowed them in the Gospel, do eat in∣differently of meats set before them (where they see no danger of hardning any thereby in Idolatry) why should they be reproached for eating 
that
 which God allowes them; they receiving it with thanksgiving, 
1 Tim. 4 4.
 He concludes this whole discourse with these three excellent 
Rules,
 whereby they should govern themselves in the use of 
things indifferent. 1.
 They should always design the glory of God. 
2.
 They should do nothing that may tend to the 
hurt
 or 
just of∣fence
 of 
Jews, Gentiles,
 or 
Christians. 3.
 They should imitate the Apostles Example, who in 
indifferent things
 accommodated himself to all men; so as to seek their eternal Salvation, and not his own temporal profit or advantage. And so they should be followers and imitators of him, as He was of Christ. 
From Ver. 23. to the end. And Ver. 1. of Chap. 11.


Being now about to reprehend certain disorders in the Church of 
Corinth,
 he 
 begins with 
commendation
 of those among them who had written to him, and ask'd his advice in those particulars.


He commends them that they had been so mindful of the instructions and pre∣cepts he had delivered to them, concerning the matters appertaining to the publick worship of God, and had so closely adhered to them: yet notwithstanding, it seems, there were many things reproveable in several others of them. And so be pro∣ceeds to answer their next Query, which concerned 
decent behaviour
 of 
men
 and 
women
 in Church-Assemblies. In order to which, he tells them, 'tis fit they should consider the 
subordination
 of persons in the Church, 
viz.
 that as Christ, in respect of his Mediatory Office, is inferior to God the 
Father;
 but above all men (being Head and Lord of all men, as their Creator and Redeemer); so the 
Man,
 being inferior to Christ, is yet above the 
Woman,
 being her 
Head.
 From which they may understand, that order in Church-Assemblies is to be obser∣ved. Now, it seems, the 
Corinthians
 did not sufficiently observe this order, because the 
Women
 in their publick Church-meetings laid aside their Veil
, and the 
Men
 covered their Heads and Faces. He shews therefore, that every 
Man,
 that either makes the publick 
Prayer
 in the Church-Assemblies, or he
r
th, or joineth therewith; or 
Prophesieth,
 that is, expoundeth the writings of the Prophets, and opens the mysteries of Salvation, or 
heareth
 such expositions, or instructions; or joins with the Congregation in 
singing Psalms
 or Hymnes, having any 
covering
 on his Head, that is, ha∣ving his Head and Face covered, he dishonoureth himself, and does an 
indecent
 thing against the liberty and dignity of his 
Sex,
 it being a sign of 
shame
 and 
infamy
 for a man to have his head cover'd, but was a sign of 
power
 and 
dominion
 (in that Country)
, to have his Head, and Face bare and uncovered. Next he shews, that eve∣ry 
Woman,
 that lays aside her Veil in the Church-Assem∣blies, dishonours her self, doing a thing 
unbecomming
 her Sex, and against the dignity of the 
Man,
 to whom she (by that action) seems to deny subjection. Now he says, 'tis as 
unseemly
 for the Woman to be unveiled, as to be 
shorn
 or shaven, which would be a great disgrace to her, yea, against the mo∣d sty of her Sex, to wear her hair short as men do, her hair being given her for an ornamental covering, and as it were a natural Veil. 
2ly.
 The Image of God shineth most brightly in the 
Man
 (who is immediately his Image), 
viz.
 the Image of his Power and Majesty; and ought so to appear, by having his head un∣covered.

 But the Image of God shines more obscurely in the 
Woman,
 who is the image
 of the man, to whom she ought to profess sub∣jection by c
v
ring her Face. 
3ly.
 Another Argument of the inferiority of the 
Woman,
 he shews, is this, namely, that original y the Man was not 
of
 the Woman, but the Woman 
of
 the Man, 
v
z.
 made out of his Rib. 
4ly.
 The Man was not created to serve the Woman, or to be sub∣ject to her, but the Woman was created to be, a meet help to the Man, and to be subject to him. And for this rea∣son also must the W
man have a covering
 on her Head, as a sign of her subjection, and that she is under the power of her Husband, because the 
holy Angels
 are present in the Assemblies gathered together for the publick Worship of God, and therefore Women ought to do n
thing indecent and unc
mely in the presence of those pure and holy Spirits. Yet notwithstanding this inferi
rity of the Woman, the 
man
 ought not to despise her, for the man is not the cause of propagation without the Woman, nor the W
man without the Man; but 
both
 are 
con-causes
 there∣of, by the Law and Ordination
 of God
. And though the W
man in the Creation was made 
of
 the Man, yet according to the course of ordinary propagation, the Man is 
by
 the Woman, and both are equally the work of God. He further appeals to the common custom of those Countreys, and demands of them, whether it would not be unc
mely for men to wear long and dish
velled hair, like Women
, to whom Nature hath given 
long hair
 for an ornament, and a covering, and so to be a Token to them of their subjection. In Conclusion he says, that if any n
t moved with these Arguments, shall further contend a∣bout this matter, they should consider that other Churches of Christ have no Custom, that Women should be unveiled in their publick Assemblies; and why should they vary from the practice of other Christians? 
From Ver. 2. to 17.


He comes now to discourse concerning the right administration of the 
Lords Sup
r,
 and he blames the 
Corinthians
 that their coming together to celebrate that ordinance, was generally, not for the better, but for the worse. For he heard there were 
divisions
 and 
factions
 among them 
[1 Cor. 1.11.];
 nay 
Heresies
; which, considering the 
cor∣ruption
 of Man, and the 
malice
 of the Devil, he did not much wonder at, especially seeing God in his infinite wisdom permits it so to be, that the 
sincere
 among them might the 
r
 manifest their stedfastness. He tells them, that their behaviour when they met together on this occasion, was far different from what was becoming the cele∣bration of the Lords Supper, they not carrying themselves therein as if they were to celebrate a religious Feast
. For in those their Feasts of Charity (at the end of which the Lords Sup∣per was celebrated) they did not now observe the true Church-communion, but 
every one,
 that is, 
every fa∣ction
 or 
division,
 being come to the place of the Assem∣bly, did presently sit down to eat, what they had brought in the company of those of their own party, not minding or regarding others; whereupon this 
holy Feast,
 was

 neither celebrated at the 
same time
 by all, nor in 
holy con
ord,
 c
t
y to the true Ʋnion of Christians, signified thereby. And further, the 
po
r
 
re were excluded, while the 
rich
 f
ted, and in their feastings, drank t
o liberally, even unto drunkenness. He tells them, he could not praise them f
r this. If they had a mind to feast, they should do it at their own houses; and not dish n 
ur, and as it were, cast a contempt on the publick Assembly, by such irreligious carriage, nor so despise the Poor (which are part of G
ds Church) and put them to shame, by excluding them out of their Company for their poverty sake. For sith God admits them into his Family, and bids them to his heavenly ban
uet, they ought not to exclude them from this holy Feast. That therefore he may correct th
se misde∣meanours, he recites the 
primitive institution
 of the Sacrament, which he had formerly delivered to them, as he had rec
ived it from Christ by 
special revela∣tion,
 either when he was ra
t up into the third H
aven, or when Christ appeared to him at his first Conversion 
[Gal. 1.12.]; viz.
 That our blessed Saviour, in the night wherein he was betrayed, took Bread, and having, 
by
 
praising God for it,
 and 
imploring his blessing upon it,
 consecrated it to this holy use, he 
brake it,
 and bad them eat it, as 
that
 which should signifie and repre∣sent 
his body
, that should now speedily be broken for mankind. This he bad them do in remembrance
 of him.


In like manner 
after Supper,
 he took the Cup
 telling them, that the 
Wine
 contained in it, was a 
sign
 and 
seal
 of the 
new Testament
 or 
Covenant,
 that should be confirmed by his Blood, (which he was now presently to shed on the Cross), as the 
old Testament
 or 
Cove∣nant
 was confirmed by the Blood of Beasts sacrificed and sprinkled upon the people, 
Exod. 24.8.
 And as often as they 
do this,
 they would 
shew forth
 his death; which representation of his death was to be continued in the Church, till he come to judg the quick and dead. 
From Ver. 17. to 27.


Having declared the original institution of this Sacrament; he comes next, to instruct them in the 
right use
 of it. He tells them, that whosoever shall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord 
unworthily,
 that is, otherwise then is meet, and becoming so holy an ordinance, (particularly without such a disposition of mind, such a preparation of heart, such reverence and devotion as ought there∣in to be exercis'd) shall be guilty of 
prophaning this Sacrament,
 (which is the remembrance of Christs death), and of 
vilifying
 the 
signs
 and 
pledges
 of his body and blood. Therefore every man should duly examine himself, whether he be a fit guest for so holy, and heavenly a Table, whether he have a competent 
knowledg
 of the 
nature, signification, end,
 and 
use
 of this Feast, and 
dis∣cern
 how it represents the Lords Body; whether he truly repent him of his sins, have a lively Faith in Christ, and be in Charity with his Neighbours; such therefore as cannot examine themselves, are not to be admitted unto this ordi∣nance. And seeing the Apostle says, 
let him examine himself,
 and 
so let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup,
 we may observe from thence, that he calls it 
bread
 still, even after consecration. 'Tis 
bread
 still, though not 
ordi∣nary
 and 
common bread,
 whilst it is applied to this use. 
2.
 We see from hence that the Sacrament must be received in 
both kinds
 because Christ so instituted it, and to receive it otherwise is a palpable violation of his order. The Apostle fur∣ther

 d
clares, that he that eates and drinks 
unworthily,
 that is, 
ignorantly, irreverently, prophanely,
 is guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ, that i
, of prophaning that Ordinance, which he hath ordained for the representation 
f his death, (wherein his Body was broken, and his Blood shed for our sins) and so incurs the danger of temporal judgment and chastisement here, and without repen∣tance, of eternal hereafter, for hearing no greater respect to this holy action; nor discerning how this 
Bread
 and 
Wine
 represent the Lords Body, but coming to it as to an ordinary meal. And that this would be the Fruit of approaching unwor∣thily to this Table, he proves from the sad experience of the 
Corinthians
 them∣selves, upon some of whom God had inflicted 
diseases,
 and upon others 
death,
 for their prophaning of this Ordinance. Therefore this judgment ought to be prevented by their 
judging
 of themselves, and repenting and reforming. For when God in∣flicts those Chastisements on his own people, he inflicts them as f
therly Cor∣rections to bring them to repentance and reformation, that they may not perish with the World.


In closing up this matter, he exhorts them, that they would partake of this 
holy Supper
 together, tarrying one for another, and seems to forbid their 
Ag
p
e
 or 
Love-Feasts,
 that they used before the holy Communion, commanding that if need were, they should eat at home, to satisfie their hunger, and avoid the dan∣ger of prophaning this holy Supper, and so drawing down judgment on themselves. As for other things that concern'd the 
good order
 and government of their Church, he tells them he will take care himself when he comes to them. 
From Ver. 27. to the end.


 The next Case he handles, is concerning 
spiritual gifts,
 and the 
right use
 of them. It seems 
they,
 that excelled in them, were proud of them, and used them to vain-ostentation and discord, and not to their Brethrens edification. There∣fore he t
lls them, that as touching spiritual gifts, he would not have them ig∣norant, from 
whence
 they come (
viz.
 not from themselves, but all from 
one
 and the 
same Spirit
 of God), nor to what 
end
 they are given, and 
how
 they ought lo be 
used
 and imployed. He tells them, they may remember, they were once 
idolatrous Gentiles,
 serving dumb
 Idols, ac∣cording as they were led by their idolatrous Priests, and had nothing of this divine 
Spirit
 among them; but now they ought to be sensible, that their conversion from 
Gen∣tilism
 to Christianity, was the powerful work of this 
Spi∣rit
 of God. And 
this Spirit
 of God, he shews, does always glorifie Christ, and proclaim him to be 
God
 and 
Lord,
 and whosoever blasphemes Christ (as the un∣believing 
Jews
 did, and some vagabond Sorcerers) does not speak from this Spi∣rit. But he, that out of sincere affection, and true Faith, does profess that 
Christ is the Lord,
 he does it by the guidance and instinct of the Spirit of God. Ha∣ving premised this, he shews, there are diversities of gifts, such as 
prophesying, speaking with strange tongues, &c.
 (some more excellent than others) and diversly imparted, and in divers measures; but 'tis 
one
 and the 
same Spirit
 that distributes them all. There are also diversities of 
administrations,
 or offices, and functions in the Church, but 
one Lord Jesus
 who instituted them all, and who calleth 
one
 to this kind of Ministry, 
another
 to that. And further there are diversities of 
operations,
 or miraculous works, such as 
casting out Devils, &c.
 but 'tis the same 
God,
 namely, the 
Father,
 who by his Son, and holy Spirit worketh all these, in all them in whom they are wrought. But those divers spi∣ritual gifts (wherein the power of the Spirit is manifested) are given for 
one end, viz
 the edification of the Church, as he instances in 
nine
 kinds of them: 
1.
 The word of 
Wisdom
, whereby he can seasonably apply sound Doctrine to his Hearers; which is the gift of a Pastor. 
2.
 The word of 
Knowledg,
 whereby he can give the sense of the Scriptures; which is the gift of the Tea∣cher. 
3.
 The gift of 
Faith,
 or of Confidence and Courage in God, in great dan∣gers. 
4.
 The gift 
 
Healing. 5.
 The gift of working 
Miracles
 and power∣fully

 casting out Devils, and curbing the enemies of the Church, 
[See Act. 13.11.]. 6.
 The gift of 
Foretelling
 things to come, and rev
ling Secrets. 
7.
 The gift of 
Discerning
 Impostors, from those acted by the Spirit of God. 
8.
 The gift of 
Speaking
 with divers kinds of Tongues. 
9.
 The gift of 
Interpreting
 Tongues, though they had not the gift of speaking them: These two being diffe∣rent gifts. All these 
gifts
 worketh that 
one
 and 
same blessed Spirit;
 and the divers distributions of them, are according to the good will of God, Now that these spiritual gifts are to be used without discord, to the good of the whole Church, he proves, because the universal Christian Church, is but 
one spiritual body,
 where
f Christ is the Head. For all true Believers are by the power and effectual operation of the 
same Spirit
 ingrafted into Christ by 
Baptism,
 and so incorporated into one Body, of what state and condition soever they be, and are all made to drink one 
Cup
 in the Lords Supper, that they may be partakers more and more of the graces of one and the same sanctifying
 Spirit, who 
vivi
ies
 all the Members of that Body. So that all the faithful are joined together in the Sacraments of 
Baptism,
 and the 
Lords Supper,
 and their union into 
one Church,
 and their partaking of 
one Spirit,
 is signified thereby. And the diver∣sity of gifts given to the particular Members ought not to occasion any dissention or disagreement in the Church. This he illustrates by a comparison taken from the natural Body; the very condition of which does necessarily require 
plurality
 and 
diversity
 of Members. One Member, though never so excellent, does not make a Body; and the meanest Members are of the Body, and so to be reckoned, as well as the more excellent. Nay the more excellent Members, such as the 
eye
 and 
ear,
 have need of the inferior. And as God hath set the Members of the Body, each one in his place, and each one for its special use and service for the good of the whole: So he hath given diversity of gifts and administrati
ns to the Church, for the welfare of the whole. And as it would be repugnant to the nature of an 
or∣ganical
 Body, to be without divers Members
, so the nature of the 
organical
 Church would be overthrown, did it not consist of many Offices, as of so many Members, u∣nited together in one Body. Therefore the superior Mem∣bers must not pride it over the inferior: for those Members of the Body that seem most feeble and weak, are necessary to the others. The Organs of nourishment, though they be not so noble, yet are they more absolutely necessary than those of the Senses, for without them, Man cannot subsist or live, as he may without Eyes, Ears, or Hands. And those Members of the Body, which seem to us less honourable
, on them we put more abundant honour by decent clothing them, and on our uncomely parts we put more abundant adorning by a decent covering them. For our comel
 parts, such as the 
Face,
 have no need of covering or adorning, being comely enough of themselves; But God has so dis∣posed the several parts of the Body, that some shall have a natural comeliness, or beauty; others that want 
that,
 shall be supplied by 
Clothes,
 which are an artificial Beauty: By all which, he shews, they should be instructed, that the meanest 
Officers,
 and those that have the 
least gifts are
 as well of that spiritual Body the Church, as those that have more excellent Offices and gifts. And as the meaner must not envy the more excellent, and so, in a dis∣c
ntent, withdraw themselves from the Body, and forbear to imploy themselves for the common good of the whole; so the more excellent must not despise the meaner, but put a due respect and value upon them. And as the natural Body would come to ruin by 
Schism,
 if the Members should strive am
ng themselves, and should not regard the welfare of one another; so great mischiefs must needs arise to the Church by dissentions. But on the contrary, as in the natural Body, there is a sympathy
 among the superior and inferior Mem∣bers, a fellow-feeling with each other, both of joy and grief; so all the true Members of the Church, of what degree soever, ought to have the same common interests,

 and concernments, and mutually to sympathize with each other, both in weal, and we. All this from 
v. 12.
 the Ap stle applies to the believing 
Corinthians,
 whom he acknowledges to be a part of this 
mystical
 Body of Christ, whereof each Believer in particular is a Member, who ought therefore so to carry himself to∣wards his fellow-members as is shewen in the former comparison, namely, as the Members
 of the natural body do towards one ano∣ther. And having spoken so much of the diversity of gifts and Ecclesiastical administrations (of which be had sp
ken in the general, 
v. 5.
) he now comes to reckon up the particular 
officers
 that God hath set in his Church. 
1. Apostles,
 as those that were appointed to lay the foun∣dation of Churches. 
2. Prophets,
 who interpreted the Prophetical parts of the Scripture, by a special and extra∣ordinary gift. 
3. Teachers,
 namely, such who are ordinarily called to interpret the Scriptures for the edification of the Church. 
4.
 Such as are endowed with power to work 
miracles
 of 
various kinds,
 and particularly of punishing enemies to the Gospel 
5.
 Such as have this power restrained to the 
cure of Diseases. 6. Helps,
 that is, such as were to take care of the mainte∣nance of 
Ministers,
 and the 
poor,
 namely, 
Deacons. 7. Governments,
 that is, Ruling Elders (as some learned men understand it, according to 
Rom. 12.8. 1 Tim. 5.17.
), who are to take care of the peoples manners, with the Pastors and Teachers. Lastly, Such as were inabled to speak strange Tongues, or to inter∣pret them. In conclusion, he shews, that seeing the Ministers of the Church have not all administrations of the 
same kind,
 nor of equal dignity; therefore those that have the highest, ought not to despise those who are of a lower degree; neither ought these to envy the other, and so contend one against another, but all of them ought to imploy their gifts for the common good of the Church. And in or∣der hereunto he advises them to lay aside all 
evil emulation,
 and to covet the m st excellent gifts, namely, such as are most useful and profitable to the Church. And he tells them, he will shew them a more 
excellent way
 than that they were in, which is this, to lay aside all contention, pride, and envying one another, and to order all their actions by the rule of 
Charity.


 Now for 
Charity,
 he proves it to be the most excellent gift, and for to surp
ss all other gifts by four Arguments. 
1.
 He shews them, that the gifts they were so ambitious of, were nothing without Charity. This he proves by instancing in five sorts of them. 
1.
 Suppose a man had the gift of Tongues in the highest de∣gree, so that he could speak all the Tongues that any men in the World were ever able to speak, or that the Angels
 themselves would speak, if they con∣versed with men, yet if he have not Charity, he makes only an unprofitable sound, and a vain ostentation. 
2.
 Suppose he had the gift of Prophesie in the highest degree, so that he could understand the darkest mysteries of the Scripture. 
3.
 Sup∣pose he had the highest degree of miraculous Faith
, so that he could remove Mountains. 
4.
 Suppose he had the greatest liberality towards the poor imaginable. 
5.
 Sup∣pose he had the greatest courage for martyrdom that ever any had; yet all these without Charity will not profit him, or conduce to his Salvation. 
From Ver. 1. to 5.


2.
 He shews, the superlative excellency of 
Charity
 from the famous properties, and effects of it, which are fifteen in number. 
1.
 It suffereth long. 
2.
 Is kind. 
3.
 Envieth not. 
4.
 Vaunteth not it self, that is, carrieth not it self insolently, mal
partly, and scornfully towards others. 
5.
 It is not puffed up, that is, highly conceited of its self. 
6.
 Doth not behave it self unseemly, that is, is not transported to a carriage unbefitting ones place, calling, or age. 
7.
 Seeks not only her own but the good of others. 
8.
 Is not easily provoked to Anger. 
9.
 Think∣eth no evil, 
that is,
 is not rashly suspitious, or imputes no evil to any man un∣justly.

 
10.
 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, that is, rejoiceth not in other mens sins, but is sorry for them. 
11.
 Rejoices in the truth, or with the truth, that is, rejoi∣ceth at the righteousness
 of the righteous. 
12.
 Cou∣ragiously bears labours and difficulties in discharging its duty, or covers and conceals
 all the ill it knows of others, unless when 'tis greater Charity to reveal it. 
13.
 Be∣lieveth all the good of others, which 
rationally
 it may, or hath any ground to believe. 
14.
 Hopeth all things, that is, hopes all things of the amendment of others, that in prudence it can hope. 
15.
 Endures all the infirmities of others; or endures all things which may with a good Conscience be endured, and which make for the honour of God, and the advantage of the truth, without meditating revenge. 
From Ver. 5. to ver. 8.


3ly.
 He shews, the excellency of Charity, from the permanency thereof. Cha∣rity never fails. This he illustrates by comparing it with other gifts. 
1.
 With 
Prophesie,
 and 
Tongues,
 which shall cease, because we shall not have use of them in the other life, though here they are needful for the edification of the Church. 
2.
 With 
Knowledg, viz.
 that imperfect knowledg which we here ob∣tain by the ministry of the Word. For our knowledg now is but imperfect, in comparison of the knowledg of divine things, which we shall have in the life to come. And so likewise that gift whereby God enableth us to instruct others, is but imperfect, and shall then cease, because we shall have no further use of it. But when the perfect knowledg of divine things shall come, then our imperfect gifts which served to promote knowledg in this life shall cease. He illustrates this, by a twofold similitude; 
1.
 By comparing 
this life
 to 
childhood,
 and the 
fu∣ture
 to the 
manly state,
 wherein childish things are abolished. 
2.
 By shewing there is as great a difference betwixt our present knowledg in this life, and that which we shall have hereafter, as between one that seeth the image of anothers face in a Glass, and one that beholdeth the face it self. Here we know God in his 
Word
 and 
Works
 as in a Glass, by reflection; but there we shall know him 
intuitively,
 and immediately. And as there is a great difference between propounding a thing darkly and as a riddle, and propounding the same thing in plain, proper, and express words. So here we see as by a Glass, or in a Riddle, but then shall we know God face to face, that is, clearly and perfectly. And as for himself, who was an Apostle, and had been rapt up into the third Heaven, he acknowledges he knew but in part for the present, but hereafter he assured himself, his mind shall be so inlightned by God, that he shall see him and know him immediately, as God now sees and knows him, though not so perfectly. In Conclusion, he tells them, that in this life, these three emi∣nent Graces do operate in the hearts of Believers 
Faith, Hope,
 and 
Charity;
 Without 
Faith
 we cannot be justified, without 
Hope
 Faith cannot stand, and by 
Love
 Faith must be operative. But of these three, the greatest is 
Charity. 1.
 In respect of its 
extent,
 reaching to God, good Angels, our Brethren, our Enemies. 
2.
 In respect of its 
use,
 extending to the good of 
others;
 whereas 
Faith,
 and 
Hope
 are only private graces. 
3.
 In respect of its 
duration,
 be∣cause 
Faith
 and 
Hope
 shall cease in the other life; 
Faith
 shall be swallowed up in 
Vision,
 and 
Hope
 in 
Fruition,
 but 
Charity
 shall abide for ever. 
From Ver. 8. to the end.


And seeing 
Charity
 is so excellent a grace, he shews, they should very care∣fully 
 labour for it; yet spiritual gifts also they should earnestly and zealously desire, especially that of 
interpreting the Holy Scripture,
 as the most useful for the edification of the Church. It seems, some among them much affected the gift of Tongues, and despised Pastoral gifts in comparison thereof. He therefore proves the gift of Prophesie, or Exhortation, to be more excellent than the gift of Tongues, separated from the gift of Interpretation. For he that speaks in an unknown

 Tongue
, although by the gift of the Spirit, he speak the mysteries of God, yet he speaks without profit, because he is understood by God alone, and not by his Hearers
. But a Prophet, or a Pastor speaking in a known T
ngue, teaches, exhorts, comforts his Hearers, and so speaks pro∣fit
bly, and to their edification. He that speaks in an unknown Tongue, edifies none but hims
lf; but a Prophet speaking in a known Tongue, speaks to the edification of the whole Church, or Assembly. He wishes they all spake with Tongues, but prefers 
Prophesie
 as m
re useful to the Church, except it be joined with Interpretation. This he amplifies, by instancing in his own person, who he says, should not profit them meerly by speaking to them in an unknown Tongue; but if he spake 
intelligibly
 to them, that is, either revealed things to come, or communicated his knowledg in the deep mysteries of Religion, and the sa∣cred Figures; or interpreted the prophetick part of the Scripture; or in a plain Catechistical way instructed them in things they were to 
believe
 and 
do,
 then indeed he should speak to their profit. This he further illustrates, by a similitude taken from 
Musical Instruments,
 the one used in 
peace, viz.
 the 
Harp;
 the other in 
war, viz.
 the 
Trumpet;
 telli
g them, that as 'tis ordinarily seen in the world, if the 
Harp
 sound something n
t understood, a man cannot apply himself to the dance; or if the 
Trumpet
 give not such a sound as is understood, a man cannot prepare himself to the Battle: so those that have the gift of a strange Tongue, if they do not utter words intelligible to the Auditors, they will nothing edifie them by what they say; their words will be only unprofi∣tably poured out into the air. There are, it may be, he tells them, as many Voices or Languages in the World, as there are Nations
; so that none of them are without some Language
 which they understand, and ordinarily no other. Now, says he, if he that hath any of these Languages, speaks to me in any Language but that which I understand, and I speak to him also in a Language which he understands not, we shall be 
Barba∣rians
 one to another. Wherefore he exhorts them, that of all spiritual gifts, they would most earnestly desire the gift of 
Prophesie,
 for the good of the Church. And in order hereunto, he advises, that he that hath the gift of an unknown Tongue, should pray
 that he may be inabled so to interpret that Tongue, that others may profit thereby. For, says he, if I pray in an unknown Tongue, my 
Spirit prayeth,
 that is, I make use of my gift which I my self understand, but that understanding of mine is no way use∣ful to others. I will tell you therefore what seems most desireable to me in this case, Namely, that if I pray by the gift of the Spirit in an unkn
wn Tongue, I may add an interpretation, and so pray with 
under∣standing
 also, 
that is,
 so as others, which hear, may understand; and if I sing praises to God by the gift of the Spirit, in an unknown Tongue, I may add an in∣terpretation that the hearers may understand and pro∣fit thereby. For else when any man shall bless God in an unknown Tongue by the gift of the Spirit, how shall ordinary persons in the Congregation give their consent, by saying 
Amen
 to what he says. For the hea∣rers (that cannot understand) are not edified, nor can go along with the thanks∣giving, though that which is spoken be v
ry 
xcellent. He t
lls them, he had the gift of Tongues in a larger measure than any of them (and he knew how to value that gift) yet he had rather speak a few words so as to express and in∣terpret his understanding and meaning to others, than many in a T
ngue unknown to the people. In sum, he shews them, that a vain ostentation of things that tended not to profit, was but a childish thing. Indeed in innocency they should imitate little Children, but in 
understanding of things spiritual
 they should

 approve themselves to be men. He farther shews, out of the 
Law,
 that is, the Scriptures of the Old Testament, 
(See Joh. 10.34.),
 and particularly out of 
Isa. 28.11.
 that because the people of 
Judah
 would not be instructed by the plain preaching of the Lords Prophets therefore he would cause them to be spo∣ken to in an unknown Language for a punishment of their unthankfulness and ob∣stinacy, that is, he would visit them with outlandish Enemies and Armies, whose Language they should not understand. So that strange Tongues, except they were interpreted, were not given for a sign of any good to Believers, but they were gi∣ven as a sign of Gods displeasure to unbelievers 
(f)
 in∣somuch that by the just judgment of God,
 their ignorance by this means w
uld be the more increased. But the gift of 
Prophesie
 serveth not only for the 
conversion
 of un∣believers, but for the 
edification
 of Believers also. There∣fore Prophesie is t
 be preferr'd before Tongues. Moreover, when the Church meets together, if all that speak should speak in a strange Tongue, what will an ordinary man, or an unbeliever (coming into the Congregation) think or say? Will he not think them all mad? But if all that speak, do Prophesie and interpret the Scripture, and open the Doctrine of Christ to the edification of the Church; in such a case, if an un∣believer come in, he is convinc
d of sin, and condemned according to the sentence of the Law, by all those that Prophesie, and the secret sins of his heart are made manifest unto him, and so falling d
wn he will adore God, and seriously give testi∣mony to G
ds presence with the Prophets of the Church. Therefore Prophesie is more excellent than the gift of Tongues. 
From Ver. 1. to 26.


He now comes to give several precepts concerning 
good order
 in the Church, and particularly to prescribe certain rules which they should observe as to the use of gifts. And first says he, when y
u come together, hath any of you a 
Psalm
 or 
Hymn
 suggested to him by the Spirit, to the glory of God and the edification of the Church? or hath any one of you a 
Doctrine,
 a particular instruction, or matter of consolati
n inspired into him by the spirit? or hath be a 
strange Tongue;
 or the gift of interpreting into the 
Greek
 Tongue, what another spake in a strange Tongue, (p
ssibly the 
Hebrew
)? Let it be how it will, he exhorts, that all be d
ne so as may most tend to the benefit and edification of the Church. His s
c
nd Precept is, that those that were inabled with the gift of Tongues should not speak in one and the 
s
me Assembly,
 one h
re and another there, to the confusion of the Company, that no more than 
three
 should speak at one time, and that n
t together, but by course one after another, and that too, when there was an Interpreter present, (whō could explain in the vulgar Tongue, what they said) otherwise he that had the strange Tongue sh
uld be silent in the Church, and keep his Tongue to himself, and use it at home betwixt God and himself in private prayer. And accordingly he directs concerning those that 
prophesied,
 to wit, that only two or three of them sh
uld Prophesie at one meeting, and that the other Pr
phets should judg and examine their Doctrine by the rule of the Word. Yet if any Prophet who sate by, desired to be heard, (while the other was speak∣ing), in order to the opening s
me difficulty then before them, the Apostle orders that they should permit him so to do, and that the other that was speaking should be silent. For all the Prophets that were extraordinarily inspired by the Spirit were to be heard, (provided order was duly observed therein), that so the knowledg and consolation of the whole Church might be ther
by promoted. And he tells them, the Spirits of the Prophets, that is, the Doctrines which the Prophets bring, are to be judged and examined
 by the other Prophets, whether they be agree∣able to the word of God or no. And these rules be exhorts them diligently to ob∣serve, lest a tumult, and confusion should arise among them, which is hateful to God, who requires that peace should be kept, and maintained in all the Churches of his Saints. 
From Ver. 26. to 34.




And for the further carrying on of 
good order
 among them, he forbids that 
Women
 should speak publickly, or propound any Questions in the Church, because subjection is appointed by the word of God for that sex 
[Gen. 3.16.],
 of which 
silence
 is a token. And therefore they should learn privately at home of their own husbands, and seek instructions from them in the things they doubted of. He further shews, that if any of their high-crested Doctors, or others among them, will not submit to these Precepts, but take upon them to order otherwise, and to suffer Women to speak in the Congregation, contrary to all other Churches, they should consider that they are not the first Church, that was planted from which the Gospel came forth to other places, as it did from 
Jerusalem,
 nor were they the on∣ly persons to whom the G
spel was sent, that they should take upon them to Judge of order and decency, and therein to differ from all other Churches. He affirms that these Precepts he hath given them are from the Lord, and commands that those who esteem themselves Prophets, and persons that have any spiritual gift or 
afflation,
 should acknowledg them to be divine. And for others that affect to be ignorant, he leaves them to be ignorant at their own peril. In fine, he exhorts them, earnestly to endeavour after the gift of Prophesying; and for the gift of Tongues, that they that have it should be allowed the use of it, provided they observed the rules by him before given. And that in their publick Assemblies for religious worship, all things should be performed with 
gravity
 and 
decency,
 as may most conduce to the glory of God, and the edification of the Church. 
From Ver. 34. to the end.


 He comes now to assert the Doctrine of the 
Resurrection,
 there being some, it seems, in the Church of 
Corinth
 at that time that denied it. And first by way of Introduction, he recites the 
sum
 of the Gospel which he had preached to them, which they had embraced; and in the profession whereof, the greatest part of them had hitherto stood stedfast, and by which, he tells them, they shall be sa∣ved
, if they faithfully retain and observe it, as he delivered
 it unto them: and this he assures himself they will do, except their former embracing the Gospel was rash, light, and inconsiderate. He tells them, that he delivered unto them what he had received of 
Ananias,
 and the Apostles, and by special revelation from Christ himself 
[Gal. 1.12. 1 Cor. 11.23.]
 namely, that Christ the true 
Messias
 died to make atonement for our sins, as 
Esay
 and 
Daniel
 had foretold in the Old Testament, 
[viz. Isa. 53.5. Dan 9.26.].
 That he was buried and rose again, as was prefigured in 
Jonas.
 That he was seen of 
Cephas
 or 
Peter, Luk. 24 34.
 Then of the Twelve ga∣thered together, 
Luk. 24.36.
, (for so the Compa∣ny of Disciples, consisting formerly of 
Twelve,
 was still called, though 
Judas
 was gone to his own place, and 
Tho∣mas
 was now absent). Then of Five hundred Brethren at once in 
Galilee, [Mat. 28.7.16.],
 whereof some were yet alive, and able to testifie it. Besides, he was seen of 
James,
 then of 
all the Apostles [Joh. 20.26.], Thomas
 being with them, and pos∣sibly the greatest part of the Seventy Disciples present also. Last of all, he tells them, he was seen of himself, whom in great humility he calls an 
, an 
untimely birth,
 because he was not by leisureable institution brought to Christi∣anity, whereby he should be as a natural birth, but was as an untimely birth, by reason of his sudden and unexpected conversion, and which was not without some some violence, 
Act. 9.
 And as an untimely birth
, is not fit to be called a birth, because Children that are so born, are very imperfect, being lesser, and weaker than those of full growth, so says 
Paul,
 I am a poor 
abor∣tive,
 one whose conversion was after the Lord was as∣cended into Heaven. And as an abortive Child is the

 least of Children, so he reckon'd himself the least
 of the Apostles, not wor∣thy to be called an Apostle because he had persecuted the Church of Christ. H
w∣ever, says he, by the grace and favour of God 
I am what I am,
 that is, a be∣lieving Christian, and an Apostle; and so my t
stimony to be received as well as that of the other Apostles: And his grace which was bestowed on me was not in vain. For being by his special favour, constituted an 
Apostle,
 I have since la∣boured to walk worthy of it, and have been more lab
rious and industrious than any of the other Apostles; yet what I have done, I do not attribute to my self, but impute intirely to his gracious assistance, that inabled me, and went along with me. Therefore, whether you l
ok upon 
me,
 or upon 
them,
 (to whom he appe
red here on the Earth, and so were eye-witnesses of his Resurrection), you can 
ave no ground to doubt 
f this truth; for both they and I preach the same things, 
viz. that Christ died for our sins,
 and 
rose again,
 and 
that we shall rise again by his power;
 and this is the Doctrine that you 
Corin∣thians
 once believed and received. 
From Ver. 1. to 12.


2.
 Having promised these things, He comes now to refute the Error of those that denied the Resurrection, shewing the absurdity of it in 
six particulars. 1.
 If there be no Resurr
ction of the dead, then Christ the 
Head
 is not risen. For if the Head be risen, he will certainly raise up his M
mbers also. 
2.
 If Christ 
e not risen, then the Ap
stles preaching, and so strongly asserting. 
His Resur∣rection
 as an i
fallible argument of the divinity of his Doctrine was in vain: (for if it had not been divine, God would n
t have so confirmed it, and as it were set his S
al to it, by raising him from the dead on the third day); and then 
their
 belief of it was in vain also. 
3.
 Then 
Paul
 himself, and the other Apostles had given a false testim
ny of God (which they could not reasonably be suspected of) affirming, that 
he raised up Christ from the dead,
 which yet he did not, if there be no Resurrection of the dead. 
4.
 If Christ be not raised, it will thence follow, not only that the 
Faith
 of these 
Corinthians
 was vain, but that they are yet in their sins, and subj
ct to condemnation for them; and that Christ hath not expiated them. For it would be an evidence he had not satisfied for them, if he still remained under death. 
5.
 If Christ be not risen, then they which died in the Faith 
f Christ, are quite lost, seeing they were not delivered from their sins by him. 
6.
 Then Christians are of all men m
st miserable, who subject themselves, f
r the cause of Christ, to many sufferings, and dangers, and afflictions here; and deprive themselves 
f many comforts and advantages which they might otherwise enj
y, if they expected only from him the good things of this life
, and had no h
pes to be raised by him to a better, when this is ended. 
From Ver. 12. to 20.


Having thus proved by these arguments, that Christ is risen, he shews, it will from hence follow, 
that the dead in Christ shall rise also.
 For as the first Fruits
 are 
pledges
 and an 
earnest
 of a future harvest; so the Resurrection of Christ is a pledg and assurance of the Resurrection of all the Saints. For as death came by 
A
am,
 so shall the Resurrection come by 
Christ.
 As by 
Adams
 s
n, all that are partakers of his Na∣ture are concluded under the sentence of death; so all truly reg
nerate that are by Faith united to Christ, and are partakers of his divine Nature, shall be made alive again by him. For the righteous he will raise as 
their Head,
 and the wicked he will raise as 
their Judg.
 But here it will be objected, If Christ the Head be risen

 Why are not those that are in Christ raised also? He answers, that the order which God hath appointed must be observed, 
viz.
 that Christ as the 
first Fruits
 should rise first, and afterwards 
all the Faithful,
 (the rest of the harvest) at his Second Coming; at which time, (when the end of the World will be) Christ having subdued and abolished all adverse powers and dominions that were contrary to him, will deliver up his Mediatory Kingdom into the hands of his Father, lay∣ing aside that manner of ruling, by those means, he now useth for the gathering, and governing of his Church. Not that he shall cease to reign with his Father, (for in that sense, 
Of his Kingdom there shall be no end
), but he shall cease to reign as 
Mediator,
 and as deputed by his Father. Yet he must reign as 
Me∣diator
 till he have subdued all his Enemies, whereof 
death
 will he the last; and death being subdued, the resurrection must needs follow. Now that all enemies shall be subdued under him, the Apostle manifests, because God the Father hath promised that 
all things shall be subject unto him [Psal. 8.6. Eph. 1.22. Heb. 2.8.],
 yet we are always to suppose, that he hath not thereby devested him∣self of his 
Soveraign Empire,
 but under the word 
All,
 He himself is excepted, who hath subjected all things else to his Son. And when all things shall be thus subdued to Christ, and his Mediatory Kingdom delivered up to his Father, then the Son himself, as 
Mediator
 and 
Head
 of his Church, 
[See 1 Cor. 12.12. Eph. 1.12.],
 shall he subject unto him. And then shall God the 
Father, Son,
 and 
Holy Ghost,
 fill all the Saints with glory and bliss eternally and 
imme∣diately,
 whereas now He conveys himself to them by 
means. From Verse 20. to 29.


He further proves, there will be a Resurrection of the dead. For else, what benefit will accrue to those 
who are baptized for the dead?
 that is, that suffer great persecution
 for 
professing, asserting,
 and 
de∣fending
 the Resurrection of 
some that are dead, viz.
 of 
Christ,
 (whose Resurrection is past), and of the 
Saints
 (whose Resurrection is to come): For so the word 
to be baptized
 is taken, 
Mar. 10.38.
 and the Praeposition 
, signifies 
for, Act. 9.16.
 'Tis absurd, therefore, he shews, that they who suffer martyrdom, for defending the Resur∣rection of the dead, and expecting of it, should be disap∣pointed of their hope. And why should he himself, and other Christians, run the hazzard of so many dangers, and death it self, if there were to be no Resurrection, wherein their patience and courage for Christ shall be rewarded? He protests by 
that,
 which he t
ok the most joy in of any thing in the World, 
viz. his fidelity to Christ,
 and the 
success of his ministry among them
 (they being thereby brought to believe and rejoice in Christ) that he died daily, (in preparation of mind) being daily exposed to the hazzards of death; which sure he should not do, if he had not an assured hope of a Resurrection to a better life after this. To what purpose was he expos'd to fight with 
beasts at Ephesus
, and to run such a hazzard of his life as that was, if he had no hope of a better life after this, and of a glorious Resurrection? And further, If there were no Resurrection, then there was some sense in 
that wild saying
 of the 
Epicures
 among them, 
Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall dye;
 that is, 
Let us take our fill of pleasures, while we may; for shortly death comes, and will put an end to all, See Isa. 22.13.
 But he bids them take heed of attending to such 
rotten kind of speeches,
 which might corrupt them with false principles, and vicious manners. He advises there∣fore such among them, as were sleeping in their ignorance and sottish security, to rouze up themselves, and to awake

 to 
righteousness, viz.
 to live righteously, and to avoid 
Epicurism,
 and the company of 
Epicures.
 For he tells them, there were some such among them, which had not the right knowledg of the true God, which he spake to their shame. 
From Ver. 29. to 35.


He now comes to answer three Objections against this Doctrine.


Object. 1.
 It seems impossible the dead should arise. For, 
How shall it be?


Object. 2. Who can describe with what bodies they shall arise?


Object. 3. What shall become of those that are alive at the Coming of Christ?
 For they are not capable of a Resurrection who never died.


To the 
first
 he answers, that 'tis as possible for the Body to rise again, as for 
Corn sown
 to be quickned after it dies in the earth.


To the 
second,
 he says, that our Bodies shall arise the 
same in substance,
 but not 
in qualities.
 They shall rise with far more excellent qualities, than those they were buried with. As a bare grain of Corn that is sown, is raised in substance and kind the 
same,
 but 
diverse
 in qualities, coming up with 
blade,
 and 
ear,
 and 
corn
 in it: It does not rise in the same figure in which it was sown. Seeds are sown and 
rot,
 yet notwithstanding they are so far from perishing there∣by, that they rise up far more beautiful; and whereas they are sown 
dry
 and 
hard,
 they spring up 
green
 and 
fresh:
 So why should it seem incredible, that our Bodies should arise from corruption, and yet with far more excellent qualities than they had before? And as there are several kinds of 
flesh,
 and one more excellent than another; and as 
celestial
 Bodies, are more glorious than 
terrestrial,
 and one celestial Body differs from another in glory; so it will be in the Resurrection. The Bodies that rise, will differ from those that dyed. That which was here a corruptible Body, when it rises, will be an incorruptible. The Body that was here obnoxious, and exposed to diseases, griefs, and death, will be raised glorious and strong, beautiful and shining, like unto the Stars, and the Sun in the Hea∣vens 
[Math. 13, 43. & 17 2.].
 That which was sown a 
natural
 or an 
ani∣mal
 Body, which needed here to be supported, as other animals are, with meat, and drink, and such things as afforded nourishment to it, shall be raised a 
spi∣ritual
 Body, endued with spiritual qualities, not needing meat, or nourishment, but shall be supported immediately by the Spirit of God without means, as the Angels in Heaven are, 
Math. 22.30.
 So that there are Bodies of 
both these sorts,
 which much differ one from the other. And as from the 
first Adam,
 (according to 
Gen. 2.7.
) we received a 
natural,
 or 
animal
 Body, which yet could not be continued in life without nourishment; so by the 
second Adam,
 name∣ly 
Christ,
 we shall obtain a 
spiritual
 Body in the Resurrection, which he will sustain without nourishment by his Spirit, He being a 
quickning Spirit
 And as since the Resurrection, Christ hath a 
spiritual
 Body, which is immortal and incorruptible; so shall he also give 
such Bodies
 to those that are 
his.
 Yet all things must be done in order; we must have a natural Body first, and a spiritual Body after, as that which is perfect follows upon that which is imperfect. The 
first Man
 is of the earth, 
earthly,
 and therefore could communicate nothing but a 
terrene
 life. But the 
second Man,
 is not only 
man,
 but 
God
 from Heaven also, and therefore could support his own Body, that it should not see corruption (though in its own nature terrene and resoluble into dust); and having raised it out of the grave he could make it glorious, immortal, and heavenly, not need∣ing

 earthly supports. And so in like manner can he make our Bodies also. Such a Body as 
Adam
 himself had, such have all we, (who d
scended from him in a natural way), as long as we are upon the earth. And such a Body as Christ now hath (namely, glorified, immortal, and incorruptible,) shall 
Believers
 have, after they shall be raised from the dead, and shall be taken up into Heaven. And as here we are conf
rmable to the 
first Adam,
 in 
mortality
 and 
corruptibility;
 so shall we hereafter be conformable to Christ in glory and immortality. F
r our Bodies, as now they are, cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, unless they be first fitted f r that glori
us state, by the mutation of their qualiti
s, and be chan∣ged, purified, and immortalized. 
From Ver. 35. to 51.


He now answers the 
third
 Objecti
n, namely, 
What shall become of those who shall be found alive at Christs coming?
 As f
r those, he tells them, they shall not 
dye,
 but shall be 
ch
nged,
 and of mortal sh
ll become immortal, and that in a moment, when both all that are dead, and all that are alive shall be summoned by the last Trumpet to Christs Tribunal. And when this is done, then that triumphant speech of the Prophet 
Hosea
 shall be ful
illed, 
chap. 13.14, O death, I will be thy plagues! O grave, I will be thy d
struction!
 that is, Death shall be destroyed for ever, and shall never rec
ver strength again over any man. And that this Victory may appear the greater, he shews, that the 
sting of death is sin,
 and the strength of sin, 
is the Law,
 that is, Ʋnless 
satisfaction
 be given to the Law, 
sin, wrath,
 and 
death
 remain in full force and power. But after satisfaction is made to the Law for us, 
sin
 and 
wrath
 are taken away, and 
death
 is disarmed of its sting. From the wh
le that he hath said, he infers two things; 
1.
 That God should be highly praised, who hath 
through Christ
 given us Victory over 
Sin, D
ath,
 and the 
Law. 2.
 That we sh
uld he 
st
dfast
 and 
unmoveable
 in the pr
f
ssion of the G
spel, and in do∣ing and suffering the will of God, being assured there will be a 
Resurrection,
 at which our labour will be recompensed and graciously rewarded. 
From Ver. 51. to the end.


 He shuts up the whole Epistle, giving some directions concerning their colle∣ction f
r the po
r Saints at 
Jerusalem, how
 and in 
what manner
 it should be made, and 
how
 sent. Particularly he orders, that on the 
Lords day
 every one should 
l
y something by,
 as God had prosper'd him, that there might be a full sum c ll
cted, and so no further need of gatherings when he came. And he tells them, that when he c
mes, they shall chuse the 
Messengers
 who shall carry their contribution, that they may be sure of the due disposing of it, according to their own intentions. And those whom they shall chuse, he will by his 
t∣ter recommend and send to 
Jerusalem;
 or if it be thought needful for hims
lf to go al
ng with them, on this occasion, (as he did sometimes, 
Act. 24.17. & Rom. 15.25.
), he declares his willingness to do it. 
From Ver. 1. to 5.


He tells them, he designed to come to them, assoon as he had spent some time in the several parts of 
Macedonia.
 For he intended to remove from 
Ephesus
 where he now was, and to go to 
Jerusalem,
 through that Region. And perhaps he would stay the whole Winter with them, which being done, he supposed some of them would go some part of the way with him. And ther
fore he would not now come to them, and only see them as it were in passing. For if he did s
, he should not be able to stay; whereas his purpose was, (with the Lords leave) to spend some time with them, when he next came. At present he pur∣posed to stay at 
Ephesus,
 till 
Pentecost,
 because God had opened a great door, and opportunity to him for the gaining of many to Christ, and had abundantly blessed his labours. Yet there were many adversaries in that place, that oppos'd the truth, which made his presence requisite for some time longer; For Satan and his instruments in his absence did much harm. 
From Ver. 5. to 10.




He charges them that if 
Timothy
 come to them, they should take care of his safety among them, and that they would look upon him as they would on 
hims
f,
 because of his faithfulness in the ministerial work, and that they would treat him him respectfully and bring him on in his journey, when he returned, that he might come safely to him; for he and the Brethren expected him. 
Ver. 10, 11.


He acquaints them that 
Apollos
 was not willing at present for some reasons to come to them, possibly because he would not countenance a Faction there begun under his name 
[1 Cor. 1.12.]. Ver. 12.


He exhorts them, to 
watchfulness, stedfastness in the Faith, Christian courage,
 and 
Fortitude,
 and that putting away 
Schisms
 and 
Division,
 they they would make 
Charity
 the 
Arbitrator
 of all things among them. 
Ver. 13, 14.


He makes honourable mention of 
Stephanas
 and his Family, as those that re∣ceived the Gospel at the first preaching of it in 
Achaia,
 and first gave their Names to Christ, and have since addict
d themselves to the ministry of the Saints, being very serviceable and bountiful to them on all occasions. He exhorts them to honour and respect
 such, and all others that join with them in the propaga∣tion of the Gospel and Faith of Christ. 
Ver. 15, 16.


He tells them, he was glad of the coming of 
Stephanas, Fortunatus,
 and 
A∣chaicus
 unto him, who had acquainted him with the 
Schisms
 among them, and all other matters of importance, and so had done that which they themselves ought to have done. He tells them, 
they
 had much refreshed his Spirit, by acquainting him, that there were so many yet among them that adhered to the truth; and 
they
 had (he supposed) refreshed 
their
 Spirits, by sending them word of the conti∣nuance of his great affection towards them. He would have persons of such in∣tegrity as they were, much esteemed among them. 
Ver. 17, 18.


He comes now to the Conclusion of his Epistle, wherein he sends several saluta∣tions unto them from the Churches of 
Asia;
 from 
Aquila
 and 
Priscilla,
 and all the Christians in their Family, who wish'd them all spiritual blessings from Christ. He wills them to salute one another with the kiss of Peace and Charity, with which 
Believers
 (according to the custom of those Countries and times) used to salute one another. He adds his own salutation with his own hand, the rest of the Epistle being written by some Scribe, 
See 2 Thes. 3.17.
 He adds also one remarkable 
sentence
 with his own hand, which he would have them especially to take notice of, and re∣member, (as 
Augustus
 used to d
 when he wrote to the Governours of Provinces) namely this, 
If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ,
 (that is, be a 
se∣cret
 or 
open
 opposer of him and his Gospel), 
let him be accursed: Maranatha,
 the Lord cometh. As if he should have said, Let him be reserved to the last judg∣ment of God, 
Jude v. 14, 15. Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his Saints to execute judgment, &c.
 In which sentence he threatens 
ut∣ter destruction
 to wilfull 
opposers
 of Christ, and 
hypocrites
 (except they re∣pent): not out of any evil passion of mind, but out of an holy zeal, and an Apostolical Spirit. He concludes all with his wonted benediction, and the sig∣nification of his love to them. 
From Ver. 19. to the end.








SECT. VIII.


APollos
 being unwilling for the present (as we have heard, 
Sect.
 7.) to go to 
Corinth,
 but chusing rather, as it seems, to go to 
Crete,
 (now call'd 
Candia), Paul
 thought good by him and 
Zenas,
 (a Doctor of the Law) to write an Epistle to 
Titus,
 whom he had left in that 
Island,
 further to propagate the Gospel, to ordain 
Elders
 in every City where the Gospel was propagated, and to finish what was lacking, and conducing to the good of that people, which the Apostle himself had not time to do. And understanding that many in that Island ambiti∣ously aspir'd to the 
Pastoral
 charge; and that several 
false Teachers,
 erroneous in judgment, and scandalous in life, had already crept in, to the great hurt of the Church; he writes this Epistle to 
Titus
 (which is of like argument with the First and Second to 
Timothy
) to direct him how to carry himself in reference to that people, and the work he was to do there.


In this Epistle there are three parts,




1. A
 Preface.


2. The
 Substance or matter of the Epistle.


3. The
 Conclusion.




1.
 THE 
Preface
 is contained in the four first Verses; wherein we may observe, 
1.
 The 
Person writing
 this Epistle, who is described by his office, A Servant of God, and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, for the propagating the 
Faith
 of Gods Elect, (namely, Faith in Christ), and the 
knowledg
 of the truth which tends to godliness, and this in hope of eternal life to be attained thereby, which the Righteous God promised long ago
, in the First Ages of the World, 
[viz. Gen. 3.15.],
 but now hath more clearly manifested by the preaching of the Word
, which was committed to him, among others, by the command of God, who gives us Salvation by Jesus Christ, 
[See 1 Tim. 1.1.]. 2.
 The 
Person written to,
 viz. 
Titus,
 descri∣bed by his spiritual relation to 
Paul,
 who converted him to the Faith, which is the common means of Salvation, both to 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles. 3.
 The 
Salutation it self,
 wherein are the Blessings prayed for in 
Titus
's behalf; 
viz.
 Grace, Mercy, and Peace from God. 
From Ver. 1. to 5.


2.
 He comes then to the 
Body
 of the Epistle; wherein, 
1.
 He tells 
Titus,
 for what end he left him in 
Crete,
 namely, to set in order the things that were wanting in those new planted Churches, to ordain 
Elders
 in every City, as he had appointed him, 
v. 5. 2.
 That he might not err in the 
choice of fit men,
 he tells him, how they should be qualified. The Qualifications of an Elder, which he sets down, may be reduced to three Heads:





1. Oeconomical.




1.
 That he be blameless.


2.
 The Husband of one Wife, and not guilty of 
Polygamy.


3.
 That his Children be brought up in the Faith, and in good order, and obedi∣ence.


4.
 That he be a Lover of Hospitality, and be ready to receive and entertain Strangers, and the banished Servants of God. 
ver. 8.




2. Moral,
 set down



1.
 Negatively.



1.
 Not self-will'd.


2.
 Not soon angry.


3.
 Not given to Wine.


4.
 No striker.


5.
 Not given to filthy lucre, 
v. 7.




2.
 Affirmatively.



1.
 A lover of good men.


2.
 Sober.


3.
 Just.


4.
 Holy.


5.
 Temperate, 
v. 8.






3. Ecclesiastical.




1.
 That nothing be found in him unworthy of the 
Steward
 of God, who ought to be so much the more blameless, by how much his office is more holy.


2.
 That he be studious to know the truth, and tenacious of the truth, when known, and that for a double end:



1.
 That he may be able to feed the Flock with right knowledg, and vi∣gorously to exhort them to the perfor∣mance of their several duties.


2.
 To convince 
gain-sayers,
 and to stop their mouths.








And he shews, that great care should be taken, that Persons 
so qualified
 should be chosen, and that both in respect of the 
false Teachers,
 that did at that time abound in their Island, as also in respect of the people of 
Crete
 themselves. The 
false Teachers
 he describes by their 
evil manners,
 declaring them to be 
unruly, vain-talkers, deceivers,
 especially those of the Circumcision, 
viz.
 the 
Jewish Doctors,
 who taught things they ought not; and subverted whole houses for fil∣thy lucre's sake. 
Ver. 10, 11.


As for the 
people of Crete;
 he shews, that one of their own 
Poets,
 viz. 
Epimenides
 (held by them for a Prophet) hath set forth the disposition of that Nation, 
viz.
 that they are 
lyars, given to idleness, serving their own in∣temperance;
 which Character he acknowledges to be too true, (namely, as to the generality of them), and thence inferrs, that the false Teachers that were among them, (and others also who were misled by them) must not be handled too mildly, but reproved, and 
rebuked sharply
, that they may submit themselves sound in the 
Faith,
 and to the Doctrine of the Gospel, and may not give heed to 
Jewish Fables,
 and the Commandments and Traditions of men, which turn many from the truth; of which sort he instances in 
one, viz.
 the distinction of 
meats,
 as clean and unclean; which he shews is against the liberty which Christ hath purchased, and allows to all that truly believe in him. For, 
unto

 the pure all things are pure;
 that is, to true Believers, whose hearts are pu∣rified by Faith, all kinds of meats are lawful; but to the 
impure
 and 
unbe∣li
vers
 'tis quite otherwise; nothing can be used purely by them, their minds and consciences being defiled with sin, and not purged from their guilt by Faith in Christ. And he further tells them, that though some of these 
false Teachers
 may seem to be religious, and profess to know God, yet in their works they plainly deny him: being abominable hypocrites, rebels against the truth of God, and un∣meet for the performance of any good work which he requires. 
From Ver. 5. to the end.


 
3ly.
 He proceeds to direct 
Titus,
 touching the faithful discharge of his Mi∣nisterial office: injoining him,


1.
 More 
generally,
 That he speak the things that become sound Doctrine.


2.
 More 
particularly,
 he directs him how to accommodate himself to several sorts of persons.


1.
 To teach 
old men
 to be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, charita∣ble and patient.


2.
 To teach 
ancient women
 to be in all their behaviour and deportment as be∣cometh persons that profess holiness; not false accusers, not given to drinking or tippling, but teachers of good things, and that they be exemplary to the younger wo∣men, and teach them their duties, 
viz.
 to be sober, to love their Husbands, to love their children; and to be discreet, chast, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own Husbands, that the Name of God be not blasphemed, nor the Christi∣an Religion be thought to infuse any thing into them contrary to moral vertue.


3.
 To teach 
young men
 to be sober-minded. And upon occasion of this dire∣ction, he gives 
Titus
 himself (who probably was now young as 
Timothy
 was) his lessons, exhorting him to be exemplary in his 
life
 and conversation, (in all things shewing himself a pattern of good works), and in his 
publick Doctrine
 or preaching, to shew incorruptness, gravity, sincerity; and in his 
private dis∣courses,
 sound speech, that cannot be condemned; to the shaming and silencing of opposers. 
Ver. 7, 8.


4.
 To teach 
Servants
 to be obedient to their own Masters, to please them w
ll in all lawful things, not answering again, nor murmuring or repining at their just commands, reproofs, or corrections; not purloining or stealing, but shewing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour by a consci∣entious discharge of their duties. 
Ver. 9.10.


And he adds a further reason, why all sorts of persons should labour to dis∣charge their respective duties faithfully, because the 
grace
 of God manifested in the Gospel, bringing and offering Salvation, hath now appeared to all sorts of persons, (which before was only manifested to the 
Jews
) teaching them to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live 
soberly, righteously,
 and 
godlily
 in this present world, expecting eternal Salvation and bliss, (the blessing which all good Christians hope for) and the glorious Coming of Jesus Christ to judgment, (who is here called the great God), who gave himself for us that he might re∣deem us from the guilt of all our iniquities, and 
so justifie us,
 and purifie us unto himself, and make us a peculiar people, zealous of good works, and 
so san∣ctifie us.
 These things he commands 
Titus
 to press with all authority, that none may have any just cause to despise him. 
From Ver. 11. to the end.


 
4ly.
 He directs him to exhort all sorts of Christians to these duties; 
1.
 To be subject to civil Powers and Magistrates
. 
2.
 To be ready to every good work. 
3.
 Not to revile any man. 
4.
 To be no Brawlers. 
5.
 To be gentle towards all, even the worst of men; and the reason he gives for it, is this, Be∣cause



 we (says he) before our conversion were such as others now are; in which carnal state whilst we lived, we were 
foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy,
 and would not have thought our selves well dealt with, to have been imperiously and roughly handled: what therefore, we would not that men should have done to us, when we were such; let not us do to others, that now are, as we then were. But when the transcendent mercy and loving-kindness of God towards lost sinners, was effectually manifested to us by the preaching of the Gospel, then there was a blessed change wrought in us. Yet the cause of this change was not any thing in us, or 
any works of righteousness done by us,
 but meerly the free grace of God, which mov'd him to rescue us out of that wretched miserable estate, and to work a work of regeneration in us, whereof 
Baptism
 is the 
outward visible sign,
 and the 
Holy Ghost
 the 
inward invisible worker;
 whom Christ hath obtained of the Father, that he should be sent down and imparted unto us, and should dwell in us, (not 
essentially
 but 
energetically
) abundantly illuminating, guiding, strengthning, and comforting of us. And the end of God herein is, that being 
justified by his grace,
 that is, by Faith in his Son, we should be made heirs of eternal life, according to the 
hope
 which the Promises of God have given us thereof. 
From Ver. 1. to 8.


5ly.
 He directs 
Titus
 to inculcate this into his Hearers, with firm and solid reasons, That true 
Believers
 ought especially to be careful to employ themselves in good works, and to go
 before others in the practice of them; because these things are profitable not only to others, but especially to themselves, seeing God of his grace will reward them for them. 
2.
 That they should avoid foolish questions and disputes about 
genealogies,
 and contentions about the various interpretations of certain places in the Law; because these things are unprofitable. 
3.
 That they should reject, 
that is,
 avoid, shun, and refuse communion with an 
Heretick,
 who does pertinaciously persist in great and dangerous errors, and labours to draw Disciples after him, 
(see Act. 20.30.),
 after they have once and again admonished him; concluding that such an one is perverted, and sinneth grievously
, inflicting that punish∣ment on himself, which the Church is wont to inflict on those that are guilty of great misdemeanours, 
that is,
 cutting himself off from the Church, of which he is a Member. 
Ver. 10, 11.


6ly.
 In the Conclusion of the Epistle, he speaks of private business; he orders 
Titus
 that when he shall send 
Artemas
 or 
Tychicus
 to supply his absence there, he should make haste to come to him to 
Nicopolis,
 where he did intend to winter. That he should bring 
Z
nas
 and 
Apollos
 on in their way (who were coming to him), and supply them with moneys and other necessaries for their journey. And he orders, that not only the faithful among the 
people,
 but that the 
Prea∣chers
 themselves, and those of the Pastoral Order should look to it that their Faith be accompanied with Charity and good works, and that they excell therein upon all necessary occasions. Such (among others) are, friendly to entertain and dismiss strangers, especially those that labour in the Gospel; lest whilst they exhorts others to good works, and to bring forth the fruits of Faith, they themselves should be found un∣fruitful. Lastly, with salutation sent to 
Titus
 from the Brethren with him, and desiring him to salute all the Christians in 
Crete
 who loved him, and the Brethren with him, for the common Faiths sake, and with such a love as the Christian Faith requires. He concludes all with his Apostolical Benediction. 
From Ver. 8. to the end.








SECT. IX.


THE Apostle by his Epistle had ordered 
Titus
 to meet him at 
Nicopolis,
 (a City in 
Thracia,
 not far from 
Philippi
 in 
Macedonia,
 where he intended to winter), but afterwards upon some reasons having altered his mind, he now sends for him to come to 
Ephesus;
 and from thence not long after sent him to 
Corinth,
 that he might by him know the state of the 
Corinthians,
 and what effect his first Epistle had had among them.






SECT. X.


IN the mean time 
Demetrius
 a Silversmith (who made 
silver Shrines
 for 
Diana,
 or 
little Models
 of the famous Temple there, with the Image of 
Diana
 in them, (which strangers which came thither, used to buy, and to imploy to a superstitious use) fearing that if 
Pauls
 Doctrine prevailed, he should lose his profit; he called together the workmen of the same craft, (whereof it seems, he had many that wrought under him), and shewing them the danger they were in, lest their trade should come into contempt; he greatly exasperated them against 
Paul,
 as one that taught the people, that 
those were not gods which were made with hands,
 and one that cried down the worship of 
Diana,
 whom 
all Asia,
 and other parts of the world
 had in so high veneration: A 
great hubbub
 was hereupon raised, and the enraged multitude cried down the Doctrine of 
Paul,
 and cried up the 
Goddess
 of the 
Ephesians;
 And in this hubbub they seized upon two of 
Pauls
 com∣panions, 
Gaius
 and 
Aristarchus
 [See 
Rom.
 16.23. 
Col.
 4.10.], and drew them into the 
Thea∣ter. Paul
 seeing nothing likely to ensue from this popular tumult, but the present destru∣ction of himself and his 
fellow Christians
 (See 2 
Cor.
 1.8.), if the providence of God did not wonderfully prevent it, thought he must attempt something (though with evident pe∣ril to himself), for the rescue of his Friends out of that danger (
see
 1 
Joh.
 3.16.). And therefore he was about to have adventur'd himself into the 
Theatre
, there to have made an 
Apology
 for 
himself
 and the 
Christian Religion
 to the people; but the Disciples ear∣nestly disswade him from it. And some of

 the 
Asiarchae
 sent to him, and gave him the same advice, who it seems privately fa∣voured his Doctrine, and were secretly his friends. The hubbub therefore continuing and the rude people being enraged (as it seems) against the 
Jews
 (as enemies to their heathenish worship), as well as against the 
Christians,
 the 
Jews
 caused one 
Alexander
 a 
Jew
 to come forth, and to speak to the peo∣ple in justification of 
their Nation
 and 
Religi∣on,
 and as 'tis probable, to cast the occasion of all this discontent on the 
Christians.
 But when the people understood he was a 
Jew,
 they would not hear him, but with a wild confused noise cried up their 
goddess Diana
 for two hours together. At length the 
Town-Clerk
 coming forth to the people, by his wisdom appeased the 
tumult,
 representing to them, that their Religion and the worship of 
Diana
 was so publickly known, and so generally approv'd in the world, that there needed no tumult or uproar to vindicate the same, as 
Demetrius
 suggested. And as for these men they were now so enraged against, he tells them, they had offered no violence to the Temple to demolish it, nor had defaced any of the Images in it
, nor had spoken evil of the 
Goddess Diana,
 that he knew of. How∣ever, if 
Demetrius
 and the Artificers that de∣pend on him have any matter of accusation against any of them, he tells them, the 
Court-days
 are come, and the 
Proconsuls
 Officers or Deputies are ready to assemble, from whom they may seek for justice. And therefore they had best be quiet, and do nothing rashly; for they were in danger already to be call'd in question and 
fined
 by the 
Romans,
 for that days 
riot.
 And having thus appeased them, he perswaded them peaceably to return to their own homes.


Act.
 19. 
v.
 23. And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.


v.
 24. For a certain man, named Demetrius, a Silver-smith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen:


v.
 25. Whom he called together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.


v.
 26. Moreover, ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost thorowout all Asia, this Paul hath perswaded and turned away much people, saying, That they be no gods which are made with hands.


v.
 27. So that not only our craft is in danger to be set at nought: but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.


v.
 28. And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.


v.
 29. And the whole city was filled with confusion, and having caught

 Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Pauls companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.


v.
 30. And when Paul would have entred in unto the people, the disci∣ples suffered him not.


v.
 31. And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent un∣to him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theater.


v.
 32. Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused, and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.


v.
 33. And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.


v.
 34. But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours, cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.


v.
 35. And when the town-clerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of Ephesus is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image that fell down from Jupiter?


v.
 36. Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.


v.
 37. For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of Churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.


v.
 38. Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies; let them implead one another.


v.
 39. But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.


v.
 40. For we are in danger to be called in question for this days uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this con∣course.


v.
 41. And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the Assembly.


























SECT. XI.


PAul
 having thus by the wonderful providence of God es∣caped this danger (at which he seems to point, 2 
Cor.
 8, 9, 10.), not long after, calling the Brethren together, he took his leave, and departed from 
Ephesus,
 to go into 
Macedo∣nia,
 leaving 
Timothy
 there, (who was come again unto him from 
Macedonia
), to carry on the work of the Gospel in that place.


Act.
 20. 
v.
 1. And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and imbraced them, and departed for to go into Mace∣donia,


1 
Tim.
 1. 
v.
 3. As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine;


v.
 4. Neither give heed to fables, and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.






SECT. XII.


ABout this time (as 'tis conceived) 
Aquila
 and 
Priscilla
 leave 
Ephesus,
 and return to 
Rome,
 having ventured their lives here to save 
Paul,
 as he himself gratefully acknowledges 
Rom.
 16.3, 4. Many other 
Jews
 also from other quarters re∣turned to 
Rome,
 as is intimated 
Act.
 28.21. the Edict of 
Clau∣dius
 the Emperor for their expulsion thence, now after his death wearing out of date.






SECT. XIII.


FRom 
Macedonia Paul
 first goes to 
Troas,
 where though there was a door opened to him of the Lord to preach the Gos∣pel, yet being troubled because he found not 
Titus
 there, (whom he had sent to the 
Corinthians,
 with another Brother, greatly desiring to know their state), he staid not long in that place; but because he neither heard from 
Titus,
 nor any other, how his 
first Epistle
 had took with the 
Corinthians,
 he thought it best to go directly into 
Macedonia
 (2 
Cor.
 2.12, 13.); which he tra∣velled over, from place to place, exhorting the Brethren with much exhortation, 
Act.
 20.2. And when his afflictions there were nothing abated, but 
without
 were 
fightings
 and contentions from false Brethren, or open Enemies; 
within
 were 
fears,
 lest all did not go well at 
Corinth;
 at last 
the coming of Titus,
 and the joyful message he brought concerning the Liberality and Charity of the 
Corinthians
 did much comfort and revive him, 2 
Cor.
 7.5, 6. by whose example he provokes and stirs up the 
Macedonians
 to provide Collections to be sent to the poor Saints at 
Jerusalem,
 2 
Cor.
 9.2. And the 
Macedonians
 being moved

 by this example, though labouring under many pressures and afflictions, beyond their power shewed themselves liberal. 2 
Cor.
 8.1, 2, 3, 4.






SECT. XIV.


THE Apostle having understood from 
Titus
 the present state and condition of the 
Corinthians,
 sends him to them again; and with him, 
the Brother whose praise is in the Gospel thorowout all the Churches,
 2 
Cor.
 8.18. (supposed to be 
Luke
), and ano∣ther whom he commends for his great diligence, 2 
Cor.
 8.22. And by them he sends his 
second Epistle
 to them. For though his first failed not of a good effect among many of them, yet some vain-glorious Teachers persisted in their contumacy, and not only vilified the Apostles authority, but presumed to com∣pare themselves with him, yea, to prefer themselves before him, to the no small detriment and prejudice of the Gospel. And out of their ill will towards him, they interpreted all his 
sayings
 and 
doings
 to the worst sense. He had promised in the latter end of his former Epistle to come to them shortly. But for certain reasons he did yet forbear to come. This they in∣terpreted as an argument of 
levity
 in him. He had in his fifth Chapter commanded the 
incestuous person to be delivered over to Satan.
 This they interpreted as an argument of his over-great rigorousness and severity; and other things they ill interpreted, as particularly, that he carried himself towards them, as if he affected domination over them: That he overthew the 
Law,
 and made men carnal and dissolute; that he was imperious in writing, though his person was abject and contemptible. These and such like Calumnies of theirs, the Apostle sets himself to refute in this Epistle: yet notwithstanding all this, he professes his sincere love to them; but being forced to it by his Adversaries, he resolves to vindicate himself and his Apostolick authority from their contempt.




In which Epistle we may observe these 
three
 parts.




1. The 
Preface.


2. The 
Body of the Epistle.


3. The 
Conclusion.




THE 
Preface
 contains the Direction of the Epistle to the Church at 
Corinth,
 and to all the 
Saints,
 and Churches in 
Achaia,
 and his Apostolical saluta∣tion and benediction. 
Ver. 1, 2.


The 
Body of the Epistle
 consists of 
three
 parts. In the 
1st.
 He apologizes for himself in the 
five
 first Chapters.


In the 
2d.
 He exhorts the 
Corinthians
 to sundry duties. 
Chap. 6, 7, 8, 9.


In the 
3d,
 He vindicates his own Authority and Doctrine. 
Chap. 10, 11, 12, and to the 11th. ver. of Chap. 13.


In the 
first part,
 we may observe these particulars.


1st.
 Lest any of them should be offended at his many afflictions and troubles,
 and be tempted to think (as worldlings use to be), that if he were a faithful Servant of God, he would not suffer him to be so extremely afflicted. He there∣upon begins his Epistle with solemn thanksgiving to God, for the comforts he afford∣ed him in those his trials, that so he might by his own experience be able to com∣fort others that were in the like condition. For though his sufferings for Christ were many, yet his 
consolations
 from Christ were many also. And he tells them, that whe∣ther he was 
afflict
d,
 it tended to their consolation and salvation, which is to be wrought out by a patient and christian enduring such kind of afflictions as he endured, when they are called to it: or whether he was 
comforted,
 it tended also to their consolation and salvation; who by his example, might learn willingly to undergo afflicti∣ons for Christ, that they might also partake of his consolations. And he had a stedfast and firm hope concerning several of them, that they did sympathize with him in his suf∣ferings, and accordingly should partake with him in his comforts. 
From Ver. 1. to 8.


2.
 He clears himself of some 
aspersions
 cast on him by 
false Teachers.
 As first of 
levity
 in not coming to them according to his promise made, 
1 Cor. 4.19. & 1 Cor. 16. from 2. to 8.
 And secondly of too much 
rigor
 towards the 
ince∣stuous
 person.


To the 
first,
 he answers, that he was hindred by that affliction he met with in 
Asia, viz.
 at 
Ephesus,
 that was so great, that he even despaired of life. The history of which, (as s
me conceive), we have 
Act. 19.
, where 'tis intimated in what extreme danger his life was, so that he had no humane means to escape it. Yet out of this danger God (who can deliver from imminent death 
those,
 that are ready to dye, and can, and will raise up those that are dead at the last day) delivered him, and he trusts will still deliver him out of all such dangers; they affording him the help of their prayers (which he earnestly desires) that so the mercy of such deliverances being bestowed through the prayers and intercessions of many, God may be glorified and praised by many for them. 
From Ver. 8. to 12.


2ly.
 He shews that the fairness and uprightness of his conversation, and espe∣cially among the 
Corinthians
 (among whom he had conversed a year and half, 
Act. 18.11.
) might testifie for him, that he was not acted by fleshly wisdom or

 dissimulation, but by the grace of God. Neither did he write
 any thing to them that was disagreeable to his professed sincerity, but those things they here read, they cannot but acknowledg to be really so, and he hopes to the end they shall always acknowledg him to be the same. And as it was matter of rejoicing to 
them,
 that they were converted by 
him;
 so it was to 
him
 that he had 
gained them to Christ,
 and so he hoped to glory in them at the last day. And with this affection to them, and perswasion of their kindness to him, he design
d to come unto them, that they might have a second benefit by him; and be con∣firmed at his second coming, as they were converted at his first, and that he might receive offices of kindness and friendship from them. And therefore he did not make promis
s 
lightly
 and 
r
shly
 after the manner of 
car∣nal
 men, (promising wh
t they intend not t
 perform), so that there should be
 
yea
 and 
nay
 with him, that is, 
saying
 and not 
do∣ing
 concerning the same things. For Christ Jesus whom he had preached among them, and whom 
he
 and 
they
 ought to imitate, was not inconstant and changeable in his Promis
s; but whatsoever is promised 
by him
 or 
of him,
 is certain and inva∣riable. For all the 
Promises
 of God, made in the Covenant of Grace, have their 
foundation, firm establishment,
 and 
unalterable ratification
 in the death of Jesus Christ, the 
Mediator
 and 
Surety
 thereof 
[Gal. 3.17. Heb. 9.15, 16, 17. & Chap. 7.22.],
 and 
in
 and 
through
 him, are firm and stedfast, sure and certain; and 
he,
 and the other Apostles ought to declare the same in their ministry, to the glory of God. And he shews, that 
he
 that establishes and confirms both 
him
 and 
them
 in their Faith in Christ, is 
God alone,
 who hath anoint∣ed and consecrated 
them his Apostles
 to this high office of the Apostleship, by plentifully pouring forth upon them the 
gifts
 and 
graces
 of his Spirit, and there∣by fitting them for it; and by the Miracles he hath enabled them to work, hath set his Seal to their Doctrine; and by the in
ffable, and glorious joys of his Spi∣rit, wrought in their hearts, hath given them, as it were, an earnest and taste of their future happiness: And therefore surely such persons as 
they,
 are not to be accused of leightness and vanity. 
From Ver. 12. to 23.


Further he solemnly professes, that his end 
in delaying
 to come to them, was to give 
some
 among them 
time
 to repent and reform, and that the 
disorders
 in their Church might be rectified by themselves, lest when he came, he should be compell'd to use more severity among them, than they could well bear. And this he spake, not as 
one
 that arrogated to himself a dominion over their 
Faith,
 (and designed to impose upon them in the matters that concern'd their souls, what he pleased), but as a 
minister
 and 
co-worker
 with Christ, to bring them to a right and due sense of their faults, and consequently to that true joy and comfort which follows upon true repentance and amendment; and so he should be a means to strengthen their 
Faith
 in Christ, by 
which alone
 they 
stand in the favour of God,
 and obtain a 
right
 and 
title
 to the Kingdom of Heaven. 
From Ver. 23, to the end.


He comes now in the second place, to vindicate himself from the aspersions of 
 too much 
rigor
 towards the 
incestuous
 person. In order to which, he tells them, that he had no mind to come to them in such a manner, that his coming should bring sadness, and heaviness to them, by reason of the severity he should be neces∣sitated to use towards the reforming of the evil manners among them. For if he was forc'd upon such an occasion to grieve them, nothing could comfort him so much, as the 
amendment of the person
 against 
whom
 he was forc'd to use severity. And concerning this thing, 
viz.
 the 
amending
 of the faults among them, he had written to them in his former Epistle 
[chap. 5.],
 lest if he should

 come to them, and find any scandalous unreform'd persons among them, besides his sorrow for their sin, he should be forced to a new sorrow, which necessary severity would create both to them and himself: And he was confide
 that they rather desired he should find matter of joy among them, by the removal of such offences, than matter of sorrow, by continuing of them. He professes, that what he wrote in his former Epistle concerning the incestuous person, was not written with any inten∣tion to grieve them, but out of his great and abundant love to them, which could not endure that they should make themselves guilty of such faults. He tells them, that the 
incestuous
 person's sin, had not so wholly grieved him, as if they were 
all
 offenders with him; for since he had proof of their obedience in their excommuni∣cating of him, he did sorrow but in part, only for his sake who was guilty, not for them all, they having cleared themselves, that they were no upholders or main∣tainers of him in his sin. And that it might appear that his former severity pro∣c
eded not from any other principle then 
love,
 and a desire of good to the Church of 
Corinth,
 he declares, that the 
censure
 and chastizement inflicted on this 
in∣cestuous
 person by the authority of many (that is, the Governours of the Church, the Church it self consenting) 
seeing he had manifested his repentance,
 was sufficient. And sherefore he adviseth, that he be received into favour again, be∣cause they were bound to f
rgive and comfort him now, as well as they were bound to excommunicate him before; and this they ought the rather to do, lest if they should not, he sh
uld be swallowed up of over-much sorrow. Where∣fore he exhorts them, to 
confirm
 their love towards him, by shewing, that by excommunicating him they did not intend to destroy him, but to save him, by bringing him to repentance. And for this end he had now written to them, to see whether they would be as obedient to his directions and appointments, in 
ab∣solving
 of penitents, as in afflicting Church-censures on offendors. He tells them, that whom they were willing to forgive and restore from excommunication (being satisfied of their repentance), he was willing also to forgive, as one present in spirit with them, 
see 1 Cor. 5.
 And if in the beginning of the Church, before the orderly go∣vernment of it was setled, he 
alone
 had received some repenting sinners to mercy; he d d it, not out 
f ambition, but with regard to them, to give them an exam∣ple of shewing 
lenity
 as well as 
severity;
 and with respect to the person of Christ, that he might keep people stedfast in the Faith of Christ; and that S
tan might not get an advantage against any of them; who sometimes by too great slackness of Ecclesiastical discipline s
eks to lull sinners asleep, and sometimes by too great seve∣rity endeavours to drive them to despair. 
From Ver. 1. to 12.


3dly.
 He shews, he was so far from wanting any true affection to them, that when he came to 
Troas
, though a door
 was opened to him by the Lord for the preaching of the Gospel in that place, yet he had no rest in his spirit because he found not 
Titus
 there, to inform him of their state; and in pursuit of him he left that City, and went into 
Macedonia,
 in hope that he might find him there, and having met with him he understood by him the happy success of his former Epistle, and that caused him to bless God exceedingly, who had hitherto so graciously prospered him in his ministry, and had given him and his fellow-Apo∣stles such a victory and conquest in every place, (where they came to preach the word) by the conversion of so many, and had spread the sweet odour or savour of the Gospel by their preaching up and down in the world. And (says he) we spread this sweet savour of Christ, (to the honour and glory of God), both among such as are thereby brought to repent and believe, and among such as re∣main impenitent and unbelievers. To the 
one,
 the Gospel is the most comfortable vital savour that ever came to them, and a ministry of life
, and the power of God unto their Salvation; but to the 
other,
 by accident, 'tis a savour of death
 and aggravates their condemnation. And the preaching of this glorious Gospel, he shews, is a weighty imployment, and no man is sufficient of himself for it. Lastly, he declares, that he was no corrupter of the Word, as many 
false Teachers
 were, who mixed their own

 passi
ns of pride or covetousness with the true Doctrine they preached; but he preach∣ed it out of uprightness and sincerity, as one taught of God, and who eyed God in what he did, and was acted by the power, and guided by the Spirit of Christ. 
From Ver. 12. to the end.


 
4ly.
 He shews it was not requisite he should go about to commend the fidelity of his ministry, especially to them, considering they had been converted by it; and therefore he needed not 
Letters commendatory
 to them (or from them to others) such as the 
false Teachers
 possibly strove to commend themselves by; for 
they themselves
 were his
 Epistle of commendation, given as it were by God to him, affording him a clear Testimony of the soundness of his Doctrine, and the efficaciousness of his Ministry, by their conversion; which Testimony being written in their hearts
, and openly appearing in their Christian conversation, was legible to other Churches, and accordingly acknowledged by them: yet he would not say, they were so much his Epistle, as the Epistle of Christ, Christ himself having writ∣ten his Will and Law on their hearts, by the operation of the Holy Ghost, after a more excellent manner than any thing was wont to be written with Ink upon Paper; and 
he
 and 
Timothy
 were only the Pen or Instruments of the Spirit in this writing
. And they had still a great confidence of being further instrumental in this way, and of the acceptance of their endeavours with God, through Christ enabling of them. Not that they were able by any natural wisdom of their own, to think or contrive any thing that was fit to convert the hearts of men; but their 
sufficiency
 was 
Gods assistance,
 who had made them fit or meet to be Ministers of the 
New Testament,
 which is ac∣companied with the efficacious operation of the Spirit, and not of the 
Old Testa∣ment
 which literally declared what was to be done, but gave no spiritual ability for the doing and performing of it. For the 
Old Testament,
 or 
old dispensa∣tion
 of the Covenant of Grace (call'd here the 
Letter
), though it shaddow'd out the way to life, yet conferred not on faln man any power to perform what is required thereunto, but convinced him of sin, and consequently that he was wor∣thy of death
, which is threatned to transgressors. But the 
New Testament,
 or G
spel, doth not only clearly shew the way to life and salvation by Faith in Christ Je∣sus, but is also accompanied with the power of the Holy Ghost, whereby that 
Faith
 is wrought, and whereby the Soul is raised up, and quickened from the death of sin. Now if the Old Testament which was a ministration of death, and was written in Letters, and engraven in Stones, (as to some part of it, to wit, the Ten Commandments), was so glo∣rious, as was signified by the splendor of 
Moses
's face, which the Children of Israel could not stedfastly behold when he came down from the Mount
; which Ministration was yet to be done away, (as far forth as it was opposite to the Gospel-dispensation
): How much more glorious is the Ministration of the New Testament, which is accompanied with the quickning Spirit of God? If the Ministration of Condemnation were glorious, how much shall the Ministra∣tion of Righteousness and Justification excell in glory? So that the former, though in it self glorious, yet when compared with the latter, hath, as it were, no glory; it is so far out-shin'd by it: and if that Admini∣stration which was to be abolished was glorious, surely that which is to continue is much more glorious. From hence he infers, that seeing himself and the other Apostles had such hope that their Ministry should be accepted and owned by God, they used the greater boldness in publishing the Gospel; and did not imitate 
Mo∣ses,
 who veiled his face, which was a sign of the obscurity of the 
Legal Admi∣nistration,
 and of the blindness of the 
Jews,
 who could not see the 
end
 and

 
scope
 of that which was to be abolished, but generally rested in the 
outward letter
, and apprehended not the mysteries hid under those shaddows, and to this day, the 
veil
 remained upon their hearts 
untaken away,
 in the reading of the Old Testament. But in the New Testament, by the clear Doctrine of Christ, 
this cov
ring
 or 
v
il
 is done away. Nevertheless, when their hearts shall be turned to the Lord, and shall own Christ, then the veil shall be done away as to them also, and they shall clearly see and understand what is now hid from them. For Christ is that quickning Spirit who takes away the veil and pow∣erfully changes the heart; and where his Spirit powerfully works, there is liberty and freedom from the yoke of the legal Administration, and from slavery to sin. And as 
Moses
 when he went to appear before the Lord put away the covering from his face, and by his converse with God his face became more and more shining and glorious, so (says he) all we who have received the Spirit of the Lord, do with open face, without any veil or covering, clearly behold the glorious Attributes of God, and the glorious manifestations of his grace, mercy, and wisdom shining in the face of Jesus Christ, (as in a 
mirror
 or 
glass
), and thereby are trans∣formed into his Image, and are made like to him in the glory of holiness and grace, growing from one glorious measure and degree of it to another, through the operation of his Holy Spirit. 
From Ver. 1. to the end.


5ly.
 He professes diligence and faithfulness in preaching this glorious Gospel, 
 (which was a ministry not of the 
letter
 and of 
death,
 but of the 
spirit
 and 
life
); and that, notwithstanding all his troubles, he fainted not, nor was dis∣couraged. He declares that he had renounced ambition and covetousness (which some secretly allowed themselves in), and that he did not was walk craftily, nor handle the word of God
 deceitfully, so as to accommodate it to the corrupt humors and dispositions of men; but he preached the truth sincerely, and endeavour'd to approve himself to the Consciences of all those, who would judg 
understandingly
 and 
uprightly.
 He tells them, If the Gospel so clearly preached, be not understood by many 
worldly wise
 men, that is no argument of the obscurity of it; but of the incredulity of the hearers, who are blinded by the Devil, whom the world generally serves, and who (by the just judgment of God) hath got such a dominion over multitudes, that they serve him as their God
; and by him it is that they are so blinded, that the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ cannot shine into their hearts, wherein is manifested the Majesty of Christs person, and the soveraign Excellency of his benefits, and that he is the 
Image
 of God, the 
Eter∣nal Word
 and 
Wisdom
 of the Father, by whom the 
Glory, Wisdom, Righteousness, Grace,
 and 
Power
 of the Father is revealed to us, and presented before us. He further manifests his fidelity, by shewing them, he sought to advance the glory of Christ in his preach∣ing, and not himself, acknowledging himself a servant to Christ, and to his people for the promoting of Christs interest in them. For he humbly acknowledges, that God, who at first by his omnipotent word produced light out of darkness, by no less efficacy and power brought him (a lost sinner) out of the darkness of 
Pha∣risaism
 and 
sin,
 and shined into his heart with his glorious light, to the intent that he should communicate and impart this divine light of the knowledg of God, which shineth in the face or person of Jesus Christ, unto others. 'Tis true, the glory of God shon once in the face of 
Moses,
 but that was covered and veiled: But it shines much more gloriously now in the face of Christ, and is not covered to us. As a man sees the Fathers countenance in the face of his Son; so God represents himself most lively, sweetly, and savingly in Jesus Christ, But he tells them, that himself and his fellow-Apostles, (who were intrusted with this rich treasure of the Gospel) were but 
earthen Vessels,
 frail and contemptible, and exposed to

 many sufferings, that the 
success
 of the Gospel preached by them, might be impu∣ted to Christ alone, and not to them. 
From Ver. 1. to 8.


6ly.
 He shews, they had no reason to be offended at his sufferings, nor to object, that if he had preach
d the Gospel sincerely, God would not have permitted him to be so persecuted and afflicted. He tells them, all his afflictions were so moderated, and himself so 
upheld
 by God, that he sunk not under the burden of them. We are 
trou∣bled
 (says he) on every side, but are not brought into such streights as to be overwhelmed; 
perplexed
 sometimes, and doubtful what to do in great dangers, but not brought so low as utterly to despair of help; 
persecuted
 by men, but not forsaken of God; 
cast down
 indeed, but not utterly de∣stroyed; so that in our sufferings we represent the death and passion of Christ Jesus; and are in continual danger of death for Christs sake, that it may appear we are supported by the quickning power of the Spirit 
f Christ under all these afflictions; so that death is wrought
 in us, that is, the preaching of the Gospel exposeth us to the dangers of death, and yet our ministry bringeth eternal life to you: we dye, that is, are expos
d to death, that you may live eternally in happiness. And we having the same spirit of 
Faith
 which was in holy 
David
 when he wrote the 
116 Psalm,
 where at 
v. 10,
 he saith, 
Because I believed therefore I spake, I was sore afflicted, &c.
 As he (I say) be∣ing in many troubles believed, and testified his confidence in God for deliverance, so likewise do we, being assured that he
 that raised Christ from the dead, will raise us up also by Christ, and will present us glorious together with you, if ye believe. All these things, says he, 
viz.
 the dangers we have been in, and the deliverances God hath afforded to us, they all tend to your advantage, and to the confirming of your Faith, and the encreasing of your thankfulness, that so the benefit having abounded, and the mercy of God having extended it self to 
ma∣ny
 persons, by the 
thanksgiving
 of many for it, more glory may red
und to God. And for this cause (says the Apostle) we faint not, nor are slack and sluggish in our work. For though these Bodies of ours be attenuated and weak∣ned by so many afflictions, yet our 
inward man,
 our minds and Souls grow more strong and vigorous. For our transitory light afflictions (to speak of them 
com∣paratively
), are so accepted by God, that they work
 for us, (not for any merit in them, but through Gods free grace and mercy, and Christs merits), a most excellent eternal weight of glory, we having our minds intent by Faith, not on things visible and temporal, but on things invisible and eternal. 
From Ver. 8. to the end.


 
7ly.
 Having mentioned this 
eternal glory,
 he proceeds to describe it, testifying his assurance that after this mortal body of his, which is but an earthly taber∣nacle shall be broken down, his Soul shall
 have a build∣ing made by God, that is, an immortal glorious body 
(see 1 Cor. 15.44, 46.)
 divinely made and fitted for Hea∣ven, and the fruitions and employments of that glorious place. He shews, that while he is in this mortal body he groans by reason of his daily troubles, desiring earnestly to be clothed with that glorious Body
. This he speaks upon supposition
 that he be found 
cloathed with his mortal body,
 that is, 
alive
 at Christs Second Coming, and not 
naked,
 that is, unclothed of it by death. For he tells them, that himself and many other Saints, being burdened with sin and many other evils in this life, desire (if it so pleased God) that they might put on this blessed immortality

 without a dissolution
, as it will happen to the Chil∣dren of God that are found alive at Christs Second Coming, that so this mortal life may be exchanged, yea swallowed up by that which is 
life
 indeed. And that he might give them further assurance of this future happin
ss, he tells them, G
d had prepared them to be capable of 
this hea∣venly glory
 in their Souls, and of 
this blissful immorta∣lity
 in their Bodies, by working a work of grace in their hearts, and by giving them his 
Holy Spirit
 as an 
earnest
 and 
pledg
 to assure them thereof. Therefore they b
re up with courage under all afflictions, and could look 
death
 it self cheerfully in the face, as kn
wing that 
that
 will bring them home to God, from whom th
se earthly Bodies keep them as strangers at a distance
. For here (says he) we live by 
Faith
 only, and cannot attain to 
sight
 and 
fruition
 till we come to Heaven. And hence it is, that we bear up with so much courage against the fear of death, being willing rather to go out of this Bo∣dy, and dye, that by this means we may come to our home, to enjoy the blissfull presence of God in Heaven, than to continue in the Body and be deprived of that happiness. So that all our ambition and design is this, that whether we continue in this mortal Body, or go out of it; whether we live or dye, we may be accepted of God, and may come at last to enjoy his blessed presence in Heaven. For we with full assurance expect a day of Judgment, at which all must appear, and at which every one shall receive according to their works
. And knowing the terribleness of that judgment, we do the more earnestly perswade men to come in to Christ, and to live as those that must be thus judged. But whether they would be perswaded or no, he tells them, the sincerity of his intention was manifested to God, and he hoped to their Consciences also. He shews, he speaks not these things to commend himself to them, but to furnish them how to answer the Ca∣lumnies that false Teachers brought against him, who gloried much 
outwardly,
 
ut knew in their hearts and Consciences they had little reason so to do. And if I seem mad, says he, in thus comm
nding my ministry and sincerity unto you, I aim at G
ds glory therein, (that the Gospel may not be undervalued), and not to arrogate to my self any thing. And on the other side, if I write and speak only that which you must needs account 
sober,
 it is for your good and edification. For the love of Christ constrains me to be faithful to him, and to refer all to his honour and praise, seeing he so loved us, as to lay down his life for us, when we were all dead in respect of the desert of our sins, and the claim of divine justice: And he hath done it, that all that are deliver'd from deserved perdition; through faith in his blood, should not live to themselves, but to the honour and praise of their Redeemer. And for his own part, he professes, he was so highly affected with this great redemption wrought by Christ, that he could not value any man, or esteem him happy, meerly for the outward advantages of this world, 
viz.
 for his 
wisdom, riches, learning, &c.
 except he had a share in this Redemption. And if he himself formerly hath had carnal and earthly thoughts and hopes of Christ (as m
ny of the other 
Jews
 had) expecting that he should begin an earthly temporal Kingdom among them, wherein they should enjoy all outward prosperity, yet now he should know him so no more, but put off all such carnal imaginations of his Kingdom. For his Kingdom (he tells them) was of another nature, and 
whosoever is in him,
 (not 
externally
 only, by outward profes∣sion, but is really inserted and implanted into him by Faith, and made a member of that mystical body whereof he is the head), is renewed by his Spirit, and receives life, influence, and direction from him, and is thereby effectually chang'd, and made

 a 
new creature,
 as to his 
principles, affections,
 and 
practises.
 And he shews, that 
all these things
 that concern the 
new creature,
 or the renovation of man, depend on G d as the Author of them, who of his 
free grace
 reconciles sinners to himself, by the death of his Son, and hath committed to them, his Apostles, the ministry of reconciliation, giving them commission to declare, that God was 
in
 and 
through
 the merits and 
intercession
 of his Son, ready to be reconciled to all those, both among 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles,
 that truly believe in him; and upon their Faith in him, he did actually pardon them, not imputing their trespasses to them. And he had intrusted them, his Apostles, to publish the same in his name. And ac∣cordingly, as 
Ambassadors
 for Christ, and as sent from God on this great Message, they most affectionately besought sinners to accept of the reconciliation offered by God 
in
 and 
through Christ Jesus;
 who being an innocent, pure, and sinless person, God sent into the world to offer up himself a Sacrifice for our sins 
[Lev. 7.2.],
 that we by 
Faith
 resting on him, might be made fully righteous, with such a righteousness as God approves, and accepts, and for which he is pleased to justifie us. 
From Ver. 1. to the end.


Having dispatched the 
Apologetical,
 or 
Excusatory
 part of his Epistle, he comes now to the 
Hortatory
 part of it; wherein we may take notice of these particulars.


 
1.
 He exhorts the 
Corinthians,
 not to receive 
in vain
 the Doctrine of Grace and Reconciliation, which was offered to them by him, as an Ambassador of Christ, and a co-worker with him, this being the very 
season
 and 
time
 wherein God did open the treasures of his mercy and bounty to poor sinners. So that he might ac∣commodate that which was promised to the Prophet 
Isaiah, ch. 49. v. 8.
 to this present time, 
In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of sal∣vation have I helped thee,
: Which words, though in the 
first sense
 they were a Promise to 
Isaiah,
 that God would bless his ministry to that people, (which he had prayed for); yet in a more sublime sense, they may intimate, that in the times of the G
spel, God would, upon the intercession of his Son, work effectually upon the hearts of sinners by the preaching of his word. And that this exhortation may be the more effectual, he shews, how 
he
 and 
his fellow-Apostles
 had laboured to avoid all occasions of giving any just offence, approving themselves faithful Ministers of Christ (so that their ministry could not justly be blamed), by a 
patient suffering
 of several sorts of evils, by the exercise of purity, and the study
 of the holy Scriptures, by long∣suffering, and kindness, and love unfeigned, by the exer∣cise of the gifts of the Spirit, and clearly preaching the truth of God, being accompanied therein with the power of God enabling them to work miracles, and to convince the obstinate, and having on the 
armour
 of Righteousness for the 
right
 
hand,
 and for the 
left;
 that is, being furnished with weapons 
offensive,
 and 
defensive,
 against all assaults and temp∣tations, either of a 
prosp
rous
 or 
adverse
 condition. And this, whether they were honour'd or despised, well report∣ed of or reproached, though counted 
deceivers
 when they were most faithful, and while by some doubted of, whether they were the sincere Servants of Christ, or no, though by others owned and acknowledged; while by reason of the greatness and multitude of their afflictions they seem daily dying, yet by the special favour and protection of God are still preserved. They seemed sad indeed sometimes under the evils that oppressed them, but yet rejoiced in spirit, and had the inward testimony of their Conscience, and the comforts of the Holy Ghost to support them: They were poor in respect of worldly things, yet enriched many with spiritual riches. They had in a manner nothing, yet were so well provided for by the special pro∣vidence

 of God, that they wanted nothing needful or necessary for them, and were as well contented as if they were Masters of all things. 
From Ver. 1. to 11.


2.
 He declares his great love towards them, and exhorts them, to shew the like again towards him. He tells them, he used freedom and largeness in speak∣ing to them, his mouth was opened, and his heart enlarged towards them, and they had a large place in his affections; but he doubted whether he had so large a place in theirs: he feared they were straitned in love and affection towards him: and yet in way of recompence, it was no more than just and fit, they should, like good Children, answer the affections of their spiritual Father. 
From Ver. 11. to 14.


3ly.
 He exhorts them to avoid all intimate fellowship
 in marriages, or otherwise, with 
infidels
 and 
ido∣laters,
 whereby they might he brought into communion with their idolatry, or other sins, there being no more agree∣ment between a Believer and an Infidel, than between light and darkness, between Christ and Belial. For they that believe in Christ are the 
Temple
 of the living God, as he proves, partly out of 
Lev. 26.11, 12.
 partly out of 
Ezek. 37.26, 27.
 There∣fore with the words of the Prophet 
Isaiah, ch. 52. v. 11.
 he exhorts them to abstain, as much as they could, from the Society of Idolaters, and not to 
touch the unclean thing,
 that is, not to join with them in their sinful actions; and then God promises to receive them, and own them for his Sons, and Daughters as it is 
Jer. 31.1, 9. From Ver. 14. to the end.


And having such precious promises, he exhorts them to abstain not only from 
 idolatry, but from all pollution both of flesh and Spirit, and to endeavour to per∣fect holiness in the fear of God. 
Ver. 1.


4ly.
 He exhorts them to receive him, their Apostle, into the bos
m of their love, seeing he had not given them any cause of distaste, either by wronging any of them in their reputation, or corrupting any of them in their judgments, or defrauding any of them in their estates. And these things he spake for his own vindication, not to reproach them: for he had such an affection for them, that he could be content (if God saw it good) even to live and dye with them. And though he spake freely of their faults to themselves, yet he gloried of them to others, and was exceedingly comforted in the midst of all his afflictions, by the report he heard of their repentance. He shews, that when he was come from 
Ephesus
 into 
Macedonia, [Act. 20.1.
], though he met with great opposi∣tions from some there, yet the fears he had concerning them were very trouble∣som to him. But he was exceedingly comforted by the coming of 
Titus;
 and it was not his bare presence that was so much a comfort to him, as the news that he brought, (with which he himself was also much comforted), 
viz.
 the news of their earnest desire to see him, their mourning for the sins he had in his former Epistle charged them with, and their zeal to defend him against his Calum∣niators, the false Teachers. And though in his former Epistle he had writ∣ten something sharply to them, by reason of their many enormities, yet he did not now repent of it, though 'tis true he was once sorry he had done it, lest such as were innocent among them should think themselves struck-at, in those his repre∣hensions. But though that Epistle did for a while grieve them, yet now he was glad he had written it, not meerly because he had grieved them, but because it had brought them to a Godly sorrow, for the evils that were among them, so that they received no damage at all, but much advantage thereby. For a right sense and sorrow for sin, wrought by the Spirit of God, worketh true repentance and reformation never to be repented of; whereas worldly sorrows, occasion'd only by

 disgraces, or worldly losses or crosses, usually encreases sin and misery, and work∣eth diseases and death. Now that their sorrow was 
from God,
 he assures him∣self by the excellent fruits and effects of it. 
1.
 Their carefulness to amend what was amiss. 
2.
 Their clearing themselves, that they did not approve the fact of the incestuous person. 
3.
 Their indignation against that sin, and their own neg∣lect of censuring of him. 
4.
 Their fear of divine vengeance if they persisted in that neglect. 
5.
 Their d
sire of taking away the scandal, and satisfying all good men by proceeding against him. 
6.
 Their zeal to execute what the Apostle had commanded for the removing this scandal, and this evil from among them. 
7.
 The revenge which they exercised upon the incestuous person by 
excommunicating
 him; by all which, they declared their repentance to be sincere, and that they did not at all approve of that miscarriage, but were clear from it. Wherefore he tells them, that he wrote n
t to them▪ 
only,
 or 
chiefly,
 that the 
incestuous
 person might be punished, and satisfaction made to his 
Father,
 whose Wife he had ta∣ken unto himself
, but that the singular care he had of the welfare of their Church, to remove sin and scandal, might be manifested unto them. Further, he shews them, that he was much comforted for the comfort they had received in the course they had taken with the 
incestuous
 person, and the more also for their kind reception of 
Titus,
 whose spirit was much revived and refreshed by them. And as all things that he himself had spoken to them 
they
 found to be true, so all the good he had spoken of them to 
Titus, he
 by experience found to be true also. He tells them, that 
Titus
's affection was much towards them, remembring with what ready obedience and humility they received him, as an 
Evangelist,
 and a more than ordinary Servant of God sent unto them. Lastly, he acquaints them that he much rejoiced, that from his own experience of them, he might confi∣dently promise himself, and others, all good from them. 
From Ver. 2. to the end.


5.
 He exhorts them now, to a 
liberal contribution
 to the poor Saints of 
 
Judea,
 using several arguments to perswade to it. 
1.
 From the example of the 
Macedonians,
 into whose hearts God had put that excellent gift and grace of 
Charity;
 of whom he boasts, as those who had great joy and peace
 in their Consciences, even then when they were exercised with great outward afflictions, and who gave liberaly and bountifully, even in their deep pover∣ty
; yea, gave beyond their ability. He shews, how instead of being intreated by him, they earnestly desired him to receive their Charity and Collection, and that he with others would take upon him to dispense their alms; so that they did more than he could hope or expect
, giving them∣selves first to God, and afterwards committing themselves to him, and his Apostolical care, to be guided and g
vern∣ed by him according to the will of God▪ 
2.
 Because he had desir'd 
Titus
 to go to them, and as he had begun to stir them up to this duty, and to exercise this grace at his first coming to them; so he would further pro∣mote and finish it. 
3.
 Because they abounded in other graces and gifts, 
viz.
 in faith, in ability to instruct others, in knowledg, in care of the salvation of their Brethren, and in love towards himself, their Apostle; therefore they ought to a∣bound in this grace also. 
4.
 Because hereby they would testifie the sincerity of their love to the Saints; which he mentioned not to them, as commanding them, but as moving them thereto, even by the example of the 
Macedonians. 5.
 Be∣cause Christ (who was Lord of all) emptied himself 
(Phil. 2.5.),
 that they, and all others that believe in him, might be enriched with his spiritual and hea∣venly blessings; therefore for his sake it was fit they should be ready to distribute. 
6.
 It was expedient for them, in respect of their 
reputation
 and the 
future reward
 they might expect, that this good work which they had begun a year ago
 (and that with great forwardness and readiness of mind) should be carried on; yet according to their ability, and the proportion of their estates: for God values

 not so much the quantity of the 
gift,
 as the 
good will
 and cheerful mind of the 
giver.
 He tells them, it was not his intent to overburden or 
impoverish
 them, to 
ease
 others, but that things equal and just should be done; that you (says he) supplying the present poverty of the Christians in 
Judea
 out of your fulness; if you should hereafter want, and they be full, they should by a just retribution sup∣ply your wants. As in the collection of 
Manna [Exod. 16.],
 God commanded that they which gathered more, than the prescribed measure, (which was an 
Omer
 for every single person) should give to him, who had gathered less; so God would have it, that they that have great riches should impart of their abundance, to them who are in want. 
7.
 He further excites them to this duty because several faithful Brethren were stirred up by God, and sent by him, not only to promote this collection, but also to carry it to the poor Saints in 
Judea;
 and he hopes they will not frustrate the expectation of such worthy persons; the first of whom was 
Titus,
 who took upon him to exhort and move them hereunto, and being very diligent, willingly travelled unto them. The other is supposed to be 
Barnabas,
 who was highly 
prais'd in all the Churches,
 for his excellent gift in preaching the Gos∣pel; and was by the Churches suffrage made 
Pauls
 Companion, and sent with the same 
diaconary
 charge, which was administred by 
Paul,
 for the glory of God, and their encouragement (c). And he shews,
 why he joined to himself persons of so great integrity in this charge and ministry, lest evil-minded men should suspect him of dishonesty, if he alone should manage that business of 
receiving
 and 
distri∣buting
 so great contributions as were m
de by the Churches. And he tells them, he must provide for a good reputation before men, as well as labour for a good Conscience before God. He mentions a third whom he sent with 
Titus
 and 
Bar∣nabas
 (whether 
Luke,
 or 
Apollos,
 or another is uncertain) whom he often had found faithful, and now very ready to come unto them, upon the special confidence
 he hath of their goodness and liberality. And as for the persons that are 
intrusted
 in this business, he shews, they are such as they may have confidence in. As for 
Titus,
 he was his Companion and fellow labourer in strengthning and con∣firming them in the Faith, and correcting things amiss among them. And for the other Brethren, he tells them, they are the Messengers of the Churches, sent to gather this contribution, and persons in wh
m the grace of Christ eminently shines, and such by whom the honour of Christ is singularly promoted. Wherefore he desires them to shew unto them, and so consequently to all the Churches whose Messengers they were, a proof of their love; and so they would manifest that his boasting of them hath not been without reason. 
From Ver. 1. to the end.


Having thus assured them concerning the integrity of the 
Messengers,
 he pro∣ceeds 
 to speak of the Contribution, for the promoting of which, he says he need not write further unto them; for he knew their forwardness therein, and had boasted to the 
Macedonians,
 that the Christians of 
Achaia
 (of which 
Corinth
 was the chief City) had made a preparation to supply the poor Saints of 
Judea,
 a year ago; and their zeal therein, had provoked many to the like forwardness. However he had sent these Brethren that 
they
 might find true what he had boasted of them; and th
t (as he said before) they might be ready at his coming, and not surprized, having this warning given them before hand. For otherwise when he came with some of 
Macedonia
 accompanying him, if they should not have their supplies ready, it would tend to his and their disgrace. Therefore he sent these Brethren to them before hand, to exhort them to get their collections ready before he came, that so their beneficence may appear to be their own free bounty, and not a collection difficultly extorted from them
, as from covetous men, who give grudgingly and unwillingly. 
From Ver. 1. to 6.


In the next place he exhorts them, to give 
liberally
 and 
freely,
 because the re∣ward will be proportion'd to their freeness therein; and to give chearfully, and

 willingly (every one as he is prompted by his own heart, for God loveth a chear∣ful giver. And lest they should fear their Charity might bring themselves to wants and straights, he shews, that God is able (and having promised it, th
y may expect it) to make them the richer for their liberality, so that what they give shall return to them with usury and increase
. As 'tis said of the liberal 
Almsgiver, Psal. 112.9.
 that, 
He shall evermore continue to shew himself righteous
, that is, 
bountiful,
 and shall have 
enough
 all the days of his life wherewith to exercise his 
liberality:
 so far shall he be from wanting. And as God blesseth the increase of the Earth so largely, that it sufficeth for the 
nourishment
 of men, and for 
seed
 to sow again; so he prays, that G
d would supply all their pr
sent wants, and also grant them such pl
nty and ability, that they may be liberal still towards others, and that he would incre
se and multiply to them the rewards and fruits of their righteousness and mercy. That being thus inriched by the good∣ness of God, and abounding unto all b
untifulness
, many prayers may be rendred to God by those, to whom 
he
 and his 
Collegues
 should distribute their Alms. For he tells them, what 
he
 and 
they
 had undertaken, (
viz.
 the distribution of their collecti
n) would not only supply the necessities of the Saints, but occasion abundant thanksgivings unto God; and so be, not only an act of 
charity
 in the Givers, but an occasion of 
piety
 also in the Receivers. And this their liberality would be a pro
f that they did truly subject themselves to the Gospel of Christ (which injoins Charity and Almsgiving) and would occasion many to glorifie God for it, and for their readiness in communicating unto them, and unto others that are in want, as occasion required. And lastly, they will en∣de
v
ur to be thankful to them as they are able, by their hearty prayers to God for them, and by their longing after and earnestly desiring their welfare, rejoicing exceedingly for that great measure of grace God had bestowed on them. He con∣concludes this whole matter with thanksgiving unto God for that 
great gift
 of Charity he had bestowed on them, which inclined their hearts, in so liberal a manner, to relieve the necessities of the Saints (which gift he cannot sufficiently commend) whereby much glory redounds to God, and much honour to the Christian profession. 
From Ver. 6. to the end.


He comes now to the 
third
 part of his Epistle; wherein,


 
1.
 He vindicates his authority from the contempt cast upon it by 
false Teachers, his speech contemptible,
 but when absent, 
bold
 and 
severe.
 He therefore be∣seeches them by the gentleness and meekness of Christ (whom he was not asham'd to imitate) not to interpret this his behaviour among them otherwise than they ought. He tells them, he desires and wishes that when he comes he may not be forced to use his power with that boldness, which he thought to use against some of them, who accused him of a weak carriage and behaviour in his Apostleship, as either fearing or flattering men, and so walking carnally, and being too mild on one of those grounds. For though he was not free from humane infirmities and weaknesses, yet he did not exercise his Apostleship in a weak manner, or by weak weapons. For the weapons he used were 
spiritual, viz. Christian fortitude, zeal, freedom in speaking the truth of God,
 and 
courage in administring the censures of the Church,
 which had a divine force upon the Conscience, to throw down the 
strong holds
 of carnal wisdom, and the corrupt reasonings and proud conceits, by which corrupt m
n think to defend themselves, either in their 
errors
 or 
vices,
 against the Gospel, having in readiness that which serv
s to re∣venge all disobedience upon the 
refractory,
 (viz. 
excommunication
), which he was resolved to make use of against such persons, when the 
Corinthians,
 (to wit,

 the greater part of them) shall have made good their obedience, and reduced them∣selves to good order again *, having been seduced by these false Teachers. He tells them, they ought not to judg of him, or of the power of his Apostleship and Ministry, by his external humble and mild behaviour among them, which seemed to some of them so vile. He shews, that he may (and that justly) be compa∣red with any of those that emulate him. For by all those arguments, by which any of them can prove he is a Disciple of Christs, he may conclude the same of him also. Nay if he should pretend to some more authority from Christ (being an Apostle) than hath been given to others, (and that for the advantage and not the hurt of any), he might make it good. And that his Epistles may not seem only Bug-bears (as his Calumniators affirm'd, saying, that his Letters were indeed 
severe
 and 
authoritative,
 but his personal presence weak, and his speech contemptible), he tells them, that such as his Letters and Words are when he is absent, such shall his performances be when he shall be present among them. 
From Ver. 1. to 12.


2ly.
 In the next place, he refells the vain brags of the false Apostles; who ar∣rogated to themselves the things they never did. He tells them, 
(Ironically),
 he will not compare himself with 
those Boast
rs,
 that so highly magnified them∣selves, and took so much upon them; yet he suggests, how foolish they were in judging of themselves by their own s
lf-conceit, and the opinion that such as were like them had of them, without looking upon others, to whom the Lord had im∣parted greater gifts and power, such as were the Apostles. But whatever 
they
 did, he s
ys, 
he
 will not b
ast of things without the bounds which God hath mea∣sured to him, as if he had converted those whom he did not convert; or as if he had authority over those, that are not within those bounds; but would contain him∣self within the measure, line, and bounds assigned him by God, which certainly reached unto the 
Corinthians.
 For though the Apostles had commission to preach unto all Nations, yet they betook themselves unto several parts, and were care∣ful not to interrupt or hinder one another, nor to enter upon one anothers labours; but the 
false Apostles
 ranged where they listed, and arrogated to themselves the conversion of those, where the true Apostles had before planted the Faith. He shews, by extending his 
inspection
 and 
authority
 to them, he did not over-extend it, or go beyond his line, as they do, who intrude into, and boast of other m
ns labours; for he had advanced as far as to them in the preaching of the Gospel, and had first planted the Faith among them. He tells them, he would not pretend any Title to those whom others have converted, (as was the manner of his Emu∣l
t
rs), but yet he hoped, that when the 
Corinthians
 shall be more strength
ned in the Faith, they will deal with their Neighbours to entertain the Gospel, and to be willing to hear him preach it to them, and so the borders of his ministry (through them) shall be more abundantly inlarged, and that according to the rule of his calling, to whom the Apostleship of the Gentiles was committed. And so he shall preach the Gospel beyond 
Achaia,
 without entring on those parts where the Gospel had been formerly preached by others, or arrogating to himself what they had done. But that he may not seem to glory in himself, or in the gifts of God as 
his own,
 he shews, that no man ought to attribute or refer any thing he h
th to himself, but to acknowledg all his Talents to come from God, and to ascribe the success of all his gifts and endeavours entirely unto Him. For no m
n is approved because he conceits well of himself, or commends himself; but he that approves his heart and ways to God, and seeks his glory, He is accepted, accounted of, and approved by Him. 
From Ver. 12. to the end.


3ly.
 That he may further vindicate himself and his Apostleship from the con∣tempt 
 of those who preferred the false Apostles before him; he desires the 
Co∣rinthians
 to bear with him a little in his just and necessary self-commendation, which he acknowledges had a shew of folly in it. He tells them, the reason that mov'd him to it, was his 
holy jealousie
 for them. For he had by the preaching of the

 Gospel brought them to believe in Christ, and so betrothed them to 
him.
 And the Contract being made in this life, and the Marriage to be celebrated at the last day, 
[R
v. 19 7.],
 he desir'd he might as a faithful 
Paranymph
 present them then a 
pure
 and 
chast Virgin,
 a spotless Church to Christ. But he feared lest as 
Eve
 w
s seduced by the subtilty of the Devil, so their minds should be cor∣rupted by false Apostles, and seduced from the pure Doctrine of the Gospel, and drawn to admit of human mixtures, and Jewish antiquated observances. He tells them, that if any of th
se 
false Teachers
 could acquaint them with another Saviour then he had preached, or bestow on them more excellent gifts of the Spi∣rit, than they (by his ministry) had received, or could preach another Gospel, (which was of God), they might well b
ar with them in their boasting. But that being imp
ssible, they might well bear with him in his modest gl
rying, by whose preaching they had been brought to the kn
wledg of Christ. And he tells them, he w
uld not only compare himself with those 
D
ceiv
rs,
 but he thought he might justly compare himself with the most eminent of the true Apostles, [
ven 
P
ter, J
m s,
 and 
John, Gal. 2 6.
]. And th
u
h he was held to be 
rude in speech,
 by those proud Boasters of their Eloquence; yet n
ne could im
gine him to be so in 
knowledg
 or 
skill
 in the mysteries of Salvation, which was sufficiently known to the 
Corinthians
 themselves, as were also his other gifts. 
From Ver. 1. to 7.


4ly.
 He shews them, that it ought not to be esteemed a fault in him, that he so 
much
 tendred their advantage, and so 
little
 his own, as to preach the Gospel 
gratis
 and 
freely
 to them; and that he humbled himself so low, as to work with his own hands to get his maintenance, (whilst he preach'd unto them), th
t they might be exalted to the high dignity of knowing and believing in Christ. 'Tis true, when he was among them he was sometimes in want, but he troubled none of them, but sometimes wrought with his own hands to get his Bread, 
[1 Cor. 4.12. & 9.6.],
 and som
times was supplied by the 
Macedonian Phi∣lippians, [Phil. 4.15.].
 And as he had not been burthensome to them hither∣to, so neither did he intend to be; and he solemnly prof
ss
s that no man shall deprive him of this matter, of boasting in th
se parts. Yet he d
sires them not to think it was want of love to them that made him thus resolve, (for he could appe
l to God as to the sincerity of his love to them), but he did it to cut off occasion from f
lse Apostles, who sought to traduce him; and to demonstrate, that if 
they
 gloried that they preached 
freely
 and 
gratis,
 (as possibly they might, now and then out of cunning do), yet therein they should be found to do no more, nay not so much as 
he.
 For these men (he tells them) are 
deceitful workers,
 seeming to do the same things that the true Apostles of Christ did as 
Satan
 him∣self will pretend sometimes to be like a 
good Angel,
 and th
r
f
re 'tis no won∣der if his Ministers imitate him, whose end shall be according to their works 
From Ver. 7. to 16.


He deprecates again the censure of folly in this his necessitated boasting, and de∣sires them to bear
 with him, and to suffer him a little further to expatiate himself in this matter. He confesses he speaks this, as it were, and in appearance not 
after the Lord;
 for the 
Spirit
 of God in the Scripture, no where adviseth us to commend our selves, or glory of our gifts, but rather the contrary. He ac∣knowleges, it was unbeseeming him thus to boast, and therefore he did as it were, foolishly to go on in this confident boasting, if they look'd upon the 
outward thing
 only, and did not mark the 
scope
 and 
end
 of it, which was to vindicate him∣self and his ministry from the aspersions of these false Apostles. But se
ing 
th
y
 did glory in outward things, 
he
 would assume that liberty to himself also And he hoped they would bear with him in it, seeing 
wise m
n,
 (so h
 
Ironically
 calls those among them, who were apt to be puft up with a conceit of their own wisdom), do often with pleasure bear with fools; and they, as wise as they were, did bear with far greater faults in his adversaries. For they suffered

 themselves to be impos'd upon by these false Teachers, to be tyranniz'd over, to be exhausted, to be contum
liously used, and smitten as it were 
on the face,
 that is, upbraided to their very faces, because they had subjected themselves to so mean and weak a person as 
Paul,
 an Handicrafts-man. But whatever they thought of him, he assures them, that in whatsoever any of those false Apostles had cause to boast or speak boldly of themselves, he had much more. He was not only equal to them in outward priviledges, (as nobility of Race, 
&c.
), but superior in office, (being more than an ordinary Apostle of Christ), having undergone both from 
Jews
 and 
G
ntiles,
 m
re sufferings, labours, and dangers of imminent death, than any of the very Twelve Apostles, as he proves by sundry particulars
, 
[See ch. 6. v. 5. & ch. 1. v. 9, 10. & ch. 4. v. 11, 12. & 1 Cor. 15.30, 31.].
 And besides th
se outward sufferings, a pressing inward care and sol∣licitude for all the Churches lay upon him. If any were we
k and w
vering in Faith, he trembl
d for them, ap∣prehending their danger. If any, through the folly or sin of others, were scandaliz'd, and in danger of falling, he was i
flam'd with a holy zeal to have them set right again. And seeing he was constrain'd b
 his adversaries to glory, he would glory in his sufferings
 and affl
ctions for the Gospel, Gods strength having been so eminently manifested in his weakness and infirmities; and that he spake true, God was his Wit∣ness. Among other of his afflictions, he would not omit that trouble which he met with at 
D
mascus
 in the be∣ginning of his ministry, wh
re he wonderfully escaped the hands of the 
Jews,
 being let down in a Basket over the walls of the City, 
[see Act. 9.24.]. From Ver. 16. to the end.


He comes now to another kind of 
holy glorying,
 wherein yet he acknowledges 
 it was not expedi
nt for him (in reference t
 himself) to go on, but only in reference to them, namely, for the pr
serving his auth
rity among them, which the f
lse Ap
stl
s sought by all means to diminish. And upon that account, he would declare unto them, the extraordinary 
visions
 and 
revelations
 which he had from G d; one of which was this; About fourteen years ago, He
 was rapt up into the Third Heaven, 
Act. 22.17.
 (which thing he had kept to himself for so many years, and had not now d
clar
d it, had not the importunity of his adversaries forc'd him to it), and it was doubtful to himself, whether in this visi
n his Soul were abstracted from his body, or whether he were bodily transported and carried to the Third Heaven. But however it was, there he had such 
r
v lations
 made to him, as were very wonderful, but he had no commissi
n to declare them to others
. And though he might justly boast of hims
lf, [as thus exalted], in ref
rence to th
 glory of God, yet of himself, [barely con∣sidered]▪ he would not boast nor glory in any thing, but only in his sufferings for Christ. Yet if he had a mind to glory of 
this revelation,
 he might do it without va∣nity, it being most cert
inly true; but he would forbear l
st he sh
uld thereby give occasion to any to overvalue him, and to think m
re highly of him, than his common beha∣vi
ur, (
viz.
 his ordin
ry actions and words), gave them reason to do. Yet he would n
t conceal this from them, that after he had th
s
 high revelations, that he might not be too much ex
lted with them, there was given to him a 
thorn
 
in the flesh,
 a Messenger of 
Satan
 to buffet him; for deliverance from which, he earnestly besought

 the Lord, and receiv'd this gracious answer, that though God would not suddenly remove this temptation from him, yet he would support him by his grace against it and would manifest his own strength
 in the Ap
stles weakness; and the more he was assaulted, he would con∣fer on him the more power and strength to overcome. He tells them therefore, that he rather chose to glory in his afflictions and crosses, than in his revelations, as by which he had experience of the power and presence of Christ, co∣vering and sheltring of him, and being his safety and pro∣tection. And he was perfectly pleased with his suffer∣ings for Christs sake; for then the strength of Christ did more manifest it self in him; and the heavier his pres∣sures were, the greater were his supports. And when he was weak in himself, he was strong in Christ. 
From Ver. 1. to 11.


He comes now to excuse his 
boasting,
 and to shew, that they compell'd him to it, and might have saved him this labour, by defending him themselves, if they had done as they ought. For he had done and suffered as much as any of the eminentest Apostles, (through the grace of God that assisted him, 
1 Cor. 15.10.
) though of himself he was nothing, 
[1 Cor. 3.7.].
 He shews, they had 
vident arguments, and plain demonstrations, that he was indeed an Apostle of Christ, both by his patient suffering of afflictions, as also by the mighty deeds and miraculous works he had done among them. And they had as great and illustri∣ous gifts of the Spirit bestowed on them by his ministry, as any other Church whatsoever, either founded by him or any other Apostle. Only they differed from from others in this, that all was done for them 
gratis
. 
From Ver. 11. to 14.


He tells them, he now prepared himself a third time to come to them, having been twice crossed in this his design before, 
[see 1 Cor. 16.5. 2 Cor. 1.15, 16.];
 and he intended to do it without putting them to charge; for he coveted not their possessions, but their salvation. And as natural Parents usually lay up for, and give to their Children, and do not take from them; so he desired, as their spiritual Father, to inrich them with spiritual good things, and not to take from them any of their temporals. Nay, he was willing to 
spend
 and to be 
spent
 for them, though they no way answered his love; and received the false Apostles, his Emula∣tors, and made more of them, than of him their spiritual Father. But (says he) it will be objected by some, that though I was not burthensome to you my self, yet I have cunningly and underhand gotten a great deal from you by my Emissaries. To that he answers, that neither 
Titus,
 (whom he desi∣red to go to them), nor any other
 he had sent among them, did make any kind of gain of them, but behaved themselves just after the same manner he had done, being guided by the same Spirit, and walking in the same steps. 
From Ver. 14. to 19.




He shews, he did not speak all this, meerly to purge himself
 
 
fend his own innocency, but to maintain his Apostol
ck authority, tha
 
 
proofs and exhortations might be of more force and effect among them, and so for their good, which he heartily desired, as he solemnly protests
. For he fears, when he comes among them, he shall not find them such as he would, but guilty of many sins, and that will force him to be severe in his censures. He fears he shall find some among them fallen into enormous crimes, and continuing in them without repentance, and that will occasion great-heart grief to him, much humiliation and dejection of mind, and necessitate him to exercise his Apo∣stolick authority among them in censuring of them, 
From Ver. 19. to the end.


He tells them again, how he was now a third time preparing to come to 
 them 
[see ch. 12. 14.],
 and if the things amiss among them were not amend∣ed, he would punish the committers of them; and such as were convicted of their crimes by the testimony of two or three witnesses [as the Law injoins, 
Deut. 19.15
] shall be exclud
d from Church-communion. As he told them before, so he tells them now, (as if he were present with them), that in case there be no amendment among them, he will make use of his Apostolick power, (which was very great and extraordinary), by which he inflicted not only spi∣ritual censures, but sometimes also corporal punishments, as appears by the in∣stance of 
Bar Jesus,
 whom he smote with blindness, 
Act. 13.11.
 And they did tempt him thereunto, in that they required a proof from him, whether Christs power did concur with his ministry and jurisdiction, and whether Christ would ratifie his censures, by his judgments following them. He shews, that Christ had owned him, and manifested his power in his ministry among them, by converting many of them, and bestowing the gifts of his Spirit upon them, and by many signs and miracles, which he enabled him to do in the midst of them and by his exercise of spiritual discipline among them. And as Christ appeared to be a weak and a frail man by being crucified, but was evidenced to be God omnipotent by his rising from the dead; so he tells them, if they look upon him, as in himself, and in respect of the afflictions he hath been exercised with, he may appear a meer 
weak
 and 
ordinary
 man, and to be 
weak with Christ,
 and therein like and conformable to him; but yet they should find, that he would shew a resem∣blance of Christs life and strength 
[2 Cor. 10.3.],
 and that the power of Christ liveth in him, and doth manifest it self in him, against impenitent and contuma∣cious sinners. And since they seek a proof of Christs speaking in him, (who first preached the Gospel among them); he bids them look to it, and to examine themselves, whether they be in the Faith, (that is, have a true Faith in them), and whether they be in the state of true Believers, and whether Christ live in them by his Spirit; which they will find to be so, except for the present they are only meer counterfeit unapproved Professors of Christianity. But what∣ever 
they
 were, he hoped 
he
 should not be found such an one himself, but a faithful Servant of Christ, and a true Apostle. 
From Ver. 1. to 7.


Drawing now towards a Conclusion, he tells them, that he earnestly prays and de∣sires they may do that which is 
good
 and 
right,
 and may abstain from all evil. And he prayed thus for them, because he had rather have them good, than having oc∣casion, by punishing their evil manners, to testifie himself an approved and faith∣ful Apostle. For he passeth not for his own credit or reputation, how he be esteemed, so their salvation may be promoted. And if they be innocent, and walk in the truth, they had no reason to fear his authority; for the end of it was to uphold innocency, truth, and righteousness, and only to suppress the con∣trary; and in this sense, the stronger they were, and more vigorous in the acti∣ons

 of the spiritual life, and the more they disarm'd him by their innocency and harmless walking, of his Apostolick power to censure the obstinate, the more it pleased him. For he desired nothing more, than that all things might be brought into good order among them, and the members of the Church which had been put out by Church c
nsures might be restored, and s
t right a∣gain
. Therefore he used the more severity in his Letters, that when he came he might not be forced to ex∣ercise his authority with sharpness; for the end of it was principally 
edification,
 and not 
destruction,
 but only by accident, and in case of willful and final impenitency. 
From Ver. 7. to 11.


He concludes his Epistle, seriously exhorting them to union
 among them∣selves, to be of good comfort in their sufferings for Christ, and to live in peace, praying, that God who is the Au∣thor and Injoiner of love and peace may be with them, and dwell among them with his favourable presence. He exhorts them, according to the custom of those Eastern Churches; to salute one another with a holy kiss, as a token of unity, sincere love, and honour; and so with his accustomed Salutation, he bids them Farewell. 
From Ver. 11. to the end.








SECT. XV.


THE Apostle (as it seems) shortly after this, from 
Mace∣donia
 comes into 
Greece,
 and there stays 
three months, Act.
 20.2, 3. And about this time he seems to have written his 
first Epistle to Timothy,
 then at 
Ephesus,
 whom he had be∣sought to abide there, for the better ordering, instructing, and establishing of that Church.


Timothy
 signifies an 
Honourer of God;
 and so he proved, both in Doctrine and Conversation, according to the happy omen and presage of his Name. He is supposed to be of 
Lystra,
 (a City of 
Lycaonia
 in 
Asia
), for there the Brethren reported well of him. His Father was a 
Greek,
 and a 
Proselyte;
 his Mother a 
Jewess,
 Daughter of 
Lois,
 both sincere Believers. They train∣ed him up from a Child in the Holy Scriptures
, so that 
Paul
 was perswaded that the like 
unfeigned Faith
 dwelt in him as did in his pious Mother and Grandmother. His Father being a 
Greek,
 a 
Gentile-Proselyte,
 and uncircumcised, 
Timothy
 was not circumci∣sed in his infancy after the custom of the 
Jews,
 but being come to maturity 
Paul
 circumcis'd him
, for the gaining of the 
Jews,
 by his ministry. The Apostle made him his Companion in his travels throughout the Churches far and near, whom he most diligently and faithfully served in the work of the Lord, some∣times being left with the Churches newly planted, further to instruct them, sometimes being sent as a Messenger to comfort and establish them. Though he had many bodily infirmities upon him, yet he abounded with many eminent graces and gifts, and in process of time being ordain'd a Minister, with imposition of the hands of the Presbytery, he so approved himself in that office, that he became most affectionately dear to 
Paul,
 insomuch that he makes frequent and honourable mention of him, espe∣cially to the 
Philippians,
 ch. 2.19, 20. 
I have no man like mind∣ed, who will naturally care for your state; for all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christs. But ye know the proof of him, that as a Son with the Father he hath served with me in the Gospel.
 And elswhere he dignifies him with 
excellent titles,
 calling him his 
Brother,
 his 
beloved Son,
 and 
faithful in the Lord,
 his 
natural Son in the Faith,
 his 
fellow-labourer
 in the Gospel of Christ, yea he joins 
Timothy
 with himself in the inscriptions of divers Epistles to the Churches, that so he might both com∣mend 
Timothy's
 worth and authority to the Churches; and also propound him as an exemplary pattern to all faithful Ministers. From 
Corinth
 he accompanied 
Paul
 into 
Asia,
 and when they came to 
Ephesus,
 the Apostle besought him to abide. there to instruct that Church; touching which imployment the Apo∣stle now gives him sundry Precepts and Directions through∣out this whole Epistle.




In which Epistle there are three parts.




1. The 
Preface.


2. The 
Matter or Substance of the Epistle.


3. The 
Conclusion.




 IN the 
Preface
 he asserts his Apostolical authority from the command of God, (whom he stiles our 
Saviour,
 because he gives us Salvation by Christ
), and from the c
mmand of Jesus Christ, who is the ground and object of our hope. He directs his Epistle to 
Timothy,
 whom he calls 
his own Son in the Faith,
 either because he had gained him to the Faith of Christ; or else, because he was his Disciple, and resembled him in 
Faith,
 and 
Doctrine,
 and 
holy Conversation,
 as a Son resembles his Father in face and manners. 
From Ver. 1, 2.


After the Preface he comes to the Body of the Epistle; wherein, 
1.
 He tells him, that he left him at 
Ephesus
, to take care that no strange 
heterod
x
 Doctrines be broached in that Church, and that Fables
, and Jewish Genealogies, and 
praeterscriptural
 Traditions be not heeded or regarded, which rather occasion perplex disputes, than edifying in true piety towards God, and in the Faith of Christ. 
Ver. 3, 4.


2ly.
 Because some false Teachers seem'd to be carried with a perverse zeal to the Law, and mingled 
Faith
 and 
Works
 in the point of Justification; he shews, that the 
true end
 of the Law, and the main scope and drift of it was 
Love, (viz.
 to God and our Neighbour), springing from a pure heart, and a 
d Conscience, and Faith unfeigned, which some not rightly understanding have been carried aside to vain discourses. And while they affect to be thought learned 
Tea∣chers,
 and Expounders of the Law, they betray their own ignorance, not un∣derstanding either what they say, or what they affirm. But here some of his Ad∣versaries might object, that by saying thus, he shewed himself not very well affect∣ed towards the Law. He answers, he did not at all detract from the Law (in reproving those that abused it), but rather commended and taught the right use of it. For he acknowledges, that the 
Law
 rightly understood and preached, was very good, and given for, and serves to excellent purposes, if we make use of it as we ought, not seeking to be justified by the observation of it, but to be directed by it in our obedience, as a perfect rule of life; and to be brought by it unto Christ, 
Gal. 3.24.
 But yet notwithstanding, they were to know that in respect of its 
damnatory
 and 
terrifying
 use, (
viz.
 to constrain to obedience for fear of punishment), so it was not given to the 
righteous
, but to the 
unrighteous
 and wicked, to lawless and dis∣orderly persons. It was given to condemn all sins that are against the sound D
ctrine, which is according to, and taught in the Gospel, (wherein the glorious mercy of God is displayed), and to restrain disorderly persons from such crimes: so that the Gospel agrees with the Law, as to the right regulating of mens lives and manners: for the sins forbidden in the Law, are contrary also

 to the Gospel. 
From Vers. 1. to Vers. 12.


3ly
 Having m
ntion'd the G spel, which was committed to him by Jesus Christ, he takes occasion from thence to assert the Authority of his Apostl
ship against th
se that d
nied it, or by reason of his former course of life, did endeavour to l
ssen it. And, 
1.
 He gives solemn thanks to Christ who committed that gr
at tru
t of preaching the Gospel to him, and enabled him to preach it with suc
ss, and esteemed him faithful, (giving him grace to be so), and honour'd him with the office of an Apostle, who was before a 
Blasphemer
 and a 
Persecutor,
 yet n
t∣withstanding mercy was shewed him, because he did it ignorantly through a false zeal, not rightly informed; and the goodness of God (he acknowledges) abound∣ed towards him, in drawing him to believe in Christ, and removing his former unbelief, working in him l ve to Christ and his Gospel, notwithstanding his former opposition against it; which graces of 
Faith
 and 
Love
 Christ requireth and frameth in the hearts of all his Members by his Spirit, 
[see 2 Tim. 1.13.],
 giving them a right knowledg of himself, and the benefits that are obtainable by him. He further declares, that it need not seem incredible that so wonderful mercy and favour was shewed to him, seeing this is most certain and true, that Christ came into the world to manifest his mercy to sinners, yea great sinners, of which number he had reason to reckon himself to be one, because of his persecuting the Church of God 
[see 1 Cor. 15.9.].
 He further shews, that the Lord had set him f
rth for an example and pattern of his long-suffering, mercy, and admirable grace, that sinners to the end of the World, (who shall hear of his wonderful conversion, and the bounty of Christ towards 
him
), may be assured of his readi∣ness to receive sinners, and may, upon their repentance and believing in him, expect the like goodness and kindness from him t
wards themselves. And thus the Ap stle being ravished with a sweet sense of the greatness of Gods mercy to him, concludes this whole matter with a pathetick 
doxology
 or thanksgiving. 
From Ver. 12. to 18.


4ly.
 He charges 
Timothy
 to carry himself couragiously in the ex
cuti
n of his ministry against all discouragements and oppositions whatsoever, encouraging himself by the Prophesies of holy men, that were uttered before of him, n
mely, that he would 
war a good warfare,
 (in defence of the Gospel) joining sound Doctrine with a good Conscience, and a good holy life; and so should escape the dread∣ful ruin of those, who falling first into impure courses of life, afterwards fall into foul errors, and depart from the sound Doctrine they before embraced: Such were 
Alexander
 and 
Hymenaeus,
 [who, it seems, denied the Resurrection, 
2 Tim. 2.14. & 18.
], whom he had by excommunication delivered up to Satan, to chasten and afflict them, that so they might repent and come to an acknowledgment of their errors, and might take heed for the future of blaspheming or speaking evil of wholsom Doctrine and the truths of God. 
From Ver. 18. to the end.


5ly.
 He instructs 
Timothy
 concerning 
publick prayer,
 shewing him first 
for 
 whom
 it is to be made. In 
general,
 for 
all sorts
 of men; 
particularly,
 for 
Kings,
 and all in authority, that Christians may lead a peaceable and quiet life under them in all godliness and honesty. And the reasons he gives for it are these; 
1.
 Because this is pleasing to G
d, whose will it is, that 
some
 of all

 sorts of men should come to the knowledg of the truth, and be saved, and there∣fore 
some
 among Kings and Magistrates as well as others. And, 
2ly.
 Because there is but one God, who is the Creator of all Nations, and one Mediater be∣tween God and man, Christ Jesus, who died for all sorts, and gave himself a ransom (or price of redemption) for all kinds, orders, and degrees of men what∣soever; and this great truth God design'd in his due time to reveal and manifest, and therefore it was now to be declared and publish'd in Christian assemblies by their making prayers and intercessions for all sorts of men. And particularly, he shews, that the publishing this Doctrine was in an especial manner c mmitted to him, and he was sent of God to instruct the 
Gentiles
 therein, (who where account∣ed the worst of men), and to teach them Faith in Christ, and all other necessary Truths. And this he solemnly protests to be true, that name of the 
Jews
 might be scandaliz'd at his preaching to the 
Gentiles. 2ly.
 He shews, 
where
 publick prayer is to be made, 
viz. every where,
 in any place without exception, where the Church-assembly meets, (all ceremonial d
stinction of places being now re∣mov'd), and that men be enjoin'd, when they come to pray, to lift up holy hands free from injustice and oppression, and to pray with hearts free from hatred and malice
, or doubting of the truth of Gods Promises. He requires also, that Women, when they come into the Church-assemblies to join in prayer and other duties, should be very modestly attir'd; and that they should study rather to exceed others in good works, than brave Clothes. And that they set themselves quietly to learn and receive instruction in the Church-assemblies, and not presume or take upon them to teach; for that were to usurp authority over the 
man,
 which he utterly forbids, for two reasons; 
1.
 Because the man was first formed, and the woman out of him; and that may serve to denote, her subordination to, and dependance on him. 
2ly.
 The woman was first 
deceived
 and seduced, and became 
Satan
's instrument to seduce her Husband to transgress Gods Commandment; whence God impos'd upon her, 
subjection
 to her Husband, and sorrow in 
Child-bearing, Gen. 3.16.
 But lest 
women
 should be too much discourag'd at this, he c mfortably levisies what he had said, by assuring them, that notwithstanding this their sorrow and danger in Child bear∣ing, they may be saved as well as men, if they persevere in faith, love, sanctity, sobriety, and modesty. 
From Ver. 8. to the end.


 
6ly.
 He comes now to instruct him concerning 
Church officers,
 viz. 
Bishops
 and 
Deacons,
 shewing him, how 
they,
 and how their 
wives
 ought to be quali∣fied. And first he premises, that the Pastoral office is an honourable Function, and commends those who being fitly qualified, and duely called, do out of sincere ends undertake it, 
viz.
 that by labouring in the Gospel they may bring men to eternal Salvation. Then he sets down Sixteen requisites to a 
good Bishop.
 He must be 
blameless,
 that is, free from scandal; the 
husband of one wife,
 no Polygamist; 
vigilant
 over his Flock, to preserve them from seduction; 
sober
 and temperate; 
of good behaviour,
 gravely weighing and considering his words and actions, and carrying himself so as not to expose himself to contempt; 
given to hospitality,
 ready to entertain and refresh those that are in need, according to his ability, especially strangers and banished Christians; 
apt to teach,
 well in∣structed in the Doctrine of Christianity, and skilful to divide the word aright, and to accommodate his teaching to the edification of his auditors; not given to wine, no striker; not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient; not a brawler; nor covetous; one that governs his own Family well, else he cannot in reason be thought fit to take care of the Church of God; not a 
novice,
 that is, one n
wly instructed in the Faith, and planted in the Church, and not sufficiently experienced in the mysteries of the Gospel, lest being lifted up with pride and vanity, he fall into condemnation with the Devil, who for his pride was cast out of Heaven into the torments of Hell, 
2 Pet. 2 4.
 likewise that he be of an unstained reputation, even among those that have not yet embraced the Faith, lest being upbraided by them

 for his former wickedness, he be tempted to seek occasions to revenge himself, which is a great snare of the Devil; or lest the Devil make use of those reproaches to insnare others, and give them aversions to the Doctrine of such a man, who is under so much scandal for his former life. He shews also, how 
Deacons
 must be qualified, prescribing, that they should be proved and tried concerning their suffi∣ciency, piety, and good behaviour. He shews, they must be 
sober
 and 
grave
 per∣sons; not cunning and deceitful, not given to excess in drinking, not greedy of filthy lucre; but such as being orthodox in point of Faith, live pure and Christian lives, according to the Doctrine and directions of the Gospel. He declares, that they must be no 
Polygamists,
 as too many in that age (it seems) were, but the Husbands of one Wife at once; and such as govern their Children and their Families well. And lest any should despise the 
Deaconship
 as a mean office, he shews, that those who faithfully discharge this office
, purchase to themselves a good degree of respect, and also lay a foundation of rising to a higher degree in the Church, and if they come to be 
Presbyters,
 they preach the Gospel, or the Do∣ctrine 
f Faith
 in Christ with greater boldness and confidence. 
From Ver. 1. to 14.


7ly.
 He shews him, why he gave him these Directions, namely, that he might kn
w h
w to behave himself in the 
Church,
 which is the House or Family of God, in which he dwells by his Spirit, and wherein he is truly worshipped; which 
Church
 is the Pillar or Basis of Evangelical truth, holding it forth, and pub∣lishing it to the world; sustaining it and keeping it from sinking. Now of this Evangelical truth he sets down 
six principal heads
 and mysteries 
1.
 That Christ the Eternal Son of God, took on him our nature, and did visibly appear among men in an humane shape. 
2ly.
 That he was justified by the Spirit, by or by his Divine Nature, by which he rais'd himself from the dead, and consequently de∣monstrated himself to be the Eternal Son of God, and proved himself to be just and innocent, although he was condemned as a Malefactor by the 
Jews
 and 
Gen∣tiles, [Rom. 1.4. 1 Pet. 3.18.]. 3.
 That he was seen and attended, ac∣knowledged, and adored by 
Angels
 at his 
birth [Luk. 2.14.],
 at his 
tempta∣tion [Math. 4.11.],
 at his 
passion [Luk. 22.43.],
 at his 
resurrection [Luk. 24 4.],
 of which things they were glorious witnesses, 
[Math. 28.2. 1 Pet. 1.12.]. 4ly.
 That he was preached by his Apostles among the 
Gen∣tiles
 as well as the 
Jews. 5.
 That he was believ'd on by many in the several Nations of the World; the sound of his Gospel going out into all the Earth, 
[Rom. 10.18. Col. 1.5, 6.]. 6ly.
 He was visibly and with a glorious ap∣pearance of Angels receiv'd up into Heaven, from whence sending down the Holy Ghost, and giving gifts unto men, to this very day he manifests the glory of his Deity. These are the Doctrines which he orders the Church should hold fast, from whence all the rest derive their original and establishment. 
From Ver. 14. to the end.


8ly.
 He now prophetically warns 
Timothy,
 (that he may forewarn the 
 Church), of the Apostasie and defection of some from the Christian Faith, and sound Doctrine of the Gospel in the latter
 times, [or in the following times]; which defection was expresly re∣veal'd to him by the Holy Ghost. The cause of which de∣fection he shews, would be the arising of 
seducing Spirits,
 who being hypocrites, and men of feared Consciences, would preach and propagate Doctrines of Devils
, that is, whereof the Devil is the Author and Fomentor, 
forbid∣ding marriage,
 (to some me
), which God allows, and ertain 
meats,
 (at some times), whereas God allows a

 free use of his good Creatures to Believers, and permits those who know and be∣lieve the Gospel freely to partake of them, with thanksgiving; all difference of meats, being taken away under the New Testament, and every Creature
 sanctified, (that is, made holy and lawful for us to use, 
1 Cor. 7.14. Tit. 1.15.
), by the 
word of God
 certifying us, and warranting us, that we may lawfully use it; and by 
prayer,
 which must be put up to God that it may be made wholsom and blessed to us. 
From Ver. 1. to 6.


9ly.
 He gives 
Timothy
 several Exhortations, in reference to his ministerial office. As first, To suggest th
se things, which the Apostle had taught him, fre∣quently to the Brethren, whereby he would approve himself a good Minister of Christ, and one nourished
 up with the sincere Doctrine of the Gospel, which he had attained to by the Apostles preaching. And 
2ly.
 That he should avoid 
Jewish
 Fa∣bles, and human Traditions, (which are no more to be valued than old Wives Fables), and exercise himself un∣to real Godliness. For bodily exercise, such as outward 
austerities, abstinences
 from meats, and such like volun∣tary afflictings of themselves, prescribed by men, are not the things wherein mans true holiness before God consists. For though these things may be of some use in some cases, yet they are but of little value in comparison of true Godliness, seeing they do only tame the body, not sanctifie and change the heart, as a lively faith and love, and the fear of God, do. And then 
these
 may be abus'd and degenerate into superstition, (as the Apostle testifies, 
Col. 2.23.
), but true Godliness is always acceptable unto God, and profitable unto men, having promises of happiness both in this life and that which is to come, annexed to it. This, he shews, was a true saying, and very worthy to be re∣ceived. And for rejecting the inventions of men, and defending and maintaining true Godliness, (which consists in Faith and Obedience); he shews, he laboured and suffered reproach, having confidence in 
Gods promise
 made to true piety, and in 
his salvation,
 who as he is (in respect of outward preservations) the Preserver of Men and Beasts, 
Psal. 36.6, 7.
 so he affords more especial preserva∣tions to Believers in this life, when he sees it conducing to his glory and their good), but assuredly and certainly, he will preserve them from eternal misery in the other world. These things he charges 
Timothy
 to teach and inculcate. 
3ly.
 He exhorts him, to give no occasion that his Youth be despised, but to sup∣ply what was wanting to him in age, with gravity of manners; and to be an example to Believers in 
speech
 and conversation, in charity, in spiritual zeal, and holy affections, in faithfulness and fidelity in his office, and lastly, in all purity. 
4ly.
 He exhorts him, to be diligent in reading the Scriptures, and in the preach∣ing the Word, while he had an opportunity to stay there; for when the Apostle came thither, he must go along with him, and accompany him in his travels. He ex∣horts him, not to neglect the gift or office that was given him at his Ordinati∣on
, because this office was committed to him by a special prophetick revelation given to some Prophet, that he should be taken into the ministry, and should prove an emi∣nent instrument therein, 
[see ch. 1.18. 2 Tim. 16.7.].
 He exhorts him, to meditate on the things that concern'd his Function, and to give himself up wholly unto them, that his improvements in all the parts of his ministry may be manifested to all. And lastly, that he should take heed to himself and his Doctrine
, and continue so doing, which would conduce to his own and his hearers eternal salvation. 
From Ver. 6. to the end.




10ly.
 In the next place, he directs him, how to order and temper his reproofs, 
 to 
elder
 and 
younger
 men and women. The elder sort, he shews, must not be dealt with 
roughly
 and 
rigidly,
 but with due respect to their age, according to the fifth Commandment. The 
younger
 sort must be treated with all kindness and friendliness; and he must look that he behave himself with all purity in the discharge of this duty. 
Ver. 1, 2.


11ly.
 He gives Precepts concerning poor widows, who were to be Servants of the Church, as 
Deaconesses,
 and to be kept by the publick charge of the Church, which he calls honouring of them
; for so their repu∣tion would be preserved, whereas if they should be redu∣ced to extream poverty they would be contemptible. He shews, what kind of 
widows
 are thus to be maintained. 
1.
 Such as have neither Children nor Grandchildren to per∣form this duty duty of piety
 to them, (which is so acceptable to God), and to take care of them, as part of their Family; this being due by way of gratitude to 
Pa∣rents
 who have done so much for their Children; and therefore Children should imitate the Stork
 herein, which Bird is famous for nourishing and cherishing its aged Parents, and as it were, endeavouring to requite them. 
2.
 Such as being destitute of friends, have none to trust in and rely upon, but God alone, (who is the Father of the widdows and the fatherless, 
Psal. 68.6.
), and such as daily
 give themselves to the exercises of piety and devotion, as 
Anna
 did, 
Luk. 2.36. 3.
 Such as are not of the number of wanton widows, who indulge themselves in idleness and pleasure, being as it were 
dead
 while they live, both in respect of 
God
 whom they do not serve, and in respect of 
humane society
 which they do not benefit. These Precepts he gives, that none but 
blameless
 persons may be taken into the Church's allowance, and those that are really necessitous. And that the Church may not be unnecessarily burdened, he declares, that if any man or woman provide not for those of their own family, (if they be able), they do that which is utterly incompatible with the Christian Faith, of which they make profession, and are worse than 
infidels,
 who even by the light of Nature use to do this. 
4ly.
 He orders, that no widdows be admitted into the number of those that are to be maintained by the Church, but such an one as is not under sixty years of age
, and that hath been the wife of
 one husband, that is, hath not had two husbands at once, or if her husband hath sent her a Bill of divorce, upon his repudiation of her, hath married no other. 
5ly.
 That she be such an one as hath been well reported of for good works, and bath, by acts of duty and charity, approved her self to those among whom she hath lived, in all things of which her condition hath been capa∣ble; such as are, careful edification of Children, hospitali∣ty, friendliness, and humility
, and exercising her self in all sorts of good works. He comes now to shew, what 
widdows
 are not to be received into the Churches service, or to the office of Deaconesses, nor to live upon the Chur∣ches maintenance, 
viz.
 the 
younger women. 1.
 Because there was danger, left being pampired with the Churches bread, they should wax wanton against Christ, that is, not regard the service which they have promised to Christ, and his Church, as some younger widdows (whom possibly he points at) had already done: who despairing of marriage in the Church had revolted from the Faith, that they might marry some infidel out of the Church; whose condition he shews, to be damnable and miserable, because they had renounced that Faith in Christ, which they at first made profession of in Baptism; and further he shews, that such widows are

 commonly 
idle,
 and wander about from house to house, curiously prying into, and tatling of other folks matters, and medling with things th
y ought not. He ad∣viseth therefore, that the younger widows, (if they have not the gift of Conti∣nence
) should betake themselves to a married life, and serve God in that, bear∣ing and bringing up Children, guiding their own houses and families, that they give no occasion of reproach to these that are strangers to the Faith, and are apt enough t
 seek occasion to accuse and find fault with Christians. And he tells them, there were some such, who having foraken the Christian Faith, had beta∣ken themselves to the territories of Satan, and being bitter enemies to Christians, would be glad to have somewhat to say against them. Concluding therefore this matter, he adviseth, that if any Christian have any helpless wid
w of his own family, that he undertake the care and charge of her, (if he be able), and not cast her upon the Church, lest there be not in the stock of the Church sufficient to provide for all that are truly helpless. From whence it appears, that if there were no poor and honest widows in the Church, of sixty years of age, there was no necessity to make provision for them, or empl
y them in the Churches service, and by c
nsequence, that the ministry of women in the Deaconship was not need∣ful, unless by accident, when they were maintained by the publick charge, that they might not be altogether useless. 
From Ver. 3. to 17.


12ly.
 He gives directions concerning 
Presbyters
 or 
Elders
 in office, that are imployed in the government of the Church, as well as in preaching the word. And he i
j
ius, 
1.
 That they be accounted worthy of 
double honour,
 and be liberally maintained, especially those that labour in Word and Doctrine
; which Precept he confirms, 
partly
 from the analogy of the Law of 
Moses,
 forbidding the muzling the Oxe that tread∣eth out the Corn, 
[Deut. 25.4.],
 but allowing him to feed all the time he doth the work, and so to have a certain reward for his labour; and 
partly
 from the rule of our Saviour, that 
the labourer is worthy of his reward, Luk. 18 7. Mat. 10.10. 2ly.
 He injoins, that an ac∣cusation be not received against an Elder under two or three witnesses. 
3ly.
 If 
Elders,
 or any others, 
sin openly,
 he orders, that they should be publickly reproved, that others may fear to offend after their example. 
4ly.
 He solemnly charges 
Timothy,
 that Ecclesiastical administrations and cen∣sures be performed without partiality, or respect of persons. 
5ly.
 That he do not rashly ordain or receive persons into the sacred ministry, l
st if they prove wick∣ed and unworthy afterwards, their miscarriages he imputed to him; and if other Presbyters will rashly ordain such, he adviseth 
him
 not to consent to them therein. He advises him, to keep himself pure from these and other sins, which were then so rise among them. Yet he spake not this, to prohibit him from drinking a little Wine
 m
derately for his health. And as to that Precept, 
of not partaking of other mens sins,
 he shews, he spake not of 
open sins,
 which were manifest; for the sins of some 
Candidates
 for the ministry are manifest be∣fore they are chosen, and go before
 to condemn them, as utterly unfit for that office; but some mens sins follow after judgment hath pass'd upon them, that is, appear not, and are not known till after their ordination, and then their hypocrisie breaks out. In like manner the virtues and good works of some are manifestly known, that 'tis easie for the Church to judg them fit to be admitted into the ministry; and the evil works of those that are otherwise (which upon inquisition made, cannot for the present be discovered) notwithstanding will not long be hid, but in their own time be brought to light; so that if the Church cannot prevent sometimes, but that some hypocrites will be

 admitted into the Ministry, yet when their faults are manifest, they may deal with them according to the discipline of the Church. 
From Ver. 17. to the end.


13ly.
 He now directs him, to instruct Christian 
Servants
 to be obedient to 
 their own 
Masters,
 whether they were Infidels or Believers. If their Ma∣sters were 
Infidels,
 they should notwithstanding carry themselves dutifully and re∣spectfully towards them, seeing by the providence of God they were placed under them, that so the Gospel be not evil-spoken of among Infidels, through the mis∣carriages of Christian Servants. If their Masters were 
Believers,
 they should serve them the more readily, because they were Believers, and Brethren, beloved of God, and partakers of the Redemption purchased by Christ, and of the grace of Adoption. Or, (as some translate the words), because believing Masters are such as will be careful to recompence the well doing of their Servants
. These things he enjoins 
Timothy
 to teach and to exhort other Pastors to teach the same likewise. 
Ver. 1, 2.


14ly.
 He exhorts him, not to have fellowship with 
new-fangled Teachers,
 who depart from the Apostolical verity and simplicity in the matter and manner of their teaching; and being proud, and knowing nothing solidly in the mystery of the Gospel, are contentious about words, and verbal controversies, (from which springs nothing but uncharitableness), being men of a corrupt and perverse mind dis∣covering themselves more studious of gain than godliness, and designing by their preaching, to serve and promote their worldly profit. 
Ver. 3, 4, 5.


15ly.
 He exhorts 
him
 and other Pastors, to pursue after real piety, out of which springs true contentment
, (and so is the great∣est gain); and to take heed of covetousness, and the in∣ordinate love of money, which is the root of so many evils, and betrays men to so many temptations and snares, to so many hurtful and ruining lusts, to defection from the faith, to vexation and an∣guish of mind here, and eternal perdition hereafter: And instead of following af∣ter that, to f
llow after spiritual riches, namely, those excellent graces of righ∣teousness, godliness, perseverance in the Faith, love, meekness, patience, with which the Pastors of the Church ought more especially to be inriched. 
From Ver. 6. to 12.


16ly.
 He excites and stirs him up to Christian fortitude, in maintaining the true faith of the Gospel 
[Jude v. 3.],
 against all the persecutions of the world, and oppositions and contradictions of Heretical Teachers 
[2 Tim. 4.7.],
 and so to strive in this course, that he may secure a 
right
 and 
title
 unto, and at last attain the Crown of Eternal Life, unto which God had graciously called him; remembring, how he had, either at his 
Baptism
 or 
Ordination,
 made a famous profession before many witnesses, that he would faithfully serve Christ. He solemnly charges and adjures him and others, to whom the Pastoral charge should be committed, before 
God
 who giveth life to all that have life, and will raise all dead men to life again; and before 
Jesus Christ
 who bore his Testimony to the truth before 
Pontius Pilate [Joh. 18.37.],
 and therein gave him an example of confessing the truth, which be should imitate, that he and they faithfully observe this command, which is contained in 
ver. 11.12.
 of this Chapter; labouring to be without spot and blemish in their several

 times and ages to the coming of Christ to judgment
, whose appearing the All-glorious God will in his due time manifest, who is omnipotent and immortal in himself, and dwells in light inaccessible, whom none can see with mortal eyes, who ought by all men to be praised and magnified for ever. 
From Ver. 12. to 17.


17ly.
 He directs him, what duties to charge upon the rich, 
viz.
 that they be humble, that they trust in God and not in their riches, (who giveth us all things liberally, to make use of with moderation and thankfulness); that they be charitable, laying
 up for themselves, as a treasure against the time to come, a good foundation, or a well-grounded hope of attaining eternal life, setled on the promise of God, made to all those who in Faith ap∣ply themselves to the practise of good works, 
Mat. 10.42. Gal. 6.8, 9. Heb. 13.16. 1 Pet. 2.5. From Ver. 17. to 20.


18ly. Lastly,
 He solemnly exhorts 
Timothy,
 to maintain the purity of Evangelical Doctrine, which was committed to his trust, as a pledg to keep safe∣ly, and transmit to posterity; and that he restrain the prophane wranglings and disputings
 of Sophisters about divine matters, fram'd out of erroneous grounds, and principles of 
Sciences,
 so termed, but falsely; which some professing and glorying in, have miserably erred concerning the Faith; and de∣serted Christianity; by which words, he seems to point at the 
Gnosticks,
 who have their name from 
Science,
 and profound knowledg, which they vainly arrogated to them∣selves. And so he concludes with his Apostolical Vale∣diction. 
From Ver. 20. to the end.








SECT. XVI.


PAul
 in the time of his three Months stay in 
Greece,
 visits 
Athens
 and 
Corinth;
 and being almost ready to sail into 
Syria,
 (to carry the Alms and Collections made in 
Macedonia
 and 
Achaia
 for the poor Saints in 
Judea
); he writes from 
Co∣rinth
 that eminent Epistle to the 
Romans,
 as may be gathered from 
Rom.
 15.25, 26. and sent it by 
Phoebe
 a Servant of the Church of 
Cenchrea,
 near 
Corinth,
 as appears from 
Rom.
 16.1.


The Apostle 
Paul
 had a great desire and real intention to vi∣sit the 
Romans,
 that he might personally, and 
vivâ voce,
 con∣firm them in the Faith; but seeing himself still hindred by one thing after another, at last (being stirred up by the Spirit of God) he resolves to write unto them, and accordingly sent them this Epistle.


In which we may observe these 
three parts.


1. The 
Preface,
 wherein he testifies his great affection to them, and pre∣pares their minds to receive his subsequent instructions. 
Chap.
 1. 
from Ver.
 1. 
to
 17.


2. The 
Body of the Epistle,
 which is partly 
doctrinal,
 asserting the main point of the Christian Religion, viz. 
Justification by Faith in Christ;
 from 
ver.
 17. 
of chap.
 1. 
to chap.
 12. And partly 
practical,
 treating of 
Moral duties,
 and a Christian Conversation, required of all justified persons. 
From ch.
 12. 
to ver.
 14. 
of ch.
 15.


3. The 
Conclusion. From ver.
 14. 
of ch.
 19. 
to the end.


The 
occasion
 of this Epistle seems to be this: The Apostle had heard of some 
disagreements,
 both in 
judgment
 and 
affection,
 among the Christians at 
Rome,
 who were partly 
believing Jews,
 and partly 
believing Gentiles.
 The 
Jewish
 Christians, it seems, mingled 
Law
 and 
Gospel
 together in the point of Justification; and so zealously upheld the 
Jewish
 Law, and the 
Mosaical
 Rites, that they opposed the preaching of the Gospel to the 
Gentiles,
 except they would become 
Proselytes,
 and submit to 
Circumcision:
 On the other side, the 
Gentile-Christians
 understanding themselves exempted from the observation of the 
Mosaical
 Rites, used their Christian Liberty 
with offence.
 Now to reconcile these controversies, and to settle them, 
both
 in the truth, and in unity of judgment and affection, and to remove all emulation be∣tween them, the Apostle writes this Epistle. In which we have,


1.
 THE 
Preface
 or 
Introduction:
 wherein, to gain the more credit and be∣lief to his following Instructions, he shews, That he was one who had re∣ceived 
 that singular mercy from Christ, to be called to the high dignity of an 
Apostle,
 and was authoriz'd, and set apart to the office of preaching the Gospel, which God had promised long before by his 
Prophets
 in the Old Testament, that it should be revealed, and that to the 
Gentiles
 as well as to the 
Jews.
 The subject matter of which Gospel, he shews, concerns 
Jesus Christ,
 his Son, who ac∣cording to the flesh was born of the Seed of 
David;
 but 
according to the Spirit of Holiness,
 or that 
other Divine Nature
 in him, (call'd his 
Eternal Spirit, Heb. 9.14. see also 1 Tim. 3.16.
 & 
1 Pet. 3.18.
), he is most fully and powerfully demonstrated, and declared to be the Son of G
d; as by many other signs, so especially by his Resurrection from the dead. From this Saviour,

 he tells them, he had received the favour of this glorious office of the Apostle∣ship
, to preach the Gospel in his Name, and by his authority, and for his glory; among all Nations, to bring them to the obedience of the Doctrine of Faith, and to confirm them therein. And though he had not planted
 the Gospel among them at 
Rome,
 yet he held himself bound to contribute to the advancement of the Faith of those of them, who were effectually called by Christ, and had obedientially subjected themselves to the Gospel. And accordingly he heartily wished the abounding and increase of all grace, and the sweet sense of the favour and love of God to all real Christians at 
Rome,
 whether 
Jews
 or 
Gentiles.
 And in the first place, that he may testifie his great affection to them, he declares, how heartily he gives thanks to God through Jesus Christ, (in whose Name all prayers and thanksgiving ought to be presented, 
Eph. 5.20. Col. 3.17.
), that their Faith and sub∣mission to the Gospel, was so famous, and the report of it spread far and near, and made known in all the Churches of the whole World, and spoken of to their great advantage and commendation. Insomuch that he solemnly professes in the presence of God, (whom he heartily and sincerely served in the Gospel of his Son), he did not forget them in his daily prayers; but earnestly requested of the Lord, that what he had so long desired and designed, might happily, (if it seem'd good in his eyes), at last be accomplished, namely, that he might come personally unto them. For he had an extream great desire to see them, not for any other reason, so much as that he might impart unto them some of those spi∣ritual gifts which God had endued him with, and might communicate to them a further knowledg of the mysteries of the Gospel, that they might be more established and confirmed in the Faith, against all temptations whatsoever. Yea he desired to see them, that they might be mutually comforted, by a mutual communication of the Faith, that both 
he
 and 
they
 had in Christ Jesus. For it could not but greatly comfort and strengthen 
them,
 to hear him discourse of his Faith in Christ, and it would also revive 
him
 to hear them declare their Faith in the same Je∣sus also; and so they might be mutual comforts each to other. He desires they should know that he had often purposed to come unto them, but still by one obsta∣cle or other was hindred; and he desired to come to them, that he might be a means of converting some there to the Faith, and of confirming others already converted, as among other 
Gentiles
 he had been a means of converting several, and gaining them to Christ. For by the nature of his office, and by the special com∣mand of Christ, he was a 
debter
 to all sorts of men, being obliged to preach the Gos∣pel to them, whether they were 
Greeks,
 those of the most 
polite
 Nations; or 
Barbarians,
 and those of the 
ruder.
 And as far as concerned himself, he was most ready to take a journey to 
Rome,
 to preach the Gospel there also. For he was far from being asham'd of the Gospel of Christ, which is a powerful means (in the hand of God) of bringing all those to Salvation, that effectually embrace it, whether they be 
Jews
 (who had the priviledg to have it first preached to them) or 
Gentiles. From Ver. 1. to 17.


2.
 He comes now to the 
Body of the Epistle:
 And having mention∣ed the 
Gospel,
 he shews, that by it the 
Righteousness of God,
 that is, the Righteousness whereby we stand just and righteous in the sight of God, (which God imputes to sinners, and accepts for their righteousness, and pardons them for it, 
see ch. 3.22.
), is revealed and taught, and clearly made known to be 
of Faith,
 [or 
by Faith], unto Faith;
 that is, 'tis revealed to be by 
such a


 Faith as groweth and increaseth from one degree
 and measure to another. As Faith increaseth, and is more and more capable of discerning Gods righteousness, so more of his righteousness is still manifested unto it. Or from 
one kind of Faith to another, viz.
 from the Faith of the 
Old Testament,
 to the Faith of the 
New;
 so that never any was, or shall be justified otherwise than by Faith
. Or 
by Faith, unto Faith;
 that is, the righteousness of God is revealed to be 
by Faith
 to encourage people 
unto Faith,
 and to believe in Christ, that by believing they may obtain Salvation. And this is the 
main proposition,
 which he explains and confirms by many arguments, from ver, 
17.
 of ch. 
1.
 to ch. 
12.
 namely, that 
we are justified by Faith in Christ, and not by Works, or our internal Righteousness.
 This he proves, 
1.
 By a citation out of the Prophet 
Habuccuc, ch. 2. v. 4.
., where the Prophet speaking of the calamities that was coming upon the 
Jews
 by the 
Caldeans,
 shews, how different the car∣riage and behaviour of the 
wicked
 would then be, from that of the righteous in such a danger. The heart of the 
wicked
 would be high, and proud, and lift up in a foolish conceit of their own wisdom, and power to secure themselves. But the 
righteous,
 (such as were in a state of reconciliation with God), should 
live,
 and find comfort in that trouble, by their 
Faith
 in God. So the Apostle shews, that he that is 
evangelically righteous,
 or 
just,
 shall 
live,
 not only a life of grace here, but attain to a life of glory hereafter; by 
Faith in Christ,
 and resting on his righteousness and merits. 
2ly.
 He shews, that men have need of this imputed righteousness of Christ; because of themselves, they are all 
unrighteous;
 and God hath revealed his wrath from Heaven against such. This he proves by instancing first in the 
Gentiles,
 secondly in the 
Jews.


1.
 For the 
Gentiles,
 he shews, they were guilty of detaining the truth of God, (that is, the true notions they had of God, and their duty to 
him,
 and 
their Neighbour
 by the light of Nature), in unrighteousness; so that they would not walk according to that light, but suppressed it, and resisted it. For 
that
 which may be naturally known of God, (
viz.
 his infinite power, wisdom, and goodness), is manifest 
in them,
 that is, in their minds and consciences, (though they followed not the light shining in them): or is manifest 
among them, viz.
 by the writings and discourses of their learned men. For God hath made it known unto them, partly by imprinting those Notions of Himself, and of 
good
 and 
evil
 in their hearts; and partly by the Book of the Creatures, in which his glorious 
Attributes
 are written in great Characters. For his invisible and in∣comprehensible Nature, and Almighty Power, are (even ever since the Creation of the World) clearly to be understood by his works which are seen, 
viz.
 his works of 
Creation
 and 
Providence,
 so far as to render those, which do not discern them, nor take notice of them, 
inexcusable.
 And seeing they glorified not God according to that knowledg, which the light of Nature gave them of him, nor were thankfull for his benefits; they became vain in their imaginations and reasonings concerning God, and his worship, and feigned many fabulous and vain Gods unto themselves, whereby their foolish heart was more and more dark∣ned concerning the 
true God;
 and those among them that seemed to be most wise and learned, were in those matters as blind and foolish as others. Insomuch, that they horribly dishonoured the All-glorious God, by framing the vile Images of men and beasts to represent him, 
[Isa. 40.18. Psal. 106.20.];
 whereas they should have conceived God to be so infinitely glorious, that nothing could set forth his glory sufficiently. Ʋpon which provocation of theirs, God gave them up 
judi∣cially
 to the lusts of their own hearts; so that being left to themselves, (and not restrained from the pursuit of their filthy desires), they brake out into pol∣lutions

 and uncleannesses, of the most odious kinds; which God permitted them to fall into, as a punisment upon them for their horrible Idolatry, they having changed the truth of God, that is, the true Notions they had of God, into an Idol
 (call'd here a 
lye,
 because it seems to 
be,
 what it is not, and deceives men as a lye doth), and worship∣ped and served the Creature, forsaking the 
Creator,
 who is blessed for evermore, and whose glory and blessedness will abide for ever, notwithstanding all the impiety of Ido∣laters. Yea upon this provocation it was, that God so far left them to them∣selves, that they fell into the most unnatural lusts, such as are not found even among brute Beasts. And so they receiv'd a just recompence and reward for their Idolatry, (which is call'd spiritual whoredom), in being left by God to the vilest of all corporal uncleanness. And 'tis no wonder, that 
they
 should not keep the 
Order
 of Nature, who forsook the 
Author
 of Nature, as 
Anselm
 speaks. Fur∣thermore, He shews, that they regarding not to know God, so far as by the light of Nature and the works of Creation they might have done, nor to acknow∣ledg and reverence him accordigly, God as a just Judg, gave them to a reprobate or injudicious mind, whereby they approv'd of nothing that was right and good, but fell into most gross abominations and enormities; and that against the 
second Table
 as well as against the 
first.
 Of which sins, reigning among the Heathen 
Ro∣mans,
 he gives a large Catalogue
. And in conclusion, as an aggravation of their guilt and unrighteousness, he adds, that though they had a sense im∣planted upon their hearts of the 
righteous
 
judgment
 of God, and the pu∣nishment that he will inflict upon such transgressors, yet they not only committed those sins themselves, but also took pleasure and delight in those that committed them. 
From Ver. 17. to the end.


 Having thus shewed the 
Gentiles,
 generally, to be most grievous sinners, and so condemned, and not justified by their own works; He now comes to answer an objection which some of them might make against what he had said. They might possibly say, What shall our 
Lawgivers
 and 
Magistrates
 (who condemn vice, and commend virtue) be so deeply censured? For answer to this, the Apostle (by an elegant 
Apostrophe,
 wherein he speaketh as it were 
face to face
 to this 
Gentile
 who thus objecteth) acknowledges, that 'twas true, they had some among them that declared against wickedness and punished it. But those were the most inexcusable of all others, because they themselves did the like, or as ill things (though more secretly) as those which they condemned in others. And they might assure themselves that the wrath and judgment of God (which is just and according to the merit of the deed) is against them that do such things, whether 
secretly
 or 
openly.
 For tell me (says he) thou 
Magistrate,
 who judgest ano∣ther for crimes that thou thy self committest; canst thou in reason think to escape the righteous judgment of God? Or canst thou think, because God hath hitherto spared thee, that thou shalt finally escape? Dost not thou consider that Gods long suffering and forbearance invites thee to repentance, and not to go on in thy sins. Dost not thou consider, that by thy impenitence and persisting in thy sins, thou treasurest up to thy self wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render to every man according to his works, either the rewards of his grace, or the punishments of his justice; namely, 
eternal life
 to them that persevere in obedience to the truth, hoping for, and expecting such a reward; but to the Adversaries of the truth, and servants of unrighteousness, besides the manifestations of his wrath in this life, 
eternal death
 and 
misery
 at the end of it. And God will have no respect to any Nation (however priviledged) in this matter, but in every Nation they that fear him,

 and work righteousness shall be rewarded with 
glory, honour,
 and 
eternal peace;
 and they that go on in their sins and impenitency, shall be punished with 
eternal death
 and 
misery;
 and that, whether they be 
Jews
 or 
Gentiles.
 For God measures not men by their outward conditions and circumstances, so as upon that account, to accept or reject any man. And therefore the 
Gentiles,
 who had not the Law written in Tables, but had it written upon their Hearts, shall be judged by that innate Law which they have violated, and not by the other. And the 
Jews,
 who sin against the Law given them by 
Moses,
 shall be judged according to the threatnings of that Law. Nor is it possible that the 
Jews,
 because they 
know the Law,
 and hear it often read in their Synagogues, should be accounted righteous before God, except they perform perfect obedience to it, which because they cannot do, it follows that they cannot be exempted from de∣served condemnation; and so they have need to seek for righteousness by Christ, as well as others. And as for the 
Gentiles,
 who have not the 
written Law
 as delivered by 
Moses,
 yet have it imprinted in their hearts, and do by the light of Nature, some things which God hath commanded in his Law; to 
these,
 that Law 
within them,
 is a Law, as their own Consciences do witness, their thoughts, or reflections,
 by turns
 
accu∣sing
 them when they do ill, and 
excusing
 them when they do well. Therefore they have nothing to pretend, why they should not undergo deserved condemnation for their sins; much less have the 
Jews.
 And this he tells them, will appear to be most just at the day of judgment, when God shall judg the secret and hidden things of men by Jesus Christ, according to the Doctrine which he, his Apostle, (having learn't it of him), had every where preached
. For by the light of Nature it did not appear, by whom God would judg the world, but it was declar'd and manifested in the Gos∣pel
, whereof 
Paul
 was a Minister. 
From Ver. 1. to 17.


2.
 Having thus handled the case of the 
Gentiles,
 he comes in the next place to speak of the 
Jews,
 who would possibly alledg for themselves, that some∣thing surely must be allowed to their priviledges, and that they are not to be brought into the same condemnation with the 
Gentiles.
 That he might there∣fore speak more particularly to this case, he brings in (as it were) some prin∣cipal 
Teacher of the Law,
 and 
Patron
 of righteousness 
by Works,
 producing 
seven
 props of his vain confidence; all which the Apostle (by way of concession) allows; and yet proves, that the 
Jews
 are not to expect to be justified by these before God, any more than the 
Gentiles
 may, by that obedience which they perform to the Law of Nature. And in the first place, says he, thou sayest, Thou art a 
Jew,
 which was a 
name,
 not of a Nation only, but of a Professor of the true Religion, and of a Worshipper of the true God. 
2.
 Thou dependest on thy outward performances of Law, on thy Circumcision, 
&c.
 as if justification were to be had thereby, and could not be had without it. 
3.
 Thou makest thy boast of God, 
viz.
 that thou art of that People that were chosen above all other Na∣tions, and are in covenant with God. 
4.
 Thou knowest his will, not from the meer collection of reason, but from the books of 
Moses
 and the 
Prophets. 5.
 Thou triest things that differ, (being instructed therein out of the Law)
, that is, canst distinguish betwixt lawful and unlawful, between what is commanded and what is forbidden. 
6.
 Thou hast such abundant knowledg that thou canst teach others. 
7.
 Thou hast a model, or scheme, or system in thy head of that know∣ledg, which is here and there scattered up and d
wn, and contained in the Law. The Apostle answers, that all these things being granted, yet they are insuffici∣ent

 to make any man righteous before God, or to free him from condemnation; for it could not but be granted, that many, if not most of their Rabbies and Teachers did not practise the duties they taught others, but lived in those or the like sins and vices
, which they condemned in others, and so caused the Name of God to be blasphemed among the 
Gentiles
 through their impieties; as the Prophet 
Ezekiel
 complains 
[ch. 36.22, 23.]
 the hypocrites of his time did, who boasted in the same priviledges that these present 
Jews
 boasted of. 
From Ver. 17. to 25.


But the 
Jews
 might here possibly urge and plead their 
Circumcision
 as a Seal of the Covenant between God and them, and thence inferr, that they were not in such danger of condemnation as the 
Gentiles.
 The Apostle answers, that for men that so liv'd as they did, 'twas madness to think that Circumcision will stand them in such stead, as to exempt them from condemnation. For 
Circum∣cision
 will not profit nor avail to justification, except it be joined with perfect obedience to the whole Law; but if transgression of the Law be found in him that is circumcised, he is in the same condition with an 
uncircumcis'd
 Heathen. Yea, if the uncircumcised could do that which the Law requires to justification, that is, perform perfect obedience to the moral Law, they should be accepted of God, as well as if they had been circumcised So that if a 
Gentile,
 who is by Na∣ture without Circumcision could fulfil the moral Law perfectly, he would condemn a 
Jew,
 who is only outwardly (and according to the Let∣ter of the Law
) 
circumcised,
 but hath not that purity of heart and life, which that 
Ceremony
 was ap∣pointed to signifie and engage all that are circumcised unto. For he tells them, that he is not a Child of 
Abraham,
 (such to whom the promise of life appertains), who is only born of 
Abrahams
 race, and no more: neither is 
that
 the available 
Cir∣cumcision,
 which is only outward: 
viz.
 the mark imprinted in the flesh: But he is a 
Jew indeed,
 a true Son of 
Abraham,
 (who shall be accepted with God, although he be not so by birth), who is 
so
 inwardly, and by a true con∣version of his heart to God. For the 
renovation
 of the mind and heart by the Holy Ghost, is the 
true Circumcision,
 and not 
that
 which is outwardly visible in the body, perform'd according to the Letter of the Law; and such renewed persons shall have praise and commendation, if not among men, (who see the outside only, and among whom 'tis a great dignity to be a circumcised 
Jew
); yet with God, who looks into the heart. 
From Ver. 25. to the end.


 He comes now to answer some other Objections, which the 
Jews
 would be apt to make against what he had said. 
1.
 If the case be so, then it will be said, that the 
Jew
 hath no advantage or priviledg above the 
Gentile,
 neither is there any profit of 
Circumcision.
 He answers, that the 
Jews
 have a great advantage above any other Nation, and that, 
1.
 Because unto them were committed 
th
 oracles of God,
 that is, all the 
revelations of his will,
 the 
Law,
 the 
Sa∣cram
nts
 and 
Seals of the Covenant,
 the 
Prophecies
 and 
Promises of the Messiah,
 by which they might more easily come to know the true God, and the way of Salvation 
by the expected M
ssias,
 than any others. And if any shall say, that this advantage was lost, by the unbelief of a great part of them, He answers, that the 
faithfulness
 of God in his Promises and Covenant, is not made void by the unbelief of men. For it ought ever to be acknowledged and confessed, that God cannot be otherwise than true and faithful in performing what

 he hath promised, though all mankind should be false and deceitful, and should fail to perform their duty: And for the proof of this, he cites a passage out of 
Psal. 51.4.
 (according to the version of the Septuagint) where 
David
 hum∣bly confesseth his hainous sin against God, that by his penitent confession God might be 
justified,
 and acquitted from all injustice in reproving him by 
Nathan
 and denouncing those heavy Judgments that he intended to bring upon him, and that he might be clear and unreproveable for so judging him for his sin, and might clearly overcome and win the victory when he should be judged or questioned, or impleaded by any man, for his dealing so severely with 
David.
 So that the Apostle applies these words from the 
hypothesis
 (in 
Davids
 singular case) to the 
thesis, viz.
 to Gods general faithfulness, truth, and righteousness in all his Promises, Covenants, and Proceedings. And thus the 
unrighteousness of men
 is so far from making void, that it more commends, and 
sets off,
 and il∣lustrates the 
righteousness of God.
 But 
2ly.
 It will be said, If this be so, then God seems to be unrighteous in punishing those sins, which do so illustrate, and 
set off
 his righteousness. This Objection the Apostle makes in the person of a carnal man
, ignorant of God, and replies, that the Objection is blasphemous; for 'tis impossible, that he that shall judg the world should be unjust. But 
3ly,
 This man will further object, that, If the truth and faithfulness of God be made more abundantly manifest, by the falseness, lying, and unfaithfulness of man; then he is so far from deserving condemnation for it, that he may securely go on in it, (according to the Apostles Doctrine
), that the glory of God may be more advanced thereby. The Apostle answers, that they were malicious slanderers that charged him or the other Apostles that they held such a wretched 
position
 as this, 
viz. that they might do evil, that good might come of it,
 which he was so far from owning or approving, that he declares their condemnation to be just who bold and practise such Doctrines, and vent such Calumnies. 
5ly,
 But the 
Jews
 will further say, What are not they better, and more righteous, and in a better estate, as to justification by their works, than the 
Gentiles?
 He answers, Not at all; for he had hitherto proved, (
viz.
 in his two first Chap∣ters), that both 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles
 are naturally under sin, and therefore the 
Gospel-righteousness
 is no less necessary for the one, than for the other. This he further proves, by many clear testimonies out of the Old Testament, as out of 
Psal. 14.1, 2, 3. & Psal. 53 1, 2, 3.
 where the Prophet speaking of the 
unre∣generate
 in his time, and of all others in their natural estate, 
out of Christ,
 pronounceth, 
1.
 That 
no man is righteous. 2.
 That all are naturally 
blind
 and 
ignorant
 of the things that concern their Salvation. 
3.
 That 
none
 seek∣eth after God, to know and worship him as they ought. 
4.
 That they are 
all
 gone aside from God, and from the way wherein God appointed them to walk; and being so corrupt by Nature they are unfit to bring forth any good fruits, or to do any good. He goes on further to demonstrate this, from 
Psal. 5.9.
 where from what was spoken of 
Davids
 enemies in 
particular,
 he proves the corruption of all mankind in 
general;
 and that because (naturally) there is the same fountain of corruption in all. 
Their throat,
 says he, is like a Se∣pulcher newly opened, out of which comes nothing but stench and filthiness, 
viz.
 murderous pestilential threatnings; they have a false and deceitful 
tongue;
 their slanders are no less hurtful than the poison of Asps, 
Psal. 140.3.
 their 
mouth
 is full of cursing and bitter speeches, 
Psal. 10.7.
 they are ready to commit all manner of 
cruelty,
 and violence, and know not how to live quietly themselves, nor to suffer others to be quiet, 
Psal. 59.7, 8.
 There is no 
fear
 of God be∣fore their eyes; and so there is nothing to restrain them from running into all sorts of wickedness, 
Psal. 36.21.
 And, lest the 
Jews
 should think to elude and evade the force of these Testimonies, as not belonging to them, he tells them, that what the 
Law,
 that is, the 
books of the Old Testament,
 the 
Psalms
 and 
Prophets
 thus say, they say 
to
 and 
of
 the 
Jews;
 and by complaining so

 much of their universal defection and wickedness, they include 
them,
 and otn only the 
Gentiles,
 to be obnoxious to the wrath of God, and justly punishable by him, without being able to say any thing for themselvs. From all these fore∣cited Testimonies, he concludes, that 
by the works of the Law no flesh shall be justified in the sight of God,
 because man, 
since the fall,
 is disabled by his innate corruption and sin, to fulfil the Law, either 
natural
 or 
written;
 so that all the efficacy it hath, is only to discover to him his sin, and (without Gods mercy in Christ) to seal up to him his condemnation, 
[Gal. 2.16.]. From Ver. 1. to 21.


Having thus shewed 
negatively,
 that by the works of the Law, 
righteous∣ness
 and 
justification
 is not to be had, he comes now to prove the 
affirmative part
 of his position, 
viz.
 that 
God hath manifested another way of justi∣fication in his word,
 viz. 
by Faith in Jesus Christ
. For he tells them, that now, since the coming of Christ, the 
righteousness of God
 (that is, which avails be∣fore God, and which he freely allows to man for his justi∣fication) is manifested to be the 
righteousness of Christ,
 imputed to all such, as by a lively Faith receive it, and not to be 
that
 which men pretend to, by the performance of the works of the Law, either 
natu∣ral
 or 
written.
 And he tells them, that both the 
Law
 and the 
Prophets
 bear witness unto this righteousness. As for example, In the 
Law,
 (or one of the books of 
Moses,
 viz. 
Genesis, ch. 22.18.
), God promised 
Abra∣ham,
 that 
in his seed (viz.
 in the 
Messias
 that was to come of him) 
all nations of the earth shall be blessed.
 And this Doctrine was taught by the Prophets
 also, as we may see, 
Isa. 53. Dan. 9.24.
 This is the 
righeousness
 which God hath appointed for mans justification, even the righteousnes which is by 
Faith in Jesus Christ,
 and this 
blessedness
 belongs to all, and rests upon all that be∣lieve 
[see ch. 4. v. 9.],
 whether they be 
Jews
 or 
Gentiles,
 there being no diffe∣rence between them in this matter. And he assures them, there is no other way of justification but this. For all mankind are 
sinners,
 infected and polluted with sin, and so will fall
 short of obtaining the glory of God,
 and eternal life, if they seek it not in this way: All therefore that are 
justified,
 that is, abs
l
'd and acquitted from the guilt of their sins, and acc
u
ted 
righteous
 before God, cannot otherwise 
be so,
 than by the free grace and goodness of God, and the redemption and 
ransom
 of Jesus Christ; whom God from the beginning purposed to set forth unto men, as the only means for the expiation of their sins, and as the only way by which he would be propitiated
, 
viz.
 through Faith in his blood. And he intended hereby, that his 
righteousness,
 that is, his 
goodness, faithfulness,
 and 
truth,
 should be clearly demonstrated, by his forgiving
 to 
Believers
 their past transgressions, through his infinite mercy and forbearance, whereas he might justly and imme∣diately have destroyed them for their transgressions. And he intended the rather at this 
present season, (viz.
 be∣fore he brought destruction on the 
Jews
 for their incorri∣bleness), to make his righteousness and goodness appear to all the world, in that he had sent the 
promised Messias,
 for 
whose sake
 he was freely ready to pardon sin, and to justifie those that believe in him. And seeing these things are so, he asks what man had any cause of boasting in himself? Indeed if he were justified by his own works, or inherent righteousness, he might boast that the meritorious cause of his justification was in himself; but seeing that cannot be, all boasting is excluded, and that not by the 
Doctrine of Works,
 but by

 the 
Doctrine of Faith
. Therefore he concludes, that a man is 
justified by Faith,
 and not by the 
works of the Law,
 done either before conversion or after. He shuts up this discourse, by shewing, 
1.
 That 
this way of justification
 is common both to 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles.
 For as God is 
one
 and the 
same,
 so is his way of justifying sinners 
one
 and the 
same
 to all Nations, both to circumcised 
Jews
 and uncircumcised 
Gentiles,
 namely, by Faith in his Son. 
2.
 He shews, that the Doctrine of justification 
by Faith,
 and not 
by the works of the Law,
 doth not make void the 
Law,
 but rather establishes it. For the Gospel shews, how firm and irrevocable the Law is, seeing Christ was made under the Law, and was, by his fulfilling the Law, to purchase for man a right to the life it promis'd; and 
by be∣lieving in Christ
 (who obeyed the Law, and satisfied the breach of it), we acknowledg, that without exact obedience to the Law there can be no salvation; which exact obedience we being not able to perform, our Saviour hath perform'd it for us. And lastly, he tells them, this 
Doctrine of Faith
 establisheth the Law still 
as a rule,
 though not as a 
Covenant. From Ver. 21. to the end.


The Ap
stle proceeds to confirm his 
principal position, viz. that a man is 
 justified by Faith, without the works of the Law.
 And, in order hereunto, he instances in 
Abraham;
 touching whom he argues in this manner; 
What shall we say then? shall we say that Abraham our father found, or ob∣tained righteousness
 
by,
 or 
according to the flesh,
 that is, by being circumcised in his flesh, or by his own righteousness and works, which are seen outwardly, and by men esteemed praise-worthy? No, in no wise. For if he were justified 
by works,
 he hath whereof to glory, (the cause of his justifi∣cation being in himself); but he hath not any thing whereof to glory, at least 
before God;
 though possibly in the 
sight of men,
 (who can see no further than the outside) he might have whereof to glory
. Therefore the Scripture affirms that 
Abrahams
 Faith, or firm believing the Promise of God, [viz 
that he would be his shield, and great reward, and give him a Son in whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed,
 Gen. 
15.6.] was counted to him for Righte∣ousness;
 that is, by means of his 
Faith
 he was esteemed or reckoned
 righteous before God, and not by means of his 
works.
 For he that 
worketh,
 in order to his re∣ward with God, and hath or brings 
works
 before God, which are 
Gods-justice-proof;
 upon his perfect innocence, or blamelesness, God will, according to the Law of justice, reward and crown his innocence, paying it him as a 
due debt,
 and not giving it him by way of 
favour
 or 
grace.
 But he that works not, as hoping to be justified thereby, (though otherwise he makes conscience of good works, 
Jam. 2.26.
), nor pretends to have any such works as he dares confide in, or bring before God for his justification, but trusts in the gracious promise of God, who justifies, or absolves those who have been ungodly, but now repent and believe in his Son; such a mans Faith is counted to him for righteousness; that is, by means of his Faith he is accounted, or adjudged 
righ
eous
 
in Law,
 and absolv'd and acquitted in judgment. And agreeable to this is that description of 
blessedness
 given by 
David, Psal. 32.
 who being sorely oppressed with the guilt of his sins, and the fear of Gods wrath, pronounces the 
man blessed, to whom God im∣puteth righteousness,
 (viz. the 
righteousness of the Messiah,
 he having no works to bring before God to be justified
 by, and 
whose transgression is forgiven, and his sin covered
, (viz. from the sight of God so that the Lord looks upon him as no more lying under

 the guilt thereof) and 
to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity
. 
From Ver. 1. to 9.


He now moves a Question, Whether this blessedness of 
justification by Faith alone,
 belongs to the 
Circumcision,
 that is, the 
Jews
 only, or to the 
Uncir∣cumcision,
 that is, the 
Gentiles
 also? And seeing he had before asserted, that 
Abrahams Faith
 was reckoned to him for 
righteousness,
 he now inquires, 
when
 it was reckoned to him, and in what state 
Abraham
 was when he was pro∣nounced righteous? He answers, it was fourteen years, at least, before he was circumcised 
[Gen. 15.2.],
 therefore this way of being Righteous does not be∣long only to the 
Circumcision,
 or the 
Jews,
 but to the 
uncircumcised Gen∣tiles
 also, who believing in Christ become sharers with 
Abraham
 in that blessed∣ness. But then it may be objected, If 
Abraham
 was justified whilst he was un∣circumcised, to what purpose was he circumcised? He answers, that 
Abraham
 received Circumcision as a 
Sign
 and 
Seal
 of the Covenant of Grace, made to him and his Seed 
[Gen. 17.2.4.10.],
 and as an obsignation that the 
righ∣teousness of Faith
, was the true way for a sinner to become righteous; which righteousness 
Abraham
 had obtained whilst he was uncircumcised, to the end, that he might be the 
Father
 (in a spiritual sense) of 
Belie∣vers
 among the 
Gentiles
 (that were uncircumcised), and the 
Father
 of those that believe among the 
Jews
 (who were circumcised), namely, to as many of them, as (besides their Cir∣cumcision) imitated his Faith. Therefore the righteousness of Faith is common to Believers, both 
circumcis'd
 and 
uncircumcis'd,
 and reckoned, or imputed to all that follow the example of the Faith of 
Abraham,
 which he had when he was uncircumcised; and therein they are all 
his Seed,
 if not by generation, yet by imitation. And marvel not, saith he, that I interpose the condition, 
if they walk in the steps of Abrahams Faith;
 for the great Promise made to 
Abra∣ham
 and his Seed that they should possess that rich, and fertile, and pleasant part of the world
, to wit, 
Canaan,
 with the Coun∣tries adjacent, (under which Heaven it self was also ty∣pically promised and comprehended, 
Heb. 11.14, 16.
), was not made upon Condition of their performing perfect obedience to the Law, either of 
nature,
 or 
that after∣wards given at Sinai;
 but they were to obtain it, by the righteousness of Faith, and their trusting and depending on the gracious Promise of God. Now (says he) if they 
that are of the Law,
 that is, that seek to be justified by the works of the Law, be heirs of this promised inheritance, then 
the way of Faith
 prescribed by God, is to no purpose. And if it could be sup∣posed, that God had promised to conveigh the inheritance to them who performed

 perfect obedience to the Law, that Promise would not avail them, seeing no man is able to perform perfect legal righteousness. And 'tis evident, that the Law is so far from justifying, and so giving a 
title
 to the Inheritance, that it 
work∣eth wrath,
 that is, it reveals and pronounces condemnation, and death, upon the guilty for their transgressions: not that of it self, it was originally destin'd to subject men to punishment, but by 
accident
 and 
occasionally
 in respect of mans disobedience, it doth inevitably adjudg him thereunto. Whereas were there no Law written in 
nature,
 or 
given by God,
 there would be no transgression, and so no Condemnation. The Law therefore is so far from justifying, that it condemns. Seeing then, that neither Justification, nor the promised Inheritance, (which typified Heaven), is obtained by the 
works of the Law,
 it follows, that it must needs be obtain'd by 
Faith.
 And God hath appointed it to be ob∣tainable by Faith, that it might be of free and undeserved 
grace
 and favour; and to be of grace, that His promise might stand firm and sure to all the be∣lieving Seed of 
Abraham,
 (whereas it would be unsure and uncertain, if it depended on the condition of performing perfect obedience to the Law), and not to them 
only,
 who are his Seed according to the flesh, (to whom the Law was given), but to them also which imitate his Faith, (though they be 
Gentiles
); for he is the Father of all that believe, whether 
Jews
 or 
Gentiles. From Ver. 9. to 16.


Lastly, He goes on highly to commend the Faith of 
Abraham,
 setting it out as a pattern to be imitated and followed. He shews, that it was promised to 
Abraham
 by reason of his Faith, that he should be 
the Father of many Na∣tions,
 that is, of 
all Believers
 in the several Nations of the World, answer∣able
, or like unto God himself, (in whom he be∣lieved), who is the Father of the 
Gentile
 as well as of the 
Jewish
 Believers. This God, 
Abrahams
 Faith rested upon, who by his omnipotent power is able to 
quicken the dead,
 and raise them to life again, and will certain∣ly do it, (and so likewise is able to quicken the 
Gen∣tiles,
 who are dead in sins and trespasses, as well as he quickened 
Sarahs
 dead womb), and 
calleth those things which be not, as though they were,
 that is, causeth those things by his word and power, to appear and subsist, which had 
no being
 before, as he did in the creation of all things; and therefore 'tis not so much to be wondred at, if he makes the 
Gentiles
 (by conversion) what they were not before, 
viz.
 the 
children of Abraham.
 He further declares, that this Patriarch 
Abraham
 believed, and had a strong hope and trust in the promise and power of God against all natural grounds of hope, namely, that 
he should have a Son,
 and so be a 
stock
 from whence many Nations should spring, according to what was said, 
Gen. 15.5. So shall thy seed be,
 viz. 
as the stars of heaven for multitude.
 He further adds, that 
Abraham
 regarded not the great difficulties objected to his Faith, from his own and his wifes age. He admitted no doubts, or questions touching the promise of God (through unbelief
), but without all dispute, or arguing to the contrary, de∣pended fully on God for the performance of it, and so gave to God the glory of his faithfulness, and power, assuring himself, that he who is omnipotent, could and would per∣form what he had promised. Which stedfast Faith of his was imputed to him for righteousness, because he looked by Faith to the 
Messias
 promised, who was to come of his Seed. N
w this, that 
his Faith was imputed to him for righteousness,
 was not written, (says the Apostle) for 
Abrahams
 sake alone, but for 
ours
 also, that is, for our pro∣fit and comfort; to shew us, that 
Faith
 shall be imputed to all others also for 
Righteousness,
 who shall firmly trust in God through the merit and mediation of Christ Jesus for that blessing. This Jesus, he tells them, God sent into the

 world to be our Redeemer, and he was delivered to death for the expiation of our sins and offences, and God hath raised him again to life, to assure us, that our 
Surety
 hath paid our debts, and that we shall certainly be justified, if we truly believe in him. 
From Ver. 16, to the end.


 He proceeds to another argument, to confirm the Doctrine of 
justification by Faith in Christ alone,
 and that is, from the blessed fruits it produces, namely, 
peace,
 and 
reconciliation
 with God, and an introduction of us into his favour again, and a confirmation
 of us in it; also 
rejoicing in tribulation,
 as the means God will sanctifie to accustom us more to patience, and so to increase that grace in us, and in the exercise whereof he will give us more experi∣ence of his faithfulness, and care of us, and so strengthen a well-grounded hope in us, (which will not deceive us), that he will never forsake us. And that which further strengthens this hope, is, that his Holy Spirit (which cannot lye) doth usually in time of tribulation more abundantly testifie his love to the hearts of true Be∣lievers. 
From Ver. 1, to 6.


Ʋnder 
this head
 he also proves, that they 
that are justified by Faith
 shall certainly be saved from the wrath to come; and this he demonstrates, 
1.
 From the greatness of Christs love to 
such,
 before their justification, when they lay wel∣tring in sin and misery, unable to help themselves. He shews, that for such un∣godly persons as these, Christ in the fulness of time came to dye. And what a degree of love this was, he tells them, they may judg by considering how things usually are carried among men. Among whom, though for a very 
merciful
 and 
benign
 person, some one man would perhaps venture his life, yet for 
any man else,
 (though he were a righteous and just man), they would scarcely find any body that would be willing to do it. But God expresses a mercy and kindness infinitely above this; for He, when he had nothing in the Object to move him to it, when we were profane ungodly sinners, yet even then He was plea∣sed to send his Son to dye for us. And if the love of Christ was so strong and efficacious towards us, as to m
ve him to dye for us before we believed; surely his 
love
 will be much more towards us 
now,
 and his 
complacency
 greater in us, when we are actually justified by Faith in his blood; so that there is no cause to fear but that we shall be saved from wrath through him. 
2.
 He shews, that if, when we were enemies, Christ dyed to work our reconciliation and peace with God (through Faith in his blood); certainly, being now actually justified and reconciled to God, by our believing in him, we need not doubt but we shall be saved by him, seeing he now liveth and sitteth at the right hand of God, and there intercedes for us, and hath all things subjected unto him. 
3.
 See∣ing Christ by his death, sufferings, and intercession hath procured God to be 
our God
 and 
Father
 (which is more than meerly to save us from wrath), we need not doubt, but that he will do 
that
 also for us. 
From 6, to 12.


He further pursues this Argument, by shewing, that the 
righteousness
 of 
Christ
 is not less effectual to save those that by Faith are united to him, than 
Adams
 sin was to destroy those who naturally descend from him. This he proves by comparing Christ and 
Adam
 together, and shewing their 
similitude
 and 
dissi∣militude; 1.
 As by 
Adam sin
 entred into the world, and 
death
 by sin, upon all that are his Children by nature; so by Christ 
righteousness
 came into the world, and by righteousness 
life,
 unto all that are spiritually born of him. For, before the giving of the Law by 
Moses,
 sin was in the world, and was imputed, as may appear by this, that Death (which is the wages of sin) reigned over In∣fants, that had not sinned actually as 
Adam
 had done. Therefore, besides the 
Law of Nature
 which Infants could not transgress, there was 
another Law
 which God had given to the 
first man,
 the transgression whereof was imputed to

 all his posterity, yea even unto Infants. And this 
first man
 (he shews) was a 
type
 or 
figure
 of him that was to come, 
viz.
 of Christ Jesus. For as the first 
Adam
 was the 
fountain, head,
 or root of sin and misery, so Christ is the fountain and head of righteousness and life. And having thus shewed, wherein they agreed, he comes now to shew, wherein they differ: And that he mani∣fests by these positions. 
1.
 The sin of 
Adam
 is not so pernicious, as the righ∣teousness of Christ (which is freely given) is beneficial. For if the offence of the first 
Adam
 brought forth 
death
 to all that are naturally propagated of him, much more shall the free grace of God convey 
life
 to all those who are in Christ by Faith, and born of him after the Spirit. 
2.
 Though from 
Adams
 sinning, the guilt of his 
one offence
 redounds to the condemnation of many, yet the 
free gift
 of God, 
viz.
 the 
righteousness of Christ,
 redounds to the justification of many, not only from the guilt of that 
first sin,
 but of all other actual sins also. 
3.
 As by one offence death reigned over all mankind, much more shall they, who by Faith are united to Christ, and so participate of his abundant grace, and the free gift of his righteousness, be made partakers of everlasting life, wherein they shall reign with Him in glory. As therefore by one offence
 guilt came upon all naturally descended of 
Adam
 to their 
condemnation,
 so by the righteousness and perfect obe∣dience of 
one, viz.
 of Jesus Christ, (the meritorious cause of pardon), 
grace
 and 
absolution
 come upon all that believe in him, and are born again by his Spirit to their justification. 
From Ver. 12, to 20.


But here then it may be objected. If we are made righteous only by the righteousness of Christ, To what end was the Law given to the 
Israelites
 by 
Moses?
 He answers, It was not given that we should seek to be justified by it; But 
1.
 That sin 
might abound
, that is, be more clearly manifested to us, to be sin, and exceeding odious. 
2.
 That grace might 
super-abound,
 that is, might ap∣pear much more conspicuous and glorious in pardoning sin, and subduing of it. That as the power of sin appear'd in making us liable both to 
temporal
 and 
eternal
 death, so might the power of grace appear, in beginning in us a spiritual life here, and bringing us to an eternal life in glory hereafter, through the righteousness of Christ held forth in the Gospel. 
From Ver. 20, to the end.


He comes now to shew, that 
this Doctrine of justification by Faith in 
 Christ,
 tends exceedingly to promote holiness. And that he may the more clearly prove it, he first answers an Objection, which some (its like) in those times were ready to make against this Doctrine. They would be apt to say, 
If we be justifi
d freely by the grace of God, through Faith in Christ;
 Why may we not then freely indulge our selves in sin, that we may more 
inhaunce
 the grace of God, and make it appear more abundant and glorious in the par∣doning of us? This Objecti n the Apostle answers with detestation, shewing that this Doctrine allows no such wicked inferences, but tends altogether to promote holiness. And this be plainly proves by this argument. True Believers are 
dead
 
to sin,
 (that is, being partakers of the Spi∣rit of Christ they renounce it, and labour to mortifie it) therefore they cannot live in it. And this he shews is signified by their 
Baptism,
 whereby they are 
incorpo∣rated into Christ,
 and testifie their communion with him; 
1.
 In 
his death;
 so that they are to imitate his death by dying unto sin, and by mortifying their cor∣ruptions. 
2.
 In 
his burial,
 being buried with him in Baptism unto a similitude of his death and burial, by the immersion of the whole body into the water, (a custom much us'd in hot Countries); and there∣fore

 they are obliged to endeavour the 
burial of the old man,
 and to labour to abolish the body of sin. 
3.
 In 
his resurrection,
 therefore they are to imitate him by rising to newness of life. And as 
plants ingrafted,
 receive juice and moisture from the 
stock,
 so Believers being by Baptism implanted into Christ, do by virtue of their union with him, obtain power to kill sin, and to dye to it, in 
conformity to his death;
 and to rise from death in sin to newness of life, in 
conformity to his resurrection.
 And so the the old man
 is 
crucified
 with Christ, he having by his merits obtained not only remission of sins, but also the spirit of regeneration for Believers, that the
 body of sin may be destroyed, and they freed and delivered from its power, as those that are dead are no longer subject to the power of any man. And if they be conformed to Christ in his death, there is no doubt but they shall have a spiritual life here, and enjoy with him a celestial and ever∣lasting life hereafter. And as Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more, so likewise it shall be with his members. For he died once to make atonement for sin
, and to ab
lish it. But being now alive, he lives to the glory of God his Father
, by whose power he was raised to life again: And so 
they
 likewise ought to look upon themselves as those that are dead to sin, and therefore must not live in it, but unto God, though grace received from Jesus Christ. 
From Ver. 1. to 12.


Having shewed how this Doctrine tends to promote holiness, he comes now to exhort those who are 
justified by Faith,
 to endeavour to be holy, and to take care that 
sin
 get not any dominion over them, and that they obey it not by yeilding to the sinful lusts, inclinations, and motions of the flesh, nor employ the faculties and powers of their souls, or the members of their bodies in the service of sin and the Devil, but in the service of God, who hath so graciously rais'd them by the power of his grace from the death of sin, and endowed them with the life of righteousness through Faith in Christ Jesus. And he tells them, that if they did contend and strive duly against sin, it should not have dominion over them, because they are not under the Law as a 
Covenant of works,
 exacting perfect obedience, and ministring no strength to perform it; but under a Covenant of grace in Christ, which ministers strength to resist sin, and to overcome it. Yet none ought to infer from hence, that because they are not under the Law as a 
Covenant,
 therefore they are not under it as a 
rule;
 or that because they are under the Covenant of grace, therefore they may indulge themselves in sin, seeing the con∣trary plainly follows thereupon. For standing in the relation of servants to God, they must not serve sin; for they must of necessity be the servants to him whom they obey, and must receive a reward proportionable to the work they do. If they be the servants of sin
, it will bring upon them eternal death; if they be the servants of obedience, that is, obe∣dient servants to God, it will bring them the reward of righteousness, which is 
eternal life.
 Indeed before their conversion, he acknowledges, they did serve sin, but (through the grace of God) the time of that bondage was past, and now they had begun sincerely to obey that 
form of sound Doctrine,
 into which they were led by 
them,
 that first preached the Gospel unto them
. Therefore being made free from the 
slavery of sin,
 they were now become servants to 
righteousness.
 He tells them, he speaks plainly to them in an earthly similitude (because of the weakness of their understandings in spi∣ritual

 matters, 
Joh. 3.12.
), and accordingly declares unto them, that is was but equal, that as before they had obeyed sin, and yeilded up their members to be servants to uncleanness and iniquity, even to the acting of all unrighteousness; so now they should yeild their members to be servants to righteousness, that they may attain to a high degree of sanctification. As therefore when they served sin they were void of righteousness, (
that
 had no whit of their service), so now it is but equal, that seeing they are servants of righteousness, they should be free from sin, and not servants at all unto it. Lastly, he minds them of the sad na∣ture of the 
service
 of sin, it being for the time past 
unprofitable,
 for the time present 
shameful,
 and for the time to come 
deadly.
 But they that have gain'd liberty from the bondage of sin, and are become servants unto God, he shews, have great benefit thereby. For they will daily grow more and more in grace and holiness, and at last shall obtain eternal life. So that the 
wages, due reward,
 and 
end
 of sin, is death; but 
life eternal
 is the 
end
 of righteousness; not as its 
wages,
 but as a 
gift
 freely given by God, upon the account of the merit and intercession of Christ. 
From Ver. 12. to the end.


He comes now to answer another Objection which the Jews would be apt to 
 make against this Doctrine. They might say, How can eternal life belong to 
you Christians,
 seeing you do not observe the Law of 
Moses,
 and so sin contemptuously against God. Nay not only the 
Gentiles
 who are converted to Christianity, are by you permitted to neglect 
Circumcision,
 &c. 
[Act. 15.],
 but the converted 
Jews
 are taught by you also, that they need not observe the Law of 
Moses, [see Act. 21.21.]?
 To this the Apostle answers, that they who believe in Christ are now no longer under the 
Mosaical Paedagogy,
 or tied to observe the Ceremonial Rites; which he proves by this general position, 
that the Law hath power over a man as long as it
 
lives, and abides in force, and no longer;
 as he instances in the case of marriage. The 
Law of marriage
 binds a married wo∣man to her husband, as long as he liveth; but if he die, she is free from the obligation of that Law; 
that Law
 ceases as to her, and she is at liberty to marry to another. So for those of the 
Jews
 that believe in Christ, the 
Law
 (through the offering up of Christs Body on the Cross
) is 
dead
 to them, and they are freed from the obligation of it, and are now rightfully joined and espoused to another, 
viz.
 to Christ, (whose resurrection from the dead shews he is alive); that so living in conjugal affection and obe∣dience to him, they may be made fruitful by his Spirit, and may bring forth such holy actions as are agreeable to the will of God, and tend to his glory. This he shews was not done whilst they liv'd under the 
paedagogy of the Law,
 and those external carnal ordinances, (call'd here the flesh
); for though all sinful practices were forbidden by the Law, yet sinful affections were not thereby mortified, or subdued, but rather more irritated and stirred up; insomuch that they were obeyed, and yeilded to, and executed by their members, and so they brought forth that sad fruit, to wit, obligation to eternal punishment. But now they were freed from the Law, and those carnal external observances, (that obligation
 being cancell'd by which they were due), that for time to come they might serve God in newness of life, and with Evangelical obedience; begun and carried on, by the Spirit of Christ, and not accord∣ing to the directions of the Law; written for their use of old, by Gods appointment, and call'd here the 
oldness of the letter
. 
From Ver. 1. to 7.




Yet lest what he had said might be ill understood, he comes now to Apologize for the holiness of the Law, and to answer an Objection which he foresaw some might be apt to make against this discourse. Some might say, If vicious motions be stirred up by the Law, then the Law may seem to be the cause of sin. He answers, That the Law manifests and discovers sin, and therefore cannot work it. For as for his own particular, he should not so exactly have known the 
very desires
 of the heart to be 
sin,
 had not he by a more attentive consideration of the Tenth Commandment found that they were so. But when he knew this 
ori∣ginal corruption,
 or the inward depravation of his nature, taking occasion by the Law, that is, being stirred up, and more irritated by the prohibition of it, brought forth all the vicious motions of Concupiscence
 in him. Indeed whilst he knew not the Law, (that is, the exact holiness and purity it required), this kind of sin lay as it were dead in him, that is, was not known to him to be sin, neither did it terrifie his Conscience: But after the Law came to be better known by him, he found, by the prohibition of the Law, his appetite to sin was more increased and enraged. Formerly, when he liv'd a Pha∣risee, and had the Law, but did not sufficiently consider it, nor the exactness and perfection it required, he seem'd to himself to be alive
, that is, to be righteous, and so not liable or obnoxious to death: but when the 
grace
 of God had opened his eyes, and shewed him the true sense and spiritual meaning, and extent of the Law, and how that even 
inward desires
 contrary to the Law are sins, then he began to see his manifold sins and guiltiness, and that he was in the state of death. Then he understood these 
two things,
 which he knew not before: 
1.
 The proper end and use of the Law, which was ordain'd to give life to them that should perfectly keep it. 
2.
 The accidental effect of it, 
viz.
 that through the corruption of man, it became a cause of death to him, by irritating his inward corruption. He further shews, that 
sin,
 or the depraved nature in him, excited him to disobey the Law by suggesting to him, it was more pleasant to indulge himself in sin, and so seducing him, made him liable to the punishment of it, which is death. However the Law, he acknowledges, is in its self 
holy, just,
 and 
good.
 But some might then object, How can 
that
 which is in it self 
good,
 be a cause of death to any man? He an∣swers, 'Tis so only 
accidentally,
 not of it self, but through the corruption of mans nature, which therein manifests it self to be more superlatively evil and vile, by being irritated by so holy a Law, and so being the cause of actual sins, and of death. 
From Ver. 7. to 14.


In the next place, he shews, how he himself was grieved with the 
remainders
 of corruption, which he found in himself, even after he was delivered from the 
dominion
 thereof, and how much he strove against them, and how he got the victory over them, only by Christ. He complains, he consisted of a 
regenerate
 and an 
unregenerate
 part; the one was irritated by the Law of God, the other sweetly complied with it; from which two principles, arose a spiritual combate in him, 
(see Gal. 5.17),
 which he comes now to describe. And first he acknowledges, that the Law was 
spiritual,
 but when he look'd upon himself, and compar'd the

 imperfection of his obedience with the spiritualness of the Law, he was compell'd to acknowledg, that he was still in part 
carnal
, (namely, in respect of the remainders of corruption that were in him), and 
sold under sin,
 not as if he were willingly obedient to it, but as one that against his desire and will, was of∣ten instigated by it, and sometimes over-power'd by the tyranny of it, and car∣ried away whither he would not, and from which he was not yet able wholly to free himself. For that (says he) which sometimes I do, being over-power'd by the force of corruption, and violence of temptation; I do not allow, or approve in my renewed judgment, but utterly condemn, before those corrupt passions are stir∣red in me; and the 
good
 which I will and approve, that I do not, in such per∣fection as I gladly would. For I would perform perfect obedience to the Law, but I find that in many things I fall short and offend, yea sometimes am hurried into the evil, which I am utterly averse from, when I am not thus assaulted. So that therein I shew and manifest, that I approve and own the 
Law
 to be good, and a perfect rule of righteousness. 
From Ver. 14. to 17.


He further shews he stood not in fear of being rejected of God, for those remain∣ders of corruption in him, so long as he heartily strove against them, and endeavoured to subdue them. For God judgeth of his Children, that are thus exercis'd be∣tween 
flesh
 and 
spirit,
 according to the better and sounder part in them, unto which they do willingly cleave and adhere, and not according to the other (the flesh) which they do resist and combate against
. 
Ver. 17.


He acknowledges, that in his nature, so far as it is yet corrupt and unrenewed, there dwells no spiritual good, by which he can please God; and consequently not so much as power to will any good. Indeed he found his renewed will somewhat inclining to good, but the corruption yet remaining in him, often hindred the exe∣cution of those good motions and inclinations, insomuch that he could not but ac∣cuse himself of manifold omissions of good, and commissions of evil, which he was heartily sorry and displeased with himself for: so that it was not 
he as renew∣ed,
 but as over-power'd by this in-dwelling corruption, that did this evil. And further he declares, that when he was ready to do good, he found the pravity of nature present with him, as a Law over-swaying, and forcing, and inclining him to evil; yet, according to his renew'd nature, (called the 
inward man
 be∣cause hidden, and concealed from the eyes of man), he delighted in the Law of God. 
From Ver. 17. to 22.


But he tells them, he had sad experience of another Law, 
viz.
 the power of sin, yet exerting it self in him, and warring and fighting against the Law of God, by which his 
inward
 and 
renewed man
 was guided, (and with the purity and spirituality whereof it was delighted), and endeavouring to captivate him unto evil. 
Ver. 23.


Ʋnder a feeling of this misery, he cries out, 
O that I were delivered from these carnal lusts, that are a death to me! O that I were out of this ani∣mal and terrestrial life! O that I were delivered from this body subject to death!
 for till then I cannot expect to be delivered from the remainders of sin, and the 
old man,
 (which he here calls the body of death, 
see Rom. 6.6.
), Yet for all this he does not faint and despond, but blesses God who 
in
 and 
through
 his Son, delivers him from the curse of the Law, and the dominion of sin, and will perfect his deliverance from all the power of it in his due time. At last he concludes, that in this his present regenerate condition; though with his mind, 
that is,
 with that part that is renewed in him, he serves the Law of God, yet by reason of the corruption that remains in him, (against which he did strive),

 he is sometimes tempted and seduced to the commitment of sin. 
From Ver. 23 to the end.


 He comes now to shew, that this Doctrine of 
justification by Faith in Christ
 affords Believers strong ground of 
comfort
 against all fear of evil or punishment, to be endured after this life; which a sense of the imperfection of their sanctification, and of sin dwelling in them, might strike them with. And under this Head, (from 
v. 1.
 to 
9.
), he shews, 
1.
 That this 
consolation, viz.
 security to be freed from Condem∣nation, is proper and peculiar to justified persons, only; who being implanted into Christ by Faith, endeavour to be more and more holy, and fulfill not the lusts of the flesh, but follow the guidance of the Spirit of God. For the power of the quick∣ning Spirit of Christ, (which rules in the hearts of 
Believers
 as a Law, dicta∣ting to them what they ought to do), frees 
them
 and 
himself
 in particular, from the reigning power of sin, the wages whereof is death: From neither of which the Law of 
Moses
 was able to rescue any man. For the Law cannot justi∣fie any man now, since mans transgression of it, but it only condemns and works wrath; it shews sin, it cannot abolish it. What therefore the 
Law
 cannot do by reason of mans first transgression thereof, and his present pravity of nature, God was pleas'd to do, by sending his Son (who took on him our true human nature, yet not a sinful nature, though he had the likeness of it, in being subject to our infirmities), to be made a Sacrifice for us on the Cross, and there he condemn∣ed sin in the flesh of his Son, and did exact of him the pun
shment due to it, that we believing 
in him
 might be justified, and reckoned as those, that have performed perfect obedience to the Law; and that, by the inchoation of sincere E∣vangelical obedience to the Law in us, we might be enabled to walk after the Spirit, and not after the flesh. For those that are in their corrupt and natural estate do savour only fleshly things, which lead and bring a man to death, but they that are regenerate do savour spiritual things, which lead to everlasting life and peace. For the wisdom of the flesh, or the carnal mind, is enmity against God, there being a natural repugnancy in it to submit it self to his will. There∣fore they that are in their carnal and corrupt estate, and follow the lust and con∣cupiscence of the flesh, cannot please God till they be converted and changed. 
From Ver. 1. to 9.


2ly.
 He addresses himself to the 
Believing Romans,
 applying this consolation 
of immunity from condemnation
 unto them, who being united to Christ by Faith, have the Spirit of Christ, by his gracious operations dwel∣ling
 in them. And if Christ be in them by his Spirit, though their body be mortal and subject to death, (by reason of sin, which still dwells in them), yet their 
spirits
 or 
souls
 are made partakers of 
eternal life initial,
 by the righteousness of Christ imputed to them, and a work of sanctification begun in them, which Christ, who hath begun it will carry on. And if the 
Spirit
 of Christ dwell in them, he will never leave his habitation, but will raise their bo∣dies to life again at the last day, as his own body was raised from the dead by the power of God. 
From Ver. 9. to 12.


3ly.
 He shews from 
ver. 12.
 to 
17.
 what use they are to make of this Doctrine, (which affords so great consolation), namely, to engage themselves with all serious∣ness to subdue the flesh, and to be more and more holy. For if they live after the flesh they shall 
dye,
 not only a 
temporal
 but an 
eternal
 death; but if they through the grace and assistance of the Spirit, do subdue and mortifie the sinful lusts of the flesh, they shall 
live,
 not only a spiritual life here, but an eternal life in glory here∣after. And he further tells them, that all that follow the guidance of the Spi∣rit of God do evidence themselves to be the Children of God. For after that they have received Christ by Faith, a 
servile fear
 of condemnation is no more wrought

 in them (as was before wrought by the Spirit
 in the preaching of the Law, in order to bring them home to Christ), but the Spirit of adoption
, which testifies to them, that they are the Children of God, and so encou∣rages them with an humble confidence to call on God as their 
reconciled Father
. So that they shall not need to fear condemnation any more
, being freed from it by Christ. And this Spirit of Adoption witnesseth in∣wardly unto their Spirits and Consciences that they are the Children of God. 
From Ver. 12. to 17.


He comes now to shew, how this Doctrine of 
justification
 affords grounds of comfort to justified persons against the afflictions they may meet with in this life 
From Ver. 17. to 31.


And, 
1.
 He shews, that they are Heirs, Heirs of God, and joint-Heirs with Christ
, their Elder Brother; and if they be willing to suffer with him, (when called to it), and to have communion with him in afflictions
, they shall also be glorified with him. And he tells them, that the sufferings of this life
, let them be what they will, are no way to be compar'd to the glory that shall be revealed hereafter, and conferred on those that suffer for Christ. He shews them, that the whole frame of the Ʋniverse, and all the visible Creatures in it, being now (contrary to the first institution of God) made subject to vanity, and in a great part to destruction, long
 as it were, for the manifestation of the glory of the Sons of God at the day of judgment, that they may be redeemed and delivered from their corruption, and the abuse of men. For the Creature against its natural propension and inclination, (which inclines it to 
self-preservation
), was made subject to vanity and a frail condition, and that by reason of the sin of man, for which God subjected it to this curse and male∣diction. And if the Creature
 being made thus subject to vanity and misery, (not for its own, but our fault), doth patiently bear it, in expectation of deliverance from this bondage of corruption, and to be restored into that excellent and primitive state of its creation
, (name∣ly, at that time when the Children of God shall attain unto their glorious Estate), how much more should we patiently bear afflictions, in expectation of a glorious de∣liverance? For the 
whole Creation
 (after the manner of a travelling woman) doth groan and sigh with us, to be delivered of this burden of vanity and misery, unto which it is subjected. And we also (says the Apostle), who have received the 
first fruits
 of the Spirit, (
viz.
 peace and joy, which are the pledges and beginnings of Eternal life), do breathe after the compleating and per∣fecting of our 
Adoption,
 in the glorious resurrection of our bodies, and redemp∣tion of them from all evil and misery. And the 
hope
 of this should comfort us under all afflictions. For we have not at present actual possession of the glory we expect, but have it as yet only in 
hope;
 but 
hope
, (that is, the thing hoped for), when it comes once to be seen with our eyes, and possessed, is no longer hoped for,

 but enjoyed. So that it is the property of 
hope,
 to wait for, and expect a fu∣ture good, and of 
Christian hope
 to expect the glorious manifestation of the com∣pleat Adoption, and glory of the Sons of God, and to wait patiently for it. 
From Ver. 17, to 26.


2.
 He shews, that justified persons are not left to themselves in those afflictions that come upon them, but the Spirit of God supports them in their distresses and anxieties of mind, and teaches them how to pray, (which is the surest refuge in trouble), helping their infirmities, and directing them to ask things agreeable to the will of God, and in a due manner. He also intercedes for them, that is, causeth and exciteth them to intercede, and cry, and pray for themselves
, and that with lively feelings, groan∣ings, and pangs of affection, such as cannot be expressed or uttered by words. And God who is omniscient, knows what is the mind and intention of those groans, which his Spirit excites in his own Children. For the Spirit teaches and guides the Saints to pray in such a manner as is best pleasing and acceptable to God. Therefore, being sure to be heard, they may comfort themselves in their afflictions. 
From Ver. 26, to 28.


3.
 He further declares how 
He
 and 
other Believers
 did know by daily expe∣rience, that all things (even afflictions) do work toge∣ther
 for good to the Saints, they being effectually called to believe in Christ, according to the eternal counsel and purpose of God; according to which he hath purposed in himself, to save mankind only by grace through Christ. For whom he did 
fore∣know,
 chose and mark, for his own, from all eternity; he did predestinate, fore-appoint, and design to make conformable to his Son, not only in holiness and happi∣ness, but in the Cross and sufferings, as the means conducing thereunto; intend∣ing, that his own Son should have many adopted Brethren, of whom he should be the 
Head
 and Captain, (as the first-born was wont to be in all families), in couragious bearing of afflictions, and passing thorow them to eternal glory. And those whom he did thus fore-ordain
 to eternal happiness, he effectually calls in time to believe in his Son; and whom be thus calls he justifies; and whom he ju∣stifies them he decrees to glorifie; 
first,
 by sanctifying of them, (which is glory begun), and 
hereafter
 by giving them a full possession of glory in Heaven. Therefore justified persons have a solid ground of Consolation, though they be afflict∣ed in this life. 
From Ver. 28, to 31.


4.
 He concludes this Argument of his, for 
justification by Faith,
 with a holy insultation, and triumphing in Christ against all accusations and tribulations which the 
Devil
 or the 
World
 might be able to bring upon justified persons; arguing in this manner: If God declare himself to be so much for us, as that he hath 
chosen, called, justified, sanctified,
 and intends to 
glorifie
 us hereafter, who shall be able to hurt us? If God spared not his only begotten Son, but gave him over to death for all us who believe in him, we have no cause to fear but he will give us whatsoever else is good for us, and may tend to promote our Sal∣vation. And to pursue this Argument further, he asks, Who can implead any of Gods Elect, as Satan and their own Consciences (sometimes) are apt to do? If they do, he replies, It is God that justifies
, ac∣quits and absolves them from condemnation for the sake of Christ. And he demands, Who can condemn those who are freed by Christ, who 
dyed, rose again
, 
now sits at Gods right hand,
 and 
intercedes
 for them? He asks, What can separate them from that love wherewith Christ hath loved them, and manifested toward them, in doing all this for them? Shall tribulation, or persecution, or

 any afflictions, which are only trials of Faith? No, none of them can hinder them from enjoying the full effect and sweet sense of Christs love, though such trials have been the lot of Gods people, both under the Old and New Testament. So that they may apply the words of 
David
 in 
Psal. 44, 22.
 unto themselves, saying, 
For thy sake, O Lord, we are persecuted continually, and are in daily expectation of death, and are used as if we were sheep destinated to the slaughter;
 nevertheless in all these conflicts we do more then overcome, through Christ helping of us; our graces being strengthned thereby, and our reward in∣creased. He concludes that he is perswaded, that neither the pleasures of life, nor the terrors of death, nor evil Angels, nor any of the powers and principalities of this world, nor evils present, nor any that can happen to us hereafter, nor heighth of prosperity, nor depth of adversity, nor any thing else, can separate us from the love of God, wherewith he loves us; being by Faith united to Christ. For his love is founded on an immutable foundation, 
viz.
 the infinite merit of his Son. 
From Ver. 31. to the end.


He further confirms the assertion, 
that justification is by Faith in Christ, 
 and not by the works of the Law,
 from the experience of the 
Israelites,
 who seeking justification by works, and not by Faith in Christ, found it not, and were therefore cast off; and from the experience of the 
believing Gentiles,
 who not trusting in their own works, fled by Faith to Christ for justification, and so obtain'd it. And he answers 
four Objections,
 which he foresaw would be made against what he should say touching the rejection of the 
Jews.


1.
 Some would perhaps say, that what he spake upon this Argument, savour'd of 
ill will
 and 
disaffection
 to his own Nation. For answer to that, he solemn∣ly protests in the presence of Christ, his Conscience also bearing him witness (which was guided by the holy Ghost), that he was greatly afflicted, and grieved at the very heart, for the rejection of the 
Jews,
 who would not be brought to look af∣ter Christ, but depended on the 
Law,
 and confided in their own 
righteousness.
 For he had such an affection for them, that if it were 
possible,
 (and might consist with the will of God), that retaining his 
communion
 with Christ in 
ho∣liness
 and 
love,
 he might be separated from him in 
bliss
 and 
happiness,
 he could even be willing to suffer it
, to redeem his 
Kinsmen
 and 
Nation
 from that 
judicial
 rejection. And besides his natural affection to them, he tells them, he had other reasons to inflame him to this Charity, and to oblige him to have a high respect and esteem for them, they being the people whom God had extraordinarily dignified with many great and glorious priviledges. Particularly, they were 
Israelites
 descended from 
Jacob,
 who wrestled with God for the blessing, and had thereupon the 
honourable name
 of 
Israel
 given him, 
Gen. 32.28. 2ly.
 God assum'd and adopted them for his 
peculiar people,
 before all other Nations of the world, 
[Exod. 4.22. Deut. 14.1. Jer. 31.9.] 3ly.
 They had the high priviledg to have the 
presence of God
 in a more eminent and glorious manner manifesting it self among them, from between the 
Cherubins
 on the Ark, 
[2 Chron. 6.41 Psal. 63.2. Psal. 78.61. 1 Sam. 4.21, 22.]. 4ly,
 With them the 
Covenants
 were made, 
viz. that Covenant
 first made with 
Abraham,
 and of∣ten repeated; and the 
Sacraments
 of the Covenant were also given to them, 
viz. Circumcision
 and 
sprinkling of blood, [G n. 17.10. Exod. 24.8.]. 5ly.
 To them God give his Laws, 
moral, judicial,
 and 
ceremo∣nial,
 prescribing his own worship and service. 
6
y,
 To them the 
promises of the Messias
 were made. 
7ly,
 They are descended of those honourable Patriarchs, 
Abraham, Isaac,
 and 
Jacob.
 Lastly, They are they, of whose stock Christ took

 his humane Nature, who in the unity of his person, is 
true man,
 and 
true God,
 blessed for evermore
. 
From Ver. 1, to 6.


2.
 Objection: If the 
Jews
 be rejected, then some will be apt to say, That the 
Word
 of God, and the 
Promises
 of Grace made to the 
Israelites
 is void, where∣in God promis'd to 
Abraham, I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed.
 He answers, that all that are born of 
Israel
 the 
Patriarch,
 according to the flesh, are not 
true Israelites,
 that is, such to whom the 
Promise
 appertains. Neither are all that are begotten of 
Abraham
 according to the 
flesh,
 the 
true Children,
 and 
Heirs of the Promise,
 but only his 
spiritual Seed,
 namely, 
true Believers,
 begotten after the Image of his 
Faith.
 For 
Abraham
 had two Sons, 
Ishmael,
 and 
Isaac: Ishmael
 was a type of those that are born, only according to the flesh, and were to be cast out; and 
Isaac,
 of those that are born, not meerly by the power of Nature, but by vertue of the 
Promise
 and 
free grace
 of God, and these are to be reckoned for the 
true Seed
, that shall inherit, 
[see Gal. 4.24, &c.].
 So that the 
carnal Seed
 of 
Abraham,
 born according to the course of Nature, are the Children of God, to whom the Promise was made; but the Children
 
represent∣ed by Isaac
, born of the supernatural power of the Spirit of God, (who by Faith lay hold on the Promise of Salvation made in Christ), they are to be accounted for that 
Seed
 mentioned in the Covenant, 
I will be thy God and the God of thy Seed.
 This also, he shews, was typified in the 
twins Rebecca
 had by 
Isaac,
 viz. 
Esau
 and 
Jacob,
 who though they had not only 
one Father,
 but 
one Mother,
 (which 
Ishmael
 and 
Isaac
 had not), and were born 
at one time,
 yet their condition was very different, neither had they equal favours and priviledges vouchsaf'd to them by God. If therefore any shall won∣der that the 
Gentiles
 should become Heirs to the Promise, 
by Faith
 in Christ, and that the 
carnal Jews
 should be cast off, for their 
infidelity,
 and adhering to their own righ∣teousness, let them consider this instance of 
Esau
 and 
Jacob,
 of whom when 
Rebecca
 was with Child, and found the Babes strugling in her womb, (in a manner not usual to other women, 
Gen. 25.22, 23.
), she enquired of the Lord by prayer, or by some Prophet, what the meaning of it should be, and received this answer, that 
two Nations
 (that is, the 
heads
 of two Nations, 
viz. Edomites
 and 
Israelites) were in her womb,
 and that God had determined before either of them had done 
good
 or 
evil,
 to prefer the 
younger
 before the 
elder,
 and declared, that 
the elder should serve the younger
, [which was fulfilled, when the 
Israelites
 subdued the 
Edomites, 2 Sam. 8.14. 1 King. 22.47. Obad.
 v. 
17, 18.
]. And in the Prophet 
Malachi, ch. 1. v. 2, 3.
 'tis expressed in higher terms,
 
viz. Jacob have I loved, Esau have I hated:
 where, by 
Esau
 his posterity, the 
Edomites
 are to be understood, and by that word 
hated,
 seems to be meant, that God 
less loved
 them, than the 
Israelites;
 or was not 
so kind
 to 
them,
 as to 
these;
 in that, whereas he gave to 
Jacob
 or the 
Israelites,
 a Land flow∣ing with milk and honey; the portion of 
Esau,
 or the 
Edomites,
 was the stony and barren Mountains of 
Seir.
 For the word 
hate
 in Scripture many times signifies no more than 
less to love:
 As 
Gen. 29.31. Luk. 14.26. Joh. 12.25.
 And this was spoken, that by this type

 the eternal purpose
 of God, founded in his own free choice, might be manifested and declared, 
fixed
 and 
firm,
 to save sinners, not for the 
works
 that they should do, but by 
Faith
 in his Son, which is wrought in them by the free and effectual vocation
 of his Spirit, illumi∣nating their minds, and changing their hearts; that so they may acknowledg their 
justification
 and 
salvation
 to his 
free grace
 in Christ only, and not to their own 
me∣rits
 and 
works,
 which the carnal 
Israelites
 so much de∣pended on. 
From Ver. 6, to 14.


3.
 Objection: But if God deal thus unequally with men, and do not dispense his favour according to mens 
merits
 and 
works,
 Does he not seem to be un∣just?


Answ. Far be it from us to think, that God can be in the least unrighteous. For he is debter to no man
, and therefore he is free to dispense his favours where he pleases, and to deny them where he pleases, without giving account thereof to any one. And this is agreeable to what he himself says to 
Moses,
 Exod. 
33.19. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,
 &c. Therefore no man is injur'd that is not effectually call'd by his grace, seeing it is of his 
free grace
 and mercy that any one is call'd. 'Tis not therefore to be ascrib'd to mans 
free will
 or 
endeavour
 that any obtain Salvation, but to the 
free grace
 and mercy of God. And as God is free in shewing mercy to whom he pleaseth, so he may justly 
cast off
 and reject obstinate contemners of Christ and his Gospel, for their own contumacy; as he proves by the instance of 
Pharaoh,
 who having often hard∣ned his own heart against the judgments of God, 
[Exod. 8.15, 19. & 9.34.],
 at last God was provoked 
judicially
 to leave him to him∣self, and to give him up to his own obstinacy and obdu∣ration, 
[Exod. 9.12.]
 Insomuch that God tells him, 
[Exod. 9.16.], for this have I raised thee up
, [or made thee to continue]; and have preserv'd thee a∣midst

 all these plagues, that (thou abusing my patience by thy desperate obsti∣nacy), I may shew forth my divine power, and make it appear more illustrious before all the world, in the tremendous and exemplary punishment I shall inflict upon thee. Ʋpon the whole, the Apostle concludes, that as God is free to shew mercy where he pleases, and is not bound to render any reason thereof, beyond his own will, and divine pleasure; so when he delivers up any obdurate sinner to the obduration
 and hardness of his own heart, this he may justly do, without any impeachment of his righteousness. 
From Ver. 14, to 19.


4.
 Objection. If the case be thus, that God doth sometimes (and that just∣ly) leave obdurate sinners to harden themselves, why is he so offended at it, why does he so complain of it by his Prophets, why does he severely punish it? For who can resist his will?


Answ. 'Tis not fit
 that Man, who is a guilty Creature, and obnoxious to God, should presume to ob∣ject any thing against Gods proceedings, which are always just and holy. 'Tis not fit the 
Creature
 should dispute with his 
Creator;
 or question him, why he hath dealt thus or thus with him. Hath not the 
Potter
 power and liberty, out of the same lump of Clay to make one Vessel f
r an honourable use, and another for a vile and more abject, [
see Isa. 29.16,
 & 
45.9.
]. Are not all mankind in the hand of God, as Clay in the hand of the Potter, 
Jer. 18.6?
 What if God, after he hath expressed patience, and b
rn with the 
vessels of wrath
, a great while, who by their sins fit themselves for destructi
n, do at last give them up to it, and to the judgment they have deserved? is there any thing that can reasonably be ob∣jected against this? And thus the case stands with the 
incredulous Jews,
 whom God rejected not, till they had shewed themselves obstinate refusers and contemners of Christ and his Gospel. And what if God willing to ren∣der the riches of his 
free grace
 more illustrious towards the 
vessels of mercy,
 do effectually call them to believe in his Son, and by justifying and sanctifying of them, prepare them for glory. And thus the case stands with those that are brought to believe in Christ, not only a∣mong the 
Jews,
 but among the 
Gentiles
 also. And what is there in this that any can blame, there being so much righteousness, wisdom, and goodness manifested there∣in? 
From Ver. 19, to 25.


And lest the 
Jews
 should yet stumble at 
this Doctrine,
 he comes now to prove that the 
calling of the Gentiles
 was foretold by the Prophet 
Hosea, ch. 2. v. 22.


 where God declares, that 
he will call them his people which were not his people, and will have mercy on them which have not obtained mercy.
 And 
Hosea 1.10.
 he says, 
it shall come to pass instead of that which was said unto them, ye are not my people, it shall be said to them, ye are the sons of the living God;
 which notes his receiving the 
Gentiles
 into the Church, which was an act of Gods free and undeserved mercy; at which the 
Jew∣ish Believers
 were much astonished, as we may see, 
Act. 10.45.
 He shews also, the 
rejection of the Jews
 to be f
retold by the Prophet 
Isaiah, ch. 10.22.
 whose words he accommodates to this matter, in which place the Prophet proclaims on this wise, 
Though the number of the people of Israel,
 according to the flesh, 
shall be very great, that they may be compared with the sand on the sea∣shore
, 
yet a very few only of them shall be sa∣ved.
 This the Prophet speaks of th
se 
Jews
 that escaped the hands of 
Sennacherib
 (which were only those few that fled to 
Jerusalem
); and the Apostle considers the deliverance of those few 
as a type
 of those that shall be∣lieve in Christ to their salvation. The Prophet further adds, that God would make a quick dispatch, and deal in justice with 
that land,
 and 
that people
 of the 
Jews;
 and though there were never so many of them, only a few should be left, the far greater part should be involv'd in that destruction. And this the Apostle cons
ders as a 
type
 of the rejection of the greater part of the 
Jews,
 for their incredulity and contemptuous refusal of Christ. And to this also he accommodates what the same Prophet had be∣fore said, 
ch. 1. v. 9.
 concerning those shut up in 
Jerusalem,
 when 
Rhezin
 King of 
Syria,
 and 
Pekah
 King of 
Israel
 besieged it, but could not prevail against it, 
2 King. 16.5.
 namely, that if the Lord of Hosts had not by that means preserved a 
small remnant, viz.
 a small seed to them, out of which that people might after∣wards spring up again, they had been as utterly destroyed as 
Sodom
 and 
Gomorrah
 were. And in the like manner God would now in these times only bring some few
 of the 
Jews
 to believe in Christ, and would reject the greater part of them for their obstinate refusing of him. 
From Ver. 25, to 30.


In sine: he shews, that the 
experience of the believing Gentiles
 might con∣firm this Doctrine of 
justification by Faith.
 For they not following after the righteousness of 
works,
 nor seeking to be righteous 
that way,
 had attained to true righteousness, 
viz.
 that which is 
by Faith in Christ;
 and the unbelieving 
Jews,
 seeking to be justified by the Law, and following after 
that way
 
of righteousness,
 came short of that righteousness which they sought after and no wonder seeing they sought it, 
not by Faith in Christ,
 but despised him to their own destructi
n, stumbling at his humility and mean condition in this world. And thus it was predicted in those two places, 
Isa. 8.14. & 28.16.
 
Behold I lay in Sion
 (that is, in the Church of God among the 
Jews) a foundation stone,
 viz. 
the true Messias Jesus Christ,
 who to the unbelieving 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles, is a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence,
 but whosoever be∣lieveth in him shall not be frustrated of his hope, or ashamed
, whether he be 
Jew
 or 
Gentile. From Ver. 30. to the end.




 He further prosecutes this Argument of the 
Jews temporary rejection;
 shew∣ing this to be the cause thereof, that they foolishly and stubbornly rejected the righteousness which God presents in the Gospel. And being first to convince them of their folly therein, lest they should think he spake out of disaffection to his own Nation, he professes he was so far from it, that he heartily prayed to God for their conversion and salvation. For he could not but bear them record, that very many of them had a zeal, 
in their way,
 to please God, but for want of true knowledg they were greatly mistaken. For being unsatisfied of Gods way of ju∣stifying sinners, by the 
righteousness of Christ
 apprehended by Faith, and de∣siring and endeavouring to establish 
a way of righteousness
 by 
their own works
 and 
obedience to the Law,
 they have refused to submit to Gods way of justifica∣tion, which is 
by Faith in Christ.
 He tells them, they should have considered, that Christ is 
the end of the Law,
 that is, that all the 
Ceremonies
 of the Law prefigured him, and had reference unto him as their scope and end; and that the 
moral Law
 convincing men of their sins, and condemning them for them, did plainly shew, that the expiation of sin could no where he found but in the sacrifice of Christ, and therefore righteousness must be sought by Faith in him, and not by the Law. For 
Moses
 when he commended the Law to the people, 
Deut. 30.11,
 &c. spake in this wise; 
This is the commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that thou shouldst say, who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it down unto us, that we may hear it and do it. Neither is it be∣yond the sea, that thou should say, who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may know it and obey it: but the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth,
 (that is, thou canst not plead ignorance, for this word is fully declar'd to thee, and thou hast it daily in thy mouth) 
and in thy heart,
 (thou understandest sufficiently what the Lord requires of thee), that thou mayest do it. It remains therefore, that thou take care fully and ex∣actly to perform it. For the man that doth all things prescribed in the Law 
ex∣actly
 and 
perfectly,
 without ever failing in any one particular, shall 
live
 there∣by: And on these, and no other terms doth the 
Law
 promise eternal life, which now are not possible to be perform'd by any meer man since 
Adams
 fall. But as for the 
Gospel
 which presents justification by Faith, he tells them, that if he may bring it in speaking, in allusion to 
Moses,
 they should find it would speak in this wise: 
Say not in thine heart,
 (nor give way to any such vile thoughts), 
Who shall ascend into heaven
 to bring the 
Messias
 down from thence, that we may believe in him and obey him? For he is already come from heaven, and actu∣ally exhibited and offered to thee, and if thou wilt be saved, 'tis necessary thou believe that this Jesus is the true 
Messias,
 sent of God; and not only so, but that being crucified here by wicked men, and put to death, and laid in the grave, he rose again the third day, and ascended to the right hand of his Father, there to intercede for us. And say not thou in thy heart, 
Who shall descend into the deep,
 (that is, into the grave), to bring Christ again from the dead? For as he died for the sins of men, so he is assuredly risen again for their justi∣fication. And further, he shews, 'tis agreeable to the 
righteousness which is by Faith,
 in allusion to what 
Moses
 said, to speak thus. The Gospel (which holds forth all these things concerning Christ, and by which men are exhorted, and brought to believe), is openly proclaim'd and preached by the Apostles, and other Ministers of Christ (so that none of you can reasonably pretend ignorance) this 
word,
 I say, is come near unto you, and so plainly declar'd that you may apprehend it in your understandings, believe it in your hearts, and confess it with your mouths
. And he that shall sincerely confess with his mouth, and own Jesus Christ for his Lord and Saviour, 
[see Gal. 2.20. 1 Tim. 1.15.],
 and with his heart believe in him, and depend on the merits of his death ond passion, and believe also his resurrection, shall certainly be saved. For 
Faith
 is the means whereby the 
righteousness
 of Christ is received and made ours; and a 
sincere

 confession
 of Christ is an effect and fruit of that Faith, and so a way
 un∣to eternal salvation. And that there is a real connexion between 
true Faith in Christ,
 and 
eternal salvation,
 (so that he that hath the one, shall not fail of the other), he proves from 
Isa. 28.16.
 where the Prophet saith, 
he that be∣lieveth, [viz.
 in Christ the precious Corner-stone laid in Sion] 
shall not be ashamed,
 nor frustrated of his hope and expectation. And there is no difference between 
Jew
 and 
Gentile
 in this matter. For he that is Lord over all, is rich in his mercy to all, that truly worship him, and call upon him, with a true Faith and Contrition, as he proves from the testimony of the Prophet 
Joel, ch. 2.32.
 which promise belongs to the 
Gentiles
 as well as to the 
Jews,
 as may appear from 
Act. 2.21. From Ver. 1. to 14.


Having thus shewed, that the Promise is universal, that whosoever call upon the Lord in a due manner shall be saved, whether they be 
Jews
 or 
Gentiles,
 hence he inferreth, that the Gospel must be preached to the 
Gentiles,
 and that himself and his fellow Apostles did nothing but what was agreeable to the will of God in so doing. This he proves by an heap of arguments clapt together after this manner. 
Those that
 
call on the name of the Lord and worship him in a right manner shall be saved:
 but none can call on him, except they first believe in him; nor believe in him, except they have been first instructed, and taught to know him; nor can they ordinarily be taught to know him without a Preacher, nor can any lawfully preach them, except they be authoriz'd of God, and sent; and to such the words of the Prophet 
Isaiah, ch. 52.7.
 may be ad∣apted (which were first spoken on occasion of the joyfull tydings brought by the messengers who brought the news of the 
Jews
 deliverance out of the hands of the 
Babylonians), How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of peace, and bring glad Tidings of good things.
 For if the news of that corporal deliverance by 
Cyrus
 was so welcom, how should the Gospel-tidings of spiritual deliverance from the slavery of sin and Satan by Christ be much more welcom? 
From Ver. 14, to 16.


But here he supposes the 
Jews
 (who could not abide to hear the Gospel should be preached to the 
Gentiles
) might object, If the preaching of the Gospel to the 
Gentiles
 be of God, how comes it to pass, that so few of them obey it? To this he answers, that the 
Jews
 were not to be offended hereat. For as the sending of the Apostles to preach the Gospel was foretold in the Scripture as he had proved, so the incredulity of the greatest part of the 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles,
 and the small fruit and effect of the Apostles labours was foretold also, in those words of 
Isa. 53.1. Lord who hath believed our report?
 that is, how few have been perswa∣ded, and wrought upon by our preaching. It follows therefore, that the 
Faith
 of the 
Gentiles
 could not in an ordinary way be otherwise wrought, than by hear∣ing the Gospel preached
, and the Gospel could not be lawfully preached unto them but by the command of God. But then here it might be objected again; If God intend∣ed that the Gospel should be made known, and preached to the 
Gentiles,
 as well as to the 
Gentiles;
 how comes it to pass, that the Apo∣stles have preached it to so few of them? He answers, that not 
a few only
 of the 
Gentiles
 have heard it; for what was said by 
David, Psal. 19.4.
 concern∣ing the preaching of the heavens, may well be said concerning the preaching of the Apostles; 
their sound
 
went into all the earth, and their words into all the world. From Ver. 16. to 19.




But the 
Jews
 might here further object, That they did not know that the Gos∣pel was to be preached to the 
Gentiles,
 and that 
they
 should be called to a par∣ticipation of the grace thereof.


He answers, that 
Moses
 and 
Isaiah
 do both plainly affirm it: As first, 
Mo∣ses, Deut. 32.21.
 where he foretells, that because the 
Jews
 violated the 
con∣jugal Covenant
 between God and them, He would cast them off for their wick∣edness, and bestow their priviledges on the 
Gentiles.
 As if God should have said, You have chosen another God, even your idols; and I will chuse another people, even the 
Gentiles;
 you have angred me by giving my honour to Idols, and I will anger you, by giving your prerogatives to the 
Gentiles. 2ly. Isaiah
 affirms the same, who in 
ch. 65.12.
 predicts the conversion and coming in of the 
Gentiles,
 by the ministry of the Gospel; and also the rejection of the 
Jews,
 declaring bold∣ly and plainly, that God would be sought
 unto, and call'd upon, by those that have not 
in former times
 asked any thing of him; that he would manifest him∣self to them who 
before
 inquired not after him, and prevent their seeking of him by sending unto the seeking of them, 
[see 2 Cor. 5.20. Eph. 2.17].
 And, that the 
Jewish
 Nation, whom he had long laboured with, from time to time, to reduce and reclaim them, spreading forth his hands all the 
long day
 of their vi∣sitation, to invite them, and call them by the preaching of his Prophets, and af∣terwards of his Apostles, (but in vain). He was resolv'd, for their wilfull ob∣stinacy, to reject them, and to receive the 
Gentiles
 in their room. 
From Ver. 19, to the end.


 Having thus spoken of the 
rejection of the Jews
 for their refusing Christ, in the 
9th
 and 
10th
 Chapters, and of the 
calling of the Gentiles;
 he comes now to shew, That the 
Gentiles
 ought not thereupon to insult over the 
Jews.
 For their 
rejection
 is neither 
total,
 nor 
final.
 The 
former
 he proves from 
ver. 1, to 11.
 The 
latter,
 from 
ver. 11, to 33.


1.
 The 
first
 he proves, 
viz. That God hath not totally rejected all, and every one of the Jews,
 by these Arguments. For, 
1.
 He himself being a 
Jew
 was not rejected. 
2ly,
 God hath not cast away those of the 
Jews
 which he fore∣saw
 would (through the operation of his grace) embrace Christ, and believe in him. 
3ly,
 He proves this, by instancing in 
Elias,
 in whose days the 
ten Tribes
 having generally revolted from God, and followed 
Jeroboams
 Idols, the Prophet comes to God, and complains of the wickedness of the people of that time, that they had killed the Lords Prophets, and thrown down his Altars
, (built by pious men of the ten Tribes to serve God with, when they were not permitted to go to 
Jerusalem
), and that himself was now the only pious man left in the Land, (thinking possibly that all that 
Obadiah
 had hid were destroyed by 
Jezebel
), and that was the reason they now attempted to kill him also. God answers him, that he had reserved Seven thousand to himself, that continued in his true worship, who had not bowed the knee to the Image of 
Baal.
 As therefore there were many true wor∣shippers in 
Israel
 in that time of general defection besides 
Elias, 1 King. 19.14.
 so he tells them at this time, though the generality of the 
Jews
 for their refusing of Christ be rejected, yet God had reserved to himself a 
remnant,
 according to his free and gratuitous election, whom he will draw to believe in his Son. Hence he infers two Conclusions. 
1.
 If a remnant be reserved, meerly by the free and gracious election of God, then 'tis not upon the foresight and consideration of the merit of their own works;

 for that which is of 
grace
 is not of 
works. Grace
 and 
works
 (as causes) mutually destroy each other. Grace is 
free
 and
 
gratui∣tous,
 and gives a favour which is not due; but whatso∣ever is given for the merit of works, is not freely given, and consequently is not 
grace.
 Works challenge a reward as a due debt, else they would lose the nature of works done to merit by. The nature of grace is to be free; but the nature of works is to make indebted. If therefore the 
Election
 be meerly of grace, God ought to have all the glory; If it be upon the merit of works foreseen, then corrupt flesh will boast.


2ly.
 His second Inference is this, that though the generality of the 
Israelites,
 (who are so after the flesh), seeking justification and salvation by their own righ∣teousness, and observance of the Law, (and not in a right manner), have not obtain'd it, 
(see ch. 9.31.);
 yet the 
elect
 among them, seeking it in a 
Gos∣pel-way, by Faith in Christ
 have obtain'd it; and the 
rest
 (being left to themselves and the power of the Devil) by the just judgment of God, are blinded and hardned even unto this day
; so that in them is accomplished what the Prophet 
Isaiah [ch. 29 10. & 6.9.]
 long ago prophesied of those 
Israelites,
 who having first hardned their own hearts against God, should be after given up by God to a further obduration; insomuch that the 
spirit of slum∣ber
 should fall upon them, and they should have eyes and ears, wherewith (as the case stood with them) they could neither see nor hear; that is, such a mind where∣with they could not understand the things that concern'd their peace. And what 
David
 said prophetically
 of some in his time, 
Psal. 69.22.
 (by way of retribution to their wickedness), that the things that were appointed for their good, (
viz.
 their necessary food and refreshment), should turn to their mischief, saying, 
Let their table
 
be made a snare,
 and 
a trap,
 and a stumbling block
 and tend to their hurt; and bow down their back
 always, that is, let them savour nothing but 
earthly things,
 having their minds and hearts intent upon them; who being often warn'd of God, would not mind heavenly things. All this the Apostle applies, and adapts to the incredulous 
Jews
 of his time, to whom the very preaching of the Gos∣pel was an occasion of obduration, they growing worse, and not better, by it, and being blinded, discerning nothing of heavenly things. 
From Ver. 1, to 11.


2.
 Having thus shewed, that the 
rejection
 of the 
Jews
 is not 
total,
 he comes now to shew, it is not 
final,
 and that they shall be 
generally called
 before the end of the world, that both 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles
 may make one sheepfold, and one flock under Christ Jesus the great Shepherd. To prove this point, he brings divers Arguments for the comfort of the poor 
Jews,
 and inserts an Admonition to the 
Gentiles,
 not to insult over them. 
From Ver. 17, to 23.


1.
 He shews them, that the 
Jews
 have not so stumbled, that they should fall and never rise again; but God in his righteous judgment hath permitted them to fall, that they having obstinately refused the Gospel, it might be preached to the 
Gentiles;
 and the calling of the 
Gentiles,
 and their receiving of the Gospel, he will in his infinite wisdom make use of, to make the 
Jews
 jealous, and emulous,

 and troubled to see themselves so far out-stripp'd by those whom they so contemn∣ed. And so make that emulation a means to bring them to embrace Christ also. So that his Argument lies thus; If the rejection of the 
Jews
 occasioned the Cal∣ling of the 
Gentiles,
 whom they shall one day be provoked
 to emulate and follow, then the 
Jews
 shall be called. But the 
first
 is true, in the Text, there∣fore the 
last.


2.
 If their 
casting off
 were so profitable to the World, much more will their 
calling home
 be. If their rejection did further the salvation of the 
Gentiles,
 insomuch that the paucity
 of Believers among them, proved the 
riches of the World,
 that is, occasion'd a numerous and copious conversion of the 
Gen∣tiles,
 and spread a rich and an abundant knowledg of Christ in the World; how much more shall a general calling and c nversion of them confirm the Faith of the believing 
Gentiles,
 and be a means to convert those of them that do 
not believe
 all over the World.


3.
 He shews, that he himself is an Apostle of the 
Gentiles,
 and did earnestly desire to make his ministry glorious, in converting as many of them as he could, and the rather, that he might provoke his own Nation, not to suffer the 
Gen∣tiles alone
 to enjoy the priviledges of the Sons of God, but that 
they
 would join themselves unto them, that so 
they
 also might be saved. Therefore he inti∣mates, that the case of the 
Jews
 is not desperate, nor ought to be look'd upon with contempt by the 
Gentiles.


4.
 That he might further urge his Argument which he had made use of at 
v. 12.
 he shews, That if the 
casting off
 of the contumacious 
Jews
 be a means of sending the Gospel to the 
Gentiles,
 and so of bringing 
them
 to Faith in Christ, (whereby they obtain pardon of their sins, and reconciliation with God), What a miracle of mercy will the 
re-assuming
 of them again into Gods favour be, (upon their embracing of Christ), even as great, and as fit to work upon the 
Gentiles,
 and make them rejoice, as if they should see their dear friends (whom they entirely loved) raised from the dead again
.


5.
 He uses another Argument, taken from the relation of the 
Jews
 to the Covenant made with their Fathers, arguing after his manner: The holy Nation; that is, the Nation which is Gods peculiar people, and 
federally holy,
 cannot be cast off for ever; but the 
Jews
 are an holy Nation, which he proveth, because they are descended of 
holy Parents;
 and if any doubt of that, he proves it by two similitudes, 
viz.
 of the 
first-fruits,
 and 
root,
 which being 
holy
 make the 
lump,
 and the 
branches
 holy. Concerning the 
first fruits,
 the Law is set down 
Lev. 23.
 by which the people were not permitted to put sickle into their corn till they had offered a 
sheaf
 to the Lord, and then it was lawful for them to reap it; and when they had inn'd their Corn, they might not eat of it, till they had offered 
two loaves
 to the Lord, and then was their whole 
lump
 sanctified, and made lawfull for them to eat. Now he shews, that the Patriarchs, 
Abraham, Isaac,
 and 
Jacob
 were as the 
first-fruits,
 and the people of the 
Jews
 were as the lump. The 
Jews
 therefore being descended from those holy Patriarchs, to whom and their seed the Covenant is made, 
[I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed],
 have still a relation to that Covenant made with their Fathers; and so their case is not desperate. And the same is the sense of the other similitude. As the 
branches
 follow the nature of the 
root,
 so do the 
Jews
 the condition of those holy Patriarchs, in regard of the outward priviledges of the Covenant; that is, not in respect of 
personal
 and 
inherent,
 but 
faederal
 and 
external
 holiness, so as they may expect to be owned by God as his visible Church. 
From Ver. 11, to 17.


But here some 
Gentile
 might object, We acknowledg the 
root
 of the 
Jewish


 Nation to be holy, but what good doth the holiness of the root to these incredulous branches, that are now broken off, and rejected of God? The Apostle answers, That some of the branches are indeed broken off from the sweet 
Olive-tree,
 (that is, from the Church of the holy Patriarchs); and the 
Gentiles,
 that are as a wild Olive, and not sprung from that holy root, are by Faith grafted in among the branches that remain in the sweet Olive, and so imitating the Faith of the holy Patriarchs, are made 
one Church
 with them, and thereby partake of the root and fatness of the 
sweet Olive,
 that is, of the Doctrine and grace of Christ, and all the spi∣ritual benefits and priviledges which he conferreth on his Church. But yet seeing the 
Gentiles
 are, of 
meer grace,
 grafted in, (being before in a forlorn condi∣tion), they should not disdainfully boast, or insult over the branches that are broken off, 
viz.
 the incredulous 
Jews;
 for they are 
natural
 branches of that body and root, which bears the believing 
Gentiles,
 and have an outward fellowship with the Olive; that is, they are the natural Children of 
Abraham,
 who 
in some degree
 is despised, when his Children are despised; so that if they insult over these branches, they do in a manner lift up themselves against the root, which bore these branches, even against 
Abraham
 himself, who is call'd the root of this Olive-tree, in respect, that he is the Parent from which the 
Jews
 naturally de∣scend, and in respect of the Covenant that God made with him. And further, they should consider, that this root doth bear the believing 
Gentiles,
 and not 
they
 the root. The Church of the 
Jews
 is our 
Mother-Church; Salvation is of the Jews,
 as our Saviour speaks, 
Joh. 4.22.
 The 
Gentiles
 are not called to make a 
several
 Church by themselves; neither do they so: For there is but 
one Church;
 but they are called to be members of the Church of the 
Jews,
 as Christ saith, 
Joh. 10.16. I have other sheep which are not yet of this fold,
 (that is, the Elect among the 
Gentiles), them I must bring into this fold, that there may be one fold,
 (or Church), 
and one shepherd.
 But the Christian 
Gentile
 might here again object, that though the 
Jew
 be the 
natu∣ral Olive,
 and the 
Gentile
 the 
wild Olive;
 yet the 
Jews
 are broken off, that the 
Gentiles
 might be grafted in. He answers, The proper cause of the breaking off of the 
Jews,
 was their infidelity, and not the coming in of the 
Gentiles;
 for they came in by accident; and the proper cause of the coming in, and the present standing of the 
Gentiles,
 is their 
Faith:
 Therefore they should not be high-minded, but fear, and accordingly look to their standing. And as a man that is on the top of a tree brags not of his height, but looks to his hold, so ought they. For if God spared not the natural branches, but proceeded with so much severity against his own people the 
Jews,
 the 
Gentiles
 have no reason to expect less severity, if they take not heed to themselves. Two things therefore he inti∣mates in this matter, are especially to be considered by them. 
1.
 The severity of God against the incredulous 
Jews,
 to whom Christ was a stone of stumbling. 
2.
 His infinite mercy and grace, in effectually calling the 
Gentiles
 to Faith in Christ, in which they are to continue
 and abide; o∣therwise they also shall be cut off from the 
Olive,
 that is, the true Church. So likewise the 
Jews,
 if they con∣tinue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in again; for God is able to do it. Yea he shews, the thing is not only possible, but very probable, because God hath grafted in the 
Gentiles,
 that are branches of the wild Olive; and 'tis 
contrary to nature,
 to graft a wild Olive branch into a right Olive; but 
natural,
 to graft into it one of its own kind. If therefore he hath grafted in the 
Gentiles,
 'tis much more likely he will re-ingraft the 
Jews,
 that are the natural branches, (naturally descended of 
Abra∣ham
 and the holy 
Patriarchs,
 with whom he made his Covenant), into their own Olive tree, from which they were cut off for their unbelief. 
From Ver. 17, to 25.




Having thus shewed the 
possibility
 and 
probability
 of the Calling of the 
Jews,
 he now comes to shew, the 
certainty
 of it; and takes his argument from the revelation of this 
mystery
 or 
secret
 made to himself by the Spirit of God, which he was to impart to the 
Gentiles.
 And accordingly tells them, he would not have them ignorant of it, Lest they should be tempted, proudly to despise the 
Jews
 as utter 
cast-aways.
 For he acquaints them, that 
blindness
 and 
obduration
 is not come upon the 
Jews
 universally, but on 
some
 of them only, and that for a certain time; namely, till a greater number of the 
Gentiles,
 than ever before, shall be brought to believe in Christ, and so enter into the true Church; with the coming in of which great multitude, the 
Jews
 shall be provoked to turn to Christ; and so all 
Israel;
 that is, the 
generality
 of the 
Israelites
 shall be brought to embrace Christ, and thereby be put into a way of salvation. When therefore the 
fulness
 of the 
Gentiles
 is come in, there shall be a famous and universal calling of the 
Jews.
 And this he shews, is agreeable to the Prophesie, 
Isa. 59.20, 21.
 where the 
Pro∣phet,
 respecting the time of the coming of the 
Messiah,
 saith, 
The deliverer (viz.
 the 
Messias,
 who was typified by 
Cyrus) shall come to Sion;
 but the Apostle looking further, even to those things that were to follow the coming of Christ, by way of 
accommodation,
 saith, 
The Redeemer shall come out of Sion,
 that is, out of the midst of his Church, where he dwelleth and abideth by his Spirit, and 
shall effectually call the Jews.
 The Prophet indeed says, 
He shall come to them, that return from iniquity in Jacob.
 But the Apostle (following the 
Septuagint,
 which was understood by the 
Gentiles
) saith, 
he shall turn iniquity from Jacob;
 and so instead of mentioning Christs coming, he speaketh of a 
benefit
 that should 
follow his Coming,
 which is, the re∣mission of sin. Now where God forgives sin, he first gives the grace of true con∣version, and therefore the 
Jews
 shall be converted. And he further shews, that this is Gods 
Covenant,
 which he will fulfill unto them, namely, to 
pardon their sins,
 and they that shall have their sins pardoned, shall be first effectually called, and so the 
Jews
 shall reap the 
benefit
 of the Covenant, when they shall feel the 
efficacy
 of it, turning their hearts to God, and perswading them to embrace Jesus Christ by Faith. 
From Ver. 25, to 28.


But some might here object, What! shall the 
Jews
 be called and pardoned, that are Gods enemies, whom he hates for rejecting the Gospel? He answers, They are 
enemies,
 and yet 
beloved
 in divers respects. If we respect the 
Gos∣pel,
 they are Gods enemies, and hated by him; namely, because they refuse and persecute it, spurn and kick against it; and do the more persecute and hate it for the 
Gentiles sake,
 because they see them love and embrace it, and that thereupon they are admitted into the Church. But if we respect Gods 
election of this people,
 above all other Nations, to be his 
peculiar
 people, and how they are descended of those holy Patriarchs, 
Abraham, Isaac,
 and 
Jacob,
 (with whom the Lord entred into Covenant, and promised to be 
their God,
 and 
the God of their seed after them
); in this 
regard
 they are 
beloved
 of God. For Gods special favours to the 
Jews,
 and his calling them to be his people, are such things as he will never change, or repent of. 
From Ver. 28, to 30.


His last argument for the 
general calling
 of the 
Jews,
 is this; God after a long time of disobedience received the 
Gentiles
 to mercy; therefore there is reason to think, that he will at last receive the 
Jews
 also. For (according to the rule), 
Of like things there is the same judgment to be made.
 Now the 
Gentiles,
 who were formerly disobedient, have obtained mercy, by occasion of the 
Jews
 infidelity and obstinacy; God sending the Gospel to them which the 
Jews
 rejected. And as the 
Gentiles were
 disobedient, so 
are
 the 
Jews
 now: as the 
Gentiles have
 obtained mercy, so 
shall
 the 
Jews:
 yet with this diffe∣rence, The 
Gentiles
 obtained mercy by the unbelief of the 
Jews;
 but the 
Jews
 shall obtain mercy, by the mercy shewed to the 
Gentiles,
 being provo∣ked



 to emulation by the multitude of converted 
Gentiles;
 and shall themselves also be brought to believe in Christ; and shall count it a shame for them, [a people so highly favoured of God), to be out stripp'd by the 
Gentiles.
 So that the argument is from the 
less to the greater.
 If the 
infidelity
 of the 
Jews
 was an occasion of mercy to the 
Gen∣tiles,
 much more shall the 
mercy
 shewed to the 
Gentiles,
 be an occasion of mercy to the 
Jews.
 And all this serves to illustrate the grace and mercy of God, both to 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles,
 that 
both
 may obtain salvation, not by their own 
works,
 but by his 
grace,
 without which neither of them can be saved. For God, as a just Judg, hath suffered
 both 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles, successively
 (for some time) to remain under the pow∣er of their unbelief and disobedience, that he might in his own time, fulfill the 
great counsel
 of his good∣ness, in shewing undeserv'd mercy upon them all
, namely, both 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles. From Ver. 30. to 33.


In the Conclusion of this discourse, he falls into an admiration of the 
depth
 of the abundant 
goodness
 of God, in bearing with the disobedience and contu∣macy of the 
Gentiles
 first, and then of the 
Jews;
 and of his 
wisdom
 in ma∣king the rejection of the 
Jews,
 a means of calling the 
Gentiles;
 and of his 
knowledg
 in knowing how to work upon the obstinate 
Jews,
 by his mercy shew∣ed unto the 
Gentiles.
 He shews, his judgments and works are unsearchable, and the ways and methods of his providence past finding out. For no Creature can pierce into the mind of God, nor was ever called to be of his Counsel; 
see Isa. 40.13, 14. 1 Cor. 2.16.
 In fine, he shews, That if any shall yet complain of these dispensations of God, which he hath been speaking of, and shall think that God deals hardly with the 
Jews
 in rejecting them, and calling the 
Gen∣tiles;
 let him remember, No man can challenge God, as if he were indebted to him, or owed him any thing. He asks, Who ever gave any thing to God, that he did not first receive from him? or who can merit any thing at his hands? 
see Job 41.2.
 He owes us nothing, but what he is pleased of his own meer good∣ness, freely to promise us? And if so, who hath cause to complain, if he deal more bountifully with some, than with others
. For all things are 
of him,
 as the 
first Author:
 all things are upheld 
by him,
 as the 
Preserver:
 all things are dis∣posed of by him as the 
supream Director:
 all things tend 
to him,
 as the 
ultimate End:
 therefore all things ought to be subservient to his glory, to whom all praise, honour and glory ought for ever to be ascribed. 
Amen. From Ver. 33, to the end.


The Apostle having now done with the First part of his Epistle, 
viz.
 the 
doctri∣nal:
 
 He comes to the Second, which is 
practical;
 wherein he gives divers 
precepts
 of Christian life. 
From Chap. 12. to Ver. 14, of Chap. 15.


1.
 He intreats them by those great mercies which God hath vouchsafed to them, to present their bodies
, (that is, their whole man both Soul and Body), a 
living sacrifice,
 (enlivened and quickned by the Spirit of Christ), 
holy,
 (in respect both of inward affections, and outward actions), 
acceptable to God,
 (through Christ) which is a 
reasonable service;
 and far more valuable in his sight, than the offering or sacrificing of unreasonable beasts. He intreats them also, not to conform themselves to the carnal conversation of the world, that lies in wickedness, but to endeavour to be transformed, and changed by the renewing of

 their 
minds
 and 
wills,
 that so they may discern what is the 
good
 and 
perfect will
 of God, revealed in his word, and may heartily 
approve
 it, and willingly 
conform
 themselves to it. 
Ver. 1, 2.


2.
 By virtue of his Apostolick Office, which he had of grace received, he injoins those among them, who had any special gifts, or publick office in the Church, that they should not be proud of them, nor pretend to be wise above their 
capacity
 and 
calling,
 but carrying themselves 
soberly
 and 
modestly,
 (according to the measure of the gifts and graces of the Spirit conferred on them, upon their be∣lieving
 in Christ, 
Eph. 4.7.
), should imploy them to the best advantage of the Church. For as in the natu∣ral body, several members are deputed to several offices; so it is in the Church, where all the faithful are 
one body
 under 
Christ the Head,
 and members one of ano∣ther, and on that account, ought mutually to serve one another. Therefore every one should demean himself 
so∣berly
 in the use of the gift given him; as particularly, if any one have the gift of 
Prophesie,
 or interpreting the Scripture, he should prophesie according to the 
analogy
 or 
rule
 of Faith, that is, conform his interpretations to the 
rule
 of the Holy Scriptures, and teach nothing disagreeable thereunto. 
He
 likewise that hath any office or ministry in the Church should attend on 
that;
 as for instance, He that 
teacheth,
 or is imployed in lay∣ing down sound doctrine, and confuting error (as 
Professors
 in the Schools, and 
Catechists
 in parochial Congregations now do) should diligently attend on that work. He that hath the office of a 
Pastor,
 to exhort the people, and apply the word, he should attend to 
that. He
 that hath the office of distributing the Churches stock, should labour to do it with simplicity and good fidelity. 
He
 that hath the office of a 
Ruler
 in the Church, 
[1 Cor. 12.28. 1 Tim. 5.17.],
 and is to look to the manners of people, should do it with diligence. Lastly, 
He
 that sheweth mercy, 
viz.
 that has the particular care of strangers, or the sick, or impotent persons, and Orphans, should do it chearfully, and with a willing mind. 
From Ver. 3, to 9.


3.
 He exhorts to several Christian duties necessary in our conversation. Such as are, 
1.
 Sincere love. 
2.
 Abhorring evil, and embracing that which is good. 
3.
 Brotherly kindness. 
4.
 Giving to others the honour due to them. 
5.
 Sedu∣lity and industry in their particular Callings. 
6.
 Fervency of Spirit in the Lords service. 
7.
 Encouraging themselves under afflictions with hope of deliverance, be∣ing patient in tribulation, and continuing instant in prayer. 
8.
 Beneficence and communicating to the poor Saints, hospitality to distressed strangers that come to them. 
9.
 Blessing their persecutors. 
10.
 Sympathizing with one another in prosperity and adversity. 
11.
 Ʋnanimity and mutual concord, 
[Phil. 2.2.4.],
 wishing the like good unto others as unto themselves. 
12.
 Not minding or pre∣tending to high mysterious things, but following the examples of lowly, modest, and meek Christians; not conceiting themselves wiser than others. 
13.
 Not recompencing injuries with injuries. 
14.
 Taking care by honesty and innocency of life to cut off all occasion from any, of reviling them, 
2 Cor. 8.21. 15.
 Peace∣ableness with all men as far as they can. 
16.
 Forbearing private revenge, and to suffer their own, and their adversaries anger to cool, remembring that it be∣longs to God either immediately by himself, or else by the Magistrate to revenge injuries. Therefore they should do good to their enemies instead of evil, which is the way to heap Coals of fire on their heads, and to melt them and soften them, if there be any ingenuity in them. And, Lastly, Not to suffer themselves to be so far transported or overcome with injuries as to be prompted to revenge them. For to conquer the malice of their enemies with kindness, is the best kind of victory. 
From Ver. 9, to the end.




5.
 In the next place, he exhorts them, To yeild 
due obedience
 and 
subjecti∣on
 
 to Magistrates. For every 
lawful power,
 ruling according to righteousness, is Gods 
ordination;
 and he that resists and opposes such a power, sets himself against Gods ordinance, and so brings upon himself punishment
, as well from God as the Magistrate. For the office of the Magistrate is ordained by God, (and to such he enjoins this conscientious obedience), to restrain and punish 
wicked∣edness,
 and to encourage what is 
good
 and praise-worthy. The Magistrate is the Minister of God for the 
good
 of men, and ordain'd for this end, to keep up 
good order
 in the world, being arm'd with the 
sword of power
 to punish those that are wicked and exorbitant. Therefore, he shews, it is necessary they should be subject, not only that they may avoid the anger of the Magistrate, but in re∣spect of Gods command, who injoins this subjection. And for this cause, (
viz.
 the avoiding wrath, and to perform their duty towards God), he tells them, they ought to pay tribute to Magistrates, as to the Ministers of God, who are continually employed in the defence of the publick peace and tranquillity, and in maintaining justice, righteousness, and good order among men. And seeing 
justice
 requires us to give every one their 
due,
 they ought to pay to Magistrates, (whether supream or subordinate), 
tribute, custom, fear, reverence,
 and 
honour,
 ac∣cording as their respective places and degrees require. 
From Ver. 1, to 8.


6.
 Having exhorted them, to pay every man what they owe him, whether 
mo∣ney, service,
 or 
respect;
 he tells them, there is one debt they can never be quit of, but must be always paying, and that is, to 
love
 
one another;
 which duty if any man perform ab∣solutely, and in 
all respects
 as he ought, he may be said not to have perform'd obedience only to 
one
 or 
two
 Com∣mandments of the Second Table, but to have fulfilled them all. For all of them (many whereof he enumerates, though not in order) are branches, and parts of that great duty of 
Charity,
 and 
loving our Neighbour;
 so that he that truly loves his Neighbour as he ought, will not injure him in any thing, whether in his 
life, wife, goods, good name;
 and so fulfills the Law. 
From Ver. 8, to 11.


7.
 This duty of 
loving one another,
 he shews, they should the rather per∣form, seeing they were not 
unbelievers
 now, and in the dark night of ignorance as formerly, but the Gospel-light had arisen unto them, and therefore it was high time for them to rouse
 up, and awaken themselves to a performance of those duties, which that glorious revelation call'd them to; and the rather, because now they were come nearer salvation, (which is the end of their race, 
1 Pet. 1.9.
), than when they first believed. As therefore they that run a 
race,
 the nearer they come to the 
stand,
 the faster they run; so should they increase more and more in holiness, the nearer they come to their end. They should remember that the 
night
 of Heathenish ignorance and gross darkness is in great measure past, and the 
Gospel-light
 hath dawn'd upon them; therefore they should renounce the works of darkness, and put on the 
armour of light,
 that is, all manner of Chri∣stian virtues, (which become those that walk in the light, and are both the 
ha∣bit
 and 
armour
 of a Christian), whereby they may be arm'd to combat Satan, and all their spiritual enemies, 
[1 Thess. 5.8.];
 and they should labour to walk piously before God, and honestly and fairly before men, as becomes those to whom the glorious light of the Gospel hath appeared, abstaining from all intemperance, and filthiness, from all strife and envy, and should put on Christ and his righte∣ousness, by Faith, deriving vertue from him to enable them to all holy walking, and should adorn themselves with an holy imitation of his virtues, not making provision to satisfie or please the inordinate lusts of the flesh. 
From Ver. 11, to the end.




 
8.
 He comes now to give some directions concerning the right use of 
Christi∣an liberty.
 It seems, some of the 
Jews
 at 
Rome,
 (who had given their Names to Christ), thought the observation of the Ceremonial Law, (as to meats and days), was yet to be continued; for the 
Council
 at 
Jerusalem, Act. 15.
 left them to a free use of those Ceremonies, till the Gospel shining forth more clearly to them, should convince them that they were to be laid aside. But the believing 
Gentiles
 being fully perswaded of their freedom from this yoke, and of the liberty given them by Christ, refused communion with those 
Jews
 that lived after that manner. Among these therefore there arose a 
dissention
 which hindred the work of the Gospel; the 
weak
 censuring the strong, 
as prophane,
 for using such a liberty; and the 
strong
 despising the weak, as 
over-scrupulous
 in not using it. Hereupon the Apostle, that he might obviate this evil, goes in a 
mid∣dle way,
 admonishing the 
believing Jews,
 that they should so follow their own opinion as not to condemn the believing 
Gentiles,
 who were otherwise perswaded; and he admonishes the 
believing Gentiles,
 that they should not refuse 
commu∣nion
 with the 
believing Jews,
 who still adhered to some of those Ceremonial ob∣servances; but though they were 
weak,
 as to the knowledg of some points of the Christian Faith, yet they should receive them into their fellowship, and not take upon them, to 
judg their thoughts
, whether they u∣sed those things as 
necessary,
 or as things only 
profita∣ble
 for the time. He tells them, he understood, that the 
strong
 among them, and such as were well-grounded in the liberty Christ hath given under the Gospel, thought they might freely eat any thing: Others that were 
weak,
 rather than eat any meats forbidden by the Law, 
[see Lev. 11.8.],
 contented themselves only with herbs. The case being thus between them, he forbids them 
both
 from censuring each other, and that for divers reasons. 
1.
 Because God hath not rejected either of them, but called the 
one
 as well as the 
other
 to the knowledg and belief of his Son, and so receiv'd them into his Family. 
2.
 They are both Servants of Christ; he is Lord of all. And therefore (says he) consider, O man, whether thy Brother stand, and continue firm in the Faith
, or whether he fall, and sin against God, he standeth or falleth not to thee, but to his own Master. Thou hast no authority to judg him, look thou to thy own standing. Neither do thou, O 
Jew,
 who seest the 
Gentile
 use his Christian liberty as to 
meats
 and 
days,
 judg him as 
pro∣phane,
 and suspect his Apostacy from the Faith; for God (who is able) will preserve him from such a fall. 
3.
 As to that other matter, [
viz.
 the observation of days] he advises, that every one should be well satisfied in his own mind, as to the grounds of his 
doing
 or 
omitting
 those things, that so he may not 
knowingly
 offend God. And in this case, they ought not to censure one another, because the 
Jew
 by 
observing
 these days, intendeth to do honour and service to God thereby. And the 
Gentile
 by 
not observing
 them, intendeth to do that which he thinketh is agreeable to the mind and will of God in that matter; so that both aiming at the 
same end,
 they ought not to condemn one another. And the case also stand∣eth thus, as to that other matter of 
meats;
 the 
strong
 giveth God thanks for his liberty, and for the meat which he alloweth him freely to eat of; and the 
weak,
 though he abstain from meats that were by the Law once forbidden, yet he giveth God thanks, because he hath meat enough that is not forbidden. And if it be the general intention, and design of every faithful Christian, (as certainly it is), so to 
live,
 that he may 
live to Christ;
 and so to 
dye,
 as he may be for ever 
his;
 surely he ought so to direct all his particular actions, (and consequent∣ly his use of 
days
 and 
meats
), as may tend to his glory. And there is great reason he should do so; for Christ both 
dyed
 and 
rose
 again for this end, that he might be Lord over his 
redeemed
 ones, both 
living
 and 
dying;
 and having

 redeemed us with his precious blood, we ought to conform our selves to his will, and not rashly to judg one another, but to leave 
judging
 to him before whose tribunal we shall all be judged, and where 
all (will they, nill they)
 shall ac∣knowledg subjection to him; as he proves from 
Isa. 45.23.
 where the 
Prophet
 saith, 
God hath sworn;
 but the 
Apostle
 setteth down the 
form of Gods Oath,
 who because he hath not a greater to 
swear by,
 sweareth by Himself. And whereas the 
Prophet
 saith, 
every tongue shall swear
 
by me;
 the 
Apostle
 (following the 
Sep∣tuagint
) saith, 
every tongue shall confess,
 which is a consequent of the other; for he that 
sweareth,
 con∣fesseth God, and calleth him to be a 
Witness
 and a 
Judg;
 and what is 
there
 in the general spoken of 
God,
 is 
here
 particularly applied to 
Christ,
 to whom every one of us must give an account of our selves. 
From Ver. 1, to 13.


9.
 He advises the 
strong,
 to take heed of giving offence to the 
weak,
 and to judg it best, and most becoming them, to take heed, that by the unseasonable use of their liberty, they do not lay a stumbling block in their way, 
[Lev. 19.14.],
 which may cause them to fall, that is, either to do a thing doubtingly, or else to take offence, and fall off from Christianity. But some Christian 
Gentile
 might here object and say, I am perswaded in my Conscience, that no 
meat
 is impure, or prohibited under the Gospel. He answers, that 
meat
 that is in it self 
clean
 and allowed, is made 
unclean
 to him, that thinks it unlawful. And on the o∣ther side, if any one fully satisfied of his liberty, do eat it to the hurt of his weak Brother, in that case he does amiss; for these reasons. 
1.
 'Tis against Charity to act so in things indifferent, as to induce a weak Brother, to do such things as may afterwards be a great grief and perplexity to him
. 
2.
 'Tis the way to occasion him to sin, and so to do what lies in us to bring destruction upon him, who, (professing Faith in Christ), is in the judgment
 of Charity to be esteemed such an one for whom Christ dyed, 
[1 Cor. 8.11.]. 3.
 Eating with offence, causeth 
Chri∣stian liberty,
 purchased by Christ, to be evil spoken of. 
4.
 The spiritual 
kingdom
 of Christ consisteth not in such things as 
meats
 and 
drinks,
 but in 
righteousness, peace
 and 
joy in the Holy Ghost, [1 Cor. 8.8.];
 therefore we may well abstain from an undue use of 
them,
 and of other indifferent things, when our Brother is like to be hurt thereby. So that upon the whole matter, he tells them, That they that use these things 
wisely
 to the honour of Christ, (taking them with his leave when they may, and abstaining from them at other times, when his work and service may be thereby promoted, and not hindred), do please God, and are acceptable to men. Lastly, he tells them, they ought to follow after peace, and the things whereby they may edifie one another. There∣fore the 
work
 of God, 
viz.
 the 
Christianity
 of a weak Brother ought not to be endangered for such a small matter, as to eat 
this
 or 
that
 meat is; lest he should thereby be offended, provoked, and fall off from his Chri∣stian profession. But here some might urge, that 
all meats are pure
 and 
lawful.
 He answers, 'Tis true, they are so in themselves, but 'tis evil notwithstanding for us to eat them with offence. Therefore when our Brother is like to be 
offended,
 and made more weak or in∣firm in his Faith by our using such or such meats and drinks, 'tis best for us to abstain. But some will urge again, 
I have Faith
, (that is, I am fully perswaded, 'tis lawful for me to eat), and 'tis necessary that I profess it, and own it, and assert this my liberty. He answers, Thou maist en∣joy thy perswasion to thy self, but maist not use it, or profess it to the hurt of thy Brother; yea thou must so

 use it, as one that must give an account of thy self and thy actions to God. And he tells them, that he is a happy man
, that when he knows a thing to be lawful, doth so use his liberty a∣bout it, as to have no reason to accuse, or condemn him∣self; and who judgeth not in himself, that 
that
 ought not to be done, which he doth. Therefore he adviseth those that are 
doubtful
 concerning the lawfulness of using such or such meats, to ab∣stain; because he that 
doubts
 whether he should eat, and yet eats, he is con∣demn'd of himself, because he doth it without being satisfied of its lawfulness. For whatsoever is not done 
of Faith,
 that is, with a perswasion that it is lawful, is to him that does it, sinful. 
From Ver. 13, to the end.


 
10.
 He further shews, that those that are 
strong,
 and have attain'd to a greater measure of knowledg, should bear with the infirmities of the weak, and labour to keep them from falling, not seeking only to please themselves, but their neighbour, in things tending to his good and edification. This he urges from the example of Christ, who did not seek to please
 himself, or the inclination of Nature, (which abhorreth pain and suffering); but he so carried himself, that 
that
 may truly be applied to him, which is written 
Pal. 69.9. The reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me,
 that is, The sins of men, which in their own nature are injuries against God, and cast reproach upon him, I have taken them upon me, or they are laid upon me to expiate them, 
[Isa. 53.4.].
 And seeing Christ sought not his own ease, but our benefit, we ought in like manner to seek the good of our Neighbour, and to do that which may tend to the promoting his salvation. And lest any should object, that such passages as those of the Psalmist belonged not to them, he tells them, that those things that were before written, were written for our instruction, that we exercising such pa∣tience as the Scripture prescribes, especially in bearing with the infirmities of our weak Christian Brethren, might have the comforts the Scripture promiseth, and particularly be confirm'd in hope of obtaining eternal Salvation by Christ Jesus. He prays, that God who worketh patience and comfort in the hearts of his people by the holy Scriptures, would give them the grace of 
Unity
 and 
Charity,
 such as Christ commands and expects from them; that all 
strife
 and 
discord
 being laid aside, they might with one heart and mouth glorifie God, who is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore after the example of Christ, (who came from Heaven, and laid down his life to redeem both 
Jew
 and 
Gentile,
 and receives both into the arms of his mercy, intending to make them both, upon their Faith in him, to be partakers of the glory of God), he exhorts them, with all love and kindness, to receive one another into their communion, not disdaining, or rejecting, or judging one another. And that the Christian 
Gentile
 might not despise the 
Jewish
 Believers, he tells them, that Christ was appointed a 
Minister to the circumcised
 
Jews,
 that God might appear to be true in his promises made to the Fathers, of sending the 
Mes∣sias
 to them. And accordingly Christ preached to the 
Jews
 in his own person, but to the 
Gentiles
 by his A∣postles. And on the other side, that the 
Jewish
 Christi∣an might not reject the 
Gentile believer,
 (who makes use of his lawful liberty), he tells them, that God hath been most wonderfully merciful to the 
Gentiles,
 and hath received them according to his promises made in the Old Testament, and they have great cause to glorifie God for his mercy, which they would have no reason to do, if they had not been received to mercy. And this he proves by a fourfold testimony. First, from 
Psal. 18.49. I will praise thee, and sing unto thee among the Gentiles.
 Where 
David
 who was a Type of Christ, promiseth that he will pub∣lish
 the name of God among the 
Gentiles
.

 
2ly.
 From 
Deut. 32.43.
 Where the 
Gentiles
 are commanded to rejoice and praise God with the 
Jews. 3
y.
 From 
Psal. 117.1.
 The 
Gentiles
 are commanded 
to praise God,
 and that plainly intimates, they shall obtain mercy. Lastly, From 
Isa. 11.10.
 Where the 
Prophet
 prophesying of Christ, who was to come of 
Da∣vids
 Family, (under the type of 
Hezekiah
 lineally descended from 
David
), saith, that 
he shall be for a standard
 
to the Gentiles,
 to whom they shall come and resort, by the preaching of the Gospel, and over whom he shall reign as King, and that they shall trust and rely on him, and believe in him.


He concludes this discourse concerning their abstaining from the unseasonable use of their 
Christian liberty
 with a most ardent 
prayer,
 that God, in whom all true Believers repose all their trust, and from whom they expect all good things, would fill them with all joy, and peace in believing, that through the working of the Holy Ghost in them, they may abound in hope of having and enjoying eternal life. 
From Ver. 1, to 14.


He begins now to conclude his Epistle,
 excusing himself that he had written somewhat boldly unto them. For though he was perswaded that the 
Romans
 abounded in grace, and the knowledg of all things pertaining to Salvation, and were able to instruct one another, yet he thought fit to write unto them, and to 
stir
 them up to the practice of that which they knew already; 
this
 being a branch of his Apostolical Office, (conferred on him by the grace of God), as well as 
that
 of making known the Gospel. And so by real effects he should prove
 that he was a Minister of Christ, sent to preach the Gospel to the 
Gentiles,
 that they being converted by his ministry, might be offer'd to God as a 
Sacrifice,
 sancti∣fyed by the Spirit, and so acceptable to God. And seeing he had brought so many 
Gentiles
 to the 
Faith
 by his ministry, he had great matter of rejoi∣cing, not in 
himself,
 but that through the assistance of Christ, he had been enabled to be faithful in the matters that concern'd the glory and service of God. Neither durst he speak more than Christ had really effected by him, (in the conversion of the 
Gentiles
), namely, by his preaching, and ministry, and the signs, and won∣ders which the Holy Ghost had enabled him to do, that the 
Gentiles
 might be convinc'd thereby, of the truth of his Doctrine. So that from 
Jerusalem
 and the Countries round about unto 
Illyricum,
 (now called 
Sclavonia
 lying on the 
Adriatick
 Sea), he had spread the Gospel, his design being to preach Christ in those places where he had not been preached before, that he might not build on ano∣ther mans foundation. So that in his ministry that Prophesie, 
Isa. 52.15.
 was fulfilled, 
To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see,
 (that is, believe
 in him), 
and they that have not heard, shall understand.
 And he tells them, that th
se his great employments elsewhere in planting the Gospel, had hindred him from coming to them hitherto. But now finding no place in these parts where the foun∣dation was yet to be laid, and having no more occasion to de∣tain him here, (that he foresaw), he gives them hopes of his coming, and tarrying a while with them in his journey, which he intend∣ed for 
Sp
in,
 after h
 had satisfied himself with the pleasure of being among them, and been something refreshed with their company. He tells them, he was now going to 
Jerusalem,
 to carry thither the charitable contributions of the 
Greek Churche
,
 for the r
li
f 
f the poor Saints in 
Judea,
 which office of love, he inti∣mates,

 those Churches were in some sort obliged to perform unto th
m, b
cause the Gospel came from the 
Jews
 to the Gentiles. And seeing the 
G
ntiles
 had been made partakers of their spiritual things, it was but just they should minister to them in carnal things. When therefore he had finished this journey and service, and had 
sealed,
 that is, delivered to them at 
Jerusalem,
 safely without dimi∣nution, (as a treasure under Seal), this fruit of the Faith, and L
ve of the aforesaid Churches, he intended to visit them. In the mean time he suggests to them hopes of great spiritual bl
ssings
 to be conferred by his ministry upon them at his coming, that so they might more earnestly desire it. Lastly, He beseech
s them for Christs sake, and the love of God wrought in their hearts by the Spirit, that they would be importunate in their prayers to God for him, that he may be delivered from the snares of the unb
li
ving 
Jews
 in 
Judea,
 who vehement∣ly thirsted after his blood: And that the relief he brought to the poor Saints in 
Judea
 might be kindly accepted by them, though it came from the 
Gentile
 Churches. And lastly, That he might come to them with joy, (if it be the will of God), and might rejoice together with them, and be re∣freshed with their company and converse. And so giving them his Apostolical be∣nediction, he d
sires the God of peace, unity, and concord, and Author of all bles∣sings to be with them, to bless and preserve them. 
From Ver. 14, to the end.


In the close of his Epistle, He commends to them 
Phoebe,
 who served the Church at 
Cenchrea,
 (an Haven of 
Corinth
), in receiving and harbouring poor Chri∣stians that were driven out of their own Country, and particularly had been a succourer of the Apostle himself. He exhorts them, to receive her in the Lord, (that is, with Christian affection for the Lords sake): And to assi
t her in her outward affairs, and businesses at 
Rome
 as far as they were able. Then he sa∣lutes 
Aquila
 and 
Priscilla,
 who, though private persons, yet keeping themselves within their calling, had vigorously laboured in propagating the Gospel according to their knowledg, with singular zeal, (as appears, 
Act. 18.
), and it seems, they stood up in defence of the Apostle in some dangerous persecution or tumult, and preserved his life with the hazzard of their own
; upon which account, he tells them, that not only himself was bound to thank them, but all the Churches of the 
Gentiles
 about 
Corinth,
 because the preservation of his life redound∣ed to the profit of them all. He salutes also the Church in their house, that is, all the Christians in their family. He sa∣lutes 
Epinetus,
 who was converted to the Faith among the first in 
Achaia, [see 1 Cor. 16.15].
 He salutes 
Mary,
 who had done many good offices for the faithful, especially the Teachers of the Gospel. He salutes 
Andronicus,
 and 
Junius
 his Kinsmen, who were highly accounted of among the Apo∣postles, and were converted to the Faith before the Apo∣stle himself, being p
ssibly among those who were at first converted by 
Peter;
 and they had also been imprisoned for the sake of the Gospel as well as He, 
[see Col. 4.10.].
 He greets 
Amphias
 whom he dearly loved for the grace of God that appeared in him, and for his holy profession. He s
lutes 
Urbanus
 who seems to be one of the Pastors of the Church at 
Rome,
 and so a fellow-lab
urer with the Apostle in the Gospel. He salutes 
Apelles,
 who shewed himself a faithful and sincere Christian. He salutes the Christians that were in 
Aristobulus
 and 
Nar∣cissus
's house; but the 
Masters
 he passes by, they (as it seems) not being Chri∣stians. He salutes those approved Matrons 
Tryphena,
 and 
Tryphosa,
 and 
Per∣sis,
 who contributed their labours zealously for the promoting of the G
spel, and did many good offices in the Church. He salutes 
Rufus
 a choice
 per∣son for godliness and vertue, wh
se M
ther very much respected 
Paul,
 and was as a Mother to him in love and affection. He salutes some more in particular,

 and others in general, under the Titles of 
Brethren
 and 
Saints.
 He bids them salute one another with a holy kiss, which was among them, (as shaking of hands among us), a sign of mutual love, affection, and concord. He tells them, The Churches among whom he was conversant, who understood his purpose of wri∣ting to them, aluted them. 
From Ver. 1, to 17.


He warns to avoid those who by false Doctrine caused 
divisions,
 and by scan∣dalous Living, 
ffences
 among them. For these, he tells them, serve not the Lord, but themselv
s, and the more simple are easily deceived by their cunning words. And as f
r them, though he had already good experience of their obedience to the G
spel, (which was manifest to the world and in which he greatly rejoiced), yet he thought good to admonish them to continue constant, and prudently to resist con∣trary Doctrines. For as it is not sufficient for a Matron, to have been once chast, except she so continue, so 'tis not sufficient for them to have been once a pure Church, except they keep themselves from false Doctrine and false Worship.


It s
ems, he f
resaw, that if the 
Roman Church
 were once infected with er∣ror, it would be dangerous to other Churches. Therefore he would have them wise in discerning true Doctrine from false, and in sticking to it, neither being cunning
 to sophisticate the truth, nor to propagate error. And though Satan and his instruments will seek to seduce them, and disturb their Church; yet he tells them, that G
d who is both the Lover and Author of peace, will through Christ, give them victory, when they have a while combated against the Devil and his Emissaries. Whereby he seems, either to prophesie of the conversion of the 
Roman
 Empire to the Faith, or that the dissentions raised among them by the subtilty and malice of the Devil and his Instruments shall be quenched; which possibly was partly effected by this Epistle, and partly by the Apostles after-labours among them. He subjoins the saluta∣tions of other Saints with him, to the Christian 
Romans,
 particularly of 
Ti∣mothy
 the Evangelist, 
Tertius
 who wrote this Epistle from his mouth, 
Gaius,
 (
f whom 
Act. 20.4.), Erastus, [see 2 Tim. 4.20.],
 and of 
Quartus.


He concludes this excellent Epistle, with a solemn 
doxology,
 or thanksgiving to God, who is able to establish them in the Faith, according to the Gospel which he had preached, (the great subject whereof is Christ), and according to the Rev
lation of his secret Counsel concerning the Salvation of mankind, which though it w
re in some sort made known in the Old Testament, yet not plainly and fully until this present time; but now by the Commandment of God, and the Spirits clearing the meaning of ancient prophesies, is made known to all Nations, to bring them to submit th
mselves to the Doctrine and Directions of the Gospel: To this only wise G
d he desires all glory and honour should, in and through the media∣tion of Christ Jesus, be for ever ascribed. 
Amen. From Ver. 17, to the end.








SECT. XVII.


THE Apostle intending to go directly from 
Corinth
 into 
Syria,
 to carry the Alms of the 
Macedonian
 and 
Achaian
 Christians to 
Judea;
 he was advertised, that the 
Jews
 (who hated his Doctrine and person, and knew of his purpose) laid wait for him, to intercept the moneys he carried, and possibly to take away his life. Whereupon he thought it best, to re∣turn into 
Macedonia,
 (from whence he came), and from thence to pass into 
Asia. Sopater
 of 
Beroea
 went along with him as far as 
Asia,
 never parting from him; but 
Aristarchus, Secundus, Gaius, Tychicus, Trophimus,
 and 
Timothy,
 (who it seems upon some occasion or other was come unto him from 
Ephesus
), went with him through 
Macedonia,
 and then leaving him, went be∣fore to 
Asia,
 and expected him and his company at 
Troas;
 who accordingly came thither, with 
Luke
 and 
Sopater,
 not long af∣ter from 
Philippi,
 and stayed there seven days. On the eighth day, which was the 
first day
 of the week the Disciples being gathered together to 
break bread,
 and receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, 
Paul
 preached unto them, and being to go away next day continued his exhorta∣tion till midnight. 
Eutichus,
 a young who sate in a window, being surprized with sleep, fell down from the third loft, and was ta∣ken up 
dead
; 
Paul
 falling on him, (in imi∣tation of the Prophets, 
Elijah
 and 
Elisha,
 1 
Kings
 17.21. 
&
 2 
Kings
 4.34.), quickly perceived his Soul (which was departed) through the power of God (on which he believed) restored to him again, and there∣fore bad them not trouble themselves. The Disciples seeing this Miracle, were not a lit∣tle comforted; because not only life was restored to the Youth again, but the Doctrine of the Gospel which 
Paul
 preached, was ex∣ceedingly confirmed thereby.




Act.
 20.3. And there abode three months: and when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return tho∣row Macedonia.


v.
 4. And there accompanied him into Asia, Sopater of Berea: and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus, and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Ti∣motheus: and of Asia, Tychicus, and Trophimus.


v.
 5. These going before, tarried for us at Troas:


v.
 6. And we sailed away from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we abode se∣ven days.


v.
 7. And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came toge∣ther to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow, and continued his speech until midnight.


v.
 8. And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.


v.
 9. And there sat in a window a certain young man, named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep, and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.


v.
 10. And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him, said, Trouble not your selves, for his life is in him.


v.
 11. When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.


v.
 12. And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little com∣forted.










SECT. XVIII.


FRom 
Troas Paul
 went on foot to 
Assos,
 a Sea-port-Town in 
Asia,
 sending his companions by ship thither before him, who when he came thither took him in. Thence they all sail∣ed together to 
Mitylene,
 and the next day arrived at 
Samos,
 and having tarried a little at 
Trogyllium,
 the day following they came to 
Miletus,
 passing by, and not touching at 
Ephesus.
 For the Apostle being desirous to be at 
Jerusalem, at the Feast of Pentecost,
 (that he might in that concourse have a larger oppor∣tunity of spreading the Gospel), would not now call at 
Ephe∣
us,
 lest he should be detained too long by the Brethren there. Wherefore he sent for the Elders of that Church to come to him to 
Miletus.
 They being come, He in a very grave and serious discourse sets before them, in the first place, The up∣rightness of his Conversation, and the faithfulness of his Mini∣stry among them, and how he had behaved himself with all hu∣mility of mind, and had express'd much tenderness of affection to them, and that amidst many hazzards and dangers from the

 
Jews,
 who conspired against his life; that he kept nothing back from them, that he thought useful for them to know; but had both 
publickly
 and 
privately
 preached, both to 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles
 the necessity of 
Repentance,
 and 
Conversion to God,
 and of 
Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
 He tells them, he was now going to 
Jerusalem,
 not undertaking that Journey rashly or inconside∣rately, but being incited to it by the strong impulse of the Spirit of God
. Neither knew he what particu∣lar sufferings the Lord would there call him to undergo, or what would be the issue of them, whether 
life
 or 
death.
 Only this he found, that in every City (through which he passed), those that had the gift of Prophesie, (as many in the Churches had at that time), foretold him, that 
bonds
 and 
afflictions
 did wait for him, and attend him. But none of these things moved him, no not loss of life it self, if he might serve Christ faithfully in the office which he had intrusted him with, and publish his Gospel, wherein the free grace of God is so eminent∣ly manifested. And as for them, his dear friends, (among whom he had so long convers'd, and to whom he had preached the Gospel, by which the Kingdom of God is set up in the hearts of men), he tells them, they were never like to 
see his face
 again. And seeing he had faithfully shewed to them the way to salvation, the fault was not in him if any of them perished, 
see Act.
 18.6. 
Ezek.
 3.18. He then exhorts them, to have a great regard to their Pastoral charge, and to take heed to 
themselves,
 (that their life and conversation be holy and un∣blameable), and to the 
whole flock
 over which the Holy Ghost
, (from whom all faith∣ful Ministers have principally their call and authority
), had made them 
Overseers,
 that they feed the Church of God with sound Doctrine, and give them a good example. Which exhortation he inforceth by two ar∣guments. 1. Because of the inestimable price with which this flock was bought; 
Christ, God-man
 having purchased it with his own blood. 2. Because of the danger that the flock was like to be in, after his departure, partly from 
Wolves
 (that is, false Teachers, or professed persecuting enemies), part∣ly from 
subtil crafty Hereticks,
 who should arise from among themselves. He exhorts them therefore, to be careful, remem∣bring, how for the space of three years he had taken much pains in preaching the Gospel among them, and had with tears, night and day, (as occasion offered it self
), warned them to take heed of such 
seducers,
 and to cleave to the truth. 
Lastly,
 He takes his solemn leave of them, commending them to the pro∣tection and guidance of God, and to the directions delivered in his Gospel, which if they adhered to, he tells them, will be able to instruct and build them up, and bring them to that

 glorious inheritance which God hath provided for all his Saints; the promises whereof may abundantly encourage them in their work In conclusion, he professeth his innocency from that sordid sin of 
Covetousness,
 and appeals to them, whether by his own manual labour he had not maintained himself, and those that were with him, (
see Act.
 18.3.). And thereby he had taught them, that by so labouring as he did, (when the case required it), they should be so far from being chargeable or burdensom to others, that they should support, and relieve the poor and weak in estate; and this much rather, than by exact∣ing wages drive any, that were tenacious, from embracing the Gospel. For according to that saying of our Saviour, (not recorded in the Gospels, though possibly it may be gathered from 
Luk.
 6.38. 
&
 16.9.), 
It is more blessed to give than to receive.
 When he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them, and when he had so done, they with great expressions of sor∣row accompanied him to the ship, being more especially grie∣ved at those words of his, 
That they should see his face no more.
 From Ver. 13, to the end.


Act.
 20. 
v.
 13. And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.


v.
 14. And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.


v.
 15. And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios, and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium: and the next day we came to Miletus.


v.
 16. For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.


v.
 17. And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the Elders of the Church.


v.
 18. And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons.


v.
 19. Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears and temptations, which befel me by the lying in wait of the Jews:


v.
 20. And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publikely, and from house to house.


v.
 21. Testifying both to the Jews and also to the Greeks, repentance to∣wards God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.


v.
 22. And now behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:


v.
 23. Save that the holy Ghost witnesseth in every City, saying, That bonds and afflictions abide me.


v.
 24. But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my self, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the mi∣nistry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testifie the Gospel of the grace of God.


v.
 25. And now behold, I know that ye all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.




v.
 26. Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.


v.
 27. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.


v.
 28. Take heed therefore unto your selves, and to all the flock, over the which the holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.


v.
 29. For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves en∣ter in among you, not sparing the flock.


v.
 30. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.


v.
 31. Therefore watch, and remember that by the space of three years, I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.


v.
 32. And now brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.


v.
 33. I have covered no man silver, or gold, or apparel.


v.
 34. Yea, you your selves know, that these hands have ministred unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.


v.
 35. I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring, ye ought to sup∣port the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give, than to receive.


v.
 36. And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.


v.
 37. And they all wept sore, and fell on Pauls neck, and kissed him,


v.
 38. Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.




















SECT. XIX.


FRom 
Miletus
 they came to 
Coos,
 and the day following to 
Rhodes,
 and from thence to 
Patara,
 a Port Town, and the chief City of 
Lycia,
 and from thence in a ship bound for 
Phoenicia,
 passing by 
Cyprus,
 they came to 
Tyre,
 where finding some 
Disciples,
 they tarried with them seven days. Here 
Paul
 was warned by some of the Christians in this place, (who had the Spirit of Prophecy), of the great dangers and perils that

 attended him, if he went up to 
Jerusalem.
 Wherefore through humane affection, and zeal for his temporal preservation, (see a like example in 
Peter, Mat.
 16.22.), they disswaded him from going thither. But their counsel nothing prevailing with him, and they seeing he was resolv'd to go on, they all of them, with their Wives and Children
, (to testifie their great respect and affection to him), ac∣company him out of the City; and he at his departure from them, 
kneeled
 down on the shore and prayed with them, Then ta∣king ship from 
Tyre,
 they came to 
Ptolemais,
 (a Sea Town of 
Palestine
 in the Tribe of 
Aser,
 formerly called 
Acco, Judg
 1.31. but now thus named from a King in 
Egypt
), where having saluted the Brethren, the next day they came to 
Cesarea-Stratonis,
 (on foot as 'tis pro∣bable), where they stayed many days with 
Philip
 the 
Evangelist
, who was one of the 
Seven Deacons, [Act.
 6.5.], and had four 
Virgin Daughters
 who had the gift of foretelling
 things to come. During their stay here, a certain Prophet call'd 
Agabus,
 (the same probably who, 
chap.
 11.27, 28. foretold the famine that happened in the time of 
Claudius
), came hither from 
Judea;
 and after the manner of the old Prophets, (who often prophesied by Symbols
, and sig∣nificant expressions, that they might the bet∣ter imprint their predictions on the hearts of men), took 
Pauls
 girdle; and bound his own hands and feet with it, declaring, that after that manner the 
Jews
 would bind 
Paul
 at 
Jerusalem,
 and deliver him to the 
Gentiles; viz.
 first to the 
Roman Governour
 of 
Judea,
 and afterwards to 
Nero
 the 
Roman
 Emperor. Hereupon both 
Pauls
 Companions, and the Christians of that place; out of their great affection to him, importun'd him with tears not to go to 
Jerusalem.
 But the Apostle resolving, 
come life
 or 
come death,
 to be obedient to the Call of Gods Spirit, would not be diverted from his intended journey. When they per∣ceived his resolution to be fixed, they desisted from importu∣ning him any further, and submitted to the will of God. Then lading Mules with the goods they had with them, they began their journey from 
Ca sarea
 towards 
Jerusalem.
 And some of the Disciples also of 
Caesarea
 accompanied them, who brought them to one 
Mnason
 of 
Cyprus
 an 
old Disciple,
 (who had long ago received the Faith and now lived as it seems at 
Jerusalem
), with whom they should lodg.




Act.
 21. 
v.
 1. And it came to pass that after we were gotten from them, and had lanched, we came with a straight course unto Choos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara.


v.
 2. And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.


v.
 3. Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.


v.
 4. And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.


v.
 5. And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives, and chil∣dren, till we were out of the City: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.


v.
 6. And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship, and they returned home again.


v.
 7. And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Pto∣lemais, and saluted the Brethren, and abode with them one day.


v.
 8. And the next day, we that were of Pauls company departed, and came unto Cesarea, and we went into the house of Philip the Evange∣list, (which was one of the Seven), and abode with him.


v.
 9. And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did pro∣phesie.


v.
 10. And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judea, a certain Prophet named Agabus.


v.
 11. And when he was come unto us, he took Pauls girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that oweth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.


v.
 12. And when we heard these things, both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.


v.
 13. Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep, and to break mine heart? for I am ready, not to be bound only, but also to dye at Jeru∣salem for the Name of the Lord Jesus.


v.
 14. And when he would not be perswaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.


v.
 15. And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.


v.
 16. There went up with us also certain of the disciples of Cesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodg.














SECT. XX.


VVHen they were come to 
Jerusalem,
 they were very kindly received by the Church there. And the next day, the 
Elders
 being met together in the house of 
James
 the Apostle, the 
Son of Alpheus, (See Mat.
 15.40. 
Gal.
 1.19. 
Act.
 15.13.), 
Paul
 relates to them, what great things the Lord had wrought by his ministry among the 
Gentiles.
 When they heard 
that,
 they glorified God for the great suc∣cess of the Gospel. But then they acquainted him, that seve∣ral of the converted 
Jews,
 (of whom there were many thou∣sands, who, though they had received the Gospel, yet thought the Ceremonial Law must still be observed), were informed concerning him, that he not only permitted the 
Gentile-converts
 to remain uncircumcised, but perswaded the 
Jews
 living among the 
Gentiles,
 (whom he had converted to the Faith), to leave off 
Circumcision,
 and the other Ceremonies of 
Moses
's Law. This therefore they tell him, in all probability, will be the event of this business. The 
Jewish
 Christians will hear of his being come thither, and so will come in multitudes, to see how he behaves himself in that matter, and will expect some satisfacti∣on from him therein. Therefore they advised him, that seeing there were 
four men
 there present, who having had a 
Naza∣rites Vow
 upon them, which being now accomplish'd, (
see Act.
 18.18.), were to perform the Ceremonies prescribed, 
Numb.
 6.13, 
to
 22. that he on this occasion would join himself to them, and perform those Ceremonies and Rites with them, and make provision of such Sacrifices for them as the Law injoins, that so being now freed from their Vow, they may shave their heads; and by this means the 
believing Jews
 will be perswaded that they had heard false reports of him, and that he did still ob∣serve the 
Mosaical
 Rites. As for the 
believing Gentiles
, (they tell him), they had made a decree, (which they had sent to 
Antioch
 by him and 
Barnabas, Act.
 15.), by which they de∣clared that 
they
 are not required to observe any such Rites, or any more than those 
four Precepts,
 viz. To 
abstain from things offered to Idols, from Blood, from things strangled, and from Fornication. Paul
 hearing this, took their advice, and thought fit thus far to com∣ply with the 
Judaizing
 Christians; and ac∣cordingly performing all things belonging to the purifying of the 
Nazarites.
 He went into the Temple
 with those 
four men,
 and declared unto the Priests, that the time of their Vow was expired, and therefore according to the Law, they were to offer an offering for each person, as in that case is

 prescribed. And when the seven days wherein those Sacrifices were to be offer∣ed, were almost at an end, divers 
unbe∣lieving Jews,
 that dwelt in 
Asia,
 being now come to 
Jerusalem;
 as soon as they saw 
Paul
 in the Temple, they brought in the multitude tumultuously upon him, and ap∣prehended him, crying out of him, as a person that taught Doctrines derogatory to the prerogative of the 
Jewish Nation,
 namely, in that he taught, that the partition-wall between 
Jew
 and 
Gentile
 was broken down; also, that the 
Ceremonial Law
 must be abolished, and that a sinner is not justified by the works of the Law; and that the typical Ceremonies which pre-figured Christ were not to be continued now Christ was come in the flesh; and further, that he did inculcate the predictions of Christ concerning the destruction of the 
City
 and 
Temple
 of 
Jerusalem,
 according to 
Mat.
 23.37, 38. & 
Luk.
 19.43, 44. And because they saw 
Trophimus
 with him in the City, who was a 
Gentile-Christian
), they confidently, but 
untruly
 aver∣red, that he carried him into the Temple: which they held a pollution and profanation of it. The people being hereupon exasperated, they laid hands on him, and haled him violently out of the Court of the Temple; and the Priests seeing this, presently shut the doors of the Temple, lest possibly he should run into it again, and lay hold on the Horns of the Altar, and so take Sanctuary, (from which they could not take him, as we read 
Adonijah
 and 
Joab
 once did, 1 
King.
 1.50. & 2.28. Then they fell a beating of him, and had like to have killed him, had he not been rescued by the chief Officer of the 
Ro∣man
 Souldiers, (who kept Garrison there to prevent Tu∣mults), who taking him out of their hands, and supposing him to be some great 
Malefactor,
 commanded him to be bound with two Chains, possibly putting one on his hands, the other on his feet, as 
Agabus
 had foretold, 
v.
 11,
. And not being able to understand from the confused multitude, what his 
particular crime
 was, (some saying one thing, some another), he commanded he should be brought into the 
Fort
 or 
Castle,
 call'd 
Arx Antonia,
 which was their Garri∣son. And as they were going up the stairs to the Castle, the rage of the multitude was so great, that the Souldiers were fain to carry 
Paul
 in their arms, to secure him from violence. When he was come to the Castle gate, he desired the 
Colonel
 that he would please to permit him to speak unto him. The 
Colonel
 wondred he spak
 
Greek,
 and thereupon thought he had been that 
Egyptian false Prophet,
 that had raised a Sedition in 
Judea
 about Three years before, under the government of 
Faelix,
 and had gotten to him about four thousand followers in the wilder∣ness, 
vid. Joseph. Antiq. lib.
 20. 
ch.
 6, 7. 
Paul
 tells him, he was a 
Jew,
 born at 
Tarsus,
 the Metroplis of 
Cilicia,
 and therefore

 desired liberty to speak to the people; which the 
Colonel
 per∣mitting, 
Paul
 standing on the stairs, near the gate of the Ca∣stle, made a sign to the people to hold their peace, and give audience; and then began to make his Apology to them in the 
Hebrew
 tongue, which procured him the more ready attention from them.


Act.
 21. 
v.
 17. And when we were come to Jerusalem, the Brethren re∣ceived us gladly.


v.
 18. And the day following Paul went in with us unto James, and all the elders were present.


v.
 19. And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministery.


v.
 20. And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe, and they are all zealous of the Law.


v.
 21. And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles, to forsake Moses, saying, That they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the cu∣stoms.


v.
 22. What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.


v.
 23. Do therefore this that we say unto thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;


v.
 24. Them take, and purifie thy self with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads; and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning him thee, are nothing, but that thou thy self walkest orderly, and keepest the Law.


v.
 25. As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and con∣cluded, that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep them∣selves from things offered to Idols, and from blood, and from strang∣led, and from fornication.


v.
 26. Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them, entred into the Temple, to signifie the accomplishment of the days of purification, untill that an offering should be offered for every one of them.


v.
 27. And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the Temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,


v.
 28. Crying out, Men of Israel, help: this is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the Law, and this place: and farther brought Greeks also into the Temple, and hath polluted this holy place.


v.
 29. (For they had seen before with him in the City, Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the Tem∣ple.)


v.
 30. And all the City was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the Temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.


v▪
 31. And as they went about to kill him, tidings came to the chief Cap∣tain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.


v.
 32. Who immediately took Souldiers, and Centurions, and ran down

 unto them: and when they saw the chief Captain and the Souldiers, they left beating of Paul.


v.
 33. Then the chief Captain came neer, and took him, and command∣ed him to be bound with two chains, and demanded who he was, and what he had done.


v.
 34. And some cryed one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he command∣ed him to be carried into the Castle.


v.
 35. And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was born of the Souldiers for the violence of the people.


v.
 36. For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.


v.
 37. And as Paul was to be led into the Castle, he said unto the chief Captain, May I speak unto thee? who said, Canst thou speak Greek?


v.
 38. Art not thou that Egyptian which before those days madest an up∣roar, and leddest in the wilderness four thousand men that were mur∣derers?


v.
 39. But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew, of Tarsus, a City in Cilicia, a Citizen of no mean City: and I beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the people.


v.
 40. And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckned with his hand unto the people: and when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying.


































SECT. XXI.


THE Apostle now beginning to make his defence to the people, He first sets before them what manner of per∣son he was 
before his conversion.
 He was a 
Jew
 by extraction, born in the noble City of 
Tarsus,
 educated at 
Jerusalem,
 under that famous Doctor of the Law 
Gamaliel,
 (a man of great esteem among them; 
see Act.
 5.34.), being perfectly instructed by him in the 
Law of the Fathers
, and imbued with the strictest Judaical Principles, and was a great Zelot for 
that way,
 and a bitter enemy to Christianity. And he tells them, that all the 
Senate,
 or 
Sanhedrim,
 es∣pecially the 
high Priest,
 could attest the truth of what he said; for, from them he received commission to apprehend all such Christians, as he could find in 
Syria,
 and to bring them bound to them to 
Jerusalem
 to be scourged, or otherwise punished. 2ly, He declares to them the manner of his conversion
, [
see Chap.
 2. 
Sect.
 1.], how travelling to 
Damas∣cus
 to pursue his persecuting design, when he was come nigh to that City, a great light from Heaven shon round about him; upon which he fell to the ground, and heard these words 
articulately
 spoken to him by Christ
, 
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
 And they that were with him heard a voice indeed [
ch.
 9.7.], (as the people did, 
Joh.
 12.19. when 
some
 said it thundred, 
others
 said an Angel spake), but understood not 
distinctly
 what was said. He further declares how Christ told him, he had provided one 
Ana∣nias
 to come unto him, and to shew him what he had designed for him 
to do,
 and 
suffer,
 for his Name sake. And thus being blinded by the brightness of the glory that shone a∣bout him, he was led by those that were with him to 
Damascus,
 and there by the Ministry of 
Ananias
 he recovered his sight. 
Ananias
 also shewed him, how God had chosen him, that he should 
know his will,
 and have the

 
Gospel
 revealed to him, and should 
see Jesus,
 and hear him speak to him from heaven, and should make known to all men
, the things which Jesus had already and should further make known to him. 
Ananias
 also having further instructed him, exhorted him to be 
baptized,
 and by Faith in Christs blood to wash away the guilt of all his sins, (of which Baptism is a sign and seal), and earnestly to implore grace from Christ, to sanctifie his na∣ture more and more. 
Paul
 having thus open∣ed to them the 
manner
 of his Conversion and 
Call,
 to be an Apostle; he now further shews them, how at his first coming to 
Jerusalem
 after this, (
see ch.
 9.26.), as he was in the Temple
 praying, he fell into an 
Exsta∣sie
 or 
Trance,
 and in that 
Exstatical Vision
 saw Christ, who commanded him to get him spee∣dily out of that City, because his 
former zeal
 against the Gospel, would hinder his preach∣ing of it 
now
 from being successfull. Against this, he humbly argued, that his former zeal against Christianity, (which was so remark∣able and notorious, by his imprisoning the Professors thereof, and causing them to be scourged in the Consistories of many Cities, and by his assisting in the stoning of 
Steven,
 and keeping the Garments of his accusers whilst they slew him) might be an argument to the 
Jews,
 that they were very 
great
 and 
cogent
 reasons, that had wrought such a strange change in him; and so he might in all likelyhood, be a fitter person to publish the Doctrine of Christ 
now,
 by how much the more he had opposed it formerly, [
see Sect.
 3. of 
Chap.
 2.]. But this did not pre∣vail for his staying at 
Jerusalem,
 but Christ commanded him to depart from thence, tel∣ling him he would send him to preach to the 
Gentiles,
 who had not that exception against him, and would more readily receive his Do∣ctrine. Hitherto the 
Jews
 had patience to hear him, but when he mentioned the 
Gentiles,
 and that he was appointed to preach to them, they cried out, he 
was a Villain,
 and 
unworthy to live,
 and expressing their fury by throwing dust into the air, and casting off their Clothes as if they would presently stone him, the 
chief Commander
 of the Guard, bid the Soldiers carry him into the 
Castle,
 and com∣manded, that he should be scourged till he should confess what he had done, that had so enraged the 
Jews
 against him. As

 they were going about to bind him, in order to the scourging of him, the Apostle declares himself a 
free-born Denizon of Rome,
 whom the Roman Laws would not permit to be so dealt with, before any sentence was legally passed upon him. When they heard this, they ceased from their design of scourging him; and the 
Colonel
 (who had himself purchased the freedom of a 
Citi∣zen
 of 
Rome
 at a great rate) was afraid he had already done more than he could well answer, in binding him, and putting Chains upon him.


Act.
 22. 
v.
 1. Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you.


v.
 2. (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence; and he saith)


v.
 3. I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a City in Cili∣cia, yet brought up in this City at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the Law of the fathers, and was zealous towards God, as ye all are this day.


v.
 4. And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women,


v.
 5. As also the high Priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring them which were there, bound unto Jerusa∣lem, for to be punished.


v.
 6. And it came to pass, that as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.


v.
 7. And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?


v.
 8. And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? and he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth whom thou persecutest.


v.
 9. And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.


v.
 10. And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus, and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.


v.
 11. And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus:


v.
 12. And one Ananias, a devout man according to the Law, having a good report of all the Jews, which dwelt there,


v.
 13. Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, re∣ceive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.


v.
 14. And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldst know his will, and see that just One, and shouldst hear the voice of his mouth.


v.
 15. For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.


v.
 16. And now, why tarriest thou? Arise, and be baptized, and wash a∣way thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.


v.
 17. And it came to pass, that when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the Temple, I was in a trance,


v.
 18. And saw him saying unto me, Make haste and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concern∣ing me.


v.
 19. And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee.




v.
 20. And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.


v.
 21. And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.


v.
 22. And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lift up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.


v.
 23. And as they cryed out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air.


v.
 24. The chief Captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging: that he might know wherefore they cryed so against him.


v.
 25. And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?


v.
 26. When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief Cap∣tain, saying, Take heed what thou dost, for this man is a Roman.


v.
 27. Then the chief Captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.


v.
 28. And the chief Captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free-born.


v.
 29. Then straitway they departed from him which should have exami∣ned him: and the chief Captain also was afraid after he knew that he was a Roman: and because he had bound him.




















SECT. XXII.


THE next day 
Claudius Lysias
 the 
Colonel,
 being desirous to know the bottom of the business, called the 
Sanhedrim
 or 
Senate
 of the 
Jews,
 and brought out 
Paul
 to them, to see what they could object against him. The Apostle beginning to speak for himself, declares that both during his continuance in the 
Jewish
 religion, and since his conversion to Christianity, he had walked uprightly according to his knowledg, and the light of his Conscience
. 
Ananias
 the 
high Priest
 being impatient to hear this, com∣manded those that stood nigh him to smite him on the mouth. 
Paul
 hereupon freely reproves him for his injustice, calling him 
whited wall
, or 
Hypocrite,
 who sitting there as a Magistrate to judg according to Law, yet openly transgress'd the Law him∣self, by commanding an 
innocent person, un∣heard,
 and 
uncondemned
 to be smitten. 
See Deut.
 25.1, 2. He also boldly denounces Gods judgments
 against him for it, [
see
 2 
Tim.
 4.14.]. The 
standers by
 reprove 
Paul
 for this, as one that spake contumelious words against 
Gods high Priest.
 The Apostle replies, he did not 
know him,
 nor 
acknow∣ledg
 him to be a lawful high Priest or an 
High Priest
 of Gods appointing, but look'd upon him as an usurper, and one brought in by the sinister practices, and corrupti∣ons of that time; and therefore he might be reprehended for his faults without break∣ing Gods command, 
Exod.
 22.28. Besides he could not 
own
 any man, to be a lawful high Priest now, seeing 
that Function
 was disannull'd, by the coming of the great High Priest Jesus, who had accomplished all that was typifyed thereby. However though he had spoken nothing but what was just, yet because to the standers by, it had a 
shew of reviling,
 therefore he declares, he should have avoided this also, had he 
known
 him to be, or could have 
acknowledged
 him to be, a 
lawful High Priest.
 The Apostle now dis∣cerning the 
Sanhedrim
 to consist partly of 
Pharisees
 (who be∣lieve the resurrection of the body, and another life after this, and the real subsistence of Angels, and the Souls and Spirits of men separated from their bodies
, 
&c.
) and partly of 
Sad∣duces,
 (who deny all this), out of a prudent policy declares himself, (as to those points) to adhere to the 
Sect of the Pha∣risees,


 and to be fully of their opinion. And though there were more points in question, yet he shews, that 
for holding of these,
 the 
Sadduces
 chiefly hated and persecuted him. Here∣upon there grew a 
heat
 and 
division
 between these two parties, the 
Doctors of the Law,
 (which were generally 
Pharisees
), ta∣king his part, and pleading, that 'twas possible he might have had some extraordinary revelation by an Angel or Spirit, and therefore 'twould not become them to resist his Doctrine, lest, if it were truly revealed to him from God, they should by opposing it, fight against God himself. These two parties growing thus 
hot
 one against another, the 
Colonel
 to prevent further violence and tumult, commanded the Soldiers to take 
Paul
 away from among them, and to bring him into the Ca∣stle. The night following, the Lord appeared to the Apo∣stle in a Vision to comfort and encourage him, and told him, that as he had preached his Gospel, and defended it at 
Jeru∣salem,
 so he should do at 
Rome
 also.


Act.
 22. 
v.
 30. On the morrow, because he would have known the cer∣tainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their Council to ap∣pear; and brought Paul down, and set him before them.


Act.
 23. 
v.
 1. And Paul earnestly beholding the Council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good Conscience before God untill this day.


v.
 2. And the high Priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.


v.
 3. Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judg me after the Law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the Law.


v.
 4. And they that stood by, said, Revilest thou Gods high Priest?


v.
 5. Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high Priest? For it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy peo∣ple.


v.
 6. But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadduces, and the other Pharisees, he cryed out in the Council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.


v.
 7. And when he had so said, there arose a dissention between the Pha∣risees and the Sadduces: and the multitude was divided.


v.
 8. For the Sadduces say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.


v.
 9. And there arose a great cry: and the Scribes that were of the Pharisees part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit, or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.


v.
 10. And when there arose a great dissention, the chief Captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the Soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the Castle.


v.
 11 And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
























SECT. XXIII.


THE Apostle had soon a notable experience of Gods gra∣cious protection over him, promised unto him in that forementioned Vision. For early the very next morning above 
Forty Jews
 combin'd together, and bound themselves by an 
Oath,
 and by a 
Curse
 and execration on themselves that they would neither 
eat
 nor 
drink
 till they had killed him. And they came to the chief Priests and Elders being confident of their assistance, and acquainted them with what they had re∣solved on, and perswaded them to intreat the 
Colonel,
 that he would bring 
Paul
 down on the morrow to them, that they might further examine him, and by the way, before he could come at the Council, they resolv'd to kill him. This conspi∣racy, by the wonderful providence of God, coming to the knowledg of a 
Nephew
 of 
Pauls,
 he is by him acquainted there∣with, who thereupon desired one of the Captains of the Guard, to bring that 
young man
 to 
Lysias
 their chief Commander: which being done he acquainted him with this wicked conspiracy a∣gainst the life of his Uncle. Hereupon the 
Colonel
 presently gave order that a Guard both of Horse and Foot should be made ready against Nine of the Clock that night, and a Horse or Mule provided for 
Paul
 to ride on, and that they should convey him safe to 
Felix
 the 
Procurator
 or 
Governour
 of 
Judea,
 under the 
Roman
 Emperor, who had his ordinary residence at 
Caesarea.
 And he wrote a Letter to the Governour concerning the Prisoner, to this sense, 
viz.
 That he found nothing brought against him, that was punishable either with 
death
 or 
bonds
 by

 the 
Roman
 Laws, and Imperial Constitutions; (for the 
Romans
 had not as yet set out any decrees against the Christians) and therefore he had rescued him out of the hands of the 
Jews,
 who had treacherously conspired against his life, and had given or∣der to his accusers to appear before 
his Excellency,
 and there to implead him. 
Felix
 when he had read the Letter, command∣ed 
Paul
 should be secured in the Hall call'd 
Herods Hall,
 and wen his Accusers were come, he said, he would hear him.


Act.
 23. 
v.
 12. And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bounded themselves under a curse, saying, That they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.


v.
 13. And they were more than forty which had made this conspi∣racy.


v.
 14. And they came to the chief Priests, and Elders, and said, We have bound our selves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing untill we have slain Paul.


v.
 15. Now therefore ye, with the Council, signifie to the chief Captain, that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would en∣quire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come neer, are ready to kill him.


v.
 16. And when Pauls sisters son heard of their laying in wait, he went and entred into the Castle, and told Paul.


v.
 17. Then Paul called one of the Centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief Captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.


v.
 18. So he took him, and brought him to the chief Captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.


v.
 19. Then the chief Captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?


v.
 20. And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee, that thou wouldst bring down Paul to morrow into the Council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.


v.
 21. But do not thou yeild unto them, for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.


v.
 22. So the chief Captain let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man, that thou hast shewed these things to me.


v.
 23. And he called unto him two Centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred Soldiers to go to Cesarea, and horsmen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night:


v.
 24. And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe to Felix the Governour.


v.
 25. And he wrote a Letter after this manner,


v.
 26. Claudius Lysias, unto the most excellent Governor Felix, sendeth greeting.


v.
 27. This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: Then came I with an army, and rescued him, having under∣stood that he was a Roman.


v.
 28. And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their Councell.


v.
 29. Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their Law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death, or of bonds.




v.
 30. And when it was told me, how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straitway to thee, and gave commandment to his accu∣sers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.


v.
 31. Then the Soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.


v.
 32. On the morrow they left the horsmen to go with him, and re∣turned to the Castle.


v.
 33. Who when they came to Cesarea, and delivered the epistle to the Governour, presented Paul also before him.


v.
 34. And when the Governour had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia:


v.
 35. I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herods judgment hall.






SECT. XXIV.


FIve days after, the 
High Priest
 and the 
Elders
 appear,
 with 
Tertullus
 their Advocate, before 
Fe∣lix
 at 
Cesarea;
 who sitting in judgment to hear the matter, their 
said Advocate
 after an insinuating preface to propitiate the Go∣vernour, (wherein he magnified his prudence and care for the good of their Nation), ac∣cuses 
Paul
 of 
three
 things, namely, of 
Sedi∣tion, Heresie,
 and 
Profanation of the Temple, [see Act.
 21.28.]; acquainting him, that they intended to have proceeded against him in their own 
Court,
 and to have judged him there according to their Law, but were pre∣vented by 
Colonel Lysias,
 who took him out of their hands, and forced 
them,
 (who ought to have been his 
Judges
), to come and im∣plead him before 
his Excellency.
 And those 
Jews
 whom they had brought with them for witnesses, attested this charge, saying, 
That those things were so.


Paul
 having now liberty given him to make his defence, he in the first place declares, how much it comforted him, that he was to answer before a 
Person
 whose long experience in govern∣ing the 
Jewish
 Nation, had furnished him with skill and abili∣ty to judg the more equally of such things as were now brought before him. Then he answers particularly to the 
three pretend∣ed Crimes
 laid to his charge. 1. For that of 
Sedition,
 he clears himself from it, by shewing, that there were but Twelve days since he came up to 
Jerusalem;
 and one end, among others, of his coming thither was, to declare himself a sincere wor∣shipper of the true God. Now these Twelve days were thus spent. The day after he came thither, he visited 
James,
 and the Bre∣thren, who perswaded him to purifie himself with 
those four men
 who had a Vow on them, [as we have seen 
Sect.
 20. of this Chapter], which he consenting to do, and the day fol∣lowing,

 (
viz.
 on the third day, which was towards the end of the Feast, 
see ch.
 21. 
v.
 27.), entring into the Temple to perform those, the 
Jews
 there took him, but he was rescued out of their hands by Colonel 
Lysi
s.
 The day after being the fourth day, he pleaded his cause before the Council, [
Act.
 23.]. On the fifth day, the 
Jews
 conspired to take away his life, 
Act.
 23.12. That night the Colonel sent him to 
Antipa∣tris,
 whither he came on the sixth day in the evening. The next day being the seventh, he came to 
Caesarea,
 where he had been now a Prisoner 
five days.
 So that having been so many of those days in the hands of the 
Romans,
 it was not imagina∣ble he could raise (if he had had a mind to it) any such Se∣dition, or tumult at 
Jerusalem
 as the 
Jews
 pretended, and char∣ged him with. Nay the contrary was very evident; for he had behaved himself very quietly, neither could any of them prove that he had raised any disturbance, either in the 
Temple,
 or in any of the 
Synagogues,
 or in the City whilst he was there. As to their 
second charge, viz.
 that of 
Heresie,
 he plainly con∣fesses▪ 
that after the way which they call'd Heresie, so he worship∣ped the God of his Fathers.
 For that way of worshipping the God of 
Abraham
 which Christ had taught, and the Christians now practised, was the way that he did use: yet therein neither he nor they set up any new Religion quite contrary to what was before owned and professed, but had the 
same Faith
 for substance, that the 
Patriarchs
 and 
Prophets
 had before them. And in particular, he declares, that he believed the Doctrine of the 
Resurrection,
 which the more prudent part of his Ad∣versaries, 
viz.
 those of the 
Pharisees,
 professed to believe also. And this 
firm belief of a resurrection, and a day of judgment
 en∣gaged him to endeavour always to 
keep a good Conscience to∣wards God and man.
 For the 
hird
 thing charged against him, 
viz.
 the 
Profanation of the Temple;
 he shews, he had not been of a long time at 
Jerusalem,
 before this, and now he came to bring Alms to the poor 
Jews
 there, that were converted to Christianity. He acknowledges indeed, that he went into the Temple at this time, but with no intent to profane it, but to perform t
se Rites therein, which the Law of the 
Jews
 requi∣red of such as had the 
Vow
 of the 
Nazarites
 upon them; which some 
Asian Jews
 not understanding, but misapprehending his intent, affi
ed, that he carried 
Trophimus
 a 
Gentile
 of 
Ephe∣sus
 into the Temple. But this was utterly false, neither was there any the least ground for it, but only this, that 
Trophi∣mus
 had been seen with him in the City, 
see Act.
 21.29. As for his being in the Temple, he acknowledges, he was there, but not with any such company as could be thought to profane it, or that could bring him under suspition of any intent to raise a Sedition. And for t
e truth of these things he appeals to those t
re present of their own 
Sanhedrim;
 and desires them to 
s
fie, whether w
n 
e was brought before them, he was not dismissed with this testimony from themselves
,

 that there was nothing of moment charged against him, except (which only the 
Sadduces
 will charge him with) that he pro∣fessed to believe the 
Resurrection of the dead,
 and 
Another life after this.


When 
Felix
 discerned how things went, he would not pass any sentence for the present in this case, but put them off say∣ing, When I know more exactly the things that belong 
to this way, (viz.
 whether the Christian Religion be deroga∣tory to the Law of the 
Jews
), and when 
Lysias
 the Comman∣der comes down (whose testimony will decide that matter con∣cerning the tumult), I will determine the business between you. But for the present he commanded the Captain of the Guard to keep 
Paul
 safe, though 
in free custody,
 so that any of his friends or acquaintants might have liberty to visit him.


Act.
 24. 
v.
 1. And after five days Ananias the high Priest descended with the elders, and with a certain Orator named Tertullus, who informed the Governour against Paul.


v.
 2. And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, say∣ing, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very wor∣thy deeds are done unto this Nation by thy providence:


v.
 3. We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.


v.
 4. Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee, that thou wouldst hear us of thy clemency a few words.


v.
 5. For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedi∣tion among all the Jews thorowout the world, and a ring-leader of the sect of the Nazarens.


v.
 6. Who also hath gone about to profane the Temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our Law.


v.
 7. But the chief Captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands:


v.
 8. Commanding his accusers to come unto thee, by examining of whom thy self mayest take knowledg of all these things, whereof we accuse him.


v.
 9. And the Jews also assented, saying, That these things were so.


v.
 10. Then Paul, after that the Governour had beckned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a Judg unto this Nation, I do the more chearfully answer for my self:


v.
 11. Because that thou mayest understand, that there are but yet twelve days, since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.


v
 12. And they neither found me in the Temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues, nor in the City.


v.
 13. Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.


v.
 14. But this confess I unto thee, that after the way which they call heresie, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets.


v.
 15. And have hope towards God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and un∣just.


v.
 16. And herein do I ex
rcise my self, to have always a Conscience void of offence toward God, and towards men.




v.
 17. Now after many years, I came to bring alms to my Nation, and offerings:


v.
 18. Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the Tem∣ple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.


v.
 19. Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.


v.
 20. Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the Council,


v.
 21. Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.


22. And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledg of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief Cap∣tain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.


v.
 23. And he commanded a Centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister, or come unto him.












SECT. XXV.


SOME time after, 
Felix
 and his Wife 
Drusilla,
 (who was a 
Jewesse,
 and Sister of that 
Herod Agrippa
 who killed 
James,
 and imprisoned 
Peter, Act.
 12.), sent for 
Paul,
 and were wil∣ling to hear him discourse concerning the Doctrine of Christ. He applying himself to speak pertinently to 
Felix,
 insisted on those 
great duties
 which Christ injoins all men to observe, if they intend to be saved, 
viz. Justice
 between▪ man and man, 
Temperance,
 and 
Chastity; Virtues
 that were contrary to those Vices, that 
Felix
 was particularly guilty of. And withall, he dis∣courses of the 
last Judgment,
 at which all impenitent persons shall be punished for all their crimes and offences, either in these or other kinds. As the Apostle was pressing this Doctrine, 
Fe∣lix
 finding himself so much concern'd, fell a trembling, and not liking to hear such close and rousing Doctrine, he dismiss'd 
Paul
 for the present, and told him he would take some other time to hear him again. But being a corrupt Governour, and a taker of bribes, he hoped the Apostle would have given him some considerable bribe, to set him at liberty; and in expe∣ctation thereof sent for him, and talked with him the oftner. But after he had kept him Prisoner for the space of two years, he himself was by 
Nero
 removed from his place, and 
Portius Festus
 was sent to succeed him in the Government. And though 
Felix
 had nothing to charge 
Paul
 with, yet to gratifie the 
Jews,


 after so many injuries which he had done them, and to pacifie them, that they might not follow him with complaints to the Emperour, he left 
Paul
 in prison.


Act.
 24. 
v.
 24. And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jew, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.


v.
 25. And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time, when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.


v.
 26. He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftner, and com∣muned with him.


v.
 27. But after two years Portius Festus came into Felix room: and Fe∣lix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.








SECT. XXVI.


FEstus
 being come to the Government,
 and going up to 
Je∣rusalem,
 the 
High Priest
 and 
Rulers
 of the 
Jews
 quickly began to inform him against 
Paul,
 and besought him that he might be sent for thither, to answer for himself before his Ex∣cellency there, intending to lay some Villains by the way to kill him as he came. But 
Festus
 (the divine providence so over∣ruling him) would not consent to that, but ordered that the 
chief Priests,
 and the rest in authority among them, should come to 
Cesarea,
 and accuse him, whither he intended after a short stay at 
Jerusalem
 to go. And accordingly after a few days he went down to 
Cesarea;
 whither being come, soon after his arrival there, he sate on his Judgment Seat, and command∣ed 
Paul
 to be brought before him. The 
Jews
 now bring in such a kind of charge against him as they did before, namely, that 
he had offended against the Mosaical Law; that he had pro∣faned the Temple;
 and 
that he had raised Sedition against the Roman gove
nment.
 But none of these things could they prove against him, so that 
Paul
 easily cleared himself of them all. However, 
Festus
 being willing to gratifie the 
Jews,
 ask'd 
Paul
 if he would go to 
Jerusalem,
 and be tryed there in the 
Jewish Court
 about these matters. The Apostle perceiving that the Governour inclin'd to send him to 
Jerusalem,
 (which course might have expos'd him to extreme hazzards), he tells him, that he was his prisoner, and that 
his Excellency
 was his 
pro∣per Judg;
 under the 
Roman Emperor,
 and not the 
Jews,
 (whom he had not wronged), and therefore it would be a piece of high injustice, to deliver him up to his enemies to be his Judges. Moreover, he tells him, that he was a 
Roman,
 and therefore might claim the priviledg of a 
Roman,
 which accordingly he

 now did, and 
appealed unto Caesar
. 
Festus
 hearing this, (af∣ter he had consulted with his Councel), admitted 
his appeal,
 and told him he should accordingly go to 
Caesar.


Act.
 25. 
v.
 1. Now when Festus was come into the Province, after three days he ascended from Cesarea to Jerusalem.


v.
 2. Then the high Priest, and the chief of the Jews informed him a∣gainst Paul, and besought him.


v.
 3. And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Je∣rusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.


v.
 4. But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Cesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.


v.
 5. Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.


v.
 6. And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Cesarea, and the next day sitting in the judgment seat, commanded Paul to be brought.


v.
 7. And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusa∣lem, stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.


v.
 8. While he answered for himself, neither against the Law of the Jews, neither against the Temple, nor yet against Cesar, have I offended any thing at all.


v.
 9. But Festus willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?


v.
 10. Then said Paul, I stand at Cesars judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.


v.
 11. For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things where∣of these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal un∣to Cesar.


v.
 12. Then Festus, when he had conferred with the Councel, answer∣ed, Hast thou appealed unto Cesar? unto Cesar shalt thou go.








SECT. XXVII.


SOME days after, 
King Agrippa,
 (Son of that 
Herod
 who slew 
James, Act.
 12. who was King, not of 
Judea,
 but some neighbouring Province which the 
Romans
 had given him), and 
Bernice
 his Sister, came to 
Cesarea,
 to salute the new Governour. 
Festus
 relates to them 
Pauls
 case, and acquaints them, how vehemently the 
Jews
 accused him, and how earnest∣ly they desired to have had judgment against him. But he told them, he could not do it by the 
Roman Laws,
 without first hearing the cause, and bringing the 
accusers
 and 
accused
 face to face. This therefore he had done, and upon hearing of both parties, He found 
Paul
 absolutely free from all capital Crimes; and the differences between him, and the 
Jews,
 he saw, were about matters appertaining to 
their Religion,
 (which he contemptuously calls Superstition), in which he acknow∣ledges, he himself h
d little skill, and therefore had a mind to have referr'd him to the 
Jewish Sanhedrim,
 to be judged there. But the Prisoner declin'd their judgment, and 
appealed to Caesar.
 Whereupon he had remanded him to Prison, till he could conveniently send him to the Emperor at 
Rome. Agrippa
 (who was born and bred among the 
Jews,
 and in probabili∣ty understood something concerning the Christian Religion) hearing this, desired that he himself might see 
Paul,
 and hear him speak for himself. 
Festus
 readily agrees hereunto. On the morrow therefore, the Governour, with 
Agrippa,
 and 
Bernice,
 and several other persons of quality, entred the Court and place of hearing 
with great pomp;
 and 
Paul
 was brought forth before them. 
Festus
 having made a short speech, wherein he shewed the occasion of their meeting, and wherefore he had brought forth the Prisoner before that illustrious Assembly. 
Agrippa
 told him he was permitted to speak for himself. Then 
Paul
 beckning with his hand to the standers by to hold their peace, and give Audience, he particularly addresses his speech to 
Agrippa
.


And first, he declares how happy he accounted himself, that he was allowed to speak for himself before 
King Agrippa,
 whom he knew to be well skill'd in the 
Law,
 and in the 
Scriptures,
 and in all the Questions and Customs of the 
Jewish
 Religion. Then he shews, that however the 
Jews
 reproached him, neither in his 
Life,
 nor in his 
Doctrine,
 was there any thing repugnant to the truth of the 
Jewish
 Religion. For the 
manner of his Life,
 he appeals to his Accusers own Consciences, (to whom his

 Conversation from his Youth was well known); who were able to testifie, that he not only had lived 
honestly,
 but 
religi∣ously
, and was of that Sect, which is accounted the strictest of all the rest in the 
Jewish
 Religion, to wit, a 
Pharisee.
 For 
his Doctrine
 which he asserted, 
viz.
 the 
resurrection of the dead,
 he shews, it was a Doctrine acknowledged by the 
Pha∣risees,
 and a 
fundamental Promise
 made by God of old unto their Fathers, and ge∣nerally depended on by the most pious a∣mong all the 
twelve Tribes
 of the 
Jews,
 not only that dwell in 
Judea,
 but that are scattered upon the face of the whole Earth, (
see Jam.
 1.1.): And in contem∣plation, and intuition thereof, they desire continually and fervently to serve the Lord, hoping to attain that 
blessed Resur∣rection,
 and 
Eternal Life,
 through the me∣diation of the blessed 
Messias,
 of old pro∣mised to them. And yet for 
believing,
 and 
expecting,
 and 
prea∣ching
 this, he tells the King, he was accused of the 
Jews.


Then he removes an Objection which might be made against him, 
viz.
 If he were brought up a 
Pharisee,
 how came he to 
believe in Jesus of Nazareth,
 and to hope for a Resurrection by him. Surely the 
Pharisees
 never taught him so. To this he answers, He was once as great and sharp an Adversary to Christ, and all that believed in him, as any man whatsoever; and thought himself bound in Conscience to endeavour the suppression of all those that owned him; which accordingly he did, being a principal Actor in the imprisoning of several of them at 
Jerusalem.
 And when some of them were by the 
Jews,
 tumultuously condemned to die, (as particularly 
Steven, Act. ch.
 7.57, 58.), he was an approver of the sentence, 
Act.
 8.1. And in other Cities besides 
Jerusalem,
 he brought them into the 
Jewish
 Courts, and Consistories, (which were kept in their Synagogues), and with threatnings and tortures compelled them to deny Christ, and (being exceedingly fierce against them) he forced some of them to fly to 
heathen Cities,
 and then pursued them thither also. He further declares, that as he was going to 
Damascus,
 with authority from the 
Sanhedrim
 on this persecuting design, at mid-day a light from Heaven, above the brightness of the Sun, shone round about him, and those that were with him; and when they were all fallen prostrate on the Earth, he heard a voice speaking to him in the 
Hebrew
 tongue; 
Saul, Saul, why dost thou thus persecute me? 'Tis hard for thee to kick against the pricks. But arise, stand upon thy feet, for thou art chosen by me to be a Preacher of the Gospel, and to proclaim unto others, what thou hast now, and shalt hereafter see and know. And for thy comfort, be assured, that I will deliver

 thee from the persecutions both of
 Jews 
and
 Gentiles▪ 
to whom I shall send thee; and will bless thy endeavours to the opening their understandings, and to the turning of them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive, by Faith in me, remission of sins, and a portion of the heavenly in∣heritance, among my faithful ones, regenera∣ted by my Spirit
. He further tells the King, that having had so glorious a Vision, and having heard those words from the mouth of Christ, from Heaven, he could not but yeild obedience thereto, and accor∣dingly had preached at 
Damascus
 first, and then at 
Jerusalem,
 and then through all 
Judea,
 and at last a∣mong the 
Gentiles
 themselves, the Do∣ctrine of 
Repentance,
 and had shewed them their misery by sin, and how they should turn to God, and lay hold on his mercy offered in his Son, and should bring forth such fruits of holiness and righteousness in their lives, as are the genuine fruits of true Re∣pentance, and Faith in Christ. And for 
these things
 (he shews) it was, that he had like to have been killed by the 
Jews
 in the Temple. But being rescued by the merciful providence of God from their fury, he went on still with his work, de∣claring no other thing concerning Christ, but what 
Moses
 and the Prophets did of old foretell of him, namely, that he should be 
put to death,
 and should be the first that should rise again, by his own power, and thereby be eminently declared to be the Son of God
, and should be the Author of our resurrecti∣on, 1 
Cor.
 15.20. 
Col.
 1.18. and should send out the light of his Gospel both to 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles. Festus
 sate still hither∣to, but being a 
Heathen,
 and not understanding these things, he interrupted the Apostle and told him, he talked like a man that had overstudied himself. But 
Paul
 with a great respect replied, that he was not 
mad,
 but spake the 
words of truth and soberness;
 which he was confident 
King Agrippa
 very well perceived; for these things he had been speaking of, 
viz.
 the 
Life, Death,
 and 
Resurrection of Christ,
 were things of very pub∣lick fame, and cognizance, and could not be unknown to him who was a 
Jew
 born. Then humbly applying himself to 
Agrippa
 again, he said, 
King Agrippa, believest thou the Prophets? doubt∣less, I am perswaded thou dost believe them,
 and if so, I pray thee consider, whether those very Prophecies be not exactly fulfilled in the Person of Christ? 
Agrippa
 hearing him thus speak, said, 
Paul, thou dost almost perswade me to be a Christian.
 The Apo∣stle answered, I heartily wish that both thou, and all here pre∣sent were as thorow Christians as I my self am
, only I would not wish any of you in that condition of captivity in which I am at present. When he had thus spoken, the King, and the Governour, and the whole

 company rose up, and departed, acquitting 
Paul
 in their judg∣ments, from deserving either 
death
 or 
bonds;
 yet 'twas not thought fit he should be released, because he had 
appealed to Caesar.


Act.
 25. 
v.
 13. And after certain days, King Agrippa, and Bernice came unto Cesarea, to salute Festus.


v.
 14. And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Pauls cause unto the King, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:


v.
 15. About whom when I was at Jerusalem, the chief Priests and the Elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.


v.
 16. To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to de∣liver any man to die, before that he which is accused, have the accu∣sers face to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning the crimes laid against him.


v.
 17. Therefore when they were come hither, without any delay, on the morrow I sate on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.


v.
 18. Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none ac∣cusation of such things as I supposed:


v.
 19. But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.


v.
 20. And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him, whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these mat∣ters.


v.
 21. But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Cesar.


v.
 22. Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man my self. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.


v.
 23. And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice with great pomp, and was entred into the place of hearing, with the chief Captains, and principal men of the City; at Festus commandment Paul was brought forth.


v.
 24. And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here pre∣sent with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying, that he ought not to live any longer.


v.
 25. But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.


v.
 26. Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my Lord: Where∣fore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O King Agrippa, that after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.


v.
 27. For it seemeth to me unreasonable, to send a prisoner, and not withall to signifie the crimes laid against him.


Act.
 26. 
v.
 1. Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thy self. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:


v.
 2. I think my self happy, King Agrippa, because I shall answer for my self this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I am accu∣sed of the Jews:




v.
 3. Especially, because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.


v.
 4. My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own Nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews,


v.
 5. Which knew me from the beginning, (if they would testifie), that after the most straitest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.


v.
 6. And now I stand, and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:


v.
 7. Unto which promise our twelve Tribes instantly serving God day and night, hope to come: for which hope sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.


v.
 8. Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?


v.
 9. I verily thought with my self, that I ought to do many things con∣trary to the Name of Jesus of Nazareth:


v.
 10. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints did I shut up in prison; having received authority from the chief priests: and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them:


v.
 11. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme, and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange Cities.


v.
 12. Whereupon, as I went to Damascus with authority and commissi∣on from the chief priests,


v.
 13. At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me, and them which journeyed with me.


v.
 14. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speak∣ing unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why per∣secutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.


v.
 15. And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.


v.
 16. But arise, and stand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness, both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will ap∣pear unto thee.


v.
 17. Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,


v.
 18. To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.


v.
 19. Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the hea∣venly vision:


v.
 20. But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and Jerusalem, and tho∣rowout all the coasts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.


v.
 21. For these causes the Jews caught me in the Temple, and went a∣bout to kill me.


v.
 22. Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:


v.
 23. That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.


v
 24. And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thy self, much learning do
h make thee mad.




v.
 25. But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.


v.
 26. For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am perswaded that none of these things are hidden from him, for this thing was not done in a corner.


v.
 27. King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou be∣lievest.


v.
 28. Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou perswadest me to be a Christian.


v.
 29. And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except th
s
 bonds.


v.
 30. And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the gover∣nour, and Bernice, and they that sate with them.


v.
 31. And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.


v.
 32. Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Cesar.




























CHAP. VII.
 Containing 
Pauls
 Fifth and Last Journey, from 
Cesarea
 to 
Rome;
 which we call, 
Iter Ro∣manum.




SECT. I.


FEstus
 and his Council determining now to send 
Paul
 to 
Rome,
 and therein (though acting unjustly, considering the inno∣cence of the Prisoner, who ought to have been acquitted) fulfilling Gods Counsel, [
see Act.
 23.11.]. He is delivered to 
Julius
 a Centurion, (of the Imperial Band), with some other Prisoners, (who possibly were great Malefactors), to be con∣veyed thither. 
Julius
 having received this charge; put him, and the other Prisoners into a ship of 
Adramyttium,
 (a Port-Town of 
Mysia
), which (being as 'tis probable a trading ship) was to sail along by the Coasts of 
Asia. Aristarchus
 a 
Macedo∣nian,
 as also 
Luke
 and 
Timothy
 freely accompanied the Apostle in this Voyage. As they sailed along, they touched at 
Sidon,
 where 
Julius
 was very civil to 
Paul,
 and permitted him to go on shore, and visit his friends there, and refresh himself. Loosing from thence, they were forced to sail under 
Cyprus,
 because the winds were contrary; and when they had coasted by 
Cilicia,
 and 
Pamphylia,
 they came to 
Myra,
 a City of 
Lysia,
 where this Ship finished its Voyage. Thence in a Ship of 
Alexandria
 bound for 
Italy,
 they passed between those 
Promontories
 of 
Gnidus,
 and 
Salmone,
 and came at last, with some difficulty, to a part of 
Crete,
 call'd the 
Fair Havens.
 This Port being some∣thing incommodious to winter in, most of the passengers ad∣vise to put out from thence, and to endeavour to gain 
Phoe∣nice,
 another Haven of 
Crete;
 but they having been thus long at Sea, (the Summer being now gone, yea the 
great Fast
 of expiation, which was on the tenth day of the seventh Month, being past, after which the Sea was not sailed in by the An∣cients

 until the beginning of 
March,
 because of the shortness of the d
ys, and the tempests which often arise between those two times), 
Paul
 not only contemplating the danger of the season, but being inspir'd by the Spirit of God, admonished them of the danger of the Voyage, if they should now put out to Sea again; shewing them, it would be hazzardous, not only to the Ship, and the goods in it, but even to the lives of the men also. Therefore he advised them, to stay and winter where they now were. But his words prevailed nothing, because the 
Master
 of the ship (who was thought better skill'd in his own Art) advised otherwise. The Southwind therefore blow∣ing at first, softly, and seeming to favour their design, they loosed from thence, and sailed along by 
Crete;
 but a little af∣ter, there arose a tempestuous wind, call'd 
Euroclydon
, by which they were carried to a little Island call'd 
Clauda,
 and then be∣ing caught and tossed by that great tempest they had much ado to save the Boat, and draw it into the Ship. Which done, they undergirt the Ship, and (fearing lest they should fall into the Quicksands), they struck sail, and so were driven. Then they ligh
¦ned the Ship, by casting some of the goods overbord; and on the third day they were forced to cast into the Sea the furniture of the Ship: And neither 
Sun
 nor 
Stars
 for many days appearing, and the weather being so exceeding tempestuous, they utterly despair'd of escaping. Now they having been for 
fourteen days
 together thus tossed with tempests, and under such fear of death, that they had not observed ordinary meals, 
Paul
 at last spake unto them, telling them, they should have harkened unto him, and so they might have prevented, and avoided this hazzard. However he bids them be of good chear; for no man among them should perish, only the Ship would be lost. For God (whose Servant he is, and who is pleased to own him, and protect him) had sent him a message by a holy An∣gel, that he must be brought before 
Nero
 the 
Roman Emperor,
 and that he would, for his sake
, pre∣serve the lives of all those that were with him in the Ship. The Apostle further de∣clares, how confident he was, that this that was revealed to him from the Lord, should be made good. Yet he telleth them, that for all this, they must expect to be cast upon an Island.


They having therefore for fourteen days together been thus toss'd in the 
Adriatick
 Sea, (not strictly so call'd, but in a large sense), at last the Mariners thought they drew near some Coun∣try, and by letting down their plummet, and sounding, they found it at first twenty fathoms, and trying again, they found it fifteen fathoms, which was an argument to them they were near a shore. But it being night, and they apprehending dan∣ger,

 lest they should fall upon shelves for want of light to guide them, they durst go no further, but cast four anchors out of the Stern of the Ship, and so earnestly expected the day. But in the mean time, the Mariners let down the Boat into the Sea, (which before they had haled up into the Ship), under colour, as if they would have brought Anchors out of the 
Prow,
 or foremost part of the Ship, but intended therein to make their escape, fearing a Ship-wrack, and to leave all the rest to shift for themselves. 
Paul
 perceiving this, he told the 
Centurion
 and the 
Souldiers,
 that though God had promised to preserve them, yet they must not expect it, without using due means for their own preservation, which was to stay the Mariners in the Ship, whose help and diligence was especially needful to them on such an occasion. Hereupon the 
Souldiers,
 to pre∣vent the 
Mariners
 design, cut the Ropes of the Boat, and let it fall into the Sea. Then 
Paul
 while the day was com∣ing on, considering that the company in the Ship having been in so perpetual danger, and fear of being cast away, for so many days together, had eat 
no set meals,
 or 
so lit∣tle,
 that it was in a manner a 
continual fasting,
 he exhorted them now to refresh themselves by taking some food, which would the better enable them to bear the difficulties they were to grapple with, and (through the help of God) there should not 
one hair
 
fall from the head of any of them.
 Having thus spoken, he took bread, and 
praising God for it, and desiring his blessing upon it,
 in the presence of them all, he began to eat, and refresh himself; and the rest (being encouraged by his words and example) did the like; so great a comfort and blessing was this poor 
despised Prisoner
 to the whole company. Then taking an account of their number thy found they were 
two hundred seventy six souls in all,
 in the Ship. Which possibly was done upon the motion of 
Paul,
 that so after their deliverance, it might appear, how exactly his prediction [men
ioned 
v.
 22. & 34] was verified and fulfilled. And when they had eaten what was sufficient for them, they cast out the lading of the Ship which yet remained, (
see v.
 18.19.), yea and the 
wheat
 it self, which hitherto they had spared, being so needful for their sustentation. In the morning they discovered Land, but knew not where they were. However they discovered a cer∣tain Creek, into which they resolved, if it were possible, to run the Ship. Therefore taking up the Anchors, and loosing the Bands wherewith before they had made fast the Rudder, they committed themselves to Sea, and made towards shore. But falling into a place where two Seas met, they ran the Ship a-ground, so that the 
fore part
 sticking fast, the 
hinder-part
 was broken with the violence of the waves; nothing now remain∣ing, but that every one should shift for his life, and swim to shore, if he could, the Soldiers (shewing a cruel ingratitude to

 
Paul,
 who had been so great a comfort to them, and for whose sake their lifes were spared) advize, that the 
Prisoners
 should be put to death, lest any of them should by swimming out make his escape from them. But the 
Centurion
 being willing to save 
Paul,
 (for whose sake he himself was preserved), diverted them from that barbarous purpose, and commanded that those that could swim should first cast themselves into the Sea, and get to land, that they might be the more helpful to others; and those that could not swim, should make use of bords or planks, or other broken pieces of the Ship. Which they accordingly do∣ing, it pleased God that they came all safe to land. And when they were come thither, they found the 
Island
 upon which they were cast was 
Malta.


Act.
 27. 
v.
 1. And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul, and certain other prisoners, unto one named Ju∣lius, a centurion of Augustus band.


v.
 2. And entring into a ship of Adramyttium, we lanched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus a Macedonian of Thessaloni∣ca, being with us.


v.
 3. And the next day we touched at Sidon: And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.


v.
 4. And when we had lanched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.


v.
 5. And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra a City of Lysia.


v.
 6. And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria, sailing into Ita∣ly, and he put us therein.


v.
 7. And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Gnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Creet, over against Salmone,


v.
 8. And hardly passing it, came unto a place, which is called the Fair∣havens, nigh whereunto was the city of Lacea.


v.
 9. Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dan∣gerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them.


v.
 10. And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.


v.
 11. N
vertheless, the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.


v.
 12. And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter, which is an haven of Creet, and lieth towand the south-west, and north-west.


v.
 13. And when the south-wind blew softly, supposing that they had ob∣tained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Creet.


v.
 14. But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, cal∣l
d Euroclydon.


v.
 15. A
d when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we l
t her drive.


v.
 16. And running under a certain Island, which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:


v.
 17. Which when they had taken up, they used helps, under-girding the ship: and fearing lest they should fall into the quick-sands, strake sail, and so were driven.




v.
 18. And being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they light∣ed the ship:


v.
 19. And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship:


v.
 20. And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved, was then ta∣ken away.


v.
 21. But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loo∣sed from Creet, and to have gained this harm and loss.


v.
 22. And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any mans life among you, but of the ship.


v.
 23. For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve.


v.
 24. Saying, Fear not Paul, thou must be brought before Cesar, and lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.


v.
 25. Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.


v.
 26. Howbeit, we must be cast upon a certain island.


v.
 27. But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria about midnight, the ship-men deemed that they drew neer to some Countrey:


v.
 28. And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.


v.
 29. Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four ancres out of the stern, and wished for the day.


v.
 30 And as the ship-men were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast ancres out of the fore-ship.


v.
 31. Paul said to the centurion, and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.


v.
 32. Then the souldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.


v.
 33. And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.


v.
 34. Wherefore, I pray you to take some meat, for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.


v.
 35. And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.


v.
 36. Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.


v.
 37. And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.


v.
 38. And when they had eaten enough, they lighted the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.


v.
 39. And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discover∣ed a certain creek, with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.


v.
 40. And when they had taken up the ancres, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the main sail to the wind, and made toward shore.


v.
 41. And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship a-ground, and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.


v.
 42. And the souldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.




v.
 43. But the Centurion willing to save Paul, kept them from their pur∣pose, and commanded that they which could swim, should cast them∣selves first into the sea, and get to land:


v.
 44. And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship, and so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.


Act.
 28. 
v.
 1. And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.




















SECT. II.


IN this 
Island
 they were very courteously received by the 
Islanders,
 who made a great fire for them to warm and re∣fresh them, coming wet, and cold out of the sea. 
Paul
 having gathered a bundle of sticks, and laying them on the fire, a 
Vi∣per
 that was in the wood, feeling the heat of the fire, leaped out upon him, and fastned on his hand; which the 
Islanders
 seeing, they presently concluded that he was certainly some notorious Malefactor, whom divine vengeance followed, though he had now escaped at sea. Thus the very light of nature suggested even to 
Barbarians
 themselves, that 
wickedness would not go unpunished;
 see 
Rom.
 1.32. But the Apostle shaking off the venemous beast into the fire, and receiving no harm at all from it, (
see Mark
 16.18.), they presently chang'd their opi∣nion, and took him for a 
God
, come to them in the shape of a man. Thus it pleased God by a new miracle to confirm the Apostles authority, and thereby to prepare the hearts of of these 
Islanders
 to receive the Gospel. The landing of these 
shipwrack'd persons
 being made known to 
Publius
 the Governor, or chief man of the Island; he out of his great compassion and humanity entertained them all three days at his own charge. It so happened, that the 
Father
 of 
Publius
 was at this time sick of a 
Feaver,
 and 
bloody Flux;
 which being made known to 
Paul,
 he went to him, and praying with him, and laying his hands on him, he perfectly healed
 him. This being noised in the Island,

 several other diseased people were brought to him, and were also healed by him; upon which, 
Paul
 and his Christian asso∣ciates were much honoured by the Islanders. Having stayed there 
three months,
 (in which time 'tis like 
Paul
 made many Converts, and planted a Church in the Island, as Ecclesiasti∣cal History informs us), at their departure they were fur∣nished by the Inhabitants of the Island with all necessaries for their journey. From hence therefore they set sail for 
Italy,
 in a ship of 
Alexandria,
 whose sign was 
Castor
 and 
Pollux,
 and sail'd first to 
Syracuse
 in 
Sicily,
 thence to 
Rhegium
 in 
Italy,
 and thence to 
Puteoli
 a Port near 
Naples;
 where they found some Christian
 Professors, who were very glad of them, and importun'd them to stay a week with them. Thence 
on foot
 they travailed towards 
Rome
, and when they were come as far as 
Appii forum,
 several Christians that dwelt in 
Rome,
 hearing of their approach, came thither to meet and welcome them; and others met them at a place call'd the 
three Taverns.
 When 
Paul
 saw these Christians, he praised God exceed∣ingly. He knew, there was a 
famous Church
 there (long ago planted
), to whom about 
three years
 before, he had written a large Epistle, and had of a long time desired to see them; therefore could not but now rejoice, that God had vouchsafed to him such an opportunity. The sight of these Christian-
Romans
 did much revive and comfort him. He was glad they had so much liberty at 
Rome,
 that they durst come forth, and thus publickly own him, who was in bonds; and he hoped for much comfort and succour from them, against the troubles and dangers he expected at 
Rome.


When they were come to 
Rome,
 the 
Centurion
 delivered the Prisoners to the Captain of the Guard who suffered 
Paul
 (mo∣ved thereto possibly by the good testimony given of him by 
Julius
) to dwell in a private house which he hired, only with a Soldier to guard him, carrying on his right hand an Iron-Chain
, which probably he girded a∣bout him when he was in the house; but going abroad he was bound with the same to the left hand of the Soldier. After they had been there 
three
 days, 
Paul
 desired to speak with the chief of the 
Jews
 in that Ci∣ty; (his constant love to his own Nation en∣gaging him always to desire to gain them in the first place), and when they came to him, he spake to them to this purpose, 
Country men, I have done nothing against my own Nation, or contrary to the Laws or Customs of the Jews
; 
yet was I by the
 Jews 
at
 Je∣rusalem 
apprehended and accused before the
 Roman 
Governour, who found no capital

 Crime laid to my charge, and therefore would have dismiss'd me, had not the importunity of the
 Jews 
inclin'd him to deliver me into their power; which that I might avoid, I was ne∣cessitated to Appeal unto
 Caesar, 
only to clear my self, not intending to lay any thing to the charge of any of my Country-men, or to exasperate the Emperor against them, though I have been so ill used by them. And for this cause I was sent hither, and now have sent for you to acquaint you, that for the sake of Jesus Christ, the true Messias,
 (whom all true 
Israelites
 long looked for, who is now come in the flesh, to be their Redeemer, and in whom all the true 
Israel
 of God repose all their hope and confidence of salvation, and by whom they expect a joyful resurrection from the dead), 
I am bound with this chain.


The 
Jews
 replied that they for their part were not possess'd with any prejudice against his person; for they had not recei∣ved any letters out of 
Judea
 concerning him, neither had any of their Brethren that came from thence spoken any evil of him. But as for this Profession and Doctrine of 
Christianity,
 they acknowledged, the 
Jews
 their Brethren, as also the 
Gen∣tiles,
 did generally oppose it, and spake hardly of it; yet they desired to hear what he had to say for it. Hereupon a day being appointed for that purpose, many of the 
Jews
 came to his lodging, to whom he opened at large these 
two points,
 1. 
That the Kingdom of the Messiah promised by God to the Fathers was to be a spiritual, not an earthly Kingdom.
 2. 
That Jesus of Nazareth was the true Messiah, in whom all that desire to be saved, ought to trust and believe.
 Both these he confirmed by testimonies, out of the 
Law of Moses,
 and out of the 
Prophets;
 con∣tinuing his discourse from morning till night.
 The effect of which discourse was this, 
some
 believed, and embraced the Gospel; 
others
 remained altogether unmoved and unperswa∣ded; and so they parted in some difference and disagreement among themselves. 
Paul
 at their departure, told those that would not be perswaded, that 
this unbelief
 of theirs was a thing which the Prophet 
Isaiah
 had long ago punctually foretold, 
viz. ch.
 6.9. wherein he shews, that God had bidden him 
go and tell that people, that hearing they will hear and not understand, and seeing they will see and not perceive; for their heart was waxed gross, and they heard heavily with their ears,
 that is, 
they had contracted a wilful hardness, deafness, and blind∣ness;
 upon which it follows, that they will not convert, nor hearken to any counsel, that should make them capable of mercy. This being their case, he tells them, upon this refusal and obduration of theirs, he was to preach the Gospel (the word of salvation), to the 
Gentiles,
 who would gladly embrace it. 
See Rom.
 15.9, 10, 11, 12.




After this, 
Paul
 dwelt 
two years
 in his own hired house at 
Rome,
 preaching the Gospel, (the doctrine of Christ that tends to the setting up the kingdom of God in the souls of men, 
see Mat.
 4.23. & 13.19.), to all that came to him, without any disturbance, he having, as it seems, some Christian friends even in 
Nero
's family, 
Phil.
 4.22.


Act.
 28. 
v.
 2. And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us every one because of the present rain, and because of the cold.


v.
 3. And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastned on his hand.


v.
 4. And when the barbarians saw the venemous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.


v.
 5. And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.


v.
 6. Howbeit, they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a God.


v.
 7. In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius, who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.


v.
 8. And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever, and of a bloody flix, to whom Paul entred in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.


v.
 9. So when this was done, others also which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:


v.
 10. Who also honoured us with many honours, and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.


v.
 11. And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintred in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.


v.
 12. And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.


v.
 13. And from thence we set a compass, and came to Rhegium, and after one day the south-wind blew, and we came the next day to Pu∣teoli:


v.
 14. Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.


v.
 15. And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii-Forum, and the three Taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.


v.
 16. And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by him∣self, with a soldier that kept him.


v.
 17. And it came to pass that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together. And when they were come together, he said un∣to them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.


v.
 18. Who when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.


v.
 19. But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Cesar, not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.


v.
 20. For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to

 speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.


v.
 21. And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judea, concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came, shewed or spake any harm of thee.


v.
 22. But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concern∣ing this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.


v.
 23. And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging, to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, p
rswading, them concerning J
sus, b
th out of the law of Mo∣ses, and out of the Prophets, from morning till evening.


v.
 24. And some believed the things which were spoken, and some be∣liev
d not.


v.
 25. And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, af∣ter that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers.


v.
 26. Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive.


v.
 27. For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.


v.
 28. Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.


v.
 29. And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.


v.
 30. And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and re∣ceived all that came in unto him.


v.
 31. Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence; no man forbidding him.

SECT. IV.


THis year, 'tis probable, 
Paul
 was brought to his trial at

 though 
Luke
 makes no mention of it. For that his trial was something early, may appear by his own words in his 
Second Epistle to Timothy,
 written some time after, where he speaks of his 
first answer,
 (at which 
all his friends forsook him,
 through fear of suffering), that is, possibly, all such of his friends as had power at 
Rome,
 or might by their Testimonies have stood him instead; which he prays God may not be laid to their charge, 2

 (af∣ter the 
Jewish
 manner of speaking), his 
Cou∣sin-German,
 being an 
Apostle,
 and so of an unlimited Commission, thought it sutable to his office, to take care of all converted to the Faith 
among the Twelve Tribes,
 scatter∣ed abroad in divers Countries, and accordingly he addresses this Epistle to them. 'Tis probable, he wrote it not long be∣fore his martyrdom, because he seems to intimates, that the 
vengeance
 that was to fall on 
Jerusalem
 was drawing nigh; see 
Jam.
 5.8, 9. The general occasion of which, seemeth to be, the great 
degeneracy,
 both as to 
Faith,
 and 
Manners,
 and the growth

 of 
Libertinism,
 which he understood to be among them. Which evils that he might obviate, he writes this Epistle to them, wherein he gives them many serious Admonitions.


1. COncerning the right bearing of afflictions, or outward temptations;
 He tells them, they are to account it matter of great and solid joy, when they meet with divers troubles and afflictions for the profession of the Gos∣pel; by which afflictions, they may be proved, whether they will, even in adver∣sity, stick close to Christ, or no. For they should consider, that those temptati∣ons are 
trials
 of their Faith; and the trial of their Faith worketh patience, through the operation of the Spirit of God. And they should learn to be pati∣ent to the end, 
(Mat. 10.22.),
 that so nothing may be wanting to them, for the perfecting and making up all the parts of holiness in them And because 'tis a hard matter to bear afflictions aright, and a great deal of heavenly wisdom is requisite thereunto, he advises, that when any of them, in such times of pres∣sure as those were, do find themselves to want this wisdom and skill to manage themselves aright, that then they should humbly beg it of God, who giveth libe∣rally, and upbraideth not. But then (he tells them) they must ask in 
Faith,
 and with a fixed dependance on God, not wavering, or doubting either concerning his power, goodness, or faithfulness. For 
doubting
 or 
wavering
 keeps men in a perpetual disquiet, and agitation of mind, not knowing what to depend on. Besid
s, this is the way to have their 
prayers
 blasted, God not being wont to hear 
them,
 that do not sincerely depend on him. And he further tells them, that 'tis not only in prayer, that this fluctuation, or wavering of spirit, pro∣duces such ill effects; but he shews them, that such a person hath the infelicity of never knowing in other occasions, where to fix or what course to take. And having given them this caution concerning 
prayer,
 he returns to his purpose a∣gain, of comforting the afflicted under their trials. And in order hereunto, he counsels the 
poor Christian,
 who is through afflictions or the Cross, humbled by the Lord, and brought low, to comfort himself, yea to glory in 
this,
 that he is exalted to the high dignity of being an adopted Child of God. And the 
rich man
 he counsels, not to rejoice in his 
riches;
 but if God have given him an humble frame of mind, and a preparedness to bear the Cross, and to be brought low, to 
rejoice
 in that frame of spirit. For all his glory (as he is a rich man) is very fading. As the Sun when it is risen scorcheth the green grass, and maketh the florid part of it presently to wither; so a 
rich man
 (when God permits it) soon fadeth in his estate, and cometh to nothing, notwithstanding all his counsels and endeavours to the contrary. He concludes this admonition, declaring 
that Christian to be blessed,
 who patiently endureth the afflictions which he shall meet with in the way of his duty; for when he shall be tryed, and found faithful, he shall at length obtain the crown of eternal life, which the Lord hath graciously promised to them that love him, and that testifie their love to him, by a patient enduring tribulations for his sake. 
From Ver. 1, to 13.


2.
 Having thus spoken of 
outward
 temptations, (or afflictions), he comes now, to speak of 
inward,
 namely, such as sollicite to sin, and which consist in evil inclinations. And he advises them, to take heed of that Blasphemy that casts the blame of these temptations upon God. For God is of so 
pure
 and 
ho∣ly
 a nature that he cannot be tempted or stirred up to sin by any means what∣ever; neither doth he sollicite or stir up any one to it. But a man is tempted, or stirred up to evil, by the 
inward lust,
 or 
original corruption
 of his own heart; the gradual motions whereof are these. 
1.
 By the instigation of this in∣ward lust, or concupiscence, a man is drawn aside from true good, and allur'd to evil. 
2.
 This inward lust solliciting, and enticing, gets at length the consent of the will, and so is said to conceive. 
3.
 Then a man actually sins, and so sin

 brings forth. 
4.
 Sin being committed, by its desert bringeth forth or procureth death. Therefore they should take heed of permitting themselves so far to be de∣ceived, as to ascribe the cause of their impiety unto God. For He is 
immu∣tably
 the Author of all good, and from him d
scends every good gift. God is the Father of lights, and spiritual illumination, and (says he), of his own free mercy and good will, he hath 
regenerated
 and converted 
us
 (who are be∣lievers among the 
Jews
) by the word of his Gospel, that as the first fruits
 were under the Law consecrated to God, so we might be consecrated to him be∣fore any other people, and so he hath allowed us the favour of being the first that have been called to this dignity, 
[see Eph. 1.12.],
 therefore we ought to be far from admitting any such blasphemous thought concerning God, as if we were moved at any time by him to sin or evil. 
From Ver. 13, to 19.


3.
 Having mentioned their 
regeneration
 by the preaching of the Gospel, he takes occasion to shew them, how the 
Word
 ought to be 
heard
 and 
received.
 In particular, that they should be 
swift
 and ready to hear it, but slow to speak or cavil against it, and slow to wrath, not being soon offended, and angry at the convictions or reproofs of it. For mans sinful anger doth not put men upon do∣ing those things, that are just and righteous in Gods account. And because wrath is such a hindrance to the righteousness which God requireth, he adviseth, that all filthy, and evil speaking, and overflowing of malice, all scoffs, and railing, 
&c.
 should be laid aside, and that with meekness they should receive the word, which God by his Spirit does, as it were, graff and implant in the soul, that it may bring forth fruits acceptable unto Him, and which being accompanied by his di∣vine grace, is his power unto salvation. He further shews, how they should not only be 
hearers
 of the Word, but 
doers
 of it. And he declares the vanity and unprofitableness of bare hearing, by a similitude taken from a man looking his face in a Glass, who soon forgetteth the fashion of his own countenance, ha∣ving only a slight view thereof: So the preaching of the Word usually maketh but slight impressions on careless hearers. But they that look narrowly, and di∣ligently inquire into the whole Doctrine of the Gospel, (which is a 
perfect Law,
 teaching the way to true liberty, and freedom from 
sin, wrath,
 and 
e∣ternal death,
 and brings us into a free state, a state of Sonship) and abide, and remain in the knowledg and belief thereof, and obedience thereto, not being forgetful hearers, but mindful of the duties, and work
 the Gospel prescribes, such persons shall be blessed in this course. And l
st any should challenge a share in this blessedness to whom it does not belong, he shews, who are 
hearers only,
 and 
not doers
 of the Word, namely, such as allow them∣selves in any known sin, and particularly in the sins of the tongue. For he tells them, that 
that man
 miserably deceives his own heart, who thinketh himself truly religious, yet bridleth not his tongue
. Such a mans profession of the Christian Faith, he assures them, is but vain. But they that would manifest their pro∣fession to be sincere, and immaculate, and such as God (who is the Father of Christ, and of all true Believers in him) approveth, must manifest it by works of 
Charity,
 and 
Purity,
 keeping themselves from the wickedness and defile∣ments that prevail in the World, wherewith so many are polluted. 
From Ver. 19, to the end.


He comes now to admonish them of another 
Evil,
 that it seems was too common amongst them, which was this, They over-esteemed the 
rich
, giving them all the respect and observance they could devise, in their Synagogues, and Courts of Judicature; yea they went so far, as to esteem the 
Wicked-rich
 above the 
Godly-poor,
 honouring and observing those that were apt to hale them to the Judg∣ment

 Seats, despising and disesteeming the poor, and not regarding them accord∣ing to their excellency in grace: Yea they were prone to favour the cause of the rich against the poor in judgment. The Apostle shews them the evil of this practise, by putting this case to them. Says he, If there come into your 
Syna∣gogues
, or 
Ecclesiastical Courts,
 a 
Rich man,
 with a Gold Ring, and goodly Apparel, and there be a difference to be decided between him and a 
Poor man,
 who is in poor Clothes; and you shew great respect to the 
Rich man,
 and favour him in his cause, but con∣temn the 
Poor man
; are ye not then partial, and perverse Judges, whose thoughts and determinations are evil, and perverse? That therefore he may restrain them from this undue proceeding, he shews, that God hath put a three-fold dignity upon the 
Godly-poor.
 They are 
Elected
 of God, 
Rich
 in Faith and the graces of the Spirit, and 
Heirs
 of the Kingdom of Heaven. And that he might further shew them their practice herein, not only to be vain and evil, but sensless and irrational, he useth a new Argument to this purpose. 
D
 not rich men
 (says he) 
oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
 It seems, many of the rich men among whom they lived were bitter enemies, and reproachers of Christianity; and therefore he in∣timates, that 
wealth
 was not to be such a motive to them to favour the cause of the rich, when it came to be tried before them. Indeed, if they did dispense their respects aright, giving the rich men only, what is just, and meet, and did not deprive their poorer Brethren, of what is due to 
them,
 and in all things carried themselves according to that 
Royal Law
 of the 
King of kings,
 con∣tained in the Scripture, (which enjoins us 
to love our Neighbour as our selves,
 and 
to do to others what we would judg fit to be done to us
), then they did well; but this partial respecting of the rich, with contempt of the poor, plainly shewed them to be transgressors, and not fulfillers of this Law. For the 
Law, Lev. 19.15.
 (to which place 'tis probable he pointeth), saith, 
Thou shalt do no unrighteousness in judgment: Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor the person of the mighty; but in righteous∣ness shalt thou judg thy neighbour.
 But here they might object 
this,
 that which he reprov'd in them was a 
small offence,
 and might be easily excus'd, and their obedience in other things might make amends for such a small failing as this was. To this he answers, that, Suppose a man should be an exact ob∣server of all other points of the Law (which yet is impossible) and willingly offend in one particular, he is guilty of breaking the whole Law. Not that 
all sins
 concurr in 
one,
 but because a contempt of the same Law and Law-giver is manifested in the breach of one Command as well as of all. For obedi∣ence to Gods will is required 
universally
 to all that he commands, and he that offends in one command, though he keep all the rest, fails of the obedience which is due from him, and so is punishable as well as if he had offended in all. And that he may make this matter the more clear, he instances in the 
Sixth
 and 
Se∣venth Commandments,
 shewing that in the violation of either, the authority of the 
Lawgiver,
 and of him that commanded 
both,
 is violated. But they might again object, that they shall not ultimately be judged by the Law, as gi∣ven by 
Moses,
 (which requires perfect obedience in every respect, and pronounces a Curse upon every one that in the least transgresseth), but by the Gospel, 
[see ch. 1.25.].
 He answers, that he would have them so 
speak,
 and 
act,
 and carry themselves in those matters, as those that shall be judged by the 
Gospel,
 which is a Law of 
Liberty
 indeed, but not of 
licentiousness;
 of liberty from sin, but not of liberty to sin. And if they would not come under the rigour of the Law of 
Moses,
 they must not be cruel and injurious to their poor Brethren. For the equity of that Law requireth, that those persons should find no mercy, who will

 shew none. Therefore mercy is not to be hoped for, by those that only honour rich men, but by those that are full of Bow
ls, and bounty to the poor. For as the mercy of God rejoiceth over his justice; so mercy exercis'd by man, gives him occasion to hope, yea to rejoice in the mercy of God, and exceedingly supports him against the fear of his justice and judgment. 
From Ver. 1, to 14.


5.
 Having spoken of the 
Gospel,
 as 
a Law of Liberty, v. 12.
 lest this ex∣pr
ssi
n should encourage some Hypocrites to live as they list, provided they did but profess Faith in Christ, he admonishes them to take he
d of such a vain, un∣profitable 
Faith
, because such a Faith, as is void of good works, cannot save. So that in this whole dis∣course, the Apostles intent and drift is, to shew, not 
what justifieth,
 but 
who
 is justified; not what Faith 
doth,
 but what Faith 
is.
 He that hath a 
true Faith,
 is sure of Salvation; but not always he that saith he hath Faith. His drift therefore is, not to shew, that 
Faith without works doth not justifie,
 but that a bare Assent to the truths of the Gospel, which is n
t accompanied with good works, is not 
Faith;
 and the 
Justification
 he here speaketh of, is not so much of the 
Person,
 as of the 
Faith.
 For as professions of love to those that are indigent, and in want, without performance, are vain; so such a 
Faith,
 which is but a naked assent to the Gospel, or a bare profession of it, without producing good fruits, is unprofitable and dead. He further urgeth his present Argument, by framing a 
Dialogue,
 between a 
true Believer,
 that can manifest his Faith by his works, and a 
boasting Hyprocrite,
 that can produce no works to evidence or demonstrate the truth of his Faith. The 
true Believer
 may say to such a person thus; 
Thou boastest with thy tongue, and saist, thou hast Faith. I shall not boast, but humbly produce the real testimony of my works,
 (see Mat. 
11.4, 5.), as an evidence of my Faith. Thy Faith is not productive of good works. Now shew me thy Faith without works, and make it appear to me by any Scripture-ground, (if thou canst), to be a sincere and true Faith; and if thou canst not, I will shew thee my Faith, accompanied with good works, and demon∣strate it to be sincere by my works, seeing they are a real evidence and proof of it. But thou wilt say, thou hast a true Faith, for thou belie∣vest there is one God. Thou dost well in so believing; yet if this Faith of thine consist in a bare knowledg, or ass
nt of thy mind, and do not produce in thee a real love to God, and affiance in him, and a serious endeavour to please him, what advantage hast thou thereby above the Devils? For they believe this truth as well as thou, but are far enough from having any true Faith; for instead of conceiving any hope there∣by of salvation, they are fill'd with unceivable horror, upon the appre∣hension of his justice. All knowledg of God, out of Christ, is very un∣comfortable to sinners. But wilt thou rightly understand and consider, (O vain Professor
!), 
what may be said against thy Faith, and to prove to thee, that Faith without works is dead? seeing good works are a proper and insep
rable effect of true and saving Faith? I say, they are such effects, as do not give life to it, but declare it, and manifest it, as Apples do not give life to the tree, but shew and demonstrate life to be in it. I shall further prove this point to thee, by the examples of persons justified of old, and shall shew, that they were not justified by a dead and fruitless Faith, but by a Faith bringing forth good works. And I shall instance only in two,
 Abraham 
and
 R
hab. 
As for
 Abraham, 
I demand, whether he were not justified by works, (particularly, that eminent work, when he really

 purposed, and had God continued the command, would actually have offered up his Son
 Isaac 
on the Altar
), 
I demand, Whether by that, and his other works, he did not shew, that he had a true and lively Faith
? 
Thou seest therefore, that his Faith rested not in a bare knowledg, or profession, but was operative; it had efficacy and influence upon his works; it did not exert it self in acts of belie∣ving only, but also in working; so that his Faith, by producing good works, was declared to be a perfect and true Faith, and such as had all the parts belonging to it. And his Faith was impro∣ved, and strengthened, and perfected by works, as the inward vigour of the spirits is increas'd by motion and exercise. Yet this must not be so understood, as if works did
 perfect Faith, 
by com∣municating of perfection to it, but only that they do stir up, exercise, and excite the vigour of it. This therefore being an evident discovery of
 A∣brahams 
Faith; it plainly appear'd, how truly it was said of him before,
 Gen. 
15.
 that he believed, and it was imputed to him for righteousness. 
So that the first testimony, and solemn approbation which
 Abraham 
had from God, was because of his Faith. And by his readiness to sacrifice his Son, he de∣clared he had a true justifying-Faith; and accor∣dingly
 the Lord 
saith after this trial, Now I know that thou fearest me,
 Gen. 
22.12. And hereupon he was called,
 the Friend 
of God. You see then, that by
 Works 
(that is; by the parts, and offices of a holy life) a man is
 justified, 
that is,
 acquitted from hypocrisie, 
and his
 Faith 
is manifested to be
 good, and right, and 
he himself
 just 
and
 righteous. 
You see also, that he is not justified by Faith on∣ly,
 that is, 
by a bare, and naked profession, or dead and vain Faith, such as consisteth in a meer assent, or empty knowledg and speculation, which is so far from justifying, that it is not properly
 Faith. 
I come now to my other
 instance, viz. 
that of
 Rahab, 
which I the rather make use of, because some might say, that indeed
 Abrahams Faith 
(the great pat∣tern of Believers) might produce good works, but every Believers
 Faith 
cannot arise to the strength of
 Abrahams. 
For answer to this, I shall shew, that the weakest Faith, that is
 true, and saving 
must produce good works. And for the proof of this, I shall instance in
 Rahab 
an
 Harlot
, 
and an
 Heathen, 
when God first wrought upon her, yet after she was converted, her Faith, how weak soever, express'd it self in a very self-denying act. Had she said to the
 Messengers 
of the Children of Israel, I believe the
 God of Heaven and Earth 
hath given you this whole Land for a Possession, yet I dare not shew you any kindness in this City; it had been such
 a dead barren Faith, 
as we have been speaking of: but
 her Faith 
prevailed so far with her, that she perform'd a grateful office to them, though she ran a great hazzard thereby, and expos'd her self to the rage of the people of her City, for harbouring spies, and sending them out by ano∣ther way, to escape the great danger they were in.
 See Josh. 
2.




He concludeth this whole dispute, shewing, how little is to be ascribed to an 
empty profession of Faith
 without works: such a Faith, he tells them, 'tis but as the body without the vital spirit, which every body knows to be no more than a meer carcass. 
From Ver. 14, to the end.


6.
 He re-assumes the discourse he had been upon before in the end of the first Chapter, admonishing them to take heed of 
offending with their tongues,
 and particularly, not to arrogate to themselves a 
supercilious Mastership
 over others, (taking upon them to censure them at pleasure), because 
such heavy censures
 draw down upon themselves very great and heavy judgments; 
see 1 Cor. 11.31. Mat. 7.2.


And he disswades there from, 
1.
 Ʋpon consideration of the 
common frailty,
 incident to all men; telling them, that 
In many things we offend all.
 And 
2ly,
 Because 
bridling the tongue
 is a sign of some good progress and growth in grace. He that can govern his tongue
 aright doth thereby manifest himself to be a 
sincere,
 and grown, and well improv'd Christian, and able to bridle the whole body, 
that is,
 able to govern all his other actions a∣right, which are acted by the members of the body. This he further illustrates, by 
two Similitudes. 1.
 Of a 
Bridle-bit. 2.
 Of a 
Rudder,
 or 
Helm of a Ship.
 If we guide the 
Bri∣dle
 well, we rule the Horse; if we rule the 
Stern
 aright, we guide the Ship: So the Tongue, though but a small member, yet well ordered, and governed, ef∣fecteth
 great things. But great inconveniences a∣rise where this 
small member
 is not well-governed. For as a little fire kindleth much wood, so an evil Tongue is a fire, (there is a world
 of sin in it), 'tis a powerful means to kindle great strifes and divi∣sions. An 
evil Tongue
 is of so cursed an influence, that it often defiles the whole body, 
that is,
 involves the other members in guilt, and defiles them, by drawing them to act, and commit sin, 
[see Eccles. 5.6.].
 It sets on fire the whole World
, or, (as some render it), the whole course and revolution of our life
 from youth to manhood, from manhood to old age. The evils of the tongue diffuse themselves into all the parts of mans life, and it sets on fire, with its wickedness, the wheel and course of all our natural faculties, being it self set on fire by the Devil, and kindled with that fire that comes from Hell. And having thus shewed the cursed influence of the Tongue, he comes now to shew, how difficult the cure is. He tells them, there are no kind of Beasts but may be tam'd by humane art and skill; nothing in nature so violent and hurtful, but humane art and industry, hath made it serviceable to the use of men. But the Tongue is harder to be tam'd than any of these. 'Tis such an 
indisciplinable member,
 that no mans reason, or skill, can tame another
 mans unruly tongue; nor can he tame 
his own
 of himself, without the assistance of divine grace. An evil Tongue is an unrestrainable evil, full of deadly poison, spitting forth the venome of re∣viling, backbiting, reproaching, cursing, and many other evils.


But some might here object, 
With our tongues we praise God,
 therefore the Tongue is not so full of venome as you suggest.


For answer, he shews, What a foul sin it is in any Christian to use this member to so distant offices as some do, namely, therewith in the publick con∣gregation to bless God, and afterwards to judg and rail at their Christian Bre∣thren, who, for that Image of God they bear upon them, are to be regarded,

 and used with kindness: What, says he, shall two such contrary things, as 
blessing
 and 
cursing,
 proceed out of the same mouth? This, he tells them, ought not to be. And if they would further understand the monstrousness of this practice, he will represent it unto them, by three Similitudes. Can a 
fountain
 (says he) send forth two sorts of waters, of so different a nature, as 
bitter
 and 
sweet?
 or can the 
Sea
 send out 
salt
 water and 
fresh?
 Can a 
Fig-tree
 bear 
Figs
 and 
Olive-berries
 too? Can a 
Vine
 bear 
Gr
pes
 and 
Figs,
 the the fruit that belongs to another Tree? And as these things are impossible in the ordinary course of Nature; so he shews them, 'tis absurd in manners, that the 
same Tongue
 should bring forth 
good
 and 
evil,
 should 
bless
 and 
curse, pray
 and 
revile.
 Therefore the tongue should be employed to those good uses to which God has appointed it, and not to the contrary. 
From Ver. 1, to 13.


7.
 He comes now to shew, what is one of the prime causes of the 
unruliness,
 and 
intemperance
 of the Tongue, namely, A false perswasion, which is in some, of their own wisdom and knowledg, whereas there is no 
true wisdom
 in them. He tells them, that if any will approve himself to be a truly 
wise
 and understand∣ing man, he must by the goodness of his conversation and 
works,
 testifie that there is in him, such a 
wisdom as is accompanied with meekness.
 But if he nou∣rish bitter envying, and strife in his heart, and vent it by his Tongue, he hath no reason to glory and boast of his wisdom; for he does plainly lye against the truth in such vain brags and boastings. Such wisd
m as that, he may assure himself, descendeth not from heaven, but is 
earthly, sensual, devilish.
 For the effects of envy and strife, are 
confusion
 and all manner of evil. But the 
wis∣dom
 that is from 
above
 is first 
pure,
 it will not allow or brook any filthiness, either of sin or error; then 
peaceable,
 not rigid, but gentle, mild, equitable, receding from its own strict right in order to peace; 'Tis also 
gentle,
 and 
mo∣derate,
 and 
persuasible, full of compassions,
 and 
mercy, being fruitful in good works,
 without judging
, or too severely cen∣suring the actions of others, and without hypocrisie. He concludes this wh
le discourse, shewing the happiness of those that have this wisdom, that disposes to peace; for the 
fruit
 of righteousness, which consists in 
peace
, (comprehending in it, all true blessedness) is sown for them that have that meek wisdom, and are of a peaceable disposition themselves, and endeavour to make peace among others. 
From Ver. 13, to the end.


8.
 Having shewed, in the foregoing Chapter, that a false perswasion of their own 
wisdom
 and knowledg, was one great cause of the 
dissentions
 among them, (which were so violent, that they resembled, as it were, 
wars
 and sight∣ings) he comes now to shew 
other causes
 of their 
contentions
 and 
quarrel∣lings,
 which were their 
carnal
 and pleasing 
lusts, viz.
 their 
covetousness, en∣vy,
 and 
pride,
 which warr'd in their members, (that is, in their wills and affections, 
see Rom. 7.23.
), against the motions of the Spirit of God. He tells them, they eagerly and passionately coveted the honours and riches of this world; but yet could not obtain what they desired. They envyed
 and grudged their Neighbours the good things God had given them, yet could not attain to their happiness. They coveted them eagerly, but it no∣thing availed them: They strove and quarrell'd with one another about them, yet obtain'd them not, because they sought them not of G
d by prayer, who is the alone Author and Giver of all blessings. Or if they did sometimes seek to the Lord for them, yet they sought them not in a 
right

 manner,
 nor 
for a right end,
 namely, that they might serve him with them; but they sought them, that they might consume and waste them upon their lusts. Hereupon, he calls them, 
Adulterers
, and 
Adul∣teresses,
 in a spiritual sense; because, the love of the world had alienated and estranged their hearts from the Lord 
[Mat. 12.39.]
 He tells them, that to give up, or engage their affections to the pleasures, profits, and honours of the World, or to seek to gratifie worldly men, or worldly lusts, is reckoned by God as hostility against himself. For friendship with the World
, and conformity to the vices which reign in it, is that which renders a man hate∣full to God, it being a plain siding with his Adversaries. 
From Ver. 1, to 5.


9.
 He dehorts from 
Pride
 and 
Envy.
 He shews them, that 'tis not for no∣thing that the 
Scripture
 speaks to this sense and purpose, though not in express words. 
The Holy Spirit
 
that dwelleth in us, doth it incite or move to envy?
 No, that is impossible; for he, is liberal in his communications of Grace, which forms mens hearts to Humility and Charity, that are con∣trary thereunto. Therefore the Scripture saith, [
Prov. 3.34.
 according to the 
Septuagint], God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
 He advises them therefore, to submit themselves to the gui∣dance and direction of the 
Spirit of God,
 and to re∣sist the 
Devil
 when he tempts them to any of those sinful lusts, and he shall flee from them. He advises them, to seek unto the Lord, and to emplore his aid a∣gainst these lusts by fervent prayer, and to draw nigh to him by true Repentance and Faith; and he will draw nigh to them by his grace, blessing, and help; 
see Zach. 1.3. Mal. 3.7.
 He advises them, to cleanse their 
hands,
 which were full of violence, and extorti∣on; and to purifie their 
hearts,
 which were fill'd with malice, and envy; that is, to look to the reforming both of their inward and outward man. And those of them especially should take care of this, who have hi∣therto been so 
double-minded,
 and have had their hearts as it were divided between 
God
 and the 
world.
 L
stly, he exhorts these 
envious, proud, ambitious, covetous
 persons, to exercise a deep penitential mourning before the Lord for their sins; and to turn their carnal rejoicing in their possessions, into weeping, and mourning at the sad apprehension of the approaching judgments, and to humble themselves in the sight of God, depre∣cating his displeasure, and earnestly imploring his par∣don in Christs name, that so he may, by giving them a sense of his pardoning mercy, raise up their hearts again, and revive and comfort them. 
From Ver, 5. to 11.


10.
 He comes now to disswade them from 
another sin,
 and that is 
detra∣ction,
 or 
speaking evil
 of one another. For he tells them, he that detracts from, or censures his Brother, detracts from the 
Law,
 and judges, or condemns the 
Law,
 which commands us to 
love our Brother,
 and condemneth 
rash judging, Lev. 19.16. M
t. 7.1.
 He therefore that judgeth his Brother, is not an ob
dient observer of the Law, but foolishly arrogates to hims
lf, as it were, a power to judg and controul the 
Law,
 as if it had forbidden some things with∣out just cause. But they are to know, there is but one 
Law-giver,
 who can give Laws to the Conscience, who is God the Lord, 
(Isa. 33.22.);
 into whose

 place, they arrogantly put themselves, who rashly judg their Neighbour, and conse∣quently condemn his Law, that forbids it. Now he tells them, 
this Law-giver
 is the 
only Judg,
 who hath power to save those that obey him, and to destroy those that resist him. What is man therefore, that he should dare to usurp his office by judging his Brother.


11.
 Having reprehended those that contemned the 
Law,
 he now comes to re∣prove those that contemned 
providence,
 promising to themselves a long time in this world, and an happy accomplishment of their carnal projects, without any sense or apprehension of their own frailty, or the sudden strokes of God. He there∣fore here 
person
tes
 them, and gives an accurate representation of their thoughts, shewing how vain their peremptory carnal confidence of success in their affairs, is, seeing no man can foresee, what will be on the morrow; our life being like a vapour appearing for a little time, and oft times on the suddain vanishing away. Therefore there should be a continual acknowledgment of divine providence in their hearts, and such an outward profession of it in their words, as may distinguish them from profane men, who have no sense thereof. But you, says he, glory in th
se your insolent boa
tings, and presumptions, by which you openly publish the wicked stupidity of your hearts. And for you, that are Christians, to be guilty of this, (who have received so much light, and knowledg, to the contrary), this will render you the more inexcusable, and make you more liable to punishment on that account. 
From Ver. 12, to the end.


 
12.
 He now sharply reprehends the 
carnal rich
 men among them, and de∣nounces the judgment of God against them, for their 
Injustice, Intemperance,
 and 
Cruelty.
 He bids them, weep and howl in contemplation of the calamities that hung over their heads, which they could not escape, except they seriously repented. He tells them they had hoarded up 
riches,
 viz. 
Corn, Wine,
 and 
Oyl,
 and such like perishable commodities, till they were corrupted; and had laid up 
Garments,
 that is, 
Silks, wearing Clothes,
 and 
Linnen,
 and such kind of Wares till they were moth-eaten. Their Gold and Silver, they let lye useless by them, and as it were, 
canker
 and 
rust
 in their Chests; and their Garments they suffered to be m
th-eaten, rather than they would employ those their riches to good uses. And he tells them, this 
moth,
 and this 
rust
 will at the day of Judgment be witnesses against them, and of their avarice and covetuousness. And these witnesses shall be turned into tortures, after the last Judgment, when they shall be punished in Hell, wherein their miserable souls, and bodies, shall be preyed on by torments, as by fire; and those cutting reflecti∣ons upon the 
rust
 and 
moth,
 will be bitter and terrible, and gnaw upon their Consciences with a sharp and bitter anguish. And that he may further intimate their folly, he tells them, they had hoarded and heaped up wealth against the 
last days, viz.
 those scattering and fatal days to the 
Jewish
 C
mmonwealth, which were now approaching. All that treasure which with so much wrong to others, and violation of their Consciences, they had heaped together, was but heaped up for the Spoiler, and the violence of the 
Romans.
 And that he may further aggravate their hainous guiltiness, he tells them, that they were not only uncharitable to the poor, and backward to help them, but they were op∣pressors of them, and that oppression of their poor servants, and labourers in de∣frauding them of their wages, cried for vengeance against them, in the ears of the Lord of Hosts; 
see Deut. 24.14, 15.
 But this was not all, he tells them, of another crime they were guilty of, 
viz.
 their 
sensuality,
 charging them for li∣ving like luxurious Gluttons
, making every day a 
Festival
, or a day of sl
ughter, wherein many Beasts were killed for Sacrifice and Food, and a great part of which was reserved for the use of the worship∣per, which he was to carry home, and eat with his friends; 
see Prov. 17.1. Prov. 7.14.
 Lastly, He reproves them, for their tyrannical and oppressing cruelty,

 in procuring, by their power and authority, the condemnation and destruction of the 
Just
, they not resisting them, nor having any means to defend them∣selves against their violence
. 
From Ver. 1, to 7.


13.
 Having thus shewed, how the 
wicked rich
 men shall be punished for their wickedness, and oppr
ssi
n; he c
mes now to comfort the 
poor faithful
 Brethren that were oppressed by them, and to exhort them to exercise patience under their sufferings, till Christ should come to execute vengeance on the obdu∣rate 
Jews
 in the destruction of their City 
J
h. 21.22.
 This he presseth from the examples of the husbandmans waiting for the fruit of the earth, and from his patient expecting, in order to that, both the showers that come in the Seed∣time to fit the ground, and for those that come before Harvest, or Reaping, to plump the Corn. So, he tells them, they should be patient, and encourage their hearts, because 
that Coming
 of Christ before mentioned, was near at hand. He further exhorts th
m, not 
nly to bear those injuries patiently, which they re∣ceiv'd from wicked rich men, but those also which th
y suffered from divers of their Brethren, who together with th
m did profess the holy Faith. He advises th
m, that they should not in a groaning
 manner require vengeance against them from the hand of God, but 
forgive
 them; otherwise they had great rea∣son to expect to be judged, and punished by Christ the Judg, whose coming was so nigh, that they might as it were say, 
He was at the gate.
 And that he may yet further perswade them to patience, he sets before them, the example of the 
Prophets,
 who, though dear to God, and employed to speak to the people from him, (and so might seem sheltred under the Buckler of their special Com∣mission), yet were exercised with 
many
 and 
sharp afflictions;
 and therefore, why should 
they
 promise themselves freedom and exemption? He assures them, that himself, and the other Apostles, did esteem and look upon those, as blessed persons, who did patiently bear those trials and afflictions, the Lord was plea∣s
d to exercise them with. And to confirm what he had said, he sets before them the instance of 
Job,
 who having patiently endured very sore afflictions, at last God mad
 a very gracious end with him, giving him 
double
 to all that he had lost, 
Job 42.10.
 From whence it appears, that God is far from despi∣sing us in our 
fflictions, and that he is a God of tender bowels and compassions. 
From Ver. 7, to 12.


14.
 In the next place, he seriously dehorts them from 
rash
 and 
unnecessary swearing,
 or swearing by Creatures,
 which (it seems) was too common a∣mong the 
Jews
 at that time. He forbids them to use any unlawful or unne∣cessary Oath; but in their ordinary converse, barely to 
affirm,
 or 
deny,
 without adding any Oath thereto, l
st they bring upon themselves the judgment
 of God. 
Ver. 12.


15.
 He comes now to direct them, how to behave themselves, both in an 
afflicted
 and in a 
prosperous
 condition, and especially in time of 
sickness.
 In affliction, he tells them, their duty is 
prayer;
 in 
prosperity,
 their duty is 
giving of thanks
, or singing to Gods praise. And when any of them are 
sick,
 he advises them, to send for the

 
Elders
 of the Church to pray over th
m, and if th
y have the gift of healing
, (which at that time, was given to some 
Teachers
 and 
Elders, see 1 Cor. 12.9.
), that they should anoint them with Oyl
, calling upon the Name of Christ, who is the Au∣thor of all such miraculous healing, 
see Act. 3.16.
 This gift our Saviour was pleased should accompany the prea∣ching of his Gospel in those primitive times, for the confirmation of it; but now it is ceased since the Gos∣pel is sufficiently confirmed. He further tells them, that the prayer thus made to the Lord, by the 
Elders,
 and by the 
sick person,
 proceeding out of a 
true Faith,
 shall be a means of saving, and recovering the sick per∣son from that distemper, except when it pleaseth God otherwise to order it, for his own glory, and the good of the sick person. He further adds, that if any 
special sin
 hath drawn down this disease upon this sick person, it shall, upon the earnest prayers of the 
El∣ders,
 and the 
Repentance,
 and 
Faith
 of the sick person, be remitted; so that his disease shall be removed. Therefore he advises them, in such cases, to 
con∣fess
 their sins one to another, that they might more 
particularly,
 and 
perti∣n
ntly
 pray one for another, mutually succouring one another by their counsel, and prayers, under the wounds and burdens of Conscience, that so both the wounds of their Consciences, and the maladies of their bodies may be healed. And for their encouragement, he tells th
m, that the 
effectual fervent
 
prayer of a righteous man availeth much,
 that is, the prayer wrought, and excited in him by the Spirit of God, and which proceeds from the vehemency of an earnest spirit, and fervent affections. This he further proves to them, by instancing in 
Elias,
 who was a man subject to like passions with us; and if he obtained so much of God by prayer, that he 
shut
 and 
opened
 the 
Heavens
, that is, the 
Clouds, [see Luc. 4.25. Deut. 11.17.],
 surely our fervent prayers shall not be in vain. 
From Ver. 13, to 19.


Lastly, From 
Prayer,
 he passes to another Christian office, 
viz. Admonition,
 exhorting them, to do what they can to reduce and convert an 
erring Brother, viz
 that errs either in 
Faith
 or 
Manners;
 whereby they will be instruments in Gods hand of saving a soul from eternal death; and procure that God may cover and hide his sins, that is, remove them out of the sight of his justice
, and not impute them to his condemnation. 
From Ver. 19, to the end.








SECT. VI.


THE 
Philippians
 about this time, send 
Epaphroditus,
 one of their Teachers, to 
Rome,
 to visit 
Paul,
 and to carry him some moneys which they had gathered for his maintenance. He being come, joined himself to the Apostle, both as an Helper, and a fellow-Soldier in the cause of Christ. Whilst he was there, he fell into a grievous sickness, so that he was nigh unto death. 
See Philip.
 2.25, 26, 27, 30. and 
Philip.
 4.10, 14, 18.






SECT. VII.


PAƲL
 being now aged, and still a Prisoner, converts, and gains to Christ, 
Onesimus,
 a Servant that had run a∣way from his Master 
Philemon,
 at 
Colosse.
 By which 
Onesimus,
 he writes an Epistle to 
Philemon
 at 
Colosse,
 a City not far from 
Laodicea
 in 
Phrygia.


The occasion of the Epistle was this. 
Philemon,
 one of the 
Colossian
 Pastors, had a Servant, (
Onesimus
 by name), who not abiding his Masters service any longer, watched his time, and ran away; and as it seems, did not run away empty, but also purloined something. Having run up and down from place to place, at last, by the special providence of God, he comes to 
Rome,
 where now 
Paul
 was a Prisoner for Christ, and preached the Gospel in bonds. Among other Fish, that 
that great Fisher of men
 caught, with the spreading 
Net
 of the Gospel, this poor 
fugitive
 was one; who being converted, and brought to a sa∣ving-knowledg of Christ, he for some time ministred to 
Paul
 in Prison. But the Apostle, because he was another mans servant, (and particularly, his dear friend 
Philemon
's), and of right belonged to him, being his 
lawful possession,
 and as it were 
his mony,
 (as the Law speaks, 
Exod.
 21.21.), he would not de∣tain him from him, without his free consent. He therefore sends him back to his Master, earnestly desiring him to pardon him, and to receive him into favour again. And because the Holy Ghost in this matter gives a remarkable instance of Gods 
free-grace to sinners;
 and intimates our duty towards those that are 
penitent,
 therefore, for the perpetual edification of the Church, he would have this be received among the other Ca∣nonical Epistles.




In the Epistle there are three parts,




1. The 
Preface.


2. The 
Matter
 of the Epistle.


3. The 
Conclusion.




1.
 IN the 
Preface,
 the Apostle joins his Brother 
Timothy
 with him, as one He that concurred with him in his request to 
Philemon.


He also salutes 
Apphia,
 (probably the Wife of 
Philemon
); and 
Archip∣pus,
 one of the Pastors of the Church, 
[Col. 4.17.],
 whom he calls, his 
fel∣low-Soldier
 in the spiritual warfare of the Gospel. He salutes also the 
Saints
 in 
Philemon
's Family. To all these, he wishes abundance of grace and peace from God the Father, the Fountain of all Blessings; and from Jesus the Medi∣ator, who is the Conduit-pipe, by whom they are conveyed. And in the first place, he tells them, how he rejoiced and blessed God for the report he heard of his 
Faith
 in Christ, and 
love
 to all his 
Saints;
 and he daily prayed for him, that his 
liberality,
 and 
readiness to communicate to such as are in want,
 being a fruit of his Faith, and springing from it, might be an effectual means to in∣duce others to take notice of, and acknowledg (to the praise of God) those good things that were in him, and his Family; namely, their 
kindness
 and 
love
 towards 
Christ
, and his 
Members.
 And he assures him, he was much com∣forted by the report of that great 
Love
 and 
Charity
 of his, whereby the bowels of the poor Saints were refreshed. 
From Ver. 1, to 8.


2.
 He comes to the Matter of the Epistle, in which he requests 
Philemon
 to take 
Onesimus
 his fugitive. Servant into savour again; whom he had, during his imprisonment, through the assistance of grace, converted to Christ. He tells him, that though he might by vertue of his Apostleship received from Christ, 
in∣join him,
 and other Christians, what he judged convenient; yet he rather chose to request this of him, upon the score of love; and be doubted not, but that he would do that for 
Paul
 now 
aged,
 and in bonds for Christ, which he under∣st
od would be acceptable unto him. He intreats him therefore, to receive 
One∣simus
 again, whom (since his conversion) he loved as if he were his own Son. I acknowledg, says he, that formerly, 
Onesimus
 was not 
Onesimus,
 that is, 
profitable
 to thee, as his name signifies; but now he will approve himself a useful and diligent servant to thee, as he hath been to me. Therefore I have sent him back again to thee, and intreat thee to receive him, 
as my own bowels,
 th
t is, to entertain him with all kindness, as one very dearly beloved by me. Indeed I w
uld gladly have kept him here still with me, that he might have done all those good offices and services for me, (while I am here in Prison for the cause of Christ), which I know thou wouldst willingly do, if th
u wert here. But without thy consent I would not do it, that thy kindness in aff
rding him to me, may be perfectly free, and not, as it were, extorted from thee. And for his leaving of thee so injuriously, thou oughtest to pass that over, because there may come great advantage to thee thereby. For it seems, he was by the spe∣ci
l providence of God permitted thus to run away from thee, for a little while that by the conversion wrought on him, (to which his flight gave occasion), he might be an useful Servant to thee afterwards, all his life along
. Receive

 him therefore now, not as a Servant only, but more than so, receive him as a 
faithful Brother
 in Christ, and as one that is very dear to me, and therefore he ought to be much more so to thee, and that not only in respect of those outward and bodily services which he may perform for thee, but because he believes in Christ. If therefore thou account me thy companion in the Faith, and in the mi∣nistry of the Word; deny me not this request, but receive 
Onesimus
 as thou w
uldst do my self, if I should come unto thee. If thou hast sustained any loss by him, or if he oweth thee any thing, put that on my account. I hereby engage to th
e, under my own hand, that I will satisfie thee for it. Yet I may tell thee, th u ow
st more to me (being converted by my Ministry) than all this amounts to; I say, thou owest to me (under God) thy conversion, and so oughtest to look upon me as a prime instrument of thy eternal well-being, and salvation. Therefore (dear Brother) let me obtain this kindness from thee (for the Lords sake), which will much rejoice me; yea indeed, in a matter so agreeable to the mind of the Lord, refuse not to refresh my bowels, and comfort me. I have written to thee, being confident thou wilt hearken to me, and grant me my request, yea that thou wilt sh
w more favour to 
Onesimus
 than I have desired of thee.


To Conclude, I am in hope
, that through your prayers, and the intercessi
ns of other Christians for me, I shall be d
livered out of these bonds, and shall be gi∣v
n t
 y
u again. Therefore prepare me a lodging a∣gainst that time. My Companions here salute thee. The grace of Jesus Christ (both as to the effects, and sense of it) reside in your souls and spirits
. 
Amen. From Ver. 18, to the end.








SECT. VIII.


EPaphroditus
 having now recovered his health, and being to return to the 
Philippians,
 by him 
Paul
 in his own and 
Timothy
's name writes an Epistle to them. For having under∣stood by 
Epaphroditus
 their spiritual state and condition, he thought fit to write to them, (which he does in a most affe∣ctionate manner).


1. To confirm them in the Faith, and to prevent their be∣ing offended at his sufferings for the Gospel.


2. To encourage them to walk worthy of the Gospel, es∣pecially in 
unity,
 and 
lowliness of mind.


3. To warn them against 
Seducers
 who mingled works with Faith in the matter of Justification.


4. To quicken them to divers Christian duties.


And Lastly, To Testifie his exceeding thankfulness to them for the relief they had now sent him.


In the Epistle there are there three parts,




1. The 
Preface.


2. The 
Body
 of the Epistle.


3. The 
Conclusion.




1. IN the 
Preface,
 He joins 
Timothy
 with him in this his address, because he was his Companion, when he came formerly to them, and had assisted in the instructing of them, and was a person much valued by them. He tells them, that 
they both
 sent this Epistle to all the Saints that compos'd the Church at 
Philippi,
 (who were called to believe in Christ, and by their union with him derived grace and holiness from him), and in particular to the 
Pastors
 and 
Overseers
 of their Church, and to the 
Deacons
, that is, such who being join'd to the Pa∣stors were to inspect the manners of the Church-mem∣bers, and to serve the Church in taking care of the poor. To all these he wisheth abundance of grace and peace, from God 
the Father,
 who is the Fountain and Source of all grace and spiritual blessings, and from 
Jesus Christ
 the Me∣diator, by whose merits and intercession we obtain them. 
Ver. 1, 2.


2.
 He comes to the body of the Epistle, wherein in the 
first place,
 that he might shew, how dear they were unto him, he informs them, that when ever they came to his remembrance, especially in prayer, he could not but bless God for them, and make mention of them with joy. The reasons of which were,


1.
 That they had been brought to a participation of the Gospel, (whereby they were brought into fellowship with Christ and his Church), and they had

 been constant in the profession of it from the first day of their vocation even until now. 
2.
 Because he was confident, that God who had begun a work 
f grace in them would carry it on, and perfect it more and more until the day
 wherein Christ shall come, and take them to himself out of this world. 
3.
 He shews, that it was but reasonable, that he should have this good opi∣nion and hope of them, for he had them in his heart, and remembred
 them both in his bonds, and all his suffering, for the defence and maintenance of the Gospel, as 
those
 that were partakers of the same grace bestowed on himself, and as 
those
 that were ready to suffer fore Christ as he was
: And therefore he solemnly protests, that he bears a most entire love
 and affection to them, wrought in him by Christ, and such as is like unto th
t (as to its fervency and sincerity) which Christ Jesus himself bears to those that are his members. And he earnestly prays that their love to God, and to one another, may more and more abound, together with a more full know∣ledg of spiritual things, and a sense
 and taste of Gods love in Christ towards themselves. And that they may be endued with a 
spirit of discerning,
 and be able to try things that differ, and discern 
truth
 from 
error, good
 from 
evil,
 and may chuse and approve that which is most excellent; and further, that they may be 
sincere
 and walk inoffensively, till the day of Christ, in which he shall take them to himself out of this world. And Lastly, that they may be full of 
good works,
 and may bring forth all those fruits of righteousness, which spring from Faith in Christ, and tend to the glory of God, as their main aim and end. 
From Ver. 3, to Ver. 12.


3.
 He removes the scandal they might take at his present sufferings, which he shews, tended rather to the furtherance than the hinderance of the Gospel.


For first, his bonds for Christ were famous in 
Nero
's Court, and several o∣ther places 
in
 and 
near Rome,
 and people inquiring into the cause of his suf∣ferings did learn somewhat of Christ and the Gospel by that means.


2.
 Many of the Brethren in the Ministry of Christ, having heard of his constancy under his sufferings, were encouraged to shake off all fear, and to preach Christ more boldly than ever. 'Tis true, he acknowledges, that some did preach Christ out of a spirit of 
envy
 against him, envying th
 success God gave to his ministry, and endeavoured to get that glory to themselves, and to draw people from approving him, to applaud them; supposing to gall and grieve him there∣by. And some preached Christ out of a 
pious in
ent,
 desi
ing sincerely to maintain, and confirm what he had preached, and out of true love to Christ, and to himself his 
prisoner,
 knowing that Christ had appointed him an Apostle, and that for the defence of the Gospel he now lay in prison. Yet notwithstanding by 
both
 ways, Christ was preached and made known; by some in 
pretence,
 by others in 
truth,
 and that was it which comforted him and made him rejoice.


3.
 These afflictions he met with, he was confident would tend to the further∣ance of his salvation, through the help of their prayers, and the supply of grace from the Spirit of Christ. And (he tells them) he trusts, that according to his former expectation and hope, no terror should ever make him asham'd to own the truth of Christ, but with all boldness he should avow it, and that Christ should be magnified by him in the 
body,
 whether his life be further prolonged, or ended by martyrdom. For the case stood thus with him, If he 
lived,
 Christ should be the 
scope
 of his life, and he intended to live to his service; if

 he dyed, death would be an unspeakable advantage t
 him
 but if he lived longer in this mortal body, he foresaw this would be the fruit of his labours, 
viz.
 The gaining of Souls to Christ. Yet what to chuse he knew not. For he was in a straight, whether he should desire to dye
, and be with Christ, which was b
tter for him; or to live 
longer,
 which was more needful for them. And being satisfied of the great need they had of him, and the benefit they might reap from his life, he tells them, that this is the thing that he is sure he desires; and hopes, and upon probable conjecture was confident
 of, that he should yet be permitted to live, and to pass some part of his life among them, for the fur∣therance of their Faith, and augmentation of their joy and comfort, that they might have more abundant matter of rejoicing in Christ, having received a new proof of his power, and good-will towards them, in delivering 
him, their Apo∣postle,
 from death, and sending him to them again. 
From Vers. 12, to 27.


4.
 He exhorts them, that whatever should befall him, they would mind their duty, and behave themselves as becometh the Gospel, ordering their conversation according to the Precepts of Christ, and jointly contending the best they can, with p
rf
ct unity, and joint stedfastness of mind, to maintain and defend the Faith of Christ, which w
uld be matter of great joy to him, whether he came and saw it, (as he hop'd he should), or only heard of it, being absent. And what∣ever opposition or persecutions they met with in this course, he bids them not suffer themselves to be discourag'd or affrighted at them, seeing they were great signs that their adversaries (who brought them upon them) were in the way of perditi
n, and that they who suffered such things patiently for Christs sake, and the G
spel, were in the way of salvation; they portended destruction to their adversaries, but through Gods gracious disposing, they should promote their sal∣vation.


And this should further encourage them, that as 
grace to believe in Christ,
 so also 
grace to suffer couragiously for him
 and 
his truth,
 was a part of Christs purchase for them, and for his sake given unto them: And hereby they had communion and co-partnership with him (their Apostle) in afflictions, who suffered many hard things at 
Philippi,
 and elsewhere, as they themselves had seen, and at this present suffered bonds at 
Rome. From Ver. 27, to the end.


 
5.
 He comes now to exhort these 
Philippians
 to 
unity
 and 
concord
 among themselves; and that he might more effectually perswade them thereunto, he con∣jures them that if ever th
y had found any consolation in Christ, if any com∣f
rt of mutual love, if any fellowship with God by the communication of the graces of his Spirit, if they had any pity or compassion on him, a Prisoner for Christ; He 
ntreats and obtests them by all these, and as they would give proof of all th
se, that to all the other matter of rejoicing which he had concerning th
m, they would add this also, (and so make his joy complete), namely, to live in unity among themselves, having as it were the same mind and judgment, the same will and affections, and minding and carrying on the same designs. He exh
rts them, not to do any thing out of opposition or contention one against ano∣ther, nor out of vain glory or ambition; but to carry themselves with all humility and lowliness of mind, as if they had every one a better opinion of anothers wisdom, and goodness than of his own; and to this end they should not look so intently on those gifts and abilities which they discern in themselves, but withall, and much rather, should consider the gifts and abilities of others more eminent than themselves. And if they would but esteem others 
more,
 and themselves 
less;
 this would tend to frame their minds to humility. And that he might press them effectually to the practice of this virtue, he sets before them thē example

 of Christ, who being from all eternity 
true God,
 and being in the 
form,
 that is, having the 
form
 or 
essence
 of God, and the natural properties of the Dei∣ty, so that he thought it no encroachment or usurpation to reckon himself in equa∣lity with his Father, (the same glory and m
jesty justly belonging to him), yet did He empty himself of that divine glory, which befo
e he had, not by cea∣sing to be what he 
was,
 but by assuming som
thing to himself which before he had not, to wit, the humane Nature. In which respect, being n
w 
God m
n
 and 
M
diator,
 he is less than the Father, 
Joh.
 14.28. And therefore on this account he emptied hims
lf, and divested himself of the Robes of his Majesty, and from being Lord of all, he l
ssened and humbled himself to the c
nditi
n of an ordinary man, yea of a 
servant;
 and He was made in the 
likeness
 of men, that is, like to one of us in the 
essential
 parts of humane Nature, to wit, of Soul and Body; and was found in fashion as a man, the truth and reality of his humane Nature being evidently known unto those who did converse with him, by the fashion and proportion of his body, and the whole strain of his carriage and actions. And b
sides the humbling himself thus l
w in his incarnation, he humbled himself yet lower afterwards, even to suffer the vilest and most c
u
l death, (which was in use among the 
Romans,
 and inflicted only on their Slaves), to wit, the death of the Cross. And because he humbled himself so low, G
d hath highly exalted him in his 
Resurrection, Ascension,
 and 
placing 
im at his right hand in Heaven;
 and hath given him a 
Name,
 that is, hath exalted him to a 
Dignity
 which is above all other Names and Dignities, to wit, he hath made him 
King
 and 
Head
 of his Church, and given him all power in Heaven and Earth, and installed him in the possessi
n and administr
tion of his heavenly Kingdom, (wherein his divine Majesty, which had been eclips
d before, doth now shine forth in full glory), and hath appointed that the divine honour, due to God only, should be given to him, 
(compare Isa 45.23 with Rom. 14.10, 11.),
 and that all 
reasonable Creatures,
 in whatsoever place of the created World they be, whether in 
Heaven, E
rth
, or 
Hell;
 yea and all men which are dead and in the graves, should at the 
Resurrection,
 and 
day of Judg∣ment,
 worship him as the 
true God,
 and express and testifie their subjection to him, (some willingly, others by constraint), when they come to stand at his Tribunal, to receive their doom; and that all Nations and people should confess 
Christ crucified
 to be 
Lord
 and 
Judg
 of the World, acknowledging his dominion and soveraignty, and that to the honour of the Father, who hath sent him, and who will be glori∣fied in the glory of his 
Son.
 Therefore seeing Christ thus humbled himself, to make peace for 
lost man
 with God, and afterwards was highly exalted by God, and crown'd with glory; so proportionably may they expect to be exalted and re∣warded by God, if they humble themselves, that they m
y maintain and preserve the Churches peace and concord. 
From Ver. 1, to 12.


6.
 He exhorts them, that they would still shew themselves obedient to his Pre∣cepts and not only as they had done
 when he was present with them, but now much more in his absence, that it may appear, that 
love
 to the truths of Christ sway'd them, and not any other respect. And particularly, he exhorts th
m, to 
work out their own salvation with fear and tremb
ing,
 that is, 
carefully
 and 
diligently
 to practise all those means that God hath appointed for the accomplishing their salvation, shaking off security, and carnal confidence, and not trusting in their own strength and power, but humbly imploring the assi∣stance of Gods grace. For 'tis 
he
 alone who works in us both to 
will th
t which is good,
 and 
enabl
s us to perform it.
 And because the nature of man, (as 'tis now corrupt) is prone t
 murmur against the providence of God, and to dispute his will and command, H
 adviseth t
m, to do all their actions 
so
 as those that do acquiesce in the good will of G
d, and to take heed of h
t

 and eager disputings among themselves concerning things that do not concern the 
vitals
 of Religion. And they should be the more careful to carry themselves thus, that they may approve themselves 
blameless
 and 
harmless,
 walking as the Children of God in a corrupt age, among whom they should shine as 
lights
 in the World; holding forth, in their profession and practice, the way to eternal life reveal'd in the Gospel, that those 
Pagans
 among whom th
y lived, might fall in love with it; and that he himself may have cause of r
joicing in their sal∣vation, at the day of Judgment, because his labours under God had so much pro∣moted it. And he assures them, that their 
eternal Salvation
 was a thing so earnestly, and so affectionately desir'd by him, that if, as in the Law the 
Wine
 was poured out on the Sacrifice, so his 
Blood
 (like Wine) should be poured out as an additional offering to confirm their Faith, (whom he had by his preaching and ministry brought to consecrate and offer up themselves as a living Sacrifice to God); he would rejoice therein for their sakes, and of all the faith∣ful to whom the fruit of his death should redound; and he desires them to rejoice with him, that he was so minded. 
From Ver. 12, to 19.


7.
 He declares his purpose of sending 
Timothy
 to them to know their state, as soon as he shall see how it will go with himself. For he expected a comfort∣able account of them by him, at his return. He tells them, he had no man with him, who might be compar'd with him in affection to them, or who did more sin∣cerely regard their spiritual good. For others (as it seems) that were at this present at 
Rome,
 refused to undertake so long and tedious a journey; but 
Ti∣mothy
 was willing to undertake it, and whilst others
 minded their own 
private concerns,
 He minded the advancement of the 
Interest
 of Christ. And he tells them, that they themselves have had great proofs of his sincerity when he was with them, and know how in the preaching of the Gospel he had rendred to him (their Apo∣stle) all the service and assistance he could, and that with like affection as a good Son renders to his Father. And he tells them, that he not only intended to send 
Timothy
 to them, but hoped (through the goodness of God) to be at liberty shortly, and to come to them himself. However in the mean time he thought it needful to return unto them 
Epaphroditus
 their Pastor who hath been his partner in lab
ur and danger, since they had sent him to him, to relieve him in his necessities. And one reason why he sent him back was, be∣cause of his 
great pastoral affection
 unto them. He being exceedingly disquieted to think, what sorrow the report of his sickness had brought unto them: and he sent him the rather, that they might be comforted in seeing him recover'd, who had been so nigh unto death. But he tells them, God shewed much mercy to 
Epaphroditus
 in recovering of him, and not to him only, but to himself (their Apostle) also, in not adding one grief to another, 
viz. Epaphroditus
's death, to his imprisonment. He sent him also the more readily, that his own trouble might be somewhat removed, which accrued to him on consideration, that their Minister, (whose company they so much desired) had been so long detained from them on his account. He exhorts them therefore to receive him with such an affection as they ought to express towards the faithful Servants of the Lord
, and to give all due honour and respect unto him, and to all such Ministers as he was, because he had hazzarded his life for the service of Christ, being less careful of himself, than of the Apostles welfare, and because he had done what lay in him that nothing necessary should be wanting to him; and so did 
that,
 which they themselves by reason of their absence, and far distance, were not able to do. 
From Ver. 19, to the end.


 
8.
 Intending now to warn them to beware of those 
false Teachers,
 who in the point of justification mingled the righteousness of 
works
 with that which is 
by Faith in Christ;
 he first exhorts them, to 
rejoice
 in Christ Jesus as the

 only Author and Purchaser of our Peace; and that they would joyfully rely up∣on his 
Righteousness, Merit,
 and 
Intercession,
 and not seek for any other way of Salvation out of him. He excuses himself for inculcating the same instructi∣ons so often, seeing it was safe and convenient for them that he should so do; for he could not too often press them to close with Christ, and the Doctrine of his 
all suffi∣cient Righteousness
 and 
Merit.
 He comes then directly to warn them to be∣ware of these false Apostles, whom he calls 
Dogs,
 (for their barking against the sincere Doctrine of the Gospel, and the faithful Preachers of it), and 
evil-Workers,
 (because under pretence of building up the Church, they did what in them lay to destroy it, and were besides (as it seems) men of wicked lives). He calls them also 
the Concision,
 alluding to 
Circumcision,
 whereof they gave out themselves to be Patrons and Defenders, and call'd themselves by it; but he ta∣keth that name from them, and calls them, 
the Concision;
 as if he should say, the 
D
stroyers
 and 
Renters
 of the Church. He shews, that not 
they,
 but him∣self, and other true Believers, had right to that Title of 
Circumcision,
 they only having the 
thing
 signified thereby. For first, They worshipped God with the in∣ward spiritual affections of a renewed heart. 
2.
 They trusted in Christ Jesus a∣lone, as the Substance of all the Types and Shaddows in the Old Testament, and rejoi∣ced in him, as the 
only
 and 
all-sufficient
 Saviour of mankind. 
3.
 They renoun∣ced confidence in any outward Priviledg, (such as the Circumcision of the flesh was), or in any thing else besides Christ. 
From Ver. 1, to 4.


9.
 Intending to demonstrate the vanity of relying upon any thing besides Christ for Justification; he sheweth, he had as much to boast of upon the account of outward Priviledges (such as the Circumcision of the flesh), as any of those 
false Teach∣ers
 had, if he had found it safe to venture his Salvation on such a bottom. He was circumcised the eighth day after his birth, as 
Isaac
 and his posterity were. He was of the Stock of 
Israel,
 and so no Proselyte, or Convert from among the 
Gen∣tiles.
 He was of the Tribe of 
Benjamin,
 and so came of that Tribe which with the Tribe of 
Judah
 clave to the house of 
David,
 and the true worship of God at 
Jerusalem,
 after the revolt of the Ten Tribes; and if he had a mind to speak of the ancientness and nobility of his Stock; he might say, he was a 
Hebrew
 of the 
Hebrews,
 descended by both his Parents of 
Abrahams
 Race, (called the 
He∣brew, Gen. 14.13
), and from 
Eb
r,
 of whom the 
Jews
 were called 
Ebrews,
 who lived before the confusion of Tongues at 
Babel, Gen. 14 13, 20, 21, 25.
 And he was not an ordinary 
Ebrew
 or 
Jew
 neither, but of the strictest Sect a∣mong them, even a 
Pharisee,
 which Sect were for a severer interpretation, and stricter observation of the Law than the rest of the 
Jews, Act. 26.5.
 And as a signal Testimony of his great zeal to the 
Law,
 and the 
Jewish Religion,
 he had been a violent Persecutor of the Christian Church, whom he look'd upon as enemies thereto. And lastly, As to his personal obedience and observance of the Law, he was able to say as much as another, his Conversation having been so blameless be∣fore men, that it could not be justly taxed by them. But however when he was in his unconverted state, he had relyed on these things for Salvation, and count∣ed them great advantages in order thereunto, yet now being savingly enlightned, he saw that nothing could redound to him by trusting in them, but real hurt and damage, and therefore he had taken his confidence off from them, and wholly pla∣ced it on Christ; yea he did not only esteem them so when he was first con∣verted, but did so still. For he could not but account all such things by which men seek salvation out of Christ, 
detrimental
 and 
hurtful,
 so far as they keep them from closing with him. He could not but account them l
ss, not only be∣cause they can not effect 
that,
 for which men do rely upon them; but because their high esteem of them, and confidence in them, hinders them from embracing Christ. He tells them, therefore that he undervalued and disesteem'd them all, in com∣parison of that excellent knowledg of Christ, which draws the heart effectually to close with him, and by a lively Faith and affiance to rely on him, and to take him for its Lord and Saviour. And for this blessed Saviours sake, he tells them,

 it was, that he had forsak
n 
Friends, Countrey,
 and all things that could be dear to him in this World, when he first betook himself to the preaching of the Gospel, and still counted them as 
dung,
 in comparison of gaining the favour of Christ, and of being found at the day of Judgment ingrafted into him by Faith, and a real member of him, and one that did n
t rely on his 
own righteousness,
 (such as m
n endeavour to acquire by the observation of the Commandments of the Law), but on 
that righteousness
 which men are made partakers of 
by Faith,
 when they believe in Christ, and which results from his 
active
 and 
pas∣sive
 obedience, and which God freely and graciously imputes to all true Believers for their Justification. And he intimates, how easily he could bear those fore∣mentioned l sses for an 
experimental knowledg
 and 
sense
 of Christs grace work∣ing in him; particularly, that he might feel in himself, that 
power
 whereby Christ was raised from death to life; raising him daily more and more to newness of life, and that he might taste the comfort that ariseth from fellowship with him in his sufferings, suffering for him and with him in his mystical Body, 
(Col. 1 24.),
 being made thereby conformable to his death, by mortifying inward corruptions, and bearing the Cross for him. And he tells them, he shall not grudg at that, if he may by any means (though with some difficulty), attain un∣to the 
resurrection of the dead
, that is, unto that perfection of holiness, which accompanies and attends the 
resurrection of the just, 1 Thes. 4.14.
 He acknowledges he had not as yet attained to that degree of holiness, nor look'd upon himself as already perfect, or as one that had already won the prize and rich reward, which is given at the end of the race. But he was in his Christian race, and pursued after that prize with great desire and diligence, and hop'd as∣suredly to obtain it, not by his own strength, but by th
 assistance of Christ, who for that end laid hold on him, (as he was in the way going to 
Damascus
 to per∣secute the Christians), and effectually call'd and converted him, and brought him into the way of Salvation. He says again, that he dare not affirm, that he had attained to the state of perfection, but he was as the 
Racer
 running his race, not casting his eye back, or being satisfied with what he had done, or with so much of the way as he had overcome, but stretching as hard as he could to get the goal, or end of the race, that so he may obtain the prize, 
viz.
 the prize of eternal Glo∣ry, which shall be given to them to whom God vouchsafes that high favour effe∣ctually to call them to a participation of the merits and righteousness of his Son Jesus Christ. 
From Ver. 4; to 15.


10.
 He exhorts those who were more grown Christians, (and being compar'd with others 
less knowing,
 might be called 
perfect
), to agree, and be alike mind∣ed in his proposed Doctrine, namely, to 
renounce all carnal confidences,
 and to rest in Christs Righteousness alone, and by virtue derived from him, to labour to grow daily more and more in grace and holiness. And if any among them, being seduced by 
false Teachers,
 were of a contrary mind in some things, (as namely, that the 
Ceremonial Law
 was not wholly abr
gated, 
&c.
), he gives ground of hope
, that God (who had brought them to the knowledg of the Gospel) would reclaim them from this their error, and discover unto them the danger of it. However he exhorts all lovers of 
truth
 and 
peace
 among them to an orderly walking, according to the rule of the Scriptures, in those things wherein they were agreed, preserving mutual love, and avoiding further rents and divisions. He exhorts them also, to be followers of 
him,
 and to observe those that 
did so,
 taking them for their patterns and examples. For he tells them, there were ma∣ny 
false Teachers
 who walk'd otherwise, whose example was not to be followed; of whom he had often warn'd them, and could not but now again (though with grief of heart) acquaint them, that by their pressing, 
b
sides Faith in Christ,
 the 
observation
 of the Levitical Ceremonies, and the works of the Law, as ne∣cessary to Salvation, they undermin'd the Doctrine of the Cross, and really op∣pos'd the 
virtue, power,
 and 
merit
 of Christs passion, 
[see Gal. 5.2.].
 But the end of those Impostors, without repentance, he shews, will be very sad, who

 minded nothing so much as pleasing their sensual appetites
, boasting of those things whereof they ought to be ashamed, (
viz.
 their corrupting the Gospel), and savouring only earthly things. But as for himself, and those that followed his example, their carriage was far different. For 
our conversation
 (says he) 
is in Heaven,
 where Christ our Lord and Head is; whom we expect to c
me one day from thence, to our unspeakable comfort; and who will change our vile Bodies
, and make them like to his own glorious Body; which change he will effect by that divine and almighty power of his, whereby he will destroy death, and the grave, and can do all things possible to divine omnipotency; and there∣f
re can and will bring about the resurrection and glorious change of our Bodies. 
From Ver. 15, to the end.


11.
 He comes now, towards the close of his Epistle, to exhort them to the pra∣ctice 
 of several Christian vertues. And, 
1.
 having testified how affectionately he loved them, and how much he desir'd and long'd after their spiritual welfare, (and how their Faith and Conversion was matter of great joy and comfort unto him, yea the crown and honour of his Ministry); he exhorts them, (in the general), to continue and stand fast in the Doctrine of Christ, according as he had taught them.


2.
 He particularly exhorts 
Euodias
 and 
Syntyche,
 two eminent women in that Church, (who, as it seems, in some matters relating to Religion disagreed), to concord and agreement between themselves, it being a thing very agreeable to the will of the Lord. And he intreats one that was sometime his 
fellow-labou∣rer
 in that Church, to help those fore-mentioned women to accord their difference, and to agree; and the rather because they had been useful to him, (in their places), whilst he was preaching the Gospel, and planting a Church there
; as 
Clement,
 and some other private Christians had also been, whom he judged to be truly gracious persons, and such as were to be reckon'd in the number of Gods Elect
, they giving such evident signs and testimonies thereof.


3.
 He exhorts them, To 
rejoice in Christ
 at all 
times,
 and in all 
conditi∣ons,
 raising up their hearts to a due consideration of his 
excellencies
 and 
be∣nefits,
 and feeding upon the sense and sweetness of them. For a 
Believer
 hath always ground of rejoicing in Christ, though not in the world, nor in himself.


4.
 He exhorts them, To exercise 
moderation, equity,
 and 
mildness,
 in their dealings with all men, because the Lord is nigh and present to judg all our actions, and his coming to judgment is not far off, at which time he will render to every one according to their works.


5.
 He exhorts them, To beware of anxious, heart-cutting, distrustful 
care
 a∣bout worldly things, or the 
success
 of what they undertake in their lawful cal∣lings; and for prevention of that, to disburden all their cares and troubles into the bosom of the Lord, by humble 
prayer,
 not forgetting also to praise him for all his benefits. And 
that,
 he tells them, is the way to have that sweet 
peace,
 which is wrought by the Spirit of God, to dwell in their hearts, (which none can conceive who have not experienced and felt, and those who have, cannot suffi∣ciently express it), which will (through the assistance of Christ) guard and keep them fr
m being overcome with inordinate cares, or such passions as the appre∣he
sion of l
sses and injuries usually stir up in men.


6.
 He exhorts them, that whatever things had 
truth, candor,
 and 
since∣rity
 shining in them; whatever things were 
honest, just, pure,
 and of 
good report;
 whatever virtues, or praise-worthy qualities they observ'd among those, with whom they convers'd: they should seriously think of them, and propose them to themselves, for their imitation.


And lastly, That all those things which he himself had by his Doctrine and Life commended unto them, they should carefully observe and imitate, and so they might expect, that the God of peace would be with them with his gracious bles∣sing. 
From Ver▪ 1, to 10.




12.
 He d
clares, how much he rejoiced, even with a motion of spiritual j
y wrought in him by Christ, that their liberality towards him (which seem'd to have been for some time in the decay) had now reviv'd and flourished again. But he readily excuses their delay herein, which he assures himself proceeded, not from want of love to him, but of an opportunity of sending to him. Yet he would not have them think, that he rejoiced so much in their bounty towards him, because he could not bear want, or a straight condition. For he had learn'd, (being instructed by the Spirit of God), in whatever state he was therewith to be content. He could contentedly bear a l
w condition: Yet the plenty their liberality had furnish'd him with, he could mak
 use of to the glory of God. He could do all those things, which consist in the ex∣ercise of Christian 
moderation
 under a prosperous condition, and of 
patience
 and 
contentation
 under an adverse condition, through Chri
t enabling of him. However they had done well in sending him that supply by 
Epaphroditus,
 when he was in some straits, and thereby testifying by their Christian c
mmiseration, that they shared with him in his afflictions and sufferings for Christ. And he acknowledges, that this was no 
new
 thing in them: For after he had finished his first preaching of the Gospel among them, and was departing out of their Country, they were so mindful of him as to send him contributions; and having received of him 
spiritual things,
 they were willing to communicate to him some of their 
temporals,
 which no other Church but they had th
n done. Nay, when he was at 
Thessalonica,
 and since he came thence, more than once, they made a Collection, and sent it to him Yet he would not have them think, that he thus commended them, because he design'd to draw something more from them, but he desir'd that their 
Faith
 might he still more and more productive of such 
good fruits,
 as liberality was; which God would recompence at the day of judgment, and the benefit whereof would redound to themselves, though not of 
merit,
 yet of 
grace.
 He tells them, that he had received all that they had sent him by 
Epaphroditus,
 and the 
sum
 he acknowledges was large, and made him full and to abound, and hereby they had done an acceptable service to God, and which under the Gospel he accepts, and receiveth in the place both of 
Incense,
 and 
Sacrifice,
 which were offered un∣der the Law. And they will have no reason to repent of this their liberality. For G
d who looks on it as given to him, is able and willing to supply all their wants, and that n
t for any merit of theirs, but out of his own rich and glori∣ous grace, which he dispenses through the merits and intercession of his Son Christ Jesus. Now unto this glorious God, who is the Father of all true Believers in Christ, he desires all honour and glory may be ascribed for ever and ever, Amen. 
From V
r. 10, to 21,


He concludes with Salutations, and particularly sends Salutations to them from the Saints in 
Nero
's house, some of his Servants, and Courtiers (it s
ems) being Converts, and Christians. He shuts up all with his Apostolical Be∣nediction. 
From Ver. 21, to the end.








SECT. IX.


ABout this time, the Apostle, by 
Onesimus
 and 
Tychicus,
 sent also an Epistle to the 
Colossions,
 whom he had never seen, [
Col.
 2.1.], they having been instructed in the Doctrine of Christ by 
Epaphras [Col.
 1.7, 8.], whom they had now sent to visit and comfort 
Paul,
 (as the 
Philippians
 had sent 
Epaphroditus
), who it seems was now become 
Pauls
 fellow-prisoner; 
see Philem. v.
 23. The Apostle understanding by 
Epaphras,
 how things went with them, and what was the present state and condition of their Church, and how they were infested with 
false Teachers
 of two sorts, 
viz.
 with some, who being converted out of 
Judaism
 to em∣brace the Faith of Christ, sought to impose upon them Circum∣cision, and certain Rites of the Ceremonial Law, abolished by Christ. And, 2ly, with others, who being converted from 
Gen∣tilism,
 yet obtruded upon them their Philosophical Speculati∣ons with some of their Heathenish Practises, as 
worshipping An∣gels,
 and other superstitious Observances, grounded only upon humane Authority and Tradition: The Apostle therefore be∣ing desirous to establish them in the true Doctrine of the Gos∣pel, taught them by 
Epaphras,
 against all impostures of 
false Teachers
 whatsoever, and to incite them to the study and pra∣ctise of Holiness, both in the general, and in the special duties that concern the particular conditions of men, he writes this Epistle to them.


In the Epistle there are these three parts,




1. The 
Preface.


2. The 
Body
 of the Epistle.


3. The 
Conclusion.




1.
 THE 
Preface
 in which joining 
Timothy
 with him, (whom he calls his Brother in the ministry of Christ), he directs this Epistle to the Saints and faithful, who being implanted into Christ by Fiath), composed the Church at 
Colosse:
 wishing them abundance of grace and peace from God the Father, the Fountain of all blessings; and from Jesus Christ the Conduit-pipe, through whom they are conveyed. And in the first place, he tells them, that himself and 
Timothy,
 since th
y heard of th
ir conversion, did give solemn thanks to God for it, and for their Faith in Christ, and sincere love to all the Saints, and did remember them continually in their prayers. And they rejoic
d that they persever'd in that course, being thereunto moved by the h
ped-for reward
 of glory preserved for them in heaven, which was first made known unto them, and the hope thereof wrought in them by the word of

 truth, that is, the Gospel. Which Gospel was come unto them, (being preached to them by 
Epaphr
s
), as the same was preached by the Apostles in the most eminent plac
s of the World
, 
[see Rom. 1.8 Mat. 24.14.],
 and it brought forth the good fruits of a holy life among others, as it had done among them, ever since they came to have a true and effectual sense and knowledg of the good will and grace of God, which he hath manifested and revealed there∣in And they ought to remember, that they were brought to the knowledg of this G spel by 
Epaphras,
 who had faithfully discharged his duty towards them, and also had given h
m an account of their truly spiritual
, and Christian love, and affection unto h
mself. Having thus shewed, how he praised God for them, he mentions now how he prayed for them, 
viz
 that th
y might be fil∣led with the knowledg of Gods will, and furnished with all wisdom requisite for a clear discerning, and knowledg of all the mysteri
s of Chri∣stianity, and 
with spiritual und
rst
nding
 or prudence, wrought in them by the Spirit of G d, to order, and regulate their lives according to the rules of it, 
Phil. 1.9.
 That their conversation might be such as is worthy of the Lord, aiming in all things to please him
, being fruitful in good works, and growing more and more in the saving knowl
dg of God. Lastly, he prays, that such a measure of heavenly strength may be vouchsafed to them, out of the rich treasury of Gods glorious power, that they may be able to bear any affli∣ctions, or persecutions they shall meet with in their Christian course, and that not only 
patiently,
 but 
cheerfully. From Ver. 1, to 12.


2.
 He comes now to the Body of the Epistle, and b i
g to enter upon a sum∣mary declaration of the D ctrine of Salvation, he b gins with a solemn thanks∣giving to God the Father, who by 
regeneration,
 and savi g conversion, doth make all true Believers 
meet
 and 
fit
 to partake of Heaven, the bright, and glorious, and joyful inheritance of the Saints. He fu
ther explains, How God doth this, namely, by drawing them (by effectual vocati
n) out of the corrupt state of nature, and fr m under the rule of Satan the Prince of d
kness (who ruleth by sin in the Children of disobedience), and transl
ting them into a state of grace, under the government of Christ. In whom they have redemption from sin, Satan, and wrath, by vertue of a price paid by him to the Fathers justice, when he suffer∣ed on the Cross; one principal part of which redemption, is the remission of all their sins. And intending more fully to describe 
Christ,
 and to shew, That he is 
true God,
 and so a m
t 
perfect,
 and an 
all-sufficient Redeemer.
 He first, speaks of the 
dignity of his person,
 declaring, that he is 
the Image of the invisible God,
 b
th as he is his 
eternal Son,
 of the same Essence with the Fa∣ther 
[Heb. 1.3.],
 and also is he is 
God mani ested in the fl sh [1 Tim. 3.16.],
 by whom the invisible God doth manifest his glorious wisdom, power, and mercy. In the next place, he shews, that he is the 
first born
 
of every Creature,
 as being from all eter∣nity begotten of the Father, before any Creature was made or created, and s
 
Lord
 and 
Heir
 of all the Creatures, as the 
first b
rn
 was among his Brethren, 
Gen. 49.3. 2.
 He sh
ws, that he is the 
Creator
 of all things, as co-working with the Father, and that whether they be 
v
sib
e
 or 
invisible;
 particularly, whether they be 
Thrones▪
 or 
Dominions,
 or 
Princip
lities,
 or 
Powers,
 whereby pr
bably are meant several 
degrees
 and 
digni∣ties
 of Ang
ls, th
u
h what those are, is not revealed to us. And h
 further sh
ws that not only all Creatures were made
 
by him,
 but 
for him. viz.
 for his service, and the manifestation of his divine power and glory. And he is not only 
b
fore


 all Creatures, and 
their Creator,
 but also (together with the Father and the Holy Ghost) their 
Upholder,
 and powerful Preserver. 
3.
 He comes n w to describe Christ in relation to his 
Church,
 declaring that he is the 
H ad
 of that spiritual Body, and by him the Church being called, it hath its beginning and ori∣ginal from him. And further, to set out the dignity of his person, he declares, that he is the 
first-born
 
of the dead,
 that is, the most excellent person that ever rose from the dead, and the 
first
 and 
only one
 who rose 
by his 
wn power,
 and the 
first
 who rose from death to immortal life, and who by vertue of his 
resurrection,
 will raise again to life all his members. So that justly he hath the preheminence above all, and (by all Titles) the right of Dominion and Rule over all, 
[see Rom. 14.9.].
 And further, that he may prove that Christ is an 
all suffi i∣ent Saviour,
 he shews, that it was the Fathers will, that this our Redeemer should be a person filled with 
all 
u ness,
 both of the 
Godhead
 dw
lling in him 
(see ch. 2.9.),
 and of 
grace
 and 
merit [Joh. 1.14 16. Joh. 3.34],
 that he might be perfectly furnished to perform that great work of 
mediation,
 and to reconcile all things both in 
Heaven
 and 
Earth
 unto a provoked G
d, (which he hath app
inted to be reconcil'd), by the merit of his death and passion, wh
∣ther they be blessed mens Spirits already gathered into heavenly glory, or belie∣vers here yet living upon the Earth. Yea▪ seeing by sin, 
Heaven
 and 
E
rth
 were set at variance, it was the Fathers will, 
by him,
 to make peace, not on∣ly betw en G
d and man, but also betwixt the Angels
 in Heaven, a
 Be∣lievers on Earth. And what he had sp
k n in the general, concerning Christs work of reconciliation; he now applies particularly to the believing 
C
l
ssi
ns,
 telling them, that though before their conversion they were a
 Strangers unto God, yea as Enemies, such as did hate God, and were hated of him (
 
e
son their minds were set on evil works), yet now Chri
t had rec nc
led them unto God, by taking on him a true humane Body of Flesh and Blood, like unto ours in all things, sin only excepted and by suffering d
ath in it; and all this that they might be presented pure and holy
 b
f
re God, and free from all guilt and sin, at the last day. 
From Ver. 12, to 23.


3.
 He tells them, if they expected to be thus presented holy and unblameable before God at the last day, they must constantly and st dfa tly adhere to the Do∣ctrine of the Gospel, not quitting their hope of eternal life and glory, which was begotten in them by it; which Gospel they had he
rd preached unto them by 
Epa∣phras,
 and was no other than 
that
 which at Chri
ts command was taught through the World
 by the Apostles, and which he himself was called by God to preach am ng the 
Gentiles.
 And as 
for his sufferings,
 he sheweth, they had no reason to be scan∣daliz'd at them, for he himself underwent them joyful
y, considering that they tended t
 the good and benefit of the 
Colossi
s,
 namely, to confirm them in the D
ctrine of the G
spel, and to encourage them to suffer for it, if cal∣led to it, and also because thereby he filled up the measure and share of those sufferings allotted to be suffered by him in his Body, (as a member of Christ and in conformity to him), which are appointed by the dispensation of God, and re∣main to b
 suffered and undergone by 
Christ mystical,
 namely, the Church; which sufferings and afflictions of particular members redound to the great bene∣fit of the whole Church, and tend to edifie them in patience, and to confirm them in the truth; of which Church, he tells them, he was called to be a Minister by the appointment of God, and chiefly among the 
Gentiles,
 (of wh m th
se 
Col ssi∣ans
 were a part and so his commission to extended them), that God by his mini
try might fullfill his word of prophesie, and promise of calling the 
Ge
ti 
s
 in the days of the Gospel, 
[see Isa. 65.1. Zach. 2.11.].
 N
w the subject matter of this Gospel, (whereof he was appointed a Minister), he shews, was in tim
s

 past a 
mystery,
 and in all former ages and generations hid, (from the 
Gentiles simply,
 from the 
Jews comparatively
), being k
pt under dark shadows, and mystical representations 
[Rom. 16.26.],
 but now was clearly manifested and revealed to the holy Apostles, and by them to the faithful. And to them God is pleas'd to manifest the exceeding great and glorious excellency of this mystery, which is, 
Christ preached among
 
the Gentiles, in
 and 
through whom,
 hope of pardon and bliss is vouch∣safed to them. And 
this Christ,
 says he, we preach; exhorting and teaching every man that will hear, whether he be 
Jew
 or 
Gentile,
 (with all the spiritual wisdom afforded to us) to believe in 
Him,
 that being pardoned through his merits, and renewed by his Spirit, we may present them before the Judgment Seat of God perfectly righteous in him. And in this work, he tells them, he faithfully labour'd and travell'd, having found great and corroborating strength from God, carrying him on in it. 
From Ver. 23, to the end.


 
4.
 Having thus declared the Doctrine delivered to them to be true, and per∣swaded them to continue stedfast in it; he now comes to shew them, that they ought to avoid all corrupt Doctrines contrary thereunto, which false Teachers w
uld obtrude upon them. And in the first place, he desires they should know what great care and sollicitude he had for them in his mind, and how he strove in his prayers with God, not only for those Churches which he himself had plant∣ed, and among whom he had familiarly conversed, but for them also, though not converted by him, and their neighbour Church of 
Laodicea,
 (to whom he wil∣leth this Epistle should he read, 
ch. 4 16.
), and for all other Churches who had never seen his face. And his great desire and endeavour was, that their hearts might be comforted, and encouraged against all the troubles they met with, and that they might be knit together by the bond of love, as the members of the natu∣ral body are by the nerves and sinews, that so instructing and edifying one ano∣ther, they might attain to a large measure of certain and assur'd knowledg and understanding, in the mystery of the Gospel, which may justly be call'd 
the my∣stery of God,
 being hid from the eye of natural reason, and made known only 
by him,
 and in which God is reveal'd and manifested to be the 
Father
 of Christ, and Christ to be the 
eternal Son of God.
 In which mystery
, or divine revelation concerning God the 
Father and Christ,
 all the treasures of wisdom, and knowledg (to wit, that are necessary to salvation) are hidden and wrapt up. And this he testified unto them, to prevent their seducement by false 
Teachers,
 who by false arguments, and ensnaring perswasions sought to beguile them. And he was the more sollicitous concerning them, because though he was absent from them in the body, yet he was present with them 
in Spirit,
 that is, not in bare con∣ceit or phantasie or affection only, but 
so
 as he was well acquainted with their state, and had knowledg of their affairs (either through the information of 
Epa∣phras,
 or through extraordinary revelation, 
see 2 King. 5.26.
), and rejoiced exceedingly to see and behold, in the apprehension and vision of his mind, the good order and government of their Church, and the stedfastness of their Faith in Christ, which he would gladly have them continue in. He exhorts them, therefore, that as they had received the true Doctrine of Christ Jesus our Lord and Savi∣our, taught them by 
Epaphras,
 and had embraced him by Faith, so they would constantly adhere to that Doctrine
, conforming their lives thereunto, and endeavouring to walk worthy of Christ, being like trees well and deeply rooted in 
him,
 or like a house firmly built on 
him,
 as the only sure foundation, that being established and setled in the Faith, (as they had been taught), they might grow in that grace with thanksgiving to God for so great and wonderful mercy of revealing his Son to them. 
From Ver. 1, to 8.




5.
 He comes now to caution them against those things whereby 
seducers
 sought to draw them away from Christ: and those he reduces to 
three heads. 1. The Speculations of the Gentilish Philosophy. 2. The Traditions of Men. 3. The Rudiments of the World. 1.
 He cautions them, to take heed lest any make a prey of them, and seduce them from the sound Doctrine of Christ, by amuzing them with the sublime speculations of their mysterious Philosophy, which flies as high as 
Angels
 and 
Intelligences;
 and teaches (though very fallaciously) that they are Mediators between God and man
, and so ought to be the objects of 
humane adoration, see v. 18. 2ly,
 He cautions them against walking after the 
Traditions of Men,
 that is, the superstitious Rites invented by men, and obtruded as parts of Divine Worship, having no authority from the Word of God, nor other warrant than 
Antiquity, Custom,
 or 
Hu∣mane Institution. 3.
 He warns them, to take heed of them, who would per∣swade them, to observe 
Circumcision,
 and the Levitical Rites, which were 
Ru∣diments,
 or 
Elements
 fitted for the infancy of the Church, and by which God thought fit to instruct the former Ages of the World 
[Gal. 4 3.],
 and his people under the Old Testament; the following of which things, he tells them, was not according to the Institution or Injunction of Christ, but did draw away the heart from him. He shews them, that Christ alone 
is a most perfect Sa∣viour;
 for in his person the 
fulness of the Godhead dwelleth bodily,
 that is, 
personally,
 and 
subtantially,
 in opposition to the 
Shaddows
 and 
Types
 of the Old Testament. For God is said, in the Old Testament, to dwell in the 
Tabernacle, Ark of the Covenant,
 and 
Temple,
 as in the Shaddows and Figures of Christs 
humane Nature,
 which he was to take on him, in the ful∣ness of time; which he having now taken on him, God now dwells in the same, 
really, personally,
 and 
substantially,
 with all his fulness; so that 'tis folly to seek salvation any where else but in him alone. 
2.
 He acquaints them, that all that are united to him by Faith, are 
compleat in him,
 as having from him all things necessary to Salvation. 
3.
 He declares, that He is above all Princi∣palities and Powers, that is, all the holy Angels, (by whom God doth execute many great and mighty works, as it were, by Princes and Potentates), as be∣ing their 
Head
 and 
Lord,
 and upholding and ruling them as his Creatures. And they being his Servants, and so our fellow-servants, ought not to be worshipped by us, 
[see Rev. 22.8, 9.],
 nor are they Mediators between God and us; that being an honour due to him only who is their Head, 
[1 Tim. 2.5.]. From Ver. 8, to 11.


6.
 He begins here by a Figure call'd 
Hysterosis,
 to oppose himself against the third sort of errors, which he had caution'd them against, 
v. 8.
 namely, urging the 
Mosaical Rites,
 and Elements of the former Ages of the World, as necessary to salvation.


And first, He answers an Objection which he foresaw the 
Colossians
 might make against what he had before said. He had said, 
v. 10. Believers were com∣pleat in Christ.
 But possibly they might say, That some 
Teachers
 among them taught them, That they, being 
Gentiles,
 and wanting 
Circumcision,
 were un∣clean, and so not perfect in Christ.


The Apostle answers, that they, being 
Believers,
 and united to Christ, need not be 
outwardly Circumcised;
 for they had 
by him,
 the thing signified by Circumcision, namely, the 
spiritual Circumcision of the heart,
 which consists in cutting off, and putting away the body of manifold sins, form'd, and compacted of our innate corruption, whereof particular sins are the members. And the means of this their renovation is 
Baptism,
 (which succeeds in the place of Circumci∣sion), and which (as it was anciently administred to adult and grown persons) was a clear representation of the 
death, burial,
 and 
resurrection
 of Christ, and by proportion represented also how Christians ought to dye unto sin, and rise unto newness of life. Which 
new life
 they live by 
Faith in Christ,
 and 
that Faith,
 God who raised Jesus Christ from the dead, works in them by his own

 Spirit. He uses also another Argument against the necessity of Circumcision, namely, that when they, in the time of their natural state and condition, were dead in sins, and without Circumcision in their Flesh, (as being 
Gentiles, Eph. 2.11.
), God had quickned them, as he did Christ, infusing into them the new life of grace, and giving them a right to the life of Glory, having pardoned all their sins, both 
original
 and 
actual,
 freely for his sake, upon their belie∣ving in him. Yea Christ hath by his death, blotted out, and abolished the 
hand∣writing of the Ordinances,
 and those Legal Ceremonial Injunctions, touching Circumcision, and the observation of 
Days,
 and several 
Washings,
 and 
Sacri∣fices, Eph. 2.15.
 in the observance of which, the 
Jews
 testified against them∣selves, their own guiltiness and liableness to punishment. For, by killing a Beast they testified they deserved to dye themselves. But now Christ, having by his death satisfied the Justice of God for our sins, hath thereby can∣cell'd those Ordinances
 which testified our guiltiness, and bound us over, and declar'd us liable to wrath and vengeance. Now seeing the debt is paid, and the obliga∣tion to wrath which we were under, (by reason of our sins), cancell'd, to revoke this hand-writing of ordinances, (which testified so much against us), and to seek to bring it in force again, as 
false Teachers
 labour'd to do, (by urging Circumcision, and the Legal Observances), must needs be, not only a great folly, but very pernicious. Nay further, Christ by his death hath not only cancell'd this hand-writing that was against us, and taken it out of the way, and nailed to his Cross, but thereby also hath vanquisht, and disarm'd 
his
 and 
our enemies,
 the Devil, and all the powers of Hell, and hath carried them, as it were, in triumph, and made a shew of them openly, making them a spectacle of shame and scorn in the eyes of God and good Angels, as the 
Roman
 Generals us'd in their Triumphs to have their Captives carried disarm'd, and bound, after their Triumphal Charriots. 
From Ver. 8, to 16.


He draws now a Conclusion from the former Argument, namely, That seeing the 
Ceremonial Law
 was abolished, therefore none should presume to condemn them, or lay sin to their charge, for using any of the 
Meats
 or 
Drinks
 prohibited by 
that Law,
 or for not observing the 
Jewish Festivals,
 wh
ther 
anniversary,
 or 
monthly,
 or 
weekly,
 to wit, the 
Seventh-day-Sabbath.
 If any did so, they should not regard their censures. For these things were but shaddows
 of good things to come, and were to remain only untill the coming of Christ, who is the 
truth, body,
 and 
substance
 of them. Some of them pointed at 
Mo∣ral
 Sanctity, this Christ in his own person clearly taught and perfectly fulfill'd; some pointed at the expiation of sin, and this Christ truly wrought by his 
active
 and 
passive
 obedience; some presignified that eternal Rest which true Believers shall partake of hereafter. 'Tis not imaginable, that those 
Seducers,
 the Apostle here bends himself against, ever pleaded for or strove to maintain the Christian-Sabbath, the first day of the week. Therefore 'tis not probable, that in opposing them, he should implead that day. Besides, the 
Sab∣baths,
 here mentioned, were a shadow of things to come, whereas the 
Lords day
 is a memorial of some thing past, namely, the glorious Resurrection of Christ. The old 
Seventh day Sabbath
 might shaddow out something of Christ; and the 
Ancients
 generally understood it, to shaddow out his Rest 
that day
 in the grave
. So that the Apostles Argument runs thus, Seeing the Ceremonial Ordinances were but shaddows and representations of good things to come, and to last only till Christ came; to observe them now under the Gospel, is in effect to say, That Christ the 
body,
 or 
substance
 is not yet come. 
Ver. 16, 16.




7.
 He comes now to argue against the first sort of those errors he mentioned, 
v. 8.
 namely, 
worshipping of Angels,
 which tended to make Christians lose the reward
 provided for them in Heaven, by de∣parting out of the way leading thither, though they that perswaded them unto it, cover'd their error with a plausible shew of humility, pretending, it was presumption to go to God without the mediation of those excellent Creatures. But thereby they boldly intruded
 into things they knew nothing of, being vainly puft up with a conceit of their own corrupt minds. He shews, that these 
Angel-wor∣shippers
 do not acknowledg Christ for the 
Head
 of the Church while they apply themselves to Angels to be their Mediators to God; whereas 
He
 alone doth discharge the office of the 
Head,
 compleatly giving life, and growth to his whole Church, and to every member thereof. Which members being furnished with spiritual life from him, and knit to him, and to one another by the 
nerves
 and 
sinews
 of one common Spirit, they grow and encrease with such an encrease of grace, and holiness, as is from God and tends to his glory. 
From Ver. 18, to 20.


8.
 He argues now against the second sort of errors which he mention'd, 
v. 8.
 namely, 
superstitious Rites, humane Traditions,
 and 
Doctrines of men.
 His Argument against them is to this purpose, that seeing they professed in their Bap∣tism to be spiritually dead with Christ, and to be freed by his death from the Levitical O
dinances, [those Rudiments or Elements appointed by God to instruct the former World], why should they submit to superstitious Rites and Ordinances (of the like kind) invented by men? Could they think, that God would ab∣rogate the Ceremonies of his own Institution, that men might appoint theirs? Why as if they lived in the Old World, should they be under the Decrees and Traditions of men, which draw them to the Observation of things of the like nature? And he particularly instances, in one of those 
Traditions,
 or 
injuncti∣ons,
 namely, concerning 
abstinence from meats. Touch not, taste not, han∣dle not,
 that is, such or such meats; whereas all kind of meats are appointed by God for the use of men, and are to perish in the using. These observances, he acknowledges, were set off with a specious shew of 
wisdom,
 as if they were 
voluntary services,
 and free will offerings to God, giving him more than he re∣quired. They had also a shew of 
Humility,
 and submissive obedience to the In∣junctions of Superiors. Lastly, they had a shew of 
Mortification,
 and 
Auste∣rity
 to the body; they that practis'd them, not seeming to have 
those things
 in any esteem, which God hath made for the necessary satisfying of nature,
 but rather despising them. 
From Ver. 20, to the end.


9.
 Having thus dispatched the 
Doctrinal
 part of his Epistle, he comes now 
 to the 
Practical.
 And in the first place, he gives some 
general
 exhortations, such as concern all Believers, and then some 
special,
 which belong to certain and particular conditions of men.


And first, Seeing they were risen with Christ, as he had intimated, 
v. 12, 13.
 of 
ch. 2.
 he exhorts them, that they should 
set their affections on things a∣bove,
 and that, because Christ their 
Head
 was above. And further, they had in their 
Baptism
 professed themselves dead to Sin and the World, and therefore ought really so to be, and to have their thoughts often upon their eternal life and bliss, which though it was hid from the eyes of the World, yet it was reserved for them in Heaven, (where Christ was), in the safe keeping of God, 
[see

 1 Pet. 1.4, 5.].
 And when Christ, who is the Author and Procurer of this blissful and eternal life for them, shall appear to judg the World, then they shall appear also with him in glory. Next, he presseth them, particularly, To morti∣fie their corrupt lusts, such as 
Uncleanness, inordinate Affection, evil Con∣cupiscence,
 and 
Covetousness,
 which he calls 
Idolatry,
 because it draweth a∣way our 
Love, Trust,
 and 
Joy
 from God, and placeth them upon Wealth and Riches. These Lusts, he shews, are the several Members
 of the 
Body of Sin;
 and are said to be 
upon the earth,
 because they draw the Soul down towards the earth, and are exercised upon earthly things as their proper Objects. Now that he might further pr
ss them to a serious endea∣vour to mortifie these Lusts, he tells them, that the wrath of God, with its dreadful effects, cometh upon those who go on contumaciously and im∣penitently in such ways. And they should remember how they themselves formerly liv'd in those sinful courses when they were moved and acted by such vile affections, and therefore now they ought more careful
y to mortifie them. 
2.
 He exhorts them, to 
put away
 from them, that is, to 
mortifie
 their more 
spiritual Corruptions,
 instancing in anger, wrath, malice, (sins of the heart), and 
disgraceful con∣tumelious speaking
 against their Neighbours, as also all 
filthy communica∣tion,
 and 
lying,
 or saying, or suggesting any false thing, to the injury of others, which are sins of the Tongue. This he urges from the present spiritual estate of all true Believers among them, who had (as they profess'd in their Baptism) begun to 
put off
 
the old man,
 that is, 
the corruption of Nature,
 with manifold actual trans∣gressions proceeding there-from; and 
put on the new m
,
 that is, 
new
 and 
spiritual qualities,
 whereby their cor∣rupt Nature is renewed, being illuminated with a saving and tranforming knowledg, and so conform'd to the Image of God, in such a manner, that in this 
new man,
 as in a Glass, Gods Wisdom, Righteousness, and Holiness may be clearly seen and discovered. And lest any should think that God regards not this inward spiritual renovation, but accepts men according to their external priviledges and conditions, he tells them, that now under the Gospel, neither the having of those things helps, nor does the want of them hinder any man, but whosoever believes in Christ, and is renewed by his Spirit, is ac∣cepted of God; He being an All sufficient Saviour to 
all such,
 and that in 
all respects
 whatsoever. 
From Ver. 1, to 12.


10.
 Having ended his exhortation to mortification, and putting off the 
old man,
 he comes now to exhort them. That as they had begin to put on the 
new,
 so they would put on all the parts and particular virtues belonging thereunto, as became such as were selected from the World, and effectually called to the know∣ledg of Christ, and to believe in him. And the excellent virtues, he exhorts them to put on, are these, namely, 
bowels of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering, forbearing,
 and 
freely forgiving one ano∣ther,
 (if any of them have just cause of complaint against another), even as Christ hath freely forgiven them. And above all those graces before-mention'd, he ex∣horts them, especially to put on 
Charity,
 which is the 
most perfect bond
, binding, and knitting all the 
faithful,
 and members of the Church together. And that the love
 of peace, (which God so effectually recommends to his Chil∣dren), should rule in their hearts, and bear sway in them, against all contrary motions; unto the entertaining of which they were called, and strongly obliged, being all members of one body, under one head, Christ Jesus. And that they may the better entertain and continue this peace among themselves, he exhorts them, to be thankful one to another for the benefits they receiv'd one from ano∣ther; and to cherish inclinations in themselves, not only of requiting, but of conferring benefits. And seeing 'tis the 
word of Christ,
 or the Doctrine of

 the Scriptures, that teaches them all these divine L
ssons; he advises them to read it diligently, and frequently to meditate on it, that it may dwell in them 
richly
 and 
copiously,
 and that they may be furnished thereby with all true and sound wisdom; so that their minds and hearts being filled with those di∣vine documents, they may be able to instruct and admonish one another, and stir up one anothers affections, by singing of these holy 
Psalms, Hymns,
 and 
Spiritual Songs,
 ther
in contained; or compos'd 
agreeably
 thereunto, by the direction of the Spirit of God. Yet they must be careful they sing with affections rightly com∣pos'd (according to the measure of grace given them) that they may praise and glorifie God, not with their mouths only, but with their hearts. Lastly, He shuts up this Discourse with giving them 
one general Rule,
 viz. That what∣ever busin
ss they enterprize or enter upon, whether it be by way of 
speech,
 or 
action,
 they should do it with invocation and calling upon God in the Name of Christ; through whose mediation also they should render praises to God (our gra∣cious Father in Christ) for any success afforded to them in any of their businesses, and for all his other mercies also. 
From Ver. 12, to 18.


10.
 He comes now to exhort them to the duties that concern particular Relations: 
1.
 He exhorts 
Wives
 willingly to submit themselves to their own Husbands (as is comely and decent) in all things lawful and agreeable to the will of the Lord. 
2.
 He enjoins 
Husbands
 to love their Wives, and not to be harsh and rigorous towards them in word or deed. 
3.
 He exhorts 
Childr
 to obey their Parents in all honest and lawful things, agreeable to the word of God (see 
Eph. 6.1.
); for such obedience is highly pleasing to the Lord. 
4.
 He enjoins Parents to use their authority moderately over their Children, not irri∣tating or exasperating them by too much severity and rigorous dealing. 
5.
 That 
Servants
 be obedient in all lawful things to their own Masters (who according to the Laws of men, and in things temporal, belonging to the flesh, or body, have the rule over them, though not over their Consciences); and that they should not do their duties only when their Masters are present (as if they only took care to please them, and look'd no further); but with singleness of heart should shew all fidelity and diligence in their absence also, as those that fear the all-seeing eye of God. And whatever service they do for their Masters, they should do it 
heartily,
 and with 
good will
 (Eph. 
6.7.
), as aiming to please God, and serve him therein, and not only and meerly to please and serve their Ma∣sters. And if they do so, they may assure themselves, that this their fidelity (being in conjunction with other graces) shall be rewarded with the inheritance of eternal life; because in 
thus
 serving their Masters, they serve their Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; and he takes their service as done to him, and accordingly will give them the reward which he hath promised to all his faithful servants. And if any of them do meet with wrongs, and injuries, and hard usage from their Masters, he tells them (for their comfort) that there is a day coming when their wrongs shall be considered, and they righted; and the Lord will punish the 
wrong doer,
 and give him his just desert. For God is a righteous Judg, and there is no respect of persons with him. 
From Ver. 18, to the end.


Lastly, He exhorts 
Masters
 to give to their Servants that which is 
just
 and 
 
equal,
 either by strict Law or Contract, or by the Law of Charity; remem∣bring that they have a 
Master
 above them in Heaven, to whom they must give an account of their dealings with their Servants. 
Ver. 1.


11.
 Having thus finished his Precepts concerning 
particular Duties,
 in the close of his Epistle he judg'd it meet to add a few more 
general Directions
 that concern all Christians. And, 
1.
 He exhorts them to 
perseverance,
 and 
holding on to prayer,
 and to 
watchfulness
 and 
fervency
 therein, and to join 
thanks∣giving
 thereunto. And in particular, he desires them to pray for 
him,
 and 
Timothy,
 That God would afford them opportunities, and endue them with a

 spirit of holy boldness and freedom in preaching the mystery of the Gospel, whereof 
Christ
 is the subject-matter, and the substance; for the publishing of which, he now suffered imprisonment. And more especially he desires them to pray for himself, that whilst he suffered for the Gospel, he might be enabled to make manifest and discover the deep and mysterious doctrine thereof, 
in such a manner,
 as was meet and fit, both in respect of the excellency of the Gospel it self; as also in respect of that great trust of the Apostleship committed unto him. 
2.
 He ex∣horts them to carry themselves 
wisely
 towards the 
Heathen
 and 
Infidels,
 among whom they lived (who were without the visible Church), and to im∣prove every opportunity of doing them good, and of gaining them to embrace the faith. And particularly, that they labour to order their 
speech
 and 
ordi∣nary conference
 so, as it may be always 
gracious,
 that is, may express 
some grace
 that is in the heart of the 
speaker,
 and may be apt to work some grace in the hearts of the 
hearers,
 Eph. 
4.29,
 and that it be seasoned with the salt of holy and divine 
wisdom,
 that they may speak fitly
 and to good purpose upon every oc∣casion, and especially when they shall be questioned concerning the grounds of Christianity. 
From Ver. 1, to 7.


Beginning now to conclude his Epistle, he tells them, that he had sent 
Ty∣chicus,
 his fellow-servant in the Lords work; and 
Onesimus
 (one of their own Countrey or City) to acquaint them with his present condition, and with the state of things in the place where he was, and to inform him of theirs, and to strengthen and comfort them under all their trials. He sends them salutations from 
Aristarchus
 a 
Mace∣donian,
 and 
John Mark,
 Nephew to 
Barnabas,
 touch∣ing whom they had received 
commandments
 (that is, had been written to), that if he came unto them, they should receive him, and entertain him kindly and respect∣fully, as a true and faithful servant of Christ. He sends them also salutations from another eminent person with him, namely, 
Jesus
 sirnamed 
Justus: These three
 being descended of Jewish Parents, had been converted to the faith; and being now believing-Christians, and compani∣ons of the Apostle in his afflictions, were the only persons of the Jews who assisted him there at 
Rome
 in preaching the Gospel (whereby the Kingdom of Christ is set up in the hearts of men), and thereby they did much comfort him. He sends them also salutations from 
Epaphras,
 one of their City and Church, who in his prayers did always strive
 earnestly and fervently for them, that being fully and perfectly instructed in the knowledg of the will of God, they might continue firm in their obedience thereunto. For he could not but bear him this testimony, That he had a very great zeal for them, and for their neighbour-Churches of 
Laodicea
 and 
Hierapolis.
 He salutes them also from 
Luke
 and 
Demas.
 He desires these 
Colossians
 to sa∣lute from him their 
neighbours of Laodicea,
 and particularly one 
Nymphas,
 an eminent person for piety among them, and his Christian Family, who were so piously instructly, and so orderly governed, that they deserved the name of a little 
Church.
 He gives order, That after they have read this Epistle them∣selves, they should cause it to be sent and read in the Church of the 
Laodice∣ans;
 and that 
another Epistle
 written from 
Laodicea
 (either from the whole Church, or from their Ministers) unto him, informing him of their case (of which he sent them a Copy) should be read by these Colossians, for the better clearing of some passages in this his Epistle to them; and that they might the better understand upon what occasion he had written some things con∣tained therein. He directs them to admonish their Minister 
Archippus
 (who in the absence of his Collegue 
Epaphras,
 had, as it seems, been somewhat slack),

 to consider the nature and weight of the Ministerial charge with which he was intrusted by Christ
, and that he would labour faithfully to discharge all the parts of it. He shuts up this Epistle, telling them, That he sends his salutation to them written with his own hand, that they may be assured that the rest of the Epistle was dictated by himself, though written by his Scribe. He desires them to remember his bonds and imprisonment for the Gospel of Christ; and to encourage themselves to bear the like troubles, for the same cause, if they should be called to it. Lastly, He wishes, the free and undeser∣ved love and favour of God in Christ, with all the fruits and tokens of it, may be their portion. 
Amen. From Ver. 7, to the end.






SECT. X.


BY 
Tychicus
 also, at the same time, as 'tis probable, He sent an Epistle to the 
Ephesians.
 For, having planted a Church at 
Ephesus,
 the chief City of 
Asia
 the less [
Acts
 18.19.], and afterwards for three years together preached and spread a∣broad the Gospel in that City, and thereabouts [
Acts
 19.]; and having in his last journey to 
Jerusalem
 called together the 
Elders
 and 
Teachers
 of that Church, and warned them con∣cerning the arising of 
Seducers
 among them; He thought it needful at this time to write to them, to confirm them in the truth they had receiv'd, and to arm them against such Do∣ctrines as derogated from the Grace of Christ.


In the Epistle there are these three parts,




1. The 
Preface.


2. The 
Body
 of the Epistle.


3. The 
Conclusion.




1.
 IN the 
Preface
 he declares he was an Apostle of Christ; thereunto appointed, not by the will of man, but of God. His Epistle he directs to 
all the faithful
 at 
Ephesus,
 who were effectually call'd to believe in Christ, and sancti∣fied by his Spirit; heartily wishing unto them abundance of Grace and Peace from God the Father (who is the source and fountain of spiritual blessings); and from Jesus Christ, who is the Conduit-pipe by whom they are conveyed, 
Ver. 1.2.


2.
 He comes to the 
Body
 of the Epistle: and his scope being to establish these 
Ephesians
 in the sincere Doctrine of the Gospel already received, and to unfold to them the 
grounds
 and 
causes
 of their salvation, together with the freedom of God's grace in Christ manifested therein; in the first place he falls into a high admiration of the 
free mercy
 of God (who is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ), and solemnly blesses his holy Name for bestowing on 
Be∣lievers
 all sorts of spiritual blessings and graces, which descend from Hea∣ven,



 and which he communicates to them 
in
 and 
through
 his Son. And the 
first
 of these he shews, is this; That he hath in his eternal 
election,
 even before the foundation of the world, separated them from other men, and designed to communicate these blessings to them, 
in
 and 
through
 Christ, to the intent that they should be 
holy
 and 
blameless
 before men, and 
sincere
 as in his sight, living in the exercise of love to God, and one another. Yea, 
in
 and 
through
 Christ, he hath predestinated them to the 
adoption
 of sons, that is, to be his adopted Children, not for any 
foreseen merit,
 or 
prepa∣rations
 of grace in them, but according to his own 
gratuitous mercy,
 and the good pleasure of his own will. And all this to the praise of his glorious grace, which is not only the End of his electing them 
before time,
 but the Cause also that 
in time
 he makes them lovely, and fit to be accepted of himself, 
in
 and 
through
 his beloved Son, in whom they have redemption through his blood shed on the Cross; and the satisfaction he hath made for them to his Father, hath acquired for them the remission of all their sins. And he hath caused the riches of his grace to abound towards them, in not only sending his Son to make atonement for them, but in revealing the Gospel to them, and thereby imparting that true wisdom (the right knowledg of Himself and his Son unto them) and that spiritual prudence which is requi∣site to direct them to order their Christian conversation aright. And he hath made known unto them that great 
mystery
 and 
secret
 of his will (which could not be known, either by Angels or men, before it was revealed) whereby is discovered and manifested what he hath resolved in his eternal Purpose, concerning the way of saving sinners, according to his own good pleasure and free grace. Which 
secret
 was then only clearly to be manifested, when 
that time
 arriv'd, unto which (according to his wise and admirable dispen∣sation) he hath reserved the fulness of his revelations, and the accomplish∣ment of his promises, which he before made. Now one part of this glorious 
mystery,
 is this, That 
sin
 having made a division between the 
glorious An∣gels
 in heaven, and 
corrupted men
 on earth, he hath found out a way to reconcile them by his Son; even as if a 
Prince
 that hath soveraignty over two Kingdoms, between which there is war, because one of them is fallen into rebellion whilst the other continues in their obedience, should by pardon∣ing the one, reconcile them, and compose the difference between them, and so form them into one Empire. And having hitherto spoken of 
Believers
 in ge∣neral, he now comes to make application of this his Doctrine, 
first,
 to the 
Jews,
 and next to the 
Gentiles.
 And first he shews, That the 
Jewish Be∣lievers
 (whereof himself was one) had, 
in
 and 
through
 Christ, and by virtue of his merit and intercession (not for any merit in themselves) ob∣tained a right to a glorious inheritance in Heaven, being predestinated there∣unto according to the gracious purp
se of God, 
who worketh all things ac∣cording to the counsel of his own will,
 that so his glorious Attributes, (
viz.
 His infinite Wisdom, Goodness, and Mercy) manifested in that work, might be acknowledged and highly praised by them to whom the Gospel was first preached 
[Mat. 10.6. Acts 13.46.],
 and who were first called, and were the first who trusted or hoped in Christ for salvation, before there were any considerable number of Converts among the Gentiles. 
2dly,
 He shews, that not only 
believers among the Jews,
 but the believing 
Ephesians
 also, who were 
Gentiles,
 had 
in
 and 
through
 Christ obtained a right to this Heavenly Inheritance, having been brought to believe in Him after the Gospel had been once preached to them. And then they were 
sealed
 for the Children of God, not by such an outward seal as 
Circumcision,
 but by the renewing and sanctifying work of the Spirit (whom God had graciously promised
 to give) wrought in their hearts, whereby he imprinteth his image upon them, which is holiness. And the bestowing this his holy Spirit on them, was an earnest of that heavenly inheritance, the full enjoyment whereof was not to be expected till the last day; at which time, all that

 are the purchas'd
 
possession, acquisition,
 and 
peculiar people of Christ,
 shall obtain compleat redemption, and their bodies shall be raised up, and uni∣ted to their souls, and so both soul and body made for ever happy. And Gods end in all this is (as was before mentioned, 
v. 12.
), the praise of his own free and glorious grace. 
From Ver. 3, to 15.


3.
 He tells them, That having heard so good a report of their 
faith
 in Christ, and love to all the Saints, he could not but give solemn thanks to God on their behalf, and earnestly pray for them; beseeching him who is now known to us by a more glorious title than that of 
The God of Abraham,
 even 
The God of our Lord Jesus Christ
 (as he is Man and Mediator, and sent by him, 
John 20.17.
), and the 
Father of glory;
 that is, who is in his own nature infinitely glorious, and the Author of all the glory communicated to any of the Creatures (and to whom all honour and glory ought to be ascribed), that he would please to impart unto them that Wisdom, and Revelation of divine mysteries (whereof his Spirit is the Author), that they may attain to a more full and exact
 knowledg of Christ, and his benefits; and that he would so illuminate their understandings, that they may be capable clearly to discern and apprehend what he hath call'd them to a participation of, and which is as yet only the object of their hope and expectation, 
viz.
 the 
rich and glori∣rious inheritance,
 which he hath prepared for his Saints
 in Heaven, and which only they shall be possessors of. And further, that they may be sensible of the greatness of God's 
Power,
 which he exerteth 
in
 and 
towards
 believers, in regenerating of them by his Spirit▪ and carrying on a work of grace in them (in despight of men and devils) from one degree to another, till grace be swallow'd up in glory: which 
power,
 he shews, was no other than 
that
 by which he raised Christ from the dead, and set him at his own right hand, in the highest degree of glory next to himself, in heaven, far above all principalities
 and powers, and all things 
excellent,
 and 
famous,
 and 
worthy to be named
 either in this world, or the world to come; the Father having placed all creatures in a state of subjecti∣on unto him, even under his feet, to be disposed of as he seeth fit. And over and above all, he hath given him in a special manner to be 
Head of his Church,
 which is his 
body,
 and his 
fulness
, as he is the mystical Head thereof; see 
1 Cor. 12.12.
 So that he doth not judg himself (in that sense) to be perfected and com∣pleated, till he hath all his members. Lastly, He sheweth, That this Saviour, animating and enlivening all the mem∣bers of his body by his Spirit, perfecteth and compleateth all things in them (gradually) which appertain to their spiritual life, sanctification, and salvation. 
From Ver. 15, to the end.


4.
 The Apostle now intending to set forth unto these 
Ephesians
 the happi∣ness 
 of that condition in which free-grace had placed them; he takes occasion in the first place to shew them the misery of their 
former Heathen-state
 before th
ir conversion, they being then spiritually 
dead in sins and trespasses
 (with∣out any life of grace in them) and walking according to the common course and customs of the 
Nations
 and 
Gentile-world,
 and according to the instiga∣tion of 
Satan,
 who being cast out of the 
higher Heaven
 of glory, wanders about now; and exercises the power which God permits unto him, in the lower regions of the air, and powerfully works in the children of disobedience. And he shews, that the 
Jews
 before their conversion, were equally miserable, having

 their conversation among these children of disobedience, and were no less obsti∣nately rebellious against God, than the disobedient Gentiles; fulfilling those lusts which their sensual appetites and phant'sies were plea∣sed with, and 
were by nature
 
children of wrath,
 even as others; 
that is,
 were born, and liv'd, and con∣tinued in a damning-condition, as other Heathens did. But God, who is infinitely rich in mercy, without any desert in us in invite him to it, when we were 
dead in sins,
 by that power by which he raised Christ from the grave, hath 
quickned
 us, and bestowed a new spiritual life upon us, yea hath 
(in assured hope)
 raised us up from the dead, 
in Christ
 our Head, and hath set us with him in Heaven: For 
He
 sitting there who is our 
Head,
 we are at pres
nt not unfitly said to sit there also, and shall infallibly come thither in due time. And God's 
end
 in thus graciously working upon the 
first converted
 among the 
Jews,
 and those since-converted 
Ephesians;
 he shews, was, that to all succeeding ages he might give an evident proof and example of the exceeding riches of his grace, and that not only for his own glory but for the encouragement of all vile sinners to the end of the world, to seek to him for mer
y 
in
 and 
through
 his Son. He tells these 
Ephesians
 therefore, that they ought to be sensible, that their salvation, from the first step to the last, depends on God's free favour and grace in Christ, and not on any des
rt in themselves. Yet they are so saved by grace, that 
faith
 is not exclu∣ded; this b
ing the hand or instrument whereby we lay hold upon the righte∣ousn
ss and benefits of Christ offered to us in the Gospel. And 
this faith
 is also the gift of God, as 
salvation
 is. 
Works
 therefore have no 
meritorious
 or 
causal
 influence upon our salvation (which all men naturally have a propension to rely upon), but even our 
best works
 are excluded (being 
effects,
 not 
causes
 of that grace by which we are saved), that all ground of 
boasting
 and gloriation may be taken away from men, and all the glory ascrib'd intirely unto God, 
in
 and 
through
 Jesus Christ. Yet lest any should think that the Ap
stle, by extolling 
free-grace,
 and excluding 
works
 from being the cause of our salvation, should seem to 
depreciate
 and vilifie works, and an holy life, as altogether unnecessary; he shews, they are absolutely re∣quired of those that shall be saved; because 
all true Converts,
 whether 
Jews
 or 
Gentiles,
 are God's 
workmanship,
 that is, form'd to a new life, and 
renewed
 through the intervening mediation of Christ, that they may make conscience of bringing forth 
good works,
 to which God hath before prepared them (that they should walk in the practice of them), by giving them his holy Spirit, and thereby disposing and fitting their understandings and wils to produce them, and giving them the 
Rule
 of good works in his word to guide them. So that, though good works be necessary as 
fruits,
 and as the 
end
 of regeneration; though they be 
the way
 which leadeth to Heaven, and are 
evidences
 of our right to salvation; though they are necessary in reference to the 
peace
 of our own consciences, and for the 
edification
 of others, yet they are not meritorious of salvation. 
From Ver. 1, to 11.


5.
 For the further establishment of these 
Ephesians
 in the Doctrine of Free-grace in Christ, he remembers them of their former miserable condition before their conversion, when they were in the 
flesh,
 that is in the corruption of Na∣ture, not having so much as 
Circumcision
 the sign of God's Covenant 
[Gen. 17.11.]
 which the Jews (who were circumcised in their flesh by the hands of men) made use of as a matter of reproach unto them. He remembers them also, That at that time they were so far from having any saving-interest in Christ, that they had not so much as any offer of Christ made to them by the Gospel; 
they were then aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel,
 having no union or communion either with the 
invisible
 Church of true believers, or with the 
visible
 Church of Professors, which was in those times among

 the people of 
Israel,
 Deut. 
32.9.
 They were strangers to the 
Covenants
 of promise, 
that is,
 to God's Covenant and promise of Christ in due time to be exhibited, and of eternal life promised to sinners through faith in him; they were strangers to the 
Covenant of Grace
 made with 
Adam
 after the fall 
[Gen. 3.15.],
 and afterwards frequently renewed with 
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob;
 with 
Israel
 upon 
Mount Sinai,
 and with 
David:
 therefore called 
Covenants
 in the plural number, though it was always 
one
 and the 
same Covenant
 for substance, though it had various discoveries and manifestations, and was various as to circumstance and manner of Administration. He tells them, they were so far from having any actual interest in the saving-blessings which were promised in this Covenant, that they had not this Covenant at all revealed to them, nor any right to the external priviledges of it; yea, further, they were such persons as 
had no hope,
 that is, no true ground to hope for the forgiveness of their sins, or salvation, they being 
without God in the world,
 that is, without any clear knowledg of the true God. But, now, 
they
 who were before 
afar off from Christ,
 his 
Church,
 his 
Covenant,
 any 
saving-hope,
 and 
from a true knowledg of God,
 were now brought 
nigh to God,
 and 
united to his Church,
 through faith in Christ, who by his death and bloody sacrifice had purchased that great blessing for them. For he is the only author and procurer of our peace with God. And whereas be∣fore, 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles
 were so much separated by reason of their Religion and religious rites, he hath now united them into 
one
 and 
the same Church.
 For he hath taken away the 
Ceremonial Law,
 which was the 
middle-wall
 of partition between them, and the occasion of a perpetual standing-strife, while the 
Jews
 reproached the 
Gentiles
 for want of 
Circumcision,
 and the 
Gentiles
 reproached the 
Jews
 for having of it, and for observing other of the 
Mosaical
-rites, which they judged absurd. Now Christ hath abolished 
this enmity
 by his death which he suffer'd in the flesh, and taken away the ground of it, having removed the 
law of commandments,
 consisting in insti∣tutions and ordinations concerning certain ceremonial rites belonging to the ex∣ternal worship of God (which were prescribed as so many types and shadows of Christ to come, 
Heb. 9.10.
), that so he might form all the converted among Jews and Gentiles (who believe in him) into 
one people
 or 
Church
 under himself their Head (called here one 
new man,
 because renewed by the Holy Ghost), and so make peace between them. And, being thus united into one 
Body
 or 
Church,
 he hath reconciled them to God by the sacrifice, of himself on the Cross▪ having removed the enmity which was before between God and them by reason of their sins; and the enmity that was between thems lves, by reas
n of the diversity of their Religions. And he further shews That Christ had published the glad tydings of this peace and reconci∣liation (which was purchased by himself on the Cross) both to the 
Jews
 who were within the visible Church, and to the 
Gentiles
 who were without the bounds of it; though to the later he preached not 
immediately
 in his own person (
Mat. 15.24.
 except to some few, who were the first-fruits of the rest), but 
mediately
 by his Apostles, and their Successors, 
Mat. 28.19.
 And through this Saviour, he tells them, that both believing-Jews and Gentiles have equal liberty of access to God, as to a reconciled Father, by the assistance of that one Spirit, who quickens and actuates the graces of all the people of God. Wherefore, by way of conclusion, he setteth before these 
Ephesians
 the excellency and blessedness of their present state, they being now no more 
stran∣gers
 and forreigners, but 
free-men
 and fellow-citizens with the Saints and Members of the Family of God, the Catholick Church, and added to that spiritual building which is built upon the 
Doctrine
 of the Prophets and Apo∣stles, Christ himself being the 
personal foundation,
 and chief 
corner-stone
 thereof 
[Joh. 28.16. Psal. 118.22.]
 binding the two walls of this building together, viz. 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles.
 And all the parts of this building being firmly joined to him by 
faith,
 and among themselves by 
love,
 the whole Edifice

 daily grows, not only by the addition of new Converts and Members, but every Member thereof in particular grows in grace (through the vertue and power of Christ, they being living stones, 
1 Pet. 2.8.
), and so the whole building groweth
 to be a holy Temple unto God, wherein he manifests his presence, and is constantly served and glo∣rified, as he was in 
Solomon
's Temple. And what he spake of this spiritual building in the general, he now applies to these 
Ephesians
 in particular; shewing, that they were built (together with all other sincere belie∣vers) upon Jesus Christ the foundation, and that for this end, that they might be a fit habitation for God to dwell and manifest his special pre∣sence in, by the saving-operations of his holy Spirit. 
From Ver. 11, to the end.


6.
 Lest the 
Ephesians
 should be offended at the Apostle's present capti∣vity and bonds at 
Rome,
 he sets before them the cause of them, which was his preaching the Gospel to the 
Gentiles
 (of whom these 
Ephesians
 were a part) for which he was accused of the 
Jews,
 and so given over into the hands of Infidels. And they might easily be convinced, that these things happened for their good, if they had heard and understood his
 calling of grace to be an Apostle, with relation chiefly to the 
Gentiles,
 and particularly to them. He shews he was sufficiently furnished by God with knowledg and insight into the Doctrine he was to preach: for he had by extraordinary revelation from God 
[Gal. 1.12.],
 that sacred secret or mystery of the calling of the 
Gentiles,
 made known unto him (as he had briefly written of it before in the two former Chapters); which mystery was not so clearly made known in the former ages
 of the world, as it was now revealed by the Spirit of God unto the holy Apostles
 and Prophets of the New-Testament; namely, That the believing-Gentiles should be 
fellow-heirs
 of the heavenly inheritance with the believing-
Jews,
 and should be incorporated into that 
one mysti∣cal body
 whereof Christ is the 
Head,
 and be copart∣ners and partakers of the promise made by God of the forgiveness of sins, and adoption 
in
 and 
through
 Christ; and they were to be brought to this happy estate by the preaching of the Gospel, and by faith in Christ, with∣out the observation of the Ceremonial Law, or Circum∣cision. And he shews, that God of his free-grace to him, was pleased to call him to the office of the Apostleship, and so employ him in preaching the Go∣spel, furnishing him with gifts 
ordinary
 and 
extraordinary,
 for the discharge of it; and powerfully assisting and blessing his Ministry with admirable success both far and near, 
Rom. 15.19, 20.
 And he could not but look upon him∣self as more unworthy, and less to be esteemed of, than the
 meanest of God's Saints and Children, by reason of his former enmity to Christ and his Church. Yet the 
Apostolical Office
 (called here 
grace,
 because given of God's free-grace and favour) was bestowed on him; and his office was, To preach and set forth unto the 
Gentiles
 the incomparable and incomprehensible riches of the mercy of Christ towards them, in receiving them freely 
into covenant,
 without lay∣ing those impositions of 
Circumcision,
 and 
other Rites,
 upon them, which were required of the 
Jews;
 and to make known unto all men what is the 
communion
 or fellowship of this mystery, 
viz.
 That the 
Gentiles,
 with the 
Jews,
 should have 
one Faith, one Lord, one Hope,
 and 
one common Sal∣vation,


 which thing was hid (as it were) from the ages before, in the counsel of God, being not so fully and clearly revealed till these times. And he intimates, that none had reason to wonder why God should save the 
Gen∣tiles
 as well as the 
Jews
 by Christ, seeing he hath created them 
both
 by 
him
 (not as an instrument) but as one co-working with him, 
Heb. 1.2. Joh. 1.3.
 He shews also another effect of his preaching the Gospel to the 
Gen∣tiles,
 which was, That the glorious Angels
 (who have their ordinary resi∣dence in Heaven, though sometimes they are employed on Earth) may by what is done in the Church (that is, by the gathering of 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles
 into one Church by the Gospel) behold, as in a glass, the manifold wisdom of God, and his divers ways of dispensing grace and salvation in several ages, and that according to his decree long before made, which he purposed to execute 
in
 and 
by
 his Son. Through whose Merits and Mediation 
all that believe in him
 have boldness and liberty given them to approach and make their addresses to God with confidence of acceptance. And therefore seeing he was persecuted for this reason 
especially,
 because he preached the Gospel to the 
Gentiles,
 and asserted their interest in Christ, and 
through him,
 in all the blessings of the Covenant of Grace, he desires they would not be discouraged or disheartned at any thing that shall befall him in this cause, and he tells them it would be their glory if they were not. 
From Ver. 1, to 14.


7.
 That they may not be discouraged, he tells them, He daily bows his knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus (and in him the Father of 
all the regenerate,
 whether triumphant in Heaven, or militant here on Earth; and that whether 
Jews
 or 
Gentiles,
 whom he will have named his Children, counting them for his Family) that he would according to his rich and glo∣rious mercy furnish them by his Spirit with a daily encrease of spiritual strength in their minds and hearts, whereby they may be enabled to resist the Devil, and all the Enemies and Adversaries of their souls, which they shall meet with in their Christian course; that being firmly united to Christ by faith, he may constantly dwell in their hearts by the gracious operations of his holy Spirit, quickning, ruling, and fashioning them daily more and more to his own will. And further, that they may be rooted and firmly setled in an experi∣mental knowledg and sense of the greatness of God's love
 and free-grace in Christ; and may be able, with all true believers, to understand (in some measure) the vast dimensions of the 
love
 of the Father and the Son to lost sinners; which is so large, so free, so wonderful, that 'tis beyond the reach of any created Ʋnderstanding fully to comprehend it. And lastly, that they may 
be fil∣led with all the fulness of God;
 that is, with all the graces of his Spirit, which he usually imparts to his Children in this life; and so made more and more 
partakers of the Divine Nature.
 He concludes his prayer with an heavenly Doxology or Thanksgiving unto God, who hath be∣gun a good work in them, and is able to carry it on, and to bestow more and greater good things upon them, than they can ask or imagine, according to that Almighty Power which he hath hitherto evidenced, in converting and quickning of them to a new life. To this 
All-wise, most Powerful,
 and 
most Gracious God,
 he desires all glory may be ascribed in the true Church, and among the visible Professors and Members thereof, 
in
 and 
through
 the mediation of Christ Jesus; and that in all ages and generations, as long as the world shall stand, and to all Eternity after time shall be ended. 
From Ver. 14, to the end.


Having thus dispatch'd the 
doctrinal
 part of this Epistle,
 he comes now to the 
practical,
 wherein he exhorts the 
Ephesians
 to divers Christian duties, in

 testimony of their gratitude to God for all those benefits before-mentioned. And first, to 
general duties,
 common to all Christians; and then to more 
special
 and 
peculiar,
 to some particular Relations. The more 
general duties
 he ex∣horts to, are these contained in this Chap. and to the 
22
 verse of Chap. 
5.
 And in the first place, as an Apostle that was at that time a prisoner for the Cause of Christ, he exhorts them to walk worthy of their heavenly vocation; expres∣sing the worthiness and answerableness of their walking, in these particulars: 
1.
 In lowliness of mind, and meekness. 
2.
 In long-suffering, and a loving-for∣bearance one of another. 
3.
 That they would endeavour to maintain an union of heart and spirit, of judgment and affection, among the members of the Church; even such an union whereof the Spirit of God is the Author: which union is maintained by a peaceable disposition and deportment, that being the bond
 or ligament that binds Christians together; whereas discord and divi∣sion cuts that bond asunder. And he inforces this exhortation to peace and unity, by an argument taken from those many things wherein the Church and all the true members thereof agree. He instances in seven, which are as so many bonds and engagements to this union. 
1.
 The whole 
invisible Church
 of real Believers, is but 
one mystical body,
 knit by 
faith
 to Christ their Head, and by the bond of 
love
 among themselves; and the 
Catholick Church
 made up of all Christians, and true Churches in the world, is also 
one;
 be∣cause they have the same 
King, Laws, Word, Sacraments
 of admission and nutrition, which they visibly subject themselves unto. 
2.
 There is 
one Spirit,
 who by his gifts and graces animates, moves, and governs this Body or Society of true believers. 
3.
 The 
hope
 following upon their effectual vocation is 
one,
 that is, there is but 
one object
 of their hope, 
viz.
 Heaven and Eternal Glory. There is but one Heaven prepared for all the Saints; and their hoping to meet and live for ever in that one and the same Heaven, should be an argument to them to live in peace and concord here. 
4.
 There is 
one Lord Jesus,
 who by his work of redemption hath obtained a right to rule over his people as Mediator, Lord-Deputy, and Administrator, under his Father, 
Phil. 2.9, 10, 11.
 And Christ being not divided 
[1 Cor. 1.13.],
 there ought not to be any divisions in the Church. 
5.
 There is 
one Faith,
 that is, one true and saving-faith by which both 
Jews
 and 
Gentiles
 are saved, namely, faith in the 
Messiah. 6. One Baptism,
 by which we own Christ, and profess our selves his followers, and take on us 
his Livery.
 There were indeed divers 
washings
 among the 
Jews;
 but now 
one Baptism only
 among Christians. 
7. One God,
 who is the Father of Christ, and 
in him
 of all true believers [see 
Deut. 6.4. 1 Cor. 8.6.],
 who hath a 
soveraignty
 over 
all his creatures,
 whose powerful Providence runneth 
through them all,
 upholding them in their 
being;
 directing, disposing, governing of them 
all,
 and 
all their actions,
 and is 
in all the truly regenerate
 by the gracious operations of his Spirit. 
From Ver. 1, to the 7.


Having press'd them to endeavour after unity, by an argument taken from those many things wherein the Church and all the true members thereof agree; he now answers an objection which he foresaw some would be apt to make against what he had said. They would object, That though there be 
many things
 wherein the Church and all the true members thereof 
agree;
 yet there are 
many things
 also wherein they differ. To this he answers, that the 
di∣versity of gifts and graces,
 and 
their divers measures,
 bestowed by Christ upon the several members of the Church, do all tend to 
unity,
 seeing they all come from 
one
 and the same 
Author,
 and are all given for the promoting 
one
 and 
the same End.
 This he proves out of 
Psal. 62.18.
 where 
David
 by a prophetical spirit speaking of 
things to come
 as already 
past,
 foretels that Christ should in a triumphant manner, ascend up on high, that is, to the highest Heavens, and should lead 
captivity captive;
 that is, as he had upon the 
Cross
 foiled all the spiritual enemies of his Church and people, and

 begun to triumph over them; so in 
his ascension
 he should continue the tri∣umph [see 
Judg. 5.12.
] as Conquerors us'd to do. And as 
they
 us'd to scatter the spoils, and other rich gifts, among the applauding-Citizens and Soldiers, so should Christ 
at his ascension
 pour forth and distribute a large measure of the Gifts and Graces of his Spirit unto his Church, and the seve∣ral members thereof: which 
Prophecy
 the Apostle shews was now fulfilled by Christ. He further declares, That Christ 
ascending
 to Heaven by his own di∣vine power, did presuppose his foregoing humiliation and abasement, in all the degrees of it, even his descending to the 
lower parts of the earth;
 which 
expression
 is to be understood, not by comparing the 
parts
 of the earth among themselves, but by comparing 
Earth
 with 
Heaven,
 the Earth being the lowest part of the World. And particularly, it either pointeth out his 
conception
 in the womb of the Virgin [see 
Psal. 139.15.
], or his 
burial
 [expressed by a like phrase, 
Mat. 12.40.
], with all the other steps of his humiliation inter∣vening. So that the 
Person
 who thus descended to take on him our humane nature, with the sensless infirmities thereof, is the 
same
 also who ascended to the highest Heavens, the seat of Majesty and Glory, far above all the 
vi∣sible Heavens,
 and that for 
this end,
 That he might 
fulfil
 all 
prophecies
 and 
predictions
 concerning himself (whereof this of 
David
 was one), and all those parts of his 
Mediatory Office
 which were yet to be perform'd in Heaven; and particularly, that he might 
fill
 and adorn all the members of his Church with the Gifts and Graces of his Spirit. He further sheweth, This was the end of Christ's appointing those 
extraordinary
 and 
ordinary Officers
 in his Church, which he then reckons up. First, 
Apostles,
 whom he says Christ did give at his 
ascension
 (though he sent forth some of them before, 
Mat. 10.1.
), because some were then added to the Apostles [
Acts 1.26.
 and 
9.15.
 and all of them were then solemnly installed and publickly confirmed by Christ in their Office, by his visible pouring forth the gifts of the spirit in an extraordinary manner upon them, 
Acts 2. v: 3, 4. 2. Prophets,
 see 
1 Cor. 12.28.
 who foretold things to come; and by the extraordinary as∣sistance of the Spirit, and Divine Revelation, expounded the writings of the old Prophets. 
3. Evangelists,
 who were the companions of the Apostles in their travels 
[Gal. 2.1, 3.],
 and sent out by 
them
 as occasion offered it self, to water such Churches as 
they
 had planted 
[1 Cor. 3.6. 1 Tim. 1, 3.]
 and the
e to remain until the Apostles should recall them, 
2 Tim. 4.9.
 Such were 
Timothy, Titus, Silvanus, Apollos, Tychicus,
 &c. Lastly, 
Pastors
 and 
Teachers,
 which, according to some, are two distinct Offices, and so they think they are distinguished 
Rom. 12.7, 8.
 and 
1 Cor. 12.8.
 In so much that by 
Pastors
 (as they conceive) are meant those, who besides their ability to open the Text, are chiefly gifted 
with the word of wisdom,
 wisely and powerfully to apply the word, for working upon the affections as the matter requireth. And the 
Teacher
 (to them) is the 
Catechist,
 who is gifted with the word of knowledg or ability to open the Scripture, and to establish 
Truth
 and confute 
Error.
 But there are others that take 
Pastors
 and 
Teachers
 for 
one
 and the 
same
 Office. However, the Apostle shews, that all 
these Gifts
 and 
Offices,
 though divers in themselves, yet are an argument to unity, be∣cause they are 
all
 given for the compacting and knitting together the 
Saints
 by the work of the Ministry,
 and for the edifying the body of Christ, and the particular members thereof, in 
faith
 and 
holiness:
 which work of the Mi∣nistry in thus edifying the body of Christ, is to last and continue to the day of judgment, till all that shall be saved, come (one after another), by means of 
one
 and the 
same faith
 (for kind, 
viz.
 faith in Christ) and the acknow∣ledgment of the Son of God, unto a 
perfect man,
 that is, till Christ's my∣stical body shall be compleat and perfect, and attain its full stature. He shews also, that another end unto which the work of preaching is subservient, is, To preserve from error, and that we should not be like children, wavering and inconstant, tossed with every wind of doctrine, nor be deceived with the 
cheat∣ing

 arts
 and treacherous seducings of corrupt men. And further, the Mi∣nistry was ordained not only to preserve from error, but that 
believers
 cleaving to the truth, and living in love, may grow up in Christ
; that is, by ver∣tue and influence derived from him, may make progress in all Christian Ver∣tues. being united to him who is the Head. And that he might shew the 
com∣munion
 that the members of the Church-Militant have with Christ their 
Head,
 and with 
one another;
 and how all Gifts and Offices in the Church tend to the edification of the whole body, he uses a similitude taken from a 
natural body,
 which is wade up of several members joined together, and by cer∣tain 
junctures
 
of supply, viz.
 the 
Nerves
 and 
Arteries
 (by which the blood and spirits are conveyed to the several parts, from the 
Head
 and 
Heart
) the particular members do not only receive nourishment to themselves, but con∣vey it from one to another, so that every member receives due encrease in mea∣sure and proportion to what it was to 
be,
 and to 
act;
 and so the whole body grows to maturity. Thus it is with all 
sincere believers,
 viz. with all the true mem∣bers of the Body of Christ, the Church Militant: They are joined to Christ the 
Head
 by 
faith,
 and to one another by 
love.
 And all the 
Offices
 and 
Functions
 of the Church are 
junctures of supply
 and 
subministration;
 through which, as through so many Channels, the knowledg of saving-truth, and matter of spiritual nourishment, is conveyed from Christ the 
Head,
 to the particular Members. And by that spiritual nourishment communicated to them from Christ (by the means of these conveyances), they grow in grace, accor∣ding to the effectual working of the Holy Ghost, which he works in every member, imparting to it such a measure of grace as he judgeth convenient, according to the place and function it holdeth in the body, and the use which he intends to make of it for the good of the Church: and so the 
whole body
 grows up in 
love
 to Christ the 
Head,
 and the 
particular members
 in 
love
 and 
charity
 one towards another. 
From Ver. 7, to the 17.


2.
 He earnestly beseeches and obtests them in the 
Name
 of the Lord Je∣sus, and as they would answer it to 
Him,
 Not to walk as other unconverted 
Gentiles
 walk, following that which their unrenewed minds dictates unto them, having their understandings darkned, so that they see not that which by the light of Nature they might see, being utterly estranged from that 
spi∣ritual life
 which Christ communicates to those who believe in him. And all this, through the great ignorance that is in them; the cause of which igno∣rance, is the great hardness of heart which they have contracted through a long course and custom in sin; insomuch that they wilfully refuse good, and are obstinately bent upon evil; being hardned, not only 
naturally
 from their birth 
(Psal. 51.5.),
 but 
voluntarily
 by their own wilfulness, 
Exod. 8.15;
 and 
judicially
 by God, 
Exod. 9.12.
 Yea, in a kind of senslesness and fearlesness of God's judgments, he shews, they give up themselves to all impurity, and to the committing of all the unnatural sins of the flesh, and that with gree∣diness. But he tells them, 
the knowledg of Christ,
 and his Doctrine (wherein they had been instructed), was utterly inconsistent with such dissoluteness and prodigious licentiousness; and this they would make to appear, if they had learn'd Christ
 (speaking to them by his Ministers) in such a manner as they ought, and had been inwardly and effectually taught by his spirit, and had re∣ceived the 
divine truth
 as it was preached by himself, and is delivered in his Gospel. Which 
Gospel
 or 
Doctrine
 of Christ, he shews, does injoin them, 
1.
 That they daily endeavour to put off and divest themselves of the 
old cor∣rupt nature
 (which bears a resemblance of the old 
Adam
) by which they were led in the days of their unregeneracy, and which daily grows worse and more corrupt, and more corrupts and depraves a man by its deceitful lust∣ings
, and carries him on to destruction, if it be not resisted and subdued. 
2,
 That they seriously endeavour to have their understandings
 renewed, and to get a new quality of divine light in the supream power of their

 souls
 
[Col. 3.10.]
 and that they put on the new man, taking care that not only their minds be renewed, but their wills and affections also, that they may indeed be 
new creatures,
 and live in the exercise of righteusoness and true holiness; which renewing-work is carried on by God's creating-power, who forms the new man after his own image. 
From Ver. 17, to 15.


3.
 He gives now 
six particular precepts
 belonging to the second Table; 
1.
 To abstain from all 
lying
 (which is a sin prejudicial to humane society), and that they labour always to speak the truth. For we are all members of the same body of mankind. As therefore in the natural body, if one mem∣ber should defraud and circumvent another, it would be accounted monstrous; so it must needs be in them, if they allowed themselves in lying, to the inju∣ring of any man in the world, much more of their fellow-Christians, between whom there is a straiter union. 
2.
 He advises them to take heed of 
sinful anger,
 which usually is rashly kindled 
[Prov. 14.17],
 and upon very light cause; and ordinarily exceeds the just bounds. If they find any such com∣motion or inflammation of mind in themselves as this, he exhorts them to suppress it 
speedily,
 even before 
the Sun go down;
 lest by giving way to it, and persevering in it, they should open the door to Satan to enter into their hearts, who would be ready enough to incite them, by his uncessant suggesti∣ons, to act some great evil or mischief. 
3.
 He exhorts these among them, who in the time of their 
Paganism
 and 
unregeneracy
 had made no consci∣ence of 
Stealing,
 that now they should do so no more; but to be laborious in a good and honest Calling, that they may be able to spare something for the supplying the necessities of others. 
4.
 He gives directions for the right order∣ing of the 
tongue,
 and forbids all corrupt and unsavoury communication and discourse, such as argueth a rotten and an unrenewed heart 
[Mat. 12.35.]
 and which is contagious and infectious to the hearers. He prescribes, That their speech should be seasoned with the salt of divine wisdom, that it may be a means of conveying grace to others, and working gracious effects upon them. And he inforces his exhortation with this reason, Because by corrupt commu∣nication they would 
grieve the holy Spirit of God:
 Not that he can pro∣perly be grieved; but he is said to be 
grieved,
 when we do 
that
 which in it self is apt to grieve him, if he were capable thereof; and which provokes him to do 
that,
 which 
grieved persons
 use to do, namely, to withdraw his gracious and comforting-presence. And all 
true believers
 should especially take heed, that they do not grieve this holy Spirit, because by his renewing and sanctifying of their hearts, he imprints the draught and lineaments, as it were, of his own image upon them, whereby they are not only set apart, and marked, and 
sealed,
 as his peculiar goods; but themselves also may be thereby assured that they are 
His,
 and shall be safely kept under 
that seal,
 until the day of the 
redemption of their bodies,
 that is, the 
resurrection
 and 
day of judgment,
 Rom. 
8.23.
 Lastly, He amplifies and enlarges his second precept concerning the restraining of 
anger,
 by forbidding the several branches, degrees, and effects of it, such as are, 
bitterness, wrath,
 and 
fierceness,
 and such 
an∣ger
 as carries with it desire of revenge. Also 
clamour,
 or 
terous words, and loud menaces, 
evil speaking,
 or disgraceful contumelies; and 
malice,
 which is a rooted and setled anger. And as a proper remedy against all these, he ex∣horts them to exercise mutual kindness; neither carrying it 
loftily,
 nor 
mo∣rosely;
 and to be 
tender-hearted,
 having a sense of the miseries and infir∣mities of others; freely pardoning wrongs and injuries, setting God s ex
mple before their eyes, who freely pardons believers, 
in
 and 
through
 his Son, all their offences. 
From Ver. 25, to the end.


Seeing they did all profess thems
lves to be Children of God by adoption,
 he exhorts them to imitate their heavenly Father in the exercise of 
kind∣ness, mercy,
 and 
forgiveness;
 and 
hereby to evidence themselves to be his

 Children 
indeed.
 And that they should 
walk in love,
 that is, that all their actions towards their Neighbours should be ordered by love: which exhortation he enforces by an argument taken from Christ's 
example,
 who loved us, and eminently evidenced his love, by giving himself freely, and of his own accord, even unto death for us; yea, offering himself a Propitiatory-sacrifice unto God, as was typified by the Levitical offerings and sacrifices; which sacrifices was highly acceptable to God, and is said to be of a 
sweet savour
 unto him [see 
Gen. 8.21.
], because thereby he was satisfied and appeased. Next, he enjoins them to take heed of 
Fornication,
 and all other sorts of uncleanness, so usual among unconverted Gentiles in that City. As also, to beware of 
Covetousness
, or injurious getting Estates. He would have them so free from those vices, that none of them, being Christians, might be once named or suspected as guilty of any of them; and that among themselves these vices might not be once named without detestation; remembring, that they were 
Saints
 by profession, separated from the world, and dedicated unto God. 
3.
 That they would avoid 
all filthy impure discourse
 (which is contrary to decency, Christian gravity, and mo∣desty) and all 
foolish talking
 (which only discovers the 
speakers folly
 and 
indiscretion
) and 
scurrilous jesting
; otherwise 
innocent facetiousness
 whereby the spirits may be refreshed, and the mind more fitted for serious things, is not forbidden. And he intimates to them. That Christians should be careful not only to avoid those things which are palpably gross and evil, and cried out against by all; but also such things which are 
inconvenient,
 and unbeseeming their Christian Pro∣fession. And therefore he exhorteth them, that instead of scurrilous jesting, they should for their mutual cheering, rather recount the favours and mercies they had recei∣ved from God (and particularly that great and wonder∣ful Mercy of redeeming them by his Son) and accor∣dingly excite and stir up one another to praise him for them. And that they might give the more heed to what he now wrote, he tells them, That this they might assure thems
lves of (and they could not be ignorant of it, if they well understood the Gospel), that no 
whoremonger,
 nor 
unclean person,
 nor 
covetous
 man, who is an 
idolater
 (because he sets his prime affections of love, delight, and confidence, upon riches in that measure which is only due to God),
 hath a
y right to the Kingdom of Heaven (which is the Kingdom both of the Father and the Son), unto which we can have no access but 
by
 and 
through
 the Son. And lest any should think within themselves, that these things he had now reproved, were no such 
great matters,
 or at least not so dangerous as he affirmed, he tells them, That all such suggestions were vain and deceiving; for those sins would certainly draw down the wrath of God upon those children of disobedience that went on in them, as they had done upon 
Sodom
 and 
Gomorrah.
 He advises them therefore, Not to join with those that lived in those sins, lest they should partake with them in their pun∣ishments. And he backs his advice with an argument taken from that 
blessed change
 that was wrought in them since they became Christians. They were formerly ignorant of God, and the way to Heaven (having blind minds, un∣renewed hearts, and living prophane lives), and were in a state of misery, liable to the wrath and curse of God [see 
chap. 4.18.
]. But now they were 
light in the Lord,
 that is, enlightned by the Spirit of God, and brought to the saving-knowledg of God and Christ, and into a state of favour with God, and of 
joy
 and 
peace,
 and filial confidence flowing from the s
nse thereof; so that there was as much difference between this their present and former condition, as between darkness and light. And seeing they were so changed, th
y should walk as the children of light. And he tells them, That the fruits of the spirit, dwelling in the hearts of the children of light, are all sorts of

 
goodness, righteousness, truth,
 and 
fidelity.
 And they that are children of the light, and acted by the holy Spirit, must labour to bring forth those fruits, and must diligently search and enquire what is the good and acceptable will of God, as 'tis revealed in his word, that they may conform themselves unto it. And further, he advises them to take heed of being partners or compa∣nions of wicked men in their sins (which are 
works of darkness,
 and which bring those that live and dye in them, 
without repentance,
 unto utter dark∣ness; but instead thereof (as occasion offered it self, and Christian prudence required, they should seriously reprove them: And if they could not conveni∣ently do it by words, yet they should be sure to do it by the holiness of their con∣versation, which might possibly prove a more effectual way of reclaiming them. For (he tells them) the wickedness of the unconverted Gentiles was so abominable, that it was even a shame to mention what was done by them in secret. But
 if those wicked practises were reproved by the light of God's word in the mouth of the 
Reprover,
 or by the light of his holy life, then they would be made manifest in their black and ugly colours, unto the actors of them. For the nature of light is to 
manifest
 and discover all things.


And hereby he shews, they would imitate God himself whose great design in his word is, To convince men of their sins, and to call them to repentance, and thereby to convey the light and knowledg of Jesus Christ unto them. For his perpetual voice in the Gospel is, according to that saying of 
Isaiah,
 chap. 
60.
 v. 
1.
 (to which he seems here to allude) 
Arise thou that sleepest;
 and 
Arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine
 
upon thee with his saving-light.
 In the next place he exhorts them to walk 
circumspectly,
 and with all the prudence they possibly could; and then they will be more fit to reprove sin in others: and they should be careful to 
redeem the time,
 that is, im∣prove it to the best advantage of glorifying God, and doing good to their neigh∣bours, because the days were evil, and full of troubles, so that opportunities of doing good might in a short time be taken from them. And further, that they labour to be acquainted with the 
will of God
 revealed in his word, whereby they may be directed in all their particular duties, and how to avoid the snares and temptations they may meet with. And because they lived among people much given to 
drunkenness,
 he cautions them to take heed of all ex∣cessive and immoderate drinking of wine, which transports men to insolent and outragious practises; and instead of filling themselves with wine (as those Hea∣thens us'd to do), they should labour to be replenish'd with the gifts and graces of the Spirit, which will fill their souls with joy and gladness, more than wine can fill drunkards with merriment. The wine, when it mounts into the head with its fumes, it makes a man talk idly and foolishly, and often transports him to sing lascivious and petulant songs. But when the Holy Ghost fills the heart of any man, if it excite him (as it does sometimes) to 
sing,
 it carries him to sing and set forth the praises of God. He exhorts them there∣fore to converse together as becomes Christians; and if they 
sing,
 that th
ir spiritual joy should vent it self in a melodious singing the praises of God in 
Psalms,
 and 
divine Hymns
 and 
spiritual Songs;
 their 
understandings, hearts,
 and 
affections,
 going along with the 
matter sung;
 so as it may tend to the glory of God, and their mutual edification: For they should be 
always
 that is, upon 
all due occasions,
 ready to offer up praise to God for all his mercies both 
spiritual
 and 
temporal,
 and that 
in
 and 
through
 the inter
es∣sion of Christ, by vertue of whose merits and s
tisf
ction only, our s
rvices of 
prayer
 and 
praise
 find acceptance with God [see 
Eph. 1.6.]. From Ver. 1, to 21.


5.
 Having exhorted them to such duties as b
long to all Christians in 
ge∣neral,
 he comes now to th
se which belong to them, 
as they are members of Families.
 And first, he premizes, that they should all observe that 
order
 which God had placed them in, whether 
natural
 or 
civil,
 and accordingly

 
submit
 themselves one to another, 
in the fear of God;
 that is, so as they may evidence and testife, that they truly fear God, who injoins that submission. This premized, He then exhorts 
Wives
 to submit themselves to their own Husbands, having a due esteem for them, which is a 
great root
 of love and submission. And the manner of this submission must be 
as to the Lord;
 that is, it must be 
willing
 and 
sincere,
 as resembling that submission they perform to Christ. It must flow from conscience and respect to that duty which they owe to Christ, who accounts that subjection flowing from respect to his Ordi∣nance, as obedience to himself. The grounds of this subjection, he shews, must be, 
1.
 The Husband's 
headship
 and 
superiority,
 by reason of his 
Sex;
 in which respect the Man is call'd the 
Image of God
 in a sense peculiar to him∣s
lf which agreeth not to the woman, 
1 Cor. 11.7.
 And God would have some resemblance of Christ's 
headship over the Church,
 held forth in the Husband's over the Wife. And as Christ is the 
Saviour of his body,
 and his dominion tends to the procuring and bringing about the 
Church
's good and salvation; so the Husband's superiority and authority is given him for the procuring the good and welfare of his Wife; namely, that he may defend her from injuries, provide comfortably for her, as he is able; and direct her in things necessary, according to his power. And upon this account the Wife ought to practise this duty of submission, because her Husband's power and authority over h
r, is for her good. For his dominion is not to be 
tyrannical
 or 
rigorous,
 but 
loving, gentle,
 and 
amiable;
 and such as the Wife may look upon as a 
mercy
 to her self, as well as a 
dignity
 to her Husband. And as Christ is the 
Head
 of the Church for 
its good,
 so the 
Husband
 is appointed the head of the Wife 
for her good
 and 
benefit.
 As therefore all that are 
regenerate,
 and 
true members
 of the Church, do willingly subject themselves to Christ; so he shews 'tis fit that 
Wives
 should be subject to their own Husbands 
in every thing
 that is lawful and honest. In the next place he comes to the duty of 
Husbands;
 exhorting them, Not to abuse that su∣periority which God hath given them over their Wives, by a 
domineering, harsh,
 or 
bitter
 carriage [see 
Col. 3.18.
]; but instead thereof, to 
love
 them with a 
special
 and 
conjugal love,
 such as no other must share in. This he inforces from Christ's example, who loved his Church not in 
words
 only, but in 
deeds;
 testifying the greatness of his love, by giving himself for it [see 
v. 2.
 of this 
chap.
], that he might translate it from a state of 
sin
 and 
death,
 to a state of 
grace
 and 
life;
 that he might regenerate and san∣ctifie it, that he might cleanse it, and do away the 
guilt
 of sin cleaving to believers, 
by justifying their persons [Rom. 8.1.];
 and the 
filth,
 and 
power,
 and 
activity
 of sin, by the renovation of their natures. And the external means by which be effecteth all this, are, 
1. Baptism,
 call'd here, the 
washing of water.
 And, 
2. The Ministry of his word.
 And his end in thus cleansing and sanctifying his Church in this life, is, That it may be holy, not having blemish, spot, or deformity (that is, exempt from blame and reprehension); when it shall be presented to himself, as the Bride to the Bride∣groom, for the solemn consummation of the begun-marriage, 
Rev. 19.7.
 And according to this example, Husbands ought to love their Wives even as their own bodies, For there is so near a union between them, that he that loves his Wife, loves himself. 'Tis therefore as unnatural for a man, not to love his Wife, as to hate his own flesh; which all men are so far from doing, that they nourish and cherish it, and do all things imaginable for its preserva∣tion. And after the same manner does Christ also nourish and cherish his Church, and provide all things necessary for it, because his Church is as nearly join'd to him, as 
Eve
 was to 
Adam,
 of whom (being made of a rib taken out of his side with flesh on it) he said, 
Gen. 2.23. This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my self.
 So all believers, by reason of the spiritual union betw
en Christ and them, are members of his 
body,
 and as it were of his 
flesh
 and 
bones,
 as 
Eve
 was said to be of 
Adam
's. And

 because the Wife is so nearly conjoin'd to her Husband, that she is 
bone of his bone,
 and 
flesh of his flesh;
 therefore a man is to leave Father and Mother, and cleave to his Wife (that is, to love his Wife more than them), and they 
two
 
shall be one flesh;
 that is, 
as one flesh,
 or 
one body.
 And this union between 
Man
 and 
Wife,
 he shews, resembles the union between Christ and his Church, which he calls 
a great mystery,
 because Christ and Believers come thereby to be not 
one flesh,
 but 
one spirit, 1
 Cor. 
6.17.
 But leaving this spiritual union of Christ and his Church, he concludes the matter he was upon, exhort∣ing the Husband to love his Wife as himself, and the Wife to reverence her Husband. 
From Ver. 21, to the end.


6.
 He enjoins 
Children
 to be obedient to their Parents in 
all things
 that are pleasing to the Lord. 
1.
 From the equity of it, Because the 
Law
 of God and Nature requires it. 
2.
 Because this is the first Commandment of the se∣cond Table, which hath a particular promise annexed to it, viz. 
length of days;
 which promise is either actually fulfill'd by God; or else by change of the benefit he gives them a much better life in his own Kingdom for it. 
From Ver. 1, to 4.


7.
 He enjoins 
Fathers,
 that they be not too 
severe
 towards their Chil∣dren, nor abuse their fatherly power over them, by unjustly provoking them, or imbittering their spirits, which is done by denying them what is fit,
 or commanding them things in themselves unlawful, or inveighing against them with bitter words
, or by immoderate correcting of them. But he tells them, their duty on the contrary is, To bring them up 
in good nurture,
 and to give them such 
admonitions
 and instructions as may teach them to live ac∣cording to the Doctrine of our Saviour, and the Rule of the Gospel. 
Ver. 4.


8.
 He enjoins 
Servants, in all lawful things
 to be obedient to their own Masters (who ac
ording to the Laws of m
n, and in things temporal be∣longing to the fl
sh or body, have the rule over them, though not over their Consciences); that they 
serve
 them with reverence, and fear
 of offending them; that they serve them 
faithfully
 and 
sincerely,
 and with regard to Christ's command; and so in obeying them, they will s
rve Christ: that they serve them not only with 
eye-service,
 when they are present to overl
ok them, and that meerly that they may please 
them,
 and avoid 
their
 displea∣sure; but that they may approve themselves the faithful servants of Christ (who sees the heart), and such as desire to do what God enjoins them, chearfully; and accordingly set themselves to serve their Masters with 
good will,
 and a voluntary obedience; designing thereby not only to please them, but God also; and to serve 
Him,
 in duly serving their Masters, according to his command, remembring, that God will faithfully re
ompence either here (as he does sometimes) or hereafter [see 
Col. 3.24.
] all those who make conscience of doing good, and performing their duty as service to him, and that whether they be bond-men or free. 
From Ver. 5, to 9.


9.
 He exhorts 
Masters,
 in doing the duty of their places towards their Servants, That they also do it as unto the Lord; that is, so as to endeavour to please and approve themselves unto God therein
. And particularly, that they exercise their authority over them, not 
wrathfully
 and 
imperiously,
 but 
mildly
 and 
gently,
 remembring that they also have a Master above them in

 Heaven, who will bring them to account, as for other things, so for their car∣riage towards s
rvants; for there is no respect of persons with him. 
Ver. 9.


10.
 In the conclusion of this Epistle, he encourages them to 
be strong in the Lord,
 that is, to act their faith on his Almighty Power and Strength; and to 
put on the whole armour of God,
 that is, all those divine and spiritual 
defensatives
 and 
weapons
 which Christ hath afforded them for the repelling of all the subtil temptations and stratagems of Satan. For they are to remember▪ that the Christians warfare is not only against 
flesh
 and 
blood,
 but the whole Army of unclean spirits, the usurping 
Princes
 and 
Potentates
 of this world (the greatest part whereof lies in darkness and ignorance) who r
ve about in the regions of the air
. Their danger therefore being so great, th
y had need be harn
ss d with the 
whole Armour
 of God, that they may be able to r s
st in the time of temptation, and to hold out to the end against all the assaults of 
Satan,
 or the allurements of the 
flesh
 and the 
world;
 that having done all required of them, they may be able to stand in the day of batt
l. The particular pieces of 
spiritual armour
 he advises them to put on, are th
se: 
1.
 The Military 
Girdle
 of Truth and Since∣rity. 
2.
 The 
Breast-plate
 of Righteousness, whereby we are inclin'd, and do accordingly endeavour to give b
th to God and man their 
due
 and 
right,
 Acts 
24.16. 3.
 Seeing the way to Heaven is not 
smooth
 and 
eeven,
 but hath much trouble and temptation, many piercing briers and thorns, and much ruggedness in it, they should prepare themselves with Christian 
courage
 and 
resolution
 (by a frequent meditation on the Gospel which brings peace and salvation) to pass through those difficulties and hardships, and thereby they shall have their feet, as it were, shod and fenc'd against the inconvenience and craggedness of the way▪ as knowing God to be their reconciled Father in Christ, and that there is no wrath in their cup, and that their wearisom journey shall have a happy close. 
4.
 Above all the rest, they should be sure to take the 
Shield of Faith,
 by which we believe the truth of God's word in general, and in a special manner do receive and rest on Christ for pardon and grace, as he is offered in the Gospel; which Faith, as a 
Shield,
 guardeth against temptations of all sorts, helpeth to repel them; yea, if any of the 
fiery darts
 of Satan, 
that is,
 his violent temptations, be shot into the soul, this grace quencheth the heat and horror of them, and the despair they are apt to kindle. 
5.
 He exhorts them to take the 
Helmet
 of salvation, that is, the 
Hope
 of salvation 
[1 Thes. 5.8.],
 which is a grace whereby we patiently expect salvation 
[Tit. 1.2.]
 according to the promise of God; which assured and well-grounded hope of eternal salvation, supplies the place of an 
Helmet,
 se∣curing the 
head,
 and so fortifying and magnanimating the Christian in his spiritual warfare. 
6.
 They should take the 
word of God,
 which supplieth the place of a 
Sword,
 to fight with against our spiritual Enemies, and is call'd here the 
Sword of the Spirit,
 because the Spirit of God hath revealed it 
[2 Pet. 1.21.],
 and doth join his own power and efficacy with it, to ena∣ble us thereby to resist and drive away the devil, to chase away temptations, and to slay and kill the inward lusts and corruptions of our own hearts. 
7.
 The 
seventh piece
 of Armour, or rather a 
duty
 to be practis'd, and a means to be used for the obtaining of all those forementioned pieces of spiri∣tual Armour, from God, together with the right skill to make use of them against our spiritual Enemies, is 
Prayer,
 whereby we pres
nt our desires to God for things agreeable to his will 
[1 Joh. 5.14.]
 in the name of Christ 
[Joh. 16.23.]
 with conf
ssion of our sins, and a thankful acknowledgment of his mercies, 
Phil. 4.6.
 Which duty he shew should be thus performed. 
1.
 They must pray 
always,
 that is▪ upon 
every occasion,
 in all their necessi∣ties, and in every business, as the matter requires; yet not so as never to 
in∣termit,
 but so as not to 
give quite over,
 but to return to it again. 
2.
 They must use all kinds of prayer, namely, not only 
prayer
 
strictly taken,


 whereby we seek those good things we want, from God; but also 
Supplica∣tion,
 whereby we deprecate evils and judgments, whether felt or feared. 
3.
 They must pray 
in the spirit,
 that is, with the heart and spirit, being stirr'd up and assisted by the Spirit of God, 
Rom. 8.26, 27. 4.
 To prayer they must join 
watchfulness.
 And 
5. Importunate perseverance,
 reiterating their pe∣titions for the same blessings, as oft as occasion offereth it self, until they be granted. See 
2 Cor. 12.8. Luke 18.5.
 And lastly, Their prayers must be offered up not only for themselves, but for others; none are to be excluded, who are in a capacity to be bettered by them [see 
1 Joh. 5.16.
]; no, not our very Enemies; but the 
Saints,
 as they are to have the chiefest room in our hearts, so also the chiefe
t share in our prayers. And the Apostle desires, that he himself in particular may be remembred in their prayers, desiring them to beg of God on his behalf, That God would give him a gift and dex∣terity of ready uttering, and expressing his conceptions in his publick preach∣ing, together with boldn ss and courage, conjoin'd with gravity and prudence, to deliver all his message as he ought to do, without fear or partiality; that he might make known the mystery of the Gospel with which he was intrusted. For the maintaining of which, though he was p
rsecuted, and at pr
sent in bonds
, yet he did still continue to preach it, as an Ambassador of Christ. 
From Ver. 10, to 20.


He now concludes his Epistle, telling them, That he had sent 
Tychicus
 (whom he highly commends as a faithful Minister in the word of the Lord) to inform them particularly of his condition, and that he might comfort their hearts by his presence, and by relating to them God's gracious dealing with him in his sufferings. He shuts up all, wishing unto them, 
1. Peace,
 that is, peace with God with their own consciences, and with one another, and all sorts of prosperity. 
2.
 An encrease of mutual 
love
 and charity, and of 
faith;
 all which graces flow from God the Father as the Fountain, and from Jesus Christ as the Conduit-pipe, through the vertue of whose merits and interces∣sion, all saving-benefits are conveyed unto us. He concludes all, wishing that the favour of God, and his grace, may be daily more and more manifested towards all them that love our Lord Jesus in 
sincerity,
 that is, that mani∣fest the ardor and sincerity of their love to Christ, by the purity and incor∣ruptness of their lives and conversations. 
From Ver. 20, to the end.








SECT. XI.


ABOUT this time, as 'tis probable, the Apostle wrote his Epistle to the 
Hebrews
 (that is, the believing-
Jews,
 the posterity of 
Abraham
), and sent it by 
Mark;
 who having delivered it where 
Paul
 appointed him. went away to 
Peter
 now at 
Babylon;
 for 
Peter
 mentioneth 
Mark
 there with him, 1 
Pet.
 5.13; and seems to speak directly of this Epistle in those words of his, 2 
Pet.
 3.15, 
And account that the long-suffering of the Lord is salvation, even as our beloved Brother Paul, according unto the wisdom given unto him, hath written unto you.
 Now that 
Paul
 did write unto them while he was a Prisoner at 
Rome,
 those words 
Heb.
 10.34, do sufficiently intimate, 
For ye had compassion of me in my bonds,
 &c.


The occasion of this Epistle seems to be this. Many of the believing-
Hebrews
 had entertained the faith of Christ, and yet adhered too much to 
Moses
 and the 
Levitical Priesthood
 and 
Ordinances,
 and possibly were something doubtful in their minds whether 
Jesus of Nazareth
 were indeed the 
true Messias
 or no. Yet for their entertaining him so far as they did, they were not only reproached and reviled by their Countrey-men, as 
Apostates from the Law;
 but were greatly persecuted by them. The Apostle understanding their state, wrote this Epistle, partly to 
instruct
 them, and partly to 
support
 and encourage them.


The Parts of it are two:



1. 
Informatory.


2. 
Hortatory.




In the 
first
 he informs them of the transcendent excellency and dignity of Christ's 
Person
 and 
Office;
 shewing and decla∣ring, (1.) That he was 
God,
 ch. 1. (2.) More excellent than 
Angels,
 notwithstanding his Humanity and Humiliation, the c
uses whereof are there assigned, 
ch.
 2. (3.) A more excel-Prophet than 
Moses.
 By 
Moses
 the people were led but only towards 
Canaan.
 By faith in Christ believers enter into a better r
st 
ch.
 3. and 4, to 
ver.
 14. (4.) A more excellent 
High-Priest
 than 
Aaron,
 from 
v
 14 of 
ch.
 4, to 
v.
 11 of 
ch.
 5. (5.) A more excellent 
King
 and 
Priest
 than 
Melchizedeck.
 In treating of whom he prefaces something by way of reproof concerning their

 dulness and improficiency, and exhorts them to make progress (and not to stick in their first principles), and to be stedfast in the faith, representing to them the horrible danger of re∣lapsing after they have tasted the gifts of the Spirit. From 
v.
 11 of 
ch.
 5, to 
v.
 19 of 
ch.
 10.


In the Second part, he practically exhorts them to sundry Christian duties. From 
v.
 19 of 
ch.
 10, to the end.


THE Apostle intending now to represent to the 
Christian Hebrews
 the ex∣cellency of the 
New Testament
 above the 
Old,
 he shews them,
 That God in the former ages of the world spake to their Fathers and Ancestors by the Pro∣phets, manifesting his will unto them 
by parts
 
and piece-meals,
 now a part of it, and then another (as the capacity of the people in sundry times did require), and in 
divers manners
, sometimes by 
lively voice,
 sometimes by 
visions
 and 
dreams,
 sometimes by 
inspiration
 and immediate revelation, sometimes by 
Urim
 and 
Thummim,
 sometimes by 
signs
 from Heaven, some∣times by 
Types
 and 
symbolical representations;
 but now in these 
last days
, that is, these 
Gospel-days,
 he hath spoken to us (who are the children and successors of the Fathers) by his Son: See 
Mat. 11.27.
 And having mentioned the 
Son of God,
 the true Messias, the Saviour of the world; he sets before them the transcendent excellency of his 
Person,
 declaring and asserting, 
1.
 His 
Deity
 and 
Godhead,
 and so pointing out his 
Kingly-office.
 This he proves by many arguments. 
(1.)
 He is the 
Son of God,
 and so more ex∣cellent than all the 
Prophets
 by whom God formerly spake. 
(2.)
 As by na∣ture he is truly and properly the Son of God, and Heir and Lord-Proprietor of all creatures both in heaven and earth; so he was ordained and appointed to 
be so,
 as he is 
Mediator,
 by the External Counsel of God the Father, 
Psal. 2.8.
 that as the Father is 
Lord over all,
 so the Son might be also. And 'twas very fit it should be so, because 
(3.)
 it was by him, as having his being from eternity, and being the 
Eternal Wisdom of the Father
 that the 
Worlds were made,
 that is, all things 
above
 and 
below, visible
 and 
invi∣sible;
 by him (I say) not as a meer Instrument, but as a primary and prin∣cipal Agent therein with the Father, 
Joh. 5.19. Joh. 1.3. Col. 1.16. (4.)
 He is the 
brightness
 of his Father's glory, and the 
express Image
 of his Person. As the brightness issuing from the 
Sun
 is of the same nature with the 
Sun,
 and cometh naturally and necessarily from the Sun, and is of the same conti∣nuance with the Sun, and yet the Sun and the brightness are distinct each from other, and the one is not the other; so the 
Father
 and the 
Son
 are of one and the same essence, they are 
coeternal;
 the Son is from the Father by eternal generation, and the Person of the one is distinct from the other, 
Joh. 5.17.
 And lastly, The incomprehensible glory of the Father most brightly shi∣neth forth in the Son, 
Joh. 17.5.
 And 
He is the express image of his per∣son,
 that is, as no one thing can be more like another, than the picture or image on the thing stamped, as to the Seal or Instrument wherewith it was stamped, the one carrying the very form of the other; so Christ is the 
express image
 of the Person of the Father: First, As he is the second Person in the Sacred Trinity; the whole Divine Essence, and all the Divine Properties being communicated to him. 
2.
 As he is 
Immanuel,
 God with us, his Humane Na∣ture being hypostatically united to the Divine Nature; and so he is visibly the Character or express Image of God. For in Christ incarnate, the Divine Pro∣perties

 are most conspicuous, as, 
Almighty Power, Infinite Wisdom, Truth, Justice, Mercy,
 and the like. In Christ as 
God-man,
 dwelt 
all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,
 Col. 
2.9.
 And in this respect Christ saith of him∣self, 
Joh. 14.9. He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father also.
 As he that seeth the 
Character
 or 
Figure
 which is on the thing stamped, sees therein the figure that is on the Seal wherewith it was stamped. 
5.
 He 
up∣holds, preserves,
 orders, and governs all things made, by the word of his power
, that is, by his powerful Providence. As the Fa∣ther supports and g
verns all things made, so doth the Son. 
6.
 By offering up himself a Sacrifice on the Cross
, he hath done that which is sufficient to purge the soul from the guilt of sin, and which actually doth it, when it is rightly applied; so that his blood 
doth truly cleanse from all sin, 1
 Joh. 
1.7.
 The Priest's Sacrifice was of unreasonable beasts, but Christ's Sacri∣fice was of Himself. 'Tis true, only the 
Humane Na∣ture
 of Christ was offered up, 
1 Pet. 3.18.
 and 
1 Pet. 4.1.
 yet by reason of the hypostatical union of his two Natures in one Person, He is said to 
give himself,
 Eph. 
5.2.
 and 
to offer up himself,
 Heb. 
7.27.
 and 
to sacrifice himself,
 Heb. 
9.26. 7.
 Having by his death offered up a suf∣ficient Sacrifice for the expiation of our sins, he rose from the dead, and ascend∣ed into Heaven, and sate down on the right hand of the Throne of the Ma∣jesty on high, there to continue an High-Priest for ever to make intercession for us: so that he was so far from being vanquish'd and swallowed up by his suf∣ferings for our sins, as thereby way was made for his entrance into the highest degree of glory and dignity that could be attained unto. 
8.
 The Apostle shews, That Christ is above 
Angels,
 having a more excellent name than they, by how much the name 
Son
 is more excellent than the name 
Angel
 or 
Messenger.
 And the 
name of the Son of God
 is by inheritance due to Him, being ac∣cording to his 
Divine Nature
 the Son of God by eternal generation; and as 
Man,
 being God's Son, because by assumption of the Humane Nature into per∣sonal union with the Godhead, he is made so to be, 
Luke 1.35.
 So that the same person who was the 
Son of God,
 and to be incarnate, is now the Son of God in
arnated. Further, they might consider, that Christ's 
Divine
 nature is infinitely more excellent than the Angelical: yea, his 
Humane
 nature, by vertue of its hypostatical union with the Divine, hath likewise a dignity transcendently surpassing the Angelical nature; Christ having, as 
Mediator
 between God and man a more eminent Function than belongs to any Angel. This last argument the Ap stle confirms with eight reasons in this Chapter, whereof the s
ven first are taken out of so many places of Scripture; 
1.
 From 
Psal. 2.7.
 where God the Father speaking of his Son's incarnation (which was first wrought 
in
 and 
by
 his conception, and then manifested to the world by his birth), 
Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,
 that is, de∣clared thee to the world to be my only begotten Son. As if God the Father had thus said to the Son: 
Thou, and thou alone, art truly and properly my Son, not by grace or adoption, but by nature and eternal genera∣tion; and now I do in this last age of the world declare thee so to be, by thine Incarnation, Doctrine, Works, Resurrection from the dead, and Ascension into Heaven; whereby it manifestly appears, that thou, infi∣nitely surpassest all the Angels in Heaven. 2.
 From 
2
 Sam. 
7.14. I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son.
 In which place, in 
Solomon
 the Type, God promises the sending of the 
Messias,
 whom he would openly acknowledg for his Son, and so declare him to the world. 
3.
 From 
Psal. 97.7.
 which contains a prophecy of Christ's Royalty. Now says the Apostle, when God the Father speaks there of bringing in again

 his 
first begotten
, in a glorious manner to judg the world, he says, 
Let the Angels of God worship him.
 And therefore 
he
 that is to be worshipped, is greater than 
they
 that are to worship him. 
4.
 From 
Psal. 104.4.
 where the 
Psalmist
 speaking of God's glo∣rious power in creating the heavens, and the waters, clouds and winds under the heavens; before he descen∣deth lower to the earth, and the things thereon, he mentioneth the 
Angels,
 whom he hath made spiritual substances, speedy and active, of a lively and swift na∣ture (not flesh, which is lumpish and heavy), and useth them as his Ministers, in executing his great works both in heaven and earth; and sheweth, how they are ready to serve him at his beck, as the Winds, and flashes of Lightning, and other Meteors are
. So that the ar∣gument from that place lyes thus: They that are made 
Spirits
 and 
Ministers,
 are inferior to him that made them so: but so the Angels were made by Christ; therefore they are inferior to him. 
5.
 From 
Psal. 45.6, 7;
 which Psalm declareth, That Christ is 
true God;
 that, as 
Mediator,
 he hath an everlasting King∣dom
, which began at his ascension, when he was actually set upon his Throne in Heaven; that his go∣vernment is a righteous government; that he ordereth all things justly and righteously, loving righteousness, and hating iniquity. And that he might be such a King, 
God
 (even his God and Father, who deputed and sent him, and entred into Covenant with him, as he was 
Head
 of his mystical Body, 
Isa. 42.6.49.8.
) anointed his Human Nature (yet so as united to the Divine Nature, both making one Person) with the Oil of gladness, that is, with the 
gifts
 and 
graces of the Holy Ghost,
 which quickned and made him joyful in all his undertakings for our redemption, and which re∣joyce the hearts of all such as receive of these gifts and graces from him. Which anointing he received, not in 
measure,
 but abundantly, above what was ever impart∣ed either to Angels, or any of the members
 of his mystical Body. 
6.
 From 
Psal. 102.25, 26, 27.
 from whence he proves, That the 
Son
 is 
Jehovah,
 one in essence with the 
Father,
 and the 
Holy Ghost,
 who in the beginning of time
 created both Heaven and Earth, and all the creatures therein; theref
re he was 
before them all,
 and 
eternal,
 and so more excellent than any of them. And further to prove this, he shews, That the 
heavens shall wax old like a garment;
 that is, shall decay by degrees, or rather at last shall come to an end; and as 
Vestures,
 when they are of no longer use, are folded
 up, and thrown aside; so when these natural Heavens shall be of no longer use, th
y

 shall as to their present condition be laid aside, and God shall change them; for though their substance shall be the same, yet in respect of their qualities they shall be changed, and shali be made now more glorious than before, 
Isa. 34.4. Isa. 66.22.
 And in that they shall at length be changed, they may be said to perish, 
Mar. 13.31.
 The Heavens may be said to wax old as doth a gar∣ment, in that they are appointed to an end; to an end, I say, of what they are now, 
2 Pet. 3.10.
 But Christ is Immuta∣ble
, 
Mal. 3.6.
 For as he was before all time, and continueth in all ages, so he will beyond all time continue invariable. This 
Immutability
 attributed to Christ, is properly to be understood of his Divine Nature, which was no ways altered by assuming the Manhood, but re∣maineth the very same it was before. And in regard of his 
Humane Nature,
 his 
years shall not fail,
 in that 
being raised from the dead, he dieth no more,
 Rom. 
6.9,
 but continueth and liveth for ever, 
Heb. 7.24, 25. 7.
 From 
Psal. 110.1,
 where God the Father in his eternal Decree predestinating his Son to be the Messias, and to execute in time the Of∣fice of a Mediator, saith unto him, 
Sit thou on my right hand
 (importing the super-eminent degree of Honour and Dignity he should be advanced to after his Ascension, as a consequent and reward of his exina∣nition and Passion) 
until I make thine enemies
 (viz. all that are enemies to thy Kingdom, the Devil, Anti∣christ, all wicked men) 
thy footstool;
 that is, utterly subdue them, and put them under thy feet.
 Not that the 
Son
 shall leave off all Rule and Reign; but that he shall then leave off the administration of that Dele∣gation which he had formerly undertaken as 
Mediator;
 there being then no more need of it, or of his using those means and actings which formerly he did, when his enemies are all fully overcome, and his Church fully gathered. And thenceforth he shall reign together with his Father to all eternity, and of his Kingdom there shall be no end, 
Dan. 7.14. Luke 1.33.
 So that the Apostle's Argument lyes thus: He that sits at God's right hand in glory and dignity, is much more excellent than those Creatures that are only Ministers; and such is the condition of Christ, as he proves from this verse; and such is the condition of Angels, as he proves from the next. For they are 
ministring spirits
 sent forth from God (having no other Lord that hath power to send them) to mi∣nister for the good of them who shall inherit salvation, that is, that blessed and glorious estate which is in Heaven reserved for the whole mystical body of Christ. For being the children of God, they are joint-heirs with Christ, 
Rom. 8.16, 17.
 and therefore God appoints these his servants to attend them for their good. 
From v. 1, to the end.


Wherefore seeing Christ was a 
Teacher
 so much superior to all that came before him (yea, to the 
Angels
 themselves), he shews, they ought greatly to heed, and regard, and faithfully retain the Doctrine of the Gospel, which had been preached to them, lest they be like 
leaking-vessels,
 letting it slip out of their minds and memories. For if the 
Law
 given by the ministry of An∣gels 
[Acts 7.38.]
 was firm, stable, and inviolable, and might not be neglected or dis
beyed, and the transgressors
 and disobeyers of it, were justly and severely punished; he asks, how could they expect to escape who neglect the 
Gospel
 which reveals the great salvation purchased by Christ. Which glorious Gospel was first published by Christ himself, in the most clear and distinct manner that ever it was published, and was confirmed by his Apostles,

 who heard his Sermons, and saw his works, God bearing witness to their Doctrine by sundry glorious miracles, and the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost poured out upon them, according to his own good will and pleasure. 
From Ver. 1, to 5.


And that he may further perswade them, that more heed is to be given to the 
word of Christ,
 than to the 
word
 spoken by Angels; he shews them, That God hath given a greater 
authority
 to 
Christ,
 than ever he did to 
Angels.
 For He hath not put the 
Church,
 or 
Kingdom of the Messiah,
 of which here he treats (called here 
 
the world to come,
 in re∣ference to the 
Old-Testament-times,
 and to those who lived before Christ was exhibited in the flesh, and longed to see this 
new world,
 see 
Mat. 13.17.
) in subjection to 
Angels,
 but unto his 
Son,
 and that as He is 
God-man:
 and therefore in his Kingdom the Angels are to be in subjection to him, and not to be adored with him. This he proves from 
Psal. 8,
 wh
re what the Prophet spake of 
Man
 in the general, the Apostle shews may in a 
higher
 and 
sublimer
 sense be understood of 
Christ,
 who in the state of his humiliation was (to outward appearance) an ordinary man) yet God was mindful of him, and careful to afford him all needful succour; and though for a small space of time, 
viz.
 about thirty three years, he subjected him to a condition inferior to that of An∣gels (that he might perform all works of obedience and suffering that were requisite for the accomplishing man's redemption
: y
t after he had suffered in the flesh, he highly exalted him, and advanced him to 
Royal dignity
 (the most excellent that can be), 
crowning
 him with glory and honour, and gi∣ving him authority and dominion over the works of his hands, and putting all the creatures whatsoever (yea, the good Angels and wicked Spirits) in subjection under his feet; so that all must yeild obeysance to him, 
some
 as his 
enemies
 perforce; 
others
 willingly. And in that the Father is said to have put all the creatures whatsoever under him, 'tis manifest he hath left no∣thing unsubjected to him. And though we see not, says he, for the present all his enemies perfectly subdued, yet they shall be in due time; so that there is a further subduing of them still to be expected. However this we know, That 
Jesus,
 who in the state of his humiliation (that he might suffer death, and be a sacrifice to expiate the sins of men) was made, for a little time, lower than the Angels, is now 
highly exalted:
 And the reason why he was thus humbled, was, that he might through the free favour of God 
tast
 
death,
 that is, partake of it (though not be swallowed up by it) 
, for the redeeming of all
 sorts of men, and of every particular person that shall repent and believe in him, see 
Joh. 10.15.
 For God (who is the supream Cause and untimate End of all things) having a purpose to bring many sons to glory
 saw it convenient to make 
Him
 (who was to be the 
Captain
 of their salvation, and to guide and lead them to heaven) perfectly, and every way fit for that office, by exposing Him to many sufferings, and a cruel death, and so to make him a compleat and perfect Redeemer; there needing nothing more to be added to his sufferings for the satisfying of Divine Justice, and meriting 
remission of sins
 and eternal salvation. For, though Christ was ever perfect in himself; yet for bringing us to glory, much was wanting, till he had finished his sufferings. But by his sufferings he made up whatsoever was requisite thereunto. And if any should ask, How could Christ suffer and

 dye? he answers, That Christ, who sanctifies us by his holy Spirit, took our humane nature upon him (a humane soul and body) and so became of one nature with us, for which cause he is not asham'd to call and acknowledg 
his sanctified ones
 for his brethren, as he proves from 
Psal. 22.22;
 where, though in the 
first sense
 the words may be understood of 
David,
 who pro∣fesses that he will declare the 
Name,
 that is, the 
Attributes
 and 
Counsels
 of God in the midst of the Israelites, his brethren [see 
Deut. 17.20.
]; yet in a 
sublimer sense
 they ought to be understood of Christ, who declared the 
Name,
 that is, 
whatsoever is meet to be known of God,
 viz. his Di∣vine Excellencies, Counsels, and Actions
, and that 
unto his brethren,
 see 
Joh. 20.17.
 And as 
David
 sang praises to God in the midst of the Church or Congregation and Assembly of God's people; so did Christ pnblickly set forth God's praise among his Disciples, 
Mat. 26.30.
 And as a further evi∣dence of Christ's 
Humanity,
 the Apostle brings in two other Testimonies; the first from 
Psal. 18.2,
 where Christ, under the type of 
David,
 professes to 
trust in God,
 and to rest on him, to be supported and carried through all his suffer∣ings and undertakings: And from 
Isa. 8.18.
 where the Prophet 
Isaiah
 declares, That himself, and the Children God had given him, were for 
signs,
 as their names intimated, to foretell and fore-signifie the good∣ness of God to the Jews, and th
t he would be with them, and help them against their enemies. Now that which was 
historically
 true of 
Isaiah
 and his children, the Apostle shews may be fitly applied to Christ. The Prophet and his Children were a type of 
Christ,
 and of the 
faithful
 which believe in him (whom God hath of his free-grace given unto him, to be fitted and brought to glory) who are 
his children,
 begotten to him by his Spirit in the Ministry of his Gospel; whom (by way of reioycing for the good success of his Ministry) he presents with himself unto his Father, as one who faith∣fully fulfilled the charge committed to him, in fitting them for glory, and bringing them to it, though in the world they were accounted 
Wonders
 and 
Monsters.
 The Apostle further shews, That Christ, out of love to his Chil∣dren, would partake of the same humane nature with them, that he might by his own death on the Cross satisfie the Justice of God for them, and so eva∣cuate and destroy the power of the Devil, which he, 
as an Executioner,
 hath by the Law against sinners. And another end of his death, was, That he might deliver his Children from the fear of death (both temporal and eternal), to the bondage of which they were before subject. And being to suffer death for those ends, certain it is, that he took not on him the na∣ture of Angels, but the humane nature, and was of the very substance of man, and was born of the seed of 
Abraham,
 to whom the promise that the 
Messiah
 should come of his seed, was often made 
[Gen. 12.3.
 and 
18.18.
 and 
22.18.].
 Wherefore it became him in all things to be like his brethren, sin only excepted 
[Heb. 4.15.],
 that he might be a compassionate High-Priest, and faithful in all that he was to transact and negotiate with God on the behalf of man, and that he might make atonement and reconciliation for sinners by the Sacrifice of Himself. And lastly, That having himself been expos'd to so many sufferings and temptations, he might more readily pity and succour his members when they are tempted. 
From Ver. 5, to the end.


The Apostle having distinctly set forth the 
Divine Nature
 of Christ, and his 
Kingly-office,
 in the first Chapter, and his 
Humanity
 in the Second; he now comes to set forth his 
Prophetical-office
 in this, and part of the next Chapter. And that he might set forth his 
Prophetical-function
 with grea∣ter advantage, in the first place he exhorts the believing-
Hebrews,
 to whom

 he wrote (who were effectually called to embrace the faith of Christ, and thereby raised to a hope and expectation of heavenly things) to consider and ponder in their hearts the 
high dignity and excellency
 of Christ (that so they might constantly adhere to him, and obey him) who was sent with 
Com∣mission
 from his Father to preach that Gospel to them which they professed to believe, and to be their High-Priest
 also, to make atonement for their sins. Of the 
first
 of these he treats in this, and to the 
14
 verse of the next Chapter, and then proceeds to speak of the other. For the setting forth of his 
Prophetical-office,
 he declares th
se parti∣culars: 
1.
 Because the Jews had generally too high a conceit of 
Moses,
 and were apt to profess themselves his Disciples in opposition to Christ [see 
Joh. 9.28.
]; he tells them, That as 
Moses
 was faithful in deliver∣ing all things committed to his charge, that either concern'd the service of God, or the welfare of the people of the Jews: So Christ was as faithful in delivering the mind and will of his Father, who deputed and appointed him to this Office. He was as faithful in his message for the changing the 
Levitical Ordinances
 and 
Priesthood,
 as 
Moses
 was in appointing them. 
2.
 He shews, that 
Christ
 was much to be preferr'd before 
Moses,
 though 
Moses,
 compar'd with other men, was a person very extraordinary. And for the proof of this, he makes use of 
two Metaphors,
 the one taken from a 
Builder,
 and 
an House;
 the other from an 
Heir
 and a 
Servant. 1.
 As the 
Builder
 of the House is justly accounted worthy of more honour than the House; so Christ (who is the Builder
 of the House (his Church) is worthy of more honour than 
Moses,
 who is himself but a part of that House. And as no house, nor part of an house, is built by it self; so neither is the Church. But Christ, who is God, is the builder of the Church, and every member of it, and also of all things else; and so more excellent than 
Moses. 2.
 As a 
Son
 and 
Heir
 ruling over his own house, is more excellent than any person that is only a Servant therein; So Christ is to be look'd upon as a Son, and 
Moses
 but as a Servant. 
Moses
 was faithful indeed, in the Church, as a 
Servant,
 to te∣stifie and declare that which he had received, and which was afterwards more fully and openly to be spoken and declared concerning Christ and his King∣dom: but Christ, as a 
Son
 and 
Heir,
 having rule over his own house, gives precepts and commands by his own authority. And he shews them, how they may approve themselves parts and members of this House or Church, 
viz.
 if they hold fast their faith
 in Christ, and their resolute profession thereof, and their hope and expectation of the heavenly reward (which rejoiceth the heart, and supports it under afflictions), and if they persevere in the exercise of those graces with stability and constancy to the end [see 
Col. 1.23]. From Ver. 1, to 7.


3.
 He shews them, that the Holy Ghost, 
Psal. 95.7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
 admo∣nishes such as from time to time should live in the Church, to take heed of rebelling against Christ, and disobeying 
this Prophet,
 during the day or time wherein he speaks to them by his Gospel, lest they lose the 
eternal rest
 of Heaven, as their forefathers lost the temporal 
Canaan
 for not hearkning to 
Moses.
 As if he should have said, If ye will hear Christs voice calling to you in his Gospel, then harden not your hearts in this time and season of grace, wherein he speaks to you, as the 
Israelites
 did in the Wilderness when they tempted and provoked God, and would not believe his power, though they had testimonies enough of it, by the miracles which they saw he had wrought among them for the space of so many years together. Which provocations were

 a grieving (as it were) of his patience; insomuch that he said of them, They were a s
ttish and stubborn people, whose heart was not upright before him: Neither had they seriously minded or consider∣ed
 his miraculous 
Mercies
 or 
Judgments,
 nor set their hearts to know and observe his Commandments, and the ways wherein he would have them to walk: see 
Psal. 119. v. 27, 32, 33, 35.
 Whereupon his 
irre∣versible Oath
 went out against them 
[Numb. 14.23, 24, 28, 29, 30.],
 That they should never come into 
Canaan,
 but leave (every one of them but 
Caleb
 and 
Joshua
) their Carkasses in the Wilderness. The Apostle also fur∣ther admonishes them, to take heed lest they imitate these 
Israelites,
 who by reason of their unbelief were ready, upon every hardship they met with, to destruct God, and to turn back again unto 
Egypt:
 so they should especially take heed, lest there be in any of them an evil and an unbelieving heart, and so should fall away, and depart from Christ, who, according to his Di∣vine Nature, is the ever-living God, who hath life in himself 
originally [Joh. 1.4.
 and 
5.26.]
 and giveth life to others, 
Joh. 11.25. Gal. 2.20. 1 Joh. 5.20.
 And for prevention hereof, they should exhort and encourage one another daily, to persevere in 
faith
 and 
holiness
 (whilst they have time and opportunity to perform that duty, and to establish one another), lest the manifold deceits and baits of sin prevail upon any of them, to harden them. And he enforces his advice with this argument, They will hereby declare themselves to be indeed partakers of Christ, and to be spiritually united to him, if they persevere in that faith wherein they have been formerly in∣structed, and whereof they have made profession. By which faith, and a setled resting on Christ, Christians subsist,
 and are supported in their spiritual life. And he further tells them, That forasmuch as it is said in that fore-cited Psalm, 
To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the day Of provocation,
 &c. they ought to remember, that that 
caveat
 be∣longs to them, as well as to their Ancestors (to whom it was first given); and therefore so long as the opportunity of hearing the voice of Christ sounding in his Gospel continued, they should carefully listen to it, and by no means har∣den their hearts against it. And they should remember, that some of the 
an∣cient Israelites,
 when they had heard and received the Law from Heaven, and had heard God promising blessings to them that obeyed him, and threatning curses to the disobedient, did notwithstanding rebel, and fall off, and mur∣mur against him. But 
Caleb
 and 
Joshua
 did not so, and consequently not 
all
 that by the conduct of 
Moses
 came out of 
Egypt.
 Which thing should be matter of admonition to them, that they should imitate those 
few
 that ad∣hered to God, and not the 
many
 that fell off from him. For 'tis apparent, it was with those disobedient murmurers (that would have gone back to 
E∣gypt
) that God was so highly provoked, and, as it were, wearied md grie∣ved for so many years together; so that not a man of them came into 
Ca∣naan,
 but they all died in the Wilderness. And 'tis apparent, that those con∣cerning whom God sware, 
that they should not enter into his rest,
 were such as disbelieved his Promises, and disobeyed his Precepts, and murmured against his Providence. So that 'tis plain and evident to us, why they were excluded out of 
Canaan,
 namely, Because of their unbelief and disobedience. 
From Ver. 1, to the end.


And seeing those ancient 
Israelites
 could not enter into the 
Rest
 promi∣sed to them, 
viz.
 the Land of 
Canaan,
 because of their unbelief; therefore let us (says he) who are Christian-
Hebrews,
 fear, and be jealous over our selves, lest a promise being made to us in the Gospel of a 
heavenly
 and 
glo∣rious
 
Rest,
 any of us (by neglecting the means which are appointed for the obtaining of it) should seem 
deservedly
 (even in the judgment of men) to miss of it, and to be excluded from it. For the abuse of the like privi∣ledges

 usually procureth the like Judgment. And we that are Christians, says he, have the same priviledges that the 
Israelites
 had, and therefore should fear the like Judgments, if we abuse them. For unto us hath the 
Gospel
 been preached, as well as to them. Nay, we are advanced above them in that priviledg. They had the Gospel 
veiled,
 we have it 
unveiled.
 They had it darkly and obscurely, we have it clearly and plainly. It was 
one
 and the 
same Gospel
 that 
they
 had under the 
Old,
 and 
we
 have under the 
New Testament
 Joh. 
5.46.
 and 
39.
 But the word which they heard preached unto them, did not profit them, because it was not mixed with, or received by faith. But though they, by reason of their unbelief, were excluded out of 
Canaan
 (which was a type of Heaven); yet we, says he, who believe in Christ, do enter into it. We enter into the beginning of that 
Heavenly Rest
 here on earth, by tranquillity of Conscience, and peace with God; and shall en∣ter into the full enjoyment of it hereafter, even as God himself hath spoken, though not in express words, yet by necessary consequence: For whereas He by his Oath
 excludeth unbelievers out of his Rest, he does 
tacitly
 and 
implicitly
 promise, that believers shall enter into it. Now lest any of these 
He∣brews
 should say, We have always enjoyed the Lord's 
Sabbaths,
 and our predecess
rs have long inhabited 
Ca∣naan,
 Why then do you speak so much about entring into 
God's Rest?
 The Apostle shews, that neither of these 
Rests
 could be meant by 
David
, nor intended by himself in this discourse. And 
first
 he shews, that the 
Rest
 meant by God's Oath, 
Psal. 95.11.
 is not the 
Rest of the Seventh day.
 For although the works of God were finished in six days, when he laid the foun∣dation of the world, and (as he himself testifies, 
Gen. 2. v. 3.) He rested on the seventh day from all his works
; yet besides this, there is 
another Rest
 to be entred into, whereof the 
Sabbath
 was but a re∣semblance. And again in that place before quoted, 
Psal. 95.11.
 above three thousand years after that, there is mention made of another 
Rest
 which God promises to 
them that believe and obey him;
 and excludes, by his Oath, 
unbelievers
 and the 
disobedient
 from it. And this plainly appears to be a 
Rest to come;
 so that it cannot be that 
Rest
 which was at the beginning of the world. Therefore the 
first Rest
 is removed; and 'tis evident that there is 
another Rest,
 besides that of the 
Sabbath,
 for believers to enter into. 
2.
 He shews by the 
Rest,
 intended by God's Oath and Promise (which they to whom it is expresly made, shall assuredly partake of) cannot be meant 
Canaan.
 For the 
Israelites
 that came out of 
Egypt
 with 
Moses
 (to whom the Gospel was first preached, before it was preached to them whom 
Joshua
 brought into 
Canaan
) did not enter into 
Canaan
 by reason of their un∣belief. And long after the 
other Israelites
 had entred into 
Canaan,
 the 
Psalmist
 limits or designs a certain day
, saying, 
To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts
 (that is, in this Gospel-day, or time, hear the voice of Christ calling to you in the preaching of his Gospel), and harden not your hearts against his 
Call,
 that so you may enter into his 
Rest.
 And 'tis plain he speaks there of 
another Rest
 yet to be entred into. For if 
that
 had been the 
Rest
 meant by the 
Psalmist
 which 
Joshua
 (in the 
Syriac
 Dialect called 
Jesus
) led the people into, then he would not have spoken of any day or time 
future to that,
 for the entring into it, which yet 'tis ma∣nifest he speaks of in that 
Psalm.
 From all these premisses, he shews, it clearly follows, That there is now for Christians a 
Rest
 still behind, to be enjoyed, besides the typical Rest of the Land of 
Canaan
 (though shadowed

 out by 
that,
 and by the Seventh-day-Sabbath), namely, a 
spiritual, heaven∣ly,
 and 
eternal Rest
 or 
Sabbatism;
 the 
beginning
 of which is in this life, and the 
perfection of it
 in the life to come. Into 
this Rest
 all true 
belie∣vers
 enter, and so here rest from fulfilling the works of the flesh, and shall hereafter fully rest from all their labours and troubles, as God rested from his works. Let us all therefore (says he) look to it, that by a 
stedfast faith
 we enter into 
that Rest,
 lest following the example of our Forefathers disobe∣dience in the Wilderness, we fall, and perish, as they did. And we ought to take the more heed to our selves, because the Gospel which invites men to en∣ter into 
this Rest,
 is 
quick
 and 
powerful
 (through the operation of the Spi∣rit of God), and 
sharper than any two-edged sword
 (cutting which way soever it is turned), and pierces to the 
dividing asunder of soul and spi∣rit,
 that is, the actings of the understanding, and the motions of the will and affections. It 
divides the joints
, that is, cuts asunder the most reso∣lute and compacted purposes of the will. It pierces to the 
marrow,
 the se∣cretest and innermost contrivances and designs of the soul. It reaches the very 
secret thoughts
 and intents of the heart, and tries and judges of them. This 
word
 shews, that nothing is hid from the eyes of God, but all things are to him 
naked,
 and unveiled (so that he sees the outside), and 
opened
 (so that their very inwards are discovered), and made conspicuous in his sight with whom we have to do. And therefore if there be any 
secret unbelief, hypocrisie,
 or 
backsliding-principle
 in any of us, we are to remember that he sees, and takes notice of it. 
From Ver. 1, to 14.


The Apostle comes now to assert the 
Priesthood
 of Christ, and from thence he encourages the 
believing-Hebrews
 to 
perseverance
 and 
stedfastness
 in the profession of the faith. And 
(1.)
 he shews, That seeing we have a great 
High-Priest,
 whose word is lively and mighty in operation, and before whose eyes all things are naked, and who hath passed through these visible Hea∣vens, and gloriously ascended unto the right hand of the Father in the highest Heaven; therefore they should be sure to hold fast their profession of faith in Him. And this their 
High-Priest,
 he tells them, is a merciful and compas∣sionate High-Priest, who having sometimes felt those infirmities in his flesh which we feel, and been exercis'd with such temptations as we are liable to (yet so as they never drew him to sin), we have good cause to believe, that he will be merciful to us, and ready to relieve us when we are tempted. Therefore let us come boldly, in the name of this our High-Priest, to the Throne of Grace, for the obtaining all seasonable grace and assistance that we need in our passage towards Heaven. 
From Ver. 14, to the end.


The Apostle goes on to set forth the excellency of Christ's 
Priestly Office,
 shewing him to be more excellent than any 
typical Priest,
 in all Priestly re∣quisites, yea than 
Aaron
 himself; therefore the believing-Hebrews had rea∣son to moderate their thoughts touching the 
Levitical Priesthood,
 which they were apt too highly to esteem, to the prejudice of Christ. And in the first place he considers the chief things observable in the Aaronical High-Priest, and applies them unto Christ. First, The 
Aaronical High-Priest
 being taken from among men, and severed and set apart from the common multitude, was appointed to act and negotiate for the good of men, in the things wherein they have to do with God; particularly, to offer 
gifts, oblations,
 and 
sacri∣fices
 for their sins. 
2.
 He was to execute this his Office with pity and compassion
 to the ignorant, and those that are out of the way, being him∣self compassed with infirmities. 
3.
 He was to offer for his own sins as well as for the people's. 
4.
 He must be called of God, as was 
Aaron.
 No man could legally
 assume this honour to himself, but he that was of 
Aaron
's line, and so called to it by God, who assign'd that high dignity to that line

 only. Now the Apostle shews, that all these may well be applied to Christ. And first, he instances in the 
last
 of them, That Christ did not intrude him∣self upon this Office, nor assumed the honour and glory of it to himself, but the Father glorified him by ordaining him thereunto. And this he proves from two places in the 
Psalms: 1.
 Out of 
Psal. 2,
 where God the Father says to him, 
Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee;
 that is, in this day of thy resurrection I have bestowed this special dignity upon thee, to be a 
King
 and 
High-Priest;
 and thou shalt ascend into Heaven, as the High-Priest did into the Holy of Holies; and then he commands him, 
to ask of him the ends of the earth,
 or to intercede for the salvation of many, which is a special part of his Priestly Function. His second proof is out of 
Psal. 110,
 where God's deputing Christ to that Function is declared. For 'tis God the Father that saith, 
Thou art such a Priest as Melchisedec
 was; that is, a 
King
 and 
Priest together;
 and thy Priesthood shall never cease, or be suc∣ceeded by any, till this 
Mediatory
 Kingdom of thine shall be delivered up to me, See 
2 Cor. 15.24.
 The Apostle having thus proved that Christ was called to be a 
Priest,
 he proceeds to shew, that the other things which belonged to the High-Priest, belonged unto him. For, 
2.
 He was a Son of man, of the same nature and
 mould with us. 
3.
 He offered a sacrifice for the sins of the people (but not for his own, for he had none), and that sacrifice was, 
Himself on the Cross. 4.
 He was a merciful High-Priest, having had experience of our miseries. For in the state of his humiliation, when he was here in the flesh
, in his agony in the Garden, and on the Cross, feeling the weight of God's wrath lying on him for our sins, he offered up 
ardent prayers
 and 
sup∣plications,
 with strong cryes and tears unto his Father, who, he knew, was able to save him from death, or could support him in suffering of it, and restore him from it; not permitting him to lye under the power of it, or to be swallowed up by it. And he was so heard, that he was delivered from that which he feared
. And though he were the 
beloved Son of God,
 and so more excellent than any High-Priest, yea, than any Creature; yet by his grievous sufferings he was inured to submit to his Father's will; and experimentally knew what 
Obedience
 meant, and how hard a lesson 
Patience
 under the Cross is (which is the highest and chiefest point of a Christian's obedience); and thereby he became more fit to compassionate us. Yet it is not to be won∣dred at, that so excellent a Person, and so dear to God, should suffer as he did: for by his sufferings he was made a full and perfect Redeemer 
Heb. 7.26.],
 so that nothing more need be added unto what he has done and suffered for the redemption of man. And ha∣ving paid the full price of our redemption, he became the author of eternal salvation to all
 (of what rank or degree soever they be) that obey him, by believing in him, and exercising the other graces and parts of obedience which he requires. So that from the whole discourse he infers, that Christ must needs be a 
Priest
 of a more 
excellent Order
 than was 
Aaron
's (which was an exspiring Order, and not to last for ever), and that he was called and openly declared of God, 
viz.
 in that 
110 Psalm,
 to be an 
High-Priest
 after the order of 
Melchizedec. From Ver. 1, to 11.


The Apostle now intending to speak more largely of this great Mystery, he thinks fit to preface something, 
(1.)
 By way of 
Reprehension,
 from 
v. 11
 of this Chapter, to the end. 
(2.)
 By way of 
Exhortation, ch. 6.
 from 
v. 1,


 to 
4. (3.)
 By way of 
Commination,
 from 
v. 4,
 to 
9. (4.)
 By way of 
Con∣solation,
 from 
v. 9,
 to the end. And first, He tells them, He had many things to write concerning this Mystery; but if he should speak of them, many
 among them would hardly understand them by reason of their great dulness and carelesness; which was so gross, that when in respect of the time wherein they had enjoyed the Gospel, they might have been able to teach others (as particularly their own Families); they, by returning to an observation of the 
Mosaical
 Ceremonies, and holding the observation of them necessary to salvation (as it seems many of them did), shewed themselves to stand in need to be instructed in the very 
first principles
 of the Gospel, in which the greatest and most necessary Oracles of God are contained. So that instead of making progress in Christianity, they were gone backward, and at present shewed themselves like Babes, who needed milk, and not strong meat, see 
1 Cor. 3.1, 2.
 For as he, that is got∣ten no higher than Milk
, will be hurt, and not fed, by having more solid food given him; so those a∣mong them that stuck in the observation of the typical Ceremonies [those weak and beggarly Elements, 
Gal. 4.3, 9. Col. 2.8, 20
], and judged the observation of them necessary under the Gospel, shewed themselves to be very ignorant of the 
word of Righteousness,
 or doctrine of salvation by faith in Christ, and to be in∣deed very Babes. But the stronger
 Christians among them, who by long use, and a diligent hearing, read∣ing, and meditating on the word, have their judg∣ments and understandings exercis'd to discern between 
true
 and 
false
 Do∣ctrine, between 
good
 and 
evil;
 they can rellish sublimer mysteries, and feed on them as on stronger meats. 
From Ver. 11, to the end.


The Apostle having thus reprehended their dulness and improficiency, he now comes to exhort them and stir them up to advance to a higher and per∣fecter degree of knowledg in the Christian Religion,
 than the first principles or ground-work. For as the foundation of a house being once laid, we must not stay there, but proceed in raising up the building; so 'tis absurd to ad∣vance no further in the Christian Religion than the knowledg of the first principles of the Catechism; such as are, 
1. Repentance,
 or turning from sinful works, whereof the end is death. 
2. Faith in God,
 namely, in God the 
Father, Son,
 and 
Holy Ghost. 3.
 The 
Doctrine of Baptisms,
 that is, the Doctrine usually taught at their 
Baptizings,
 whereby the people were in∣formed of the difference betwixt the 
outward
 Baptism by the Minister, and the 
inward
 Baptism by the Spirit; and possibly, concerning the nature and use, not only of this Sacrament, but of the other also; 
Baptism
 being here 
synecdochically
 put for both Sacraments. 
4.
 Tou∣ching the 
rite of laying on of hands
 
upon Mi∣nisters in their Ordination,
 or 
Confirming
 such as having been baptized in their infancy, and after∣wards well instructed in the Principles of Christianity, were to make profession of their Faith, and own their Baptismal Covenant, before they were admitted to the Lord's Table. 
5.
 Of the 
Resurrection of the dead,
 and of the 
last Judgment,
 which will doom and decree to men

 
everlasting rewards
 and 
punishments.
 Now that they may not stick in these 
first Principles,
 he tells them, he desires to contribute his endeavour to carry them on to a more perfect degree and measure of knowledg in the mysteries of the Gospel; and hopes he shall (through the Lord's permission and assistance) be enabled to do it
. And accordingly in the following Chapters he opens deeper mysteries, from 
v. 1,
 to 
4. (3.)
 He comes now to shew them the great danger of apostatizing from Christ and his Doctrine, representing unto them, That if any have advanced so far, that they have been enlightned, and have
 tasted of the heavenly gift (by the knowledg of Christ and his benefits, and the heavenly things revealed in his Gospel) and h
ve had some of the extraordinary (though common) 
gifts
 of the Spirit of God poured out upon them (though not of his renewing-graces), and have tasted the 
good word of God,
 that is, have heard the Doctrine of the Gospel, and the glad tydings thereof, with 
some kind of joy
 [Mat. 
13.20, 21.
]; and lastly, have had some tast and apprehension of the glorious priviledges
 of the Saints, by some weak glances upon the glory of Heaven; and after all this, shall fall away, making a 
total, voluntary,
 and 
malicious apo∣stacy
 and 
defection
 from Christ and his Gospel; he shew, 'tis impossible to 
renew them again unto repentance,
 that is, to 
renew them so,
 that they shall repent; because God hath decreed never to give repent∣ance to such persons. F
r they having wilfully cast off God, God casts off them. And there being no renewing but 
in
 and 
through
 the Mediation of Jesus Christ, these Apostates barr themselves from that; For by their apostacy from Christ, they do in effect declare, That he was an Impostor, and deserved to be crucified
, and all the other indignities that were put upon him. Ano∣ther sacrifice therefore must be offered up, if 
such
 be redeemed. The Apostle also further sets out the woful estate of 
Apostates,
 and the equity of God's proceeding against them, by an elegant comparison. As the 
fertile ground
 (saith he), which, drinking in the rain that comes often upon it, brings forth a plentiful encrease, to the joy and comfort of the Husbandman, does thereby testifie that it is blessed of God [see 
Gen. 27.27.
]; but the 
barren earth
 (which after tillage and irrigation bears nothing but thorns and briars) is given over abandoned and disregarded by the 
Owner;
 and if it so continue, may expect ere long to be cursed by him (as the fruitless fig-tree was. 
Mat. 21.19.
), and finally doom'd fit for nothing but to be burnt and destroyed, like the Land of 
Sodom.
 So they who after illumination and the means of grace afforded to them, do advance in Christianity, in Faith and Holiness, and go on towards perfection, do thereby declare themselves to be blessed of God; but such as do not make a right use of the means and helps God af∣fords them; but instead of making progress in Christianity, do fall off from Christ and their Christian Profession, they shew themselves to be in a cursed and miserable condition.


But he tells them, That though he said thus much to them by way of 
caution,
 yet he was perswaded better things of the greatest part of them, than to think they would thus fall away. He accounted them his beloved brethren, and really believed the estate of most of them to be such, as would be so far from bringing a curse upon them, that it would in the end bring them to eternal salvation
. And the ground of this his 
hope
 and perswasion,
 was

 their 
good work of faith,
 whereby they testified a couragious profession of the Gospel, and that 
excellent Charity
 which they manifested by their 
past
 and 
present
 care, pains, and industry, to relieve and supply the Saints
 that were in want; which tended so much to the 
glory of God,
 and 
the praise of his Name.
 And this, he tells them, God will not forget to reward, who is righteous and faithful in his promises. But, says he, though I conceive well of many of you for the present, yet I would not hereupon have you to wax 
secure,
 but to use all due care and diligence, even to the end of your life, for the 
consummation
 of your hope, and the heightning it to a full 
assurance
 of attaining the salvation which I am perswaded is pre∣pared for you. You must not therefore grow sloathful nor sluggish, but imitate and follow 
their example,
 who continuing in the exercise of 
faith
 and 
pa∣tience,
 did at last come to enjoy their part in the pro∣mised
 eternal Inheritance. Now among those Ex∣amples of Faith and Patience, he particularly instances in 
Abraham,
 who was the 
Father of the faithful;
 to whom God made a promise, 
In blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed;
 and confirmed it by an 
Oath,
 swearing by 
Himself,
 there being none greater to swear by. And 
Abraham,
 after he had long patiently expecetd the completion of it, saw the beginning and ground-work thereof, when 
Isaac
 was born to him of 
Sarah,
 which was a pawn and pledg to him of the accomplishment of the rest; and he lived to see 
Isaac
 have two s
ns, 
Esau
 and 
Jacob.
 Now by that promise made to 
Abraham
 of 
blessing
 
 
multiplying him,
 was meant the 
bringing his seed into Canaan,
 and 
all 
 believers
 to the 
Rest
 signified thereby. Moreover, from the use of an 
Oath
 among men (which is to assure and as∣certain the thing sworn, and to take away all doubt about the thing contro∣verted, it being made by God, who is appeal'd to as Judg and Avenger) the Apostle inferrs a reason why God confirm'd his Promise by an 
Oath
, viz. His superbundant goodness and willingness to declare unto the 
heirs of pro∣mise
 [that is, the children of 
Abraham
 after the 
spirit, Gal. 3.19.
] the 
immutability
 of his Counsel, that what he had purposed, determined, and pro∣mised to 
Abraham
 and his seed, should assuredly be accomplished. And it was for 
man's sake,
 and 
man's good,
 that God thus bound hims
lf by oath, 
viz.
 To quiet and settle his mind in his Promise, that he might believe it with∣out wavering. For the 
Promise
 of God, and his 
Oath,
 are two immutable things (wherein 'tis impossible God should fail) and may afford strong con∣solation to th
se who under the sense and guilt of sin, flye to it (as to a City of Refuge) and depend on it for the attaining eternal life and bliss
, which this Promise presents unto them, and gives them ground to hope for; which 
Hope
 believers have as a sure 
anchor
 cast within Heaven it self (figured by the Holy of Holies within the Veil), staying their souls from being tossed in the tempestuous sea of this world, and fixing their hearts upon the 
Om∣nipotency, Truth,
 and 
Faithfulness
 of God, and 
merit of Christ,
 who is en∣tred into Heaven for us (prefigured by the High-Priest's entring within the Veil) as our 
Forerunner
 or 
Harbinger,
 there to prepare a place for us, and to intercede for us, being appointed by his Father an High-Priest for ever after the Order
 of 
Melchisedec. From Ver. 1, to the end.




The Apostle now returns to the 
Priesthood
 of Christ again,
 from which he had digressed from 
v. 11
 of 
ch. 5,
 to this 
Chapter;
 and shews, that Christ was a Priest of a much higher Order than the 
Aaronical
 Priests were, as may appear by considering the nature of the Priesthood of 
Melchizedec
, after the manner of which, Christ's Priesthood was. For this 
Melchizedec,
 in his 
Name
 [King of Righteousness], and in his 
Title
 [King of 
Salem
 or Peace] was a 
Type
 of Christ; and be∣ing stiled, 
Gen. 14.18, a Priest of the Most High God,
 it appears he was both 
King
 and 
Priest.
 And accordingly when 
Abraham
 returned from his victory over 
Kederlaomer,
 and the other neighbouring 
Reguli
 or Kings, he came out and treated him and his Army royally, like a 
King, bringing forth bread and wine
 for them; and as a 
Priest
 blessed him, and received from him the tenth of 
all he had there.
 He further shews, how this 
Melchizedec
 (that he might more clearly represent Christ) stands in the History recorded of him in 
Genesis,
 as a 
Priest;
 of whose Father, and Mother, and Pedigree, there is no mention; neither of his birth or death, or that he had any successor in his Priest∣hood
. In all which particulars he was a 
type
 of Christ (and so represented 
Psal. 110
) who is such a Priest as he, in respect of the conjunction of the 
Regal
 Office, and 
Sacerdotal;
 in respect of his being King of Righ∣teousness, and Prince of Peace; in respect of his being without Father, 
as He is Man;
 and without Mother, 
as he is God;
 and so He is without descent and genealogy; without be∣ginning of days, or end of life; and continueth for ever in that Office, that is, so long as there shall be any need of his mediation. So that 
Melchizedec,
 though he were a true 
Man,
 yet in his singular Prerogatives he was made like unto the 
Son of God;
 and was so set forth, as to hear a resemblance of Him, being appointed by God a visible Type of Him before He was exhibited in the flesh.


The Apostle having set forth 
Melchizedec
's excellency in himself, proceed∣eth to amplifie the same in reference to others. And first, sheweth how he ought to be preferred before 
Abraham,
 and before all the 
Levites
 that de∣scended from 
Abraham.
 For that act of 
Abraham
's in giving a 
tenth
 to 
Melchizedec,
 implieth an inferiority in himself who paid them, and a supe∣riority in him that received them; because the 
Tenth
 was an holy tribute due to God, and so it was paid by 
Abraham,
 who paid it to 
Melchizedec
 as to God's Priest, standing in God's room, and in that respect greater than himself. 'Tis true, he shews that the Levitical Priests had commission by the Law to receive Tythes of all Jews that defended from 
Abraham,
 and there∣in were counted greater than their Brethren. But 
Melchizedec,
 who was no kin to 
Abraham
 (nor of that people), but a stranger to him, received Tythes, not from the Progeny of 
Abraham,
 but from 
Abraham
 himself; which is a greater dignity than to receive them only from his own people. 
2.
 The Apo∣stle shews, that to bless 
authoritatively,
 is an act of superiority; now 
Mel∣chizedec
 blessed 
Abraham,
 who was so special a 
Favourite
 of God, and re∣ceived such excellent promises from him, and had them so often repeated to him. And certainly, he that 
blesseth one authoritatively,
 is greater than 
he
 whom he blesseth. Therefore Christ (whose Type and Shadow 
Melchize∣dec
 was) is much more excellent than 
Abraham,
 and than all the Leviti∣cal Priests which sprang from him. Further, to prove the excellency of 
Mel∣chizedec
's Priesthood above the 
Levites,
 he tells them, in 
v. 8,
 That 
here,
 that is, in the 
Levitical
 Priesthood, though those Priests be superior to the

 people, yet they dye as well as the people do; but 
there,
 that is, in that place of 
Genesis
 where 
Melchizedec
 is spoken of, there is no mention made of his 
death;
 which the Holy Ghost seems purposely to have omitted, that he might thereby witness, that he typically prefigured Christ, who doth indeed and properly 
live for ever
; and so he implicitely testifies, not only the everlastingness of Christ's Person, but of his Priesthood also. He further shews, that the 
Levites
 paid Tythes to 
Melchizedec
 in 
Abraham,
 being in his loins when 
Melchizedec
 met him; therefore he is greater than they; and Christ as to his Person, being typified by 
Melchizedec,
 must needs be more excellent than they also. 
From Ver. 1, to 11.


Hitherto the Apostle hath set forth the excellency of Christ's Priesthood, by sh
wing how 
Melchizedec
 was a type of Him; and that all the Excel∣lencies, typically held forth in 
Melchizedec,
 were really and properly found in Him. And therefore his Priesthood far excelleth 
Aaron
's, which several of the 
Jews
 had in so high esteem; and so much rested on it, that they little regarded Christ's. This he proves by several particulars. 
1.
 If a perfect
 expiation of sin, and furnishing men with all they have need of to eternal life, could have been had by the 
Levitical
 Priesthood (for unto that only the people were by the Ceremonial Law bound), there would then have been no need (as it appears there was by 
David
's prophecy, 
Psal. 110.4.
) that God should institute a Priest of another and more excellent Order, to wit, his own Son, to be such a Priest as 
Mel∣chizedec
 was, and not such an one as 
Aaron.
 And the change of the 
Le∣vitical Priesthood
 necessarily draweth along with it a change of the 
Levi∣tical Law,
 and the legal dispensation of the Covenant of Grace; that under another Priesthood, 
another Law,
 and another dispensation of 
that Covenant,
 may succeed. Therefore the changeable Levitical Priesthood is not so excel∣lent as the unchangeable Melchizedechian Priesthood of Christ. Now that the Priesthood was changed, he evidenceth by the translation of it to another tribe: Christ our High-Priest (of whom these things are said) springing from the Tribe of 
Judah;
 whereas God had restrained the Priesthood under the Law, to the Tribe of 
Levi:
 For by 
Moses
's speaking nothing that the Priesthood should be executed by any other Tribe, it appears that it was not God's mind that any that were of any other Tribe should be of the Priesthood, or attend upon the Altar. 
From Ver. 11, to the 15.


2.
 He gives a further proof of the change of the Priesthood, from the dif∣ferent manner of Consecration
. For Christ our High-Priest (who is raised up after the similitude of 
Melchizedec
) was not made a Priest with such 
carnal rites
 and outward solemnities as the Law prescribed to be used at the Consecration of 
Aaron
 and his sons in their several successions; but he was made a Priest 
with the power of endless life,
 consecrated a Priest that should ever continue, and ever live to make intercession for us, and apply unto us the vertue 
f his sacrifice, for the bringing us to everlasting life, according as the 
Psalmist
 testifies in the fore-cited 
Psalm,
 where God the Father saith to his Son, 
Thou art a Priest for ever after the Order of Melchizedec. From Ver. 15, to 18.




3.
 He shews a reason why the 
Legal Covenant,
 with the Ceremonial Precepts, and Levitical Priesthood belonging thereto, was changed, because of the 
weakness
 and 
unprofitableness
 of it (in it self considered) for the ex∣piation of sin; therefore there was a necessity to introduce the Eternal Priest∣hood of Christ. For the 
Legal Covenant
 could not by it self, or by the strict observance of the Rites thereof, make the observers
 thereof perfect. Nothing could be hoped for from 
that
 (considered in it self
), but legal purifications, and outward priviledges. It could not, of it self, cleanse from sin, reconcile us to God, justifie our persons, sanctifie our natures, and ever∣lastingly save us; and therefore to pacifie God, or purchase salvation (as the mis-believing Jews used it) it was 
weak
 and 
unprofitable.
 But the Priesthood of Christ (that 
better thing
 hoped-for) being introduced, that hath efficacy, power, and vertue, to do all those things for us; and by it we have freedom of access to God. 
From Ver. 18, to 20.


4.
 He shews, that the 
Levitical
 Priests were made without an 
Oath,
 by a Law changeable at the will of the Lawgiver, God reserving to himself li∣berty to change it when he pleased: but Christ (as appears from 
Psal. 110.4.
) was made a Priest by an 
Oath;
 where the 
Psalmist
 intimates, that there should be an end of the 
Aaronical
 Priesthood, but there should be no end of Christ's; for God hath confirmed it by an Oath, and will not change or re∣tract what he hath sworn. And as far as a Priest established by an 
Oath
 to continue for ever in that Office, is superiour to a Priest made by a change∣able Commandment, so much is the 
New Cove∣nant
, or new dispensation of the Covenant of Grace (whereof Christ is Surety and Mediator), better than the 
Old Covenant
 (or the old Dispensation of that Co∣venant), which was under the 
Levitical
 Priesthood; For though 
this
 (in substance) is the same with the former; yet as to the manner of its dispensation, 'tis more 
clear,
 more 
free,
 more 
full,
 more surely 
ratified (viz.
 by the death of Christ), and accompanied with a more mighty operation of the Spirit, and is of larg
r extent. 
From Ver. 20, to 23.


5.
 The 
Levitical
 Priests were 
many,
 and 
mortal,
 and by reason of death were forced to leave their Office to others; but Christ is but 
one,
 and immor∣tal, and ever
 continueth, and hath no Partner or Successor, but executes an everlasting, unchangeable Priesthood, which passeth not to any other; and con∣sequently, he is able to 
save to the uttermost
 all that seek unto God for salvation, through faith in him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for all true 
penitent believers,
 manifesting his will and desire that 
such
 should partake of the vertue and benefit of his Sacrifice. 
From Ver. 23, to 26.


6.
 He shews how much Christ is to be preferred before those 
Levitical
 Priests, both in respect of 
purity
 and 
dignity.
 His 
perfect purity,
 he tells them, appears in this, That he is (as 'twas fit and necessary he should be in respect of procuring our pardon) 
holy, harmless, undefiled,
 and 
separated from all possibility of being of the number of sinners.
 His 
high
 and 
supereminent dignity
 in this, that he is exalted, and advanced above all Creatures, and raised up above all the visible Heavens, to the right hand of his Father. And further, he is such an High-Priest as needs not offer sacri∣fice, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people, as the 
Aaro∣nical
 High-Priests often us'd to do, especially upon all appointed days; for he had no sins of his own to offer for. And he offered no Cattel or bruit Beast,

 but 
Himself,
 in sacrifice, and that but 
once,
 upon the Cross; which 
once-offered-Sacrifice
 was abundantly sufficient for the expiation of sin. Moreover, the 
Levitical
 Law appoints men to be High-Priests that laboured with infir∣mities, and were sinners, and subject to mortality; but the promise made to Christ (and confirmed by God's Oath, and declared by 
David, Psal. 110,
 some hundreds of years after the Law was given) maketh the 
Son,
 and none but the 
Son
 (who is perfectly holy, and consecrated to this everlasting Office) a 
Priest for evermore.
 From 
Ver. 26, to the end.


The Apostle having proved the excellency of Christ's Priesthood in the for∣mer Chapter, he now proceeds to shew his 
faithful execution thereof,
 for the good and salvation of his Church, from the beginning of this Chapter to the 
19 v.
 of 
ch. 10.
 In this Chapter he proves, That 
His Ministry
 is far to be preferr'd be∣fore the 
Levitical,
 by four Arguments. 
1.
 From the 
Magnificence
 of it, 
v. 1. 2.
 From the 
Place
 where he ministers, 
viz.
 Heaven, 
v. 2. 3.
 From the 
Sa∣crifice
 which he presents, 
viz.
 his 
Body
 and 
Humanity
 wherein he suffered, 
v. 3, 4, 5. 4.
 From the 
Covenant
 whereof he is Mediator, from 
v. 5,
 to the end.


In the first place, to excite their attention, he tells them, That this is the 
sum
 of the things he had before spoken concerning Christ's Priesthood, 
viz. 1.
 That the 
High-Priest,
 who intercedes for us Christians, is one that is en∣tred into Heaven, and there sits at the right hand of God, and hath all power given unto him both in heaven and earth. 
2.
 He is a Mini∣ster of the 
Sanctuary of Heaven
. And, 
3.
 There he presents his own body, or humanity, wherein he suffered (figured also by the typical Tabernacle), which the Holy Ghost miraculously formed and prepared for him in the womb of the Virgin; and by the efficacy of his passion still maketh intercession for us. But the 
Levitical Priests
 are only Ministers of the typical Tabernacle, which was made by the art and hands of man, 
Exod. 36.1.
 For every 
High-Priest
 must, according to his Office, have some gifts and sacrifices to offer; and so must Christ also: and he had no other to present in heaven but his own sa∣crific'd body. And that he doth exercise his Priesthood in Heaven, 'tis evi∣dent. For having on earth offered up himself a Sacrifice, if he should not have ascended into Heaven (the Sanctuary above) he should not have per∣formed all that belonged to his Office. Besides, if he had executed his Office only here on the earth, he could not properly be reckoned for a Priest, seeing He neither was of the 
Tribe of Levi,
 neither did, nor would offer such 
ty∣pical, figurative
 Sacrifices as the Priests (appointed by the Law) did offer; whose Ministry was only about 
types
 and 
shadows
 of heavenly things; the 
Tabernacle,
 and all things pertaining thereunto (framed and ordered by 
Mo∣ses
 according to the pattern shewed him in the Mount, 
(Exod. 25.40.)
 be∣ing only Representations of them.
 From 
v. 1,
 to 
6. 4.
 He proves the excel∣lency of Christ's Priesthood above the 
Levitical,
 from the excellency of the 
New Covenant,
 or new dispensation of the Covenant of Grace (whereof he is the Mediator) above the 
old.
 For this 
Covenant
 is established upon 
bet∣ter Promises, viz.
 more 
spiritual,
 more 
clear,
 more 
extensive,
 and more 
uni∣versal:
 whereas the 
other
 was more 
carnal
 and 
earthly,
 more 
obscure,
 and more 
restrained
 to that one Nation of the 
Jews.
 And if the 
former Co∣venant,
 under the 
Levitical
 Priesthood, had been so perfect
, that there had been nothing wanting to it, and that it could not have been improved

 and bettered; there would have been no need of a 
se∣cond
 
Covenant,
 or new Dispensation. But it ap∣pears it was not so: Because, when God speaks by the Prophet 
Jeremy
 (ch. 
31.
 v. 
31.
), of making a 
New Covenant,
 he doth it by way of complaint or finding fault with the 
weakness
 and 
imperfection
 of the 
for∣mer
 [see 
Heb. 7.18.
], saying unto them, The Co∣venant which I will now make with all true 
Israelites,
 is not after the rate of the Covenant which I made with the 
Israelites
 by 
Moses,
 when I brought them out of 
Egypt;
 a Covenant made up of external, carnal Commandments, the scope and drift of which the peo∣ple did not well discern; a Covenant that had the ex∣ternal form of a Legal Covenant, and an express Con∣dition of full obedience to be performed to all my Com∣mands; which Covenant they brake, so that I regard∣ed
 them not. But this is the Covenant I will make in the later dayes, or times of the Gospel; 
1.
 I will put my Laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts, that is, will illuminate their minds and understandings with the knowledg of my will and frame their hearts to yield obedience thereto, and so 
I will be their God
 to protect and defend them, and provide all good things necessary for them, either for this life, or that which is to come; and 
they shall be my people,
 to depend on me by a lively faith, and to worship me aright, and live in obedience unto me. 
2.
 They shall have a 
more plentiful knowledg
 than was in the time of the Law. There shall not now be so many 
significant Ceremonies,
 as were in the time of the Law, the meaning whereof one shall teach another. For the Holy Ghost shall now be poured forth in so plentiful a measure, and the light of the Gospel shall now shine so brightly to all estates and conditions of men (even the meanest as well as the greatest), that the teaching of Friends and Neighbours (as 'twas us'd of old) shall be in a manner superflu∣ous
. They shall not need in such a manner and sort as formerly, to instruct one another in the meaning of the types, and shadows, and observances required of them by the Law of 
Moses;
 which instruction was then necessary, that they might know the true God aright, and worship him according to his own Prescriptions. Neither shall they teach one another 
so darkly, so slenderly,
 and 
so imperfectly,
 under the New Testament, as they did under the Old; nor shall they need to take so much pains about teaching the knowledg of God, as they had been constrained to take in the teaching of the 
Gentiles
 in former times. For now a greater measure of light
 and knowledg should abound, and all estates and conditions of people should so clearly un∣derstand the things of God, and the mysteries of sal∣vation (God so effectually teaching and enlightning them in the use of his own Gospel-Institutions: see 
Jer. 31.34. Isa. 54.13.
), that they should seem rather to be taught by some immediate irradiation from God, than by any ordinary means of instruction. 
3. I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and iniquities I will remember no more;
 that is, I will be merciful to their persons in pardoning and removing their sins. Lastly, The Apostle from the Prophet's words inferrs a twofold consectary, or consequence. 
1.
 From the 
Name
 the Lord gives 
this Covenant,
 calling it 
new,
 he inferrs the 
other
 to be 
old. 2.
 He shews, that 
that
 which waxeth old (and is by God's ap∣pointment

 to be disannulled) cannot long stand, but is near vanishing
 away. 
From Ver. 6, to the end.


The Apostle roes on to set forth how Christ executes his Office, by compa∣ring him with the 
Legal Priests
 in the executing of theirs. And, 
1.
 He shews the Peiests 
manner
 of executing their Office, to 
v. 11.
 And then Christ's 
manner
 of executing his, from 
v. 11
 of this 
chap.
 to 
v. 19
 of 
ch.
 the 
10th.


1.
 He shews, the 
first Covenant
 (or first Administration of the Covenant of Grace) had an outward Legal Service, and Rites and Ordinances
 of Divine Worship, and a 
Worldly Sanctuary,
 frail and brittle, as made by the hands of men, of earthly Materials, and which was only a 
type
 and representation of the 
Heavenly Sanctuary
 above. And being to speak of the Ordinances and Services of Divine Worship that were performed in the Tabernacle, he first speaks of the 
Tabernacle
 it self, which had 
two parts
. In the 
first
 of which, 
viz.
 the Sanctuary or Holy-place, was, 
1.
 The 
Golden Can∣dlestick
 [Exod. 
25.31.
], a 
type
 of the 
Church of Christ;
 the Shaft that sustained the branches (whereon stood the Lamps), being a figure of Christ, who sustaineth those Lights that be in the Church. 
2.
 The 
Table
 whereon stood the 
Shew-bread
, Exod. 
25.23, 30,
 typifying the Saints 
communion
 with Christ [see 
Luke 22.30.
]; which part of the Taber∣nacle had a veil which covered the entrance thereinto, called the 
first veil
, 
Exod. 26.36,
 whereby it was severed from the Courts appertaining thereunto. In the 
second part
 of the Tabernacle, he shews, was the 
Holy of Holies,
 being divided from the Sanctuary by 
ano∣ther veil
 made of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twi∣ned linnen, 
Exod. 26.31,
 whereunto belonged, 
1.
 A 
Golden
 
Conser,
 Levit. 
16.12, 13,
 which the High-Priest filled with burning-coals taken from the Altar of Burnt-offering that stood in the Court
 (where the continual fire was), and made it f
nd forth a sweet savour of the incense put upon it; that so a Cloud arising from it, might cover the 
Mercy-seat. 2. The Ark of the Covenant
 overlaid with Gold, 
Exod. 25.10,
 in which the 
Tables of the Covenant
 were kept, 
Exod. 34.1, 28. Deut. 10.1, 2.
 They are called the 
Tables of the Covenant
, because the 
Ten Com∣mandments
 engraven upon them by the finger of God, contained a testimony of the 
Covenant
 which God made with his people, and testified what it was that God re∣quired of them. In which part of the Tabernacle was also the
 
Golden Pot of Manna
, and 
Aaron's

 Rod
 that budded, 
Numb. 17.1, 2,
 and over the Ark, the 
Cherubims of glory shadowing the Mercy-seat,
 Exod. 
25.17, &c.
 from whence God ma∣nifested his presence, and was wont to speak with 
Moses,
 and to give him an∣swers, and to shew himself propitious to the people. But concerning 
these,
 he tells them, he intended not to enlarge, because he hasted to the services performed in these places. And he shews them, that when the Tabernacle was thus made, and the parts thereof fitly distinguished, and all the Sacred Ʋtensils set in their due places, the Priests went into the first and outward part of the Tabernacle, and performed the daily service according to the Law. But into the 
inner part,
 or 
Holy of Holies,
 none en∣tred but the 
High-Priest
 [Lev. 
16.2, 17.
], and 
he
 only one day in a year, 
viz.
 on the 
Fast,
 or great day of Expiation, 
Lev. 16.29;
 and then always he car∣ried with him the blood of a 
Bullock
 in a Bas
n, which was a 
sin-offering
 for himself; and the blood of a 
Goat,
 which was a 
sin-offering
 for the people
; and he was to sprinkle the one and the other blood 
upon
 and 
before
 the Mercy-seat; thereby signifying, that there is no atonement with God, nor expiation of sin, but by the blood of Christ. He further shews, that the Holy Ghost (who was the institutor of all th
se Rites and Ordinances, and therefore 
one true eternal God with the Father and the Son, and yet a distinct Person
), signified this thereby, that the 
true, right, proper
 means of entring into Heaven (the true 
Holy of Holies
) was not so fully and clearly manifested, as long as the Church under the Old Testament was instructed only by these Ceremonies and Rites of the first Tabernacle. For the 
first Tabernacle
 was but a figure or typical representation of good things to come, serving only for that present time of the Churches non-age; and the 
Gifts
 and 
Sacrifices
 then offered, could not of themselves 
perfectly justifie, sanctifie,
 or 
save
 any man; nor could they of themselves pacifie or quiet the Consci∣ence
, nor satisfie it, that God's Justice was satis∣fied, and sin forgiven for any worthiness in them. The faithful therefore under the Old Testament, were not perfected (as pertaining to the Conscience) by the legal rites they performed, but by the Evangelical and Cele∣stial Truths, which those Rites typified; and so they were perfected as we Christians now are, though not so clearly and mani∣festly. And the Apostle shews a reason why those legal rites could not make perfect; namely, Because the nature of them was such, that they reached only to the 
outward man,
 they consisting, for the most part, in meats and drinks, and divers washings and ordinances that concern the flesh or body of man, which did not (separate from their signification, as many 
Jews
 took them) commend any man to God 
[1 Cor. 8.8.],
 and were impos'd upon them as a 
yoke [Acts 15.19.],
 until the times of the New Testament should come, in which these Ceremonies should be removed, and other more spiritual Institu∣tions introduced
, wherein the Holy Ghost would work more powerfully. 
From Ver. 1, to 11.


The Apostle having thus shewed how the 
Levitical Priests
 executed 
their
 Office, he comes now to sh
w how 
Christ
 executed 
His.
 He shews, that Christ being now actually exhibited, after a long expectation of him, and ha∣ving entred on his Priesthood (to procure for us all those blessings which were promised and figured in the Old Testament), he executeth his Office in a

 greater and more perfect Tabernacle than that which was made with hands, 
viz.
 the Tabernacle of his 
own body
 (form'd in the womb of the Virgin by the Holy Ghost, after an especial manner, without any spot of original sin; in which Tabernacle the 
fulness of the Godhead dwells.
 And he differs from the Legal 
High-Priest
 in this; The Legal High-Priest entred into the 
typical Holy of Holies
 with the blood of Goats and Calves, only once a year. But 
Christ
 entred into Heaven with his own blood
 (presenting his body, out of which the blood was shed, and which was the sacrifice it self that was offer'd up, which was more than the High-Priest did), and that but once for all; and hath thereby purchased and obtained eternal redemption for us, which the 
Levitical
 Priests could not do. Now that eternal redemption is the fruit of Christ's sacrifice, he proveth by arguing from the 
lesser to the greater.
 For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the water that was mixed with the ashes of the 
burnt-Heifer,
 or 
red-Cow
 [Numb. 
19.2, &c.
], purified from ceremonial uncleanness, and wrought that for which they were ordain'd, 
viz.
 external sanctification, to the purifying of the flesh or outward man; and he that us'd those rites, was san∣ctified and purified as to the works of external worship, how much more shall the blood
 of Christ (who by the 
Eternal Spirit
 (that is, 
His Godhead
) offer'd up him∣self a sacrifice (without spot) to God the Father, be able to purge our Consciences
 from all the spiritual uncleann ss of sin, which, makes us liable unto death; that being thus justified by faith in his blood, we may be sanctified in soul and body by his Spirit, and fitted to serve the ever-living God in a vital Christian cours
. Now lest any should stumble at Christ's death, he shews there was a necessity thereof. For upon this account Christ took on him the glorious office, to be the Mediator of the 
New Covenant
 (or new Dispensation of the Covenant of Grace), that he might by the in∣tervention of his own death (as was requis
t) make atonement and satisfa∣ction for the sins of the faithful who lived under the 
Old
 Testament, as well as for them who live under the 
New
 (the merit of his death and passion extending it self to both); and that all such as are effectually called to believe in him (whether they lived before his coming in the flesh, or since) might by the vertue of his death, obtain the promis'd eternal In∣heritance. Another reason to prove the necessity of his death, he shews may be taken from the force of the 
New Covenant,
 which signifies also a 
Testament
. For as Christ was a 
Priest
 in reference to 
God,
 making an atonement for us by the sacrifice of himself; so he is also a 
Testa∣tor
 in respect of 
us,
 bequeathing those blessings to us, which he hath purchased for us with his own blood [see 
Luke 22.29.
]. Now except Christ had dyed, his 
Testament
 or 
Will
 had not been ratified. For even among men a Testament is not of force while the Te∣stator liveth; but when his death can be proved, then 'tis firm and valid. Moreover, the 
first Covenant
 had not its sanction without typical blood. Much less can the second, which hath the nature of a 
Testament.
 Now that the 
first
 was so dedicated and solemniz'd, may appear from the History of its solemnization, 
Exod. 24;
 where 
Moses
 sprinkling with a sprinkling Instrument made of Cedar-wood, Scarlet-wool, and Hyssop) the Book of the Covenant; and all
 the people, with the

 blood
 of Calves and Goats mixed with the puri∣fying-water [see 
v. 13.
], declared, that 
that blood
 was the 
blood of the Covenant
, that is, a 
sign
 of it, and a 
seal
 confirming it, and the 
ceremony
 establishing it, which God appointed 
for
 them, or enjoined unto them. Yea, the Tabernacle and holy Ʋtensils, which were in themselves without pollution, were sprinkled with blood, because to man (not puri∣fied by faith in the blood of the Messias) all things be∣came polluted. Yea, generally, the course was under the Law, that all things that were purified, should be ce∣remonially purified by blood; yea, and without shed∣ding of blood, there could be no remission of sin. And thus it is in the 
New Covenant;
 there can be no re∣mission of sin, but by the shedding of the blood of Christ. As therefore the Law commanded, that the Taberna∣cle (which as to the inmost part 
especially,
 is an image, or figure, or pattern of Heaven), should be pu∣rified with the blood of Bullocks and Goats, so that the High-Priest should never enter in thither without such blood; so likewise it is very agreeable and pro∣portionable to these types
, that Christ should shed his blood (which is a better
 sacrifice than any of the 
Levitical
), and so enter therewith (not into the holy places made with hands, 
viz.
 the first and inmost Ta∣bernacle, but) into Heaven it self, to make way for our entrance in thither, and there to be our High-Priest, and to appear in the presence of God for us, as our Advocate. Yet the similitude betwixt Him and the High-Priest was not to hold in this, That as the High-Priest entred into the Holy of Holies once very year, with the blood of Bullocks and Goats; so Christ should often offer up himself, and often enter into Heaven. For then he should, since the beginning of the world, have dyed many times; which would have argued, That 
one Oblation
 of himself had not been sufficient. Therefore the case is far otherwise as to him. For now in the fulness of time hath he appeared, and that but once for all; and that now in this last age, this close, or shutting up of the 
Jewish
 State [see 
Mat. 24.3. 1 Cor. 10.11.
], and that on purpose to redeem and rescue us from the guilt and power of our sins, by that one oblation of himself on the Cross, 
1 Joh. 3.5.
 And as it is appointed by God, by a common law, 
Rom. 5.12,
 that all men should
 once dye, and then be judged as to their eternal state; so it is appointed of God, that Christ should only once offer us himself to bear the sins

 of many, that is, of all that shall believe in him; and that he should come the second time to judg the quick and dead in a glorious manner, when he shall have no sin imputed to him (as he had at his first coming), and to accomplish the salvation of those who look for, and expect this his glorious appearing, that their bodies may be glorified and united to their souls, and so the bliss and happiness of both may be perfected and compleated. 
From Ver. 11, to the end.


In this Chapter the Apostle proceeds to shew the 
weakness
 and 
imperfe∣ction
 of the 
Levitical Sacrifices
 (considered in themselves, and separate from what they typified), and the 
power
 and 
efficacy
 of Christ's 
Sacrifice. From Ver. 1, to 11.


The 
weakness
 of the 
Levitical
 Sacrifices he proves by four Arguments. First, From the nature of the things injoin'd by the 
Ceremonial Law,
 which were only 
types, shadows,
 and darker draughts and delineaments (as it were) of th
se 
spiritual
 and 
heavenly good things
 which were to be purchased and imparted by Ch
ist. So that the 
Levitical Ordinances
 did not present the things thems
lves in their full proportion, lively image and shape, as the Gospel does. 
2.
 Those 
Sacrifices
 which were often repeated year by year, could not (of themselves) make a satisfaction for sin, or 
justifie,
 or 
purge
 from the guilt and power of it, those who came to worship God by them. For if they could, they would have ceased to be offered; whereas the frequent re∣iteration and repeating of them, argued their weakness and imperfection. Could they once have taken away sin, or purged the Conscience from the guilt of it, there would have been no need to repeat them, seeing the worshippers once purged and cleared of the guilt of their sins by 
one
 of those Oblations and Sacrifices, would have been quieted in their Consciences, and not had them accusing and condemning them for them. But the case was far otherwise. For in those most 
solemn
 Sacrifices offered upon their 
annual day of humi∣liation
 [Lev. 
16.21.
], they were to make a solemn acknowledgment and confession
 of their sins, and not only of the sins committed that year since the last day of Expiation, but of their former sins for which they had formerly offered; which might intimate to them, that they needed 
another
 and 
better
 Sacrifice than those were, for the expiation of their sins, namely, 
that
 of the 
Messias to come, in
 and 
by
 whom alone, 
remission
 of sins was to be expected. For 'twas im∣possible that the 
blood
 of 
Bulls
 and 
Goats
 by its own vertue should take away the guilt of sin, or purifie the Conscience; and that by reason of the disproportion be∣tween the 
means of cleansing
 on the one side, and the 
thing cleans'd,
 viz. the 
Soul
 (together with the 
filth
 to be cleans'd away, to wit, 
sin
) on the other. 
From Ver. 1, to 5.


Having thus shewed the 
weakness
 of the 
Levitical
 Sacrifices, he comes now to shew the 
power
 and 
efficacy
 of Christ's Sacrifice; and that he proves from 
Psal. 40. v. 6, 7, 8.
 where Christ is brought in as newly come into the world; and made 
Man,
 speaking to his Father after this manner: 
Foras∣much as thou didst formerly appoint Sacrifices as types to prefigure the Sacrifice of thy Son, but didst not intend they should continue longer than till He mould be offered up. Thou delightest therefore in those Sacrifices now no longer; but hast sent me into the world, and pre∣pared me a body, or humane nature (holy, harmless, and free from sin, that it may be fit to be join'd with my Deity) that therein I might offer up my self a true Propitiatory Sacrifice for the sins of men.


 The words of the 
Psalmist
 are, 
Mine ear hast thou opened
; but the Apostle retaining the sense and scope
 of the place, ties not himself to the very words. The variation is but the change of a 
figura∣tive
 phrase into a 
proper,
 to express the ready obedi∣ence of Christ to do the will
 of his Father in the work of man's redemption, whereunto, by framing him a body, God had fitted him. And 'tis plain, that God was never pleas'd with the 
Levitical
 Sacrifices for their own sake, but only as they signified the death of his Son, Therefore in the fulness of time (when God saw it fit) Christ came into the world to do 
that
 which the 
Levitical
 Sacrifices did only prefigure, but could not effectuate. And when that time was come, Christ did assume our nature, and offered himself willingly unto the Father, declaring himself ready to perform his will
, and to be obedient unto him, even to the death of the Cross, for the redemption of sinners, as it was fore-prophesied of him in the Sacred Scripture, or Volume of the Law, 
Gen. 3.15.
 The 
Le∣vitical Sacrifices
 therefore being removed and taken away, as being 
insufficient
 to make expiation of sin, Christ's 
Sacrifice
 alone remaineth, as 
that only
 which pleaseth God, and is available to remove sin. Now by this 
one Oblation
 of the body of Christ, which he performed according to the will
 of God, once for 
all sorts
 of men, we that believe in him are sanctified, that is, obtain remission of sins, justification, sanctification in this life, and a 
title
 to eternal glory in the life to come. Again, there was this difference between the 
Levitical
 Priests, and Christ: They were 
many,
 and ministred as Servants, repeating daily and frequently the same sacrifices (for kind) which God had enjoin'd; none of which had power, of themselves, to free the Conscience from guilt, or the offendor from the punishment due to sin. But Christ did not always stand ministring and offering sacrifices, as they did; but having once offered up himself on the Cross (which one Sacrifice sufficeth for sin for ever), he ceased and offered no more, but ascended into heaven, and there sitteth at the right hand of his Father, and there continueth to execute his 
Kingly
 and 
Priestly Office,
 till all the enemies of our salvation, and at last Death it self, shall be vanquished; and then He shall lay down this form of governing, and with the Father and the Holy Ghost be 
all in all
 for ever; see 
1 Cor. 15.24,
 &c. And he shews, it needs not be wondred at, that Christ hath now no more offerings to make, nor sufferings to endure; for by that 
one offering
 of himself, he hath made a perfect satisfaction to the Justice of God, and a full purchase of all things
 that were requisite and needful, to bring those to eternal life who are 
sanctified
 by his grace, and brought to believe in him with a lively faith. He hath not left any other Offering to be made for them, after His. And he further proves the absolate perfection of Christ's Sacrifice, by the testimony of the Holy Ghost, recorded 
Jer. 31.31.
 where af∣ter God bad promised a 
new Covenant
 instead of the 
old,
 and had said, 
This is the Covenant I will make with them after those days (viz.
 when the days of the Old Testament are exspir'd); then He says, 
I will put my Law into their hearts, and their sins and iniquities I will re∣member no more.
 Now seeing God promiseth under the 
new
 Covenant, 
sanctification
 and 
remission of sins
 to all true believers (of which Cove∣nant Christ is the Mediator
, by whose death it is confirm'd); therefore his one Sacrifice once offered up, is abundantly sufficient. And if remission of

 sins be obtained by Christ's 
one
 Sacrifice, there needs no repetition of it, nor any other offering for sin. 
From Ver. 5, to 19.


Hitherto the Apostle hath 
doctrinally
 inform'd the 
Christian-Hebrews,
 that the 
Gospel-Ministry
 under the New Testament (ordained by Jesus Christ, God-man, our great Prophet and High-Priest), far excelleth the 
Levi∣tical Ministry
 under the Old Testament. He comes now 
practically
 to exhort them to divers Christian duties, which by way of 
application
 he inferrs from his precedent Doctrine, especially from the 
Priesthood
 of Christ. And first, He exhorts them constantly to hold fast their profession of 
faith in Christ. 2.
 To be very careful that their conversation be correspondent to the Precepts of the Gospel. In his Exhortation, he useth some arguments taken from the 
Leviti∣cal Types;
 which he so lays down, that withal they may tend to raise the minds of the believing-Hebrews to consider the excellency of the things sig∣nified thereby. And, 
1.
 He shews them, That they having now 
free access unto God in Heaven,
 through the blood of Jesus, and not by the blood of beasts, nor through the 
old way,
 the veil of the Sanctuary, as the High-Priest was wont to enter into the Holy of Holies; but by a 
new
 and 
everlasting way
 (giving life and refreshment to them that walk in it) which Christ hath consecrated and prepared for them, through the sacrifice of his own Flesh and Humanity, which was a veil to cover and hide his Divinity. And see∣ing He is now the great 
High-Priest
 over the Church of God, invested with all authority and power, and having 
all
 in substance, which His Type prefi∣gured; therefore, 
(1.)
 They should draw near to Jesus with a sincere heart, and with fulness of faith, that so they might have their souls sprinkled with his blood, and delivered from the accusation of an evil condemning Consci∣ence (and so furnished with a good answer to all challenges), and 
their bo∣dies washed with pure water,
 that is, sanctified by the Spirit of Christ, which was signified by the legal washings. 
(2.)
 They should hold fast the pro∣fession of their faith or hope in Christ, without wavering or warping in time trial: for the promises which God hath made to those who constantly 
be∣lieve in, and adhere to his Son,
 shall certainly be performed. 
(3.)
 He ex∣horts them to maintain Christian communion, as an help to their stedfastness and perseverance in the faith; observing 
(e)
 one ano∣ther,
 and exciting and provoking one another to 
love
 and all good works; and to maintain this communion both 
publikely
 and 
privately;
 and the rather, because the 
day
 
of vengeance
 on the obdurate Jews drew nigh. 
From Ver. 19, to 26.


He further presseth his Exhortation to 
stedfastness in the faith,
 by divers arguments: 
1.
 From the fearful case of 
wilful Apostates,
 who after illu∣mination and profession of faith in Christ, make defection from him, and wil∣fully reject him and the benefit of his Sacrifice. For such persons, he tells them, there remains no other sacrifice for sin, nor other way of remission, nor any other means to help them; But, having 
knowingly
 and 
wilfully
 rejected Christ, and 
maliciously
 betaken themselves to the side of his Adversaries, there remains nothing for them but a dreadful expectation of the fiery in∣dignation of God, which shall devour all such enemies of His. He shews, that the Contemner of 
Moses
's Law (legally convicted under two or three wit∣nesses) was adjudged to 
capital punishment
 without mercy; therefore much sorer punishment is due to the Contemners of Christ, who tread under foot (as it were) the Son of God, counting him as a 
vile person,
 and as one that dyed as a Malefactor; and count the blood of the Covenant, by which

 Christ was 
sanctified
 (that is, consecrated to God as a 
Sacred Victim
) an unholy thing, and do 
despight to the Spirit of Grace,
 as if he were a 
lyar,
 who convinceth them of the Deity and Divine Power of Christ. He further shews, That God professeth himself an Avenger of all sin and injuries done to his people 
[Deut. 32.36. Psal. 135.14.];
 and much more will he shew himself an Avenger of so horrible a sin and injury against his Son. And 'tis a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, when, as an angry Judg, he taketh vengeance on his enemies. 
From Ver. 26, to 32.


2.
 He urgeth them to persevere; setting before them their former profes∣sion of the faith, and their sufferings for it, 
partly
 whilst they themselves were openly reproached and oppressed by the enemies of the Gospel; and 
partly,
 whilst they out of Christian sympathy join'd themselves as companions to those that were so used. And particularly, he acknowledges how they had shewed compassion to him in his bonds, in mourning for him, and relieving of him. He also takes notice, how they took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, moved thereto from their assurance of a better inheritance in Heaven. Having there∣fore endured so much, he advises them not to desist or shrink from a bold and couragious profession
 of Christ and his Doctrine, which would be crown'd with a great recompence of reward. He further tells them, they have 
need of patience,
 that they may be enabled to do and suffer whatever Christ shall call them unto; that 
so persevering,
 they may attain the promised re∣ward. For 'tis but a little while ere He will come to take vengeance on the obdurate Jews. In the mean time he shews them, that (as the Prophet 
Habbakkuk
 advises, 
ch. 24.) the just must live by faith;
 but if any 
apo∣statize
 from their profession, God will abhor those persons. But he tells them, he hopes better things of them (see 
chap. 6. v. 9.
), namely, that they are not of the number of those that will apostatize, but such as will persevere in the faith, to the saving of their souls. 
From Ver. 32, to the end.


He proceeds to press his former Exhortation to 
perseverance in the faith,
 
 with divers arguments drawn from the 
nature, properties, effects,
 and 
ex∣cellency
 of Faith, and illustrated from the manifold experiences of the Saints of old.


And, 
1.
 he gives a 
description
 of Faith
 decla∣ring it to be the substance or subsistence of things ho∣ped for; that is (firmly resting on God's Truth and faithfulness, and that he will infallibly perform what he hath promised), it gives, as it were, a present 
be∣ing
 and 
subsistence
 (in the mind of the believer) to things 
future,
 and which are not yet enjoyed, but only hoped-for and expected; and it evidently represents to the eye of the soul 
things
 that cannot be seen with our bodily eyes. 
2.
 By 
faith,
 he shews it was, that the 
Elders
 and 
Saints
 that lived in former ages, ob∣tained the honourable testimony of God's approving of them. Thus God testified of 
Noah,
 That he was a 
just and upright man, and one that walked with him. Abraham
 also received this testimony, That he 
was the friend of God;
 and 
David,
 That he was 
a man after God's own heart. 3. Faith
 fully rests in what God hath revealed concerning his making 
the worlds
 (that is, all manner of Creatures, above and below, visible and invisible) 
out of nothing,
 (that is, out of no pre-existent

 matter), by the word of his power. And if 
faith
 be assured of such an Almighty Power in God, whereby he made this excellent structure of the world; how can it doubt of His power and ability to perform any of his promises made to his people? 
Ver. 3.


He now produces the examples of those ancient 
Worthies
 who gave emi∣nent proof of their 
faith.
 And,


1.
 He shews, that 
Abel
 by faith offered a more excellent Sacrifice than 
Cain.
 For 
Abel
 not only offered of the best and fattest of his Flock, whilst 
Cain
 in probability offered only some slight fruits; but 
Abel
 in his offering looked to 
the seed of the woman which should tread upon the Serpent's head;
 that is, unto Christ, who by his death should destroy the Devil, 
Heb. 2.14.
 By which faith (applying to himself the righteousness of the Messias) he obtained a testimony from God, that he was righteous, 
Mat. 23.35.
 For nothing can make a sinner righteous before God, but the righteousness of Christ laid hold on by faith, 
2 Cor. 5.21.
 And God had respect unto 
A∣bel
's person, and to his offering; manifesting his accep∣tation of them, either by
 fire from Heaven, or some other way discernable by 
Cain.
 And his 
faith,
 and the fruits thereof, being registred in the holy Scripture; he thereby speaketh as evidently to us, as if we heard his voice.


2.
 He instances in 
Enoch,
 who by faith pleased God, and had the testi∣mony thereof, by an inward witness of the Spirit, testifying to his Consci∣ence that God approved him. Insomuch that he was translated from Earth to Heaven (not 
seeing,
 that is, not 
suffering
 or 
tasting
 death), and was not found any more on earth, among the living, though possibly those who lived at that time, missing of him, did search for him, as the Children of the Pro∣phets did for 
Elijah
 after he was taken up into Heaven, 
2 King. 2.17.
 And that it was 
Enoch
's 
Faith
 with which God was so singularly pleased, he proves by this Maxim, 
Without faith
 
it is impossible to please him,
 seeing no man 
out of Christ
 can please him so, as to obtain eternal salva∣tion. 
Joh. 14.6.
 For he that comes to God either in 
prayer
 or 
thanksgiving,
 must believe that he is the only 
true God
 (such a God as he hath revealed himself to be), and that he is the 
Rewarder
 of those that diligently seek his favour (in the way he hath revealed in the Gospel), and that his 
Mercy
 is no other way obtainable.


3.
 He instances in 
Noah,
 who being warn'd of God concerning the com∣ing of the Flood (a hundred and twenty years after), believed and feared, and by the command of God prepared an Ark
 to the saving of his Fa∣mily; by which he bore his testimony against the disobedient and unbelieving world, 
2 Pet. 2.5,
 and became 
heir of the righteousness which is by faith
 [see 
Gal. 5.5.
], that is, an heir
 of that eternal inheritance which is obtained by the 
righteousness of faith,
 viz. the Righteousness of Christ, whom he eyed in his preservation by the Ark, which was a type of Him, 
v. 7.




4.
 A Fourth 
Worthy
 he mentions, is 
Abraham
 who by faith followed God, calling him to leave his own Countrey, and go whithersoever he should direct him, not knowing whither it was; only receiving a promise from God, that his posterity should be possessors of that place whither he was appointed to go, but no way as∣sured that himself should ever be owner of any part of it. And being come into the Land of Pro∣mise, he sojourned in it as a stranger, living in 
Tents
 erected for a transitory passage, and not in houses, as places of a fixed abode. And so likewise did 
Isaac
 and 
Jacob
 after him, who were heirs with him of the same Promise
. And that which mov'd him not to go back again in a discontented mood, but patiently to bear this Pilgrim's life, was, because he had his eye on 
Heaven
 (which he expected God would give him as a reward of his faith and obedience), which is a City that hath 
foundations
 (whereas the 
Tents
 in which he dwelt, had none, but only were fastned to posts or stakes set in the ground), that is, the state of Heaven is unchangeable and unalterable; and whilst other Cities are built by men, God himself is the Builder and Maker of this City. He hath made it the place wherein he intends to ma∣nifest and reveal his own glory, and make it most apparent to Angels and Men; and by shewing them his glory, to glorifie them. 
Ver. 8, 9, 10.


5. Sarah
 also, though aged and barren, by 
faith
 leaning on the pro∣mise
 of God, conceived by 
Abraham,
 when his body, as to the begetting of children, was as it were dead; and so the promise of God touching his in∣numerable off-spring took place. 
Ver. 11, 12.


6.
 He shews, that all those last mention'd, 
viz. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
 and 
Sarah,
 died in the faith, that is, in assured expectation that the 
Pro∣mises
 made to them, 
viz.
 of a 
numerous off-spring,
 and the 
Land of Ca∣naan,
 &c. should be performed in God's due time, though they never enjoyed those good things promised themselves, but only by the eye of their minds saw them, and were confident of the accomplishment of them; and so saluted and embraced them by the arms of their faith, though afar off, rejoycing in them, and thinking it enough that their posterity should enjoy them. In the mean time they professed themselves to be 
pil∣grims
 and 
strangers
 in the earth. And this lan∣guage of theirs, 
calling themselves sojourners in the Land of Canaan, and not possessors of it,
 signified, that they did not think themselves at home, but that they had another Countrey in their desires, which was not their own Countrey of 
Chaldaea,
 from whence 
Abraham
 first went out upon God's call; for he and his posterity had many opportunities to have gone back thither, if 
that
 had been the Countrey they looked after. But 'tis plain, the Countrey they had in their desires, was an 
heavenly,
 whereof 
Canaan
 was only a type; wher
fore God is not ashamed to be called 
their God
 (even after their death, 
Exod. 3.6. Mat. 22.32.
) who by their faith gave glory to him in this life, acknowledging his power and faithfulness. And when they dyed, he prepared for them a 
City,
 an heavenly City, which is a superabun∣dant recompence for their earthly Countrey which they left at his command. 
Ver. 13, 14, 15, 16.




By faith
 
Abraham
 when he was tried, and required by God to give a clear evidence of his obedience, 
Gen. 22,
 was ready, and did really intend to offer up 
Isaac,
 his only begotten Son of 
Sarah
 his lawful Wife, though he had received, embraced, and firmly believed the Promises of God, that a 
nume∣rous seed should spring from him,
 Gen. 
13.15;
 Nay more, that the Mes∣sias himself (in whom all the Nations of the Earth were to be blessed) should come of him; for so the promise ran, 
In I∣saac
 
shall thy seed be called;
 that is, that posterity thou shalt have by 
Isaac,
 shall be very eminent, and shall propagate thy name, and shall possess the Land of 
Canaan,
 and the Messias according to the flesh shall spring from his loins. And that which strengthned and supported his faith, was this; he reasoned and
 consi∣dered with himself, that though he should sacrifice this his Son, God was able to raise him up again from the dead, and would undoubtedly work such a miracle, ra∣ther than fail of his promise. And accordingly 
Abra∣ham
 received him again in a 
similitude
 or 
like∣ness,
 and 
after a sort,
 even as if he had been raised from the dead; for his nearness to death was a type, figure, and similitude of death [and accordingly called death, 
2 Cor. 1.10.
], and he was as a dead man in his father's account. 
Ver. 17, 18, 19.


8.
 By faith 
Isaac
 having revelations from the Lord concerning future things, setled in his heart an assurance of the accomplishment of them; and accordingly with a prophetical spirit he blessed his sons. And though through his fatherly affection he had a mind to have conferred the main blessing on his eldest son, 
Gen. 27;
 yet God so over-ruled the matter by his Providence, that the younger had the greater blessing. 
Esau
 was blessed with temporal blessings, but 
Jacob
 with temporal and spiritual also. 
Jacob
's posterity were to be 
Lords
 over 
Esau
's; which co
tinued from 
David
's time 
(2 Sam. 8.14.)
 till the reign of 
Jehoram (2 King 8.20.),
 when the posterity of 
Esau
 broke the yoke from off their neck, as 
Isaac
 had foretold 
[Gen. 27.40.] Ver. 20.


9.
 By faith 
Jacob
 when he was near unto death, blessed the two sons of 
Joseph,
 adopting them into his family, preferring 
Ephraim
 the younger be∣fore 
Manasseh
 the elder, by God's appointment; and making them Heads of two distinct Tribes, he gave them portions in the Land of 
Cana
 as if he had been present at the distribution of it, 
Gen, 48.22.
 And inclining upon his Pillow at his beds-head, being weak and feeble, he held his staff in his hand too; and leaning on it, he worshipped
 God, devoutly praising of him, that he should be buried with his Fathers, as 
Joseph
 had promis'd him; and that his bones should be carried into 
Canaan,
 which was a token and pledg that his posterity should inherit that Land, and that God would bring them thither. 
Ver. 21.


10.
 By faith 
Joseph
 when he was near unto death, made mention of the depar∣ture of the Children of 
Israel
 out of 
Egypt,
 Gen. 
15.24,
 and commanded that his bones should be carried along with them, and buried in 
Canaan,
 which he was assured God in his due time would give them for an inheri∣tance. 
Ver. 22.




11.
 By faith
 it was that 
Moses
's Parents, 
Amram
 and 
Jochebed
 (both of the Tribe of 
Levi
) having received a revelation from God (as some think
) that from them should spring 
one
 who should be the procurer of liberty to that people; and a Child being born to them of more than ordinary beauty and comeliness, they believed, and concluded that this was 
He
 whom God intended for the Deliverer of his people; and therefore notwithstanding the cruel Edict of 
Pharaoh [Gen. 1.26.],
 they hid him three Months; and possibly by rea∣son of some discovery that was made of him, dur
t hide him no longer 
[Exod. 2.3.]. Ver. 23.


12.
 By faith 
Moses
 when he was forty years old 
[Acts 7.23.]
 refu∣sed to be called the adopted Son of 
Pharaoh
's Daughter
, preferring the afflicted condition of the people of God, and esteeming the re∣proaches
 that the Members of Christ's Mystical Body unjustly suffer, greater riches than the Treasures of 
Egypt.
 For, such reproaches he knew would be recompenced with an exceeding great reward
; and to this he had an eye. 
Ver. 24, 25, 26.


13.
 By faith he led the people out of 
Egypt [Exod. 10.29.],
 notwithstanding the King's threatnings; and was constant and couragious in doing his duty, as having the eye of his faith fix'd on him who is Invisible, and who is a ready help in time of trouble. 
Ver. 27.


14.
 By faith he kept the 
Passover,
 and sprinkled the blood
 of the Pascal-Lamb on the thresholds and posts of the doors of the Children of 
Israel [Exod. 12.21.
 &c.] that the destroying-Angel that was sent to destroy the first-born of the 
Egyptians
 that night, might not hurt them. The King of 
Egypt
 had commanded the 
Midwives
 to kill all the Male-children of the 
Is∣raelites
 in the birth; which cruel Edict, because it took not effect, he made another more cruel, That all his people should cast every Son that was born of an 
Israelite,
 into the water, 
Exod. 1.16, 22.
 God therefore destroyeth 
all their first-born,
 and thus suiteth his Judgment unto their Sin. 
Ver. 26.


15.
 By faith the 
Israelites
 passed through the 
Red-Sea
, 
Moses
 being their Leader; which the 
Egyptians
 essaying to do, were drowned.


16.
 By the faith of 
Joshua,
 and the other 
Israelites
 (who trusted in God that he would accomplish all his Promises), the Walls of 
Jericho
 (a strong and well-fenced City, and a Frontier-Town that kept them from en∣tring far into 
Canaan
) fell down when they had encompassed it

 seven
 days: They went round about it 
once a day
 for six days together; and on the seventh day they went round it seven times; and then giving a great shout, all the Walls, over against which the 
Israelites
 marched
, fell flat to the ground, and the Army entred into the City, and destroyed it. 
Ver. 30.


17. Rahab,
 who, as it seems, kept an Inn or Victualling-house in 
Jericho,
 and probably had formerly been of an infamous life
, as many among the Gentiles of that profession were [see 
Jam. 2.25.
]; having heard of God's won∣derful works, 
Jos. 2.9. &c.
 was thereby brought to be∣lieve and acknowledg the God of 
Israel
 for the 
true God;
 and understanding that He had given the 
Is∣raelites
 the Land of 
Canaan
 for a p
ssession, she desi∣red communion with them as the true and only people of God, and was resolv'd to live and dye with them. And as a testimony of her faith, she peaceably and courteously entertain'd the 
Israelitish Spies,
 and protected them, and dismiss'd them in safety; and thereupon was saved from perishing with her unbelieving and disobe∣dient f
llow Citizens; and afterwards she was married among the 
Israelites,
 to 
Salmon
 the Father of 
Boaz,
 one of the fore-fathers of 
David,
 and consequently of Christ 
[M
. 1.5.]. Ver. 31.


18.
 The Apostle having thus instanc'd in divers worthy Examples of faith; he shews, that besides th
se there 
re many more that might be nam'd, and that a 
long time
 would not be sufficient to write of them. He mentions 
Gi∣d
on
 and 
Barac, Sampson
 and 
Jephta, David
 and 
Samuel,
 and some of the ancient Prophets. These being extraordinarily raised up by God for the special good of his Church, and the Commonwealth of the 
Jews,
 and firmly d
pending on his power, they 
fearlesly
 discharged their duty in governing the 
Israelites,
 fighting their battels, and making conquests; 
Gideon
 over the 
Midianites, Barac
 over the 
Canaanites, Sampson
 over the 
Philistines, Jephta
 over the 
Ammonites, David
 over the 
Amalekites, Jebusites, Moabites, Philistines, Idumaeans,
 and 
Syrians.
 'Twas their 
faith
 that gave them courage to fight those battels, and make those conquests. 'Twas by their 
faith
 that they not only lived godly and righteous lives thems
lves, but were eminent also in administring righteousness and Justice among the men of their times, see 
2 Sam. 8.15.
 'Twas by their 
faith
 that they obtained the performance of some special and particular Promises made unto themselves, as 
Da∣vid
 of a Kingdom. 
&c.
 'Twas by 
faith
 that the Pro∣phets who lived after 
Samuel
 and 
David,
 obtain'd of God that such memorable things should be done for them. As particularly, 
Daniel
 obtained that miracle of mercy and deliverance from God; that the 
Lions,
 when he was thrown into their Dens, did him no hurt. O∣thers were so favoured by God, that the 
fire
 did them n
 harm when they were cast into it, as 
Daniel
's three Companions. Others escaped present danger of being killed by the Sword, as 
David
 by 
Saul, Eli∣jah
 and 
Michajah
 by 
Ahab.
 Others out of weakness were made strong, that

 is recovered out of desperate Diseases, as King 
Hezekiah.
 Others became won∣derfully valiant in battel, as 
Jonathan, 1 Sam. 13,
 and 
14;
 and 
David
's Captains, 
2 Sam. 23,
 and routed the Armies of the Heathen-
Canaanites,
 and such-like aliens and strangers from the Covenant of God.


Another effect of the vigour of Faith, was this, That some women thereby received their dead children raised to life again, as the 
Widow of Sarepta
 that entertained 
Elijah, 1 King. 17;
 and the 
Shunamite
 that lodged 
Elisha, 2 King. 4.
 And by faith it was that other 
Worthies
 of the Old Testament when rack'd and tormented for a knowledging and professing the truth, re∣fus'd to be deliver'd to the prejudice of their Piety, and their Consciences, when they might; believing that th
ugh they were put to death, they should have a glorious resurrection to life eternal after death; and looking upon that as much more desirable than a present freedom from their t
rments. For if they would have denied God, and broken his Commandments, they might have had a kind of 
resurrection
 from the sentence of death pronounced a∣gainst them, and have lived longer in the world. But they refused 
that
 for a far better resurrection, which they assuredly expected. Here s
me think the Apostle hath reference to the Case of 
Eleazer,
 and those torturings which were exercis'd under the Tyrant 
Antiochus, 2 Mac. 6.18:
 But we need not go so far: If the 
three Children
 would have fallen down and worshipped 
Nebuchadnezzar
's Golden Image, they might have been delivered. If 
Daniel
 would have prayed to King 
Darius,
 he might have escaped the Lyons Den. The Apostle goes on to shew how other Worthies were tried by 
mockings
 and reproaches, as 
Micajah, 1 King. 22.24;
 and 
scourgings,
 as 
Jeremiah, Jer. 20.2,
 and 
37.15;
 and 
bonds
 and 
imprisonments,
 as 
Joseph
 in 
Egypt,
 and 
Jeremy:
 Some were stoned, as 
Zacharias
 the son of 
Jehojada, 2
 Chron. 
24.21:
 Some were 
sawn
 
asun∣der,
 as the ancient Jewish Histories testifie of 
Isaiah
 under the tyranny of 
Manasseh.
 Others being tempted with fair promises, and remaining resolute, were slain with the sword, as it happened to many in 
Ahab
's time, 
1 King. 19.10;
 as also in 
Manasseh
's, 
2
 King. 
21.16.
 Others were driven from their own homes, and forc'd to wander about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, destitute of all things needful, and many ways perplexed and afflicted. And yet such excellent persons as these, whose company the world was not worthy to enjoy, were forc'd to wander about in deserts and mountains, and to hide themselves in dens and caves of the earth. 
From Ver. 31, to 39.


The Apostle having thus set forth the vigour of Faith by the admirable effects of it in doing and suffering: He concludes this discourse, declaring, That all these Saints, though they obtained testimony
, that 
through their faith they pleased God;
 yet they obtained not the accomplishment of the great promise 
(a)
 of the exhibition of the Messias, God having reserved that great mercy to the times of the New Testament,
 that they should not be perfect∣ed
, that is, 
justified
 and 
saved
 by any thing done in their time, but by

 looking to our time, and Christ's satisfaction made therein
, whereby both 
they
 and 
we
 are perfected; God not intending that the Infant-condition of the Church should be made perfect before the exhibition of Christ, nor without the more compleat condition of the Church after Christ. 
From Ver. 39, to the end.


 The Apostle having pressed these 
Christian Hebrews
 to 
perseverance in the faith,
 and to 
patience
 under the cross, and the afflictions they might meet with for the sake of Christ, from the many instan∣ces
 of the former Saints mentioned in the foregoing Chapter (who have witnessed to them the power and ef∣ficacy of their faith): He comes now further to encou∣rage them to follow their example. And in order here∣unto he tells them, they should lay aside 
every weight,
 that is, the inordinate love of the world, and the im∣moderate cares and sollicitudes about it (which are so apt to press down the soul), and 
the sin
 
that doth so easily beset us,
 that is, doth so usually incumber and entangle us (
viz.
 the slavish fear of men, and of loss of our wordly comforts or life) and should run with pa∣tience the race that is set before them, and is appointed for them by God, 
persevering therein,
 whatsoever difficulties or afflictions they may meet with, as they that hope for a glorious reward when they come at the end of their course.


And that they may be enabled comfortably to run their Christian course, and to persevere in the faith, he advises them to 
look up to Jesus,
 who by his word and spirit first works
 the grace of 
Faith
 in us, and afterwards carries it on, preserves and encreases it. He adviseth them, not only to look up to him for help, but to eye him as their 
Captain
 and 
Leader,
 who for the joy that was s
t before him (unto which by his sufferings he was not only to come himself, but also to bring all that truly believe in him, 
Luke 24.26. 1
 Pet. 
1.11.
) patiently endured the cross, and despised the shame (which was cast upon him by sinners both in his life, and at his death), and after his sufferings was advanc'd to the highest pitch of glory, dignity, and power (far above all creatures), next unto God himself; and will reward all the Mem∣bers of his Mystical Body for whatsoever they 
do
 or 
suffer
 for him. And he shews them, that it will be requisite they duly consider and often medi∣tate on Christ's 
Patience,
 and how great opposition and contradiction from sinners he endured, lest they grow weary and be discouraged under the Cross, and faint in their minds. But they might possibly object, That they had suffer∣ed much already; see 
ch. 10.32, 33, 34.
 He answers, They had indeed suffered 
much,
 but not so much as they must be ready and prepared to suffer. They had not suffered as their 
Lord
 and 
Master
 had done, to the effusion of his blood, striving against, and opposing the wickedness and infidelity of the ene∣mies of the Gospel, who by cruel and bloody courses endeavoured to force men from the faith, as they had dealt with 
Stephen
 and 
James,
 Acts 
7,
 and 
12.
 And therefore every suffering less than 
that,
 ought to seem tolerable in their eyes. 
From Ver. 1, to 5.


And that he may further stir them up to patience and perseveran
e in the faith, he tells them, they should consider, that all 
their sufferings
 are but 
fatherly chastisements.
 Which consideration that he might imprint the more upon their minds, he asks them whether they have for∣gotten
 the exhortation and divine counsel of 
Wisdom to her children,
 Prov. 
3.11,
 That they should neither 
despise
 nor 
disregard
 the chastnings of the Lord, nor

 
faint,
 nor sink under them. For God chastens
 
in love
 every one whom he acknowledges for his son, and receives into his especial care. And therefore in that they are chastised in order to their amendment, they are to reckon themselves to be dealt with by God 
as children.
 For what s
n is there whom a 
wise father
 doth not cor∣rect, when he sees him stand in need of it? If any be totally freed and ex∣empted from chastisement (to which all true and genuine children are ob∣noxious, and which every prudent Parent inflicts upon his dearest children when he sees there is cause), 'tis an argument, that though they be in the fa∣ther's family, yet they are not 
owned
 and acknowledged by him (and so have no title to, or just expectation of the inheritance), but indeed are 
bastards
 and not s
ns; of which this is a shrew'd token, that God suffers them to go on without 
discipline,
 and to follow their own evil ways. Furthermore he tells them, they should consider, that our Parents who begat us, and were instru∣ments (under God) of our bodily and earthly being, did in our childhood chastise and correct us, yet we have not been incited thereby to reverence them the l
ss, or to forsake or renounce them. And shall we not much rather be in subjection to the 
Father of Spirits
 
[Eccles. 12.7.]
 when he corrects us in order to our spiritual amendment, and that we may at last obtain of him 
eternal life,
 as a reward of our patience and obedience. And 'tis further to be consider'd, that earthly Parents chastise their chil∣dren only whilst they are children
, and no longer; and many times by the rules of their own judgment and will (which very often are corrupt and depraved), but our heavenly Father's 
chastisements
 are all managed with infinite wisdom, and he purely intendeth our pro∣fit therein, that he may thereby form and fashion us unto holiness, and bring us to a participation of his own Divine Nature. 'Tis true indeed, he tells them, 
Afflictions
 are no pleasing things in themselves, nor joyous for the pre∣sent; but the fruit of sanctified affliction is 
righteousness
 and 
holiness,
 which bring peace to the conscience, after we have been some time exercis'd, and our corruptions subdued with this discipline. From all the foregoing considerations, he exhorts them to 
courage
 and 
constancy
 in the ways of Christ, alluding to the words of the Prophet 
Esay,
 chap. 
35.3. Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees;
 as if he should have said, Seeing so glorious fruits spring from sanctifi'd afflictions, be not dejected in mind, nor suffer fear to seize upon you (which weakens the hands, and infeebles the knees, and cau∣seth them to smite one again
t another); but be couragious in your souls; and in case y
ur spirits begin to fail, quicken them up again, and endeavour to renew y
ur spiritual strength and courage; and 
make straight paths with your feet
; that is, manifest the course wherein you walk, to be the right way that leadeth to life, that others may see it, and follow you therein, and look to it, that 
the lame be not turned out of the way
, 
but that they rather be healed,
 that is, that the 
weak
 be not disheartned, or turned out of the right way, but rather cured of their fears, and confirmed in their Christian course. 
From Ver. 5, to 14.


The Apostle having thus endeavoured to strengthen them in the Faith, and in a couragious profession thereof, he comes now to give them many wholesome precepts for the right ordering their life and conversation, that thereby they may adorn their profession.




1.
 That they endeavour as much as in them lies, to be at peace with all men
 
[Rom. 15.18.];
 yet whilst they endeavour after 
peace,
 they must be sure they neglect not 
holiness.
 For with
ut peace with men, they may obtain eternal salvation; but without holiness no man shall ever see God to his com∣fort. 
V
r. 14.


2.
 That they be not only careful as to their own particulars, but also watchful one over another; that they look to it diligently, and take what care they can that none among them fail or fai
 short of the 
grace of God;
 that is, fail of the grace of God offered in the Gospel, or fall from the pure doctrine of grace; and that no 
root of bitterness
 spring up among them, 
viz.
 no dangerous 
er∣ror, heresie,
 or 
schism;
 no 
envy,
 or 
malice,
 to the troubling, polluting, and infecting of them. See 
Deut. 29.18.


3.
 That they take care there be no 
fornicators
 or 
prophane
 persons found among them, such as 
Esau
 was, who through the impa∣tience of his hunger, for 
one mess of meat
 sold his 
birth-right
 with all the priviledges thereunto be∣longing (whereof the Priesthood was one); which was so provoking a sin in the sight of God, that after∣wards when he would fain have recover'd this blessing, he found no place for 
repentance
 
r 
alteration of mind,
 in his Father 
Isaac;
 neither could he move him to re∣verse or recall the blessing, which as a 
Prophet
 of God, and as 
His Instrument
 (though with mistake as to his apprehension) he had conferred on 
Jacob,
 though he sought it with tears. And as 
Esau
 was rejected from the blessings of the birth-right (which before, 
Gen. 25.34,
 he had so vilely contemned); So prophane contem∣ners of the grace offered in the Gospel (whereby we be∣come Priests unto God, to offer up spiritual sacrifices ac∣ceptable through Christ) ought to fear being excluded from the mercy of God; and that though they earnestly seek it when it is too late, God will not repent or alter his righteous sentence upon them.


4.
 That he may further set out what a heinous sin it is, and how high a degree of prophaness, to neglect or despise the grace of God offered in the Gospel, he shews them the difference betwixt the 
Law
 and 
Gospel
, and to how much better a state and condition they were advanced under the 
Gospel,
 than the Jews were in under the 
Law
 and old Administra∣tion of the Covenant of Grace, notwithstanding all their boasting of their great priviledges. That therefire he may shew the excellency of 
Christianity
 above 
Judaism,
 he tells these Christian-Hebrews, that they were not called to hear the promulgation of the Law given on Mount 
Sinai.
, a 
material Mountain,
 that was in it self tou
hable and palpable by the hands of men (though in respect 
f God's charge it might not at that time be touched
), a 
Mountain
 burning with fire, and co∣ver'd with blackness, and darkness, and tempest, the trum∣pet sounding, and the voice of God in a dreadful man∣ner promulgating the Law; which voice was so terri∣ble, that the people were not able to he
r it, but re∣quested that God would not speak to them any more, 
Exod. 20.19.
 And so formidable was the aspect of all things that appeared there at that time, that 
Moses
 him∣self. said, 
I exceedingly fear and tremble.
 The Apo∣stle having thus set out with how much terror the 
Law,
 and the 
old Admini∣stration
 was delivered, which was enough to keep these 
Hebrews
 from any de∣sire

 to return to 
Judaism,
 he comes now to set before them the happy condi∣tion to wbich they were advanced under the Gospel. He tells them, that by the 
Gospel
 they have been 
called,
 and by faith 
received
 into the communion of the 
Christian Church,
 figured by Mount 
Sion (Psal. 2.6,
 opposite to Mount 
Sinai, Gal. 4.26.
), which he calls 
the Heavenly Jerusalem,
 the 
City of the living God,
 be
ause it is set up, and especially governed by God. And hereby also they come to have 
communion
 with the 
holy Angels
, who are 
Ministers
 of Christ, and 
fel∣low-servants
 of believers 
[Rev. 19.10.],
 and make a part of the 
Catholick
 or 
universal Church,
 the great assembly of the 
first-born
, that is, of the 
Elect,
 who by the special grace of God have received many heavenly priviledges above other men, as the 
first-born
 among the 
Jews
 had above his brethren; and whose names are inrolled in Heaven, and 
they
 reckoned by God as 
free Denizens
 of his heavenly City, though they be not actually possess'd of the glory thereof
 Nay further, hereby th
y come to have spiritual communion with God himself, the 
Judg of all,
 and with the 
Saints in bliss,
 the spirits of just men made perfect, they being all Children of the same 
Father,
 and all united to the same 
Head,
 all Members of the same 
Body,
 and ha∣ving all a spiritual animation by the same 
Spirit.
 Yea, by the Gospel they are brought to 
Jesus
 the 
Mediator of the New Covenant
 (not to 
Moses
 the typical Mediator of the old) who hath established it with his own blood. And to 
faith in this blood
 (wherewith their consciences must be sprinkled before they can be admitted into Heaven), they are brought by the Gospel; which blood speaks better things than the blood of 
Abel.
 For 
that
 cried for vengeance on 
Cain,
 but 
this
 for mercy on penitent believers
. Therefore he advises them to take heed they despise not Christ speak∣ing to them in the Gospel. For if 
they
 were destroyed that contemned 
Moses,
 who received his message on earth, and delivered the Law only from Mount 
Sinai,
 then much severer destruction is to be expected for them who d
spise 
Him
 who came down from Heaven, and re∣ceived his message in the bosome of his Father, 
Joh. 1.18,
 and doth now speak to us from Heaven by his Spirit in his Apostles and other faithful Ministers. And that he might further set out unto them the excel∣lency of Christ's Person, and the dignity of his Gospel, he shews them, that the 
voice
 of Christ in promul∣gating the Law, 
shook the earth,
 that is, Mount 
Si∣nai;
 but he promised by the Prophet 
Haggai,
 ch. 
2.
 v. 
7,
 That he would shake not only the 
earth,
 but 
heaven
 also; whi
h prophesie was partly fulfilled at his first coming in the flesh
. For then at his 
birth
 an ex∣traordinary 
light
 shined about the Shepherds, 
Luk. 2.9;
 and an extraordinary Star appeared in the heavens, 
Mat. 2.29;
 and at his 
Baptism
 the heavens opened, 
Mat. 3.17;
 and at his 
Transfiguration
 a voice came out of the cloud, 
Mat. 17.5;
 and at his 
Passion
 the Sun was darkned, the Earth shook, and the Graves opened, and many dead Saints came out and appeared: And at the 
feast of Pentecost
 there came from Heaven a sound, as of a rushing mighty wind, and the Holy Ghost in the shape of cloven fiery tongues resting on the Apostles, and miraculously inabling them to speak all languages, all Nations were shaken with the preaching of the Gospel. But this prophecy shall be more perfectly fulfilled when Christ shall come to judgment, when heaven and earth

 shall be burnt with fire; and whats
ever corruptibility they have, shall be abo∣lished, 
2 Pet. 3.7,
 that a 
new Heaven
 and a 
new Earth
 may succeed, wherein shall dwell righteousness; that is, wherein the Saints being made im∣mortal, and perfec
ly righteous, shall dwell and abide. The Apostle further com∣menteth upon these words of 
Haggai
 (following the Translation of the 
LXX,
 in his quotation of them), and shews, that this word 
once more
, doth in∣timate, that heaven and earth shall pass away, and shall be wonderfully chan∣ged and altered
, in respect of their present state; that 
they being remo∣ved,
 he may make a 
new Heaven
 and a 
new Earth,
 wherein his subjects may for ever abide under his Rule and Government. He concludes this mat∣ter with this serious exhortation, That seeing they had by faith in Christ ob∣tained
 a 
right
 to this glorious and immutable Kingdom 
[2 Pet. 1.11.],
 he advises them to hold fast and improve the grace they had already recei∣ved, that thereby they might be enabled to serve God acceptably, reverencing him in their hearts as their heavenly Father, and fearing to offend him. see∣ing he is to be their Judg. For he will be a consuming-fire to all disobedi∣ent impenitent sinners, and will execute his wrath very severely against all Apostates. 
From Ver. 14, to the end.


 The Apostle having thus instructed these Christian-
Hebrews
 concerning per∣severance in the faith; he now comes, towards the close of his Epistle, to ex∣hort them to sundry other duties.


1.
 That 
brotherly love
 and 
Christian charity
 should abide and continue among them, and that they constantly persevere therein. See 
Heb. 6.10,
 and 
Eph. 4.3, &c.


2.
 That they should exercise 
Hospitality,
 and kindly entertain strangers and banished Christians, who were oftentimes constrained to forsake their own Countrey, and knew not where to turn in; see 
Rom. 12.18. 1 Pet. 4.9.
 And to encourage them the more hereunto, he tells them, that some have here∣by 
unawares
 entertained Angels (who at first did not discover themselves), as 
Abraham
 
Gen. 18.1;
 and 
Lot, Gen. 19.1.


3.
 That they should 
sympathize with,
 and shew compassion to those that are in bonds and adversity, remembring that they themselves also are 
in the body,
 and so subject to the like calamities; and are also members of the same mystical body of Christ, with other pious suffering-Christians, 
1 Cor. 12.26.


4.
 Having in the former part of the Chapter commended 
Charity, Hospi∣tality,
 and 
Compassion;
 in this verse he commends 
Chastity;
 shewing the means whereby they may keep themselves chast, which is by 
lawful Wedlock,
 which God allows to all 
sorts
 and 
degrees
 of persons, of what estate and calling soever they be 
[1 Tim. 4.1, 3.],
 and pronounces it an 
honou∣rable

 condition
 of life; but declares, that 
Whoremongers
 and 
Adulterers
 God will judg
.


5.
 He advises them to take heed of 
Covetousness,
 lest that vice corrupt their manners; and he prescribes 
contentation
 with their present condition, and such things as they have
, as a prime remedy against it. And to perswade them thereunto, he tells them, that God hath promised, That he will never leave or forsake those that trust in him. For though this promise was made to 
Joshua
 in particular 
[Jos. 1.5.];
 yet any of God's faithful ones may apply it to themselves; and whosoever trusteth in God, as 
Joshua
 did, and re∣poseth himself on his good Providence, shall find God to be with him, and that he will not fail or forsake him. So that having so gracious a promise, be∣lievers may boldly say as 
David
 said of himself, 
Psal. 118.6. The Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man can do unto me.
 From Ver. 
1,
 to 
7.


6.
 He commends to them the example of their 
Church-Rulers
 and 
In∣structors
 (some of whom it seems were dead); advising them to imitate them in the 
stedfastness
 of their faith, and so sets before them the 
holiness
 of their conversation, and the happy issue
 of it, 
viz.
 how after they had persevered in the faith to the end, they dyed happily in the Lord, with evident proofs of his love and favour. And he shews them, they may fetch a strong argument for their stedfastness in the faith, from the 
object
 of their faith, which is Jesus Christ, who remains still the 
same object
 of faith, the 
same means
 of salvation, the 
same foundation
 of his Church 
[1 Cor. 3.11.],
 the 
same
 in all his Offices, and the 
same
 in efficacy to all that believe in him, in all ages of the world, 
Rev. 13.8.
 And this being so, they had great reason to continue firm and constant in the faith of Christ, and to take heed of being carried away with new and strange do∣ctrines, which were very different from the Gospel. And he further tells them, that 'tis good and profitable for them, that their hearts should be established with the true doctrine of the 
grace
 and 
mercy
 of God to us in Christ (which gives true rest and quiet to the conscience), and not think that the mingling the observation of some of the legal ceremonies (as the distinction of meats, 
&c.
) with the Gospel, is the right way to get peace and establishment. For such carnal rites and observances, as the distinction of meats
, he shews hath nothing profited, as to 
righteousness
 and 
justification,
 those that have most busied themselves about them, and have walked most strictly in the observance of them. See 
Rom. 14.17. Col. 2.16.


And besides the unprofitableness of these legal rites, he shews they bring great 
damage
 to the observers of them. For thereby they deprive themselves of all benefit which they might otherwise receive from Christ. For, says he, (to speak in terms agreeable to the Old Testament) 
We Christians have an

 Altar,
 that is, a Sacrifice upon an Altar, 
viz.
 Jesus Christ, that was sacri∣ficed on the Altar of his Cross; of which sacrifice 
they have no right to eat,
 that is, have no part in it, who 
serve the Taber∣cle
, that is, addict themselves to the legal rites which were used in the Tabernacle, and belonged to the Ceremonial Law. The Tabernacle and Christ cannot stand together. If they will needs retain the 
shadow
 still, they have no right to the 
body.
 And as the 
High-Priest,
 who served in the Tabernacle, might not eat of the bodies of those beasts whose blood he brought once a year into the 
most holy place,
 to make atonement for sin 
(Lev. 16.6, 24, 27.],
 they being to be burnt with∣out the Camp
: so they, who since Christ was exhi∣bited, serve the Tabernacle, and adhere to the Leviti∣cal Ceremonies, cannot partake of Christ. For 
He,
 that he might fulfil the Type, and might 
sanctifie
 
his people with his own blood;
 that is, make a real atone∣ment and expiation of their sins by his own blood (which the 
High-Priest
 did only typically by the blood of beasts), and that he might confer grace upon them, suffered death without the gates of 
Jerusalem.
 And from Christ's going forth to suffer without the gates, and bearing his Cross, he deduces this 
tropological
 or practical use, that those that profess themselves Christi∣ans, should forsake the legal ceremonies, which were ad∣ministred within the Camp; and withdraw their hearts and affections from the world, and should go forth to Christ; that is, cleave fast to him and his doctrine, being ready to take up his Cross, and bear re∣proach for his sake. And he shews, their hearts should be the more disposed hereunto, because of the uncertainty and instability of all things here below. Here we have no abiding City, but we seek and expect one to come (if we be such as truly believe the Gospel), which hath firm foundations, and is eternal in heaven, see 
Heb. 11.10, 16.
 And seeing Christ not only bore his Cross, but offered up Himself a sacrifice for our sins, he exhorts these belie∣ving-
Hebrews,
 and all Christians, to offer up to God, 
in
 and 
through
 his me∣diation, the spiritual sacrifices
 of 
prayer
 and 
praise [1 Pet. 2.5.]
 and that continually
, all the days of their lives; which sacrifices are the calves or fruits
 of their lips 
[Hos. 14.3.],
 whereby they confess and magnifie his blessed Name
. And another sacrifice which they must offer up to God, and which he will graciously accept 
(in and through Christ)
 is, 
beneficence
 and 
liberality
 to those that are poor and necessitous [see 
Gal. 6.10. Phil. 4.18. Mat. 25.34,
 &c.]. 
From Ver. 7, to 17.


He begins now to draw to a conclusion of his Epistle; and having before, at 
v. 7,
 advised them to follow the example of their spiritual Guides and In∣structors that were dead, and to imitate them in the stedfastness of their faith, and holiness of their conversation; He exhorts them now to 
submit
 them∣selves, and to be 
obedient
 to their Pastors and Teachers that were living, in 
all things
 they should enjoin them according to the word of God. For he tells thew, Such as they, watch and take care for the good of their souls, as those

 that must give account to God of the people committed to their charge [see 
Ezek. 3.18, 19. 1 Tim. 4.16. Isa. 49.4.
] He advises them therefore to be obedient to 
their
 directions, that so 
they
 may do their work with joy and comfort, and not with 
sighing
 and complaining to God against the stubborn∣ness and stiff-neckedness of their people; for thereby (besides that they will dishearten and discourage their Ministers in their work) they will highly pro∣voke God against themselves for this their refractoriness. 
Ver. 18.


He entreats them to remember him in their prayers. For whatever calum∣nies 
false Teachers
 might spread about of him concerning his rejecting the 
Levitical
 Ceremonies, 
&c,
 he hoped that he did endea∣vour to keep a good conscience
; and was willing in all things to walk uprightly according to God's will and command. And he beseeches them the rather to pray for him, that the impediments of his coming to them being removed by their prayers, he might come the sooner, and they might the sooner enjoy the benefit of his presence and company. He concludes his Epistle with a solemn prayer; humbly beseeching God, the God of peace (who is both the Author and lover of peace and concord among Christians, 
Rom. 15.33.
 and 
16.20.
) who raised Jesus Christ from the dead, the great Shepherd of the sheep (whom he redeemed by his own blood, whereby he ratified and confirmed the ever∣lasting
 Covenant that shall never be altered), that he would please to frame and fit
 them for every good work, and would accomplish that in them which was yet wanting; and would work in them by his Spi∣rit what ever was pleasing in his sight. And this he begs for them through the m
it and mediation of Je∣sus Christ; to whom, as to true God
, he shews all honour and glory ought for ever to be ascribed. Last of all, he exhorts them to take kindly, and to make a right use of the exhortations and advice he had given them in this short Epistle, wherein he had handled many weighty matters in few words, and had not dilated and enlarged upon them as he might have done. He sends them the good news, That 
Timothy
 was now set at liberty, and gone forth, as 'tis probable, to preach the Gospel; with whom (if he shortly return'd unto him) he hoped he should come to them, being very desirous to see them. And so with salutations to them all, but especially to their Church-governours, not only from himself, but from several Christians of 
Italy
 (who often visited him at 
Rome
 in his imprisonment); and wishing unto them an encrease of grace, and an abundant sense of the love and favour of God in Christ, he shuts up his Epistle. 
From Ver. 18, to the end.








SECT. XII.


THE Apostle 
Peter
 being now at 
Babylon,
 seems about this time to have written his 
first Epistle
 to the Jews, dispersed through 
Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,
 and 
Bithy∣nia,
 of whom he had an especial charge, and of whose con∣version he had been a prime Instrument, 
Act.
 2.9. The occa∣sion of his writing to them, seems to be, that he might 
confirm them in the faith,
 that he might 
stir them up to constancy and cheerfulness under the afflictions and sufferings they met with for the profession of the Gospel;
 and that he might 
exhort them to adorn their profession by a holy walking in their several rela∣tions.


In the Epistle there are these three parts,




1. The 
Preface.


2. The 
Body
 of the Epistle.


3. The 
Conclusion.




1.
 THE 
Preface
 contains a description of the 
Penman
 (whose Apostolick Office is mentioned, to give the greater authority to his Epistle) and of the 
Parties
 to whom the Epistle is directed, 
viz.
 the 
Christian Jews
 scat∣tered through several Regions, whom he minds of their excellent spiritual con∣dition, to comfort them under their outward afflictions and tribulations. For by the judgment of charity, he judges them 
elect
 according to God's decree and gracious predestination, and effectually 
called,
 that they should be sanctified
 by the Spirit, should obey the truth, and should by faith be sprinkled with the blood of Christ, and so brought into a state of peace and recon∣ciliation with God. To all these he wishes an abun∣dant encrease of grace and peace. 
V. 1, 2.


2.
 He comes to the 
Body of the Epistle.
 And first, he begins with 
so∣lemn gratulation,
 humbly and heartily blessing
 God for all spiritual blessings which he vouchsafes to 
belie∣vers,
 who are by regeneration and the renewing of his Spirit, raised to a 
lively hope
 (by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead) of an 
inheritance
 which is incorruptible (the beauty and glory whereof can ne∣ver be stained, and which is safely kept for them in heaven, 
Col. 1.5.
); they being in the mean time kept and pr
served by the power of God through faith in Christ, against the temp∣tations of the 
Devil,
 the 
World,
 and the 
Flesh,
 so that they shall not fail

 of attaining that salvation
, which is prepared for them, and shall be openly given and bestowed on them at the last day. In the hopes of which salvation he shews, they had great matter of rejoycing, though now a little while
 (if need be, and God see it good for them) they be permitted to be in heaviness through manifold afflictions and temptations. And as their affli∣ctions are short, so are they necessary for the trial and purifying of their faith, that it may be more pure, like Gold that is tried. Yet there is this difference in this matter: 
Gold
 being never so well purified, will soon 
perish;
 but 
faith
 (which is more precious than gold), being purified by afflictions and trials, will 
abide,
 and will be highly esteemed, commended, and gloriously rewarded by Jesus Christ at his appearing; which bles∣sed Saviour, though they never knew by face, yet they dearly love; and though they have not seen him here on earth, yet they be∣lieve on him, and 
in so doing
 have so great and glorious matter of rejoy∣cing in their souls, that it cannot be expressed by themselves, nor sufficiently valued by others. Yea, by 
believing in him,
 they shall certainly receive
 the 
fruit, reward,
 and 
end
 of their faith, which is the salvation of their souls. This is that 
salvation
 (through faith in Christ incarnate) of which the 
ancient Prophets
 so diligently enquired and searched after a fuller knowledg of, who (being in∣spired by the Spirit of God) prophesied of 
that grace
 by which this salvation is offered, as 
that
 which should be more clearly revealed and manifested in the days of the Gospel. Yea, they diligently enquired to what 
time
 or 
season
 the Spirit of Christ that was in them, did point, when it moved them to prophesie and testifie so long beforehand 
His sufferings
 and 
humiliation,
 which were to pre∣cede his exaltation and glory. And they received this 
revelation,
 that the things of which they prophesied, were not to be fulfilled in their 
own,
 but in 
after-times.
 The manifestation of the 
Messias
 in the flesh, they themselves were not to see 
[Luk. 10.24.],
 nor his sufferings, nor his ascension. But these things (he tells them) are now reported and clearly manifested unto them by the Apostles, who were endued with an extraordinary measure of the Holy Spirit, sent down upon them on the day of Pentecost, 
Act. 2.
 And 
this way of salvation,
 as 'tis now clearly manifested, is a matter so ravish∣ing and wonderful, that the 
Holy Angels
 themselves delight to look
 into it. And if so, surely 
Believers
 ought highly to prize this Gospel-revelation, and stedfastly to adhere to it, whatever they may suffer for so doing. 
From Ver. 1, to 13.


2.
 He comes now to give them several 
exhortations
 to the practice of 
such duties of holiness
 as their 
excellent estate
 did oblige them unto. And,


1.
 He exhorts them to vigilancy, to 
gird up the loins of their mind
 (as servants that wait for their Lord), to be 
sober
 and 
watchful,
 and to 
hope
 stedfastly and perseveringly for 
that grace
 and 
salvation,
 for 
that per∣fection in holiness and glory,
 which God of his free grace will give them at the appearing of his Son Jesus Christ to judg the world. 
Ver. 13.




2.
 From their 
right of adoption,
 he exhorts them to be obedient to their heavenly Father, not fashioning themselves according to the instigation of their former lusts (which ruled in them in their ignorance), but to endeavour to answer their holy vocation: For there should be a conformity between the holy Lord, and all his Children
. 
Ver. 14, 15, 16.


3.
 He tells them, the 
Father
 (whom they call upon, and who will judg every man impartially according to his work) strictly requires holiness from all those that draw nigh to him, and call him Father. Therefore they ought to pass the time of their s
journing here in this world, in the fear of God, walking awfully as in his sight. 
Ver. 17.


4.
 He presses them to the study of holiness, by a 
motive
 taken from their 
Redemption.
 He tells them, they cannot be insensible that they were redeemed from their vain conversation, and former sinful course of life (to which they had been captivated by the example of their fathers, and by tradition), not with silver and gold (which yet will rans
m a King), but by the precious blood of Christ (whom the Pas
hal-Lamb typified), and who was 
from eternity
 fore-ordained unto the Office of the 
Mediator,
 though he was not manifested in the fl
sh till th se 
last days,
 and that with a special respect to the good and benefit of those lost sheep of the house of 
Israel
 who trust in God and firmly expect his pardoning mercy in and through his Son's Media∣tion: Ʋnto which they are the more encouraged seeing the Father is so fully satisfied with the ransom paid by his Son, that he hath raised him from the dead▪ and gloriously exalted him to his right hand in Heaven; upon which account their faith may now safely and comfortably rest on God
, as a reconciled Father to all that truly believe in him 
in
 and 
through
 his Son Jesus Christ. 
From Ver. 18, to 22.


5.
 He comes now to exhort them to 
brotherly love:
 That seeing by the power of Christ's Spirit enabling them to obey the Gospel, they had got their inward corruptions of 
pride
 and 
self-love,
 so far purged out, as to attain unto s
me degrees of sincere affection to the people of God; therefore they sh
uld labour to grow in 
that grace,
 and to have such a love to them, as is not only 
fervent,
 but floweth from a sincere desire of their good, and doth prove it s
lf to be 
such,
 by real effects. 
Ver. 22.


6.
 Seeing they were regenerate, and born again, as he charitably judged; and had a 
new life
 and 
nature
 wrought in them, not by so fading a cause or principle as 
that
 which is the instrument of producing their natural sub∣stance; but by the 
word
 of God, which (in its effects upon the regenerate) liveth and abideth for ever: therefore the excellency of their 
new nature,
 and permanency of their spiritual estate, should move them to walk suitably to it; and particularly, to live in love with the rest of the people of God, who are children also of their heavenly Father. 
Ver. 23.


Lastly, He sets before them the excellency of their 
spiritual estate,
 by com∣paring the same with the 
best estate
 of men naturally considered, with all their ornaments of 
Wit, Wealth,
 and 
Honour,
 wherein they use to glory, which are all (to allude to that of the Prophet 
Esay,
 ch. 
40.
 v. 
6.
) like to the withering grass or fading flowers; but the 
word
 of the Lord (which by the Gospel is preached to them), as to its 
truth,
 and as to its 
effects
 upon the regenerate, abides for ever; and consequently so doth 
their estate
 who are begotten again by it. 
Ver. 24, 25.


 Se
ing therefore they were 
born again,
 they should lay aside all malice, and guile, and hypocrisie, and envy, and detraction, which are so contrary to 
brotherly love
 (before prest as an evidence of their regeneration), and as

 
new-born babes,
 with great desire and appetite should receive the sound do∣ctrine of the Gospel, that 
spiritual, rational
, 
sincere, pure milk
 (free from all error; which can deceive no man, but is most convenient for the feeding of the soul), that they may make progress and growth in piety, and advance to 
a higher pitch of Christianity thereby. And this, he is confident, they will do, if they have tasted, and real
y perceived and felt in their minds, by the preaching of the Gospel, the tender love of Christ to poor sinners. To whom, says he, 
coming by faith
, as to a 
living-stone
 (that is, a lively and firm, not a dead foundation; having 
life in himself
 essentially
, and communicating life 
spiritual
 and 
eternal
 to every soul that effectually closes with Him; 
chosen of God,
 and in his eyes precious and honourable, though disallowed and rejected of the carnal Jews and their Rulers), 
be ye
 as 
lively stones,
 built up a spiritual House or Church; and an holy 
Priesthood,
 to offer up (not typical or expiatory, but) gratulatory sacrifices, viz. 
Prayers
 and 
Praises
 unto God, which are sacrifices very acceptable to him, through the intercession of his Son. Wherefore the Scripture saith
, 
Isa. 28.16.
 (taking the words not in the 
li∣teral,
 but the 
sublime
 sense) Christ is laid in the Church as the 
foundation,
 or 
chief corner-stone
 thereof (which supports and holds the Edifice toge∣ther), being chosen of God, and very precious in his sight, and was first to be manifested in 
Sion
, or the Church of the Jews [
that from Sion might go forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusa∣lem,
 Esa. 
2.3.
 Mic. 
4.2.
], from whom the news of him was to go forth to the rest of the world. And they might assure themselves, that he that truly believes in 
Him,
 shall not be ashamed, or confounded, or deceived in his expectation. To them therefore that believe in Him, he shews Christ is very 
precious
, or an ho∣nour, and they have a very high esteem of him. But as for others who slight and neglect him, they should con∣sider, that 
that stone
 whom the 
Rulers
 of his time s
t at nought, is now highly exalted by the Father (ac∣cording to the 
Psalmist
's words, 
Psal. 118.22.
), to be the glorious 
Head
 
of the Church;
 but he will prove a 
stone
 at which 
those persons
 will stumble
 to their hurt; and a 
Rock,
 against whi
h 
they
 will split to their utter confusion; whose blind and carnal hearts do still find out something in the Gospel whence they take oc∣casion to quarrel at this Saviour, and so they will bring ruin upon themselves, as a mad man does that dashes himself against a stone in his way; God having in his just Decree appointed, That destruction and eternal per∣dition should be the punishment of such obstinate and disobedient persons. But though this be the woful state of those that slight Christ; yet he shews, 
true believers
 are highly blessed: for to them those 
honourable titles
 be∣long, and may justly be given, which the Lord vouch∣safed of old unto the visible Church of the Jews, 
Exod. 9.6.
 and 
Deut. 7.6, 7. viz.
 they are, 
1. A chosen genera∣tion,
 by effectual vocation separated from the world for his service. 
2.
 A 
Royal.
 
Priesthood;
 being Kings

 and Priests unto God, 
Rev. 1.6,
 and having a new nature in some mea∣sure resembling the Divine Nature, 
2 Pet. 1.4;
 being 
co-heirs with Christ,
 Rom. 
8.17;
 of a Kingdom that canvot be moved. 
Heb. 12.28;
 and being 
Priests
 to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 
3.
 A 
holy Nation,
 for they were all 
foederally
 holy: but the true b
lievers among them were endued with true sanctification. 
4.
 A 
peculiar people;
 that is, a people that Christ had purchas
d to hims lf by his own blood; and all for this end, that th
y might publish the 
Wisd
m, Power, Justice, Grace,
 and 
Mercy
 of 
Him,
 who called them out of darkness to light; and out of a state of sin, ignorance, and wrath, to a state of holin
ss, and the true know∣ledg of God, and of favour and reconciliation with him. So that he might say, that 
Hos
a
's prophecy, 
chap. 2.28
 con
erning the restoring the Jewish Nation to the favour of God again, after their rejection for a time, had now a begun-accomplishment in them. 
From Ver. 1, to 11.


He further exhorts them, that remembring they were but 
pilgrims
 and 
strangers
 here in this world, they should abstain from fulfil ing those fl
shly lusts which warr against▪ and are directly oppos
te to the good of their s
uls, 
Rom. 7.23.
 And that their conversation sh
uld be so holy and hon
st among the 
Gentiles
 (among whom they lived) that whereas they were r
ady to reproach them as 
evil-doers,
 they might by their good works whi h they shall behold, be brought to change their minds concerning them▪ and so their good conversation might be a preparative to their conversion, and occasion them to praise and glorifie God for it, when it shall please him to visit them by his Grace, and to draw them by his Gospel to beli
ve in his Son 
[Luc. 19.44.] Ver. 11, 12.


1.
 He comes now to shew them how they should carry thems lves with re∣spect and submission to any form of lawful Government established in the se∣veral Countreys where they were scattered whether the s
me were ex
s d by a 
King,
 or other Governours; which several 
forms
 of Civil Government, he calleth an 
human Ordinance.
 For though all Power in general is the Or∣dinance of God; yet the particular 
form
 of Government is not determined by him, but left to the choice of human prudence directed by the general rules of the word. And he tells them, they must submit to the Magistracy th y are under, 
for the Lord's sake;
 that is that they may bring honour to God thereby▪ who hath enjoined them that subjection. 
2.
 Because those M
gistrates are appointed by God, and sent by him, that th
y may punish and suppr
ss 
evil doers,
 and commend, praise, and encourage those that 
do well.
 Rom. 
13.3, 4, 5.
 For this, he tells them is the will of God, that 
by well-doing
 they should confute the calumnies of unreasonable men, who out of ignorance re∣proach Christianity. But it may be some might obj
ct, 
Are not Christians free?
 He answers, th
y are; y
t so, as they are obliged to carry themselves as those that are made free 
by Christ
 from the dominion of sin, but not from a due subjection to lawful Magistrates; and therefore must not use their Chri∣stian liberty as a cloak or covering to any wickedn
ss or maliciousness whatso∣ever; but as the true servants of God, must make conscience of all duties re∣quired of them, both towards God and man. And that they may perform this▪ he enjoins them to despise no man, but to give that respect to all men which is due to them, according to the station wherein God hath set them; That they bear an especial love to those who are of the houshold of faith; and, That they fear God, and honour the King. 
From Ver. 13, to 18.


In the n
xt place he exhorts 
servants
 to give subjection and obedience to their own 
Masters,
 fearing to give them any just occasion of offence; and that they carry themselves so, not only to those who are 
good
 and 
gentle,
 but to

 those also who are 
austere
 and 
morose.
 For this is acceptable to God, if any man. upon account that he may please him, patiently suffers wrongs and in∣juries. But what great matter is it, says he, if men endure submissively those punishments which their own faults have justly brought upon them? But when they have done no 
ill,
 and are then abused and contumeliously used, if this be born patiently and humbly, this is that Christian vertue of meekness which God will certainly reward: and this, he tells them, is 
that
 which all Christians are called unto, and whereof Christ himself hath given us an eminent example to be imitated by us; who though he was perfectly 
innocent,
 yet he met with many bitter contumelies from men; but being reviled, he reviled not again; and when th
y put him to death, he neither threaten'd nor menac'd; but, praying for his persecutors, committed himself and his cause to God, who judgeth righteously. And many excellent benefits accrue to us by his suffer∣ings. For, 
1.
 He bare the punishment of our sins in his 
human nature
 on the Cross, and so made expiation 
f them. 
2.
 By his death he purchased ver∣tue for the sl
ying of sin in us, and for the quickning of us to the duties of holiness; thae we being dead unto sin, might live unto righteousness. And therefore Christian-servants should consider not so much 
what
 they suffer for Christ, as the 
benefits
 they receive by him. For though they may receive stripes and wounds unjustly from their Masters in their bodies; yet let them remember what healing
 they have for their souls by the wounds
 and stripes of Christ. Lastly, He remembers them of the woful estate they were in b
fore their conversion; wandring like 
straying sheep,
 in ignorance and sinful ways; but now by the powerful grace of Christ they were brought home to 
Him
 the good Shepherd, and to his Fold; who will take care for the salvation of their souls, though their bodies and outward man may oftentimes here meet with hard usage from their unjust Ma∣sters. 
From Ver. 18, to the end.


He now gives Precepts to 
Wives,
 directing them how they should carry 
 themselves towards their 
Husbands,
 if it should so happen that they should be 
unbelievers.
 He enjoins thew to carry themselves with so winning a kindness and humility towards them, that if they be not converted to Christianity by the Gospel preached to them, they may by the sweet, obliging, and dutiful be∣haviour of their Wives (which they see the Christian Religion instructs them in) be without any further preaching wrought on, and converted to the faith; especially they seeing nothing but chastity and holiness, joined with the fear of God, and reverence towards themselves, shining in the conversation of their Wives. And for their Attire, he enjoyns they should not be too curious in a∣dorning their outward persons with plaited hair, gold chains, or gay clothes; but should especially take care of their hearts and spirits, that those be adorned with the graces of 
meekness
 and 
quietness
 (which ornaments will not wax old as the others do), and are in the sight of God hims
lf, of high value and esteem. For after this manner, he tells them, 
viz.
 with outward modest attire, and inward meekness, the holy women of ancient times (that were eminent for their piety and faith in God), did set out themselves, living in obedience to their own Husbands. He instances in 
Sarah,
 who eminently testified her obedience to 
Abraham
 her Husband, calling him by a title of 
honour,
 not of equality. To whom, he tells them, they will shew themselves to be like, as Children to a Mother, if they labour to discharge a good conscience in all the duties required of them; and if they be not by any fear, or terror, or oppo∣sition of their unbelieving Husbands, or any others, driven out of the way of their duty. 
From Ver. 1, to 7.


In the next place, he exhorts 
believing Husbands
 to dwell with their 
be∣lieving Wives
 as 
men of knowledg
 (and as such as are well acquainted with their duty), carrying themselves 
wisely
 and 
discreetly
 towards them, gi∣ving

 them meet and due respect; taking care of them, and bearing with them in their weaknesses
, and behaving themselves with tenderness towards them, as being 
fellow-heirs
 of eternal life (which is freely given of grace to all true believers, whether male or female); that so, through 
brawling
 and 
strife,
 their prayers and other religious exercises be not hindred. 
Ver. 7.


He comes now to exhort all Christians in general, to 
concord
 and unity of judgment and affection among themselves, to 
sympathy
 and a fellow-feeling of one anothers afflictions, to 
brotherly love,
 to 
mercifulness,
 to 
affability,
 to 
courtesie,
 to 
patience,
 not rendring evil for evil, or railing for railing, unto them that injure them; but contrariwise, blessing and praying for them, and wishing all good unto them. And he urges his exhortation with these reasons: 
1.
 Because Christians are called to the practise of these Vertues, especially Pa∣tience; that they may, by the exercise of them, attain the glorious inheri∣tance of everlasting bliss and happiness. 
2.
 Because to be patient, and peacea∣ble, and watchful over their tongues, is the best way to make their lives com∣f
rtable. 
3.
 'Tis the best way to have the watchful Providence of God over them for 
good,
 and to have their 
prayers heard;
 whereas the face of God is against them that do evil, and he sets himself as an enemy against them, according to 
Psal. 34.12, 13, 14, 15. 4.
 'Tis the probablest way to scape trouble and harm from evil men, to shew themselves constant pursuers of that which is good. But if (as sometimes it will fall out) they do suffer for righ∣teousness sake, they should count this no other than a blessing; and therefore whatsoever danger they are threatned with by the power of their persecutors, they should not be afraid or disturbed at it, but should 
sanctifie the Lord
 in that dispensation towards them 
[Isa. 8.12, 13.],
 and should furnish them∣selves with such a clear knowledg of the truth of the Gospel, that when they are asked, they may be able to shew the grounds and reasons of the 
faith
 they profess, and consequently of the hope of eternal life wrought in them thereby; and that with 
meekness
 of spirit, and a holy fear of miscarrying in giving their testimony. Lastly, They should labour to get their Consciences cleared from all guilt, by faith in the blood of Christ, and so guided by the light of his word, that they that accuse them as 
Malefactors,
 may be con∣vinc'd that their lives are very honest and inoffensive, being ordered accor∣ding to Christ's doctrine and command. But if it please God to permit them to suffer for well-doing, they should remember, there is no matter of sorrow in 
that;
 but if a man, to avoid suffering, fall into sin, and then suffer for it, they should consider, that 
that
 will be a sad thing indeed, without any allay or matter of comfort to him. And seeing the 
innocent Son of God,
 who was perfectly righteous, dyed for 
our
 sins (who are unrigh∣teous) that he might reconcile
 us (who were ene∣mies) unto God, being put to death in his 
huma∣nity
, but raised up again by the power of his 
Spi∣rit,
 or 
Godhead;
 it doth therefore well become his fol∣lowers (for the purchasing of whose redemption he dyed) to undergo those sufferings chearfully for his sake, which they meet with in following their duty to him. And since there are many souls of men and wo∣men to whom Christ did once, by his Spirit, in the Ministry of 
Noah,
 and other of his servants, make known the way to life and salvation
, who are now imprisoned
 in Hell for evermore, because of their slighting so much patience

 as the Lord did exercise towards them, especially during the time of 
Noah
's preparing the Ark, wherein a few only escaped destruction (the water bear∣ing up the Ark); therefore it doth concern those who have the Gospel more clearly preached to them, to give obedience thereunto, whatever they may suffer for it. And since 
Believers
 have a spiritual priviledg answering to the 
Ark,
 sealing their safety from the deluge of God's wrath, namely, 
their Baptism
 (by which we mean not the 
external
 part of it alone, which can only re∣move the filth of the body; but the 
internal,
 viz. the application of Christ's blood to the conscience, which thereupon comfortably answers and witness
s for them before God, and answers all challenges to the contrary upon this ground, that 
our Surety
 is absolved from our debt which he took on himself, whereof his 
Resurrection
 is an evidence); therefore they have no reason to f
int in doing their duty, or to fear in the midst of their sufferings. And lastly, Since their 
Mediator
 and 
Head
 is gone in their 
nature
 and 
name
 to possess Hea∣ven, since he is in highest dignity and power with God the Father, since he hath all the Heavenly Host of Angels at his command, therefore none of his followers need fear 
suffering
 in following their duty to him. 
From Ver. 8, to the end.


He n
w returns to his former argument,
 to press them to the study of 
ho∣liness.
 He tells them, that forasmuch as Christ hath suffered for the 
expia∣tion
 of our sins 
in his human nature,
 they ought therefore to arm them∣selves with the same mind, and t
 be ready t
 imitate him in the mortify∣ing of the flesh. For he that hath mortified
 his 
corrupt nature
 (in 
imitation
 of Christ's dying for our sins, and by 
grace
 received from him), that person hath ceased from 
living unto sin,
 or serving sin any longer, 
Rom. 6.7.
 And surely he doth arm himself with this consideration, That he ought not to give any of the re∣maining part of his time (that he is to live in this mortal life) to the obedience of those lusts, or to com∣ply with those sinful appetites that ordinarily are stir∣ring in men, but must endeavour in all things to live according to the will of God. And he tells them, they
 had spent too much of their time pa
t in the days of their ignorance and unregenera
y, in the s
rvice of their lusts, wallowing in all sorts of vilen ss against both Tables of the Law, after the manner, and according to the lusts of the 
Heathens
 among whom they were scattered; and 'twas now more than time
 to break off that course, and to consecrate the remainder of their days to the practise of holiness. And th
ugh th
se Hea∣then unbelievers may think strange, and be offended at their abstaining from their form
r vices, and that they run not headlong with them into all dissoluteness and debauchery, and may reproach them and their Religion upon that account; yet they ought not to be thereby moved; for those prophane persons shall be brought (will they, nill they) to give an account to Christ of these their reproaches, who shall judg
 the quick and dead. For, for this cause was the 
Gospel
 preached (
viz.
 by 
Noah, 2
 Pet. 
2.5.
) to the men of the old world, who are now dead, that those among them might be
 
judged
 and 
condemned
 by Christ; who notwithstanding the light thereof, walked according to 
men in

 the flesh,
 being led away by their own carnal lusts; and that those of them might 
live,
 and be eternally happy, who walked 
according to God in the spirit,
 that is, according to the 
will of God,
 being led and guided by his holy Spirit. Therefore Christ will judg not only these who shall be found alive at his coming, but the dead also. 
From Ver. 1, to 7.


Another argument whereby he presses the study of holiness, is, because 
the end of all things was at hand;
 that is, the end of the 
Jewish State
 and 
Polity.
 For that great fatal destruction threatned to the obdurate 
Jews,
 and often mentioned by Christ and his Apostles, drew nigh; see 
Mat. 24. Jam. 5.3, 9.
 Therefore he exhorts them, 
1.
 To be sober, and moderate, and to be much in prayer with God; and to add to their prayers watchfulness, that 
that day
 do not surprize them unawares. 
2.
 He presseth them to exercise a 
fer∣vent love
 and charity one towards another, as the 
sum
 and chief of all the duties we owe to our Neighbour: For 
Love
 or 
Charity,
 he tells them, will cover a multitude of sins and failings among Christians 
[Prov. 10.12.],
 and will hide them from the knowledg of the prophane. 
3.
 They should be cheer∣fully hospitable to their poor brethren, without grudging or murmuring at the charge. 
4.
 They should endeavour rightly to employ their spiritual gifts for the good of others, which they had received according to their respective places in the Church, as counting themselves stewards of those various gifts bestowed on them through the free grace and favour of God. He instances in two, 
1. Preaching of the word;
 shewing, that he that teacheth and instructeth the people, ought to do it with that uprightness and reverence, as becomes one that is a steward or dispenser of the Oracles of God. 
2. Ministration to the poor;
 which office the Deacons were faithfully to discharge; and private Christians were also to exercise their liberality according to the ability God had given them; that in the right use of all these gifts, God might receive glory (both by the 
Steward
 and 
dispenser
 of them, and by those also who are 
profited
 by them) through Jesus Christ, in whose 
strength
 only these gifts are rightly employed 
[Joh. 15.5.],
 and through whose merits and me∣diation, the 
intention
 to glorifie God by them is accepted 
[Heb. 13.5.];
 to whom, as to God blessed for ever, all honour and dominion ought for ever to be ascribed. 
From Ver. 7, to 12.


Moreover, he exhorts them not to be troubled or amazed at the sharpest persecutions or hottest trials they should meet with for the sake of Christ. For considering that in 
that furnace
 their graces will be tried, and their corrup∣tions purged away, they should count it matter of joy to them, because hereby they are made partakers of the afflictions appointed for the members of Christ, and are made like unto him in suffering, and shall share with him in his glory, and have matter of incomparable exultation and joy at his second com∣ing. In the mean time, if they be reproached for the Name of Christ, and for their Christian profession, they should esteem it the happiest thing that could befall them. For the glorious 
Spirit
 of God delighteth with his comfortable and supporting-operations, to reside in the hearts of such as suffer for righ∣teousness sake; which blessed Spirit, though he be blasphemed by persecutors, yet he is glorified by those who boldly confess the truth, which he teacheth and imparts unto them. But he advises them by all means to be careful, that not any of them suffer as an 
evil-doer
 in any kind; but if he suffer for Christ's sake, or because he is a Christian, he shews that he ought to rejoyce in it, and to glorifie God, who hath made him 
willing,
 and hath enabled him to suffer in so good a cause, and hath thereby honoured him with a certain degree of Martyrdom. He tells them, the time is at hand when the Christians must expect great sufferings. 
Judgment
 will begin at the House and Family of God, for the correction and trial of his own children. And if God thus begin with his own children, who embrace the Gospel of his

 Son, what a dreadful end
 will he make with those that wilfully reject and despise it? And if the 
righ∣teous
 in this life do smart for their sins, and meet with so many afflictions, that they cannot but with great difficulty (considering their own weakness) enter into the Kingdom of God. Surely the 
wicked,
 who give up themselves to work iniquity with greediness, shall be wonderfully punished, sometimes here in this life, but most certainly hereafter: neither shall they find any place to shelter themselves from the everlasting wrath of God. Therefore there is no reason why the 
godly,
 to shun sufferings from them, should join with them in their evil ways, seeing their 
end
 will be so terrible. From all which he inferrs, that those who 
suffer according to the will of God,
 should hold on in their duty, and commit the keeping of themselves to him, exercising faith on his 
Omnipotence,
 who created the World, and so is able to preserve them from the fury and rage of men, if he please; and on his 
Faithfulness,
 who will certainly perform all his promises to every faithful servant of his, and therefore will certainly preserve them, if it be best for them; and if he do not, he will make their very sufferings tend to the enhaunsement and encrease of their glory. 
From Ver. 12, to the end.


He now comes to exhort the 
Presbyters,
 the 
Pastors,
 and 
Spiritual Guides
 
 of the Church, to discharge their duty faithfully in feeding the flock of God which was among them. And that he may press this exhortation the more effectually upon them, he tells them, he himself was an 
Elder
, and one that had been a witness of the suf∣ferings
 of Christ 
[Mat. 26.37. Mat. 27.29. Act. 3.15.],
 and hoped to be a partaker
 of that glory which should hereafter be revealed and communicated to all true and sincere Pastors at Christ's second coming. He presses them therefore to feed the Lord's people with his 
truth,
 and to rule them according to his 
discipline
 (both which may be comprehended in the word 
), and that they diligently attend the oversight of their flocks; not doing it by constraint, like 
Mercenaries;
 nor meerly for filthy lu∣cre's sake; but with a free and ready mind, designing faithfully to serve their Lord and Master, and to profit his people thereby; and further, that they should not impiously 
lord it over the Church
 (which is God's 
heritage
 and peculiar lot, chosen out of the common multitude for his own propriety), buc be ensamples to the flock in all holy walking; that when the 
chief Shepherd
 shall appear, they may receive an eminent degree of bliss, a never-fading Crown of Glory. 
From Ver. 1, to 5.


He then points out the duties of the flock, whom he calls the 
younger,
 either because they were generally younger in years than their 
spiritual guides,
 or because they ought to shew that reverence and obedience to them which is suitable in 
young ones
 towards their 
elders.
 He exhorts those 
younger ones
 to submit themselves to the guidance of their 
Elders
 and 
Teachers,
 enjoining and commanding them things 
right
 and 
just
 in the name of God. Next, as 
fellow-members
 in the Church, he enjoins them 
mutual subjection
 one to another, in all duties of 
love,
 and particularly in receiving 
private admoni∣tions.
 And in order hereunto, he advises them to adorn themselves with 
hu∣mility,
 and a mean and low esteem of themselves. For, as 
Solomon
 saith, Prov. 
3.24,
 
God opposeth himself against them that are high and haughty, and manifesteth his grace and favour to them that are humble.
 He advises them therefore to submit themselves with humility of mind to the guidance of God, and the directions of 
those
 he hath set over them, remem∣bring his Almighty Power, and how easily he can crush them, if they be 
dis∣obedient;


 but if they be obedient, they should consider, that he is able to exalt them, and will certainly do it, either in this life (if he see it g 
d for them), or at the day of judgment. And if th
y walked in ways of obedi∣dience to him, they need not be disquieted at any difficulties that they may meet with; but should, with serenity of mind, cast 
all their cares
 on him; for they might assure themselves, he hath a peculiar care of them, and of what concerns them, that no hurt shall accrue unto them. 
From Ver. 5, to 8.


He further exhorts them, to be 
sober,
 and 
vigilant,
 and 
stedfast,
 in ad∣hering to the truth, and the profession of the faith of Christ; and so to re∣sist the 
Devil
 and his 
temptations
 (who is our cruel and restless Enemy), especially 
those
 solliciting them to Apostacy by reason of their sufferings; re∣membring, they had all the rest of the Lord's people in the world for their 
fellow-soldiers
 in this warfare, who have their several shares of affliction to suffer, and their several measures of hardship to endure, as well as they. And therefore they should not expect a better condition in the world than the rest of their brethren. 
Ver. 8.9.


In conclusion, He solemnly prays for these suffering-Christians▪ that God (who is the Author of all Grace, and is freely ready to communicate the same to all humble and penitent sinners; and who hath call'd them, by the Gospel, to the possession of his everlasting glory through the merits and mediation of his Son) would please, after they have suffered a little while here in this world, to per∣fect the work of grace he hath begun in them, to establish, and strengthen, and settle them in the 
truth,
 that their union with Christ 
the Foundation,
 might be made more firm and strong. To this infinitely gracious God he desires glory and dominion should be for ever ascribed. 
Ver. 10, 11.


He tells them, he had writtten this short Epistle to them (by 
Silvanus,
 whom he took for a very faithful friend unto them), wherein he had exhorted them to their duty, and had born his testimony to the 
Gospel;
 assuring them, that 
that
 contains the 
true Doctrine of Salvation,
 and a true manifestation of God's grace to all penitent sinners who by faith lay hold on Christ: Which Doctrine, as they had been taught, they did hitherto profess, and stand fast in
; and they would do well to 
do so
 to the end. For 'tis a Doctrine that would deceive none that embrace it. He sends them salutations from the Christians at 
Babylon
, whom the Lord had chosen out of the world to be a Church to himself, and to share with others of his people in spiritual and eter∣nal mercies. He salutes them also from 
Mark,
 whom (being instructed by him in the Gospel) he calls 
his Son.
 Lastly, He exhorts them to express their hearty affe∣ction one to another by the 
kiss of Charity
 (which was the ordinary sign thereof in those times and those Countreys), and so wishing peace and all manner of prosperity to all among them that were converted to Christ, and professed faith in him, he shuts up his Epistle. 
From Ver. 12, to the end.








SECT. XIII.


THE Apostle 
Peter,
 not long after this, seems to have re∣ceiv'd a revelation from the Lord of his approaching de∣parture out of this life; and therefore writes this his second Epistle to the dispersed 
Jews,
 intimating the same unto them, 
Chap.
 1.14. Our Saviour had long before given him an inti∣mation that he should dye a 
Martyr,
 Joh. 21.18, 19. 
Verily I say unto thee, when thou wast young thou girdedst thy self, and walkedst whither thou wouldst; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldst not. This he spake, signifying by what death he should glorifie God.
 Our Saviour further told him, That this should be before 
His coming in judgment against Je∣rusalem,
 which 
John
 should live to see, 
Joh.
 21. v. 22. It seems the Apostle was now more particularly warn'd thereof, and ac∣cordingly sends this his Epistle as his 
last farewel
 to the believing-Jews scattered at that time through many Nations. And this is the last we find in the Scripture of this 
great Apostle.


In the Epistle there are these three parts,




1. The 
Preface.


2. The 
Body
 of the Epistle.


3. The 
Conclusion.




1.
 THE 
Preface;
 which shews us to whom the Epistle is directed, 
viz.
 to the 
believing-Jews
 scattered up and down in the 
Roman
 Empire, who had obtained 
like precious faith,
 for 
quality
 and 
nature,
 with the Apostle himself, and which interessed 
them all
 in the same precious promises and priviledges which he himself had interest in, and whose 
object
 is the 
righteousness of Christ
 our God and Saviour. To 
all these
 he heartily wishes an 
abundance of grace,
 and of 
that peace
 which does accompany it, together with all kind of prosperity; and that, in order hereunto, they may daily grow up in larger measures of the 
knowledg
 of God, and of Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. 
Ver. 1, 2.


2.
 He comes to the 
Body of the Epistle,
 wherein he expresses the ground of his confidence, that God would 
encrease grace in them,


 because
 he had of his own goodness, and the free ex∣ercise of his divine power, afforded them all the helps needful for the attaining of 
eternal life
 hereafter, and for the making them truly 
pious
 here; having brought them to a saving-knowledg of Christ▪ who had called them 
by his own glory and vertue
, that is, by his Gospel [which is the great power of God, 
Rom, 1.16.],
 to 
glory
 and eternal felicity, as the 
end;
 and to the practise of vertue (that is, of grace and holiness), as the 
means.
 By which Saviour
 he tells them, are given unto us 
great
 and 
precious promises,
 as of justifica∣tion, sanctification, and eternal life. The fulfilling of which promises to believers, doth make them 
partakers
 (not of the infinite Essence of God, which can neither be divided nor communicated to any crea∣ture; but) of such 
heavenly qualities
 as make them in some measure to resemble their heavenly Father, they having escaped hereby the corrupt man∣ners and debauchedness whi
h the generality of the world run into, by fol∣lowing the sinful inclinations and lusts of their own hearts. And this same thing
, that they have receeved such great benefits from God, sh
uld mind and excite them to give all diligence to 
grow in grace,
 and to 
add one ver∣tue to another;
 particularly to 
faith
 to add the Chri∣stian vertue of 
fortitude
 or courage; to Christian-
courage,
 a greater measure of 
knowledg;
 to knowledg, 
temperance;
 to that, 
patience;
 to that, 
godliness,
 or religiousness (which consists in a due care rightly to worship God); to 
that,
 brotherly 
kindness,
 and an especial 
love
 to the 
houshold of faith;
 and to that 
ch
ri
y,
 or 
good-will
 to all sorts of persons. He tells them, that if these 
vertues
 and 
graces
 be in them (especially in any eminent degree), they will produce excellent fruits and effects
; so that their knowledg of Christ and the Gospel, will neither be un∣profitable to themselves, nor useless to others. But that Christian-prof
ssor who lacks these graces, whatever il∣luminaeion he may pretend to, is indeed 
blind
 as to 
spirituals,
 and cannot have any true sight or knowledg of the things of the other life, and hath forgotten (as it seems) the purification
 of himself from his for∣mer sins, which he professed and obliged himself to in his 
Baptism.
 He exhorts them therefore earnestly to en∣deavour after these graces and vertues, that so they may prove and demon∣strate themselves to be effectually 
called
 and 
elected,
 and may make their 
cal∣ling
 and 
election
 sure and evident to themselves, and by this means they shall be kept from apostasie, and a total and final falling away; and God will with a larger and more copious affection, receive them into the everlasting king∣dom of his Son, and eternal life will (as it were) more largely open it self to receive them, and they shall have the sense and first-fruits of it in a more abundant measure. And seeing the hazzard of negligence, and the advantage of diligence, was so great, therefore he tells them, he would not be negligent to stir them to their duty, and to mind them of these things, though many of them he apprehended were both discerning and solid Christians. And he judged it meet so to do, whilst he was in the tabernacle of this body, knowing that shortly he must end his life by a glorious Martyrdom, as Christ had told him, 
Joh. 21.18, 19.
 And this exhortation which he had written, would be pro∣fitable to mind them of their duty after his departure. 
From Ver. 3, to 16.


He comes now to exhort them to constancy in the faith, and stedfastly to adhere to the doctrine taught by himself and the other Apostles. And to assure them of the truth and certainty thereof, he tells them, that himself and his

 fellow-Apostles had not followed 
artificially-devised fables,
 when they made known and testified unto them the 
first coming
 of Christ in the flesh, and how by his 
Doctrine
 and 
Miracles
 he powerfully shewed▪ himself to be the true promised Messias. For 
himself, James,
 and 
John,
 had been with him in his transfiguration on 
Mount Tabor
 
Mat. 17,
 and had there seen the Majesty that was then instated on him, and heard the voice that came from the 
excel∣lent Glory
 (that is, from the Majesty of God the Fa∣ther out of the shining-Cloud), saying, 
This is my be∣loved Son in whom I am well pleased.
 But besides this, he tells them they had the Prophecies of the Old Testament, which fore-told these very things concerning the 
Messiah,
 which have been fulfill'd and accomplished in the Person of 
Jesus
 of 
Nazareth;
 which prophecies were a 
more sure
 word to them than the voice from Heaven. Not that there was any uncer∣tainty in the Lord's voice uttered from Heaven, but because a 
transient voice
 is more easily mistaken or forgotten, than a standing authentick Record. There∣fore seeing the 
written word
 was so sure a ground for their faith to rest upon, they did well to 
attend unto it,
 as to a light that shined in the 
dark
 and 
shadowy
 time of the Old Testament [see 
Rom. 13. v. 12.
]. And they should continue so to do, till
 by considering those an∣cient prophecies, and comparing them with what Christ hath really 
done
 and 
suffer'd,
 they might find the 
day dawning upon them,
 and the 
morning-star arising in their hearts,
 that is, the 
Spirit
 of Christ himself (who is the 
Sun of Righteousness,
 and the 
Morning-star
 of the Church, 
Rev. 22.16.
), so enlightning their minds, and so fully convincing their con∣sciences, that no more doubts or scruples should be left in them concerning this great Truth attested by the 
voice from Heaven,
 and confirmed by the writings of the Prophets 
[Acts 10.43.],
 namely, that 
Jesus is true Messias, the Son of God.
 This also he shews, they must hold as a 
first principle,
 and a thing especially to be believed, 
That none of the writings of the Prophets were of any private impulse
 
or incitation,
 or sprang meerly out of their own brains; neither did 
prophecy
 come upon them 
according to the will of man;
 that is, they did not prophesie 
when
 they would, or 
what
 they would [see 
2 King. 4.27.
], but they spake by the instinct and impulse of the Holy Ghost. 
From Ver. 16, to the end.


He now forewarns them of 
false Teachers
, and 
Heretical Seducers
 that should arise among them. He tells them, that as there were 
true
 Pro∣phets among the people of 
Israel
 of old (who spake by the instinct and impulse of the Spirit of God); so there were some also 
false,
 and such as were meer 
Cheats
 and 
Deceivers,
 who slily crept in: And thus they must expect it will be with them now; there will arise some 
false Teachers
 among them, who

 will privily bring in 
damnable Heresies,
 and by their false doctrines (either 
directly
 or 
implicitly
) deny
 the Lord Christ and his benefits, who by his precious blood shed on the Cross, paid a sufficient
 price for them (which would have been available for them, if they had truly believed in him), and so will bring upon them∣selves speedy destruction. And 
many,
 he foretells them, will be led away with their destructive carnal doctrines, whereby the 
glorious, pure Gospel
 of Christ will be evil-spoken of, whilst the very Gentiles shall take notice, that some that profess themselves Christians, teach impure doctrines, and live wicked lives.


He further tells them, that th
se 
Deceivers
 being acted by covetousness, will, with their 
cunning words
 and 
discourses,
 seek to circumvent them, and make advantage of them. However he suggests to them, they should not fear the being long expos'd to their temptations. For the judgment to which such 
Im∣postors
 were long since adjudged by God, is now approaching, and will cer∣tainly surprize them. And that he might the more clearly convince them of this, he sets before them a threefold instance: 
1.
 Of the 
Angels
 that sinned, whom God did not spare, but upon their rebellion against him, cast them pre∣sently out of Heaven, and condemning them to the pains of Hell
, reserved them under the restraints of his irresistible power in a state of misery and horror (as condemned Malefactors are reserved in ch
ins and darkness) to the day of judgment, the time of their execution, when they shall be cast into 
everlasting torments,
 Mat. 
8.29.
 And if God spared not the Angels that sinned, they might easily imagine, he will not spare 
false pro∣phets
 and their followers. 
2.
 He instances in the people of the old world, on whom God brought the 
Flood,
 and drowned them, only preserving 
Noah
 (with seven more of his Family) who often warned them to repent and amend their lives. Lastly, He instances in the wicked Cities of 
Sodom
 and 
Gomorrha,
 and their neighbouring villages or suburbs, which he adjudged to utter destru∣ction, and consum'd them by fire from heaven, and made them an exemplary spectacle and document to all that should ever live in the like sins. Yet at that time when he manifested so much severity towards those wicked Cities, he de∣livered 
Righteous Lot,
 and his Family, whose pious soul was daily vext with the unrighteous deeds of these impure 
Sodomites.


From all th s
 examples he inferrs, That God knows how to preserve his own faithful s
rvants from the temptations and troubles wherewith they are here exercised, and he can reserve the wicked to the day of judgment, to be punished according to their deserts. 
From Ver. 1, to 10.


Now among these 
wicked ones,
 he shews these 
Hereticks
 and 
Seducers
 are chiefly to be reckoned; whom he thus characterizeth. 
1.
 They are impure and unclean persons. 
2.
 They despise government, and speak evil of dignities. 
3.
 They are presumptuous, audacious, and self-will'd. Their sin in despising lawful authority, he aggravates by setting before them the contrary example of 
good Angels
 [see 
Jude v. 9.
], who are greater in power and might than any Magistrates here on earth; yet even 
these,
 though God employs them to protect his Church, and sometimes to withstand and punish the tyranny and rage of wicked Rulers
; yet they bring not a railing-accusation against them before the Lord (that we can find in all the Scripture); neither do they set out, with 
reviling words,
 what they have to say against them, that bear upon them a lawful authority. But the temper of these 
Seducers
 is far different from this: For as brute-beasts, following the brutish 
impetus
 and force of their ap∣petites, pursue after their prey till they run themselves into the net (and so seem made
 to be taken and destroyed of men); so these 
false Teachers


 speaking vilely and reproachfully of 
Magistrates
 (the use and benefit of whom they understand not), shall perish by the destruction
 which they justly bring upon them∣selves, and shall receive the reward of their wickedness and unrighteousness. He further shews them, That these are 
they
 who count daily
 voluptuousness their Hea∣ven, and in the 
day-time
 take pleasure in those villanies which are wont to need the 
night
 to cover their shame. He tells them, They are 
spots
 and 
blemishes
 to the Christian name. They are such as de∣liciously
 please themselves in the cunning 
artifices
 and fair pretences whereby they deceive others, insinuating themselves into them, both at their religious and ordi∣nary Feasts. And whereas at such Assemblies nothing but 
modesty
 and 
charity
 should be expressed; these 
Deceivers
 come thither with eyes full of adultery, and by their lascivious glances are continually solliciting others to sin. They also ensnare with their errors and vile pra∣ctises, such as are not well s
tled and grounded in Chri∣stianity. He further adds, That their hearts are a shop full of avaritious and covetous inventions and designs of extortion, whereby they ma∣nifest thems
lves children of perdition, and such as having forsaken the pure Christian Doctrine, are gone astray from the right path, following the example of the false
 prophet 
Balaam,
 the son of 
Bozor
, who instead of obeying the com∣mandment of the Lord, was so tempted by that great reward which 
Balak
 King of 
Moab
 promised him, that he would for the hope of it (even against his Consci∣ence) have cursed 
Israel:
 but the madness of this 
Soothsayer
 was miracu∣lously rebuked by an Ass speaking with Man's voice. He further shews, that these 
Deceivers
 pretend to be deep 
Fountains
 of saving-knowledg; but they have no such thing in them. They pretend to be 
Clouds
 that drop down the saving-doctrine, as rain, to make the Church fruitful; whereas they are only Clouds driven impetuously by every wind and tempest, from one vicious doctrine and practise to another; never affording the rain they promised, but only darkning the skie; to whom is reserved, by the just judgment of God, 
eternal darkness
 and blackness. He shews, that with a lofty and an affected stile they propound their vain and false doctrines, and thereby amuse the simple 
[Jude v. 16.],
 and allure to their party (by indulging a li∣berty to the lusts of the flesh, and to much wantonness) suc
 Novice-Christians who had left the heathenish bestiality, and had embraced the Christian profession; which they might do, and yet not be really regenerate. He tells them, They promise indeed to bring them into a state of liberty, when alas they draw them into the bondage of sin, and they themselves are the basest slaves to lust and corruption in the world. For those lusts by which they have been conquered and brought into bondage, the
 must needs be slaves unto. And they had need take heed of being thus in∣veagled by these 
Seducers,
 lest they prove flat 
Apostates
 from Christ, and then the
r condition will be far worse than that of ignorant unconverted Heathens. For they that have been converted from their Heathenism, and the Paganish sin▪ wherein they lived, by being brought to the knowledg of Christ and his Gopel, and then relapse and return to them again; this later estate of theirs, thi
 
Christian-Heathenism
 (as I may so call it) is far worse than their bare Heithenism at first was. For it had been better for them never to have known the way of 
righteousness
 and 
justification
 revealed in the Gospel, than ha∣ving

 known it, to turn away from the holy Doctrine thereof, and the pure precepts it enjoins, and to fall back again into their former vicious and heathenish courses. But such as do so, plainly shew, that they were never 
truly
 and 
inwardly
 renewed by the Spirit, as the sheep of Christ are; but were only 
outwardly
 washed in Baptism; and by an 
external
 profession of Christianity only, had renounced that vileness whereunto now they are return'd; so that the old Pro∣verb mentioned 
Prov. 26.11,
 is verified of them; 
The dog is turned to lick up his vomit, which before, when it troubled his stomach, he vo∣mited up; and the sow that was washed, is returned to her wallowing in the mire.
 From Ver. 
10
 to the end.


 The Apostle having thus prest 
growth in grace and holiness,
 in the first part of his Epistle; and cautioned them against 
error
 in the second: He comes now, in this last, to clear up and defend the Doctrine of the 
last Judg∣ment,
 and to shew what use 
believers
 should make of it. He shews, the end intended by him in both his Epistles, was to be their 
Remembrancer,
 and to awaken and stir up the sincere-hearted among them, to obey the instructions which had been given them by the writings of the 
Prophets,
 and by the teaching of the 
Apostles.
 And in the first place he would have them to con∣sider this (and to arm themselves accordingly against it); That in these 
last days
, 
viz.
 the times of the Mes∣sias, which were now arrived; certain 
scoffers
 will arise, who walking according to their own lusts, and desiring to sin securely, will question the second-coming of Christ, and plead that this present world shall always continue as it is; and they shall 
scoffingly
 say, How long will it be ere that 
promise
 and 
prediction
 be fulfill'd, That 
Christ shall come to judg the quick and dead
 [see 
Mal. 2.17.
]? We find this indeed long ago fore∣told in the prophecy of 
Enoch [Jude
 v. 
14, 15.
]; but yet we see no appearance of its accomplishment: for from the time
 that the 
first men,
 that were known in the world, dyed, and their children after them; there has been no 
resur∣rection,
 or 
summoning men to judgment.
 And excepting this, that people have dyed in all ages, there has been no considerable change (say they) since the creation, but all things have gone on in a setled constant course.


The Apostle replies to these 
scoffers,
 shewing them the ground of their vain reasoning to be their own voluntary and affected ignorance. For 
first,
 they seem'd not to understand how God 
created the world
 at first by his word; and how the 
earth,
 being the lowest and heaviest of the Elements, was yet by his power kept from being totally overflowed by the 
waters
 that go about it, and cover it in many places. By which miracle they might have perceived, that 
Nature
 is governed by the will of God; and from the whole they might have ar∣gued, That if 
all things
 were 
made
 by God, they might also easily be destroyed by Him. 
2.
 He shews, they seemed ignorant how God brought the 
Flood
 upon the old world in the days of 
Noah,
 and drowned them for their wickedness; 
Heaven
 and 
Earth,
 both contributing at His command their waters thereunto. And if 
hey had known this, they might have clearly seen, that all things have not co
ti∣nued since the Creation as they were at first. And he that made so grea
 an alteration in the world then, can easily do so again if it please him. 'Tis true, he acknowledges the 
world that now is
 (by the word and promis
 of God, 
Gen. 9.11.
) is secured from being drowned again, it being reserv'd to be destroy'd by 
fire
 at the day of judgment, that day that will be so terrible to the ungodly, when they shall receive a full reward of all their wick∣edness. But these prophane scoffers will perhaps again reply, If Christ intend

 to come to judgment, why does he so long defer his coming? The Apostle answers, That 
this delay
 ought not to be judged according to our sense and apprehension. For God doth not measure times as we do; but unto him (in regard of his Eternity and Omniscience, comprehending all things past, pre∣sent, and to come), these periods of time which seem so long to us, are but a 
moment,
 Psal. 
90.4. 2.
 This delay doth not proceed from slackness in God, as some may imagine. For that person cannot be said to be 
slack
 who is 
long
 ere he comes; but 
he is slack
 that comes not at his due and appointed time. Now God will not put off his coming one hour beyond his own set and deter∣min'd time [see. 
Heb. 10.37,
]. And they ought to consider, that God's de∣ferring his coming, proceeds not from any other reason than the abundance of his 
patience
 and long-suffering towards poor sinners, not willing
 (as far forth as may consist with his Justice and Goodness) that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance; and accordingly, that time should be given them for that purpose. But though 
this great day
 of the Lord
 seem slow in coming, yet it 
will come,
 and that suddenly, as a thief in the night, and will surprize many secure and unprepared sinners▪ who shall then be found on the face of the earth. And when it shall come, there will be a great change and dissolution of the whole frame of Nature, 
the Hea∣vens will pass away with a great noise, and the ele∣ments shall melt with fervent heat; and the earth, and all the works therein, shall be burnt up
; yet so, as possibly out of this conflagration God will bring forth a 
new edition
 of Heaven and Earth, and of all or most of the Creatures in them contained, to be lasting monuments of His own Power and Glory, and objects of the Saints delight∣ful contemplation. 
From Ver. 1, to 11.


The Apostle comes now to make a practical improvement of this Doctrine, exhorting them, from the 
certain, sudden,
 and 
terrible
 coming of Christ, to the practise of sundry duties. 
1.
 If the whole Systeme and Frame of Hea∣ven and Earth must be so wonderfully alter'd to make it a fit habitation for the 
Saints,
 then they should consider how holy they ought to be, and how great a degree of purity they should labour to attain, who profess themselves the people of the Lord, and hope to live in this new world. 
2.
 Such per∣sons, he tells them, ought not only to expect 
that day,
 and to look for it; but to 
hasten to it
 in their longing-desires; and by their prayers and other en∣deavours (in their places), 
o further, what they can, those works which must he done, before it come; and so, as much as lies in them, 
hastning that day,
 which will be so full of terror and majesty, and wherein (as he said before) the 
Heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat.
 Yet this great change, he tells them, will not tend to the utter ruin and annihilation, but to the refining
 of the world. For according to the promise (says he) which God hath made unto us by his Pro∣phet 
Isa. 65.17,
 and 
66.22.
 we look for 
new heavens
 and a 
new earth
 (not for substance, but renewed in qualities) wherein only 
righteous
 and 
holy
 persons
 shall dwell, 
Rev. 21.7. 3.
 From the consideration of that comfortable estate and everlasting blessedness which 
believers
 have ground to expect hereafter, he exhorts them to give all diligence, that they may be with∣out spot, and blameless
, being washed in the blood of Christ, and sanctified

 by his Spirit; and if it shall so happen that any of them should live to that day, that then they may be found of him (when he comes to judgment) in a state of peace and reconciliation with God, and in peace of mind and con∣science, not being affrighted at the coming of it. 
4.
 He exhorts them to in∣terpret and account the Lord's 
delay
 in coming to judgment, and his patience and long-suffering exercis'd towards sinners, as intended by him (not as a con∣nivance at their sins, but) to bring them to 
repentance,
 and so to 
salvation,
 if they will make a right use of it. And agreeably hereunto, he tells them, his Brother and fellow-Apostle 
Paul
 (according to the great wisdom given him by God) had written unto them in his Epistle to the 
Romans
 (wherein there are many things that properly concern the 
Jews
), and in his Epistle to the 
He∣brews,
 and so in several of his other Epistles. In which he acknowledges, there are some things 
hard to be understood,
 which unlearned and unstable∣minded-men do often-times wrest (as they do also other Scriptures) to their own ruin and destruction. And therefore they had need to labour after a clear understanding of those Scriptures, that they may not mistake about them. 
From Ver. 11, to 17.


He comes now to the 
Conclusion
 of his Epistle; wherein he tells them, That seeing they were fore-warned of their danger, and acquainted how to prevent it, they should be more wary, lest they be drawn aside by the 
sedu∣ction
 of wicked men, from the way of 
Truth
 and 
Holiness
 wherein they had been in some measure established, and which they had hitherto professed. But on the contrary, they should labour daily to 
grow more and more in grace,
 and in a clear and distinct knowledg of our Lord and Saviour, and his Do∣ctrine. To this blessed Saviour he desires humbly and affectionately, that all honour and glory may be for ever ascribed. 
Amen. From Ver. 17, to the end.








SECT. XIV.


THE Epistle of 
Jude
 was written probably about this this time, being very near of kin in 
style
 and 
matter
 to the second Epistle of 
Peter.
 This 
Jude,
 or 
Judas,
 was son of 
Alpheus
 and 
Mary
 (sister to the blessed Virgin), and brother to 
James
 the Less [see 
pag.
 309.], and Cousin-german to our Sa∣viour, 
Mat.
 13.55. He was called also 
Leb∣baeus
 and 
Thaddaeus
 [
Mat.
 10.3.], to di∣stinguish him (as some think) from 
Judas Isca∣riot,
 whose very Name was now grown odi∣ous. Of this 
Jude
's 
conversion
 and 
call
 to be an Apostle, the Scripture speaks not parti∣cularly. We find little more mentioned of him, besides his be∣ing numbred among the Twelve Apostles, and his writing this Epistle, save only this, That he propounded that Question to our Saviour, Joh. 14.22, 
Lord, how is it that thou wilt mani∣fest thy self to us, and not unto the world?
 This Apostle is re∣ported by the 
Ecclesiastick Historians
 to have preached the Gospel afterwards in many parts of the world, as particularly in 
Idumaea, Arabia, Syria,
 and a long time in 
Mesopotamia,
 as also in 
Pontus,
 and 
Egypt,
 and at last in 
Persia;
 where 'tis said, he was slain by the 
Magi
 for his free and faithful reproof of their Superstitions.


In the Epistle there are these three parts,




1. The 
Preface.


2. The 
Body
 of the Epistle.


3. The 
Conclusion.




1.
 THE 
Preface;
 wherein is declared, 
1.
 Who was the 
Penman
 of the Epistle, 
viz. Jude
 the servant of Christ, and brother of 
James. 2.
 Who were the 
persons
 to whom it was directed, 
viz.
 to all the Christian-
He∣brews,
 who were effectually called
, and sanctified by the Spirit of God the Father, and kept
 and preserved 
in
 and 
by
 Christ, in their state of grace and holiness, unto salvation. To all whom he wishes that the 
mercy, fa∣vour,
 and 
good-will
 of God, may be more and more manifested, and that 
in∣ward peace
 of conscience, and 
love
 to God, and to one another, may be daily more and more encreased in them. 
Ver. 1, 2.




2.
 He comes now to the Body of the Epistle, wherein he tells them, That seeing he gave himself with all diligence to write unto them of the 
common salvation
 (which he and they, and all the Saints, have interest in), he found it needful, in the first place, to exhort them, that they should earnestly contend for the 
faith
, that is, the 
sound doctrine
 of the Gospel, which is necessary to be owned and believed, in order to the obtaining salvati∣on, and was 
once
 and 
perfectly
 (never after to be altered) delivered to the 
Saints,
 that is, to the 
holy A∣postles,
 to be propagated; and to 
particular believers,
 to be faithfully kept and preserved by them, and trans∣mitted unto posterity. He inforces his exhortation with these reasons: 
1.
 He tells them, certain wicked 
Seducers
 were slily crept into the Church, 
men
 long before 
written
 
of,
 and 
prophesied of
 [see v. 
14, 15.
 and 
17, 18.
], as those that would by their great sins and impieties fall into that condemnation which God hath ordain'd as a just reward to such trans∣gressions. Th
se 
wicked
 and 
ungodly men,
 he shews, will pervert the doctrine of the 
free-grace
 of God, and of 
justification by faith in Christ,
 and make it patro∣nize loosness and lasciviousness
 (as the 
Nicol
s, Gnosticks,
 and other impure Hereticks did) and will either 
openly
 or 
covertly
 deny Jesus Christ our only Master, God, and Lord, lessening the dignity of his Person, and invalidating (as much as lies in them) the benefits of his death and sufferings. That therefore 
those
 unto whom he wrote, might take heed of following their pernicious ways, he sets before them the examples of Gods vengeance inflicted in former times up in persons guilty of such transgressions as these seducers were guilty of. And, 
1.
 He tells them, that he will once
 more be their 
Remembrancer
 while he is in this Tabernacle (though they knew this already) how God destroyed
 the 
Israelits
 in the Wilderness for their 
unbelief,
 after they were brought out of 
Egypt.
 And so those now that fall into the 
like sin,
 are to expect the like distruction. 
2.
 He sets before them the example of the 
Angels
 who kept not that 
first estate
 of blessedness in which they were created; but being for their sins and rebellion against God, thrown down from Heaven (where the good Angels have still their habitation, 
Mat. 24.36. Mar. 12.25.
) they are now reserved under the restraint of his irresistible Power, in an estate of misery and horror (as condemned Malefactors are reserved in chains and dark∣ness to the judgment of the great day, when their condition shall be made much more miserable than now it is; see 
2 Pet. 2.4.
 And if God spared not 
Apostate Angels,
 surely he will not spare 
Apostatizing Seducers. 3.
 He shews them how 
Sodom
 and 
Gomorrah,
 and the neighbouring-Cities 
Adma
 and 
Zehoim,
 giving themselves up to prodigious lusts and uncleanness, were then most notoriously punished with utter destruction by fire and brimstone from hea∣ven; yet that was but as a fore-runner of those eternal flames of Hell which they now suffer, and so may well be a 
terrifying-example
 and 
warning
 to all that fall into the same sins at this time. And yet for all these dreadful examples, he shews, that in like manner did 
these Seducers
 (who vent
 their own 
dreams
 and 
phantasies
 instead of Gods truth, 
Jer. 23.25.
) pollute and defile themselves with filthy libidinous practices. Nay further, they 
despise do∣minion,
 and shew themselves adversaries to Civil Government, and revile and speak contumeliously of those that are in Authority, see 
2 Pet. 2.10.
 Now this their sin in despising lawful Authority, he aggravates, by setting before them

 the contrary example of 
good Angels.
 He tells them, that 
Michael
 the Arch-Angel, though excellent in nature and high in office when he contended with the Devil about the 
Body of Moses
 (which God, knowing 
Israel
's proneness to Idolatry, had buried no man knows where, lest they should commit Idola∣try with it, as they did with the brazen Serpent), and when he withstood him because he endeavoured to discover it, that he might thereby tempt the people to Idolatry; yet his holy nature would not permit him to deal with this impure Spirit in an indecent and contumelious manner; but he made his attempts fruitless by an holy and modest address to God, desiring the Lord to 
rebuke him
 [see 
Zach. 3.2.
], and referr'd the whole judgment of the cause to him. But these 
Seducers,
 he shews, belch out their reproaches against 
Dignities
 and 
Magistrates
 (the usefulness of whom they know not), and possibly against the mysteries of the Christian faith it self, which they understand not, though they call themselves 
Gnosticks,
 and pretend to a greater and larger knowledg than others; see 
2 Pet. 2.12.
 Nay, what they know 
naturally
 by the very light of Nature to be unlawful, in those things, as 
brute beasts,
 they corrupt and defile themselves. The Apostle also chargeth them with other sins; as, 
1.
 With 
Envy, Malice,
 and 
Hatred
 against their Brethren and fellow-Christians. 
Wo
 
unto them
 (saith he), they have gone in the way of 
Cain,
 who was a Murtherer, and slew his Brother, and 
they
 in like manner, by reason of their hatred to their bre∣thren, are no less than Murtherers, 
1 Joh. 3.12, 15. 2.
 They have adultera∣ted the truth for base gain, and so have followed greedily the error of 
Ba∣laam
, who to get a reward, ensnared the 
Israelites
 in a great villany, 
Rev. 2.14. 3.
 He chargeth them with 
seditiousness
 against 
Magistracy
 and 
Ministry,
 and imitating 
Corah
 and 
his Accomplices,
 who rose up against 
Moses
 and 
Aaron,
 Numb. 
16.31;
 and this he tells them will certainly bring ruin upon them, as it did upon 
Corah, Dathan,
 and 
Abiram.
 He further sets out their wickedness, by sundry resemblances: 
1.
 He says they are 
spots
 and 
blemishes
 in their 
Love-feasts, 2
 Pet. 
2.12.
 (the infamy of their lives being a scandal to their Christian-Assemblies); and coming thither, they feed luxuriously, without any fear of offending either God or Man. 
2.
 They are 
Clouds
 without water, promising rain, but giving none 
(2 Pet. 2.17.);
 ma∣king a shew of learning and knowledg, but not having any such thing really in them; they are indeed no more but empty Clouds, impetuously driven by winds and tempests from one vicious doctrine and practice to another; and be∣ing unstable, come to nothing in the end. 
3.
 They are 
Trees
 that bring forth no good and wholsome fruit, but only such as presently withers and rots; they are 
twice dead
, 
1.
 In re∣spect of their natural estate, upon which account they 
are dead in trespasses and sins:
 And then in respect of their apostacy, and falling off from their Christian profession: And thus having to their 
natural,
 drawn upon themselves a 
judicial
 hardness, if they so continue, as they are fit for nothing else, so they shall certainly be plucked up by the roots
, and cast into the fire. 
4.
 They are 
raging
 and 
furious waves
 of the sea 
[Isa. 57.20.],
 always turbulent, foaming out and discovering the filthiness of their hearts, which they ought to be ashamed of. 
5.
 They are 
wandring-starrs;
 they take upon them the name of 
illuminated
 persons, but are indeed uncertain, unstable Tea∣chers, wandring and departing from the true faith once delivered to them: but though they profess themselves 
Starrs,
 yet to them 
blackness of darkness
 (that is, exceeding great darkness, call'd 
outward darkness,
 Mat. 
8.12,
 as being furthest off from that region of light and glory wherein the Saints shall dwell)

 is reserved as their just reward and punishment. He further shews that to 
these men
 the Prophecy of 
Enoch
 belongs, who at the beginning of the world (being the seventh from 
Adam
), by the spirit of prophecy, foretold the sins of such persons, and their condemnation at the day of judgment, when Christ shall come in a glorious manner attended with Myriads of Saints and Angels to execute judgment upon all the ungodly, and especially upon such as have spo∣ken contumeliously against Himself and his holy Truth. And that 
these men
 are some of those 
ungodly
 ones whom this prophecy concerns, may appear by this; Th
y are 
murmurers
 and 
complainers,
 never contented, but always quarrelling and complaining of their present condition; they love to walk after the lusts of their own hearts, without being restrained by any laws: their mouths are full of haughty
 and insolent spee∣ches, when they have to do with those whom they judg themselves superior unto; but they flatter, cajole, and seem to 
admire
 the persons and the actions of 
others
 from whom they expect any benefit or advantage. And besides this 
ancient Prophecy
 for the fortifying of them against these 
Seducers,
 he advises them to remem∣ber and consider the 
warnings
 and 
advertisements
 given them by the Apostles 
Paul
 and 
Peter
 [see 
2 Pet. 3.2.
], who expresly speak of these wicked 
scoffers,
 sons of 
Belial,
 that should arise in the Church in the 
last times
, which were now come. These 
mockers
 and 
scoffers,
 he shews, were 
such,
 as without any just cause or warrant, separated themselves from the communion and society of faithful Christians, and sought to draw others also into the like separation, pretending to be more holy, and spiritual, and perfect, than they; whereas in∣deed they themselves were meer 
Sensualists,
 such in whom 
sense
 and the 
flesh
 do reign with full vogue and sway, and have no∣thing of that 
enlightning, sanctifying, quickning, comforting-Spirit,
 which Christ communicates to his faithful ones. 
From Ver. 2, to 20.


He comes now in the close of his Epistle to give them some hortatory Directions, by way of 
Antidote,
 against these 
Seducers,
 and their Se∣ductions.


1.
 That they should labour to build up one another in holiness, being setled on th
t holy and pure Doctrine of Faith (as on a firm foundation) which they had learned from the Apostles.


2.
 They should be earnest in prayer unto God, That by his Divine Grace and Power he would strengthem them therein; labouring to pray by the as∣sistance of the Holy Ghost
; and exciting in themselves the gifts and gra∣ces he hath given them.


3.
 That they should keep themselves continually in the exercise of 
love
 to God, labouring to encrease therein more and more; chearfully expecting and looking for that 
merciful
 
sentence
 of Christ at the Day of Judgment, whereby he will bestow eternal life on them.


4.
 He gives them directions how to deal with those that are any way corrupted by these 
Seducers,
 viz. That they should deal with them af∣t
r a 
different manner,
 according as their particular condition required; such as were w
ak and simple, and had been easily seduced, he advises they should deal with them with great tenderness and compassion: But as for those who were

 further intangled, and corrupted, and hardned in their errors by these 
Sedu∣cers;
 they should endeavour to 
save them with fear,
 that is, they should ter∣rifie them with the fear of God's judgments and wrath, if they went on in these ways; and by sharp admonitions, and a due and solemn use of Church-censures (as occasion required) snatch them, as it were, out of the fire which will destroy them if they continue in it. And thus they would shew and de∣clare their great detestation of holding any co-partnership or fellowship with them in their errors; and that they not only hated all impiety and wicked∣n
ss of life, but all erroneous Doctrines that might infect men, or draw them into it; as when a man would avoid the infection of the Pestilence, he will flye from, and not dare to touch any garment
 of an infected person.


He shuts up his Epistle, commending them to the Divine Grace of Christ, who is able to keep them from 
apostacy
 and 
falling away
 after the exam∣ple of these Seducers, and to cause to stand before his own most glorious Throne, 
such
 as shall be accounted blameless
 in his sight, to their exceed∣ing great joy and triumph. To this only wise God, who is our Saviour, he desires all Glory, M
j
sty, Dominion, and Power, may for ever be ascrib'd. 
Amen.








SECT. XV.


ABOUT this time 
Paul
 seems to have written his 
Second Epistle
 to 
Timothy
 (now, as 'tis probable, at 
Ephesus
) who had been imprisoned with him at 
Rome,
 but was at this present set at liberty: see 
Heb.
 13.23.


In the Epistle there are these three parts:




1.
 The Preface.


2.
 The Body of the Epistle.


3.
 The Conclusion.




1.
 THE 
Preface,
 in which he declares himself an 
Apostle
 of Jesus Christ, by the will and appointment of God the Father, that he might declare and make known the Gospel or 
Promise
 
o
 eter∣nal life,
 which is made to all who truly believe in Christ. He directs his Epistle to 
Timothy,
 calling him his dearly beloved son (because by him converted to the faith), to whom he wishes an encrease of grace, an a∣bundant sense of the 
mercy
 of God towards him, and much inward 
peace
 from 
God the Father,
 the Foun∣tain of all blessings; and from 
Jesus Christ
 the Media∣tor, who is the Conduit-pipe by whom they are con∣veyed. And in the first place he tells him, that he so∣lemnly gave thanks
 to the Lord for the gifts and graces he had bestowed on him. And God (whom he served after the example of the holy Patriarchs of old, with an upright conscience) was his witness, how he was continually mindful of him in his prayers night and day. He tells him, he desired earnestly to see him again. For he remembred how passionately he wept at their parting, and he should be glad (if it so pleased God) that their meeting again might be as full of joy as their parting was of sorrow. He further tells him how much he plea∣s
d himself with the contemplation of that 
sincere faith
 which he believed was in him; which 
grace
 eminently manifested it self before in his Grand∣mother 
Lois,
 and Mother 
Eunice:
 And as it dwelt and continued in them unto the end; so he was confident it would do in him also. 
From Ver. 1, to 6.


2.
 He comes now to the 
Body of the Epistle;
 wherein, 
first,
 he tells him, That seeing he wish'd him so well, he would be his 
Monitor
 and 
Remem∣brancer,
 and would exhort him to excite and stir up the 
Ministerial gi
t
 that was in him (by a diligent exercise thereof), viz. the 
faculty of tea
∣ing the Gospel,
 which was conferred on him by his hands 
[1 Tim. 4.14.


 see 
pag. 218.],
 when with the consent and concurrence of the 
Presbytery
 he ordained him to the Office of a Minister. Which gift he should not through 
cowardize
 or 
fear
 suffer to lye unprofitably by him. For the 
holy
 
Spirit
 which God gives his faithful Ministers, is not a Spirit infusing fear and cowardize into them (which would hinder them in the discharge of their du∣ties); but a 
Spirit of Power,
 animating them with Christian courage, and a 
Spirit of love,
 working in them an holy love to God, and an ardent desire of the salvation of men; and lastly, a 
Spirit
 working in them a sound and composed mind, and giving them that pru∣dence and sobriety, that they neither through their own indiscretion bring troubles upon themselves; nor when they come upon them, break out into rage or impatience. 
Ver. 6, 7.


2.
 He exhorts him not to be asham'd of the Gospel which testifies of Christ, nor of his sufferings who was imprisoned for it; but to be a chearful part∣ner and co-sufferer with him, in bearing patiently his share of those afflicti∣ons which follow a sincere profession of the Gospel, according as God shall please to afford him power and strength.


3.
 He shews, that not only 
Timothy,
 but all true Christians, have great cause to dispose themselves to a willingness to suffer for the Gospel when called to it, because God hath saved them by his Son Jesus Christ from eternal mi∣sery; having called them with an holy calling, not for any works fore-seen in them, that could merit this calling, or move him thereunto; but according as it pleased and seemed good to himself, even according to his own free mercy and goodness, and the 
grace
 by him∣self 
given them
, that is, which he purposed and decreed to give them 
in
 and 
through
 his Son, before the world began
 [see 
pag. 186.
]. Which grace (he shews) God hath now manifested very clearly, and made them partakers of it, by Christs coming into the world
, who hath by his death on the Cross taken away the sting of 
natural death
 to all true believers, and totally freed them from the punishment of eternal death; and hath shewed them, by the preaching of the Gospel, a clear way to attain a glorious everlasting life and immortality, which before was not so clearly re∣vealed. And for the preaching and teaching of this Gospel (especially to the Gentiles), he declares that God had given 
him
 the authority and commission of an Apostle. And this very thing, 
viz.
 his 
preach∣ing to the Gentiles
 (he tells him) had highly exasperated the 
Jews,
 and so had brought these troubles upon him which he now suffered. But he was not asha∣med of his sufferings in so 
good a cause,
 nor discouraged at them: For he knew in whose Power and Faithfulness he had put his trust, and was fully assur'd he was able to keep safe that great 
depositum
 or pledg he had com∣mitted to him (
viz.
 his 
Soul
 and 
Body
), to the day of Christ's glorious coming to judgment, at which time he expected a glorious reward for all his sufferings. 
From Ver. 8, to 13.


4.
 He exhorts him to hold fast that
 
form of sound words
 (or 
short sum∣mary
 of such things as were to be believed and practis'd by all) which he had receiv'd from him; which 
summary
 of sound doctrine, he shews, consisted principally in precepts and directions con
erning 
faith
 in Christ, and 
love
 to

 God and our Neighbour; which 
graces
 are required by Christ, and framed in the hearts of all his true members, by his Spirit; see 
1 Tim. 1.14. Gal. 5.6. Eph. 6.23.
 He enjoins him also to keep inviolably that great 
treasure
 or 
depositum
 of the Gospel
 (which was entrusted to him to be kept pure and uncorrupted by him, and transmitted to posterity), though the power and assistance of the Holy Ghost, who dwelleth in the hearts and souls of true believers. He tells him, he supposed he had heard that the 
Asian
-Christians, who were then at 
Rome,
 had in the time of his distress, forsaken him; as par∣ticularly, 
Phigellus
 and 
Hermogenes.
 He des
res the Lord to shew mer
y unto, and plentifully to reward the Family of 
On
siphorus,
 who, being come to 
Rome,
 sought him out dilgently, and found him, and shewed great kind∣ness unto him, and oft refreshed him, and owned him without fear or shame in this time of his imprisonment, see 
Eph. 6.20.
 He desires he may find mercy of the Lord in that 
great day
 when he shall come to judg the quick and dead, and to distribute rewards and punishments. For, says he, besides what he hath done for me here at 
Rome,
 thou knowest also very well in how many things else he relieved me when I was at 
Ephesus. From Ver. 13, to the end.


 
5.
 He proceeds to direct 
Timothy
 in the right management of his Mini∣sterial Office. In order to which,


1.
 He exhorts him to strengthen and encourage himself through the grace derived to him from God the 
Father,
 as the Fountain; and 
in
 and 
by
 Je∣sus Christ as the Conduit-pipe. 
Ver. 1.


2.
 That the sacred Doctrine of the Gospel, and the precepts of holy living which he had heard him deliver in the presence of many the same he should impart and commit to persons of known ability and fidelity, who may be able to teach others. 
V. 2.


3.
 He should be ready to endure hardship, and encounter difficulties, as a good Soldier of Jesus Christ. And therefore as Soldiers were not to entan∣gle themselves in the ordinary affairs of this life, such as 
Merchandize, Trades,
 or 
Husbandry,
 &c. but were to attend upon their 
Colours,
 and to observe the orders of their Commanders, so neith
r must a faithful 
Teacher
 of the Gospel cumb
r himself with such worldly matters as may hinder him from a faithful discharge of his Office, but must diligently attend upon his Ministry; and esp
cially that he may please Christ who hath called him to this warfare, and is his Commander and General, and is able abundantly to re∣ward him for all that he shall 
do
 or 
suffer
 for him. And as they that strive for 
Masteries
 in the 
Olympick-Games,
 are not to be crowned except they strive 
lawfully,
 that is, observe the 
Laws
 and 
Rules
 of the Games, be they never so difficult or painful to be observed; And as the Husbandman must first
 toil and labour, before he can be partaker of the fruits of the earth: so a Teacher of the Gospel must first labour, and take pains, and endure hard∣ship, before he can hope to reap that great fruit and benefit, the 
gaining
 and 
converting
 of souls to Christ. He advises him therefore to consider of what he said, and desires the Lord to give him a right and sound judgment, that he may understand how to do all things right which belong unto him. 
From Ver. 3, to 8.


4.
 He advises him to inculcate the Doctrine of Christ's taking his 
hu∣mane nature
 of the 
seed of David
 according to the Scriptures, and the Doctrine of his 
Resurrection;
 this being the Doctrine which 
he
 himself had

 every where preached; and for the preaching of this
, he was now im∣prisoned at 
Rome
 as if he were a Malefactor. But he acquaints him, that the 
word of the Lord,
 or 
the Gospel,
 was not bound; for he preached it feely, notwithstanding his bonds; yea, his imprisonment had been a means of divulging and spreading it very much in 
Rome.
 And he tells him, that the 
Elect
 were 
worthy,
 that for their edification and confirmation in the faith (in order that they may obtain salvation and eternal glory, which is freely given through the Merits and Mediation of Christ), himself, and other Mini∣sters of Christ, should suffer all sorts of afflictions; and they ought not in the least to be discouraged thereat: For this (says he) is a most 
true saying,
 If we be afflicted with him, and suffer as he suffered, for the defence of the truth 
[Rom. 8.17, 36. 2 Cor. 4.10.];
 nay, if we be persecuted even to death for his sake, we shall also live together with him, and shall certainly be re∣warded with a participation of his glory. But on the contrary, if we deny him, he will deny us. And we may assure our selves of this, that though we may be unfaithful
 in not con∣fessing him stedfastly, or serving him with that fidelity we ought; yet he always abides faithful, and will ne∣ver fail of performing any of his promises; for he can∣not do any thing that is contrary to the perfection of his Divine Nature. 
From Ver. 8, to 14.


5.
 He directs him to inculcate these things into his Auditors upon all oc∣casions; and charge them strictly, as they will answer it before the Lord at his coming, That they fall not into those idle disputes and 
verbal-contentions,
 such as are mentioned 
1 Tim. 6.4,
 which tend not to any real profit or good, but infuse uncharitableness and faction into mens minds, and tend to the draw∣ing them off from sound doctrine. As for 
Timothy
 himself, he exhorts him, That in his Ministry he should endeavour to approve himself unto God, an up∣right, sound, and faithful Teacher, a 
workman
 who (in respect of any un∣skilfulness▪ negligence, or unfaithfulness) hath no cause to be ashamed, and one that is a right 
divider
 and distribut
r of the word of truth. But he should avoid
 and take h
ed f
r himself, and endeavour that his Flock should avoid also the prophane and vain bablings and discours s of proud 
Hereticks;
 for such discourses will tend to the promoting and encreasing
 of more and m
re impiety in the hearers. And their 
false doctrine,
 if it be not stopt at first, will eat as doth a 
Gangrene,
 and spread far into the body of the Church. This he plainly evidenceth unto them, by instan
ing in the dangerous error of 
Hymenaeus
 [see 
1 Tim. 1.20.
] and 
Philetus,
 who affirmed, that the 
resurrection was past already,
 acknowled
ing no other but the spiritual resurrection of the soul from the death of sin; by which dangerous doctrine the 
Ortho∣dox Faith
 of some concerning the resurrection of the body
 at the last day, was overthrown. But he tells him, though some turn away from the truth, and the faith of some be overthrown; yet the 
foundation
 which God hath laid for tho salvation of true believers, stand∣eth sure and unmovable, having 
this seal
 to confirm it, 
God knoweth who are his, and discerns them from others, and loves them, and takes care of them, and will preserve them unto eternal life;
 yet such as have good ground to believe they belong to God, must not be secure and careless of their salvation, or indulge themselves in sin; but must know, that there is required on their part a 
conscientions care to please God,
 and that every one who names the name of Christ, and pro∣fesses to believe in him, must make conscience to depart from all iniquity. But

 he shews it cannot be expected in the 
Church,
 any more than in a 
great Fa∣mily,
 that all should be equally good. In a great house there are Vessels of 
gold
 and 
silver,
 and some also of 
wood
 and 
earth;
 some for more creditable, some for less creditable uses 
(g;
 so it is not unsuitable to the state of the visible Church (God's great house) to have in it some 
Heretical,
 as other 
Orthodox
 profes∣sors. Which thing should stir up every one of us to en∣deavour to be of the number of the best. For if a man (through the assistance of grace) do labour to purifie himself from all pollution of error, and sinfulness of life (which these Heretical Teachers he speaks of were s
 tainted with), he will then manifest himself to be a 
vessel unto honour,
 sanctified and consecra∣ted to the service of the Lord, and meet for the Master's use, and fitted and made ready to perform all manner of good works. 
From Ver. 14, to 22.


5.
 He admonishes him to keep himself from those carnal affections which young men are most apt to be led away with, such as are n
t only 
love of pleasure,
 but 
rashness, contention, pride, vain-glory,
 which young Preachers too oft use to be infected with. And on the contrary, he advises him to pur∣sue after 
righteousness, fidelity
, 
charity,
 and concord and agreement with all them that worship God sincerely.


6.
 That he shun those idle and unprofitable questions which tend not to the promoting true Piety or Christianity, but engender strifes and contentions. For the servant of the Lord (who serves him in the Office of Teaching) must not be of a boisterous contentious spirit, but must be mild, and gentle, and calm, and ready to instruct others, dealing with much patien
e and meekness with those that oppose themselves against the truth, and are other∣wise perswaded than we are, and so trying
 whether it may not please God to bring them to a sight and sense of their sins, and to repent of them, and to an acknowledgment of the truth, that so they may recover themselves out of the snare of the Devil, by whom they were before captiva∣ted and enslav'd to do his will. 
From Ver. 22, to the end.


 He now prophetically admonishes and forewarns 
Timothy
 of those dangerous 
Seducers
 and enemies of the truth, that were even then arising, and should in after-times much more arise in the Church; charging him to have no com∣munion with such persons, but to avoid them. He tells him, that in the 
last days (viz.
 the time betwixt Christ's ascension and second-coming) many 
Monsters
 shall arise in the Church, who shall be guilty of many notorious vices and enormities. He particularizes no less than Nineteen. He says, they will be inordinate 
self-lovers, covetous, vain-glorious, boasters
 of their gifts and virtues, 
Rom. 1.30; proud,
 flying in the face of God himself with their wicked 
blasphemies,
 if he cross them. 
Rev. 16.9, 11, disobedient to Pa∣rents, unthankful, impure,
 and 
unholy; without natural affection,
 not re∣garding the very bonds of nature. 
Rom. 1.31. Truce-breakers,
 unfaithful in Covenants and Contracts; 
false accusers,
 loading the innocence of others with feigned calumnies; 
Incontinent, fierce,
 and bloodily di∣spos'd, 
haters
 and persecutors of all good men; 
Traitors
, that is, betraying their fellow-Christians into the hands of persecutors, 
Mat. 10.21,
 and 
24.9, 10. Heady
 and rash, 
high-minded
 and insolent persons, 
lovers of pleasure
 more than lovers of God; 
having a form
 or shew of godliness, but no way manifesting the power or efficacy thereof in their lives. Of this sort he shews they are, who creep into houses, and seduce weak and unstable 
women,
 laden with sins, and transported with divers lusts and passions, who out of their curiosity are

 always affecting something that is 
new,
 and accordingly seek after such Tea∣chers that may satisfie their curiosity; and though they give themselves up to be disciples to them, and pretend to be ever learning something of them; yet its impossible for them by such Teachers (who know it not themselves) ever to attain to the knowledg of the truth, or the right way of salvation. 
From Ver. 1, to 8.


The Apostle proceeds in describing these 
Seducers:
 He shews, that as 
Jannes
 and 
Jambres,
 the Egyp∣tian-Magicians, resisted 
Moses,
 and sought to render his miracles ineffectual, 
Exod. 7.11:
 so these resist the 
truth,
 and the saving-doctrine of the Gospel, and those that teach and maintain it; being men of corrupt minds, and such as have no right or sound judgment in the matters of faith, but such as ought to be rejected of all men. But he tells him, they shall not proceed much further to deceive, for their folly shall be made manifest, and they shall be dis∣covered to be 
Impostors,
 as those Egyptian-Magicians were. 
Ver. 8, 9.


As for 
Timothy,
 he tells him, Thou hast another pattern quite contrary to theirs. For thou hast been present, and hast often heard the 
doctrine
 I have taught; thou hast seen the way and 
manner
 wherein I order my life; thou hast known
 the 
scope
 and aim which I propounded to my self in my Ministry, and my 
faithfulness
 in the discharge of it; thou hast seen my enduring many neglects and affronts, before I would give over my endea∣vours to reduce impenitent sinners: thou hast seen my 
charity,
 and brotherly affection to all Christians, and my 
patience
 in bearing afflictions and perse∣secutions, as particularly those that came upon me at 
Antioch
 of 
Pisidia,
 Act. 
13.45,
 at 
Iconium.
 Act. 
14.2,
 at 
Lystra,
 Act. 
14.19:
 I say, thou hast seen what great persecutions I have endur'd, yet out of them all the Lord hath de∣livered me. And therefore be not thou discouraged when thou meetest with such tribulations. For this I foretell thee, That all that will live godly accor∣ding to the rules of Christ, shall meet with persecution, and must accordingly arm themselves with patience and expectation of it. But though 
evil men
 and 
se∣ducers
 will wax worse and worse, deceiving others, and being themselves de∣ceived; yet continue thou stedfast in that doctrine thou hast learned of me, and whereof thou hast been assured that it is the 
true doctrine
 of Christ, be∣ing delivered to thee by my self, who am an Apostle of his, and called imme∣diately by him, and who was taken up into the third Heaven, 
2 Cor. 12.2.
 And thou oughtest the more firmly to adhere to this doctrine, because from a child thou hast been instructed in the holy Scriptures of the Old Testament; which if thou do well understand, they will make thee wise to discern the 
right way
 of attaining eternal life, which is by faith in Christ Jesus the pro∣mised Messias, 
Joh. 5.39.
 And all those Divine Writings both of the Old and New Testament, being given by the inspiration of God,
 should be diligently read and considered by thee, there being contained in them that which is pro∣fitable 
to teach the truth, to convince of error, to correct evil manners, to instruct
 in righteousness, and to make the 
man of God,
 the Pastor of the Church, perfectly meet and fit for every part of his Office, and to furnish him with directions for the performing of every good work required of him. 
From Ver. 10, to the end.


He now gives 
Timothy
 a very solemn charge and exhortation, not know∣ing 
 but that it might be the last that ever he should give him. He charges him, as he will answer it before God, and Jesus Christ (who shall judg the quick and dead at that great and illustrious appearing of his, when he shall

 come in the Clouds gloriously attended with all his holy Angels, and when there shall be a full manifestation of his Kingly Power) to 
preach
 the word faith∣fully, to be 
instant
 with an holy importunity in 
season
 and 
out of season
 (that is, at such times and sea∣sons as were proper and appointed for it, yea, and at some that were not) that he labour to 
convince
 evil∣doers of their wicked courses, to 
reduce
 by reprehension those that are fallen, though not so foully and scandalously to 
exhort
 others to 
go on
 that have begun well; and all this with lenity and gentleness joined with sound instru∣ction. For he tells him, 
such times
 were coming wherein many would not endure 
sound doctrine;
 but having ears itching after novelties, and such things as might please their lusts, would seek after such Teachers as would gratifie their humour, 
Isa. 30.10.
 (and they would find many
 such), and by them they would be tur∣ned from the truth, and brought to believe fables and meer lyes. He advises 
Timothy
 therefore in such dan∣gerous times, to be very 
wachful
 over himself in all respects, and diligently to watch over those also whom he was to instruct, to 
endure
 afflictions coura∣giously, to do what belongs to an 
Evangelist,
 or a person intrusted by the A∣postles of Christ with the propagating of the Gospel 
[Eph. 4.11.],
 to labour to 
fulfil
 his Ministry, and to perform all the parts of it in such manner, that he may sufficiently evid
nce and prove that he is a faithful Mi∣nister of Christ. As for 
himself
 (he tells him), he was shortly to be offered
 up as a sacrifice to God, his blood was to be shed and poured forth, the time of his departure out of this world was at hand
. And he could mention it with joy and comfort, that he had (through grace) behaved himself faithfully in his Chri∣stian warfare; he had run his Christian race diligently, and was now almost come to the end of it. He had been faithful to Christ in his Office, and had not fallen off, nor made defection at any time from the 
faith
 which he had taught and profess'd, and therefore he doubted not but there was a 
Crown of Righteousness
 reserved for him, such as God of his free-grace hath promised to give his faithful servants, as a just recompence of their righteous and holy walking before him. And such a reward, he doubted not but Christ the righteous Judg would give him, in 
part
 at the day of his dissolution, but more 
fully
 at the last Judgment
. And not only himself, but all other faithful Christians also, may expect the same, who joyfully look and long for Christ's second coming, that they may then see him in his glory, who suffered so mu
h for them in this world, and may receive from him their everlasting reward. 
From Ver. 1, to 9.


In the Conclusion of his Epistle he desires 
Timothy
 to come to him with all the speed be could. And he should the rather hasten his coming, because 
Demas,
 who did assist him in preaching the Gospel, 
Philem. v. 24,
 and 
Col. 4.14,
 through worldliness had now forsaken him, and was gone to 
Thessalo∣nica.
 And as for 
Crescens,
 he had sent him to 
Galatia
 to preach the Go∣spel there; and on the same errand he had sent 
Titus
 to 
Dalmatia,
 and 
Ty∣chicas
 to 
Ephesus.
 By which means he was almost all alone at present, no body but 
Luke
 remaining with him, which made him the more to stand in need of his help and presence. And when he came, he should bring 
Mark (Barnabas
's Kinsman) with him, who he knew would be very useful to him there

 for the preaching and propagating of the Gospel. He orders him to bring him from 
Troas
 a 
Cloak
 that he left there, as also some Books (possibly the Volumes of the Old Testament, with some 
Jewish
 Commentators on them); but especially the 
Parchments
, wherein possibly he had written many things for the help of his memory.


He tells him, That 
Alexander
 the Copper-smith (probably that person mentioned 
Act. 19.33.
) had done him a great deal of wrong at his being there; but God will one day reward
 him according to his works. He advises him especially to beware of him, and to avoid him as an 
Excommunicate
 person [see 
1 Tim. 1.20.
], and as one that hath violently and vehemently opposed the truth and sincere preaching of the Gospel. He tells him, that at his 
first-Hearing
 be∣fore 
Nero
 the Emperor, or his Officers; all of his acquaintants that were able to have stood him in any stead, either by their power at 
Rome,
 or by their testi∣mony in his defence, through 
infirmity
 and 
fear of suffering,
 forsook him. He desires God to pardon them for it. Yet notwithstanding, God stood by him, and strengthned him, that his boldness and constancy 
in defending Christia∣nity in the face of all dangers,
 might be a convincing argument, that 
the preaching of the Gospel
 was not a thing carried on by man's power, but by divine assistance; and he was so wonderfully preserved, that the 
preaching of the Gospel
 might be more fulfilled by him, and that the doctrine of Christ might be spread into 
Nero
's Court, and among all those Gentiles of several Nations that frequented 
Rome.
 And for this reason he supposes it was, that God at this time so wonderfully delivered him from the imminent danger of death, and the cruelty of 
Nero,
 as out of the mouth of the Lion. Yea, he was confident, that God would still deliver him from doing any thing unworthy of an 
Apostle
 and 
Servant
 of His, or that might blemish his holy profession; and would bring him safe at last unto his heavenly Kingdom. To this only wise and ever blessed God he desires all honour and glory may for ever be ascribed. 
Amen.


He desires him to remember him kindly to 
Prisca
 and 
Aquilla,
 and the Family of 
Onesiphorus.
 As for 
Erastus
 and 
Trophimus,
 if he desires to know what is become of them, he tells him, That 
Erastus
 stay'd at 
Corinth,
 and did not come at all to 
Rome;
 but he left 
Trophimus
 sick at 
Mile∣tum
. He desires him again to make haste to him, and to come to him, if possibly he could, before Winter. He sends him salutations from several Christians there at 
Rome.
 He shuts up his Epistle with this accustomed seal [see 
2 Thes. 3.17.
], wishing that the grace of Jesus Christ may (as to its effects and sense) reside in his 
soul
 and 
spirit,
 to 
enlighten, sanctifie,
 and comfort him more and more. And the same he wishes to all the faithful that were with him at 
Ephesus. From Ver. 9, to the end.








SECT. XVI.


AND now we can trace this great Apostle 
Paul
 no further by any light the Scripture hath left us. Some learned men indeed hold, that (the 
two years
 being ended in which he was detained in Military custody, and taught the Doctrine of Christ at 
Rome
) he preached the Gospel up and down in 
Italy;
 and from thence went into 
Spain
 and the Western parts. And some hold, that he went into 
Greece
 and 
Asia,
 where for five or six years he confirmed and established the Churches he had before planted in those Countreys, and then returned to 
Rome
 again; where, on the 29 of 
June,
 in the 13 year of 
Nero,
 he was beheaded. 
Chrysostom
 in his 26 
Hom.
 on 2 
Cor.
 says, The day of his death was more certainly known than that of 
Alexander
 the Great. Vid. 
Ʋsserii Annales.
 But others think, that after his writing his second Epistle to 
Timothy
 (about which time it seems he had warning that his departure was at hand, 2 
Tim.
 4.6, 7, 8.), 'tis impossible to find out by any Scripture-light, what became of him; and 'tis no fault to be ignorant of that which God hath not thought fit to have revealed to us. Indeed he mentions in his Epistle to the 
Romans,
 ch. 15.24, his desire and intent to go and preach in 
Spain.
 But it seems he saw cause to change his resolution. For it appears that when he wrote his Epistle to the 
Hebrews,
 he intended very shortly (if 
Timothy
 came to him from 
Ephesus
) to go for 
Judea,
 Heb. 13.23; yea, to go to 
Philippi
 [Phil. 
ch.
 2. 
v.
 24.] and to 
Coloss
 [Philem. v. 22.]. Possibly the 
apostacy
 and 
wa∣vering
 he heard of in the 
Eastern Churches,
 caused him to think it more needful to go thither, than to go 
Westward.
 He expe∣cted indeed 
Timothy
 to come to him again to 
Rome;
 but whe∣ther they ever met and travelled together again, or what fur∣ther became of either of them, we cannot from any thing the Scripture hath left us, certainly determine.








SECT. XVII.


THE 
Apostle
 and 
Evangelist John,
 the son of 
Zebedee,
 and Brother of 
James,
 the 
Disciple
 whom the Lord so intirely loved [
Joh
 13.23.], wrote, as 'tis probable, about this time, his 
first Epistle
 (which only is 
Catholick,
 the other two being particular), from 
Ephesus,
 not long before the destruction of 
Jerusalem,
 as seems to be intimated 
chap.
 2. 
v.
 18. The occa∣sion of writing it, seems to be this: 1. He saw that many 
He∣retical Teachers
 and 
Seducers
 were risen up in that Age, some of whom denied the 
Deity,
 others the 
Humanity
 of Christ, or that he was appointed to be the Saviour of Mankind: These he calls 
Antichrists,
 as fore-runners of the 
great Antichrist,
 and arms those to whom he writes, against their Seductions. 2. He saw that many that professed Christianity, neither lived 
piously
 toward God, nor 
charitably
 with their Brethren; and he thought it needful to reprove these scandalous enormities, and to strengthen all true believers in the Christian Faith, and in a stedfast profession thereof; and to press them to holiness of life, and sincere brotherly love.


The parts of the Epistle are three:




1. The 
Preface
 or 
Introduction.


2. The 
Body
 of the Epistle.


3. The 
Conclusion.




1. THE 
Preface
 or 
Introduction;
 wherein he shews what was the 
sub∣ject-matter
 he intended principally to treat of in this Epistle, 
viz.
 the great 
Theme, Argument,
 and 
Matter
 of the Gospel, 
Jesus Christ.
 And, 
1.
 He intends to speak of his 
Godhead,
 which he sets forth by these phra∣ses. 
That which was from the beginning—the word of life—the life— that eternal life which was with the Father— 2.
 He speaks of his 
Huma∣nity,
 which he s
ts forth by these expressions, 
Which we have heard, seen, look'd upon,
 and 
our hands have handled.


He tells them therefore, that 
that Person
 who was in the beginning, and had a 
being
 before the beginning of the world, whom 
they
 (his Apo∣stles)

 had 
heard
 preach in 
Judea,
 whom they had 
seen
 with their eyes, and familiarly convers'd with, and their 
hands had touched
 both before and af∣ter his resurrection; 
Him
 they did now declare unto them; yea, whatever was needful to be known of the 
Word of life
, that is, of 
Christ Jesus,
 the 
Eternal Word
 of the Father, who hath 
life
 in himself, and communicates both 
na∣tural
 and 
spiritual
 life to all that partake of it. But here some might object, 
How could you see the Word of life?
 God is 
invisible; no man hath seen him at any time.
 He answers, 
they might see him:
 For 
that life, that eternal life
 which was with the Father
 from eter∣nity (being his Eternal only begotten Son, and a 
di∣stinct Person
 from him) was in the 
fulness of time
 manifested in the flesh; and we his Apostles saw him in his assumed human nature; and do now testifie, pub∣lish, and declare him unto you, that you may have com∣munion with us and other faithful Christians (and not with false Teachers), and that being 
in our communi∣on,
 you may partake with us of all those spiritual benefits and priviledges which Christ hath purchased for us; and you will have no cause to repent of coming into this sacred communion and fellowship. For we that have sincerely embraced the Doctrine of the Gospel, have communion with the 
Father,
 who 
in
 and 
through
 Christ is now our reconciled Father (having adopted us for his Children) and with his Son 
Jesus Christ;
 to whom being by faith uni∣ted, we are made partakers of his righteousness, and receive spiritual life and grace from him for the sanctifying of our natures. I write these things there∣fore unt
 you, to direct you into that way wherein you may have abundant matter of joy and comfort 
[Joh. 15.11.];
 so that you will be no losers by following my directions. 
From Ver. 1, to 5.


2.
 He comes now to the 
Body
 of the Epistle; wherein he exhorts them to the practice of holiness. He tells them, that this is the 
sum
 of the Gospel preached by Christ, which they his Apostles heard from him, and now testifie and publish, that 
God is light,
 that is, infinitely full of 
wisdom
 and 
pu∣rity;
 neither is there 
error, ignorance, falshood,
 or the least imaginable touch of impurity in him, neither can any impurity please him. Therefore whoever pretends to have communion with him (who is 
Light and Holiness
), and yet walks in the 
dark
 ways of sin and impurity, he is a 
lyar,
 and deals not uprightly, but denies in his works what he professes with his mouth. For what communion can there be between 
light
 and 
darkness?
 But (says he) 
If we walk in the light,
 that is, in the clear knowledg and light of the Go∣spel, framing our lives and conversations according to the pure precepts there∣of, and conforming our selves to God, who is 
light
 and perfect purity, and 
dwells in light glorious and inaccessible [1
 Tim. 
6.16.],
 and whose acti∣ons are all holy and pure; then we shall have 
fellowship
 one with another, 
we
 with him, and 
He
 with us; and being by faith united unto Christ, his blood cleanseth us from the guilt of all our sins both original and actual. But if we shall say or imagine, that we are so free from sin, that we need not the 
blood
 of Christ, nor his 
intercession,
 for the purging our consciences from guilt, we miserably deceive our selves, and there is no true judgment or discerning of things in us, but we glory in that which is a meer 
lye
 and falshood. But if we penitently confess our sins, and by faith have recourse to the merits and intercession of Christ for the pardon of them, God is so 
faith∣ful,
 that he will forgive us all our sins, according to his own gracious promise; and he is also so 
just,
 that he will not exact the debt from those for whom his Son hath satisfied, but will for his sake forgive us all our unrighteousness. If we should say therefore, that we have not sinned, or have not made our

 selves so guilty and so liable to eternal death, that we need such an expia∣tion as the death and passion of the Son of God, we should in effect give God the 
lye,
 and deny what he hath affirmed in his word, namely, That 
all men are sinners,
 and so need a Saviour; and thereby we shall shew, that the 
truth
 of God, as 'tis revealed in his word, is not received nor believed by us. 
From Ver. 5, to the end.


Now lest any, from what he before said 
(of God's readiness to forgive 
 sin to those who confess their sins, and fly to Christ for their pardon),
 should encourage themselves to sin freely and boldly; he tells them (giving them from the abundance of his love and paternal affection, and in respect of his age, the loving compellation of 
little children
)
, that his end and scope in writing these things, was to 
keep them off from sin,
 and to exhort them to use all pos∣sible care to avoid it. But if they have fallen, or shall fall through 
infirmity,
 or the 
violence of temptation,
 into any act of sin, then they should not despair, but consider (for their encouragement) that they have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ 
the righteous
 (whose perfect righte∣ousness renders him a fit and meet Intercessor for us, and who requires no∣thing of the Father in our behalf, but what is justly due to him upon the account of the merit of his death), and having offered up himself a Propitia∣tory Sacrifice for our sins on the Cross, his intercession now in Heaven must needs be of marvellous virtue. Nay, you may assure your selves, that his Sa∣crifice was of such infinite value and merit, that 'tis not only sufficient for the obtaining pardon for our sins who are 
Jews,
 but for the sins of the 
Gen∣tiles
 also, provided they repent and believe in him. 
Ver. 1, 2.


2.
 He comes now to shew, That 'tis not enough for them to profess they 
know
 Christ, except they yeild sincere obedience unto him. For this is the certainest 
mark
 and 
proof
 that we know Christ 
effectually,
 and have commu∣nion with him, If we so love him, that we sincerely endeavour to keep his Commandments. For he that boasts he knows him, and yet makes no consci∣ence to observe his commands, neither doth his knowledg work in him any en∣deavour to conform himself to Him in holiness and purity, that man is a 
great lyar,
 neither is there any truth or sincerity in him. But a conscientious en∣deavour to observe his 
word
 and 
commandments,
 is a great and sure argu∣ment, that 
in him that doth so,
 the 
love of God
 is grown to a high pitch, and a great evidence to himself that he is a 
true branch in Christ,
 and a true member of him. And whosoever professes to be one of his members, ought to imitate him in a holy life and conversation. 
From Ver. 3, to 7.


3.
 He exhorts them to 
sincere brotherly love.
 He tells them, 'tis no 
new
 
matter
 which he now injoin'd them, but that which they were taught not only in the 
Old Testament,
 but at the first preaching of the Gospel among them 
[Mat. 5.44. Joh. 15.12.];
 and what was so early taught them, may well be call'd an 
old Com∣mandment:
 I said (says he), it was an 
old Com∣mandment,
 and yet in some respects I may call it a 
new one,
 and so 'tis called by our Saviour himself, 
Joh. 13.34,
 because 'tis press'd in a 
new manner
 by Christ, and urged upon a new ground, and con∣firmed by his own example and special love, and imprinted in the hearts of believers by his own Spirit, according to the Promise of the New Covenant, 
Jer. 31.33.
 And there was in Christ a true and sincere love towards you
; and therefore you ought to look that there be a true and sincere love in you towards him. And this ought the rather so to be, because the 
darkness
 of ig∣norance which was formerly in the world, is now past, and the true light of

 the Gospel clearly shineth among you. He further presseth this duty from this reason, Because he that professeth himself to be 
in the light,
 and to know the truth, and yet hateth his brother, is in the darkness of ignorance and sin. For if the eyes of his understanding were clearly enlightned with Gospel-truth, his affections would be otherwise dispos'd. But on the contrary, he that 
truly loveth his brother,
 thereby eviden eth himself to 
abide in the light,
 and in the truth, and that the 
true light
 abideth in him. And whilst he thus walk∣eth in the light, he walketh inoffensively in a state of grace, and neither stumbleth himself, neither is there occasion given by him that others should stumble, or be drawn into any sin, or hardned in it. But he that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness; he goes on in sin, swerving from the right way that leads to salvation, and knoweth not whither he goes, nor how near he is to a precipice, and utter ruin, because his mind is dark∣ned with sin. He now directs his speech to those who were 
sincere Christi∣ans
 among them, and walked in the light (and to 
these,
 from his paternal affection, he gives the endearing-compellation of 
little Children
), telling them, That he gave them these ex∣hortations to 
brotherly love,
 because God hath been so kind to them, as to forgive them all their sins for Christ's sake; and therefore they ought, upon that ac∣count, to be ready to forgive one another, and to love one another. 
From Ver. 7, to the 13.


And now, says he, 
beloved Christians,
 suffer me to speak unto you as a 
Father
 doth to his Children, and distinguishing you according to your several ages, to address my exhortations and instructions particularly unto you. And 
first,
 Let me speak to you that are more advanced in age, and are, as it were, 
Fathers
 among the rest. 'Tis agreeable to 
your age
 to know 
ancient
 things; and seeing you have attain'd to a greater measure of knowledg than others, of 
the Ancient of days,
 the Eternal Son of God 
[Dan. 7.9, 13, 22.],
 I think fit to exhort you to make a good improvement of it. Let it be an engage∣ment upon you to love him more ardently, and to imi∣tate him more carefully. 
2.
 Let me speak to you 
young men,
 who are in the flower of your age, and the vigour of your strength; 'Tis agreeable to your age to be 
valiant Soldiers,
 and to be ambi∣tious of Victory and Conquest. Now seeing you have been enabled by God not only to fight valiantly against 
flesh and blood,
 but against the 
Devil
 and his temptations, and (through the assistance of grace) have overcome him, I exhort you to take especial care that he do not at any time surprize you, and so prevail over you. 
3.
 Let me speak unto you 
little Children.
 The first know∣ledg 
young Children
 use to have, is of their Father. They know their Fa∣thers before other men, and are more fond of them than of others: Seeing there∣fore you know your 
heavenly Father,
 I exhort you that you endeavour to ex∣press a very ardent affection to him, and to labour to please him, and to be obedient to him in all things. Again, I reiterate and re-inforce my exhorta∣tion upon you 
ancient men,
 to imprint it the deeper upon you: And so like∣wise on you 
young men
 also, because Christ hath endued you with strength from above (which is far more excellent than your natural strength), and hath put his 
word
 into your minds (which is the Sword of the Spirit, 
Eph. 6.17.
), whereby you have been inabled to overcome the 
evil one.
 Take you heed especially, lest at any time he prevail over you, and so deprive you of the glory of your victory. And seeing both 
old men,
 and those that are in their 
middle-age,
 are apt to 
love the world
 too much; let me exhort you all to take heed of all 
inordinate love
 of it, or of any of the things that are in it. For 
such a love
 of the world, and 
the true love
 of God, are inconsistent; because the 
one
 promotes corruption and sin, and the 
other
 sanctification and holiness. And you should consider, that 
all the things
 that are in the world (which

 can invite us to love them), are reducible to these 
three heads: 1. The lust of the flesh,
 that is, all corporeal delights and pleasures. 
2. The lust of the eye,
 that is, all visible possessions and riches, and outward estate. 
3. The pride of life;
 that is, all honours, pomp, high places, and advancements. And an inordinate affecting or lusting after these things, comes from the corruption that prevails in the world, and in worldly men; and not from the Father, unto whose holiness they are no way agreeable. And besides this, they should consider, that the 
World,
 and 
the things therein
 (that are so lusted after
), are but 
transitory
 and fading things, and soon pass away; neither can they give to those that most love them, any durable feli
ity. But on the contrary, they that set themselves to do the will of God, and to mortifie those inordinate lusts and affections to the things of the world, shall obtain eter∣nal life
. Lastly, He addresses himself again to those whom he before call'd 
little children:
 He intimates to them, that though 
covetousness
 and the 
love of the world
 is not usually found in that age, as it is in the two former; yet the 
weakness
 of their understandings, and 
want of sound judgment
 and 
discerning,
 doth commonly expose them to a danger of ano∣ther kind, and that is, 
to be seduced
 and drawn away by erroneous Teachers. And though there were many 
Seducers
 in former ages, yet he tells them, that now they will be more rife than ever. For this is 
the last time;
 The destru∣ction of the 
City,
 and 
Temple,
 and 
Polity
 of the Jews was now at hand. Ye have heard (says he) of a great and notorious 
Antichrist
 (the Prince of all Seducers) that shall come and appear in the world [see 
2 Thes. 2.3.
]; I tell you, 
He
 is not yet come; but there are sundry 
fore-runners
 of him come, such as will endeavour to draw men off from believing in Christ the true Messias, and will perswade them to believe lyes. And our Saviour him∣self fore-told 
[Mat. 24.11, 24.],
 that such Seducers as these would come, and advertised us of the time of their coming; and according to his prediction, there are now many 
Antichrists
 come into the world, 
viz. false prophets,
 who corrupt the Christian Doctrine; and being acted by such a 
Spirit of error
 as the 
grand Antichrist
 will be acted by, they may well partake of his name; and by their swarming now, you may know that the 
last time
 is come. And these 
Antichrists
 and 
false Teachers,
 he shews, once held external communion with Ortho∣d
x and faithful Christians; but they departed from their communion, and thereby de∣clared, that they never were sound members of that Body. If they had been of the 
same Faith,
 and had really believed the same truth, they would not have departed from them. But as for them, he tells them, he need not write much about this matter; for they had 
an Unction from the Holy One;
 that is, they were furnished with the gifts and graces of the 
illuminating
 and 
san∣ctifying
 Spirit of Christ, teaching them all things ne∣c
ssary
 for their salvation, and preservation from Seducers. Therefore his writing to them now, was not because he apprehended they were ignorant of the 
truth;
 but seeing they knew the truth, he was willing to con∣firm them in it; and he doubted not, but by their know∣ing the truth, they would be able to discern a 
lye,
 or a 
false doctrine
 from it, seeing it doth in no wise agree with it. A 
lye
 or 
falshood,
 he tells them, hath nothing of the nature of truth in it; therefore they will not easily receive the 
one
 for the 
other.
 Now he would have them consider, what Lye or Falshood can be equal to the denying of the great Truths of the Gospel? And who is a greater 
lyar
 and 
seducer,
 than he 
that
 denies Jesus to be the pro∣mised Messias? Whoever doth so, he tells them, is 
an Antichrist,
 and denies in effect both the 
Father
 and the 
Son.
 He denies the 
Son
 directly; he denies

 the 
Father
 by consequence, who testified
 of Christ by his voice from Heaven, and by Miracles; which testimony is not true, if Jesus be not the Christ. Therefore whosoever denieth the 
Son
 to be the 
Messias,
 or denieth his 
Person, Natures, Offices,
 or 
Merits,
 he is 
an Antichrist
, and denies as well the testimony of the 
Father,
 as the 
Mes∣sias-ship
 of the Son. And whosoever denieth the 
Son,
 cannot have the Father for 
his God,
 or 
reconciled Fa∣ther,
 seeing there is no reconciliation for 
fallen man
 with God, but 
in
 and 
through
 Christ. He advises them therefore, that what∣ever their temptations should be, they should not forsake the 
Doctrine
 which from the beginning of their Christianity they had received. To which if they firmly adhered, they should continue in the 
favour
 and 
love,
 and in the communion of God the 
Father,
 and of Christ Jesus his Son. And whatsoe∣ver hazzards they should run by so doing, they might comfort themselves with this, That He hath promised eternal life to all that continue in the faith and obedience of his doctrine. These things he tells them he had written to them, to arm them against the 
Seducers
 that were now among them. But he need not give them any other 
armature
 than what they had already. For the 
an∣nointing
 which they had receiv'd from Christ (
viz.
 the 
illumination
 of his Spirit) abiding in them, would teach them all things ne
essary to salvation. And they need not that any man should teach them any 
new doctrine,
 any 
new fundamental principles
 of Faith, as yet strange and unknown to them. They need no 
new Gospel
 or 
Doctrine
 for kind and substance, though they need more teaching in order to their growth and further improvement in real Piety and Christianity. Seeing therefore the 
Anointing
 which they had re∣ceived from the Spirit of Christ, instructed them concerning all things ne∣cessary to salvation, and seeing what it taught and suggested, was the 
very truth,
 and no lye; he was confident they would abide in Christ, and the pro∣fession of his truth. And now returning to speak to them all in general, he exhorts them to look to it, that they do 
abide in the faith of Christ,
 in his communion and doctrine, and thereby they shall have confidence to look him in the face, and not be ashamed to present themselves before him at the great and glorious day when he shall come to judg the world. 
From Ver. 13, to 29.

 He exhorts them to the sincere practice of righteousness, and to aban∣don all manner of sin and unrighteousness. For if they know and be sen∣sible (as sure they must needs be), that God
 is a God infinitely 
righteous
 and holy, they may well know also, that whosoever is born of him, and hath received a new and divine life from him, doth endeavour to live righteously, and thereby declares himself to be a child of his, and like unto him; and, 
as a son,
 may expect protection, and an inheritance from him. 
V. 29.


 He shews what a great and high favour it is, that 
true believers
 and 
righteous persons
 should both 
be,
 and also be 
accounted
 and 
acknowledg∣ed
 for the children of God, and should have the priviledges belonging to that state. 'Tis true, the world doth not acknowledg them for 
such,
 but mocks and jeers at them, because they pretend to it: And this is not much to be mar∣velled at; for, not knowing the Father, of whose Spirit they are 
spiritually
 and 
supernaturally
 begotten; and being ignorant of the holy nature of God, no wonder they acknowledg not those for his children who resemble him in holiness. But, says he, let the world judg what it will, the 
state
 and condi∣tion of us▪ that are true believers, is the 
state
 and condition of the children of God. We have at present the 
right
 of children, but what we shall be hereafter, and what shall be the glory of that inheritance that shall be made over to us, is not fully manifested: but this we know, that when that blessed time shall arrive when Christ shall come to judg the world, we shall then be

 made like unto him in 
holiness,
 in 
glory,
 and 
bliss
 (but with a different de∣gree from Him our Head), and he will enable us to see him in his transcendent gl
ry, which will be a beatifying-vision to us, 
Mat. 5.8.
 And whosoever hath a 
well-grounded hope
 in him of this glory, will (through the assistance of grace) endeavour to 
purifie himself from all pollution both of flesh and spirit,
 set∣ting Christ before him as his 
Pattern
 and 
Copy;
 and labouring to imitate him, though he cannot reach or arise to his perfect purity. However this he knows, that all 
sin
 is contrary to this purity. And whosoever follows not after 
righte∣ousness,
 but gaveth himself up to the commission of sin, transgresseth
 the Law of God, and so is disloyal and rebellious against the King of Heaven, and hath no reason to expect from him that glory and bliss before spoken of. Yea, such a person is not only a transgressor of the law of God, but he sets himself against Christ also, and vilifies his redemption. For Christ (in whom there was no sin) was manifest 
in the flesh
 to take away sin; the 
guilt
 of it by his blood, the 
power
 of it by his Spirit. Therefore who∣soever abideth in him, being united to him by a lively faith, giveth not up himself to a 
trade of sin
, nor liveth in a course of known sin
, 
deliberately
 and 
indulgently,
 walking after the flesh 
[Rom. 8.1.],
 and being a ser∣vant of sin, 
Rom. 6.17.
 Whosoever doth so, whatever he pretends, hath no 
right knowledg
 
of Christ,
 nor any 
true faith
 in him. For, says he, let no man de∣ceive you, and make you believe that a 
true faith
 may consist with an unholy and impure life. He that leads a godly and righteous life, and diligently exercises himself in all good works, doth shew plainly, and manifest, that he is a righteous man
, justified by faith in Christ's blood, and sanctified by his Spirit, and one that is in some measure like unto Christ himself in 
righteousness
 and 
ho∣liness
 (though not equal to him), having in him a 
sincere love
 of righteousness. But on the contrary, he that 
com∣mitteth sin,
 that is, giveth himself up to a course of sin, is a 
child of the Devil,
 and resembles him, who sinned at the beginning, soon after the Creation, and from that time hath ever since been a 
Tempter,
 inspiring by his sug∣gestions and temptations an inclination to sin, into the minds and souls of men. But the 
Son of Man
 was not only perfectly free from sin himself, but came into the world to 
destroy the works of the Devil, viz.
 to remove the 
guilt
 of sin to believers, and to free them from the 
punishment
 of it, by 
his merits
 and 
intercession,
 and to 
regenerate
 and 
sanctifie
 their natures by his 
Spirit,
 and so to destroy the do∣minion and power of sin in them. Therefore they that give themselves up to a course of sin, belong not to 
Christ,
 but to the 
Devil.
 For he that is 
born of God,
 and regenerated by his Spirit, doth not indulge himself in a course of sin, as carnal unregenerate persons do, because he hath a 
seed of grace
 re∣pugnant thereunto, remaining in him; and he cannot deliberately and freely allow himself in sin, because by the grace of regeneration the dominion of sin is broken in him. The 
new nature
 wrought in him by the 
word of God
, ac∣companied with his Spirit, is a principle that abhors sin, and fights against it. Therefore a 
course of sin,
 or delighting in sin, is unreconcilable with this state. In the conclusion of this discourse, he tells them, that by these 
two marks
 the chil∣dren of God may be manifestly distinguished from the children of the Devil: They that 
live righteously,
 and holily, and 
sincerely love their brethren,
 are the children of God; and they that 
do not,
 are of the Devil. 
From Ver. 1, to 11.




5.
 He cometh now to inforce his former exhortation 
o 
brotherly love,
 and useth many pathetical arguments to provoke them to it. 
1.
 He tells them, This precept concerning brotherly love, was given them by C
 and his Apostles, from the beginning of the preaching of the Gospel. 
2.
 The 
 Disciples of Christ must not be like wicked 
Cain,
 who was a child of the Devil, and a mur∣derer of his brother. And what mov d him to do this horrid wi
k
dness, but meer envy and ill-will, because he saw that God gave to 
Abel
 (who lived pi∣ously) a testimony that he was accepted with him, whilst his own sacrifice dis∣pleas'd him, because he lived wickedly: see 
Heb. 11.4.
 Therefore those that are real, pious Christians, need not wonder if the world hate them, seeing it was so from the beginning; but ought so much the rather to love one another, be∣cause the world hates them. 
3. Brotherly love
 is a good evidence
 we are regenerate, and passed from death to life. He that loveth not his brother, 
abideth in a state of sin and wrath,
 and is liable to eternal death. He that hateth
 his brother in his heart, and hath a desire to destroy him if he durst, is, in the sight of God, a 
murtherer
 of him. And he that is 
such,
 hath no 
spiri∣tual
 life (which is the beginning of the eternal) abiding in him, nor any right to eternal life and happiness, but is in a state obnoxious to eternal misery. 
4.
 He presses 
brotherly love
 from Christ's own example, who being 
God
 as well as 
Man,
 yet so loved us, that he laid down his life to redeem us. And we should, in imitation of him, be willing, in 
some cases,
 to hazzard our lives for the brethren [see 
Rom. 16.3, 4. Phil. 2.17.
], yea, to be ready to lay them down
, if the glory of God, the edification of the Church, and the eternal salvation of our brethren, do require it. And if we ought to be ready to do 
thus much
 (in 
some cases
) for them, surely we ought to do that which is 
much less, viz.
 to communicate to them of our worldly goods in their necessity, if we be able; and he that doth not 
so,
 how can he think there is any thing of 
that love
 in him, which God re∣quires. He tells them, real Christians should love in 
deed
 and 
truth,
 and not in word only. 
5.
 Hereby they will evidence themselves to be true and sincere Christians, who rightly under∣stand, believe, and live according to the 
truth
 of the Gospel; and their 
sincere brotherly love,
 will give their hearts and consciences great assurance, and peace, and tranquillity before God. And this is a great matter. For, says he, if our own hearts and consciences witness against us, and condemn us, that we 
do not sincerely love God and our Neighbour;
 God, who knows all things, and is greater and mightier to condemn than our consciences, will much more condemn us. But if our consciences (though they may accuse us of imperfe∣ction) yet do not condemn us of hypocrisie, or want of charity, then we have boldness and confidence towards God, that he will own us for his children, and will hear our prayers, and that we shall obtain those good things of him which we ask 
according to his will,
 because we are 
such
 as do endeavour (through his grace) to obey and observe his commandments, and to do the things pleasing in his sight. And this is his 
great commandment,
 that we believe in his Son
, and that we testifie the 
truth of our faith,
 by 
loving one another,
 according as he enjoined us when he was here upon the earth. He therefore that sincerely obeys these commands, hath such an intimate union with Christ, that he 
abides in Him
 as his Member, and Christ abides in him by the gracious operations of his holy Spirit. And the abiding of the Spirit of Christ in him by his gracious operations and assistance, is a plain and evident argument that 
Christ dwelleth in him. From Ver. 11, to the end.




6.
 Having mentioned the abiding of the Spirit of Christ in the hearts of 
 believers, in the last verse of the former Chapter; lest they should be deceived by such as pretended to be acted by this Spirit, but indeed were not; he exhorts them not to believe every 
Teacher
 that pretends to be inspired, nor his 
Doctrines;
 but to exa∣mine and try them, whether they be of God, and such as agree with his Word. And he tells them, they had need so to do, for many 
false Prophets
 and Teachers were now gone out into the world. He directs them therefore how to 
try the spirits:
 By this they might know a 
Teacher
 that was acted and inspired by the Spirit of God, from one that was not; 
Whatsoever spirit or Teacher doth own and acknowledg the Person of Christ,
 according to his 
Divine Nature,
 wherein he did exist from eternity; and according to his 
Human Nature,
 which he truly assum'd in his incarnation; and doth also seriously own him in 
all his Offices
 and at∣tributeth to him alone the whole glory of a 
perfect Saviour,
 this spirit is of God. And whosoever doth not confess Christ after this manner, but derogates from his 
Person
 or 
Nature,
 or 
Offices
 or 
Merit,
 or the 
virtue
 and 
efficacy
 of his Sacrifice, 
that spirit
 is not of God, but is the spirit of 
Antichrist;
 whi
h 
spirit,
 he tells them, is now abroad in the world, although it hath not yet so for prevailed, as to 
erect a Throne
 to it self openly in the Church. But as for them, he tells them, they being truly 
regenerated
 by the Spirit of God, and thereby enlightned with the knowledg of the true doctrine of the Gospel, need not fear being seduced by these false Teachers. For they had by their stedfastness in the true doctrine, already overcome the machinations and perswasions of such 
Impostors
 and 
Deceivers
 as have been among them, and have not been prevailed upon by them, as others have been. For Christ, who by his 
Spirit
 and 
Doctrine
 dwells in them, is greater and more powerful than the Devil (the Spirit of Error), who rules and domineers in worldly and unregenerate men, such as 
Seducers
 are. They commonly are worldly and sensual men, and their doctrine
 is agreeable to the corrupt humour and inclination of worldly-minded men, and therefore no wonder that the world readily bears them. But he tells them, Himself and the other Apostles were 
aught of God;
 they had their 
doctrine
 and 
call
 from him, and taught his 
truth;
 and those that truly know God as he hath revealed himself in his word, will 
hear them,
 and receive their doctrine; but those that are not taught of God, will not. And hereby me know (says he) in whom is 
the Spirit of Truth
 (namely, in such as hear us, and embrace our doctrine); and in whom 
is the Spirit of Error,
 namely, in those that refuse our Doctrine. So that by the Doctrine and Writings of the Apostles (as also of the Prophets and Evangelists), the 
truth
 or 
falshood
 of doctrines must be judged. 
From Ver. 1, to 7.


7.
 He resumes his exhortation to 
brotherly love,
 and urges it again with more arguments. 
1.
 This is not only strictly commanded us by God, but exem∣plified to us by himself, and it is a Grace highly pleasing in his sight. 
2.
 'Tis a certain sign we are regenerate by his Spirit, if there be in us a true love to God and our Neighbour. 
3.
 'Tis an evidence we have a right know∣ledg of God, both of his 
Nature
 and 
Will,
 and what he requireth. He that hath not this grace in him, hath no true knowledg of God, whatever he pre∣tends. For God is 
love it self
, and full of loving-kindness and tender compassion to the children of men. And in this he highly manifested it towards us
, in sending his Son into the world, that we, and all those that believe in him, might obtain eternal life 
through him.
 And in this appeared the height of Gods love to us, not that we first loved him, and so by our loving him, moved him to love us (for we were by nature enemies to him); but he first loved us, even when there was nothing in us

 to deserve his love, and freely sent his Son to offer up himself a propitiatory Sacrifice for our sins, and to deliver us from the punishment due to them. And if God so loved us, we ought to imitate his love in loving one another. 
4.
 He shews, no man hath seen God at any time, or can see him with his bodily eyes; he is not so to be seen or convers'd with. But if we find this 
grace
 of love in our hearts, 'tis certain then that God abideth in us by his Spirit; and 
our love to our Brethren
 is a 
ertain evidence that 
love to God
 is perfectly formed in us, and brings forth effects agreeable to its nature; or 'tis a sign that our love to him is 
perfected
, that is, manifests it self to be 
sincere
 [see 
chap. 2.5.
], and to have all its essential and needful parts, though it be not perfect in all degrees. And hereby (says he) we know that we remain and abide in the 
savour,
 and 
love,
 and 
protection
 of God, and that 
He
 dwelleth in us, because he hath given us of the 
gifts
 and 
graces
 of his holy Spi∣rit, and particularly 
that of love.
 But (says he) though we that are Apostles have not seen God with our bo∣dily eyes, yet this we have seen, and do testifie to all men, That God the 
Father
 sent his Son to be the Sa∣viour of the world, that is, not of the 
Jews
 only, but of the 
Gentiles
 also. Whoever therefore by a true and lively faith relying on Christ for eternal life, and wit∣nessing his faith by his love and other good fruits
, shall confess that 
Jesus
 is the Son of God, 'tis certain that God dwelleth in him by his Spirit, and that he remaineth in the 
love
 and 
favour
 of God. And we Apostles having certainly known and firmly believed the great love that God hath manifested towards us, do with all assurance give our testimony thereof to the world. Nay we testifie, that 
God is love
. He that abideth in the sincere exercises of love to God and his Neigh∣bour, abideth and continueth in the love and favour of God, and God dwelleth in him by the graces and com∣forts of his holy Spirit. And in this is our love known and manifested to be sincere, and to have attained to some excellent degree and height
 (so that we may think of appearing at the day of judgment with boldness), if, as Christ was in the world 
full of love,
 and 
holiness,
 and 
purity,
 so we labour to be also, imitating his holy example. And by 
this love,
 as by a 
certain sign,
 we may be perswaded, that we are of the number of those who shall escape condemnation at the day of judgment. For there is no ground for them to fear condemnation (which fear is joined with torment) who truly believe in Christ, and testifie their faith by their sincere love to God and their Neighbour. For such a perfect or sincere love
 cast∣eth out this tormenting-fear, this fear of wrath and Hell. But he that is under those apprehensions and fears, cannot love God with such a perfect and sincere love as others do, whose hearts are delivered from those fears. And truly (says he) we that believe in Christ, have reason to love
 God with our highest and best affections, for he loved us first, when we were 
enemies
 and 
sinners,
 and had deserved nothing but hatred and vengeance from him. But possibly every body will say, 
I love God.
 He answers, That whosoever saith, 
He lo∣veth God,
 and yet 
hateth his brother,
 is plainly a lyar. For 'tis impossible 
truly to love God,
 and not to do what God com∣mands; and one thing which he strictly commands, is, that we 
love our Bro∣ther.
 And if we do not exercise love to our brethren with whom we daily

 converse, and whose 
persons, state,
 and 
condition,
 we see and know; what reason is there to imagine we do sincerely love God, when of our love to him, and the sincerity of it, we were never able to make this trial, because we never saw him, nor had opportunity offered us of shewing any real acts of love to him, otherwise than by obeying his commands, whereof this is one, That if we love him, we should testifie it by loving our brother also. 
From Ver. 7, to the end.


He proceeds to shew, that the 
love of God,
 and 
of the children of God,
 
 must needs go together, there being so near a relation between them. For they that are spiritually begotten of God, and brought seriously and savingly to be∣lieve in Jesus Christ as the true Messias, they so love God, that they love his children also. They cannot truly love the Father, but they must needs love the Children in whom they see his Image. And there is such an union and conjunction between these two, that if we would know whether we love our Brethren sincerely or no, we cannot better judg of it, than by examining whether we truly love God. For otherwise, we may do many acts of kind∣ness to our Brethren which may flow from other principles (as good nature, credit, 
&c.
) and not from such a charity as manifests and expresses it self by ende
vouring to keep God's commandments. For this is the love that God requires of us, and hereby we shall evidence that we do 
indeed
 love him, if we faithfully endeavour to keep his Commandments. And his 
Commandments
 to the 
Regenerate
 are not grievous, because of the gracious assistance afforded to them by the Spirit of God. 
Love,
 and 
hope of reward,
 and 
the assist∣ance of the Spirit,
 will make things that are difficult to flesh and blood, easie and delightful. And he that is born of God, abideth constant in his Christian profession, notwithstanding all worldly allurements, temptations, or op∣positions to the contrary. And that which enables him thus to overcome the world (which is so apt to draw away the heart from God), is not any power of nature, but 
faith in Christ,
 from whom he receives strength to do it. So that 
faith
 is the instrumen∣tal Cause of this victory, and Christ (in whom he be∣lieves) is the Principal. And if they enquire what faith this is which is so victorious: He tells them, 'tis a 
lively
 and 
effectual faith,
 resting on Jesus Christ as the eternal Son of God. 
From Ver. 1, to 6.


He comes now to prove, That Jesus is the Christ, that he is truly 
God
 and 
Man,
 and the true Messias that was to come into the world to be the Sa∣viour of mankind. This he proves by many arguments: 
1.
 Because Christ is the 
substance
 of the ancient types, and by him was really fulfilled what was represented by the legal and ceremonial 
washings by water,
 and by 
the blood
 of the Expiatory Sacrifices. He came 
by his Spirit,
 as by water, to sanctifie those that believe in him, and 
by his blood
 to make a full atonement for their sins. An admirable symbol of both which, was the 
flowing of water and blood
 out of his side on the Cross. 
2.
 He sheweth, the Spirit beareth witness to this in the Consciences of the Regenerate; and this testimony being the testimony of the Spirit of God, is authentick, and fit to be believed: For he is the Spirit of truth
, and cannot possibly bear witness to a lye. 
3.
 There are 
three
 in Heaven
 that bear record or witness to this, That Jesus is the Christ, 
viz.
 the 
three persons
 in the holy Trinity, who (being 
one
 in Essence) consent in bearing witness hereunto: 
1.
 The 
Father
 at the 
Baptism
 of Christ 
[Mat. 3.17.],
 and his 
transfiguration [Mat. 17.],
 with an audible voice pronounced, that he was 
his beloved Son in whom he was well pleased. 2.
 The 
Word
 bears record of himself, affirming it often,

 plainly and directly, and making it manifest by his 
doctrine
 and 
miracles,
 that he came from the Father, and faithful
y de
lared his couns
l conc
rning the true and only way wherein he would s
ve sinners, 
Joh. 5.
6.
 and 
ch. 6.40. 3.
 The 
Spirit
 bears witness to this, partly by his d scending on Christ at his Baptism in the shape of a Dove, and partly by desc
nding on his Apostles and Disciples on the day of Pentecost [
Act. 2.
 see also 
Heb. 2.4. Joh. 15.26.
]. And as there are 
three
 in Heaven that b
r t
stimony to this▪ so there are 
three
 on earth that lik
wis
 testifie the same. The 
Spirit,
 the 
Wa
er,
 and the 
Blood
: 
1.
 The 
Spirit
 in the preaching of the G
sp
l, testi
i
s▪ that Christ is the Son of God, and perswades the hearts of men to believe in him [see 
1 Joh, 5.10.]. 2.
 The 
Water▪
 or Sa ram
nt of Baptism, testifies this also; for we are baptiz
d in the Name of the 
Father, Son,
 and 
Holy Ghos
. 3.
 The 
Blood,
 or the Martyrdom of some of the Apostles, and other Conf
ss
rs of Christ, s
aled this truth. And so these 
three
 lik
wise agree in this 
testimony,
 That Jesus is the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world. Now, if for the believing of any thing, it be ordinarily thought suff cient to have the testimony of 
two
 or 
three
 creditable men 
[Deut. 17.6.],
 surely God's testimony from Heaven is much more worthy of belief. And this testimony now produc
d, 
That Christ is the Son of God,
 is evidently the testimony of God. He therefore that truly believes on Christ as the Son of God, and the true M
ssias, need not fear any thing, having the testimony of the Father 
without
 him, and the in∣ward testimony of his Spirit 
within
 him, to secure him. And he that after all this, when God hath so plainly testi∣fied of his Son, 
that he is the tr
e M
ssias,
 does still refuse to believe it, and consequently to have recourse to him f r life and sal∣vation, he does in effect accuse God of a lye, b
c
use he r
j
cts his testimony as if it were not true. And the sum of God's testimony concerning his Son, is this, That he hath given a 
right
 to eternal life to all th
se who truly believe in him, seeing he hath by his Merits procured it for them
, and by his Spirit sanct
fying their natures, he sits them for it. So th
t he that hath a real inte∣rest in the Son of God, and is by a lively faith uni∣ted unto him
, and hath 
his
 Spirit dwelling in him, hath eternal life 
b
gun
 in him; he hath an earnest of it in his soul; he hath a 
right to it,
 and is as sure of attaining of it hereafter as if he were already pos∣sessed of it. But he that hath not embraced the Son of God by a true and lively faith, hath none of these. He tells them. He had written these things to those among them who were 
true believers,
 that they might know (to their comfort) that they had a 
right
 to eternal life, and that they might put forth 
stronger acts
 of f
ith and affiance in Christ, and might always 
persevere
 therein, and never be tempted to fall off for any pers
cu ions whatsoever.


H
 further shews them, what a great advantage 
they
 have who truly be∣lieve in Christ; for they may have this confidence in their approaches to God by prayer, That whatsoever they shall ask 
according to his will
 (asking it in faith, 
Jam. 1.6.
), they shall obtain it of him. And if this 
of God's hear∣ing our prayers
 (when they are 
thus qualified
) be universally true, then in proportion it must needs be true of every parti
ular petition which we have or shall put up to him. We may be confident we shall obtain
 th
se petitions 
in his time,
 and 
in that manner
 and 
way
 that he s
es best for us. H
 instances in 
one particular;
 If a man see his fellow-Christian sin a sin which is not

 
unto death,
 that is, which doth not certainly bring damnation (though it de∣serves it) as 
the sin against the Holy Ghost
 doth, but whereof remission may be obtained; and he pray to God for him (that God would please to give him repentance), he shall be heard in the thing he desires, and God will please (upon his repentance and faith in his Son to give him eternal life. But he tells them, There is a 
sin
 which certainly brings eternal death and dam∣nation along with it, and that is 
blasphemy against the Holy Ghost,
 when any one denies the truth of the Christian Doctrine, concerning which he hath been enlightned and convin
ed by the Holy Ghost, and maliciously blasphemeth and persecuteth the same, 
Mat. 12.31.
 For such sinners, he w
uld not that they should pray, seeing God never intends to forgive them, but leaves them to a final impeniten
y and hardn
ss of heart, by reason that they reject the only means of salvation, which is the Sacrifice of his Son. And though all unrigh∣teousness and transgression of the Law, be sin, and s
 d
s
rves death; yet 
eternal death
 and 
damnation
 doth not follow upon all sin, because all kind of sin is pardonable except 
this,
 to them that truly r
pent and believe in Christ. But as for 
this sin unto death,
 he tells them, that he 
that is born of God
 doth not fall into it, nor 
so
 sin, that sin hath 
dominion
 over him, but he keepeth himself (through the assistance of grace) that the Devil (who seeketh to bring him to this) shall not be able to wound him with so deadly a stroke.
 And as for us (says he) who believe in Christ, we know we are truly 
regene∣rate,
 and 
born of God;
 but the generality of the world disowning Christ, lyes in sin and wickedness, and under the power of the Devil. And we are assur'd, that the 
Son of God
 is come into the world, and hath sa∣vingly enlightned us to know the true and living God, the Father of our Lord Jesus, whilst he suffers a great part of the world to continue in their natural blindness, worshipping false Gods, and serving stocks and stones. And further, we have ground to believe, that we are in the 
favour
 and 
love
 of this only true God, being his adopted children,
 having obtained this great mercy 
in
 and 
by
 his Son Jesus Christ, who is the very 
true God,
 and the Author, Purchaser, and giver of eternal life to all that truly believe in him. 
From Ver. 6, to 21.


He concludes his whole Epistle, giving them this s
rious caution and ad∣vice, That seeing the 
Church
 was environed on all sides with the Idolatry and Superstition of the 
Gentiles
 that owned not Christ, and 
some
 that had taken on them the name of Christi
ns, did many times join with them in their Hea∣thenish Worships, and seduced others also to join with them therein; therefore they should take heed to themselves, and keep themselves from all 
Idolatry, Su∣perstition,
 Image-worship, sacrificing to Idols, frequenting Idol-feasts, 
&c.
 these things being inconsistent with the worship of the true God, and real Christianity. 
Ver. 21.








SECT. XVIII.


THE 
Second
 Epistle of 
John
 was written to an eminent Religious 
Matron
, and one (as it seems) of great Estate, and a great Reliever and Supporter of the Members of the Church in her days.


The Parts are,




1. The 
Preface.


2. The 
Contents of the Epistle.


3. The 
Conclusion.




IN the 
Preface
 he stiles himself the 
Elder,
 in respect of his great age and office in the Church. He addresses his Epistle to an eminent 
Gentlewo∣man
 (whom, for those eminent graces and virtues that shined in her, be judges 
elect
 of God); and to her 
children,
 who had been religiously educated by her, all whom he professes sincerely to love, as did all others also thereabout, who had been brought to a saving-knowledg of the Gospel, and had effectually en∣tertained it. And the ground of his sincere and cordial love to them, he shews was this, That they had embraced the same 
Gospel-truth
 with himself, and other faithful Christians; and he was confident they would always abide and remain in the sincere belief and profession thereof. To this 
Lady
 and 
her chil∣dren
 he heartily wishes an 
encrease of grace,
 and an abundance of 
mercy
 and 
peace
 from God the 
Father,
 the Fountain of all blessings, and from Je∣sus Christ his 
Son,
 the Conduit-pipe by which they are conveyed; and par∣ticularly, that they may continue constant in the profession of the 
Truth,
 and in the exercise of 
Love
 to one another. 
From Ver. 1, to 4.


2.
 He comes to the 
Contents
 of the Epistle; and in the 
first place
 he tells her, it was matter of great joy to him, that he had found of 
her chil∣dren
 that had not only taken on them a profession of the truth, but walked in it, so that their conversation was framed according to the commandment which they had received from the 
Father,
 by the 
Son [1 Joh. 15.15.]. And this is his command, That we believe in his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, 1
 Joh. 
3.23.
 He tells her, 
the main thing
 he had to request of her was, That with the profession of the Gospel she would constantly join the practice of Christian charity, that so they may all live in unity, peace, and concord. Which was no 
new
 
commandment
 of his, but that which him∣self and the other Apostles had in charge from Christ strictly to enjoin, and to oblige all Christians unto, even from the beginning of their call to be Apostles and Preachers of the Gospel. And by this, says he, shall we make it appear that there is a true 
love
 of God in us, if we endeavour to frame our lives

 according to his commandments 
ow this, he tel
s them, is the 
great com∣mandment,
 wh
 they 
rd fr
 the beginning, when the Gosp
l was first preached unto 
 s
ld 
believe in Christ,
 and 
love one ano∣ther,
 and should 
on
ly 
pers
 in the pr
ctise of these duties, walking in the 
truth,
 and 
 
love.
 He shews he had reason to press them to 
con∣stancy
 herein; for ma
y 
Im
os
ors
 were come abroad [see 
1 Joh. 4.3.
], who will not own or 
knowl
dg that 
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh,
 and so subvert the very foundation of Chri
ianity: And whos
ver doth so, he tells them is a 
deceiver,
 and one of those 
Antichrists
 of whom he spake, 
1 Joh. 2.18.
 Therefore he advises them to look to themselves, that they con∣stantly 
persevere
 i
 the 
true faith,
 and in sincere obe∣dience to the Gospel, that so they may not lose
 the fruit of the faith they have hitherto prof
ssed, or of the 
affli∣ctions
 which for Christ's sake th
y have suffered, or of the works of 
piety
 and 
charity
 which they have per∣formed; but continuing faithful to the end, may receive a competent reward and crown. He further declares, That whosoever transgresseth by teaching or receiving a doctrine contrary to the Gospel, or apost
tizeth or fall
th off from the Orthodox prof
ssion, not abiding in the do∣ctrine of Christ, hath not the Spirit of God in him, nor is in his favour, nor shall partake of his glory. Wh
reas he that abideth stedfastly and constantly in the belief and profession of the doctrine of Christ, he hath the 
Spirit
 of the 
Father
 and the 
Son
 dwelling in him, and remaining in their savour and love; see 
1 Joh. 2.24.
 He forbids them therefore all familiarity and fellow∣ship with such 
Seducers,
 and not to entertain them when they come to their houses under pretence to instruct them, nor so much as courteously to salute them, or shew them any respect; that so they may manifest a dislike and dis∣approving of 
their Errors.
 For he that doth not discountenance them in their errors (whereby others are seduced to their great p
ril
, doth in a sort encourage them, and so partakes with them in their sins. 
From Ver. 4, to 12.


In 
Conclusion,
 he excuses the shortness of his Epistle, telling this Lady, That he hoped to come shortly and s
e her. And though he had many things to write, yet all things were not fit to be written, and besides, a lively Voice affects more than a Letter. And he hoped at their meeting they should be fill'd with mutual joy at their s
eing one another, and c nferring together. And so with salu
ations from the Children of h
r gracious Sister (who manifested her 
election
 by her holy conversation) he shuts up his Epistle. 
Ver. 12, 13.








SECT. XIX.


THE Third 
Epistle
 of 
John
 was directed to his beloved 
Gaius.
 We find three persons of this name in the Scripture; 
1. Gaius
 of 
Macedonia, Act. 19.29. 2. Gaius
 of 
Derbe,
 Act. 
20.4. 3. Gaius
 of 
Corinth,
 whom 
Paul
 (writing from 
Corinth
 to the 
Romans
) calls his 
Host,
 and 
the Host of the whole Church,
 Rom. 
16.23.
 This man being eminent for his hospi∣tality (especially to the Ministers and Members of the Church of 
Corinth
), seems to be the person to whom the Apostle now addresses this Epistle.


And in the 
first place
 he assures him, That he loved him sincerely, and accordingly wished unto him, that as he had a 
healthful soul,
 endued with the knowledg of sound doctrine, and with the manifold graces of the Spirit of God; so he might also have a 
healthful body,
 and that all his outward 
conc
rns
 might suc
eed prosperously. He tells him, he had r
ceived a very co
end
ble testimony of his sincerity and uprightness, and of the 
agreeable∣ness
 of his conversation to the Gospel which he professed from the Brethren w
 h came from him, and who had tasted of his liberality; which gave him gr
at 
se of rejoicing and blessing God in his behalf For there was nothing did more comfort or rejoyce him, than to hear that h
 Dis 
les (whom he had begotten to Christ through the Gos
 l) did walk in the 
Truth.
 He tells him, he did as became a faithful and si
cere p
s ss
r ki
dly to enter∣tain poor Christians, and especially those strangers t
at had 
 lately with him, who coming to 
Ephesus,
 had openly born witness of his 
charity
 in the publick Assemblies of the Church. These possibly mig
 be some 
faith∣ful Ministers,
 who came from beyond 
Corinth
 to the Apostle f
r 
advice,
 and preached the Gospel by the way, whom 
Gaius
 had very kindly entertained, and the Apostle adviseth him to do so again at their return, and to accom∣pany them s
me part of the way, and to furnish them with necessaries for their journey as became his Christian profession, and his great piety towards God. And there was great reason he should do it, because it was on Christ's errand (that is, to preach his Gospel) that they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles, to whom they preached, for their pains. 'Tis necessary therefore, he tells him, they should be received by some. And they that shall receive them, shall thereby have the comfort of having 
co-operated
 and contributed their part towards the propagating the Gospel of Christ. And to this purp
se he had written to the Church there (whereof 
Gaius
 was a member), 
viz.
 to give relief and succour to such faithful servants of Christ; but 
Diotrephes
 (a Presbyter
 in that Church), who exalted himself above his brethren, and lorded it over them, and sought to draw all respect to himself, regar∣ded neither him nor his Letters, nor acknowledged his Authority. For which contempt (he says) if God give him an opportunity to come thither, he will use some severity towards this 
ambitious As
ector of Pre∣eminence
 (according to the authority God had given him), who was not content to slight the Apostle, and prat
 against him with malicious words, and to reject the Christian Jews himself that came thither; but he would not permit the Gentile-Christians to receive them to their communion. And if any among them, being m
ved with charity or respect to the Apostle or his Letters▪ have had a mind and

 inclination to receive them, he prohibits them; and if they do it, he either rejects them, or threatens to 
reject
 and 
cast
 them out of the Church. He advises 
Gaius
 therefore, not to be an 
imitator
 of this evil example of 
Dio∣trephes,
 but to exercise kindness to the Jewish Christians. For he that sin∣cerely endeavours to do good, and to be merciful, shews himself to be of a Christian temper, and to be born of God; but he that is 
malicious,
 and 
proud,
 and 
uncharitable,
 hath no true saving-knowledg of God, whatever he pretends. He acknowledgeth, that 
Demetrius
 (a Gentile-Convert) hath a very good report for 
Piety
 and 
Charity,
 feom all the faithful that know him. Yea, he says he hath done many things that more fully testifie the same of him, than the report of men can do. And the same testimony the Apostle himself, with others, did give of him also. And thou knowest (says he) that I am not wont to affirm things which are not true. In conclusion, he excuses his writing so short an Epistle to him, seeing he hoped shortly to see him, and to speak much more to him than now he had written. And so concludes with his Apostolical Valediction and Salutation.


The End of the
 Apostolical History.










SECT. XX.
 Containing a short History of the Destruction of 
JERUSALEM.


HAVING thus, by the good Providence of God (to whom alone be all the glory and praise thereof in∣tirely rendred 
in
 and 
through
 Jesus Christ), finished my 
Apostolick History;
 I thought it requisite, for the clearing of many passages in 
this History,
 as also in the 
Gospels,
 to add a short Narration of the dreadful Destruction of the 
City
 and 
Temple
 of 
Jerusalem.
 And first, I will set down the 
prodigious
 and dreadful Sights
 that preceded the Warr that brought on this fatal Desolation; and then shew the 
Occasion
 of it.


The 
Prodigies
 related by 
Josephus
 were these: Not long be∣fore the Warr, on the day of 
Ʋnleavened bread,
 about nine of the clock at night, between the 
Altar
 and the 
Temple
 there shined such a 
light,
 that it might have been thought to be 
mid-day,
 which continued half an hour. In the same 
Feast
 also a 
Cow
 that was led to sacrifice, brought forth a 
Lamb
 in the middle of the Court of the Temple. The East gate of the Temple, which was Brass, and mighty heavy, and could scarce be shut with twenty men, and at evening was lock'd up, and barr'd with barrs of Iron, was seen (about six of the clock at night) to open of its own accord. On the 21 of 
May,
 before Sun-set, were seen in the air 
Iron Chariots,
 and Armies in battel-array passing along in the Clouds, and be∣gitting the City. And in the Feast of 
Pentecost,
 the Priests going into the inner Temple, according to custom, to celebrate the Worship of God, at first they found the place to move, and heard a noise; and afterwards they heard a voice, which said, 
Let us depart hence.
 A Blazing-star in fashion of a Sword, hung over the City for a year together: See 
Har. of the Four Evangelists,
 chap. 5. p. 168. And thus much of the 
Prodigies
 that preceded the Warr. I come now to shew the 
Occasion
 of it.


The 
Occasion
 of the Warr that brought that fatal ruin and destruction upon the City of 
Jerusalem,
 and the 
Jewish
 State,

 was this: 
Florus
 being sent by 
Nero
 to succeed 
Albinus
 in the 
Procuratorship of Judea,
 being a vile and wicked person, outra∣giously abused his Authority, and by all manner of Rapines and Insolencies vex'd and oppressed the 
Jews;
 insomuch, that by a 
publick Cryer
 he gave leave to 
Thieves
 and 
High way-men
 to rob and spoil throughout the whole Countrey, provided he himself might have part and share of the booty. The 
Jews
 not able to endure these Outrages, some of them abandoned their houses, and fled to strange Countreys. Others of them (being of themselves forward enough to revolt) were yet greatly provoked thereunto by the daily oppressions of 
Flo∣rus,
 who endeavoured to drive them to it, that his great and intolerable Oppressions and Villanies might be lessened by their Revolt. Another thing also that much dispos'd them thereunto, was this: There was a Pro∣phecy
 passed among them 
[That there should come from Judaea those that should be Masters of all].
 The event afterwards shewed, that this was a Prediction only of the 
Roman
 Emperor. But the 
Jews
 applying it to them∣selves, revolted; and so Christ's blood lying upon them, and crying for vengeance, they themselves hastened that vengeance by their own Madness. The Warr began in the 
Twelfth year of Nero,
 in the Month of 
May,
 who was then in 
Grecia,
 and stayed there till Winter.


King 
Agrippa
 (who had under his government 
Galilee, Tibe∣rias, Tarichea, Julias
 beyond 
Jordan,
 with the neighbouring-Villages, and 
Chaleis
), in a long Oration dehorts the 
Jews
 from warr, but in vain. For a little while after he was gone from 
Jerusalem,
 some of the 
Seditious
 possessed themselves, on a sudden, of the strong Castle 
Massada,
 and put to the sword all the 
Ro∣mans
 they found there. At 
Jerusalem
 also, 
Eleazer
 the son of 
Ananias
 the High-Priest, and Commander of the Soldiers of the Temple (a bold and factious young man) perswaded the Priests that they should not offer any more the Sacrifices that were wont to be offered for 
Caesar,
 and the welfare of the 
Romans.
 Which rash act, the Governours of the City (that were peaceable men) plainly saw tended to open rebellion. Whereupon, not being able to perswade the 
Seditious
 from this course, they sent Messengers to 
Florus
 at 
Caesarea,
 and to King 
Agrippa;
 desiring them; that they would presently send Forces and suppress the Rebellion in the beginning. 
Florus,
 who de∣sired there should be a Revolt, neglected it. But King 
Agrippa
 sent a thousand Horse-men, who together with the Rulers and Priests, and the rest of the people (that loved peace), seized upon and held the upper City against the Seditious, who kept the Temple, and the lower City. Between these two parties there were continual skirmishes for seven days together. After some ado the 
Rebels
 brake into the upper Quarters, burnt divers Palaces and publick Houses, and then besieged the Castle

 
Antonia,
 and after two days took it, and kill'd all the 
Roman
 Soldiers they found there, and set the Castle on fire. After this, they lay siege to the King's Palace, which they took and burnt; and upon the very 
Sabbath-day
 put to death the 
Romans
 who (after the Palace was won by assault) had retired into the Ca∣stles of 
Hippico, Phasaelus,
 and 
Mariamne;
 where, being besie∣ged, and yeelding upon composition, and delivering their arms, yet contrary to all faith they were put to death.


On the day following
, at 
Caesaria,
 most of the 
Jews
 that dwelt there, were mass
cred at the instigation of 
Florus,
 by the 
Roman
 Soldiers, to the number of Twenty thousand; at which the 
Jews
 through all the Countrey were so enraged, that they wasted the Villages of the 
Syrians
 and Neighbour-Cities. Then the 
Syrians
 fell upon the 
Jews,
 and executed their rage upon them; partly out of the old hatred 
against them
 and 
their Religion;
 and partly out of love of Plunder, and desire of revenge. Only they of 
Antiochia, Apanea,
 and 
Sidonia,
 spared the 
Jews
 that dwelt amongst them. But at 
Alexandria
 (the Me∣tropolis of 
Egypt
) upon a Sedition that was raised there, in one day Fifty thousand 
Jews
 were killed by two 
Roman
 Legions that were let in upon them 
Cestius Gallus,
 President of 
Syria,
 having notice of these Commotions, comes from 
Antioch
 into 
Judea
 with twelve Legions, and takes with him also some of King 
Agrippa
's Soldiers; and having taken some Towns, sate down at last before 
Jerusalem
 at the Feast of Tabernacles. The men of 
Jerusalem
 oppose him; but he forceth them into the City, into which also he brake, and held the lower part of it. Then he assaults the 
Temple,
 and the Upper-City, and had ea∣sily taken it if he had valiantly continued the assault, the soberer sort of the people favouring the 
Romans,
 and the 
Seditious
 only opposing him. But when he was near taking the Temple, without any sufficient reason he drew off, and retreated to 
An∣tipatris
, having lost in his March many both 
Romans
 and 
Auxiliaries,
 with a great part of his Baggage and Ammunition, by the 
Jews
 who pursued him. The 
Jews,
 puffed up with this Victory, being returned to 
Jerusalem,
 create 
Joseph
 the Son of 
Gorion,
 and 
Ananias
 the High-Priest, 
Governours
 of the City; and send away Commanders into the several Provinces, and among others they send 
Joseph
 (the Writer of this Warr) into 
Galilee;
 where after he had fortified many Towns, and ordered all things to endure a Warr, he expected the invasion of the 
Romans.
 In the mean time there are many Commotions and

 Attempts of several of the Cities against him; and by the sub∣tilty and fraud of 
John
 the Son of a certain 
Levite
 (of whom more afterward), and by the envy of some of the Gover∣nours of 
Jerusalem,
 there were endeavours us'd to turn him out of his Government. But 
Joseph
 brake the neck of all these Endeavours and Counsels, and by his Prudence and Patience defeated them, and forced 
John
 to flee to 
Jerusalem.
 At 
Jeru∣salem, Ananias
 the Governour of the City prepares all things necessary for sustaining the Warr; He repairs the Walls, and takes order that warlike Instrum
nts, viz. 
Darts
 and 
Arms,
 &c. be made through the whole City. He endeavours to reconcile those they call'd 
Zealots
 (because they boasted of their zeal for the Law of God, and the Customs of their Countrey) but in vain; he endeavours to apprehend 
Simon
 Son of 
Giora
 (who exercised Thievery, and affected Tyranny) by sending Soldi∣ers against him. But 
He
 with his Party fled to the Thieves that k
pt 
Massada,
 from whence they infested all the Countreys of 
Judea
 and 
Idumea
 with their Robberies.


Things going on in this manner, 
Cestius
 sends M
ssengers to 
Nero
 who was th
n in 
Achaia
 entertaining himself with Tra∣gedies and the 
Olympick
 Sports, declaring unto him the trou∣bled state of 
Judea. Nero
 being much moved with this News, sends 
Vespasian
 thither. 
Vespasian
 having received this Com∣mand s
nds his Son 
Titus
 to 
Alexandria
 in 
Egypt,
 to bring from th
nce the 
Fifth
 and 
Tenth
 Legion into 
Judea;
 and he himself goes by land from 
Achaia
 into 
Asia,
 and from thence comes into 
Syria
 At 
Antioch
 he gathers together the 
Roman
 Forces, with other Aids from the Neighbouring-Princes, and to marches to 
Ptolemais
 where his Son 
Titus
 met him sooner than could have been expected by reason of the Winter season All their Forces, with their Auxiliaries, being now come together, made 
Threescore thousand Horse and Foot. Nero
 now returning to 
Rome
 in 
 m
ant manner, a
ter he had been two years in 
Greece; Julius Vindex,
 a 
Gaul
 by birth, but of Senatorian-de∣gree among the 
Romans,
 incensed his Countrey-men against him, representing what great and intolerable burdens they groaned under. Yet he designed not to advance himself to the Principality, but offered it to 
Galb
 an old Soldier, and now Gov
rnour of the 
Tarraconian
-Province in 
Spain;
 who accep∣ted of it. 
Vesp
sian
 in the mean while invades 
Galilee,
 and burns and wastes the City of the 
Gadarens;
 then coming to 
Jotapata
 on the 21 of 
May,
 he lays siege to it; after forty days siege, he takes it by force, and burns it, after it had been valiantly defended by 
Joseph,
 who was Governour thereof. He also takes 
Joseph,
 who 
 y hid in a Cave, gives him his life, but keeps him Prisoner
. 
Jotapata
 being thus destroyed, 
Vepasian
 retires with his Army to 
Caesarea,
 and th
re places 
Two Legions
 to refresh themselves after the siege; a 
Third
 he sends, for the same reason,

 to 
Scythopolis.
 At 
Caesarea
 he is feasted by King 
Agrippa
 for twenty days together: There he prepares for the Sieges of 
Ti∣berias
 and 
Taricha.
 They of 
Tiberias
 immediately yeild, and at the entreaty of 
Agrippa
 'tis granted to them, that the City shall not be razed. But 
Taricha,
 after it had suffered a siege, is taken by storm. These Cities being recovered, almost all 
Galilee
 en∣clin'd to the 
Romans,
 except 
Gamala
 and 
Gascala,
 which was kept by 
John,
 and the Mountain 
Itaburium. Gamala,
 after a Months siege, was taken; and not long after, the Mountain 
Itaburium. Titus
 sets upon 
Giscala,
 which was kept by 
John
 with his party of 
Zealots. John
 seems to like the Conditions of Peace offered him by 
Titus,
 but in the night with his party slips out of the City, and betakes himself to 
J
rusalem. Titus
 spares the City; and, putting a Garrison into it, goes to 
C
∣sarea.


In the mean time there was a great dissention throughout all 
Judea,
 some being for 
warr,
 others desirous to live in peace under the protection of the 
Romans.
 Whereupon Troops of Thieves gathered together, who plundered them that were de∣sirous of peace; and being loaded with their Plunder, they were received into 
Jerusalem,
 and there fill'd all things wi
h Murthers, Discords, and Rapines. And first, they cast 
Antipas
 and a great many Noble-men, and the chief of the City into prison, and shortly after put them to death without any 
rial; falsly accusing them, That they intended to deliver up t
 City to the 
Romans.
 Moreover they kept all the Passes, and seized those that endeavoured to get out of the City; and, killing them, let them lye unburied.


During these troubles, the 
Zealots
 fell out among themselves: 
John
 (who came from 
Giscala
 to 
Jerusalem
) affecting the Sup
remacy, and others not enduring him to be their Superior. But though they thus disagreed among themselves, yet they were unani∣mous enough in 
obbing the people; and all 
Judea,
 after the example of 
Jerusalem,
 was full of Thieves, and most miserably vexed.


The 
Jews
 by these discords thus inhumanly destroying each other; 
Vespasian
 was entreated by the cryes of some of them (who fled to him) to take some course to preserve their Coun∣trey from ruin. Hereupon he prepares to go against 
Jerusalem.
 And that he might leave no
hing behind him that might trou∣ble 
m when he was at that siege, he comes with his Army to 
Gadara
 to quench the tumults there, and presently takes the City, the Seditious flying away; which he understanding, he sends 
Placiaus
 with his Horse to pursue them, and to put them to the sword; and so he possess'd himself of the Countrey be∣yond the River, even to the Lake 
Asphaltis,
 except the Castle of 
Macherun;
 and so having appointed Garrisons for the seve∣ral Towns, and Winter-quarters for his Soldiers, he comes to 
Caesarea
 again, and there winters.


Vespasian
 hears now of the stirrs raised in 
Gallia
 by 
Vindex,


 who had armed the 
Gauls
 against 
Nero,
 and the 
Romans;
 which made him more earnest to finish this Warr against the 
Jews.
 Wherefore in the beginning of the Spring, he runs with his Army thorow all 
Judea
 and 
Idumea,
 and miserably wastes it. Then leads them thorow 
Samaria
 to 
Jericho,
 from whence the Inhabitants flye into the 
Mountain-Countrey
 opposite to 
Jerusa∣lem;
 but he pursues them and beats them from the Hills, and by placing Citadels at 
Jericho
 and other places, distresses the 
Jews
 on every side.


Nero
 hearing that 
Galba,
 and 
Spain,
 had revolted from him, pronounced himself undone; and at last slew himself to escape publick and more shameful execution, on the 9th day of 
June,
 in the 13th year of his Reign.


The Soldiers in 
Spain
 proclaim 
Galba
 Emperor, against whom rises up 
Otho,
 and cuts him off in his 7th Month. 
Otho
 was scarce set in the Throne, when 
Vitellius
 riseth up against him, and 
Otho
 is kill'd the 90th day of his Reign. 
Vitellius
 is now 
Lord of all,
 a luxurious and most intemperate person.


But to return to 
Vespasian,
 who as he was now with his Ar∣my preparing to besiege 
Jerusalem,
 news is brought him of the death of 
Nero.
 Upon which tidings he defers the Warr against the 
Jews,
 and sends 
Titus
 his Son to 
Galba
 (who he heard was proclaimed Emperor), to know his pleasure concerning the Jewish Warr. 
Titus
 going by ship to 
Achaia,
 heard there that 
Galba
 was killed. Whereupon he presently returns to his Fa∣ther at 
Caesarea,
 they being in suspence (the Empire now totter∣ing) what to do, thinking it not convenient to invade a strange Countrey, when their own was in such apparent danger.


In the mean time 
Simon
 the Son of 
Giora
 (of whom before) a bold young man, went from 
Massada,
 whither he had fled to the Murderers, in the Mountainous Countrey of 
Judea,
 and by promises of liberty to servants, and rewards to 
Free-men,
 in a short time got a band of Thieves, and by little and little en∣creasing his Forces, he came at last to that power, that he con∣quered all 
Idumea,
 and wasted 
Judea,
 and at length came be∣fore 
Jerusalem;
 where pitching his Tents, he became a terror both to the Inhabitants of 
Jerusalem,
 and to the 
Zealots
 also; and thus were the Citizens of 
Jerusalem
 grievously oppressed on both sides, 
within
 by the 
Zealots
 whom 
John
 commanded; and 
without
 by 
Simon.
 In the mean time the 
Idumeans,
 who were of 
John
's party, and were among his forces, falling at variance with him, and the matter coming to blows, they kil∣led many of the 
Zealots;
 and then taking 
John
's Palace, and burning it, forced him with his party into the Temple; but then they fearing (as also did the Citizens) lest by night he should make an excursion into the City, and burn it, they upon consultation send for 
Simon,
 and admit him into the City, that they might defend themselves against 
John.


Vespasian,
 during these stirrs, hearing of 
Otho
's death, began to think of freeing his Countrey from the Tyranny of 
Vitellius.


 Many of his Commanders earnestly perswaded him to take the Government upon him. 
Tiberius Alexander
 the Governour of 
Egypt,
 was the first that swore the Legions to him on the Ca∣lends of 
July,
 which day was afterwards kept as a Festival. Shortly after, the Jewish Army swore Allegiance to him; so that there was but one year and twenty two days, between 
Nero
's death, and the beginning of the Reign of 
Vespasian.


Vespasian
 (the Armies in several Provinces declaring for him) now leaves 
Caesarea;
 and sending 
Mutianus
 with Forces into 
Italy,
 to oppose 
Vitellias,
 himself goes to 
Alexandria
 to make sure of 
Egypt.


In 
Maesia, Antonius Primus
 who held for 
Vespasian,
 leads the third Legion into 
Italy
 against 
Vitellius,
 and in the fight at 
Cre∣mona
 against the 
Vitellians,
 he routs them, and puts them to flight. Then coming to 
Rome,
 and joining his Forces with 
Mutianus
 in the midst of the City, he overthrows 
Vitellius
's Army; and taking 
Vitellius
 himself, and dragging him thorow the Market-place, there cuts his Throat, after he had held the Government eight Months and five days.


Vespasian
 hearing these things at 
Alexandria,
 sends his Son 
Titus
 with Forces into 
Judea,
 to finish that Warr; but he him∣self saileth into 
Italy.


The City of 
Jerusalem
 was at this time divided into a three∣fold Faction: For 
Simon,
 whom the Citizens had admitted in, kept the higher City; and 
John
 with his 
Zealots
 possessed the outward Courts of the 
Temple,
 and the lower City. And 
Elea∣zer,
 who was once Captain and Commander of the 
Zealots
 (envying 
John,
 who by his boldness and subtilty had got the power into his hands, and did all things at his own pleasure) withdrawing himself, and getting some Soldiers along with him, possessed himself of the 
inner
 part of the Temple, and from thence fights against 
John.
 And so 
John,
 who held the outward Circuit of the Temple, and the Porches, was forced to fight both against 
Eleazer
 and 
Simon.
 During these stirrs, many things about the Temple were burnt up, and the Provisions destroyed which might have served them a long time, and for want of which they were sorely oppressed with Famine after∣wards, when besieged by the 
Romans.


Titus,
 in prosecution of his Father's Orders, comes from 
Alex∣andria
 to 
Caesarea,
 where gathering his Forces together (which were 
Four Legions,
 with the Aids and Auxiliaries of the Neigh∣bouring-Kings), marches towards 
Jerusalem
 accompanied with 
Tiberius Alexander
 (who was in principal favour with him), and 
Joseph
 the Jew, who for the truth of his prediction that 
Vespasian
 should be Emperor, was now released out of bonds. He sate down within six or seven furlongs of the City, a little before the Feast of the 
Passover,
 and by that means shut up an infinite number of men, who had (according to custom) come up to the Feast. And hereby all provisions were consumed in a very short time, and a most cruel Famine oppressed them On

 the day of 
Ʋnleavened-bread
 (April 14.), 
Eleazar
 (who kept the inner part of the Temple) opened the Gates to the people who desired to sacrifice; but 
John
 taking hold of this opportu∣nity, treacherously sent many of his party in among them (with swords hid under their Garments), who killing 
Eleazar
 and many of his Faction, seized also on that part of the Temple; and hereby the Three 
Factions
 were reduced to Two; that under 
John
 consisted of 8400, and the other under 
Simon
 of 10000 fight∣ing-men, besides 5000 
Idumeans.
 And notwithstanding the Ene∣my was at the Walls, they brake out, the one upon the other, and the poor people suffered miserably under both. The City being fortified with three Walls on every side, but where it was fenced with deep Valleys, 
Titus
 having with much opposition placed his 
Engines
 and 
Rams,
 battered the outermost of them, and made a breach in it; at which entring, and the Jews reti∣ring inwards, he possessed himself of the North-quarter of the City, even to the Castle 
Antonia,
 and the Valley of 
Cedron.
 Five days after, he brake with his 
Rams
 the Second Wall, and entred; but the Besieged making divers Salleys, repulsed him, and beat him out again. Four days after, he recovers the place again▪ and prepares for the bittering the Third Wall. He now sends 
Joseph
 the Historian to perswade them to yeild; but he is entertain'd only with scoffs and reproaches. Many of the peo∣ple thinking to escape out of the City, 
John
 and 
Simon
 stop up all passages. Yet the Famine encreasing, many made shift to get out, who being taken by 
Titus,
 he caused them to be cru∣cified On the 12th of 
May
 he began 
Four Mounts,
 wherein to place his Battering Rams; Two, near the Castle 
Antonia,
 by which he hoped to take the Temple; and the other Two near the Monument of 
John
 the High-Priest, where he thought he should with most ease break into the upper part of the City. 
John,
 who was to oppose the 
Romans
 in the former place, cast down the Mounts that were near his Quarter, and two days after 
Simon
 did as much by the other, though seventeen days had been spent in making of them. He destroyed also many Rams and Engines, and brake into the very Camp of the 
Ro∣mans,
 but was repell'd and forc'd into the City again. 
Titus
 now calling a Council of Warr, 'twas therein resolved to com∣pass the whole City with a Trench, which with incredible di∣ligence and celerity was finished in three day
; they built also thirteen Forts to hinder the flight of the Besieged, and to hin∣der the conveyance of any relief into the City.


The 
Seditious
 were nothing herewith moved, though 
Famine
 not only raged among the common sort, but themselves also were pressed by it A certain 
Noble Woman
 sod her Child to eat it; and such a Mo
tali
y ensued, that from the 14 of 
April
 to the first of 
July,
 were carried out to be buried at the publick charge, an incredible number of Carkasses of the poorer sort, as 
Titus
 was told by one 
Mannaeus,
 who was appointed to pay the money. And some others certified him, that many thousands of the ordinary

 sort were cast dead out of the Gates; and because they could not carry all out, they cast them in great heaps together into empty houses, 
others
 they threw over the Walls, filling up the Ditches with them.


Simon,
 notwithstanding all these calamities, abstained not from Murthers and Rapines, but kill'd 
Mathias
 the High-Priest (by whom he had been let into the City) with his three Sons, and sixteen of the Noblest of the people, pretending that they purposed to flee to the Enemy. 
Judas,
 one of his own Cap∣tains, hating his cruelty, attempted to betray a certain 
Tower
 (whereof he had the charge) to the 
Romans;
 but his design being discovered, he was put to death, with ten other of his Complices. 
John
 also, in these extremities, converted to his own, and prophane uses, the holy things of the Temple, as Vessels of Gold, and Silver, and the Money of the Temple; nay, he was compell'd to distribute to his Soldiers the very Oil and Wine ordain'd for Sacrifices.


Titus,
 in pursuit of his design, cut down all the Groves near the City, and brought in the Timber to make Forts and Engins for the siege, and causing more Mounts or Scaffolds to be made, on the fi
st day of 
July
 he began to batter the wall of the Castle 
Antonia,
 by which a breach being made on the fifth day after, they entred the Castle, and pursued the flying-Jews even unto the Temple. At this time many 
false Prophets
 (suborned by the 
Seditious
) flattered the multitude with expectation of assistance from God; and therefore though 
Titus
 often exhorted them to yeeld, yet they flatly refused. The 
Romans
 now pressing hard towards the Temple, the Contest was earnest on both sides. After a long skirmish, the 
Romans
 breaking in by 
Antonia,
 sei∣zed upon the North and West Porches of the outward Range of the Temple; part of which Porches (especially that which was join'd to 
Antonia
) was burnt and overthrown by the 
Jews;
 and two days after, the other part was burnt by the 
Romans,
 the Jews being so amaz'd, that they endeavour'd not to quench it. 
Titus
 had an intention to have sav'd the Temple; but on the tenth of 
August
 a certain Soldier 
without
 any command (nay, 
a∣gainst
 the command of his General), moved as by instinct from above, cast a flaming fire-brand into the Chambers and Build∣ings of the North-side of the Temple, which immediately taking fire, burnt the Temple also which joined to them, notwithstand∣ing all that 
Titus
 could do to prevent it. And this happened on the same day of the same Month on which the former Temple was set on fire by the command of 
Nebuchadnezzar.


The Temple thus burning, 
Titus
 was saluted Emperor by his Soldiers, and the 
Zelots
 and 
Seditious
 fled into the Upper City call'd 
Sion.
 They now desire a parley with the 
General
 himself, who check'd them for their obstinacy, but promised them life if they would yeeld to him. They being unwilling to com∣mit themselves to his Mercy, requir'd to depart the City with their wives and children, and to go into the Wilderness.

 
Titus
 being enraged at these Proposals, threatens them with ut∣ter destruction, and forthwith commands all the lower City to be set on fire. Then he began to assault the Higher City, which was seated on a steep Rock. And beginning to raise his Mounts on the 20th of 
August,
 and perfecting them on the 7th of 
Sep∣tember,
 he brings his Engines to the Walls, wherein having made a breach, the 
Seditious
 through fear and amazement deserted their strong Towers, and so on the 8th of 
September
 the 
Romans
 brake in and destroyed all with fire and sword. 
Titus
 now com∣mands both the City and Temple to be utterly razed to the foun∣dation, and to be laid plain, and a 
Plough to be brought over it,
 according to custom, which was done by 
Turnus Rufus;
 and so the Prophesie was fulfilled, 
Zion shall be plowed as a field,
 Mic. 3.12. Only the West part of the Wall, with three Towers, for their strength and beauty were preserved, to bear witness of the state∣liness of the City to posterity.


Of those which during the whole Warr were taken Captives, the number amounted to 97000: and of those that perished in the siege, to 1100000. So heavy was the guilt that lay on them for the death of Christ, and so horrid were the enormities com∣mitted by them, that 
Josephus
 says, 
If the Romans had delayed to come against them,
 he thought 
the City would either have been swal∣lowed up of the earth, or have perished by Thunder-bolts and Light∣ning from Heaven, and so have suffered like Sodom;
 the Inhabi∣tants whereof they exceeded in wickedness. See 
Josephus
 toward the end of his sixth Book.


And thus fell this famous City on the 8th day of 
September,
 in the second year of 
Vespasian,
 He and 
Titus
 his Son being 
Con∣suls,
 38 years after the death of Christ, whose blood cried for vengeance against these obdurate Jews.


That this dismal destruction of 
Jerusalem
 is set out 
Mat.
 24, as the destruction of the whole World, need not seem strange if we consider, that it was the destroying of the Lord's own 
Ha∣bitation,
 and the 
place
 chosen by Himself above all the places in the world, to put His Name there, and the destroying of the State and Polity of the Jews, who were his 
old peculiar peo∣ple;
 A people once highest in his favour, now deepest in his dis∣pleasure: formerly the people of his highest dignations; but now their casting off was sealed by the ruin of their 
City
 and 
Temple,
 their dispersion and scattering abroad among other Na∣tions, and their great obduration.


Titus
 having thus ended the Warr, returns to 
Caesarea,
 and from thence to 
Antiochia
 in 
Syria,
 and then into 
Egypt,
 and thence sails to 
Rome,
 where he was welcomed home by all men, and (together with his Father) triumphed for the Conquest of 
Judea.


The two Captains of the 
Seditious, John
 and 
Simon,
 who had hid themselves, were taken, and reserved to be led in triumph, and 700 other Jews that excelled in beauty and strength; of all whom only 
Simon
 suffered death. The 
LAW
 also of the

 Jews was carried in this Triumph as the 
last of the spoils,
 which together with the 
Purple Veils
 of the Sanctuary, were laid up in the Palace.


From this Victory both 
Father
 and 
Son
 got the Name of 
Em∣peror;
 yet neither of them had the Title of 
Judaicus,
 although many other Honours, especially 
Triumphal Arches,
 were decreed unto them.


A year after, 
Lucilius Bassus
 was sent Lieutenant into 
Judea,
 who receiving the Army from 
Cerealis Vitellianus,
 took the Ca∣stle 
Herodian
 and 
Macharua
 beyond 
Jordan.


Not long after, 
Vespasian
 wrote to 
Tiberius Maximus
 to 
sell all the Land of the Jews;
 upon whom, wheresoever they lived, he imposed a yearly Tribute to be paid into the 
Capitol,
 viz. the 
Didrachma
 or half Shekel, it being that they were wont to pay in former times unto the Temple at 
Jerusalem.


A year after, 
Publius
 succeeds 
Bassus,
 and finishes the Warr, taking the strong Castle of 
Massada
 from 
Eleazar,
 the Nephew of 
Judas Galilaeus
 the Captain of the Thieves. All the Thieves in the Castle (to the number of 900, with their Wives and Children) at the perswasion of 
Eleazar,
 set fire on the Castle, and the Fur∣niture thereof, and then put each other to death, lest they should fall into the power of the 
Romans.
 And so the Warr in 
Judea
 ended.


Many of the Thieves that escaped from 
Judea,
 fled into 
Egypt,
 to 
Alexandria,
 and there they sollicited the Jews to revolt; but the common people taking 600 of them, delivered them up to the 
Romans
 to be punished. 
Vespasian
 having notice of these things, commands 
Lupus
 the Governour of 
Alexandria,
 that he should pull down the 
Jewish Temple
 that was there built long ago by 
Onias
 the Brother of the High-Priest; which he neglect∣ed to do, but only spoiled it of some of its Consecrated things, and so shut it up. But 
Paulinus,
 his Successor, having spoiled it of all its gifts, made an Order that none should presume to come to it; and so he put an end to the exercise of the Jewish Religion there, 343 years (as some compute) after that Temple was first built by 
Onias.


A certain Jew, a Weaver, 
Jonathan
 by name, escaping to 
Cy∣rene,
 drew 2000 Jews to follow him into the Wilderness, pro∣mising to shew them 
signs
 and 
wonders;
 but by the chiefest of the Jews the matter being discovered to 
Catullus,
 Governour of those parts, he sent Soldiers, who slew most of them; and not long after, 
Jonathan
 himself was taken, who accused the most wealthy of the Jews (unjustly) to have had a hand in this Insurrection. To whose accusations 
Catullus
 willingly giving ear, put 3000 of them to the sword. And this he did with the greater confidence, be∣cause he confiscated their Estates to 
Caesar
's use. 
Jonathan
 he sent prisoner (with others that were taken) to 
Vespasian,
 that he might accuse the most honest of those Jews that lived at 
Rome
 and 
Alex∣andria,
 as if they had held correspondence with him; yea, he af∣firmed, That 
Joseph
 the Writer of the Jewish History, sent to him

 both Arms and Money. But 
Vespasian
 looking upon this as a false accusation, upon 
Titus
's entreaty acquitted these men, and deser∣vedly punished 
Jonathan,
 whom having whipped, he burnt alive. 
Catullus
 at present escaped through the mildness of the Emperor; but not long after, fell into grievous anguish of mind, and imagi∣ned he saw the Ghosts of those men he had so unjustly slain before his eyes. At last his 
guts
 and 
bowels
 issuing out of him, he died miserably.


Here 
Josephus
 endeth his History of the Destruction of 
Judea.
 But his 
Jewish Antiquities
 he finished not till the 
Thirteenth
 of 
Domitian,
 when he was Fifty six years old, as himself testifieth at the end of his Work.


I shall conclude all with an hearty Prayer to God for the 
Conversion of the Jews,
 and the 
Ʋnion of all Christians.


O
 LORD, the Father of Mercies, let not thy indignation al∣ways burn against thy 
ancient people,
 nor cast them off for ever. Though the blood of thy dear Son, our blessed Saviour, lies heavy upon them, and hitherto thou hast justly hardned them; yet be pleased, of thy infinite mercy, to open their eyes, to unstop their ears, to mollifie their hearts, and to cause them to 
mourn over him whom their fore∣fathers pierced.
 Cause them to understand those 
Sacred Oracles
 which thou didst commit to their keeping; that our 
Saviour,
 who hath long since been 
a light to lighten the Gentiles, may,
 in thy due time, 
be the glory of thy people Israel;
 that so there may be but 
one Sheepfold,
 as there is but 
one Shepherd.
 For the speeding of their conversion, be pleased to compose the many 
differences
 that are among 
Christians;
 and so unite their disagreeing-affections, that our examples may no longer discourage, but may invite them to em∣brace our Lord and Saviour, and his blessed Doctrine. Cause thy 
Truth,
 O Lord, to shine forth gloriously and triumphantly, as the Sun at noon∣day; and let it dispel the thick mist of darkness and error that hath overspread so many Nations of the world; set up thy 
pure Worship,
 and thy 
own Institutions
 every where; and throw down 
Idolatry
 and 
false worship
 where-ever it prevails. Break the yokes of 
oppression
 and 
violence,
 and rebuke the spirit of 
profaness, impiety, intem∣perance, ungodliness;
 and let 
holiness, righteousness, brotherly-kindness,
 and 
charity,
 prevail where-ever the Gospel of Christ is owned and professed. Ʋnite all Christians in those things that are the main 
fundamental
 Principles of the Christian Religion; and give them 
charity
 and 
mutual forbearance
 of each other in less important matters. Let all that name the Name of Christ, make conscience to depart from all iniquity, and live as becomes his disciples and ser∣vants. Grant this, O Lord, for thy own great Mercies, and our dear Saviour's Merits sake; To Whom, with thy Self, and Holy Spirit, be all Honour, Glory, Praise, Thanksgiving, and Sincere Obedience, ren∣dred now and for evermore. 
Amen.


Glory be to God in the Highest, on earth peace, good-will towards men.
