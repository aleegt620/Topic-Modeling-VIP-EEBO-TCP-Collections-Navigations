LETTERS
Write to a Friend,
By the Learned and Judicious
Sir 
Andrew Balfour,
 M. D
CONTAINING
Excellent Directions and Advices
For Travelling thro'
FRANCE 
and
 ITALY
With many Curious and Judicious Re∣marks
and Observations made by Him∣self,
in His Voyages thro' these Coun∣treys.


Published from the Author's Original M. S.


EDINBURGH,

Printed in the Year, M.DCC.














To the Most Illustrious,
Most Potent, and Noble EARLE,
ALEXANDER
Earle of Murray,
Lord Doun and Abernethy, &c.


Sometime Lord High COMMISSIONER,
And Principal SECRETARY of State
For the Kingdom of Scotland.


My Noble Lord!


IN all Ages, discerning and
serious Men, who knew best
to allow and distinguish things
and Persons, have made it their
great Complaint, That the pre∣sent
Generation did degenerat


from the former; And that
the Generality of Men were
too apt and ready to pursue
bad Courses: And some think∣ing
Persons now, are easily in∣duced
to believe, that, the Days
we live in, the World is not
much mended. This notwith∣standing,
no Time hath been
known (how dissolut soever)
wherein some worthy & ver∣tuous
Men have not appear∣ed,
who have studied to im∣prove
Natural and Moral En∣duements,
and to pursue Ver∣tue,
preferring that way to base


Interest, and selfish Ends. And
it is well known, that even at
this Time, when many & great
Duties are easily superceded,
there are here and there some
Persons who worthily act up∣on
the Principles of Honour,
Conscience, and Vertue, mau∣gre
all Discouragements. A∣mong
whom Your Lordship
(even in your Solitude) moves
and acts in a very high and
conspicuous Sphere, to that
Measure of lovely Vertue and
Splendor, that Your Friends
and Wellwishers admire, and


your Enemies (if You have
any) can find no matter of
Censure. If there were many
such in the Nation, it would
be no hard mater to retrieve &
bring in Vogue again, these ad∣equat
Qualities and Vertues,
which often have rendered ma∣ny
of our Countrymen (en∣dued
therewith) famous and
illustrious both at Home and
Abroad. In the mean Time
it is to be wish'd that each
man would labour to reform
Himself and his own Ways,
conforming them to these ex∣cellent


Rules. And that cer∣tainly
at length would make
and advance a laudable Re∣formation
indeed. But it is
to be feared, that this would
rather prove an abortive Wish,
than that it shall have its wisht
for Effect: albeit (to have it
so with the World) it should
be a part of our dayly Prayers,
and come in continually to
Our 
Letany.


My Lord!


Whilst You are Enjoying
Your self, and are solaced
with the Comfort of a good


Conscience, in Your Retire∣ment,
making your self an Ex∣ample
of Vertue, and a Pat∣ern
of Honour and Goodness
to those who observe you and
your Actions. I humbly ad∣dress

Your Lordship,
 not de∣siring
to interrupt Your Re∣pose,
but to afford You a litle
divertisement for some of your
vacant and Recreating Minuts:
By Offering to 
Your Lordships

Perusal these following 
Sheets,

and Begging 
Your Patronage

thereto: And I judge I have
little Reason to despair of your


Favour and Acceptance, since

Your Lordship
 was Pleased to
shew a more than Ordinary
Affection and Kindness to the
Author my Father. And there∣fore
I hope this little Tract wil
give 
Your Lordship
 some Con∣tent;
and for others I am bold
to say, I hope well: for many
Persons of great 
Honour
 and

Judgement,
 have (since my
Father the 
Authour
's Death)
been sollicitous to get written

Copies
 from the 
Original,
 which
was indeed perfected by My

Father
 in his Own Time,


without any Design to make
it publick. But my 
Father
's
M. S. with all his 
Books
 be∣ing
committed to a certain
Person he, without my Privity,
gave out 
Copies
 to 
Knowing
 &

Inquisitive Persons,
 as of late
I came to understand, and now
these 
Copies
 abounding abroad,
and most (if not all) being
defective or incorrect, (to
Prevent my 
Father
's being
abused) I now send a True

Copy
 abroad unto the 
World,

and let it See the Light: And
go it must under 
your Lord∣ships


Patronage,
 for I am con∣fident
the Design will succeed
the better, and the 
Book
 will
be the more acceptable to
these who Love and Desire
the 
Knowledge
 of such 
curious
Maters:
 Nor shal I diffide its

Fate,
 being first wellcome to
Your Lordship, to whom I
hereby address the same, most
humbly and heartily, and not
in course, ingyring upon a
Patron, as the custom some∣times
is.



Thus, begging Your Lord∣ships
Pardon for my Presump∣tion,
I do intreat from your
Lordship the Honour to be ac∣counted,


My Noble LORD,


Your 
Lordships
 most humble,
Most Faithfull, most Devoted,
And Obedient Servant,
M. BALFOVRE.








TO THE
READER


IT is needless to show the many advan∣tages
may be had from Travelling,
since all are convinced of it; and the
VVisest of Men in all 
Ages
 have thought
this the best way to improve themselves:
thus, as 
Homer,
 the 
Greek
 Master, showes
us, 
Vlysses
 followed this Method.


Qui Domitor 
Trojae
 multorum providus Vrbes,


Et Mores hominum inspexit; latumque per aeqour


Dum sibi dumsocijs reditum parat, aspera multa


Pertulit.


And such a one 
Homer
 drew his Son

Telemachus,
 whose adventures have of
late been Painted by an excellent Pen, with
all the advantages, requisit for the educa∣tion
of a good Man and Excellent Prince.


Indeed, the World is a Theater, in which we
may see not only the different productions
of Nature, but also all the Arts & Mysteries of
Government; and all the wayes of impro∣ving
Nature by Art; and every Climate
affords new 
Scenes
 for improving 
Geogra∣phy,
Natural
 and 
Civil Historie, Medicine,
Commerce,
 and all the 
Mechanick
 Arts.


Medicine
 certainly is much improved
this way, for thus 
Galen
 writes, he sailed
to 
Lemnos, Cyprus
 and 
Palestina
 of 
Syria,
 on
purpose to see foreign 
Plants,
 and rare
Ores and Mineralls.


The following Letters give you some ac∣count,
to this purpose, of these Countries in

Europe
 viz. 
England, France
 and 
Italy,

which for, Politeness & Civility, for 
Gran∣deur

and Magnificence, & for Arts and In∣ventions,
and the Publick incouragements
of them, farr excelleth all the rest. The
Author of them, Sir 
Andrew Balfour,
 Do∣ctor
of 
Medicine,
 spent some fifteen Years
in his Travels, & Residence in these Coun∣tries;
He was a Man of an Excellent VVit,
and of a Ripe Judgement, and of a most
taking behaviour; He had improven him∣self


to the best advantage, with all the learn∣ing
taught in the most famous 
Vniversi∣ties

of these Countries, had acquired their
Languages, and Conversed with the
most famous Man then alive. The par∣ticular
Curiosity He had to learn every
thing that might enrich his mind with
knowledge, was in his youngest Years fa∣voured
with the Example and Instruction
of his eldest Brother, 30 Years elder than
himself, the Famous Sir 
James Balfour, Lyon
King at Arms,
 who had a Curious 
Bibli∣otheck,

had Collected in his Cabinet ma∣ny
Curious Products of Nature and pieces
of Art, and took delight to cherish this ear∣ly
Curiositie of his youngest Brother: With
this Disposition & proficiencie in the Lear∣ning
then taught in his Native Country,
He begun his Travels, which, in so long a
Tract of time he employed that way, came
to Qualify him exceedingly for perform∣ing
all that is recorded of him.


When He wrot these Letters
He had setled his abode at 
E∣dinburgh,

where He Practised

Physick
 with great Success, &


deservedly gained the Reputation of the best
Qualified 
Physitian
 in the place, and ac∣cordingly
was employed by these of the
best Rank. About a Year or two after his
settlement here He took the Resolution of
erecting a publick Garden for 
Plants,
 and
a Cabinet of Curiosities: He had begun
the last in his own Lodging▪ and was pro∣jecting
how He might establish the other,
when He became acquainted with that wor∣thie
Gentleman 
Patrick Murray,
 Baron of

Livingstone,
 to whom these Letters (now
publish'd) were addressed. This Gentleman
designed so much for the good & Honour of
his Country, that I cannot but in this place
do that Justice to his Memorie to give the
World some Character of him, having been
well acquainted with him, & having had
the happiness to make the Acquaintance, &
beginn the Friendship contracted betwixt
him, and Sir 
Andrew Balfour,
 which pro∣duced
these Letters.


This Gentleman had a particular 
Genie
 in∣clining
him to studie Natural History, and
all the wayes and means, how to improve
the Arts, most usefull to his Countrie; He


had studied the 
Mathemathicks,
 & delighted
much in the practical part of them, & em∣ployed
much of the Revenue of that plen∣tifull
Estate He had from his Ancestors, in
purchasing Instruments, & Curious Books,
which treated on these Subjects, He having
Travelled over a great part of this Coun∣try,
in searching after the Plants that grew
wild up and down in it, & withall having
read severall writers on the Plants, he
every Year sent for new Seeds of foreign
Plants: He inclosed a considerable Parcel
of Ground, in which He trained them up
with great Skill; and before He 
 to
his Travells, He had of domestick and fo∣reign
Plants, growing in his Garden at

Livingstone,
 above a Thousand: He was a∣bove
thirty six Years of Age before He
began his Travells, and had fitted him∣self
by reading of 
Voyages,
 and such Books
as might best inform him of what He was
to inquire for, in foreign Countries, ye
 He
was so sensible of the great Advanta
 

that Learning Sir 
Andrew Balfour
 


ster of, that He not only inform
d 

him of the best Books, fitted 



and the designe He had to Learne all
that might be for the improving of know∣ledge,
& of the Arts usefull to this Coun∣try,
but likewise He obtained his promise
to intertain a Correspondence with him
whilst He was in foreign Countries, by Let∣ters,
upon all Occasions. These three make
a Part of what Sir 
Andrew
 wrote. He
had whilst He was abroad, bought up
most of the writers extant upon Plants
and other parts of naturall History, and
many relating to the culture of Plants; He
had 
exactly learned all the Plants then
keept in the Kings Garden at 
Paris
 (the
most compleat that is in the World, ei∣ther
for the number or the Quality of the
Plants) or in privat Gardens there; and
had travelled thorough a great part of

France,
 when He was surprized with a
Feaver, that he contracted at 
Avignion,
 of
which he dyed.


He begun his 
Voyage
 the 
2d.
 of 
Septem∣ber

1668, and dyed in 
August
 or 
September

1671. In these places of 
England
 and

France
 He Travelled thorough, He gives
a very particular Account, even of the Di∣mension


of the Publick Buildings, the Re∣marks,
the distances of the places; He gives
an Account of the Government of 
France,

of the 
Peers
 there, & the 
Orders
 of 
Knight∣hood;

He gives an account of the Remarkable
Manufactories in 
France,
 & particularizes
some of the Mines and Quarries of 
Marble,

and has an Account of the 
Canale
 for the
Communication betwixt the 
Mediterrane∣an

and the 
Ocean;
 He shows the Quali∣ty
of the Weather, the Habits of the Peo∣ple
in the Souths parts of 
France;
 He de∣s
ibes
the Monuments of Eminent Men, &

 some of their Sepulchral inscriptions,
and takes notice of the best Gardens and of
the C
iners of the Curious where He Tra∣velled▪
describing many particulars not
to be 
et 
ith in the printed Voya∣ges,
and upon this Account his Voyage
deserves very well to be made Publick.


As to these Letters of Sir
 Andrew Balfour

now published, I shall leave the Judge∣ment
of them to the Learned, who may
peruse them; yet this I must say,
 There are
many particularities in them relating to Na∣tural
History, and the way of Safe and con∣nient


Travelling, not to be met with in the prin∣ted
Accounts of these Countries, and I am per∣swaded
they are of Excelleut use for these
who study Natural History, and Physick,
where they may be informed where Plants, &
other Subjects of them, are to be found in their
Native Places, and where they may see the

Cabinets
 of the Curious.


Others will be hereby instructed in the

Manners, Orders,
 and 
Customes,
 of these
People; They will find likeways many Cu∣rious
Reflections, which are Pleasant to
read, and may give rise to higher Conside∣rations.
They will see what Varieties fo∣reign
Countries of a different Soil & Tem∣perature
of Air, do afford; severall of
which may be brought here, and may be
made usefull to this Country.


What Sir 
Andrew
 delivereth here, is
what he observed, experienced, and hand∣led
himself, and none need question the Re∣lations
in any Circumstance; He was
known to be a most candid and Ingenious
Gentleman, He gives his apprehension and
Judgment of the Reasons & causes: which
was allways much valued by all which


kneDw him; being a Gentleman of Excel∣lent
VVit, and Judgment: He did not ex∣pect
that they should be printed, and in
his lifetime he would never hear of it; and
such was his Modesty, he never shewed them
to any but his most intimate Friends, and
could not be perswaded to give a Copie
of them, but since his Death copies of them
have past from hand to hand, and all who
have seen them are very well pleased; where∣upon
at the earnest intreaty of his Friends,
his Son hath published them in the Stile
he found them writen; his design was to
render all easie & intelligible to his Friend
he wrote them to; if the 
Phrase
 & Lan∣guage
seem in some places less ornate, & not
so congruous as may be expected now, it
is to be remembred, they were writen thirty
Years ago, when he had been Fifteen
Years absent from his own Country, & had
accustomed himself to speak foreign more
Language, than to Studie the Elegancie
of his own Native Tongue; & this I think
should excuse him at the hands of the 
Cri∣ticks,

He Studied more things than words,


& yet, as all know, He expressed himself most
handsomely upon all Occasions.


It was fitt this should be Represented:
The rest is left to the impartiall Reader, who
will meet with so many Remarkable & use∣full
things in the Letters, that there is no
doubt of his kind Acceptance of them. If
these meet with the encouragement hoped
for, 'tis like, the 
Baron
 of 
Lovingstone
 his
observations in his Travels, in our Lan∣guage
too, and a Voyage of another Coun∣tryman
of ours, through 
France
 and 
Italy,

writen in a pure Stile of Latine, may be pu∣blished
for the satisfaction of such as are
Curious of Travells,


Farewell.












LETTER I.


CONTAINING
An Account of what is remarkable in and
about London, &c. And in and about
Paris, &c.


Sir,


I Cannot inform You of any thing
considerable on this side 
London,

except it please you, when you are
got the le
gth of 
Huntington,
 to turn six
or seven miles out of the road to see 
Cam∣bridge;

which I doe truly think worth
the while, in regard it is one of the two
famous Universities of 
England,
 where
if it please you, You may take Notice of
the number, structure, and order of the
Colledges, 
&c.
 but particularly of the
Libraries and Gardens; as also of the
Book-sellers Shops in the town-where
possibly you may meet with something


that you shal not meet with any where els
in order to this it would be convenient
to have some letter of recomendation or
adress to some member of the University
whom you might be sure (upon this
account) to find very ready to serve you;
I am sorry that I cannot help you in this
particular, having never been in this
place my self; But I think if you address
your self to Mr. 
Ray
 (who wrote and
published the Catalogue of plants grow∣ing
about 
Cambridge
) upon the score
of seeing that place, and himself as a
Person so deserving especially in the
knowledge of plants, of which you are
also a verie great lover; I make no doubt
you shall find him as ready to oblidge
you there, as you use to be to any 
Vir∣tuoso

here.


At 
London
 I shall advise you to lodg in
or about 
Convent
-garden, as a place most
commodious for your business. I thought
it necessar to accompany you only with
two leters of recommendation, the one to
Dr. 
Morisone,
 whom I think the best

Botanist
 in the world, and a most ho∣nest


and obliging friend; By his means
you will easily see all that is considerable
of Plants about 
London,
 and purchase
what seeds that place affoords. The other
is to Mr. 
Scott
 a Book-seller, dwelling in

Little-Britain
 by whose means you may
be furnished with any Book that may be
be had in 
London;
 and I think as reason∣ably
as else-where: notwithstanding you
will 'doe well to see other shops, as par∣ticularly
Mr. 
Bees
 and Mr. 
Pulleyns,

both of them in 
Little-Britain.


As for the other beauties of the Court
and City I need not say much, being
you will easily be informed of them up∣on
the place: I shall only hint at some of
the most considerable,


And first, at 
Whythall
 be pleased to
take Notice of the 
anquetting-house;
you will find it of a stately fabrick, such
as the late King designed to have all the
Palace of; it was built by King 
James,

the historie of whose diefication you wil
find Painted on the roofe within, by the
noble artist 
Rubens,
 only you will find
the Figures too big, occasioned by the


Painters misinformation concerning the
Hight of the Room, which he was made
beleeve to be greater. The King's privy
Rooms are worth the seeing, because of
their excellent Ornaments of Hangings
and Pictures.


2 The Palace of 
Westminster,
 in which
I find the great Hall only considerable
for its great breadth and artificiall roof.


3. 
Henry
 VII. Chappel and the tombs
in and near it.


4. You will do well upon some Holy∣day
(if any happen during your abode
there) to see the King at Divine service,
in regard of the extraordinary state used
on such dayes, as also of the excellent
Musick; I would advise you likwise to see
the King dine on some such day.


5. The Tower, in which be curious to
see the Mint Crown, Scepter, & Treasury,
the Magazine of ancient arms 
&c.
 and the
new Arsenall built and furnished by the
present King, The wild Beasts.


6. 
Gresham
-Colledge, where the Ex∣change
is now kept; inquire there for
Dr. 
Pope
 that by his means you may see


a verie fine collection of naturall rarities
kept in that Colledge. He will likewise
carry you to see the Royall society, if you
so desire.


7. The King and Dukes play-houses.


8. The Innes of Court, especially the

Temple, Lincolns
 Inn, and 
Gray
's Inn.


9. The New Exchange, and not farr
from it, 
Sommerset
-House.


10. St. 
James
's-House and Park.


11. If yow please to take a pair of Oares
the length of 
Greenwich,
 you will see the
Kings new House that is a building there,
and if you please to walk up to the Hill
above it, You will have a prospect up
and down the river, which the multi∣tude
of goodly ships, the pleasantness of
of the Countrey about, and our Coun∣treyman

John Barcly
's curious Descripti∣on
and Commendation of it, render most
famous.


12. For the rest, I shall only put you
in mind, that about 
London
 there are such
places, as 
Wimbletone
 belonging now to
the Earle of 
Bri
o
,
 but lately to the
Queen-Mother and in the time of the


Rebellion possest by 
Lambert;
 who im∣bellished
the Garden thereof with great
variety of plants. 
Hampton
-Court and
Park belonging to the Kings Majesty. I
shall likewise put You in mind that

Oxfoord
 is but fifty miles from 
London,

and that it is one of the most famous
Universities in the world, both for the
number and structure of the Colledges
and Halls, and for the multitude of 
u∣dents,
and competency of their provisi∣on.
The chief Colledges are 
Christs Church,
Magdalens, All-Souls,
 St. 
John
's, 
&c. Baliol

Colledg was founded by a 
Scots
 King's fa∣ther
of that name, The Schools is a stately
Fabrick where there is kept a most mag∣nificent
Librarie for Number of Books
beyond any that ever I saw: there is besides
near 
Magdalen
-Colledge a 
Physicall
 Gar∣den;
when You resolve to goe thither Dr.

Moreson
 wil recommend You to such per∣sons
as will be carefull to shew you every
thing.


From 
London
 to 
Paris
 the best way
is to goe by 
Dover
 and 
Calais,
 that you
may returne by 
Die
 and 
Rye,
 except


you make account to returne by 
Flanders

in which case I advise you rather to goe
by 
Rye
 and 
Deip,
 because 
Rouen
 (which
otherwise will not fall to be in your
way) is a more considerable place and
better worth the seeing, than any thing
upon the way of 
Calais.


For your accommodation from 
London

to 
Rye,
 you may either take post, or en∣quire
for the 
Rye
 Carrier at the Kings
Head in 
Southwark,
 he will furnish You
sadle Horses for 12. 
sh.
 a man, and if You
have anie baggage he will carrie it at
an easie rate; by this way You will arrive
at 
Rye
 in two dayes, where You may
lodge at the 
Marmaid
 untill You find
an Oportunitie of passage, for which if
there be Passingers enough You must
pay 10. 
sh.
 but if there be few passingers
You will be obliged to pay more.


At 
Deip
 be pleased to lodge 
A la Ba∣stile,

the master of the House hath a Son
that speaks 
English,
 and they are all verie
civil people. You may see in the shops
verie manie curiosities in that place, and
particularlie, 
Au Roy de la Chine;
 The


Town is famous for working in 
Ivory,
Horn,
 and 
Tortois-shell,
 for 
Combs, Boxes,
Dialls,
 and a Thousand other conceats.


From thence you must Hire Horse to

Rouen,
 the ordinarie price is a Crown, if
you have no companie you will do well
to take a guide by the Land-Lords Di∣rection;
you dine at a place called 
Tostes,

the first House of the village which you
come at is the best.


At Rouen
 lodge 
Au Bon Pasteur,
 the
master is a Protestant, and speaks 
English▪

be pleased to take Notice in the Town, of


1. The Bridge on the River, which is
of wood, supported by boats, and rises
and falls with the Tide.


2. The great Church; if you will be at
the pains to go to the Top of the Steeple
you may 
ave a verie good prospect of
the Town and Avenues, you may also see
the biggest bell in the World called the
St. 
George of Amboise.


3. The Palace, where the Parliament
Sits; the great Hall is commended for its
breadth, being it is without pillars, but


in my opinion it comes far short of 
West∣minster
-Hall
at 
London.


There is a litle Village about half a
League from the Town called 
Santeville,

famous for Cream, if you please your land∣lord
will find you a guid to conduct you
thither. You may Herbarize by the way.


You may take the messenger to 
Paris,

as being the easiest way, you pay 13.
or 14. 
Franks
 a man, for which You are
to be furnished with horse, lodging and
diet to 
Paris,
 as al
o to have Six pound
weight of baggage allow'd you, But if
You have any more, You must pay for it
beside; The last Meal which you make
by the way is at 
Po
to
,
 where it is usuall
after Dinner for every Gentlman in the
company to give to the conductor a peice
of 13. 
Solds.


At 
Paris
 I shall advise you to lodge at
Mr. 
Haes,
 They are very honest people,
at least you may stay there untill you
find the way of accommodating your self
better; he lodges 
A. Fauxbourg
 St. 
Germain
rue de la bouchery;
 There are so many wor∣thie
things to be seen in this place that


I shall only name some of them, for fear
of troubling you too much, and leave the
rest to your own observation.


1. See 
Luxemburgh
 palace & gardens;

Monsieur Marchant
 will be a fit Person,
because of his aquaintance there, to wait
upon you.


2. The Kings garden, where be sure to
make a strong friendship with the Gard∣ner;
and You may command what You
will of Plants or Seeds.


3. The Kings Library, and especialy
there, the Books of Minature done by

Monsieur Robert,
 which I look upon as
the best curiosity of that kind in the
World.


4. The Garden of 
Tuilliaries.


5. Monsieur 
Marchant
's own Garden;
He dwells, 
Rue du Roy de
 Sicile 
devant la
nostre
 Dame 
d' Argent, deriere le petit St.

Antoin; his Gard
n is hard by his house,
and there You may see some curious

Plants,
 not to be found elsewhere in

France.


6. The 
Jesuites
 College, where en∣quire
for some 
Scots
 Father, and desire


him to procure you a sight of the Bibli∣otheck,
and Mathematical House; there
you will see the 3. 
Systems
 of the World,
according to the severall 
Hypotheses
 of

Copernicus, Tycho Brache,
 and 
Ptolomeus,

represented in Motion.


If You be desirous to learn 
Chymie,

You may cause Monsieur 
Marchant
 ad∣dress
You to Monsieur 
Barlet;
 He lives

au College de
 Cambray, and uses to teach
Courses; It will cost you ten Crowns
for the Course, and two Crownes for
his Book; He demonstrates from two a
clock in the Afternoon till five, and fi∣nisheth
his course in three weeks. I think
it might be worth your while, in regard
you will hardly find the like Occasion a∣ny
other where.


I need not say any thing of the Book∣sellers,
being they are obvious 
A la Rue
St.
 Jaques; for new Books at the Palace;
for 
French
 Books, as 
Romances,
 &c. 
A la
Place de
 Sorbone; as also at the End of
the new bridge about 
nostre Dame
 church,
also at the postern Gate of the Palace and
upon the Mont 
St. Hiller,
 for old Books
of all Sorts.



Remember to cause Monsr. 
Marchant

show You a maker of Mathematical In∣struments
that lives 
dans l'Isle du Palais
au Key qui est vis a vis la valle des Mi∣seres,

and enquire for the designing In∣strument;
about the same place also you
may be provided of 
Microscops
 of al sorts;
If You desire to have your own, or any
other Picture done: enquire for Monsr.

Ferdinand, Paintre sur la Fosse an Faux∣bourgs
St. Germaine proche l' Academy de
Monsr. du
 Plessis, but make your bargain
before Hand.


It will be worth your while to see some
places about 
Paris,
 as particularlie,


1 
Maisone,
 a very delicat House, be∣longing
to the President of 
Maisone,
 &
standing upon the River of 
Saine,
 some 4.
Leagues from 
Paris;
 From hence you
must go two Leagues up the River, to


2 St. 
Germaine,
 A House belonging
to the King; from thence four Leagues
further a little off the River, to


3 
Versaile,
 A House begun by the late
King, but finished by the present; It is
a most delicate fine place, but (as I think)


there will be a Necessity of procureing
an Order from the Superintendent of the
House (who ordinarly resides at court)
to the 
Cons
erge
 of the House to show the
same to you; From thence to


4 
Rue
e,
 You have about two leagues:
it is a prettie little House built by Cardi∣nal

Richlieu;
 The G
rdens are exceed∣ingly
prettie, and the Water-Works the
best in 
France;
 From thence You may
come to


5 St. 
Clou,
 A House belonging to the
present Duke of 
Orleans;
 From thence
on your way to 
Paris
 (which is not a∣bove
3 Leagues) You pass thro' a wood
called 
Bois de
 Bologne; in which there
stands a House called 
Madrid,
 built by

Francis
 I. after His Return from 
Spain

where He had been Prisoner, to save his
promise of going back to 
Spain
 once a year.
In my time there was a Manufactorie for
weaving of Silk Stockings kept there.


Having performed this Journey in one
or at the most two days, you may with
your conveniencie visit


6 St. 
Denys,
 in the 
Abbey
 whereof there


is a famous Treasurie kept. Remember
to take Nottice of 
Charles
 the Great's
Crown, in which there is a 
Rubie
 of the
Bigness of a Pidgeons Egg; A large 
Cup
 of
oriental 
Aggat,
 which they count much of;
One of the Nails that fixed our 
Saviour
's
Bodie to the Cross, sent to 
Charles
 the
Great by 
Constantine
 V. Emperour of 
Con∣stantinople;

One of the 
Potts,
 wherein
our Saviour changed the water into wine
at the Marriage of 
Cana
 in 
Galilee;
 The
Pucel of 
Orleans
 Sword, wherewith she
overcame the 
English;
 The Lantern that
was carried before 
Judas,
 when He be∣trayed
our Saviour; and a thousand o∣ther
things of great Value. See the 
Tombs

likewise: You will do well to go earlie
in the Morning that you may have time
to speak to the Religious Men, and take
their Hour of conveniencie for seing of
the Treasure; which being done, you will
have time enough to return to 
Paris.


7 I know nothing better worth your
seing about 
Paris,
 than the 
Aqueduct
 at

Arcqueul
 about 2 leagues from the town,
it was built by 
Mary
 of 
Medices
 in the


time of her Regencie, for bringing the
the water to her palace of 
Luxemborg.

Besides the Aqueduct, you will also see
there a verie fine Grotto with fine walks
and manie prettie Jetts of water; one after∣noon
suffice for this Journey.


8. 
Fountainbleau,
 in which there are
so manie things considerable: not only
in the House, furniture, and painting; but
also in the Gardens, Walks, 
Fish
-ponds,
and water-works, that it will be less
trouble for you to observe them by seing,
than by a long narration; I shall only tell
you for the better improvement of your
Journey thither that you will doe well
first to go to


9. 
Esson
 a House seven leagues from

Paris
 belonging to a private Gentleman,
where you will see very fine water works
and many other prettie conceats; from
thence you have 3 leagues


10. To 
Durance,
 a privat House like∣wise,
but to which there belongs very
noble gardens and walkes, with delicat
Ponds and Jetts of water. It will not be
a miss to stay here all the night, being


You will have 4 Leagues to 
Fontainbleau,

a great part of which is through the
Forrest, and therefore better to be gone
in the morning, when the day is before
Your hand, than in the evening when
night may surprize You.


11. You may arrive so early in the
morning at 
Fountainbleau
 that You may
have time to see all before dinner, and
thereafter returne to 
Veau,
 a most stately
house and gardens correspondent to it,
built by Monsr. 
Fougues
,
 but since his
disgrace it's fallen to the King: From
hence you may returne a short League
off your way to lodge at 
Melun;
 The
next morning You will have an easie
Journey to 
Paris,
 and time enough if you
please to see 
Vinceu,
 within two short
Leagues of 
Paris.
 It is a House belonging
to the King in the middle of a verie plea∣sant
Park: after you have seen the House
emember to see the Wild Beasts that are
kept not far from it. If You resolve upon
making any greater toure into the coun∣rey,
I shall advise You to provide a Book
called 
le voyage de France,
 of the latest


edition, which will give you a hint of
the most considerable things that are to
be seen in those Places you go to. I shall
deferr any thing I would say further, un∣till
I be happie to hear of Your safe arivall
at 
Paris,
 and then I would be content
to trouble you with an other sheet: in the
mean time I pray for Your happie jour∣ney
and safe returne.




Sir,


I intreat You to signifie to Mr. 
Hannay

as also to Mr. 
Cranston
 that if they have
any thing to send to me, You will be
pleased to take charge of it; I shall beseech
You likewise to do the same by Monsr.

Marchant
 at 
Paris.












LETTER II.


Containing Advice for makeing the grand
Toure of France, with an Account of
what is most observable relateing especi∣ally
to the Natural History and Anti∣quities
of that Kingdom.


Sir,


IT seems You are not yet resolved whi∣ther
to spend the Winter in 
Paris
 or
in the Country, my opinion is that out
of 
Paris,
 there is litle thing either to be
seen or learned in all 
France;
 But in re∣gard
it is pertinent for a Traveler to see
some thing of the countrie as well as the
chief Town: I shall therefore advise you
to see those Places chieflie that I judge
most suitable to your inclinations, and
particularie in order to 
Botany,
 that is

Languedock
 and 
Provence,
 for altho' there
be manie other places of 
France
 verie
worthie the 
eing, as particularlie the Ri∣ver



Loyre
 from 
Orleance
 downward to

Nantes,
 which for the fertilitie aud beau∣tie
of the countrey, the frequencie of good
Towns and gentle disposition and Cour∣tesie
of the inhabitants, is called the Gar∣den
of 
France:
 yet you will find that Cli∣mate
produces but a few things different
from 
Normandy
 or the 
Isle
 of 
France:

But if you should incline to see it, my ad∣vice
is that you should not spend much
time in doing of it, and therefore if you
think fit you may make use of the follow∣ing
Advice at your Discretion.


I suppose You leave 
Paris
 about the
beginning of 
June
 (for I would not have
you loose the Month of 
May
 in the Kings
Garden, in regard most things will be
then, or a little before, in their Prime,
which now that the Garden of 
Blois
 is
no more in Condition, is undoubtedly
the best you are like to meet with) and
therefore, 1. you may go to 
Orleans
 by
the Messenger: it is but two Days Jour∣nie;
Lodge 
Chez Monsr.
 Ogilbie, 
sur
l'
stape au Roy de la Grand
 Bretaigne;
A Day or two will serve you to see all


that is considerable in the place; It will be
worth your while to see a place some two
Leagues from the City, called the 
Source,

where in the midst of a fair green Mea∣dow
you will see a Spring of Water so
plentifull, that it is navigable from its
Head, and powrs out a River called 
Loi∣rette.
2ly.
 From 
Orleans
 to 
Blois,
 they
count 15. Leagues, yet it is but a short
Days Journie: besides if you please, you
have the Commoditie of the River to go
by Boat; Be pleased to take Notice of a
place by the Way, some 4. Leagues from

Blois,
 called St. 
Die,
 where the best 
Cla∣ret

in that Countrie grows, and is ordi∣narly
to be found. 
Blois
 of itself is no very
considerable Town, yet it is famous for
makeing of 
Watches,
 for the Civilitie of
the People, for the Sweetness of the Air,
and Puritie of the 
French
 Language. You
must stay there some Days till you have
seen the following Particulars; 
viz.
 in
one day you may get to 
Chambort,
 a house
belonging to the King, some three leagues
off, on the south side of the River, and
South-East from the Town; It is said to


have been built by King 
Francis
 I. and
is a very statelie House, though of
a far different Order of 
Architecture

than what is now used. From thence
you may go to 
Herbeau,
 3. Leagues to
the southward of that, a privat house be∣longing
to a Gentleman that beares the
title thereof. It is a very pleasant seat hav∣ing
very fine Gardens with an Orangery,
Fish-Ponds, Woods, Maille and Mea∣dowes
belonging to it; from thence you
may go to 
Bean-Regard
 another privat
house, where amongst other prettie things
you will see a fine Gallerie well orna∣mented
with the pictures of such persons
as have been illustrious for some age; from
thence you returne to 
Blois
 at night, &
as you go and come you will have oc∣casion
to see that part of the forrest of

Blois
 that lyes to the South of the River
and town; as also a litle village called
St. 
Gervais,
 famous over all that countrey
for excellent Cream; being returned to

Blois,
 you may take notice of the Castle,
as also of the Garden which is now 
Seges
ubi Troja;
 the keeper of it is Dr. 
Brumer



my very good acquantance, and some∣times
one of the Herbarists to the late Duke
of 
Orleans,
 as were also Monsr. 
Morison

and Monsr. 
Marchand;
 upon any of whose
accounts or yet upon mine, I am confident
You will be very welcom to him; I believe
You may as yet see some Plants in the
Garden, from thence walk towards the

Capucins
 or the mount, and you will have
a delicat prospect both up & down the ri∣ver;
from thence walk towards the 
Alleys

which you will possibly find to be the
finest in length and breadth, and being
well planted on either side, that you have
hitherto seen; You may chuse whither
You will see 
Vendosme
 or not, it being
a place not verie considerable except for
the Holy Tea
e, which is preserved in
the Cathedrall Church with much ve∣neration,
and which people go to see out
of devotion; the toun is famous for make∣ing
of Gloves which are accounted the
best of that countrey; upon the returne
from that place You may see the Foun∣tain
of 
Orchaise,
 of old 
Horrcum Caesa∣ris

(for some where not far from thence


the 
Roman
 legion was said to be quar∣tered)

I
 take the fountain to be nothing
else but a rivulet or litle burn falling over
the Top of a soft Rock into which by pro∣cess
of time it hath cut in a considerable
way thro' the whole deepth of it, and
being grown together upon the Top, it
seems now to spring out of the Rock; over
against that, cross a meadow, you must
take notice of a Cave or Hole digged in
the side of a litle hill in which there is an
Aromatick kind of Earth, not much in∣feriour
as is believed to the 
Terra Sigillatae

of 
Lemnos;
 the common people call the
place 
La cave de la terre Sigille.


And here I must put you in mind that
in this same meadow I have very often
seen very large green 
Lizards,
 which
because it is a beautifull creature and not
found with us, I must intreat you where
ever you find of them to cause preserve
1 or 2, to add to my 
Tradescants.
 I know
not which will be the best way of pre∣serving
them, whither by skinning them,
or drying the flesh, but I suppose the best
way will be (especially if the skin be any


thing strong) to cause skin them, pre∣serving
the head feet and taile, and then
stop the Skin with Flax. There are like∣wise
severall other Birds in 
France
 which
are not common with us, which I must
earnestly intreat you to do the same by,
as for example the 
Pie verte
 or Green
Pyet, 
&c.


3ly.
 from 
Blois
 you go to 
Amboise
 in
half a day by water; the boat will give you
libertie to see the Castle; in the Chapell
whereof will be shown You hanging a
pair of Hornes, they say, of a Hart, the
largest and biggest (if they be true) that
ever was seen In the court of the Castle
there is likewise to be seen a Rib, and one
of the Back-Bones of the same 
Animal,

You are brought out of the Castle by a
Toure whose descent is so large and so
easie, being without Steps, that a Coach
may drive from the Bottome to the Top
thereof. From thence You go 
Tours
 all
Night, where


4ly.
 In my time the best Lodging was

A la
 St. 
Marthe;
 the place is commended
for the Sweetness of it's Situation, the


delicacie of it's Fields and Gardens, and
many other Particulars. It will be worth
Your while to see the Manufactories of
Silk, especially the way of working Tisse∣nes,
and Brocarts, which You will see
of diverse Colours and some of Gold and
Silver. The invention and way of making
Tabbies, which I forbear to descrive, be∣cause
You will abundantly discover it by
sight. You must be at the pains to fetch
a walk out of town a litle way to see the

Maille,
 which in any time was the longest
and in the best order of any in 
France;
 and
at the same time, you may go the length of
the 
Minims Convent
 because the first in∣stituter
of their Order St. 
Francois de paul,

lyes Buried in the Church in a marble

Coffine,
 as will be shown You, which
People visit with great Veneration: if
you will be at the pains to pass the River
there is an ascent to the 
Capucins
 whence
you may discover the whole City, and
a great part of the Countrey about, which
for it's Beauty and Fertility is called the

Gardin
 of 
France.
 and certainly deserves
that Name better than any Place upon


the whole River of 
Loir.
 There is like∣wayes
not far from 
Tours,
 a Place which
they call 
la cave Gutiere,
 From the Top
of which there drops a Liquor which
Congeals into a substance almost as hard
as a stone not much unlike that you sent
me from 
Hamiltoun.


5ly.
 You may go from 
Tours
 to 
Sau∣mure

a town famous for it's Protestant
University, of which we have two very
honest countrey-men that are members,
Monsr. 
Doule
 and Monsr. 
Gray.
 You
may take the pains to see 
Nostre damo
d' Ardeliers
 a Place of great devotion; if
you please you may see the Treasurie
which is Rich, and as you go and come,
you may observe the great Trade of that
Suburbs, to be making of Beads or Chap∣lets;
I beseech you forget not to bring us
some that are made of young Oranges:
If you please you may see the Castle. At

Saumure
 you must hire Horses to make
a litle tour of three days, and first you
must go to 
Doue,
 where there is to be
seen an ancient 
Amphitheatre
 cut out


of a Rock, as it is said, by the 
Romans.

There are likewise verie many great quar∣ries
of free stone and the Workmen often
find in cleaving of the stones, some litle
peices of a finer and harder substance by
farr than the rest, which from the shape
they have, They comonly call 
Langues
de Serpents.
 The little Boys for a small
matter will sell you abundance of them
which I pray forget not to buy, If not
for your own, at least for your friends
curiositie. From thence you must go to

Thouars,
 a most delicate House belonging
to the Duke of 
Tremoville,
 it is situat
upon a Rock, and the greatest part of
the office houses cut out of the Solid
Rock. The next Morning you go to

Waren,
 a verie prettie House but not much
worth the pains of seeing were it not in
Your way to 
Richlieu,
 where you are
to spend the rest of that day, That you
may have the more time to view the
Toun and House, which I think so well
worthie your seeing, That for it's sake
a Journey from 
Paris
 that length were
not ill bestowed. I shall say no more of


of it, that I may not deprive you of the

Gusto
 of being surprized with the Beau∣tie
of it. Amongst other things be
pleased to take notice of two Marble sta∣tues
that stand over the Gate, at the up∣per
end of the inner Court, as also of a
peece of painting in the Chapell, that
was left by way of Legacie to the 
Car∣dinall

by Monsieur 
de Mont Morency,

when he was Beheaded at 
Thoulouse.

There are two Books the one in 40. the
other in 80. containing the Figure of
the House, and parts thereof; they are
sold, as I take it, by the Porter, of whom
I intreat you to buy them for me.


The third day you may Dine at 
Lou∣dun

where in my time there was a Re∣ligious
Woman, that had been formerly
Possessed. At the time of her cure which
they say was Miraculous there was found
Written on her hand 
JESVS MARIA
JOSEPH,
 which still remained inde∣lible.
If she be yet alive you May see
it. From thence you returne by 
Shinon,

where they say the famous 
Francis Rablais

had his first breeding in an old convent,


From thence you pass throw Most deli∣cate
Meadows called the 
Valey
 of 
Shinon,

and in your way to 
Saumure
 some three
Leagues from the Town you may see a
Monasterie of Religious Women where∣of
the Lady 
Abbas
 in my time was the
Queen-Mothers Sister of Great 
Brittain.


6ly.
 You may hire horses to 
La Fleche,

where the only thing considerable is the

Jesuits
 Colledge. It is a most noble
Structure, and by far the best they have
in France. Take Particular notice of
their Church where the heart of 
Henry

the 
4th
 who gave them that House is
kept: The Bibliotheck: The Theatre-hall:
their Office houses, particularly the
Kitchen; the Bake-house, where one Man
and a Dog makes bread for all the Col∣ledge
every day: the Myln where the
Water that moves the Wheele doeth
likewise move a Pump that furnisheth
water to the whole Colledge. The best
lodging was 
Au quatre Vents.
 From hence
you must again take horse to 
Angiers.


7ly
 It is a Town famous for the Pro∣fession
of Laws, and hath likewise a


Faculty of Physick: See the great Church
called St. 
Maurice,
 and therein one of
those pots in which our 
Saviour
 convert∣ed
the water into Wine at the Marriage
of 
Cana
 in 
Galile.
 See the 
Maill,
 and
at the end of it next the town the 
Mi∣nims
Convent.
 You will find in their
Garden severall Kinds of 
Ilex;
 You will
likewise find in severall places of the
Countrey not far from the Town severall
sorts of 
Pinastres,
 as also a kind of Fruit
tree called 
Cormes,
 not mnch unlike our
Raun-tree, the Fruit whereof hangs in
Clusters like our 
Roddens:
 but of an
other colour, and bigness every one be∣ing
as big as a Plumb. A League or two
from the town towards the East, are the

Pierries
 or quarries, of blew Skleat
called 
Ardoise
 which serve the greatest
part of 
France:
 See the Castle, and in it
that famous crib where 
Rene
 King of

Sicilie
 and Duke of 
Anjou
 imprisoned
his Queen out of Jealousie all the days
of her life. About half a League distant
from the town, doun the River stands
a Convent called 
Bamet,
 worthie of see∣ing;


there is likewise on the other side
of the River an old Abbacie called 
Les
Bons Hommes,
 near to which there is a
litle lake, which I suppose to have been
the place where the blew Sklate was dug
of old; you will find about the sides of
it, aboundance of 
Tribulus aquaticus,
 the
Fruit thereof is ripe in the Moneth of

August;
 they use to Boyll them and Sell
them as they do 
Chasnuts,
 from which
they differ not much in Tast or Quality,
but verie much in Figure, and therefore
be pleased to provide a Quantitie of them
for your self and Friends. You may
likewise dry the Plant, if you think fit.


8ly
 You May go If you please from

Angiers
 to 
Nantes
 either by Water or
by Land, in one day; It is a prettie town
and stands upon the 
Loir
 and the Sea
flowing up above the town gives Com∣modity
to Ships of a considerable Bur∣den
to come up to the Town. It is here
that the greatest part of the Wines that
grow upon this River or near to it, to∣gether
with the Brandie made thereof,
which are carried out of 
France,
 are Im∣barked.


You must return again to 
An∣giers,

and from thence to 
Paris
 with the
Messenger. It is a Journey of five days,
and all that I know considerable in it, is
first, That when You come near to 
Mans

(which you will leave at a Leagues Di∣stance,
upon the Le
t Hand) You will
find in aboundance a Kind of 
Cistus,
 not
mentioned by any that I know of, ex∣cept

Petrus Bellonius.
 Forget not to pre∣serve
a Branch or two, which You may
Fold in your 
Portefoile,
 which for such
rancounters you'l do well to be stil Pro∣vided
of, and You may cause make them
of what Bigness You please, and have
them furnished with 
Gray Paper
 within.
I did allways use to Carry one of a 40
Form, with good Tyers to it in a 
Car∣pet

Bag (such as they use in 
France
) ty∣ed
to the Tore of my Saddle, so that if
it was My Fortune to Meet with any
thing by the Way worth the Gathering,
I could easily take it and preserve it with
out being in Danger to Loss my Com∣panie.

2ly.
 The Town of 
Chartres;
 in
the great Church whereof (which is a


most stately Fabrick) K. 
Henry
 IV. was
Sacred. It is a Place of great Devotion,
and there is kept in it amongst other Re∣licts,
one of our 
Ladys
 smocks. You wil meet
with several litle shops near to the 
church,

where the chief Trade is 
Beads,
 and as
they call them 
des Chemises de Chartres,

which Devout People Buy and append
to their Chaplets, and then get them to
Touch the Relicts, according to the Cu∣stom.


You may furnish this Journey, and
have Time enough at 
Paris
 to Prepare
your Self for the Journey to 
Provence

and 
Languedock
 before the 
Dog-Days
 be
ended, at which Time it will be fit to be∣gin
your Journey. And 
1st.
 You may take
the Messenger to 
Lions;
 I think You must
Pay about twentie Crowns; for the Jour∣ney
is of nine Days; There are not ma∣ny
things considerable to be seen by the
way; only take Notice 
1st
 at 
Nevers
 of
the Glass-Works, and 
Faiance,
 or white
Lame-works, of which the best in 
France

are here. 
2ly.
 At 
Mouline
 (where you
will fall to Dine) 
quire for the


monasterie where the body of Monsr.

de Monmorancy
 is in
erred, You may see
a very stately Monument of Marble. The
Town is famous for the Manufactorie
of Knives and Scissers. You will not miss
to be troubled with a company of Wo∣men,
who wait upon the arrivall of
Strangers, to show them quantities of
this kind o
 ware in hopes to Sell some.
3ly. Take notice of the Well of 
Pouge,

the water is Alummous and boills up in
great quantity, of a whiteish colour, as
if there were meal mixed with it. 4ly. 
Ro∣ane;

which is said to be the largest Bourg
in 
France:
 they call that Bourg which is
not incompassed with wall or ditch. The

Loir
 begins to be Portable here and cary
Boats, But it's source is many Leagues
higher. 5ly. 
Mont tarare;
 It is a very
great Hill, and here You will find a
change of the climate together with the
change of Plants, which I leave to Your
observation, and think it will be worth
Your while at night to make a note of
all those Plants that You meet with. Be∣ing
arrived at 
Lions
 You must stay some


time to see the place, which altho' in re∣gard
of its situation amongst Hils and
Rivers, it be somewhat unwholsome, the
Air, being either too moist, or in Summer
t
o hot; yet I look upon it as one of the
best and most important Towns in

France,
 both for the magnificknesse of the
Buildings, the great tra
ique it hath with
almost all Places of the World, to which
the situation of it betwixt two Rivers,
the 
Soane
 and the 
Rhosne
 is no small
advantage; for by the 
Soane
 it hath
Communion not only with 
Burgundie,

but also with the 
Ocean;
 for 
Chalon
 which
stands upon the 
Soane,
 is but a days Jour∣ney
from 
Auxere,
 which stands upon the

Saine,
 and that River you know disim∣bogues
it self in the 
Ocean
 at 
Haver
de∣grace.

By the 
Rhosne,
 it hath communi∣on
with the Mediterranean Sea, and
consequently, with all the 
Levant.
 The

Soane
 in Latine 
Araris
 is a Pleasant and
very soft flowing River; the 
Rhosne
 is

Fluviorum Rapidissimus.
 The people
are very ingenious and dextrous in
the matter of traffick and business, they


are likeways courteous & human, your
most convenient Lodging, will be 
Aux∣trois-Rois:

It is a good House and nea

to the place where the Messenger of 
Pa∣ris

arrives. As also to the Post-House.
Remember to see the 
Maisone-de-Villo

which without exception is the most state¦ly
in 
France:
 Take particular notice of
its Fabrick, Statues, Paintings, and an∣cient
Inscriptions, of which some are ex∣tant
upon Brass, its Fountain's, courts,
&c. 2. See the great Church of St. 
John,

and in it a most Stately and Curious
Clock, upon the upper part of which,
i
mediately before the hour strike, the
blessed 
Virgine
 appears with the 
Angel

before her, as she uses to be represented
at the 
Annunciation,
 and within a little, a
Cock upon the top claps his Wings
and Crows, and then the hour strikes.
There is likeways considerable in it, a
Hand that points the minut of the hour
upon the O
al, and altho' the parts of an
Oval line, be not equally distant from
the center yet the Hand which is
fixed in the center, doth alwayes reach


that line and never exceed it, in the whole
compase it maketh. 
3ly.
 There is an Old
Monument about the midle of that 
Faux∣bourgh,

by which the Messenger of 
Pa∣ris

enters they call it 
Tombeau-de-deux
Amants.
 It seems to be of 
Roman
 anti∣quitie.
4ly, See the Bishops House &
and Gardens, the great Place before it,
the Bridge over the 
Rhosne:
 And in
short consider the Avenues and Compass
of the Town.


5ly. Forget not to take with you your
Catalogue of Books, for there are many
Booksellers in this Place, that have great
Magazins of Books, and have great traf∣fick
with all 
Germany, Swizerland
 and

Italy,
 and it is very like, you may come
by Books here that you missed of at 
Pa∣ris;

For so it happened to my self.


I must not omit in this place to tell
you that it will be expedient, to draw
your Money from 
Paris,
 to 
Lions,
 ei∣ther
by Bill of Ex-change, or Letter of
credit, upon some honest, substantiall
Merchant, to whom yon must be sure to
yet good Recommendation: By his means


you may return your Money, to any o∣ther
place as you shall have occasion,
and likeways be furnished with new re∣commendations
as you desire; & this way
you may make your Money march from
place to place, without fear or danger;
and if you light upon honest Men the Ex∣change
will cost you nothimg, unless it
be from 
Paris
 to 
Lions;
 because of the
disrance and that will not be above half
a one 
per-Cent:
 Your Merchant at 
Li∣ons,

will be a convenient Steple for re∣ceiving
your Letters, or any thing else,
that you please to send from any other
place, and to send it forward to 
Paris,

to be keept for you. By them you shall
give advice to receive it from the Carri∣ers,
or otherways to the Merchant, that
returnes your Money to 
Lions:
 But of
these things I have said enough, for I
doubt not that you are sufficiently in∣formed
of them already.


From 
Lions,
 you take Boat to 
Avigni∣on,

which is about fi
tie Leagues: if the
River be not very low, which seldom
happeneth, you would go near to accom∣plish


it, in two days and a half, or three
at most.


You have to take notice of, by the way

1st. Vienne,
 a little but ancient Town, five
Leagues from 
Lions.
 See the forges where
they make Sword-blades, the Haminers
are moved by a Wheell which the Water
turns, so that the Stroakes are both fre∣quent
and equall. The Town hangs u∣pon
the side of a Hill toward the River.
2ly. some nine Leagues from 
Vienne,

there is an old Castle called 
Le Maisone
de Pillate,
 the place is no otherways con∣siderable
than for having been the retreat
of 
Pontius Pilate,
 driven here, by, God
knows, what accident. 3ly. 
Valence,
 a
Pretie Town only considerable for its U∣niversity.
4ly. 
Le Pont-Sanct-Esprite

seventeen Leagues lower than 
Valence,

the Town is not very considerable, but
only for the Bridge, from whence it takes
its name, and which at that place stands
upon the 
Rhosne;
 that which renders the
Bridge so considerable, is the breadth of
the River, and Impetuosity of the current;
for besides other small Rivers, both the



Soane
 and the 
Isere,
 a little before You
come at 
Valence,
 and several others be∣low
that, loss themselves therein.


When you come at 
Avignion,
 You
may lodge at 
Louxenbourg.
 The Town
and Country belongs to the 
Pope,
 whose
Legate resides in Quality of Governour.
It will be fitting to stay here some Days,
that You may the better take Notice of
the following Particulars. 1. The Church∣es
and Religious Houses. 
2ly.
 The Le∣gat's
Palace. 
3ly.
 The Situation, and

Avenues
 of the Town, together with the
Walls thereof, which are high and state∣ly,
and it will be worth Your while to
go about them in regard of the Occasion
You will have to Herbarize, for here
you will find many Plants that did not
appear in any other part of your Journey.

4ly.
 The 
Jurie
 or 
Cantone
 of the Town
where the 
Jewes
 dwell, I advise You by
all means if You can stay of a 
Saturday

to see their 
Synagogue
 and manner of
Worship, and if you be Curious and
make Enquiry, You may possibly see a

Circumcision. 5ly.
 You may hire Horse



to 
Orange,
 which is but half a days Jour∣nie
up the River. The Town and Prin∣cipality
belongs to the Prince of 
Orange;

It is an ancient, tho' little Town; It
was considerable in My time for the Ca∣stle,
which was very Strong, both by
Art, and by its natural Situation, which
was so high, that from thence one might
have discovered seven or eight Provin∣ces
about, at least some part o
 them: the
Town hath an 
niversity tho' not very
considerable; The inhabitants for the
most part are Protestants. There are yet
extant some Monuments of antiquitie, 
viz

a Triumphal 
Arch
 a lttle without the
Town, and some ruins of a Theatre
within the Town, both of which shows
something of the 
Roman
 Greatness,
in Respect of Modern Times; The
Coun
ry about is fertile, and there are
whole 
lds of 
a
ron. I think it might
be well worth the while to enquire ab∣out
the best way of P
anting, cultivating,
gathering and preparing o
 it. Having
seen these thing and Dyned, You return
to Your Lodging at 
Avignion
 the same


day. The next day you take Horses for

Aix,
 which is about two days Journey
or two days and a half a most. If You
depart from 
Avignion
 early in the morn∣ing
You will have time enough to see

Vauclus,
 which is three Leagues from

Avignion
 and then to go Dine at 
Cava∣illion.

I look upon 
Vaucluse
 as one of the
most considrable things I have ever seen:
it is a fountain at the foot of a great
Rock very Large and 
f immense deep∣ness,
which poures out so much Water
as to Move four or five Milnes about
half a Mile below. It is observed that
the Water Diminishes and increases ac∣cording
to the season of the Year. In rainy
Weather it abounds most, and Yet when
you consider the position of it, how
much it is elevated above the plain, and
what vast hills and Rocks are about it,
It is not conceaveable with what other
Water▪ it should have any communion.
The River that comes from it tumbles
over so many stones and Craigs; that it
makes a noise like the 
Catarracks,
 and
having neer three quarters of a Mile to


fall, it becomes exceeding swift before it
arrive the Plain, and there divides it
self in two, and incloses a litle Meadow in
Form of an Isle, and then joyns again. The
Water is so Clear, finding nothing a∣mong
the Rocks to Defile it, that not∣withstanding
its Swiftness, yet it hinders
not the grass to grow in it's bed. The Fi∣ver
is likewise recomended for excellent
Trouts and Crawfish and it is agreeable
to Reason they should be good that live
in so pure streams; When You come
the length of the Mil
s you must quite
Your Horse, to walk up 
o the 
Sour
e,
 &
and for that 
 must take a guide,
without which the way is not easie. As
You go up you will observe upon the
other side, in two other places, the Ruins
of two old Castles, the one standing
about a Musket shot higher than the
other, in the uppermost whereof did
sometimes live that Noble Philosopher,
and Poet 
Franciscus P
trarcha
 and in
the lower 
Donna Laura
 his Mistriss, in
the praise of whose beautie and vertue he
composed his most excelent 
Triumfe d' A∣more;



a Monument that hath outlasted
her familie, in which her Memorie is like
to live as long as Wit and Learning
continues in reputation. You may also in
this place take notice of the Paper-Milns
and consider that so usefull art of make∣ing
Paper, and labour to informe your∣self
well of all the particulars that when
GOD shall be pleased to return you, you
may make it Practicable in your own
Countrey. I am sure we want not Lin∣nen
rags in abundance which might be
preserved for this use, and not thrown
into the Dunghill's, were people put
once in the right way.


From hence you go to Dine at 
Cava∣illion;

in the rest of the Journey to 
Aix,

there is nothing considerable, only you
have a River to pass by boat called 
Du∣rance.
Aix,
 is one of the most delicate
Towns in 
France,
 It's the Capitall City
of 
Provence
 and the seat of a Parliament.
The streets are large, especialy one great
street, the Buildings fair and stately,
The City well watered and the Air
very healthfull and Sweet.



From hence you go to 
Marseilles
 in
half a day, you may lodge at 
a l' Aigle
 or

al' teste noire.
 You must resolve to stay
two or three days at least, for the more
commodious seeing and observing the
following things. 
1st.
 the Harbory or
Port, which is very spicious and deep,
and exceedingly well guarded, having
upon he entrie thereof to the Sea ward,
which is very narrow, not only a chain
drawn, but also a very strong Citidale,
built within these seven or eight years,
upon the one side o
 it, and an other

ort upon a litle Island within the Sea,
at a leagues distance from the entrie, all
which rendreth it most secure from the

Algiers
 and 
T
n
ies
 Men of Warr and
other Pyrats. 
2ly.
 the Cathedrall Church,
which you may easily guesse to be very
ancient, from the Modell and Architect∣u
e
thereof. It was first extructed in the ho¦nor
of 
Digna
 by the 
Greek Phocenses,
 who
had a Colonie here. 
3ly.
 Take notice
in the 
 before the Church upon the
wall looking to the Sea, of nine or ten
large Brass Guns, which use upon the


day of the Towns great Festivitie (which
is sometime in 
October
) to be loaden
with Bull and discharged by so many of
the best gunners of the Town, a
ter great
Mass is ended, at a white mark placed on
the Side of the hill, on the other side of
the Harbour. He that shoots nearest the
Mark is esteemed the best Gunner for
that year. They begin to fire just as the

Arch-Bishop
 comes out of the Church.
Who having celebrated Mass in 
Ponti∣ficalibu
,

returnes to his own Hous
 ac∣companied
with the Consul and chief
Magistrats of the Place, and generally a
l
the Gentlemen & citizens of the best fashi∣on,
in their best apparell and a great
consort of Musick. 
4ly. Nostre dame de
la gard,
 a Castle upon the Top of the
Hill to the Southward of the Town, in
in the going thither, you will do well
to bestow a whole day, and take with
you a couple of Souldiers, from the Ci∣tidale,
or else a Couple of other Souldiers
armed at least with Swords, and let one
of them cary a couple of botles o
 Wine
with bread and what else you think fit,


as provision for that day, the other may
cary a Basket with you emptie, being
thus accourted, you may Herbarize upon
the way to the Castle, and put a litle
quantitie of every Herb you find into
your emptie basket, the better to judge
of it at your return; as also of what
Seeds you find you may put up some
for your own and friends use, you may
returne by the way of the Sea, and so
Herbarize all thereabouts. It is a most
excellent place for Varietie of Plants, a∣mongst
the rest take particular notice of
the 
Tarto
rair Massiliensium,
 upon the
Sea side you may likewise take notice,
what Stones or shells, Mosses or any other
naturall curiosities you can observe, &
if any be worth the preserving bring
them along with you. 
5ly
 I would
have you bestow half a day in a boat
upon the Sea without the Harbour, but
so as it be very calm, for then you will
easily se the botom of the Water, espe∣cially
where it is not very deep, because
the Water hath no Motion of ebbing
or flowing, and so you may possibly


light upon curiosities worth the gathe¦ring,
for the taking up of which, you
must provide Creepers, which the Sea∣men
know how to use. 
6ly.
 Take
notice of the situation Fabrick, and
Avenues of the Town, especially some
Shops upon the Shoare, where you will
find many curiosities, especially from the

Levant.
 I must recommend my self to
you here, but especially for a good hand∣some
Tree of red Corall; as also one of
those that are black, but are not true Co∣rall,
and what else you think fit; I
shall hold you good accompt, for all ex∣penses;
you may send them with your
own things to 
Lions,
 with Order to
your Friend there to send them to 
Paris,

to be received by your Factor and keept
for you. 
7ly.
 The Place is commend∣ed
for perfumes, sweet-Powders, 
Franchi∣pane
-Gloves,
&c. But there is great cheat∣ing
both in the Prices and Quantities of
the things; therefore take heed to your
self, if you buy any of them: I did
formerly forget to tell you that 
Avig∣nion

is famous for the same things, but
especially for Gloves; whereof the Ma∣nufactorie


is very good; and Essences.
But now I return to 
Marsails
 where 
8ly.

Take occasion frequently to view the
Fish-market, where you will not miss
to see great variety of strange Fishes
well worth the observing, and for that
end I wish you to acquaint your self with
the 
Icones Piscium,
 together with their
description, by 
Petrus Bellonius,
 it
is in a Long 80. and not very thick, &
therefore you may take it along with you
from 
Pari.
 If any of these Fishes which
are not common with us can be preser∣ved
or keept any way; as I doubt not
but you will find inventions to do it,
you will exceedingly oblidge us to
bring them along with you, or send
them as said is: Be pleased to enquire

ches les Espiciers
 for a kind of Seed
which they call 
Graine d' Avignion,

they sell it in great quantity to Dyers
who use it for Dying Yellow; it is the

Lycium Gallicum Dalechampij;
 It is a
Shrub not common here, nor yet in the
North of 
France,
 and therefore worth
the taking notice of; I would have
you bring us some quantity of the graine


for a Show about an ounce or so: But
because I suspect, that which the Gros∣sers
sell is dryed; therefore I think it
will be more profitable to search at 
A∣vignion,

where it grows plentifully, for
some that is better conditioned for your
own use. In your herborization at 
Mar∣saills

especially upon the Hill, amongst
other rare Plants, you will find 
Mypum
Montis Ceti, sive herba terribilis Narb
∣n
nsium
Lobelij.


9ly.
 Take a view of the Country a∣bout

Marsaills
 from some eminent Place,
especially east from the Town, where the
fertility is so great and the Country-Houses,
and Gardens, so thick, that
they use to call it the 
Suburbs
 o
 
Marsaills,

and say merrily, that 
Marsaills
 and its
suburbs is bigger than 
Paris:
 The great
conveniencie of these Houses is to acc
m∣modat
the Citizens with a retireing
Place, in time of Plague, as also to divert
themselves in Summer, and to provide
necessars for House keeping.


At 
Marsaills
 you must hire Horses to

Frayole,
 which is some three dayes Jour∣ney


east ward toward 
Neice;
 In this
Journey, besides the things of Pleasure
you will see in this higher 
Provence,
 you
will have the best herborization, almost
all the way, that you can possibly desire;
you must part from 
Marsaills
 early in
the morning, that you may have the
more time to herbarize by the way, &
that you may arrive in good time be∣fore
it be Night at 
Saincte Beaume,
 a Place
of much Devotion, and the greatest So∣litude
in the World. In the midle of
a vast and terrible Rock, there is a great
cave where St. 
Maria Magdalen
 did pen∣nance
for many years before her Death:
it's now upon that consideration turned
into a Chapell, with some few Rooms
clacht up against the face of a Rock,
like a Bird cage upon the side of a Wall,
where some Religious Men (as I think

Jacobins
) keep the Place, and serve the
cure in the Chapel every Day receiving
confessions, & giving the Sacraments to
such as require them. There is a little
kind of a chainge-house close to it, that
provides Meat for Men and Horses, at


their own expences, but you mnst lye
within the convent; in the morning you
must take a Guide to the Top of the
Craig, where there is an other Chapel
of Devotion just in that Place
where the Angels did use once a
Day, to carrie the 
Saincts,
 from the
cave to administer consolation to her.
As you go and come you may herbarize,
for the whole side of the Hill before you
come at the Rock, is a Wood: Upon
your Arrival at the convent it is expedi∣ent
to give some little thing out of Cha∣rity,
which I think is bestowed in main∣taining
the place. You will ordinarly
find without the Chapel Door, some few
little Merchants that sell Reads, and a∣mongst
other things, Silk-Cords of the
just length and greatnes of the 
Saint,

all which People use to buy and carrie
in to the Chapel, there to touch the Sta∣tue
of the 
Sainct;
 which l
es just in
that Place, and in that Posture, that
she used to do pennance in; you will
likeways see within the Chapel a very
Large Well of good Water, which they
say did first spring there by miracle, for


use of the 
Sainct.
 From hence you take
Horses to 
Sainct Maximine,
 a little Town,
in the great Church whereof, amongst
other reliques, the Body of St. 
Maxi∣mine,

Uncle to St. 
Mary Magdalen,
 &
sometimes Bishop of 
Marsaills,
 is preser∣ved:
If you please you may take this op∣portunity
of seeing it, and there dyne,
for it is a little out of your way to 
Brig∣nole,

where you must lye the second
Night, and the Day following you Dine
at a Village called 
Luques,
 and then go
to lye ae 
Frayote,
 or 
Freust,
 which you
please to call it. Its a Town of 
Roman

antiquity, of which there are yet some
rests to be seen, as aqueducts, &c. The
Town is not otherways considerable at
all; you will do well here, besides your
own Guide that goes along with you
to take another Man from the Town,
with an emptie Basket, to wait upon
you to the Hil, called 
Astral,
 about a
League from the Town, where you will
have one of the most pleasant Heboriza∣tions
in the World: Amongst a great
variety of Shrubs, Plants, and Trees,


you will find a great Number of 
Arbutus,

loaden with Fruit, of a most Beautifull
aspect; yet, somewhat insipid to the
taste, It may safely be eaten, but doth
not much allure the taste. Several kind
of Spinous Shrubs, amongst which 
Acaeia
Secunda Dioscorides
 sive 
Aspalathus,

when you come upon the Top of the
Hil, upon the way to 
Neice,
 there is
an 
Inn,
 where you may make a Shift
for Dinner, and a little beyond it, upon
the North-side of the Hil, you will meet
with aboundance of Cork-Trees, 
Ilex,
Abics, Picca,
 &c.


I must give you notice here, that in
this place, you are not, above two or
three hours ryding, from 
Cane,
 a Village,
upon the Sea-side, some eight or nine Lea∣gues
distant from 
Neice,
 where (were you
to go to 
Italy,
) you might commodiously
hire a 
Fel
oque
 of two Oares a side for 
Ge∣nova,

and arrive there in four or five
days, 
Ter a Terre,
 that is Landing every
Day to your Dinner, and to your Lod∣ging,
in some convenient Town: But
I shall say nothing of 
Italy,
 untill I un∣derstand


from your self, that you have
a design for it.


I shall therefore returne to 
Astrate,

where having satisfied your self, with
herbarizing you may returne to 
Freiust;

loaden with Seeds, and Plants, and there
consider them at your ease: From thence
you may return to 
Marseills
 in two
days and so to 
Avignion,
 by the way of

Arles, Sainct Eloy de Cro
 Tarascon.
 At

Arles,
 remember to see the entry into a
great Passage all Vaulted, which they
say goes under the 
Rhosne
 to 
Nismes,
 &
was made by the 
Romans.
 At 
Tarascon,

you will see on the other side of the River

Bea
caire,
 most famous for a very great
Faire or Market, keept there once a Year,
to which great Numbers of Merchants
from many Places of the 
Levant,
 do
resort.


From 
Avignion,
 you go 
o 
Nismes,

but you must part by times in the mor∣ning
that you may have the conveniencie
to see 
Pont de Gard,
 which is one of
the finest Peeces of Antiquity extant
in the World. It is a Part of that A


Aqueduct, which the 
Romans
 built for
conveying a part of the water of the 
Rhosne

from the 
Pont
 St. 
Esprite
 to 
Nismes,
 &
because at the Place where the Bridge
stands, the River 
Gard
 runs low be∣twixt
two Hills, there was a necessity of
raising the Aqueduct so high as to le∣vel
the Tops of these Hils, therefore it
hath three Ranges of 
Arches,
 the lower∣most
are the biggest but fewest in num∣ber;
they are likeways the broadest, for
besides that they support the second row
of 
Arches,
 they do likeways serve on
the other side for a Passage and Bridge for
foot, Horse▪ and coaches to the high-way:
The second supports the third, which are
not so high, but many more in number,
on the Top of all is the Aqueduct five
or six foot broad, and four or five foot
deep, it is compassed with great Flag
Stones on all sides, exceedingly well
cemented together, insomuch that I be∣leeve
it be yet very intire, except it be
some few of the covering Stones that
are broak and fallen away.


Nismes
 is some three Leagues, but


they are long ones, from the 
Pont de
Gard;
 And I must tell you, altho' the
way you are to follow from 
Avignion

to 
Nismes,
 by the 
Pont de Gard,
 be for
the most part very barren, yet you will
find the Weeds for the most part are,

Cistum ledum Narbonense, thime, laven∣der,
Satureia, mirtles, timelaea, corranda,
Smilax aspera, Lentiscus, Terebinthinus,
Staebe Salamantica, caliculis argenteis B.
Ilex, Sabina baccifera, Iunip: fructu ma∣jori,
Cistus mas, Cistus faemina, thymum
cephaloton


Clematis, vel flammula repens, aespalathus▪
phyllarelea Folio non serrata, Jesiminum
luteum bacciferum, Stellaria argente

Ambrosia campestris, datura simplici calice
albo, aster attious foliolis ad florem rigidis,
aster lunariae folio, flore trifolij. Jacea
cianoides flore albo folio multifido, trifo∣lium
bituminosum, acarna lutea, Erin∣gium
luteum monspel: bicopsis flore carnec,
Carduus Spharocephalus ceruleus, ama∣ranthus
viridis, campanula flore plumeo,
attriplex non descript
 Semine singulari


binis foliolis incluso, Linaria minor lu∣tea,
paliurus 
and a great many more
that I cannot remember of; but it will
be well worth the while to take a Note
of the Plants you find in every
Place.


At 
Nismes
 you must lodge 
Aux A∣renes;

you will see there a brave Am∣phitheatre
built by the 
Romans,
 in
greater integritie yet than any that ever
I saw in 
Italy,
 the Stones of which it
is built, as well as the 
Pont de Gard,

are of incredible Bigness, and altho' the
things themselves be somewhat ruined;
yet they show greater Statelynesse and
Magnificence than any modern Buil∣ding.
There are some other remaine

of antiquitie about the Town which
will be showen you. From 
Nismes

you take Horses for 
Mompellier,
 which
is a Days Journey from it; You dine at

Lunel
 which is about mid-way, and
because I have nothing to say of this
Place, I shall intreat you to bring me
three or four ounces of the Seeds of

palliurus,
 for amongst other uses they


serve for, they are the best Bullets for
Cauters that can be, but it is for an o∣ther
use I would have them.


You will do well to stay some days
at 
Montpellier:
 You may lodge at the

white Horse,
 or otherways as you find
your accommodation. It is a delicat
sweet Town, the Streets well built, but
narrow, because of the heats which are
as great here as in any place of 
France,

nor is it strange it should be so, being
it is near upon the same latitude with

Rome.
 You will do well to see the
Physick Schools, there is some Curiosities
to be seen in them. 
2ly.
 The Physick-Garden;
in which you will find many
excellent Plants; by making a little ac∣quaintance
with the Gardener, you
may command what Seeds he has.


3ly.
 You will do well to make ac∣quaintance
with some of the Students
or young Doctors of Physick, by whose
means and in whose company you may
see all the places about 
Monpelier
 that
are fit for Herbarizing, as particular∣ly

Magelon,
 a little Island of the Medi∣terranean


Sea, lying within Sight of

Monpellier.
 But by all means of the
World, you must be sure to make a
Journey ten or twelve Leagues from

Mompellier,
 to a Place amongst the
Hils, which for the great varity of Plants,
that is found in and about it, is called

Hortus Dei.


You may likeways find some variety
of Shells and productions of the Sea, to

Mompellier
 and the Shoar, or Coast,
which is near the Town.


I must not omit to tell you, that if
you please to make a Collection of dry
Plants, this is a very fit Place for it,
both because of the heat which helps to
dry them, both soon and well; & also be∣cause
of the Garden & Fields, that abound
with Plants, that are not common, &
likeways, because of the good occasion
you have to send them in a Box, close
packt up, (as you have seen mine) to

Lions,
 &c.


In like manner, if you will make a
Collection of Seeds, the best will be
to keep them in their Seed-Vessels, and


write upon every parcell, that you may
dispose of them afterwards according to
your pleasure.


This I wish you to do in every Place,
that afterwards when it shall please God
to bring you safely to bring them home,
Tho' you should not be able to raise them
in this climat, yet you might have enough
to know them by. Do not forget the
Booksellers here, who may possibly
have some of the Books you look
for. I must desire one Favour of you
in this Place, that You would
be pleased to enquire after the 
Psilothrum

or Depilatory Ointment, which they
use in 
Rome
 in the Baths, and which
I was so Unluckie as not to mind when
I was upon the place. It you can find
the Receipt, cause make some small quan∣tity
of it to try if it be Right, which
you will easily know by this, that being
rubbed upon any hairy place, within a
little space, when you come to wipe
it off, it takes the hair without burning
or scalding the Skin; but if it either burn
or discolour the Skin, it is not right. The


place is afterward to be washed with
a little warm Water. I must likeways
intreat you to be at ths pains to cause
dry me a Viper or two, it will be e∣nough
to dry their Skins with the heads
at them, stopped with Flax, or Cotton:
but in no way must you medle with
them your self, because there is Danger,
but imploy one of those fellows that
brings them to the Apothecaries, who
for a small matter will do it. Some day
or other, you may be at the paines to see

Frontiniague
 famous for that generous
Moschat Wine, called by the name of the
place, you may Collation there, and
Harbarize as you go and come.


When you are satisfied here, it will be fit
to set forward to 
Thoulouse.
 You will see by
the way, 
1st. Pesenas
 a Pretie Town, where
it may fall you to Dyne, 
Au tapis vert,

hard by the Town, there is a very fine
House, with excellent Gardens, be∣longing
to the 
Prince
 of 
Condie,
 it is
worthy of your seeing. 
2ly. Beziers;
3ly. Narbone,
 which is a very strong
and well fortified Town, near upon


the borders of 
Catalonia.
 It hath com∣munion
with the Sea, by means of a little
River, that runs through the Town.
Be pleased to see the great Church,
and in it a Peece of excellent Painting,
representing the History of our Saviour's
raising 
Lazarus
 from the Dead. Take
likeways notice of the Organes, the
great Pipes whereof 
stand by the
Pillar sides, at a great distance from the
Organ roome, and have the Wind
conveyed to them by a secret conduct;
which tho' it be no difficult thing, yet
it is not common.


From 
Narbonne,
 you have six or seven
Leagues to 
Carcassone;
 They are two,

Ville
 and 
City;
 the City stands upon a
hight about half a Leagues distance
from the Town: It is twice encom∣passed
with Walls and Ditches, and is
very strong, as being upon the 
Frontiers

o
 
Catalonia.
 The Town stands below
in the Plaine, and is much larger, better

uilt, and better inhabited, & Walled a∣bout
with a more modern kind of Fortifi∣cation.
The Town is commended for


Cloath-works, & making of Combs: The
Tradesmen use to bring them to the Innes
as soon as they understand any Stran∣ger
to be arrived; but your best will
be to go to their Houses, and see all, &
try severals, for so you may best please
your self, and make the best bargain too.
There is of all Prices, insomuch that I
have seen ten Pistoles refused for one
single Comb, of Box-Wood. But in∣deed
it was of a vast bigness and most
curiously carved. You may have very
good ones for three, foure, or five Li∣vres
a peece, as also some for 30, 40, &
50 Solds. To be short, there is of all
kindes and prices, and I shall earnestly
intreat you, to bestow foure or five
Crowns, upon some of the midle sort,
that is next to the best, and some again
of the next degree to them for me, (be∣cause
of the carving) to add to my

Tradescants.
 They must be packt up in
a little wooden Box, which the Trades∣men
know very well how to do.


From 
Carcassone
 to 
Thoulouse,
 you
have twelve Leagues, viz. Foure to



Vilpeinte,
 two to 
Castelna
▪ d' Arri,
 two
to 
Vignonnet
 and four to 
Thoulouse.
 The
Second Town (in the opinion of some)
in 
France,
 how justly, I leave to your
self, when you shall see it. The Town
indeed is very big, and well built, all
of Brick; But not very populous, I
think for the want of Trade, in regard
it lyes farr from the Sea. Amongst o∣ther
things, take notice of the following
particulars 
1st.
 The Town House, in the
Court whereof they Show you the
place where the Scaffold was erected,
that 
Monsr: de Momorancy
 was behea∣ded
upon, and some of his Blood yet
Sticking upon the Wall. 
2ly.
 The Par∣liament
House, into which (if it be sit∣ting)
you must neither carry Sword,
nor Spurs, unless you make account
to pay a Forfaulter. 
3ly.
 The Bridge
over the River 
Garonne,
 which is very
stately, built of Brick, somewhat after
the Model of the new Bridge of 
Paris,

having a Foot walk raised on every side,
so that these that pass on foot, are not
troubled with Coaches, Cairts, &c.


that pass in the midle. 
4ly.
 In the con∣vent
(as I take it) of the 
Cordeliers,

there is a Peece of ground under a Chap∣el,
belonging to the Church, wherein
all Dead Bodies, that lye eight and
fourtie hours, are so dryed, but with∣out
the consumption of any substantiall
part, that they become incorruptible
for ever thereafter. They will show
you in a Vault, hard by the Chapell,
some hundred of Bodies, standing a∣bout
the Walls intire and dryed, as I
have said, amongst the rest they show one
bodie of a Woman, called 
la Belle
Paule,
 Mistrels as it is said to some
King, whose name I do not remember:
But it is some hundreds of Years since
she died, and yet me thinks there is a
beautifull Proportion observable in her
Face. The rest of the curiosities con∣sist
in Churches, religious-houses, &c.
which I leave to your self.


From 
Thoulouse
 to 
Montauban
 you
about halfe a Dayes Journey, it is
famous for the Protestant University;
It stands somewhat high and declines


a little toward the Bridge, that stands
over the 
Tarne,
 which not far below
the Town, casts it self into the 
Garonne.

It hath many fine Fountains; but e∣specially
one, which they call the 
Gri∣
one.

It hath good trafique, because of
the situation betwixt 
Thoulouse
 and 
Li∣moge

and 
Paris,
 as also because of the
Commoditie of the River, to 
Bourdeaux:

the Town and Bridge are all built of
Brick. It was formerly very strong,
but because of its Rebellion is now Dis∣mantled
of all Fortification.


From 
Moutauban
 to 
Bourdeaux,
 you
may go by Water in a very short Time,
because the River is rapid; the Coun∣trey
about is very fertile and Pleasant.
You will see by the Way, 
Agen,
 an
ancient City, where 
Iulius Scaliger

was Born: within 4 or 5 Leagues of

Bourdeaux
 stands 
Cadiliac,
 a most deli∣cate

Castle,
 belonging some time to
the 
Duke d' Espernon;
 You must not
faill to see them.


At 
Bourdeaux,
 I did lodge 
au Cha∣peau
rouge;
 but I have been told since,


that there are more commodious 
Inns
 in
Town, which You may easily be ad∣dressed
to. You will meet with severall
of our Countreymen in this Place;
But particularly, Sir 
David Inglish,

and 
Harie Iossy▪
 are of my acquain∣tance.
And therefore, I must desire
you to see them, & permit this, to present
them my service. I must likeways in∣treat
you, to be at the pains, to enquire
for a Doctor of Physick, of the Reli∣gion
that lives here, whose name I
have forgotten; but you will know
him by this, that he hath written in
French Something against Doctor

Willes de Febribus:
 which I remember
Sir 
David Inglish,
 did once send me
to 
Paris.
 And therefore, he may Pro∣bably
know the Man: The Reason I
desire You to speak with him, is, That
you may learn from himself, what he
hath Published, upon this or any other
Subject; and whatsoever they be, I
must intreat You earnestly, to buy them
for me; for I have a very great Ho∣nour
for the Mans Parts, tho' I know


not his Person; and I had the evil
Luck to lend that Book, which Sir

David Inglish
 sent me, to a Doctor at

Paris,
 that did never render it me a∣gain.
Remember to see in the Town,

1st. Piliers tutilarrs,
 which are the Ruins
of an Ancient 
Roman Temple. 2ly.

The Ruins of an Amphitheatre, without
the Town, of 
Roman
 Antiquity like∣ways.

3ly.
 The 
Cheasteau Trompette,

in which there is a Garison keept by the
King. It was pulled down by the Citi∣zens,
in the Time of their last Rebellion;
but since re-built much better and
stronger. 
4ly.
 The 
Port,
 which if you
happen to see in the Time of Vintage,
will be well furnished with Ships from
all Places, and it may be from 
Scotland.
5ly.
 That peece of Ground without
the Town, which they call 
Grave;

which brings forth the best Wine about

Bourdeaux,
 and which for the most part
is sold within the Town, at as great a
Rate as ordinary 
French
 Wine gives
with us: And therefore being there is
no great quantity of it, and that it


would not turn the Merchants to Ac∣compt
to send it here, you may easily
guesse how much 
Graves
 Wine We
Drink in 
Scotland,
 altho' Our People
are pleased to Flatter themselves, that
all their Clarets are such; The rest I
leave to others, to inform you of. I
must only tell you, You will meet with
as good Fruits here as in any place of

France, Des Treffices
 in Latine 
Tuberae
Terrae,
 they are found under the
Ground by the Hogs, who use to smell
them before they come at them, and by
the noise and gests they make, give no∣tice
to their keeper, who presently puts
them by, and Digs the 
Trefice
 for him∣self:
They are in great esteeme, & being
Boyled and pared, use to be eaten by
themselves with Pepper and Oyle, or
else cut down with other things 
en Ra∣goust.

There are likeways here a kind of
small Birds but exceeding fatt, which
they call 
Ortolans,
 which are much pri∣zed
for great Delicacies.


From 
Bourdeaux
 you go to 
Rochelle.

In the way you pass by these Places; first



Blay, Ville et City,
 The City stands on
a Hight and Commands the River. It
was at this Place that of old the 
English

Ships were Obliged to liver their Canon,
which were permitted the 
Scots
 (as a Pri∣viledge)
to keep a Board; as they pas∣sed
to 
Bourdeaux. 2ly. Xaintes
 or 
Saintes,

the Capital Town of 
Xaintonge;
 It stands
upon the River 
Charante;
 here are some
Rests of 
Roman
 antiquity, as of an
Amphitheatre, &c. But especially of an
Arch, upon the Bridge over the 
Cha∣rante,

on which you will read this in∣scription.

Caesari nep: D. Iulij Pontifici
A.
 There is also an inscription, on the
reverse which I remember not. You
will see likeways here a Steeple, the
Stairs whereof that lead to the Top are
on the outside. 
3ly. Brouage;
 about
half a Days Journey from 
Saintes,
 a
little, but one of the most regularly for∣tified
Towns in all 
France,
 in which
there is a continuall Garison keept, as
a Guard for the Salt, of which vast quan∣tities
is made here, by the heat of the Sun
every Year in this manner. They let


in the Sea water by a 
, cut purpose∣ly
in the ground into severall ponds,
cut out likeways of purpose of a cer∣tain
deepness: they fill them in the Sum∣mer
time, and then stop the entries
that no more water come in; when
the Sun hath co
cted it enough, they
gather it together i
 
eaps, and car∣ry
it to places appointed for it. The
Town stands upon a little River which i

navigable, because the Sea flowes a good
way above it, the Salt marshes about
the Town, are little less than four
Leagues about, & render the Town by
so much the more strong. You must be
sure to arrive there at a good Hour in
the day, for at Sun-setting the Gates
are shut, and none whatsoever can
enter. You must Salute the Governour,
or in his absence, the Chief
Off
cer, and
desire Libertie of him to view the Town,
which he will readily grant you, and
appoint a Souldier to wait upon you;
from the Walls, you will discover the
Marshes about the Town, and then he
will bring you to the 
Arsenal,
 and
there you will see their Magazine
of Ai
s, and then having gi∣ven


something to the Souldier to drink,
you may thank the Governour & take
leave of him. This is all that is to be
seen in this place except you make ac∣count
to see the Isle of 
Ol
rone,
 which
lyes without the mouth of the little Ri∣ver,
about a League or two in the
Sea.


From 
Brouage
 you have seven
Leagues to the 
Rochell,
 upon the Way to
which you will have occasion to see a
great many Sea-Plants, such as 
Kali,
Kali Spinosum, Salicornia, Cakeile S
ra∣pionis,
Papaver corniculatum luteum,
Eringium Marinum, Crithmum;
 with
many others.


The 
Rochel
 is much more famous for
what it was, than for what it is, It was
the strongest hold, the Protestants had in

France,
 but after the taking of the
Town by 
Lewes
 the 
13th.
 the Walls
thereof were quite demolished, so
that scarcely the vestiges thereof re∣maine:
the Harbour is considerable, for
it enters within the midle of the Town. At

resent it hath a considerable trafique

 Salt, white Wines, &c.



You must be at the pains to see the Isle
of 
Re,
 about a League from the Town,
but not above a quarter of a League from
the Land. As you go from the 
Rochel,
 to
the place where you are to take Boat to
cross over, they will show you the Ruins
of that Digue, which 
Cardinal Richlieu

caused make by sinking of Barks, loa∣den
with Stones, to hinder all relief
for the Town by Sea, and it was obser∣veable,
that the very day after the Town
surrendered, the Digue was broke down
by Storm, which if it had done but
three days sooner, it may be justly que∣stioned
whether the Town had ever been
taken, especially seeing the 
English
 Fleet
was ryding before the Isle of 
Re.


In the Isle of 
Re,
 there is a 
Citadale,

near to which you will be put a Shore
upon the Island, but it is not usual to per∣mit
Strangers to enter into it. At the
east end of the Island, there is a little
Town called St, 
Martines,
 in which
there are many 
Dutch
 Families, because
of the great trafique the Dutch hath with


this place, for Salt and white-Wines.
The Island is generally of a Sandie Soil,
and only made fertile by the Sea-
Ware

which they throw upon it, and which
in my Opinion is the cause, that all the
Wines both of the Island and about the

Rochel
 tast brackish, especially when
they begin to be old. You will find a∣mongst
other Plants upon the Island a∣boundance
of 
Pancratium,
 except you
come in the latter Season of the Year,
when probably it may not be found.
You may returne at Night to the 
Rochelle,

from whence you have a Messenger to

Paris,
 upon the way to which there is
nothing that I need to trouble you with,
except 
Poictiers,
 that I have not seen my
self, and therefore can say nothing of;
From 
Poicteirs
 your way is to 
Amboise

midway betwixt 
Tours
 and 
Blois
 of
which before.


I must advertise you here, that if you
please you may make this 
Tour
 an o∣ther
way 
viz.
 To 
Nantes,
 as in the for∣mer
advice concerning the 
Petit Tour,

as far as 
Nantes,
 from thence to the 
Ro∣chell,


Bourdeaux, Toulouse, Narbonne,
Montpellier, Avignion,
 and so all the rest
throw 
Provence;
 and then back to 
Avig∣nion,

from whence to 
Lions,
 and so to

Paris
 with the messenger, or coach, which
you like best. For your better under∣standing
in the Country, it will be fit
to carry a Map, or 
Carte
 of 
France
 along
with you, to look upon the situation of e∣very
place as you pass, for doing of which
a litle time will suffice once a day. Let it
be illuminat for the more easie discerning
the different counties and their boun∣ding.
You will do well likewise to car∣rie
a Book with you in 80. called 
Le
Voyage de France,
 which will inform
you of many particulars, that either
were not at all seen and observed by me,
or else have escaped my Memory; and
indeed it is no great wonder if they
have, having been so lazie as not to
make any 
Memoire
 of them whilst they
were yet recent in my mind. And this
is one Reason of the tumultuarinesse and
disorder of this Letter, but I am well
pleased to think, that by the amende∣ments


you will make both in seeing, ob∣serving,
and writing down all things
more particularly, we shall have occa∣sion
afterward to put the Voyage in a
better Dress; I must likeways beg your
Pardon for not having writen to you
sooner, having been several times called
out of Town since I began to write
this Letter: If you find it tedious in read∣ing,
blame your self for being the cause
thereof, and be the more patient, in re∣gard
I shall not have occasion to be
any more so tedious, unless you go for

Italy,
 and give me a timeous advice of
your Intentions.


I shall conclude all with my best wi∣shes
for your health & happy Return, &
most earnestly intreat you not to grudge
us with the effects of a Spare hour, that
seeing at this distance, we cannot be so
happy, as to enjoy you personally; we
may at least by this next best way enter∣tain
a Correspondence, which I assure
you will be a great Kindness to your
Friends here, but to none so much as


to my self who cannot be indifferent
in any thing, that concernes you,
And therefore cannot but be sollici∣tous,
to hear often from you, as the
only thing, that can supply the want
of your person, So much desired and
longed for, by &c.










LETTER III.


CONTAINING
Advice for Travelling into
ITALY.


Written to a Friend


IT is much better to go into 
Italy
 in
the latter end of 
Autumn,
 than in
the 
Spring;
 Because the Change
of the Air is not so much from one Ex∣treme
to another in that Season, as in
the other; for the Mildness of the Win∣ter
in 
Italy
 (especialy upon the 
South
 side
of the 
Appennine
) doth not so much re∣cede
from the Temperatness of 
Autumn

in 
France,
 as the Heat of 
Summer
 in 
I∣taly

exceeds the Mildness of the 
Spring
 in



France.
 It is certain, that if a Man
intend to stay but a half a Year, it is better
to begin the Journey in 
Autumn,
 and fi∣nish
it in the 
Spring,
 than to begin in
the 
Spring,
 and finish it in 
Autumn,

and so be obnoxious to the exces∣sive
Heats of Summer. If one intend
to stay one or more Years, it is un∣doubtedly
best to begin the Journey in

Autumn,
 because the Winter, being
much more clement than usually it falls
out with us, will be easily supported, &
all the Heat that happens in the follow∣ing
Summer, in regard it comes by de∣grees,
will not so readily affect the Bo∣dy,
that hath been already inured to
the Air of the climate, for some Time
before.


The most convenient way of ma∣king
the Toure of 
Italy,
 (in my opini∣on)
is to go through 
Provence
 to 
Cane,

a small inconsiderable Town upon the

Frontiers
 of 
Provence,
 and there to
hire a Felluck to 
Genoua,
 and, if you can∣not
get one at 
Cane,
 to go to 
Nize,

which is but six or seven Leagues fur∣ther,


where you will be sure to find one;
a Felluck is ordinarily of four Oares, and
hath this advantage that you go in it

Ter' a Terre,
 that is so near the land,
that in the case of any danger by Storm
or otherwise, you may easily run on
Shoar and escape it, and besides, land
as often as there is any Town or other
thing worthy the seeing, and likewayes
ly a Shoar every Night, at some good
Town or other. A Felluck will serve
to carrie half a dozen of persons with ease,
besides the Rowers: The Price is not
fixt but more or less as the Fellucks hap∣pen
to be more or fewer in number.
Ours cost us about 11 or 12 Crowns, in
regard there were but few at 
Cane,
 but
you may chance to get one for 8, or 9.
especially if ye be few in number and
not much Baggage; You may provide
every morning to take along with you,
Wine and what Victuals you please, the
rather because sometimes it will happen
that you will have no conveniency of
any Town about Mid-day, and therefore
must Dine aboard Your Fellucke.



The first thing You will meet with,
worthy the taking notice of, is 
Nize,

a City belonging to the Duke of 
Savoy,

it lyes near to the Sea syde, at the very
foot of the 
Alps,
 and hath a very strong
Cittadale belonging thereto: some two
miles from thence stands 
Villa Franca,

one of the best Ports in 
Italy,
 it belongs
likewise to the Duke of 
Savoy,
 and is
guarded with two Castles, one whereof
stands on the top of a Rock, upon which
growes in great aboundance the 
Ficus
Indica.
 Some three miles farther upon
the Coast stands the Town and Palace
of 
Monaco,
 or 
Morgues,
 It is a Princi∣palitie
by it self, and hath very litle
land belonging to it: The place is strong
standing upon a Rock, which is not ac∣cessible,
save at the side where the Palace
stands, and where it joynes with the
land, all the rest being compassed with
the Sea. In the Palace they use to show
1. The Princes Wairdrob, in which
there is good store of Silver plate, and
other Rich furniture, 2. Severall rooms
as Halls, Galleries, Chambers 
&c.
 well


furnished with Hangings, Cabinets, Pi∣ctures,

&c.
 3. A little Garden upon
the top of the Rock, behind the Palace,
made up of earth brought thither on
purpose. At the foot of the Hill near
the Town there are store of 
Carobe

Trees, or 
Siliqua Dulcis, Bauhini
 in 
Pinace.


I must not omit to tell You that you
must be sure at your first leaving of 
France

in the last Town that You happen to be
in, whither it be 
Cane
 or any other, to
get a Certificate of your health and free∣dome
from the Plague, as also of the
freedom of that Town. There are persons
appointed in every place for giving of
such Bills, or 
Patents de Sainte,
 as they
call them. Their Subscriptions are
known to the next Townes about, where
you are to go, so that it is not easie to
counterfit, and besides it were very dan∣gerous
to doe so; They are very scrupu∣lous
in this matter upon all the Coast of

Liguria,
 for fear of contagion; So that
when you arrive at any Town, before
you go a shore, you must send one of your
Boat-men, with your Certification to be


shown to such as are appointed for those
matters in that Place, who immediately
upon the Sight of the Bill permit you,

la Practica,
 that is Libertie to stay in
the Town as long as you please, and
do what you will. When you part
from that, You must take a new Cer∣tificat
to the next Place, and so of the
Rest untill you come at 
Ligorn,
 where
this niceness will end.


You must carrie with you no Secret
Weapon, as Dagger, Pocket Pistols,
or the like: And this is general all o∣ver

Italy,
 except only in the Kingdom
of 
Naples,
 and States of 
Venice
 and

Milan,
 where it is permitted to wear
Daggers. At most Towns in 
Italy,
 You
will be oblidged to leave yonr Hulster-Pistols,
and sometimes your Sword
with the Guard at the Gate you enter
in by: And then they will ask you, by
what Gate you are to go out, and ac∣cordingly
Your Arms will wait for you,
which they will know to be yours, by the
delivery of a Nick-stick given You as
you enter, and which for that purpose,


You must carefully keep. In most
Places, Strangers are permitted to weare
their Swords. Your Cloak-Bag like∣ways
will be visited at every Town, to
to see that there be no Customable
Goods in it, and if there be any Books,
you must give up a List of them to the
Visitor, or Inquisitor appointed for
that end, and he will Signe it with Or∣der
to let them pass, Providing, there
be no Prohibited Book amongst them,
For if there were any such, it would be
Dangerons; yet there are wayes enough
to convey Books, or any other thing
of whatsoever Nature, or Quality, from
any Sea-port, without any Dan∣ger,
which you will easily under∣stand,
after your being a while in
the Country.


From 
Monaco
 you will easily reach

Oneglia,
 which is at about twelve Miles
distance, and about 5 Miles further

Albenga,
 from thence you have seven
Miles to 
N
li,
 & ten more to 
Savona,
 from
whence there rests five Miles to 
Genoua,


All the Coast, of 
Liguria,
 from 
Nize
 to



Genoua,
 & some days Journey beyond

Genoua
 towards 
Ligorn,
 is nothing but
rude 
Alps,
 for the most part infertile and
unhabitable, except towards the Bottom
near the Sea, where there are little
Smal Valleys here and there, both deli∣cious
and Fruitfull. For the rest it is
wonderfull to see with what industry &
trouble, they have been able to place
little smal Villages, as it were in the
Clefts of the Hills, and Plant Olive
Trees, where one would think nothing
but crows could venture to Big. All
this Tract is extreamly hot, especially
in Summer, being directly opposit to
the South, and altogether guarded from
the North, So that the reflection of the
Sun beames, makes a Heat almost in∣supportable.


Genoua la Superba,
 so called from the
sumptuousness of its Buildings, and
so they use to give other epithets to
other Towns, as 
Roma la Sane∣ta,
Fiorenza la Bella, Bolognia la Grassa,
Padua la Dotta, Venetia la Rieta,
 &c. It is
said that 
Genoua
 has 
Montagnie senza legno,
Mare senze pesce, Donne senza Vergonia,


& Gente senza sede.
 It is a Republick &
the Government administred by a Senate.
It is a City of great Trade and very
Rich, and it is said they account usury no
great Sin: It being their Maxim, that 
Cento
per Cento e Niente, Cento Cinquanto per
Cinto e quelcha cosa, du Cento per Cento
e quadagnio Hone
io.
 You may take
notice in the Place; First, of the Situa∣tion
of the Town, and so you may Her∣barize
towards the West-side. 
2ly.

The Senate House, 
3ly.
 The Churches,
and particularly that of St. 
Lorenzo,

which is the Cathedrall, a Stately Fa∣brick
Crusted with Marble. 
4ly.
 That
famous Street, called 
la Strada Nova,

which is composed of so many Palaces,
most of them of Marble: you must by
all means endeavour to see the most con∣siderable
Palaces. Within you will find
them most delicatly Adorned with all
sorts of fine Things, as Statues, Paintings,
&c. You must also see their Gardens,
where besides severall sorts of Flowers,
Shrubs, and Trees, you will likeways


find delicat Fountains, Fish-ponds, and
Grotto's; as particularly in the Palace of
the 
Principe d'Oria;
 I would likeways
have you see the Palace of 
Signior Baldi,

and some other Houses of Pleasure espe∣cially
towards the Sea-port, where they
stand at the foot of the Hill over look∣ing
one another as they mount in de∣grees
in form of a Theatre, and all of
them having a full view of the Sea-port,
which is very spacious and very deep;
but in my Opinion, not so very well
guarded from stormes. That which I
find most considerable in it is, the 
Mole,

which secures the entrie thereof, it being
the best and strongest and in the deepest
Water I ever saw. At the east end of
the port there is a litle Promontory called

Capo de Fara,
 upon which stands a High
Turret, which they call 
la Lanternâ,

from the Top whereof they use to disco∣ver
all Vessells at Sea at a considerable
distance. 
5ly.
 Forget not to visit the
Book-Sellers, but in Regard this is a
generall Remark not to be omited, in
every Town where there any, I shall


say no more of it here, but shall put You
in mind of it now and then.


From 
Genoua
 You must again provide
Your self of a Felluck to 
Ligorn,
 which
you will find readier and at an easier rate,
because of the more frequent Traffick and
intercourse, than from 
Cane
 or 
Nize,
 you
will pass by 
Porta Fino, Leresi, Viare∣gia,

&c. and you wil not find many things
considerable more than I have already
noted on the Coasts of 
Liguria
 betwixt

Genoua
 and 
Nize,
 except that when ye
pass 
Leresi
 a litle, you begin to discover a
large plain, part of which belongs to
the state of 
Genoua,
 and therein are the
Quarries that furnish all 
Italy
 with the
best Marble, and the rest is the Principa∣lity
of 
Massa;
 For the better seeing of
which if you please you may go from

Genoua
 by Horse to 
Ligorne.


Tuscany
 begins about 
Viaregia,
 the
greatest part whereof is under the Do∣minion
of the Great Duke of 
Tuscany.


Ligorn
 is no antient, but yet a very
Handsom and well built City, by 
Fer∣dinand

the first, Great DUKE of

Tuscany,
 of whom you will see a most


stately Statue or rather Colosse, with
slaves Chain'd at his Feet, on each
side kneeling; a litle without the Gate as
you go to the Sea-Port. The Town is
regularly fortified, they say, by the con∣trivance
of the Duke of 
Northumberland,

who was banished out of 
England
 in the
Reign of Queen 
Eli
abeth,
 and well
receaved and much esteemed by the then
Duke of 
Tuscany,
 for his excellent parts
and Qualifications. The Duke for in∣couragment
of Trade hath granted great
Immunities to Merchants of all Nations
whatsomever, which is the great cause
that the Town flourishes so much in
Trade, and is so well Peopled: Severall
Nations have established great Factories
here, but especialy the 
English
 and

Hollanders
 who have made this place,
as it were the staple of all their commerce
into the 
Levant.
 The 
Jews
 also have a
very great freedome here and are not
distinguished by any particular Mark,
as in other places, from other Merchants,
but live Honourably in a particular
Street of the Town, built by them∣selves,


yet not sequestrated from
the rest of the Town by any Wall
or Gate, as they use to be in all other
places, where I have seen them. The

English
 Merchants live very splendidly,
and are very hospitable and courteous,
especially, to their Countrymen, that
Travell that way, under which name
they comprehend all that are Subject to
our King: The Jews 
Synagogue
 here
is the best in 
Italy;
 and therefore wor∣thy
your seeing. They observe our 
Sa∣turnday,

so that if You please to stay,
You may see their form of Worship.
You must take particular notice of the

Sea-Port,
 which is undoubtedly the most
secure and finest in all 
Italy,
 in which
You will see the great Dukes 
Gallies,

which he kee
s for a Guard, to his Coun∣trey
against the 
Turks
 men of War. It
is worth the while to see a 
Gallie
 put out
to Sea, or, as she comes in, for so one
may see the Discipline of the Slaves
to whom the 
Bosson
 delivers the word
of Command by the noise of a Whisle,
the diversitie whereof they are as well


acquainted with, as Horse-men with a
Trumper, or foot with a Drum. If
You be diligent You may meet with se∣verall
curiosities, some naturall, some of
Art, especially from the 
Levant,
 and
all at reasonable Rates: and for the more
commodious doing of this, it will be fit∣ting
to make acquaintance with severall
Merchants, especially 
English,
 who will
either inform You themselves, where
such things are to be found, or else ad∣dress
You to such Persons in the Town,
as may best hap to do it. It is like∣ways
necessary for You to have such ac∣quaintance,
and amongst them some
one confident for returning You Mo∣ney
from 
England,
 or at least for retur∣ning
You, what Money You have not
present Use for, to 
Florence,
 as also for
keping correspondence with; that by this
means, You may send any thing you
please to Your confident at 
London.
 And
because this advice may be usefull in ma∣ny
other Places; I shall be more par∣ticular
in it here for all. I suppose then
You were to send any little Ball for
Trunk from 
Ligorne
 to 
London;
 Your


way would be first to pass it at the Cu∣stom
house, where, I think Books, and
curiosities pay nothing but yet You
must have an Order for Shipping of them,
then You must agree with some 
English

Master of a Ship, bound for 
London,
 for
the portage, and accordingly draw a
Bill of Loading—which is of a common
Stile bearing, 
that such a Ball or Coffer
marked,—(and sometimes it says,
marked as on the Margen, and then the
Mark whether it be Letters or Figures or
both, which is put upon the Goods, is like∣ways
placed upon the Margen of the
 Bill)

is imbarked This
—Day 
of—and
 Year

of God—aboard the good Ship called—now
in the Port of
 Ligorn, 
and bound
for
 London, 
whereof
 Mr:—
under
God is
 Master, 
the which Ball is consign∣able
at
 London 
to
 Mr—
Merchant
 &c.

or bis Order, for which he is to Pay—

English 
Mony, he receiving the said Ball
well conditioned, without Skaith or Da∣mage,

There must be three Copies of
this 
Bill,
 one You must subscribe, and
give to the Master of the Ship, for 



Warrand to carrie his Fraught. The
other two he must subscribe and give
to You, whereof You must send one by
Post with a particular Letter of advice, to
Your correspondent at 
London,
 to war∣rand
him to call for the Goods, at the
Master of the Ship; and the other You
must keep by You for Your own securi∣ty,
in case there should be any miscarri∣age,
either through the Skipper, or Mer∣chants
fault, and then Your Goods may
be imbarked. If You were to send from

Florence,
 then you must in the like man∣ner
pass your Goods at the Custom∣house;
if there be any Books among
them, You must have a particular Li∣cence
as I Noted formerly, and then cause
unball them at the Custom-house, and
set your Mark upon them, and find out
some Boat going for 
Ligorn,
 (which
you will be sure to do,) and take a Note
under the Boat-Masters hand of the
recept of such Goods so marked,
consignable to such a Ma
n Merchant
in 
Ligorn,
 for which he is to pay so
much Fraught, he receiving the Goods


well conditioned. This Note you must
send by the Post to your Merchant in

Ligorn,
 together with Your acquittance
at the Custom house of 
Florence,
 which
will serve to acquit them at 
Ligorn;
 to∣gether
also with particular advice to dis∣patch
them by the first good occasion
for 
London,
 and to take Bills of Loading
for them, whereof you must desire one
Copie to be sent to your self, which
you must keep for your Security, as said
is; From 
Rome
 you must use the same
conveyance to 
Ligorn:
 But from 
Venice

you must address immediately for 
Lon∣don,

and in the same manner as from

Ligorn.
 If you be to send any thing o∣ver
Land, where you go not along your
self, you must make two Letters of
Voiture (having first agreed for the car∣riage
at the Rate of so much 
per Cent.
)
whereof you must give one to the car∣rier,
which is a kind of advice to the
Person you address your Goods to, which
is in this form: suppose from 
Turine
 to

Lions,
 you write thus,




Sir


 I have sent a Bundel marked—by—


Indweller in this Town, and Carrier to

Lions,
 addressed to You, which I desire you
would be pleased to receive, and being in
good condition, Pay for it at the Rate
of—
per Cent.
 and I shall hold you account
thereof, or otherways place it to the account
of—at 
Paris,
 to whom I desire you to ad∣dress
the Bundell and send it with the first
good Occasion, and I shall be Accountable
to him. The carrier will part from hence,
such a Day being the—
Day
 of—and will
arrive at 
Lions
 the—
Day
 thereafter, the
Bundell contains no Merchant Goods, being
only Books, 
&c.
 for my own Privat use
and therefore not Customable I rest.


SIR,


Yours
 &c.




THe other Letter of Voiture is
an Obligation under the car∣riers
hand to You, which you must send
by the Post to your correspondent at 
Li∣ons.

The Form of it ought to be as
follows.






I
 Vnder Subscribed Carrier of 
Tu∣rin,

acknowledge to have received
from—the—
Day
 of—at 
Turin

a Bundell Marked—Weighing—addressed
to—Merchant of 
Lions

to whom I promise to deliver it in
good condition at 
Lions,
 (with the
help of God) or to his Order, he pay∣ing
me at the Rate of—
per
Cent.
 therefore. In witness whereof I
have subscribed their presents with my
hand at 
Turin
 the—
Day
 of—Anno—




I Have been the more particular in these
things, because altho' they may seem
to be triffles, to those that are conver∣sant
in such matters, yet a small mistake,
may be the occasion of a great Miscar∣riage.
I shall now return to put You
in mind of some other particulars, and
1. That in this Place, Oisters are a ve∣ry
great Delicat, there being but one
person that has Priviledge to sell them,
for which he payes a considerable Sum


to the great Duke; I know not well
from whence they are brought, but I
am sure it is from a considerable
Distance: They are keept in the Town-Ditch,
on the East side of the Town,
which is full of salt water, because it hath
communion with the Sea; the keeper
hath a little House hard by, and accor∣ding
to the number Bargained for, takes
them alive & very fat out of the Ditch, &
sells them at the Rate of a Pistole the
Hundred. They are many times put
into the Ditch little, and keept untill
they be big enough, they taste very well,
and are by far the best in 
Italy.
 2. To
the East-ward of the Town, about a
Mile or little more, there is an Hill called

Monte Nero,
 upon which there is good
harbarizing. You will do well to take
a Horse and a Guide with you to the
Place. From 
Ligorn
 you have 15
Miles of Smooth and Plain way to


Pisa.
 It is an Ancient City, some∣times
a common-wealth by it self, and
then both Rich and populous: But since
it was Reduced under the command of


the great Duke of 
Tuscany,
 it is neither
of the two; the far greater part of the
Inhabitants, after the Town was Re∣duced,
chusing rather to abandon their
Native Country, than their Liberty, or
at least preferring a voluntar Subjection
abroad, to a necessitated Slavery at home.
The City is large and Beautifull, divided,
as it were in two by the River 
Arno,
 and
again conjoyned by a beautifull Bridge,
of white Marble. The Air of this Place,
in Winter, is judged to be more Tempe∣rate
than that at 
Florence,
 & therefore the
great Duke uses to pass the Winter here.
There are many things considerable in
this Town; as, 
1st.
 The great Church,
which is a Stately Fabrick, and well a∣dorned
within, as also the 
Batistaria

whereof the Doores, as also of the great
Church, are all covered with Massive
Brass, cast into delicat Figures. 
2ly.
 The
crooked Steeple, which leanes to one side
very far from the perpendicular; some
people alledge it was purposely so built,
but I am more apt to beleeve that the
ground hath miss-given on the one side


by little and little, or rather insensibly,
which may be some part of the Reason,
why it hath hung together so long with∣out
falling, to which the excellencie of
the Cement and Workman-ship hath
contributed very much; my opinion, to
one that narrowly observes, will not
appear to be unreasonable, for the out∣side
is of so many Rows of small Pillars
going round about, and the lower-most
Row, on that side that it leanes to, is
more than half hid in the ground, where
as those of the other are wholy to be
seen; which I suppose could not have
happened otherways, than as I have said.

3ly.
 The Buriall Place, which is the
most stately I ever saw, being a long
quadrangle, well walled and galleried
about, in the midle whereof are very
many Monuments of great antiquity, of
many of the ancient noble Families of

Pisa.
 They are most of them of white
Marble in shape like a Coffine, wherein
the Body of the Dead persons was laid:
Some of them are carved in one Fa∣shion
and some of them in another, and


some of them into excellent Figures. 
4ly

The Dukes Palace. 
5ly.
 The Physical
Garden, together with the Rarities that
are keept in a Gallery belonging to the
Garden, where you will see a very great
Collection of Natural Curiosities. The
Garden uses to have very rare exotick
Plants; but in regard you can have no
access to it, except by the recommen∣dation
of the Physitian, that is Pro∣fessor
of 
Botany
 for the time, therefore I
think it will be worth your while to
make your address to him, for a Liber∣tie,
first, to see the Garden and Gallery;
secondly, to get from the Gardener or
himself, the Seeds, of such as you have a
mind to, and a Peece of the Plant for
drying, if you think fitting; you must
not be negligent here, for this is one of
the best Gardens in 
Italy,
 & in my opini∣on
preferable to that of 
Padua,
 especi∣ally
for exotick Plants. The Universi∣ty,
for the whole Estate of 
Tuscany,
 is
keep'd here, and if you please you may
see the Schooles for all Professions, and
particularly that for the Lawes, where


the most renowned 
Bartholus
 did teach.
Amongst the Booksellers you may find
something to accommodat you, be∣cause
it is an University Town, and I
shall tell you here, because I do not re∣member
to have it done as yet, that,
generally speaking, all sort of Books in

Italy,
 are cheaper than in any other
place where I have been. I pray You re∣member
to get a Couple of the Cata∣logues
of the Garden there, of the last
Edition.


From 
Pisa,
 You have but a small half
days Journey, of very pleasant Way, to

Luca,
 which is a Delicat little Town,
a Republick by it self, and having but
a very small Territory belonging to it;
it is well and regularly fortified with a
dry Ditch, which is keept very cleane
and in good Order, and allways Green:
the Republick is governed by a Prince
or Chief Magistrat, whom they choose
of their own Town, and change him e∣very
two Month: So soon as any one
is chosen, he must leave his own House
and Friends, and retire himself to the


Publick Palace, where he is assisted by
some other of the Nobles, & cannot come
out untill his Government be finished.


The Humour of the people is Chear∣full
and very Civil, and contrary to the
Custome of all 
Italy,
 Men and Women
converse freely amongst themselves or
with Strangers. They use Balls & Dance∣ing,
much after the 
French
 Fashion;
The Religious people use to distill Spirits
and Essences, whereof you may provide
what Quantitie you please, both good,
and good cheap, I wish you might help
a Friend to some of Orange-Flowers
and Myrtles; The religious Women
likeways use to make very prettie Things,
and particularly I remember they use
to sell Stomagers of quilted Silk, which
most people use to wear in the
Winter-time, of one Fashion or an∣other.


From 
Luca,
 if you please, you may
go to 
Pisloia,
 and so to 
Florence,
 or o∣therways
returne to 
Pisa,
 and from
thence, either by Coach or Horse, to 
Flo∣rene.

If the Weather be not too hot, it


is better to go on Horse-back, in regard
of the prospect of the Countrie, which
cannot be had in a Coach. 
Florence
 is
a new Town, but one of the most beau∣tifull
in all 
Italy,
 and therefore called

Fioren
 a la Bella;
 it is situated upon the
River 
Arno,
 which divides it in two sev
∣rall
places, over which stands four fair
Bridges. The City is Counted at least
six miles in Compass; The Beautie of it
consistes in the Stateliness of the Buil∣dings,
the great number of Palaces, the
neateness and cleannesse of the Streets,
occasioned by the largeness and smooth∣nes
of the Stones, with which it is paved;
the many large Places, Fountains, Statues,
Churches, Towers, Convents & Gardens;
Of all which it hath very many of the
best in 
Italy.
 There is scarce any thing
in this City; which is not very well wor∣thie
to be taken notice of▪ but particu∣larly.
1. The Dukes two Palaces, the
Old and the New; In the new the great
Duke himself keeps his Court. It is a

ost magnificent Structure, o
 the 
T
scan

Order of Architecture, but not finished


as yet; The Garden belonging thereto is
very well furnished, with Rare Plants
and Flowers; of which the Catalogue
is Printed, of which I desire You to
bring alongs a Couple of Copies. It
will not be a miss to make Acquaintance
with the Gardener; for, so you will get
what Seeds you please. The old Palace
stands in the great Place of the City, in
the midle of which Place there is a Stately
Colossus of Brass, of 
Cosmus
 great Duke
of 
Florence
 a Horse back, by the Model
whereof that of 
Henry
 the great upon
the new Bridge of 
Paris
 was made.
Near to the Entrie into the Palace there
are severall other Noble Statues of Mar∣ble:
within the Palace it self is that so
much famed, over the World, Gallerie,
which is composed of many Roomes,
containing great Varietie of the choisest
Curiosities; as Sta
ues, Busta's, Base∣relieues,
Paintings, Drawings, Prints,
Cabinets, Jewels, Cameo's, Intaillia's,
with all sorts of 
Anticailles,
 with an
infinite number of Master-peeces of lat∣ter
times. Amongst other things, there


is a Chamber or two full of all sorts of
Armes, amongst which those of 
Charles

the Great and 
Roland,
 with severall
Swords of 
Henry
 the great, also a great
Number of Cymiters, some whereof have
their Scabbards set with Rubies, Eme∣ralds,
and other precious Stones. There
is an ancient Buckler with a Medusa's
Head, Painted by 
Michael Angelo bona
rota.
 I remember to have observed some
ancient Casaques, whose weight I am
confident no Head could sustain, unless
so adjusted to the rest of the Armour,
and that to the Sadle, that the Horse
must have carried all. You must en∣deavour
to get a Writen Inventure of
the severall Curiosities in the Gallerie,
for without that it is not possible to re∣member
every particular; Within this
Palace, the great Duke uses to keep the
most excellent Artisans he can meet with,
of all Trades, to whom he gives consi∣derable
Salaries and Priviledges, whom
you will do well to see, but especially
the Stone-Cutters, of whose Art I intreat
you to take particular notice, and what


Instruments they use, and learne at least
as much of it as may serve to polish
Stones. Amongst other Curiosities of
this Trade, You may see a New way of
Mosaick Work, wherein the figure is
compleated most delicatly, both as to
the parts and Colours thereof, by the
Natural Colours of the severall peeces
of Stones assembled together; and which
is strange, all the lights and shadows re∣quisite
in Painting is herein observed;
So that they can imitate Nature allmost
as fully this way as in Painting it self.
This way differs from the old Mosaick,
in that the particular Peeces that com∣pose
it, are of different Figures accord∣ing
as the colours require; for example,
a Cherrie because it is all of one Co∣lour,
therefore it may be represented by
a Red stone of a round Figure in one
Peece, but the Stalk of it must be of an
other different figure: But in the old
way, all the peeces were Quadrangular,
whatsoever might be the colour or thing
to be represented, and of this kind of
Mosaick you will see a most excellent


Peece in St. 
Peters
 Church at 
Rome,
 re∣presenting
St. 
Michael
 the Arch-Angel
treading upon the 
Devil.
 In this Pa∣lace
likeways, the great Duke keeps a
Chymical Laboratorie, called 
la Fun∣deria,

wherein are made very many
notable preparations with great Faith∣fullness,
especially Spirits and Essences,
which may be bought here at reaso∣nable
Rates, and without fear of being
cheated, as to the goodnes of the things,

2ly.
 Severall Churches and Convents,
particularly the 
Dome
 the out-side
whereof is the most beautifull in 
Europe,

being all crusted with Black. White
and Red Marble, fit
y placed together
in regular figures. The Church with∣in
is Paved with black and white Mar∣ble,
and Richly adorned with Cha∣pels
and Altars; The Cupola is very
Large and Fine insomuch that the Golden
Ball upon the Top of it, which is able to
contain a great many Persons, does not
appear from the Ground to be bigger
than a good Foot-Bal; Near to the 
Dome

stands 
Jota
's Towre, one of the most


admirable Peeces of Architecture, in the
World; being a square Steeple, without
any spite on the Top of it, all crusted
with black, white and red Marble, in
most regular figures from the top to the
bottom; near to it stands the round
Chapel of St. 
John
 delicately payed
with Marble, and adorned with statues,
with a Rich Vase adorned with precious
Stones, wherein the Children are Bap∣tised.
The Doors of the Chapel are of
Brass, all in Figures of personage in
Base-relieve of most admirable Work∣manship;
in this Chapel is the Sepulchre
of 
Jota,
 that renown'd Painter and Ar∣chitect,
upon whom there are some ex∣cellent
Latin verses there ingraven, which
I have lost, but 
o
mend to you to
take a Copie thereof. In the Church
of St. 
Spirito;
 there is an Altar ha
cost
above a Hundred Thousand Crowns,
which were left by a 
Florentin
 Gen∣tleman
for that effect. In the Church

de Sancta Cr

 (I h

Michael Ang

 in∣terred,


and it is said at his own desire,
that he might lye within the View of

Jota
's Towre, which he did so much
admire in his lifetime; Upon his Tome
there are three most delicate Statues, the
one represents Painting; the second, Sculp∣ture;
the third Architecture: in which
three Arts, he was so great a Master.
St. 
Laurence
 Church was magnificently
built by 
Cosmo de Medicis,
 whose Scpul∣chre
is to be seen there. There is that
famous Chapel, which the Dukes con∣tinually
Labour to Finish. It is the
most Glorious thing extant in the World,
there being already bestowed upon the
Workman-ship thereof above eight
Millions of Gold, and I beleeve a con∣siderable
deal more will not perfect it.
It is not very large, but built round; it
is all Mosaik, both the Floore, roofe and
sides; and the least considerable Stones
that compose it, are Jasper, Porphir, Ala∣baster,
Lapis Lazuli &c. there are seve∣rall
nests in the Wall about, where the
statues of the Dukes are to stand as they
lived and succeeded to the another. The


Great Altar is not yet set up, because of
peoples being still at work in the Chapel,
nor is it yet altogether finished, but yet
there is so much done, that to look upon
it, one should hardly think there were any
thing wanting. It is keept in the Dukes
Wardrobe in the Old Palace, of which
I forgot to speake formerly, and there∣fore
tell You now that it is one part of
the old Palace which You must not faile
to see, there being in it a vast Treasure
of Silver and Gold Plate, with many
other Precious things. The Altar is keept
in a little Room by it self, I shall not
under-take to descrive it particularly, but
only desire You to consider well every
part of it, the Richness of the Materials
and excellencie of the Workemanship,
the 
Mosaicks,
 and the 
Christall
 Pillars,
and I believe You will easily excuse my
holding by the general, and omitting to
speak of particulars: I do truely think
that the beauties and excellencies of this
Chapel and Altar, are so great and so
many, that they Deserve a Particular
Book to make them known to the world,


and it may be there is some such work
intended, or alreadie extant, which if it
be I am confident You will take care to
have it.


I must give You notice in this Place,
that You will doe well to Treat with
some of those men that Work about the
Chapel, or else with some of those stone-cutters
in the Gallery for some small
Peeces of all the species of stones; let them
be of such a Bigness as may easily serve
to know them by. I make no doubt but
You may get them at a Reasonable Rate.
But I must earnestly intreat You to mind
those two Species of stones which are
found in Quarries not farr from 
Florence,

whereof the one Naturally represents
Townes and Landscapes, the other is
some what Whiter, and has Trees and
Forrests Represented on it, by little Black
Draughts; I remember to have shown you
a small Peice of each sort, but now I would
have, two or three larger Peeces of both
the sorts, of about a span-Length, and of
the best Marked, for I intend to put them
in frames, as a Cheif ornament of my


Tradescants. I shall hold You compt for
the price. 3. The Place where the wild
Beasts are keept. It is a long square Peece
of ground Walled about, and galleried
on the Top for Spectators; under the gal∣leries
are litle cells that open to the Place,
in each of which there is keept a severall
Wild Beast, such as 
Lyons, Tygers, Leo∣pards,
Woolfs, Beares,
 &c. These have
their keeper that waits upon them, and
Feeds them, and when the great Duke
commands, they are brought out, one or
more, as he Pleases, and bated with
Dogs, or otherwise set to fight with one
another, Upon such occasions strangers
are Permitted to see. 4. The Book-sellers;
of which there are prettie store
here and those well furnished too. You
cannot miss of a 
Casalpinus de Plantis

or two, for it was Printed in this Place.
If You can get his appendix 
ad libros de
Plantis,
 You will oblidge me to bring it
with You; it was Printed by it self at

Rome.
 You may possibly meet with
other good Books, for it is ordinar when
Learned men die▪ for Book-Sellers to buy


their Books. I must likeways put You
in mind to buy a Printed Paper for me,
that was Published at 
Florence,
 called

Testis examinatus;
 it containes two or
three figures of the 
Testicles
 with a short
Description thereof, in one single leaf.


There is one Dr. 
Kirton
 Dr. of 
Phy∣sick,

He is a very civill and obligeing
Gentleman; If he be yet alive he will be
Your Interpreter: and if You need not
that, he will help You to expede the rest
of Your affairs; in short, both his coun∣sell
and his company are to be esteemed;
He is an 
English
 Man born, low in stature
and prettie ancient.


You must not faill in this Place to
take notice, of the variety of Fruits, &
Wines; as the Red 
Florence
 Wine, which
is counted the best for ordinar Drinking,
being stomachical and without Sweetnes.
The White 
Florence
 Wine, which is
Sweet; 
Verdea,
 which is delicious small
Sweet white Wine; 
Monte Pulciano,

White and Red, both very good Wines,
so called from the Place they grow upon,
and many more such.



If You happen to be here in the Sum∣mer
time, especially when the Grapes are
Ripe, You will find in the Markets great
Varietie of Fowles and small Birds, where∣of
I intreat You to take notice, but espe∣cially
of those kinds, that are not common
with us, and try to get their Skins,
which may be easily done, when the bird
hath not been long Dead; the rump must
be left at it for preserving of the Taile;
The Head, Wings and Feet must be like∣wise
left, and only tbe body taken out, &
so the Skin filled with Flax or Cotton.
This I intreat You to remember to doe
wheresoever You shall happen to be in
the Summer time, and if any such occasion
Present it self to You in Winter, not to
ommit it.


From 
Florence
 to 
Rome
 You have 140.
Miles; there are severall wayes of Tra∣velling,

viz.
 by Coach, by 
Procaccio
 or
Messenger with whom you agree for so
much; as is usuall in 
France:
 and by
the 
Viturin,
 that is, by hyring of Horse
at a certain Rate, & Paying for Your own
entertainment at every part as you pass.


If you be acquainted with the customes
of the Countrey, and have Language
enough to make Your self understood,
this last way is the best, because you will
be sure to fare better, and cost you no
more, than you would otherwise Pay to
the Messenger, who will be sure to pro∣vide
the worst chear for you, that he
may make the better for himself: in short,
it is best to be Master of your own Purse,
and not live at the discretion of Your
Conductor. I have forgot hitherto to
tell you that there is some Incommoditie
for Travellers upon the Road, as to their
Bedding, their Cloaths espiecially, the
Sheets being for the most part very nasty,
and it is but now and then that either
money or fair words can procure a Pair
of clean Sheets. The best remedy I know
is not to put off ones Cloaths, and to wrap
ones self, especialy the Head, in their
Cloak, that the face and Hands may
not touch any unclean thing; in short
a litle Patience will do it, and you will
be sure to be better accomodated in good
Towns.



The places You are to pass by, are
Cheifly these as follows.

There are not many considerable things
to be seen upon this Road; 
Siena
 was a re∣publick
by itself, but was reduced by the
Emperour 
Charles
 the 
5th.
 and by his Son

Philip
 Gifted to the Great Duke of 
Tus∣cany,

under whose Power it still Remains.
The Town is of a good bigness, and com∣mended
for it's Situation, and the purity
of the 
Italian
 Tongue. The 
Dome
 or great
Church is a statly Fabrick; it is Paved with
Marble, but especialy the Quire, upon
which is most Curiously Graven the Hi∣story
of 
Abraham
 Sacrificeing his Son, and
History of the 
Maccabees,
 and for the
better Preservation of them they are co∣vered
with Matts. There is likewise an
entrie from the Church to the Biblio∣theck
of 
Aeneas Sylvius,
 who was born in
this Town. He was once Legat from the

Pope
 into 
Scotland,
 and afterwards Cre∣ated

Pope
 himself, and took the name of

Pius Secundus.
 He was a Man of great
Learning. The late 
Pope Alexander
 VII.
was Native of this Place, of the Family
of 
Chigi;
 his Statue is to be seen in the
great Church. The greatest Part of the


and the Towre belonging to it are of
Black and White Marble without. In
the Church of St. 
Dominic,
 amongst
other Relicts, is preserved the Head of St.

Catharine
 of 
Siena.
 The Tovvne is
well watered with many fine Fountains.
The great place is made with a kind of
Descent Theatre ways, so that from the
middle of the Place You may see
all that walk in it. 
Montefiascone
 is
famous for a most Delicious Kind of

Muscatello
 Wine, which You must be sure
to Tast. The Messenger uses to Dine
without the Town, but you will be sure
to fare better and get better Wine with∣in;
There goes a storie that a 
German

killed himself in this Place with Drinking
excessivly of this 
Muscat.
 As you goe
from thence to 
Viterbo
 you will find a
kind of 
Aspalathus,
 which I take to be

Acacia altera Angularae.
 It growes as high
as our Broom, and is plentifull enough, so
that you will easily discover it.


From 
Viterbo,
 all that distance to 
Rome

is called the 
Campania
 of 
Rome,
 in which
it is thought most dangerous to sleep in


the Summer time, therefore if you fortune
to travel it in Summer, whither to 
Rome

or from it (the same is under stood of
40. Miles distance round about 
Rome
)
you must be sure not to sleep in the 
Cam∣pania,

which you may easily avoid by
Travelling in the night. when you arrive
at 
Rome
 you must give up your name
at the Port; your Countrey, the Place
from which 
ou came last, and the house
you goe to Lodge at: and from thence
you must go 
a la dogano,
 or to the Custom
House, where your Cloakbag must be
Searched, and from thence to your lodg∣
ng
place, according to the Billet given

ou at the Port, without which no House

eeper dare receave a stranger; But they

re things of Course and effectuat with∣out
any trouble. You will doe well to
Lodge in a Pension for the first week, un∣till
you have made some acquaintance, by
means whereof you may be fullie infor∣med
where to light upon a convenient

Camera locanda:
 There was two 
French

Pensions, and one 
English
 in my time.
The first of the 
French
 was 
Al monte d'oro.

The second was 
nella strada del Populo



The English pension was in the same 
stra∣da
del Populo, alla villa di Londra:
 we had
severall Countrey men living in the
Town in my time, as particularly 
signior
Roberto Pendrick,
 a worthie old Gentle∣man,
and most obligeing to his Count∣rey
men, he was my particular good friend;
and I make no doubt but you will find
him so, for I hear he is still alive, and
I wish he may be long so. He lives in a
House of his own upon the 
Triuita di
monte.
 There is an other called 
Signior don
Gulielmo Lesly,
 He is Chaplain to Car∣dinal

Carlo Barberino
 and lives 
nella Can∣cellaria.

I dare be confident to give you
this man for one of the most faithfull
Friends in the World, and one in whose
goodness, prudence, Kindness, and good
Conduct you may trust ten Thousand
Lives: to be short you will find I am not
mistaken, when I call him 
deliciae huma∣ni
generis,
 for in all my lifetime I never
knew another like him, make it their
whole work and study to find opportu∣nities
to oblige every Countrey-man ac∣cording
to his condition: The p
r of


them, with Food and Rayment and what∣soever
else they may stand in need of, and
all other men with continual offices of ci∣vility.
By his means you will get to see
many of these things I shall recommend to
you hereafter. If I Know of your going to

Italy
 in time, I shall have a Letter there
before you. Your best convenience for
Lodging and Diet will be 
a Camera Lo∣canda.

You may take it in that place of
the town that suits best with your occasi∣ons,
you will pay for it by the month,
less or more according to the goodness of
the Chamber and furniture thereof. As
for your diet it will be drest in the House,
and you must tell at night what you In∣tend
to eat next day, that they may pro∣vide
it for you: As for the prices you can∣not
be easily Cheated, because as to that,
most things are Regulated, And in the
quantitie it is not possible you should be
overreached because all things are sold
by weight. There are severall Kinds of
Bread used in this City, but that which
is called 
Papaline
 is undoubtedly the best.
There are likewise many sorts of Wines,


some of them 
Galliardi
 or strong, as 
Greco,
Muscatello di Saragosa, Lagrima
 &c.
others are 
Legieri,
 or small, and they are
many; the best for common use is 
Albano,

which You may drink pure: and it is re∣markable
that there are but few places in

Italy
 where Water may be Drunk safe∣ly,
and because one may be mistaken in
the choise, the best remedy is to Drink
none at all. There are great variety of fruits
according to the Seasons of the year, I shal
only desire you to be cautious, and not
to eat too much or too often of any, but
especialy, of 
Melons, Cucumbers,
 and the

Malanzane,
 or 
mala insana,
 which are a
Kind of 
Solanum Pomiferum.
 There are
good store and Many Kinds of Fishes,
especialy Sea Fish, whereof the best are,

Sols, il Pisce Capone
 &c. The 
Tunino
 is
a great Fish as big as our 
Salmond,
 and
Red like it, but harder and dryer a great
deale, the bellie of it is verie fatt and they
use to Salt and sell it in the Taverns, be∣ing
sliced in small peeces upon a Trencher;
Fresh 
Sturgeon
 is very common; 
Lobsters

are much harder and worse to disgest


than ours: as for fleshes, 
Bufalo
 is only
eaten by the Poorer sort of people; Beif
which they call 
Vacina
 is good; 
Vitella
campo reccia,
 or Hudron is good, but
above all the 
Vitella mongana
 or sucking
Veal. Lamb is worth nothing, nor Mutton
either, which they call 
Castrato,
 and
serves only to make Broath for Sick Peo∣ple;
Kids are good. In the Winter-time
there is is abundance of 
Sangliers
 or wild
Boars, as also 
Porcepics.
 The Snow in that
season, driving them from the Hills to the
Valleys, where they are Killed by the
Hunters. There is likeways great Varie∣ty
of Fowl. There is none so common as
Quailes, at two seasons of the year, that
is, the Spring when they come into 
Italy,

and the latter end of 
Autumn,
 at which
time they are much fatter and better
when they go from it. It is said that they
draw together to the Coast side, and
there wait for the rest of their number
a whole Moneth, and then at last, their

Caravan
 being complete, they flee away
nearer the Sunn in a great cloud. The

Pigione Sotto hanca
 are the biggest and


fattest, and best for eating in the world:
they are good in all seasons of the year.
About the time of Vintage there are great
Variety of small Birds, all very fatt &
good, and at easie Rates, amongst which
the 
Ortolani,
 and 
Beccafiche
 are most
esteemed.


As for the things to be seen here, they
are so many, and so considerable, that
it would require a large Volume to de∣scribe
them, and there are abundance
of such Books extant, to which I referr
you, and especially to one in 80. called

L' Antichita di Roma di Andrea Fulvio:

but you must not fail to get an 
Anti∣quario,

who for a certain Summ of two
or three Crowns will show you all the
particular Antiquities and considerable
places of the Town, and as for the fuller
information of them your Book will
serve you: I shall only hint at some∣things
worthie to be taken notice of; 1.
The Court; that is, the Pope, Cardinals,
Prelates, Monsigniorie &c. There are
some great Holy days, when the Pope
Celebrats Mass in person; it will be sit to


wait upon some of these occasions, for
then you will see the Grandeur of the
Court and the forme of a Cavalcata,
together with the Popes ordinary Guards.
2. The Churches. 3. The Palaces; espe∣cially
those of the 
Vatican,
 together with
the Bibliotheck and Gardens of 
Belvidere,

in which amongst other things take par∣ticular
notice of the statue of 
Ly
aon
 with
the Serpents wreathed about him; There
is an other Garden also belonging to the

Vatican,
 in which there are many exo∣tick
Plants, it was planted by the Popes or∣der,
by 
Tobias Aldinus
 and is Keept still
in reasonable good order; amongst other
things you will find the 
Cameripses,
 or

Camedactylus,
 of the bigness of a Low
Tree and carrying Fruit; there is like∣wise
a 
Grotta
 or water work, and very
fine Fountains of water, about which
grows plentifully the 
Capillus veneris
Major
 or 
Ramosus.
 and 
Arum Aegypti∣um
Mathioli, sive Colocasia,
 which is a
plant carying no stalk, flowr nor fruit
in 
Italy
 (I know not what it does in its
native Soyle) but only broad Leaves
very large and round.



The Palace of 
Farnese;
 and in it that
Gallery whereof the Painting in 
Fresco

by 
Aniball Caraccio
 is so famous, and
the 
Tauro
 which is kept in a little House
a part, in the back court of the Palace. It
is the noblest piece of Art extant in 
Rome

altho it be very antient, as being one of
those named by 
Pliny,
 to have been in
his time in 
Foro Trajani;
 yet it is not
only intire, but as beautifull as if it had
never been moved out of the place it
stands in now.


The Palace of 
Principe Pamphilio;

it stands in the 
Piazza Navona,
 where
you may take notice of that Glorious
Fountain made by Cavelier 
Bernini,

whereupon the top of a little artificial
Rock, are placed, four great delicate
Marble Statues, representing the foure
great Rivers of the World, and each of
them pouring out of a Vale placed under
one Arme, a great quantitie of Water,
and in the middle of the four there stands
one of these 
Gulias
 graven with 
Aegypti∣an
Hieroglyphicks,
 brought from 
A
gypt

by the Antient 
Romans.
 They use to


stop the way-goe of the Water, some∣times
in the Summer, and lett the Place
overflow with Water, and then Peo∣ple
come toward the evening, in their
Coaches, and drive softly up and down
the water to take the 
fresco,
 which is
one of the greatest 
Gusto
's in 
Rome.


Palazzo Borghese,
 Standing near to the

Ripetta. Palazza Palistrino;
 and
in it the library, where you may see
two copies of the 
Hortus Eystetensis,

one illuminated and the other not; Mr.

Lesty
 will command you a sight of that
when you please, for it belongs to 
Car∣dinall
Francisco Barberino.


The Popes Palace of 
Monte Cavallo,

and the Gardens thereof. 4. The 
Villa
's:
as first that of 
Borghese,
 which is with∣out
the walls: there is a particular Book
to be sold by the House keeper, that
sufficiently descrives it and all the beau∣ties
of it, to which I Refer you. 
2ly.

the 
villa
 or 
Palazzo medici,
 belonging
to the great Duke of 
Tuscany.
 It stands
upon the 
monte Trinita,
 the Hall is ador∣ned
with a great many Pillars stand∣ing


about the Walls, of most delicat
Marbles, and the Originalls of a great
many 
Illustres
 and 
virtuosi.
 In one of
the Chambers there is a most beautifull
statue of 
Venus,
 of 
Grecian
 Antiquitie.
In the Garden there is a Noble statue of

Cleopatra,
 the Ruins whereof were repar∣ed
by 
Michaell Angelo bona rota,
 and
many other statues 
Base Releiv
's and

Vases,
 which for Brevities sake I must
omit, and refer you to the particular
Books that treat of those things, But
most of all to your own diligence in
viewing them and keeping a punctuall
Register of all that you see, and so I
shall only name some of the 
Villa
's
that remain, and are most considerable.
As the 
Villa Montalto;
 The 
Villa Ludo∣visi,

where amongst other Admirable
things the statue of the dying 
Gladi∣ator

is excellent. The 
Villa Farnesi;
 The

Villa Pamphilio,
 which is a pretie way
without the walls, and the rest which
I leave to your sight.


5ly.
 The Castle of 
St. Angelo,
 which
formerly was the Burial Place of 
Hadrian



the Emperor. 6. The Hospitalls; Parti∣cularly
that of St. 
Spirito,
 which is a
most magnificent Structure, and well ap∣pointed
in all things. They will show you
amongst other remarkable things, the
Place where the Children of such a Big∣ness
are permitted to be put in, without
any further inquirie made after them,
or who brought them. By this means
the Life of many a Child hath
ben saved, which otherways would
have been taken away to prevent the dis∣grace
of the Parents. They are no soo∣ner
put in, but Nurses are got for them:
If they be Boyes, when they come to a
convenient Age they are put to Trades,
according ro their several Inclinations
and Capacities. But if they be Girles,
then when they come to the Years of
discretion, if they incline not to a Religi∣ous
Life, every one of them is provided
with so much Portion to Marry her
with, out of the common revenue of the
House; And then upon a certain Day
appointed for that purpose; all 
Zitelle
 or
maids come in Procession, one after ano∣ther,


with their Faces Vail'd, and the Men
that come there upon such Days, of pur∣pose
to choose a Wife, (for all of them
have a like Portions) pitch upon such as
please them best, and present them a Nose∣gay,
after which, she is sequestred from
the rest, & the Marriage Solemniz'd, after
the Man has given Information of him∣self
and sufficient Caution that he shall
provide a Lively-hood for her. There is
a very fine little Garden that belongs to
the Hospital lying just upon the 
Tyber.

It uses to be well furnished with Plants,
and I have seen the 
Dictamnus Creticus

in flowre there. 
7ly.
 The Convents; as
particularly the 
French Minims
 upon the

Monte Trinita.
 In the upper Gallerie of
their Cloyster there is a Dyall, where the
Sun beams, entering by a small round
hole, Point the Hours. It was made by

Marsennus
 that famous Mathematician,
a Father of their Countrie and Order.
They have likeways, in a particular part
of their Garden some rare Plants, as 
Ma∣lus
punica flore amplissimo pleno & Varie∣gato.



The 
Minerva;
 which was anciently the
Temple of 
Minerva,
 and now is the Chief
Convent of the 
Domini
ans
 in 
Rome.

In my time there was a 
French
 Father
there called 
Padre Barilieri
 Secretarie to
the General for his Nation; He was a
great Virtuoso, and exceedingly well
versed in the whole Historie of Nature;
He had a very Curious Collection of ma∣ny
Naturall Things, and was about to
have Published a Large Book in 
Folio,

wherein he had designed a Natural Histo∣ry,
with a great many cutts, which he
showed me. If the Book be Published,
I should be very glad to see it; if he be
alive, it will be worth your while to pro∣cure
his acquaintance. He hath also a
Garden well stored with Plants at St.

Xisto.


The 
Roman
 Colledge; where there is
a famous shop and Laboratorie for 
Phar∣macie,

as also a Garden.


8ly.
 The Capitol; the middle of the
Place before it, is the Statue of the Em∣perour

Marcus Aurelius,
 a Horse-back in
Brass; It was brought thither from the


Place before St. 
John de Lateran,
 and is
thought one of the best Modells in the
World. At the Top of the Staires, as you
enter into the place are two Horses, one on
every side held by a Slave in Marble.
They were brought thither from the
Ruines of 
Pompey
's Theatre. There is
also in the same Place two Trophies of

Marius;
 there is also 
Columna milliaris,

with a Brass-ball on the Top of it; there
used to be such a one at every miles end,
upon the common Roads; & from thence
came their Fashion of counting the miles

per Lapides,
 as 
primo ab urbe Lapide

was a mile from the Town &c. The Ca∣pitol,
as it now is, consists of three Pala∣ces
all of Excellent 
Architecture,
 and
beautified, both within and without
with Painting, Statues, and other Mo∣numents
of antiquitie; the particular
Relation whereof I referr to the Books
that are written thereof, and particu∣larly
to one called 
Roma antica & Mo∣derna,

& to the particular demonstration
of the 
Antiquario,
 for I find it will be
utterly impossible to discourse of every


particular, unless I should resolve to
compile a Volumn.


The rest of the Monuments, and rests
or rather ruins of Antiquitie, I shall pass
over, and only name a few of them; as
for example, first, the Walls of the City,
which were built by 
Bellisarius
 Captain
of the Guards to 
Justinian
 the Emperour.
The breaches have been repaired by seve∣rall

Popes.
 The Ports for the most part are
the same they were anciently, only the

Porta del populo
 was made a great deal
more stately, at the first Entrie of 
Chri∣s
ina

Queen of 
Sweden
 into 
Rome.

There is a long courten of the Wall be∣twixt

Porta del populo
 and 
Villa Borghese,

under which it seems the Ground has
misgiven, so that the Wall bendeth, &
is therefore called 
Muro torto.
 Near to
this place also, is the Burial Place 
delle
Cortegiane,
 there being no Christian
Burial or Holy Ground allowed to such
persones. There is good Herbarizing
about the walls, especially on the out-side,
and particularly you will find a Plant
there which is not common else where, at


least that I have observed, viz. 
Sature
a
Spicata sive Thymbra S. Juliani
 
 Sa∣tureia
vera Lobelii.
 Upon the Wall of
the City, close by the Port of St. 
Paul

in 
via ostiensi;
 there is yet extant a Py∣ramid
built of Marble, which was the
Burial Place of 
C. Ces
ius Septemvir E∣pulonum.
Secondly.
 The old Temples;
whereof there are so many that it would
be tedious to describe them all, I shall only
name some, 
viz.
 The 
Pantheon
 now cal∣led

Madonna della rotunda;
 It was built
by 
Marcus Agrippa,
 Son-in law to 
Au∣gustus
Caesar,
 in Honour of all the Gods.
It had the Fortune to escape almost totaly,
the ruine, and fury, which the Goths &
Vandals brought upon the 
Roman Em∣pire

and magnificence thereof. I admire
the Roofe of it, being so large and so flat
without any Pillar, to support it, and al∣tho'
it be a Vault, it hath no nevil∣stone
to bind it in the middle, but in place
thereof a round hole so wide that it
lights the whole Roome abundantly, nor
is there any other Window in the Fa∣brick.
The next thing I admire in it is



he Doore-Cheeks and couple which is
all of one Peece of white Marble. The
Door opens in two leaves, very wide &
very high, they were covered with 
Corin∣thian

Brass, as was also the whole Roofe,
until the time of 
Vrban
 VIII. who
took it off, and covered it with Lead
as it now is, and made thereof the
great Altar of St. 
Peters,
 and some pee∣ces
of Ordinance, that are keept in the
Castel St. 
Angelo,
 as will testifie a par∣ticular
inscription at the side of the pan∣theon
Doore, made by the 
Popes
 com∣mand.
Upon this occasion was that

Pasquinad; Quod non fecerunt Barbari,
fecere Barberini.
 It has a most stately

Portico
 before the Gate, of a great many
large tall Pillars of Egyptian black and
white speckled Marble; the descent into
the 
Portico
 from the Street is of ten or
twelve steps, but it is said, before the ru∣ine
of the City, that there was as great an
ascent to it; whence it may be gathered,
what an universal & great devastation of
buildings must there have been to fill up
so great a deepth. And indeed it is obser∣ved,


that when they have any occasion
to dig, it is long before they come, in
most places, to the 
terra Virgine,
 that is,
which hath not formerly been broke u∣pon:
and when they are digging into old
ruins, for 
Anticails
 (as they are conti∣nually
doing in severall places) they
leave off when they come to the 
Terra
Virgine.
 Before the 
Portico
 there is a
large coffine, with it's cover and suppor∣ters
of Porphyre which they commonly
call 
Agrippa
's 
Tombe.


Near to the entrie of the Camp of 
Va∣cino,

at the bottom of the back stairs that
lead to the Capitol, there is a Chapel under
ground, which was formerly the Prison
of St. 
Peter
 and St. 
Paul,
 when they
suffered for the Holy name of 
JESVS.

It was then called 
Tullianum,
 according
to that of 
Cicero; est locus in carcere quod
Tullianum appellatur.
 The Temple of 
Sa∣turn

is hard by, which in ancient times
was the 
Aerarium publicum,
 in which the
Publick Treasury was keept.


Thirdly, the 
Amphitheatres;
 most part
of which are Ruined, especially that


which was built by 
Titus,
 now 
alled the

Coliseo;
 by the part thereof that is stand∣ing
you may abundantly Judge of the
Magnificence of the whole, when it was
extant. There is good Herborizing within
it, and there is one 
Dominicus Pa
arolus

that hath Writen 
Catalogus Plantarum
Amphitheatralium;
 with the rest of his
works in 
0. 
Romae, apud 
ranciscum
Monetam
 1652. to which I refer You.


Fourthly, the 
Aqueducts;
 of which
the most part are ancient: when they
come near to the City, they are convey'd
under ground to several Fountains in the
City, and some of them so deep, that it
is Prodigious by what art they could
have Peirc't so deep, as for example, the

Aqua Virgine,
 which is the sweetest and
best for use in all 
Rome,
 is conducted
so deep thro' the 
Monte Trinita,
 That
in the 
French Minims
 Garden there is
a descent of six or seven score steps to
come at it. Amongst all the Fountains in

Rome
 the most beautifull are in the 
Pi∣azza
Navona,
 in the 
Piazza
 St. 
Pietro,

the 
Tre Fountane, &c,




5ly
 The 
Thermae,
 or Baths; as the

Thermae Diocletianae
 built by the Empe∣rour

Diocletian.
 It is said that ten thou∣sand
Christians were imployed about
this work, and all cruely Massacred when
they had finished it. It is now a Mona∣stery
of 
Carthusians,
 in whose common
Garden I remember to have seen the
Myrtus 
Buxifoliis.
 The ruins of 
Thermae
Antonini Caracallae;
 they are situated 
ad
Radicem Collis Aventinae.
 I have seen
amongst these Ruins that kynd of Ca∣pillary,
which is called 
Hemionitis,

and no where else that I Remember of.


Sixthly the two Columns of 
Antoninus,

and 
Tra
an
 Emperours; The Statue of
St. 
Peter
 stands upon the Top of one,
and that of St. 
Paul
 upon the other:

Trajan
 was so well beloved of the Peo∣ple
that to make a place, which in ho∣nour
of him they called 
forum Trajani,

in the midle of which this Column stands,
they levelled a great Hill, of the precise
hight of the Column it self. Both the
Columns are of white Marble, and all
the out side Historified in base relieue,


in a spirall line beginning at the bottom
and ending at the top. That of 
Trajan

hath the whole storie of the 
Dacian
 War.
There is a great Book in 
Folio
 of this Co∣lumn,
wherein all the figures are cutt in
Brass, and the Large description thereof
added. I have forgot the Authors name,
but I believe You will find the Book 
Al
insegna di Parigi alla pace
 from 
Jacomo
Rossi.
 where you will likewise find all
other sorts of Prints and T
lledouces.
The Columne of 
Antoni
us▪
 is 160 foot
High and that of 
Trajan
 128. Altho'
they apear to be but smal yet each of them
hath a Stair-Case within, that leads to
the Top. There are some others but less
Considerable, as that which stands before
St. 
Maria Majore,
 which was one of the
Pillars of the 
Templum Pacis,
 brought
hither by 
Paulus
 V. who placed a Bra∣sen
Statue of the Blessed Virgine upon
the Top thereof. There is likewise not
far from the same place a little Column
with a Crucifix on the Top of it, erected
in memorie of the absolution given to

Henry
 the IV. King of 
France;
 In the


Capitoll likewise there are two 
viz.
 the

Columna milliaris,
 of which already,
and the 
Columna Rostrata,
 which you
will see when you view the fine things
within that part of the Capitoll whi
h
stands next to the River, where the Hill
is most steep and was anciently called

Tarpeia Rupes.


Seventhly, the Triumphall Arches; as
particularly that of 
Septimius Severus;

That of 
Titus;
 and that of 
Constantine

&c.


Eighthly, the Bridges upon the River.
Ninthly, the 
Obelisks;
 most part where∣of
are graven with 
Aegyptian Hierogly∣phicks.

The best of them is erected in the
middle of the place before St. 
Peters,
 upon
the back of four Brazen Lyons, and a
large Pedestal of Marble. The next best
is at the 
Porta dell Populo.


Tenthly, the 
Septem Colles
 or 
Montes;

upon which 
Rome
 is said to be built 
viz.
Mons Capitolinus, Mons Palatinus, Mons
Aventinus, Mons Celius, Mons Esquili∣ne
s.

(where the House of 
Virgil
 was
and the Garden of 
Mecoenas,) Mons Vi∣minalis



and 
Mons Quirinalis,
 called now

Monte Cavallo
 where the Popes Palace is.


Eleventhly, some other Hills: as the 
Ja∣nicular,

which is a Chain of Hills with∣out
the Walls in the 
Trans
evere.
 And
the 
Mons Testaceus,
 which is nothing but
a heap of broken earthen Pots and bricks;
for in ancient times these were so much
in use; and the 
Figuli
 or Tradesmen that
made them, so numerous, that there
was a necessity of appointing them a
particular place, and that by publick
edict, for throwing the Ru
bish of their
Furnaces and the pot sheards that broke
in the Baking into, least otherwise if it
had been permitted to throw them into
the River, it might have occasioned an 
n∣undation
of the City. In process of time
it grew to the bignes of the third part of
a Mile in Compass, and a Hundred &
Sixtie foot in hight. This Hill is within
the Walls not far from the side of the
River, as also 
Mons Vaticanus
 in 
Trans∣
evere,

so called 
a Vaticiniis
 which used
to be made there: The Palace of the 
Va∣tican

stands upon it.



Twelthly, 
Roma subterranea;
 com∣monly
called the 
Catacombs,
 whereof

Bosio
 hath writen a large Volumn in

Folio.
 There are two of them, both
without the Walls. One of them is at St.

Sebastion
's Church. They are 
Caverns

digg'd under ground in the forme of a
Town, that is, larger and lesser streets
crossing one another, in some place lower
so that You must be forced to stoop, but
in others higher than a Mans hight, and
all along as you go upon the one Hand
and the other, as thick as they can stand
one by another, are holes or nests where∣in
were placed the bodies of the Dead,
one by one, upright upon their feet, and
so the nests Plastered over. The Bodies
and reliques of many Saints and Martyrs
have been found here, and were known
to be such by the Cross found upon
their Sepulchers, with this Inscription

Pro CHRISTO.
 You must take good
lights and a good guide to conduct You,
for some have mistaken their Way and
never found an outgate. The Second,
I need not describe it.



There are severall things about 
Rome

worthie the taking notice of, as 1. 
Ponte
mola
 a Bridge standing upon the 
Teve∣re;

in Latine 
Anio,
 some two miles from
the Town, before it joynes with the 
Ty∣ber.

You go to it by the Port 
del Populo.

It is considerable for it's Antiquity. It
was at this Bridge that 
Constantine
 the
great vanquished 
Maxentius
 the Tyrant:
There having appeared to him before
the Battle, in the Firmament, a red Cross
with these words 
in hoc Signo vinces.
 the
story is Painted in 
fresco
 in the Palace
of the 
vatican
 by a great Master, where
You may see it and You will seldome
miss Painters in the Roome a Copying
of it. 2. The City of 
Tivali,
 in Latin

Tibur;
 by the way You will pass a little
River, The Sulphureous and noysome
smell whereof You will perceive at a
Miles distance; it is of a whitish Colour
as if Meall were mingled with it; there
is a white slymie Sulphureous substance
adhering to the sydes and bottom of it,
which is soft whilest it is under Water,
but being once dryed becomes very hard,


they use to make counterfeit comfits, 
&

which they call comfits of 
Tivoli
 and
use to Cheat People with them for sports
sake. The River runs into the 
Tiverone

and spoils the Water thereof, and in my
Opinion, does much harme the Water
of the 
Tyber
 it self, because the 
Tiverone

joyns with it before it come at the City
of 
Rome.
 The Town is verie ancient,
having several marks of great Antiqui∣ty,
as 
Sybilla
's Temple, 
&c.
 close by the
Town the River 
Teveron
 falling from
a great hight over a Rock makes that
famous 
Cascata
 so much talked of. It
makes a horrid noise and continues fro∣thy
and working for a good way below
the fall, and hath made a Million of
meanders and strange figures in the Rock
where it falls. A little below the fall there
is a Bridge over it of a considerable hight
above the Water, where if You stand
a while you will perceive a dew able to
wet you, which arises from the fall of the
Water after the River is fallen. Several
parts of it are conveyed by aqueducts in∣to
the Town for severall uses; as namely


one part for the Brass works, where You
may observe, that the Waeer blowes the
fire, not by moving the Bellowes (which
is common) but by affording the Wind;
an other part of it is carried to the 
Villa
d' Este
 where there is a curious Palace
and most curious Gardens with all sorts
of Ingenious Water Works and other
ornaments, as statues 
&c,
 belonging to
Gardens. Amongst other things there
are several Artificial Birds, that sing their
natural Notes by the help of the Water.
There is an Organ that plays sweetly, mo∣ved
only by the Water, which also fur∣nisheth
it Wind. The 
Girandola
 is con∣siderable,
where the water rises in a gross
Body very High, and the ayr being Ar∣tificially
mixed therewith, makes a noice
that exactly imitats Thunder. 
Tivoli
 is
some eighteen or twentie Miles distant
from 
Rome
 You may easily go from 
Rome

and see all things considerable there, &
returne the same day to 
Rome,
 unless
You please rather to goe to 
Frescati,

which is a most delicious litle Toun about
twelve Miles distant from 
Rome,
 stand∣ing
upon the side of a Hill, from whence


in clear weather You may easily disco∣ver

Rome.
 The Place is beautifi'd with
many delicat 
Villa
's about it, amongst
which the most considerable are, first, the

Belvidere
 belonging now to the 
Principe
Pamphilio,
 the water works whereof are
esteemed the best in 
Italy:
 There is a Cen∣taur
that Winds a Horne by the help of
the Water, with that Loudness, that
it can be heard at six or seven Miles dist∣ance.
There is a low Room which they call
the 
Apollo,
 at the end of which 
Apollo
 sits
upon the Top of an artificial 
Parnassus.

with the nine Muses about him, he with
his Harp, and they with their severall
Instruments of Musick, which play by
the help of the Water, which is convoy∣ed
under ground and is not seen with∣in
the Room. About the middle of the
Room there is a little hole, out of which
the Wind (occasioned by the motion of
the Water underneath) comeing furth,
hath so much strength as to support a
wooden Ball, of the bigness of a Tennes
ball, at half a ell's distance and more
from the floor, without ever letting it fall


to the ground. 
2ly.
 At half a miles di∣stance
from 
Frescati
 are the Ruins of 
Ci∣cero
's

Tusculanum,
 and 
Lucullo
's country
House; as also a curious 
villa
 called 
monte
Dragone,
 where the House is well adorn∣ed
with Paintings, 
&c.
 and the Gardens
with water works.


3ly
 If You desire not to Returne to

Rome
 first, You may goe directly from
hence to 
Castello gondolfo,
 which is about

ive miles distant from 
Frescati,
 and
fourteen from 
Rome.
 It is a most delici∣ous
Countrey House of the Popes, To
which he uses to retire some Moneths in
the Summer, for the good Air's sake, it
hes the Prospect of a most delicat lake,
encompased with Hills, that are all sha∣dowed
with Trees, where amongst other
pleasures you will not want that of
Herbarizing.


Being returned to 
Rome
 you may make
another little Journey with your con∣venience
to 
Ostia,
 which is some twelve
miles distant from 
Rome
 doun the River

Tyber,
 it was of old the great Harbour for
all the Ships and Gallies that belonged


City and Empyre, cutt out as it seems
by Art, but now thro' long neglect fill∣ed
up and useless. Having seen all and
dyned, you may returne before night to

Rome;
 it will be fit you be at the pains
to make another Journey to 
Caprarolla,

one of the noblest Palaces in 
Italy,
 built by
the famous Architect 
Vignoli,
 by order
of Cardinal 
Alexander Farnese.
 It be∣longes
to the Duke of 
Parma.
 It is distant
from 
Rome
 Miles It is in

figure, pentagone,
 having five very High
and equal faces, with a Court perfectly
round in the middle, as likewise are the
Galleries and Corredor's about it. Mor∣over
there is almost as much lodging
below ground as above. The Hangings,
Statues, Pictures, as also the Gardens,
Fountains, and other embellishments,
doe well sute the magnificence of the
Palace.


Having seen 
Rome
 and the Places a∣bout
it. It will be fit to make the Voyage
of 
Naples.
 The Months of 
April
 and 
O∣ctober

are most convenient for this Jour∣ney,
the heat being too great in Summer,


and the Snow and Raine troublesome in
Winter.

As You go out at the Port St. 
Gioua
∣ni,

all along the 
Campania
 on every
side of the High-way, You will meet
with many Ruins of Ancient Burial-Places
for several Miles from the City.


Velitre;
 is an Ancient City of the

Volsci,
 much famed also for the Parents of

Octavius Augustus,
 who were Originaly
of this Place. Upon the Way from

Veletri
 to 
Sezza,
 upon the Hill-side un∣der

Sarninetta,
 there are some Ancient
Ruins supposed to be the 
Tres Taberna
,

of which St. 
Luke
 speaks in the 28.
Chapter of 
the Acts of the Apostles.


Sezza,
 formerly 
Setia;
 was much com∣mended
for its Wine, whence that of

Juvenal.


—Tunc illa time cum pocula sume▪
Gemmata & lato Setinum ardebit in
auro.


Piperno;
 in Latin 
Privernum;
 and the
Inhabitants 
Privernati;
 near to this


Place, 
Iris Florentina,
 grows abundantly.


Terracina;
 was Anciently called 
Aux∣ur,

in the Language of the 
Volsci,
 of
whom this was the 
Metropolis. Strabo

sayeth that it was called 
Trachina, quasi
Aspera
 from the Rockiness of the Hill u∣pon
which it is Placed; altho' the Town
be Ancient, it is not very considerable,
it is the last Place of the Ecclesiastick E∣state
towards 
Naples;
 Passengers use to
Dine here at a pittiful 
Inn
 without the
Town, where there is no manner of
Furniture, but VVood to make Fire: it
not being secure for any Body to live in
it, because of the Turks that often Land
here, and take what they can meet with.
VVhen the People that keep the House
see any Strangers Arrive, instantly they
make Fire and bring Provision from the
Town. The Sea comes very near to the
Foot of the Hill where the Town stands,
and on that side which is towards 
Na∣ples,

the Rock is precipitious, and betwixt
it and the Sea, leaves but a very nar∣row
and strait Passage, which one Man


may Guarde against a Hundred. 
Fondi
 is
the first Town you meet with in the
Kingdom of 
Naples;
 here you must give
notice to the Officers appointed for that
purpose of your intended Journey for

Naples,
 and cause registrat your Name,
together with the marks of your Horse,
that he may be the better known when
you return, to be the same that you
brought along with you from 
Rome,
 or
otherways you will not miss to be chal∣lenged
upon your return, and stopt,
untill you can produce a Certificat that
he is the very same you brought into the
Kingdom with you. There being a Ge∣neral
Prohibition, the observance where∣of
is Strictly lookt to, against carrieing
Horses or Mares out of the Kingdom,
into any foreign part, least the breede
of them, which is esteemed amongst
the best in 
Europe,
 should become com∣mon
to other Nations. Notwithstand∣ing
of this severity, sometimes with cre∣dit,
and sometimes with a little Money,
a Man may obtain permission for the


Transporting of one or more, either
Horses or Mares.


Mola,
 is one of the most pleasant
places in rhe World; being close upon
the Sea side, and but a little way from

Gaieta,
 to which you may go either by
Sea or Land. It is likeways hard by
the ruins of the Ancient City 
Formiae,

where 
Cicero
 had his 
Villa Formiana.

The place abounds with many plants,
and great Varietie of the choisest Fruits;
especially the Agrumi, such as Citrons,
Oranges, Limons &c, of all sorts.


If ye please to go to 
Gaieta,
 it is worth
the while: It stands at the extremity of
of a Promontory or Tongue of Land
that runs out into the Sea, from the
main-Land about three miles, and by
that means becomes peninsule, and for∣meth
on the side towards 
Rome,
 betwixt
it and 
Terracina,
 that 
Sinus Gaitanus,
 a∣bout
twelve miles in length. The Town
is pleasantly Situated and strongly.
There is a great Rock hard by, which
is rent from Top to Bottom, which they
say, happened when the Saviour of the


World Suffered upon the Cross. There is
excellent Herbarizing all the way be∣twixt
it and 
Mola.


Trajetto
 is a Castle near the place
where the Ancient City of 
Minturnae

stood, where there is yet to be seen an
Amphitheatre almost intire, and the re∣mains
of a great Aqueduct: It was a∣mongst
the Marishes near to 
Mintur∣nae,

that 
C. Marius
 did hide himself,
when he fled from his Enemies; whence
that of 
Juvenal,


Exilium & carcer Minturnarum{que} Paludes,


Et Mendicatus victa Carthagine Panis.


You must pass at this place the Ri∣ver

Garigliano,
 called 
Li
is
 Anciently.


Capua,
 is a new City standing upon
the side of the River 
Vulturnus,
 and some
two miles from it, the Ruins of the Old
famous 
Capua
 which in the Old 
Ro∣mans

Time, was esteemed one of the
most delicious Places in the VVorld.
There are yet Vestiges of the Gates
of the City, of a Theatre, of a great
many sumptuous Temples, Cisternes un∣der
gronnd, and a great many other


things; that evidently show it to have
been a magnificent City. The Coun∣try
from 
Vulturnus
 to 
Naples,
 is called
the 
Campania Felice,
 and is indeed the
fertilest soyle and bautifullest Coun∣try
that my Eyes ever beheld.


Aversa
 is a new City, extructed out
of the Ruins of 
Atella,
 It is distant 8
Miles from 
Naples,
 and famed for a
kind of Wine called 
Asprin
.


That way which leades from 
Rome

to 
Naples,
 was Anciently called 
Via
Appia,
 from 
Appius Claudius
 the Censor,
who caused Pave this way from 
Rome,

just to 
Capua.
 It begins at the Port
now called St. 
Sebastian,
 but Anciently

Porta Capena,
 from the 
Capenati
 a peo∣ple
of 
Latium,
 to which that way did
lead. The 
Via Appia
 is of that breadth
that one 
Chariot
 may easily pass another.
The Emperour 
Trajan
 did renew it, and
continue the Pavement even to 
Brin∣dici,

drying the marishes, plaining the
Hills, and filling up the Valleyes. By
this way Anciently did pass the grea∣test
part of the Triumphs; whence it


was called 
Regina viarum:
 whence that
of 
Papinius;


Appia cunctarum fertur Regina viarum.


Altho' this way be Ruined in many
places, yet it is wonderfull to see, in how
great perfection a great deal of it con∣tinues.
Without doubt it has been a
matter of vast Expense to make a way of
that Length, and Breadth so well paved,
with Quadrangular Stones, that even
to this Day (altho' it be of common &
frequent Passage) continueth as intire
as if it were newly done. Upon both
sides of this way, as far as 
Capua,
 there
are a great many Ancient Sepulchres;
many whereof are altogether ruined,
and some almost intire, as yet; in one of
these Sepulchres, in the Reign of 
Alex∣ander

VI. (as 
Volateranus
 tells) the
Body of a Delicat young VVoman, was
found altogether intire in a Marble Chist.
She was of incomparable beautie hav∣ing
her long Flaxen Hair drawn toge∣ther
upon her Head with a Circle of
Gold. The Body did almost swim in a
mervellous kind of Liquor and had a


burning Lamp at the Feet thereof, which
the Air, coming in at the opening of
the Sepulchre, did instantly extin∣guish.
The Body (as did appear by the
Letters graven upon the place) had lyen
there thirteen Hundred Years. Some
have been of Opinion that it was the
Body of 
Tulliola,
 the dearly Beloved
Daughter of 
Cicero.
 It was presented in
its integrity to the Conservators of 
Rome,

and for some Days keept in the Capitol
as a singular curiosity; but 
Pope Alex∣der

coming to understand it, caused it
to be thrown into the 
Tyber.


I must not omit to tell you, that there
is some incommoditie in this Journey
both as to Dyeting and Lodging; and
sometimes there is perill from the Ban∣diti;
But he that will gather Roses, must
not be affraid to prick his Fingers: Be∣sides,
that danger is but sometimes, and
you may probably find the way clear,
especially, if the 
Vice-Roy
 be a stirring
Active Man, as it often happens: For
then the Banditi will hardly dare to


come so far down from the Hills▪ as the

Via appia,
 or High-way to 
Naples.


Naples
 was Anciently called 
Parthe∣nope,

from one of the 
Sirens,
 Buried in
this place, (who as the Fables say)
Drowned her self for Grief, that She
could not Charm 
Vlysses
 and his Com∣panions.
Hence 
Silius lib:

undas,


Exitium miseris caneret non Prospera
nautis.

It was built Closs upon the Sea, at the
foot of most pleasant Hills; First built
by the 
Cumani
 or Inhabitants of 
Cuma;

who being taken with the sweetness of
the Air & Pleasantness of the Place; did
daily increase in number; insomuch that
the 
Cumani
 that lived at 
Cuma,
 took a
Resolution utterly to Ruin 
Parthen
pe




east their own City should become deso∣
at.
But it being Ruined, there came
so great a Pestilence upon 
Cuma,
 as car∣ried
away Multitudes, and having con∣sulted
the Oracle about the cause of this
Mortality; it was answered that this fate
had come upon them for the Ruine of 
Par∣thenope;

and that if they ever hop'd to be
free from this disease, they should first re∣store
it, whence with all diligence they
went about the Restauration thereof, and
called it 
Neapolis,
 that is to say the new
City. The sweetness of the Air, & delicacy
of the Country about is so great, that
many Emperours and 
Roman Senators

being wearied with the Wars, and
weightiness of Government, did repair
to this place, that they might live plea∣santly
& Peaceably, & give themselves to
the Study of Letters; amongst which were

Virgil, T. Livius, Horatius, Claudianus 

& a great many more: At this very pre∣sent
it is no less frequented by the Nobi∣lity
and Gentrie of the whole Kingdom,
who for the most part have their own
Palaces and pass the greatest part of the


Year here; so that for Nobility and
Gentry there are few Cities in the World
more considerable than this. I think it
is for this Reason, that it is commonly
called 
Napoli la Gentile:
 Nor is it to
be passed by, that it gives name to a
Kingdom; which is not very Ordinary.


The City is big and sumptuously built
from the Sea to these pleasant Hills a∣bout
it. It is very well fortified with
strong Walls & Castles, especially since
the dayes of 
Charles
 V. who built the
Castle of St. 
Elme
 and called it 
la Bri∣lia,

that is, Bridle; intending to make
it so, to the mutinous Humour of that
people, and it may be alluding to the

Armes
 of the City, which is an unbrid∣led
Horse; the exact emblem of the di∣sposition
of that people, as witness the
innumerable Tumults and revolts both of
old and late Years made by them. I
confess there is no small occasion given
them by the severe domination of Stran∣gers
over them; and it is strange
that having so many brave and va∣lourous
Men amongst them, they


should more readily agree to submit
their necks to the Yoak of a Stranger,
than to the sweet Scepter of a Native of
their own number and Nation. It is
thought the great emulation, (which the

Spaniards
 as wisely, as industriously keep
up to the hight) amongst the Princes,
who are but too numerous for the ex∣tent
of the Kingdom, is the great cause
of their unhappiness.


You may take notice of these particu∣lars
within the Town. 
1ly.
 The Church∣es;
of which this City hath a greater num∣ber,
than any other of its bigness in

Europe.
 Amongst the rest, that of the

Annunciata,
 is so Rich; that the Rent
of the Hospitall thereof is capable to
entertain, 5000 Poor, part whereof are
Children found. St. 
Chiana,
 together with
the Monastrie of Nuns consisting of 400
with as many servants, is very glori∣ous;
It was Built by 
Agnes
 of 
Spain

Queen to King 
Robert.
 There are many
curious Sepulchres to be seen here of
Kings, Queens, and their Children. In
the Church of St. 
Dominico
 is to be seen


the Image of the Crucifix, that said to
St. 
Thomas Aquinas; bene scripsisti do
me▪ Thoma.
 In the Church of the 
Frat

di monte Oliueto,
 the true Pictures of

Ferdinand,
 the first and the second; and

Alfonsus
 the First; both Kings of

Naples,
 are so Admirably well done that
they seem to be living. There
is likewise Buried here 
Alexander
ab Alexandro,
 who composed that learned
work 
Genialium dierum.
 The Church
called the 
Domo,
 hath a Chapell compo∣sed
of Marble, Jasper, Gold and Brass;
wherein is keept the Head of St. 
Genna∣ro,

and a little Phiole of his Blood all to∣gether
fixed, which being approached to
the Head of the St. 
immediatly
begins to boyll, dissolves and becomes
clear. The most ancient of all the
Churches is that of St. 
Paul,
 keept now
by the Jesuits; It was formerly the Tem∣ple
of 
Castor
 and 
Pollux.


2. The Religious Houses or Convents;
of which there are so great a number,
that the 
Dominicans
 alone have seventeen.
The Chartrous convent stands upon the


Hill, a little beneath the Castle St. Elm
'
It hath the pleasantest Situation that I
ever beheld; one may discover from it
the whole City and Suburbs of 
Naples,

a great part of the 
Campania Felice,
 the

monte Vesuvio,
 all the Bay of 
Naples,
 the
Island of 
Capreae,
 the Hill 
Posilipo, Pu∣teoli,
Baii, Cuma, &c.
 The Cloister of
the convent is all of white Marble, and in
short, both the Church and whole Con∣vent
are altogether Magnificent.


3ly.
 The Hospitals; which are about
twelve in number; amongst which, that
of the 
Annunciata
 and of the 
Incueabili

are the most considerable. It is said that
they Marry 665. Maids every Year, and
the least portion they give with any is 24
Ducats, and the greatest 300.


4ly.
 The Castles; of which there are 4.
The Castle 
d'Ovo
 stands within the Sea
upon a Rock, built of an Oval Figure by

Willam
 III. a 
Norman.
 The Castle 
Nov

was built by 
Charles
 the first, Brother to
St. 
Lewes,
 but it was 
Ferdinand
 of 
Ara∣gon

that fortified it so well. It is of a
quadrangular figure, Built of polished


Stone as hard as Marble; it hath foure
great Bastions, and five Towres, toge∣ther
with strong ramparts, and deep
Ditches, which the Sea water filleth: It
is ordinarly keept by a Garison of the

Spaniards
 Consisting of 500. There is a
great Magazin of all kinds of Armes &
Engines for War keept within it. In the
middle of it stands the Governours Palace,
capable to Lodge a King. It is excellent∣ly
furnished with Hangings of silk and
gold, many excellent Statues and Pi∣ctures.
Amongst other fine things there is
a Cabinet furnished with all sorts of
curiosities. The Castle of St. 
Elm
 stands
upon the top of a Rock, commanding
all about it; It's Garison consists of 250.

Spainards.
 It was built by King 
Robert

the first, Son to 
Charles
 II. but after∣wards
farr better fortified with great
Bastions by the Emperour 
Charles
 V. who
called it 
La Brillia di Napoli.


The Castle 
Capuano
 (so called from it's
situation which is near to the Port of

Capuano
) is rather a Palace than a Fortress
where the Magistrats of the City,


and Officers of justice keep their Assem∣blies.


5. The Palaces; whereof there are a very
great number, amongst which that of
the Viceroy; That of the Prince of 
Salern▪

which the Jesuits now possess, are very
considerable. The Palace of the Duke of

Gravina
 is most 
superb.
 That of the 
Cara∣fi

is adorned with abundance of excel∣lent
statues of Marble and Brass. There
be many other worthie to be seen: as also
the beautifull Garden of 
Don Garcia di
Toledo,
 which is full of Grotto's, Foun∣tains,
Water works, statues 
&c.


6. The Harbour, or Sea Port; which
is fortified with a Superb mole, first made
by 
Charles
 II. And then very much
mended by 
Alfonsus
 the first, for the great∣er
security of the Harbour.


7. The Publick Places, the streets, &
the avenues of the Town.


8. The Suburbs; which are seven in
number; amongst which the most consi∣derable,
is that which leads 
A la grotio
di Posilipo;
 near to the entry of which

Grotto
 stands 
la mergelina,
 looking in∣to


the Bay; it was sometimes the House
of pleasure of 
Sanazarius
 that famous
Poet, who gave it to the Religious men
called 
Servi.
 This Suburb is no less than
two miles in length from the City to the

Grotto
 of 
Po
lipo.
 The Circuit of the
Town and Suburbs is counted to be a∣bout
six miles: and the Inhabitants to
be about 30
000. Soules. 
Statius Papi∣nius

and 
Jacobus Sanazarius;
 both excel∣lent
Poets; together with many other
great Virtuosi were borne in this
City.


It will be worth the while also to take a
view of the Book-sellers Shops, there being
many good Books Printed here which
hardly or not all can be found with us;
as for example, the works of 
Baptista
Porta,
 whereof the Impressions at 
Naples

were both the first and fairest, and the
Cutts for the most part Tailledouce.
The works of 
Fabius Columna,
 which
are almost out of Print, and especially
his 
Phytobasanos.
 It may likewise happen
that there are some new peeces emitted
which will never come to our hands


for at least, not tell after a great while. It
is likely too that You may meet with
many other Books, that in other places
You had sought in vain for: there are
many learned and Curious men in this
City, and they are as mortall here as
elsewhere, and as ordinary a thing it is
to sell their Books.


You will likewise meet with a great
many curiosities of all sorts, espccially
from the 
Levant:
 some naturall; as
stones, shells, Animalls, or parts of
them, fruits 
&c.
 Others artificiall; some
of Leather, as Purses, Letter-cases, cups,
and a great many things of that kind,
usualy brought from 
Allepo
 and 
Con∣stantinople:

Some of Silk either alone,
or mingled with gold and silver; as Sashes,
Girdles, Cravats, Night-Caps, wast∣coats,
stockings, 
&c.
 Outlandish Armes,
as Cimetres, Poyniards, Bows and Ar∣rows,
with severall sorts of fire Armes.
Medalls antient and modern: Intalio'
s

Chameo'
s &c.
 But in these You must
take some heed, that You mistake not
the modern for antique.



Having well viewed and considered
the City and all things in it. It will be
necessary to see those things that are con∣siderable
about it. And first the Hill 
Po∣silipus,

famous for it's Gardens and Houses
of Pleasure, for it's Fruits and Wines,
especially the 
greco di Posilipo.
 But that
which is most Admirable in this Hill is
the Passage cut quite thro' it. By 
Cocceius

of whom 
Pontanus
 saith, 
Nescio an is fu∣erit
M. Cocceius Nerua Augusti Avus, qui
Romae aquarum curam habuit tulit{que} m
x∣imam
Architecturae Laudem.
 Howeve

it is certain he must have been a man of
great Riches that durst undertake so
great a work, at his oun expence. It is
called 
la Grotta di Posilipo,
 and is very
near a mile in length, cutt thro' the Rock.
As for the breadth of it, one Coach may
pass another with ease. And for the
Hight, I believe a man on Horseback will
hardly touch the Roof of it with a Lance;
At the two ends it is some what higher
than in the middle, I think of purpose
that the light might enter the farther.
When You enter at the one end You


will very hardly perceive the light in the
other end, but as You advance it begins
to appear by little and little. In the Just
middle of it, on that side which is next the
Sea, there is a little Chapell, where a
Lamp is keept continually burning, but
it is more out of Devotion than for any
light it gives: betwixt the Chapell and the
end, as it were about the middle on every
side of the Chapell there is a hole cutt
thro' the Hill which serveth for a win∣dow,
but it gives little light. It is exceed∣ing
dusty, especeially if there be many
Horses Ryding together altho' it be paven
with stone, because there comes no Rain
to wash it, and none takes pains to make
it clean. Those that goe from 
Naples
 to

Pozzuolo
 if they hear any Horses Coaches
or Carts coming toward them, least they
should stop the way, or unawares Justle
one another, they use to cry aloud 
dal
mare,
 which when the others hear, they
cry in like manner 
dal monte
 and so
those that goe from 
Naples
 take that side
of the 
Grotto,
 which is next the Sea
and these that go to it take the side


next the Hill; and so avoid all incum∣brance.
At the mouth of the 
Grotto,
 upon
the top thereof is the famous Sepulchre of

Virgil.
 There is little remaning of it now
except a few Ruins of an old Brick wall
in the middle whereof anciently there
did stand nine small Pillars, which su∣stained
a Marble U
, in which were con∣tained
the Poets ashes, with this Distich.

Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, te∣net
nunc


Parthonope; cecini pascua, rura, duces.


Not far from this Tomb, is the Sepul∣chre
of that famous Poet 
Sanazarius,
 in
a Place called 
Mergelina,
 a 
Villa
 given
him by King 
Frederick,
 where he built a
Church in Honour of the BIessed Virgin,
and composed that incomparable 
Poem
de partu Virginis.
 He is Buried within
the Church in a Tomb of pure Marble
upon which his statue done to the life
standeth with this Epitaph by Cardinal

embo.


Da Sacro cineri flores, hic ille Maroni
Sineerus, musa proximus, ut tumulo.



There are many other excellent Statues,
Base Relieves, and Pictures within this
Church well worthie the seeing.


When you go to 
Pozzuolo,
 you must
take a Guide with you to show
you all the considerable Places. It
will be a good dayes Journey because
You have many Things to see
and consider, and therefore you must
part early in the Morning from 
Naples.

The first thing you will meet with upon
the Way, (but you turne out of the
common way) is the 
Lago di Agnano
 at
the side of which are the Natural stoves
of St. 
German,
 which are certain little
roomes, where the hot and Sulphureous
Vapors entering from the Ground quick∣ly
provoke sweating, and is commend∣ed
in severall diseases.


At a little distance from thence, up∣on
the side of the Lake is the 
Grotto de
I Cani.
 It is a little hole dug out of
the side of a Brae where two or three
Persons scarcely can stand. The Floore
of it is ordinarily wet and dirtie, out of
which there riseth a Poisonous Vapour,


in form of Smoak, but it ascendeth not
above a Foot from the Ground. They
use to trie it with Torches and Dogs,
which you must carrie from 
Naples
 with
you, for you will not find them upon
the Place. As for the Torches, the guide
lights two, and then reaches one of
them to the Smoak, which instantly ex∣tinguishes,
as if it were blown out by
the force of Powder: Then he lights
it at the other, and so renews the experi∣ment
as oft as you please, keeping al∣ways
one lighted, untill your Curiosi∣tie
be satisfied; as for the Dogs he
holds their Nose into the Vapour, and
instantly they begin to fetch their Breath
thick, and in a very little space are quite
suffocated. If ye let them ly long, they
will never recover, but if ye take them
immediately when they are fallen down
and throw them into the Lake, they will
by little and little returne to live again.
I guesse this Vapour to be so much like
the Damps, that are sometimes found
in our Coal-pitts, only, with us, they
are soon dissipated, but here this lasteth


continuallie, and (which is yet more
strange) in an open Air; but it may
be the openness of the Air is the Reason
why the Vapour ascendeth no higher.
I remember one of our Dogs did recover
without being thrown into the Lake,
which makes me believe, that it is not
any peculiar Vertue in the water (as is
commonly said) that restoreth them to
life, but only the freedom of the Air,
with the help whereof Nature reinforceth
it self, the life being yet not quite ex∣tinct,
which is cleared by this, that if
they lye any considerable time in the
cave, neither Air nor water will recover
them. It is very True that, That which
was thrown in the Lake recovered much
sooner, and better: whereas the other
remained paralytick, and impotent to
move his hinder quarters: (tho' he could
Sit upon his foremost Leggs and bark▪)
for almost two houres thereafter. It
seems there is something in this Vapour
or Damp that coagulats or fixes the Spi∣rits,
that they cannot move or circu∣lat
in the Body.



From hence you take the Way to

Pazzuolo,
 near to which you will meet
with a Place called 
la Solfatara,
 it is a large
plaine, Oval in Figure, representing a The∣atre,
it is above 1200 Foot in length and
1000 in breadth, it is compassed about with
white & high Hills, from which in many
Places, arise Clouds of smoak, of a Sulphu∣reous
smell, rolling up into the Air impetu∣ously,
with great crackling. Some of these
spiracles are very small, so that it is a Plea∣sure,
to see the Smoake ascend, by a direct
line of the bigness of cane, and sometimes
smaller by much. About these spiracles
you will see Quantitie of the Flowres of
Brimstone sublimed; but I suspect the
internal use of them, because of the mix∣ture
of other minerals wherewith they
may be infected: But for external uses, I
am not so doubtfull, as also of the Spirit
which by the help of convenient Glasses
might be gathered in aboundance from
these spiracles. When you consider the
plaine you will wonder to hear it sound
under your Horse-feet, as you were Ri∣ding
over a large Floore, which is caused


by the Vacuitie underneath. All the
Hills about abound in veines of Allum
whereof some is scissile; nitre, Sulphur, Vi∣triol
& Salt Armoniac. The Vitriol is of a
Delicat blew Colour and much finer
than that which is commonly called 
Ro∣man-Vitriol.

It will be worth your while
to take particular notice of these mi∣nerals,
how they are extracted out of
their mines, what differences there are of
every Species, how they are mixed with
one another sometimes, by what Art they
are purified, and with what Instruments,
and to what use they are put. I would
have you take a Parcel of every sort and
bring along with you, which you may
box up at 
Naples
 with Cotton, and send
before you to 
Rome.


Having done these things, you come
to 
Pozzuolo;
 in Latine 
Puteoli.
 The City
is now much Ruined; but was Stately
and Rich of Old. 
Cicero
 writing to 
At∣ticus

saith 
quid potui non videre cum per
Emporeum puteolanum iter facerem;
 which
is Chieflly to be understood of that part
of the Town, which stood upon the


Shoare where the Arti
ans, and chiefly
the Goldsmiths, had their Shops, where∣of
there remaines little now except the
Ruins, and Vestiges: And yet beneath
the Church 
di Giesu Maria,
 possessed by
the Dominicans, when the Wind dryves
out the Sea, they do find sometimes
severall Precious Stones, some cutt, some
uncutt; and if you be Curious to en∣quire
you will find People that make a
Trade to sell such things amongst other
Anticails. I remember there came seve∣rall
of these Persons to our Lodging-House,
with Medals, 
Intaglio's, Lucerne
Antiche
 &c. But I found many of them
to be cheats, and but moderne, brought
thither from 
Naples
 and other Places, of
purpose to cheat Strangers, who are or∣dinarly
more Curious than knowing of
these things; As for Medals, were they
never so Ancient, they are little worth
unless they be well preserved, and the
Characters and impressions easie to be
discerned. And for Intaglio's unless the
Figure be good▪ and well done, and the
Stone entire and unbroken, they are not


worth much. The great Church now
dedicated to St. 
Proclus
 was anciently
dedicated to 
Octavianus Augustus.
 It is
a Sumptuous Fabrick of great square
Marble Stones; serving for the whole
thickness of the Wall, with great and
high 
Corinthian
 Pillar's, and other Ex∣cellent
Ornaments of Architecture.


Here are also be seen many Ruins of great
antiquitie, amongst which she Gardens
of 
Cicero
 famous for his Academy,
where he wrote his 
Quaestiones Academi∣cae.

But this City, in diverse ages has
suffered so much by the tumults of Wars,
as also by the eruptions of fire and earth∣quakes,
that it is wonderfull there should
yet remain any vestiges of Antiquitie.
The Soil about it is most fertile and
fruitfull, and nature produceth here
many Plants of it's oun accord, which
in other places are kept in Gardens, not
without care: among others I remember
to have seen the 
Ricinus
 or 
Palma Christi

not only growing wild but out-living
that Winter, and continuing fresh green
and strong in the month of 
March;
 al∣tho'


it be an 
Annual
 Plant with us, that
can hardly be raised upon a hot bed.


You may have your Horse at 
Pozzuolo,

and hyre a boat to cross the Bay for see∣ing
of the following things, And 1. hard
by the City the remains of that 
Superb
mole,
 which having been ruined by storme
was afterwards Restored by the Emperour

Antoninus:
 But at present all that Remains
is 12. or 13. great Pillars built of Brick
and stones of vast bigness. They appear so
many towrs, over which there are yet
remaining, but half Ruined, some Arches.
This fashion of Moles seem to be the
best, because the Pillars and Arches are
sufficient to break the water and secure
the Ships within, and by letting part of
the water enter betwixt the Pillars les∣sens
it's violence, so that the Pillars suffer
not half so much, as if they were one
continued wall. The Emperour 
Caligulae

built a bridge of boats from 
Pozzuolo to
Baii
 upon which he went in Triumph
first on Horsback and then in Chariot,
but it was of small continuance and ser∣ved
only to be the subject of discourse in


future ages. Having passed these Pillars.
Yov put ashore hard by the 
Lacus Lu∣crinus

which as some said was so called

a Lucro
 from the profit which it yeild∣ed
to the 
Romans
 by the great abundance
of excellent Fish especialie 
Oysters,
 which
were esteemed before any other in 
Italy:

Whence 
Martial
 to express the Glutto∣ny
of a certain Person.


Ostrea tu sumis stagno saturata Lucrino.


But there is little water in it now, it
being almost dryed up by that most Ter∣rible
eruption of the 
Solfatara
 which
happned in the Year 1538. the 29. of

September
 two hours after Sun set, the
whole countrey about having been
troubled for two Years before with
Earthquakes: At which time there burst
out in one night so great a quantitie
of fire, Stones, Pumecks, and ashes, that
near to the 
monte Barbaro
 formerly called

mons Gaurus
 it made another Hill, near
three miles in compass, and almost as
high as the 
monte Barbaro.
 The south part
of it looks to the Sea, the north reaches
to the 
Lacus Avernus,
 & on the East it is


joined with the foot of 
Monte Barbaro.
 It
is called 
monte Nuovo.
 These ashes did not
only make this Hill, but covered like∣wise
a great part of the Country about,
Killing both beasts and Trees, and ruin∣ing
the Vintage for that Year. The Sea
in the mean time retired above 200 paces,
leaving abundance of Fish upon the dry
sands, and many Wells of fresh Water,
which sprung here and there.


2. The 
Lacus Avernus
 is about half a
miles distance from the 
Lago lucrino.
 It
is compassd about with small Hills which
they say were formerly covered with
Trees, that did over shaddow the wa∣ter,
and make it look black, and like∣wise
did hinder the Sulphureous Vap∣ours
that did arise from the water to
dissipat, so that the Air being infected
with these vapours became so noysome
especially to Fowls, that they could not
live in it, and hence came the Name

Avernus.
 At present there is little
or no Wood about it, nor is the Air
any thing more noysome there, than in
other places about, and I have seen Fowles


haunting about it and swimming in it.
It is said to be very deep & for that reason
without Fish but I am not certain hereof.


3. Upon the west side of the Lake,
cutt into the Hill is the 
Antrum Sybillae

commonly called 
Grotta della Sybilla,
 but
not truly, for the true Cave of 
Sybill

is at 
C
a.
 This seems rather to have
been a common passage from 
Avernus

to 
P
ia,
 but is now stopt at the one
end by the falling down of the Hill a∣bove.
The passage is large and High, but
altogether dark, and therefore You must
be guided by Torch light. When You
are got a good way in, upon the one
side there is a little narrow passage of
about three or fourscore foot in length,
that leads into a handsome large Cham∣ber,
which altho' it be now much ruin∣ed,
appears to have been Richly adorned,
the Roof of it being Painted with Gold
and Blew, and the Walls with curious
figures of divers colours and the Pave∣ment
consisting of many small peeces
like unto 
Mosaick.
 It is a vulgar errour
that this was 
Sybilla
's Chamber, and


that the Temple of 
Apollo,
 where she re∣ceived
her Responses, was hard by upon
the Right Hand as you enter to the Lake;
But it is not so, for the Ruins of that
Place appeare not to have been any Tem∣ple
at all, But rather a Superb Bathing
House, such as that of 
Baia,
 for it has
the same order of Windows, & Spiracles
for conducting of the Vapours. But to
returne to the 
Grotto,
 upon the left hand,
as You enter into this Chamber, there is
another Passage, some what higher and
larger than the first, about 40. foot in
length cut out into the Hill, which leads
into another Chamber, from which there
is a narrow passage, which leads into
another Chamber, and severall other
little passages and Roomes which 
I
 doe
not distinctly remember, only this much
that in one of them, there is as it were a
little Pool of Warm Water. In this
Room the heat is so great, that it is im∣possible
to continue any time in it with∣out
excessive Sweating, which makes me
to believe, that these Rooms were inten∣ded
for no other use than Bathing and
Sweating.



4. The Remains or Ruins; and first

Bagno di Cicerone. 2ly. Bagno di Tritoli;
quasi Frittoli, q
od Corpora ibi fricrentur,

The Entrie to it is large and high. Tow∣ards
the ground it is cold, but if you stand
upright You must needs Sweat for Heat,
and the farther one goes in, the greater
the Heat is. At the bottom of the Rock
within Sea-mark, and even where the
Sea covers it, the Sand is so Hot that
one cannot lift a handfull of it.


5. 
Baia;
 So called from 
Baius,
 the
Companion of 
Vlysses,
 who was Buried
there. It was a most delicat City, but
now altogither Ruined, and in the place
of it there is a Castle lately Built with a
a Garison of 30. Souldiers for Securing
the Port, which is verie safe for Gallies,
but not deep enough for Ships. The
whole Bay, or 
Sinus
 of 
Baia,
 is exceed∣ingly
Pleasant; all that Tract betwixt

Avernus
 and the 
Mons Misenus
 being
full of the Remains of great and Noble
structures. Many of the 
Roman
 Emper∣ours
took great pleasure in this place, &
and spared no cost for the beautifying of


it. 
Horace,
 who was no ill Judge, gives
this Testimony of it,

Nullus in Orbe locus Baiis praelucet
amoenis.


As You go forward from 
Baia,
 You will
still be finding something worthie the
Remarking; as, 1. The House of 
Agrippi∣na,
Nero
's Mother, who was put to Death
here by her Sons Command. It is com∣monly
said to be her Sepulchre, but it is
not true. There is yet to be seen the
Plaister of the Roof and walls in severall
Curious figures, but they are much de∣faced
by the smoak of the Torches which
strangers from all parts so frequently
carry down with them. 2. That delicat
Pleasant Field called the 
Eligium,
 so
much renowned by 
Virgil
 in the 
6th.

Book of the 
Aeneids.
 All the Noble Per∣sons
that lived here abouts, or did other∣wise
attend upon the Court, which did
often happen to be here, likewise those
that for their Health's sake came to the
Bath's, used to walk in this place for their


Recreation and Converse. I am easily
inclined to believe that considering it's
Situation, Prospect, and the Order that
it was keept in, when so many great
Persons frequented it, It could not chuse
but have been the most delicious Place
in the whole World, and no wonder
that it Prompted 
Virgil
 to Borrow both
it's name and his Conceit in expressing
and describing the Place of the Blessed
Soules Departed. I saw it in the begin∣ing
of the Moneth of 
March,
 and then
the Heat was considerable, and the
Place not only green but covered with

Anemonies
 and other Flowers. Hard by
this, is the 
Piscina Miraebilis:
 it is a Ci∣stern
for keeping of fresh Water, of a
vast Bigness, the Roof whereof is support∣ed
by 48. great Pillars on everie side.
The whole inside of it is Crusted over
with a kind of Plaster as hard as Mar∣ble,
which whither it was so made by
Art, or by the Continuance of the
Water in it, I know not, but I think it
probable that both have contributed to
it. 
Boccace
 in his Book of Rivers, believs


it to have been built by 
Agrippa,
 for
preserving of fresh Water, for the Com∣modity
of the Navie which used to stay
at 
Misenum.
 The Water was brought to
it by aquedu
ts from 
Serino.
 3. 
Mons
Misenus
 or the 
Promontorium Misenum,

so called from 
Misenus, Aeneas
's Trum∣peter,
who was Buried here. It is of a
Reasonable Hight, and without doubt
the prospect from it is Noble; but I
did not ascend it, by reason of the Com∣pany
that would not stay for me.


4. The 
Centum Cellae;
 which are a con∣tinued
Fabrick built of Brick with great
Art under ground, it seems they have
been Cisterns for Conserving of Water.
In short, all this peece of ground is full
of ancient Ruins, and it is not easie to
Guesse, what every one of them in Par∣ticular
hath been.


Having vieued all these things, you ei∣ther
go straight to 
Cuma,
 or else you
leave it for another Day, and so re∣turne
to 
Pozzulo,
 by the same Boat that
waited upon you from it, and so returne
by Horse, by the lower but plainer and


more pleasant Way, to 
Naples,
 from
from whence the next Day you may go
to 
Cuma,
 in Latine 
Cumae;
 a City built
upon the Top of a Hill six Miles from

Naples;
 upon the highest Top of this
Hill stood the Temple of 
Apollo
 built by

Dedalus,
 when he fled from the wrath of
King 
Minos.
 It was in this Temple that

Sybilla Cumea
 did pronounce the Ora∣cles
of 
Apollo.
 Hence that of 
Virgil,


At pius Aeneas arces quibus altus Apollo


Praesidet, horrendae{que} procul secreta
Sybillae.


As you descend from 
Cuma
 upon that
side that looks to the East, is to be seen
the Frontis-peece of the true 
Grotta
 of

Sybilla,
 which was cut out of the solid
Rock, which 
Virgil
 describeth,

Excisum Euboicae latus ingens rupis in
antrum.


There are many other Ancient Ru∣ins
worthie the taking notice of,
which you may have leasure enough
to observe, and have time enough to
returne to 
Naples
 at Night.



The next Day you may take Horse
again and a Guide with you from the
Town, to see the burning Hill, about 8
Miles distant from the Town; It is cal∣led
in Latine 
Vesuvius,
 and in Italian

Monte di soma,
 from the great Plentie
of all things wherewith it aboundeth.
the Hill it self is of a very Large Com∣pass,
and about the middle divided in
two Tops, of which one is much abated
of its length by the burning. Before
the first eruption of the Fire, it was
much higher than the other, but now it
is by much the lower. It is not easily
accessible both in regard of its steepness,
and the great Quantitie of Ashes that co∣ver
it every where, by Reason whereof,
the ascent becomes slippery and uncer∣tain.
In the ascending, you may take
nottice of many several Channels, some
larger and deeper, some narrower
and shallower made by the Tor∣rents
of burning Sulphur and other
Mineral Substances, which Boyled
out at the Top in the last great eruption
it made, which torrents were carried se∣veral


Miles into the Gulf or bay of 
Na∣ples

without being quenched, and killed
the Fishes in the middle of the deep. You
may likeways take notice of the various
Mineral Substances, & Stones burn'd to

Pumick,
 which are scattered over the
whole Hill. When you come at the Top
you will see the great Gulf made by the se∣veral
eruptions, which is suposed to be six
Miles in compasse about the Brimmes, so
that it makes a very large plain Field at
the Bottom, that in deepness from the
brimm is not above a hundred Yards,
it is all covered with Ashes, and no∣thing
green in it, except it be some few
Tufts, of I cannot tell what, not being
able to Judge of them at that distance.
The descent to the Bottom at some pla∣ces
seems to be easie enough, but we
could find none so hardie as to venture
to show us the way, altho' some of our
Guides had undertaken it before, and to
speak truth, it is no great discretion to
venture so far down upon a Ground,
which probably is not able to support
one, being nothing in appearance but a


Field of Ashes of uncertain deepthness. You
will see in a Hundred diverse Places,
Spiracles, some greater, some smaller,
out of which the Smoak rises impetu∣ously,
as it were shott out of a Gun, and
with a continual Crackling, like that of
Thunder at a distance, or the quenching
of Fire. When you have satisfied your
Curiositie of seeing all, you must return
the same Day, and take your Horse where
you left him, about the middle of the Hill;
and so returne to 
Naples.
 It is usuall
for Strangers to light at a Village a∣bout
midway to the City, to Taste of
these excellent Wines, that grow upon
the fertile places of the Hill, and parti∣cularly
of 
Lachryma Christi,
 otherways
called 
Lagrima di Soma,
 which is a gross
bodied Red Wine, strong and sweet to
the taste, and very pleasant.


In the suburbs of the Town, as you re∣turn,
you may see the Kings Stables,
where the choisest Horses of the Kingdom
are menaged and keept for the Kings use.


Thus having vieued all in & about 
Na∣ples,

it will be time to order your re∣turn


for 
Rome,
 by the same way you
came, nor do I remember any other
thing needfull to be observed or advised,
except that you must l
t
 your Baggage 
e
vieued at the Gate▪ as you go out, and
take a Pass from the Customers; or which
you will pay some small thing. You will
likeways do well to rid your self of all
Spanish Monie (gold excepted) unless it be
somuch as will serve to bear your expen∣ses
to 
Fu
die,
 because it will not pass in
any place of 
Italy,
 except such as are un∣der
the 
Spanish Dominion.


If the Season of the Year be good,
there is excellent Her
rising upon this

oade to 
Naples.
 You will find Wild
in the Fields, many sorts of 
Narcissus
's,
many Colours of single 
Anemone
's,

Squills: As
h
delus albus ma
or; Tithyma∣lus
Dendroides.
 It is a Plant I never
saw, except upon the way from 
Piper∣n


 
T
rrachina,
 about mid way u∣pon
a Hill side, where it groweth in great
aboundance. It is a stately tall Plant,

 reading it self into severall Branches,
some whereof I observed to be as big as a


Mans Wrist. It had few or no leaves
on it in the Season when I saw it, which
was 
March,
 but aboundance of Yellow
Flowers at the Top's of the Branches:
The 
Ficus indica lati-folia,
 is a Beast∣ly
weed in the same Place, and spoiles all
the Ground; every leafe that falls spring∣ing
up into a new Plant, which at last
becometh hard and woodie. 
Tuchr
um
lusit anicum arborescens,
 of which I saw
some goodly tufts near to 
Terachina.

There be many other, which for brevi∣ties
sake I omit to mention, and like∣ways
a great many that I have forgot,
having lost those notes I made of their
names and places; but I hope you will
supply this defect, being your self much
more able to do it.


Being returned to 
Rome,
 which I shall
suppose to be about the middle or end
of 
April:
 It will be fitt for you to think
of the next Voyage towards 
Loretto,
 un∣less
you resolve to pass the Summer at

Rome,
 for after the 
20th.
 of 
May,
 un∣till
the latter 
Rains
 fall (which is com∣monly
about the middle of 
September,
 or


the beginning of 
October,
 the extream
heat makes Travel very unseasonable.
But if in the case of necessity, such as
Pestilence, or War, you should be forced
to undertake the Journey, you must order
it so as to Travel most in the Night, and
Rest in the heat of the Day, and be sure
not to Sleep till you have passed the

Campania
 of 
Rome,
 as I have formerly
marked.

I have not much to say of the parti∣cular
places upon this Road, only 
Tern

is an Ancient City and pleasantly situat∣ed;
the River 
Negra,
 in Latine 
Nar
 being
divided in many Branches, and drawn
through the Town, are as it were so many
little Rivers, whence also the Town in La∣tine
is called 
Interamna:
 the Meadowes &
Fields about it, are exceedingly fertile, in so
much that the meadowes are mowen three
or four times a Year; and they talk
that Turneps are often found there of
five or six & thirtie weight, of which
seaven or eight will load an Ass; it is
also renowned for Pidgeons, which are
thought the biggest & most savoury in

Italy.
 If you can take the leisure to stay
here any time, it will be worth your


while to see the 
Lago di piedi luco,
 in
Latine 
Lacus velinus
 (not far from 
Terni
)
which is said to be the middle of all 
I∣taly,

that which is most considerable in
it, is the 
Issue
 of the Waters from it,
which was cut by a 
Roman Consul

through a Rock, whence it Rushes out,
and falls over so great a hight of Rocks,
that it makes a noise which may be heard
at ten Miles distance, and makes a grea∣ter

cascata
 then that of 
Tivoli.
 From

Verchian
 you have the 
Appennine
 to pass,
which is that ridg of Hills that divides
all 
Italy
 by the length.


From 
Valcimara,
 the way is exceeding
good to 
Loretto.


Loretto
 it self is a little Town not very
Ancient, built upon the Top of a Hill,
not above 3 or 4 Miles from the 
Adri∣atick

Sea, it is fortified reasonably well:
the most considerable thing in it, is the
Church, in the Quire whereof stands the

Casa S
ncta,
 brought thither from 
Judeae

Miraculously by 
Angels,
 as is beleeved.
This is the House in which the blessed
Virgin is said to have been Born. The


out-side of it is walled about with Mar∣ble
cut into excellent Figures, but yet
so as the Walls touch not the Holy
House. The inside hath continually
Lamps burning in it, some of Gold, some
of Silver. There is in it a Picture of our
Saviour and the Virgin, which they say
were painted by St. 
Luke.
 The Image
of the Virgin, which stands upon the
Altar, hath a Garment upon it all co∣vered
with Pearles, & upon the Head a
Crown of Gold, enriched with Jewells;
upon the Top whereof there is a Carbun∣cle
of the bigness of an Egg. There is like∣ways
shown within the House a little
Dish, out of which our Saviour is said to
have Eat his Meat whilst he was yet a Babe.
People commonly bring their Beads, Me∣dals,
& other peeces of Devotion to be put
in this Dish, & to touch the other relicts.
The 
Sacristia
 is well worthy the seeing be∣cause
of the Jewels, and other Rich pre∣sents
and Ornaments belonging to the
House, which are keept there, and have
been given and offered continualy, by
allmost all Princes and great Persons in


Christendom. The Cellar is likeways
worthie the seeing, being exceedingly
Large and full of Wines. Amongst o∣thers
they ordinarly shew one great Tun
out of which they draw 3 or 4 sorts of
Wine, some red, some white. The num∣ber
of Pilgrims, and other Persons, that
out of Devotion resort to this Place, from
all the parts of Christendom, is allmost
infinit, insomuch that every Day ap∣pears
to be a holy Day and the whole
Year but one continued Feast. So soon
as the Gates are opened in the morning,
they begin to enter as it were in Pro∣cession.
I believe there are but few In∣habitants
in the Town, except a few
Trades-men of all sorts, for the Ac∣commodation
of Strangers, the greatest
part are Merchants, that sell nothing but
Beads and peeces of Devotion, such as
Medals of Silver, Gold, Brass, Christal
&c. Books of Devotion, and such like.
There is good Accommodation in the
Town, at a reasonable Rate. The City
is Commanded by a Governour, who
hath his Palace near to the Church.


We were Recommended to him by Car∣dinal

Charles Barbarini,
 and were treat∣ed
by him with great Civilitie; his Se∣cretary
being commanded to wait upon
us, and show us all that was considerable
in the place.


After two days stay here we dismissed
our Horses that we brought from 
Rome,

and Hyred new ones from 
Loretto
 to

Bolognia.




From Loretto to Bolognia.

Ancona
 is about half a days Journey
from 
Loretto.
 It is a verie ancient City
and the best Sea Port in 
Italy,
 at least
upon the 
Adriatick
 Coast: The Port
was Built, at least Restored and Beautified,
by 
Trajan
 the Emperour, in whose Ho∣nour
a most stately Triumphal Arch was
Raised upon it, which it yet extant, with
this Inscription in Capital Letters.

 And upon the
Right side thereof You may Read this
Inscription 
Plotinoe Aug. Conjugi Aug.

And upon the left, 
Divae Marcian: Aug:
sorori August.


Cenigalia
 is a little Town having a Sea-Port▪
It seems from the name to have
been built, and to have belonged to the

Galli Cenones.


Fano,
 Antiently 
Fanum;
 because of the
Temple of Fortune that stood here; There


is a stately Triumphall Arch of Marble
30, Cubits High. 
Pesaro
 is a very Plea∣sant
and handsome City having many
fine Houses and a Magnificent Palace, It
is well Peopled and well Fortified. The
Duke of 
Vrbin,
 to whom this City did
belong, used to pass one half of the Year
here; But since his Death without Heirs
Male the whole Dutchie is Reunited to
the 
Ecclesiastick
 state.


Rimini,
 in Latine 
Ariminum;
 is like to
be so called from the River 
Arimine
 that
passes by it. There are severall fair Pala∣ces
in it, built by the 
Mala-testi
 antient
Lords of the Place. There is a Triumph∣al
Arch erected in Honour of 
Augustus,

yet extant, and the Ruines of a great
Theatre. But the most considerable thing
of all is the Bridge, Built of great square
Marble stones, of twentie foot in length
and 15. in breadth, with five Arches.
The Bridge Joynes the 
Via Flaminia
 and
the 
Via Emilia
 together. It is said to have
been Built by 
Tiberius Caesar.
 In the
Mercat place there is to be seen the stone
upon which 
Julius Caesar
 stood, and en∣couraged


his Officers, when he began the
Civil War. This Stone hath this Inscrip∣tion

C. Caesar D. Rubicone superato, civili
Bello, Comilitones suos hic in for
 Arimi∣nensi
adlocutus.


Within a Mile of 
Cesina,
 or there a∣bouts,
You must pass the 
Rubicon,
 which
seems to be but a Torrent, and in the
Summer time for the most part dry; At
the place where You pass there is yet ex∣tant
an ancient Pillar, the Inscription
whereof hath made the name of 
Rubicon

so famous. it is as follows; 
Jussu manda∣tuve
P. R. Cos. Imp. Myli Tyro Co∣milito
manipulariaeve Cent. Turmaeve Le∣gionariae
armat quis quis est hic sistito.
Vexillum sinito, ne citra hunc amnem Ru∣biconem

And upon the other side of the Pil∣lar,
the following Inscription;
 Rubiconem

Furli;
 in Latine 
Forum Livii,
 where
there is litle thing considerable except the
Market Place.


Faenza;
 is divided in two by the Ri∣ver

Lamone,
 over which stands a goodly
Bridge that Joynes the two parts of the
Town together, it is called in Latine 
Fa∣ventia,

and the People 
Faventini.



The whole way from 
Ancona
 to 
Bo∣lognia

is Plain and Smooth, and the
Countrey on all sides very Rich and
Fertile, but especially near to 
Bolognia,

(which deservedly is called 
la Crassa
)
where the whole Countrey, on everie s
de
of the high way, looks like Gardens, be∣ing
Hedged and closed in on all sides,
and Planted with 
Olive
 and while 
Mul∣berry

Trees, the Leaves whereof 
erve to
the 
eeding of Silk Wormes, and at the
Roots of which the Vines being Plant∣ed,
run up and spread themselves thorow
all the Branches of the Trees, and load
them with Grapes. The distance betwixt
the Ranges of Trees is Sowen sometimes
with Wheat, or other usefull Grain, or
Kitchin Herbs and Roots, Nor is there
wanting here abundance of the Choisest
Fruits that 
Italy
 affoords.


Bolognia;
 is the second Town of the
Ecclesiastick State, sweetly situated in a
large Plain, near to some Hills at the one
side. The City is near two Miles in
length and one in breadth, and about 5
Miles in Compass. The Inhabitants are


not esteemed to be under 80 Thousand in
number, amongst which it is thought
there are two Thousand Gentlemen,
whereof many have the Titles of Count
and Marques. There is a famous U∣niversity
& many fine Colledges worthie
to be seen: As also many fine Churches &
Religious Houses. The Archdean of the
Cathedral of St. 
Peters,
 has the Privi∣ledge
of making Doctors, above others.
In the Church of 
Corpus Christi,
 may be
seen the intire Body of St. 
Katharine
 of

Vigri,
 a Religious Woman of the Order
of St. 
Clare,
 that Died at 
Bolognia,
 in
the Year 1463. She sits in a Chair, with
a Religious Habit. The Skin of her
Face seems to be bent and streacht, her
Eyes open, her Hands and Feet bare:
In one Hand She holds a Crucifix, the
other is placed upon a Pillow. They
use in the presence of a great deal of Com∣panie
to paire her Nails every Month,
and to cut her Hair once a Year, after
they are grown. In the 
Iacobins
 Church
is keept the Head of St. 
Dominick
 in a
Rich Tabernacle, and his Body in a Cu∣rious


Tomb of white Marble cut in se∣verall
figures of 
Base relieve;
 In the

Choire
 may be seen the Histories of the
New and Old Testament, with wonder∣full
Artifice represented in mosaick of
of Wood. There is also to be seen here,
a rare Peece of Painting, of the Innocents
made by 
Guido Reni;
 all the parts of
this Convent are worthie the taking no∣tice
of, the Cloisters, the 
Dormitories

of above 150 Religious, the Refictory
Painted by great Masters, the Apothe∣caries
Shop, and the Bibliotheck, and
the Cellar which is extraordinarly Big.


There be many fine Palaces worthie
the seeing, and very well Ornamented
within, but especially the 
Popes
 own Pa∣lace,
where the Legat resides, and in it
you must take particular care to see 
Al∣drovandi's

Studie, and Collection of Cu∣riosities,
which are keept in this Palace,
and commonly intrusted to the Legats
Physitian. There is likeways to be seen
in the Back Court 
Aldrovandi's
 Garden,
in which there are some Curious Plants.
In the Study you will see a great Her∣ball,


in water Colours, but without any
description, as also a whole press full of
Manuscripts, written all with his own
Hand.


There are severall Towres in the
Town, but especially that of 
Degli Pisanel∣li,

which is one of the highest I remember
to have ever seen; it stands about the
middle of the Town, and near by it
there is an other which is not finished,
and the reason they give for it is very
apparent, that the Builders mistook the
perpendicular; when one stands near to
it, it is so very crooked that it appears
to be just a falling. I had the Curiositie
to go as high in the other Towre as I
could, and rather because I thought I
might more easily discover the situati∣on
of the Town, it's avenues, and the
Country about, but I had much Reason
to repent me: The ladders for the most
part being old and rotten, so that I was in
continuall apprehension of falling, and
one slip would have done my turne as
well as a hundred. I shall advise you
rather to take the paines to see a Con∣vent,


a little without the Town, toward
the Hills, called St. 
Michaele in Bosco,

from whence you will have a most De∣licate
Prospect of the Town and Coun∣try
about. The Town appears in the form
of a Ship, and the Towre 
Deglipisanelli,

may be the maine Mast of it. This Con∣vent
is one of the most Glorious in 
Italy;

the Religious are of the Order 
di Monte
Olivetto,
 there are many other
things in the Town worthie the taking
notice of, which for brevities sake
I omit.


You must not forget to see the Silk-Work,
which is a most Curious con∣trivance;
it is three or four Storie high,
in the Highest Storie there are Innume∣rable
Pirns of Silk, which are all moved
by the generall Motion that the Wa∣ter
gives to some Wheeles below,
& there they receive the first Twist; in the
Storie next to that, they receive the se∣cond;
& in the lowermost Storie the last:
which brings it to that form of raw
Silk that we commonly see sold.


This Place above all others in 
Italy,



or in the World, is famous for excel∣lent
Soap-Balls, of which you will do
well to provide your self abundant∣ly;
they will keep in their perfection
above 20 Years: You may have them
of severall Sizes, bigger or lesser as
you please. It is likeways famous for
Sassadges, which are the best cetain∣ly
in tke World: I have seen of them
of 5 Crownes the Peece.


There is good Herbarising towards
the Hills, if your leisure can permit
you; you may take a Guide along
with you. Upon these Hills, you will
likeways find that famous Stone called

Lapis phosphorus Bononiensis,
 of which 
For∣tunatus
Lic
t
s
 hath written a particular
Book. It is very hard and Flintie like,
but more glistering; when it is calcined
48 hours in a reverberatory Fire & then
set to cooll: If you expose it a little to
the light and free Air, and on the sud∣den
bring it to the dark, it shines for a
little while as if it were a Red burning
Coale, but there is a kind of efflorescence
like Rust or greenish Dust that growes u∣pon


the Top of it, whilst it is a Calci∣neing,
which is most effectuall for the
shining, and which if it by lost by any
Accident, the rest will not be much
worth, and for saving of this they use or∣dinarly
to fix the Stone in Wax in the
bottom of a Box, & so sell them to Stran∣gers,
but this way does not secure them,
to my certain Experience. The best way
is to bring the Stone uncalcined and
prepare it at home. I would have you
to see an Apothecarie, who is a great Vir∣tuoso
especiallie in Plants. He is
called 
Jacomo Zanoni speciale da san
Biaggio custode de simplici in Bolog∣nia;

I believe he has Published something
of Plants by this time, for he shewed
me a Number of Brass cutts, which were
allreadie Graven, and told me the inten∣tion
he had as soon as he could get the
rest perfected, to cause print them. If
they may be had, I intreat you to pro∣cure
me one of them; you will do well to
see his Garden, which is very Curious. And
the best way to ingage all such Men as
he is, is to have allways a Parcell of rare


Seeds with you, and to give them some,
by which means you will find them rea∣die
to give you whatever they can spare,
in like manner.


I shall advise you to Visit the Book∣sellers
Shops, concerning which I must
give you this generall advice, for find∣ing
out 
Botanick
 Books, that you take
paines to look them all over your self;
for many times the Book-sellers do not
know their names. You will find here

Panacea ex herbis quae a Sanctis denomi∣nantur

Item 
Historia & Icones Capsico∣rum

Bono∣niae

1630. also 
Hyacinthi Ambrosini hor∣tus
Studiosorum & Novarum Plantarum
hactenus non S
ulptarum Historia
 in 40.

Bononiae
 1657. But above all I must in∣treat
you to buy me 
Aldrovandus
's works,
which ate 13 or 14 Tomes in 
Folio;
 you
may buy them in Sheets, and have them
packt up in your own things for 
Venice,

where you will not fail to meet with
frequent Occasions of sending them for

London.
 I believe they will not cost a∣bove
18 or 20 Crowns. and if they do
I shall be readie to allow it.



It will not be a miss here, if you think
fit, to go by Land to 
Modena, Parma

and 
Piatzena
 and returne by the River

Po
 to 
Ferrara:
 But because I had not the
Fortune to see them my self, I shall not
say any thing of them, but returne to

Ferrara,
 which is not above half a Days
Journie, or thereabouts, from 
Bolognia.


Ferrara,
 is situated in a large Plain about
half a mile distance from the 
Po.
 It be∣longs
to the Ecclesiastick State, and is
governed by the 
Popes
 Legate. The
Streets, Houses and Places, are very
handsome & fine, as also the Churches &
Religious Houses. In the Monasterie of
S. 
Bennet,
 you may see the Sepulchre &
Epitaph of the famous Poet 
Ariosto.
 It
hath a verie strong and well contrived

Cittadale.


From hence you go to 
Venice
 by Wa∣ter,
that is in an open Boat, by a 
Canale

near to the side of the 
Po,
 where ye im∣barke
in a bigger Vessel, which goes con∣stantly
twice a Week to 
Venice.
 If the
Wind be favourable, you will easily ac∣complish
the Voyage in 10 or 12 houres


time, but if otherways, you may be longer,
and therefore you will do well to make
Provision of Victuals, to take along with
you. When you Arrive at 
Venice,
 it
will be needfull to Lodge in a conveni∣ent
Place of the Town, and for that end,
you will do well to provide your self of
a Recommendation to the English Con∣sul;
from 
Rome
 or from 
Bolognia. Giles
Jones
 was Consul in my time, and en∣tertained
Lodgers himself, he was a ve∣rie
honest Man, and did faithfullie send
my things to 
London,
 according to the
address I gave him. When you are set∣led
in a Lodging, It will be time to
take a View of the Town, for the doing
of which and considering it well, 3 or
4 Weeks is little enough. Nothing in
Nature can appear more prodigious than
to see a Vast big Town seated in the mid∣dle
of the Sea; everie House whereof at
one side or another is touched by the
Water, and the nearest Land being 4 or
5 Miles distance. It was built at first u∣pon
the little Island of 
Rialto
 in the Year
421, perhaps later by the Inhabitants of the


firm Land that were chaced from their
own homes by 
Attila
 King of the 
Huns,
 &
forced to make choice of this place for
their safety; since that time they have built
upon 70 or 71 Isles more, which are joy∣ned
together by upwards of 450 Bridges.
The Town is about 8 Miles in compass.
There are but few Streets built on both
sides, except some open places. The
most part of the Streets have a Canale
or Ditch in the middle, by which the
Gondols pass, which is a great commo∣ditie,
for there is scarce a House in the
Town, but one may be carried this way,
either close to it or within a few steps of
it. The Canals are different in breadth,
some more some less large, the narrowest
is broad enough for one Gondole to go
by another; It is remarkable, that the
Water Ebbs and Flowes here 4 or 5 foot,
which is not observed in the 
Adriatick

farther down towards 
Naples,
 nor in a∣ny
other Port of the 
Mediterranian
 Sea;
The Gondals are believed to be above
fourteen or fifteen thousand in Number;
they are small tight Boats much cleaner &


finer than Oares upon the 
Thames,
 having a
prettie Tilt over the seat where the Passin∣gers
sit, & will be able to accommodat 5
or 6 Persons: It is usual for Gentlemen
or Persons of Qualitie to have their own
Gondols, and those Richer than the or∣dinary;
some are rowed by one, some by
two, and it is somewhat extraordinary
that the Rower does not sit within the Boat,
but stands upon one side of it, and lookes
the same way that he rows. At the tur∣ning
of any Corner, after they come with∣in
such a distance of it, they are oblig∣ed
to cry, to give notice to the Gondols
on the otherside whom they cannot see,
and he that cryes first hath this advan∣tage,
that he turnes close by the corner,
and the others are obliged to give him
way and take it larger: And I assure you
it is no small wonder to me that there
being so many corners to tur
e, and so
continuall and frequent intercourse of
Gondols going some the one way, and
some the other; and in the dark as well
in the Day: there should be so few Ac∣cidents
of running one another down, e∣speciallie,


considering with what swift∣ness
thay go. The largest Canale, called

Canale grande,
 is about 13 or 14 hun∣dred
paces in length; & fourtie in breadth,
and divides the Town as it were in two.
The Bridge of the 
Rivo alto,
 or as it
is commonlie pronounced 
Rialto,
 is one
of the most magnificent Structures in the
Citie: it consists but of one 
Arch,
 & yet
is said to have cost above 250 thousand
Duckets; at the one end of the Bridge,
there are three large Streets divided by 2
rowes of Houses, which are so many
Merchant shops. This serves for the Ex∣change,
where the Merchants meet about
Noon to do their affairs.


There are so manie things considerable
in this Place that it is difficult to compre∣hend
them in this short Narration, and
therefore I shall onlie name a few of them,
and leaue the rest to your particular in∣quirie,
which will not be hard for you
to make, when you are upon the place.
Be pleased then first to take notice among
the Churches of that of St 
Mark,
 which
properlie, is onlie the Dukes Chapel be∣longing


to the Palace of St. 
Mark,
 whose
Bodie being brought from 
Alexandria
 is
preserved here; The Church has 24 
Cha∣noines

belonging to it under one Head,
called 
Primicero.
 He is commonlie
chosen by the Doge, and wears the Mi∣ter
and other Ornaments of a Bishop, &
uses to give his Benediction to the People
as Bishops do. The inside of the Church
is of Marble of diverse sorts, and all ve∣rie
fine, with above 40 Marble Pillars;
It is paved with Porphire, Serpentine &c.
in Mosaick Work; Upon the Top of the
great Altar, there is a Globe enriched with
a great number of Pearles and other
Jewels of price; The Roof of the Church
consists of 5 
Cupula's
 covered with lead;
It hath 5 Doors of Brass, and over the
great entrie on the outside there stands
four Delicat Horses, equal in bigness to
the Natural, of Brass Guilded, which at
first were placed upon the Triumphal

Arch
 of 
Nero,
 after he subdued the 
Parths,

but were afterward carried to 
Constanti∣nople,

when the Seat of the 
Empire
 was
removed from 
Rome
 and at last brought


hither by the 
Venetians
 when they took

Constantinople. 2ly.
 That which is most
worthie of the seeing (it may be in all the
World) is the Treasure of St. 
Mark,

where amongst other things you will see
12 Royal Crowns & 12 
Breast
 Plates of
Gold, ful of Pearles and Jewels; taken as
they say at 
Constantinople;
 And the Traditi∣on
is, that they were the Ornaments of the
12 Maids of Honour that waited upon
St. 
Helena
 Mother to 
Constantine
 the

Emperour;
 several Rubies weighing 8
Ounces a Peece, and a Saphir that weighs
ten Ounces; two Unicorns Horns; se∣verall
Vessels of Precious Stones▪ as A∣gat,
J
spir &c; one of Emerauld which
a King of 
Persia
 presented the Senat with.
One of one single Turkis; another capable
to hold a 
Scots
 Quart of one single Granat;
The Tiar or Bonnet wherewith the Duke
is Crowned, is Garnished with Jewels of
inestimable price; There is a vast deal
of other Riches, which I cannot particu∣larly
remember; There is likewa
s to
be seen the Picture of the blessed Virgin
done by St 
Luke.
 The Acts of the A∣postles


writen in golden Letters by the
hand of St 
John Chrysostome, Patriarch
 of

Con
tantinople.
 It will be worth your while
to go to the Top of the Steeple, from
whence you will have a delicat Prospect
of the whole City and Neighbouring
Islands, of a part of 
Lumbardie,
 of the
severall Mouths of the River 
Po,
 The Hills
of 
tria;
 & the Sea about▪ 
3ly:
 The Palace
of St 
Mark,
 whereof the 
Arches,
 Pillars,
Halls and Chambers are all most Statelie,
especialy the great Halls, which are Painted
by the greatest Masters of their time; for
the fetter understanding of which, it will
be fitt, that you get a Printed Invento∣rie

f all the particular Ornaments of
this Palace.


4ly,
 The 
Piazza
 of St 
Marco,
 which
is one of the Largest and finest that can
be 
 in any Town in 
Italy;
 being com∣
sed
with most Stately and regular
Buildings▪ with large 
Arches
 and 
Porti∣c
es

to walk in, in the time of Heat or
Rain▪ with all sorts of Merchandise and
Trades. This Place is the most diver∣ticeing
in all 
Venice,
 for here you may


see People of many Nations with
different Habits. At that end of that
place which lookes to the Sea, there
stands two Marble Pillars, each of them
of them one Peece, of a great hight and
bigness, at a reasonable Distance one
from another. Upon the Top of the one
is placed a flying Lion guilded, which
is the Armes of 
Venice,
 and the
Symbole of St 
Mark;
 Upon the Top of
the other the Statue of St 
Theodore
 gilded.
Betwixt these Pillars, Justice is usuallie
done upon Male-factors. About the
middle of the place stands 3 verie Tall
Poles like unto Ships Masts, whereupon
the Standards of the Republick are di∣splaied
at great Solemnities. On that side of
the place, which is opposit to the Dukes
Palace, stands the 
Mint-House,
 a verie
goodlie Fabrick, composed of Stone and
Iron, without any Wood at all. 
5ly.
 The

Arsenal,
 which is the largest and best
Furnished in the World; it is strongly
Walled about, and the Sea drawn about
it likeways. There are fifteen or sixteen
hundred Men constantly at Work, be∣sides


Old Men, who are not able to
work, but intertained for instructing
the younger. Here are keept all sort of

Amunitions
 of War both for Sea & Land,
in vast Quantities, and in that good Or∣der,
that I have heard some confident∣lie
say, 
that there were Workmen with∣in
the
 Arsenal, 
that were able to build
a
 Gally, 
and reik her out compleatly in one
Hours time;
 which if it be true, argues
a great deal of sharpness in the Work∣men,
and readiness of the Materials.


There are severall lesser Islands at some
distance from the Town, worthie to be
seen, and particularlie, 1. 
Murain
 a∣bout
a Mile Northward from the City.
It is well built and many good Houses in
it; It is in this Island, that all those fa∣mous
Crystall Glasses so much talked of,
and so much sought after throughout
the World, are made. It is observed
here, that the Glass-works succeed
much better on the one side of the Street
than on the other. They have likeways
a great Art of whitneing Wax, which is
observed to succeed better in this Island


than any other place in or about the City.
There are abundance of Oysters likeways
in this Island; they ordinarly keep them
in Baskets near the Shoare, to have them
in readiness when they are called for,
but in my opinion they are neither so
pleasant, no
 so wholesome as at 
Lighorn

and other places, especiallie being eaten
raw, for I have often found the eating
of them so, to give a verie troublesome
Flux of the Belly to severall Persons.

2ly.
 The Isle of St 
Helena,
 where there
is a verie statelie Monasterie & Church,
with 
Monks
 of the 
Order
 of 
Mont O∣livet.

In this Church is keept the Body
of the 
Emperess
 St 
Helena.
 This Isle
lyes to the Eastward of the Town, and
about two Miles further the same way,
stand the two Forts 
del L
do
 and 
Casiel∣novo,

which both defend them selves
mutuallie, and secure the entrie to the
City from Enemies in time of War▪

3ly. Malamocco,
 where all Ships and
Vessels of anie considerable Burden do
Arrive because of the deepness of the 
Har∣bour.
4ly.
 The Isle of St. 
George,
 lying


just before the place of St. 
Mark,
 at half a
Miles distance, where there is an 
Abbace

of the 
Order
 of St. 
Benedict,
 with a most
Stately and Glorious Church, together
with a Garden and fair Walks, which
is thought no small thing in that
Place.


Altho' a Traveller cannot be alltoge∣ther
sure of his times, there being so many
Contingencies that may force him either
to Arive too soon or too late; yet it were
to be wished that a Man might happen
to be at 
Venice
 in the time of 
Carnoval,

because of the 
Opera
's and fine shows
that are to be seen, and the Extraordi∣narie
Musick at that time. In the 
Sum∣mer

time the great Divertisement is to go
in Gondole upon the great Canale, where
towards the Evening, one may see Five,
or six hundred Gondols touring up and
down, full of Ladies and Gentlemen, &
severalls of them with Musick, both Vo∣cal
and Instrumental; which is one of
the greatest 
Gusto's
 imaginable.


You cannot miss to meet with a great
many Curiosities here, both Natural and



Artif
cial,
 because of the great resort
that Strangers have to this Place, espe∣ciallie
from the 
Levant;
 you will find

Medals, Intaleo's, Chamaeo's
 &c. amongst
the Goldsmiths. I have seen severall Cu∣riosities
to sell in the place of St. 
Mark,

and sometime within the Court of the Pa∣lace,
and in many other corners through∣out
the City. You may meet with ma∣by
Curiosities of 
Glass,
 that are both use∣full
and delightfull. It will be worth
your while to Visit the Book-sellers Shops,
for besides many Curious Books, that
you may light upon here, and particu∣larly
of 
Botany;
 you may likeways find
verie many Books, that are prohibited
in many other places of 
Italy.
 Be plea∣sed
to inquire diligently for a thin 40.
called 
Trattato de simplici Pietre. & pesci
marini che nascono del lito di Venetia di
Antonio Donati Farmacopeo all'insegn

di St. Liberale in Venetia
 1631. Printed
by 
Pietro Maria Bertano. Donati
 him∣self
was Dead before I came thither, but
I found out his Brother, a Man of the


same Profession and living at the same
place, but nothing knowing in 
Simples.

After I had told him the respect I had for
his Brothers 
Memorie,
 and my regrate for
the loss of so worthie a person; he was
pleased to show me a great many 
Brass-Plates

of so many 
Plants
 not yet descri∣bed,
together with their description done
by his Brother; I am confident were they
Published, they would make a bigger Vo∣lume
than the first. They were in Con∣fusion
when I saw them, but I put them
in Order and prayed him to keep them
so, untill he should find the opportuni∣tie
of printing them, which I found him
willing to do at his own Expense, nor
to trust it with an other, least his Bro∣thers
name should have been stolen from
it. If it be not as yet printed, you may
see what you can do, either to purchase
the Manuscript and 
Plates,
 or promise the
printing of it.


There are many Virtuosi in the City,
that have great Collections of fine things
which you may be pleased to inquire af∣ter
and see.



From 
Venice
 you have twentie five
Miles to 
Padua,
 whereof fo
r by 
Berg
 to
the 
Terra ferma,
 and the rest you go by
Boat, drawen with Horses by the River

Brent,
 which is a most pleasant and soft
running River, having plain, Fertile &
most delicious Fields on either side, full of
Villages & pleasure-Houses, to which the
Inhabitants of 
Venice
 use to resort in the

Summer-Time.


The River runs not all of a Levell, &
therefore there are three or four 
Locks

or 
Sluces,
 by means whereof, at severall
places the 
River
 is made portable; which
otherways it would not be. There is such
an other 
Lock
 upon the 
Canale
 of 
Briar,

near to 
Montargis
 in 
France.
 You will
more easilie understand the manner
of them by seeing them, than by any de∣scription
I can make of them.


Padua,
 in Latine 
Pattavium.
 Is a very
Ancient and Large Town; famous over
the World, for its 
Vniversity;
 whence it
is called 
Padua la dotta.
 There are many
things considerable in the Town fit to be
seen and take notice of. As 1. The


Churches as namely that of S. 
Sophia,
 that
of 
Justino,
 which is all Pavemented with
white & red Marble; there is an 
Abbacy

joyning to it of the 
Order
 of St. 
Benedict;

the Reformation of which Order did begin
first here. It was Anciently the Temple
of 
Concord.
 The place before the Church
is very large & spacious. They say ten
Thousand Men might be drawn up within
it. The Church of St. 
Antonia de Lisbon,
 is
notably designed, and hath many Rich
things belonging to it; many Relique's,
but amongst others the most considerable
is the Body of St. 
Antonia,
 commonly
called of 
Padua,
 because he Died and was
in
erred here. There is great a Devotion
payed to this 
Sainct,
 and a great con∣course
dayly to the place, as well of the
Inhabitants of the Town, as of 
Pilgrims

that come from other places. They use to
kiss the 
Marble-Stone
 that covers his Se∣pulchre;
and they say it smels of Musk.

2ly.
 The palace of Justice, which is most
stately. The Stairs are all of 
Marble
 cover∣ed
with 
Lead
 without the support of a∣ny
Pillar. The great 
Hall
 is 256 foot in


length, and 86 foot in breadth, and very
well painted, and at the end of it, that
Statue of 
Titus Livius,
 whose Tomb is
likeways to be seen in the Town. 
3ly.

The Schooles, which is a very stately
Fabrick, being a 4 square court, where
you will see a great many of the Statues or

Busta
's, Names & Arms of so many Consuls,
that have been of the several Nations that
compose the 
Vniversity;
 the 
Scholars
 here
have large 
Priviledges,
 and many times
abuse them, and become very insolent,
insomuch that they have been sometimes
known to threaten the 
Podesta
 himself
or Governour of the Town; they have,
likeways a beastly custome of carrieing
Arms in the Night, insomuch that it is
never safe to be abroad after it hegins to
be Dark, for many are this way unhap∣pity
Murthered without any Offence given
or taken, but only by wantoness, or ra∣ther
Wickedness of the Scholars. 
4ly.

The Physical Garden, which is exceeding∣ly
fine, not so much for the number as
rareness of the 
Plants.
 You may easily
make your addrefs to the Professor that


keeps the Garden who in my time was
the 
Excellentissimus Signeur Tore,
 but the
Gardener will be sufficient to do your
turn, for in giving him a small peece of
Mony, you will command both 
Seeds,
Plants,
 and all that he hath. We have
a very worthie Gentleman of our Coun∣trie,
called Doctor 
Cadenhead;
 in my time
he was Publick Professor of 
Logick nel Bo,

which is the Publick 
Schooles.
 He is a
most courteous and obliging Gentleman,
and will be ready to do you all the kind∣ness's
Imaginable. 
5ly.
 You may see the
Hospitals for sick Folk, and many other
things, which for Brevities sake I omit,
only I intreat you be at the paines to
Visit the Book-sellers Shops; and if there
be any new thing in Physick, since the
62 or 63 Year of God, I intreat you to
bring them along with you for me, espe∣cialy
if there be any thing of 
Rhodius,

who hath promised us his commenta
s
upon 
Cornelius Celsus
 long ago.


If you please, you may make a little
Journey to the 
Euganean
 Hils, which are
not far from 
P
dua.
 There is very good


Herborsing upon them. It will be worth
your while, likeways to see 
Abbano,
 a
Village 3. or 4 Miles distant from 
Padua;

famous for its Natural Baths. At the end
of the Village there is a little rising or

know;
 upon the Top of which there
are a great many Springs of hot Water,
some where of are scalding hot. The Wa∣ter
is convoyed by little Conduits to
several Houses about, where Baths are
keept for sick People, but the greater
part of it is convoyed the other way by a
trough, where, at the distance of a Musket
shot, it moves a Milne. The water it
self is whitish, having a white slimy sub∣stance
in it, which it deposes every where,
where it runs, and which in process of
time becomes as hard as a Stone; in so
much that the Miln-Wheel, and all the
Wood that is toucht by it, becomes cru∣sted
as it were with 
Marble;
 and if it
be not broken of timeously, it stops the
Motion of the Wheel just as 
I
eicles
 use
to do with us. The Country about 
Pa∣dua

is very Plain and exceedingly Fer∣tile,
insomuch that they use to say, 
B
∣lognia


la grassa, ma Padua la passa;
 yet
the Wine is not good, but a red small
Claret-Wine such as they use at 
Venice

for ordinarie drink. When you ha

past some time at 
Padua,
 and satisfied
your self, of all that is to be seen and
known there, it will be time to set 
or∣ward
for 
Milan.

In going from 
Padua
 to 
Vicenza,
 you
will do well to turne a little out of 

way to see a place called 
Gus
so,
 

is a House of Pleasure belonging to a 
r∣
ticular
Person, where, besides many 
∣riosities,
of Gardens &c. there is p
ti∣cular
wayes of conveying the Win
 

the 
Caves
 below to the upper 



which makes a Delicat 
Fresco
 in the grea∣test
heats of Summer. It stands at the
foot of a very great 
Mountain,
 under
which are the vastest and biggest 
Caves
 I
ever saw; but seem not to be Natural,
but rather Quarries, out of which the
greatest part of the Stone that 
Vicenza
 has
been built with, has been taken. In one
place of these 
Caves,
 there is a little Well
made by the Water that drops from the Top
of the 
Cave,
 which petrifies any Wood,
Straw &c. that lyeth any time in it, and
yet the Water keeps clear it self, with∣out
congealing. Near to the City of 
Vi∣cenza,

upon your left hand, you wil see
a delicat Peece of 
Architecture,
 made by
the famous 
Architect Vinogli,
 which is like∣ways
designed in his Book; It is only
a House of Pleasure, and stands upon a
considerable hight from the City, disco∣vering
all the Country round about.


Vicenza
 is a good large Town, having
many fine Churches and Palaces, with a
large place for Tilting and other Exercises:
there is likeways in it a Noble Theatre built
by 
Vinogly:
 the Country about is exceed∣ingly


Fertile, and abounds with all sort
of good Fruit, and is therefore called
the 
Garden of Venice.


Verona
 is an easie days Journey from

Vicenza;
 It is an Ancient City, large
and well built, having many stately Pa∣laces,
Churches &c. & an old 
Amphitheatre,

yet more intire than any other in 
Italy.
 The
Town is divided in two by the River 
A∣dice,

it is wel Fortified, having 13 
Roy∣al
Bastions,
 and three 
Castles;
 the two
parts of the Town, are conjoyned by 4
large 
Stone Bridges.
 There is excellent
Herborizing upon the Hils near to the
City, but especially upon the 
Monte baldo,

which is about 20 Miles distant from
this City, and which is described at great
length by 
Joannes Pona,
 whose Book I
suppose you have seen. The Palace 
del
Conte Justi,
 is worthie the seeing, toge∣ther
with the Gardens and 
Grotta's.
 A∣mongst
the rest, there is one of a Reaso∣nable
Capacitie built with that Artifice,
that four Persons being placed in the
four Corners, may speake each of them
to his Neighbour in the opposit Corner,


and yet not be heard by those that stand
in the middle between them. In the Pa∣lace
of the 
Signeur Conte Gregorio Bevi∣la
▪

there is a Gallerie, in which you may
see a great many fine Pictures, Statues,

Medals,
 and other Rarities.


rom 
Verona
 you pass by 
la peso
eira,

which is a strong Fort, upon the River

 issues from the 
lago di Garda:
 from

 you go to 
Dissanzano,
 which tho'

 big Town, but rather a Village, I
look upon it as one of the pleasantest

 in 
Italy;
 being upon the side
of 
 
lago di Garda,
 a Lake not so

 as long, for in length it reaches to

 
Rhetici.
 The Country about

 and Fertile, and the Lake it

 
ounds with all sorts of Excellent

 such as 
Pykes, Pearches,
 red and

 Trouts &c. and of all there are

 very big. In my time there was

 
rench-man, that keept a very good

, where we had excellent Fare

 of fish and Flesh, and the best Wine

 the whole State of 
Venice,
 and all at

 Rate.



From 
Dissanzano,
 you go to 
Bre
cia,

which is not above half a days Journey
distant from 
Dissanzano.
 It is a large
and very strong Town, especialy the Ca∣stle
thereof placed upon a Hill, that Com∣mands
the Town. It is famous for ma∣king
of 
Guns,
 and 
Pistols,
 especialy the

Cannons
 of them, which are the best I
ever saw by farr. If you have the op∣portunity
of carriage, it would be worth
your while to make Provision for your
self here. If you resolve to make your
return, not to 
Lions
 but, throw 
Switzer-Land

and 
Germany,
 down the 
Rhen,
 &
so throw 
Flanders
 and 
Holland,
 then it
will be fitt when you are at 
Bol
gnia

to go up the 
Po,
 by 
Modena, Parma,
Piazz
nza,
 and so to 
Millan,
 and from
thence to 
Turrin,
 and then back to 
Mil∣lan

again, and so returne by the other
way of 
Bergamo, Brescia, Dissanzano,
Verona, Vicenza
 and 
Padua
 to 
Venice,
 by
which means you will not only see the
sweetest and most Fertile places of 
Lum∣bardie,

but also have the commoditie of
bringing what ever you find in all that


way to 
Venice,
 from whence it may easily
be Convoyed into 
England.
 From 
Bres
i

to 
Bergamo
 you have a dayes Journey:
You must Dine at a Place called 
Pallazolo;

It is a little inconsiderable Town. I re∣member
we had a Letter of Recommen∣dation
from the Duke of 
Norfolks Ma∣jor-Domo

at 
Padua,
 to a Gentleman in
this place, who was exceedingly Civil to
us & sent us a Present of excellent Wine, &
(which was of farr greater importance to
us) gave us the assurance of the peaceable∣ness
of the Countrey & security of Travell∣ing,
which sometimes is not without the
danger of being robbed; it being near the
Frontiers of the state of 
Millan:
 & in such
cases, it is usual for Rogues, when they
have done a Mischief to pape into the
next state, where the Laws of the other
State cannot reach them. The project
of our recommendation, was to have
been conducted by this Gentleman on our
way; if there had been any such need.
He willingly profered it, but we, upon
the assurance he gave us did as willingly
deny to accept it.




Bergamo
 is situated upon the side of a Hil,
Fortifie with 9 
Bastions
 besides the 
Castle,

which is extreamly strong. There is, as
I take it, in the 
Dominicans
 a Rare 
Bibli∣otheque,

Collected by the great expense of

Alexander Martinengo,
 You will do well
here to exchange all your 
Venetian
 Money
into 
Spanish
 Money, & such as will pass into
the State of 
Millan.
 You have a Days
Journey from hence to 
Millan,
 and must
Dine at a Place called 
Villa nova:
 as soon
as ye have Dined, you pass the River

Tesin:
 And then enter the State of

Millan.


As you enter the State of 
Millan,
 you
will find some Searchers or wayters of
the Custom-House, to whom you must
give some small thing to let your Baggage
pass, or else you may be troubled with
them.


The State of 
Millan,
 altho' but small
in extent, is yet one of the pleasantest &
Fertilest places in 
Italy.
 The Country
is very Plain. The High-ways for the
most part very large and straight, plant∣ed
with 
Trees
 and 
Hedges,
 on every side,


and having Canales of water, for the most
part, on every side; and Travellers have
this Advantage also to meet with better

Inns
 and better accommodation here than
on any other Road in 
Italy.
 The Inha∣bitants
are not given to mutiny and Re∣bellion
as those of 
Naples,
 but willingly
submit to their Prince. It is said that
the King of 
Spaine
 Governs the Kingdom
of 
Sicilie
 with mildness: 
Naples
 with
subtilitie and the Dutchie of 
Millan
 with
Authoritie. They say likeways that the
inferior Governours of 
Sicilie,
 only but
Gentlie: Those of 
Naples
 eat lustilie, but
that in 
Millan
 they devoure. I have
observed throughout all 
Italy,
 that the
greatest part of the 
Inn-keepers
 and 
Ta∣verners

even in 
Rome
 it self are 
Mila∣nese:

as also that the greatest part of the
Masons that serve all 
Italy,
 are of this
Countrie: and it is a verie great Mark
both of their love to their Countrie and
loyaltie to their Prince, that when they
are not able to get so much by staying at
home, as to entertain their Wives and
Children, and pay Publick Burdens, they


are contented to live abroad most part
of their lives, and returne that home
which they Gaine abroad; for they ne∣ver
carrie their Wives with them, nor
Children till they be able to Gaine for
themselves: Onlie it may be they make
them a Visit sometimes. The Citie of

Millan,
 which is Capital of the Dutchie,
is one of the stateliest in 
Italy:
 it is near
ten Miles in compass, but a considerable
part of it, especiallie toward the Walls,
is Gardens. The Streets are large & hand∣some;
Many statelie Churches and Pa∣laces:
But I shall Mark them a little more
particularly as I have done in other
Towns: And 1. to begin with the
Churches, It is said there are above 230
in the Citie and Suburbs, whereof 96
are parochial: 40 Convents of Religi∣ous
Men, and 50 of Religious Women.
The Cathedral Church called 
il Domo,
 is
one of the greatest and most Glorious in

Italy
 except St. 
Peters
 at 
Rome.
 It is
intirely built of white 
Marble
 within &
without, but that which is to be pitied is,
that the design is 
Gothick;
 it is not yet


quite finished; but they are still at work,
and you may guess when they are like
to come to an end, they haveing been
up wards of 200 Years at work allreadie.
There are above 600 
Marble
 statues a∣bout
the Walls, everie one of which
cost at least 1000 Crowns, amongst which
the statue of 
Adam
 and St. 
Bartholomew

are much esteemed, especiallie the latter
which is thought to be one of the best in

Europe.
 The Pend of the Church is
supported by 160 white 
Marble
 Pil∣lars,
each of them of that bigness,
that scarcelie can three Men fathom them.
It is believed that they stand not under
10000 Crowns a peece. All the rest of
the parts of the Church are correspondent
in Magnificenee, only it appears to me
to be somewhat darker than need were.
Amongst many other things that are
considerable in this Church is the Body
of St. 
Charles Boromeus
 in a Chappel un∣der
Ground. It hath a Lamp burning
before it, and you look down through
an Iron Tirles from the Church to see it.
You may see the Head and Feet, but the


rest of the Bodie is covered with his pon∣tificall
Habit. There is a rich Treasure
belonging to the Church, where you
will see, amongst other things▪ a Silver
statue of the same St. 
Charles
 in his Pon∣tifical
Habit, with many precious Stones
of great Value upon the Myter thereof.
It was presented by the Jewellers and
Goldsmiths of 
Millan.
 In the Church of
St. 
Ambrose,
 you may see a Pillar in the
middle of the Church, upon which stands
the 
Brazen Serpent
 that 
Moses
 elevated
in the Wilderness. You may likeways
see two statelie Tombs, one of the Em∣perour

Luis,
 and the other of 
Pepin
 King
of 
Italy,
 both Sons of 
Charles
 the Great.
Here also you may see the Chapel where
St. 
Augustine
 was Baptized. In the
Church of St. 
Satyre,
 upon the great Altar
there is a Picture of the blessed Virgin
with the Babe 
Jesus
 in her Armes, of
which they tell a wonderfull Story, that
it being placed upon the Church-Yard-Wall,
a certain Gamester called 
Massario
Vigonzonio,
 being mad to have lost his
Money, struck the little 
Jesus
 with a poy∣nard,


whereupon immediately there
gusht out abundance of Blood, after which
it was placed upon the great Altar
where it is yet to be seen.


2ly.
 The Palaces; amongst the rest
that of the Governour.


3ly.
 The Hospitals; which are said
to entertain above 9000 poor People all
the Year long, at the expence of the Pu∣blick.
That which is called the great
Hospital, entertaines alone more than
4000, and so it may, for it has three
Score ten Thousand Crowns of Yearlie
revenue. The 
Lazaretto
 is a kind of
Hospital without the Walls, It is a large
Square court about a Mile in Compass,
not unlike the form of the 
Carthusians

Houses; that are divided into so many
little appartments. The chief Design
& use of it, is in the time of the Plague:
at other times it stands emptie, only some
few persons that have the keeping of it,
remaine there.


4ly.
 The places in the Town; chiefly
the Exchange, where the Merchants
meet; there you will see the statue of St▪



Augustin,
 and the place where he taught
Rhetorick before his conversion to the
Christian Faith.


5ly.
 St. 
Ambrose
's 
Bibliotheck,
 where
not only these Books that belonged
to St. 
Ambrose
 himself, but many other
Books that have been presented since,
are kept.


6ly. Septalie
's Galerie. This 
Man∣fredo
Septali,
 is Son to that famous Phy∣sician

Ludovicus Septalius,
 who hath
written many things, & learnedly in Phi∣losophie
and Medicine. He is at present
one of the 
Canons
 of the great
Church; And one of the greatest Vir∣tuosi
in 
Italy.
 His Studie of Books con∣sists
of 2 or 3 Roomes. His Galerie of
Curiosities of three Roomes. The Cu∣riosities
are both Natural and Artificial,
of so great a Number and Varietie, that
I must not insist upon particulars; but
only refer you to the description there∣of
in Latine by 
Paulus Maria Tersagus,

the Book is in 40. 
Dertono
 1664, and
bears the name of 
Musaeum Septalianum.

He hath also an other Room or two, full


of working Tooles, 
ome for turning, o∣thers
for Grinding of optick Glasses of all
sorts and Fashion; and here you will see
a great Variety of Musical Instruments.
Most part of the Booksellers live near to
the Exchange, but their Magasins are
in severall other places of the Town; you
must be carefull to see them all. You
will undoubtedly find some to please, on
which perhaps you will not readily fall
else where.


You will meet with many Curiosi∣ties
in this place, especiallie of 
Cristal,

brought hither from the Alps, and a
Thousand Conceits, most delicatly
wrought of Straw. I have heard of
peeces of 
Cristal,
 with severall shapes re∣presented
within them naturally, as of
Trees, Flees, &c. others with a drop of
water within them, that one might per∣ceive
to move, but is was not my
Fortune to light on any such.


7ly.
 The Castle of 
Milan,
 is one of
the greatest Forts in 
Italy,
 with six Roy∣al
Bastions, a large Fossey full of running
water, and within it a second Wall of


strength. The Place within will admit
of 6000 Men to be drawn up, It has a∣bove
200 peece of 
Cannon▪
 all sorts of

Ammunition
 and 600 Spaniards in Ga∣rison.
It has a Water Miln within it
for Grinding of Corn, which is moved by
the running Water that fills the Ditches.


At a Miles distance from the Town,
there is a Privat Gentlemans House,
where the 
Echo
 is so excellent that it re∣peats
above 40 times, which you may try,
ether by speaking Loud or otherways with
a Trumpet; but the surest way is with
Pistol Shot, for then you may distin∣ctly
tell to 40, one after another.


The 
Carthusians
 have a stately Mona∣stery
at 10 Miles distance from 
Millan,

wihin five Miles of 
Pavia,
 which hath
500000 Crowns of Yearly revenue;
The Monks use to entertain Strangers
for one Night. The Church is of a
most Delicat Fabrick and very Rich.
If you please you may go from hence
to 
Pavia,
 Anciently 
Ticinum,
 and
afterward called 
Pavia.
 The Town is
very strong and stands upon the 
Tesin▪



It is the Chief 
Vniversity
 of the Dutchie
of 
Millan,
 but because I was not in it
my self I cannot say much of it, only I
have heard that in the great place of the
City stands the 
Brazen Statue
 of the Em∣perour

Constantine,
 or as some think of

Antoninus,
 very much esteemed. If you
list to go thither I believe it may be well
worth your seeing, because of the 
Vni∣versity,

for, for any thing I know, there may
be both good Books, and a 
Physical
 Gar∣den
there.


From 
Millan
 to 
Turin,
 you have about
73 
Miles.

You have two 
Rivers
 to pass, by Boat



viz.
 the 
Dorn,
 after you pass 
Vereelli

and the 
Tesin
 near to 
Ci
uas:
 Near to

Vercelli
 you enter into 
Piedmont,
 & there
you will meet with waiters or Customers
to whom you must give some thing, and
before this time it will be fitt that you
have changed all your 
Spanish
 Money ex∣cept
it be Pistols, or half Pistols of Gold,
for these will pass any where, either in

Piedmont
 or 
France.
 When you Arrive
at 
Turin
 you will think your self allrea∣dy
in 
France,
 for their Apparel, Customs
and Discourse, are almost altogether

French.


Turin, Augusta Taurinorum
 is the Ca∣pital
City of 
Piedmont,
 and is situated in
a Plain about 20 Miles distant from the
Alps; having the 
Po
 on the one side and
the 
Dorn
 on the other. The Dukes of

Savoye
 keep their Court here, and have
made it both very pleasant & very strong:
There is the old and new City, which is
very well and regularly built. It is com∣passed
with 
Royal Bastions,
 and Walls.
It hath a 
Citadale,
 consisting of 5 strong

Bastions.
 They say it is after the Mo∣del


of the 
Citadale
 of 
Antwerp.
 The great
Church is called the 
Domo,
 where a∣mongst
other relicts is keept and had in
Veneration the 
Sanctum Sudarium,

upon which the 
Visage
 of our Saviour &
the greatest part of his Body is impressed.
There is a famous 
Vniversity
 here, & this
is said to be the first Town in 
Italy
 that
had the first use of Printing. The Castle
serves now the Duke for a Palace. There
is a rare Galerie to be seen, with many
fine 
Pictures, Antick Statues
 &c. and a
great Collection of 
Manuscrips.
 Amongst
the new Buildings the Royal Place is con∣siderable;
the walks thereof being full of
Shops and Merchandice of all sorts. You
may likeways see the 
Valentine,
 which is
a beautifull Palace, built by 
Madam
Royal
 a little beneath the Town upon the
Bank of the 
Po▪
 In the Suburbs of the

Po,
 there is a House called 
Albergo
 wor∣thie
the seeing, because of the many ex∣cellent
Manufactories of Silk, and other
Stuffs that are made there.



I leave the rest to your own observa∣
ion,
that 
I
 may haste to bring you over

he Alps; the ordinarie way is to Tra∣
el
with the Messenger to 
Lions
 or to 
Ge∣
eva.

We came to 
Lions.
 It is a Jour∣
ey
of 8 or 9 dayes. The first day we

arted from 
Turin
 about ten a Clock in

he forenoon, and came to lye all Night

ome 10 or 12 Miles from 
Turin,
 having

llready entered into one of the Vallies

hat leads to the foot of the Hill; the
next day we Dined at an other little
Village hard by the foot of the Hill, cal∣
ed

Monte Cene,
 here we hired Mulets to

arrieus up the Hill; it being impossible for
our Horses to do it. You must likeways

ire Men to carrie you down on the
other side of the Hill, because it is a great
deal too far to walk, and the way that
the Horse goes, is farr about, because of
the steepness of the Hill. And yet 
I

mnst tell you that the Hill is three times
steeper and less accessible on the 
Italian

side than on the 
French
 side. As you
mount the Hill, at first you will find the
soyle somewhat fertile at least wayes for


pasturage and abundance of Wood; but
when you are 
ot higher you will find
nothing but Rocks, & Shrubs, here & there;
there is a little beck in the face of the
Hill, where there stands a few Houses, or
rather corbie nests; a habitation which
some People have chosen for the bene∣fit
they may make by Accommodating
Strangers that pass that way, for they
are all Victualing-Houses, and (as I take
it) a Smith or two. When you pass
this and continue still to 
Mount,
 you
will be about the middle Region of the
Air, and it's a hundred to one; but you
may see 
Clouds
 enough beneath you, &
it may be the Rain falling from them;
and then you will begin to find it cold
what ever time of the Year it be, and the
the higher you go it will still▪ be the

older, till you come to the very highest
pitch you are to go, and there you will
meet with a little House, in which one
can scarce stand upright, where, if you
have leisure, you will get some Bread &
Drink to buy; they usually have white
Hares and white Partridges to sell, and


as usuall it is for Strangers to buy them
for curiosities sake, & have them dressed
at their next Lodging. From this you
have a Plain of above half a mile in
length, which for the most part is co∣veted
with Snow, except in the heat of
Summer and then it will be green in
some places that are most exposed to the
Sunn. The great Pike of the Hill, which
yo
 leave upon the right hand as you
enter the plain, is above two miles high∣er,
and perpetualie covered with deep
Snow. About the middle of the plain
stands the ruin of a great House, which

Madam Ro
al
 began to build, but whi∣ther
she finished it or not, I cannot tell;
however I am sure nothing but 
omnipo∣tencie

could make a House resist the Rage
of so much Wind and Storm, as
that Place is Subject to. When you
come to the end of the plain, there is an
other little Victualling House, but it was
Desolate, when I pass'd. You quite your
moulets at the entrie into the Plain, and
take your own Horses, and here you
quite them again, and leave your Mes∣senger
to wait upon them to the bottom


of the Hill, the best way he can, and
permit your self to be carried by two
men which came along with you (for
according to the number of the Companie
there comes two for one from the 
Italian

side, as I hinted at before) It is a kind of
Barrow, with a litle Seat, & a back at it, with
two little handles to hold by, & a foot
board for streaching your limbs before
you, tyed at both ends with a peece of
small Rope, that they set 
ou upon; & then
carrie you the nearest way down the Hill,
which you would think steep enough for

Goats
 to climb. They go at the Rate of an
Ordinary Horse trot, & as they go will
trist the stones to step upon, which lye
confusedly here and there, as exactly as
if they were a paire of stairs and yet they
will not fall once in 500 times, and if
they should it would be a fall without
any great Perill. But indeed the danger
on the 
Italian
 side is much greater;
there being great Precipices on the one
hand, where into, if one should fall it
were impossible to escape, insomuch that
I have often wondred how any Body durst


adventure to climb upon a Beasts back:
and yet is admirable to see with it what
dexteritie these poor Moulets pick out their
way, where scarce any man could crawle
all four, & how sure footed they are. But
I must returne to the 
French
 side, where
you may pay off your porters when they
have brought you to your Lodging at
a little Village near to the foot of the
Hill. The ordinarie rate is a Crown a Head
that is, half a Crown to every Porter.


I have told you the way of passing the

Mount Cene
 at such Seasons, of the Year,
as there is little or no Snow: But in the
Winter time when the Snows are fallen
the Passage is much more uneasie & un∣safe,
especiallie if they be newly fallen,
and the paths not trod; for then it is
not only impossible to go without 2 or 3
Guides, that in case one should drop
throw the Snow there may be more hands
to let fall a Rope and bring him up a∣gain;
for sometimes that will happen, as
when a Courier is necessitat to pass up∣on
important affairs, & any of the Guides
chance to mistake a step, he will some


times slip down 100 fathom or two.
But this is not the greatest Danger nei∣ther,
for in the 
French
 side, from the foot
of the Hills, you have a whole dayes Jour∣ney
and more through a narrow Valley
with a small River in the middle of it,
which, at the foot of the Mount 
Cene,
 one
may easilie step over, but it grows still big∣ger,
as it advances throw the Valley; being
increased by the water that pours from
everie cleft of the Hills and Rocks, which
are on everie side of the Valley, of a pro∣digious
height, and most precipitious:
The current of the River falling some∣times
to be on one side of the Valley, and
sometimes on the other, for the most
part casts the highway on the contra∣ry
side; So that verie often you
will chance to pass under horrible Rocks
that hang over the high way, and when
the Snow is new fallen and they loaden
with it, the least noise in the World
would bring down a whole Mountain
of Snow, So that if a Passinger were so
caught, you might look upon him as bu∣ried
till the following Spring.



But I shall advise you to choose a fitter
Season, and then you will have the Satis∣faction
of Herborising, for the lower parts
of the Hills are all covered with Trees &
many sorts of Plants, that do not grow
Naturalie in an other Soil. I confess
my Fortune, as to this, was ill; for af∣ter
I past the 
Monte Cene,
 we had a con∣stant
deluge of Rain, till I came the length
of 
Chamberrie.
 But I must not here for∣forget
to acquaint you with an other par∣ticular
that had almost escaped me, in
time of Snow: and it is this. When
you come to the 
French
 side (supposing
the Snow to be frozen and able to bear
above;) there is a singular way of go∣ing
down the Hill, which they call 
R
∣masser,
ou se faict Ramasse.
 That is to
have a little hurdle of Wood, upon which
the Passingers is placed, with a little bit
of Boord behind it, upon which the fel∣low
stands that Guides the way, and so
you come hurling down together, at a
greater rate than the swiftest Horse in the
World is able to go.



I do not remember to have remarked
any thing worthie the troubling you
with, upon the way from 
Mont Cene
 un∣till
you come the length of 
Momilian,
 ex∣cept
only that the Inhabitants near the

Alps,
 are troubled with a certain Dis∣ease
called 
Bronchocele,
 which is an out∣ward
swelling in their Throats from the
Chin downward, sometimes to the mid∣dle
of their Breast, so that they appear at
first to have no Neck or Chin, but one
continued Thing from their Mouth down∣ward.
It is exceedingly hard and easily
affected with Cold; the cause of it is be∣lieved
to be their continual Drinking of
Snow-water, which runs continually
from the Neigbouring Hills.


Montmelian,
 is a Fortress of great
strength upon the Borders of 
Savoye
 near
to 
Daufin;
 it is the only considerable
place for strength in all 
Savoye,
 & stand

within 3 leagues of 
Chamberrie,
 & with∣in
5 or 6 of 
Granoble,
 which is a Parlia∣ment
Town, and the Capital City o


Daufine;
 as 
Chamberrie
 is of 
Savoye.
 

the necessity of your occasions and you



Engagement to the Messenger oblige
you not to go straight to 
Lions,
 it will be
very proper to see 
Granoble,
 Anciently
called 
Gratianopolis
 from the Emperour

Gratian:
 not that he was the first Foun∣der
of it, but because he enlarged it
much, and beautified it. It lyes in a plain
at the foot of the Hill 
Chelmont,
 and hath
the River 
Isere
 on the one side, & 
Drac,

which is an impetuous torrent on the o∣ther.
A little beyond the 
Drac,
 there
is a wonderfull Curiositie to be seen; that
is, a Fountain that burneth constantly.
The Fields about the Town are exceed∣ing
Fertile, and carrie good Wine, but
the neighbouring Hills are so high, that
you may see Snow all the dayes of Sum∣mer
upon their Tops. The Manufacto∣rie
of Gloves and dressing of Skins of all
sorts is much commended in this City.


But the most considerable thing in all this
Country to be seen is the great 
Charter-House,

so called because the General of
the 
Order
 is obliged to Reside here. It
is a statelie Monasterie, but stands in the
wildest place that ever my feet trod


upon. The Reason they give for choos∣ing
this place is, because St. 
Bruno,
 the
first 
Instituter
 of their 
Order,
 did pen∣nance
here; It stands very near the 
Mount
Chelmount,
 being three Miles distant from

Granoble
 by a continual ascent. These
three leagues will take you eight or nine
good Hours riding, for in many places it
is not safe to ride, and you must be for∣ced
to walk a foot. About the mid-way
there stands a little inconsiderable Vil∣lage
of 4 or 5 Houses, where it wil be
fit to repose a little; you will get Bread
and Wine, and it's fourtie to one but
you may meet with some good peece of

sanglier,
 which abounds upon the Hill;
being it is for the most part covered with
Trees. When you come within a Mile
of the House, you meet with a great Port
and a Porter to wait upon it, who I sup∣pose
shuts it in the Night time. Within
the Port there is a Bridge over a great Cleft,
within, which runs a little Rivolet; there
is no possibilitie of entering any where
on that side, but by this Port, from which
you ascend still to the Monasterie, but,


the way is easie, and all within the top

of the Hills covered with 
Oakes, Beeches,

and 
Firr-Trees;
 within half a Mile of
the Monasterie or some less, stands their
Stables, Garnels and other Office-Houses,
which indeed are statelie and well ap∣pointed,
for there▪ they have lay-brothers
of all Trades that serve to their purpose,
and to this place it is that your Horses
are sent back from the Monasterie to be

eept till your going away, and if by
chance any of your own or Horse-Fur∣niture
had been broken by the way, or
your Horses lost a Shooe, they will be all
repaired next Morning without your de∣siring
it. They have good store of Hay,
and have made severall Closes near to the
Monasterie, (which stands on that side
of the Hill that hangs to the Southwest,
and consequently has most of the Sun
for making of Hay,) having felled down
all the Wood that grew upon them.
When you Arrive at the Monasterie, you
alight from your Horses and then the Por∣ter
desires you to stay untill he call the
Prefect, who presently comes and informs


himself of your Names, Qualities, Coun∣try,
and the Occasion of your coming
(for most part come out of Devotion, and
they be but few Strangers that come for
Curiositie, but however all are welcome,)
which being done he craves you Patience
to acquaint the General, but he very
soon returnes to conduct you to your a∣partement,
only you must leave your
Swords and Pistols with the Porter at the
Gate. The Monasterie is verie large, and
they have a different apartment for most
Nations. We were carried into one
that was very convenient, being a large
Room wanscoted about with Firr-
ords;
and for Fireing, every Log of Wood
they put on, is like the End of a Ships-Mast.
Our Beds for the most part were
at the sides of the Room within the Wal,
all boorded abou
 like a Ships Cabbin;
and for Courtens having two folding
leaves, which you may shut or leave open
at pleasure. Upon our first Arrival into
this Room, we were presented with a
Collation of very good Wine, Bread,
Butter and Cheese; and then a Guide


given us to conduct us up the Hill, yet
half a Mile further, to see St. 
Bruno
's
Chapel, that stands in the place where
he did his Pennance for many Years to∣gether,
as they will more particularly in∣form
you, & as you returne they will let
you see another Chapel Dedicated to our
Lady. By that time you are returned to
the Monasterie it will be time to Supp,
and then according to your number you
will be treated with more or fewer Di∣shes.
We were only six in Companie,
and we had above 30 Dish of Meat, but
there was not above three or four Varieties,
except in the way of dressing; & for that
they are admirable. I believe we had at
least a Dussen of different dishes of Eggs,
all prepared in different maners; the rest
were a few Fishes and 
Fritato
's, for see∣ing
they never eat Flesh themselves, it
cannot be exspected they should give it
to any other Body within their Mona∣sterie.
The next Morning the Prefect
conducts you thorow the House, shewes
you the different Apartments, and parti∣cularlie
to us was shown that of the



English
 Nation, which they used to Assigne
for them in former times, but now be∣cause
of their defection from the Faith,
they have given it to the 
German
 Nation.
They show you painted about the Walls
the severall Torments & Deaths inflicted
upon those of thei
 
Order
 in 
England,
 in the
time of King 
Henry
 the 8. & Queen 
Elizabeth.

They let you see the Church, the 
Libra∣ry,

the 
Refectory,
 the Religious 
Cells,
 the

Kitchen,
 (which is the best I have seen
in 
France
 after that of the 
Jesuits
 at 
L
-Flesch,
)
and lastly the 
Cellers,
 which are
well enough furnished, but nothing so
well as those at 
Naples
 of the same 
Order.

If any Gentleman be desirous to see the
General, and speake with him, it will be
granted him, and he will find him very
Civil. All this being done you Break∣fast,
the Prefect waits upon you to the
Gate, where your Horses attend you, and
your Arms are delivered you, & so leave∣ing
a little Drink-Money to the Ser∣van
s,
(about a Crown a Head for Gentle∣men,)
you take leave and returne a∣gain
to 
Granoble.
 I must only add that


all this Hill over there is excellent
Herbarizing.


From 
Granoble
 to 
Lions,
 you have a
Matter of 15 leagues, in which there is
little considerable.


From 
Chamberrie
 to 
Lions
 there is 16
leagues, but nothing considerable up∣on
the way; save only that within 2 Miles
of 
Chamberrie
 you have only the 
Ga∣belette

to pass, which is a very steep and
high Mountain in several parts precipici∣ous,
especiallie on the 
Savoy
 side, yet you
mount that side on your own Horses, and
must carrie along with you from 
Cham∣berrie

Porters to carrie you down the
Hill, on the 
French
 side. I think you will
pay but half a Crown for your two
Porters, and you will find them as dex∣terous
in their Trade, as those of 
Mount
Ceni's.


Some that have a mind to see 
Geneva

pass the 
Alps,
 either by the 
Mount Sam∣pion

or the Mount St. 
Bernard,
 and so
from 
Geneva
 either go straight to 
Lio
s,

which is a Matter of 26 Leagues, or else
from 
Geneva
 go to 
Chamberrie,
 which is


12 Leagues, and from thence to 
Montme∣lian,

the 
Grand Charterhouse,
 and so pass
by 
Granoble
 to 
Lions.
 This is all that
occurs to my Memorie at present, con∣cerning
this Journey.


In truth I am very sensible that it might
have been much more accurat, had I
been so diligent as to write of it in the
time I made the Journey, when all things
were fresh in my Memorie. But that
occasion being lost; 
I
 had no more left
me, but to Recol
ect my Thoughts as care∣fully
as I could to satisfie your desire, & the
rather because I am hopefull, it will provoke
you to make a more diligent Inquiry af∣ter
all things, and to set them down
Orderly, without trusting your Memo∣rie.
This 
I
 conjure you to do; and
assure your self, it is one of the greatest
things 
I
 will expect from you at your re∣turn.

I
 confess, 
I
 have been some∣what
prolix in my narration, but, if you
consider the vastness and Fertilitie of the
Subject, you will find few Towns in 
Italy,

of which there might not have been more
said than I have said of them all; & this you


will easily find to be true if you please to
make a Collection of those Books that are
writen of the Antiquities, and Curiosi∣ties,
of each of them: For there is scarce∣lie
any Town in 
Italy,
 where, you may
not find such Books. However such as
it is I offer it you, and wish it were
better for your sake, for whole service it
was only undertaken; aud if it prove
acceptable and usefull to you, I have
my designe. I shall o
lie add that it had
been sent you much sooner, had not the
Necessitie of an Extraordinarie atten∣dance
upon this 
Winter-Session,
 so often
withdrawn me, together with the other
Duties of my Profession, which I was Ob∣liged
to perform.


Postscript.




A List of those Things, which I desire
The Laird of LEVINGSTONE to
procure for me in Italy.


1. All the new Books of 
Physick, Botany,

and that any way relate to the Historie
of Nature, that have been printed since


the 64. and of Old Books, 
Aldrovandi's

works at 
Bolognia,
 together with any o∣ther
he can meet with, that was contained
in the first List I gave him when
he parted from hence, as also at 
Rome
 I
desire him to buy me a Book in 
Taildouce,

containing all the Antiquities, 
Palaces
Statues, Churches, Villa's, Fountains, Py∣ramids

&c. in 
Rome.
 I would have it
of the best, largest and finest Impression;
and if you cannot get them so in one
Book, I would have you take them in se∣verall
Fashions as you can best find them:
You may inquire 
appresso Giacomo di Rossi
a la Pace in Roma.
 Also 
Caroli Avantij,
Paraleipomena Botanica,
 if it be to be
had, for I never saw it, onlie he pro∣miseth
it in his 
Notes
 in 
Caenam Baptiste
Fiera
 4. 
Patav
 1649.


2. At 
Florence
 I desire that you would
remember to procure me a small Parcel of
all the Varieties of Stones you can come by.
The readie way will be to inquire for them
at the Stone Cutters in the great Dukes
Chapel at St. 
Laurence
 Church, or else
at the Work-men that work in Stone for


Cabinets at the Dukes Gallerie. But a∣bove
all, of these two kinds of Stone that
are most comon at 
Florence;
 whereof the
one Represents Trees, and Forrests; the
other, Towns and Villages: I would have
of each two or three large handsome
choise Peeces, fitt to be put in Frames. I
would likeways have of those peeces of 
Cri∣stal

that are extraordinarie for Colour,
or otherwayes that have any Substance,
contained within them; as water, &c. you
may possibly find such, either at 
Florence

or 
Millan,
 or it may be 
Venice
 or any o∣ther
where. There is likeways a Stone cal∣led

Lapis Fungiferus;
 It is a Stone that
being placed in the Ground produces large
Mushroms; I had one of them given me
at 
Rome,
 but unhappily lost it at 
London.

To the best of my Memorie, they are com∣monly
found about 
Praenestae,
 commonly
called 
Palestrina.
 Some honest Virtuoso, &
particularlie 
Padre Barilieri alla Minerva
in Roma,
 will tell you where they may be
got; I have likeways heard that they
were in many places of the Kingdom of

Naples.



3. I humbly desire likeways some parcel
of 
Antieails,
 some
three or 4 of the 
An∣tiche
Lucerne
 of the best fashioned and best
preserved. In my time there was 2 or 3
in the 
Piazza navona,
 that sold such things,
and particularly an Old Man, whose
Name I have forgot, that had whole Ca∣binets
full of 
Intalio
's and 
Medales.
 I
desire likeways some 
Intalio
's that be tru∣ly

Antique:
 the excellencie of the Impression,
and the deepness of it commends them, e∣speciallie
if they be well preserved, & neither
the Stone nor impression spoiled. I would
likeways have some 
Brass-Medals
 of the 
1st.

or second 
Magnitude,
 that be well preser∣ved.
There are many things that com∣mend

Medals
 to be good, particularly, 1.
to be Antique and not Counterfeit. 2. To
be well preserved, 
3ly.
 to have a good Re∣verse;
& it is to be observed, that the dif∣ferences
of reverses make different Me∣dals,
altho' they be of the same Emperour,
or Consul, and of the same 
Magnitude,
 and
it is likeways to be observed that those Em∣perours
who Reigned longest had the great∣est
Varietie of Medals; As for Reverses, the


best are such as are least common; as for
example 
a Charriot, a Triumphal Arch, a Tro∣phie
of Warr, a Man or a Womans Head
for the Reverse, two Faces on one side, a
Galey, the Instruments of Sacrifice, an Am∣phitheatre,
a Mousolium, an Elephant, a
Lion, a Dolphin,
 and many more such that
I cannot remember of; as also a Reverse
charged with many Figures, can never be
ill, nor one that relates any known Hi∣storie,
as one that I have of 
Titus Vespasian

with a Palm
Tree, a Slave sitting at the
foot of it, with this Word, 
Judea capta

for the Reverse thereof. But 
I
 doubt mine
is only a Copie, and not truly Antique. 
I

would likeways have a few 
Chamaeo
's pro∣viding
they be not dear; that which
commends them is to have the Figures
well done, and to be well preserved. The
Pretiousnes of the Stone doth likeways con∣tribute
much to their Value. In all there,
that is, 
Medales, Intaglias, Chameo
's, 
I

would be content that ye did bestow 4 or
5 Pistolls for me, which tho' 
I
 confess it
be a very small Summ; yet you may chance
to make a better purchase for it at 
Rome



than any where else for a farr bigger.
Lastly, to conclude this Article, 
I
 would
fain have some of the Ancient Glass, which
through time looks now as it were Opal;
Nothing will commend it so much as to
find an intire vase or 
Phiol,
 for example a

Lachrimatory,
 such as the Ancients used to
cape their own or their Friends Tears in.


4ly.
 There is the Face of a Hill near to

Rome,
 as 
I
 remember, it is at the End of
the 
Janicular,
 not farr from 
Cardinal Fran∣cis
Barherin's Villa,
 that is full of Shells of
all sorts 
Petrified,
 or if ye please to call
them Stones, resembling all the Species of
Shells. By what means they came there,

I
 leave you to find out▪ only 
I
 would fain
have you to make good Provision of all the
Varieties of them, and these as intire as you
can get them.


5ly.
 At 
Naples I
 would desire you to
buy me a couple of black Sashes, Net-work
such as they use. 
I
 think the best use to
cost 3 or 4 Crowns a Peece, and 
I
 would
have the best. 
I
 would likeways have you
to buy me at 
Luca,
 or at 
Florence, I
 think
you may do it in either, two of the largest


quilted Silk Stomagers, or Breast-Plates,
such as people use to wear there in Win∣ter
time. And at 
Rome
 I intreat you to
buy me a Dossen a pair of Gloves, 
Concia
di Roma,
 not exceeding a 
Testone,
 or 4

Julio's
 a pair: and at 
Venice
 two 
pound,

of the best Old 
Theriae.
 At 
Bolognia
 a
Dossen or two of 
Soap-Balls.


6ly.
 All the Natural Curiosities that you
can meet with, with your conveniencie of

Fowls, Fish, Insects
 or other 
Animals,
 the
manner of Ordering, of which I have
written to you formerly. I confess these
you sent me from 
Paris
 were the best or∣dered
I ever saw; but besides that it is too
Expensive, you will not allways meet with
the Oportunity, of having them so order∣ed;
therefore it will be sufficient, if the
Skins (being carefully taken of, and stuffed
with 
Flax,
 or 
Cotten
) be so preserved: But
for the smaller sort of 
Insects,
 their whole
Bodies will easily preserve; the Guts being
first taken out. Of this kind I would
have these 
viz.
 a 
Viper
 or two both the
kinds of 
Tarantula, viz.
 the 
Stellio,
 which
is a kind of 
Lizard
 Curiously, Spotted, but


accounted 
Poysonous;
 and the other true
one, which is shaped like a 
Spider:
 and
what others you think fitt.


7ly.
 Be pleased to make me some pur∣chase
of Outlandish Curiosities, especially,
such as are from the 
Levant,
 of whatso∣ever
Sort that you can meet with. Buy
me at 
Venice,
 a 
Stilletto,
 and a pair of 
Ar∣menian
Shoos,
 shod with Iron on the heels,
such as they use to wear undermost.




For the rest I refer you to the 
Itinerary,

and shall earnestly intreat you to do me
the Favour to Remember all my desires, as
farr as may Stand with your Convenience,
for further I should be very sorry to
trouble you. I do likeways with much
Earnestness Recommend to you those Par∣ticulars,
concerning my self, mentioned in
such Places of the 
French Itinerary
 (which
I sent you last Year) as you have not yet
seen. Thus, once again wishing you all
happiness,


I Remaine Your 
&c.
