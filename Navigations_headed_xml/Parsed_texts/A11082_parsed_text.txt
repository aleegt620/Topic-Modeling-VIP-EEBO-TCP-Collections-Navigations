I
T is the custome of most, to im∣pose a patronage of their errours upon some eminent person. But it shall bee my ambition in this my Dedication to manifest my observancie. Others make their choice of potent men, thereby to shun the darts of envy. It shall bee my glory to be thought worthy of invidency; whose ignorance is not so great but well


knowes that ever some will bite in secret; & scourge these errours of my youth with pri∣vate reproaches. But such malignant tongues I will counterpoise with the winde; and set as lightly by as they are vaine. And although I am confidently perswaded that the covert of your wings bee sufficiently able to shelter my faults; yet had I rather to expresse my du∣tie towards you in these naked infirmities, whose goodnesse truely knowes how 
 to pardon the bold adventures of learning. I present you therefore with ATHENS, whose deplorable raggednesse my papers well re∣semble▪ which may challenge this excuse, that they assimulate themselues to the Trea∣tise in them contained. Which of all men, I my selfe am conscious most unfitly to haue handled. That Citie once the 
 nurse of rea∣son; 
 which flourisht in eloquence, & braue atchieuements more then all 
Greece,
 could not, unlesse in her miserable ruines, haue without her disgrace beene spoken of by me. That ATHENS whence the learned Fathers of the Church suckt rare literature,

Your VVorships in all humility to be commanded F. ROVS.








To the Reader.


IT is not a thirst of empty glory that makes me runne hazard of your censure, but a consideration of the weaknesse of School▪ masters, who undertake to read the Greek Orators to raw Schollers, themselves being not ripe in the 
Attick
 customes. 
I
 have therefore so far endeavoured as you see. If any thing may afford a scru∣ple to any, he shall engage me that will require satisfacti∣on. If any thing seem amisse, it shall be taken by me as a favour to hear of it from any. For I am not of those whose eares are stopt, when their errors are told them. If this please it shall adde spurres to the finishing of this course intended; and as occasion may give leave, you shall have the rest that may be spoken.

B
Y the sonnes of 
Noah
 
 were the Iles of the Gentiles divided in their lands, every one after his tongue; when by their audacious fol∣ly they would haue mounted vp to heaven, thinking to leaue a name to posterity, by buil∣ding Castles in the ayre. From which attempt proceeded that which before they were jealous of, namely a scattering abroad vpon the face of the earth; hee hauing so spoken it, whose breath alone affords a faire winde: hoyst then they must their Sailes, and bidding adieu to the plaine in the land of 
Shenar,
 seeke out some new habitation. Travel∣lers they were of yore, and yet still must iourney. Each one in as differenta course, as of a divers language. The sonnes of 
Shem
 their way, the sonnes of 
Iaphet,
 theirs. 
Gomer
 and 
Ma∣gog,
 and 
Madai
 and 
Iavan,
 with whom I purpose one furlong


to keepe companie, leauing the rest on one side or other or behinde, looking only to my proposed scope. 
 
. From 
Iavan came Ionia and all the Greekes.
 And in Scripture we haue 
Iavan
 put for 
Greece;
 in 
Daniel
 twice, 
 
And when I am gone forth, loe the Prince of Grecia shall come.
 And againe, 
 
Hee shall stirre vp all against the Realme of Grecia.
 Where although the old translation ren∣ders it not 
Iavan,
 yet it is so found in the originall. Hee then comming into the country called afterwards 
Attica,
 left vn∣to it his owne name, whence it was tearmed 
Ionia
 and 
Ias.
 
. 
For Attica was anci∣ently
 
called Ionia and Ias.
 In which words wee still retaine some reliques of the radix, notwithstanding the small diffe∣rence of the termination. But if wee please to view after what title the 
sonnes of Iavan
 were stiled 
Iaones
 wee shall come neerer home. 
Strabo
 in the aboue quoted place, 
. 
Homer
 when he saies, 
There the Boeotians and Iaones
 speakes of the 
Athenians.
 The 
Scholiast
 of 
Aeschylus
 on these words,


 
▪ 
It is to be vnderstood,
 quoth hee, 
that the Athenians are tearmed Iaones, from one Iaon
 (hee meanes 
Iavan
) 
that was their king.
 Neither is it strange that the 
vau
 or▪ 
 is left out; for though it be not written, yet perswaded I am that it was as much pronounced, as other 
au
 Diphthongs were. For the 
 antique Latines and the Greeks spake it as broad 
a,
 as if it had been 
the saros
 not 
the sauros.
 S
r
 
Walter Raleigh
 is of opi∣nion 
that Asia the lesse had people before Greece had any, and that Iavan did not fly from Babylonia into Greece, but took Asia the lesse in his passage, and from thence past over the neerest way, leaving his owne name to some maritimate province on that side as he did to that part so called.
 In which, although the authori∣ty of so worthy and iudicious a man might move much, yet it shall be sufficient for me, onely to goe so farre, as antiquitie


will beare me out. 
 
Thucydides
 reports that it is manifest, that all Greece was not 
, firmely inhabited, but that there were continuall pilgrimages, or remouings of the inhabitants, forsaking their former places, being driuen out by a stronger and greater number. Wherefore when there was no safe traffique or commerce by sea or land, each manu∣red his grounds for to haue provent, alone to serue for pre∣sent necessity, desiring no more then from hand to mouth; it being vncertaine, how soone they might be compelled to get them thence. Whereupon they did more willingly change their seats; not taking grieuous that sharp charge, 
veteres mi∣grate coloni. Be gone you ancient Boores.
 But the more fertill soyle had hard bickrings. 
Thessalie, Boeotia,
 and a great part of 
Peloponnesus,
 except 
Arcadia,
 was often invaded, and the old Lords expelled. 
.
 
But Attica, by reason of the thinnesse or barrennesse of the ground, was alwaies inhabi∣ted by the same men
 (none it seemes being willing to leaue his better, for a worse) 
not affording fuell to contention.
 Out of which peace sprung vp so great a multitude, that 
Attica,
 even now swarming, and 
, 
not able to containe and feed so many,
 is constrained to send forth 
Colonies
 into 
Ionia,
 a region of 
Asia
 the lesse, which is reported by the 
Greekes
 to borrow denomination from 
Ion
 the sonne of 
Xuthus,
 or, as the Poets say, 
Apollo
 and 
Creusa,
 who in the words of 
Euripides
 is thought to be 
 
, 
the maker or founder of Asia.
 The mother 
Ionia
 (for so I please to say) kept not still her former name, For in processe of time shee owned 
Actaea;
 from 
Actaeon,
 as 
 
Strabo
 sayes, or from 
Actaeus,
 accor∣ding to 
 
Pausanias,
 who was the first king thereof, by 
 
Tzet∣zes on Lycophron
 called 
Acteus.
 But 
 
Dion Chrysostom
 brings a more naturall reason then this, why it was 
Actaea, Acta
 signifies a 
shore,
 both in the 
Greeke
 and 
 
Latine
 speech. Now because all of it within a little was washed with the sea, and 
 
, it might challenge vnto it selfe 
Actaea. Dion




. Hence 
 by the 
Aenigmatical Poet
 in his 
 
Cassandra
 is put for this country. 
Tzetzes. Because it is (Acta) a cliffe, that is cast forth and lying in the sea.
 And 
Athens
 her selfe by 
Plautus
 is said 
Athenae in acta, pro Athe∣nis Atticis,
 as 
 
Palmerius
 hath noted. But this grew old after a season and 
Cecrops
 having married the daughter of 
Actaeus
 glories in his 
Cecropia
 (and Athens 
Cecropiae,
 and 
Cecropis ci∣vitas,
 and after that 
Cranaae
 from 
Cranaus
 the king that suc∣ceeded him) This 
Cranaus
 among other of his daughters had one 
 
Atthis,
 from whom also was derived 
Atthis
 and 
Attica,
 next 
Posidonia
 and 
Minervia,
 from 
Neptune
 and 
Pallas.
 In this region stood 
At
ens, Queene of Greece,
 so called, from that victory which 
Minerva
 got over 
Neptune,
 when 
Ce∣crops
 moved▪ with a prodigie of a sudden shooting up of an
 Oliue, and bubling forth of a salt spring in the 
Acropolis,
 con∣sulted the Oracle of 
Apollo,
 who taught them that the one did signifie 
Neptune,
 the other 
Minerva,
 taking therefore the men into suffrages for 
Neptune,
 and the women for 
Minerva,
 who had most voices should carry it. The females being more the Goddesse bore away the bell. Lo here a witty Divell to bring in 
, Gods of his owne making, to infold the superstitious in an ignorant zeale. How ever let vs leaue the shadow of poëticall fictions, and take the true draught out of 
Mythologie. Plutarch
 is of opinion that the ancient kings striuing to draw away their subiects from sea faring negotiati∣ons, and a desire to liue by sayling, vnto tillage and manuring of ground, gaue occasion of the speech that 
Neptune
 and 
Mi∣nerva
 did alter cate about the citie. 
. &c. 
Neptune
 is
 put for the Sea and businesses thereof. 
Minerva
 for Arts and ingenuous kinde of life, nay saies 
Ovid
 in his Kalender. 
Mille Dea est operum
 shee is Goddesse of a thousand trades. Others say that the Citie was consecrated to her by 
Amphictyon, & nomen civitati Athenas dedit.
 
 
Iustine.
 Others in the time of 
Erecttheus,
 among which is 
Herodotus,
 will haue this name


giuen. Which Author 
 
Marcianus Heracleota
 doth follow, 
. This was that 
Erectheus,
 who in a time of drougth over all the world except 
Aegypt,
 brought co
ne to 
Athens,
 and taught the 
Eleusinian mysteries.
 Beholding this Citie hath beene to 
Aegypt
 for other kings; to wit, 
 
Cecrops
 and 
Menestheus,
 for his father 
Petes
 was an 
Aegyptian.
 In the time of 
Diodorus Siculus
 and before him was it a recei∣ved opinion that 
Athens
 was peopled by the 
Aegyptians, Sais
 in that tongue answering to 
Athene
 in 
Greeke,
 as 
Tzetzes
 out of 
Carax.
 Nay that they should bee of the inhabitants of 
Sais,
 they argue from this. Because that the 
Saitae
 and 
Athe∣nians
 haue divers customes alike. Witnesse 
Diodorus Siculus.
 But it pleases not me. I coniecture that first it was called 
A∣thens,
 when the people began more seriously to addict them∣selues to civill goverment, and studie of good literature; knowledge and art being ascribed to 
Minerva.
 
. saies 
 
Aristotle.
 Nay her name being deriued from thence, 
 
thena
 in the 
Chaldy
 tongue signifying to 
studie
 or 
learne:

 and with an article

 as 
 
Heinsius
 the most learned. As for the conceit of 
Goropius Becan,
 from 
ana
 the number of three which notes eternity, and so from 
hat-het-ana. 
Athena.
 Because wisedome doth containe eternity, let vs send it back into 
Germanie.
 Loe now 
Athens
 named from learning, which was once the 
 
shop of letters
 and the Muses, whereof it is now deplorably destitute, hauing lost the glory of former 
Athens,
 nay the name it selfe. For if wee beleeue some they tell vs, that now it is 
Salenos
 or 
Selines.
 To whom I accord not. Be∣cause that I haue read 
Selines
 for 
Megara
 called 
Nisaea,
 which is not many miles from 
Athens.
 Furthermore in discourse with a natiue of 
Peloponnesus,
 who liued many yeares in that City, I had no other appellation from him then 
Ateene,
 which others write 
Satina
 corrupted as 
Portus
 and 
Meursius
 truly thinke for 
. Nay 
 
Hugo Favolius
 who was there


himselfe even to the same purpose names it 
Sethina.




Vndi{que} sic miserae nobis spectantur Athenae


Daedala quas Pallas sese coluisse negaret,


Quas, Neptune pater, nunquam tua maenia dicas


Indigenae Sethina vocant—






Wee wretched 
Athens
 round doe view, which now,


Though once ingenious Pallas love, 's her shame,


And t'have beene thine,

To which the Homebred give

 is placed in the midst of the whole earth, and in the mid'st of it stands 
Attica;
 the navell whereof is 
Athens,
 by which all 
Greece,
 clo∣seted in the wombe of time, receaved nourishment, be∣fore an happy birth had brought her forth into the light. Shee is seated upon a very high rocke, which habitations doe en∣compasse, as 
 
Strabo:
 on the top of which stands that renow∣ned fabricke even to this day, which 
Cecrops
 from himselfe names 
 
Cecropia;
 of old

Sic Atheni∣enses urbem suam vocabant, unde ipsi incolae

 So, saith he, the 
Athenians
 called their Citty, whence the Citi∣zens themselues are called 
astoi,
 after that they called it 
 
 
Pausanias.
 Which in his time was called 
 or the high City, although it be often interpreted 
Arx
 a castle▪


which ever were sacred to 
Minerva,
 as 
 
Aristides.
 Who therefore is by 
Catullus
 in his 
Argonauticks
 named 
Diva re∣tinens in summis urbibus arces. The Goddesse that keepes the Turrets of Cities.
 This only now remaines, the succour and shelter of the barbarous 
Athenians,
 being strongly furnished with men and armes, in which alone dwell Ianizaries, to the number of seaven hundred thousand, as 
Christophoro Angelo
 told me, and avouched it, I fearing least hee had mistaken the number. As for the forces thereof 
 
Hugo Favolius
 shall thus instruct you,




Arx tantum celebris hoc tempore montis eodem


Quae{que} imposta iugo est, vastas prospectat in undas


Aequoris, & circum dispersa mapali
, & omnes


Externo indigenas nocuo tutatur ab hoste,


Nobilis arx, toto qua non est altera Graio


Nota magis regno, validis{que} instructior armis,


Ignivomo{que} magis tormentorum impete tuta.






A Castle only famous at this day,


Set on an hill, below which viewes the sea.


The scattered thatcht sheds, that stand it about▪


The fort defends, and keeps invasion out▪


And natiues safe. A fort; none noted more


In Greece, which hath a better warlike store,


Or it for fiery Canons goes before.




Vpon the toppe of this Turret stand the fashions of Halfe Moones most rarely gilded, after the manner of the 
Ishmae∣lites,
 who haue the Moone in no small honour, as my much ho∣noured M
r
 
 
Selden
 hath obserued. Of which Lunulets thus speakes 
Favolius,




Cuius inauratis longe rutilantia Lunis


Ardua coelivagas feriunt fastigia nubes.






Whose tops with gilded Moones aspiring high,


Doe knock the Clouds the pilgrims of the skie.




Neither may it passe obscurely which I haue taken up being let fall from the mouth of an eye witnesse; namely that on the


side of this hill, on which the 
Acropolis
 is built, growes a certaine kinde of herbe, that farre off, in the night season, giues a most shining and glittering light, to which when a man shall approach, he shall discerne nothing but the herbe it selfe. Of which matter I seriously wish that I could testify the truth. It was delivered to me, 
bona fide,
 with good credit. The walls that environ this, are none now, saies 
Favolius,
 but in former time it hath beene well fenced; some part thereof erected by those two 
Tuscan
 brothers, who leaving their country, lived here vnder the 
Acropolis,
 called 
, 
Pe∣largi,
 Storkes, 
, for their wandring, 
 
Strabo,
 
 
Plinie
 sayes their names were 
Euryalus
 and 
Hyperbius.
 The two that first built houses of brick at 
Athens,
 when for∣merly they had Caues for dwelling places. But by the autho∣rity of 
Pausanias,
 though the Printers and Scribes haue done both that Author, and the persons wrong, in putting a false name vpon one of them, I will doe them none. Read then 
Laterarias domus constituerunt primi Agrolas & Hyperbius fratres Athonis,
 &c. 
 
Pansanias.
 
 From these was that part which they edified called 
Pelargi∣cum. Aristophanes in Avibus.




The other part of the 
Acropolis
 which was left naked, 
Cimon
 the sonne of 
Miltiades
 clothed. 
Pausanias
 in the fore quoted place. These walls admitted no gate but one, so rarely beau∣tified with that costly 
Propylaeum
 or porch, on which 
Pericles
 is discommended by 
 
Demetrius Phalareus
 for disbursing so great a summe of money. 
 For which hee was not finally troubled how hee might giue vp his accounts to the people; His Nephew 
Alcibiades
 therefore seeing him somewhat sad, and demanding the cause, to whom when his vnkle replied, that it was about giving his accounts, seeke rather, quoth he, how you may not giue them. By which counsell the 
Atheni∣ans
 were entangled with that neighbour warre against the 
Lacedemonians,
 in which they found not vacancy for an audit.


By the way it shall be fit to acquaint you with thus much, that it was not permitted to a dog to enter into the 
Acropolis,
 as 
 
Plutarch,
 
 it may be, for his heat in venerie and ill savour. Goats likewise, saies 
 
Varro,
 came not thither, unlesse for a necessary sacrifice once, least they should hurt the 
Oliue
 which is said first to haue sprung up there. The circuit of this 
Acropolis
 is said to bee threescore stadia. Now a 
Stadium
 is about some 
 six hundred and twen∣tie fiue feet, eight of which make a mile, it being the custome of the ancient Greekes, so to measure the length or distance of grounds, or Cities, by the 
. The first City then is con∣tained in seaven miles and an halfe. But to this were added more houses able to make a City of themselues. And so in∣deed were they distinguished by 
 & 
, The up∣per and the lower City. 
 
Plutarch,
 
. Note here moreover, in the reading of your 
Greeke
 Authors, that when you meet with 
 in the description of a country, you presently must conceaue the higher part, if it be 
 
 
Thucydides.
 
 
And they prayed upon each other, and among the rest who were not addicted to the sea, yet liued below,
 understand neare the sea, 
Schol.
 
. The 
 then & 
 knit together made but one ioynt corporation; both, as it were uniting 
Piraeum
 unto themselues, tooke up, as 
 
Di∣on Chrysostom
 writes, two hundred 
stadia,
 which is about fiue and twentie miles. Vpon which place, 
Morellus
 produces a 
Scholiast
 testifying that the wals were 
 fifteene miles saue one furlong. Where I wonder that the learned man had not e
tsoone perceived the number to haue beene corrupt, and written 
 for 
, twentie fiue for fifteene. For so it ought to be. Neither is it strange that it had so large bounds. For consider that from 
Piraeum
 to 
Athens
 were reckoned fiue miles, as you may see in 
 
Plinie,
 From 
Athens
 to 
Phalerum,
 and so to the other side of 
Piraeum
 foure miles


and a quarter. The utmost wall of which 
Thucydides
 speakes in his second book consisted of fiue miles a quarter and halfe. The girdle of 
Piraeum
 and 
Munychia
 had seven miles and an halfe more. All which being put together make up but twen∣tie two miles one quarter and one furlong. But 
Dion Chryso∣stom
 must be here understood; and it behoves us to conceiue that he spake not barely of the naked walls, for then it cannot hold; but I suppose some houses to haue beene without 
 
 as he saies, 
 In which I appeale to more judicious heads. Neither can I silently passe by the opinion of 
Iohn Meursius,
 who reading in 
 
Pausanias
 these words 
, should presently obtrude to us, that 
Pausanias
 teaches, that the 
 wall called 
Phalericus
 is but twentie 
stadia
 or two mile and an halfe. When indeed he meant nothing lesse. For speaking of salt springs, which he calls 
, he seemes to involue a reason drawne from the neerenesse of the sea. For when he writes of this brackish well, 
Among the Athenians, the sea which comes up neere Phalerus is distant from the City but twentie stadia at the most,
 quoth he. Where 
Amasaeus
 hath thus strangely do
ed. 
Athenae à Phalero absunt stadia haud am∣plius xx.
 And that this was the meaning of the Author, proues that which followes. He might haue likewise consi∣sidered that 
 with a Dative case signifies not onely 
juxt a
 and 
prope
 as I haue translated it; but 
supra
 sometimes, which will now serue better. And 
Meursius
 indeed blames the number; but sees not into the words. Now it is not needlesse that the two walls, which joynes 
Piraeum
 and 
Athens
 at so long a distance, be somewhat spoken of, seeing they are rec∣koned by 
 
Livie
 among the 
multa visenda,
 Many things wor∣thy of sight at 
Athens.
 These are the

Properti∣us,—Theseae brachia longa viae.
 
 
Appian
 of 
Alexandria,
 
, and 
 
Plutarch
 in 
Cimone.
 One lying towardes the North, of which 
 
Plutarch.
 The other towards the South,


in height about forty Cubits, as 
 
Appian
 testifies. These are called 
 by 
 
Dion Chrysostom,
 because 
Athens
 being at one end, and 
Piraeum
 at the other, these were drawn forth betweene. And when writers speake of 
, it may be conjectured that it is for distinction of that 
 in the 
Acropolis
 which 
Cimon
 built, 
 witnesse 
Pausanias. Aristophanes
 seemes to bring authoritie for an opi∣nion that 
Themistocles
 built these. 
In
 
 
Equitibus.


.


Which his 
 Scholiast affirmes. 
. 
For Themistocles added Piraeum to the City.
 We read in 
 
Probus
 that he was the only agent in walling the Ci∣ty, and that he so hastned the accomplishing, that they were faine to be as it were sacrilegious, and make use of materials formerly consecrated to the edifying of Temples, and Monu∣ments of the dead. But 
 
Plutarch
 gaine-saies this, and that he did onely 
, 
 conjoyne the City and 
Pireum,
 and put the land to take acquaintance with the sea. It seemes somewhat forward be∣fore. How ever, so fennie was the ground it was founded up∣on, that the worke soone came to great reparation, which 
 
Cimon
 the sonne of 
Miltiades
 undertooke. For with stones of an huge weight and lime he made the earth so firme that it could not giue. Nay he was so liberall, that he did out of his owne expences so great favours, to a people that some yeares after gratified him with exile. Neither did he only mend the breaches; but in after time 
 finished the whole worke, so that he may truly be said to be the founder of them. Let us now come to the Gates of the City. 
 
Meursius
 hath obser∣ved tenne, but I feare they will scarce suffice to such a vast City. Take then these. 
Dipylon
 or 
Thriasia,
 the fairest of all, 
velut in ore urbis posita,
 placed as it were in the front of the City, sayes 
Livie maior aliquanto patentior{que} quam caeterae est,
 greater somewhat and wider then the rest. Hence I suppose named 
Dipylon
 as if it were as big as two gates.

THE 
Athenians
 by 
 
Dicaearchus
 are divided into two sorts, 
, 
Atticos,
 and 
. Of which though there were no difference in latter times, yet certainly of old there was. In somuch as one of the punishments, which the 
Athenians
 are said to inflict upon their women (for the ap∣peasing of 
Neptune,
 bringing in an inundation upon their fields to their great dammage, in anger conceived for losse of the Title of the City) was this, 
 That none should after call them 
, 
Athenians,
 but 
, 
Atticas.
 A revenge I suppose opprobrious enough. For thus writes my Author. O
 
. 
Curious bablers, Deceitfull, Calumniators, Observers of the liues of strangers.
 
. A sufficient wit∣nesse of this is 
 S
t
 
Luke,
 that faies, they did regard nothing more then to heare and speake noveltie. To which end they often met in Barbers shops, where all the newes, that was go∣ing in those daies, was currant. Hence say we, 
verba in ton∣strinis proculcata:
 and in Greek 
, 
 
Aristo∣phanes.








.




They that sate in the Barbers shops did talke much that hee was suddenly growne rich. The Scholiast seemes to take the meaning as if the Comaedian had quipped them for resorting to Barbers, and neglecting Barber▪ Chirurgions of better cre∣dit. But I see no reason. They met in both to prattle. 
Aelian
 




. Sitting in a Chirurgions shop, scandalous, and thir∣stie to speake ill by all meanes. 
. men Italianated, who can smile, even when they cut your throat. Such as 
Theophra∣stus
 hath in his Characters drawne out, who can be affable to their enimies, and disguise their hatred in commendation, while they privily lay their snares; that salute with mortall embracements; and 
lasp you in those armes, which they meane to embrew in your dearest blood. In summe, faire without, but rotten within, like a wound which is healed a∣boue and seemes sound, but putrifies under the skin. And so much the word doth import. 
. Given to false ac∣cusations. The 
 Scholiast of 
Aristophanes
 writes, that it be∣ing forbidden to carry figges out of 
Athens,
 and some never∣thelesse the decree being absolute against it, presuming so to doe, they set rogues in the gates that did appeach them, (as 
 
Plutarch
 likewise) Hence came this word to bee used for any crafty knaue that gets his living by promooting, 
 
. One that meddles in every mans affayres, and therefore 
 
Aristophanes
 hath fitly brought one upon the seene terming himselfe an 
Overseer
 both of private and pub∣like matters. If then such a person had espied any tripping, and gotten him on the hip, hee would as sure haue fetched him over for his coyne, as any 
Summoner
 doth a person delin∣quent towards the flesh, or any Lawyer a credulous client, and having well plumed him, afterwards giue him a dimissorie. 
 (

. 
Xenophon.
 Such were many in 
Athens,
 in somuch that 
Aristotle
 being asked what 
Athens
 was, answered,

, in a verse of 
 
Ho∣mer
 in the description of 
Al
inous
 his garden, but peares grew ripe after peares, and figges after figges, meaning a continuall succession of Sycophants. This made 
Isocrates
 the Oratour to compare the City to a Curtezan, with whom few there were but would haue to doe, yet none dare take to wife; affirming it to be the best place to soiourne in, but the worst to inhabit:


By reason of their Sycophants and trecheries of nimble ton∣gued Oratours. 
. I was once halfe in an opinion that these words were to haue beene put to the former thus,

Plutarch
 speakes▪ 
people rashly angry, soone pittifull, rather in∣clined sharply to take opinion, then quietly to be enformed. And as they are ready to helpe base and abiect peasants, so friendly do they entertaine childish and ridiculous toyes, reioycing in their owne praises, & nothing moved with scurrility, Fearefull and terrible even to their governors, humane towards their enimies.
 Not unfitly then 
 
Valerius Maximus, Quantam ergo repre∣hensionem merentur, &c.
 How deserue they to bee blamed, who though they had iust lawes, yet had most wicked disposi∣tion, and chose rather to take their owne courses, then put in practise their statutes? As for their impudence, so great was it, that to expresse a countenance void of shame, the Comoe∣dian hath put

CAP. IV.
 




De populidivisione, 
. Quid Atheniensibus cum Ae∣gypt
is commune.




THere were at first but two kindes of people in 
Athens,
 
 two orders 
quibus inter gradus dignitatis fortunae{que} ali∣quid inter lucebat,
 in which there was difference of dignity & fortune: such as at this day are in 
France
 either Peeres or Pea∣sants, or as in 
Venice
 Patricians and Plebeians. And although 
Pollux
 calls them 
, three sorts, yet I make but two, be∣cause the 
 were not any way more gentile for blood, surpassing for riches, or happy for life. But because he hath so set them, take them thus, as he speakes. 
 
, 
Eupatridae,
 were such as were descended from the loynes of those 
Heroes
 famous in the Greek history, whose families were ever renowned, and posterity propagated to many generations; such as 
Praxiergi∣dae, Eteobutadae. Al
moeonidae, Cynidae, Ceryces. &c.
 whom we may tearme Nobles, or men of good birth. 
, 
Geomori,
 may not seeme unlike our Yeomen, who had lands of their owne and sustained themselues with the fruit and commodi∣ty of these their possessions. 
, 
Demiurgi,
 were men of some handi-craft, Tradesmen, such as Tentmakers, Shoema∣kers Carpenters, Masons, and the like. But 
Solon
 made ano∣ther division. For when the 
Diacrii,
 which were those that lived in the upper part of the Citie, 
, saies 
Diogenes
 
Laertius;
 and the 
Pediaei
 which likewise are 
, such as li∣ved in the middle of the Citie, or the plaine. And the 
Paralii
 who lived neere the sea, were at contention about govern∣ment. The 
Diacrii
 leaning to a Democratie, as 
 
Plutarch
 writes▪ the 
Pediaei
 to an Oligarchie, and the 
Paralii
 between both, and had chosen 
Solon
 to arbitrate and determine the


matter; he made these foure rankes. 
, 
Pentacosiomedimnos▪ Equites. Ze
gitas. Thet
s.
 
Pentacosiomedimni
 were those who 
, could make fiue hundred measures in wet, and drie commo∣dities alike. What 
Possardus
 then brings out of 
Uarro
 con∣cerning 
modium,
 hath no place here, for he supposes that 
Pen∣tacosiomedimnus
 was he that had as much ground as fifty 
Me∣di
ni
 could suffice to sow, but here I will confute him with a wet finger. 
. For he seemes to sow upon the waters. This is he whom the 
Elzevirii
 printed at 
Leyden Anno
 1635 under the name of 
Postellus
 who was sometime a Professor of Tongues in 
France,
 and author of the Treatise 
de Magistrati∣bus Atheniensium. Equites
 were such as were of abilitie to keep an horse, or had the quantitie of three hundred measures in dry, & as many in wet: called likewise 
 
Zen∣gitae,
 were such as could of wet and dry in all make but three hundred. Any of these three could beare office in the Com∣monwealth. A fourth ranck which he called 
 
, 
Thetas,
 a name from servilitie, which had no power in the rule of the weale publique. But it had not beene amisse if I had shewne how the 
Aegyptians
 had divided their people into three clas∣ses as the 
Athenians
 did, as I haue spoken aboue. For the first degree or 
Eupatridae
 addicted to learning and studie, who were had in greater honour, answer to the 
Aegyptian
 Priests. 
 Nay those great houses in 
Athens
 had Priesthood by successi∣on, as 
Eumolpidae, Ceryces, Cynidae.
 For out of the stocke were chosen Priests hence 
 in 
 
Demosthenes.
 The 
Geomori
 who had lands assigned to them for the maintenance of the warre, are not dislike them in 
Aegypt
 who hold posses∣sions on these tearmes, namely to provide souldiers when need shall require to fight. The 
Demiurgi
 resemble those Plebeians who skilfull in some art, did set out their labour to daily hire: as 
Diodorus Siculus
 can testifie.








CAP. V.




 Tribus quatuor sub Cecrope mutata earum nomina. Augentur à Clisthene: duae additae. 
▪ Tribulum 
.




IN 
Athens
 there were but foure Tribes under the rule of 
Cecrops. Cecropis, Autocthon, Actaea, Paralia;
 which had other names put to them, 
Cranais, Atthis, Mesogaea, Diacris.
 I suppose from the parts of 
Attica,
 it lying partly neere the sea, thence 
Actaea,
 partly hilly, thence 
Diacris,
 partly Medi∣terrane, thence 
Mesogaea,
 the other name from the King that was then; whether the King would honour the Tribe so much, or the Tribe glory in the name of the King, I knowe not. It is probable that it was an honour to their governour, for as 
Cecrops
 gaue the first names, 
Cranaus
 the second, 
each assnming a title to himselfe, Ericthonius
 called them after the name of 
Iupiter, Pallas, Neptune, Vulcan.
 
 But when 
Ion
 came to rule they were named after his foure sonnes, 
Geleontes, Aegicoreis, Argades, Hople∣tes,
 as 
 
Herodotus
 and 
 
Euripides.
 though 
Plutarch
 sayes that they were so called 
 
, from the courses of life which they first tooke. But 
Clisthenes
 a man factious and wealthy is said by the Councell of 
 
Apollo, Alomaeon
 being 
Archon
 to make tenne of them, changing the ancient titles, and taking new from some Demi∣gods or 
Heroes
 borne in that land all, except 
Aiax,
 whom though a stranger, he put to the rest▪ as a neighbour and com∣panion. 
 
Herodotus.
 These then were called 
; as you would say giving names; the word so signifies sometimes, as 
Minerva
 is said by 
Dion Chrysostom
 
, who gaue the name to 
Athens.
 To these were erected Satues nere the Councell place of the Senate. Their names are these as 
 
Pausanias
 hath them. 
Hippothoon, Antiochus, Aiax Telamo∣nius,




Leo, Erectheus
 that slew 
Immaradus
 the sonne of 
Eumol. pu
 in the 
Eleusinian
 war, 
Aegeus, Oeneus, Acamas, Cecrops, Pandion.
 From these 
, 
O
nis,
 
▪ To which they put two more, one called after 
Antigonus,
 the other after 
Demetrius
 his name, in gratuitie to them for the favours receaved; which in processe of time they changed into 
Attalis,
 and 
Ptolemais,
 as 
Stephanus
 writes, 
, having beene curteously entreated by the 
 Kings bearing that name. Which being so, let us take heed that 
Livie
 deceaue us not, who at the time, when 
Attalus
 did succour the 
Athenians
 against 
Philip,
 sayes they first thought of adding that Tribe to the tenne, in thanksgiving that the 
Rhodii
 rescued foure figh∣ting ships of the 
Athenians
 taken by the 
Macedonians,
 and sent them home, 
 
Tum primum mentio illata de tribu quam Attalida appellarent, ad decem veteres tribus addenda.
 Thus haue we seene that there were twelue Tribes in all. Let us look back to the first institution. I suppose they were first or∣dained for the better administration of civill goverment. 
 
Eustathius
 writes that they were divided in imitation of the yeare, The foure Tribes according to the foure quarters; each Tribe into three Fraternities, which they call 
 or 
 answerable to the twelue Moneths, each 
 or 
 into thirtie 
 or kindreds equalising the daies. For so many only had the yeare of old. Witnesse the Ridle of 
 
Cleobulus
 concerning the yeare,






.




One Father had twelue Sonnes, and each sonne thirty daugh∣ters, and every daughter black and white, meaning daies and nights. Over these were governours 
, Kings of the Tribes, who sate upon controversies betweene party and party of their owne Tribes. Each Tertian also had his over∣seer called, 
 the Ruler of the 
Trittys
 or 
Phratria.
 The word may seeme to signifie a Societie, fellowship, or


Company. It skils not whether you deriue it from 
, as 
Eustath,
 or 
, as 
Suidas,
 or 
, as others, which is a Well, because they drew water from the same well. For the place being scanty of Springs where 
Athens
 was founded, there being but one well-spring in 
Athens,
 they were con∣strained touse 
, digged wells, as 
 
Plutarch.
 
 are the men of that societie, called by 
Tully, Curiales,
 of the same Ward, speaking of 
Cimon,
 who gaue command that his servants should afford what they had if any 
Laciades
 should come into his Farme. In description of which thing 
Plutarch
 uses 
, which then wee are not to interpret 
Curialis
 (For this is as much as 
 and 
) but 
popularis.
 These at festivall daies in 
Athens
 met in a place called 
Phratrion,
 as 
 
Eustathius
 obserues, & 
 
Pollux
 (where they brought their children to be engrossed in their books, as shall be hereafter spoken with the reasons thereof) 
, 
Phratrizein
 from hence comes which is 
, to meet, for so 
Eustathius
 in another place 
. As for the 
, or kindreds wee must not think that they were of one blood, but from that neere conjunction which they had each with other being admitted into this societie▪ 
 (every 
 or kindred consisted of thirtie, whence they were named 
) 
. Not of affinity so called, but for their Synod; which the Grammarians call 
, a Communica∣tiue familiarity, 
 being a participating in one thing, or having an equall share in the same priviledges. Great was their care of each other; great was their mutuall loue; which that it might continue, 
Solon
 their Law-giver ordained cer∣taine feasts to be provided, wherein they should kindely en∣tertaine each other. 
, and 
. 
 
Athenaeus.
 
, &c. Of feasts celebrated at this day the Law-makers haue appointed 
Phyletica
 for Tribes, 
Demotica
 for the people or popular,


Moreover 
Thiasos
 for Colledges (as Philosophers for the death of their Grand Masters) and 
Phratrica
 for the same Ward. Hence 
 and 
. Of which in due time. The reason of this the 
Dipnosophist
 giues. saying that wine hath 
, an attractiue and perswading force to procure loue, and friendship.

ALL 
Greece
 was inhabited 
, as

 speakes, by Villages before there were any Townes; from whence comes the word Comoedie. 
 
At verò nondum coactis in urbem Atheniensibus, cum Apollini Nomio, id est, Pastorum vicinorum{que} praesidi Deo, constructis aris in honor

Athenians
 being as yet not gathered into Corporations, when they sung sacred hymnes to 
Apollo Nomius,
 that is, the President of the sheep∣heards and neighbours, about the villages, houses and crosse waies of 
Attica,
 alters being built in honour of the ce∣lebrity, sprung up a Comoedie 
 from revelling and singing. Others will haue it derived from an ancient custome they had, when any were injured among them, for the party wronged to come to the street where the offender lived, and in the night time to cry aloud 
 
. 
Such a one doth wrong, and commits such and such outrages, although there bee Gods and Laws▪
 by which, these abuses were reformed. But the 
Anonymus
 in a preface to 
Aristophanes
 saies 
, that they were not called 
 or villages by the 
Athenians,
 but 
 which they tran∣slate

Atticum. Venio ad Piraeea in quo magis reprehendendus sum, quod homo Romanus Piraeea scripserim, non Piraeeum (fi
 enim omnes nostri locuti sunt) quàm quod M addiderim. Non enim hoc ut oppido praeposui, sed ut loco: & tamen Diony sius no∣ster, qui est nobiscum, & Nicias Cous, non rebatur oppidum esse Piraeea, sed de eo videro. Nostrum quidem si est peccatum, in 
 est, quod non ut de oppido locutus sum, sed ut de loco: secutus{que} sum non dico Caecilium, Mane ut ex portu in Piraeeum (malus enim auctor Latinitatis est) sed Terontium cuius fabellae prop∣ter elegantiam sermonis putabantur à Caio Laelio scribi.
 Heri aliquot adolescentuli coimus in Piraeeum, & idem, Mercator hoc addebat captam de Sunio.

 to bee Townes, 
Sunium
 as well as

CAP. VII.




 
. Atheniensium status mutati
▪ 
.




THe ancients had but three sorts of government. 
Tyran∣nis, Democratia Oligarchia
 as 
 
Aeschines,
 which 
Polybius
 cals 
. where although the one names it a 
Tyrannis
 or Tyranny, the other 
 the rule of a King, yet must we understand the same. For in old time all Kings were called Tyrants, as 
Servi
s
 on 
Virgil
 hath ob∣served. A word taken up by the 
Graecians
 about the time of 
Archilochus,
 which neither 
Homer,
 nor 
Hesiod
 knew; and therefore are the Poets noted, as, 
, for cal∣ling the Kings, or 
 before the 
Troian
 wars, Tyrants or Tyrannos. 
 or a Kingdome, is where obeisance is free, yeelded rather out of a good advice, then for feare or might. 
 an Aristocratie, when most wise and just men are fitly chosen to sit at the▪ Helme of the Weale pub∣like. 
 a Democratie, when the Lawes and cu∣stomes of the Country in matters belonging both to Gods and men are truly observed, and that rules the rost, which shall be approved of by the greater part, 
 
aies 
Polybius;
 as that may be said at a banquet to please all, which doth relish well with the most. But the grave Histo∣rian hath observed changes in such government, as they use to be, inclining to the worst Monarchies being turned into Tyrannies; as when the people are led away by the perswa∣
ions of some pleasing 
 popular man, and are as it were, wil∣lingly constrained to take the yoke that his usurping authori∣ty shall lay on them, a Tyrant indeed said, 
 
Vicons
tus,
 who gets it by violence,
 
Omnes autem & habentur & dicun∣tur Tyranni, qui potestate sunt perpetua in ca civitate, quae la∣bertate




usa est.
 But all are accounted and called Tyrants, who haue perpetuall authority in that Citie, which formerly hath enioyed liberty. The deprivation of which causing mur∣muring and rebellion, brings forth an 
Aristocratie,
 or gover∣ment of the best men, such as are well brought up, and exerci∣sed in vertue. The end of an 
Aristocratie
 being, as 
 
Aristotle
 hath it, 
Uertue,
 which of no long continuance doth soone de∣generate, 
 
, naturally encli∣ning to an 
Oligarchie,
 or rule of few. These few being chosen according to their riches. And because that many in a state cannot be wealthie, therefore the number of them cannot be great. These are great Lords and little Kings, whose power 
waies all, and not the Lawes; who uniustly favour those that are partially theirs, and oppresse them that would defend their libertie against them. All things being administred 
 
, by their presidents. Such dominion is ta∣ken away by the people set on a rage, and not bearing 
, the iniuries of their rulers. Hence comes in a 
Democratie,
 which 
Sophocles
 calls 
, the power of a multitude; whose end is freedome; when 
ll can equally partake of the same priviledges and immunities, who are true citizens: whence 
T
rence
 stiles it 
aequam libertatem▪
 for which the 
Greeke Oratours
 haue properly used the word 
, as 
 
Vlpian
 observeth. But the vulgar for the most part strangely insolent, prone to wrong, and ready to trespasse a∣gainst the Lawes, bring in by a miserable proceeding, the worst kinde of goverment an 
Ochlocratie,
 the rule of Ras
ali∣tie. All these in their times did 
Athens
 feele, for they were governed by Kings foure hundred eightie seaven yeares: the last of which was 
Codrus,
 who in a fight between the 
Dori∣
nses
 and 
Athenians
 offered himselfe willingly to be slaine, it being foretold by the Oracle of 
Apollo
 that the 
Dorienses
 should be conquerours unlesse the 
Athenian
 King were kil∣led; he therefore clothing himselfe 
famulari veste n
 posset ag∣nos
i,
 saies 
 
Cicero,
 with a servants habit least he should bee


knowne, put himselfe among the enimies, by one of which in a brawle he was murdered. After whom none enioyed the name of King,
 
quod memoriae nominis eius tributum est,
 which was done in memory to his name. For after that, 
Archontes
 or 
Iudges
 ruled; in the Title 
, 
Archontes,
 but in power Kings, whose authority was for tearme of life. These continu∣ed three hundred and fifteene yeares. These being ended, it pleased the State to choose a man, whose office should con∣tinue but tenne yeares; seaven succeeded each other, & made up the number of seaventie yeares; who, because they abused their power, were made but for one yeare, called therefore 
 
annui Magistratus,
 yearely Magistrates. These continued untill 
Pisistratus,
 for a fained feare of the seditious, begged a guard of the people for his safetie. For when the faction sprung up. Of which I haue spo∣ken in the fourth Chapter, hee cutting himselfe with la∣shes, and the Mules which drew his Chariot, went into the place of meeting, 
, and beseeching the people to afford him some defence against their violence, who did (but did not) assault him, procured a company of chosen Citizens who armed with clubs, not weapons, possessed the Castle, and so Tyranny came in, which 
Pisistratus
 enjoyed 
 thirtie yeares, and deceased, leaving behind him two sonnes, 
Hippar∣chus,
 and 
Hippias,
 whom 
Heraclides
 calls 
Thessalus. Hippar∣chus
 was s
aine by 
Aristogiton,
 after whose death the 
Athe∣nians
 lived under a tyranny 
 foure yeares, from which they were delivered by the help of the 
Lacedaemonians,
 the of∣spring of 
Al
maeon
 corrupting the Oracle, to the end that whensoever they came for counsell he should wish them to free the 
Athenians
 of that servitude. The 
Democratie
 came in eight hundred sixtie eight yeares after 
Cecrops,
 established by 
Solon,
 who excluded the fift ranke of plebeitie from office or honour by a law, afterwards abrogated by 
Aristides.
 After this 
Pericles
 brought in an 
Ochlocratie
 by weakning the power of the 
Areopagites.
 Then after the overthrow in 
Sici∣ly



the 
 or foure hundred took upon them state, de∣ceaving the people, as 
 
Aristotle
 and 
 
Thucydides
 affirme. For perswading them that they should reconcile 
Tissaphernes
 and 
Alcibiades
 unto themselues by that meanes, and that the Persian Monarch would afford supply for the war, they most willingly condescended to this motion in the one and twen∣tie yeare of the 
Peloponnesian
 warre. These Princes were cal∣led 
 
, Fiue thousand, though not exceeding foure hundred. The reason is, because they boasted that none should bee rewarded, but who bare armes; nor any admitted to publique power but fiue thousand, such as with person and estate could be beneficiall to the Repub∣lique. Their authority was granted by an 
 Act of the people, to which 
Theramenes
 was very forward, but after they were inducted none more ready to driue out; whereupon they ter∣med him 
 
Cothurnum,
 from a kinde of start-up which did fit both feet. 
.
 The word may sute with a Iack of both sides. These 
 were constrained for feare of 
 
Al
ibiades
 to resigne the right unto the people, and to goe into wilfull banishment. But when 
Lysander
 had overcome 
A
hens
 (the 
 
Lacedemonians
 ever affecting au 
Oligarchie,
 as the 
Atheni∣ans
 a 
Democratie
) he ordained these thirtie to be chiefe. 
 
Po∣lyarches, Critias, Melobius, Hippolochus, Euclides, Hiero, Mnesilochus, Chremo, Theramenes, Aresias. Diocles, Phaedrias, Chaerileos, Anaetius, Piso, Sophocles, Eratosthenes, Charicles, O∣
omocles, Theognis, Aeschines, Theogenes, Cleomedes, Erasi∣stratus, Phido, Dracontides, Eumathes, Aristoteles, Hippoma∣chus, Mnesithides.
 These began at first to put to death the worst and most abhorred, saies 
 
Salust,
 without triall of law; but afterwards the good and bad alike; 
 some for envie, o∣thers for riches. These to make their partie firme chose a∣bout three thousand to whom alone they permitted to haue weapons, disarming all the rest, to the end they might easily command their lives. But by their lawes for they made


so
e, stiled 
 
 (which were nullified by a decree, as we shall speake hereafter) none was to suffer 
, who was registred in the list of three thousand. So cruell were they, that the people fled into 
 
Phyle
 a castle in the 
Athenian
 borders; and making an head, under the conduct of 
Thrasybulus,
 at last shook off this yoke, and remained free un∣till the death of 
Alexander
 even fourescore yeares, whom 
Antipater
 succeeded; who in battle at the Citie 
Lamia
 gaue the 
Athenians
 an overthrow; and gaue them quarters on these termes that they should submit to a few 
Peeres,
 whose revenues amounted to two thousand 
Drachm'es
 at least, the chief of whō was 
Demetrius Phalereus;
 that they should like∣wise receaue a garrison into 
Munychia
 for the asswaging of riots and uproares. But foure yeares after, 
Antipater dying,
 the Citie fell into the power of 
Cassander,
 of whom they of∣ten stroue to acquit themselues. But in vaine▪ For he brought them to such an exigencie, that they were glad to come to composition. And indeed he dealt fairely with them, giving them their Citie. Territories, Tributes, and all other things, so that they would be confederates to him▪ that none, whose revenewes come not to tenne 
minae
 or pounds, should under∣goe any function in the Common-weale; and hee should bee their overseer whom he would be pleased to nominate. The man appointed was 
Demetrius Phalareus,
 
 who made the Citie to shine in her full lustre, insomuch that they erected in honour of him three hundred Statues. He wrote a Treatise of the 
Athenian Republique,
 which had not time devoured, would haue given no small light to my poore endeavours. After he in trouble and vexation had spent foureteene yeares he was put out by 
Demetrius
 the sonne of 
Antigonus
 surna∣med 
Poliorcetes,
 who restored the ancient customes to them againe. To him they ascribed such worship, as also to his fa∣ther, that they changed the name of their 
Iudge
 from 
Archon
 into 
 
 The Priest of the Gods that saved them, calling the yeare after his name, and adding * two Tribes to



the Tenne; whence the Senate consisted of six hundred▪ but fiue before, as 
 
Stephanus,
 But when 
Cassander
 had over∣throwne the sonne and father, such was the ingratitude and leviti
 of the 
Athenians,
 that they forbad 
Demetrius
 to ap∣proach nere their City. After this 
Lacharis
 plaid the Tyrant, and was expelled by 
Demetrius;
 whom they utterly cast off, assuming againe the title of 
Archon. Demetrius
 dying 
Anti∣gonus Gonat as
 succeeded, who in the nineteenth yeare of his reigne put in presidiarie souldiers to the Citie, which tenne yeares after he tooke out. The 
Macedonians
 still kept some of the 
Athenians
 forces in this space. 
Demetrius Antigoni Gon. F.
 & 
Antigonus Doson,
 out of whose hands 
 
Aratus
 the 
Sicy∣onian
 rescued the Citie, and made it stand by it selfe untill 
Phi
,
 the last king of the 
Macedonian Monarchy
 except one, did some what shake it, as you may read in 
 
Livie.
 But he was expelle
t by the Romans, who tooke the 
Athonians
 into league, with a maintaining of their ancient right. So they re∣mained untill the warre betweene 
Mithridates
 and the 
Ro∣mans.
 For by feare they were driven to receaue 
 
Archestra∣
us▪ Mithridates
 his Generall, within their walls; against which 
Sylla
 laid siege, and captivated the City, whence pro∣ceeded 
, a mercilesse slaughter▪ saies 
Appian,
 that the 
 streets did runne with blood. But the Lawes were not much altered by this Conquerour; and therefore they li∣ved in a neere resemblance of their formet s
ate; infavour with the 
Roman
 Emperours. 
Iulius Caesar, Adrian, Antonius, Gallienus,
 in whose successours time, 
Claudius,
 the second of that name, this City was ransacked by the 
Gothes,
 who when they had heaped up innumerable companies of hookes to burn
 were dehorted by this reason, 
 
that the Greekes, spen∣ding their time in reading of 
, might 
 
 more 
nfit fo
 war
 Constantine
 the 
Great
 likewise had this City in high esteem
, taking to himselfe the Title of 
, as 
 
Iulia
 saies, which in the words of 
Nicephorus G
egoras
 is 
 
 (
) the 
Grand Duke▪
 whom simply af∣wards


they called the 
 
Duke
 of 
Athens,
 in that Historians time. Emperours haue taken them wiues citizens of this place; and the 
 daughters of their Dukes haue beene desired by that eminent ranke. And indeed no marvell. For they were potent. 
Raineri
s Acciajolus
 is said to haue taken the Citie from the 
Spaniards
 that inhabit 
Arragon,
 
;
 who having no issue male of his wife 
Eubois
 but an illegitimate named 
Antonius,
 by another woman, be∣q
athed by will 
Boeotiae
 and 
The
es
 to him, but 
Athens
 to the 
 
Venetians,
 from whom his sonne recovered it againe. 
Nerius
 succeeded him in the Dukedome who thrust out 
Chal∣cocondylas
 his father. After him came in 
Antonius Nerius
 brother to the former 
Nerius.
 Now about this time wee must knowe that 
Mahomet
 the sonne of 
Amurat
 the second got 
Athens,
 
 whose beauty and building hee held in admiration; which when he had made his owne, he continued the Title. For another 
Nerius
 from those aboue named dying, leaving one sonne an infant, his mother in the childs Title exercised Tyranny. This woman loved a 
Venetian
 Noble man (sonne to 
Petrus, Palmerius,
 to whose government the Citie 
Naupli∣um
 was committed, he is called by 
Chalcocondylas Priamus
) who came thither for merchandize. Him by discourse and flattery shee intised into her loue, promising that shee would take him to her husband, and giue up the Princedome of 
A∣thens
 unto him. But upon condition, that hee would divorce his owne wife. Whereupon the young man going to 
Venice
 slew his wife, swelling with ambition and thirstie of honour. Which being done, hee returnes to 
Athens,
 marries this wo∣man, enioyes the government of the Citie; who being hated of the 
Athenians,
 and complained of at the Court, to avoid envy termed himselfe the 
Childes
 Tutor. And not long after taking the boy with him, went to the Court; where 
Francus Acci∣ajolus
 waited, expecting to be promoted to the Dukedome. When the Emperour therefore understood the folly of the woman, he gaue the title to him. Who being enstalled▪ im∣prisoned


the woman at 
Megara,
 and afterwards (by meanes not knowne to the 
 Author) slew her. This 
Francus
 in time was taken away from men by 
Zogan
 governour of 
Pe∣loponnesus, Mahomet
 having intelligence that the 
Athenians
 would haue delivered the Citie to the Prince of 
Boeo∣tia.
 Hee was the last Duke.

H
Erodotus
 in 
 
Terpsichore
 is of opinion that the Greekes derived their religion from the 
Ae∣gyptians.
 But 
 
Plutarch
 doth stoutly deny it. And not without good testimonie may I affirme that it seemes to bee a falsitie. For 
Orpheus
 is thought to haue brought the mysteries of piety into 
Greece;
 who was himself a 
Thracian,
 from whom the word 
 
 is supposed to be drawne, which signifies devotion. 
, saies 
 
Nonnus.
 They called 
, to worship God, &c. Ap∣positely to which 
 
Aristophanes
 
.


.


Orpheus shewed us sacrifices and to abstaine from slaughter.
 Ne∣ther is 
 
Euripides
 disagreeing in 
Rheso.










Orpheus revealed the hidden my∣steries. Herodotus
 names not the Gods, the worship of Whō the 
Greekes
 might borrow from the 
Aegyptians;
 Twelue in


number they were, quoth he, but these only are reckoned. 
Iu∣piter. Bacchus. Hercules. Apollo. Mars. Pan. Diana. Isis
 or 
Ceres. Sais
 or 
Minerva. Latona.
 as I haue gathered, which all at once to haue beene made knowne to the 
Greekes,
 and that by the 
Aegyptians
 is too hard a taske for me to proue. The 
Athenians
 I am sure had twelue Gods in especiall ho∣nour, whose 
 pictures they had drawne out in a Gallery in 
Ceramicus;
 and had an Altar erected, called 
 
, on which a little before the 
Sicilian
 war, a man dis∣membred himselfe with a stone; which was accounted pro∣digious. By these twelue would they sweare in common dis∣course. 
 
. The heathens thinking that they did honour those Gods, by whom they sware; as I haue else∣where spoken. But they were not confined to so small a num∣ber as twelue. For how could it be, when they ran through the seaven sorts of Idolatrie? First worshipping the Sunne, & punishing with death the neglect thereof; as you may read in 
 
Plutarch
 in the life of 
Pericles.
 Secondly, deifying the ef∣fects of God▪ as bread, &c. For 
Clemens Alexandrinus
 inter∣prets 
, 
Ceres,
 
, corne or food. Thirdly the poeti∣call Gods. 
Furies, and revengers of wickednesse,
 as 
Alastores. Palamnaei.
 Fourthly, the Passions, as 
Loue, Pittie. Iniurie
 like∣wise and 
Impudence,
 to whom 
Epimenides
 built an Altar at 
Athens.
 Fiftly the accidents of grouth and nourishment, hence 
Auxo,
 and 
Thallo
 two deities, 
, to increase, and 
 to flourish; to which may be put 
Clotho, Lachesis,
 and 
Atropos,
 the three fatall sisters, and 
, 
Necessitie,
 taken sometime for death it selfe. 6
ly
, the Theogonie or pedigree of their Gods, able to makeup the summe of which 
Homer
 speakes. 
, &c. Three thousand. Seaventhly an ig∣norance of the providence and bountie of God toward them, fained 
Hercules
 the repeller of evill, and 
Aesculapius
 the God of Physick. And if this serue not, I can adde an eighth way, namely hospitality and good entertainment of strange Gods. 




. saies 
 
Strabo.
 as the 
Athenians loue forrai∣ners, so forraine Gods.
 
, &c. 
 
Aristides.
 For they serue not only the most anci∣ent Deities, in a peculiar manner aboue all their followers, but haue assumed adventitious ones; such as 
 
Orthane, Conis∣salus,
 and 
Tychon.
 So prone were they to conceaue superstiti∣on, that when 
 
Paul
 preached 
Iesus and the resurrection of the dead;
 they forthwith deemed 
Anastasin,
 or resurrection to be a God. And least they should omit any, they erected Altare to the unknowne Gods, of which 
 
Pausanias.
 Neither may we doubt of it, the scripture bearing witnesse. The cause of this they say to be a fearefull vision appearing to 
Philippides,
 sent Ambassador to the 
Lacedaemonians
 concerning aid against the 
Persians,
 and complaining that he (
 
Pan,
 from whom 
 
spectrum
) was neglected and other Gods worshipped; promising likewise his help, they therefore being victorious, and fearing the like event, built a Temple, and Altar TO THE UNKNOWNE GOD. Another opinion is, that a plague being at 
Athens
 hot, and the people finding no help from the Gods they implored, surmising some other power to haue sent the disease, whereupon they set up this Altar, on which was written 
. TO THE GODS OF ASIA, EUROPE, AND AFKICA, TO THE UNKNOWNE AND STRANGE GOD. As 
Iustin

Heroes

CAP. II.




 Iupiter 
 Mo∣dii salis edendi, Tessera hospitalis seu Symbolum. Apollo 
. Poean, & eiusdem verbi origo. Mercurius 




ABoue other of their Gods 
Iupiter
 was had in high e∣steeme. And that commanded by the Oracle. For when the 
Athenians
 were bidden to dissolue their kingdomes, they were charged to make choice of 
Iupiter,
 
 
. And so by 
 
Aristophanes
 he is called 
. Him they worshipped as 
President of Law and Iustice,
 under the name of 
Iupiter
 
 
Nemius
 (different from that of 
Corinth
 named 
) Him as 
God of supplicants,
 hence 
 
, Him as 
Protector of Cities,
 hence 
. Him as 
Governour and director of their counsells,
 hence 
. Him as 
chiefe of their Societies,
 hence 
, and of their friendship too, hence 
 and of kindred likewise, hence 
. To him they a∣scribed 
Thunder,
 henc 
 
, as much as comming downe in thunder. To him they thankfully acknowledged their delivery from the 
Persians,
 wrought by 
Themistocles,
 hence 
 
. Him they confessed the 
greatest of all,
 hence 
 
: Him the 
overseer of their buying and selling,
 hence 
 
. To him stood an Altar sacred in the 
courts of their houses,
 hence 
Iupiter Hercêus,
 f
om 
 a wall, as if hee were the watch and defender of the house. 
Phavorinus.
 
. There was also an Altar to him before the gates, of which 
 
Ovid.—Ante aedes stabat Iovis Hospitis ara,
 hence 
Iupiter Xenius,
 as if he were the 
God of strangers and hospitality.
 So solemne were they in their entertainements,


that they would not receaue a stranger without great cere∣monies, such as giving of the right hand each to other 
 
, a most certaine signe of fidelitie, and security; as also washing and cleansing with salt, or salt water, as 
 
Tz
∣zes
 on 
Lycophron;
 whence it is called 
▪ Salt they highly esteemed of, ever upbraiding violated hospitality with 
 
, &c. where is the salt? And yet it may bee thought to be said of the communitie of the table 
 
, customes shewing that fellow commoners, and such as feed of the same table must not iniure one another, to which the old saying may well a∣gree, 
 
multos modios salis simul edendos esse, ut 
micitiae 
 expletum sit,
 Men must eat many bushels of salt together, be∣fore they can be perfect friends; meaning that friendship is not to be soone established. But I take 
alt▪ of the lustration, to which also they added fire, as you may see in 
 
Aristopha∣nes.
 Neither was this all, for they sacrificed moreover, calling 
Iupiter
 to witnesse, and using these words in the time of sacri∣fice. 
 
. 
Let my trespasse be against Iupiter Xenius, if I offend, contemne, or neglect stran∣gers.
 And for the continuation of this even to their posterity they were wont to cut an huckle bone in two, the one partie keeping one peece the other party the other halfe, that when occasion or necessitie should make either of them stand in need of other▪ 
 
, 
bringing with them their halfe h
kle bone they might re
 new their hospitality.
 This they call 
 
Symbolum
 a to∣ken▪ which sometimes they would send to their acquain∣tance in others behalfe, as 
Iason
 in 
Euripides
 offers to 
Medea
 to doe. 
 And to send a 
Symbolum
 or token to strangers that shall courteously enter∣taine you. But of this enough, as also of 
Iupiter,
 whom cele∣brated in 
 other Epithites I knowe by the 
Athenians. Apollo
 was next in request to 
Iupiter,
 invocated in 
danger or sudden events,
 hence 
 
, from 
, to turne away, as if


he should deliver them from eminent evill, for which reason he is called 
Alexica
us.
 
 
Apollinem aspellentem mala intelli∣gas, quem Athenienses
 
 appellant. He was one of the first Gods they had, hence is he termed 
 
, but 
 others thinke because he was the father of 
Ion.
 
 
Macrobius
 is of o∣pinion, because the 
Sun
 the same with 
Apollo
 is the Author of progenerating all things, 
quod sol humoribus exsiccatis pro∣generandis omnibus praebuit causam.
 To him stood Altars in their streets, hence is he 
, as if he were set over their waies 
 
Illi enim vias, quae intrapomaeria sunt▪
 
. This 
A∣gyeus
 was a sharp pillar. 
 
. Al∣though the 
Greekes,
 as 
 
Macrobius
 saies, did worship him as 
, 
exitus & introitus potentem,
 one that kept the dores of their houses, yet I finde no monument of that Title in 
Pausanias.
 Famous he was for the name of 
Paean,
 of which though I haue taken occasion to speake elsewhere, yet this is a most proper place. I will not trouble you with the triviall derivations of the 
Greekes,
 which you read in 
 
Athenaeus.
 When the 
Atbenians
 asked helpe of the 
Oracle
 at 
Delphos
 against the 
Amazons,
 in the daies of 
Theseus,
 The God bid them implore his succour in these words 
. 
 
Hanc vo∣cem, id est
 
, 
confirmasse fertur Oraculum Delphicum A∣theniensibus, pet sntibus opem 'Dei adversus Amazonas, Thesco regnante. Nam{que} inituros bellum iussit his ipsis verbis semetip∣sum auxiliatorem invo
ari, hortari{que}.
 I doubt not but the words are changed somewhat, especially if wee consider the ancient 
Io Paean. Paean
 saies the 
 
Scholiast of Aristophanes
 is a song or hymne praying for the ceasing of a plague, or war, nay for the preventing of apparent hurt The originall of 
Io
 
 
Scaliger
 hath already found, 
Iao,
 and 
Io
 being contracted by the 
Greekes
 for 
Iehova; Paean
 then come▪ from 
 to look, so that 
Io Paean
 is in force 
Iehova Penoh
 LORD LOOKE UPON US▪ 
 being a craft of the Divell to come as neere as possibly he may to God, so to bereaue him of his deare ho∣nour, if he could. The remnants of these words the 
 
Symerons



a people of the West Indies use, who in their fighting dance, and leap, and sing 
 
Pe
o,
 at this day. 
Mercury
 is hallowed by the name of 
 
, deemed to be the God whose favour could enrich Merchants and Tradesmen. He is the God of craft, so by consequence he that is cunning to cheat may soone grow rich, wherefore this God is termed 
 
, 
Uery profitable,
 from 
, an augmenting word, and 
 to profit. Hee had a statue erected to him in the Market place called 
 
. The entry of their houses was sacred to him, from which he is named 
 
, as like∣wise 
 from 
, to turne, because he was set up be∣hinde the dore to keep away theeues, that were wont to lurk thereabout, and then afterward commit their villanie. More of his names you may read in 
 
Aristoph. Schol.






CAP. III.




 De Saturno, Vulcano, Neptuno, Marte, Hercule. 
.




S
urne
 was worshipped by the 
Athenians,
 witnesse the feasts kept in honour to him called 
; witnesse a 
 Tē∣ple which he had in 
Athens.
 Of his antiquitie I cannot much affirme any thing. He seemes to haue beene of old, as I con∣jecture out of 
 
, 
Saturninae animae,
 put for dotage proverbially. 
Vulcan
 likewise had his honour there, and a Temple, of which 
 
Demosthenes;
 where was one of the 
A∣thenian
 prisons; some controversies in law in it decided, as I gather out of 
 
Demosthenes. Neptune
 was an ancient Pa∣tron of this Citie, which he loved even to strife. He was fea∣red for securitie in navigation, hence 
 
. 
 
Mars
 also had his worship, and Temple, and 
Hercules
 too, who in a dreame appeared to 
Sophocles,
 revealing unto him the sacri∣ledge
 of one who had stolen a golden cup out of his Tem∣ple▪ called therefore 
Mn
 or 
Index Hrrcules,
 as 
 
Tully.



Neither were they contented with such a quantitie, but ca∣nonized more daily, as the sonnes of 
Tynd
 us, Castor
 and 
Pollux,
 naming them 
 
 
. For they who haue a care & watch of any thing doe diligent∣ly obserue it 
. For which Kings perhaps are called 
, as keepers of their people. 
 The Scholiast of 
Euripi∣des
 teaches us that 
 properly signifieth a Saviour. So 
Pan
 is said to bee 
, 
the Tutelar God of Cyllene.
 And 
Apollo
 in 
 
Homer.
 
. The word is simply put for God in 
 
Aristophanes,
 
 
. To these may be put 
Harmodius
 and 
Aristogiton. Ly∣cus. Theseus. Alon. Hesychus. Aristomac
us
 the Phyfitian. 
Celeus
 and 
Metanira.
 And many more (of whom see 
 
Me∣ursius
) made of Men, as 
Silanion
 and 
Paerrha

 that made the statue of 
 
Tho
us.

, &c.




Minerva
 the especiall deitie of the 
Athenians,
 had the Festivals called 
Panathenaea,
 of which you may fully read in 
 
Meursius.
 Next to her 
Ceres
 and 
Proserpina,
 whose rites 
longe maximis & occultissimis ceraemoniis continentur▪
 
 saies 
Cicero▪
 were greatest and most hidden: therefore cal∣led 
mysteria
 from 
 
, to hide; 
 death and a curse lying on him who should disclose those abominable secrets. See 
Meursius
 in his 
 
Eleusinia▪
 of the initiation into these stews. They were of two sorts. 
 Greater to 
Ceres,
 lesse to 
Proser∣pina. Bacchus
 also the sonne of 
Ceres
 had his Temple allotted and a double tide holy to him. 
Dionysia
 
 
parva
 and 
 
Magna. Venus
 had her honour, and sacrifice in which they offered to her 
 money the price of an whore 
 
Eumenides
 were first a∣dored


by 
Orestes
 after he escaped the 
Iudgement
 at 
Athens
 in 
Areopagus
 for killing his mother 
Clytemnestra.
 These by 
 
Hesiod
 are called 
Erinnyes,
 by the 
Athenians
 
, the venerable Goddesses. To these they offered drinke offerings,
 without wine though at mid-night, a custome peculiar to them alone, as 
 
Aeschylus
 witnesseth, though I am not igno∣rant that 
 
Bacchus
 his feasts were kept in the night, whence he is called 
Nyctelius.
 But the Tragoedian.




 


.




Scholiast:
 
. By 
 
So∣phocles
 the manner of oblation is set downe. First having cleane hands and pure, the worshipper ought to draw out of a running fountaine water, and having filled three cups with water and honey (hence termed 
 
) the mouthes and eares of which are to be covered with the wooll of a young sheep, turning himselfe towards the East, he pow∣red out some of two of them▪ but the third wholy; then with both hands setting thrice nine branches of Oliue on the place where he cast his 
, hee uttered his conceaved supplicati∣ons. Other sacrisices they had as shall bee shortly spoken. 
 
Hecate
 was worshipped by them in 
triviis,
 where three waies met, supposed to bee the Moone in heaven, 
Diana
 on earth, and 
Hecate
 below. 
 To her the richer sort every new Moone made a feast in the crosse waies, setting bread and o∣ther provision▪ which the poore greedily fed on▪ and were so ravenous after, that 
 
Penia
 in 
Aristophanes
 complaines, that they snatcht it, before it could be laid downe. Reference to this hath 
, to eat the cates of 
Hecate,
 in 
 
De∣mosthenes,
 which he seemes to obiect, as a sordid or wicked thing, Indeed 
, which signifies one that privily ta∣keth away any of the sacrifices from the Altar, imports some∣times 
impious,
 
. 
Schol.
 
 
Aristoph.
 And yet the same Scholiast tells us that the needy sustained themselues by the sacrifices. 
 
. 
Iunoes
 rites


were performed in great pomp with haire over their shoul∣ders and downe the back, in a vesture that swept the ground, their armes bedecked with glorious bracelets, their paces so minced, that 
 
, 
Iunonium incedere
 is to goe state∣ly. 
Prometheus
 was worshipped in a kinde of Torch-dance, or running with linkes or lamps, it may bee in memoriall of the fire, which superstitiously they beleeved him to haue stolne out of heaven. To say more of their Gods were needlesse ei∣ther for you to read, or me to write. More they had, among whom 
Pan
 was of a latter making, introducted by 
 
Philippi∣des,
 and

CAP. V.




 
. Phacasiani Dii.




THE 
Athenians
 before their dores erected statues which they called 
 
, because they were exposed to the Sunne. Neither had they these alone, but certaine others sacred to 
Mercury,
 named from 
Hermes Hermae▪ Mercurial
.
 The fashion of them was divers. For first they were not 
, 
porrecto veretro,
 but made after to that forme by the 
Athenians,
 who receaved it from the 
Pelasgi,
 as 
 
Herodotus.
 Neither did they want legges, untill the 
Athenians
 made thē 
, according to 
 
Pausanias.
 The manner was this. 
A face of Mercury set upon a pillar of foure corners.
 The head on∣ly and neck were shapen, and therefore it was called 
truncus Hermes,
 
 
Iuvenal,




Nil nisi Cecropides, trunco{que} simillimus Hermae.


Nullo quippe alio vincis discrimine, quam quod


Illi marmoreum caput est, tua vivit imago.




For which reason likewise the 
Greekes
 name them 
 
, without limbs. On the lower part of them were certaine ver∣ses engraven, containing the praises of some well deserving


men; but the 
Hermae
 on which they wrote the exploits of those that had merited, seeme to me to haue beene set up in that gallery, which from the number of these images was commonly knowne by 
 the gallery of 
Mercurials.
 At the consecration of these they used some ceremonies, and sacrificed alkinde of gruell, which was of no great preparati∣on; Because they would not stand long about it. Hence 
 may be said to sacrifice with that which costs but little. 
 
Aristophanes.
 
▪ 
Schol.
 
. 
in Pace.
 Now to the erecting of their Images it will not beunseasonable to adde something of the forme of their Gods; whom they made standing with their hands upward, as if they were more willing to receaue then bestow any thing. To which 
 
Aristophanes
 alludes, saying,—
 
Even the Gods you shall knowe by their hands and statues. For when we pray them to giue us some good thing, they stand with their hands upward, as if they would send downe nothing, but rather take oblation.
 To tel you likewise that these Idols were clothed, is no news doubtlesse to one meanely versed in the Greeke antiquities. To say that they weare shooes too, is probable, whence they are named 
Di
 Phaecasiani,
 from 
, a kind of low shooes which the 
Athenians
 called 
, from 
, dust, and 
, the foot, because they were neare the ground. 
 saies 
 
Clemens Alexandrinus.
 But more sure I am that they were pictured with them on their 
r. 
 
Iuvenal.

De Superstitione Atheniensium, & vaticiniis.




LOng since were the 
Athenians
 taxed by the Apostle for superstition, which though it properly signifies 
 a wor∣shipping of the Gods too much, yet under it these follies are comprehended. Purification after fearefull dreames, in 
 
Ari∣stophanes
 
. In which sense some understand 
Persius. Noctem flumine purgare.
 Wearing of rings against witchcraft as a spell, called 
 
. 
 Spitting into their bosomes thrice at the sight of a mad man, or one troubled with an 
Epilepsie.
 Of which also 
Theocritus,
 
. I knowe not whether the custome of our sillie people haue reference to this foppery▪ who use to spit at the naming of the Divell. Certaine it is that anciently they did spit in defiance, hence 
 is put for 
 and 
 to contemne or set little by, as the 
 Scholi∣ast of 
Sophocles
 on these words, 
 Wash∣ing with water the head as often as hee shall goe into the streets 
; 
 
Theophrastus.
 Anointing of stones, divers it seemes from those heaps sacred to 
Mercury,
 termed 
. This hath beene of old. Done indeed as a token of thankfulnesse by 
 
Iacob
 in 
Bethel,
 where hee tooke the stone that he put for his pillowes, and set it up, and powred oyle on the top of it, in his iourney to 
Padan Aram.
 Hennes crow∣ing, the bold entrance of a black dog into their houses, Ser∣pents seene 
, saies 
Theophrastus,
 of which 
 
Therence. Introiit in aedes ater alienus canis. Anguis per impluvium deci∣dit de tegulis. Gallina cecinit.
 Put to these a 
 Cator Weesel (the word signifieth both) crossing his way, the Mouse eating his salt bag. Not unlike them now adaies, whose clothes the Rats or Mice shall chance to eat, deemed not long after like to liue by our ignorant, or that hee shall haue great ill betide


him. Adde the avoiding of obsequies for feare of pollution. Antiquity was of opinion that sacred persons were defiled with the sight of the dead, as 
Chemnitius
 hath observed, and 
 
Euripides
 brings in 
Diana
 speaking that it is not lawfull for her to behold dying 
Hippolytus.
 Nay the standing upon a graue was a great religion; 
. Furthermore observing of daies good & bad, of which 
 
Hesiod,
 
, that one is a stepdame, another a mother. 
 Amazement at the Eclipse of the Sunne, as also the 
 Moone; not knowing the reason, why shee did loose her light, at that time, when shee was in her full lustre. Buying of Medicines or enchan∣ted stones for the quicker delivery in child-birth, in 
Aristo∣phanes.
 
. Of the vertue I speake nought. 
 
Boemus
 relates that in 
Darien
 in 
America
 the women eat an hearb when they are great with child which makes them to bring forth without paine. Ioine to this the sneezing over the right shoulder, or the rightside, 
 
. Obser∣vation of 
, or sudden stormes, as the 
 
Sch.
 of 
Aristo∣phanes
 interprets it, snow, haile, or the like. 
 Cutting off their haire, and sacrificing it to rivers, as 
Cephissus,
 Marking the flight of the owle, whence came the proverb, 
 
, 
The Owle hath fled.
 And 
 for good lucke▪ The Owle being a token of victory to the 
Athenians.
 
 
. They ever accounting it so since the warre at 
Salamis,
 where the 
Greekes
 seeing an Owle tooke courage and beat the 
Barbari∣ans. Appendix Uaticana.
 
. Other madnesse of theirs was slee∣ping in the 
 Temple of 
Aesculapius,
 who were ill at ease, supposing the deity to giue, or shew them a remedy, 
 for which in gratulation they were wont to offer him a cock. If I mistake not. What shall I say of 
 putting him to death who should cut downe an Oake or an Holme (so 
Ilex
 which in Greek is 
 may be taken, I thinke it an Holme) in the 
Heroum;
 And punishing 
Atarbes
 capitally who being distra∣cted


had slaine a sparrow sacred to 
Aesculapius?
 Thus farre haue we gone. Let us proceed to their vaticinations or pro∣phecyings. 
Aeschylus
 brings 
Prometheus
 on the stage, vaun∣ting how first he taught men 
 
. All which were practised among the 
Athenians,
 as you may read in 
 
Xenophon.
 
, 
the interpretation of dreames,
 is a resolution of those doubts which we conceaue of things offered to our fancie in sleepe, as that of 
Hecuba
 dreaming that she should bring forth a firebrand; and that of 
Atossa
 before the fall of her sonne 
Xerxes,
 whom shee saw striving to yoke the 
Barbarian
 and 
Greeke
 woman, one of which overthrew him. This the ancients tearmed 
, 
Aeschylus,
 ascribing much to the truth of them, suppo∣sing them to be sent from a Deitie—
. 
 
Homer.
 The skill in them is 
,
 
 (
) to truly tell the event. Which was no small art, certaine bookes written of that subiect. 
 
 as 
Artemidorus
 his 
Onirocritica.
 
, 
Soothsaying by birds
 when such or such flie either before or behinde him, at the right or left hand, to shew what it doth prognosticate. 
 
Aeschylus.
 
. It was formerly stiled 
 
 which the minde doth suggest to the opinion. It is put for a∣ny divination in Greek writers, but most properly 
 which 
 
Telegonus
 is related to haue found according to 
Nonnus,
 but according to 
 
Plinie, Car,
 whence it is called 
Caria.
 
, looking into the Liver or entrals, like the Latines

 observing the colour of them, 
 
; as likewise the soundnesse, hence taken as a prodigie 
, in 
 
Plutarch,
 the extremitie of the liver (like the outmost parts of the vine leafe, saies 
I
i∣dor
) not to be seene, or rather that which they call the head,



Ovid, caesum{que} caput reperitur in extis.
 
, in marking the flame of the sacrifice burnt, 
 
, the Tragoedian calls them, by which they could foretell events. More doubt∣lesse had they waies of witchcraft, as the other Greeks. 
, as when one shall meet you carrying such or such things, then this shall befall you, 
Aeschylus
 termes them 
 
Sch.
 
. See 
Scaliger
 in 
Tibullum,
 on these words 
Puer è triviis.
 The Scholiast of 
 
Aristophanes

Sopho

 calls

 among the Greeks, and the Latines 
 
Est o bo∣nis avibus visus &c.

Sternutament

 being accounted a Deitie by the Romans, but sacred to 
 
Ceres,
 as the Greeks, whence proceeded that 
, which wee imitate in our 
God help

Casaubon
 on 
Athenaeus.

Posidonius
 was an author exposed to the world. 
, as that wherein the 
Witch of Endor
 was experienced, out of the low∣er parts of whose belly the Divell spake. The first that pra∣ctised this among the 
Athenians
 was 
Eurycles,
 hence they who are possessed with this spirit of prophecying are called 
. 
Euryclitae
 as the 
 
Schol.
 of 
Aristoph.
 who calls this ar
 
 
, 
the divining of Eurycles.
 
, where after solemne sacrifices they were wont to call up the


soules of the deceased, demanding of them what afterward should befall. As 
 
Wierus.
 And no wonder, for they held the spirits of their parents and kinred for Gods, 
quibus sacri∣ficabant
 (sai
s 
Bodin
) 
& ad quorum sepulchra comedebant, in quos scriptura invehens ac detestans, inquit, & comederunt sa∣crificia mortuorum,
 to which they sacrificed, and at whose se∣pulchers they fed, against whom the Scripture in veighing & detesting speaketh, 
And they ate the oblations of the dead.
 Of this 
 
Aristophanes
 makes mention, & 
 
Homer
 in his 
Odysses.
 This is that which most properly is called 
 from 
 lamentation, by 
Wierus
 termed 
dirae execrationes,
 
 for with great mourning they invocated 
, wicked Gods for the accomplishment of their divelish designes. It may most fitly haue the name of 
Nigra Magia,
 
 for so the Wisards divide them into the black and white Magick. 
, from whence the word Magick is derived seemes to haue beene found by the 
 
Medes
 & 
Persians,
 whose Priests were called 
Magi,

 a medicine for the procurement of loue, or rather enraging of lust, by bewitching something and gi∣ving it to be eaten; which to haue power over swine is cre∣dibly reported. 
 Tricks with a paire of sheeres and siue, of which 
Theocritus.
 
 
 To take coun∣cell of an hatchet, taking it & laying it on a peece of timber flatwaies, which did the feat by turning round. Like to which is that naughty use of a key and Bible.

 & 
 done by corne, 
 
, by taking the letters of the name, as when two were to fight, and by the value of them to iudge the conquest, As they said of 
Hectors
 being overcome by 
Achilles.
 
, making a circle they divided it into foure and twenty parts,


and on each part made a letter, and putting wheat upon the letters they brought in a Cock, and observing from from what letters he t
oke up the graine, they at last ioyned them toge∣ther, and so knew their successors, husbands, &c. 
, opening a book of 
Homer
 and by the first verse that they lighted upon to divine, as that of the death of 
Soerates,
 who so foretold it, meeting with that verse of 
Homer,
 which speakes of the arrivall of 
Achilles
 within three dayes at 
Thes∣saly.
 
 
Ft quoniam poemata pro vaticiniis, &c.
 and because po∣ems were accounted prophecies, as Poets prophets, they were most busie in them. Hence in publique causes had the Romans recourse to the 
Sibylline Oracles,
 & the private Gre∣cians to the verses of 
Homer.
 And that 
Sors
 was put for the writing of Oracles, is manifest out of the words 
Sortes Del∣phicae,
 for fore-telling or divination. 
 I know the shee Priest of 
Apollo
 being inspired with akinde of holy fury spake to those who asked counsaile. Whence the word

 mad∣nesse. And yet that their cunning men had a kinde of lottery, is as cleere as day, the 
 Scholiast of 
Euripides
 testifying; done it seemes in matters of questiō, so 
 may intimate as much as to undergoe triall. Predictions there were, 
 saith 
Eustath,
 out of signes and wonders, as also of the noise that leaues make when they are burned. To which some adde

 De Templis & Asylis.




THeir Churches were of two sorts; sacred to their Gods in Greek, 
, or 
. And sacred to their Demi-gods most properly 
. But the word is promiscuously used by the Tragoedians. 
Clemens Alexandrinus
 is of opinion that the


first originall of their Temples was the erecting of an edifice to the honour of the deceased. 
 
. 
Cecrops
 buried in the 
Acropolis, Ericthonius
 in the Temple of 
Miner∣va Polias,
 the daughters of 
Celeus
 in 
Eleusiis, &c.
 They were divided into two parts, the sacred and prophane, this called 
, the other 
. 
 
Casaubon
 telsus that 
 was that holy water set at the dore of the Temple, with which every one that entered into the Temple besprinkled himselfe, or was besprinkled by those that sacrificed; of which in the next Chapter. But others haue written that it stood at the entrance of the 
Adytum,
 into which it was not lawfull for any but the Priests to come. The 
 Schol. of 
Sopho∣cles
 thus describes the Church. 
, quoth hee, is the place where the Altar stands. 
, the Altar on which they offered their oblations, 
, where they placed the Idol which they worshipped; in ancient time a rude table or stock, 
 
 
Clemens Alexandrinus
 calls it, as that of 
Iuno Samia,
 after∣ward made in the magistracie of 
Procles
 to be a statue. At first named▪ 
 
, from the shaving of it; but when art began to bee so expert as to make it resemble a man, they termed it 
, from 
 
mortal is,
 whose shape it bare At the setting up thereof they used these ceremonies: That a woman neatly trimmed and deckt in a purple vesture, should bring on her head a pot of sodden pulse, as beanes, pease, and the like, which they sacrificed in thankfulnesse for their first food, 
 
. For as much as I conceaue out of 
Pollux,
 they prayed not where this was consecrated, or did divine honours, but in the 
 or 
, the body of the Church, framing, as may bee gathered, their gesture towards it. 
 
, &c. Furthermore belonging to their Temples there was a kinde of Vestry, in Greek 
 by some tran∣slated 
summum templum,
 as if it were at the upper end. This seemes to haue beene a Treasurie both for the Church, and


any soever, who fearing the security of his wealth would commit it to the custody of the Priest, as 
 
Xenophon
 is repor∣ted to haue done at the Temple of 
Diana
 in 
Ephesus. Marti∣al
 points at this when he saies,


Templa vel ar
ano demens spoliaverat auro.


So reverently did they esteem of these houses of their Gods, that to doe those offices of nature, I meane venting of excre∣ments too shamelesly seene among us, in the Church-yards, as I may call them, was an abomination; punished severely by 
Pisistratus.
 For when he had taken tribute of all that the 
At∣tick
 ground had brought forth, they so hated him for that taxa∣tion as they made the 
 of the Temple of 
Apollo Py∣thius
 a 
akes; which although forbidden never was redressed. And yet so secretly was it done, that he could apprehend none saue at last one stranger, whom hee caused to bee whipt, with this proclamation, THAT BECAVSE HEE CONTEMNED THE EDICT HE SHOVLD DIE. Hence to a man that soundly smarted for his wickednesse, they were wont pro∣verbially to say, 
Hee had better haue eased himselfe in the Py∣theum,
 or if there were more, in the plurall number. 
. Nay so honourable held they these Churches that to them they granted priviledge of 
San∣ctuary,
 to which who should fly, might not from thence bee drawne out under a trespasse upon religion. Of this kinde was the Temple of 
Minerva,
 and 
Theseus,
 the Altars of the 
Eumenides,
 and 
Mercy,
 
 whose, image they would not haue erected any where in their City, although in the midst thereof shee had a Groue. 
 The first 
Asylum
 among the Heathens is held to haue beene in 
Athens,

CAP. IX.




 De Sacrificiis.




THE father of Philosophie is of opinion that Sacrifices first began after the ancients had ended their harvest. For then being free from care, they found time for mirth and iol∣litie. In which they offered their first fruits called 
, from whence 
 is read generally to doe any sacrifice. Neither doth 
 import lesse, For 
 
 signifies the bend, or great chest of the garnet, wherein they laid up the harvest thresht and winnowed; 
, the first or beginning, as if when they began to treasure up their store, they first of all liberally paid some devotion to their Gods. The 
Attick
 obla∣tions, even to 
Draco,
 were nothing else but the earths benefi∣cence, but before 
Solons
 age, burnt offering; who willed in his lawes, that they should be 
, chosen and selected
 sacrifices. The rites performed in them were not different from those in the daies of 
Homer,
 but somewhat reformed. It behoved them that would take in hand these holy things to purifie themselues some certaine daies before, 
 
, the number of them is not set downe. I take 
 here to abstaine from carnall delights, 
Tibull. -Disce∣dite ab aris Quo
 tulit hesterna gaudia nocte Venus
) To which purpose 
Theano
 being asked when it might be lawfull for a woman, from the company of a man to goe to sacrifice; answe∣red, from her owne at any time, but a stranger never. Being thus prepared they came and stood round the Altar, having with them a basket in which was the knife hid (covered


with flower and salt, in 
 
Aristophanes
 
, in 
 
Homer
 
) with which they cut the throat of the 
victime.
 Then they purified the Altar going about it with the right hand towards it. 
 
Aristophanes.
 
. This lu∣stration was made with meale & holy water sprinkled there∣on. This water is called 
 
 in which they quenched a firebrand taken from the Altar; with which they bedewed the standers by, accounting it a kinde of clensing. (Hence 
 
 was forbidden him whom they took for a pol∣luted and for lorne rogue.) Then they cast some of the flower on them. And having thus expiated, they cried out 
 
; 
Who is here,
 to which they made reply, 
. Many and good. Then they praied. 
 
Homer.
 
. Among the latter they spake with a loud voice 
, before they began. 
Let vs pray.
 Supplications ended they drew the victime so as (if it were to the Gods aboue) the head might looke upwards, which 
 
Homer,
 
. 
Eust.
 
. If it were to the 
Heroes
 or Demi-gods, with his throat downewards. Then they slew him & skinned him, & cutting out the 
 huck shin∣bones and hanch, they covered them with fat, which is called 
 (hence the Gods of the heathen are deciphered by 
 
Nazianzen,
 
, reioycing in the fat) to the ende that they might burne all out in a great flame. 
 
. For the Grecians accounted it unluckie if it did not so consume, and thought that it was not 
: upon the 
 they cast small peeces of flesh cut from every part of the beast, begin∣ning with the shoulder (which is in Greek 
) hence this is called 
. The reason 
Eustathius
 giues, 
 
, that they might seeme to consume all, which the 
Athenians
 did not, being commanded by law to carry some of the sacrifice home. By


reason of which iniunction, they did so straine curtesy of their Gods, that the illiberall or niggardly sort of people would sel that which was left, and so make gaine of their devotion. 
 
 saies 
Theophrastus,
 Where 
 
Casaubon
 notes. 
Coxam ferè offerebant, aut intestina, aut aliud non magnae rei persaepe.
 They offered the hanch bone or the entrals, or somewhat of no great worth. Where by entrals you are to understand the spleene, the liver, and the heart, which 
Homer
 calls 
, for though the word bee taken for the bowels, yet it signifies the heart too, in which sense we say 
 a pusillanimous man, & 
 a couragious, as the 
 Scholiast of 
Sophocles
 teaches us, & so 
 the bowels of compassion. These the anci∣ents did divide among them at sacrifice to feed on, and after∣wards cut out the rest to rost. For when they had finished their devotions, they let the reynes loose to all manner of voluptu∣ousnesse, gluttony, and drunkennesse. For oft times they left nothing of their sacrifice, especially when they offered to 
Ve∣sta,
 whence the proverb, 
, is to eat up all, like the Roman 
Lari sacrificare.
 To say that publikely they begun to 
Uesta
 were more then I could well proue; but that they did so is plaine. In their houses they had Altars, and so I supposed once 
 to be taken, but this was done in 
Liba∣minibus,
 in their drink offerings, as he on 
 
Aristophanes.
 As for their meat offerings it was required that they should bee 
 sound and without blemish, whether it were an oxe, sheep, goat, swine, calfe: to sacrifice they simply termed 
 which our Latines haue interpreted fitly, 
Facere.
 
 Virgil, 
cum faciam vitula.
 Whose poverty was so great that hee could not afford a sheep, or the like, they thought the Gods would bee well pleased if he offered 
Molas,
 which the Greekes call 
 
 meale, which by the richer was mingled with oyle and wine, as the 
 Scholiast of 
Aristoph.
 The more wealthie in∣steed of this did cast frankincense on the Altars. For the sacri∣fices of 
Pallas
 the tithes were set a part, as 
 
Demostenes.
 In


their oblations the 
 or cookes gaue the 
 10 part to the 
Prytanes.
 So 
, put for 
 where the Gods cannot haue their allowance. Schol. 
Aristop.
 on 
, &c.






CAP. X.




 De Anno Attico.




THE ancient Greek yeare consisted of three hundred & sixtie daies, each moneth consisting of thirtie. Rude anti∣quity ignorant of celestiall contemplations, deeming the Moone to finish her course in that space. Which according to 
 
Petavius
 seemes false. 
Lunaris enim non fuit, sed eius menses tricenis diebus constabant singuli.
 By which reckoning, had they not used intercalations, they had soone found a maine difference in the times, when they ought to haue celebrated their festivals. They made therefore a 
Tetraeteris,
 in which when they found seaven daies deficient, they supplied them by adding 
 2 to every end of the yeare, called 
, 
 
eò quod per illud biduum Athenae Magistratibus careban
,
 Because for those two daies 
Athens
 was without Magistrates. But the last of these foure had but 359 daies, besides the two 
, in respect to the Olympick games, ever kept in the 
Olympick
 games, ever kept in the 
 full moone, whieh could not haue happened, had they not began the 
Tetraeteris
 with a new Moone. Neverthelesse the Sunne and Moone appearing 14 daies oddes in a 
Tetraeteris,
 they made every eighth yeare an interiection of one Moneth, that this time being ended, the course might still returne the same. This all 
Greece
 observed, saies 
Petavius,
 by the 
Athenians
 termed 
, by the people of 
Etis
 an 
Olypiad.
 What kinde of Lunary yeare was in use among the Grandsires of 
Greece,
 is


not truly known; by 
 
Petitus
 delivered to be of D: 347. eve∣ry Month 29 D: except one, which like our February had but 28 D: Every two yeares one Moneth was inserted, once of 29 D: another time of 28 D: But because in two yeares this 
 
magnus annus
 surpassed the Moone 15 D: 
ita{que} Tetraeterida fecerunt.
 This cōsisted of 1445 D: 723. & 722. make 1445. So many daies 354. foure times doubled hath, if 
ou please to adjoyne 29. Of this sort of calculation doth hee understand 
 
Geminus.
 
. 
That must be fitly understood,
 quoth hee, 
for they did number the Moneths as if they were
 30 D: 
when notwithstan∣ding
 
they had but
 29. 
 
Petavius
 is otherwise conceited, who takes the Scholiast of 
Aristophanes
 in that sense, as meaning 29 D: full ones, when indeed exactly taken according to 
 
Geminus
 you may account 29. ½. 1/33. and 
 
Ulpian,
 
▪ 29. 
. And yet are we not destitute of authority, that a Moneth was supputed 29 D. 
 
Theon.
 
. But that the fragments were left out, the words are plaine, 
. 
He meanes a day the space of a night and a day, for according to such Moneths did they administer their civill affaires. And now it is in re∣quest among many of the Greekes.
 But of this enough. Soone was the 
Tetraeteris
 found faultie; therefore was made a Ka∣lander of eight yeares, in which doubling eight times the dif∣ference of the Sunne, to wit, 11 D: ¼. made up three Months, inserted every third, fift, and eighth yeare. But the scruples comming short in sixteene yeares 3 D: they intercalated three. And seeing still they could not make it even. 
 
Eucte∣mon
 and 
Philippus
 made an Almanack for nineteene yeares, which by 
Callippus
 was produced to 76. Moneths 940. of them 28. 
, saies 
Geminus.
 This was the progresse of their reformation.


But we must look back againe and consider that they counted their yeare two waies. First of 
 CCCLX, as hath been alrea∣dy spoken, next CCCLIIII, when they made the Moneths interchangeably 
, 
full and deficient,
 that is, one 29. the other 30 daies, yet both Lunary. For that is proved even by the names of their daies. The first, wherein the Moon appeared new, called by a 
Synalaepha
 or contraction of the words 
. The second 
. The eight 
, or halfe full: the full 
. The last 
 
 
, because that in the daies of 
Thales Milesius,
 
 who was the author of that terme, the Moneth had 30, and no more, but ended, whence I suppose 
 
, signi∣fie the dead, the period of whose life hath beene come to. Though 
Diogenian
 giues other reasons. And by the way we must not thinke, that they had no regard to the course of the Sunne; 
 
sed tamen ut annus fieret Solaris, &c.
 But neverthe∣lesse that the yeare might be correspondent to the Sun, they put fiue daies, called 
 epacted, to the last Month 
Scir∣rophorion,
 for the supplying of the defect. And so the yeare had 365 D: which was the true and iust measure. But hee might haue added, sometimes 366, by reason of that ¼ which 
Geminu
 acknowledges the Greeks to haue reckoned, al∣though they accounted their Moneths but 30 D. This is that 
annus implicitus,
 which 
 
Aratus
 stiles 
. To this point the Greeke Authors, telling the yeares by seed time. 
 
Sophocles
—
. For the ancients, saies 
 
Theon,
 took the yeare three waies, either by the Sunne; or seasons; as spring, summer, autumne, winter, 
 (
Sophocles.
 
—) or thirdly by the Moone: whose irregularity 
Solon
 is reported by 
 
Plu∣tarch
 first to haue marked. Observing therefore that shee on the same day overtooke and surpassed the Sun▪ 
 
, he caused that to be called 
 
 
the old and new,
 because that remnant, which was before the coniunction, hee thought belonging to


the precedent Moneth▪ and that remnant which was after the coniunction, appertaining to the subsequent. (These peeces 
 
Aratus
 calls 
) in which matter hee is thought to haue had 
Homer
 in sight, who in his 
 
Odysses
 termes the thirtieth day, as 
Didymus
 expounds it, 
. Where wee may note that then they had no 
, but counted from one to twelue in the 
ordinal numbers,
 used by 
 
Demosthenes
 in one Oration, 
 and 
. Then putting the lesser to the greater they said 
, 
the third aboue ten, the fourth upon tenne,
 and so to twentie, 
 But when at the one and twentieth day they perceaved the wane of the Moone to be great, and the light almost lost, they changed the order and used 
, &c. 
the tenth of the de∣crease, the ninth of the decrease,
 and so to the twentie nine, 
, 
the second of the decrease, or from the end,
 going lower in number stil, as the splendor of the Moon was dimini∣shed, but the thirtieth they call'd 
 for the cause aboue. Here likewise they take the reason why the Moneth ending was 
 
 
. Be∣cause the daies and Moones doe as it were die, according to that of 
Horace. Novae{que} pergunt interire Lunae.
 
 
Macrobius, quid aliud nisi illum
 
 
dicit, cuius paulatim deficientis supputatio in nomen desinit secuturi: &
 
 
illum, qui praece∣dit numerum successurus priori in defectum meanti.
 
 standing to supply the place of the departing Moneth; fixed and still waiting untill the Moone shall haue iournied to the compleating and ending of the precedent time. Thus the last day of our liues is said to stand. 
Virgil,
 
 
Stat sua cui{que} dies,
 as unto which we must passe through all the rest, and once ap∣proach. Thus squared they their times and state matters to the Moone. Hence read we 
, to count the Moneth as they doe, who manage politick businesses, or belon∣ging to government. In which course they made their yeare of CCCLIIII daies, which divided into ten parts make ten


times 35, which space each 
 
 ruled in its turne, the foure that abounded were called 
, in which they chose Magistrates, being for that time destitute of them. The yeare thus disposed, the Moneths must of necessity be 
 
cavi & pleni,
 as 
 
Geminus.
 
. If a Moneth haue 29 D: 
•
, two haue 59. Because there fore the two halfes might bee made one whole, they so ordered it that now it should bee 29 D. then 30 D: The 
Athenians
 counted their day from the setting
 of the sun on this day, untill the going downe of the next. In respect to which 
 
Nicander
 may be thought to say of noone sleep,—
. 
To take rest at the beginning of the even.
 I knowe that the ancients wrought but six houres in the day. 
 
Martial, sexta quies lassis septima finis erit.
 Which 
 
Eustath
 affirmes in his Commentary on 
Homer.
 And there∣fore Z. H. 
 I were the notes of the 7. 8. 9. 10. houres, which ioyned unake 
, as if they should haue said to the Laborers, 
Rest.
 The beginning of the yeare was 
 
Hecatombaeon, Iuly,
 the eight, saies 
 
Petitus.
 They ever accounting that to be the first Moneth. In which order I haue found them set downe in a 
 Manuscript in our publique Library, only 
M
macterion
 is to be put aboue 
Pyanepsion.

In which table although

Ianuary,
 yet it appeares not that 
Hecatombaeon
 was ever so remoued out of his place, as 
 
Petitus
 will haue it, 
Epiphanius
 contradicting, of which by and by. Indeed whē the Christians in honour of their Easter began the yeare in April, they called April 
Hecatombaeon,
 as 
 he himselfe testi∣fies. But that 
Hecatombaeon
 was alwaies the first Moneth is not probable. For when the 
Athenians
 under the dominion of 
Alexander
 the Great's successors changed the head of the yeare from 
Iuly
 to the seaventh of 
October
 it is like that they began at

 Certaine it is that the same 
Atti
k
 Moneths are sometimes Lunary, and sometimes not, but of 30 D: or 
Iulian;
 When they are Lunary they haue no sure seat, but are now at this time, then at another. And this hath been the reason why the same Moneths haue not beene suted to 
he 
Iulian,
 by writers.

CAP. XI.




 De Tragoediâ, Satyricâ, & Comoediâ.




IT is taken for grant among the Ancients, that 
Homer,
 who lived 
 9 7 yeares before Christe, was the first that taught 
 
, to speake in Tragoedie; comprehending great and weighty matters in few words and very concisely, being more large and using circumlocution in matters of lesse con∣sequence, which 
Hermogenes
 acknowledges to bee the pro∣perty of a Tragoedian. This foundation being laid, following ages stilibuilt built (though rudely) a structure to small perfection. 
Nam post idius tale tantum{que} documentum, &c.
 saies 
 
Donat.
 For after that 
Homer
 by the Iliads had represented a Tragoe∣die, by the 
Odysses
 a Comoedie, most ingenious imitators took those Poems and set them in order, and divided them, which at that time were inconsideratly, & without iudgement writ∣ten, impolisht▪ and in the first rudiments not so neat and trim, as in processe of time they were made. For Poesie was a great while in her minoritie, and very rude, after the first publish∣ing of plaies. For we see little or nothing of 
 
Susarion,
 the first Comoedian, worth our time: some few verses only, & so few as may but witnesse such an Author. The originall of the word Comoedie is supposed to be taken from divers reasons: First, because in their revelling, kept in honour to 
Bacchus,
 they sung them, and so it may be derived from 
, 
commes∣satio▪
 
, signifying 
, to sing basely
 at the cup. Secondly from 
, sleep; because when any of the 
Attick
 husband men had been injured, it was the custome (as before hath been spoken) for the party abused, to come in


the night season into the streets, and with a loud voice cry, such and such reioyce in wrong, and commit such outrages, though there be Gods and Lawes. And after that, proclaimed the parties name, who on the morrow was sought out by the husband men and much shamed; by which these wrongs were redressed. Thirdly from 
, a street, because when the old 
Athenians
 would note a wicked mans life out to the world, meeting merrily in the streets and high waies, they laid open every mans life and concealed not his name, 
 
In vicos & compita ex omnibus locis laeti, alacres{que} veniebant: ibi{que} cum no∣minibus singulorum vitam publicabant.
 These verses were first sung 
 in the greene Meddowes, 
 about the beginning of the spring; When the husband men kept the festivals of 
Bac∣chus
 the God of Wine, to whom they sacrificed a Goat, be∣cause his biting is an enimy to the vine, the skin of which they took and sowed up close, filled with wine, and anointed it with oyle to make it slippery, and so hopped with one leg upon it, making themselues laughter at the falls they often to
k. This sport they call 
 from 
 a skin and 
, to leap, 
 
Aristophanes.
 
▪ 
 
Uirgil
 hath fitly set it out.




Non aliam ob culpam Baccho caper omnibus aris


Caeditur, & veteres ineunt proscennia ludi:


Praemia{que} 
 ingentes Pagos & compita circum


Theseidae posuere: at{que} inter pocula laeti


Mollibus in pratis unctos saliere per utres.




After 
Susarion,
 sprang up 
Thespis,
 the first that made Tragoe∣dies, which by 
Horace
 are termed 
Lachrymosa poemata,
 sad poems; because they represent humane miseries, the misfor∣tunes of Kings and great men especially, there being no place for a poore man, but only to dance, as 
 
Arrian
 hath observed. Which thing gaue an occasion to 
 
Socrates,
 when he saw the most worthy and rich put to death under the thirty Tyrants to say to 
Antisthenes,
 doth it not repent thee that we in our liues never did some famous exploit? So in Tragoedies we ma
ke


that such as 
Atreus, Thyestes,
 and 
Agamemnon
 are slaine; but what Poet was yet so impudent as to bring a base fellow on the stage sacrificed? Not supernumerary is that of 
Euripides
 for 
K. Archelaus,
 desiring that he would write a Tragoedie of him, who prayed that nothing proper to a Tragoedie might happen to him; meaning sorrow and lamentation. For so is 
 used, as 
 
 for joy and mirth, and glee con∣ceits. The first Tragoedie that 
Thespis
 taught was that of 
Al∣cestis
 repriving her husband from death by her owne, as 
 M
r
 
Selden
 hath coniectured. This 
Thespis
 was forbidden by 
So∣lon
 to act his Tragoedies, as 
 
, a fruitlesse ly∣ing. 
Horace
 of him thus speakes.




Ignotum tragicae genus invenisse camaenae


Dicitur, & plaustris vexisse poemata Thespis.


Quae canerent agerent{que} peruncti foecibus ora.




Vpon which words some haue written that his Poems were so voluminous, that he was constrained to bring them upon waines. But alas a poore conceit▪ 
 
Franciscus Lusininus Uti∣censis
 is of opinion that 
Thespis
 carried his scene upon carres: and 
Acron;
 That the 
Chorus
 carried about in waines acted Tragoedies. 
Chori plaustris circumducti Tragoedias agebant.
 
 I avouch that at the first the Poets acted alone their owne Fables; And to me it seemes a ground for to stand on, the Greek Authors by the word 
, intimating a Poet. O
 
, &c. The ancients, saies 
 
Vlpian,
 called the Poets 
Hypocritas actors,
 which we now terme 
Tragoedi,
 such as 
Euripides, Aristophanes, &c.
 The place in which they sung their Poems, was a Scene upon a waine drawne in procession to the honour of their God 
Bacchus▪
 as among the 
Greekes
 the
 custome was, saies the Scholiast of 
Nazianzen.
 Of the manner in those ancient times, 
 
Plutarch
 shall thus informe you. 
, &c. A pot of wine and a vine twig, then one drawing a Goat, next another with a basket of figs, and last of all the 
Phallus.
 In which solemnitie the Poets in waines following the pomp, might without controle laugh, scorne, and deride any they met, saies 
 
Dionysius Halicarnas∣saus;



or were wont, as the 
 Schol. of 
Nazian.
 to rayle upon each other. whence 
, is as much as to convitiate im∣pudently, (though in a good sense sometimes 
 to celebrate the pomp, or goe in procession in honour to the festivall) and 
 
▪ a scandall or reproach. 
. Whence like∣wise came the Greek proverb, 
 
 
tanquam ex plaustro loqui,
 and 
 
, 
tanquam ex plau∣stro convitiari,
 to giue reines to the tongue, to be free in abuse. Which that they might doe the better without shame, or blushing, sometimes would they anoint their faces 
amurca, olci face,
 with the dregs of oyle, saies 
Donat,
 or of wine (for so I interpret 
) from which Poets by 
 
Aristophanes
 are called 
. 
Horace—Peruncti
foecibus ora.
 Sometimes would they put on vizards, 
 which least they should hurt the head, were defended from the skinne with a wollen cap, na∣med 
. A word elegantly used by 
 
Demosthenes,
 in a Metaphor drawne from the liberty and impunitie of the per∣sons that wore it. 
. Thinke not to e∣scape scot-free for such villanie, though you get a 
pileum
 on your head. We may apply it in threatning to any slanderer, of whom we surely intend to be revenged. But I seeme to for∣get the Poet, while I speake of the stage, I will therefore re∣turne to him. 
Thespis,
 as I said, was the first that invented Tragoedies; so called, as 
Donat
 tels, because (least there should be rewards wanting, by which good wits might be stirred up to write, and men encouraged to get them 
nable voices 
ad dulcedinem commendationis
) they gaue the Actors a Goat. 
Ca∣per 
, pro dono his dabatur.
 
 is a Goat, and 
 a song. 
Horace, Carmine qui Tragico vilem certavit ob hircum.
 Before that time some say that 
Epigenes
 the 
Sicyonian
 made Tragoedies, but the most receaved opinion is this which 
Ho∣race
 hath set downe of 
Thespis.
 Before him there was no art of poesie Tragicall, but at their festivals, when they ascribed all their mirth and delight to their Gods, they did it especial∣ly


to 
Bacchus
 (and so afterward, when Actors are called 
, and 
 simply by 
 
Demosthenes,
 by 
Donat Artifices.
 The word is used for Iuglers, and such as 
Hokus Po∣kus
 in 
 
Theophrastus
) they would feast, and afterward scoffe and deride each other, which grew afterward a part of their solemnitie. They would moreover dance at rude Musick, and from thence suppose they the 
Chorus
 to haue sprung up. They would likewise cast forth 
, as they terme them, in 
 
Virgils
 language, 
versus incomptos,
 
 
Numeros innu∣meros 
o temporc fundi solitos & fine arte.
 For they had of old but two sorts of verses, 
Heroicks,
 in which they sung the praise of Gods and Noble men, and from this in a short time, with smale care grew a Tragoedie; the other sort was 
Iam∣bicks
 as toying and laseivious as the 
Phallica,
 but biting too & from hence came a Comoedie. At first small was the diffe∣rence betweene a Tragoedie and Comoedie, 
 
constat sane, pri∣mis temporibus ignoratum fuisse discrimen inter Tragoediam & Com
diam,
 and the reason is, because even Tragoedies had their wantonnesse and petulancie. At first they sung in ho∣nour to 
Bacchus D
thyrambicks,
 and afterwards neglecting him they praised their Demi-gods, which when the people saw they cryed downe, with 
, whence our proverbiall adverb is fitly used 
, for nothing to the purpose. But to giue content to the people, the Satyres did 
.
 But after that, when a Tragoedie tooke state they excluded the Satyres, and were only for sad and serious persons; by which mournfull poëms the people were wont to be cast down, sympathizing with the person represented, therefore to cheere them a 
Chorus
 of wanton Satyres were brought in by 
Thespis
 as 
 
Horace.




Mox etiam agrestes Satyros nudavit, & asper


Incolumi gravitate, iocum tentavit, eo quod


 erat & grata novitate morandus


Spectator, functus{que} sacris, & potus & exlex.




In a Satyrick play, Satyres haue a 
Chorus
 place, or else the


persons are Satyrick and ridiculous, and for the easing of the mindes of the spectators, they would bring in Satyres for sports sake; and many of their Tragoedies had some mixture of Satyrick sport, saies 
 
Casaubon. Fuisse aliquando pluribus Tragicis Dramatis interjectas Satyricas fabulas.
 Of this I say 
Thespis
 was the first inventer, who likewise to ease the 
Cho∣rus
 (
 for that acted only) brought one actor upon the stage, to whom 
Aeschylus
 added one, and 
Sophocles
 another, so the number was three, 
Aeschylus's
 is 
, 
Sophocles
 his 
, a word put for an obscure & base fellow in 
 
De∣mosthenes, Vlpian,
 
, speaking of 
Aeschines,
 if I remember. 
Tully
 calls them Actors 
secundaris & tertiarum partium.
 
 
Ut in actoribus Graecis fieri videmus, s
pe illum qui secundarum & tertiarum partium, cum possit ali∣quanto clarius dicere, quam ipse primarum, multum summitte∣re, ut ille princeps quam maxime excellat.
 But let mee speake what I haue to say of a Tragoedie. 
 None was permitted once to act 
Aeschylus, Euripides,
 or 
Sophocles
 his Tragoedies, but they were to bee recited by the Scribe, that the Actors might (as I conceaue) repeat them. 
. And to this purpose by a law of 
Lycurgus
 the Oratour were they commanded to be transcribed, and kept under cu∣stodie 
. Yet the 
 Author of the life of 
Aeschylus
 writes, that the people made a decree, that he should receaue such a summe of gold, that would 
 the plai
s of 
Aes∣chylus
 after his death. I put the word 
, 
docere.
 Because Tragoedians as well as the Comoedians were said 
, to labour in teaching the people. And for this end did the ancients lay out so much mony upon their Theaters. 
 
Sed immane quos quantos{que} sumptus, i
 Theatra, in Comoediarum ac Tragoediarum repraesentationem fecerit an∣tiquitas. Cum non mores tantum ab utris{que} emendari, ac pru∣dentiam conferri, sed & scripta antiquissima & formas Reipub∣licae, ac vitam magistratuum, cum summo spectatorum fructu,




in Comoedia examinari, factiones componi, ac gravissima subin∣de publico suppeditari crederent consilia.
 Not unfitly therefore did the Poet reply to the people that carped at him in the Theater. 
I came hither to teach you, not to be taught by you.
 Hence of a Tragoedie or Comoedie the Greeke writers say, 
 
, 
docetur fabula,
 and 
, 
docere,
 as sometime 
, as you may see in 
 
Athenaeus.
 The following Poets did not alwaies represent their owne Fables, but oft-times their predecessors; so saies 
 
Quintilian,
 the people permitted the works of 
Aeschylus
 to bee dealt with, because in many places his verses were not set in order. Hee brought great grace to the stage, and first taught 
, the painting of the Scenes; which some thinke 
Horace
 to ayme at, when hee saies, 
Modicis intravit pulpita cignis.
 Which because it was perfected by 
Sophocles,
 is thought (nay spoken affirmatiuely by some) to haue beene invented by him. 
Sophocles
 indeed did 
, bring in many new things. such as leaving out the action of the Poet (for before the Poet himselfe acted) by reason of the badnesse of his owne voice; hee found out white shooes, which the Actors and Dancers wore; he made the number of Dancers fifteene, before but twelue; hee fitted likewise his Tragoedies to the natures of the Actors, &c. but that he invented 
 I cannot finde. Somewhat like∣wise was added by 
Euripides:
 
 as to set out the Argument of the Fable in the beginning of the Tragoedie, as you may ob∣serue; leading the Auditor, as it were, by the hand to the last and principall point of that one action which hee would re∣present, which by the glory of our nation, 
 
S
•
 
Philip Sidney,
 is not past by, as frivolous, without noting. These three were the Princes of Tragick stile, who exhibited to the People e∣very yeare at some certaine solemnities their Poems, striving who should get the victory by the approbation of Iudges, chosen for that purpose, called 
 
, and 
 
; Tenne in number, think some, at first, gathe∣ring out of 
Plutarch,
 in the life of 
Cimon,
 authoritie for it. Be∣cause


when hee had brought the Reliques of 
Theseus
 out of 
Scyrus, Aphepsion
 the 
Archon,
 in gratulation to him, chose not the Iudges as soone as the Theater was filled, and spectators placed; but presently after 
Cimon
 entred the Theatre with nine more of his fellow Captaines, of each Tribe one, after accustomed sacrifice he swore them Iudges, who gaue the vi∣ctory to 
Sophocles,
 but then young; for which 
Aeschylus
 grie∣ving went into 
Sicilie,
 where he died, and was buried neare 
 
Gelas.
 But out of this place we cannot proue that the num∣ber of these Critick Iudges was alwaies Tenne. This we ac∣knowledge done in testimonie of high acceptation of 
Cimons
 service. And yet in iudgement upon Tragoedians, the number might be so great. For there seemes to bee a difference be∣tweene the Iudges of Tragoedies and Comoedies. The num∣ber of Tragick Iudges, grant we haply to be such as we speak; the power incontrolable, as from whom there was no appeal to others. 
 
Cum ne{que} provocatio ab iis 
sset, ne{que} de quibus illi iudicarent, magistratus caeteri sententiam pronunciarent.
 The Comick Iudges were in number but fiue, from whence came the Greek proverb, 
 
. 
sub quin{que} Iudicibus lis est.
 The 
 Scholiast of 
Aristophanes
 speakes some∣what uncertaine. Iudges, quoth he, passe censures upon the Comoedians, & they who had fiue voices were happy. Those wereall. For if there had beene tenne of them too, it would haue made nothing to the Poets felicity to haue had equall voices. For the odde gaue a great stroake. Hence wishes the 
Chorus
 in the behalfe of the Poet▪ 
, to bee Victor by one voice onely. Another difference is that, whereas the Tragick Iudges had free liberty of suffrages be∣yond the power of the people, the Comick had not: For whē 
Aristophanes
 taught his 
, they so much tooke the peo∣ple, that they applauded the Poet, cried him up Conquerour, 
, saies 
 
Aelian
 and commanded the Iudges to write 
Ari∣stophanes
 uppermost (as the fashion was, which 
 
Aristopha∣nes



cals 
, the most excellent first, the next to him second, and next to him third (which was no small praise, according to that of 
Quintilian,
 as I remember, 
Hone∣st
m est in secund is tertii
ve consistere
) and no other. For which cause I suppose the Poets before reciting, were wont to sacrifice, and pray for the favour of the Iudges and specta∣tours. 
 
Aristophan.




—Where the Scholiast interpret
 
 truly as it is to be understood, 
, to supplicate. And good reason. For if they pleased not the people in reciting, they were overwhelmed with stones. To which use 
 
Ari∣stophanes
 points. saying—
; nay sometime would they hisse them, which they terme 
 and 
, some∣time stamp them out of the Theater, which they call 
▪ by 
 
Pollux
 interpreted 
. Ano∣ther difference is that 
 the Comick Iudges were punished if they iudged not right, the Tragick not so. And for these rea∣sons haue 
ome conjectured, nay positiuely written, that their Iudges were of two sorts, old and new, in which matter, if there be place for a coniecture, mine is, that they confounded both, making no oddes betweene the Critick Iudges of Tra∣goedies and Comoedies. But of this, Reader, you may deter∣mine as your Authors shall afford authority. Before Iudges, as I said, the Poets in emulation presented their labours, and they who in their opinion lost the day, were said * 
, by 
 
Casaubon
 interpreted 
non stare.
 The time of exhibiting their Tragoedies, were the holy daies of 
Bacchus
 called 
Dionysia in agris,
 or 
Lenaea,
 in the moneth 
Posideon,
 on the 
Anthesteria,
 or 
Dionysia
 in 
Limnis,
 in the 
 
Anthesterion,
 on 
Diony∣sia
 in 
urbe
 in the moneth 
Elaphebolion,
 to which I finde added the 
Panathenaea
 by 
Thrasylus
 in 
 
Laertius,
 which some deny, yet the same write that when 
Sophocles
 exhibited but one, it was at this festivall. I say but one, because it was a custome a∣mong the Poets of ancient daies to entertaine their people


with more plaies then one. 
Mos autem Tragicorum Graeco∣rum fuit Athenis, ut modo singulas committerent fabulas, modo plures,
 saies 
 
Casaubon:
 Sometime in the same yeare three, and then was it called 
; sometime foure, and then they stiled it 
, 
 
. Whereof, saies mine Author, the fourth was a Saty∣ricall play, the three other now treating of the fortunes of one and the same man, as those of 
Aeschylus,
 named therefore 
Orestia;
 to wit. 
. Which are all extant; the fourth was 
Proteus Satyricus.
 At other times they were not of the same subiect, as that of 
Euripides. Medea. Philoctetes. Dictys.
 The fourth was 
, saies the Author of the argument to 
Medea.
 Where the interpreter seemes to me not to reach to the expression of the Greek word 
; 
Messores, Satyros;
 he ought to haue rendred it thus, 
Messores, Drama Satyricum.
 For that the word beares this sense is sufficiently dilucidated by 
 
Casaubon.
 That the grea∣test task of action lay on the 
Chorus,
 is as apparent as the Sun at noone. The number of them in Comoedies were twentie foure, and six 
iuga
 (each 
iugum
 consisting of foure; but 
 foure, each 
 six men) in Tragoedies fifty, untill the time of 
Aeschyius
 his 
Eumenides,
 the number of which so 
∣ed the people, 
 that the children and younger sort fainted, & the women suffered abortion; for which reason, saies 
Pollux,
 the number was lessened (which some deny) by law. They were by that Act brought to fifteene, fiue 
iuga:
 I say 
iuga,
 be∣cause they were divided into 
, and 
 was when the 
Chorus
 entred by three, & then it was called 
, by file. 
, when they came on the stage in ranke fiue at a time; and this they terme 
. Sometime one of them entred alone, which they say 
. Of interlocutors the ancients for the most part never had aboue three; but if a fourth spake, that they named 
; and if the 
Chorus
 supplied the part of a fourth actor, it was stiled 
. To speak of the severall verses of Tragoedies, is 
actum agere:



and I had rather speak of the action, then the art in composing and yet not much, only this of their motions, termed 
 & 
, saies the Scholiast of 
Pindar,
 is a turning from the right hand to the left, in analogie to the motion of the u∣niverse 
, from the East to the West; because 
Homer
 calls the East the right hand, the West the left: Contrary to the Hebrews, who terme the South 
,
 which signifies the right hand, and the North they counted the left. 
 was a turning from the West to the East, that is from the left hand to the right, as the Planets moue. Another posture they had in their 
Epodes,
 for (if it be so in Tragoedies, as in Lyrick Musick, which I beleeue) to expresse the immobility of the earth they stood still. They used 
Epodes
 for the most part at the end of the Acts, when the players avoided the stage. Thus much of Tragoedies; the authors of which were highly of old esteemed of; insomuch as after the dismall discomfeit of the 
 
Athenians
 in 
Sicelie,
 they were relieued, who could repeat somewhat of 
Euripides.
 Nay, by a law made by 
 
Lycurgus,
 & established in 
Athens, Aeschylus, Sophocles,
 and 
Euripides
 had statues erected in brasse for the continuation of their me∣morie. After Tragoedies had proceeded to perfection, Co∣moedies were with great applause taught, as 
 
Horace,


Successit vetus his Comoedia, non sine multa Laude—


He saies, 
vetus Comoedia,
 because a Comoedy was divided in∣to three, or if you please so to speak, two sorts, the Old and New. I said three sorts, because 
 the old was different from it selfe. The meaning is, that the old Comoedie, of which 
Su∣sarion
 (by some named 
annyrion,
) was author, tended onely to laughter, being without order and decencie. For the 
Cho∣rus
 now walking, now dancing about the smoaking Altars, sung 
simplex carmen,
 some naked verse, saies 
Donat.
 Which by 
Cratinus
 was redressed; for he ordained three Actors, and mingled with his sport, profit, I meane for instruction. For un∣der the 
Democracie
 it was lawfull to exagitate and propose


for a laughing stock Captaines & corrupt Iudges, Citizens gi∣ven to bribery, and such as lead a dissolute life, naming the men upon the stage and fitting the Actor
 with vizards, bea∣ring the shape of those whom they intended to deride. But as the state grew to an 
Oligarchie,
 that licence was taken a∣way, 
Eupolis
 being cast into the sea by those, against whom he wrote his Comoedie 
Baptae,
 and so drowned. Nay, there was a law enacted not 
 
, to name any whom they wrote the Comoedie of. Of which 
Horace,




▪ Sed in vitium libertas excidit, & vim


Dignam lege regi. Lex est accepta, Chorus{que}


Turpiter obticuit sublato iure nocendi.




But when 
Alexander
 of 
Macedon
 grew potent and a terror to 
Greece,
 the Poets fearing least any of their abusiue wi
 might displease the great 
Macedonian,
 they changed the Ar∣gument of their plaies, and insteed of abusing states & people, they fell upon ancient Poets, or some part of Historie not truly written, personating the Actors so as to bee most ridiculous: 
 sometimes scoffing on the stage at meane men, and this they termed 
, the new Comoedie. But afterward it was a peece of the 
Athenian
 policie to forbid that the people should be tossed on the stage, unlesse they would themselues, saies 
 
Xenophon;
 knowing that none were wont to be brought thither but▪ the wealthier sort, 
. Some are of opinion that no Player came on the stage untill thirtie or fortie; I dispute not the matter; sure I am that 
So∣phocles
 taught his first Tragoedie at twentie eight, in which doubtlesse himselfe came on the stage. It being among the 
Athenians
 no disgrace▪ as the 
Romans
 accounted it, to appeare there. 
 
Aemilius Probus. In scenam verò prodire, & populo esse spectaculo nemini in eisdem gentibus (Graecis) fuisse turpi∣tudini: quae omnia apud nos partim infamia, partim humilia, at{que} ab honestate remota, ponuntur.
 The place where the peo∣ple beheld these plaies and pastimes was in the market place▪ 
 where they nayled scaffolds to a black ▪poplar tree. For in


ancient time they had no Theater of stone, onely of wood which they call 
.

These were built by some, who upon some consideration of money admitted any to a seat, named therefore 
 
. Once it seemes places were not hired. But there grew great enormities and abuses. For striving to get places, there rose wrangling and brawles, and fights; wherefore the 
Attick
 Se∣nate ordained that each place should be hired for two 
oboli
 (in the Consulship of 
Diophantus,
 a 
Drachme,
 say some, whence rose the Proverb, 
 
; because at the establishing of it, there fell haile) This mony they called 
, from 
: because with it they did 
, buy a seat to behold the shew exhibited. Now because the poore people had not to giue, & so were deprived of the spectacle, 
Pericles
 desiring to be popular, made a law that they should receiue out of the Cities revenues two 
oboli
 each man. 
 For the right of exacting which mony, they were to produce the authority of the 
Lexiarchicall Rolles,
 as appeares out of 
De∣mosthenes.
 For the distribution of this were certaine officers appointed, named 
. But afterwards 
Apollodorus
 stroue that in warre and publike necessity, these 
ummes might be imployed in military affaires, but hee endeavoured in vaine; 
Eubulus
 in 
lattery to the people, enacting it capi∣tall for any that should attempt that which 
Apollodorus
 did; Which makes 
 
Demosthenes
 desist, willing, yet not daring to perswade to convert the money to the use of the Armie. But see the folly of them! 
 For they spent as much on these sports as in obtaining the Masterie and liberty of 
Greece.
 And the end was miserable: for they became 
, and so put their necks under the 
Macedonian
 yoake. 
 
Iustin
 of the death of 
Epaminondas. Siquidem amisso, quem aemulari consu∣everant, in segnitiem torporem{que} resoluti, non ut olim in classem exercitus{que}, sed in dies fest
s, apparatus{que} ludorum, redditus




publicos effundunt: & cum auctoribus nobilissimis,

 inter otia Graecorum, sordidum & obscurum an
ea Ma

 Of the Theater I will say little, as al∣so of the stage: Only that the places in the Theater were not promis
uous. For there was a distinction betweene the Se∣natours and younger sort. The Senators was named 
 
 among which it is probable the Iudges had the first place, as 
 
Pollux.
 The seats for the youth were called 
. One part of the stage was 
Orchestra,
 in which was 
, either a Tribunal or an Altar. That upon all their stages there was an Altar sacred to 
Bacchus,
 is apparant out of 
Donat:
 he saies it stood on one side of the stage, before the doores, 
Pollux:
 who names it 
. There was moreover a Table called 
, on which before the time of 
Thespis
 some body ascending in the Poets place, did answere the 
Chorus.
 
 
Plutarch
 thinks 
 to be derived from 
, because that before the buil∣ding of Theaters the ancients embracing 
Musick
 only for in∣stitution of youth and praise of their Gods, sung the commen∣dation of good men, and honour of their Deities in Temples.










LIBER TERTIVS.




CAP. 1.




 De Legum latoribus Atticis. 
. De sanciendis Legibus.




A
S 
 
Iustin
 hath beene too forward in relating the mutation of the 
Athenian
 government, passing by the perpetuall and decennal Con∣suls, and naming only the yearely: so hath he erred in the originall of their Lawes, ma∣king 
Solon
 the father of them. But it seemes otherwise. For, as 
 
Gerardus
 hath observed, 
Theseus
 gaue Lawes to the 
Athenians.
 And 
 
Plutarch
 witnesseth, that when he congregated the 
Attick
 people, and constituted a 
Democracie,
 he reserved only to himselfe the government of war and custodie of the Lawes. 
. Adde to this, that before the knowledge of letters & writing, it was a cu∣stome among the ancients to sing their Laws, least they might forget them, used in the daies of 
 
Aristotle
 by the 
Agathyrs
,
 a people neare to the 
Seythians.
 Whence afterwards the


rules of Musick, for the true keeping of time, singing, & play∣ing, are supposed to bee called 
. Neither may it bee thought otherwise, because all the notes of the 
 
Lydian, Hy∣polydian,
 &c. 
Dorick, Hypodorick, &c. Phrygian, Hupophry∣gian, 
onick, &c.
 songs were distinguished by the Alphabet. Yet 
 
Plutarch
 is of opinion, that they derived the word from those bounds, which the Musitians of old prescribed, for the tuning of voices or instruments, least they might be confoun∣ded; and therefore he calls it 
. 
 
Idem.
 
. The 
Greekes,
 saies 
 
C
cero,
 think the cause of this word, 
ius suum cui{que} tribuendo,
 intimating 
, which signifies to distribute, because the Law giues every man his due. Thus see we, that there were Lawes of yore, let 
 
Iustin
 say, 
Nullae civitati leges tunc 
rant, quia libido regum pro legibus habebatur;
 That the Citie was without Law, be∣cause the wills of Kings were Lawes. In succeeding ages, & b
fore 
Solon
 too, 
Draco
 gaue Lawes, living about the three 
 hundred and ninth 
Olympiad.
 His Acts, saies 
 
Aelian,
 were called 
. Now 
, by 
 
Vlpian
 is interpreted 
. A Law giving in precept how to make a Law. And yet 
 
Aristotle
 calls them 
, giving them this commendation, that they are not worth remembrance, but for their great se∣verity. Which gaue occasion to 
 
Herodicus
 to say, that they were not the Lawes of man, 
, in a double sense of the word, which is also put for a Dragon. And 
 
Demades,
 that they were not written with black, but bloud. For he pu∣nished every peccadillo almost with death, those that were convicted of idlenesse, or stealing of pothearbs, alike the sacri∣legious and man-slayers. Wherefore were they made of none effect by 
Solon.
 
or he abrogated all, except those which concerned murther, intituled 
 
. Him succeeded 
 
Solon,
 a man so well tempered, and equall be∣twixt the Commons and the Peeres, that hee was beloued of


both, having still a care, least while hee should side with one, he might displease the other. Whom, for his uprightnesse, 
 
Iuvenal
 stiles 
Iustum,
 and for the care of the Republique, which 
 
Demosthenes
 averres he had in all his Lawes, 
 
Ari∣stophanes
 termes, 
, a lover of the people. 
 
Plato
 brings him learning his Lawes from a 
Barbarian:
 And 
 
Plu∣tarch
 tels us that he travelled after wards into 
Aegypt.
 But it seemes by 
 
Ammianus Marcellinus,
 that in the making of his Lawes he had the approbation and iudgement of the 
Ae∣gyptian
 Priests. 
Et Solon adiutus sententiis Aegypti Sacerdo∣tum, latis iusto moderamine legibus, Romano quo{que} Iuri maxi∣mum addidit firmamentum.
 
 
Diodorus Siculus
 relates two things brought from thence to the 
Athenians
 by him. First, that all the 
Aegyptians
 were compelled to bring to the go∣vernours of the countries their names written, and by what meanes they sustained themselues; wherein if any were found false, or that lived by uniust gaine, hee fell into danger of life. Secondly, it was a custome among them, that payment should be made only with the goods of the debtor, and that the body should not suffer. For they thought the estate alone to be subiect to the creditor, the bodie addicted to the Cities in which they lived. Neither was it fit that Souldiers, who were to undergoe hazard for their country, should for usurie be committed to prison, or the country bee in ieopardie for the avarice of some one man. Which induced 
Solon
 to make the first decree, as 
 
Laertius
 and 
 
Plutarch
 say, of freeing the bodies; which, if there were not where withall to satisfie the craving loaner, were compelled to serue. Hee therefore cut off all 
use,
 
 as some write, or else 
 lessened the burthen of it, making it more moderate by his Law 
: so called from 
, to shake off, and 
, an heavy weight. Forgi∣ving himselfe first, 
 as 
Laertius,
 seaven talents; or, as 
 
Plu∣tarch,
 fiue. But this seemes to haue beene done for the avoi∣ding of the aspersion cast upon him as accessarie to the iniu∣ries of some, who having an inkling of his intent, borrowed


much money with hope of never making restitution. 
 
Casau∣bon
 is conceited, that this was not his first exploit, but long af∣ter he had sate at the sterne of the Weale-publique. Yet it seemes probable; There being no more compendious way to make a man popular, then to giue liberty to the common peo∣ple. Which he, to bring in an innovation of Lawes, did wil∣lingly invent; and they afterwards lovingly accepted. For in testimonie of their approbation, they kept a festivall named 
 
. Here likewise may you obserue the ancient flat∣tery of the 
Athenians
 towards their owne vices, putting gil∣ded names on those things, which themselues were ashamed of, calling 
 
 &c. as our blades name drunkennesse good fellowship; whores, shee sinners; and niggardise, thrif∣tinesse; springing from this root of 
Solons,
 who called 
. 
 To these Lawes two ends were proposed, mutuall commerce, & direction of behaviour to∣wards the state. 
 To curb wickednesse, and uniustice; and to punish offenders that they might be bettered. And although they were the ordinances of 
Draco
 and 
Solon,
 yet may wee fitly call them the 
Athenian
 Civill Law. Each Citie, as 
 
Iu∣stinian
 teaches, giving a denomination unto her Statutes. 
Nam si quis velit Solonis vel Draconis leges appellare ius civile A∣theniensium, non erraverit.
 They were engraven in tables of wood called 
 
, triangular, if wee may beleeue the 
 Scholiast of 
Aristophanes,
 who quotes 
Aristotle
 and 
Apollo∣dorus,
 witnessing that they were called 
 also, 
, frō the elevation. 
 Some are of opinion that the Rites pertaining to the Gods and their wor∣ship were written in the 
Cyrbes,
 and Lawes belonging to men in the 
Axones. Apollodorus
 sayes that all decrees are called 
Cyrbes,
 because they were written in stone, and so set up, 
 which from their standing, were termed 
. I knowe that decrees, merits, praise and dispraise too, were written in▪ stone. Whence 
 
 may bee put for a Treatise


tending to a mans disgrace. But this by the way. These Ta∣bles were kept in the 
Acropolis,
 translated afterwards to the 
Prytanaeum
 by 
Ephialtes,
 where to the dayes of 
 
Plutarch,
 some reliques of them were to be seene. The 
Autographon
 or coppie written with his owne hand was not removed, but those that were transcribed by them. Because in matters of doubt and controversie they might haue recourse unto them. 
 For the distinction of which, some think that 
 is used in 
Demosthenes
 for that in the 
Prytaneum.
 Others for the Law in the lower part of the table; but to mee it seemes improbable, for then the number of the table ought to bee ci∣ted; and indeed, one Table sometime could not containe a Law. For we read in 
 
Plutarch,
 that the eighth Law was cut in the thirteenth Table. I am not averse from the guesse of 
Petitus,
 who supposes the Oratour to meane the Law which afterward he quotes; not ignorant of the opinion of some, who think that it is to be understood of the under line. For the Lawes being written 
, 
couverso sive retrogrado literarum ordine,
 saies 
 
Silburgius;
 which 
 
Pausanias
 ex∣plaines, 
, from the right hand to the left, 
 or more significantly, 
. When the second verse be∣ginnes at the end of the former, as in the race which they call 
Diaulus,
 or if I shall speak nearest to the word, as husbandmē turne their Oxen when they plough, as for example. 
. 


See those that haue written of divers waies of writing.


They therefore take the lower, that is tvrned, 
. After this manner were the Lawes written, and doubtlesse there were some customes as strong as Lawes. For although the 
Lacedaemonians
 governed by tradition of custome▪ and the 
Athenians
 by written statutes, as 
 
Iosephus,
 yet surely had their customes great force, insomuch as 
 
Aristophanes
 uses 
 for 
.

. So did the 
 
Greekes



divide their Lawes into 
, written and un∣written. The unwritten, 
sine scripto ius venit, quod usus ap∣probavit,
 vse. The 
 Interpreter of 
Sophocles
 thus. 
. A Law is a writ∣ten custome, and a custome an unwritten Law. Besides these there were decrees, which they termed 
, 
psephis∣mata,
 a word used by 
 
Cicero,
 nothing different, 
. 
 
Demosthenes.
 who meanes in ver∣tue and power. For they differ much. 
 A Law maintaines iu∣stice once found, common for ever. A 
Psephisma
 followes the necessitie of the time, as it differs in events: it directs not warlike affaires, but is applied unto the occasion of armes, and as lawes can bee abrogated, so degrees changed. And here ought we to note, 
 that no decree is greater then a Law. Of decrees there were two sorts; 
 
, such as the Senate by it selfe established, which were but of twelue moneths continuance; to the confirming of which, the people were not convocated, or their consent required, termed 
 
, which 
Demosthenes
 proues to be 
, 
Ulpian.
 
. Like to the edicts of the Roman Praetors which lasted but a yeare. 
 
Cicero. Qui plurimum tribuunt edicto, Praetoris edictum legem annuam esse dicunt.
 In other decrees the opinion and good liking of the people was asked, for the giving of the authority unto them, which endured in force a longer time. 
 
. And therefore we may easily knowe a 
probuleuma
 from a decree of the peoples confirming, by this observation. 
 only, giues us to wit, that it is a 
probuleuma.
 
, in the beginning of a decree, shewes it to be 
. The Senate alwaies sate in consulta∣tion about that which was to be enacted, whether any dam∣mage might accrew to the State by it or no, the Law com∣manding that no decree should goe forth without deliberati∣on. 
 
. Which done, the 
Prytaneis
 took certaine Tables and wrote on them



Such or such a day about such a time there should be an assembly to consult of these and these affaires:
 and this they called 
 
. When then they were assembled▪ and the people pu∣rified, the decree was read; which if the people allowed of▪ stood; if not, decayed. It was forbidden that any should raze out a Decree of any Table. And hee was brought in question of life, who should presume in making a decree to pretend a fallacie. Now because future time might haply per∣ceaue some inconveniences to arise by oversight in their Law giuer, and that as abuses should happen, which in his daies were not discerned, so there would be a necessitie of making new statutes: It was ordained therefore that every yeare there should be 
, which 
 
Ulpian
 expounds 
. A consideration of what ought to be done concerning the Lawes. 
 The manner was thus. Every eleaventh day of Iuly in the assembly after the Crier had made his prayers, as his fashion was, and shall anon be spoken of, the Lawes were read over in order. First those which concerned their Senate, next the weale-publique, and thirdly the nine 
Archons,
 & afterwards the other Magistrates. Then was it demanded if there were Lawes enough for the Senate, and so for the Common-weale, &c. If any of the Lawes in force were to be abrogated, it was adiournied untill the last of the three daies of the three Cōvocations. On which the 
Prytanes,
 appointed for the revising and reciting of the Lawes, were to take the matter in hand. The 
Proedri
 chiefe of the Assembly, were to 
 acquaint them with it. Fiue men at the first meeting, were chosen out of all the 
Athenians,
 who should patronize the Law to be abolished; and accor∣ding to the iudgement of the 
Nomothetae,
 chosen out of the Councell of fiue hundred, was the businesse carried, that the Lawes should be of none effect, or full strength. Whosoever would bring in a new Law, was to write in a Table, 
 
 
Demosthenes,
 the forme thereof, and set it up at the Sta∣tutes of the 
Heroes
 before spoken of, 
 



which standing in a place conspicuous, that some certaine daies before the Sessions, any Citizen might read what was to be handled; and if any so pleased, he might at the proposall of the Law declare his minde either for▪ or against it, as at the preferring of 
a Bill in our High Court of Parliament,
 where it is not denyed any 
Burges,
 or 
Knight
 of a shire, to speak his o∣pinion 
pro
 or 
con,
 either with any whole Bill or some part thereof, or in opposition to it, or some one clause. Provided likewise, that hee, who attempted to enact a new Statute, should take care for the disanulling of the old, that might con∣tradict it, otherwise hee came within the compasse of 
▪ a writ of 
Transgression of the Lawes:
 which was of two sorts. First, when time is not observed in writing thē, 
 
. Next when one is made that is ad∣verse to a former. And if it so hapned, that any perswaded the people to make a Law that was not commodious to the weale-publique, hee might bee questioned within 
 a yeares space▪ 
 but if the time was expired, he could not. 
 Nay, they slew 
Eudemus,
 a 
Cydiathenian,
 for bringing in a Law they li∣ked not; scarce different in that one example from the 
Lo
ri;
 among whom, he that would propose a Law, should doe it, his neck adorned with a halter, that if his request pleased not, hee straight way powred out his soule under the hands of the hangman. Their Orators, which are called 
 
, be∣cause they lead the people with their Rhetorick and flattery, wrote Lawes and decrees, as we learne out of 
 
Demosthenes;
 and therefore are they deciphered by 
 
Athenaeus,
 
.






CAP. II.




 De Comitiis. 
 & 
. &c.




THE Assemblies were called by the 
Prytaneis
 four
 time 
 
 thirtie dayes. 
 In the first they confir∣med


the Magistrates in their offices, if all things were mana∣ged well by them, otherwise they put them out. They heard publique causes, looked into confiscate goods, and possessions left by inheritance. In the second, any one with leaue might freely speake of private and publique affaires. In the third they gaue audience to Ambassadours, who before ought to de∣liver their letters to the 
Prytaneis.
 In the fourth, they treated of holy things, such as belonged to their Gods and worship of them. The first meeting was the eleaventh day of the 
Pry∣tanea;
 the second the twentieth; the third the thirtieth; the fourth the three and thirtieth. I finde a difference betweene the 
 Scholiast of 
Aristophanes
 and 
Vlpian
 in the daye on which they came together, one making the first day of the Moneth to be the day on which the first assembly was, the o∣ther
 the eleaventh of the 
Prytanea,
 which seemes truest. And whereas they both write that every month there were three lawfull assemblies, to wit, on the first, tenth, thirtieth; or tenth, twentieth, thirtieth, we are not so to reckon them▪ but according to the 
Prytanea,
 it being the 
Prytanes
 charge to con∣gregate the people. They seeme to haue been called 
, because in them they did 
, establish decrees, as the 
 Scholiast of 
Aristophanes.
 Other assemblies there were which are termed 
 
, when war, or any sudden accident troubled the State, then the people were cal∣led together over and aboue those foure times in a 
Prytanea.
 They are styled 
, because the people of their own ac∣cord met on the other dayes; but when they would haue a Convocation some went about the Citie and called them. There is likewise 
 
, when they were summoned out of the fields to goe to the Assembly. It seemes to me that the Crier in the streets on their lawfull assemblies gaue some token when they should hasten; and so much 
 
Aristophanes
 witnesses, bringing in the women speaking that it is high time to be stirring, because the Cryer—
, had cryed the second time. And indeed need was th
e of some


warning, & compulsion too; for so slow were they in com∣ming to assemblies, that the 
Logistae
 were faine to thong them to the meetings, as the Schol. of 
Aristophanes
 on these words, 
 
. Sometimes they took a rope, and dying it with red earth, they sent two slaues into the market place, who should one of the one side of the way, & the other of the opposite, pursue the people, and to whose chance it fell to be marked with the paint, paid a certaine peece of money. Hence in the 
 Comoedian -▪ 
. Vp and downe they shun the cord stained with Vermilion. And againe—
. 
Iupiter,
 the red earth which flew a∣bout made laughter. 
 Sometimes would they take Hurdles▪ and barracado all the streets except those that led to the 
Ec∣clesia:
 Sometimes take away all their saleable wares which they brought into the market, least peoples intent on their traffique should absent themselues from the Assemblies. Whē they had met oft times the company would bee dismissed at some prodigious signe, as thunder, lighning, tempest, and the like, which they called 
 
. : 
 and earthquakes, or o∣ther occasions, deferring the Assemblies meeting untill the next day. When they were come together, and the Senate ready to sit, one man sacrificed; which rites were called 
 
, because they were done at the entry of the Councell. 
 
Vlpian.
 
. I will not iustly say that it was the purification made with a young pig, before the bench was sate▪ and yet I may presume to averre it; the Grammarian that interprets 
 
Aristophanes
 witnessing that immediatly preceding the Sessions this cu∣stome was observed by one, whom they named 
, from 
, which signifies cleansing, because by that he purged the Assemblie, Theater, and congresse of the people. After they were sate, 
 the Cryer did pray for the good of the people▪ 
 and cursed those who should offer to de∣ceiue the Senate or people. After this, hee spake with a lowd


voice, 
 
; Who will make a speech; where∣upon one of the 
 Elders arose that gaue his verdict, it being not permitted to any to utter his opinion, before the reverend hoary head had spent this iudgement▪ Whence by 
 
Demosthe∣nes
 they are stiled 
, those that were wont to orate. After they had finished their sayings, others had leaue to de∣clare themselues. Neither must we omit the fashion they had to exclude all private men from their assemblies sometimes, when the Senate alone sate, or the 
Areopagitic all
 Councell; sometimes to debarre all servants, strangers, and men depri∣ved of their liberties from their convents, which at other times they admitted, and then was it called 
 
, an open Theater to all commers. The place of meeting was called 
, 
Pnyx,
 
▪ from the frequent concurse of people there. It stood on a rock, and therefore by 
Aristophanes
 is called 
. 345. Sch. 
. There was a stipend for them that came to As∣semblies, as you may see in 
Demosth. contra Timoc.
 And

SECT. I.




 De Tribunalibus Atticis, & primum de Senatu 
.




VVHen the mutinie betweene the faction of 
Mega∣cles & Cylo
 disturbed the 
Attick
 common wealth, 
Solon
 perswaded the people that those, whom for their auda∣citie in drawing away the suppliants from the Altars they named 
, should undergoe iudgement, there were cho∣sen 
 three hundred men, 
▪ according to their worth, to sit upon the case. But these were not a perpetuall iudicato∣rie For when the people murmured at the cutting off of the


usurie money, then was the 
l
 Grand Councell ordained; out of every Tribe, which were then but foure, an hundred cho∣sen, who by their advice should direct the people in those things which were to be handled, least any thing should be in∣ducted, or proposed to the Assembly, without due considera∣tion. Who from their office in a 
Democracie,
 
 
Aristotle
 saies are more properly called 
, but where the Rout rules, 
. But when 
Clist henes,
 who by 
Plutarch
 is termed 
, had augmented the number of the Tribes from foure to tenne, eightie six yeares after 
Solon's
 Lawes were received, he made the number fiue hundred, ta∣king fiftie of every Tribe, which doubled ten times make up the fumme. This Councell by 
Aristotle
 is described 
. 
The Mistresse of all the rest,
 and I am not of opi∣nion that 
 in 
 
Plutarch,
 is to bee understood of the 
Areopagus,
 as if that were aboue the Senate, but as instituted first by 
Solon,
 and so related by the Author. And yet I knowe 
 one writes. 
Tam dignitate, fama, quàm officio, secundum post Areopagitas locum obtinu
.
 To this Councell none was cho∣sen under thirtie yeares of age, which time is stiled 
 by 
 
Libanius.
 And doubtlesse 
 
Plutarch
 iustifies it speaking that 
Demosthenes
 wrote his Orations against 
Andro∣tio, Timocrates, Aristocrates,
 
, when hee had not attained to the managing of state businesse, because he wanted two or three of thirty yeares. Agreeing to this is 
 
Iuneus,
 who saies that 
Solon
 admitted none very young, though very wise to Magistracy or Councell. Nay the 
 Scholiast of 
Aristophanes
 tels us that greene heads were not permitted to speak publikely. The Law prohibiting any to at∣tempt it under fortie, or as some say (which is truest) thirtie, on these words,


.


Which to be otherwise understood by some, is not hidden from me▪ They were called likewise 
, as well as 
, and their Tribunall 
, from the word 
 
,


which signifies to throng together, because the people were frequent there. But the more probable reason is, 
 
, because the place was open and exposed to the Sunne. And in respect of this 
 
Aristophanes
 makes that cold conceit branded by 
Didy∣mus,
 
, 
In the morning thou shalt
 
 in the sun shine. At their admission they had this oath given them. 
 
. 
&c. I will giue sentence according to the Lawes, and decrees of the people of A∣thens, and Councell of fiue hundred; I will not consent to bee a Tyrant, or bring in an Oligarchie: Neither shall my approbation be to any that will dissolue the Democracie of Athens by speech or decree I will not cut off private use, or suffer a division of the Athenian lands or houses. I will not bring back exild men, or those that are condemned. I will not thrust out of the citie any innocent against the Lawes and Statutes of the Athenians and Senate of fiue hundred▪ neither by my selfe or suffer any other. I will not create a Magistrate, who hath not given an account of his former office, whether of the nine Archons, or agents for the holy things, or they, who at the same day are chosen with the nine Archons by lot, Ambassadors and assistants. Neither shall the same man beare the same office twice, or two in one yeare. I will not take gifts for iudgement, neither my selfe or other for me, or others with my privacy, by fraud or deceit. I am not younger then thirtie. I will heare both parties, the accuser & defendant alike▪ I will passe iudgement aright on the thing prosecuted. I sweare
 
by
 Iupiter, Neptune, Ceres. *There is also another oath which they took; some clauses whereof, wee haue left in re∣cord. 
To ratifie the Lawes of Solon. Plutarch in Solone, pag.
 62. 
To giue counsell for the best of the people. To advise according. 
 the Lawes. I will not binde any Athenian who shall giue three 
 of the same revennewes, unlesse for treason, or hee con∣spire the subversion of state popular, or buy custome, o
 b
 enga∣ged, or gather publique money and not pay it. I will sit in that or∣der which lot shall direct me to. I will not permit any unlesse 
a∣nished,




to be accused or imprisoned for what is past.
 This last was made after the driving out of the 30 Tyrants, when 
 
Thra∣sybulus
 gaue them to oath 
, not to remember ancient wrongs, which they call 
. The authority of this Councel was great, for it handled causes of war, tributes, making of Lawes, civill businesses and events, affaires of con∣federates, collections of money, performance of sacred rites, accounts of offices discharged, appointing keepers for priso∣ners, and 
 of Orphans, as 
Xenophon.
 
 Resembling our
 Court of Parliament in 
England,
 by whose consent all Lawes are abrogated, new made, right and possessions of private men changed, formes of religion established, Subsidies, Tailes, Taxes, and impositions appointed, waights and measures al∣tered, &c. As not unlike also the 
Venetian Gran Consiglio,
 or Senate, of which the 
Contarene.
 
 
Tutta la cura del govern
 della Republica appertiene al Senato, &c.
 The whole manner of the Common wealths government belongeth to the Senate. That which the Senate determineth is held for ratified and inviolable. By their authoritie and rule is peace confirmed & war denounced. The whole rents and receipts of the Com∣monwealth at their appointment collected and gathered in, and likewise laid out againe and defrayed, &c. In a word, I may say of these fiue hundred, as 
 
Budaeus
 of the Parliament of 
France: Amplissimam 
am curiam causarum{que} omne genus disceptatricem iustam ac legitimam esse,
 that that Court is most ample, and iustly and equally decided all sorts of contro∣versies whatsoever. 
 To their charge was committed the making of new ships, for which at the yeares end they were to be rewarded by the people. To this alludes 
 
Aristophanes.
 
;—
 Without their consent could the people doe nought, as in∣deed they made not any thing 
sanctum
 against the peoples wills. Hence in 
 
Demosthenes,
 
. In testimonie of their preheminence are they termed 
 
. and 
 
. The Lords of sentence. In


time of warre they would send Commissions to their Cap∣taines, as they thought requisite. 
 Such as in the battaile be∣tweene the 
Lacedemonians
 and their country men in 
Tana∣gra,
 where fearing least 
Cimon
 banished by 
Ostracisme
 should betray them to the 
Laconians,
 they sent to the Commanders not to entertaine him in the Armie. This honour was not during terme of life, but every yeare changed. 
Apostolius.
 
. Which 
Anonymus in Arg. Orat. contra Androt.
 expresses by 
. The manner of choosing them is this. 
 The chiefe of every Tribe, on an appointed day before the beginning of the moneth 
Hecatombaeon,
 brought the names of all their Tribe that were capable of this dignitie, and cast them written into a vessell, and into another they put an hun∣dred white beanes and all the rest blacke; Then drawing out a name and then a beane, to whose chance the white beane fell to be extracted with his name, was designed Sena∣tor. This they did when they had but foure Tribes, and so foure hundred Senatours. But when they had ten Tribes, there could be but fiftie white beanes, to the making up of the tenth part of fiue hundred. This differs not from the ele∣ction observed by the 
 
Venetians
 upon the fourth day of De∣cember, when the names of al the young men that haue not by lot obtained the right of citizens, 'nor passed twentie fiue yeares old, are put into a pot, and carried unto the Prince, and there the same set before the Councellors, with which there is another pot, wherein are round balls equall with the num∣ber of the names written in the first, every one having his markes, the fift part of these bals is guilded with gold, the rest with silver. The Prince taketh out of the first pot the ball, which if it be of the golden sort, the young man whose name is drawne, is presently admitted to publique authority, they to whom the silver chance, loose it for that time, expecting it the ensuing yeare, unlesse in the meane space they accomplish twentie fiue, at which age all the young Noble men partake


of the Cities liberties. So every yeare the fift part of the yo
∣kers is chosen to giue voice with the other Citizens. The use in choosing I deem the same, & shall untill I finde authentike writers cōtradict it. But the number, as augmēted by 
Clisthe∣nes
 according to their Tribes, so by his successors. For when they added two, the number was encreased 100, by reason of the Tribes 
Antigonis
 & 
Demetrias
 after named 
Attalis
 and 
Ptolemais
 in honour to the Kings of that name which were benefactours to the State; 
 
 
 Out of these were their Iudges chosen; but such as were aboue three score yeares old. For although juniors were admitted into this company, yet none judged under that age. 
. To these was any businesse referred, of which the Senate and people were in suspense what to determine. 
 
Aristoph,
 
. When the Councell and people are in doubt how to iudge a great matter, They decree to deliver over the guilty to the Iudges. And no mar∣vell. For the office of a Iudge is 
, prerogatiue in sentence, saies 
 
Aristotle,
 that is, to state those Questions which the Law hath not decided. The order of their giving sentence before the third yeare of the ninety second Olym∣piad I knowe not. Afterwards they sate by t
rne in their own Tribes every one as his lot fell. For there being former∣ly ten Tribes in 
Athens,
 they chose out of each fiue men, and to which one of them the chance happened, he sate Iudge. I cannot say that the manner of election was like that of the 
 
Syracusans
 concerning the Priest of 
Iupiter,
 who taking the names of so many as were nominated, and casting them into a pot, created him, whose name should first be drawne, of that sacred function. But of our owne must I speake. 
 When then they were appointed, they met, every of them bringing with him a Table and a wand on which was written a letter that did betoken some Iudicatorie, (For there being ten Tribunals


every one of them was noted with a red letter, Α, Β, Γ, Δ, Ε &c to Κ over the dore) time calling them to sit, they drew lots, and he to whom A. was taken out, sate in the Court noted with A. and B with B, and so to K. This done, they shewed their lot to the 
Praeco
 of the Iudicatorie, who gaue them their Wand & Table▪ This they did, least any should rashly attempt to sit, and pervert Iustice. I know not whether I may better call that rod of authority a wand or staffe: because that 
 
, was a proverb used in di∣rision of the Iudges. 
 This staffe at the daies end they brought to the 
Prytanes,
 who gaue them their wages; But the 
 Scho∣liast teaches us otherwaies, saying that the 
Demagôgi
 paid them, it being manifest out of 
Cleon's
 words the Oratour, 
. - 
Iudges which I feed.
 Their pay was not alwaies the same, 
, 
 saies the Interpreter of 
Aristophanes.
 First they had 
obolum,
 which 
Calistratus,
 surnamed 
Parnytes
 was author of. Hence the proverb 
 
. Afterwards it was aug∣mented by 
Callicrates,
 and from him grew the word 
, it may bee for a pretty summe of money. Nay it
 changed, for now I read of 
 one, and anon 
 three, a 
 
Drachme
 to two. And therefore may wee conclude that it was sometime more, sometimes lesse. Thus having spoken a little of their Iudges, I proceed to their cases of Law, in which I shall adde.


When any had received wrong in 
Athens,
 it was their cu∣stome to make their cases knowne to a Magistrate, whose of∣fice it was to report to the Iudicatory. And this they did by a Table in which was written, 
 
. 
I accuse H. B. and cite him to the Court by W. N.
 not unlike the 
Romans
 proceeding, who brought the name of the delinquent to the Magistrate before the accusation; to which 
 
Plautus
 alludes. 
Ibo ego ad tres vi∣ros vestra{que} ibi nomina Faxo erunt.
- when this note was gi∣ven up, the Magistrate asked the Plaintiffe, whether hee had


witnesses and would prosequute the matter, who answering that he intended it, had thereupon authority to summon the Defendant to his appearance, and this hee did either by him∣selfe, or other, called therefore 
, 
 for 
 is 
, a bringing into suit. 
. The word signifies a witnesse also. For when they warned any to the Tribunall, they bad any that stood by to testifie that they had admonished them. 
 
. You may 
use 
 for an apparator, Sergeant, Bailiffe or the like. Sometimes they would runne streight to the Court, as it were headlong, in 
 
Demosthenes
 his phrase, sometimes the Suiter would forth with draw the Defendant, if he were loath to come, as you may see out of 
 
Aristophanes.
 
-. But if the partie could put in two 
, sufficient bayle, he was dismissed. Hence in the 
 Comoedian. 
. 
I will procure thee a couple of able sureties.
 Sometimes they would appoint a day of appearance, that might be a weeke or more, after the 
vocationem in ius,
 at which time if the Defendant were not personally at the Iudgment seat, he came within compasse of 
, 
a Writ of Eremodicium,
 refusall to come in and answer. Which was a∣voided by suing for a 
 in tenne daies after. For when the partie to defend was absent, hee was condemned 
indict
 
ausâ,
 so 
 
Budaeus
 expounds 
, by this therefore the case was renewed, and stood as at first▪ the sen∣tence that before past, being made of no force; and for this was it termed 
, 
 
, 
because in the beginning it seemed to carry some power, but at last was nothing:
 The businesse then made a new, the partie that was cast by an 
, after that he had obtained a 
, was 
 within two Moneths to set the Law on foot, which they terme 
, or else the sentence given before was ratified. Whosoever should offer to call any man to the Court, unlesse upon good grounds, was


liable to 
, a writ of molestation for a false cause. Having thus far proceeded, the Impleader gaue in a Libell, which held contents of his action, and the summe of the defendants answer. This the 
Greekes
 call 
 
, 
Antigraphen.
 Though I knowe also that all cases in law were termed 
 
. They tooke this course be∣cause the Defendant might knowe what to answer. And be∣cause it was ordinary in 
Athens
 for kna
es to accuse out of envy, which is 
, they made a 
 Law, that whosoever accused and had not the fift part of the voices, should be fined a thousand Drachmes. And he that could not proue his obje∣ctions was also punished in the purse a certaine summe; 
 which if he paid not at the constituted time, was foure fold; & if his abilitie reached not so far, he suffered imprisonment. At the presenting of the 
Antigraphe,
 testimonies were also delivered, (formes of which you shall often meet with in 
 
Demosthenes
) & a copie of an oath, which the Suiter gaue, in these words 
 
, that he would justly accuse. 
, that he would according to truth make his Apologie: and this they name 
 
. These wri∣tings were cast into a certaine coffer, forth comming as occa∣sion should require; all which 
 
Aristophanes
 in one verse comprehends. 
. They ioyned or put together oaths, citations, and testimonies. I so interpret it against the Scholiasts minde, who will haue. 
 to be exhortations given to the Plaintiffe and De∣fendant to come to composition. But I know that 
 
, to accuse, 
in ius rapere,
 
 and 
. The chest or coffer was called 
, and of this are the words of the Greeke Oratours to be understood 
 
. 
 
Theophrastus
 of a mad man that would entangle himselfe in any thing, 
. Having an 
Echinus
 in his lap
, and a bundle of libels in his hands. 
Pollux
 makes a different exposition of this oath from


that which other Grammarians doe, confounding, as is most probable, the 
 and 
 with 
. For 
 is that first oath which the Plaintife gave to prosequute, the party prosequuted to answere, which on the defendants side was called 
, and generally on both. 
 was a Sacrament taken by both, the Impleader that he did 
 
, follow the delinquent in law: the defen∣dant 
, to stand stifly to it that he did not trespasse. And yet 
 
Ulpian
 makes both these one. After this were they that sued one another admitted to the Iudicatory, it being first demanded of the Suiter 
 whether he would 
persequi,
 follow the suit, and had sufficient witnesse for evi∣
ence; in causes capitall it was asked if there were need of any, who could not then be present. This interrogation was termed 
 
. If then any thing was deficient the judgement was prorogued by an 
 
, or oath, which the Plaintif took, that for the present he could not performe it, but certainly would. 
 Perhaps for that time pretending sicknesse, death of friends, or some urgent necessity, on which their fortunes might depend. When then all things were ready, and at hand, they proceeded towards the Tribu∣nall, the Iudges first swearing 
 that they would give sen∣tence according to the Lawes, and in those things concerning which there were no Lawes, according to conscience and equity (which the Greeks call 
) 
 and of those things only concerning which they did debate. This oath seemes to have been taken at the Altar, from whence they brought their little stones (of these by and by) with which they gave sentence. 
 
Plutarch.
 
. The oath is called 
. Then went the Iudges to their seates, 
 neatly spread with mats, in Greeke 
 & 
, and all others being warned by the 
Praeco,
 to goe without the Bars▪ in this forme 
 
, they sate down. For we must know that the 
Athenian
 Iudicatories were en∣vironed in, as the Romans, with lettice I suppose, by them


called 
 
 
Cancellatae,
 by the Greekes 
 
 though 
 more properly signify the doore of the 
, before which was 
 a rope of fifty feet length drawn, and publique servants set, that none might enter, but who had businesse. The partition I think was but weak, and there∣fore by 
Demosthenes
 called 
. Within which none was permitted to come but the Iudges. And therefore
 when 
 
Demosthenes
 did long to hear 
Callistratus
 plead con∣cerning 
Oropus,
 he over entreated his 
Paedagogue
 that he would bring him, where he might have the happinesse to be an auditor. The 
Paedagogue
 therefore acquainted with the publique officers that opened the doores, 
, procured him a place where he might hear and not be seen, 
. When then the Iudges had gone within the bars, least any should be wanting the 
Praeco
 cried 
 
, if any Iudge be without the doore of the place of Iudgement, let him enter. 
 Because if any came after the case began to be pleaded, he could not have admission. Being then seated the Crier read the Inditement, 
, (a copy of some part of which you have in 
 
Demosthenes.
 
; &c.) in which according to the cu∣stome of the 
 old 
Aegyptians,
 were given up to the court in writing all the reasons of accusation, the wrong received and the manner of it, with an estimation of the dammage; The severall heads of which the Iudges wrote downe, least the Impleader and defendant should swerve from what they had in hand. Then stood up the Suiter in a pulpit on the left hand of the Tribunall, and spake an accusatory oration, made for the most part by some of the 
Attick
 Oratours: which use brought in by 
 
Antiphon
 the 
Rhamnusian,
 
 
Clemens
 of 
A∣lexandria
 calls 
, 
 
Cicero, scri∣bere aliis causas, quibus in judiciis uterentur,
 such as 
Lysias
 is reported to have done for 
Socrates:
 Which least it should exceed in length, was limited to a certain time, by a vessell,


in the bottome of which was a small hole for water to runne, as sand doth in our houre-glasses, thence called 
, in∣to which was poured an equall measure of water; and least there should be deceit, there was an officer made for that purpose, named 
 
, filling alike for the Impleader and answerer. 
 When therefore the glasse was runne, it was not lawfull for them to speak farther, 
 nay for scantinesse of time they were com∣pelled to passe by many things; and for that reason were they chary of their water, bidding that it should be stopped at the reciting of Lawes, or the like, which 
Demosthenes
 intimates in-

Aristophanes.
 
 
Apuleius. At tu interea dum legit, a∣quam sustine. Pancirollus. Ne si aqua interim effluxisset, am∣plius sibi dicendi praebita foret facultas,
 least he might not have leave to speak any more, if the water were spent. If any would give way to another to speak while his glasse was run∣ing, he might; which 
Demost.
 testifies, 
. But if he would not permit it, he bad the 
Praeco
 cast it forth 
 
. 
Ulpian.
 
, From which kind of pleading it grew into a proverb 
 
, 
 
Cicero, ad clepsydram,
 to speak by the houre or an alotted time. His speech being ended, he sate down. 
 The defendant then sitting all that while over against him, untill he had finished, after addressed himselfe to his answere, which he made from the right hand of the Iudicatorie; where he had a pulpit, and station; For this reason saies 
 
Aristotle,
 because they would make both parties equall, For the Suiter having the better part, they gave the upper hand to the defendant. Or because 
 or defendants, were for the most part in custody; If therefore the guard stood on the right hand, the defendant stood there also. Thence then he pleaded for himselfe; in which plea, he was only to wipe out those accusations which his adversarie laid against him, 
 
, And in that had the plaintif a prerogative. For he might


object what he would; nay and as 
 
Aristotle,
 forecast all be∣fore he commenced his suit, and feigne to himselfe what he pleased; The defendant, perhaps innocent, was at that instant to clear himselfe, 
 either by witnesse, or probabilities, of all doubts, whatsoever the plaintif could cast in. Sometimes the Plaintif and Defendant would desire Advocates of the Iudges▪ 
, hence 
 
, to plead for a fee. In the time of their pleading, witnesses were called, who came in, and gave their testimonies▪ and after they had uttered what they had to say, they went to the Altar (as it seemes to me, either in, or very nigh the Iudicatorie) and swore. 
 
Cicero. Athenis aiunt cum quidam apud eos sanctè graviter{que} vixisset, & testimonium dixisset publicè, &, ut mos 
raecorum est, jurandi causa ad aras accederet, una voce omnes Iudices, ne is juraret, reclamasse.
 They report that in Athens when a certain man (
 
Xenocrates
) who had lived Godly and gravely among them, had given witnesse, and as the fashion of the Greekes is, approached to the Altar to take oath, all the Iudges with one voice cried that he should not. (They would not, it seemes, have beliefe rather be bound with re∣ligion then truth) Fit to this is the answer of 
Pericles
 to a friend of his desiring him 
 to testify a lye, which he was to avouch with an oath, I am your friend, quoth he▪ to the Altar, that is, as farre as conscience, religi∣on and honesty shall permit▪ hence 
 
us{que} ad aras,
 grew, I suppose to be a proverb. 
Plut. Apophth. p.
 112. Whether in this ceremony they touched the Altar, I cannot justly say; in delivering their testimonies they were wont to touch the tips of the eare (for reason to me un∣known;) called 
 from 
, 
etymologicon;
 (But I rather may suppose it to be a Roman fashion, where the Plaintif was wont to pluck his witnesse by the eare, for re∣membrance sake.

 6.) and at the end


thereof wish all destruction to themselves and house if they dealt Falsely. Which if they did, they were subject to a writ 
, of false witnesse, and he that suborned them 
. Sometimes the witnesse was not present at the doing of the wrong, but took it from others by hear-say, which the Greek Lawyers terme 
 as 
 
, when they take it from those that are dead, which went for currant, and was allowable: But to bring a testimony from the Mouth of one that was alive, and within the territories of 
Athens,
 it would not passe. As neither theirs who were discarded the liberties of the Citty, 
; or servants, or any man in his own cause. 
 The manner of witnesse was two∣fold, either by personall appearance and testifying 
, and then he was called 
, in no case lyable to the Law, 
: or else by writing, by which he offered him∣selfe to his questions or attachments in Law, against whom he witnessed; if he were not true; and this is 
. Both parties being heard and the altercation ceased, the 
Praeco
 cri∣ed, 
To whom E. N. hath seemed to violate right,
 (so they inter∣pret 
, 
jus violare
) 
let him cast in the black stone, or ho
∣low, to whom he seemeth not, the whole or white.
 For we must know that anciently the Greekes gave their sentences with black and white pebles, called 
 
 (which the French semblably terme 
Porcellaines,
 
 
porcus
) 
 
Ovid.




Mos erat antiquis, 
iveis atris{que} Lapillis,


His damnare reos, illis absolvere culpa.




The antique fashion was with white stones to absolve, with black to condemne the accused. Pertinent to which is the saying of 
Alcibiades,
 when he was called out of 
Sicilie
 to goe home and answere for his life, counting it foolish to goe thither, whence he never was like to escape; when one as∣ked 
 
; Wilt thou not trust thy country which begat thee to be thy Iudge? 
, quoth he, 
. No not her, that brought


me forth. For I fear least shee being ignorant, and not con∣ceiving the truth, mistake the black for the white stone. The black made 
tristem sententiam,
 and was so named; the sad sentence; the white 
candidam
 or acquitting. They used like∣wise black and white beanes; in respect of which 
Pythago∣ras
 is thought to have spoken as a riddle 
, not to eat beanes, by 
 
Nonnus
 interpreted 
, Not to undermine justice with bribes; or that men should get by the perverting of equity. I see no reason, but that I may think he meanes men ought not to be forward in getting places of Iudgement. For 
 
 in 
A∣ristophanes
 is by the Scholiast expounded 
, and 
 
 is used for a Iudge, which properly signifies an eater of beanes. But afterwards they had little pellets of brasse; The bloody ones of them were peirced through, therefore termed, 
 
: the saving were whole, 
. Of these every one took, of each one, from the Altar, as I have said, 
 where laying their hands upon the 
, or bals, they intimated by a transposition of them (as from the black to the white, and from the white to the black againe) that they would not for envy or by respects, but indifferently and tru∣ly judge. When then they were ready to passe sentence 
 the 
Praeco
 carried about the 
 or 
, a certain pitcher (for so 
 
Xenophon
 calls it, 
) having on the mouth of it a conveiance like a Tunnell, named 
, but the top there∣of was covered close, except a little hole for one pellet at a time to be put in, made for avoiding of deceipt, I suppose, least one man might cast in more; and therefore were they to touch the 
, only with the forefinger, middle, and thumb. 
 
Aristoph.
 
. But we must know that the black and white pellets were not promiscuously cast into one pot, but two; 
 The one which freed was made of brasse called 
, whether because they first threw into it their voices, or because it may signify the better, I know not; The other that condemned, being


woodden 
. After the Crier had gone round with both, because some would keep their bals, and for favour not give their voice against a friend or great person, therefore he cried 
 
, Who hath not cast in his ball? let him rise. So he rose and threw it in. Then they took them out and numbred them; and in matter of lands, mony or the like, whose vessell (for there were as many set as the num∣ber of the litigants came to) had most; got the upper hand. At the counting of them a Magistrate stood by with a rod, and laid it over those that were told, least they should mistake the one for the other or wittingly doe it. For so were they wont to doe; thence named 
 
. Which 
 
Teucer
 objects to 
Menelaus
 about 
Ajax,
 when by his deceit the ar∣mour was given to 
Ulysses;
 and therefore he calls him 
. Sch. 
: not amisse 
. 
 When the number was known, if the white or solid bals were more, they took their tables, which they had in their hands, and drew a short line, as a token of absolution; if the black or hollow were more, they drew a longer line, as con∣demning. Hence 
 
, may be used, for to condemne every body. The thing it selfe they termed 
 
, as 
Aristophanes.
 By this the one party being over∣thrown (
 as none ever was without the sentence of the Iud∣ges) his adversary wrote down what dammages he should pay, which they terme 
. 
 
Plutarch▪
 
. 
 For it was a use of old for those that went to Law to make agreements (I know not whether by oath, for they did sweare by three Gods 
, 
 and put it into the 
Echinus,
 that they would stand to such and such conditions, before sentence, that he that was cast should undergoe somewhat; and after∣wards 
, that is set down what losse of limbs or life, or meanes &c. For although they did 
 
 give their estates as pledges to answere and meet at the Court; yet it may be that might be lesse or more then the fine. There was


in causes capitall an other proceeding, like to that in the City of 
 
Uenice;
 where they gave two sentences. In the first they determined whether they should condemne or free; If in the first he was condemned, the manner of punishment was ordained in the second. But if in the first they found no cause of death, they bad the accused to fine himselfe, which 
 
Xe∣nophon
 intimates by 
, and if it were too little the Iud∣ges doubtlesse made it more, as the 
Scholiast
 of 
Aristopha∣nes,
 if I forget not: The custome is set down by 
 
Cicero,
 speaking of 
Socrates. Ergo ille quo{que} damnatus est &c.
 And he too was condemned: nor only by the first suffrages, but also by those which by the appointment of the Lawes they were to give the second time. For in 
Athens
 the accused being found guilty, if the offence were not capitall, they weighed and considered the penalty. When the sentence was to be given by the Iudges, they asked the defendant, what he thought himselfe to have deserved to forfait, &c. (In the 
Ve∣netian
 Common-wealth this is not observed.) In tryall if there be more for the prisoners liberty, then against him, he is streight acquitted, but if more then halfe be in the pot of con∣demnation he suffers. 
 
Socrates
 at the first had two hundred eighty and one more against him, then on his side; and at the next eighty more were added to the former, so in all he had three hundred threescore and one condemnatory suffrages. But fewer might have done as much. For we read in 
 
De∣mosthenes
 of 
Cimon
 like to be punished with death 
, if three had not been wanting. And againe 
 
. Nay one was suf∣ficient, 
 
Demosthenes.
 
. But 
Vlpian
 on the place 
, saies, that he was lightly punished. 
 If the voices were equall, then was the prisoner loosed; because sometimes he might be accused up∣on. suspicion; or of those things which he did not willingly commit, or perhaps was sued out of envy, and many other reasons given by 
 
Aristotle:
 therefore did the Lawgiver


leaue some place for pitty and compassion. To which the Iudges were often moved. And therefore would they plead the 
 deserts of their ancesters; their own liues formerly wel led. 
 Sometimes shewed they their wounds; and brought
 the venerable gray haires of their parents, but 
 mothers chiefly, to intercede in silence: Sometimes embracing their children in their armes, they held them up in the Iudges view; or caused them to 
 come up into the 
, or pulpit, & supplicate with teares; which wrought so much upon the Iudges, that 
 
Aristophanes
 in a scoff presents one 
, drowning his sentence in weeping. Then in compunction would the Iudges speak to the prisoner, 
 
, wishing him to goe downe from the 
, a token often of mercy; though now and then it proved otherwise. Nay it was a word of displeasure too, as when 
 
Plato
 would haue beene Advocate for 
Socrates.
 
, they thundred out, 
. Neither may I forget 
 
Amynias
 the bro ther of. 
Aeschylus
 the Tragoedian, who, when the people would haue stoned his brother for some impietie brought on the stage, held up his elbow and arme without a hand, lost in the fight at 
Salamis:
 by which spectacle the Iudges calling to minde the merits of 
Amynias,
 dismissed the Poet. Neither may I omit what 
 
Xenophon
 obiects to them, that they cared not so much for iustice, as regarded what might conduce most to their owne profit, and be convenient: 
 And that they condemned innocents, and spared offenders that could speake well. Furthermore another fault of theirs was the prolong∣ing of cases a whole yeare, saies 
 
Xenophon,
 and 
 
Aristopha∣nes.
 
. Now we doe not handle suits of aboue three∣score yeares, but we are put off untill the next day. 
. For wee come to triall within twenty yeares. This 
Xenophon
 imputes to the multitude of their im∣ploiments. As long as the case hung in suspense, the name of


the accused was (as among the 
Romans,
 whence 
 
Rei pendu∣li
) exposed in a publique table to the view of all men; which they terme 
. 
Demosthenes.
 
.
 
Vlpian.
 
. You see here the place too, 
viz.
 at the Statues of the 
Eponymi.
 Before a man was con∣victed, all that they obiected to him was but 
, by 
 
De∣mosthenes
 termed 
, a bare report; but after proofe 
. After iudge∣ment past, 
 
. An inditement of sacriledge, theft, murder, treason, is but 
; the evidence and conviction makes it 
, the sentence 
.






CAP. III. 
SECT. II.




 De Areopago, & eius appellatione. Areopagitae.




ON the hill, on which the 
Acropolis
 was built, stood the 
Areopagus,
 in the old translation of the Acts of the Apo∣stles rendered 
Vicus Martius,
 by our Englishmen, 
Mars his Street,
 Falsly. For 
 
 beares not that signification, but what 
 
Iustin Martyr
 interprets, 
, an eminent place. 
. For that Iudica∣tory was on a high rock. Therefore named by 
 
Aeschylus,
 & 
 
Euripides,
 
, by 
 
Ovid, Scopulus Mavortis,
 and 
 
Ennius, Areopagitica petra:
 so called, as fond Antiquitie would haue it, 
 from the judgement of the twelue Gods upon 
Mars,
 for killing 
Halirrhothius
 the sonne of 
Neptune.
 But 
 
Iustin Martyr,
 because he was there arrained of advou∣tery, 
. But alike true. It pleases mee well to consider the superstition of the ancients, that conse∣crated high places to their deities, and erected the statues of their Gods upon hills. As 
 
Parnes, Hymettus, Anchesmus,



whence 
Iupiter Parnethius, Hymettius, Anchesmius.
 And as in 
Athens, Neptune
 had a hill 
, 
Saturne
 another 
, 
Pan
 another. 
, 
Mercury
 another, 
 so 
Mars
 his 
Areopagus.
 
 
Aeschylus
 giues it a nomina∣tion from the 
Amazons,
 sacrificing to 
Mars
 there, when they came and fought against 
Theseus.
 Or if you will receiue the opinion of others▪ it takes the name from the cases in it hand∣led, of blood wilfully shed: so 
Hesychius,
 
, That when 
 
Iuvenal
 calls it 
Curiam Martis,
 you may interpret it, 
The Court of murther,
 but willingly committed. This is ter∣med by the 
 
Tragoedian, the most uncorrupt, sharp, reverend councell,
 then which nothing is more constant (saies 
 
Tully,
 comparing to it the Roman Senate) nothing more severe, as by 
 
Pseudo Dictys Cretensis
 it is styled 
Iudicium severissi∣mum per omnem Graeciam.
 Then which none iudged better, more iust, or honest, saies 
 
Xenophon.
 
 
Plutarch
 writes that this Court was ordained by 
Solon,
 and 
 
Cicero
 received the like opinion; but that seemes to contradict it, which 
Plutarch
 presently brings, quoted in the thirteenth table, that they who had lost their liberties should be restored againe, unlesse they were condemned by the 
Areopagites, Ephetae, Prytanes, Basi∣lois,
 of murther, slaughter, tyranny, when that Law was ena∣cted. And by and by 
 
, &c. Who were condemned in 
Areopagus
 before 
Solons
 time (if he first instituted the 
Areopagites.
) 
 Others are of opinion, that 
Solon
 added the 
Areopagites
 to the 
Ephetae
 (Iudges so called because when formerly the 
Basileus
 made inquisition after murder unwillingly committed, 
Draco
 made it 
, that is▪ tran∣slated it to the 
Ephetae,
 their number was but fiftie one. And though they iudged in fiue Courts once, yet by little & little they became ridiculous.) 
 
Possardus
 saies, he abolished their severity▪ and substituted the 
Areopagites.
 But 
 
Vrbo Emmius
 more probably, that 
Solon
 was not the Author of this Senate▪ but brought it into a better forme, made it more strong and firme, and augmented the power of it. For 
Draco
 it seemes


lessened the authoritie of it, deriving it to the 
Ephetae; Solo
 restored that authority and made it greater. 
 To this compa∣ny none were admitted, but wise, wealthie, and noble men; 
 famous for good life, and innocencie, 
, whom no man could iustly charge of misdemeanour. Nay, men, whose behaviour was intolerable, 
 
, after they were chosen into the Colledge of the 
Areopagites,
 abhorring and blushing at their former dispositions, 
, changed their natures, & embraced vertue. The number of them is uncertaine. 
 
Nice∣phorus
 makes them but nine; as 
Maximus
 too out of 
 
Philo∣chorus; Pachymerius
 fiftie and one. But what 
Maximus
 pro∣duces after, is somewhat, that they consisted of fiftie and one, beside the Nobilitie most wise and rich. 
. By which words hee seemes
 to ayme at the nine 
Archontes,
 
 who when they had gover∣ned one yeare, and given an account of their offices, and had administred all things iustly, were chosen yearely into this so∣cietie. For which election annuall, the number was doubtful. For some might die in that space; or all liue, and in the next yeare be encreased. 
Uolaterran
 out of an old inscription in 
Acropolis,
 that they were three hundred; 
, &c. To the most famous 
Rusius Festus, Proconsul of Greece & Areopagite, the councel of Areopagus consisting of three hun∣dred;
 and the people of 
Athens
 set up this monument 
for a te∣stimoniall of his good will and benevolence.
 But that might on∣ly happen when this was erected. 
 They continued all their life time in this dignitie, and were never put out, 
, unlesse for some grand offence. 
 
Bozius
 tells us (how true I wot not) that they were all Priests. 
Athenienses olim, &c.
 The 
Athenians,
 quoth he, did striue to challenge to themselues the prerogatiue of wisdome, and to them is it bent what the Apostle saies, 
The Greekes seek after wisdome.
 Neverthelesse their 
Areopagus,
 who had the power of all things consisted of Iudges that were Priests, and the High


Priest of all that asked every of their sentences, took the suf∣frages. Their authoritie was unlimited. For 
 they were o∣verseers of all, 
 Iudges of wilfull murthers, wounds given out of pretended malice: which would make some, having a desire to driue a man out of 
Athens,
 goe to a Chirurgion and make an incision in their heads, that they might sue him whō they hated, upon an action of battery, as 
 
Mantitheus
 against 
Baeotus.
 They sate upon incendiaries, and impoisoners, if the partie died that took their doses. 
 They saw that the Lawes
 should be put in execution, such as 
Contaren
 would haue in 
Uenice
 to be Guardians to their Statutes. 
 In a word all great delinquencies came under their censures. They inquired in∣to the behaviours of men; and we read in 
 
Xenophon
 that they sharply reproved a young man for his loose living. 
, &c. sayes the 
Dipnosophist.
 
 
Va∣lerius Maximus. Est & eiusdem urbis
 
 
sanctissimum consilium Areopagus &c.
 There is likewise in that Citie the most sa∣cred Councell 
Areopagus,
 where they were wont most dili∣gently to enquire, what every of the 
Athenians
 did, by what gaine he maintained himselfe, and what his trade and actions were. That men, knowing and remembring that once they must giue an account of their liues, might embrace honestie. 
 The Greek author tells us that except in great cases of ne∣cessity they medled not with state affaires, but it seemes o∣therwise. For if any one say, quoth 
 
Tully,
 that the 
Attick
 Republique can be well governed, without the councell of the 
Areopagites;
 he may as well say that the world may bee governed without the providence of the Gods. When the 
Medes
 and 
Persians
 invaded 
Greece,
 
 by the advise of them was the war waged, wherein 
Themistocles
 purchased an ever lasting memory of a victory. 
 And when their publique Trea∣surie was bare, they furnished each man with eight 
Drach∣mes,
 and stored the ships with Mariners. Which advise, when they had wonne the day, was a cause, saies 
 
Aristotle,
 
, to giue strength and sinewes to the


Commonwealth. 
 Vnder their sight were all the youth of 
Athens.
 For this reason especially, because that when they were reckoned among men, and were come to age, they nee∣ded more care to be had of them, then when they were chil∣dren; not observed by our countrymen in sending their sonnes young to the 
Innes of Court
) youth and heat of blood, unstaidnesse in iudgement, rashnesse in adventures, and pronenesse to vice, leading, or rather carrying headlong ten∣der yeares to their owne destruction. To them appertained blasphemies against their Gods, violating of religion, and di∣vulging mysteries, as when 
 
Euryclides
 the 
Hierophanta
 in answer to the question of 
Theodorus,
 
; who offended against the mysteries? 
, replied, such as open them to those who are not initiated. Therefore quoth the Philosopher, art thou impious. For which crime, had not 
Demetrius Phalereus
 befrended him, the 
Hierophanta
 was in danger, 
, to haue beene brought before the Councell of 
Areopagus.
 By vertue of which a
thority S
t
 
Paul
 was here judged for teaching strange Gods (as they supposed.) 
 For although that the 
Athenians
 were under the 
Romans,
 yet their Lords made them 
, 
sui iuris,
 and permitted thē to keep their ancient customes. The manner of proceeding in this Court, was thus. After the fellon
e committed, the ap∣pellant brought his inditement to the 
Basileus,
 who giving the prisoner and his accuser audience once a moneth, at three severall times to debate the businesse, in the fourth moneth, brings in the accusation to the 
Areopagites,
 
 and putting off the crowne which he was wont to weare, sate down as iudge with the 
Areopagites
 in the dark: for they iudged by night, saies 
 
Lucian,
 that they might not regard the speaker, but what was spoken. It being there forbidden 
 
, to moue to compassion, and use Proems, as in other Courts, wherein they craved the Iudges favour and attenti∣on, which by 
Demosthenes
 are termed 
 
. This 
f
 
Ari∣stotle



calls 
, to speak beside the mat∣ter. Before the triall both parties sweare (which they style 
 
) The appealer standing upon the 
testes
 of a Goat, a Ram, and a Bull (usuall to the 
Greeks, as Tyndareus
 swore the Suiters of 
Helena,
 that they should revenge any wrong done to her and her predestinated husband, 
 
, and 
Hercules
 to the children of 
Heleus
 
) took oath, therefore named 
; in which he maintai∣ned that he dealt iustly and rightly, and that he was ioyned in affinity to the slaine man; 
 which if he were not, hee could not prosecute, the Law forbidding. The reason why he stood 
, I suppose is, because they are the instruments of ge∣neration, and in that oath, if he were not true, hee wished an extirpation of his house, 
 and his posterity. In which if he were periured, he was liable to no punishment, as a∣mong the Romans. 
 
Iurisjurandi contempta religio satis De∣um ultorem habet.
 For swearing is punished by a revenging God, but if any swore false by the life of the Prince, he fell un∣der
 the 
Iulian
 Law, 
Laesae Maiestatis.
 After this the prisoner swore; which among us will not be allowed. Then setting each of them upon 
 two silver stones, one of which was na∣med 
, the stone of iniury; the other 
, by 
Adrian Iunius
 thought 
 of innocence, not impudence. Then the appealer asked the prisoner three questions, which 
 
Aeschylus
 calls 
. First, whether hee were guilty or no, 
 
; to which he answered, 
 or 
, yea or nay: secondly, 
; for what reason he did the murther. Thirdly, 
; who were the A∣bettours. Then arose there certaine Lawyers, 
, who shewed whether the murther was committed 
 
, in iustice. (
 For in 
Athens
 there were such Councellours, to whom in matters of difficultie they had resort) By 
, you must understand those causes, in which 
 
Draco
 thought it lawfull to kill a man. As taking him committing uncleanesse with wife, mother, sister, daughter, or concubin, or any whom


he accounts among his children; the partie so offending might
 be slaine in the manner by him, against whom he had trespas∣sed. Likewise, in the defence of a mans goods, if the theefe were killed, impunity was granted. After this inquisition, they passed to sentence, which was given very privily as 
Iu∣venal
 intimates. 
Ergo occulta teges, ut Curia Martis Athenis;
 without speaking (as the 
Tabellares sententiae
 of the 
Romans,
 in
 which they wrot C. if they condemned. A. if absolved. N. L. if the case were not manifest) hence 
, for one that is close and silent; and 
, for one that is graue, and who can hold his peace, and in whose countenance is 
 
tristis severitas.
 
. Whatsoever they concluded of, stood irrecoverable, 
 nei∣ther could there be any appeale to another Tribunall. And no marvail. For so upright was their sentence, 
 that none, either Appellant or prisoner, could ever say, that hee was uniustly condemned. Nay both parties, as well those that are cast, as they that cast, are alike contented. 
 
. After doome the prisoner was to suffer death. In which execution also the 
Areopagites
 had a care least the innocent should be punished with the guilty. 
 When there∣fore they had condemned a woman for poisoning another, they deferred the execution, because shee was great with child, and straight way after her delivery put the mother to death. Which custome is by us also observed at our Assises. 
 It will not be amisse to relate one memorable thing done in the time of 
Dolabella
 Proconsul of 
Asia,
 who, when a dame of 
Smyrna
 was brought before him, for killing her husband and sonne, who had deprived her of a hopefull youth, begot of her by a former husband, referred the audience of the matter to the 
Areopagites;
 who commanded the woman and her accu∣ser to appeare some hundred yeares after; that by such a bot∣tome of time, scarceable to be unwinded, they might shew, that neither would condemne nor acquit the woman. One thing more 
 
Quintilian
 tels us, that they condemned a boy


for putting out the eyes of Quailes. Because it was a signe of a minde, likely to proue most pernitious. Their power was shaken and somewhat pluckt downe by 
 
Ephialtes,
 a sore enemy of 
Oligarchicall
 government, and more enclining to the people, who was secretly slain by 
 
Aristodicus
 of 
Tana∣gra.

 D
 Iudicio 
.




AFter the siege of Troy some of the Grecians came with 
Diomedes,
 
 who kept the 
Palladium,
 to the coast of 
Attica,
 and arriving by night at 
Phalerum,
 supposing it to be an enemy country, went to make a prey. Where 
Domopho
 ignorant that they were Grecians came to aid and defend his own; and slew many of the 
Argivi,
 which they cast out unbu∣ried; whose bodies when no beast had toucht, (
 
 saies 
Pollux,
 the interpreter, 
nullus vivus,
 I better think it no creature, either foule or beast) 
Acamas
 shewed that they were 
Argivi
 having the 
Palladium;
 Being warned then by the Oracle (who named them 
, that is, 
 neither knowing nor known) they buried them; and in that place consecrated the 
Palladium;
 where they made also a judicatory, for murders unwillingly committed, and cal∣led it 
 
, 
juxta Palladium,
 as some. Here was 
Demopho
 first tryed, who returning from this battaile, killed with his horse, somewhat diverting, an 
Athenian;
 
 For whose kinred some think he satisfied the Law, or generally for the 
Argivi.
 
 If any had stricken a man or woman, and the party chanced to dye, he was judged in this Court. 
 In such cases the Law was very favourable; for the party offending was not punished with perpetuall exile, 
, as in wilfull felony; (kept by us in England once, called 
Abjuration,



(where the guilty had his life upon oath, that he would never returne) but he did 
 
, in a gentler terme. 
 For it was a custome of old, to give a certain summe of mony (the 
At∣tick
 Law 
, in wilfull, all was confiscate) to the kinred of the slaine, that they might not depart their country: but if they could not purchase an aboad they went somewhere else. 
 
Ovid. Caede puer factâ Patroclus Opunta reliquit.
 Their discontinuanc
 was but for one yeare, 
. The money disbur∣sed
 on such occasions was properly called 
, 
qu
si
 
, from 
 murder, as if it were the price of bloud. And the Scholiast of 
Sophocles
 tels us that 
 is spoken only 
 of payment of mony, but abusively of any pu∣nishment. 
 If the party wounded had forgiven the offender before his death, or the allies of the man desperatly hurt, none could afterwards compell him to f
ee; otherwise he 
ed. And in that flight he betook himselfe to some acquain∣tance; by whom he was cleansed from the guilt with cer∣tain ceremonies of washing, which the Romans call 
Februa.
 So was 
Patroclus, Peleus, Medea, Alomaeon
 purified. 
 
Ovid.

Impia lustratos pon

In this ceremony they did 
, sacrifice, saies 
 
Demosthenes,
 (which custome likewise was observed by the 
 
Traezenians
 in the lustration of 
Orestes
 from the bloud of his mother, which I gather by the feast which they presently celebrated


there, and yearly observed afterward. This manner was done with water, as you may read, taken out of the well 
Hip∣pocrene,
 made by the foot of 
Pegasus;
 the sprinkling was with a littell bough of Lawrell, as I suppose, by the words follow∣ing perswaded to it, which tell us, that when the 
 were buried, there sprouted out of them a Bay tree, and after that 
. This as I said was in his slight. 
. The proceeding in this court, was first, 
, such as before I mentioned, an oath of each party, accuser and defendant: secondly 
 their speeches of both sides, thirdly 
, Iudge∣ment. If the prisoner were found guilty, that is, unwillingly to have murdered, then had he a time appointed him, how long he should flee, as above said, untill he had made peace and gotten pardon from the Cousins of the deceased.

De Iudiciis 
.




AT Athens there was a temple erected by 
 
Aegeus
 (who lived in 
Delphinium
) to the honour of 
Apollo Del∣phinius
 and 
Diana Delphinia,
 
 where was the Tribunall na∣med 
, or 
. 
 In this Iudicatory were heard cases of murder, when the party confessed the fact, but pleaded that it was legitimate. 
 For the Law re∣quired no punishment of any man that should kill another taking him commiting adultery with his Wife, or unclean∣nesse with his Mother, Sister, Daughter, Concubine, or free Children. Likewise if in preservation of his goods or own defence he spilt bloud it was not capitall. The first that was arraigned here was 
Theseus,
 maintaining the right he had to slay the theeves, saies 
 
Pollux
 (I know not whether he mean 
Sciron
 and 
Procrustes
 &c.) and 
Pallas
 with his chil∣dren,
 who were rebels. Before this tryall of 
Theseus,
 who∣soever


had stain any body was compelled to flee the coun∣try, or staying dye, were the cause never so just. 
. Here they sate on things inanimate. As if a stone timber, iron, or such like, fall on a man, and kill him, if the party that 
ung this be not knowne, sentence was past on that thing which slew him; and the 
 
, that were the Masters of this court▪ were to see this thing cast out of the Territories of Athens▪ to which 
 
Aeschines
 alludes. 
. The first thing that here was judged was an axe, where with the Priest, whom they call 
, had s
ain an oxe on the altar of 
Iupiter Polieus
 in the time of 
E∣rectheus.
 
 In that part of 
Pireaeum
 which is next the Sea, is a place which they name 
, from 
Phreatus
 an 
Heros,
 some think; not because it stood in a pit, whence 
 
Pollux
 names it 
. Heere they were judged who having fled out of another country for unwilfull murther 
 
, they that drove him out not acquiting him, if in the space of his exile it happened that he wittingly 
lew another, he answered heere. The pro∣ceeding was in this sort. The Iudges assembled in 
, in a place seated on the Sea▪ 
 
; where the guilty drawing neare in a boat or bark, was to make his apology, 
, not coming to land or touch∣ing it, neither casting anchor 
 or moaring his bark; and if he were found guilty he underwent deserved punishment: if he were not found guilty they cleared him of that fact, not discharging him of the former, 
 
. I know not whether I may be of that opinion that others are in this, that if he were cast in this tryall, he was exposed to the cruell mercy of the wind and waves. These last quoted words seeme to contradict it. The first that ever answered here was 
Teucer,
 proving himself to be innocent of the death of 
Ajax;
 
 whom treacherously circumvented because he defended not, his father 
Telamon
 drove out of



Salamis,
 unto which that he might be restored he made ap∣peal to this court. Which gives light to 
 
Aristotle
 
. Iudicatories concerning men flying for murther, that care for their bringing back again, such as in 
Athens,
 
. When the party prosequuting will not admit of reconciliation.

 De Tribunalibus reliquis. 
.




BEsides these Courts of bloud and causes criminall, there were for civill matters these, 
Heliaea,
 of which before for the excellency of it I treated. 
. Of this name there were two, 
, the greater and the middle. In this Court were handled matters 
aies 
Petit
 that exceeded not one drachme, to which 
 
Aristotle
 might be thought to look speaking of Iudicatories, 
 &c. And this was the mean∣ing of 
 
Pausanias,
 
. Suing here for the least occasions. The 
Vndecimviri
 were Iudges of the Court, which made 
Petit
 to suppose that it was not to be reckoned among the 
. It stood 
 
, in an obscure place of the city; whence 
▪ in 
 
De∣mosthenes,
 is by 
Ulpian
 expounded, privily, by a 
Metaphor
 ta∣ken from the situation of this Iudicatory, or▪ 
, from goods secretly hidden. 
, from the forme of it, which seemes to have been triangular. 
; and 
, from the colours that were painted 
 
 upon the post of the entry, answe∣rable to which there was a staffe given to the Iudges, that


they might know in what court to sit; For they presently went to that court which had the same colour with their staffe. 
. From the statue of 
Lycus
 on 
Heros,
 which was there setup, having the face of a wolfe; where likewise the statue of 
Iuno
 stood visaged in the same manner. But wee must not omit that the image of 
Lycus
 was erected in every court; hence 
 
, 
Lyci decem,
 for sycophants and such as corrupt judgement, because that such persons were very frequent and busy there; And so think I 
Pollux
 is to be read 
 
 (understand 
 or the like) at which they who bribed the Iudicato∣ries met 
Zenobius
 helpes my conjecture 
. The 
 Scholiast of 
Aristophanes
 writes that this noble 
Lycus
 had a Temple near the Iudicatory, where the Iudges divided their mony for pay, three oboli, to each, a day. 
 
. This was a great Iudicatory; so named from 
Metichies
 an artificer, which built it. Here, who had passed thirty yeares of his age and was well and nobly descended and owed nothing to the publique treasury, might be chosen Iudge. 
r of such they all consisted. 
. Some have falsly supposed that there was a Tribunall so called; neither did 
 
Meursius
 think otherwise, when he translated these words of 
 
Pollux,
 
, 
apud tribunal Ardettum.
 The fault crept in by the negligence of the transcriber; for the place is thus to be read, 
 The Iudicatories were wont to take oath or be sworne in 
Ardettus. Ardettus
 is a place near the river 
Ilissus,
 so named from 
Ard 
tus
 a Peere, who swore the people, being in sedition & mutinie, to love and amity. Where afterwards, as is most probable, the Iudges took oath (I cannot justly say presently after their election) to give sentence according to the lawes; and con∣cerning things to which no Lawes were enacted, in aequity and justice, 
 
by Apollo Patrius, Ceres,
 and 
Iupiter Rex.
 And this the Et
mologist affirmes, speaking of 
Ardettus,
 
 




. The Iudges in this place took their oath touching the discharge of their office. From whence among the Ancients such as would presently sweare, were called 
 
Ardetti,
 proverbially; as also those who were perjurious and forsworne. 
 
. Thus have we viewed the Athenian Iudicato∣ries, in number tenne. For Murther, 
Areopagus, Palladium, Delphinium, Prytaneum,
 and 
Phreattys.
 For other matters, 
Heliaea, Trigonum, Parabystum
 (not the 
Medium
 but 
Majus
) 
Metichi forum, & ad Lycum,
 where the 
 were wont to sit, saies 
 
Possardus;
 of whom; because 
 
Emmius
 numbers them among 
Iudicia quatuor praecipua
 the four chief Courts, I will now speak. But of every Tribe were chosen 
 forty our men, 
 above threescore yeares old, who judged in severall Tribes, as it fell to them by lot. And if any refu sed to s
t according to his lot, he was deprived of the privi∣ledges 
. 
Athenian
 Cittizen. 
 In former time there came no 
ontroversy into the Courts, which had not first past through their hands (if it exceeded tenne drachmes. Al∣though 
 
Vlpian
 tels us that they determined of petty busi∣nesses) but that seemes to be, 
, holy matters, if 
Pollux
 be so to be read. For some things there were which came not under their jurisdiction. What ever the 
 judged, if the plaintif and defendant, or either of them liked not the award, they might referre it to the Se∣nate (as appears out of the 
 Argument of 
Demosth. Orat. contra Callippum, &
 
 
Pollux
) at which removing of the suit they were to cast their suffrages into a pot as they gave them, on what side soever, for the plaintif by themselves, and for the defendant by themselves. 
 When they were appointed for the hearing of a case, they were to meet at the place for them ordained, there to expect both parties untill the even, at which time if neither, or but one was present, it was in their power to fine them according to the Law. At the time they entred the suit, and wrot the accusation, with the 
ine


which was required for dammages; they received as a fee from the plaintif one drachme, which they called 
 
, as also another from the defendant, when they gave him his oath. This office was but annuall; And because they would pervert justice, (as 
 
Demosthenes
 is witnesse, 
 although they were not to judge before they had sworn) give sen∣tence according to favour, envy, or for gaine, therefore 
 at the yeares end they made an account of their function upon the last day of 
 
Thargelion,
 on which it was lawfull for any to speak what he could object against them; and if any were faulty, they were 
. Thus much of the 
. There were other 
 likewise, such as our Civili∣ans call 
Arbitri compromissarii:
 & we in english Arbitrators: whom two parties choose with a resolution to stand to their determination; whether in matter of debt, covenant, or o∣ther controversie soever. Such by the 
Attick
 law any might request, but with a necessity of abiding at their judgement. 
 For they could not appeal from them to any other court. To referre matters to their arbitrement, the Greekes terme 
. And it will not be superfluous here to re∣late the story of 
Bunas
 an 
Athenian,
 whom when the 
Ele
 and 
Calydoni
 had chosen arbitrator in a differency, after he had heard both parties, hee prolonged the sentence untill at last he died. Whence it grew to a proverb, 
 
, 
Bunas judicat,
 Bunas judgeth, of those that defer to passe sentence, and hold a case long in suspence.

 De Nominibus Iudicialibus.




HAving thus treated of the 
Attick
 Courts, it followes that I speak of their Tearmes of Law, Writs, and Accu∣sations. These were of two sorts, private and publique. The publique were properly termed 
, saies 
 
Emmius.
 Of



 there were divers sorts. 
 saies 
 
Vlpian
 is 
, of any trespasse against the Law, by which the Sta∣tutes of the Commonwealth are violated; and most properly, 
 quoth he, elsewhere, it signifies an accusation made accor∣ding to the Law; or to come nearer, it is the same which in English we call a 
 Writ or Right, in Latine 
Actio
 or 
Formu∣la,
 as in 
 
Sueton, Iniuriarum formulam intendere,
 to serue a man with a Writ. 
 
 is a kinde of an Information made against any for abuses in the Mines, or Custome houses, for converting Tribute money to a mans owne use, or the like. Which offences were brought to the 
Archon
 in writing, with the names of the accuser and accused, and the fine which the parties convinced should undergoe, to bee paid to him to whom the wrong was offered. But if the Informer had not the 
 part of the suffrages, hee was to lay downe the 
ixt part of the fine; which the 
d
 Orators call 
, from 
,
 because it signifies the sixt part of a Drachme. At the end of the accusation, the informer was to subscribe the names of the witnesses that were present. In generall, all discoveries of private iniuries are called 
, which in Latine you may name 
delationes.
 For which the Romans allotted the fourth part of the forfeit, whence they are stiled 
Quadruplatores;
 but among the 
Athenians
 not so, if 
 
Pollux
 say right. 
. The amercement fell to the person iniured, although another accused for him. If the fi
e were written down a thousand Drachmes, & the Accuser had not the fift part of the voices; he paid two hundred and one Drachme; if it exceeded; a thousand, foure hundred and one. 
 is a Writ against those that owe to the Citie Treasurie, and yet goe about to beare office, saies 
 
Ul
ian,
 which by the 
Attick
 Law was ut∣terly forbidden. The 
 Scholiast of 
Aristophanes,
 takes it for the accusing of any that did amisse in publique affaires; and the 
 Interpreter of 
Demosthenes
 in another place, 



for men disfranchised. But 
 
Pollux
 teaches us that it is a de∣claration made to the 
Archon
 against one taken in the maner; which the 
Greeks
 terme 
, 
 Schol, 
Nazianz
 
, 
Pollux
 expresses by 
, when the offence is confessed. Because men so apprehended were for∣ced to condemne themselues; no further evidence required then from their owne mouthes. By which acknowledgment of their guiltinesse, without greater triall, they receiued their doome: 
 as among us when a prisoner arraigned, confesses his inditement to be true, no twelue men goe upon him: there resteth but the Iudges sentence of the paine of death. Whence grew our proverb, 
Confesse and be hanged.
 
 
Pollux
 
. He that thus made his declaration, was to subscribe his name, that if he were false, he might be liable to the Writ, 
. The declaration was against men who were not present. 
, is a carrying of a man before the Magistrate, being ta∣ken in the fact, whom otherwise he was to accuse by declara∣tion in his absence. By which a thousand Drachmes were en∣dangered. In this 
; they brought not all offenders to the same Magistrats, but according as they were made Iudges of such and such offences; 
 sometimes to the eleven, some∣times to the 
 
Thesmothetae,
 sometimes to the 
Archon.
 Now if a man had found out any indebted to the publique Treasu∣rie, or bound for those places or countries, where it was not permitted for him to goe, or one who had committed mur∣ther, if by reason of weaknesse he durst not venture to appre∣hend the person, and 
, he would perhaps fetch the 
Ar∣chon
 to the house where such a party lay hid, which the 
Attick
 Lawyers terme 
, is when a fellon hath committed murther, and flies for succour to any; (
 as the Law suffered any to receiue him) if the kindred of the slaine or others had required the malefactour to be delivered to thē, and the protector would not, it was lawfull to enter into his house, and carry away any three persons, as some translate it,


or all sau
 three, 
, as others, who were to answere
 for the outrage done. But who so entred uniustly, was not to 
 unpunished. 
, saies 
 
Vlpian,
 is an accusa∣tion concerning great and publique matters, such as 
 else∣where he speakes of, to wit, the dissolution of the 
Democra∣cic;
 or if an Oratour had spoken what was not for the benefit of the weale publique, if any went to warres before they were sent, or betrayed a Garrison, army, or fleet. In other ac∣cusations, if the accuser had not the fift part of the suffrages, he was fined a thousand Drachmes, and lost the priviledges of a Citizen, in this he was uncontrolable. But in after time, be∣cause men would accuse presently for none, or small offences; therefore was there a Law enacted, that whosoever accused by 
, and had not the fift part of voices on his side, was fined a thousand Drachmes, although he lost not the pri∣viledges of a Citizen. This 
 contained no written crimes, but was only by bare word of mouth; and as the accu∣sation was given, so was the defence made according to the Law called 
. The Senate was 
Iudge
 (
Pollux
 saies that 
Solon
 made a thousand to sit on this, and 
Phalereus
 1500. Where the interpreter erres. For 
 is 500 to them, as 
, in 
Demosthenes,
 and somewhat more) and whom they found delinquent, if in small faults, they 
; but if the offence were heinous, they committed him to prison. Thus much for publique actions; private were these that fol∣low, more properly called 
.


. is an Action against a man, who when two shall s
uffle giues the first blow, which the 
 Greeks call 
. 
 The matter was heard before the Iudge
; and though the Law ordained not any set summe of money for dammages, yet it was permitted for the partie smitten to write down what he thought fitting. 
 The reason why these actions were so strictly looked into, was least any not able to defend himselfe with his hands, should seeke to revenge him∣selfe with stones, or other hurtfull weapon.


 
. Somewhat neere our proviso of giving the lye, least by taunting and reproachfull words, men be provo∣ked to blowes. 
. Is when any man receiues dam∣mage and hurt in estate by another man. 
 As to turne water into his ground, by which it is anoyed; 
 To refuse to pay mo∣ney where it is required, or to giue it to another. 
 To promise to beare witnesse in a suit, and then not be present, by which the case falls, & the like. 
. About pawnes▪ I suppose, which men that needed mony were wont to leaue with the usurers▪ 
 as cloathes, housholdstuffe, &c. Or about money put to the Banck, which the exchangers did employ to the advantage of the owners, as I gather out of 
 
Demosthe∣nes.
 The word imports both. 
. Of divorce. 
 For they were wont to put away their wiues, in former time, upon discontent or hope of greater portions; which di∣vorce they called 
, & as 
Lysias
 
▪ on the hus∣bands side, and on the wiues 
; for hee did as it were turne her away, she was said to forsake him. 
. Of ill usage of parents, as not releiving them if they were poore. Of wiues against husbands, of Pupils against Tutors. 
 of theft, after what manner soever. Which if it were by day, was not capitall, but by night was deadly. 
. Such as our Act of Parliament hath allotted for extortion, it being by 
 Law provided in 
Athens
 that none should take too much use, although once allowed by 
Solon,
 that any might make the best of his money: which he termes 
 
. Of usury I shall speak more in Chap. of money. 
. When men had bargained and would not stand to it. 
 
Aristotle.
 
. When men broke the Articles which they made to each other, about dividing of inheritance be∣tweene man and man, or between citie and citie, concerning free trading, as that of the 
Carthaginians

 were usually confirmed by oath to each other.

 a conten∣tion


about bearing office, in which they seeke to haue a time appointed, when a man shall enter into it. For the discharge whereof they are to proue him fit. 
. When parents died and left their daughters inheritrices, the kinred was wont to sue each other, to make it appeare who was nea∣restioyned in blood, that he might marry her. Hence a Virgin to whom an inheritance falls is called 
, that is, 
Contro∣versa.
 
. About letting of houses. (For 
He∣rodotus
 termes that 
, which other Greek writers 
, it is as well to set to hire, as to take to rent, 
 and 
, to let out. Which they often did for want of mony, which that they might obtaine the quicker, they wrote over their dore as we use to doe, 
This House is to be let.

Archon
 that such a house was to be let, he then put it out upon some pledge for security. But if the house were let un∣der the yearely rent it could bring in, or was suffered to re∣maine void of a Tenant, to the losse of the Pupill, then was it lawfull for any man to sue the Guardian in the 
Archon's
 court? upon a Writ of

 the use was to nominate in their Testaments and last Wills, whom they would haue to bee Guardians. Which office after they had undertaken, if they should defraud the Orphans of their patrimonie, or any part thereof, they were sued with a Writ 
, as 
 
Demosthe∣nes
 did sue his as soone as he came to age. But if the matter were not questioned within fiue yeares after the pupil was admitted among the number of men, by the 
 Law the Guar∣dian could not be taxed. 
, Of a Master against a Servant ingratefull for his manumission, not doing his dutie to his Master. Because, as 
 
Demosthenes
 witnesses, it was the nature of servants once made free, not only to be ingratefull, bu
 also to hate their Masters most of all men, as those who 
 
een conscious to their servitude. It was enacted there∣fo
 that whosoever was convicted of ingratitude should a∣gaine be made a bonds
aue 
Valerius Maximus. Age, quid il∣
 
titum Athenarum, quam memorabile? quod convictus à patr 
 libertus ingratus, iure libertatis exuitur.
 The Ro∣mans did not onely acquit them of the libertie of the Citie


(which the 
Athenians
 gaue not) but made them also slaues, which punishment they terme 
 
Maximam capiti
 diminuti∣onem.
 
. If any man put away his wife hee was to re∣store her portion againe; if he refused he was 
, that is▪ every moneth for one pound to pay nine 
oboli
 which the 
Atticks
 terme 
 
, the revenew of her dowrie. The Writ whereby he was sued was 
, for the repayment. 
 
, If any went to Law, as clay∣ming Title to an house, he was first to serue him that dwelled in it with a Writ 
, by which he demands his rent for the time the defendant had the house: if it were for any parcell of land, there was a Writ 
 given out, for the provent and fruit thereof; afterwards (in both cases alike) they procee∣ded to an 
, in which they claymed right and title to the house or land. Although in all these trialls the defendant were cast, yet could he keep iustly either house or land: but if in a third triall, which they call 
, he were overthrowne, he was compelled to relinquish his possession. This 
 al∣so is a Writ against those that would cast an inhabitant out of his house, it being termed from 
, to throw forth. 
 It is also a Writ of Execution against any overthrowne in the Court, and fined a thousand Drachmes, which at such a day he was to pay; and if he laid it not downe upon the nayle, there went forth a Writ 
, to make enter upon the lands and possessions of him so cast. It is also a Right against any who wil not suffer him, who hath bought any thing of the publike, to reap the fruit thereof. Who either withholds any thing from the owner, or violently takes from any, &c. 
 When two had beene partners in estates, and one of them would haue a dividence made, if the other refused, hee might be constrained to it by the Writ. 
. Because the Market place among the Greeks was the fittest to cheat & cosen in, as 
 
Anacharsis
 was wont to say, therefore the 
Athe∣nians
 enacted that none should buy in the market place; (to which the 
Scythian
 wiseman pointed likewise, sayng▪ that


they forbad to speake false, and yet did 
) if any man had bargained for any thing, and another sued and doubted of the right of it, 
 he might require the seller to confirme the lawfulnesse of the thing sold, and maintaine it 
inst all controversie, otherwise the seller was liabl
 
o 
. For although in 
Athens
 they bought for the most part

Scaliger
 and 
 
Ca∣saubon
 truly interpret it, 
 
Turnebus, Repraesent at a pecuniâ:
 yet sometime gaue they 
Earnest
 onely to make the thing sure, which the 
Greeks
 and 
Latines
 call 
 
, from the 
 
He∣brew
 
. This seemes to me to haue been the hundreth part of the mony which was to bee paid for the thing bought, as 
 
Stobaeus
 out of 
Theophrastus.
 Where you may read likewise that it was the custome, when any thing was to bee sold, to bring a note thereof to the Magistrate some threescore daies before. 
▪ For the laying open of any thing, concerning which was a suit in law, by 
 
Pollux

. When any should offer to take another mans servant, and make him free against the will of the Master, which the Greeks terme 
 
 is a suit about neerenesse of blood, in matter of inheritance, when a man dies without issue of his own body▪ 
▪ When a man went to proue that hee was to challenge the inheritance of right, as neere of blood; or upon some other conditions: from 
; because he laid downe the tenth part of the inheritance, which if hee were cast in Law, hee was to pay, if the cause were private, saies 
 
Budaeus:
 but if publique, the fift. 
 
. When any shall protest that an inheritance doth hang in controver∣sie, and is 
, as a true heire being still aliue, of which thing chiefly treats the Oration of 
Demosthenes
 against 
Leo∣chares.

Drachmes,

 Against those that unjustly cite to the Court. 
 when any is accused of encroaching into the number of Cittizens, and gives gifts to escape free▪ 
 when


any was accused of making a decree or Law contrary to for∣mer statutes. This accusation was called 
; because the accuser swore that it was against the Lawes or unjust or inconvenient for the Common-wealth.

Whether the Orators were not given to Lust and incontinency, whether they had not spent their patri∣monies or dealt unkindly with their parents or lead a life a∣ny other waies blameable, whereupon they were discarded the priviledges of the Citty and not suffered to plead or speak publikely.

 so) were cast hee payed

, when a man is summoned to answere before the Arbitri a controversy, if he sweare that he is sick or pretends a journey from home, and appears not at the day appointed, he was cast in 
 
E∣remodicio,

enne daies to sue out 
, wherein he re∣proved the sentence and made it of no effect so as it came to its first state againe. But if he could not obtaine a

, When any was absent from the Court or heard not his name called by the Crier to answere thereunto he was fined, as conscious of Eremodicium, and if within the space of two Moneths he did not renew the suit (which is 
) he was sure to pay the fine. 
, when any man wil challeng out of goods forfeited and publiquely sold somewhat as debt to him, or say that part belongs to him, the state would narrowly search into it, which thing they terme

Athens

, If any owed to the Citty Treasury, and his name were registred, and before the discharge of the mony his name were blotted out, they sued him before the 
Thesmotheta
 
, but if his name were never entred he was prosequted by an 
 proper only to such as dealt in the mines, like to the Stanneries in the County of 
Cornwall
 my coun∣try, and 
Devon-shire
 her sister. 
 Lyable to this Court were they who should thrust any man from his work, who should dig within another mans liberties, who should bring wea∣pons thither, I suppose to take away Minerals by violence, who should kindle any fire in the Mines &c. Who should of∣fer to take away the props that upheld the weight of the in∣cumbent earth, which to doe was death, as 
 
Plutarch
 tels us. There was likewise 
 against the labourers in the Mines, who if they intended to begin a new work were to acquaint the overseers appointed for that end by the peo∣ple, that the foure and twentieth part of the new coine might come to the publique Treasury. Now if any presu∣med


to work who had not made it known to the officers it was lawfull for any to accuse him 
. About mony put out to the mony changers. 
 For 
 among the 
Atticks

 in the lawyers of latter time, 
in Iure Graeco-Rom.
 Sometimes indeed they used

 and 
 have this difference, that 
 
 is the Iudge that gives sentence, 
 is he that put in the controversy, to be the meanes that the sen∣tence past against the defendant. 
 
 is when a man deeply indebted pretends that he is not able to discharge all and therefore desires the people that a part thereof might be remitted.
